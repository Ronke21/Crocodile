<text>An apiary (also known as a bee yard) is a location where beehives of honey bees are kept. Apiaries come in many sizes and can be rural or urban depending on the honey production operation. Furthermore, an apiary may refer to a hobbyist&#x27;s hives or those used for commercial or educational usage. It can also be a wall-less, roofed structure, similar to a gazebo which houses hives, or an enclosed structure with an opening that directs the flight path of the bees.

== History ==

Apiaries have been found in ancient Egypt from prior to 2422 BCE where hives were constructed from moulded mud. Throughout history apiaries and bees have been kept for honey and pollination purposes all across the globe. Due to the definition of apiary as a location where hives are kept, its history can be traced as far back as that of beekeeping itself.

== Etymology ==
The first known usage of the word &quot;apiary&quot; was in 1654. The base of the word comes from the Latin word &quot;apis&quot; meaning &quot;bee&quot;, leading to &quot;apiarium&quot; or &quot;beehouse&quot; and eventually &quot;apiary.&quot; Beekeepers may be referred to as &quot;apiarists&quot; or &quot;ones who tend apiaries.&quot;

== Structure ==

Apiaries may vary by location and according to the needs of the individual operation. Typically, apiaries are composed of several individual hives. For more information on specific hive structures see the beekeeping and beehive articles. In the case of urban beekeeping, hives are often located on high ground, which requires less space than hives located at lesser altitudes. To direct the bees&#x27; path of flight in populous urban areas, beekeepers often construct tall fences which force the bees to fly higher and widen their search for food or place the hives in an enclosed apiary with an opening that directs bees&#x27; flight path up overhead.

== Location ==
Apiaries are usually situated on high ground in order to avoid moisture collection, though in proximity to a consistent water source—whether natural or man-made—to ensure the bees&#x27; access. Additionally, ample nectar supplies for the bees as well as relatively large amounts of sun are considered. They are often situated close to orchards, farms, and public gardens, which require frequent pollination to develop a positive feedback loop between the bees and their food sources. This also economizes on the bees&#x27; pollination and the plants&#x27; supply of nectar.

An apiary may have hive management objectives other than honey production, including queen rearing and mating. In the northern hemisphere, east and south facing locations with full morning sun are preferred. In hot climates, shade is needed and may have to be artificially provided if trees are not present. Other factors include air and water drainage and accessibility by truck, distance from phobic people, and protection from vandalism.

In the USA there are beekeepers—from hobbyists to commercial—in every state. The most lucrative areas for American honey production are Florida, Texas, California, and the Upper Midwest. For paid pollination, the main areas are California, the Pacific Northwest, the Great Lakes States, and the Northeast. Rules and regulations by local ordinances and zoning laws also affect apiaries.

In recent years US honey production has dropped and the U.S. imports 16% of the world&#x27;s honey. Internationally, the largest honey producing exporters are China, Germany, and Mexico. As in the United States the location of apiaries varies internationally depending on available resources and the operational need. For more information on nation-specific beekeeping see their respective articles, such as the Beekeeping in Nepal article. 

== Size ==

Apiary size refers not only to the spatial size of the apiary, but also to the number of bee families and bees by weight. With ample space there is no limit to the number of hives or bee families which can be housed in an apiary. The larger the number of hives held in an apiary the higher the yield of honey relative to resources, often resulting in apiaries growing with time and experience. Additionally a higher number of hives within an apiary can increase the quality of the honey produced. Depending on the nectar and pollen sources in a given area, the maximum number of hives that can be placed in one apiary can vary. If too many hives are placed into an apiary, the hives compete with each other for scarce resources. This can lead to lower honey, flower pollen and bee bread yields, as well as higher transmission of disease and robbing.

The size of an apiary is determined by not only the resources available but also by the variety of honey being cultivated, with more complex types generally cultivated in smaller productions. For more specific details on varieties see the classification portion of the honey article. The purpose of the apiary also affects size: apiaries are kept by commercial and local honey producers, as well as by universities, research facilities, and local organizations. Many such organizations provide community programming and educational opportunities. This results in varying sizes of apiaries depending on usage characteristics.

The maximum size of a permanent apiary or bee yard may depend on the type of bee as well. Some honey bee species fly farther than others. A circle around an apiary with a three-mile (5 km) foraging radius covers 28 square miles (73 km2). A good rule of thumb is to have no more than 25–35 hives in a permanent apiary, although migrating beekeepers may temporarily place one hundred hives into a location with a good nectar flow.

== Disease and decline ==
Apiaries may decline due to a scarcity of resources which can lead to robbing of nearby hives. This is especially an issue in urban areas where there may be a limited amount of resources for bees and a large number of hives may be affected.

Apiaries may suffer from a wide variety of diseases and infestations. Throughout history apiaries and bees have been kept for honey and pollination purposes all across the globe. Due to the definition of apiary as a location where hives are kept its history can be traced as far back as that of beekeeping itself. In recent years Colony Collapse Disorder due to pesticide resistant mites have ravaged bee populations. Beyond mites there are a wide variety of diseases which may affect the hives and lead to the decline or collapse of a colony. For this reason many beekeepers choose to keep apiaries of limited size to avoid mass infection or infestation. For more information on diseases which affect bee populations see the list of diseases of the honey bee.

<text>The eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis) is a small North American migratory thrush found in open woodlands, farmlands, and orchards.

The bright-blue breeding plumage of the male, easily observed on a wire or open perch, makes this species a favorite of birders. The male&#x27;s call includes sometimes soft warbles of &#x27; or&#x27;, or the melodious song &quot;&quot;.
It is the state bird of Missouri and New York.

==Taxonomy==
The eastern bluebird was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Motacilla sialis&quot;. The type location is South Carolina. Linnaeus based his short Latin description on the earlier more detailed descriptions by the English naturalists Mark Catesby and George Edwards. The eastern bluebird is now placed in the genus &quot;Sialia&quot; that was introduced by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1827 with the eastern bluebird as the type species.

Seven subspecies are recognized:
* &quot;S. s. sialis&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – south, southeast Canada, east, central US and northeast Mexico
* &quot;S. s. bermudensis&quot; Verrill, AH, 1901 – Bermuda
* &quot;S. s. nidificans&quot; Phillips, AR, 1991 – east central Mexico
* &quot;S. s. fulva&quot; Brewster, 1885 – southwest US to central Mexico
* &quot;S. s. guatemalae&quot; Ridgway, 1882 – southeast Mexico and Guatemala
* &quot;S. s. meridionalis&quot; Dickey &amp; Van Rossem, 1930 – El Salvador, Honduras and north Nicaragua
* &quot;S. s. caribaea&quot; Howell, TR, 1965 – east Honduras and northeast Nicaragua

==Description==
Eastern bluebirds measure long, span across the wings, and weigh .

Male bluebirds have a bright head, back, and wings. Their breast is a brownish red. Females are lighter with gray on the head and back and some blue on their wings and tail. In females, the breast is usually lighter in color than in males, and is more orange.

==Distribution and habitat==

The eastern bluebird is found east of the Rockies, southern Canada to the Gulf states, and southeastern Arizona to Nicaragua. The increase in trees throughout the Great Plains during the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated the western range expansion of the species. as well as range expansions of many other species of birds. From 1966–2015 the eastern bluebird experienced a greater than 1.5% annual population increase throughout most of its breeding and year-round ranges, with exceptions including southern Florida and the Ohio River valley.

Bluebirds tend to live in open country around trees, but with little understory and sparse ground cover. Original habitats probably included open, frequently burned pine savannas, beaver ponds, mature but open woods, and forest openings. Today, they are most common along pastures, agricultural fields, suburban parks, backyards, and even golf courses. Populations also occur across eastern North America and south as far as Nicaragua. Birds that live farther north and in the west of the range tend to lay more eggs than eastern and southern birds.
An isolated, insular subspecies of the eastern bluebird is found on Bermuda, and has a distinctive, brighter blue coloration compared to mainland populations. This population was formerly thought to have predated the colonization of the islands (making it one of only three extant, resident pre-colonization Bermuda landbirds, alongside the Bermuda white-eyed vireo and gray catbird). However, analysis of fossil strata found no evidence for the existence of bluebirds on the islands prior to European colonization. Using simulations and molecular evidence, a 2013 study found that the Bermuda bluebirds likely descend from very small founder population from a single colonization event during the 1600s. This colonization event could either be a natural one by migratory individuals or an anthropogenic introduction by early settlers, who are known to have introduced several other eastern North American birds like the northern cardinal (&quot;Cardinalis cardinalis&quot;) to Bermuda very shortly after colonization. It is likely that the alteration to the islands&#x27; ecosystem due to the clearing of native forest facilitated this colonization by providing optimal bluebird feeding habitat, along with a lack of predators.

==Behavior and ecology==
Eastern bluebirds are social, and will sometimes gather in flocks of over a hundred. However, they are territorial during the breeding season and may continue to defend a feeding area throughout the winter.
===Breeding===

Mating occurs in the spring and summer. A mature female typically raises two broods each season. Nests are constructed in trees within abandoned woodpecker holes or other cavities that provide adequate protection (usually several feet above ground). Construction of the nest is done primarily by the female and takes around 10 days to complete. These nests are small, cup-like structures lined with grass, feathers, stems, and hairs. Each female lays three to seven light-blue or, rarely, white eggs. The female incubates the eggs, which hatch after 13 to 16 days. The young cannot care for themselves upon hatching. The female broods the chicks for up to seven days after hatching. Fledglings then leave the nest 15 to 20 days after hatching.


Both parents cooperate in raising the young, which they feed a diet consisting almost entirely of insects. Some young stay around the nest to help raise another brood. Fledglings are grayish in color, with speckled breasts. The blue color becomes much more prominent and the speckles on their breasts disappear as they mature. Bluebirds may begin breeding the summer after they are hatched.

Eastern bluebirds can live for 6 to 10 years. The longest recorded lifespan for a bluebird is 10 years and five months. However, most bluebirds die within their first year of life. Starvation and freezing are a danger to the young, but most threats come from other animals, including humans. Natural predators of eggs and nestlings can include eastern chipmunks, flying squirrels, American black bears, fire ants, and raccoons. Bluebirds of all ages (including adults) are threatened by rat snakes, Eastern racers, American kestrels, and domestic cats. Introduced species such as European starlings and house sparrows are competitors for nesting sites. Non-nesting adults face predation by all native species of falcons, owls, and most varieties of hawks, particularly those in the genus &quot;Accipiter&quot;. When approached by a predator, the male makes a song-like warning cry. If no male is present, a threatened female will begin to sing, hoping to attract a protective male back to the territory. Both males and females also flick their wings and warble when predators are nearby.

===Food and feeding===
About two thirds of an adult bluebird&#x27;s diet consists of insects and other invertebrates. The remainder is made up of wild fruits or berries. It has a preference for grasshoppers, crickets, katydids, and beetles; and will also eat earthworms, spiders, millipedes, centipedes, sowbugs, and snails.

Bluebirds feed by perching on a high point, such as a branch or fence post, and swooping down to catch insects on or near the ground. The availability of a winter food source will often determine whether or not a bird will migrate. If bluebirds do remain in a region for the winter, they group and seek cover in heavy thickets, orchards, or other areas in which adequate food and cover resources are available.

== Conservation ==
Eastern bluebirds thrived in the 1700s and 1800s. This flourishing is thought to be connected with the activity of settlers. Clearing forests made new habitat available for bluebirds and nesting sites were created in the increasing numbers of apple orchards and in wooden fence posts that eventually rotted. It is believed that bluebirds were most abundant around 1900. However, increasing competition with the invasive species of European starlings (&quot;Sturnus vulgaris&quot;) and house sparrows (&quot;Passer domesticus&quot;) along with loss of farmland began to take a toll on bluebird populations. Along with these, pesticides and scarcity of food during winter compounded to cause the number of bluebirds to fall. A definite drop has been shown to have occurred between 1938 and the late 1970s.

Conservation efforts are seen as early as 1934 when Thomas Musselman created the first bluebird trail by setting up rows of bluebird houses along roads. Also in the 1930s, William Duncan created a bluebird house design and educated others about these birds. In 1964, The National Association for Protection and Propagation of the Purple Martin and Bluebirds of America was founded. After it went out of existence, the Nature Society kept up with conservation work. Lawrence Zeleny&#x27;s 1976 book, &quot;The Bluebird: How You Can Help Its Fight For Survival&quot;, and a &quot;National Geographic&quot; article he wrote helped make the plight of these birds well known. In 1978, the North American Bluebird Society was founded.

If the Bermuda population of bluebirds is considered the product of natural colonization, it has also become highly endangered. Early settlers described individual flocks numbering over 50 birds each flying across the islands, but in the present only 500 individuals are thought to remain. The near-extinction of Bermuda cedar (&quot;Juniperus bermudiana&quot;) forest in the 1940s and 1950s wiped out the majority of natural nesting habitat for bluebirds, leaving it almost completely dependent on artificial nest boxes for breeding. Introduced starlings and house sparrows evict bluebirds from their nests, and introduced great kiskadees (&quot;Pitangus sulphuratus&quot;) feed on juvenile birds. They are also threatened by feral cats and pesticides.

== In culture ==
Bluebirds were popular with early American colonists and associated with the coming of spring. They were referred to as the &#x27;blue robin&#x27; because of their resemblance to the European robin. Bluebirds have been mentioned in the works of many writers including Thoreau&#x27;s writings, Robert Frost&#x27;s &quot;The Last Word of a Bluebird (as told to a child)&quot;, the &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; song from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, the song &quot;Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot; (&quot;Mister Bluebird&#x27;s on my shoulder&quot;) from Disney&#x27;s &quot;Song of the South&quot;, and John Burrough&#x27;s &quot;The Bluebird&quot;. Lawrence Zeleny said that bluebirds represent joy to Americans.

The eastern bluebird is featured prominently on the current obverse of the Bermudian $2 bill.

<text>Hardcore (also known as hardcore techno) is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany in the early 1990s. It is distinguished by faster tempos and a distorted sawtooth kick (160 to 200 BPM or more), the intensity of the kicks and the synthesized bass (in some subgenres), the rhythm and the atmosphere of the themes (sometimes violent), the usage of saturation and experimentation close to that of industrial dance music. It would spawn subgenres such as gabber.

== History ==

=== Early 1970s to early 1980s ===
Hardcore is rooted in the 1970s and early 1980s industrial music, specifically the elements of hard electronic dance music. Groups such as Throbbing Gristle, Coil, Cabaret Voltaire, SPK, Foetus and Einstürzende Neubauten produced music using a wide range of electronic instruments. The message diffused by industrial was then very provocative. Some of the musical sounds and experimentation of industrial have directly influenced hardcore since the beginning of the movement.

=== 1980s ===
In the mid-1980s, under the influence of the Belgian group Front 242, electronic body music (EBM), a new genre more accessible and more dancing inspired by industrial and new wave, appeared. This style is characterized by minimalism, cold sounds unlike disco, funk or house, with powerful beats, generally combined with aggressive vocals and an aesthetic close to industrial or punk music. Under the influence of New Beat, another Belgian genre and acid house, EBM music became harder. All the elements were present for the arrival of hardcore. The beginnings of the genre, they are traced at the very end of the 1980s in Belgium, within the new beat scene with the titles : &quot;Rock to the Beat&quot; by 101 released in 1988, &quot;Saigon Nightmare&quot; by 101 released in 1988, &quot;Warbeat&quot; by Bassline Boys released in 1989, &quot;I Want You!&quot; by The Concrete Beat released in 1989, &quot;I Love You&quot; by The Acid Kids released in 1988, &quot;Doughnut Dollies&quot; by released in 1988, &quot;Action in Paradise&quot; by Export released in 1988, &quot;Acid New-Beat&quot; by Tribe 22 released in 1988, &quot;I Sit On Acid&quot; by Lords Of Acid released in 1988, &quot;Acid Rock&quot; by Rhythm Device released in 1989, &quot;Double B&quot; by Dirty Harry released in 1989, &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot; by Bingo! released in 1989, &quot;Europe&quot; by Christine D released in 1989, &quot;Do That Dance&quot; by The Project released in 1990, in 1988 the Belgian new beat arrived in Frankfurt in West Germany.
The term hardcore is not new in the music world. It was first used to designate a more radical movement within punk rock (Black Flag, Minor Threat, Bad Brains...) which, in addition to hardening the music, also attached importance to their attitude and their way of life as in the street where it was born: violent, underground, but engaged and sincere. The term has then been reused when hip hop emerged in the late 1980s, designating the harder part of the hip hop, with the same characteristics: a harder sound, engaged lyrics and a whole way of life dedicated to the respect of the values shown by rappers like KRS-One or Public Enemy. The term &quot;hardcore techno&quot; has first been used by EBM groups like , Pankow, and Leæther Strip in the late 1980s, although their music had nothing to do with hardcore. &#x27;s &quot;Sucking Energy (Hard Core Mix)&quot;, released in 1985, was the first track ever to use the term hardcore, within an EDM context.

=== 1990s ===
In 1990, German producer Marc Trauner (also known as Mescalinum United) released the first hardcore techno track with &quot;We Have Arrived&quot;. The British group Together released its track &quot;Hardcore Uproar&quot;, also in 1990. Music journalist Simon Reynolds has written books on hardcore techno, covering bands related to the Belgium hardcore scene like Second Phase and T99 or Dutch hardcore bands such as L.A. Style and Human Resource. Many of the iconic &quot;stabs&quot; that would become part of hardcore were popularized by these and other Belgian techno producers during the early 1990s, like the &quot;Mentasm&quot; and the &quot;Anastasia&quot; stabs.

In the early 1990s, the terms &quot;hardcore&quot; and &quot;darkcore&quot; were also used to designate some primitive forms of breakbeat and drum and bass which were very popular in England and from which have emerged several famous producers like the Prodigy, Altern-8 and Goldie. It introduced sped up hip-hop breakbeats, piano breaks, dub and low frequency basslines and cartoon-like noises, which has been retrospectively called &#x27;old skool&#x27; hardcore (a.k.a. breakbeat hardcore) and is widely regarded as the progenitor of happy hardcore (which later lost the breakbeats) and jungle (which alternatively lost the techno style keyboard stabs and piano breaks).
An important event in the popularization of the genre occurred with the release of the 1990 track &quot;We Have Arrived&quot; by the German producer Mescalinum United, of Frankfurt. Trauner founded the label Planet Core Productions in 1989 and has produced more than 500 tracks, including 300 by himself until 1996. Another important project of Trauner was PCP, popularizing a slow, heavy, minimal and very dark form of hardcore that is now designated as &quot;darkcore&quot; or &quot;doomcore&quot;.

In the United States, the New York pioneer of techno Lenny Dee launched the first dedicated hardcore record label Industrial Strength Records in 1991 that has federated a large part of the American scene, making New York one of the biggest centers of early American hardcore. Other American producers on the label included Deadly Buda and the Horrorist, but the label has also produced producers from other nationalities. At the same time in Rotterdam, the DJs and producers Paul Elstak and Rob Fabrie popularized a speedier style, with saturated bass-lines, quickly known as &quot;gabber&quot;, and its more commercial and accessible form, happy hardcore.

Paul Elstak founded Rotterdam Records in 1992, which became the first hardcore label in the Netherlands. In 1992 at Utrecht, a large rave called The Final Exam led to the creation of the label ID&amp;T. Launched in 1993, the concept of Thunderdome quickly popularized hardcore music in Europe with a catalogue of CD compilations and events, attracting thousands of young people that launched the gabber movement. Just during the single year of 1993, four compilations were released with increasing success. Many artists on the compilations have become well-known figures in the scene, notably 3 Steps Ahead, DJ Buzz Fuzz, The Dreamteam, Neophyte, Omar Santana, and Charly Lownoise and Mental Theo in the gabber/happy hardcore registry. The same year, the label Mokum Records was created by Freddy B who had success with artists and groups like Technohead Tellurian, the Speedfreak, Scott Brown, and the Belgian musician Liza N&#x27;Eliaz, pioneer of speedcore.

Around 1993, the style became clearly defined and was simply named &quot;hardcore&quot;, as it left its influences from Detroit techno.

In England, the members of the sound system Spiral Tribe, including Stormcore, 69db, Crystal Distortion and Curley hardened their acid-breakbeat sound, becoming the pioneers of the &quot;acidcore&quot; and &quot;hardtechno&quot; genres. In 1994, they founded the label Network 23 which among others has produced Somatic Responses, Caustic Visions and Unit Moebius, establishing the musical and visual basis of the free party rave. 
Hardcore/Gabber clubs in Belgium, DJ Yves was resident DJ at &quot;Club X&quot; in Wuustwezel and from the Hardcore room of the &quot;Cherry Moon&quot; in Lokeren, DJ Bass (DHT) was resident DJ of the Hardcore room of &quot;Temple Of House La Bush&quot; in Esquelmes (Pecq) and of &quot;La Florida&quot; in La Glanerie (Rumes) which is next to the &quot;Complexe Cap&#x27;tain&quot;. Thunderdome in Belgium was organized at the Antwerps Sportpaleis and in clubs such as the &quot;Planet Hardcore&quot; (Club) in Dendermonde 3 April 1994, the &quot;Extreme&quot; in Affligem on 16 December 1994, the &quot;Club X&quot; in Wuustwezel on 7 June 1996 and 13 September 1996, the &quot;Cherry Moon&quot; in Lokeren on 31 October 1997.

In France, the pioneers of hardcore include Laurent Hô and Liza &#x27;N&#x27; Eliaz. The French hardcore scene later went on to develop into frenchcore.

In the late 1990s, hardcore progressively changed as gabber waned in popularity. This left a place for other hardcore-influenced styles like mákina and hardstyle.

=== 2000s ===
Under the influence of Hardstyle and industrial hardcore, a new scene was developing featuring DJ Promo and his label The Third Movement. This scene now known as mainstream hardcore emerged in the early 2000s with a modern, mature, slower, and sophisticated form. It was successful in Europe, especially in Netherlands and Italy, with producers and groups like Endymion, Kasparov, Art of Fighters, The Stunned Guys and DJ Mad Dog. Happy hardcore continues its movement underground and has evolved bringing out other related genres such as Eurobeat, UK hardcore, Freeform hardcore and Full-on Hardcore.

Labels such as Enzyme Records, Crossbones and Bloc 46 have produced darkcore artists, like Ruffneck, Fifth Era and The Outside Agency.

As the free party movement was successful in all the Europe, freetekno appeared. Numerous producers and labels emerged representing the hard techno and the frenchcore genres: Epileptik, Audiogenic, Les Enfants Sages, Tekita, Breakteam, Mackitek, B2K and Narkotek.

Meanwhile, in 2001, Norwegian DJ duo Thomas S. Nilsen Fiction and Steffen Ojala Søderholm began to develop the nightcore genre influenced by pitch-shifted vocals in German group Scooter&#x27;s songs &quot;Nessaja&quot; and &quot;Ramp! (The Logical Song)&quot;. Nightcore artists started appearing on services such as LimeWire in mid-2003, and YouTube in 2006.

=== 2010s ===

The early 2010s saw the rise of hardcore internationally, with artists such as Angerfist gaining popularity quickly. The hardcore scene thrived during this period with many new producers and labels making their mark on the scene, both in Europe and the rest of the world, appearing even at North America&#x27;s biggest music festival, Electric Daisy Carnival. In 2011, Angerfist entered the DJ Mag Top 100 at position No. 39.

The middle of the decade saw a shift in popularity, from mainstream hardcore to faster styles such as frenchcore, uptempo hardcore and terrorcore. Although these styles existed previously already, an increase in artists and events around 2015 helped these styles develop and move to the forefront of the audience&#x27;s attention. The shift from the older range of 160–180 beats per minute to 200+ changed the hardcore market, creating a demand for more energetic and intense hardcore than before. Artists like Sefa &amp; Dr. Peacock saw a quick rise within the scene and influenced the musical direction to a louder, faster, but more melodic and euphoric style. Major artists from other genres such as Marshmello, Carnage, Porter Robinson and Headhunterz started to occasionally play faster hardcore in their sets.

The end of the decade saw rapid growth of the hardcore scene in Europe. Hardcore festivals within the Netherlands saw a significant rise in attendance. 2019&#x27;s edition of Thunderdome reached an attendance of almost 40,000 people and became the biggest hardcore event to ever take place. Regular large scale events hardcore started happening outside of the Netherlands in countries like Spain, Russia, Austria, Switzerland and the Czech Republic among other European countries. In America hardcore remains a relatively underground genre, but can be found in major cities being pushed by independent promoters and artists.

==Hard dance==
Hard dance is an umbrella category of electronic dance music genres characterized by fast tempos and hard kick drums, but less harsh-sounding and often a bit slower than hardcore. The category includes hard house, hard trance, hardstyle, some forms of Eurodance and regional genres, such as mákina, lento violento and others. Sometimes the category has crossovers with hardcore genres such as frenchcore or UK hardcore. Despite this, the category is sometimes referred to as synonymous with hardcore techno music generally.

<text>An Indian summer is a period of unseasonably warm, dry weather that sometimes occurs in autumn in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. Several sources describe a true Indian summer as not occurring until after the first frost, or more specifically the first &quot;killing frost&quot;.

==Etymology==
The late 19th-century lexicographer Albert Matthews made an exhaustive search of early American literature in an attempt to discover who coined the expression. The earliest reference he found dated to 1851. He also found the phrase in a letter written in England in 1778, but discounted that as a coincidental use of the phrase.

Later research showed that the earliest known reference to Indian summer in its current sense occurs in an essay written in the United States around 1778 by J. Hector St. John de Crevecœur, describing the character of autumn and implying the common usage of the expression

The essay was first published in French around 1788, but remained unavailable in the United States until the 1920s.
Although the exact origins of the term are uncertain, it was perhaps so-called because it was first noted in regions inhabited by Native Americans, or because the natives first described it to Europeans, or it had been based on the warm and hazy conditions in autumn when Native Americans hunted. John James Audubon wrote about &quot;The &quot;Indian Summer&quot; that extraordinary phenomenon of North America&quot; in his journal on November 20, 1820. He mentions the &quot;constant &quot;Smoky&quot; atmosphere&quot; and how the smoke irritates his eyes. Audubon suspects that the condition of the air was caused by &quot;Indians, firing the Prairies of the West&quot;. Audubon also mentions in many other places in his writings the reliance Native Americans had on fire. At no point does Audubon relate an Indian summer to warm temperatures during the cold seasons.

Because the warm weather is not a permanent gift, a connection has been made to the pejorative term Indian giver. Native-American legends mention the god or &quot;Life-Giver&quot; bestowing warm autumnal weather to various warriors or peoples, enabling them to survive after great misfortune, such as loss of crops.

==Usage==

Weather historian William R. Deedler wrote that &quot;Indian summer&quot; can be defined as &quot;any spell of warm, quiet, hazy weather that may occur in October or November&quot;, though he noted that he &quot;was surprised to read that Indian summers have been given credit for warm spells as late as December and January&quot;. Deedler also noted that some writers use Indian summer in reference to the weather in only New England, &quot;while others have stated it happens over most of the United States, even along the Pacific coast&quot;.

In literature and history, the term is sometimes used metaphorically. The title of Van Wyck Brooks&#x27; &quot;New England: Indian Summer&quot; (1940) suggests an era of inconsistency, infertility, and depleted capabilities, a period of seemingly robust strength that is only an imitation of an earlier season of actual strength. William Dean Howells&#x27; 1886 novel &quot;Indian Summer&quot; uses the term to mean a time when one may recover some of the happiness of youth. The main character, jilted as a young man, leads a solitary life until he rediscovers romance in early middle age.

In British English, the term is used in the same way as in North America. In the UK it was first used in the early 19th century, there was an early example in &quot;The Guardian&quot; which ran an article explaining the phrase &quot;Indian summer&quot; to its readers in 1837, written by someone who had lived in the US but questioned whether Native Americans had influenced the origins. The UK Met Office &quot;Meteorological Glossary&quot; published in 1916 defines an Indian summer &quot;a warm, calm spell of weather occurring in autumn, especially in October and November&quot;, while &quot;The Indian Summer of a Forsyte&quot; is the metaphorical title of the 1918 second volume of &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; by John Galsworthy. However, early 20th-century climatologists Gordon Manley and Hubert Lamb used it only when referring to the American phenomenon, and the expression did not gain wide currency in Great Britain until the 1950s. In former times, variations of &quot;Saint Martin&#x27;s summer&quot; were widely used across Europe to describe warm weather surrounding autumn feast days of St. Martin and Saint Luke.

In the English translation of Boris Pasternak&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, the term is used to describe the unseasonably warm weather leading up to the October Revolution.

==Other names and similar phenomena==
Similar weather conditions with local variations also exist. A warm period in autumn is called (&quot;old women&#x27;s summer&quot;) in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Lithuania, Hungary (), Estonia (), and in a number of Slavic-language countries—for example, in the Czech Republic, Ukraine, Poland, Slovakia, Russia and Slovenia, – it is known as &quot;(old) women&#x27;s summer&quot; (; ; , , ; ; ). In Bulgaria, it is known as &quot;gypsy summer&quot; or &quot;poor man&#x27;s summer&quot;, and in Serbia it is known as &quot;Miholjsko leto&quot; because Saint Michael or &quot;Miholjdan&quot; is celebrated on October 12. In Sweden, there&#x27;s &quot;Brittsommar&quot; (out of &quot;Birgitta&quot; and &quot;Britta&quot;, having their name days around the time, on October 7) and/or &quot;Indiansommar&quot; as a direct translation from English. In Finland, the period is today called , a direct translation, but historically a warm period in autumn was named after Bartholomew ( or &quot;Perttu&quot;), his saint day being in late August. In Irish, the phenomenon is called (&quot;little autumn of the geese&quot;). In Spain is also known as (&quot;little summer of the quince tree&quot;) or (&quot;the sun of the quince tree&quot;).

In temperate parts of South America—such as southernmost Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay—the phenomenon is known as &quot;Veranico&quot;, &quot;Veranito&quot; or &quot;Veranillo&quot; (literally, &quot;little summer&quot;), and usually occurs in early autumn, between late April and mid-May, when it is known as &quot;Veranico de Maio&quot; (&quot;May&#x27;s little summer&quot;) or as &quot;Veranito de San Juan&quot; (&quot;Saint John&#x27;s little summer&quot;). Its onset and duration are directly associated with the occurrence of El Niño.

In other countries, it is associated with autumnal name days or saint days, such as Teresa of Ávila (Portugal, Spain and France), St. Martin&#x27;s Summer (Spain, France, Italy, Portugal and Malta), St. Michael&#x27;s summer ( in Spain, , Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina), St. Martin&#x27;s Day (Netherlands and Italy), St. Demetrius (Greece and Cyprus), Bridget of Sweden in Sweden, and Saint Michael the Archangel in Wales (). In Turkey, it is called , meaning &quot;pastrami summer&quot;, since the month of November was considered to be the best time to make (the meat that, though slightly different, pastrami originated from).

The American Meteorological Society (AMS) also notes that a similar phenomenon may be referred to poetically as halcyon days, a term that originated in Greek mythology. Halcyon days in Greece take place in winter, usually 16–31 of January and last around 4–7 days with extremely warm and sunny days. &quot;All-hallown summer&quot; or &quot;All Saints&#x27; summer&quot; is also referenced in English folklore and by Shakespeare, but its use appears to have died out.

<doc id="351264" wikidata="Q2364255" url="?curid=351264" title="SCUM Manifesto">
<text>SCUM Manifesto is a self-published manifesto by American radical feminist Valerie Solanas. Published in 1967, it argues that men have ruined the world, and that it is up to women to fix it. To achieve this goal, it suggests the formation of SCUM, an organization dedicated to overthrowing society and eliminating the male sex. The &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; has been described as a satire or parody, especially due to its parallels with Freud&#x27;s theory of femininity, though this has been disputed, even by Solanas herself.

The term &quot;SCUM&quot; appeared on the cover of the first edition from Olympia Press, as &quot;S.C.U.M.&quot; and was said to stand for &quot;Society for Cutting Up Men&quot;. Solanas objected, insisting that it was not an acronym, although the expanded term appeared in a &quot;Village Voice&quot; ad she had written in 1967.

The &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; was little-known until Solanas attempted to murder Andy Warhol in 1968. This event brought significant public attention to the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; and Solanas herself.

== Publication history ==
Solanas wrote &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; between 1966 and 1967. In 1967, she self-published the first edition by making two thousand mimeographed copies and selling them on the streets of Greenwich Village in New York City. Solanas charged women one dollar and men two dollars each. By the following spring, about 400 copies had been sold. Solanas signed a publishing contract with Maurice Girodias in August 1967 for a novel and asked him to accept the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; in its place later that year.

The first commercial edition of the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; was published by Olympia Press in New York City in 1968. It includes a preface by Maurice Girodias and an essay titled &quot;Wonder Waif Meets Super Neuter&quot; by Paul Krassner. According to Jansen, there are subtle differences between the 1968 Olympia Press edition and Solanas&#x27; original mimeographed version. In an interview with &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Solanas commented on the Olympia Press edition, complaining that &quot;&quot;none&quot; of the corrections ... [she] wanted made were included and that many other changes in wording were made—all for the worse—and that there were many &#x27;typographical errors&#x27;: words and even extended parts of sentences left out, rendering the passages they should&#x27;ve been in incoherent.&quot; In 1977, Solanas self-published a &quot;correct&quot; edition which was closer to the original version and included an introduction written by her. The 1998 French edition, republished by 1001 Nuits in 2005, includes a preface written by the French novelist Michel Houellebecq.

The &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; has been reprinted at least 10 times in English and translated into Croatian, Czech, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Portuguese, Dutch, and Danish. It has also been excerpted in several feminist anthologies, including &quot;Sisterhood Is Powerful&quot; (1970), a collection of radical feminist writing edited by Robin Morgan. Verso Books published an edition in 2004 with an introduction by feminist philosopher Avital Ronell. Jon Purkis and James Bowen describe the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; as a &quot;pamphlet which has become one of the longest surviving perennials of anarchist publishing&quot;.

Solanas&#x27; sister, Judith A. Solanas Martinez, is the reported copyright holder of the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; by 1997 renewal.

== Contents ==
The &quot;Manifesto&quot; opens with the following declaration:

Solanas begins by presenting a theory of the male as an &quot;incomplete female&quot; who is genetically deficient due to the Y chromosome. According to Solanas, this genetic deficiency causes the male to be emotionally limited, egocentric, and incapable of mental passion or genuine interaction. She describes the male as lacking empathy and unable to relate to anything apart from his own physical sensations. 

The &quot;Manifesto&quot; continues by arguing that the male spends his life attempting to become female, and thereby overcome his inferiority. He does this by &quot;constantly seeking out, fraternizing with and trying to live through and fuse with the female&quot;. Solanas rejects Freud&#x27;s theory of penis envy, and argues that men have &quot;pussy envy&quot;. Solanas then accuses men of turning the world into a &quot;shitpile&quot; and presents a long list of grievances.

The bulk of the &quot;Manifesto&quot; consists of a list of critiques of the male sex. They are divided into the following sections:
* War
* Niceness, Politeness and &quot;Dignity&quot;
* Money, Marriage and Prostitution, Work and Prevention of an Automated Society
* Fatherhood and Mental Illness (fear, cowardice, timidity, humility, insecurity, passivity)
* Suppression of Individuality, Animalism (domesticity and motherhood) and Functionalism
* Prevention of Privacy
* Isolation, Suburbs and Prevention of Community
* Conformity
* Authority and Government
* Philosophy, Religion and Morality Based on Sex
* Prejudice (racial, ethnic, religious, etc.)
* Competition, Prestige, Status, Formal Education, Ignorance and Social and Economic Classes
* Prevention of Conversation
* Prevention of Friendship and Love
* &quot;Great Art&quot; and &quot;Culture&quot;
* Sexuality
* Boredom
* Secrecy, Censorship, Suppression of Knowledge and Ideas, and Exposés
* Distrust
* Ugliness
* Hate and Violence
* Disease and Death

Due to the aforementioned grievances, the &quot;Manifesto&quot; concludes that the elimination of the male sex is a moral imperative. It argues that women must replace the &quot;money-work system&quot; with a system of complete automation, as this will lead to the collapse of the government and the loss of men&#x27;s power over women.

In order to accomplish these goals, the &quot;Manifesto&quot; proposes that a revolutionary vanguard of women be formed. This vanguard is referred to as SCUM. The &quot;Manifesto&quot; argues that SCUM should employ sabotage and direct action tactics rather than civil disobedience, as civil disobedience is only useful for making small changes to society. In order to destroy the system, violent action is necessary: &quot;If SCUM ever marches, it will be over the President&#x27;s stupid, sickening face; if SCUM ever strikes, it will be in the dark with a six-inch blade.&quot;

The &quot;Manifesto&quot; ends by describing a female-dominated utopian future with, eventually, no men. There would be no money, and disease and death would have been eliminated. It argues that men are irrational to defend the current system and should accept the necessity of their destruction.

== Reception and criticism ==
Various critics, scholars, and journalists have analyzed the &quot;Manifesto&quot; and Solanas&#x27; statements regarding it. Prof. James Martin Harding said she a &quot;radical program&quot;. Prof. Dana Heller said the author had an &quot;anarchic social vision&quot; and the &quot;Manifesto&quot; had &quot;near-utopian theories&quot; and a &quot;utopian vision of a world in which mechanization and systems of mass (re)production would render work, sexual intercourse, and the money system obsolete.&quot; 

According to &quot;Village Voice&quot; reviewer B. Ruby Rich, &quot;SCUM was an uncompromising global vision&quot; that criticized men for many faults including war and not curing disease; many but not all points were &quot;quite accurate&quot;; some kinds of women were also criticized, subject to women&#x27;s changing when men are not around; and sex (as in sexuality) was criticized as &quot;exploitative&quot;. According to Janet Lyon, the &quot;Manifesto&quot; &quot;pitt[ed] ... &#x27;liberated&#x27; women ... against &#x27;brainwashed&#x27; women&quot;.

Feminist critic Germaine Greer said that Solanas argued that both genders were separated from their humanity and that men want to be like women. Historian Alice Echols says the &quot;Manifesto&quot; articulates gender as absolute rather than relative.

Heller argued that the &quot;Manifesto&quot; shows women&#x27;s separation from basic economic and cultural resources and, because of psychological subordination to men, women&#x27;s perpetuation of that separation. Robert Marmorstein of the &quot;Voice&quot; said that SCUM&#x27;s main message included that &quot;men have fouled up the world&quot; and &quot;are no longer necessary (even biologically)&quot;. Jansen said Solanas considered men &quot;biological[ly] inferior&quot;. According to Laura Winkiel, the &quot;Manifesto&quot; wants heterosexual capitalism overthrown and the means of production taken over by women. Rich and Jansen said that technology and science would be welcome in the future.

Jansen describes the plan for creating a women&#x27;s world as mainly nonviolent, as based on women&#x27;s nonparticipation in the current economy and having nothing to do with any men, thereby overwhelming police and military forces. If solidarity among women was insufficient, some women could take jobs and &quot;unwork&quot;, causing systemic collapse; and describes the plan as anticipating that by eliminating money, there&#x27;d be no further need to kill men. Jansen and Winkiel say that Solanas imagined a women-only world. 

&quot;Daily News&quot; reporters Frank Faso and Henry Lee, two days after Solanas shot Warhol, said Solanas &quot;crusades for a one-sex world free of men&quot;. Winkiel says the &quot;Manifesto&quot; imagines a violent revolutionary coup by women. Prof. Ginette Castro found the &quot;Manifesto&quot; was &quot;the feminist charter on violence&quot;, supporting terrorist hysteria. According to Jansen, Solanas posited men as animals who will be stalked and killed as prey, the killers using weapons as &quot;phallic symbols turned &quot;against&quot; men&quot;. 

Rich, Castro, reviewer Claire Dederer, Friedan, Prof. Debra Diane Davis, Deborah Siegel, Winkiel, Marmorstein, and Greer said that Solanas&#x27; plan was largely to eliminate men, including by men murdering each other. Rich thought it might be Swiftian satire and that men&#x27;s retraining was an alternative in the &quot;Manifesto&quot;. Castro did not take the elimination of men as serious, and Marmorstein included criminal sabotage of men.

According to Jansen, it called for reproduction only of females, and not even of females once the problems of aging and death were solved so that a next generation would no longer be needed. According to Lyon, the &quot;Manifesto&quot; is irreverent and witty, according to Siegel the &quot;Manifesto&quot; &quot;articulated bald female rage&quot; and Jansen says the &quot;Manifesto&quot; is &quot;shocking&quot; and breathtaking. Rich described Solanas as a &quot;one-woman scorched-earth squad&quot; and Siegel says the stance was &quot;extreme&quot; and &quot;reflected a more general disaffection with nonviolent protest in America overall.&quot; 

Rich says the &quot;Manifesto&quot; brought out women&#x27;s &quot;despair and anger&quot; and advanced feminism. According to Winkiel, radical feminism in the United States emerged because of this &quot;declaration of war against capitalism and patriarchy&quot;. Heller suggests the &quot;Manifesto&quot; is chiefly socialist-materialist. and people associated with Andy Warhol (whom she shot) and various media saw it as &quot;man-hating&quot;.

Echols argues that the misandry displayed in the manifesto was not typical for radical feminists of the time: &quot;Solanas&#x27;s unabashed misandry—especially her belief in men&#x27;s biological inferiority—her endorsement of relationships between &#x27;independent women,&#x27; and her dismissal of sex as &#x27;the refuge of the mindless&#x27; contravened the sort of radical feminism which prevailed in most women&#x27;s groups across the country.&quot;

=== As parody and satire ===
Laura Winkiel, an associate professor of English at the University of Colorado at Boulder, argues that the &quot;SCUM manifesto parodies the performance of patriarchal social order it refuses&quot;. Winkiel further suggests that the manifesto is &quot;an illicit performance, a mockery of the &#x27;serious&#x27; speech acts of patriarchy&quot;. The SCUM women mock the way in which certain men run the world and legitimize their power, Winkiel contends. Similarly, sociologist Ginette Castro states: If we examine the text more closely, we see that its analysis of patriarchal reality is a parody [...] The content itself is unquestionably a parody of the Freudian theory of femininity, where the word woman is replaced by man [...] All the cliches of Freudian psychoanalytical theory are here: the biological accident, the incomplete sex, &quot;penis envy&quot; which has become &quot;pussy envy,&quot; and so forth [...] Here we have a case of absurdity being used as a literary device to expose an absurdity, that is, the absurd theory which has been used to give &quot;scientific&quot; legitimacy to patriarchy [...] What about her proposal that men should quite simply be eliminated, as a way of clearing the dead weight of misogyny and masculinity? This is the inevitable conclusion of the feminist pamphlet, in the same way that Jonathan Swift&#x27;s proposal that Irish children (as useless mouths) should be fed to the swine was the logical conclusion of his bitter satirical pamphlet protesting famine in Ireland. Neither of the two proposals is meant to be taken seriously, and each belongs to the realm of political fiction, or even science fiction, written in a desperate effort to arouse public consciousness.

Writer Chavisa Woods presents a similar opinion: &quot;The SCUM Manifesto is a masterwork of literary protest art, which is often completely misread. Much of it is actually a point-by-point re-write of multiple of Freud&#x27;s writings. It is a parody.&quot; James Penner reads the manifesto as a satirical text. He states, &quot;Like other feminist satires, the &#x27;SCUM Manifesto&#x27; attempts to politicize women by attacking particular masculine myths that are embedded in American popular culture.&quot; He adds, &quot;As a work of satire, the &#x27;SCUM Manifesto&#x27; is rhetorically effective in that it deconstructs the reader&#x27;s received notions of masculinity and femininity.&quot; 

English professor Carl Singleton notes the &quot;outrageous nature&quot; of the manifesto and Solanas&#x27; increasing mental instability, which, he argues, led many people to trivialize the text. Singleton adds, &quot;Others saw the document as a form of political satire in the style of Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot;.&quot; Similarly, Jansen compared it to &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot;, describing it as having &quot;satiric brilliance&quot; and calling Solanas &quot;cool and mordantly funny&quot;. The bulletin of the Project of Transnational Studies echoes the comparison to Jonathan Swift, stating, &quot;A more common strategy is to read &quot;SCUM&quot; as an instance of political fiction or parody in the vein of Jonathan Swift.&quot; 

Writing for &quot;Spin&quot; in September 1996, Charles Aaron calls the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; a &quot;riotous, pre-feminist satire&quot;. Film director Mary Harron called the manifesto a &quot;brilliant satire&quot; and described its tone as &quot;very funny&quot;. According to Rich of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, the work possibly was &quot;satire&quot; and could be read as &quot;literal or symbolic&quot;. Winkiel said, &quot;The humor and anger of satire invites women to produce this feminist script by taking on the roles of the politically performative SCUM females.&quot; Paul Krassner, who was a personal acquaintance of Solanas, called the manifesto a &quot;dittoed document of pathological proselytization with occasional overtones of unintentional satire&quot;.

Solanas&#x27; first publisher, Maurice Girodias, thought of it as &quot;a joke&quot; and described the manifesto, according to J. Hoberman, as &quot;a Swiftian satire on the depraved behavior, genetic inferiority, and ultimate disposability of the male gender&quot;.

According to a 1968 article in the &quot;Daily News&quot;, &quot;those who profess to know Valerie say she isn&#x27;t joking ... [but] that deep down she likes men.&quot; In 1968, speaking to Marmorstein, she characterized herself on the SCUM thing as dead serious. Alexandra DeMonte, however, argues that Solanas &quot;later claimed that her manifesto was simply a satire&quot;.

== SCUM organization ==
Solanas organized &quot;a public forum on SCUM&quot; at which about 40 people, mostly men she characterized as &quot;creeps&quot; and &quot;masochists&quot;, showed up. SCUM had no members besides her. According to Greer, &quot;little evidence [existed] that S.C.U.M. ever functioned&quot; other than as Solanas.

In a 1977 interview for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Solanas stated that SCUM was &quot;just a literary device. There&#x27;s no organization called SCUM—there never was, and there never will be.&quot; Solanas said that she &quot;thought of it as a state of mind ... [in that] women who think a certain way are in SCUM ... [and] [m]en who think a certain way are in the men&#x27;s auxiliary of SCUM.&quot;

== SCUM as acronym ==
The phrase &quot;Society for Cutting Up Men&quot; is on the cover of the 1967 self-published edition, after the title. This edition precedes all commercial editions. Additionally, in the August 10, 1967, issue of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, a letter to the editor appears that was signed by a Valerie Solanas (of SCUM, West 23rd Street) that responds to a previous letter signed by a Ruth Herschberger (published in the August 3, 1967, issue) that asks why women do not rebel against men. Solanas&#x27; response reads: &quot;I would like to inform her and other proud, independent, females like her of the existence of SCUM (Society for Cutting Up Men), a recently conceived organization which will be getting into high gear (and I mean high) within a few weeks.&quot;

Although &quot;SCUM&quot; originally stood for &quot;Society for Cutting Up Men&quot;, this phrase actually occurs nowhere in the text. Heller argued that &quot;there is no reliable evidence that Solanas intended SCUM to stand as an acronym for &#x27;Society for Cutting Up Men&#x27;.&quot; Susan Ware &quot;et al.&quot; state that it was Solanas&#x27; publisher Girodias who claimed that SCUM was an acronym for &quot;Society for Cutting Up Men&quot;, something Solanas never seems to have intended. Gary Dexter contends that Solanas called it the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; without periods after the letters of &quot;SCUM&quot;. Dexter adds: &quot;The spelling out of her coded title by Girodias was one more act of patriarchal intervention, an attempt to possess.&quot;

The word &quot;SCUM&quot; is used in the text in reference to a certain type of women, not to men. It refers to empowered women, &quot;SCUM - dominant, secure, self-confident, nasty, violent, selfish, independent, proud, thrill-seeking, free-wheeling, arrogant females, who consider themselves fit to rule the universe, who have free-wheeled to the limits of this &#x27;society&#x27; and are ready to wheel on to something far beyond what it has to offer&quot;. According to Avitel Ronell, that &quot;SCUM&quot; was intended as an acronym was a &quot;belated add-on&quot;, which Solanas later rejected.

== Influence ==
The &quot;Manifesto&quot;, according to Lyon, is &quot;notorious and influential&quot; and was &quot;one of the earliest ... [and] one of the most radical&quot; tracts produced by &quot;various strands of the American women&#x27;s liberation movement&quot;. Lyon said that &quot;by 1969 it had become a kind of bible&quot; for Cell 16, in Boston. According to a 2012 article by Arthur Goldwag on the Southern Poverty Law Center Hatewatch blog, &quot;Solanas continues to be much-read and quoted in some feminist circles.&quot; Whether the &quot;Manifesto&quot; should be considered a feminist classic is challenged by Heller because the &quot;Manifesto&quot; rejected a hierarchy of greatness, but she said it &quot;remains an influential feminist text.&quot;

=== Women and shooting ===
Laura Winkiel argues that Solanas&#x27; shooting of Andy Warhol and Mario Amaya was directly tied to the &quot;Manifesto&quot;. After shooting Warhol, Solanas told a reporter, &quot;Read my manifesto and it will tell you what I am.&quot; Heller, however, states that Solanas &quot;intended no connection between the manifesto and the shooting&quot;. Harding suggests that &quot;there is no clear indication in Solanas&#x27; ambiguous statement to reporters that the contents of the manifesto would explain the specifics of her actions, at least not in the sense of providing a script for them.&quot; Harding views the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; as an &quot;extension, not the source, of performative acts, even a violent one act like the shooting of Warhol.&quot;

Winkiel argues that revolutionary Roxanne Dunbar moved to the U.S. &quot;convinced that a women&#x27;s revolution had begun&quot;, forming Cell 16 with a program based on the &quot;Manifesto&quot;. According to Winkiel, although Solanas was &quot;outraged&quot; at the women&#x27;s movement&#x27;s &quot;appropriat[ion]&quot; of the &quot;Manifesto&quot;, &quot;the shooting [of Warhol] represented the feminist movement&#x27;s righteous rage against patriarchy&quot;. 

Dunbar and Ti-Grace Atkinson considered the &quot;Manifesto&quot; as having initiated a &quot;revolutionary movement&quot;. Atkinson (according to Rich) called Solanas the &quot;&#x27;first outstanding champion of women&#x27;s rights&#x27;&quot; and probably (according to Greer) having been &quot;radicalized&quot; by the language of the &quot;Manifesto&quot; to leave the National Organization for Women (NOW), and (according to Winkiel) women organized in support of Solanas. 

Solanas was viewed as too mentally ill and too bound up with Warhol, according to Greer, &quot;for her message to come across unperverted.&quot; According to Prof. Davis, the &quot;Manifesto&quot; was a &quot;forerunner&quot; as a &quot;call to arms among pragmatic American feminists&quot; and was &quot;enjoy[ing] ... wide contemporary appeal&quot;. According to Winkiel, the &quot;Manifesto&quot; &quot;was ... influential in the spread of &#x27;womansculture&#x27; and lesbian separatism&quot; and is also &quot;credited with beginning the antipornography movement.&quot; Friedan opposed the &quot;Manifesto&quot; as bad for the feminist movement and NOW.

=== Film ===
&quot;Scum Manifesto&quot; was adapted into a 1976 short film directed by Carole Roussopoulos and Delphine Seyrig. In the film, Seyrig reads several passages from a French translation of Solanas&#x27;s manifesto.

Warhol later satirized the whole event in a subsequent movie, &quot;Women in Revolt&quot;, calling a group similar to Solanas&#x27;s S.C.U.M., &quot;P.I.G.&quot; (Politically Involved Girlies).

Solanas&#x27;s creative work and relationship with Warhol is depicted in the 1996 film, &quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot;, a significant portion of which relates to the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot;, and Solanas&#x27;s disputes on notions of authorship with Warhol.

=== Television ===
&quot;Viva Los Muertos!&quot;, an episode of the animated comedy TV series &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot;, features a character named Val who directly quotes the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; throughout the episode.

The SCUM manifesto was presented as a plot device in the FX television series &quot;American Horror Story: Cult&quot;, first seen in the episode &quot;Valerie Solanas Died for Your Sins: Scumbag&quot;, which first aired on October 17, 2017. A fictionalized version of Valerie Solanas, played by the actress Lena Dunham, recited the manifesto throughout the episode.

=== Literature ===
The title story of the Michael Blumlein short story collection, &quot;The Brains of Rats&quot;, employs the &quot;Manifesto&quot; to illustrate the male protagonist&#x27;s hatred of himself and his gender.

In 2006, Swedish author Sara Stridsberg published a semi-fictional biography of Valerie Solanas, &quot;Drömfakulteten&quot; (The Dream Faculty), in which the &quot;Manifesto&quot; is referred to on several occasions. Parts of the &quot;Manifesto&quot; are also cited in the book.

Nick Cave said that Solanas in the &quot;Manifesto&quot; &quot;talks at length about what she considers maleness and the male psyche ... basically men being halfway between humans and apes, these kind of lumbering lumps of meat, predatory lumps of meat&quot;, and that &quot;it&#x27;s quite wonderful to read ... [and] was an aspect of that I felt rang true.&quot; Cave wrote a novel, &quot;The Death of Bunny Munro&quot;, for which he &quot;invented a character that was Valerie Solanas&#x27;s male incarnate.&quot;

=== Music ===
Solanas is quoted in the sleeve notes of the Manic Street Preachers debut album &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot;. Solanas directly inspired the Manic Street Preachers song &quot;Of Walking Abortion&quot; from their third album &quot;The Holy Bible&quot;, with the song title being taken from Solanas&#x27; work. Liverpool punk band Big in Japan composed the song &quot;Society for Cutting Up Men&quot; directly inspired by the manifesto. 

The Italian progressive rock band Area - International POPular Group devoted a song to Solanas&#x27; manifesto, called SCUM, which appears in their fifth album &quot;Maledetti (Maudits)&quot;. The British band S.C.U.M. was named after the manifesto. On Matmos&#x27; 2006 album &quot;The Rose Has Teeth in the Mouth of a Beast&quot;, one of the tracks is &quot;Tract for Valerie Solanas&quot;, which features excerpts of the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot;. British alternative band Young Knives released a song called &quot;Society for Cutting Up Men&quot; in December 2017.

=== Theatre ===
Alice Birch&#x27;s 2014 feminist play, &quot;Revolt. She Said. Revolt Again.&quot; was inspired by the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot;.

<text>Hoop Dreams is a 1994 American documentary film directed by Steve James, and produced by Frederick Marx, James, and Peter Gilbert, with Kartemquin Films. It follows the story of two African-American high school students, William Gates and Arthur Agee, in Chicago and their dream of becoming professional basketball players.

&quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; was originally intended to be a 30-minute short film produced for PBS; the filming of the special led to five years of filming and 250 hours of footage. &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; premiered at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Audience Award for Best Documentary. It won numerous other awards in the 1994 season, although it was not nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, which led to a massive public outcry. Despite its length (171 minutes) and unlikely commercial genre, it received high critical and popular acclaim, and grossed over $11 million worldwide.

&quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; was ranked #1 on the Current TV special &quot;50 Documentaries to See Before You Die&quot;. In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The International Documentary Association&#x27;s members ranked &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; as the best documentary of all time in 2007.

==Synopsis==
In 1987, William Gates and Arthur Agee, two African-American teenagers, are recruited by a scout from St. Joseph High School in Westchester, Illinois, a predominantly White high school with an outstanding basketball program. The team is led by Gene Pingatore, who coached National Basketball Association (NBA) Hall of Fame player Isiah Thomas when Thomas played at St. Joseph. Agee and Gates are both from poor African-American neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois: Gates lives in the Cabrini–Green projects, while Agee and his family reside in West Garfield Park. Both boys face 90-minute commutes to the school each way.

In their freshman year, Gates starts on the varsity team at St. Joseph and helps them win the sectional title, earning a mention from &quot;The Sportswriters on TV&quot; as possibly &quot;the next Isiah Thomas&quot;, although St. Joseph is eliminated in the super-sectionals in a narrow loss to St. Francis de Sales High School. Meanwhile, Agee plays on the freshman team and struggles both on the court and in the classroom.

At the end of the year, Agee is kicked out of St. Joseph as his family is unable to pay his tuition; Gates&#x27;s fees are covered by his sponsor, the president of Encyclopedia Britannica, who also helps him find a white collar summer job. Agee&#x27;s rejection from St. Joseph damages his self-confidence, and he plays poorly for the high school team at John Marshall High School, coached by Luther Bedford. In his sophomore year, Gates again starts on the varsity team. St. Joseph is eliminated by Gordon Tech in the sectional finals, and Gates struggles with the weight of expectations from his brother, Curtis, who was a talented player in his own right but never made it to the pros and has now transferred his unfulfilled aspirations onto his younger brother.

In their junior year, both boys face challenges. Gates suffers a knee injury that requires surgery and months of rehabilitation, while Arthur&#x27;s mother, Sheila, loses her job and the family goes on welfare as Arthur&#x27;s father, Bo, has walked out and become addicted to drugs. Bo later gives up drugs and returns to the family, and Sheila earns a nursing degree. During this time, the Agee household takes in Arthur&#x27;s close friend, Shannon, who is escaping an abusive household.

On the court, Agee and John Marshall improve on their poor sophomore year record, including winning an upset victory over Dunbar Vocational High School. St. Joseph makes it to the sectional finals, where they once again face Gordon Tech. Gates plays timidly because of his injury. At the end of the fourth quarter, with seconds on the clock and trailing by one, St. Joseph wins two free throws. Gates—normally a clutch free throw shooter—steps up to take them, but he misses both and St. Joseph are knocked out of the play-offs.

Despite his injury, Gates is courted by many college basketball programs, especially Marquette University, and attends the Nike All-America summer camp at Princeton before his senior year (where Dick Vitale and Spike Lee make appearances). After returning from camp, Gates signs a letter of intent with Marquette, though he struggles to meet the minimum ACT test score to be eligible for an athletic scholarship. Meanwhile, Arthur, playing high school basketball in the Chicago Public High School League, attracts far less attention from college recruiters, although a couple of junior colleges show interest in him.

In Gates&#x27;s senior year, St. Joseph&#x27;s season concludes early in a second-round play-off loss against Nazareth Academy, ending his hopes of &quot;going downstate&quot; for the state championship. Gates had been benched by Coach Pingatore at the start of the game for arriving late. John Marshall goes on an unlikely run through the city championship, largely thanks to Agee&#x27;s excellent play. The team makes it to the state championship in Champaign, finishing third in the state after a semi-final loss to Manual High School.

At the end of the film, Gates has entered Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Agee is attending Mineral Area College in Park Hills, Missouri and still hoping to play for the NBA.

==Production==
===Development===
The initial idea for &quot;a film about the culture of basketball in the black community&quot; came to director Steve James, an amateur basketball player himself, in 1985 while watching basketball at the recreation center at Southern Illinois University. James reached out to his friend Frederick Marx, then in China teaching English, who liked the idea. The two agreed that both of them would produce the film, James would direct, and Marx would edit. James thought of the title &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; very early in the development process; they also briefly considered calling it &quot;Hoopin″&quot;.

In 1987, James received a $2,000 fellowship grant from the Illinois Arts Council to work on the film. James and Marx then pitched their idea to Gordon Quinn of Kartemquin Films. Initially, they planned to focus on a single playground for a 30-minute documentary they hoped would be aired on PBS. Quinn liked the idea and agreed to take the project on. Unable to raise any money besides James&#x27;s grant, the pair decided to shoot on video instead of film (an unusual choice for the time), and they hired Peter Gilbert to do cinematography as he had his own gear.

===Filming===
The filmmakers contacted coach Gene Pingatore of St. Joseph High School as he had coached Chicago native Isiah Thomas in high school. Pingatore introduced them to &quot;Big Earl&quot; Smith, a talent scout who was familiar with the inner-city playgrounds that the filmmakers wanted to shoot on. Smith brought them to several playgrounds, and at one of them he spotted a young Arthur Agee as a promising player. Agee agreed to be part of the film, and Smith helped arrange for him to attend Coach Pingatore&#x27;s summer camp, where Thomas would be making an appearance.

When the filmmakers interviewed Pingatore about Agee, he said it was too early to tell about him, but mentioned that another kid, William Gates, could be &quot;the next Isiah Thomas&quot;. James, Marx, and Gilbert decided to include Gates in their film as well, and began to consider expanding the scope of their original vision.

For two years, the three filmmakers continued to shoot intermittently and send demos out without raising any additional money. KTCA, a public television channel in Minnesota, heard about the film, and pledged $60,000, plus another $70,000 from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, to fund an hour-long film. While continuing to search for more funds, the filmmakers considered other ideas, including a segment on a female high school player and a comedy sketch starring Tim Meadows.

With limited financial backing, James, Marx, and Gilbert could only manage 22 days of filming for the entire first two years, and each of the filmmakers worked on other projects at times during the filming of &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot;. By continuing to include Agee even after he was dropped from St. Joseph, they won the trust of him and his family, and the filmmakers began to delve deeper into the personal lives of the boys. At one point, the electricity was turned off in the Agee home; the filmmakers continued filming and (off-camera) provided money for the lights to be turned back on.

The filmmakers shot another 40 days during the boys&#x27; junior year. James was able to leverage a relationship with the vice president of the MacArthur Foundation into a $250,000 grant for the film, which allowed them to shoot 100 days from the end of junior year to the end of the film. By the end of filming, they had captured 250 hours of footage.

===Post-production===
&quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; spent three years in editing, during which it was cut down from a first assemblage of more than 10 hours, to a six-hour version, to a rough cut that they showed the boys, their families, and Coach Pingatore. Per their original agreement, Marx handled the editing, but after two years he asked James and William Haugse to step in to help him. James and Haugse spent another year and a half editing. By the spring of 1993, they had a cut ready and began to consider releasing it in theaters.

==Release==
&quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; premiered at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Audience Award for Best Documentary. It ran on the closing night of the 1994 New York Film Festival, the first time a documentary film had ever closed the festival. The filmmakers had previously had to turn down an appearance at the 1993 edition of the festival as the film was not yet ready. Its appearance at Sundance helped it secure a distribution deal with Fine Line Features, and the film opened nationwide on October 21, 1994. It grossed $7.8 million domestically and $4 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $11.8 million.

==Reception==
The film was widely acclaimed by critics. Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film &quot;Two Very Enthusiastic Thumbs Up&quot; on their show, with both critics naming &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; the best film of 1994. Ebert in his initial television review proclaimed &quot;This is one of the best films about American life that I have &quot;ever&quot; seen&quot;, and later called it the best film of the decade and &quot;one of the great moviegoing experiences of my lifetime.&quot; In 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the film on its &quot;Best 1000 Movies Ever&quot; list. The film has a 98% approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes, based on 62 reviews with an average rating of 8.8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;One of the most critically acclaimed documentaries of all time, &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; is a rich, complex, heartbreaking, and ultimately deeply rewarding film that uses high school hoops as a jumping-off point to explore issues of race, class, and education in modern America.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 98 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

In 2024, &quot;Looper&quot; ranked it number 2 on its list of the &quot;50 Best PG-13 Movies of All Time,&quot; writing &quot;Don&#x27;t be intimidated by the 170-minute runtime of &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot;. Though a lengthy commitment, this project from director Steve James is undeniably rewarding as a cinematic experience.&quot;

The film was ranked #1 on the International Documentary Association&#x27;s Top 25 Documentaries list, based on polling of members in 2007. It was also ranked #1 on the Current TV special &quot;50 Documentaries to See Before You Die&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and recommended for preservation.

== Academy Awards controversy ==
Ira Deutchman, who helped distribute the film with Fine Line, advocated for the film to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. When the film, along with the equally acclaimed &quot;Crumb&quot; a year later, was not nominated in either the Best Picture or the Best Documentary categories, public outcry led to a revised nomination process in the category, led by Oscar-winning documentarian Barbara Kopple. According to Roger Ebert, reliable sources said members of the Academy&#x27;s documentary nomination committee had a system in which one would wave a flashlight on screen when they gave up on the film. When a majority of the lights flashed, the film was turned off. &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; was watched, but the nomination system at the time was based on total points earned when voters gave ratings from 4 to 10 for each documentary. A group of voters gave the lowest possible rating to &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; and other films. The flashlight system was ended, and the rating scale was reduced. Siskel, while also objecting to &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; being passed by for the nomination, said that it led to more widespread media coverage of the film.

In response to the controversy, Bruce Davis, the Academy&#x27;s executive director, asked accounting firm Price Waterhouse to turn over the voting results, in which each voter had given a rating from zero to ten to each of the eligible documentaries. According to Davis, &quot;a small group of members gave zeros to every single film except the five they wanted to see nominated. And they gave tens to those five, which completely skewed the voting... There was one film that received more scores of ten than any other, but it was not nominated. It also got zeros from those few voters, and that was enough to push it to sixth place.&quot;

==Legacy==
Neither Agee nor Gates were drafted into the NBA. Nonetheless, both young men were able to turn the film&#x27;s success and their subsequent fame into a better life for themselves and their families. Gates played three seasons of college basketball at Marquette University before quitting the program, but he graduated from the university in 1999 with a communications degree. Agee went on to play at Arkansas State and later in the United States Basketball League and the International Basketball Association. The producers gave both Gates and Agee almost $200,000 in royalties from the film, although they were barred from accepting the money until after college due to National Collegiate Athletic Association rules. In 2001, Gates practiced with Michael Jordan ahead of a tryout with the Washington Wizards, but he fractured his foot and decided to retire from basketball permanently.

Agee, the younger of the two basketball players, launched a foundation promoting higher education for inner-city youth and began the &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; sportswear line in 2006. Gates became the senior pastor at Living Faith Community Center in Cabrini–Green, where he worked at the Kids&#x27; Club. The families of both men have experienced losses since the release of the film. Agee&#x27;s half-brother DeAntonio was killed on Thanksgiving morning 1994, and Gates&#x27;s older brother, Curtis, was shot to death in Chicago Lawn in September 2001. Agee&#x27;s father, Bo, was murdered in 2004.

=== Unofficial sequel ===
An unofficial sequel not made by the original filmmakers, Hoop Reality (2007), explores what happened during the decade after &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot;. Patrick Beverley from Chicago&#x27;s West Side appears as a struggling potential star also at John Marshall Metropolitan High School and is mentored by Agee and basketball coach Lamont Bryant. Beverley entered the 2009 NBA draft, and was selected with the 42nd overall pick by the Los Angeles Lakers.

==20th anniversary restoration==
A digital restoration of the film, created by a partnership of the Sundance Institute, UCLA Film and Television Archive, the Academy Film Archive and Kartemquin Films, premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival for the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary. The restoration used the original analog video masters to create a high-definition digital master that was higher-quality than the cropped and transferred version that was released commercially. The Criterion Collection released the restored &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; Blu-ray on March 31, 2015.

<doc id="351267" wikidata="Q1334471" url="?curid=351267" title="Mr. Mister">
<text>Mr. Mister was an American rock band from Phoenix, Arizona, active from 1982 until 1990. The band consisted of Richard Page on lead vocals and bass guitar, Steve George on keyboards/backing vocals, Pat Mastelotto on acoustic and electronic drums/percussion and Steve Farris on guitars/backing vocals. Mr. Mister was the successor to the band Pages, fronted by Page and George from 1978 to 1981.

==Early work==
Although formed in Phoenix, Arizona, United States, Mr. Mister was based in Los Angeles, California. Richard Page had previously worked as a session musician (for Quincy Jones) and had composed for Michael Jackson, Rick Springfield, Donna Summer, Kenny Loggins, Al Jarreau, and many more.

In 1978, Page and his childhood friend Steve George founded the band Pages in Phoenix, Arizona. Pages explored a pop fusion sound, with a changing lineup of session musicians. Although Pages had a minor hit single with &quot;I Do Believe in You&quot;, and its three albums garnered favorable reviews, the group had little commercial success. After disbanding Pages in 1981, Page and George focused on songwriting and studio session work for pop artists ranging from Laura Branigan to Village People.

By 1982, Page and George began putting together a more pop-oriented group with a permanent lineup, rounded out by drummer Pat Mastelotto and guitarist Steve Farris. All four members had done extensive session work for other artists and brought numerous influences to the band. The initial plan was to bring in a fifth member, a bass guitarist, but after realizing that Page, who was originally slated to be solely the lead singer, could also play bass, the members decided to remain a four-piece.

==Mainstream success==
When the first Mr. Mister album, &quot;I Wear the Face&quot;, was released by RCA Records in 1984, Page was offered the chance to replace Bobby Kimball as lead singer of Toto, and later was offered Peter Cetera&#x27;s place in Chicago; he refused both offers.

Their second album, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to the Real World&quot;—with lyrics from Page&#x27;s cousin John Lang—was the breakthrough for Mr. Mister. All three singles were in the top 10, two of which hit No. 1 on the U.S. pop charts—&quot;Broken Wings&quot; and &quot;Kyrie&quot;. The former was inspired by the book of the same title by Kahlil Gibran. They had several No. 1 MTV videos, and performed at the first &quot;MTV Spring Break&quot; show in 1986. That year, Mr. Mister had two Grammy Award nominations, including Best Pop Band (which was awarded to the &quot;We Are the World&quot; ensemble, USA for Africa).

During this time, Mr. Mister toured with other popular acts including Don Henley, The Bangles, Eurythmics, Tina Turner, Heart, and Adam Ant. The band&#x27;s third album was &quot;Go On...&quot;, which was not a large commercial success, and delivered only one top 40 hit in the U.S.

During the 1980s, the group wrote and/or performed songs for several movies, including the title song for &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;, and &quot;Is It Love&quot; as the outro track for &quot;Stakeout&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Slow Down&quot; appeared in &quot;A Fine Mess&quot;. The band also made concert appearances with the pop rock band the Bangles.

Guitarist Steve Farris left in 1988. The remaining band members teamed up with Christian recording artist Paul Clark and acted as his backup band for Clark&#x27;s 1988 indie release &quot;Awakening from the Western Dream&quot;. Next, the band began working on a fourth album, &quot;Pull&quot;, with session guitarists Buzz Feiten, Trevor Rabin, Doug Macaskill and Peter McRea. The album was completed in 1990, but RCA Records decided not to release it. Soon afterwards, the band broke up. The album remained unreleased for 20 years, although one track (&quot;Waiting in My Dreams&quot;) appeared on a 2001 greatest hits collection by the band. On November 23, 2010, the remastered album was finally released by the band, in collaboration with Sony Music, on Richard Page&#x27;s independent label, Little Dume Recordings.

Long after their dissolution, the band was referred to in the song &quot;Hey, Soul Sister&quot; by Train, with the line &quot;Ain&#x27;t that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?&quot;

On May 16, 2023 (Richard Page&#x27;s 70th birthday), all four members of Mr. Mister performed &quot;Broken Wings&quot; together, their first performance together in over 34 years.

<text>A sacred language, liturgical language or holy language is a language that is cultivated and used primarily for religious reasons (like church service) by people who speak another, primary language in their daily lives.

Some religions, or parts of them, regard the language of their sacred texts as in itself sacred. These include Latin in Roman Catholicism, Hebrew in Judaism, Arabic in Islam and Sanskrit in Hinduism, and Punjabi in Sikhism. By contrast Christian denominations outside of Catholicism and Buddhism do not generally regard their sacred languages as sacred in themselves. Akkadian was a long used liturgical language.

==Concept==

A sacred language is often the language which was spoken and written in the society in which a religion&#x27;s sacred texts were first set down; these texts thereafter become fixed and holy, remaining frozen and immune to later linguistic developments. (An exception to this is Lucumí, a ritual lexicon of the Cuban strain of the Santería religion, with no standardized form.)

Once a language becomes associated with religious worship, its believers may ascribe virtues to the language of worship that they would not give to their native tongues. In the case of sacred texts, there is a fear of losing authenticity and accuracy by a translation or re-translation, and difficulties in achieving acceptance for a new version of a text. A sacred language is typically vested with a solemnity and dignity that the vernacular lacks. Consequently, the training of clergy in the use of a sacred language becomes an important cultural investment, and their use of the tongue is perceived to give them access to a body of knowledge that untrained laypeople cannot (or should not) access.

Because sacred languages are ascribed with virtues that the vernacular is not seen to have, these typically preserve characteristics lost in the course of language development. In some cases, the sacred language is a dead language, while in others, it may simply reflect archaic forms of a living language. For instance, 17th-century elements of the English language remain current in Protestant Christian worship through the use of the &quot;King James Bible&quot; from 1611, or older versions of the Anglican &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. In more extreme cases, the language has changed so much from the language of the sacred texts that the liturgy is barely comprehensible without special training. For example, the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church remained in Latin after the Council of Tours in 813 ordered preaching in local Romance or German, because Latin was no longer understood. Similarly, Old Church Slavonic is incomprehensible to speakers of modern Slavic languages, unless they study it.

Sacred languages are distinct from divine languages, which are languages ascribed to the divine (i.e. God or gods) and may not necessarily be natural languages. The concept, as expressed by the name of a script, for example in &quot;Dēvanāgarī&quot;, the name of a script that roughly means &quot;[script] of the city of gods&quot;, and is used to write many Indian languages.

==Buddhism==
When the Buddha&#x27;s sutras were first written down, probably in Pali, there were around 20 schools, each with their own version derived from the original. The present Pāli Canon originates from the Tamrashatiya school. The Chinese and Tibetan canons mainly derive from the Sarvastivada, originally written in Sanskrit, of which fragments remain. The texts were translated into Chinese and Tibetan.

Theravada Buddhism uses Pali as its main liturgical language and prefers that scripture be studied in the original Pali. Pali is derived from Sanskrit. In Thailand, Pali is transliterated into the Thai alphabet, resulting in a Thai pronunciation of the Pali language. Something similar also happens in Myanmar, where Pali is also transliterated into the Burmese alphabet, also resulting in a Burmese pronunciation of Pali.

Mahayana Buddhism, now only followed by a small minority in South Asia makes little use of its original language, Sanskrit, mostly using versions of the local language. In East Asia, Classical Chinese is mainly used. In Japan, texts are written in Chinese characters and read out or recited with the Japanese pronunciations of their constituent characters.

In Vajrayana Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism is the main surviving school, and Classical Tibetan is the main language used for study, although the Tibetan Buddhist canon was also translated into other languages, such as Mongolian and Manchu. Many items of Sanskrit Buddhist literature have been preserved because they were exported to Tibet, with copies of unknown ancient Sanskrit texts surfacing in Tibet as recently as 2003. Sanskrit was valued in Tibet as the elegant language of the gods. Although in Tibetan Buddhist deity yoga the rest of the sadhana is generally recited in Tibetan, the mantra portion of the practice is usually retained in its original Sanskrit.

In Nepal, the Newar Buddhist form of Vajrayana is a storehouse of ancient Sanskrit Buddhist texts, many of which are now only extant in Nepal. Whatever language is used, Judith Simmer-Brown explains that a tantric Vajrayana text is often written in an obscure twilight language so that it cannot be understood by anyone without the verbal explanation of a qualified teacher.

Old Tamil was used for Sangam epics of Buddhist and Jain philosophy.

==Christianity==

Christian rites, rituals, and ceremonies are not celebrated in one single sacred language. Most churches which trace their origin to the Apostles continue to use the standard languages of the first few centuries AD. Many Christian churches make a distinction between a sacred language, a liturgical language, and a vernacular language. The three most important languages in the early Christian era were Latin, Greek, and Syriac (a dialect of Aramaic).

The Gospel of John notes that the phrase &quot;Jesus, King of the Jews&quot; was inscribed upon the cross of Christ in three different languages, thereby sanctifying them as the first languages to proclaim his divinity. These are:
* Greek, the original language of the New Testament, as well as the Septuagint (a pre-Christian translation of the Hebrew Bible). This was the lingua franca of much of the contemporary Levant. 
* Hebrew, the dominant language of the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible). This was the language commonly used among most Jews in the area.
* Latin, the language of the Roman Empire, which soon became an important language of the Christian Church, especially in the western provinces of the Roman Empire as well as being the language of the &quot;First Among Equals&quot;, the Pope, in the Christian Pentarchy.

Liturgical languages are those which hold precedence within liturgy due to tradition and dispensation. Many of these languages have evolved from languages which were at one point vernacular, while some are intentional constructions by ecclesial authorities. These include:
* Ecclesiastical Latin in the Latin liturgical rites of the Catholic Church.
* (Old) Church Slavonic in several of the autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Churches and &quot;sui iuris&quot; Eastern Catholic Churches
* Koine Greek as well as the liturgical language of the Greek Orthodox Church and the Greek Catholic Church.
* Old Georgian in the Georgian Orthodox Church and the Georgian Byzantine-Rite Catholic Church.
* Classical Armenian in the Armenian Apostolic Church and the Armenian Catholic Church.
* Coptic in the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and Coptic Catholic Church.
* Geʽez in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Eritrean Orthodox Church, Ethiopian Catholic Church and Eritrean Catholic Church.
* Syriac in Syriac Christianity represented by the Syriac Orthodox Church, Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church, Syriac Catholic Church, Maronite Church and Saint Thomas Christian Churches.

The extensive use of Greek in the Roman Liturgy has continued, in theory; it was used extensively on a regular basis during the Papal Mass, which has not been celebrated for some time. By the reign of Pope Damasus I, the continuous use of Greek in the Roman Liturgy had come to be replaced in part by Latin. Gradually, the Roman Liturgy took on more and more Latin until, generally, only a few words of Hebrew (e.g. &quot;Dominus Deus sabaoth) and Greek (e.g. Kyrie eleison&quot;) remained. The adoption of Latin was further fostered when the Vetus Latina (old Latin) version of the Bible was edited and parts retranslated from the original Hebrew and Greek by Saint Jerome in his Vulgate. Latin continued as the western Church&#x27;s language of liturgy and communication.

In the mid-16th century the Council of Trent rejected a proposal to introduce national languages as this was seen, among other reasons, as potentially divisive to Catholic unity.

During the Reformation in England, when the Protestant authorities banned the use of Latin liturgy, various schools obtained a dispensation to continue to use Latin, for educational purposes.

From the end of the 16th century, in coastal Croatia, the local vernacular language began to replace Church Slavonic as the liturgical language. This change occurred because Church Slavonic, which had been used in the Glagolitic liturgical books published in Rome, was becoming increasingly difficult to understand. This difficulty arose from linguistic reforms that adapted the Church Slavonic of Croatian recension used in Croatia to the norms of Church Slavonic used in Russia. For example, the vernacular was used to ask the bride and groom if they accepted their marriage vows.

Jesuit missionaries to China initially obtained permission to translate the Roman Missal into Classical Chinese, a scholarly form of the language. However, this permission was later revoked amid the Chinese Rites controversy. In contrast, among the Algonquin and Iroquois peoples, missionaries were allowed to translate certain parts of the Mass into their native languages.

In the 20th century, Pope Pius XII granted permission for a few vernaculars to be used in a few rites, rituals, and ceremonies. This did not include the Roman Liturgy of the Mass.

The Catholic Church, long before the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II), had accepted and promoted the use of the non-vernacular liturgical languages listed above; while vernacular (i.e. modern or native) languages were also used liturgically throughout history; usually as a special concession given to religious orders conducting missionary activity.

In the 20th century, Vatican II set out to protect the use of Latin as a liturgical language. To a large degree, its prescription was disregarded and the vernacular not only became standard, but was generally used exclusively in the liturgy. Latin remains the chief language of the Latin liturgical rites and of Catholic canon law, but the use of liturgical Latin is now discouraged. The use of vernacular language in liturgical practice after 1964 created controversy, and opposition to liturgical vernacular is a major tenet of the Catholic Traditionalist movement. Meanwhile, the numerous Eastern Catholic Churches in union with Rome each have their own respective parent-language.

Eastern Orthodox churches vary in their use of liturgical languages. Koine Greek and Church Slavonic are the main sacred languages used in communion. Other languages are also permitted for liturgical worship, and each country often has the liturgical services in their own language. This has led to a wide variety of languages used for liturgical worship, but there is still uniformity in the liturgical worship itself.

Liturgical languages used in the Eastern Orthodox Church include (but are not limited to): Koine Greek, Church Slavonic, Romanian, Georgian, Arabic, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Serbian, English, German, Spanish, French, Polish, Portuguese, Italian, Albanian, Finnish, Swedish, Chinese, Estonian, Korean, Japanese, and multiple African languages.

Oriental Orthodox churches outside their ancestral lands regularly pray in the local vernacular, but some clergymen and communities prefer to retain their traditional language or use a combination of languages.

Many Anabaptist groups, such as the Amish, use High German in their worship despite not speaking it amongst themselves.

==Hinduism==
Hinduism is traditionally considered to have Sanskrit as its primary liturgical language.

=== Sanskrit ===
Sanskrit is the language of the Vedas, Bhagavad Gita, Puranas like the Bhagavatam, the Upanishads, the epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata, and various other liturgical texts such as the Sahasranama, Chamakam, and Rudram.

Sanskrit is also the tongue of Hindu rituals. It also has secular literature along with its religious canon. Most Hindu theologians of later centuries continued to prefer to write in Sanskrit even when it was no longer spoken as a day-to-day language. Sanskrit remains as the only liturgical link language which connects the different strains of Hinduism that are present across India. The &quot;de facto&quot; position that Sanskrit enjoyed, as the principal language of Hinduism, enabled its survival not only in India, but also in other areas, where Hinduism thrived like Southeast Asia.

=== Old Tamil ===
Old Tamil is the language of the Shaiva (Devaram) and Vaishnava (Divya Prabhandham) scriptures.

===Early Telugu===
Most of Carnatic Music is in Telugu.
Amaravati Stupa. It is dated to 2nd century BCE and is probably, the name of a stonemason. Its structural and grammatical analysis played a key role in studying Indus script by Iravatham Mahadevan.

Several personal names and place names traceable to Telugu roots are found in various Sanskrit and Prakrit inscriptions of 2nd and 1st centuries BCE.

Many Hindu epics were also composed in Telugu. Some examples are the Amukthamalayada, Basava Purana, Andhra Mahabharatam, and the Ranganatha Ramayanamu.

=== Others ===
Apart from Sanskrit, several Hindu spiritual works were composed in the various regional languages of India such as Hindi, Assamese, Awadhi, Bhojpuri, Bengali, Odia, Maithili, Punjabi, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tulu, as well as Old Javanese, and Balinese of Southeast Asia.

==Islam==
Classical Arabic, or Qur&#x27;anic Arabic, is the language of the Qur&#x27;an. Muslims believe the Qur&#x27;an as divine revelation—it is a sacred and eternal document, and as such it is believed to be the direct word of God. Thus Muslims hold that the Qur&#x27;an is only truly the Qur&#x27;an if it is precisely as it was revealed—i.e., in Classical Arabic. Translations of the Qur&#x27;an into other languages are therefore not treated as the Qur&#x27;an itself; rather, they are seen as interpretive texts, which attempt to communicate a translation of the Qur&#x27;an&#x27;s message. Salah and other rituals are also conducted in Classical Arabic for this reason. Scholars of Islam must learn and interpret the Qur&#x27;an in classical Arabic. According to the four accepted Sunni schools of jurisprudence, it is a requirement for sermons (&quot;khutbah&quot;) to be delivered completely in classical Arabic.

==Judaism==
=== Hebrew ===
The core of the Hebrew Bible is written in Biblical Hebrew, referred to by some Jews as &quot;Lashon Hakodesh&quot; (, &quot;Language of Holiness&quot;). Hebrew (and in the case of a few texts such as the Kaddish, Aramaic) remains the traditional language of Jewish religious services. Rabbinic Hebrew and Aramaic are used extensively by the Orthodox for writing religious texts.

=== Ladino ===
Among the Sephardim, Ladino was used for translations such as the Ferrara Bible. It was also used during the Sephardi liturgy. Ladino is also often referred to as Judeo-Spanish, as it is a dialect of Castilian used by Sephardim as an everyday language until the 20th century.

== List ==

* Early New High German is used in Amish communities for Bible readings and sermons.
* Gothic, the sole East Germanic language which is attested by significant texts, is usually considered to have been preserved by the Arian churches, while the Goths themselves spoke vulgar Latin dialects of their areas. 
* Koine Greek, the language of early Pauline Christianity and all of its New Testament books. It is today the liturgical language of Greek Orthodox Christianity and several other directly Greek connected Eastern Orthodox Churches. It differs markedly from Modern Greek but remains comprehensible for Modern Greek speakers.
* Habla Congo (or &quot;Habla Bantu&quot;) is a Kongo-based liturgical language of the Palo religion with origins in Cuba, later spreading to other countries in the Caribbean Basin.
* Hattic was used by the Hittites who spoke an unrelated language.
* Biblical Hebrew – the languages in which the Hebrew Bible has been written over time; these differ from today&#x27;s spoken Hebrew in lexical and grammatical areas.
* Jamaican Maroon Spirit Possession Language, spoken by Jamaican Maroons, the descendants of runaway slaves in the mountains of Jamaica, during their &quot;Kromanti Play&quot;, a ceremony in which the participants are said to be possessed by their ancestors and to speak as their ancestors did centuries ago.
* Early Middle Japanese is chanted in Shinto rituals.
* Kallawaya, a secret medicinal language used in the Andes.
* Ecclesiastical Latin is the liturgical language of the Latin Church&#x27;s Latin liturgical rites of the Catholic Church. It is based on the Italian pronunciation.

* Pali, the original language of Theravada Buddhism.
* Some Portuguese and Latin prayers are retained by the Kakure Kirishitan (Hidden Christians) of Japan, who recite it without understanding the language.
* Sant Bhasha, a mélange of archaic Punjabi and several other languages, is the language of the Sikh holy scripture Guru Granth Sahib. It is different from the various dialects of Punjabi that exist today.
* Vedic &amp; Classical Sanskrit, the dialects of the Vedas and other sacred texts of Hinduism as well as the original language of several sects of early Buddhism and a language of Jainism.
* Old Church Slavonic, also called Old Bulgarian, the liturgical language of the Slavic Eastern Orthodoxy
* Church Slavonic is the current liturgical language of the Russian Orthodox Church, Serbian Orthodox Church, Bulgarian Orthodox Church and the Macedonian Orthodox Church and certain Byzantine (Ruthenian) Eastern Catholic churches.
* Sumerian, cultivated and preserved in Assyria and Babylon long after its extinction as an everyday language.
* Syriac, a dialect of Aramaic, is used as a liturgical language by Syriac Christians who belong to the Chaldean Catholic Church, Assyrian Church of the East, Syriac Orthodox Church, Syriac Catholic Church, Syro Malabar Catholic Church and Maronite Church.
* Old Tamil is the language of the Shaiva (Devaram) and Vaishnava (Divya Prabhandham) scriptures.
* Classical Tibetan, known as &quot;Chhokey&quot; in Bhutan, the sacred language of Tibetan Buddhism.
* Yoruba (known as Lucumi in Cuba), the language of the Yoruba people, brought to the New World by African slaves, and preserved in Santería, Candomblé, and other transplanted African religions. The Yoruba descendants in these communities, as well as non-descendants that have adopted one of the Yoruba-based religions in the diaspora, no longer speak any of the Yoruba dialects with any level of fluency. And the liturgical usage also reflects the compromise of the language whereby there isn&#x27;t an understanding of correct grammar nor proper intonation. Spirit possession by the Yoruba deities in Cuba shows that the deity manifested in the devotee at a Cuban orisa ceremony delivers messages to the faithful in Bozal, a type of Spanish-based creole with some words of Yoruba language as well as those of Bantu origin with an inflection similar to the way Africans would speak as they were learning Spanish during enslavement.

<text>The western bluebird (Sialia mexicana) is a small North American thrush.

==Taxonomy==
The western bluebird was formally described by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1832 and given the binomial name &quot;Sialia mexicana&quot;.

Six subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;S. m. occidentalis&quot; Townsend, JK, 1837 – southwest Canada to north Baja California (northwest Mexico)
* &quot;S. m. bairdi&quot; Ridgway, 1894 – interior west USA to Sonora and Chihuahua (northwest Mexico)
* &quot;S. m. jacoti&quot; Phillips, AR, 1991 – south central USA and northeast Mexico
* &quot;S. m. amabilis&quot; Moore, RT, 1939 – northcentral Mexico
* &quot;S. m. nelsoni&quot; Phillips, AR, 1991 – central Mexico
* &quot;S. m. mexicana&quot; Swainson, 1832 – south central Mexico

==Description==

The western bluebird is a small stocky bird with a length of . The adult male is bright blue on top and on the throat with an orange breast and sides, a brownish patch on back, and a gray belly and undertail coverts. The adult female has a duller blue body, wings, and tail, a gray throat, a dull orange breast, and a gray belly and undertail coverts. Both sexes have a thin straight bill with a fairly short tail. Immature birds have duller colors than the adults, and have spots on their chest and back.

Their calling consists of the mating songs which sound like &quot;cheer,&quot; &quot;chur-chur,&quot; and &quot;chup.&quot; This helps male western bluebirds find the females easily in condensed forest. The males use these calls to tell competing males that the territory belongs to them.

The western bluebird can be readily distinguished from the two other species in the bluebird genus. The western bluebird has a blue (male) or gray (female) throat, the eastern bluebird (&quot;Sialia sialis&quot;) has an orange throat, and the mountain bluebird (&quot;Sialia currucoides&quot;) lacks orange color anywhere on its body.

==Distribution and habitat==
The western bluebird has been displaced from its natural habitat by the felling of trees; however it has adapted to coniferous forests, farmlands, semi-open terrain, and desert to survive. The year-round range includes California, the southern Rocky Mountains, Arizona, and New Mexico in the United States, and as far south as the states of Oaxaca and Veracruz in Mexico. The summer breeding range extends as far north as the Pacific Northwest, British Columbia, and Montana. Northern birds can migrate to the southern parts of the range; southern birds are often permanent residents.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Breeding===

The western bluebird nests in cavities or in nest boxes, competing with tree swallows, house sparrows, and European starlings for natural nesting locations. Because of the high level of competition, house sparrows often attack western bluebirds for their nests. The attacks are made both in groups or alone. Attacks by starlings can be reduced if the nesting box opening is kept to diameter to avoid takeover. Nest boxes come into effect when the species is limited and dying out due to the following predators: cats, raccoons, opossums, and select birds of prey such as the Cooper&#x27;s hawk. Ants, bees, earwigs, and wasps can crawl into the nesting boxes and damage the newborns. Western bluebirds are among the birds that nest in , or holes in trees, or nest boxes. Their beaks are too weak and small to dig out their own holes, so they rely on woodpeckers to make their nest sites for them.

In restored forests, western bluebirds have a higher probability of successfully fledging young than in untreated forests, but they are at greater risk of parasitic infestations. The effects on post-fledging survival are unknown. They have been found to enjoy more success with nest boxes than in natural cavities. They started egg-laying earlier, had higher nesting success and lower predation rates, and fledged more young in boxes than in cavities, but they did not have larger clutches of eggs. The eggs are commonly two to eight per clutch, with average size . Eggs are oval in shape with a smooth and glossy shell. They are pale blue to bluish-white and sometimes white in color. Nestlings remain in a nest about 19 to 22 days before fledging. In a good year, the parents can rear two broods, with four to six eggs per clutch. According to genetic studies, 45% of western bluebirds&#x27; nests carried young that were not offspring of the male partner. In addition, they help their parents raise a new brood after their own nest fails.

===Food and feeding===
The western bluebird pounces on the ground when looking for food, such as worms and berries. It also flies to catch aerial prey, like insects, when available. The western bluebird consumes water from nearby streams and commonly use bird baths.
These birds wait on a perch and fly down to catch insects, sometimes catching them in midair. They mainly eat insects and berries, and will regularly come to bird feeders if mealworms or other insects are supplied.

<doc id="351276" wikidata="Q322138" url="?curid=351276" title="Indo-Pacific finless porpoise">
<text>The Indo-Pacific finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides) is one of eight porpoise species. The species ranges throughout most of the Indian Ocean, as well as the tropical and subtropical Pacific from Indonesia north to the Taiwan Strait. Overlapping with this species in the Taiwan Strait and replacing it northwards is the East Asian finless porpoise (&quot;N. sunameri&quot;).

== Distribution ==
The Indo-Pacific finless porpoise lives in the coastal waters of Asia, especially around Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and Bangladesh. At the western end, their range includes the length of the western coast of India and continues up into the Persian Gulf. On the eastern edge of their range, they are found throughout the Indonesian archipelago and range north to the Taiwan Strait. Finless porpoises are also one of the species protected at Sundarbans National Park.

== Description ==
Finless porpoises can grow to as much as in length, and can weigh up to , although most are rather smaller. The flippers are moderately large, reaching up to 20% of the total body length. Adults are typically a uniform, light grey colour, although some may have lighter patches of skin around the mouth or darker patches in front of the flippers. Newborn calves of the central and eastern subspecies are mostly black with grey around the dorsal ridge area, becoming fully grey after four to six months. However, newborn calves of the western subspecies are a light creamy grey, and become darker as they age.

Adults grow more than 1.55 m (5 ft) in length and up to 30–45 kg (65–100 lb) in weight.

=== Internal anatomy ===
The anatomy of finless porpoises has been relatively well studied, compared with that of some other cetacean species. For example, the tubercles along the dorsal ridge are known to contain numerous nerve endings that may possess a sensory function. The auditory system also appears well-developed, with numerous large nerve fibres specialised for rapid communication between the ears and the brain. On the other hand, sight is relatively poor, with a reduced lens and a limited number of fibres in the optic nerve and to the muscles moving the eyes.

The skeleton is unusually light, accounting for only 5% of total weight. There are between 58 and 65 vertebrae, about half of them in the tail, and with the first three cervical vertebrae fused into a single structure. There are ten to fourteen pairs of ribs in the chest, and an additional set of vestigial ribs has sometimes been reported in the neck, in association with the seventh cervical vertebra. There are 44 sets of spinal nerves.

The nasal passage contains nine or ten air sacs, which have a complicated structure, and are capable of sealing off all air within the passage. Behind these are an additional set of vomeronasal sacs. The trachea, however, is short, with only four cartilaginous rings. The stomach has three chambers, there is no caecum, and no distinct difference between the small and large intestines.

== Diet ==
Finless porpoises are opportunistic feeders using various kinds of available food items available in their habitat, including fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods. They are reported to eat fish, shrimp and squid off Pakistan. Seasonal changes in their diets have not been studied. They also apparently ingest some plant material when living in estuaries, mangroves, and rivers, including leaves, rice, and eggs deposited on vegetation.

== Behaviour ==
Recent data suggest the basic unit of a finless porpoise pod is a mother/calf pair or two adults, and schools of three or more individuals are aggregations of these units or of solitary individuals. Social structure seems to be underdeveloped in the species, and the mother/calf pair is probably the only stable social unit.

Like other porpoises, their behaviour tends to be not as energetic and showy as that of dolphins. They do not ride bow waves, and in some areas appear to be shy of boats.

Finless porpoises make both high frequency clicking sounds, and longer, low frequency tones, the latter perhaps being for communication, rather than echolocation. The clicks are narrow-band, with peaks of over 100 kHz.

A new study from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) study that was published in &quot;The Journal of Experimental Biology&quot;, &quot;highlights the differences in dolphins&#x27; ability to hear across species, reshaping the previous &#x27;one-size-fits-all&#x27; approach taken on the hearing ability of the cetaceans&quot;.

=== Swimming style ===
Although they show no acrobatics in the water, finless porpoises are believed to be very active swimmers. They typically swim just beneath the surface of the water and roll to one side when surfacing to breathe. This rolling movement disturbs very little water on the surface, so they are often overlooked when rising to breathe. Surfacing generally lasts for one minute, as they take three to four quick successive breaths, then quickly submerge into the water. They often surface a great distance from the point where they dive beneath the water&#x27;s surface. Dives lasting over four minutes have been recorded, and a common pattern of behaviour is to take one long dive, followed by two shorter ones.

=== Reproduction ===
Breeding occurs in late spring and early summer.. The young are born in spring, summer, or winter, depending on the geographic locality, after a gestation period of ten to eleven months. Newborn finless porpoises are reported to in length. Males reach sexual maturity at four to six years of age, and females at six to nine years. Finless porpoises have lived up to 33 years.

It has been claimed that young calves cling to the denticulated area of skin on their mother&#x27;s back and are carried by her as she swims, but there is no clear evidence of this happening. Calves are weaned at 6–15 months.

== Conservation ==
The finless porpoise is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements.

Since this species remains in coastal waters, it has a high degree of interaction with humans, which often puts the finless porpoise at risk. Like other porpoises, large numbers of this species are killed by entanglement in gill nets. The primary danger to the species is environmental degradation. Unlike other members of this family, finless porpoises have lived in captivity for over 15 years.

There are no well-established estimates of the animals&#x27; abundance. However, a comparison of two surveys, one from the late 1970s and the other from 1999–2000, shows a decline in population and distribution. Scientists believe this decline has been ongoing for decades, and the current population is just a fraction of its historical levels. Along the southern coast of Pakistan in the Arabian Sea it is declared as an endangered species.

The WWF Website states that the finless porpoise is Critically endangered. However, it is not the official &#x27;IUCN Endangered Status&#x27;.

<doc id="351284" wikidata="Q1153563" url="?curid=351284" title="Dead man's switch">
<text>A dead man&#x27;s switch is a switch that is designed to be activated or deactivated if the human operator becomes incapacitated, such as through death, loss of consciousness, or being bodily removed from control. Originally applied to switches on a vehicle or machine, it has since come to be used to describe other intangible uses, as in computer software.

These switches are usually used as a form of fail-safe where they stop a machine with no operator from a potentially dangerous action or incapacitate a device as a result of accident, malfunction, or misuse. They are common in such applications as locomotives, aircraft refuelling, freight elevators, lawn mowers, tractors, personal watercraft, outboard motors, chainsaws, snowblowers, treadmills, snowmobiles, amusement rides, and many medical imaging devices. On some machines, these switches merely bring the machines back to a safe state, such as reducing the throttle to idle or applying brakes while leaving the machines still running and ready to resume normal operation once control is reestablished.

Dead man&#x27;s switches are not always used to stop machines and prevent harm; such switches can also be used as a fail-deadly, since a spring-operated switch can be used to complete a circuit, not only to break it. This allows a dead man&#x27;s switch to be used to activate a harmful device, such as a bomb or improvised explosive device. The switch that arms the device is only kept in its &quot;off&quot; position by continued pressure from the user&#x27;s hand. The device will activate when the switch is released, so that if the user is knocked out or killed while holding the switch, the bomb will detonate. The Special Weapons Emergency Separation System is an application of this concept in the field of nuclear weapons. A more extreme version is Russia&#x27;s Dead Hand program, which allows for either automatic or semiautomatic launch of nuclear missiles should a number of conditions be met, even if all Russian leadership were to be killed.

A similar concept is the handwritten letters of last resort from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to the commanding officers of the four British ballistic missile submarines. They contain orders on what action to take if the British government is destroyed in a nuclear attack. After a prime minister leaves office, the letters are destroyed unopened.

This concept has been employed with computer data, where sensitive information has been previously encrypted and released to the public, and the &quot;switch&quot; is the release of the decryption key, as with Vault 7.

A related device is a &quot;kill switch&quot;.

==Background==
Interest in dead man&#x27;s controls increased with the introduction of electric trams (streetcars in North America) and especially electrified rapid transit trains. The first widespread use came with the introduction of the mass-produced Birney One-Man Safety (tram) Car, though dead-man equipment was fairly rare on US streetcars until the successful PCC streetcar, which had a left-foot-operated dead man&#x27;s pedal in conjunction with the right-foot-operated brake and power pedals. This layout has continued to be used on some modern trams around the world. In conventional steam railroad trains, there was always a second person with the engineer, the &quot;fireman&quot;, who could almost always bring the train to a stop if necessary. For many decades, two people were assigned to electric and diesel locomotives as well, even though a single person could theoretically operate them.

With modern urban and suburban railway systems, the driver is typically alone in an enclosed cab. Automatic devices were already beginning to be deployed on newer installations of the New York City Subway system in the early 20th century. The Malbone Street Wreck on the Brooklyn Rapid Transit system in 1918, though not caused by driver incapacitation, did spur the need for universal deployment of such devices to halt trains in the event of the operator&#x27;s disability. According to a Manhattan borough historian, there have been at least three instances where the dead man&#x27;s switch was used successfully – in 1927, 1940, and 2010.

The status and operation of both vigilance and dead man&#x27;s switch may be recorded on the train&#x27;s event recorder (commonly known as a &quot;black box&quot;). Modern locomotive practice is to incorporate the dead-man&#x27;s and vigilance functions under the control of the alerter or the event recorder.

==Types==
===Handle===
Many dead man&#x27;s switches are mounted in the control handle of a vehicle or machine and engage if the operator ever loses their grip.

====Vehicles====
Handle switches are still used on modern trams and trains. Pneumatically or electrically linked dead man&#x27;s controls involve relatively simple modifications of the &quot;controller handle&quot;, the device that regulates traction power. If pressure is not maintained on the controller, the train&#x27;s emergency brakes are applied. Typically, the controller handle is a horizontal bar, rotated to apply the required power for the train. Attached to the bottom of the handle is a rod that when pushed down contacts a solenoid or switch inside the control housing. The handle springs up if pressure is removed, releasing the rod&#x27;s contact with the internal switch, instantly cutting power and applying the brakes.

Though there are ways that this type of dead man&#x27;s control could conceivably fail, in practice they have proven highly reliable. On some earlier equipment, pressure was not maintained on the entire controller, but on a large button protruding from the controller handle. This button also had to be pressed continuously, typically with the palm of the hand so that the button was flush with the top of the handle. Another method used, particularly with some lever-type controllers, which are rotated rather than pushed or pulled, requires that the handle on the lever be turned through 90 degrees and held in that position while the train is in operation. Some dead man&#x27;s controls only work in the mid position and not with full pressure (see pilot valve).

In modern New York City Subway trains, for example, the dead man&#x27;s switch is incorporated into the train&#x27;s speed control. On the R142A car, the train operator must continually hold the lever in place in order for the train to move.

An example of a passenger vehicle using a dead man&#x27;s switch is on Tesla electric vehicles. When the driver has engaged the semi-autonomous driving system &quot;Autopilot&quot;, they must keep their hands on the steering wheel. If the driver takes their hands off the steering wheel for more than 30 seconds, a loud alarm will sound inside the car to wake sleeping drivers; if the driver leaves their hands off for more than a minute, then the car will engage its hazard warning lights and bring the car to a stop. This is done because the Autopilot system is not capable of full-self driving, and requires that the driver be able to take over operation of the vehicle without warning, should the car encounter a problem it does not know how to solve. This system uses a torque sensor on the steering wheel of the vehicle: when a driver is simply holding the wheel, they are still applying a small amount of torque to the wheel, confirming for the car that the driver is being attentive; if the driver turns the wheel with more force, all vehicle controls are handed back to the driver immediately.

====Machinery====
Handle-mounted dead man&#x27;s switches are also used on many hand-held tools and lawn equipment, typically those that rotate or have blades such as saws, drills, snow blowers and lawn mowers. On saws for example, they incorporate a squeeze throttle trigger into the handle. If the user loses grip of the saw, the springs in the throttle trigger will push it back out to the off or idle setting, stopping the blade from spinning. Some tools go further and have a trigger guard built into the handle, similar to firearm safeties. Only when the user presses in the trigger guard first will it then release its lock on the trigger and allow the trigger to be pressed in. Typically, trigger guards can only be pressed in while the user has a firm grip of the handle.

Every walk-behind mower sold in the US since 1982 has a dead man&#x27;s switch called an &quot;operator-presence control&quot;, which by law must stop the blades within three seconds after the user releases the controls. Attached across the handle is a mechanical lever connected by a flexible cable to the kill switch on the engine. While mowing, the operator must always squeeze the lever against the handle. If the operator ever loses grip of the handle, the blade will disengage or the engine will stop, stopping the blades from spinning and (if equipped) any drive wheels from turning. On mowers where the engine stops, this switch configuration also acts as the engine&#x27;s main kill switch; when the operator wants to stop the engine, he can release the dead man&#x27;s switch intentionally.

===Touch sensor===
On some vehicles, including the diesel-electric railway locomotives in Canada, and on Nottingham Express Transit vehicles, the tram&#x27;s speed controller is fitted with a capacitive touch sensor to detect the driver&#x27;s hand. If the hand is removed for more than a short period of time, the track brakes are activated. Gloves, if worn, have to be finger-less for the touch sensor to operate. A backup dead-man&#x27;s switch button is provided on the side of the controller for use in the case of a failed touch sensor or if it is too cold to remove gloves.

===Pedal===

A pedal can be used instead of a handle. While some pedal switches must simply be held down in order for the machine to function (this system is often found on amusement rides, where the operator is likely to remain in a standing position for a lengthy period of time while the ride is in motion), this method has some shortcomings. In the Waterfall train disaster, south of Sydney, Australia, in 2003, the driver suddenly died of a heart attack, and his slumped body kept the pedal depressed.

There are some solutions to this issue that are now used in modern pedal systems. The pedal can have a vigilance function built in (a dead-man&#x27;s vigilance device, driver vigilance device or DVD), where drivers must release and re-press the pedal in response to an audible signal. This prevents it from being defeated by the above circumstances and is a standard feature on most British DSD systems. If the timer period is beginning to expire, a visual and audible warning is given. If the operator fails to acknowledge the warning, a penalty brake application results.

Some types of locomotive are fitted with a three-position pedal, which must normally be kept in the mid position. This lessens the likelihood of accidentally defeating it, although it may still be possible to deliberately do so. Adding a vigilance function to this type of pedal results in a very safe system. However, isolation devices are still provided in case of equipment failure, so a deliberate override is still possible. These isolation devices usually have tamper-evident seals fitted for that reason.

===Seat switches===
The dead man&#x27;s switch can also be located beneath the seat of a vehicle or machine and engages if the operator is not in the seat holding the switch down. On modern tractors, the switch will cut the engine while the transmission is engaged or the power take-off is spinning. On riding lawn mowers, the switch is often more extreme where the switch will cut the engine even if the mower is parked and the blades are not spinning. Seat switches can also be used to keep small children from even starting the vehicle since they would not weigh enough to completely hold down a switch adjusted to an adolescent&#x27;s or adult&#x27;s weight.

===Key switches===
On recreational vehicles such as boats, personal watercraft and snowmobiles, and on the control panel of many amusement rides, the user or operator has a cord or lanyard attached to their wrist or life jacket, that is in turn attached to a key mounted on the dead man&#x27;s switch. Should the rider fall off the vehicle or the operator at least move away from the controls, the cord will be pulled out of the dead man&#x27;s switch, turning off the engine or setting the throttle position to &quot;idle&quot;. On powered boats in particular this cord is often called a &quot;kill cord&quot; (for powered boats use around the wrist is not recommended, as it may slip off without cutting the engine). If the helmsman goes overboard or is forced away from the controls, the engine cuts out. This prevents the boat from continuing under power but out of control, risking injury to anyone in or out of the water including passengers who may have fallen out or may still be in the boat, and collision damage to any property in the path of this out of control boat; this in turn prevents or limits damage to the boat itself from striking other objects. It is a common and dangerous practice to defeat the kill cord by fixing it to part of the boat instead of the operator; for convenience. This has been the cause of accidents, some of which were fatal or caused limb loss.

Some luggage carts at airports and exercise treadmills have this feature. In the case of treadmills, the dead man&#x27;s switch usually consists of an external magnet attached to a cord that clips to the user. If the user falls or walks away without turning off the treadmill, the switch cuts power to the treadmill belt.

In information security, kill cords are also used in computers to turn off the machine if the user is separated from it.

===Altimeter switches===
Strategic Air Command developed a dead man&#x27;s switch for its nuclear bombers, known as Special Weapons Emergency Separation System (SWESS), that ensured the nuclear payload detonated in the event of the crew becoming incapacitated through enemy action. The purpose of this device, unlike other examples mentioned above, was fail-deadly rather than fail-safe. Once armed, the system would detonate the onboard nuclear weapons if the aircraft dropped below a predetermined level, typically due to being shot down.

==Vigilance control==
The main safety failing with the basic dead man&#x27;s system is the possibility of the operating device being held permanently in position, either deliberately or accidentally. Vigilance control was developed to detect this condition by requiring that the dead man&#x27;s device be released momentarily and re-applied at timed intervals. There has also been a proposal to introduce a similar system to automotive cruise controls.

===Software===
Software versions of dead man&#x27;s switches are generally only used by people with technical expertise, and can serve several purposes, such as sending a stored message, a notification to friends, or deleting and encrypting data. The &quot;non-event&quot; triggering these can be almost anything, such as failing to log in for 7 consecutive days, not responding to an automated e-mail, ping, a GPS-enabled telephone not moving for a period of time, or merely failing to type a code within a few minutes of a computer&#x27;s boot. An example of a software-based dead man&#x27;s switch is one that starts when the computer boots up and can encrypt or delete user-specified data if an unauthorized user should ever gain access to the protected computer. Google&#x27;s Inactive Account Manager allows the account holder to nominate someone else to access their services if not used for an extended period (the default is three months). Some solutions available to the public utilize the growing market of mobile devices. Instead of sending an automated e-mail, they will send a push notification directly to the mobile device, and can alert family and friends in a much more convenient way.

===Spacecraft===
Many spacecraft use a form of dead man&#x27;s switch to guard against command system failures. A timer is established that is normally reset by the receipt of any valid command (including one whose sole function is to reset the timer). If the timer expires, the spacecraft enters a &quot;command loss&quot; algorithm that cycles through a predefined sequence of hardware or software modes (such as the selection of a backup command receiver) until a valid command is received. The spacecraft may also enter a safe mode to protect itself while waiting for further commands.

While having some similarities to a dead man&#x27;s switch, this type of device (a command-loss timer) is not actually a dead man&#x27;s switch, because it aims to recover from a hardware failure rather than the absence of human operators. It is generally called a watchdog timer, and is also used extensively in nuclear power control systems. System components on a spacecraft that put it into a safe mode or cause it to execute default behaviors when no command is received within a predefined time window can be considered a dead man&#x27;s switch, but hardware or software that attempts to receive a command from human operators through an alternate channel is an auto-recovering or adaptive communications system, not a dead man&#x27;s switch. Voyager 2 recovered from a command receiver failure with a command-loss timer.

===Train===
In most trains, a basic level of protection is provided by a &quot;dead man&#x27;s handle&quot; or pedal. If the driver is taken ill and releases this, the power will be shut off and an emergency brake application will be initiated to stop the train.

More recent safety standards do not consider this to be adequate, as the driver may slump over the dead man&#x27;s handle and continue to hold it down even though they are not capable of controlling the train. Modern trains overcome this risk with the addition of a vigilance system to the dead man&#x27;s system. A buzzer or bell sounds every minute or so in order to alert the motorman or engineer. If they do not respond by moving a controller, or releasing and then re-applying the dead man&#x27;s handle, the system will automatically initiate an emergency brake application. Most major rail systems in the world use this equipment, both in their freight and passenger operations. It is also used on the R143 and other New York City Subway cars while under CBTC operation. In the US, older locomotives produced before 1995 did not originally carry this feature, but given the modular nature of the system it is not uncommon to find them retrofitted.

===Aircraft===
Some aeroplanes use vigilance control to minimize hypoxia, descending to lower altitude if the pilot is unresponsive.

In 2019, the Garmin G3000 became the first general aviation avionics suite capable of automatically diverting an aircraft to the nearest airport and landing it in the event a pilot fails to interact with the aircraft&#x27;s controls or respond to system prompts. This automation capability has been made possible by advancements in computing, control, and navigation technologies and is of particular importance in a general aviation setting since private aircraft are often flown by only a single pilot.

==Blackmail==
The term &quot;dead man&#x27;s switch&quot; is sometimes used to describe a form of defensive blackmail or insurance file in which the release of damaging material is threatened if anything happens to a person.

<doc id="351286" wikidata="Q6199547" url="?curid=351286" title="Jimmy Austin">
<text>James Phillip Austin (December 8, 1879 – March 6, 1965) was a Welsh professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as a third baseman for the New York Highlanders and St. Louis Browns from 1909 through 1923, 1925 through 1926, and 1929. He also managed the Browns in 1913, 1918, and 1923.

==Early years==
Austin was born in Swansea, Wales, the son of a shipbuilder. He was one of only three Major League Baseball players to be born in Wales (the others being pitcher Ted Lewis and infielder Peter Morris). His father moved to the United States in 1885 to find work, and Austin followed in 1887. He did not see a baseball game until he was 14 years old.

After leaving school in 1889, Austin became an apprentice machinist with Westinghouse. After finishing his four-year apprenticeship, Westinghouse went on strike. Austin took up an offer of $40 a month ($), plus a job, to play independent ball in Warren, Ohio. He returned to Westinghouse that fall, but in the spring of , he signed with the Central League&#x27;s Dayton, Ohio club.

==Professional baseball==
Austin remained in Dayton until , when he was sold to Omaha in the Western League. He stole 97 bases for Omaha in , and at the end of the season was sold to the New York Highlanders of the American League. He made his major league debut in at the relatively advanced age (for baseball) of 29. That year, Austin became immortalized in the Charles M. Conlon photo as the third baseman trying to avoid Ty Cobb&#x27;s spikes on a stolen base. Of the play, Austin said, &quot;That&#x27;s Cobb sliding into third and the other guy is me.&quot;
He played two seasons in New York, but was traded to the St. Louis Browns in by new Highlanders manager Hal Chase, thus beginning a thirty-year career with the Browns as player and coach.

In , when the Browns&#x27; player-manager George Stovall was suspended by the American League for spitting at an umpire, Austin was made manager on a temporary basis, until he was replaced by the legendary Branch Rickey. It was Rickey&#x27;s first managerial job. Austin continued as Rickey&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Manager&quot; – Rickey had promised his mother that he would not enter a ballpark on the Christian Sabbath, and therefore Austin managed the Browns on those days.

Austin played regularly for the Browns until , and served as a coach for another 20 years. Unfortunately, the Browns during this period were rarely ever in the first division, so his team won no pennants during his playing career. The Browns did however finish the 1922 season in second place, one game behind the New York Yankees. Austin did also have the great fortune of either playing for or coaching baseball greats Branch Rickey, George Sisler, and Rogers Hornsby. In , at the age of 49, Austin became one of the oldest major leaguers in history when he was inserted into a blowout. He cleanly handled two chances at third base, and struck out in his only at bat.

==Later life==
Austin spent 16 seasons as a coach for the Browns and Chicago White Sox during an 18-year span that ended in 1940. After his coaching career ended, Austin retired and moved to Laguna Beach, California, and served as the town&#x27;s mayor during the 1940s.

Austin was one of the ballplayers who told his story in Lawrence Ritter&#x27;s classic 1966 book, &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot;, from which much of the information in this article came.

<doc id="351287" wikidata="Q339340" url="?curid=351287" title="Ogee">
<text>An ogee ( ) is an object, element, or curve—often seen in architecture and building trades—that has a serpentine- or extended S-shape (sigmoid). Ogees consist of a &quot;double curve&quot;, the combination of two semicircular curves or arcs that, as a result of a point of inflection from concave to convex or &quot;vice versa&quot;, have ends of the overall curve that point in opposite directions (and have tangents that are approximately parallel).
First seen in textiles in the 12th century, the use of ogee elements—in particular, in the design of arches—has been said to characterise various Gothic and Gothic Revival architectural styles. The shape has many such uses in architecture from those periods to the present day, including in the ogee arch in these architectural styles, where two ogees oriented as mirror images compose the sides of the arch, and in decorative molding designs, where single ogees are common profiles (see opening image). The term is also used in marine construction. The word was sometimes abbreviated as o-g as early as the 18th century, and in millwork trades associated with building construction, ogee is still sometimes written similarly (e.g., as O.G.).

==Use in architecture==
===Ogee arch===
 In architecture, the principal use of the term is to describe an arch composed of two ogees, mirrored left-to-right and meeting at an apex. First seen in textiles in the 1100s AD, the use of ogee elements, and in particular in the design of arches, has been said to characterise Venetian Gothic and Gothic Revival architectural styles. Ogee arches were also a feature of English Gothic architecture in the later thirteenth century.

===Moulding===
A building&#x27;s surface detailing, inside and outside, often includes decorative moulding, and these often contain ogee-shaped profiles—consisting (from low to high) of a arc flowing into a arc, with vertical ends; if the lower curve is convex and higher one concave, this is known as a Roman ogee, although frequently the terms are used interchangeably and for a variety of other shapes. Alternative names for such a Roman ogee moulding include &quot;cyma reversa&quot; and &quot;talon&quot;.
The ogee curve is an analogue of a &quot;cyma curve&quot;, the difference being that a cyma, or &quot;cyma recta&quot;, has horizontal rather than vertical ends. The cyma reversa form occurs in antiquity. For example, in ancient Persia, the Tomb of Cyrus featured the cyma reversa. The cyma reversa is also evident in ancient Greek architecture, and takes its name from the cymatium. The ogee and Roman ogee profiles are used in decorative moulding, often framed between mouldings with a square section. As such, it is part of the standard classical decorative vocabulary, adopted from architrave and cornice mouldings of the Ionic order and Corinthian order.

Ogees are also often used in building interiors, in trim carpentry, for capping a baseboard or plinth elements, as a crown moulding trim piece where a wall meets a ceiling, and in similar fashion, at the tops of pieces of case furniture.

==Other uses==
Ogee is also a mathematical term, meaning an inflection point. The term also gets used in steam locomotive design, referring to a specific shape of saddle tank on small shunting locomotives, such as the GER Class 209. In fluid mechanics, the term is used to refer to aerodynamic profiles that bear such shapes, e.g., as in the ogee profile of the Concorde supersonic aircraft. As well, ogee curves are used to minimize water pressure on the downstream face of a dam spillway.

In aesthetic facial surgery, the term is used to describe the malar or cheekbone prominence transitioning into the mid-cheek hollow. The aim of a mid-face rejuvenation is to restore the ogee curve and enhance the cheekbones, common parts of routine facelift surgery.

===Manufactured objects with the ogee description===
Ogee is the name given to bubble-shaped chambers of pot stills that connects the swan neck to the still pot, in distillation apparatus, that allow distillate to expand, condense, and fall back into the still pot.

&quot;Ogee washers&quot; are heavy washers used in fasteners that have a large load-bearing surface; they are used in marine timber construction to prevent bolt heads or nuts from sinking into the face of timbers. The term ogee is used to describe the ogee shape giving rise to radial symmetry around the centre of the washer. Due to the size and shape of such washers, they are generally manufactured as a cast iron product (in accordance with ASTM A47 or A48).

&quot;Ogee clocks&quot; were a common type of weight-driven 19th-century pendulum clock presented in a simplified Gothic style, with the original design attributed to Chauncey Jerome. Ogee clocks were typically made in the United States, as mantelpieces or to mount to a wall bracket, and are one of the most commonly encountered varieties of American antique clocks. The overall design was rectangular, with framing by moulding with an ogee-profile surrounding a central glass door with a painted scene below the clock face, a door that protected the clock face and pendulum. Weights supported by pulleys fell inside the ogee moulding and so were hidden from view.

<doc id="351288" wikidata="Q10264401" url="?curid=351288" title="David Gest">
<text>David Alan Gest (May 11, 1953 – April 12, 2016) was an American producer and television personality. Gest founded the American Cinema Awards Foundation in 1983. He produced the television special &quot;Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration&quot; in 2001, which was the last reunion of Michael Jackson and the Jacksons coming 17 years after their previous reunion. Gest appeared on the 2006 series of the British reality television show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. He frequently made tabloid headlines during his marriage with Liza Minnelli. In 2016, Gest appeared in &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 17&quot; in the UK but elected to leave the show after 13 days due to &quot;medical reasons&quot;. This resulted him finishing in 13th place.

==Career==
===Early success===
At the age of 17, Gest landed a job as a publicist at London Records by passing himself off as 24. Nearly a year later, he was promoted to national director of publicity and transferred over to the New York office of the label. Singer Al Green encouraged him to start a P.R. and management firm, and at age 18, he created David Gest &amp; Associates. Green became his first client and mentor. Shortly after, he had 25 artists on his roster and generated vast success.

===Later years===
Gest finished in fourth place on the 2006 series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, a day before the show finished. Two days later, Gest appeared on the Royal Variety Show in London in front of Prince Charles, for which he received a standing ovation. Another two days later, a controversy arose on the cover of two major UK papers stating that more than 30,000 text votes were not counted in Gest&#x27;s favour when the network ITV had a voting glitch. This would have changed the outcome of the show but Gest declined a recount.

In January 2007, Gest appeared as a judge on ITV1&#x27;s &quot;Soapstar Superstar&quot;, for one night replacing Michael Ball who was coaching the singers. Later that month it was announced that Gest had signed a one-year deal with ITV to appear in his own reality series entitled &quot;This Is David Gest&quot;, which began on April 22, 2007. He also took cameras for a rare glimpse of the Jackson family house in Encino, California, where he met Tito Jackson and his children as well as matriarch Katherine Jackson. He was one of the four judges on ITV1&#x27;s entertainment series &quot;Grease Is the Word&quot; and also starred on &quot;Greased Lightnin″&quot;. In 2007, Gest also appeared in an episode of Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s &quot;The F Word&quot;.

Gest paid ITV to be released from his contract early and ITV replied that they had no idea what to do with him. Gest was quick to say that he wanted to be released: &quot;My lawyers negotiated an early release so I could host &quot;The Friday Night Project&quot; on Channel 4&quot;, Gest told &quot;The Sun&quot;.

Gest was the guest on &quot;Celebrity Fantasy Homes&quot; with Gaby Roslin.

===Plot to kill Elton John===
In 2017, Associated Press carried a report claiming that Gest had attempted to have Elton John killed. Gest was reportedly infuriated by a reference John made to Gest&#x27;s sexuality after Gest&#x27;s marriage to Liza Minnelli. The alleged plot did not progress.

==Personal life==
Gest was born to a Jewish family in Los Angeles and grew up in Southern California.

Gest and Liza Minnelli were married on March 16, 2002, and separated in July 2003. In October 2003, he sued her for $10 million, claiming that she had been violent and physically abusive during their marriage, behavior the affidavit blamed on Minnelli&#x27;s persistent alcoholism. Minnelli denied the accusations, claiming Gest was simply after her money. The suit was dismissed in September 2006 for lack of triable issue of fact.

Gest was a close friend of Michael Jackson, and after Jackson&#x27;s death, he produced and starred in a documentary film about his life called &quot;Michael Jackson: The Life of an Icon.&quot;

===Death===
On April 12, 2016, Gest was found dead in his room at the Four Seasons Hotel in East London&#x27;s Canary Wharf district. He was 62 years old. Police described his death as involving no suspicious circumstances. It was later reported that he had died from a stroke. Before his death, Gest had been arranging a new tour entitled &quot;David Gest Is Not Dead but Alive With Soul&quot;, in reference to a misunderstanding on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; after he had gone to bed early feeling unwell on the evening the death of David Bowie was announced. Despite Gest&#x27;s death, the tour went ahead.

After his death, sources revealed that Gest had been addicted to gambling; friends reported that he had amassed debts of £500,000 before his death.

Gest&#x27;s funeral service was held at Golders Green Crematorium in North London on April 29, 2016. His ashes were scattered in York.

Adult males have thin bills and are bright turquoise-blue and somewhat lighter underneath. Adult females have duller blue wings and tail, grey breast, grey crown, throat and back. In fresh fall plumage, the female&#x27;s throat and breast are tinged with red-orange which is brownish near the flank, contrasting with white tail underparts. Their call is a thin &#x27;few&#x27; while their song is a warbled high &#x27;chur chur&#x27;. The mountain bluebird is the state bird of Idaho and Nevada. This bird is an omnivore and it can live 6 to 10 years in the wild. It eats spiders, grasshoppers, flies and other insects, and small fruits. The mountain bluebird is a relative of the eastern and western bluebirds.

==Taxonomy==
The mountain bluebird was formally described in 1798 by the German ornithologist Johann Matthäus Bechstein and given the name &quot;Motacilla s. Sylvia currucoides&quot;. The specific epithet combines &quot;curruca&quot;, from Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s binomial name &quot;Motacilla curruca&quot; for the lesser whitethroat with the Ancient Greek &quot;-oidēs&quot; meaning &quot;resembling&quot;. The mountain bluebird is now placed with the two other bluebirds in the genus &quot;Sialia&quot; that was introduced by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1827. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The mountain bluebird is in length, weighs , and has a wingspan of 11.0-14.2 in (28-36 cm). It is sexually dimorphic in the color of the plumage but the sexes are similar in size. An adult male is bright turquoise-blue above and somewhat lighter blue underneath but with a white lower belly. An adult female has duller blue wings and tail, grey breast, grey crown, throat and back. In fresh fall plumage, the female&#x27;s throat and breast are brownish near the flank, contrasting with white tail underparts. Their call is a thin &#x27;few&#x27;; while their song is warbled high &#x27;chur chur&#x27;.

==Distribution and habitat==
Their breeding habitat is open country across western North America, including mountainous areas, as far north as Alaska. Although mountain bluebirds can be found in some states year-round, their range is expansive — they generally migrate south to Mexico in the winter and north into western Canada and even Alaska in the summer. Depending on the time of year, they may be ubiquitous in mountain environments like grasslands or landscapes of sagebrush, where trees and shrubs are fairly spread out.

==Behavior and ecology==
===Breeding===

The male can be seen singing from bare branches. The singing takes place right at dawn, just when the sun rises.

Mountain bluebirds nest in pre-existing cavities or in nest boxes. In remote areas, these birds are less affected by competition for natural nesting locations than other bluebirds. Mountain bluebirds are monogamous. After the couple decides together on an ideal nesting site, the female will typically build their nest themselves out of thin, dry material from the surrounding landscape while the male protects the area, defending against unwelcome visitors. It is true, though, that both males and females fiercely protect the nest. Once the nest is built, the female will lay an egg a day. Eggs are pale blue and unmarked, sometimes white. The clutch size is four or five eggs and she will incubate them for about two weeks. Young are naked and helpless at hatching and may have some down. The young will usually take about 21 days before they leave the nest, and it can take up to two months to raise fledglings to a stage of development at which they are able to fend and provide for themselves.

Mountain bluebirds are cavity nesters and can become very partial to a nest box, especially if they have successfully raised a clutch. They may even reuse the same nest, though not always. These birds will not abandon a nest if human activity is detected close by or at the nest. Because of this, they can be easily banded while they are still in the nest. The threats of predation for those that dwell in nesting boxes are mostly from house cats, raccoons, and the parasitic blowfly, &quot;Apaulina stalia&quot;.

===Feeding===

During the summer, the diet of Mountain bluebirds predominately consists of insects; while, in the winter months they eat mostly berries (like Juniper berries, Russian-olive berries, elderberry, etc.) and fruit seeds (such as mistletoe seeds and grapes, just to name a few). These birds hover over the ground and fly down to catch insects, also flying from a perch to catch them. The first technique takes up to 8 times the energy of sitting on a perch and waiting. They may forage in flocks in winter, looking for grasshoppers. Mountain Bluebirds will come to a platform feeder with live meal worms, berries, or peanuts.

==Relationship to humans==
The mountain bluebird is the state bird of Idaho and Nevada. More generally, the bluebird has lived in writers&#x27; and poets&#x27; imaginations as age-old bearers of joy and reverie. The Twitter bird logo is based on the mountain bluebird.

==Conservation status==
Mountain bluebirds are fairly common, but populations declined by about 26% between 1966 and 2014, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Partners in Flight estimates the global breeding population of 4.6 million, with 80% spending some part of the year in the U.S., 20% breeding in Canada, and 31% wintering in Mexico. The species rates an 8 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score. Mountain Bluebird is a U.S.-Canada Stewardship species, and is not on the 2014 State of the Birds Watch List. These bluebirds benefited from the westward spread of logging and grazing in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when the clearing of forest created open habitat for foraging. The subsequent waning of these industries, coupled with the deliberate suppression of wildfires, led to a dwindling of open acreage in the West and the decline of the species. More recently, as land-use practices have stabilized, so have Mountain Bluebird populations. Construction of nest boxes in suitable habitat has also provided a population boost. Populations are declining in areas where trees are too small to provide natural nesting cavities, and where forest and agricultural management practices have reduced the availability of suitable nest sites. Among birds that nest in cavities but cannot excavate them on their own, competition is high for nest sites. Mountain, Western, and more recently Eastern bluebirds compete for nest boxes where their ranges overlap. House Sparrows, European Starlings, and House Wrens also compete fiercely with bluebirds for nest cavities.

Industrial noise from natural gas wells can have a negative effect on breeding mountain bluebirds. When mountain bluebirds were exposed to this noise, it caused decreased baseline corticosterone levels in adults and nestlings, increased acute (stress-induced) corticosterone levels, and reduced fitness. The combined effect of decreased baseline and increased acute corticosterone may reduce the fitness of these birds by making them susceptible to inflammation and disease. Another study found that when nest boxes were set up in areas near industrial noise and in quiet control areas, there was a lower occupancy of the mountain bluebird at noisy sites, presumably because the noise reduces hatching success. Hatching success may be reduced in noisy areas as a result of increased distraction and increased vigilance behavior by females. Female bluebirds that leave the nest more frequently expose their eggs to fluctuations in incubation time and temperature. This increases predation risk of these eggs and reduces incubation time, resulting in fewer eggs successfully hatching.

<text>The involute gear profile is the most commonly used system for gearing today, with cycloid gearing still used for some specialties such as clocks. In an involute gear, the profiles of the teeth are &quot;involutes of a circle.&quot; The involute of a circle is the spiraling curve traced by the end of an imaginary taut string unwinding itself from that stationary circle called the base circle, or (equivalently) a triangle wave projected on the circumference of a circle.
==Advantages and design==
The involute gear profile, sometimes credited to Leonhard Euler, was a fundamental advance in machine design, since unlike with other gear systems, the tooth profile of an involute gear depends only on the number of teeth on the gear, pressure angle, and pitch. That is, a gear&#x27;s profile does not depend on the gear it mates with. Thus, n and m tooth involute spur gears with a given pressure angle and pitch will mate correctly, independently of n and m. This dramatically reduces the number of shapes of gears that need to be manufactured and kept in inventory.

In involute gear design, contact between a pair of gear teeth occurs at a single instantaneous point (see figure at right) where two involutes of the same spiral hand meet. Contact on the other side of the teeth is where both involutes are of the other spiral hand. Rotation of the gears causes the location of this contact point to move across the respective tooth surfaces. The tangent at any point of the curve is perpendicular to the generating line irrespective of the mounting distance of the gears. Thus the line of the force follows the generating line, and is thus tangent to the two base circles, and is known as the line of action (also called &quot;pressure line&quot; or &quot;line of contact&quot;). When this is true, the gears obey the &quot;fundamental law of gearing&quot;:
&quot;The angular velocity ratio between two gears of a gearset must remain constant throughout the mesh.&quot;
This property is required for smooth transmission of power with minimal speed or torque variations as pairs of teeth go into or come out of mesh, but is not required for low-speed gearing.
==Line of action and contact==
The point where the line of action crosses the line between the two centres is called the pitch point of the gears. The sliding contact friction is zero at this point.

The distance actually covered on the line of action is then called &quot;line of contact&quot;. The line of contact begins at the intersection between the line of action and the addendum circle of the driven gear and ends at the intersection between the line of action and the addendum circle of the driving gear.

The pressure angle is the acute angle between the line of action and a normal to the line connecting the gear centers. The pressure angle of the gear varies according to the position on the involute shape, but pairs of gears must have the same pressure angle in order for the teeth to mesh properly, so specific portions of the involute must be matched.

==Pressure angle==
While any pressure angle can be manufactured, the most common stock gears have a 20° pressure angle, with 14½° and 25° pressure angle gears being much less common. Increasing the pressure angle increases the width of the base of the gear tooth, leading to greater strength and load carrying capacity. Decreasing the pressure angle provides lower backlash, smoother operation and less sensitivity to manufacturing errors.
==Types of involute gears==
Most common stock gears are spur gears with straight teeth. Most gears used in higher-strength applications are helical involute gears where the spirals of the teeth are of different handedness, and the gears rotate in opposite directions. Studies have also been performed on gears having teeth with a non-involute curve profile.

Helical involute gears are typically only used in limited situations where the spirals of the teeth are of the same handedness, the spirals of the two involutes are of different handedness, and the line of action is the external tangents to the base circles (analogous to a normal belt drive, whereas normal gears are analogous to a crossed-belt drive), and the gears rotate in the same direction, such as can be used in limited-slip differentials because of their low efficiencies, and in locking differentials when the efficiencies are less than zero.

<text>R. J. Reynolds Nabisco, Inc., doing business as RJR Nabisco, was an American conglomerate, selling tobacco and food products, headquartered in the Calyon Building in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. R. J. Reynolds Nabisco stopped operating as a single entity in 1999. Both RJR (as R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company) and Nabisco (now part of Mondelēz International) still exist.

== History ==
RJR Nabisco was formed in 1985 by the merger of Nabisco Brands and R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
In 1988 RJR Nabisco was purchased by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. in what was at the time the largest leveraged buyout in history.
In 1999, due to concerns about tobacco lawsuit liabilities, the tobacco business was spun off into a separate company and RJR Nabisco was renamed Nabisco Holdings Corporation. Nabisco is currently owned by Mondelēz International Inc.

RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. (NYSE: NGH) was the parent company of RJR Nabisco, Inc. After the food and tobacco businesses separated in June 1999, Nabisco Group Holdings Corp. owned 80% of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., which was the parent company of Nabisco, Inc.

=== Formation ===

R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company was founded in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in 1875 and changed its name to R. J. Reynolds Industries, Inc. in 1970.
It became RJR Nabisco on April 25, 1986, after the company&#x27;s $4.9 billion purchase, and earlier 1.9 billion stock swap, of Nabisco Brands Inc. in 1985. On May 7, 1986, one week after the merger, RJR Nabisco sold Del Monte&#x27;s frozen foods unit to ConAgra Foods, followed by the sales of the soft drink brands Canada Dry and Sunkist to Cadbury Schweppes on June 3, 1986, the KFC fast-food chain to PepsiCo on July 25, 1986, and Heublein to Grand Metropolitan on January 17, 1987.

=== Headquarters move ===

In August 1986, the RJR Nabisco board announced that F. Ross Johnson would replace J. Tylee Wilson as head of the company effective January 1, 1987. Soon after, Johnson, believing &quot;bucolic&quot; Winston-Salem did not have the right image for a &quot;world-class company&quot;, began seeking other possible headquarters cities. After ruling out New York City and Dallas, the company decided on Atlanta because it was &quot;nouveau riche and overbuilt&quot;. On January 15, 1987, the RJR Nabisco board approved a headquarters move from Winston-Salem to Cobb County, Georgia, north of Atlanta, where the company had rented space. The move would affect 250 to 300 employees, while Winston-Salem would still have 14,000 people working for the company. RJR Nabisco donated the 519,000-square-foot World Headquarters Building to Wake Forest University but continued to use it until the September 1987 move. Later, RJR Nabisco&#x27;s Planters-Life Savers Division moved to the former headquarters building.

=== The leveraged buyout ===

The RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout was, at the time, widely considered to be the preeminent example of corporate and executive greed. Bryan Burrough and John Helyar published &quot;Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco&quot;, a successful book about the events which later became a television movie for HBO.

Ross Johnson was the President and CEO of RJR Nabisco at the time of the leveraged buyout and Henry Kravis was the managing partner at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. The leveraged buyout was in the amount of $25 billion, and the battle for control took place between October and November 1988.

Although KKR eventually took control of RJR Nabisco, RJR management and Shearson Lehman Hutton had originally announced that they would take RJR Nabisco private at $75 per share. A fierce series of negotiations and proposals ensued which involved nearly all of the major private equity players of the day, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers, First Boston, Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co., Forstmann Little, Shearson Lehman Hutton, and Merrill Lynch. Once put in play by Shearson Lehman Hutton and RJR management, almost every major Wall Street firm involved in M&amp;A launched frenzied, literal last-minute bids in a fog of incomplete or misleading information.

KKR quickly introduced a tender offer to obtain RJR Nabisco for $90 per share—a price that enabled it to proceed without the approval of RJR Nabisco&#x27;s management. RJR&#x27;s management team, working with Shearson Lehman Hutton and Salomon Brothers, submitted a bid of $112, a figure they felt certain would enable it to outflank any response by Kravis. KKR&#x27;s final bid of $109, while a lower dollar figure, was ultimately accepted by the board of directors.
It was accepted because KKR&#x27;s offer was guaranteed whereas management&#x27;s lacked a &quot;reset&quot;, meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their professed $112 per share. Additionally, many in RJR&#x27;s board of directors had grown concerned at recent disclosures of Johnson&#x27;s unprecedented golden parachute deal. &quot;Time&quot; magazine featured Johnson on the cover of its December 1988 issue along with the headline &quot;A Game of Greed: This man could pocket $100 million from the largest corporate takeover in history. Has the buyout craze gone too far?&quot;.

KKR&#x27;s offer was welcomed by the board, and, to some observers, it appeared that their elevation of the reset issue as a deal-breaker in KKR&#x27;s favor was little more than an excuse to reject Johnson&#x27;s higher payout of $112 per share. Johnson received compensation worth more than $60 million from the buyout, then left in February 1989. In March 1989, Louis V. Gerstner of American Express became the new head of RJR Nabisco.

=== After the KKR buyout ===

On April 27, 1989, RJR Nabisco announced it would move its headquarters to the New York City area.

As a result of the acquisition, RJR Nabisco divested the following divisions:
* Nabisco&#x27;s UK operations (including Smith&#x27;s and Walkers), Belin of France, and Saiwa of Italy were sold to BSN. Smith&#x27;s and Walkers were swiftly resold to PepsiCo.
* Chun King was sold to Yeo Hiap Seng.
* Associated Biscuits International (consisting of 38% of India&#x27;s Britannia and 40% of Pakistan&#x27;s English Biscuit Manufacturers) was sold to Britannia Industries.
* Fresh Del Monte Produce was sold to Polly Peck.
* Del Monte Foods was sold to Merrill Lynch, Citicorp Venture Capital, and Kikkoman. Del Monte&#x27;s Asia operations (outside the Philippines) were separately sold to Kikkoman.
* The company&#x27;s 20% stake in ESPN Inc. was sold to Hearst Communications.
Another major consequence of the buyout was that according to United States Department of Labor, in its report &quot;American Workplace&quot;, over 2,000 workers subsequently lost their jobs, of which 72% were eventually replaced, but earning less than half of their previous incomes, suggesting that it took most of those who lost their jobs an average of 5.6 months to find new employment.

On March 21, 1991, RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. became a publicly traded stock. In March 1999, RJR Nabisco announced the sale of the international division of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, and in June of that year, the company sold the remainder of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco to stockholders. The parent company became Nabisco Group Holdings and owned 80.5 percent of Nabisco Holdings. In 2000, Philip Morris bought Nabisco Holdings. Soon after that, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc., first traded in June 1999, announced the acquisition of Nabisco Group Holdings. The deal was completed in December 2000.

== Controversy ==

=== Ads on smoking-free flights ===
In April 1988, RJR Nabisco fired the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising agency after their Northwest Airlines ad introducing the airline&#x27;s in-flight smoking ban. This was despite the agency only being contracted for Nabisco products, not any tobacco products.

=== Pandora Papers ===
In 2021, RJR Nabisco (before it split up) was listed in the Pandora Papers after the law firm Baker McKenzie set up shell companies in Cyprus.

<text>Fabian Andre (January 8, 1910 – March 30, 1960) was an American composer, best known for co-writing the music of &quot;Dream a Little Dream of Me&quot; with Wilbur Schwandt in 1931. Popular in its time, the song was revived in 1968 when covered by the Mamas &amp; the Papas.

As an orchestra leader, he had a hit with the song &quot;Dance of an Ear of Corn&quot; for Columbia Records in July 1940. He released an album of rumbas for Fiesta Records in 1954.

==Death==
In 1960, Andre was found dead in his hotel room in Mexico City. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be &quot;alcoholic congestion&quot;. Years later, the Mamas and the Papas decided to record &quot;Dream a Little Dream of Me&quot; after member Michelle Phillips got word that Andre, whom she met in her childhood, had died supposedly in a fall down an elevator shaft.

<doc id="351303" wikidata="Q1365880" url="?curid=351303" title="Josh Beckett">
<text>Joshua Patrick Beckett (born May 15, 1980) is an American former professional baseball pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). A three-time MLB All-Star, he played for the Florida Marlins, the Boston Red Sox, and the Los Angeles Dodgers.

After a stellar high school career in which he was regarded as one of the top baseball prospects in the U.S., Beckett was drafted by the Marlins with the second overall pick in the 1999 MLB draft. He won the 2003 World Series with the Marlins and the 2007 World Series with the Red Sox, receiving the 2003 World Series MVP award and the 2007 American League Championship Series MVP award. Beckett was traded from the Marlins to the Red Sox in 2006 and from the Red Sox to the Dodgers in 2012, both as part of multi-player transactions.

Beckett recovered from a serious injury that caused him to miss most of the 2013 season. He pitched a no-hitter for the Dodgers against the Philadelphia Phillies on May 25, 2014, becoming the 19th man in Dodgers history to pitch a no-hitter. However, his season was again cut short due to an injury, and he announced his retirement on October 7, 2014.

==Early life==
Beckett grew up idolizing fellow Texans Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens. As a youth, he starred on Little League All-Star teams. He later attended Spring High School in Spring, Texas. He had trouble with grades and with paying attention to his coach during his freshman year, so his coach in frustration threw Beckett off the team. He experienced a growth spurt before his sophomore year and added speed to his fastball. He also raised his GPA and was able to get back on the team, where he had a 9–3 record with a 1.18 earned run average (ERA) as a sophomore, tossing three no-hitters.

As a high school junior, Beckett was ranked by &quot;Baseball America&quot; as the top high school prospect in the nation, and his team as the top high school baseball team. He compiled a 13–2 record and struck out 2.1 batters per inning while walking only 20 batters all season. His high school coach said, &quot;I’ve never seen a pitcher with his ability—ever.&quot;
In his senior season, Beckett, by this point nicknamed &quot;Kid Heat,&quot; was named the High School player of the year by USA Today. Beckett signed a letter of intent to pitch for Texas A&amp;M University, but he and Josh Hamilton were seen as the top two players available in the 1999 Major League Baseball draft. Concerned about Beckett&#x27;s perceived arrogance, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays chose Hamilton with the first pick. Beckett, meanwhile, was chosen with the second pick by the Florida Marlins. Marlins scouting director Al Avila said at the time, &quot;Beckett has good size and has an overpowering fastball. He&#x27;s a bulldog on the mound.&quot; Showing his confidence, Beckett predicted that he would make it to the major leagues within two years and play in an All-Star game by 2001.

==Baseball career==

===Florida Marlins (1999–2005)===

====Minor leagues====
Beckett engaged in protracted negotiations with the Marlins, during which he briefly enrolled at Blinn Junior College, but he eventually signed on August 28, 1999, to a four-year $7 million contract that included a $3.625 million signing bonus. His signing bonus was larger than what the Marlins were paying everyone on the Major League roster, except pitcher Alex Fernandez.

Beckett impressed the Marlins in his first spring training with the team in March 2000, with a fastball clocked at and a good curveball. He also showed his commitment to the team by donating $100,000 to the team&#x27;s charitable foundation, more than any other player had donated. He was assigned to the Kane County Cougars of the Class A Midwest League to make his professional debut. As the Opening Day starter for the Cougars, he pitched four innings and allowed only one run, on a double by Albert Pujols. Beckett suffered from injuries that season, including shoulder tendinitis and a frayed rotator cuff, injuries which took longer to heal because he did too much weight lifting while on the disabled list. He would later say, &quot;I tried to get too strong too quick and ended up making things worse.&quot; He pitched in 13 games for the Cougars and finished with a record of 2–3 with a 2.12 ERA and 61 strikeouts. He was selected by Baseball America as the Marlins best prospect and the 19th best in the entire minor leagues as well as having the best fastball in the Midwest League. He was also selected to play in the All-Star Futures Game, a showcase for the best prospects.

The Marlins assigned Beckett to the Brevard County Manatees of the Florida State League at the start of the 2001 season. He didn&#x27;t allow an earned run in his first innings and went 6–0 with a 1.23 ERA and 101 strikeouts in 13 games. Marlins General Manager Dave Dombrowski remarked on his progress, &quot;He pitched as well in the Florida State League as any prospect I&#x27;ve ever been associated with&quot;, leading to a promotion to the Double A Portland Sea Dogs of the Eastern League. Beckett struck out eight of the first nine batters he faced in his Sea Dogs debut on June 16, 2001. On August 13, 2001, he combined with two other Sea Dogs pitchers to throw a no-hitter against the Binghamton Mets. In 13 starts for the team, he had an 8–1 record, a 1.82 ERA and struck out 102 batters.

He was selected as Minor League Player of the Year by &quot;Baseball America&quot;, &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, and &quot;USA Today&quot;. &quot;Baseball America&quot; also ranked him as the Marlins&#x27; best prospect and the third best in all of baseball, while the Marlins named him as their organizational minor league player of the year.

====Major leagues====
Beckett&#x27;s MLB debut was on September 4, 2001, against the Chicago Cubs, in which he gave up one hit over six shutout innings to pick up his first MLB win. He also doubled and scored in the game. Beckett was quoted afterwards as saying, &quot;It was fun. I&#x27;m ready for my next one.&quot; He did not allow a run in his first 10 innings before giving up a two-run homer to Vladimir Guerrero on September 19 against the Montreal Expos. He finished 2001 with four games started, a 2–2 record, and an ERA of 1.50.

Hampered by blister problems in 2002, Beckett&#x27;s highlight was on July 21, when he struck out 12 Expos in one game, combining with a couple of relief pitchers on a Marlins record 17 strikeouts in a nine-inning game. In 23 appearances for the Marlins in 2002, which included two relief appearances, he was 6–7 with a 4.10 ERA and 113 strikeouts.

Beckett was named the Marlins opening day starting pitcher in 2003, and at 22 years old, he was the youngest opening day starter in the team&#x27;s history. However, he lasted just innings in the game as the Philadelphia Phillies scored five unearned runs in the third as a result of two errors and a passed ball. He subsequently went on the disabled list (DL) with a sprained right elbow in mid-May, part of a string of team injuries that contributed to the firing of Manager Jeff Torborg. He returned from his injury on July 1 and finished the season with a 9–8 record, a 3.04 ERA and 152 strikeouts.

Beckett made his postseason debut in the opening game of the 2003 National League (NL) Division Series, where he allowed only one run in seven innings against the San Francisco Giants but picked up the loss as Jason Schmidt pitched a complete-game shutout. However, the Marlins came back to win the series in four games. His next start, in game one of the 2003 NL Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs, did not go well as he allowed four runs in the first inning, two of them on a home run by Moisés Alou, and six runs in his innings. The Marlins battled back and won the game in extra innings. The Cubs took the next three games and only needed one more win to take the series when Beckett returned to the mound in game five. He allowed only three Cubs to reach base in the game, on two singles and a walk, in the complete-game shutout to keep his team alive. The Marlins took game six also, thanks partly to the infamous Steve Bartman incident. In game seven, on two days rest, Beckett came in out of the bullpen to pitch four innings and the Marlins won 9–6 to clinch the National League championship.

Beckett won the 2003 World Series MVP Award with two strong performances, one of which was on three days&#x27; rest, as the Marlins defeated the New York Yankees. In game three, he struck out 10 and allowed only two runs in innings. Then in game six at Yankee Stadium, he shut out the Yankees in a complete game, striking out nine batters and clinching the series by making the tag for the final out.

Beckett made the opening day start for the Marlins again in 2004, allowing one run in seven innings against the Expos. He made three trips to the DL during the season, but still pitched a career-high 26 starts and innings. He was 9–9 with a 3.79 ERA and had 152 strikeouts for the second year in a row but the Marlins faltered down the stretch and did not make the postseason. In 2005, he was 15–8 with a 3.38 ERA and 166 strikeouts in 29 games.

In his five seasons with the Marlins, Beckett had a 41–34 record, a 3.46 ERA and struck out a total of 607 batters in 106 games. In his final start as a Marlin, on September 23, 2005, against the Atlanta Braves, he struck out six in seven shutout innings but earned a no decision in a game the Marlins eventually lost.

===Boston Red Sox (2006–2012)===
In a deal that was made official on Thanksgiving Day 2005, Beckett was traded to the Boston Red Sox along with third baseman Mike Lowell and relief pitcher Guillermo Mota for minor league shortstop Hanley Ramírez (the top prospect in the Red Sox system at the time) and pitchers Aníbal Sánchez, Jesús Delgado and Harvey García. Beckett and Lowell were among a prominent list of veterans the Marlins traded in an effort to shed salary. This was organizationally termed a &quot;market correction&quot;. In his first start with the Red Sox, Beckett allowed only one run in seven innings to pick up the win against the Texas Rangers on April 5, 2006.
Beckett was the first Red Sox pitcher to hit a home run in 35 years — since the advent of the designated hitter rule — when he took Phillies&#x27; pitcher Brett Myers deep during an interleague game on May 20, 2006. On July 18, he signed a three-year, $30 million contract extension with a $10 million club option for 2010. Beckett completed his first season with the Red Sox with a record of 16–11 and a 5.01 ERA. In innings, he gave up 191 hits and struck out 158 batters while walking 74. He also allowed 36 home runs, tied for second most in the majors.

At the start of the 2007 season, Beckett adjusted to throwing more breaking pitches and fewer fastballs. At the same time, he learned to locate his pitches rather than simply get strikes by power. He reduced his walks and home runs allowed by nearly half, contributing to his success in 2007. Beckett became one of six Red Sox pitchers in history to win their first seven starts. George Winter and Mickey Harris both won their first seven starts in a season, and Babe Ruth, Dave Ferriss and Roger Moret all won their first eight starts in a season. After a strong first half, posting a 12–2 record with a 3.44 ERA, he was selected to the American League team in the 2007 MLB All-Star Game. Beckett earned the victory in the game after pitching two innings, giving up only one hit, and striking out two. Beckett became the first pitcher to win 20 games in a season since 2005, finishing the season with a record of 20–7, a 3.27 ERA, 194 strikeouts, a 1.14 WHIP, and only 40 walks and 17 home runs allowed. He finished second in AL Cy Young Award voting, behind CC Sabathia.

Beckett threw a shutout against the Anaheim Angels on 108 pitches, 83 of which were strikes, to start the 2007 American League Division Series. Nine days later, Beckett started the first game of the 2007 American League Championship Series (ALCS) and pitched six innings for the win and in game five he struck out 11 in eight innings. Beckett&#x27;s 2–0 record and 1.93 ERA against the Cleveland Indians earned him the 2007 ALCS MVP Award. He then started and won the first game of the 2007 World Series against the Colorado Rockies, pitching seven innings, allowing one run on six hits, and striking out nine batters. Boston would go on to sweep the Rockies in the series.

On May 8, 2008, Beckett recorded his 1,000th career strikeout, when Brandon Inge of the Detroit Tigers struck out swinging in the seventh inning. He was 12–10 with a 4.03 ERA in 27 starts. In game three of the 2008 American League Division Series against the Anaheim Angels he allowed four runs in five innings He then made two starts in the 2008 ALCS against the Tampa Bay Rays and was 1–0 but had a high 9.64 ERA.

In 2009, during his first Opening Day start with the Red Sox, Beckett struck out 10 through seven innings allowing only one run and two hits in a 5–3 victory over the Rays. On April 14, 2009, MLB fined and suspended him six games for intentionally throwing over the head of Angels outfielder Bobby Abreu. Beckett later appealed the suspension and got it reduced to five games. On June 20, 2009, he recorded his first complete-game shutout in three years against the Atlanta Braves in a duel against former Red Sox pitcher Derek Lowe. The shutout was his first in a Red Sox uniform. On July 5, 2009, he was selected to represent Boston in the 2009 MLB All Star Game.

Beckett recorded his 100th career win on July 12, 2009, pitching a complete-game shutout against the Kansas City Royals at Fenway Park. On August 7, 2009, against the New York Yankees, he engaged in a pitching duel with former Marlins teammate A. J. Burnett that turned into a fifteen-inning, five-hour-and-thirty-three-minute game. He threw seven shutout innings, Burnett threw . The Red Sox eventually lost the game in the bottom of the 15th, when Alex Rodriguez hit a walk-off two-run home run. He was 17–6 on the season, with a 3.86 ERA and a career-high 199 strikeouts in 32 starts. He lost his one start in the postseason, to the Angels in Game 2 of the 2009 ALDS.

On April 5, 2010, the Red Sox and Beckett agreed to a four-year, $68 million contract extension, through 2014. On May 7, he allowed nine runs, struck out eight and also hit two batters. This was the first time a Major League pitcher had that combination of stats in a single game since Jack Coombs of the Philadelphia Athletics during the 1911 season. He was placed on the disabled list on May 19 with a lower back strain and returned from the injury on July 23. In 21 starts in 2010, he was 6–6 with a 5.78 ERA.

In 2011, he posted career bests in ERA (2.89), opponent batting average (.211) and WHIP (1.03). He was 13–7 in 30 games and was selected to his third All-Star Game. On September 16, he recorded his 1,000th strikeout as a member of the Red Sox against Tampa Bay&#x27;s Ben Zobrist in the sixth inning. At the end of the 2011 season, the Red Sox collapsed and failed to make the playoffs. Beckett and two more starting pitchers (John Lackey and Jon Lester) were in the center of a controversy where the three drank alcohol, ate fried chicken, and played video games during games where they weren&#x27;t pitching. Beckett was noted as the leader of this and some cited this behavior as part of the reason for the team&#x27;s poor play down the stretch.

Beckett struggled in the 2012 season, he went 5–11 with a 5.23 ERA as a Red Sox. He was also the center of yet another controversy when it was reported that he played several rounds of golf despite having been scratched from his start due to a lat muscle injury. In what would turn out to be his final start with the Red Sox, he allowed four runs in six innings on August 19, 2012, against the Yankees. Over seven seasons, he started 194 regular season games for the Red Sox with an 89–58 record, a 4.17 ERA and 1,108 strikeouts.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (2012–2014)===

On August 25, 2012, Beckett was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers (along with Adrián González, Carl Crawford and Nick Punto and $11 million in cash) for James Loney, Iván DeJesús, Jr., Allen Webster, and two players to be named later (Jerry Sands and Rubby De La Rosa). He started seven games for the Dodgers after the trade and was 2–3 with a 2.93 ERA.

Beckett struggled in the early part of the 2013 season, posting an 0–5 record and 5.19 ERA in eight starts. He was placed on the disabled list with a groin strain on May 15, his 33rd birthday. While on the disabled list, he began to experience numbness and tingling in his hand so he went to see a nerve specialist and expressed doubt as to whether he would be able to pitch again. The Dodgers shut him down from pitching for a month while he underwent a rigorous rehabilitation program in an effort to avoid season-ending surgery. However, the tingling sensation returned when he attempted to resume his throwing program in late June. He was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, which required him to undergo surgery on July 10, 2013, that ended his 2013 season.

Beckett&#x27;s surgery, which included having a rib removed, made him a question mark for the Dodgers heading into 2014. He returned to the Dodgers on April 9 and made his first start since the previous May, allowing four runs in four innings. On May 13, he picked up his first win since 2012.
On May 25, 2014, Beckett pitched a no-hitter against the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park, the 21st no-hitter in Dodgers history, and the first since Hideo Nomo did so in the 1996 season. He was also the first pitcher to no-hit the Phillies since Bob Forsch in 1978. Beckett threw 128 pitches, struck out six, and walked three en route to the victory. Beckett also became the oldest pitcher (34) to throw a no-hitter since Randy Johnson (40) threw a perfect game in 2004. He was honored as the National League Player of the Week as a result of that game.

On July 8, 2014, Beckett landed on the disabled list with a left hip impingement, an injury he said had gotten worse as the season went on. He returned to the rotation on July 22, but struggled when he returned. In a start on August 3, he was only able to pitch four innings against the Cubs. Afterward, Beckett told the team that he had experienced renewed discomfort in his injured hip. An MRI revealed that his hip impingement had resulted in a torn labrum and two cysts, possibly requiring season ending surgery. He was placed back on the 15-day disabled list on August 8. On September 3, 2014, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly told reporters that Beckett&#x27;s season was likely over due to his injury. A couple of days later, Beckett confirmed that he would not pitch again in 2014 and added that he was also considering retirement. Beckett officially announced his retirement on October 7, 2014.

==Pitching style==
Beckett threw five pitches regularly: a four-seam fastball (), a two-seam fastball (), a cutter (), a curveball (), and a changeup (). Beckett used all five of his pitches against left-handed hitters but dropped the changeup against righties. He preferred to use his curveball when ahead in the count, bolstered by its 34% whiff rate. Beckett also began to experiment with a slider and splitter in 2012.

==Personal life==

Beckett has been linked to such celebrities as model/sportcaster Leeann Tweeden and country singer Danielle Peck. On October 18, 2007, Peck was invited by the Cleveland Indians to sing the National Anthem prior to Game 5 of the American League Championship Series between the Red Sox and Indians. Beckett was the starting pitcher in that game, and some Red Sox fans theorized that her invitation was an attempt by the Indians organization to distract Beckett. The Indians denied this claim. On January 22, 2011, he married Holly Fisher, an aeronautics engineer and former high school classmate. The couple have three children together. Beckett owns homes in Manhattan Beach, California, and Boerne, Texas.

Beckett is an avid deer hunter and has been since childhood. He was the 2002 winner of the Muy Grande Deer Contest for bringing down the largest buck during the Texas deer hunting season. He owns Herradura Ranch, a deer-hunting ranch outside of Cotulla, Texas.

He was featured in a Kevin Fowler music video alongside his teammates John Lackey, Tim Wakefield, Jon Lester and Clay Buchholz.

On November 11, 2017, Beckett was arrested for public intoxication as a result of charging at a country band at a local bar in Texas. The singer received a torn rotator cuff and dislocated shoulder.

<text>The National Cycle Network (NCN) was established to encourage cycling and walking throughout the United Kingdom, as well as for the purposes of bicycle touring. It was created by the charity Sustrans who were aided by a £42.5 million National Lottery grant. However Sustrans themselves only own around 2% of the paths on the network, the rest being made of existing public highways and rights of way, and permissive paths negotiated by Sustrans with private landowners. 

In 2017, the Network was used for over 786 million cycling and walking trips, made by 4.4 million people. 

In 2020, around a quarter of the NCN was scrapped on safety grounds, leaving of signed routes. These are made up of of traffic-free paths with the remaining on-road. It uses shared use paths, disused railways, minor roads, canal towpaths and traffic-calmed routes in towns and cities.

==History==
The Bristol and Bath Railway Path (now part of National Route 4) is a walking and cycling path on a disused railway. It opened in 1984 and was the first part of what would later become the NCN.

The National Cycle Network began with a National Lottery Grant from the 
Millennium Commission 
in 1995.
The original goal was to create of signposted cycle routes by 2005, with 50% of these not being on roads, and all of it being &quot;suitable for an unsupervised twelve year old.&quot; By mid-2000, of route was signposted to an &quot;interim&quot; standard, and a new goal was then set to double that to by 2005. August 2005 saw the completion of that goal.

In 2018, Sustrans published the National Cycle Network - Paths for Everyone report which reviewed the quality and usage of the Network and set out a vision for its future. The report rated 42% of the then network as &#x27;very poor&#x27; and identified over 12,000 barriers on the network which made it inaccessible by some users. As a result, around a quarter of the network was de-designated.

, there were of signed cycle and walking route that are part of the Network.

==Routes==
===National routes===
There are ten main national routes. they are not all complete.

*National Cycle Route 1: Dover – Tain. Running the length of the east coast and passing through London and Edinburgh. 
*National Cycle Route 2: Dover – St Austell in England, along the south coast.
*National Cycle Route 3: Bristol – Land&#x27;s End, incorporating the West Country Way via Chew Valley Lake, and the Cornish Way
*National Cycle Route 4: London (Greenwich) – Fishguard, in West Wales, via Reading, Bath, Bristol, Newport, Caerphilly, Pontypridd, Swansea and Llanelli.
*National Cycle Route 5: Reading – Holyhead, via Birmingham, The Midlands and the North Wales coast
*National Cycle Route 6: Windsor – Lake District, running in sections via Luton, Milton Keynes, Northampton, Derby, Nottingham, Sheffield, Manchester and Preston crossing the Pennine Cycleway
*National Cycle Route 7: Sunderland – Inverness via Glasgow.
*National Cycle Route 8: Cardiff – Holyhead, through the heart of Wales.
*National Cycle Route 9: Belfast – Newry in sections of traffic-free route, with the major sections being between Belfast and Lisburn, and Craigavon and Newry
*National Cycle Route 10: Tynemouth — Cockermouth. Roughly parallel to the C2C / Sea to Sea Cycle Route and Hadrian&#x27;s Cycleway. It is a branch of National Route 1.

===Numbering system===
NCN routes beginning with numbers 1 to 6 are generally in England, routes beginning with a 7 start in Scotland and northern England, routes beginning with an 8 are generally in Wales, and routes beginning with a 9 are in Northern Ireland. The main route numbers have one digit (1 to 6 radiate clockwise from the south of England); other routes have two digits, starting with the number of the relevant main route.

There are also many shorter routes, reaching smaller towns and cities, that have three-digit numbers. Again, the route numbers start with the number of the main route for that region. For example, the Great North Cycleway in northern England has route number 725. Signs showed the route numbers on a blue background. Routes have been progressively renumbered with three-digit national numbers.

Some routes are numbered to match the motorways and major roads that connect the same destinations; examples include National Route 62, which by connecting the two sides of the Pennines mirrors the M62 motorway.

===Signage===

The network is signposted using a white bicycle symbol (and on some routes, walking) on a blue background, with an inset box showing a white route number on a red background. In general, signs do not show destinations or distances. On some older signs, regional route numbers have a blue background instead. The system of symbols is based on that used by the Danish National Cycle Route network.

====Mileposts====

One thousand &quot;Millennium Mileposts&quot; made from cast iron were funded by the Royal Bank of Scotland to mark the creation of the National Cycle Network, and these are found along the NCN routes throughout the UK. Following the de-designation of approximately a quarter of the NCN in 2020, a significant number of the mileposts are now orphaned from their intended routes.

There are four different types: &quot;Fossil Tree&quot; (designed by John Mills), &quot;The Cockerel&quot; (designed by Iain McColl), &quot;Rowe Type&quot; (designed by Andrew Rowe), and &quot;Tracks&quot; (designed by David Dudgeon). The four artists are from each country of the UK, though all posts can be found in all four countries.

Most mileposts contain a disk featuring symbols and text in code. There are 60 different designs, spread across the country. They form part of the Millennium Time Trail, a treasure hunt puzzle created by Sustrans in 2001.

<doc id="351305" wikidata="Q1048902" url="?curid=351305" title="Pitcher">
<text>In baseball, the pitcher is the player who throws (&quot;pitches&quot;) the baseball from the pitcher&#x27;s mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1. The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game, and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum. There are many different types of pitchers, such as the starting pitcher, relief pitcher, middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and the closer.

Traditionally, the pitcher also bats. Starting in 1973 with the American League and spreading to further leagues throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the hitting duties of the pitcher have generally been given over to the position of designated hitter, a cause of some controversy. The National League adopted the designated hitter in 2022; as of , the Japanese Central League is the highest level of competition to not use the designated hitter position.

== Overview ==

In most cases, the objective of the pitcher is to deliver the pitch to the catcher without allowing the batter to hit the ball with the bat. A successful pitch is delivered in such a way that the batter either allows the pitch to pass through the strike zone, swings the bat at the ball and misses it, or hits the ball poorly (resulting in a pop fly or ground out). If the batter elects not to swing at the pitch, it is called a &quot;strike&quot; if any part of the ball passes through the strike zone and a &quot;ball&quot; when no part of the ball passes through the strike zone. A check swing is when the batter begins to swing, but then stops the swing short. If the batter successfully checks the swing and the pitch is out of the strike zone, it is called a ball.

There are two legal pitching positions, the &quot;windup&quot; and the set position or &quot;stretch&quot;. Either position may be used at any time; typically, the windup is used when the bases are empty, while the set position is used when at least one runner is on base. Each position has certain procedures that must be followed. A balk can be called on a pitcher from either position. A power pitcher is one who relies on the velocity of his pitches to succeed. Generally, power pitchers record a high percentage of strikeouts. A control pitcher succeeds by throwing accurate pitches and thus records few walks.

Nearly all action during a game is centered on the pitcher for the defensive team. A pitcher&#x27;s particular style, time taken between pitches, and skill heavily influence the dynamics of the game and can often determine the victor. Starting with the pivot foot on the &quot;pitcher&#x27;s rubber&quot; at the center of the pitcher&#x27;s mound, which is from &quot;home plate&quot;, the pitcher throws the baseball to the catcher, who is positioned behind home plate and catches the ball. Meanwhile, a batter stands in the batter&#x27;s box at one side of the plate, and attempts to bat the ball safely into fair play.

The type and sequence of pitches chosen depend upon the particular situation in a game. Because pitchers and catchers must coordinate each pitch, a system of hand signals is used by the catcher to communicate choices to the pitcher, who either vetoes or accepts by shaking his head or nodding. The relationship between pitcher and catcher is so important that some teams select the starting catcher for a particular game based on the starting pitcher. Together, the pitcher and catcher are known as the &quot;battery&quot;.

Although the object and mechanics of pitching remain the same, pitchers may be classified according to their roles and effectiveness. The starting pitcher begins the game, and he may be followed by various relief pitchers, such as the long reliever, the left-handed specialist, the middle reliever, the setup man, and/or the closer.

In abbreviating baseball positions, P is used as a general designation for pitchers. SP and RP are sometimes used to differentiate starting and relief pitchers, respectively, while LHP and RHP are sometimes used to indicate if a pitcher is left-handed or right-handed, respectively.

In Major League Baseball, baseball rubbing mud is used to condition game balls before pitchers use them.

==Pitching in a game==


A skilled pitcher often throws various pitches to prevent the batter from hitting the ball well. The most basic pitch is a fastball, where the pitcher throws the ball as hard as possible. Some pitchers are able to throw a fastball at a speed over , ex., Aroldis Chapman. Other common types of pitches are the curveball, slider, changeup, cutter, sinker, screwball, forkball, split-fingered fastball, slurve, knuckleball, and vulcan. These generally are intended to have unusual movement or to deceive the batter as to the rotation or velocity of the ball, making it more difficult to hit. Few pitchers throw all these pitches, but most use a subset or blend of the basic types. Some pitchers release pitches from different arm angles, making it harder for the batter to pick up the ball&#x27;s flight. (See List of baseball pitches.) A pitcher throwing well on a particular day is said to have brought his &quot;good stuff.&quot;

Pitchers use several distinct throwing styles. The most common style is a three-quarters delivery in which the pitcher&#x27;s arm snaps downward with the ball&#x27;s release. Some pitchers use a sidearm delivery in which the arm arcs laterally to the torso. Some pitchers use a submarine style in which the pitcher&#x27;s body tilts sharply downward on delivery, creating an exaggerated sidearm motion in which the pitcher&#x27;s knuckles come very close to the mound.

Effective pitching is vitally important in baseball. In baseball statistics, for each game, one pitcher will be credited with winning the game, and one pitcher will be charged with losing it. These are not necessarily the starting pitchers for each team; however, a reliever can win, and the starter would then get a no-decision.

==Rotation and specialization==
Pitching is physically demanding, especially if the pitcher is throwing with maximum effort. A full game usually involves 120–170 pitches thrown by each team, and most pitchers begin to tire before they reach this point. As a result, the pitcher who starts a game often will not be the one who finishes it, and he may not be recovered enough to pitch again for a few days. The act of throwing a baseball at high speed is very unnatural to the body and somewhat damaging to human muscles; thus pitchers are very susceptible to injuries, soreness, and general pain.

Baseball teams use two strategies to address this problem: rotation and specialization. To accommodate playing nearly every day, a team will include a group of pitchers who start games and rotate between them, allowing each pitcher to rest for a few days between starts. A team&#x27;s roster of starting pitchers are usually not even in terms of skill. Exceptional pitchers are highly sought after and in the professional ranks draw large salaries, thus teams can seldom stock each slot in the rotation with top-quality pitchers.

The best starter in the team&#x27;s rotation is called the ace. He is usually followed in the rotation by 3 or 4 other starters before he would be due to pitch again. Barring injury or exceptional circumstances, the ace is usually the pitcher that starts on Opening Day. Aces are also preferred to start crucial games late in the season and in the playoffs; sometimes they are asked to pitch on shorter rest if the team feels he would be more effective than the 4th or 5th starter. Typically, the further down in the rotation a starting pitcher is, the weaker he is compared with the others on the staff. The &quot;5th starter&quot; is seen as the cut-off between the starting staff and the &quot;bullpen&quot;. A team may have a designated 5th starter, sometimes known as a spot starter or that role may shift cycle to cycle between members of the bullpen or Triple-A starters. Differences in rotation setup could also have tactical considerations as well, such as alternating right- or left-handed pitchers, in order to throw off the other team&#x27;s hitting game-to-game in a series.

Teams have additional pitchers reserved to replace that game&#x27;s starting pitcher if he tires or proves ineffective. These players are called &quot;relief pitchers&quot;, &quot;relievers&quot;, or collectively the &quot;bullpen&quot;. Once a starter begins to tire or is starting to give up hits and runs a call is made to the bullpen to have a reliever start to warm up. This involves the reliever starting to throw practice balls to a coach in the bullpen so as to be ready to come in and pitch whenever the manager wishes to pull the current pitcher. Having a reliever warm up does not always mean he will be used; the current pitcher may regain his composure and retire the side, or the manager may choose to go with another reliever if strategy dictates. Commonly, pitching changes will occur as a result of a pinch hitter being used in the late innings of a game, especially if the pitcher is in the batting lineup due to not having the designated hitter. A reliever would then come out of the bullpen to pitch the next inning.

When making a pitching change a manager will come out to the mound. He will then call in a pitcher by the tap of the arm which the next pitcher throws with. The manager or pitching coach may also come out to discuss strategy with the pitcher, but on his second trip to the mound with the same pitcher in the same inning, the pitcher has to come out. It is considered proper etiquette for the pitcher to wait on the mound until the manager arrives, whereby he then hands the manager the ball, and only then he is allowed to leave the field. Relief pitchers often have even more specialized roles, and the particular reliever used depends on the situation. Many teams designate one pitcher as the &quot;closer&quot;, a relief pitcher specifically reserved to pitch the final inning or innings of a game when his team has a narrow lead, in order to preserve the victory. More recently, teams began experimenting with an &quot;opener&quot;, a relief pitcher who starts a game but only pitches at least the first inning. Other relief roles include set-up men, middle relievers, left-handed specialists, and long relievers. Generally, relievers pitch fewer innings and throw fewer pitches than starters, but they can usually pitch more frequently without the need for several days of rest between appearances. Relief pitchers are typically pitchers with &quot;special stuff&quot;, meaning that they have very effective pitches or a very different style of delivery. This makes the batter see a very different way of pitching in attempt to get them out. One example is a sidearm or submarine pitcher.

Position players are eligible to pitch in a game as well, this however is rare as these players are not truly trained as pitchers and risk injury. (For instance, in a 1993 game, Jose Canseco suffered a season ending arm injury after pitching 2 innings.) Plus, they tend to throw with less velocity and skill. For these reasons, managers will typically only use a position player as a pitcher in a blowout loss, or if they have run out of available pitchers in order to avoid a forfeit (the latter typically only happens in extra-inning games). Cliff Pennington of the Toronto Blue Jays, who pitched of an inning in game 4 of the 2015 American League Championship Series en route to a 14–2 loss, was the only documented position player to pitch during the postseason, until Austin Romine of the New York Yankees pitched the ninth inning of Game 3 in a 16–1 loss against the Boston Red Sox in the 2018 American League Division Series. The only regulation game in which &quot;both&quot; pitchers of record were position players occurred on May 6, 2012, when the Baltimore Orioles&#x27; designated hitter Chris Davis was the winner in a 16-inning game against Boston while Red Sox outfielder Darnell McDonald took the loss.

==After the ball is pitched==
The pitcher&#x27;s duty does not cease after he pitches the ball. Unlike the other fielders, a pitcher and catcher must start every play in a designated area. The pitcher must be on the pitcher&#x27;s mound, with one foot in contact with the pitcher&#x27;s rubber, and the catcher must be behind home plate in the catcher&#x27;s box. Once the ball is in play, however, the pitcher and catcher, like the other fielders, can respond to any part of the field necessary to make or assist in a defensive play. At that point, the pitcher has several standard roles. The pitcher must attempt to field any balls coming up the middle, and in fact a Gold Glove Award is reserved for the pitcher with the best fielding ability. He must head over to first base, to be available to cover it, on balls hit to the right side, since the first baseman might be fielding them too far to the baseman&#x27;s right to reach first base before the batter-runner can. Except for the first baseman, the pitcher ordinarily has the shortest run to first base of anyone, and is the second-most-likely person to make a putout at first base by retrieving a fielded ball thrown by an infielder (typically a first baseman). On passed balls and wild pitches, he covers home-plate when there are runners on. Also, he generally backs up throws to home plate. When there is a throw from the outfield to third base, he has to back up the play to third base as well.

==Pitching biomechanics==
The physical act of overhand pitching is complex and unnatural to the human anatomy. Most major league pitchers throw at speeds of , putting high amounts of stress on the pitching arm. Pitchers are by far the most frequently injured players and many professional pitchers will have multiple surgeries to repair damage in the elbow and shoulder by the end of their careers.

As such, the biomechanics of pitching are closely studied and taught by coaches at all levels and are an important field in sports medicine. Glenn Fleisig, a biomechanist who specializes in the analysis of baseball movements, says that pitching is &quot;the most violent human motion ever measured.&quot; He claims that the pelvis can rotate at 515–667°/sec, the trunk can rotate at 1,068–1,224°/s, the elbow can reach a maximal angular velocity of 2,200–2,700°/s and the force pulling the pitcher&#x27;s throwing arm away from the shoulder at ball release is approximately .

The overhead throwing motion can be divided into phases which include windup, early cocking, late cocking, early acceleration, late acceleration, deceleration, and follow-through. Training for pitchers often includes targeting one or several of these phases. Biomechanical evaluations are sometimes done on individual pitchers to help determine points of inefficiency. Mechanical measurements that are assessed include, but are not limited to, foot position at stride foot contact (SFC), elbow flexion during arm cocking and acceleration phases, maximal external rotation during arm cocking, horizontal abduction at SFC, arm abduction, lead knee position during arm cocking, trunk tilt, peak angular velocity of throwing arm and angle of wrist.

Some players begin intense mechanical training at a young age, a practice that has been criticized by many coaches and doctors, with some citing an increase in Tommy John surgeries in recent years. Fleisig lists nine recommendations for preventative care of children&#x27;s arms. 1) Watch and respond to signs of fatigue. 2) Youth pitchers should not pitch competitively in more than 8 months in any 12-month period. 3) Follow limits for pitch counts and days of rest. 4) Youth pitchers should avoid pitching on multiple teams with overlapping seasons. 5) Youth pitchers should learn good throwing mechanics as soon as possible: basic throwing, fastball pitching and change-up pitching. 6) Avoid using radar guns. 7) A pitcher should not also be a catcher for their team. The pitcher catcher combination results in many throws and may increase the risk of injury. 8) If a pitcher complains of pain in their elbow, get an evaluation from a sports medicine physician. 9) Inspire youth to have fun playing baseball and other sports. Participation and enjoyment of various activities will increase the youth&#x27;s athleticism and interest in sports.

To counteract shoulder and elbow injury, coaches and trainers have begun utilizing &quot;jobe&quot; exercises, named for Frank Jobe, the pioneer of the Tommy John procedure. Jobes are exercises that have been developed to isolate, strengthen and stabilize the rotator cuff muscles. Jobes can be done using either resistance bands or lightweight dumbbells. Common jobe exercises include shoulder external rotation, shoulder flexion, horizontal abduction, prone abduction and scaption (at 45°, 90° and inverse 45°).

In addition to the Jobes exercises, many pitching coaches are creating lifting routines that are specialized for pitchers. Pitchers should avoid exercises that deal with a barbell. The emphasis on the workout should be on the legs and the core. Other body parts should be worked on but using lighter weights. Over lifting muscles, especially while throwing usually ends up in a strain muscle or possibly a tear.

==Equipment==

Other than the catcher, pitchers and other fielders wear very few pieces of equipment. In general the ball cap, baseball glove and cleats are equipment used. Pitchers may also keep with them at the mound a bag of powdered rosin. Handling the bag applies a small layer of the rosin to the pitcher&#x27;s fingers in order to increase his grip on the ball.

Currently there is a new trend of introducing a pitcher helmet to provide head protection from batters hitting line drives back to the pitcher. , MLB approved a protective pitchers cap which can be worn by any pitcher if they choose. San Diego Padres relief pitcher, Alex Torres was the first player in MLB to wear the protective cap.

One style of helmet is worn on top of the ballcap to provide protection to the forehead and sides.

In softball, a full face helmet is available to all players including pitchers. These fielder&#x27;s masks are becoming increasingly popular in younger fast pitch leagues, some leagues even requiring them.

<text>Bradley Air Services Limited, operating as First Air, was an airline headquartered in Kanata, a suburb of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It operated services to 34 communities in Nunavut, Nunavik, and the Northwest Territories. First Air has assisted in various humanitarian missions such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake, airlifting relief supplies and equipment. Its main base, which included a large hangar, cargo and maintenance facility, was located at Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport, with hubs at Iqaluit Airport, and Yellowknife Airport. On November 1, 2019, the airline consolidated operations with Canadian North.

== History ==

The airline was founded at Ottawa International by Canadian aviation pioneer Russell (Russ) Bradley and started operations as Bradley Flying School in 1946, changing the name in 1950 to Bradley Air Services, concurrent with a move to Carp Airport, and is still registered under that name. First Air started scheduled operations in 1973, between Ottawa and North Bay. This service was operated with an eight-seat passenger plane.

The airline opened southern gateways at Edmonton, Winnipeg, Montreal and Ottawa. Through Kuujjuaq in Nunavik and Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories (NWT), the airline provided services to 26 Inuit communities in Nunavut, Nunavik and the NWT. Service to Sanikiluaq, Nunavut, was provided in partnership with Air Inuit.

In 1995, First Air acquired Ptarmigan Airways, and in 1997 Northwest Territorial Airways (also known as NWT Air), both merged into First Air. Ptarmigan Airways operated smaller turboprop aircraft types such as the Beechcraft King Air (BE-200 model), DHC-6 Twin Otter and Grumman Gulfstream I turboprops, and a single Cessna Citation II business jet aircraft. At the time of the merger NWT Air operated Boeing 737-200 jetliners and a single Lockheed L-100 Hercules cargo turboprop.

First Air was wholly owned by the Inuit of Quebec through the Makivik Corporation, which purchased the company in 1990.

On 21 August 2008, First Air fired president Bob Davis and replaced him with Scott Bateman. Davis had been president since December 1997 and had several disagreements with First Air over a period of time.

On 5 June 2009, First Air received a wide-body aircraft, a Boeing 767-223 SF (Super Freighter), which was under a three-year dry lease from Cargo Aircraft Management (CAM), a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group (ATSG). The 767 has since left the fleet.

After the introduction of the operationally and logistically more economical Boeing 767-223SF in March 2010, First Air retired and removed its two Boeing 727-233 aircraft from its fleet. One was one of only two combi types in the world, and the last 727-200 in North America on scheduled passenger-freight services. The other 727-233F full freighter was also phased out. A Hawker Siddeley HS 748 turboprop (C-GFNW) was retired in March 2011. Replacing this aircraft type were two ATR 72 Combi turboprops as part of First Air&#x27;s fleet replacement program. They were outfitted with a cargo handling system, and one was outfitted with a large cargo door. A first of its kind in North America, it was able to handle built unit Load Device positions. This in turn created a larger load capacity and flexibility reaching remote communities. One began service in the last quarter of 2011, and the second in the first quarter 2012.

In 2009 First Air added routes in the Kivallaq Region adding flights from Rankin Inlet to Arviat and Baker Lake. On 30 March 2010, it added Whale Cove, Repluse Bay, Coral Harbour and Chesterfield Inlet to the Kivalliq Routes.

In February 2011, First Air and Qikiqtaaluk Corporation (QC) started a new airline named Qikiqtani First Aviation. The new company provided services throughout Nunavut&#x27;s Qikiqtani Region using First Air&#x27;s fleet. Another airline, Sakku First Aviation, was started the same time in partnership with Sakku Investments Corporation in Nunavut&#x27;s Kivalliq Region.

In December 2011, Scott Bateman, President and CEO, abruptly resigned his position with First Air. Kris Dolinki became president and CEO after Bateman&#x27;s departure.

In October 2012, Dolinki resigned his position as president and CEO of First Air. This announcement came shortly after Makivik Corporation stated that, after many rumours, its stake in First Air was not for sale. The position of President and CEO was filled on an interim basis by Chris Ferris, First Air&#x27;s Vice President of Marketing and Sales.

In March 2013, First Air/Makivik Corporation hired Brock Friesen as its new president and CEO.

On 11 April 2014, the Makivik Corporation and Norterra, owners of Canadian North, began negotiations to merge the two airlines. According to a website set up the same day the new airline would be owned equally between the two companies and &quot;a merger would create a stronger, more sustainable business, provide better service to customers and lead to new economic development opportunities across the North - &quot;We believe the two companies would complement each other’s strengths.&quot; In October 2014, it was announced the merger would not go through, but First Air would still codeshare some flights with Canadian North.

In early 2015 First Air announced strategic agreements with Cargojet Airways and Summit Air. The 767 lease was transferred to Cargojet at that time and First Air was also providing ATR-72 turboprop services for Cargojet.

On 21 April 2015, First Air&#x27;s Hercules C-GUSI flew the final civilian L382 flight in Canada, bringing to an end over 45 years of commercial Lockheed Hercules service. L382 Hercules operations in Northern Canada were begun during the 1960s by Pacific Western Airlines.

On 1 June 2015, First Air began their codeshare flights with Calm Air ending their Kivalliq Regional Flights from Rankin Inlet to Arviat, Baker Lake, Coral Harbour, Repulse Bay, Whale Cove, and Chesterfield Inlet.

 In 2016, First Air/Bradley Air Services became the oldest airline in Canada still operating under its original name.

On 28 September 2018, Makivik Corporation and the Inuvialuit Corporate Group (ICG) signed a definitive agreement to merge Canadian North and First Air, awaiting government approval. The new airline would use the new First Air livery, but would operate under the name &quot;Canadian North&quot;. On 19 June 2019, the federal government gave approval to the merger provided several terms and conditions were met.

On 2 October 2018 First Air hired Chris Avery as the new CEO of First Air. He became the CEO of Canadian North after the merger was completed.

On 1 November 2019, First Air and Canadian North completed the merger and combined schedules. Operations were under the &quot;Canadian North&quot; name using the First Air branding. However, full integration was expected to take 12 to 18 months.

<doc id="351313" wikidata="Q945652" url="?curid=351313" title="John Madden (ice hockey)">
<text>John J. Madden (born May 4, 1973) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre. He played 13 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL), most prominently for the New Jersey Devils. An undrafted player from the University of Michigan (where he holds the NCAA record for most shorthanded goals in a single season with 10), he won the Stanley Cup three times during his NHL career: twice with the Devils and once with the Chicago Blackhawks. Madden was noted during his career for his ability to kill penalties, play both ends of the ice and score shorthanded goals.

Madden was regarded during his career as one of the league&#x27;s best defensive forwards; he was awarded the Frank J. Selke Trophy in 2001, and finished second in voting 2003, 2004 and 2008. His penalty-killing skills often generated breakaway chances while his team was shorthanded. Madden led the NHL and set a Devils&#x27; team record — and tied the NHL rookie record at the time, held by Gerry Minor (Vancouver Canucks, 1980–81) — by scoring six shorthanded goals during the 1999–2000 season.

After retiring as a player in 2012, he became a coach and scout for NHL teams, including the head coach position for the Columbus Blue Jackets&#x27; minor league affiliate, the Cleveland Monsters, for three seasons. He currently serves as an assistant coach for the NHL&#x27;s Utah Hockey Club (formerly the Arizona Coyotes). 

==Playing career==

===Early years===
Madden grew up in a public housing project, Parma Court, in Toronto. Madden is a graduate of the Victoria Village House League and has also played for a number of minor league teams, including the Don Mills Flyers, Scarborough Bruins, Hillcrest Summits, and the Junior &quot;C&quot; Alliston Hornets, before moving up to the Junior &quot;B&quot; Barrie Colts. During his second full season (1992–93) with the Colts, Madden set team records for assists (75) and points (124).

Madden was selected in the 11th round, 173rd overall, in the 1992 OHL Priority Selection by the Niagara Falls Thunder after a 104-point season with the Barrie Colts Jr. B. (OHA) team. Madden did not report to Niagara Falls, instead choosing to pursue an NCAA scholarship. After his second season in Barrie, when he scored 124 points in 43 games, he was still passed over in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft.

However, of the 286 players drafted that year, only 24 have played more career NHL games than the undrafted Madden (as of the end of the 2009–10 NHL season).

Madden played college hockey for the University of Michigan, playing in 160 games and scoring 80 goals and 100 assists for 180 points, with 123 penalty minutes. During his four-year career with the Wolverines, Madden set the NCAA record for most career shorthanded goals (23) and was a member of the 1995–96 championship team. In his final season at Michigan, he was named to both the CCHA First All-Star and NCAA West First All-American Teams. Madden&#x27;s teammates at Michigan included future NHL players Brendan Morrison, Mike Knuble, Blake Sloan, Marty Turco, Steve Shields, and Bill Muckalt.

The presence of Morrison, the Devils&#x27; second-round pick in 1993, proved fortuitous for Madden, whose strong work ethic was noticed by general manager Lou Lamoriello as he monitored Morrison&#x27;s college development. Lamoriello eventually offered Madden a contract, and he signed with the Devils as an amateur free agent on June 26, 1997.

===New Jersey Devils===
Madden spent the bulk of his first two professional seasons with the Albany River Rats of the American Hockey League (AHL). He led the River Rats in scoring during the 1998–99 season, setting team records for assists (60) and points (98). He made his NHL debut on January 6, 1999, against cross-town rivals the New York Rangers (one of four games he played for the Devils that season) and collected his first career NHL point on January 18, 1999, against the San Jose Sharks. He won a permanent spot on the Devils&#x27; roster the following season (1999–2000) and remained with the team through to the 2008–09 season.

On October 29, 2000, in a 9–0 victory against the Pittsburgh Penguins, Madden and Randy McKay became the first NHL teammates to each score four goals in one game since January 14, 1922. Over his career, Madden had thirty-two 2-point games, three 3-point games, one 4-point game and one 5-point game.

For most of his time with the Devils, Madden was paired with left wing player Jay Pandolfo, prompting many Devils fans to refer to this ubiquitous duo as &quot;Madolfo&quot;. The value of the Madden/Pandolfo partnership to the Devils was particularly notable after the 2004–05 NHL lockout. Despite the loss of defensive stalwarts Scott Stevens (retirement), Scott Niedermayer (free agency), and Ken Daneyko (retirement), as well as a series of rule changes designed to increase offence, the Devils have remained one of the NHL&#x27;s least scored on and least penalized teams.

On April 25, 2006, Madden completed his first career playoff hat-trick in a 4–1 win over the New York Rangers; two of his goals were shorthanded, tying an NHL record.

Madden was a member of the Devils&#x27; 1999–2000 and 2002–03 Stanley Cup champion clubs. After the retirement of long-time captain Scott Stevens before the 2005–06 season, the Devils abandoned the use of the captain&#x27;s &quot;C&quot; and instead used four alternate captains, drawing from a pool of Madden, Brian Rafalski, Colin White, Scott Gomez, Alexander Mogilny and Patrik Eliáš. Madden continued to wear the alternate captain&#x27;s &quot;A&quot;, except for a short time in the 2007–08 season, in which the &quot;A&quot; was given to Brian Gionta, Dainius Zubrus and Patrik Eliáš (Eliáš, after having the captaincy taken away). Once Jamie Langenbrunner, on December 5, 2007, was named captain, Madden once again was assigned the &quot;A&quot;, along with defenseman Colin White.
Madden scored his 100th career goal (regular season) on April 1, 2006, against the Philadelphia Flyers. Other career milestones included his 100th assist (October 18, 2006, against the Pittsburgh Penguins), 200th point (October 12, 2006, against the Toronto Maple Leafs), and 500th game (November 17, 2006, against the Ottawa Senators).

===Chicago Blackhawks===
As an unrestricted free agent on July 1, 2009, Madden signed a one-year contract with the Chicago Blackhawks worth $2.75 million. He won his third Stanley Cup with the Blackhawks that year.

===Minnesota Wild===
On August 6, 2010, Madden signed a one-year contract with the Minnesota Wild. While Madden scored 12 goals and 25 points in 76 games, the Wild failed to qualify for the playoffs.

===Florida Panthers===
On January 4, 2012, Madden signed a one-year contract with the Florida Panthers, joining former Blackhawks teammates Kris Versteeg, Brian Campbell and Tomáš Kopecký and former Devils teammate Scott Clemmensen. The Panthers clinched the playoffs for the first time in twelve years. Madden, however, recorded no points during the playoffs as they lost the first round to his former team, the New Jersey Devils, in seven games. 

Madden officially retired from the NHL on September 4, 2012.

==Post-retirement and coaching career==
On September 4, 2012, Madden retired from the NHL. The same day, he accepted a position with the Montreal Canadiens amateur player recruitment group for scouting and evaluating amateur free agent talent in American college hockey.

On November 8, 2013, Peter Horachek was named interim head coach for the Florida Panthers and hired Madden as an assistant coach. Madden would stay with the team as an assistant after under head coach Gerard Gallant. Madden was fired by the Panthers on May 13, 2016.

On August 29, 2016, Madden was named the head coach of the Cleveland Monsters, the AHL affiliate of the Columbus Blue Jackets. Madden replaced Jared Bednar, who had coached the team to winning the league championship the previous season before being hired as the head coach of the Colorado Avalanche. He coached the Monsters for three seasons and a 101–99–4–4 record before leaving the team.

Madden joined the San Jose Sharks as an assistant coach on September 22, 2020. He was relieved of his duties on July 1, 2022.

On July 26, 2022, Madden joined the Arizona Coyotes as an assistant coach.

==Personal life==
Madden and his wife Lauren have two children, Tyler and Reese. On June 23, 2018, Tyler Madden was drafted 68th overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft and was traded from the Canucks to the Los Angeles Kings in the 2019–20 season.

<doc id="351315" wikidata="Q7736846" url="?curid=351315" title="The Glory of Their Times">
<text>The Glory of Their Times: The Story of the Early Days of Baseball Told by the Men Who Played It is a 1966 book, edited by Lawrence Ritter, telling the stories of early 20th century baseball. It is widely acclaimed as one of the greatest books ever written about baseball.

==Preparation==
Ritter got the idea for the book in 1961 upon the death of Ty Cobb, and was also influenced by the works of John and Alan Lomax, who traveled the country in the 1930s and 1940s with tape recorders seeking out old and almost forgotten American folk songs.

Ritter realized that those who played baseball in the early years of the 20th century were now old men, and he resolved to interview as many of them as he could in order to record their memories. Ritter travelled 75,000 miles to interview his subjects, sitting for hours listening to them tell their tales into his tape recorder. The book retells their stories in the first-person, as they were told to Ritter.

==Publication==
The interviews were made between 1962 and 1966. The book was published in September 1966, following four years of research, interviews and preparation. An enlarged edition was issued in 1984, with the additions of George Gibson, Babe Herman, Specs Toporcer, and Hank Greenberg. A positive review by Wilfred Sheed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; Book Section helped propel the book, though it never hit the best-seller list. This book has been in print for most of the last 35 years, selling 360,000 copies, with royalties of nearly a quarter million dollars. Ritter presented royalties to the 22 men in the original book and their estates, and continued to write them checks into the mid-1980s. Ritter himself earned less than $35,000 on this classic. Every player in the book, along with his wife, has since died.

A vinyl album containing some of the actual recordings of the interviews was released in the 1970s. More recently, with the popularity of books-on-tape, longer versions of the recordings have been released on audiocassette and CD.

Crawford, Greenberg, Roush and Waner were already members of the Baseball Hall of Fame at the time of the book&#x27;s publishing. Coveleski, Goslin, Hooper and Marquard were elected after the book was published; Goslin and Marquard directly credited Ritter&#x27;s book. Toporcer, who died in 1989, was the last survivor among the interviewees. As part of Ritter&#x27;s research, he interviewed many ballplayers, baseball executives, and writers besides those who have chapters in his book. These individuals included Bill Veeck, Billy Werber, Benny Bengough, Marty McHale, Eliot Asinof, Fred Lieb, and George McBride.

A documentary film for &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot; was produced in 1971 by Ritter and Bud Greenspan, showing much of the still photography used in the book, along with vintage film footage and recordings from the audio tapes Ritter used in researching the book. After being rejected by commercial networks for several years due to Greenspan&#x27;s refusal to edit for length, the film aired on PBS television in 1977.

<doc id="351322" wikidata="Q6092045" url="?curid=351322" title="It Sticks Out Half a Mile">
<text>It Sticks Out Half a Mile is a British radio sitcom that was first broadcast on BBC Radio 2 from 1983 to 1984. Starring John Le Mesurier, Ian Lavender, Bill Pertwee and Vivienne Martin, the series served as a sequel to the television wartime sitcom &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, for which writers Harold Snoad and Michael Knowles had previously written radio adaptations.

Following the end of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, writers Snoad and Knowles wrote a pilot episode starring Arthur Lowe and John Le Mesurier, reprising their roles of Captain Mainwaring and Sergeant Wilson from that series. Recorded in 1981, the episode was left unbroadcast due to Lowe&#x27;s death in April 1982; it was subsequently broadcast for the first time in 2004 on BBC 7.

In consequence, Snoad and Knowles introduced Lavender and Pertwee, reprising their roles of Private Pike and Warden Hodges, and Vivienne Martin as secretary Miss Perkins, to produce a thirteen-episode series. The series followed the group&#x27;s attempts to renovate a near-decrepit pier in the seaside town of Frambourne-on-Sea. Ratings were strong enough for a second series to be commissioned. However, Le Mesurier&#x27;s death in November 1983 resulted in the series&#x27;s end.

The series spawned two television adaptations. The first, &quot;Walking the Planks&quot;, was broadcast on BBC1 in 1985. Despite achieving positive viewing figures, the pilot was not commissioned for a full series. In consequence, Snoad and Knowles took their concept to Yorkshire Television, who produced a seven-episode series titled &quot;High &amp; Dry&quot;, which ran for seven episodes in 1987.

==Plot==
&quot;It Sticks Out Half a Mile&quot; serves as a sequel series to the television wartime sitcom &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, which followed a platoon of Home Guard soldiers during the Second World War. The sequel series follows the lives of two of the members of the Home Guard platoon, the former Sergeant Arthur Wilson and Private Frank Pike, and their nemesis, the former Chief ARP Warden Hodges, three years after the war in 1948. 

Bert Hodges arrives in the seaside town of Frambourne-on-Sea (which is located on the same stretch of coastline as &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;&#x27;s Walmington-on-Sea, on the South Coast of England) with a plan to restore the town&#x27;s near-decrepit pier back to its former glory. To achieve this goal, Hodges meets Frank Pike, now twenty-two and working at Woolworths, to convince him to enter a partnership to raise the needed funds. Pike&#x27;s &quot;uncle&quot; (actually Pike&#x27;s father), Arthur Wilson, is now the bank manager of the Frambourne branch of Swallow&#x27;s Bank, so Hodges convinces Pike to ask Wilson for the £5,000 loan needed to purchase the pier. When Wilson refuses to invest such a sum of money in a such a venture, Pike blackmails Wilson over an affair that occurred when Wilson first moved to Frambourne. Wilson reluctantly agrees to give Hodges and Pike the loan, and the pier&#x27;s renovation begins, but not without its challenges. The trio are met with opposition from Fred Guthrie, the lone chief attendant in charge of supervising the pier, while Wilson must ward off the advances of Miss Perkins, the chief cashier at Swallow&#x27;s Bank, who is in love with him.

==Cast and characters==
=== Main ===
* John Le Mesurier as Arthur Wilson, a former Sergeant in the Home Guard, who is now the manager of the Frambourne-on-Sea branch of Swallow&#x27;s Bank. Possessing a calm and relaxed attitude to life, Wilson reluctantly acts as Pike and Hodges&#x27;s financial advisor upon their purchase of Frambourne Pier.
* Ian Lavender as Frank Pike, a former Home Guard Private who now works in ironmongery at Woolworths. A young, naïve man, and also a dreamer, he enters a partnership with Hodges to renovate Frambourne Pier. Pike&#x27;s age is incorrect in this series. When &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; began, it was set in 1940, and Pike was stated as being seventeen. However, eight years later in &quot;It Sticks Out Half a Mile&quot;, set in 1948, Pike is stated as being twenty-two, when he should actually be twenty-five.
* Bill Pertwee as Bert Hodges, a former Chief ARP Warden, who enters a partnership with Pike to renovate Frambourne Pier. An uncouth and brash man, he was previously Pike and Wilson&#x27;s rival during the war years, however, Hodges decides to work together with Pike and Wilson to renovate the pier. In a 1998 interview with Dave Homewood, the founder of the New Zealand branch of the Dad&#x27;s Army Appreciation Society, Bill Pertwee admitted that the character of Hodges was &quot;very different&quot; in this series, and agreed that he had become a &quot;bit less rough&quot;. Hodges&#x27;s first name in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; is William, but in &quot;It Sticks Out Half a Mile&quot;, his first name has changed to Bert.
* Vivienne Martin as Miss Perkins, the chief cashier at Swallow&#x27;s Bank. Known for her irritating laugh, she is in love with her manager, Wilson.

=== Recurring ===

* Glynn Edwards as Fred Guthrie, the chief attendant at Frambourne Pier. He complains of various ailments, including a perforated eardrum.
* Michael Knowles as Ernest Woolcot, a talkative know-all with a deep knowledge of piers.
* Hilda Braid as Mrs Briggs, a kindly widower.
* Janet Davies as Mavis Pike, Pike&#x27;s mother and Wilson&#x27;s secret lover.

==Episodes==
All episodes, including &quot;Loyal Support&quot;, the original pilot, were recorded at the Paris Studios in London. &quot;Loyal Support&quot; was produced by Jonathan James-Moore, while the regular series was produced by Martin Fisher.

===Series 1 (1983-84)===
==Production==
=== Development ===
When &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; ended after nine series in 1977, there were discussions about either continuing the series on the ITV network or for a sequel series to be produced which would follow the Walmington-on-Sea platoon as members of the town council in post-war Walmington. However, Harold Snoad and Michael Knowles instead submitted the idea for &quot;It Sticks Out Half a Mile&quot; to the BBC&#x27;s radio department. Initially, the writers had intended the series to be produced for television, but the BBC suggested that a radio series would be more appropriate. The idea was well-received, and a pilot episode was commissioned. 

The pilot episode, titled &quot;Loyal Support&quot;, starred Arthur Lowe and John Le Mesurier, reprising their roles of Captain Mainwaring and Sergeant Wilson respectively. The episode followed Mainwaring, who, returning from Switzerland with his wife, arrives in Frambourne-on-Sea and approaches Swallow&#x27;s Bank for a loan to purchase the town&#x27;s decrepit pier. He is shocked to discover that the bank manager is his former Home Guard Sergeant Arthur Wilson. Wilson, reluctantly, agrees to give Mainwaring his loan, and together they meet the local town council to purchase Frambourne Pier.

During the Second World War, seaside piers had sections removed from them in order to prevent German forces from using them to access the mainland. Shortly after the war, piers across the United Kingdom were dilapidated and poorly maintained; the series depicts this era in Britain&#x27;s post-war history.

Lowe had struggled to record the pilot, owing to his narcolepsy, which caused him to slur his words and fall asleep part way through recording; however, he and Le Mesurier enjoyed working with each other on the pilot and agreed to return to their roles once further episodes had been written. If the ratings were strong, the possibilities of adapting the series for television were discussed. Snoad and Knowles were writing the rest of the scripts for a full series when, on 15 April 1982, Arthur Lowe died. The series was shelved, the existing pilot episode was left unbroadcast, and the tape was wiped, but co-writer Snoad retained a copy which he later returned to the BBC. A short excerpt of this pilot was played on a documentary entitled &quot;The Archive Hour: Radio&#x27;s Lost Property&quot; on 1 November 2003, with the complete programme being heard on a BBC 7 compilation entitled &quot;Some of Our Archives Were Missing&quot; on 29 May 2004.

It was believed that the aborted series had ended; however, Lowe&#x27;s wife, actress Joan Cooper, assured Snoad and Knowles that the series should continue, since her husband had believed that it &quot;had so much potential&quot;. Snoad and Knowles thus convinced the BBC that the idea could still be viable, so a second pilot, titled &quot;The Business Proposition&quot;, was recorded on 11 September 1982, with Ian Lavender, Bill Pertwee and Vivienne Martin joining the cast. This being a success, twelve more episodes were commissioned as part of a thirteen-part series.

=== Writing ===
As part of their contracts with the BBC, Snoad and Knowles were obligated to write fifteen scripts for the series, even though two episodes were ultimately never recorded. The writing process began when Snoad and Knowles met to discuss the storylines for each episode. They would then separate, write an episode each, and meet again to discuss the episodes they had written. In consequence, the only episodes written by the two writers together were the original pilot, &quot;Loyal Support&quot;, and the second pilot, &quot;The Business Proposition&quot;. According to Michael Knowles, he was more adept at writing dialogue and Snoad was better at writing plots and storylines.

=== Aftermath ===
In a 1998 interview, Bill Pertwee, when prompted, believed that, had John Le Mesurier not died, the BBC &quot;probably would have done another series&quot;. This was supported by Lavender, who, in 1999, revealed that there were again discussions about adapting the series for television after the first series had aired. However, it was not until 2014 that news of a second series having been commissioned was confirmed. Producer Martin Fisher, speaking in a separate interview recorded before 2014, recalled that the first series &quot;went out and [was] quite popular&quot; with the public. Fisher was editing the final episode when he received the news that Le Mesurier had died, which &quot;spelt the end of a second series, which had already been commissioned&quot;.

The series was notable in that it featured some of Le Mesurier&#x27;s final performances, being the final radio series he recorded before his death on 15 November 1983, two days after the first episode, &quot;The Business Proposition&quot;, was broadcast. Pertwee later recalled, in May 2000, that the series &quot;was like one last get-together, one last party with great friends&quot;.

==Release==
===Broadcast and archival status===
The first nine episodes of the series were broadcast from 13 November 1983 to 15 January 1984 on Sunday afternoons at 1:30 pm. Each episode was repeated the following Friday at 10:00 pm, from 18 November 1983 to 20 January 1984. Later in the year, following a repeat airing of the first five episodes beginning 17 July 1984, the final four episodes of the series were broadcast from 21 August to 9 October 1984 at 10:30 pm.

Following its original airing and a repeat airing, the series was repeated for a second time on BBC Radio 2, but a mix-up between different departments of the BBC resulted in most of the broadcast tapes being wiped. Since the series was believed to be of no interest to an overseas audience, none of the episodes were preserved by the BBC Transcription Services. Off-air recordings of the series were unearthed during the BBC&#x27;s Treasure Hunt campaign, which were later broadcast by the digital radio archive channel BBC 7. Up until 2000, the only episodes held in the BBC archives were &quot;The Business Proposition&quot;, &quot;The Bank Loan&quot; and &quot;Pike in Love&quot;, in addition to the original pilot, &quot;Loyal Support&quot;, which had been returned by co-writer Harold Snoad prior to the BBC Treasure Hunt campaign.

===Media releases===
The original pilot and the first three episodes of the series were released in September 2010, on a compact disc titled &quot;Classic BBC Radio Comedy: It Sticks Out Half a Mile&quot;. A second CD, containing the next four episodes and titled &quot;It Sticks Out Half a Mile: Continued&quot;, was released in February 2012. Both were also released as audiobooks. The whole series, including the original pilot, was subsequently released as a CD and audiobook in October 2019.

The original pilot was released on the &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army: The Complete Radio Series: Series 3&quot; compact disc in May 2015. The pilot was also released on the collector&#x27;s edition of series three, released in March 2004.

==Reception==
Reception for the series was mixed, with reviewers praising the performances of the central actors yet criticising the show&#x27;s humour and its overall quality compared to &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;. According to Pertwee, large groups of people, many of whom were &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; fans, lined up to attend the recording for the first episode of the series on 11 September 1982, a rare occurrence for radio programmes at that time. Andrew Grimes, writing in the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; after the first episode had aired, described the series as an &quot;unexpected sequel&quot;. He praised Le Mesurier&#x27;s performance, but noted that his comedic mannerisms, perfectly suited for television, were lost due to the series being on radio. Grimes wrote that Le Mesurier was &quot;getting laughs that the dialogue did not by itself deserve&quot;, but observed that he was &quot;mugging for the benefit of the studio audience&quot; rather than for the general listening public. 

Conversely, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s Gillian Reynolds believed that the series &quot;tarnishe[d] the memory&quot; of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;. Although praising the &quot;worthy performances&quot; of the lead characters, she criticised the &quot;sad smut of the script&quot; and wrote that the series &quot;comes nowhere near to awakening that mixture of rueful nostalgia and ironic affection that &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; did so well&quot;.

In 2012, Graham McCann, in his biography on John Le Mesurier, wrote that, while the first episode was enjoyable, further episodes in the series would &quot;fall rather flat&quot;. However, he went on to acknowledge that &quot;the unforced rapport between Le Mesurier, Lavender and Pertwee kept the series sufficiently entertaining to justify it as a spin-off&quot;. In a 2021 article, Rhianna Evans from the British Comedy Guide wrote positively of the series, commenting that the central characters of Hodges, Pike and Wilson &quot;all remain very recognisable&quot; from their roles established in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;. She noted that the series possessed a &quot;character-driven, gentle-paced form of storytelling&quot;, and expressed admiration for the new characters introduced in the series, such as Miss Perkins and Guthrie, noting that &quot;the new cast don&#x27;t alter the style or tone of &quot;It Sticks Out Half A Mile&quot; from that laid down in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; at all&quot;. She concluded by writing that the series is &quot;a continuation of the &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; story that any fan would enjoy&quot;.

==Television adaptations==
There were two attempts to adapt &quot;It Sticks Out Half a Mile&quot; for television, without the &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; characters. The first attempt was a pilot episode for BBC1, titled &quot;Walking the Planks.&quot; Filmed on location at a real pier, it starred Michael Elphick as Ron Archer (Hodges&#x27;s equivalent), Richard Wilson as Richard Talbot (Wilson&#x27;s equivalent), Gary Raynsford as Trevor Archer (Pike&#x27;s equivalent) and Vivienne Martin as Talbot&#x27;s secretary, now called Miss Baxter. Despite being watched by eleven million viewers, the BBC did not commission a series.

In consequence, Knowles and Snoad took the concept to Yorkshire Television, who produced a seven-episode series titled &quot;High &amp; Dry&quot;. In the role previously performed by Elphick, Bernard Cribbins was cast, and Angus Barnett took over the role of Trevor Archer. Snoad and Knowles were unhappy with this series, since, unlike the pilot for the BBC, &quot;High &amp; Dry&quot; was filmed solely in the studio; they believed this was the reason the series lasted for only seven episodes.

<text>Wilbur Clyde Schwandt (June 28, 1904 in Manitowoc, Wisconsin – July 23, 1998 in Miami, Florida) was an American musician best known for his song &quot;Dream a Little Dream of Me&quot; with Fabian Andre and Gus Kahn. He frequently used the stage name Don Swan and released many Latin jazz albums in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Career==
Born in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, on June 28, 1904, he studied composition at the University of Chicago and became an arranger for various big bands, including comedian Bob Hope&#x27;s touring show. In 1940, he became an arranger for Xavier Cugat&#x27;s orchestra, a position he would hold for the next 20 years. He was an arranger and composer for Latin lounge musicians such as Skinnay Ennis and Freddy Martin as well as Latin dance musicians such as Perez Prado and Desi Arnaz.

In the late 1950s Schwandt was signed to Liberty Records as a recording artist and recorded five Latin lounge LPs, beginning with &quot;Mucho Cha Cha Cha&quot;. Subsequent LPs like &quot;All This and Cha Cha Too&quot;, &quot;Hot Cha Cha&quot;, and two volumes of &quot;Latino!&quot; featured an all-star ensemble of west coast musicians. The success of his albums allowed Swan to form a touring group with whom he played extensively in New York City and Las Vegas.

Schwandt retired from music in the mid-1960s and eventually moved to Miami, Florida, where he died July 23, 1998, at the age of 94.

<text>Barbara Charline Jordan (February 21, 1936 – January 17, 1996) was an American lawyer, educator, and politician. A Democrat, she was the first African American elected to the Texas Senate after Reconstruction, the first Southern African-American woman elected to the United States House of Representatives, and one of the first two African Americans elected to the U.S. House from the former Confederacy since 1901, alongside Andrew Young of Georgia.

Jordan achieved fame for delivering a powerful opening statement at the House Judiciary Committee hearings during the impeachment process against Richard Nixon. In 1976, she became the first African American, and the first woman, to deliver a keynote address at a Democratic National Convention. Jordan is also known for her work as chair of the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform. She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, among numerous other honors. She was the first African-American woman to be buried in the Texas State Cemetery.

== Early life ==
Barbara Charline Jordan was born in Houston, Texas&#x27;s Fifth Ward. Jordan&#x27;s childhood was centered on church life at the Good Hope Missionary Baptist Church. Her mother was Arlyne Patten Jordan, a teacher in the church and a maid, and her father was Benjamin Jordan, a Baptist preacher and a warehouse worker. Jordan would recite poetry at the church and would sing gospel music with her sisters. In 1949, Jordan&#x27;s father joined the Greater Pleasant Hill Baptist Church as the full-time pastor.

Through her mother, Jordan was the great-granddaughter of Edward Patton, who was one of the last African American members of the Texas House of Representatives prior to disenfranchisement of Black Texans under Jim Crow. Barbara Jordan was the youngest of three children, with siblings Rose Mary Jordan McGowan and Bennie Creswell Jordan (1933–2000).

Jordan attended Roberson Elementary School. She graduated from Phillis Wheatley High School in 1952 with honors. At Wheatley, Jordan&#x27;s linguistic abilities were developed through the support of her teachers and curriculum. Major influences included her English teacher Mrs. D. B. Reid, elocutionist Ashton J. Oliver, and speech and drama teacher Robert T. Holland.

Jordan credited a speech she heard in her high school years by Edith S. Sampson with inspiring her to become an attorney. Because of segregation, she could not attend the University of Texas at Austin and instead chose Texas Southern University, a historically black institution, majoring in political science and history. At Texas Southern University, Jordan was a national champion debater, learning from her coach, Thomas Freeman, and defeating opponents from Yale and Brown, and tying Harvard University. She graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1956. At Texas Southern University, she pledged Delta Gamma chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority. She attended Boston University School of Law, graduating in 1959.

Jordan taught political science at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama for a year. In 1960, she returned to Houston and started a private law practice. During that time in Texas, there were only two black women attorneys, one being Jordan, who was twenty-four years old. To start off her career, Jordan became the first Black woman to work as an administrative assistant to a county judge, Bill Elliott. Jordan began her work in politics in 1960 when she became a volunteer for the John F. Kennedy-Lyndon B. Johnson campaign, traveling to African American churches in Houston to encourage people to vote. 

== Political career ==

=== Texas Senate ===
Jordan campaigned unsuccessfully in 1962 and 1964 for the Texas House of Representatives. Along with Curtis Graves and Joe Lockridge, she was one of three African American members elected in 1966 to the Texas Legislature, the first ones since 1896. With Jordan elected to the Texas Senate, she became the first black woman to serve in that body. She served the Eleventh Senate District in Houston, which had just been created after Kilgarlin v. Martin (1965) in which the federal court demanded redistricting of the Texas Legislature because densely populated urban areas were underrepresented in comparison to rural areas. In a speech at Rice University following the district&#x27;s creation, but before her election, Jordan said, &quot;For the first time in Texas, we are going to have legislators who represent people, not cattle.&quot;

The Texas Senate in 1966 consisted of thirty-one white men and Jordan. With Jordan experiencing racism and sexism from her colleagues, Houston community members were unsure of how much of a difference Jordan could make serving in the Senate. Aware of the challenges she would face, Jordan&#x27;s goal was to be respected by the white conservatives in the Senate. One of the ways she accomplished this was by befriending Dorsey Hardeman, who was seen as the most powerful man in the body, and Lieutenant Governor Ben Barnes. Jordan ran as a liberal Democrat, but she had strong relationships with the conservative wing of the Texas Democratic Party. Her efforts in her first term led to her being unanimously elected as outstanding freshman member by her colleagues.

Re-elected to a full term in the Texas Senate in 1968, Jordan served until 1972. She was the first African-American woman to serve as president &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the state senate and served one day, June 10, 1972, as acting governor of Texas. Jordan was the first African-American woman to serve as governor of a state. Additionally, Jordan was nominated to serve on federal commissions by President Lyndon Johnson after she was elected to the Senate; the commissions worked on housing and income maintenance. During her time in the Texas Legislature, Jordan sponsored or cosponsored some 70 bills. Jordan was an advocate for her constituents and the working class while in the Texas Senate. Some of her accomplishments include developing Texas&#x27; first minimum wage law and funding programs to fight against hate crimes.

Jordan&#x27;s influence in the Senate and her relationship with Lieutenant Governor Ben Barnes shaped her path to U.S. Congress. Redistricting of Texas began after the 1970 census, which included the possibility of a new congressional seat in Houston. Barnes named Jordan vice-chair of the redistricting committee, and this resulted in Jordan having the ability to draw her own district, the Eighteenth Congressional District. Jordan received 81% of the vote in 1972 to win the Democratic nomination to the U.S. House seat.

=== U.S. House of Representatives ===
In 1972, Jordan was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, the first woman elected in her own right to represent Texas in the House. She received extensive support from former President Lyndon B. Johnson, who helped her secure a position on the House Judiciary Committee. In 1974, she made an influential televised speech before the House Judiciary Committee supporting the impeachment of President Richard Nixon, Johnson&#x27;s successor as president. In 1975, she was appointed by Carl Albert, then Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, to the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee.

In 1976, Jordan, mentioned as a possible running mate to Jimmy Carter of Georgia, became instead the first African-American woman to deliver a keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. Despite not being a candidate, Jordan received one delegate vote (0.03%) for president at the Convention.

In November 1977, Barbara Jordan spoke at the 1977 National Women&#x27;s Conference in Houston, Texas. Other speakers included Rosalynn Carter, Betty Ford, Lady Bird Johnson, Bella Abzug, Audrey Colom, Claire Randall, Gerridee Wheeler, Cecilia Burciaga, Gloria Steinem, Lenore Hershey and Jean O&#x27;Leary.

=== American Oratory and Statement on Articles of Impeachment ===

On July 25, 1974, Jordan delivered a 15-minute televised speech in front of the members of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee during the hearings that were part of the impeachment process against Richard Nixon. That speech has been ranked 13th among the 100 best American political speeches of the 20th century.

Throughout her Judiciary Committee impeachment speech, Jordan strongly stood by the Constitution of the United States. She defended the checks and balances system, which was set in place to inhibit any politician from abusing their power. Jordan never directly said that she wanted Nixon impeached, but rather subtly and cleverly implied her thoughts. She stated facts that proved Nixon to be untrustworthy and heavily involved in illegal situations, and quoted the drafters of the Constitution to argue that actions like Nixon&#x27;s during the scandal corresponded with their understanding of impeachable offenses. She protested that the Watergate scandal would forever ruin the trust American citizens have for their government. This powerful and influential statement earned Jordan national praise for her rhetoric, morals, and wisdom. Further, both conservatives and liberals liked Jordan because of her appeal to the American Dream and her positions on Watergate and the Voting Rights Act respectively.

=== 1976 Democratic National Convention Keynote ===
On July 12, 1976, Jordan delivered a historic keynote address at the 1976 Democratic National Convention. This address was the first time a major political party&#x27;s nominating convention had an African American as the keynote speaker. Jordan was chosen as a speaker because she was a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee and made an impact with her remarks during the impeachment process of Nixon. Additionally, Jordan represented the Democratic party&#x27;s progress and acceptance of minorities as a black woman. Jordan&#x27;s usage of American values in her address, primarily national unity, American traditions, and the importance of politicians as responsible public servants, appealed to the general public and led to a largely positive reaction. At Madison Square Garden, where the convention was held, Jordan&#x27;s address ended with a 5-minute standing ovation, and during her speech, the audience interrupted with applause 20 times.

Many delegates wanted Jordan to become Jimmy Carter&#x27;s running mate and wore ‘‘Barbara Jordan for Vice President’’ buttons the following day of the convention. One of the messages of Jordan&#x27;s speech was support for the Democratic Party, including what they have done in the past and what they could accomplish in the future. Some have linked Jordan&#x27;s speech and her support of the Democratic Party as playing a role in Carter&#x27;s election win, with Carter winning 92% of the African American vote. During a time of unrest, following the Watergate scandal and the Vietnam war, Carter hoped to unite both the Democratic Party and the country, and Carter tasked Jordan with helping him accomplish this goal at the convention.

=== Legislation ===

Jordan supported the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, legislation that required banks to lend and make services available to underserved poor and minority communities. She supported the renewal of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and expansion of that act to cover language minorities; this extended protection to Hispanics in Texas and was opposed by Texas Governor Dolph Briscoe and Secretary of State Mark White. The original version of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 included section 5, which required that changes to voting laws in certain jurisdictions were required to be reviewed by the Attorney General or the United States District Court, but this did not apply to Texas because the state was not included in the determined jurisdictions. The law changed to include Texas under the expanded version along with the requirement of bilingual ballots for areas where &quot;more than five percent of the population&quot; spoke a language other than English.

She also authored an act that ended federal authorization of price fixing by manufacturers. Jordan was also a proponent of the Equal Rights Amendment and issued a statement in support of extending the deadline in 1979. During Jordan&#x27;s tenure as a Congresswoman, she sponsored or cosponsored over 300 bills or resolutions, several of which are still in effect today as law.

=== Post-political career ===
Jordan retired from politics in 1978 due to poor health and became an adjunct professor teaching at the University of Texas at Austin Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. She was again a keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention in 1992.

In 1994, Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the NAACP presented her with the Spingarn Medal. She was honored many times and was given over 20 honorary degrees from institutions across the country, including Harvard and Princeton, and was elected to the Texas and National Women&#x27;s Halls of Fame.
=== U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform ===
From 1994 until her death, Jordan chaired the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform; she was appointed by President Bill Clinton. The commission recommended that total immigration be cut by one-third to approximately 550,000 per year. The commission supported increasing enforcement against undocumented migrants and their employers, eliminating visa preferences for siblings and adult children of U.S. citizens, and ending unskilled immigration except for refugees and nuclear families. The commission&#x27;s report to Congress said that it was &quot;a right and responsibility of a democratic society to manage immigration so that it serves the national interest&quot;, concluded that &quot;legal immigration has strengthened and can continue to strengthen this country&quot; and &quot;decrie[d] hostility and discrimination against immigrants as antithetical to the traditions and interests of the country.&quot; The commission recommended that the United States reduce the number of refugees admitted annually to a floor of 50,000 (this level would be lifted during emergencies).

The recommendations made by the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform under Jordan&#x27;s leadership are frequently cited by American immigration restrictionists.
== Personal life ==
=== Relationships ===

While Jordan never publicly identified herself as lesbian or queer, the U.S. National Archives has referred to her as the first LGBTQ+ woman to serve in the United States Congress.

Jordan and Nancy Earl shared a home in Austin, Texas and maintained a close bond for 20 years. Jordan&#x27;s political career was often shadowed by homophobic attacks, with advisors cautioning against the visibility of her personal relationships. With their advice, Jordan&#x27;s openness about her sexual orientation was limited to private settings. Jordan held a negative view on marriage and viewed it as a life of subservience. She believed that her family would accept her choice to be single only if she had a successful career.

=== Health ===

Barbara Jordan developed multiple sclerosis in 1973, during her first year in Congress.

On July 31, 1988, Jordan nearly drowned in her backyard swimming pool while doing physical therapy. She was saved by Earl, who found her floating in the pool and revived her. By 1992, Jordan was confined to a wheelchair due to her sclerosis.

In the KUT-FM radio documentary &quot;Rediscovering Barbara Jordan&quot;, President Bill Clinton said that he had wanted to nominate Jordan for the United States Supreme Court, but that Jordan&#x27;s health problems prevented him from doing so.

== Death and burial ==

Jordan died at the Austin Diagnostic Medical Center in Austin, Texas, on January 17, 1996, at the age of 59. Her cause of death was complications from pneumonia and leukemia. She had battled multiple sclerosis for several years before her death.

Jordan was interred in Texas State Cemetery. She was the first African American to receive this honor. During her tenure in the Texas State Senate, Jordan had advocated for African Americans to be buried in the state cemetery. Jordan&#x27;s grave rests near that of the &quot;Father of Texas&quot;, Stephen F. Austin.

In the years following Jordan&#x27;s passing, more African Americans would receive the honor of being buried in the Texas State Cemetery as well, including musical artists James Henry Cotton and Barbara Smith Conrad.

<text>Whanganui (; ), also spelt Wanganui, is a city in the Manawatū-Whanganui region of New Zealand. The city is located on the west coast of the North Island at the mouth of the Whanganui River, New Zealand&#x27;s longest navigable waterway. Whanganui is the 19th most-populous urban area in New Zealand and the second-most-populous in Manawatū-Whanganui, with a population of as of .

Whanganui is the ancestral home of Te Āti Haunui-a-Pāpārangi and other Whanganui Māori tribes. The New Zealand Company began to settle the area in 1840, establishing its second settlement after Wellington. In the early years, most European settlers came via Wellington. Whanganui greatly expanded in the 1870s, and freezing works, woollen mills, phosphate works and wool stores were established in the town. Today, much of Whanganui&#x27;s economy relates directly to the fertile and prosperous farming hinterland.

Like several New Zealand urban areas, it was officially designated a city until an administrative reorganisation in 1989, and is now run by Whanganui District Council.

==Toponymy==
&quot;Whanga nui&quot; is a Māori language phrase meaning &quot;big bay&quot; or &quot;big harbour&quot;. The first name of the European settlement was &quot;Petre&quot; (pronounced Peter), after Lord Petre, an officer of the New Zealand Company, but it was never popular and was officially changed to &quot;Wanganui&quot; in 1854.

===Controversy over Wanganui/Whanganui spelling===
In the local dialect, Māori pronounce the &quot;wh&quot; in &quot;Whanganui&quot; as , a voiced labial–velar approximant combined with a glottal stop, but to non-locals the name sounds like &quot;Wanganui&quot; and is hard to reproduce.

In 1991, the New Zealand Geographic Board considered demands from some local Māori to change the name of the river to &quot;Whanganui&quot;. During a three-month consultation period, the Wanganui District Council was asked for its views and advised the Board that it opposed the change. Letters of both support and opposition were received during this time. After some deliberation, the Board decided to change the spelling of the river&#x27;s name from &quot;Wanganui&quot; to &quot;Whanganui&quot;.

A non-binding referendum was held in Wanganui in 2006, where 82% voted to retain the city&#x27;s name &quot;Wanganui&quot; without an &#x27;h&#x27;. Turnout was 55.4%. Despite the clear results, the spelling of the name continued to be surrounded by significant controversy.

Iwi group Te Rūnanga o Tupoho applied to the New Zealand Geographic Board to change the city&#x27;s name to &quot;Whanganui&quot; in February 2009, and in late March the Board found there were grounds for the change. The public was given three months to comment on the proposed change, beginning in mid-May. The public submissions were relatively equal, with a slim majority in favour of keeping the status quo. Wanganui Mayor Michael Laws spoke strongly against the proposed change. A second referendum was held in Wanganui in May 2009, and residents again overwhelmingly rejected changing the city&#x27;s name, with 22% voting to change it to &quot;Whanganui&quot; and 77% voting to retain the name as &quot;Wanganui&quot;. Voter turnout was 61%, the highest in a Wanganui referendum, reflecting the widespread controversy. Recognising that the decision was ultimately political in nature, not linguistic, in September 2009 the Geographic Board handed the decision to the Minister for Land Information. Despite the referendum results, the Geographic Board recommended to the Minister that the name should be spelt &quot;Whanganui&quot;. In December 2009, the government decided that while either spelling was acceptable, Crown agencies would use the spelling &quot;Whanganui&quot;, amending the act to allow other official documents to use &quot;Wanganui&quot;, as an alternative official name, if desired.

On 17 November 2015 Land Information New Zealand &quot;Toitū te whenua&quot; (LINZ) announced that Wanganui District would be renamed to Whanganui District. This changed the official name of the District Council, and, because Whanganui is not a city council but a district, the official name of the urban area as well. On 19 November 2015, the name change was officially gazetted. In September 2019, the region that Whanganui District Council is part of was renamed from Manawatu-Wanganui to Manawatū-Whanganui.

==History==

===Māori settlement===
The area around the mouth of the Whanganui river was a major site of pre-European Māori settlement. The pā named Pūtiki (a contraction of &quot;Pūtikiwharanui&quot;) was and is home to the Ngāti Tupoho hapū of the iwi Te Āti Haunui-a-Pāpārangi. It took its name from the legendary explorer Tamatea Pōkai Whenua, who sent a servant ashore to find flax for tying up his topknot (&quot;pūtiki&quot;).

In the 1820s, coastal tribes in the area assaulted the Kapiti Island stronghold of Ngāti Toa chief Te Rauparaha. Te Rauparaha retaliated in 1830, sacking Pūtiki and slaughtering the inhabitants.

===European settlement===

The first European traders arrived in 1831, followed in 1840 by missionaries Octavius Hadfield and Henry Williams who collected signatures for the Treaty of Waitangi. On 20 June 1840, the Revd John Mason, Mrs Mason, Mr Richard Matthews (a lay catechist) and his wife Johanna arrived to establish a mission station of the Church Missionary Society (CMS). The Revd Richard Taylor joined the CMS mission station in 1843. The Revd Mason drowned on 5 January 1843 while crossing the Turakina River. By 1844 the brick church built by Mason was inadequate to meet the needs of the congregation, and it had been damaged in an earthquake. A new church was built under the supervision of Taylor, with the timber supplied by each pā on the river in proportion to its size and number of Christians.

After the New Zealand Company had settled Wellington it looked for other suitable places for settlers. William Wakefield, younger brother of Edward Gibbon Wakefield, negotiated the sale of 40,000 acres in 1840, and a town named Petre – after Lord Petre, one of the directors of the New Zealand Company – was established four kilometres from the river mouth. The settlement was threatened in 1846 by Te Mamaku, a chief from up the Whanganui River. The British military arrived on 13 December 1846 to defend the township. Two stockades, the Rutland and York, were built to defend the settlers. Two minor battles were fought on 19 May and 19 July 1847 and after a stalemate the up river iwi returned home. By 1850, Te Mamaku was receiving Christian instruction from Revd Taylor. There were further incidents in 1847 when four members of the Gilfillan family were murdered and their house plundered.
The name of the city was officially changed to Wanganui on 20 January 1854. The early years of the new city were problematic. Purchase of land from the local tribes had been haphazard and irregular, and as such, many Māori were angered by the influx of Pākehā onto land that they still claimed. It was not until the town had been established for eight years that agreements were finally reached between the colonials and local tribes, and some resentment continued (and still filters through to the present day).
Wanganui grew rapidly after this time, with land being cleared for pasture. The town was a major military centre during the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s, although local Māori at Pūtiki led by Te Keepa Te Rangihiwinui remained friendly to settlers. In 1871, a town bridge was built, followed six years later by a railway bridge at Aramoho. Wanganui was linked by rail to both New Plymouth and Wellington by 1886. The town was incorporated as a Borough on 1 February 1872, with William Hogg Watt the first Mayor. It was then declared a city on 1 July 1924.

====Wanganui Women&#x27;s Political League====
As an alternative to the Wanganui chapter of the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union of New Zealand, Margaret Bullock formed a club for women activists in 1893, originally as the Wanganui Women&#x27;s Franchise League. Ellen Ballance, the second wife of the former Premier John Ballance was the inaugural president until she left for England. Bullock then served as president when the franchise for women was won and the organisation&#x27;s name changed to the Women&#x27;s Political League. The membership rolls reached to nearly 3000 at its height. Monthly meetings focused on feminist scholarly inquiry, and Ellen Ballance donated her husband&#x27;s library to the club. Bullock and Jessie Williamson led the club&#x27;s connections with the National Council of Women of New Zealand. By 1903, a year in which Bullock died and Williamson moved to Christchurch, the club&#x27;s activities had declined and its library collection was donated to the local public library.

===20th century===

Perhaps Wanganui&#x27;s biggest scandal happened in 1920, when Mayor Charles Mackay shot and wounded a young poet, Walter D&#x27;Arcy Cresswell, who had been blackmailing him over his homosexuality. Mackay served seven years in prison and his name was erased from the town&#x27;s civic monuments, while Cresswell (himself homosexual) was praised as a &quot;wholesome-minded young man&quot;. Mackay&#x27;s name was restored to the foundation stone of the Sarjeant Gallery in 1985.

The Whanganui River catchment is seen as a sacred area to Māori, and the Whanganui region is still seen as a focal point for any resentment over land ownership. In 1995, Moutoa Gardens in Wanganui, known to local Māori as &quot;Pakaitore&quot;, were occupied for 79 days in a mainly peaceful protest by the Whanganui iwi over land claims.

Wanganui was the site of the New Zealand Police Law Enforcement System (LES) from 1976 to 1995. An early Sperry mainframe computer-based intelligence and data management system, it was known colloquially as the &quot;Wanganui Computer&quot;. The data centre housing it was subject to New Zealand&#x27;s highest-profile suicide bombing on 18 November 1982 when anarchist Neil Roberts detonated a gelignite bomb in the entry foyer. Roberts was the only casualty of the bombing.

==Geography==
Whanganui is on the South Taranaki Bight, close to the mouth of the Whanganui River. It is north of Wellington and northwest of Palmerston North, at the junction of State Highways 3 and 4. Most of the city lies on the river&#x27;s northwestern bank, because of the greater extent of flat land. The river is crossed by five bridges: Cobham Bridge, City Bridge, Dublin Street Bridge and Aramoho Railway Bridge (rail and pedestrians only) and a Cycle bridge which was opened in 2020.

Both Mount Ruapehu and Mount Taranaki can be seen from Durie Hill and other vantage points around the city.

===Suburbs and localities===
The suburbs within Whanganui include (clockwise from central Watt Fountain):

*Northeast: Whanganui East, Bastia Hill, Aramoho
*East: Durie Hill
*South: Pūtiki
*West: Gonville, Castlecliff, Tawhero
*Northwest: Springvale St Johns Hill, Otamatea

===Climate===

Whanganui enjoys a temperate climate, with slightly above the national average sunshine (2100 hours per annum), and about of annual rainfall. Several light frosts are normally experienced in winter. The river is prone to flooding after heavy rain in the catchment, and in June 2015 record flooding occurred with 100 households evacuated. Whanganui&#x27;s climate is particularly moderate. In 2012, the Federated Farmers Whanganui president, Brian Doughty, said the district&#x27;s temperate climate meant any type of farming was viable. 

==Demographics==
The Whanganui urban area had a population of 39,720 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 3,078 people (8.4%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 1,992 people (5.3%) since the 2006 census (the population decreased between the 2006 and 2013 censuses). There were 18,930 males and 20,793 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.91 males per female. Of the total population, 7,854 people (19.8%) were aged up to 15 years, 6,867 (17.3%) were 15 to 29, 16,551 (41.7%) were 30 to 64, and 8,445 (21.3%) were 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 78.0% European/Pākehā, 27.2% Māori, 3.8% Pacific peoples, 4.5% Asian, and 1.7% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities).
==Economy==
In 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, Whanganui was included in the world&#x27;s Smart21 Intelligent Communities by the Intelligent Community Forum.

Whanganui has a strong industry base, with a history of niche manufacturing. Current businesses include Q-West Boat Builders, based at the Port who have built boats for customers from around New Zealand and the world and were awarded a contract in 2015 to build two 34-meter passenger ferries for Auckland ferry company Fullers. Pacific Helmets is another example of award-winning niche manufacturing in the district, winning a Silver Pin at the Best Design Awards in October 2015. Heads Road is Whanganui&#x27;s main industrial area and is home to a number of manufacturing and engineering operations. The Wanganui Port, once the centre of industrial transport, still has some traffic but is more noted for the Q-West boat building operation there. F. Whitlock &amp; Sons Ltd was a notable company, first established in 1902.

Much of Whanganui&#x27;s economy relates directly to the fertile and prosperous farming hinterland near the town. Whanganui is well known for embracing the production of several new pear varieties, including the Crimson Gem. In May 2016, it was reported that the majority of the Whanganui pear crop had been wiped out before the upcoming pear season.

==Whanganui District==
The Whanganui District covers , the majority of which is hill country, with a narrow coastal strip of flat land and a major urban settlement on the lower banks of the Whanganui River. A large proportion of this is within the Whanganui National Park, established in 1986.

The region is known for its outstanding natural environment, with the Whanganui Awa (River) at its heart. It is the second-largest river in the North Island, the longest navigable waterway in the country, and runs for from the heights of Mount Tongariro to Wanganui&#x27;s coast and the Tasman Sea. Every bend and rapid of the river (there are 239 listed rapids) has a guardian, or kaitiaki, who maintains the mauri (life force) of that stretch of the river.

Whanganui hapū (sub-tribes) were renowned for their canoeing skills and maintained extensive networks of weirs and fishing traps along the River. Generations of river iwi have learned to use and protect this great taonga (treasure), and on 13 September 2012 the Whanganui River became the first river in the world to gain recognition as a legal identity.

Today the river and its surrounds are used for a number of recreational activities, including kayaking, jet boating, tramping, cycling and camping. A national cycleway has recently opened, which takes cyclists from the &#x27;mountains to the sea&#x27;.

In the local government reorganisation of the 1980s, Wanganui District Council resulted from the amalgamation in 1989 of Wanganui County Council, most of Waitotara County Council, a small part of Stratford County Council, and Wanganui City Council. Hamish McDouall was elected mayor in the 2016 local government elections.

All but some people in the Whanganui District live in the township itself, meaning there are few prominent outlying settlements. A small but notable village is Jerusalem, which was home to Mother Mary Joseph Aubert and the poet James K. Baxter.

The Whanganui District is also home to other settlements with small populations, including Kaitoke, Upokongaro, Kai Iwi/Mowhanau, Aberfeldy, Westmere, Pākaraka, Marybank, Okoia and Fordell.

==Culture==
===Cultural institutions===
Whanganui has a strong cultural and recreational focus. Queen&#x27;s Park (Pukenamu) in the central township has several cultural institutions, including the Sarjeant Gallery, the Whanganui Regional Museum, the Davis Library, the Alexander Heritage and Research Library, and the Whanganui War Memorial Centre. Whanganui is home to New Zealand&#x27;s only glass school and is renowned for its glass art.

===Sarjeant Gallery collection===
There are more than 8,000 artworks in the gallery, initially focused on 19th- and early 20th-century British and European art but, given the expansive terms of the will of benefactor Henry Sarjeant, the collection now spans the 16th century through to the 21st century. Among the collections are historic and modern works in all media – on paper, sculptures, pottery, ceramics and glass; bronze works; video art; and paintings by contemporary artists and old masters. The Gallery holds notable works by Edward Coley Burne-Jones, Domenico Piola, Frank Brangwyn, Bernardino Poccetti, Gaspard Dughet, William Richmond, William Etty, Lelio Orsi, Frederick Goodall, Augustus John and others. Its New Zealand holdings include six works by Wanganui artist Herbert Ivan Babbage and a major collection of works by the Whanganui-born Edith Collier.

===Whanganui Regional Museum collection===
The Whanganui Regional Museum collection has been growing since the first items were displayed in Samuel Henry Drew&#x27;s shop window in Victoria Avenue. It includes artwork by John Tiffin Stewart.

===Potters===
Potters have a long history of working in the area, such as Rick Rudd, Paul Rayner and Ivan Vostinar.

===Glass artists===
Local glass artists include Kathryn Wightman, Lisa Walsh, and Claudia Borella.

===Theatre===
A repertory group has been active in the town since 1933.

===Opera===
Since 1994, The New Zealand Opera School has been hosted at Whanganui Collegiate School.

==Landmarks and buildings==

Pukenamu–Queens Park in central Whanganui, formerly the hilltop location of the Rutland Stockade, is home to several iconic buildings. The Sarjeant Gallery, a Category I Historic Place, was a bequest to the town by local farmer Henry Sarjeant, and opened in 1919. Since 2014, it has been in temporary premises on Taupo Quay while the heritage building is strengthened and redeveloped. The Whanganui Regional Museum (1928) and the Alexander Heritage and Research Library (1933) were both bequests of the Alexander family. The award-winning Whanganui War Memorial Hall (1960) is one of New Zealand&#x27;s finest examples of modernist architecture.

The Royal Whanganui Opera House is located in St Hill Street in central Whanganui.

Stewart House on the corner of Campbell and Plymouth Streets is now a private home, but it was formerly the Karitane Home and later a boarding residence for secondary school students. It was built for philanthropist John Tiffin Stewart and social activist Frances Ann Stewart.

There are two large towers overlooking Whanganui: the Durie Hill War Memorial Tower and the Bastia Hill Water Tower. The Durie Hill Tower is a World War I memorial, unveiled in 1926. Nearby is the Durie Hill Elevator (1919), which links the hilltop with Anzac Parade via a elevator and a tunnel. South of Whanganui is the Cameron Blockhouse.
Rotokawau Virginia Lake, located on St John&#x27;s Hill, is a historic lake with a fountain, Art Deco conservatory and winter garden.

== Local attractions ==

=== Bason Botanic Gardens ===

These gardens are located northwest from Whanganui and are set on in a relatively frost-free environment. They were founded in 1966 by Stanley and Blanche Bason who gave their farm to the city council for the purpose of creating a botanical reserve. The gardens have six themed areas, including one of the most extensive public-garden orchid collections in the country, and have been rated as a Garden of Significance by the New Zealand Gardens Trust.

=== Bushy Park Tarapuruhi ===

Bushy Park is a lowland rainforest remnant of approximately located from Kai Iwi, north of Whanganui. It is a predator-free native bird sanctuary. The sanctuary is free to visit during daylight hours. The park also features an Edwardian-era homestead, which is a Category 1 heritage building registered with Heritage New Zealand.

==Sports==
===Rugby===
The Wanganui Rugby Football Union is one of the oldest rugby unions in New Zealand.

Wanganui has never held the country&#x27;s top trophy, the Ranfurly Shield.

On 10 August 1966, a combined Wanganui and King Country team beat the British and Irish Lions 12 points to 6 at Spriggens Park.

In 2008, the Wanganui representative rugby team, under the captaincy of David Gower, won the NZRFU&#x27;s Heartland Championship Meads Cup by defeating Mid Canterbury 27–12 in the final. They had previously been the defeated finalist in 2006 and 2007. The 2008 side had an undefeated season – the first since 1947. The rugby squad, including coach and management, was accorded the honour of &#x27;Freedom of the City&#x27; by the Whanganui District Council – the first time the award had been given to any sporting team.

The 2009 representative team repeated this feat by regaining the Meads Cup – again defeating Mid Canterbury in the final by 34 points to 13 (after trailing nil-13 at halftime). Unlike 2008, the 2009 team did some lose games (to Wellington, Wairarapa Bush and Mid Canterbury) but came good at the business end of the season. Ten Whanganui players were selected for the New Zealand Heartland XV.

The Wanganui rugby jersey, due to its resemblance, is known as the butcher&#x27;s apron.

The Whanganui environs have produced many All Blacks including:

*Moke Belliss (1920–23).
*John Blair (1897).
*George Bullock-Douglas (1932–34).
*Andrew Donald (1981–84).
*Keith Gudsell (1949). He also played three tests for the Wallabies.
*Andy Haden (1972–85).
*Peter Henderson (1949–50).
*John Hogan (1907). He also played for New Zealand at rugby league (1913) and was a national waterpolo champion.
*Peter Arthur Johns (1968).
*Peter McDonnell (1896).
*Alasdair &quot;Sandy&quot; McNicol (1973).
*Henare &quot;Buff&quot; Milner (1970).
*Peter Murray (1908).
*Bill Osborne (1975–82).
*Glen Osborne (1995–99).
*Waate &quot;Pat&quot; Potaka (1923).
*Harrison Rowley (1949).
*Peina Taituha also known as Taituha Peina Kingi (1923).
*Hector &quot;Mona&quot; Thomson (1905–08).
Although from the Manawatu, 1987 Rugby World Cup winning All Black Captain David Kirk was a student at Wanganui Collegiate School.

===Athletics===
Whanganui has several high-quality sporting venues including Cooks Gardens, a major sporting venue used for cricket, athletics and rugby. On 27 January 1962, a world record time of 3 minutes 54.4 seconds for running the mile was set by Peter Snell on the grass track at the gardens. The venue also has a world-class velodrome.

===Motor-racing===
The Cemetery Circuit is a temporary motorcycle street racetrack in downtown Whanganui which passes through the old cemetery and industrial area near to the centre of town. The event is usually held on Boxing Day each year.

Rod Coleman was a Grand Prix motorcycle road racer.

Earl Bamber was a racing driver and winner of the 2015 24 Hours of Le Mans and 2014 Porsche Supercup.

===Horse racing===

The Wanganui Jockey Club operates at the Wanganui Racecourse, Purnell Street, where it has been since 1848, said to be the oldest racing club In New Zealand still operating on its original land.

Important races held include the:
*Ag Challenge Stakes.
*H S Dyke Wanganui Guineas.
*Fillies Series.
*Wanganui Cup.

New Zealand Racing Hall of Fame and Australian Racing Hall of Fame jockey Brent Thomson was born and started his career in Wanganui.

==Infrastructure==

===Transport===
Whanganui Airport is served by Air Chathams with flights to Auckland.

Horizons Regional Council, under their Go! brand, contracts ten weekday urban bus routes within the city and a Saturday route which combines parts of four of the routes to serve the northern part of the city. From 18 February 2023 a &#x27;frequent&#x27; (20-minute interval, except Sunday) bus links Castlecliff and Aramoho, though most routes are 2-hourly. The regional council also runs commuter buses to Palmerston North, and monthly buses from Taihape. The services are all operated by Tranzit Group. Go cards were replaced by Bee Cards in December 2019.

Whanganui had trams between Aramoho and Castlecliff from 1908 to 1950, when they were replaced by Greyhound buses. Greyhound was taken over by Tranzit in 1995.

The township was also served by three stations and a passenger rail train running to New Plymouth until this was cancelled in July 1977. Today the line is used for freight.

===Energy===
The Wanganui-Rangitikei Electric Power Board was established in 1921 to supply the city and surrounding areas with electricity. The city was connected to Mangahao hydroelectric scheme on 23 April 1926, following the completion of the transmission line from Bunnythorpe to Whanganui and the Whanganui substation. The Energy Companies Act 1992 saw the power board corporatise and merge with the New Plymouth Municipal Electricity Department and the Taranaki Electric Power Board to become Powerco. Powerco sold its retail base to Genesis Energy as part of the 1998 electricity sector reforms and continued as an electricity distribution business.

Whanganui was one of the original nine towns and cities in New Zealand to be supplied with natural gas when the Kapuni gas field entered production in 1970 and a 260 km high-pressure pipeline from Kapuni to Wellington via the city was completed. The high-pressure transmission pipelines supplying the city are now owned and operated by First Gas, with GasNet owning and operating the medium and low-pressure distribution pipelines within the city.

Whanganui was first supplied with piped gas in March 1879. Coal was shipped from Greymouth, or Westport.

=== Water ===
Whanganui had a mains water supply from Rotokawau Virginia Lake from 1876. From 1904 water was piped from the upper Okehu valley. In 1933 springs at Kai Iwi were used to supplement the supply. Water now comes from artesian bores at Kai Iwi and Aramoho.

==Education==
*Whanganui Collegiate School is in Liverpool Street, central Whanganui. It was founded by a land grant in 1852 by the Governor of New Zealand, Sir George Grey, to the Bishop of New Zealand, George Augustus Selwyn, for the purpose of establishing a school. It was originally a boys-only school, but in 1991 began admitting girls at senior levels and went fully co-educational in 1999. The school celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2004. The school amalgamated with St George&#x27;s School in 2010. The combined schools provide primary education for day students on the St George campus, and secondary education for day and boarding students on the Collegiate campus. Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, spent two terms spanning 1982 and 1983 at the school as a junior master during his gap year.
*Whanganui City College is located in Ingestre Street, central Whanganui, and has had three names. Wanganui Technical College, established in 1911, became Wanganui Boys&#x27; College in 1964 and in 1994 it became Wanganui City College.
*Whanganui High School is in Purnell Street.
*Whanganui Girls&#x27; College is in Jones Street, Whanganui East, near the Dublin Street Bridge.
*Cullinane College is an integrated, co-educational college in Peat Street, Aramoho.

At the time it specialised in trade apprenticeship courses, and in hobby, art, and craft classes, along with a range of night school programmes in business studies for working adults. UCOL expanded in January 2001 with the incorporation of the Wairarapa Regional Polytechnic and the integration of the Whanganui Regional Community Polytechnic on 1 April 2002.
*The Wanganui Regional Community Polytechnic is now called Whanganui UCOL and incorporates the Wanganui School of Design.

==Media==
Whanganui has three local newspapers. Whanganui was the first town in the wider Wellington region to have its own newspaper, the &quot;Wanganui Record&quot;, which was first published in 1853. The &quot;Whanganui Chronicle&quot;, founded in 1856, is New Zealand&#x27;s oldest newspaper, and has been a daily paper since 1871. Its rival from the 1860s onward was the &quot;Evening Herald&quot; (later the &quot;Wanganui Herald&quot;), founded by John Ballance. Initially, the production of the &quot;Wanganui Chronicle&quot; was held back by a lack of equipment, meaning the first issue, dated 18 September 1856, was produced on a makeshift press, made by staff and pupils at the local industrial school. Shortly afterwards, the founder, Henry Stokes, imported a press from Sydney. The two daily papers joined in the 1970s, and in 1986 the &quot;Herald&quot; became a free weekly, later renamed the &quot;Wanganui Midweek&quot;. The &quot;River City Press&quot; is the other free weekly paper.

Whanganui is served by 25 radio stations: 22 on FM and three on AM. In 1996, Whanganui briefly rose to international infamy when a man who claimed to be carrying a bomb held local radio station Star FM (now More FM Whanganui) hostage and demanded that the station broadcast The Muppets song &quot;The Rainbow Connection&quot; for 12 hours.

Television coverage reached Whanganui in 1963, after the Wharite Peak transmitter near Palmerston North was commissioned to relay Wellington&#x27;s WNTV1 channel. Due to terrain blocking the Wharite signal to parts of the city, coverage was supplemented by a translator at Mount Jowett in Aramoho. Today, digital terrestrial television (Freeview) is available in the city from both Wharite and Mount Jowett.

<doc id="351344" wikidata="Q3342640" url="?curid=351344" title="Noe Valley, San Francisco">
<text>Noe Valley ( ; originally spelt Noé) is a neighborhood in the central part of San Francisco, California. It is named for Don José de Jesús Noé, noted 19th-century Californio statesman and ranchero, who owned much of the area and served as mayor.

==Location==
Roughly speaking, Noe Valley is bounded by 21st Street to the north, 30th Street to the south, San Jose Ave and Guerrero Street to the east, and Grand View Avenue and Diamond Heights Blvd to the west. The Castro (Eureka Valley) is north of Noe Valley; the Mission District is east.

==History==

The neighborhood is named after José de Jesús Noé, the last Mexican &quot;alcalde&quot; (mayor) of Yerba Buena (present day San Francisco), who owned what is now Noe Valley as part of his &quot;Rancho San Miguel&quot;. Noé sold the land, later to be known as Noe Valley, to John Meirs Horner, a Mormon immigrant, in 1854. At this time the land was called Horner&#x27;s Addition. The original Noé adobe house was located in the vicinity of the present day intersection of 23rd Street and Douglass Street. Along with nearby neighborhood Corona Heights, Noe Valley was the site of two quarries until 1914.

Noe Valley was primarily developed at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century, especially in the years just after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. As a result, the neighborhood contains many examples of the &quot;classic&quot; Victorian and Edwardian residential architecture for which San Francisco is famous. As a working-class neighborhood, Noe Valley houses were built in rows, with some of the efficient, low-cost homes being more ornate than others, depending on the owner&#x27;s taste and finances. Today, Noe Valley has one of the highest concentration of row houses in San Francisco, with streets having three to four and sometimes as many as a dozen on the same side. However, few facades in such rows of houses remain unchanged since their creation in the late 19th and early 20th century.

Many Noe Valley streets were laid out and named by John Meirs Horner, who named Elizabeth Street after his wife and Jersey Street after the state where he was born. Most of Noe Valley is still called Horner&#x27;s Addition for tax purposes by the city assessor&#x27;s office. Present day 24th Street was named &quot;Park Street,&quot; and 25th Street was named &quot;Temple Street&quot; to commemorate John Meirs Horner&#x27;s Mormon faith.

St. Paul&#x27;s Catholic Church, also known as Parroquia De San Pablo, is a famous church located at Church and Valley Street. It was the filming location for the movie &quot;Sister Act&quot;.

==Attractions and characteristics==
Like many other San Francisco neighborhoods, Noe Valley started out as a working-class neighborhood for employees and their families in the area&#x27;s once-thriving blue-collar economy. Since 1980 it has undergone successive waves of gentrification and is now considered an upper-middle class/wealthy neighborhood. It is home to many urban professionals, particularly young couples with children. It is colloquially known as Stroller Valley, for the many strollers in the neighborhood. The median sale price for homes in Noe Valley as of December 2019 was $1.83 million. One of the attractions of Noe Valley is that the adjacent Twin Peaks partly blocks the coastal fog and cool winds from the Pacific, making the microclimate usually sunnier and warmer than surrounding neighborhoods.

Traffic flow is limited – one main north access through Castro Street to Eureka Valley, one main west access up Clipper Street toward the former Twin Peaks toll plaza and west of the city, several east accesses to the Mission District through 24th Street, Cesar Chavez, and other numbered streets, and the main north–south Church Street access used by the J Church Muni Light Rail.

Public transit includes the J Church, which runs down Church Street until 30th Street. The 24 Muni Bus also runs through Noe Valley. Its route comes from the north on Castro Street and switches to Noe Street at 26th Street. It then exits the neighborhood via 30th Street. Additionally, the 48 Muni Bus runs down 24th street, connecting the neighborhood to the nearby Mission District.
The neighborhood is primarily residential, although there are two bustling commercial strips, the first along 24th Street, between Church Street and Diamond Street, and the second, less dense corridor along Church Street, between 24th Street and 30th Street.

===Notable residents===
Ruth Asawa was a resident of Noe Valley from 1962 until her death in August 2013. Carlos Santana graduated from James Lick Middle School on Noe Street in the early 1960s, as did Benjamin Bratt in the following decade. Famous residents include Evan Williams, Mark Zuckerberg, and Terry Karl.

The word &quot;tab&quot; derives from the word &quot;tabulate&quot;, which means &quot;to arrange data in a tabular, or table, form.&quot; When a person wanted to type a table (of numbers or text) on a typewriter, there was a lot of time-consuming and repetitive use of the space bar and backspace key. To simplify this, a horizontal bar was placed in the mechanism called the tabulator rack. Pressing the tab key would advance the carriage to the next tabulator stop. The original tabulator stops were adjustable clips that could be arranged by the user on the tabulator rack. Fredric Hillard filed a patent application for such a mechanism in 1900.

The tab mechanism came into its own as a rapid and consistent way of uniformly indenting the first line of each paragraph. Often a first tab stop at 5 or 6 characters was used for this, far larger than the indentation used when typesetting. For numeric data, however, the logical place for the tab stop is the location of the least significant digit. Tabbing to this location and then pressing the backspace key to back up to the position of the first digit is practical but slow. Various schemes for numeric tabs were proposed. For example, in 1903, Harry Dukes and William Clayton filed for a patent on a tab mechanism with multiple tab keys numbered 1, 10, 100, etc. Pressing 1 was a simple tab. Pressing 10 advanced to the space before the tab, pressing 100 advanced to the position 2 spaces before the tab.

Initially tab stops were set by adding and removing clips from the tab rack, but Edward Hess working for the Royal Typewriter Company filed for a patent in 1904 covering a system where the tab stops were permanently mounted on the tab bar. To set or reset a tab for a particular column, the tab stop for that column was simply rotated in or out of engagement. In 1940, James Koca filed for a patent on a mechanism allowing the tab stops for each column to be set and cleared from the keyboard, eliminating the need for the typist to bend over the back of the machine to directly manipulate the tab rack. These keys, if present, are typically labeled tab set and tab clear.

== Modern usage ==

In word processing and text editing, the Tab key will move the insertion point to the next tab stop in a table, insert the ASCII tab character, or insert multiple space characters (depending on the program used).

When filling out a computerized form, pressing Tab will sometimes move the cursor to the next field (and Shift-Tab will move the cursor to the previous field), eliminating the need to use a mouse to click in an adjacent field.

In many graphical applications, especially on Windows, the Tab key will move the focus to &quot;every&quot; control or widget such as buttons so that the user interface can be used without a mouse at all (this was part of the IBM Common User Access design). On macOS, this is an option called &quot;Full Keyboard Access&quot;.

A feature called tab completion can be used to complete a partially typed piece of text. For example, in some command-line interfaces, the user may type the first few characters of a command or file-name, then press Tab. If there is no ambiguity about the intent, the rest of the characters will appear automatically. On some systems, even if the input is ambiguous, tab completion may give the user a list of possible options to select from. Tab completion is more common on Linux, Unix, and Unix-like systems than Windows.

In PC video games, the Tab key is very often used to show scores in multiplayer games. For single player games it is also used to show the in-game world map or the player&#x27;s inventory, as well as other useful information.

In software engineering, when developing computer programs or storing and manipulating data in files, the Tab character is often used for indentation purposes to help guide the flow of reading and add semantic structure to the code or data. Some programmers and programming languages prefer the usage of multiple whitespace characters instead for that purpose. Because of this, many text editors have an option that makes the tab key insert the number of whitespace characters that a tab character is set to be equivalent to (by default mostly four).

== Tab characters ==
The most known and common tab is a &quot;horizontal tabulation&quot; (HT) or &quot;character tabulation&quot;, which in ASCII has the decimal character code of 9, and may be referred to as or . In C and many other programming languages the escape sequence can be used to put this character into a string literal. The horizontal tab is usually inserted when the Tab key on a standard keyboard is pressed.

A &quot;vertical tabulation&quot; (VT) also exists and has ASCII decimal character code 11 ( or ), escape character .

In EBCDIC the code for HT is 5. VT is 11 (coincidentally the same as in ASCII).

Originally, printer mechanisms used mechanical tab stops to indicate where the tabs went. This was done horizontally with movable metal prongs in a row, and vertically with a loop of mylar or other tape the length of a page with holes punched in it to indicate the tab stops. These were manually set to match the pre-printed forms that were loaded into the printer. In practice, settable tab stops were rather quickly replaced with fixed tab stops, &quot;de facto&quot; standardized at every multiple of eight characters horizontally, and every six lines vertically. A printing program could send zero or more tabs to get to the closest tab stop above and left of where it wanted to print, then send line feeds and spaces to get to the final location. Tab characters simply became a form of data compression.

Despite the fact that five characters were the typical paragraph indentation on typewriters at that time, the horizontal tab size of eight evolved because as a power of two it was easier to calculate with the limited digital electronics available. Using this size tab to indent code results in much white space on the left, so most text editors for code, such as IDEs, allow the size of the tab to be changed, and some (in particular on Windows) default to four instead of eight. Disagreements between programmers about what size tabs are correct, and whether to use tabs at all, are common. Modern text editors usually have the Tab key insert the user-defined indentation and may use heuristics to adapt this behavior to existing files.

ISO 6429 includes the codes 136 (Horizontal Tabulation Set), 137 (Horizontal Tabulation with Justification) and 138 (Vertical Tabulation Set) that were intended to allow the program to set and clear tab stops. This is rarely used or supported.

=== Tab-separated values ===
Tab-separated values (TSV) are used for exporting and importing database or spreadsheet field values. Text divided into fields delimited by tabs can often be pasted into a word processor and formatted into a table with a single command. For example, in Microsoft Word 2010, Insert &gt; Table &gt; Convert Text to Table... is the necessary command, producing a dialog where the user selects further details.

The TSV convention for exporting data may be compared to the alternative comma-separated values (CSV) convention (that may be using semicolons instead of commas), and both are easily converted into each other.

Gopher menus use tab-separated values to indicate selectors.

TSV has also been cited in a modern approach to solving the programming debate regarding the use of tabs and spaces for code alignment called elastic tabstops. This idea uses a scheme called tab-separated columns (TSC) rather than the similar tab-separated values (TSV).

=== HTML ===

In HTML the horizontal tab is coded using or but as with all whitespace characters in HTML, this will be displayed as a single space except inside , tags (or other elements with CSS attribute set to ).

Here is an example:
;HTML:

&amp;#9;This line begins with a single tab.
Here&amp;#9;are&amp;#9;some&amp;#9;more&amp;#9;tab&amp;#9;characters&amp;#9;!
T...T...T...T...T...T...T...T

;Inside :

;Outside :

 This line begins with a single tab.
Here are some more tab characters !
T...T...T...T...T...T...T...T
Notice that the tab at the start of a line is removed outside , the eight-character spacing, and how a tab stop is skipped if there are more than eight characters since last one.

CSS3 defines property, which adjusts the number of spaces for the tab character from the default of eight. The latest version of WebKit supports the property. The Opera web browser supports the CSS property, the Firefox web browser supports the CSS property with the same meaning.

The vertical tab is but is not allowed in SGML; this includes XML 1.0 and HTML.

=== Unicode ===
The Unicode code points for the (horizontal) tab character, and the more rarely used vertical tab character are copied from ASCII:

* (CHARACTER TABULATION, horizontal tabulation (HT), tab)
* (LINE TABULATION, vertical tabulation (VT))

The tab characters can be graphically represented by special symbols:
* 

Unicode also has characters for the symbols to represent or be printed on the tab key:

* (tab with shift tab)
* (leftward tab)
* (rightward tab)

Unicode provides additional characters for tab symbols with triangle-headed arrow:

* (left tab)
* (up tab)
* (right tab)
* (down tab)
*

<text>Malcolm John Rebennack Jr. (November 20, 1941 – June 6, 2019), better known by his stage name Dr. John, was an American singer, songwriter and pianist. His music combined New Orleans blues, jazz, R&amp;B, soul and funk.

Active as a session musician from the late 1950s until his death, he gained a following in the late 1960s after the release of his album &quot;Gris-Gris&quot; (1968) and his appearance at the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music (1970). He typically performed a lively, theatrical stage show inspired by medicine shows, Mardi Gras costumes, and voodoo ceremonies. Rebennack recorded thirty studio albums and nine live albums, as well as contributing to thousands of other musicians&#x27; recordings. In 1973, he achieved a top-10 hit single with &quot;Right Place, Wrong Time&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Rebennack was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on November 20, 1941. He was the son of Dorothy (née Cronin) and Malcolm John Rebennack, and had German, Irish, Spanish, English, and French heritage. His father ran an appliance shop in the East End of New Orleans, fixing radios and televisions and selling records. Growing up in the 3rd Ward of New Orleans, he found early musical inspiration in the minstrel show tunes sung by his grandfather and a number of aunts, uncles, sister, and cousins who played piano. He did not take music lessons before his teens and endured only a short stint in choir before getting kicked out. When Rebennack was a young boy, his father exposed him to jazz musicians King Oliver and Louis Armstrong, who later inspired his 2014 release, &quot;Ske-Dat-De-Dat: The Spirit of Satch&quot;. Throughout his adolescence, his father&#x27;s connections enabled him access to the recording rooms of rock artists, including Little Richard and Guitar Slim. Later he began to perform in New Orleans clubs, mainly on guitar, and played on stage with various local artists.

When he was about 13 years old, Rebennack met Professor Longhair. Impressed by the professor&#x27;s flamboyant attire and striking musical style, Rebennack soon began performing with him, and began his life as a professional musician. He later recalled that his debut in the studio, in about 1955 or 1956, came when he was signed as a songwriter and artist by Eddie Mesner at Aladdin Records. He joined the musicians&#x27; union at the end of 1957, with the help of Danny Kessler, and then considered himself to be a professional musician.

At age 16, Rebennack was hired by Johnny Vincent as a producer at Ace Records. There, he gained experience working with many artists, including James Booker, Earl King, and Jimmy Clanton. While a struggling student at Jesuit High School, he was already playing in night clubs, something the Jesuit fathers disapproved of. He formed his first band, The Dominoes, while at the school. The priests told him to either stop playing in clubs or leave the school. Rebennack was expelled from the high school in 1954 and from then on focused entirely on music.

In late 1950s New Orleans, Rebennack led his own band, Mac Rebennack and the Skyliners, (Paul Staehle/Dennis &quot;Bootsie&quot; Cuquet, drums; Earl Stanley, bass; Charlie Miller, trumpet; Charlie Maduell, sax; Roland &quot;Stone&quot; LeBlanc, vocals), while playing gigs with others, including Frankie Ford and the Thunderbirds, and Jerry Byrne and the Loafers. His first (co-written) rock and roll song &quot;Lights Out&quot; (1957), sung by Jerry Byrne, was a regional hit. He had a regional hit with a Bo Diddley-influenced instrumental called &quot;Storm Warning&quot; on Rex Records in 1959. At A&amp;R, he and Charlie Miller recorded monophonic singles on 45s for Johnny Vincent and Joe Corona for local labels Ace, Ron, and Ric. He oversaw the rhythm section while Miller wrote the horn arrangements and headed up the horns. This continued until Miller moved to New York to study music formally.

Rebennack&#x27;s career as a guitarist was stunted around 1960, when the ring finger on his left (guitar fretting) hand was injured by a gunshot during an incident at a Jacksonville, Florida gig. After the injury, Rebennack concentrated on bass guitar before making piano his main instrument, developing a style influenced by Professor Longhair.

Rebennack became involved in illegal activities in New Orleans, using and selling narcotics and running a brothel. He was arrested on drug charges and sentenced to two years in the Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Worth. His sentence ended in 1965 and he left for Los Angeles.

Once settled in Los Angeles he became a &quot;first call&quot; session musician in the Los Angeles studio scene in the 1960s and 1970s and was part of the so-called &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot; stable of studio musicians. He provided backing for Sonny &amp; Cher (and some of the incidental music for Cher&#x27;s first film, &quot;Chastity&quot;), for Canned Heat on their albums &quot;Living the Blues&quot; (1968) and &quot;Future Blues&quot; (1970), and for Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention on &quot;Freak Out!&quot; (1966).

==Voodoo influence==
As a young man, Rebennack was interested in New Orleans voodoo, and in Los Angeles he developed the idea of the Dr. John persona for his old friend Ronnie Barron, based on the life of Dr. John, a Senegalese prince, conjure man, herb doctor, and spiritual healer who came to New Orleans from Haiti. This free man of color lived on Bayou Road and claimed to have 15 wives and over 50 children. He kept an assortment of snakes and lizards, along with embalmed scorpions and animal and human skulls, and sold &quot;gris-gris&quot;, voodoo amulets which supposedly protect the wearer from harm.

Rebennack decided to produce a record and a stage show based on this concept, with Dr. John serving as an emblem of New Orleans heritage. Although initially, the plan was for Barron to front the act assuming the identity of &quot;Dr. John&quot;, while Rebennack worked behind the scenes as Dr. John&#x27;s writer, musician, and producer, this did not come to pass. Barron dropped out of the project, and Rebennack took over the role (and identity) of Dr. John. &quot;Gris-Gris&quot; became the name of Dr. John&#x27;s debut album, released in January 1968, representing his own form of &quot;voodoo medicine&quot;.

==1968–1971: Dr. John, the Night Tripper==

Beginning in the late 1960s, Rebennack gained fame as a solo artist after adopting the persona of &quot;Dr. John, The Night Tripper&quot;. Dr. John&#x27;s act combined New Orleans-style rhythm and blues with psychedelic rock and elaborate stage shows that bordered on voodoo religious ceremonies, including elaborate costumes and headdress. In 1970, when Howard Smith asked him where the name &quot;Dr. John the Night Tripper&quot; came from, he responded, &quot;Before that I was Professor Bizarre. Cats used to call me things like &quot;Bishop&quot; or &quot;Governor&quot; or somethin&#x27; but they started callin&#x27; me &quot;Doctor&quot; for a while, so I just hung it on myself for keeps.&quot; On the earliest Dr. John records, the artist billing was &quot;Dr. John, The Night Tripper&quot;, while the songwriting credits billed him as &quot;Dr. John Creaux&quot;. Within a few years, the &quot;Night Tripper&quot; subtitle was dropped, and Rebennack resumed using his real name for writing and producing/arranging credits.

&quot;Gris-Gris&quot;, his 1968 debut album combining voodoo rhythms and chants with the New Orleans music tradition, was ranked 143rd on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;′s &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list.
Three more albums, &quot;Babylon&quot; (1969), &quot;Remedies&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Sun, Moon &amp; Herbs&quot; (1971), were released in the same vein as &quot;Gris-Gris&quot;.

During early to mid-1969, Dr. John toured extensively, backed by supporting musicians Richard &quot;Didymus&quot; Washington (congas), Richard Crooks (drums), David L. Johnson (bass), Gary Carino (guitar), and singers Eleanor Barooshian, Jeanette Jacobs from The Cake, and Sherry Graddie. A second lineup formed later in the year for an extensive tour of the East Coast with Crooks and Johnson joined by Doug Hastings (guitar) and Don MacAllister (mandolin). The same year, Dr. John contributed to the &quot;Music from Free Creek&quot; &quot;supersession&quot; project, playing on three tracks with Eric Clapton. Washington and Crooks also contributed to the project.

By the time &quot;The Sun, Moon, and Herbs&quot; was released, he had gained a notable cult following, which included artists such as Eric Clapton and Mick Jagger, who both took part in the sessions for that album. This album served as a transition from his Night Tripper voodoo, psychedelic persona to one more closely associated with traditional New Orleans R&amp;B and funk. His next album, &quot;Dr. John&#x27;s Gumbo&quot;, with drummer Fred Staehle serving as the band&#x27;s backbone, proved to be a landmark recording and is one of his most popular to this day.

==1972–1974: &quot;Gumbo&quot;, &quot;In the Right Place&quot;, and &quot;Desitively Bonnaroo&quot;==
Along with &quot;Gris-Gris&quot;, Dr. John is perhaps best known for his recordings in the period 1972–74. 1972&#x27;s &quot;Dr. John&#x27;s Gumbo&quot;, an album covering several New Orleans R&amp;B standards with only one original, is considered a cornerstone of New Orleans music. In his 1994 autobiography, &quot;Under a Hoodoo Moon&quot;, Dr. John writes, &quot;In 1972, I recorded &quot;Gumbo&quot;, an album that was both a tribute to and my interpretation of the music I had grown up with in New Orleans in the late 1940s and 1950s. I tried to keep a lot of little changes that were characteristic of New Orleans, while working my own funknology on piano and guitar.&quot; The lead single from the album, &quot;Iko Iko&quot;, broke into the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart, eventually reaching No. 71. In 2003 the album was ranked number 404 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

With &quot;Gumbo&quot;, Dr. John expanded his career beyond the psychedelic voodoo music and theatrics which had driven his career since he took on the Dr. John persona, although it always remained an integral part of his music and identity. It was not until 1998&#x27;s &quot;Anutha Zone&quot; that he again concentrated on this aspect of his music wholly for a full album. &quot;After we cut the new record&quot;, he wrote, &quot;I decided I&#x27;d had enough of the mighty-coo-de-fiyo hoodoo show, so I dumped the Gris-Gris routine we had been touring with since 1967 and worked up a new act—a Mardi Gras revue featuring the New Orleans standards we had covered in &quot;Gumbo&quot;.&quot;

In early 1973 Thomas Jefferson Kaye produced an album featuring a collaboration with Dr. John, Mike Bloomfield and John Paul Hammond. This album, &quot;Triumvirate&quot;, was recorded in Columbia Studios, San Francisco, and Village Recorders, Los Angeles.

In 1973, with Allen Toussaint producing and The Meters backing, Dr. John released the seminal New Orleans funk album &quot;In the Right Place&quot;. In the same way that &quot;Gris-Gris&quot; introduced the world to the voodoo-influenced side of his music, and in the manner that &quot;Dr. John&#x27;s Gumbo&quot; began his career-long reputation as an esteemed interpreter of New Orleans standards, &quot;In the Right Place&quot; established Dr. John as one of the main ambassadors of New Orleans funk. In describing the album, Dr. John stated, &quot;The album had more of a straight-ahead dance feel than ones I had done in the past, although it was still anchored solid in R&amp;B.&quot; It rose to No. 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. In July 1973, the single &quot;Right Place, Wrong Time&quot; peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, as well as peaking at No. 19 on the Hot Soul Singles chart. A second single, &quot;Such a Night&quot;, peaked at No. 42. Still in heavy rotation on most classic rock stations, &quot;Right Place Wrong Time&quot; remains his most recognized song. Artists such as Bob Dylan, Bette Midler, and Doug Sahm contributed single lines to the lyrics, which lists several instances of ironic bad luck and failure.

Dr. John attempted to capitalize on &quot;In the Right Place&quot;″s successful formula, again collaborating with Allen Toussaint and The Meters, for his next album, &quot;Desitively Bonnaroo&quot; – from part of which a Tennessee festival took as its name – released in 1974. Although similar in feel to &quot;In the Right Place&quot;, it failed to catch hold in the mainstream as its predecessor had done. It did produce the single &quot;(Everybody Wanna Get Rich) Rite Away&quot;, which peaked at No. 92 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and to date is the last time he hit the Hot 100. It was his last pure funk album until 1994&#x27;s &quot;Television&quot;, although like his voodoo and traditional New Orleans R&amp;B influences, funk continued to heavily influence most of his work to the end, especially his live concerts.

In the mid-1970s Dr. John began an almost 20-year collaboration with the R&amp;R Hall of Fame/Songwriters Hall of Fame writer Doc Pomus, to create songs for Dr. John&#x27;s releases &quot;City Lights&quot; and &quot;Tango Palace&quot;, and for B.B. King&#x27;s Stuart Levine-produced &quot;There Must Be a Better World Somewhere&quot;, which won a Grammy for Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording in 1982. Dr. John also recorded &quot;I&#x27;m On a Roll&quot; – the last song written with Pomus prior to his death in 1991 – for the now out-of-print Rhino/Forward Records 1995 tribute to Pomus titled &quot;Til the Night Is Gone: A Tribute to Doc Pomus&quot;. The tribute included covers of Pomus-penned songs by Bob Dylan, John Hiatt, Shawn Colvin, Brian Wilson, The Band, Los Lobos, Dion, Rosanne Cash, Solomon Burke, and Lou Reed. According to Pomus&#x27; daughter, Dr. John and her father were very close friends as well as writing partners. Dr. John delivered one of a number of eulogies and performed with singer Jimmy Scott at Pomus&#x27; funeral on March 17, 1991, in New York City.

On Thanksgiving Day 1976 he performed &quot;Such a Night&quot; at the farewell concert for The Band, which was filmed by Martin Scorsese and released as &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;. In 1979, he collaborated with the legendary Professor Longhair on Fess&#x27;s (another nickname for Henry Byrd) last recording, &quot;Crawfish Fiesta&quot;, as a guitarist. The album was awarded the first W.C. Handy Blues Album of the Year in 1980 and was released shortly after Longhair&#x27;s death in January 1980.

==Later work==

By the mid-1970s, Rebennack was focusing on a blend of music that touched on blues, New Orleans R&amp;B, Tin Pan Alley standards, and more. In 1975, his manager, Richard Flanzer, hired producer Bob Ezrin, and &quot;Hollywood Be Thy Name&quot; was recorded live at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles, California. The studio was transformed into a New Orleans nightclub for the sessions. In 1981 and 1983, Dr. John recorded two solo piano albums, &quot;Dr. John Plays Mac Rebennack&quot; and &quot;The Brightest Smile in Town&quot;, for the Baltimore-based Clean Cuts label. In these two recordings he played many of his own boogie-woogie compositions.

Dr. John was also a prominent session musician throughout his career. He provided back-up vocals on the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1972 song &quot;Let It Loose&quot;, and backed Carly Simon and James Taylor in their duet of &quot;Mockingbird&quot; (from &quot;Hotcakes&quot;) in 1974, and Neil Diamond on &quot;Beautiful Noise&quot; in 1976. He also contributed the song &quot;More and More&quot; to Simon&#x27;s &quot;Playing Possum&quot; album. He played on three songs on Maria Muldaur&#x27;s 1973 solo debut album, including his composition &quot;Three Dollar Bill&quot;. He sang on four songs and played piano on two songs on Muldaur&#x27;s 1992 &quot;Louisiana Love Call&quot;. He was co-producer on Van Morrison&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;A Period of Transition&quot; and also played keyboards and guitar. He contributed three songs as writer or co-writer (&quot;Washer Woman&quot;, &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot;, and &quot;That&#x27;s My Home&quot;) and also played guitar and keyboards on Levon Helm&#x27;s 1977 release, &quot;Levon Helm &amp; the RCO All-Stars&quot;. He performed on the March 19, 1977, episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

He played keyboards on the highly successful 1979 solo debut album by Rickie Lee Jones. He toured with Willy DeVille and contributed to his albums &quot;Return to Magenta&quot; (1978), &quot;Victory Mixture&quot; (1990), &quot;Backstreets of Desire&quot; (1992), and &quot;Big Easy Fantasy&quot; (1995). In 1997 he contributed piano and vocals to the Spiritualized song &quot;Cop Shoot Cop&quot; which appears on their album, &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space&quot;. His music was featured in many films, including &quot;New Looks&quot; in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s European Vacation&quot; in 1985 and &quot;Such a Night&quot; in &quot;Colors&quot; in 1988. In 1992, Dr. John released the album &quot;Goin&#x27; Back to New Orleans&quot;, which included many classic songs from New Orleans. Many great New Orleans–based musicians, such as Aaron Neville, the Neville Brothers, Al Hirt and Pete Fountain, backed up Dr. John on this album. He also performed as the first American artist at the Franco Follies festival in 1992.

Dr. John&#x27;s longtime confidant and former personal manager, Paul Howrilla, was responsible for moving Dr. John from Los Angeles to New York and securing &quot;crossover&quot; work, as well as modifying Dr. John&#x27;s image from the 1970s to the 1990s. Paul Howrilla was the brains behind the scenes, as Dr. John would attest. They remained close friends. Dr. John also provided vocals for Popeyes Chicken &amp; Biscuits&#x27; &quot;Luv dat chicken ...&quot; jingle, as well as the theme song (&quot;My Opinionation&quot;) for the early-1990s television sitcom &quot;Blossom&quot;. A version of &quot;Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?&quot; with Harry Connick Jr. was released on Connick&#x27;s album &quot;20&quot; and VHS &quot;Singin&#x27; &amp; Swingin&#x27;&quot; in 1990. Dr. John moved back to Louisiana in 2009.

From the late 1970s to 1991, Dr. John co-wrote over 115 songs with legendary Brill Building songwriter Doc Pomus. Some of the songs created with Pomus were recorded by Marianne Faithfull, B.B. King, Irma Thomas, Johnny Adams, and others. On March 17, 1991, Dr. John performed &quot;My Buddy&quot; at the funeral for Pomus.

His movie credits included Martin Scorsese&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;, in which he joined the Band for a performance of his song &quot;Such a Night&quot;, the 1978 Beatles-inspired musical &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, and &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;, in which he joined the fictional band the Louisiana Gator Boys to perform the songs &quot;How Blue Can You Get&quot; and &quot;New Orleans&quot;. His version of the Donovan song &quot;Season of the Witch&quot; was also featured in this movie and on the soundtrack. In 1996, he performed the song &quot;Cruella de Ville&quot; during the end credits of the film &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot;.
He wrote and performed the score for the film version of John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Cannery Row&quot; released in 1982. His hit song &quot;Right Place Wrong Time&quot; was used extensively in the movies &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; and &quot;Sahara&quot; and the series &quot;American Horror Story: Coven&quot;. Dr. John was also featured in several video and audio blues and New Orleans piano lessons published by Homespun Tapes. Other documentary film scores include the New Orleans dialect film &quot;Yeah You Rite!&quot; (1985) and &quot;American Tongues&quot; in 1987.

Between July and September 1989, Dr. John toured in the first Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band, alongside Levon Helm, Rick Danko, Nils Lofgren, Jim Keltner, Joe Walsh, Billy Preston, Clarence Clemons and himself of piano, bass and vocals. The tour produced the 1990 live album &quot;Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band&quot;.

In 1997, he appeared on the charity single version of Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Perfect Day&quot;. In the same year, he played piano on the Spiritualized song &quot;Cop Shoot Cop ...&quot;, from their critically acclaimed album &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space&quot;. Frontman Jason Pierce, a fan of Dr. John&#x27;s music, reciprocated by guesting on Dr. John&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Anutha Zone&quot; along with drummer Damon Reece and guitarist Thighpaulsandra. He recorded the live album &quot;Trippin&#x27; Live&quot; with drummer Herman V. Ernest III, David Barard, bass, Tommy Moran, guitar, trumpeter Charlie Miller, tenor Red Tyler, and baritone sax Ronnie Cuber.

In September 2005, he performed Bobby Charles&#x27; &quot;Walkin&#x27; to New Orleans&quot;, to close the &quot;Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast&quot; telethon. This was for the relief of Hurricane Katrina victims, following the devastation of his hometown of New Orleans. In November 2005, he released a four-song EP, &quot;Sippiana Hericane&quot;, to benefit New Orleans Musicians Clinic, Salvation Army, and the Jazz Foundation of America. On February 5, 2006, he joined fellow New Orleans native Aaron Neville, Detroit resident Aretha Franklin and a 150-member choir for the national anthem at Super Bowl XL as part of a pre-game tribute to New Orleans. On February 8, 2006, he joined Allen Toussaint, Bonnie Raitt, The Edge, and Irma Thomas to perform &quot;We Can Can&quot; as the closing performance at the Grammy Awards of 2006. In 2014 he performed at the NBA All Star Game as did Pharrell Williams and Janelle Monáe.

On May 12, 2006, Dr. John recorded a live session at Abbey Road Studios for &quot;Live from Abbey Road&quot;. His performance was aired alongside those of LeAnn Rimes and Massive Attack on the Sundance Channel in the US and Channel 4 in the UK. He performed the opening theme music to the PBS children&#x27;s program &quot;Curious George&quot;, broadcast since 2006.
On July 30, 2006, Dr. John performed a solo piano benefit for New Orleans composer and arranger Wardell Quezergue (King Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Groove Me&quot;) at a New Orleans Musicians Relief Fund benefit at the Black Orchid Theatre in Chicago. Special guest Mike Mills of R.E.M. was in attendance, along with an all-star funk band.

Dr. John performed the theme music to the Fox drama &quot;K-Ville&quot;. In 2007, he contributed to &quot;Goin&#x27; Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino&quot;, performing &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot;. In January 2008, Dr. John was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. Later, in February, he performed at All-Star Saturday Night, part of the NBA All-Star Weekend hosted by New Orleans. The same year, Dr. John released his Grammy Award-winning &quot;City that Care Forgot&quot;, about Hurricane Katrina&#x27;s devastation in New Orleans.

In the 2009 Disney film &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;, Dr. John sang the opening tune, &quot;Down in New Orleans&quot;. He reigned as King of the Krewe du Vieux for the 2010 New Orleans Mardi Gras season. On May 13, 2010, Dr. John played alongside The Roots on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; (episode 246) and was warmly greeted by Jimmy&#x27;s first guest, Keith Richards. In June 2010, Dr John played at the Glastonbury festival, Shepton Mallet, UK.

Dr. John played keyboards and had a major role in shaping Gregg Allman&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;Low Country Blues&quot;, which was produced by T-Bone Burnett. In 2011, he collaborated with Hugh Laurie on the song &quot;After You&#x27;ve Gone&quot; on Laurie&#x27;s album &quot;Let Them Talk&quot;. The same year, Dr. John, Allen Toussaint and The Meters performed &quot;Desitively Bonnaroo&quot; at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, as part of the festival&#x27;s tenth year celebration. The name of the festival was taken from the 1974 Dr. John album, &quot;Desitively Bonnaroo&quot;. The same year he was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame along with Neil Diamond, Alice Cooper, Darlene Love and Tom Waits.

In 2012, Dr. John released &quot;Locked Down&quot;, a collaboration with Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, who produced the record and played guitar on it. The album received very positive reviews for its raw, Afrobeat-influenced sound. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that it showed Dr. John &quot;exiting a period of relative creative stagnation by creating something magical, the embodiment of everything he&#x27;s done but pushed in a clear new direction&quot;. It won a Grammy Award, as did Auerbach for producing it.

In 2014, Dr. John released a Louis Armstrong tribute album, &quot;Ske-Dat-De-Dat: The Spirit of Satch&quot;, on Concord Records USA and Proper Records in Europe. Dr. John described the inspiration of the album as Louis Armstrong coming to him in a dream and telling him &quot;do my music your way&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said, &quot;Tribute albums come and go, but it&#x27;s a real rarity that can snap a listener to attention like Dr. John&#x27;s new salute to jazz founding father Louis Armstrong.&quot; That spring, &quot;The Musical Mojo of Mac&quot;, a New Orleans concert to honor Dr. John, was introduced by Brian Williams and kicked off by Bruce Springsteen singing &quot;Right Place, Wrong Time&quot;, with Dr. John and an all-star band which included event producer Don Was on bass.

Dr. John recorded &quot;Let &#x27;Em In&quot; in the Paul McCartney tribute album &quot;The Art of McCartney&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s a wonder to behold, as the ageless Dr. John re-envisions &quot;Let &#x27;Em In&quot; as a laconic come on, an invitation to party or maybe something more, once a few more glasses have been raised&quot;, wrote Something Else. &quot;At the same time, he ends up lacing the song with darker feelings, as well.&quot;

Foo Fighters&#x27; Dave Grohl interviewed Dr. John about music in the New Orleans-themed episode of their HBO series &quot;Sonic Highways&quot; &quot;(including the hypnotic reveal of Dr. John&#x27;s given name)&quot;, wrote a Decider reviewer.

From 2014 to 2016, Dr. John performed with an alternate band, including at a Hollywood Bowl tribute &quot;Yes We Can Can&quot; for his late friend Allen Toussaint on July 20, 2016. Also performing Allen Toussaint compositions were New Orleans artists Irma Thomas, Cyril Neville, the band Galactic, and the Allen Toussaint Band. In 2016, a double album and DVD of the concert, &quot;The Musical Mojo of Dr. John: Celebrating Mac and his Music&quot;, was released.

In 2017, Members of Dr. John&#x27;s band The Gris Gris Krewe with music director Roland Guerin performed &quot;Right Place Wrong Time&quot; in the video kicking off the 2017 NBA All-Star Game. The same year, Dr. John was a headliner on The Last Waltz 40th Anniversary Tour with Music Directors Warren Haynes and Don Was, reprising his &quot;Such a Night&quot; performance from the original concert and film with The Band.

The year 2017 also saw his first single &quot;Storm Warning&quot;, recorded as a tribute to Bo Diddley, featured on the &quot;Logan Lucky&quot; soundtrack. In April, he joined John Legend (who inducted him into the Rock Hall) and Jon Batiste on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, and he appeared in Tig Notaro&#x27;s critically acclaimed Amazon TV series &quot;One Mississippi&quot;.

On November 1, 2017, Dr. John celebrated Mac Month as proclaimed by the New Orleans City Council in a reception at Napoleon House, and his birthday was proclaimed Dr. John Day in the City of New Orleans for the fact that he &quot;rose to international recognition for his musical funkitude in performing, writing and producing.&quot; Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards also issued a Statement of Recognition to Dr. John for &quot;embodying the culture of the state from New Orleans to the Bayou.&quot;

Dr. John&#x27;s birth date was corrected in 2018 when his hometown newspaper, &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot;, discovered in their records that he was actually born on November 20, 1941, as opposed to the commonly listed November 21, 1940. He added a year to his age as an underage prodigy with a local hit, so he could get into gigs.

On September 23, 2022, Rounder Records and the Dr. John estate released Dr. John&#x27;s posthumous country &amp; western album &quot;Things Happen That Way&quot; with guests Aaron Neville, Willie Nelson, and Lukas Nelson &amp; Promise of the Real. &quot;The New Orleans piano man who embodied the musical mélange of his hometown had the kind of drawly, lived-in voice that only improved with age,&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote. &quot;So Things Happen That Way, Dr. John&#x27;s final album, recorded the year he died, 2019 - captures him in peak form.&quot; The album was nominated for a Grammy for Best Americana Album in November 2022.

On June 2, 2023, Montreux Jazz Fest and the Dr. John estate released &quot;Dr. John: The Montreux Years&quot;, with live performances from 1986 to 2012. &quot;It&#x27;s a great way to say adieu&quot;, stated &quot;Offbeat Magazine&quot;.

In November 2023, &quot;Dr. John: Solo Piano Live in New Orleans 1984&quot; was released by the Dr. John estate and 501 Record Club.

On April 20, 2024, &quot;Dr. John: Gris-Gris Gumbo Ya Ya: Singles 1968-1974&quot; was released by Omnivore and the Dr. John estate, on double purple vinyl as a special Record Store Day release, and as a CD on April 26, 2024.

In November, 2024, &quot;When The Saints Go Marching In Medley&quot; was released by Montreux Jazz Festival and the Dr. John estate, as a preview to the digital album &quot;Dr. John: Live in Montreux 1986&quot; released to commemorate Dr. John&#x27;s birthday, Nov. 20. 

==Musical style==

According to &quot;AllMusic&quot;, Dr. John &quot;first became a star by taking the sounds and traditions of New Orleans blues, jazz, and R&amp;B and twisting them into new forms&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; described him as a soul, funk and boogie-woogie musician who &quot;became a New Orleans musical icon not as a pop star of the present, but as a channeler of those who came before.&quot; &quot;NPR&quot; placed his style within New Orleans rhythm and blues. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; said that he was known &quot;for his influential brand of blues rock&quot;. He was also a &quot;major swamp rock artist&quot;, according to &quot;Americana UK&quot;.

== Personal life and death ==
Dr. John was married three times and told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he had &quot;a lot&quot; of children.

His first wife was Lydia Crow, with whom he had two children, Craig and Karla. His second wife was Lorraine Sherman, with whom he had three children: Tara, Jessica, and Jennifer. His third wife was Cat Yellen. His children Craig and Jessica predeceased him. He also had a granddaughter, Stephanie, and a grandson named Allen O&#x27;Quin who predeceased him.

He had a heroin addiction; however, in December 1989, he completed his final rehabilitation stint with the help of Narcotics Anonymous, and remained clean for the rest of his life.

On June 6, 2019, Dr. John died of a heart attack. His family announced through his longtime publicist Karen Dalton Beninato that he died at the break of day, and &quot;he created a unique blend of music which carried his hometown, New Orleans, at its heart, as it was always in his heart.&quot;

<text>RoadShow () is the first &quot;Multi-Media on-Board&quot; (MMOB) service system on transit vehicles in Hong Kong. It was launched by The Kowloon Motor Bus Holdings Limited (renamed as Transport International Holdings Limited (TIH)) in December 2000. The MMOB business was taken over by RoadShow Holdings Limited in 2001 prior to its listing on the Stock Exchange.

==The Corporation==
RoadShow Holdings Ltd (路訊通控股有限公司) was listed on the Stock Exchange on 28 June 2001 ) and is currently a member of the TIH Group.

RoadShow Holdings Limited is owned as to approximately 73% by TIH and the remaining 27% goes to public investors. There are four major wholly owned subsidiaries under RoadShow Holdings Limited. They are RoadShow Media Limited, Bus Power Limited, Leader Force Limited and RoadShow Creations Limited. At the same time, the group holds 60% shareholding interest in its subsidiary – Bus Focus Limited.

Subsidiaries of RoadShow were assigned to different business aspects.

===RoadShow Media Limited===
RoadShow Media Limited is engaged in the provision of media sales and management services for MMOB business.

===Bus Power Limited===
Bus Power Limited is engaged in the provision of media sales services for advertising on transit vehicle exteriors and interiors.

===Leader Force Limited===
Leader Force Limited is engaged in the provision of media sales for advertising on billboards.

===RoadShow Creations Limited===
RoadShow Creations Limited manages the merchandising business of the corporation. The business includes selling of a variety of commemorative items, bus models and souvenirs.

===Bus Focus Limited===
Bus Focus Limited has come into an agreement with KMB Group on the advertising on a number of bus shelters. Bus Focus Ltd enjoys the right to operate the advertising business on bus shelters while KMB Group receives a royalty on a revenue sharing basis, subject to a minimum payment.

==Business==
RoadShow business consists of three main areas: MMOB, Transit Network and Merchandising business.

===MMOB===
The Group&#x27;s MMOB business includes installing, operating and maintaining equipment and LCD units in transit vehicles for the transmission of tailor-made programmes and advertisements, source programme content and marketing and selling advertising on the MMOB system.

Roadshow provides entertainment and advertisements to the passengers of public transit vehicles in Hong Kong. The programmes are broadcast daily, to an audience of around 3 million, by a series of LCD monitors, each offering a 160° viewing angle, installed in over 4000 transit vehicles from KMB, Long Win Bus (a subsidiary of KMB), Citybus (Hong Kong) and AMS (maxicab).

Each bus has 4 high-resolution LCD screens, which included two 15-inch screens on the lower deck and two 17-inch screens on the upper deck. Audio bus TV broadcasts one-hour pre-recorded VCD programmes 16–18 times a day. The audio of the television broadcasts is delivered via 15 public speakers that line both sides of the passageways on the two decks with four-channel stereo systems.

===Transit network===
Another business of RoadShow is advertising on the transit vehicle exterior, interior or transit vehicle shelters. The advertisements make use of the visibility of transit vehicles or vehicle shelters in the street. This outdoor media platform provides over 4,200 buses with exterior panels on double deck buses together with 2,500 bus shelters panels for display of advertising space.
====Transit Vehicle Exteriors====
The advertising on the transit vehicle exterior is produced from a high resolution vinyl which can be visible from distance by pedestrians. Transit vehicle exterior advertising includes advertisements on the entire transit vehicle body as well as on panels on the sides and back of the transit vehicle. The vinyl displays are able to withstand the rigors of cleaning and all types of weather, and they can also be removed without harming the paint on the transit vehicle through the use of a special adhesive.
====Transit Vehicle Shelters====
While major transit vehicle shelters are traditional shelters, there are increasingly modern transit vehicle shelters constructed of lightweight stainless steel providing comfort to waiting passengers and also an advertising medium to advertisers. 
Transit vehicle shelter panels mostly have two sides, both of which can display advertisements. The back of the panels is illuminated to highlight the advertisements and to reach both the vehicular and the pedestrian audiences. Advertisements for display in transit vehicle shelters consist of posters supplied by the advertiser.
====Future Product Developments====
Bus stop stations called Cyber bus stops are interactive computer terminals locating at certain transit vehicle shelters along major routes as well as inside major transit vehicle terminals. Passengers and pedestrians can access to route information and website via touch-screen display panels. 
===Merchandising===
RoadShow merchandising business sells a variety of commemorative items, bus models and souvenirs with the KMB logo. The bus models sold are with special livery and replicate buses operated by Kowloon Motor Bus.

==Business in Mainland China==
RoadShow began operating on the Mainland in 2002 when it gained the rights to display advertising at the &quot;Lamplight Rainbow&quot; Tunnel on Huahai Road (淮海路) in Shanghai (上海). Subsequently, its assets grew to include bus bodies, bus shelters and telephone booths in Beijing (北京), Guangzhou (廣州) and Shenzhen (深圳). It also began offering advertising agency services for the Guangzhou Metro mass transit system and outdoor media assets in other regions such as Tianjin(天津), Chengdu(成都) and Xi&#x27;an(西安).

RoadShow has reduced its investments in mainland China since 2010 and focused on its advertising business in Hong Kong.

==Programming==
Recently all of the RoadShow&#x27;s programmes are prepared in a video compact disc (VCD). There are 3 different versions of VCD available in the 4,000 buses. There is a certain pattern in distributing different versions of disc, which version A and B will be available in 1,200 buses respectively and version C for 1,600 buses. All discs are distributed on a daily, random and rotational basis over the fleet.

Apart from TV advertisements, a number of programme segments have been introduced to RoadShow&#x27;s programme development. These segments are not only produced by the production team of RoadShow, but also from independent production bodies and other local (e.g. ATV and RTHK) and non-local media agencies (e.g. Phoenix TV and BBC and also Taiwan TV programmes).

In September 2001, RoadShow and ATV have agreed to become strategic partners and struck a 3-year deal that entitles RoadShow the exclusive right to show ATV programme highlights. TV drama highlights, weekly news summary, game show as well as infotainment programmes have been aired on RoadShow. In addition, RTHK is now providing programme content freely to RoadShow as well.

RoadShow also co-operates with other organisations and companies to produce programmes. For example, the programme &quot;Weekends Game Review&quot;, which introduced new PC games, was a co-product by RoadShow and Cross Media, a Hong Kong publication company. Besides, RoadShow also sponsors some outdoor activities, like concerts, and broadcasts the behind-the-scenes footage.

The content of segments can be categorised in the following classification.

Type [Example(s)]
* Cartoon [Charming Pink Panther]
* Celebrity Chat [RoadShow House of Stars]
* Family and Health [Strategy to Health]
* iClub Interactive Game [iClub Mobile Phone Ringtone Downloading, iClub Jetso Delivery]
* Infotainment [Youth Voice by Breakthrough, Trend Fascination, Police Information Station]
* Lifestyle [Delicacies in Hong Kong]
* Music and Movie [Music on Road and Power Pick]
* News and Current Affairs [Weekly News Summary]
* Science [Mobile Digital Station]
* Society, Education and Community [When We Were Young by RTHK, The Disney Oral Classroom, Oxfam: the Road to Poverty Alleviation in China, Haven of Hope Christian Service]
* Special [Your LegCo, Meeting Room of Scarlett Pong, Halloween Party for Singles]
* Sports and Recreation [J.League Soccer News]
* Travelogue [3 Minutes to the World]

Most of the RoadShow&#x27;s programmes are in Cantonese with Chinese language subtitles. But increasingly there are more English and Putonghua programmes available for passengers.

===Future development on programming===
KMB is now undertaking an experimental project to introduce the Global Positioning System (GPS) on bus tracking and bus fleet management. Apart from the traffic management purpose, the usage of GPS on the fleet can also provide real time information to RoadShow, which means that real time news, weather and traffic information will be available in RoadShow in the future.

However, in dense urban areas with congested high-rise buildings, the satellite signals to the GPS receiver are often blocked and the accuracy of the results adversely affected. KMB claims that GPS would only be installed to the whole fleet until the problem is solved.

==Advertisement==

MMOB serves as a mobile podium for advertising in Hong Kong. Its special feature is to provide a large number of passengers with frequent broadcasting on advertisements, those mobile advertisements can arouse consumers&#x27; impromptu intention on shopping. It is a popular channel for companies to promote their products for different reasons:

* When people watch television at home they are often engaged in other activities. They are sometimes eating, looking after their children, knitting, cooking etc. In this way watching television becomes a secondary activity. But at the bus the consumers don&#x27;t have a lot of other activities to engage in. Here, watching television becomes a primary activity.
* By choosing bus-routes for their commercials, advertisers can easily identify consumers travelling to shopping centres and entertainment venues on transit vehicles. They are on their way to spend money and will easily recall the information given by the advertisers while they are shopping.

In addition to MMOB services, RoadShow also served as the agency in managing a number of outdoor advertisements on exterior and interior of buses and in bus shelter panels in Hong Kong.

Advertising on RoadShow MMOB

Claimed as a mobile advertising media with large audience base, RoadShow provides different plans for their clients to place commercials. Price varies from the length of the commercial as well as the number of buses involved.

==Movement against RoadShow==

===A Captive Audience===
The main argument against MMOB argues the fact that the travellers cannot turn off the programs, turn down the volume or change channel. This implies that they cannot skip the commercials. Public transport franchises enjoy &quot;monopoly&quot; over many routes. Many passengers have no real alternative means of transport. The term &quot;captive audience&quot; is repeated. Human brain cannot ignore sound or vision. RoadShow&#x27;s website described bus television as &quot;a highly effective multi-media advertising platform that pushes your products and services to reach a mass audience in a captive environment&quot;.

On the other side, there are passengers who welcome MMOB. Especially short-distance travellers, welcome the free infotainment. By short-distance travellers, it means travellers who travel for less than 10 minutes. Others supporting bus television believe that the income from commercials will ultimately help to reduce pressure on fare increase and ensure more efficient public bus services.

===Anti-bus TV Noise Groups===
The introduction of this &quot;Multi-media on Board&quot; on franchised public transport is controversial.
Members of the public and newspaper columnists have complained in the media about the problems of noise pollution, ubiquitous commercialism, exploitation of passengers&#x27; captive situation, abuse of public transport franchises, and the lack of options for passengers who prefer not to watch or listen to television broadcasts.

The installation of commercial TV services in buses was met with opposition from its beginning. The opposition came from passengers who found the noise from commercial broadcasting on buses disturbing. A concern group called &quot;Hush the Bus&quot; (HTB, 靜巴運動) was formed on 4 May 2002. It aims to reduce passenger annoyance from bus TV. Prior to the establishment of HTB, what later became members of it lobbied against multi-media advertising on public transport under the ban of the &quot;Citizens Party&quot;. Members have met with government officials, legislators and executives of the bus companies. HTB has managed to continue to interact with its supporters and is persistent in its lobbying work. But in the main it has remained a minority. It has been argued that its activities highlight the weak power of environmental or civic groups contra profit-making corporations.

Also there is &quot;NO Bus on TV Project&quot;, which is supported by Hong Kong Consumer Advocates, established to protect kids from being captured by the broadcast of TV on public bus. They conduct surveys on buses and report the data on websites and they expose the flaw of why the bus companies so eager to run bus TV. They advocate safe and fair public transportation facilities in Hong Kong.

They claim that Bus TV violate riders&#x27; rights to freedom of choice. And while some advertisements, content of the programmes might have:
* violence
* debasing music
* movies not suitable for children
* adult movies
* boring talk show
* superstitious talk show
* aggressively pushing products and services
* manipulative ads which can bring great harms to people especially children.

They claim that Roadshow has interrupted their freedom as there are:
* no on-off switch
* no remote control
* no option not to be bothered

<text>Soyuz 15 (, &quot;Union 15&quot;) was an August 1974 crewed space flight which was to have been the second mission to the Soviet Union&#x27;s Salyut 3 space station with presumably military objectives.

Launched 26 August 1974, the Soyuz spacecraft arrived at the station, but cosmonauts Gennady Sarafanov and Lev Dyomin were unable to dock because the electronics in the Igla docking system malfunctioned. Without sufficient fuel for prolonged attempts at manual docking, the mission had to be abandoned. The cosmonauts powered down all nonessential systems in the Soyuz and waited until the next day for reentry. The crew landed 28 August 1974. Analysis of the launch window was cited by observers for concluding a flight of 19 to 29 days had been planned.

In the event of the failure, official TASS statements merely claimed that the mission was intended to practice docking maneuvers with the Salyut 3 station. They also said that a new automatic docking system was tested which would be used on future Progress transport craft.

The failed mission exposed a number of serious design flaws in the Soyuz 7K-T spacecraft, namely its lack of reserve propellant and electrical power for repeated docking attempts. In addition, the Igla docking system was found to be in major need of improvement. Since it was impossible to carry out these changes before Salyut 3 finished its operating lifespan, they had to wait for future space stations. The backup spacecraft for the Soyuz 15 mission was placed in storage and later flown as Soyuz 20 despite being past its intended shelf life.

<doc id="351369" wikidata="Q1122463" url="?curid=351369" title="Proposed directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions">
<text>The Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions (Commission proposal COM(2002) 92), procedure number 2002/0047 (COD) was a proposal for a European Union (EU) directive aiming to harmonise national patent laws and practices concerning the granting of patents for computer-implemented inventions, provided they meet certain criteria. The European Patent Office describes a computer-implemented invention (CII) as &quot;one which involves the use of a computer, computer network or other programmable apparatus, where one or more features are realised wholly or partly by means of a computer program&quot;.

The proposal became a major focus for conflict between those who regarded the proposed directive as a way to codify the case law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office (unrelated to the EU institutions) in the sphere of computing, and those who asserted that the directive is an extension of the patentability sphere, not just a harmonisation, that ideas are not patentable and that the expression of those ideas is already adequately protected by the law of copyright.

Following several years of debate and numerous conflicting amendments to the proposal, the proposal was rejected on 6 July 2005 by the European Parliament by an overwhelming majority of 648 to 14 votes.

==History==
===Original draft===
On 20 February 2002, the European Commission initiated a proposal for a directive to codify and &quot;harmonise&quot; the different EU national patent laws and cement the practice of the European Patent Office of granting patents for computer-implemented inventions provided they meet certain criteria (cf. software patents under the European Patent Convention). The directive also took on the role of excluding &quot;business methods&quot; from patentability (in contrast with the situation under United States law), because business methods as such are not patentable under the different European national patent laws or under the European Patent Convention.

Opponents of the original directive claimed that it was a thinly disguised attempt to make all software patentable. Supporters, however, argued that this was not the case since the proposal explained in several locations (pages 11, 14, 24, 25) that there should be no extension to the existing scope of patentability for computer programs and that pure business methods implemented in software would not be patentable. Only computer programs which provided a &quot;technical contribution&quot; would be patentable.

This reliance on the word &quot;technical&quot; was an important weakness in the directive, since it is not a word that has a well-defined meaning, and a &quot;technical contribution&quot; was only defined as being &quot;a contribution to the state of the art in a technical field which is not obvious to a person skilled in the art.&quot; (See Article 2 of the proposal). Nevertheless, the term has been used as a benchmark for what is and is not patentable by the European Patent Office and by individual national Patent Offices and courts in Europe (particularly the United Kingdom and Germany) since the early 1980s. A general understanding of its meaning can be gleaned from studying the resulting case law, summarised in Software patents under the European Patent Convention. The subsequent failure of the European Parliament to develop an acceptable definition of what was meant by the word technical illustrates the difficulty inherent in attempting to do so.

=== Transformation by the European Parliament ===
On 24 September 2003, the European Parliament passed the directive in a heavily amended form, which placed significant limits on the patentability of software. The most significant changes included:
* a definition of the &quot;technicity&quot; requirement for patentability which distinguishes between abstract information-processing processes and specific kinds of physical processes (only the latter are &quot;technical&quot;);
* a blanket rule that patents cannot be used to prevent interoperability between computer systems.

Patent attorney Axel H. Horns, however, voiced concern that Parliament&#x27;s wording might extend the ban on software patents to inventions potentially implementable in software, such as signal processing equipment.

Politically, these amendments were supported almost unanimously by small parties on both the right and left, while the larger groupings (socialists, liberals and conservatives) were all split, with the balance of socialists leaning in favour of amendment and the balance of conservatives leaning against.

Parliament&#x27;s amendments were a major defeat for the directive&#x27;s original proponents. Rather than confirming the practice of granting patents for computer programs which provide a technical contribution, the revised directive placed substantial limits on patentability.

=== Reversion by the Council of Ministers ===
Under the codecision procedure, both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers (representing national Governments) must approve a text in identical terms in order for a proposal to become law. On 18 May 2004, the Council agreed in an advisory vote to resubmit to Parliament what was described as a &quot;compromise version&quot; of the proposal. The agreed version permitted patenting of computer-implemented inventions (providing the inventions have a &quot;technical character&quot;) and overturned most of Parliament&#x27;s amendments. Critics of the Directive argued that the &quot;technical character&quot; requirement was open to too much interpretation and could lead to almost unlimited patentability of software. Proponents, also, felt that the amended version contained too many ambiguities to be capable of meeting the original purpose of the Directive, which was to harmonise the law across Europe. Nevertheless, the Council formally approved this resolution on 7 March 2005. The revised proposal was resubmitted to Parliament.

=== Developments between first Parliament decision and Council decision ===
Subsequently, in an unprecedented move, the Dutch national parliament passed a motion requesting that the nation&#x27;s ministerial representative on the council, Laurens Jan Brinkhorst, change his vote on the council&#x27;s version of the directive, from &quot;in favour&quot; to abstention. Brinkhorst stated that he would not do this. The council&#x27;s confirmation (or otherwise) of its President&#x27;s &quot;compromise&quot; had also been delayed.

The Polish government announced on 16 November 2004, that it could not &quot;support the text that was agreed upon by Council on 18 May 2004&quot;. A joint press release by the FFII, the Internet Society Poland, and NoSoftwarePatents.com, supported the concerns of opponents of the Council directive, stating:
at a meeting hosted by the Polish government on the 5th of this month, everyone including representatives of the Polish Patent Office, SUN, Novell, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, as well as various patent lawyers, confirmed that the present proposal of the EU Council does make all software potentially patentable. 

On 7 December 2004, the Belgian Minister of Economic Affairs, Marc Verwilghen, stated that no Council decision would be taken until 2005 &quot;for the reason that the qualified majority does not exist anymore&quot;. However, amid rumours of a change in the Polish position, 13–15 December meeting of the council&#x27;s Committee of Permanent Representatives determined that a qualified majority appeared to exist, and that the council&#x27;s revised version of the directive would be scheduled for formal adoption by the council, without further debate, probably at the Agricultures and Fisheries Council meeting on 21 and 22 December 2004.

Statements expressing reservations were attached to this Common Position by Belgium (which abstained), France (which hoped for further changes to the directive), the Netherlands (where the parliament requested their representative vote against), Poland (which was opposed until recent diplomatic pressure), Hungary and Latvia. Germany was ambivalent, saying that the text of the directive could benefit from improvements.

Due to the expressed reservations and especially to opposition from Poland, whose Minister of Science and Information Technology made a special journey to Brussels to demand that the directive be dropped from the agenda, the council&#x27;s vote was postponed &quot;indefinitely&quot;.

Meanwhile, a group of 61 MEPs from 13 countries tabled a &quot;motion for a resolution&quot; to restart the entire legislative process. On 2 February 2005, JURI, the Legal Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, voted 19–1 in favour of asking the commission to withdraw the directive and restart the process.

The next day, Nicolas Schmit, deputy foreign minister of Luxembourg (which at that time chaired the council), said that he would instead ask the council to formally adopt the draft directive at a meeting on 17 February. Although Poland stated it would only oppose this if other countries raised an objection, reports of opposition from Denmark, the Netherlands and Spain ensured that the common position was not on the agenda for that meeting of the commission.

On 17 February, Parliament&#x27;s Conference of Presidents (the President of the Parliament and the leaders of the political groups) approved JURI&#x27;s request to restart the process, and agreed to pass the request to the European Commission. On 24 February, a plenary session of the European Parliament reinforced this message, inviting the commission to reconsider, but on 28 February the Commission refused the parliament&#x27;s request.

The &quot;common position&quot; reappeared on the agenda of the council&#x27;s 7 March meeting as an &quot;A-item&quot; for adoption without discussion. At the Competitiveness meeting of the council, Denmark requested that this be removed. The President of the council, seemingly in breach of the council&#x27;s procedures, opposed this, &quot;for administrative reasons&quot; and because it would defeat the logic of the directive. The Danish representative accepted this at face value, declined to object formally, and entered Denmark&#x27;s objections into the record. The common position was thus adopted without debate, and referred to the European Parliament for a second reading, with dissenting statements and caveats from a number of countries. In the event, only Spain had actually voted against: Austria, Belgium and Italy abstained (which has the same effect as voting against, given the way Qualified Majority Voting works).

=== Second reading in Parliament ===
In June 2005, the legal affairs committee of the European Parliament discussed the directive and rejected plans for a complete overhaul of the directive. The vote by the committee took place on 21 June 2005, and narrowly decided not to substantially amend the Council version of the directive. According to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, this &quot;vote marks a turning point in the protracted battle over the law, which has split the software industry and sparked severe recriminations.&quot;
On 5 July 2005, the committee&#x27;s report passed to a plenary session of Parliament for debate by all MEPs. On 6 July 2005, Parliament rejected the proposal by a very large majority (648 in favour of rejection, 14 against and 18 registered abstentions out of 729 total MEPS) without considering any of the other 175 proposed amendments. Under the codecision procedure, the legislative process ended with this rejection and the proposed directive did not become law in any form. This was the first and the only time a directive was ever rejected by Parliament at second reading.

The vote was the result of a compromise between the different parties: those in favour of software patents feared a text that would heavily limit its scope, while those against rejected the whole principle. Heavy defeat was the &quot;least worst option&quot; to both sides. In addition, some saw the defeat as an expression of Parliament&#x27;s indignation about the handling of the proposal by the Council of the European Union and the European Commission as well as its concerns about the content of the proposal itself.

=== Consequences of the rejection ===
Parliament&#x27;s decision to strike down the final draft has the effect that national laws will not be harmonised. National legislatures may continue to enact laws allowing patents on computer-implemented inventions, should they wish to do so, and national courts may enforce such laws. The European Patent Office, which is not legally bound by any EU directive but generally adapts its regulations to new EU law, has no reason or incentive to adapt its practice of granting patents on computer-implemented inventions under certain conditions, according to its interpretation of the European Patent Convention and its Implementing Regulations.

== Reactions ==
=== Supporters ===
Supporters of the proposed directive included Microsoft, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and the European Patent Office.

The European Information and Communication Technology Association (EICTA) stated that the directive &quot;is extremely important for the future of innovation in Europe as it concerns two-thirds of all inventions in the European hi-tech industry&quot;. This position was characterised by opponents of software patents as &quot;dominated by patent lawyers from the patent arms of large corporate members&quot;, &quot;most of which qualifying as non-European companies&quot; and &quot;with a patent policy (...) tailored to the special interests of a few large corporations (...)&quot;. After the heavily modified draft directive was finally rejected, EICTA&#x27;s Director General said, &quot;This is a wise decision that has helped industry to avoid legislation that could have narrowed the scope of patent legislation in Europe. ... Parliament has today voted for the status quo, which preserves the current system that has served well the interests of our 10,000 member companies, both large and small.&quot;

=== Opponents ===
The proposal provoked public disagreement by diverse opponents of software patents, who argued that software patents were neither economically desirable nor mandated by international law. The FFII and the EuroLinux Alliance played key roles in co-ordinating this campaign, which drew support from some free software and open source programmers, some academics, some small business groups, and some proprietary software developers. Many of these organisations expressed concern over what they saw as abuses of the software patent system in the US, and argued that although some software patents might be beneficial, the net effect of the commission&#x27;s proposals would be to suppress innovation and dampen legitimate competition. The opponent&#x27;s campaign in its turn was characterised by supporters of the directive as &quot;a small but highly organised and vocal lobby&quot;, with EICTA stating that &quot;Those who depict the draft directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions as some sort of &#x27;software patent law&#x27; are at best misinformed and at worst dishonest, malicious and disrespectful of the European democratic process&quot;.

Figures who have supported the campaign against software patents in Europe include Tim Berners-Lee, developer of the World Wide Web; Florian Müller, a free software lobbyist; the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, a not for profit international tech trade association, and Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux kernel. Politicians opposed to the directive included Michel Rocard.

==Aftermath==

As the directive was rejected, pre-existing law has remained in place, and computer-implemented inventions are currently governed by Article 52 of European Patent Convention. Article 52 prohibits certain patents, including patents on &quot;programs for computers&quot;, but only &quot;as such&quot;. It is often interpreted by European Patent Office as well as by courts in EU countries, that invention should have &quot;technical character&quot;. For example, while a mathematical method is not patentable, the application of such method to electrical filter design would not usually be excluded from patentability by Article 52(2) and (3).

Final interpretation of the law in this area thus continues to be the responsibility of national courts, following national case-law (except when a European patent application is refused or when a European patent is revoked in opposition proceedings before the EPO, in which case the EPO has the final say regarding the interpretation of the EPC).

<doc id="351372" wikidata="Q847013" url="?curid=351372" title="Soyuz 16">
<text>Soyuz 16 (, &quot;Union 16&quot;) was a December, 1974, crewed test flight for a joint Soviet-United States space flight which culminated in the Apollo–Soyuz mission in July 1975. The two-man Soviet crew, Anatoly Filipchenko and Nikolai Rukavishnikov, tested a docking ring and other systems to be used in the joint flight.

== Crew ==
=== Backup crew ===
=== Reserve crew ===
== Mission parameters ==
*Mass: 
*Perigee: 
*Apogee: 
*Inclination: 51.7°
*Period: 88.4 minutes

== Background ==
The Soyuz 16 mission was the final rehearsal and first crewed mission in a program which culminated in the Apollo–Soyuz (ASTP) mission seven months later. The Soviet Union and the United States, Cold War rivals, had signed several arms control treaties in the 1960s and 1970s, and had entered into a period of detente by the early 1970s. In 1972, a treaty was signed to participate in a joint crewed space flight as a symbol of this detente.

Early concepts for a joint flight included the docking of a Soyuz craft to the American Skylab space station, or an Apollo vehicle docking with a Salyut space station. Once the Americans abandoned their Skylab station in 1974, the Apollo-Salyut concept seemed to be the logical choice, but since the Soviets had started to develop a universal docking adapter for the mission and feared having to publicly reveal details of their military-focused Salyut missions, the two powers opted to link a Soyuz spacecraft with an Apollo spacecraft.

Three test flights of an uncrewed version of the ASTP spacecraft were flown: Kosmos 638, launched 3 April 1974; Kosmos 652, launched 15 May 1974; and Kosmos 672, launched 12 August 1974. These three flights, and Soyuz 16, were all launched with an improved version of a Soyuz booster.

== Mission highlights ==
In an unprecedented move, Soviet planners offered to inform their NASA counterparts of the time of the launch, as long as they did not reveal that time to the press. NASA officials refused to agree to that condition and, accordingly, were informed of the launch an hour after it occurred, on 2 December 1974.

During the flight, Cosmonauts Anatoly Filipchenko and Nikolai Rukavishnikov tested the androgynous docking system to be used for the ASTP mission by retracting and extending a simulated 20 kg American docking ring. The crew also tested modified environmental systems, new solar panels and improved control systems, as well as a new radar docking system. Air pressure was reduced from 760 mm to 540 mm and oxygen raised from 20% to 40% to test reducing the planned transfer time to Apollo from two to one hour. On 7 December 1974, the docking ring was jettisoned with explosive bolts to test emergency measures if the capture latches got stuck during the ASTP flight.

The craft landed 8 December 1974, near Arkalyk and was hailed a complete success. The mission duration, six days, matched the ASTP mission duration to within 10 minutes.

<text>Saint Giles (, , , , ; 650 - 710), also known as Giles the Hermit, was a hermit or monk active in the lower Rhône most likely in the 7th century. Revered as a saint, his cult became widely diffused but his hagiography is mostly legendary. A town that bears his name grew up around the monastery he purportedly founded, which became a pilgrimage centre and a stop on the Way of Saint James. 

==Historicity==
The legend of Giles connects him to Caesarius of Arles, who died in 543. In 514, Caesarius sent a messenger, Messianus, to Pope Symmachus in the company of an abbot named Aegidius. It is possible that this abbot is the historical figure at the basis of the legend of Saint Giles.

There are two forged Papal bulls purporting to have been issued by Pope John VIII in 878. Sometimes taken as authentic, they record that the Visigothic king Wamba founded a monastery for Giles and that Pope Benedict II granted a charter to this foundation in 684–685. In actuality, the monastery was not dedicated to Saint Giles before . The tomb of Giles dates to the correct historical period, but the inscription is from the 10th century.

==Legend==
Giles is the subject of an elaborate and largely unhistorical anonymous Latin legend first attested in the 10th century. He was a Greek, and, according to the &quot;Legendae Aurea&quot;, he was the son of King Theodore and Queen Pelagia of Athens.

Although born in Athens, Giles lived in retreats near the mouth of the Rhône and by the River Gard in Septimania in the Visigothic Kingdom. The &quot;Legenda Aurea&quot; links him with Arles, but finally he withdrew deep into the forest near Nîmes, where in the greatest solitude he spent many years, his sole companion being his beloved deer, or red deer, who in some stories sustained him on her milk. Giles ate a Christian vegetarian diet. This retreat was finally discovered by the king&#x27;s hunters, who had pursued the deer to its place of refuge. An arrow shot at the deer wounded the saint instead, who afterwards became a patron of the physically disabled. The king, by legend, was Wamba, an anachronistic Visigoth, but must have been a Frank in the original story due to the historical setting. He held the hermit in high esteem for his humility in rejecting all honours save having some disciples. Wamba built him a monastery in his valley, Saint-Gilles-du-Gard, which Giles placed under the Benedictine rule. He died there in the early part of the 8th century, with the highest repute for sanctity and miracles.

A 10th-century &quot;Vita sancti Aegidii&quot; recounts that, as Giles was celebrating Mass to pardon Emperor Charlemagne&#x27;s sins, an angel deposited upon the altar a letter outlining a sin so terrible Charlemagne had never dared confess it. Several Latin and French texts, including the &quot;Legenda Aurea&quot; refer to this hidden &quot;sin of Charlemagne&quot;. This legend, however, contradicts the well-established later dates for the life of Charlemagne ( – 28 January 814).

A later text, the &quot;Liber miraculorum sancti Aegidii&quot; (&quot;The Book of Miracles of Saint Giles&quot;) served to reinforce the flow of pilgrims to the abbey.

==Veneration==

The town of St-Gilles-du-Gard sprang up around the abbey allegedly founded by him in the 7th century. That abbey (which was rededicated to him in the 10th century) remained the centre of his cult, which was particularly strong in Languedoc, even after a rival body of Saint Giles appeared at Toulouse. 

His cult spread rapidly far and wide throughout Europe in the Middle Ages, as is witnessed by the churches and monasteries dedicated to him in France, Spain, Germany, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and Great Britain; by the numerous manuscripts in prose and verse commemorating his virtues and miracles; and especially by the vast concourse of pilgrims who from all Europe flocked to his shrine. He was one of the most popular saints in the Middle Ages. 

In 1562, the relics of the saint were secretly transferred to Toulouse to protect them from the Huguenots and the level of pilgrimages declined. The restoration of most of the relics to the abbey of Saint-Gilles-du-Gard in 1862 and the publicized rediscovery of his former tomb there in 1865 helped the pilgrimages recommence.

Saint Giles is the patron saint of people with disabilities and is also invoked as a saint for childhood fears, convulsions, depression, particularly in Normandy, for example in Eure Iville, Saint-Germain-Village or Bernay or in Calvados, Gilles Touques. In medieval art, he is depicted with his symbol, the hind (female deer). His emblem is also an arrow. Giles is one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, and the only non-martyr, initially invoked as protection against the Black Death. His feast day is 1 September.

Besides Saint-Gilles-du-Gard, nineteen other cities bear his name. Cities that possess relics of St. Giles include Saint-Gilles, Toulouse and many other French cities; Antwerp, Brugge and Tournai in Belgium; Cologne and Bamberg in Germany (known as Egidien); Rome and Bologna in Italy; Prague in the Czech Republic; and Esztergom in Hungary. Giles is also the patron saint of Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, where St. Giles&#x27; High Kirk is a prominent landmark. He is also the patron saint of Graz, Nuremberg, Osnabrück, Sankt Gilgen, Brunswick, Wollaberg, Saint-Gilles (Brussels Capital Region) and Sint-Gillis-Waas. In 1630, the church of Sant&#x27;Egidio in Trastevere in Rome was dedicated to him, and which since 1968 has housed the lay Community of Sant&#x27;Egidio.

The centuries-long presence of Crusaders, many of them of French origin, left the name of Saint Giles in some locations in the Middle East. Raymond of St Gilles lent his name to St. Gilles Castle () in Tripoli, Lebanon.

Giles of Provence is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 1 September.

<doc id="351386" wikidata="Q383240" url="?curid=351386" title="Vauxhall and I">
<text>Vauxhall and I is the fourth studio album by English alternative rock musician Morrissey. It was released on 14 March 1994, by the record label Parlophone in the UK and Sire/Reprise in the US.

== Background ==
The album&#x27;s title may be a reference to the 1987 film &quot;Withnail and I&quot;. Vauxhall is an area of London noted for its gay clubs, and there is also a British car manufacturer of the same name.

&quot;Spring Heeled Jim&quot; contains bits of dialogue from &quot;We Are the Lambeth Boys&quot;, a 1959 documentary that follows the lives of members of a south London youth club. The line &quot;Don&#x27;t leave us in the dark&quot; at the end of &quot;Billy Budd&quot; is sampled from the 1948 David Lean film adaptation of Dickens&#x27; &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. This was said by one of Fagin&#x27;s pickpockets to Fagin when the mob was closing in on their hiding place. The song itself shares the title with a novella by Herman Melville.

== Release ==
&quot;Vauxhall and I&quot; was a success in the United States, making the top 20. It was also Morrissey&#x27;s second solo album to reach the top of the charts in Britain, the first being &quot;Viva Hate&quot;.

The lead single off the album, &quot;The More You Ignore Me, the Closer I Get&quot;, became the only song by Morrissey or the Smiths to achieve chart success in the United States, where it reached number 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. In the United Kingdom, the song hit number 8 on the UK Singles Chart and was the only single by Morrissey to reach the top ten during the 1990s.

== Reception ==
&quot;Q&quot; listed &quot;Vauxhall and I&quot; as one of the top ten albums of 1994. In February 2006, the same magazine voted it at number 89 on its list of the best albums ever.

In a three out of four star review, Lorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times wrote that &quot;Morrissey’s poetic, frank lyrics and cultured, despairing croons seem less inhibited than in his previous solo works.&quot;

In a retrospective review from 2014, Jason Heller of Pitchfork wrote that &quot;besides being one of Morrissey’s most vital solo albums, Vauxhall and I is also his first truly mature one, and flaws and all, it’s as essential—and as perversely alive—as ever.&quot;

In a list published in 2014, the NME named &quot;Vauxhall and I&quot; as Morrissey&#x27;s best solo album.

<text>Soyuz 17 (, &quot;Union 17&quot;) was the first of two long-duration missions to the Soviet Union&#x27;s Salyut 4 space station in 1975. The flight by cosmonauts Aleksei Gubarev and Georgy Grechko set a Soviet mission-duration record of 29 days, surpassing the 23-day record set by the ill-fated Soyuz 11 crew aboard Salyut 1 in 1971.

== Crew ==
=== Backup crew ===
=== Reserve crew ===
== Mission parameters ==
*Mass: 
*Perigee: 
*Apogee: 
*Inclination: 51.6°
*Period: 91.7 minutes

== Mission highlights ==
Salyut 4 was launched 26 December 1974, and Soyuz 17, with cosmonauts Georgy Grechko and Aleksei Gubarev as its first crew, was launched 16 days later on 10 January 1975. Gubarev manually docked Soyuz 17 to the station on 12 January 1975, and upon entering the new station he and Grechko found a note from its builders which said, &quot;Wipe your feet&quot;!

Salyut 4 was in an unusually high circular orbit of when Soyuz 17 docked with the station. Salyut designer Konstantin Feoktistov said this was to ensure propellant consumption would be half of what was needed for lower-altitude Salyuts.

The crew worked between 15 and 20 hours a day, including their 2 hour exercise period. One of their activities included testing communication equipment for tracking ships and contacting mission control via a Molniya satellite. Astrophysics was a major component of the mission, with the station&#x27;s solar telescope activated on 16 January 1975. The crew later discovered that the main mirror of the telescope had been ruined by direct exposure to sunlight when the pointing system failed. They resurfaced the mirror on 3 February 1975 and worked out a way of pointing the telescope using a stethoscope, stopwatch, and the noises the moving mirror made in its casing.

On 14 January 1975, a ventilation hose was set up from Salyut 4 to keep the Soyuz ventilated while its systems were shut down. On 19 January 1975, it was announced that ion sensors were being used to orient the station, a system described as being more efficient. A new teleprinter was used for communications from the ground crew, freeing the Salyut crew from constant interruptions during their work.

The cosmonauts began powering down the station on 7 February 1975 and they returned to Earth in the Soyuz capsule two days later, on 9 February 1975. They safely landed near Tselinograd in a snowstorm with winds of 72 km/h and wore gravity suits to ease the effects of re-adaptation.

Soyuz-17 Cliff in Antarctica is named after the mission.

He was the bishop of Freising from 1138. Otto participated in the Second Crusade; he lived through the journey and reached Jerusalem, and later returned to Bavaria in the late 1140s, living for another decade back in Europe.

== Life ==
Otto was born in Klosterneuburg as the fifth son of Leopold III, margrave of Austria, by his wife Agnes of Waiblingen, daughter of Emperor Henry IV. By her first husband, Frederick I of Hohenstaufen, duke of Swabia, Agnes was the mother of the German king Conrad III and grandmother of the emperor Frederick Barbarossa. Otto&#x27;s sister, Judith of Babenberg, was married to William V, Marquis of Montferrat. Otto was thus related to the most powerful families in Germany and northern Italy.

The records of his life are scanty and the dates somewhat uncertain. He studied in Paris, where he took an especial interest in philosophy. He is said to have been one of the first to introduce the philosophy of Aristotle into Germany and served as provost of a new foundation in Austria.

Having entered the Cistercian order, Otto convinced his father to found Heiligenkreuz Abbey in 1133, thus bringing literacy and sophisticated agriculture (including wine making) to the region that would become Vienna. He became abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Morimond in Burgundy about 1136, and soon afterwards was elected bishop of Freising. This diocese, and indeed the whole of Bavaria, was then disturbed by the feud between the Welfs and the Hohenstaufen, and the church was in a deplorable condition; but a great improvement was brought about by the new bishop in both ecclesiastical and secular matters.

In 1147 Otto took part in the disastrous Second Crusade. The section of the crusading army led by the bishop was decimated, but Otto reached Jerusalem and returned to Bavaria in 1148 or 1149. He enjoyed the favour of Conrad&#x27;s successor Frederick I, was probably instrumental in settling the dispute over the duchy of Bavaria in 1156, and was present at the famous diet of Besançon in 1157. Otto mentions that Frederick I ushered in a new age of peace following years of instability and civil war.

Still retaining the habit of a Cistercian monk, he died at Morimond on 22 September 1158. In 1857 a statue of the bishop was erected at Freising, Bavaria.

== Works ==
Otto is most remembered for two important historical works:

===&quot;Chronica de duabus civitatibus&quot;===
The first of these is his &quot;Chronica sive Historia de duabus civitatibus&quot; (&quot;Chronicle or The History of the Two Cities&quot;), a historical and philosophical work in eight books, which follows to some extent the lines laid down by Augustine of Hippo and Paulus Orosius. Written during the time of the civil war in Germany (1143–1145), it contrasts Jerusalem and Babel, the heavenly and the earthly kingdoms, and also contains much valuable information about the history of his own time. The chronicle, which was held in very high regard by contemporaries, covers the years up until 1146, and from this date until 1209 it was continued by Otto, abbot of St Blasius (died 1223). In the &quot;Chronica&quot;, Otto reports a meeting he had with Bishop Hugh of Jabala, who told him of a Nestorian Christian king in the east named Prester John. It was hoped this monarch would bring relief to the crusader states. This is the first documented mention of Prester John.

The text details a period of harmony between the imperial and ecclesiastical authority which had followed from the conversion of Rome to Christianity. Rome was seen as the fourth and final world empire. After that, authority was transferred to the Greeks (Byzantines), then the Franks (Francia) and later the Germans (East Francia). Also, he noted that Conrad III was the 93rd emperor from Augustus with Frederick I being the 94th. However, Pope Gregory VII&#x27;s unexpected excommunication of Emperor Henry IV in 1075 had shattered this unity. And this would thus usher in the seventh and last age in mankind&#x27;s history. This period would be characterised with incessant crises that would precede the arrival of the Antichrist. Which would be a topic of the eighth and final book of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;.

===&quot;Gesta Friderici Imperatoris&quot;===
Better known is Otto&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Friderici imperatoris&quot; (&quot;Deeds of Emperor Frederick&quot;), written at the request of Frederick I and prefaced by a letter from the emperor to the author. The &quot;Gesta&quot; comprises four books, the first two of which were written by Otto and the remaining two, or parts of them, by his pupil Ragewin or Rahewin. It has been argued that the third book and the early part of the fourth were also the work of Otto. Beginning with the quarrel between Pope Gregory VII and the emperor Henry IV, the first book takes the history down to the death of Conrad III in 1152. It is not confined to German affairs, as the author digresses to tell of the preaching of Bernard of Clairvaux, of his zeal against the heretics, and of the condemnation of Pierre Abélard; he also discourses on philosophy and theology. The second book opens with the election of Frederick I in 1152 and deals with the history of the first five years of his reign, especially in Italy, in some detail. From this point (1156) the work is continued by Ragewin. Otto&#x27;s Latin is excellent, and in spite of a slight partiality for the Hohenstaufen, and some minor inaccuracies, the &quot;Gesta&quot; has been described as a &quot;model of historical composition.&quot;

<doc id="351395" wikidata="Q4668451" url="?curid=351395" title="Abortion in Canada">
<text>Abortion in Canada is legal throughout pregnancy and is publicly funded as a medical procedure under the combined effects of the federal &quot;Canada Health Act&quot; and provincial health-care systems. However, access to services and resources varies by region. While some restrictions exist, Canada is one of the few nations with no criminal restrictions on abortion. Abortion is subject to provincial healthcare regulatory rules and guidelines for physicians. No jurisdiction offers abortion on request at 24 weeks and beyond, although there are exceptions for certain medical complications.

Formally banned in 1869, abortion would remain illegal in Canadian law for the next 100 years. In 1969, the &quot;Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968–69&quot; legalized therapeutic abortions, as long as a committee of doctors certified that continuing the pregnancy would likely endanger the woman&#x27;s life or health. In 1988, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in &quot;R. v. Morgentaler&quot; that the existing law was unconstitutional, and struck down the 1969 Act. The ruling found that the 1969 abortion law violated a woman&#x27;s right to &quot;life, liberty and security of the person&quot; guaranteed under Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms established in 1982.

In Canada, all surgical abortions are performed by a physician, with nurse practitioners, pharmacists and midwives able to provide medications for non-invasive medical abortions within nine weeks (63 days) of gestation. Canada has had a relatively stable abortion rate since decriminalization; the rate of recorded abortion per 1000 women of childbearing age (15–44) was 10.2 in 1974, rising to 16.4 abortions per thousand women in 1997, and declining to 10.1 abortions per 1000 women in 2020. However, these rates of abortion only reflect the number of abortions reported by abortion clinics and hospitals. They do not account for unreported abortions in these setting or count abortions induced by prescription drugs such as mifepristone and misoprostol taken at home, and so these official rates of abortion undercount the true rate of abortion. Nevertheless, Canada has a low abortion rate overall compared to other countries, with approximately 74,000 abortions reported in 2020. Roughly half of abortions occur among women aged 18 to 29 years and roughly 90% of abortions are performed within the first trimester (12 weeks).

==History==
=== Early history ===
During the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, abortion before the “quickening” (15–20 weeks) was legal in the British North American colonies. However, as the century progressed, the United Kingdom began to pass laws which created criminal offences relating to abortion, such as the &quot;Malicious Shooting or Stabbing Act 1803&quot;, that made performing or attempting to perform a post quickening abortion a death penalty offence. That was followed in 1837 by the &quot;Offences Against the Person Act 1837&quot;, that removed the death penalty clause, while making the procurement of any miscarriage unlawful. The British North American provinces followed the British example and began restricting abortion rights. Abortion was prohibited in Canada in 1869, two years after the country&#x27;s formation. That prohibition was continued in the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; until 1969. Anyone who procured a miscarriage for a woman was liable to imprisonment for life, while a woman who procured a miscarriage for herself was liable to imprisonment for two years.

As in other countries, illegal abortions were still performed, and some cases charged that this led to the deaths of women. The abortion trial of Emily Stowe (1879) is one early example. Another such case, &quot;Azoulay v. The Queen&quot;, reached the Supreme Court in 1952. In both cases, the alleged abortion provider was ultimately acquitted of responsibility for the woman&#x27;s death. Abortion rights activist Marilyn Wilson, former executive director of the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League, says, &quot;Illegal abortions were common, but often of poor safety. Several hundred women per year died from botched abortions.&quot;

=== Liberalisation of abortion laws ===

==== Chief Coroner Shulman ====

The movement to liberalize Canada&#x27;s abortion laws began in the 1960s. Former Chief Coroner of Ontario Morton Shulman recalls that in the sixties, abortion could be legally performed only to save the life of the woman, so there were practically no legal abortions. He stated that the pregnant daughters of the rich were sent to reliable physicians who did abortions for cash. He estimated that these physicians did twenty to thirty abortions per week. Women who were not rich were left to perform an abortion on themselves or go to what he called a &quot;nurse&quot; abortionist. Their method was commonly pumping Lysol into the woman&#x27;s womb. The mortality rate was high and the infection rate was over 50%. He added, &quot;By the time I became Chief Coroner, I had had the unpleasant experience of seeing the bodies of some dozens of young women who had died as a result of these amateur abortions.&quot;

Shulman decided to publicize deaths from illegal abortions. He instructed his coroners to call a public inquest into each abortion death. He describes one case that he believes was the turning point, that of 34-year-old Lottie Leanne Clarke, a mother of three children, who died of a massive infection in 1964 after an illegal abortion in spite of medical treatment and antibiotics. At the inquest into her death, the jury recommended that the laws about therapeutic abortion be revised. Shulman added that a federal government committee should review the question of abortion and the law. Newspapers published editorials recommending the reform of the abortion law. In 1965, the Minister of Justice, Guy Favreau, wrote to Shulman that the recommendation would be considered in the program to amend the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. The eventual amendment closely followed the recommendations of the coroners&#x27; juries.

==== Partial de-criminalisation ====

In 1967, Justice Minister Pierre Trudeau introduced a bill which included an amendment to the provision of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; which prohibited abortions. The bill, known as the &quot;Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968–69&quot;, continued the basic prohibition on abortions, with the potential life sentence. However, the bill made an exception for abortions performed in a hospital with the approval of that hospital&#x27;s three-doctor therapeutic abortion committee. The committee would have to certify that the pregnancy would be likely to endanger the life or health of the pregnant woman. The term health was not defined, and therapeutic abortion committees were free to develop their own theories as to when a likely danger to &quot;health&quot; (which might include psychological health) would justify a therapeutic abortion.
This same bill also legalized homosexuality and contraception, and would be the subject of one of Trudeau&#x27;s most famous quotations: &quot;The state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation.&quot;

When he introduced the bill in 1967, Trudeau was Minister of Justice in the government of Prime Minister Lester Pearson. In 1968, Pearson retired and Trudeau succeeded him as prime minister. The bill did not pass before the 1968 election, but was re-introduced by John Turner, Minister of Justice in the Trudeau government. Parliament passed the bill in 1969. In the 1970 federal statute revision, the provision was re-numbered as s. 251 of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;.

====Badgley report====
In 1975, a Committee on the Operation of the Abortion Law was appointed &quot;to conduct a study to determine whether the procedure provided in the Criminal Code for obtaining therapeutic abortions [was] operating equitably across Canada&quot;, and to make recommendations &quot;on the operation of this law rather than recommendations on the underlying policy&quot;. The Committee, known as the Badgley Committee after its Chair, Dr. Robin F. Badgley, reported in January 1977. It found, quite simply, that &quot;the procedures set out for the operation of Abortion Law are not working equitably across Canada&quot;. In large part, this was because the intent of the law was neither clear nor agreed upon. Access to abortion as set out in the Criminal Code was not available for many women due to variations in distribution of hospitals and doctors, and in whether Therapeutic Abortion Committees were set up and in doctors&#x27; interpretations of &quot;health&quot; for women, ages of consent, and parental notification requirements. The report recommended better family planning to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, but their main conclusion was that abortion services were not being delivered as required.

=== Difficulties in access before decriminalization ===
By 1982, there were 66,319 legal abortions in Canada. Interpretation of the 1969 law varied widely between doctors and hospitals, leading to uneven access. The standard was the physical or mental well-being of the woman, to be decided by a hospital&#x27;s Therapeutic Abortion Committee. However, there was no requirement for a hospital to have a TAC to evaluate women. Only about one-third of hospitals had one. Some committees took a liberal stance and allowed most requests, while others blocked almost all requests. Access to legal abortions was easy in major metropolitan areas, but much harder outside large cities. In the province of Prince Edward Island, the lone Therapeutic Abortion Committee shut down, and there were no legal abortions in the province after 1982. The Therapeutic Abortion Committees often took days or weeks to make their decisions, pushing a pregnancy further along than it would have been otherwise. The women were not seen by the committee, and had no right to appeal a decision. Advocates for abortion rights believed that the choice should be made by the woman, rather than a panel of doctors.

Because of the lack of facilities in smaller provinces and rural areas, women were often forced to travel to major cities at their own expense. In Newfoundland, there was only a single gynaecologist who performed abortions. Many women had to buy expensive plane tickets to Toronto or Montreal to get an abortion. Other women chose to travel to the United States, where abortions became available at many private clinics after the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision in 1973. In 1982, 4,311 Canadian women travelled to the United States for an abortion.

=== Constitutional challenges to the abortion law ===
In defiance of the law, Dr. Henry Morgentaler began performing abortions at his clinic in Montreal without approval of a therapeutic abortion committee. He challenged the constitutionality of the abortion law on two separate occasions. The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed his first constitutional challenge in 1975, brought under the division of powers and the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;, but in 1988, the Supreme Court allowed his second challenge, brought under the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. The Court held that the abortion law was inoperative. Morgentaler eventually brought a third constitutional challenge, to a provincial law restricting access to abortions. He was successful in that challenge as well.

Morgentaler&#x27;s struggle prompted a nationwide movement to reform Canada&#x27;s abortion laws. In 1970, as part of the Abortion Caravan, 35 women chained themselves to the parliamentary gallery in the House of Commons, closing Parliament for the first time in Canadian history.

====First Morgentaler challenge: 1975====

In 1973, Morgentaler stated publicly that he had performed 5,000 abortions without the permission of the three-doctor committees, even going so far as to videotape himself performing operations.

The Crown prosecution service of Quebec prosecuted Morgentaler three times, and each time juries refused to convict him despite his outright admission that he had performed many abortions. The Crown appealed the first acquittal. In 1974, the Quebec Court of Appeal overturned the jury&#x27;s verdict of acquittal in the first case, substituted a guilty verdict, and returned the matter to the trial judge for sentencing.

Morgentaler then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada on several grounds, arguing that:
* the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; provision was unconstitutional under the division of powers;
* the provision was inoperative under the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;;
* the Court of Appeal did not have the authority to overturn the jury verdict of acquittal;
* the defence of necessity was available;
* s. 45 of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, which provided that a medical practitioner was not criminally liable for performing surgical procedures, was available as a defence.

In 1975, the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal by a 6–3 decision: &quot;Morgentaler v The Queen&quot;. The Court was unanimous that the provision was valid criminal law, and therefore within the constitutional authority of the federal Parliament; it did not intrude on provincial jurisdiction over health. The Court also held unanimously that the law did not infringe the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;.

The Court gave those rulings from the bench, with written reasons on these points later given by Chief Justice Laskin. However, the Court split 6–3 on the issues of necessity and s. 45 of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, which provided that a medical doctor who performed a surgery according to reasonable medical standards was immune from criminal liability:
* Six members of the Court, for reasons written by Justice Pigeon, held that the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; provisions respecting Crown appeals authorised the Court of Appeal to substitute a guilty verdict.
* Six members also held, for reasons given by Justice Pigeon and Justice Dickson, that the defences of necessity and s. 45 did not apply to the criminal offence of procuring an abortion.
* In dissent, three members of the Court, for reasons written by Chief Justice Laskin, would have held that the defences of necessity and s. 45 were available and therefore properly considered by the jury.

As a result, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction entered by the Court of Appeal and remitted the matter to the trial judge for sentencing. The trial judge imposed a sentence of eighteen months imprisonment.

Public outcry over the decision caused the federal government to introduce an amendment to the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; (commonly known as the Morgentaler Amendment) taking away the jurisdiction of appeal courts to substitute a conviction for a jury&#x27;s verdict of acquittal.

Following the third jury acquittal, the Quebec government declared that the law was unenforceable and no further charges were brought.

==== Second Morgentaler challenge: 1988 ====
Upon his release from prison in Quebec, Morgentaler decided to challenge the federal abortion law in other provinces. Over the next ten years, he opened and operated private abortion clinics across the country in direct violation of the law. Following a fourth jury acquittal in 1984, the Ontario government appealed the decision. The Ontario Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal and ordered a re-trial.

Morgentaler, in turn, appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court declared in 1988 the entirety of the country&#x27;s abortion law to be unconstitutional: &quot;R. v. Morgentaler&quot;. By a 5-2 decision, the Court held that section 251 of the Criminal Code was of no force or effect because it violated section 7 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. Section 7 states that: &quot;Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and the security of the person, and the right not to be deprived thereof, except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.&quot; The Court also held that the infringement could not be justified under s. 1 of the &quot;Charter&quot;, which in some cases allows a government to provide a reasonable justification for an infringement.

There was no single majority judgment. Chief Justice Dickson, Justice Beetz, and Justice Wilson all wrote decisions finding the law to be unconstitutional, but for varying reasons in support. Justice McIntyre wrote the dissenting opinion.

Chief Justice Dickson held that &quot;[f]orcing a woman, by threat of criminal sanction, to carry a fetus to term unless she meets certain criteria unrelated to her own priorities and aspirations&quot; infringed the woman&#x27;s right to security of the person, as protected by s. 7 of the &quot;Charter&quot;. Justice Wilson found that the law &quot;asserts that the woman&#x27;s capacity to reproduce is to be subject, not to her own control, but to that of the state&quot; which similarly breached the right to security of the person.

Having found that law infringed the right to security of the person, the majority then considered whether that infringement was consistent with the principles of fundamental justice, which is the second branch of s. 7 of the &quot;Charter&quot;. The judges in the majority agreed that the procedural requirements to obtain an abortion, as set forth in the law, were especially troublesome. Only accredited or approved hospitals could perform abortions, which imposed a barrier to local access. The law also specified that women wanting an abortion were required to obtain approval from a &quot;therapeutic abortion committee&quot; in a hospital. The committee was composed of at least three physicians appointed by the hospital&#x27;s board of members, and did not include the practitioner who was to perform the procedure. The court found that the committee requirement was deeply flawed, in part because of the long delays caused by the committees and that in many hospitals, the committees were merely committees on paper and did not actually approve abortions.

Chief Justice Dickson held that &quot;the structure – the system regulating access to therapeutic abortions – is manifestly unfair. It contains so many potential barriers to its own operation that the defence it creates will in many circumstances be practically unavailable to women who would &quot;prima facie&quot; qualify...&quot; Noted barriers included a lack of hospitals with committees, doctors who did not wish to refer matters to committees, the lack of a standard meaning for &quot;health&quot; leading to inconsistent standards among committees, and geographical and financial differentials in treatment. He concluded the provision violated the principles of fundamental justice.

The majority of the court in &quot;Morgentaler&quot; did not find it necessary to consider whether there was a substantive right to abortion under Section 7. Justice Wilson was of the opinion that such a right existed, but the other judges in the majority made their decision on procedural grounds, relating to the insufficiencies in the committee process.

===Attempts at a new law===
Following the 1988 Supreme Court decision, the Mulroney government made two attempts to enact a new abortion law.

In the spring of 1988, the government first attempted to find a compromise solution that would give easy access to abortion in the early stages of pregnancy and criminalize late term ones. The motion in the House of Commons was defeated 147 to 76, voted against by both MPs who opposed easy access to abortions and those who opposed adding any abortion rules to the Criminal Code.

The Supreme Court decision became an important issue in the 1988 federal election later that fall. Both the Progressive Conservative and Liberal parties were sharply divided on the issue and neither party advanced a concrete platform on the abortion issue. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney declared he was opposed to &quot;abortion on demand&quot;, but gave no details on what that meant legally. Liberal leader John Turner stated that MPs should be allowed to vote their conscience, but refused to give his own opinion on the issue. NDP leader Ed Broadbent had a firm position that abortion is a medical matter, not a criminal one, and should be left to a woman and her doctor. The Mulroney government was returned in the 1988 election.

In 1989, the government introduced a much stricter bill in the House of Commons. If enacted, it would ban all abortions unless a doctor ruled the woman&#x27;s life or health would be threatened. Anyone found in violation of the law could be imprisoned for up to two years. On May 30, 1990, the House of Commons passed the new bill by nine votes, with the cabinet being whipped in favour and most anti-abortion members supporting it. In June 1990, a teenager from Kitchener, Ontario, was injured during a botched abortion performed in a man&#x27;s home. Several days later, on June 13, a Toronto woman, Yvonne Jurewicz, died from a self-induced, coat-hanger abortion.
These cases were reported in the news and the latter case was discussed at multiple levels of government. Speaking in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, New Democratic MLA Darlene Marzari pointed out:

For our purposes, though technically speaking the bill has not been proclaimed, Bill C-43 is, in the minds of the public and in the minds of women, now law. In fact, while we&#x27;re dancing on the head of a pin and counting ourselves as angels, a woman in Toronto has died—she bled to death—three weeks ago. Her name was Yvonne Jurewicz, she was 20 years old and was probably afraid to go to the doctor and afraid to go to the hospital after she tried to abort herself. This is the sad fact of Bill C-43. While we debate the minor points of whether or not the Lieutenant Governor or the Governor-General of Canada has picked it up, we know that young women in this country are under the impression they will be considered criminals if they show up in an emergency ward door hemorrhaging.

Reform Party MP Deborah Grey, who supported the bill, denied that this death, the first known death from illegal abortion in Ontario in twenty years, could have anything to do with the publicity surrounding the passing of Bill C-43. But in Ontario, the connection was made. Richard Johnston, MPP suggested to Premier David Peterson that Ontario announce it would not start any third-party prosecutions against women or doctors, to prevent any further tragedies and to reassure doctors that they could go on providing services to the women of Ontario.

A few months later, the bill failed in the Senate on a tie vote. Under the rules of the Constitution in Section 36 of the Constitution Act of 1867, a tie meant the measure was defeated. The defeat was somewhat unexpected since it was the first time since 1941 that the Senate, whose members are appointed, had outright defeated legislation passed by the House. Eike-Henner Kluge, the director of the Canadian Medical Association ethics and legal affairs committee, viewed that the bill was flawed ethically. Kluge drafted an analysis for a Senate committee about Bill C-43 and his presentation may have swayed two votes to change resulting in a tie vote which resulted in the Senate not passing the Bill C-43.[5]

In the wake of the controversy surrounding passage of the Goods and Services Tax the Progressive Conservative government did not wish to provoke a contest of wills with the Senate and announced it would not re-introduce the legislation. The fact that no subsequent government has re-visited this decision has led to the situation of Canada having no criminal abortion law. Abortion is now treated like any other medical procedure, governed by provincial and medical regulations.

===Later cases relating to abortion===
The court in &quot;Morgentaler&quot; did not consider the question of whether the unborn were included in the &quot;everyone&quot; who have the right to life. At that time, another case before the courts would have raised that issue; it was brought by Joe Borowski, a former member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. However, after the &quot;Morgentaler&quot; decision, the Supreme Court held, in &quot;Borowski v Canada (AG)&quot;, that his case was moot since &quot;Morgentaler&quot; had struck down the provisions Borowski was challenging.

Two further cases, &quot;Tremblay v. Daigle&quot; and &quot;R. v. Sullivan&quot;, relied on the born alive rule, inherited from English common law, to determine that the fetus was not a person: Sullivan could not be charged with murder of a fetus and Tremblay could not seek standing in court as the guardian of a fetus. The 1989 Supreme Court of Canada case of &quot;Tremblay v Daigle&quot; is one of the most widely publicized cases concerning abortion in Canada after the law prohibiting abortions was overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada. Daigle&#x27;s ex-boyfriend obtained a restraining order against her having an abortion. While the restraining order was issued in Quebec, it was legally restricting Canada-wide. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that only the woman could make the choice; the man had no legal say in a woman&#x27;s choice to terminate a pregnancy or carry it to completion.

Daigle had already had a late second-term abortion before the Court ruled on her case. While the case was fast-tracked, the progress was so slow that Daigle would have been in the third-trimester had she waited for the ruling to be handed down. Daigle had an abortion in the United States while the case was before the Supreme Court of Canada. This was not made public until after the ruling, although it was not unexpected. This is in contrast to the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; case in the United States where Roe had carried the pregnancy to term. That case, however, was different from the &quot;Tremblay&quot; v. &quot;Daigle&quot; case in that it was about whether abortion was legal. In the &quot;Tremblay&quot; v. &quot;Daigle&quot; case, the question was whether a male partner has a say in whether a woman can obtain an abortion ruling.

Two further cases addressed the &quot;interest in the fetus&quot;. In &quot;Dobson (Litigation Guardian of) v. Dobson&quot;, a grandfather attempted to act on behalf of a child born with cerebral palsy, supposedly resulting from a car accident in which the mother was the driver. He attempted to sue the mother with negligence in driving. The mother was in favor of the suit succeeding as it would have provided her with funds to raise her disabled child; her insurance company was defending the suit through subrogation. Citing the case of &quot;Kamloops v. Nielsen&quot;, the Court decided that courts cannot impose a duty of care on a pregnant woman toward her fetus because it would interfere with the exercise of her autonomy rights during pregnancy and faced difficulty in defining a standard of care in pregnancy. Only a legislature can do this. In &quot;Winnipeg Child &amp; Family Services (Northwest Area) v. G. (D.F.)&quot;, the Supreme Court determined that a pregnant woman addicted to solvents could not be civilly committed for treatment.

== Accessibility and methods==

Surgical and non-invasive medical abortions in Canada are provided on request for any reason, are confidential for all ages and funded by Medicare; to those who are covered by provincial/territorial medical care plans (depending on the province or territory, this always includes Canadian citizens and permanent residents, but may vary on inclusion of international students, workers, and protected persons or refugee claimants). For those not covered by a medical care plan (e.g. Americans in states that prohibit abortion after the decision in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;), the federal government has committed to letting them obtain abortions in Canada without restriction. However, this will be contingent on their being able to pay for travel costs and the procedure themselves.

Nationally, abortion is legal through all nine months (40 weeks) of pregnancy, nevertheless no providers in Canada offer care beyond 23 weeks and 6 days. Restrictions are based on professional medical guidelines, resources available (equipment, trained personnel) and individual facility mandates makes access to all types of services vary by region within each province and territory. Each province and territory regulates and funds their own healthcare system. The federal government provides funding to each province and territory, provided they comply with the requirements of the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot;. One of those requirements is comprehensiveness, which means that all insured health services defined by the Act must be covered by a provincial or territorial health plan for that province or territory to receive federal funds. Abortion is not specifically mentioned in the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot;. It is simply included in the broad definition of &quot;insured health services&quot;, just like other medical and surgical procedures.

One-third of hospitals perform surgical abortions, and these perform two-thirds of surgical abortions in the country. The remaining surgical abortions are performed by public and private clinics. Medical abortions are available in Canada using medications such as methotrexate, misoprostol, or mifepristone. Mifepristone used in combination with misoprostol (brand name Mifegymiso) was approved for use in Canada when prescribed by a doctor on July 29, 2015. In 2017 the approval expanded to include prescribing abilities to nurse practitioners, midwives and pharmacist based on provincial regulations, and it may be dispensed by pharmacists directly to the patient.

Nationwide information is provided by advocacy associations such as the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada and National Abortion Federation that maintain detailed lists of abortion clinics by province and the maximum gestational period that the clinic will provide abortion types up to. These sites also provide information on how to obtain medication involving medical abortions, how to obtain financial support for travel/accommodation expenses, after-treatment supplies, child care and various other needs.

=== Accessibility by province and territory===

==Politics==
As of 2024, all federally represented political parties in Canada, as well as their leaders, support continued legal abortion access in Canada. While elected members of the Bloc Québécois, New Democratic Party, the Liberal Party of Canada, and the Green Party of Canada nearly universally support abortion rights and all these parties&#x27; MPs would be expected to vote against any hypothetical Bills that would restrict or limit abortion rights in any way, the Conservative Party of Canada has both members who favour abortion rights and members who oppose them and has stated that members would be allowed to vote their conscience on any vote concerning abortion. In the past, more Conservative members have been against abortion.

The Conservative Party has had to wrestle with combining the conflicting social policies of its two predecessor parties, the moderate right-wing Progressive Conservative Party and the more right-wing Canadian Alliance, which merged in 2003. Many socially conservative Alliance supporters were angered at the prospect of Belinda Stronach, who favoured abortion rights, winning the leadership election in early 2004, while in contrast, some Progressive Conservative supporters objected during the 2004 federal election to the new party&#x27;s perceived openness to legislation that would restrict abortion rights. In the March 2005 policy convention, in a narrow vote, the party voted to not introduce legislation on the subject of abortion (members can still introduce private members bills on the issue), although it condemns sex-selective abortions. The party&#x27;s stance on abortion is frequently voted on at the party&#x27;s policy conventions. Motion 312 was introduced by Conservative MP Stephen Woodworth in 2012, calling for a House of Commons committee to determine when human life begins, but was defeated 203–91. In 2013, Conservative MP Mark Warawa introduced a motion condemning discrimination against females through sex-selective abortion. In 2021, Conservative Cathay Wagantall introduced a private member&#x27;s bill that would prohibit a medical practitioner from performing a sex-selective abortion. Although the bill was defeated 248-82, a majority of Conservative MPs voted in favour of the bill.

Until recently, the Liberal Party had a few anti-abortion MPs, such as Liberal MP Paul Steckle introduced a bill that would have made abortion after 20 weeks gestation a criminal act in June 2006. Current Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau has required that all Liberal party candidates will have to vote according to the party&#x27;s abortion-rights policy since he assumed leadership of the Liberal Party in 2013.

Although the issue of abortion rights has popped up from time to time in federal elections as a wedge issue, the issue is consistently rated as a low priority for most Canadians. The Christian Heritage Party of Canada claims to be Canada&#x27;s only stated anti-abortion federal political party and supports a total abortion ban in Canada. However, they never had a member elected to parliament and won about only 0.05% of the vote in the 2021 Canadian federal election. The People&#x27;s Party of Canada supports banning abortion in Canada after 24 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for cases in which the life of the pregnant individual is in danger, serious fetal abnormalities, and when the pregnancy is a result of rape.

On October 19, 2012, anti-abortion protester Patricia Maloney expressed concern over 491 cases of live-birth abortions between 2000 and 2009. The finding reported to Statistics Canada did not include detailed information on how long each fetus survived after removal or how many would have been possible to save. Canada, unlike the United States, does not specifically have a law confirming or denying the legal rights of a baby who survives abortion. On January 23, 2013, Conservative MPs Wladyslaw Lizon, Leon Benoit, and Maurice Vellacott wrote a letter requesting that the RCMP investigate how many of the 491 live-birth abortions meet the definition of homicide set forth in the Criminal Code. When CBC and The Canadian Press used the phrase &quot;investigate all abortions performed after 19 weeks gestation&quot;, Vellacott accused the media outlets of false reporting and acknowledged that abortion in Canada is fully legal. The CBC / Canadian Press story was subsequently corrected. The move drew approval from Dr. Eike-Henner Kluge, former director of ethics and legal affairs for the Canadian Medical Association, who said that doctors should &quot;do the best [they] can for what is now a person in the eyes of the law&quot;. However, Dr. Douglas Black, president of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said that the situation is not one of homicide, but rather allowing fetuses &quot;to pass away, depending on what the circumstances are, sometimes in their mom&#x27;s arms&quot;.

==Opinion polls==

* In a March 2010 EKOS poll, a majority of Canadians (52%) describe themselves as &quot;pro-choice&quot; while just over one in four (27%) describe themselves as &quot;pro-life&quot;. One in ten respondents (10%) describe themselves as neither &quot;pro-choice&quot; nor &quot;pro-life&quot;, and 11% did not respond.
*In an IPSOS poll conducted in 2017, 77% said abortions should be permitted, which is higher than the global average of 71%. A majority of Canadians (53%) said abortion should be permitted whenever a woman decides she wants to abort, while 24% favoured access under only some circumstances, such as when a woman has been raped. A further 7% believed that abortion should only be permitted when a woman&#x27;s life is in danger, and 5% believed the procedure should be illegal under any circumstance; 11% said they were unsure.
*In a 2020 DART &amp; Maru/Blue Voice Canada poll, 75% of Canadians said they were “satisfied” with Canada&#x27;s abortion policies and 25% were not satisfied. The strongest satisfaction was found in Québec (85%), followed by British Columbia (75%), Ontario (72%), Alberta (70%), Atlantic Canada (68%), and Manitoba and Saskatchewan (70%). Satisfaction with Canada&#x27;s policies were nearly identical across gender and age groups, with slightly higher favourability amongst middle and high-income Canadians as compared with those earning less than CDN$50,000 (78% vs. 74%). In the poll, 71% of Canadians said that the government should not re-open the issue, and just 10% said they should re-open it; 8% professed indifference. Canadians were almost equally split on whether they thought the government should even discuss creating a regulatory framework for abortion. 70% of Canadians said they found abortion acceptable, vs. 10% who found it unacceptable; 11% professed indifference, and 10% said they didn&#x27;t know. 
*In a 2020 IPSOS poll, support for abortion rights were slightly stronger than in 2017: 59% of Canadians said that abortion should be permitted whenever a woman wants one, with 18% saying it should only be permitted under limited circumstances (such as after rape), and 6% saying it should only be legal if the mother&#x27;s life were in danger; just 4% said it should not be legal under any circumstances, while 13% either said they didn&#x27;t know or that they preferred not to express an opinion.
*A 2022 poll by Research Co found that 44% of Canadians believe that abortion should be legal under any circumstances, 37% think that abortion should be legal only under certain circumstances, and 10% think that abortion should be illegal in all circumstances. Support for legal abortion under any circumstances was highest in Quebec (50%), then Saskatchewan and Manitoba (47%), British Columbia (46%), the Maritime provinces (43%), Alberta (40%), and Ontario (39%). Support for legal abortion under any circumstances was highest among self-identified NDP voters (57%), followed by Liberal voters (48%), and Conservative voters (32%).
*A 2022 poll by the Angus Reid Institute found that 52% of Canadians describe themselves as being completely pro-choice, while 8% describe themselves as being completely pro-life, and 41% describe themselves as being somewhere in between these two positions.

==Abortion rights movement==
The abortion rights movement in Canada focuses on establishing abortion as a component of provincial health care plans, to ensure it is available in all regions, especially for those who couldn&#x27;t afford it otherwise.

Dr. Henry Morgentaler was widely seen as the one individual personifying the Canadian abortion rights movement, but organizations such as the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League (CARAL), Canadians for Choice, and the Pro-Choice Action Network also contributed significantly to advancing the abortion rights movement in Canada. CARAL folded, and was replaced by the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada, whose focus is on the objectives mentioned above. Feminist or pro-feminism organizations also contribute to promote the abortion rights approach.

The Canadian affiliate of Planned Parenthood, now known as the Canadian Federation for Sexual Health, is also in favour of abortion rights, and while it does refer pregnant women to abortion providers, it does not have a history (unlike its American counterpart) of engaging in widespread litigation in favour of legalized abortion.

==Anti-abortion movement==

The anti-abortion movement, which self-identifies as the pro-life movement, disapproves of the lack of legal restrictions on abortion in Canada and of abortions being funded by provincial health care programs, even if the abortion is not for therapeutic reasons. A medical reason for obtaining an abortion is no longer required in Canada since the 1988 decision of the Supreme Court finding that the abortion provisions of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; were unconstitutional.

The anti-abortion movement in Canada is represented by the Catholic Church, Prolife Alberta, The Wilberforce Project, Campaign Life Coalition, REAL Women of Canada, We Need A Law, Abortion in Canada, Action Life (Ottawa), Inc., among other organizations. Anti-abortion rallies or Marches for Life occur annually in Ottawa and in some provincial capitals, drawing thousands of people, although many of these marches were cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Violence towards abortion providers==
* In 1983, Henry Morgentaler was attacked by a man wielding garden shears; the attack was blocked by feminist activist Judy Rebick, who was standing nearby.
* In 1992, Morgentaler&#x27;s Toronto clinic was firebombed and sustained severe damage. The event occurred at night, so no one was injured, although a nearby bookstore was damaged. Appointments were switched to another clinic in Toronto and no abortions were prevented.
* On November 8, 1994, Vancouver doctor Garson Romalis was shot in the leg.
* On November 10, 1995, Dr. Hugh Short of Ancaster, Ontario, was shot in the elbow.
* On November 11, 1997, Dr. Jack Fainman of Winnipeg was shot in the shoulder.
* On July 11, 2000, Dr. Garson Romalis was stabbed by an unidentified assailant in the lobby of his clinic.

<text>The year 1888 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events, listed below.

==Events==
* International Exhibition of Science, Art and Industry, in Glasgow, Scotland.

==Astronomy==
* January 3 – The 91 cm refracting telescope at Lick Observatory is first used. The James Lick telescope is the largest refractor in the world at this time, and the observatory is the first established at the top of a mountain.
* The 76 cm refracting telescope is completed at Nice Observatory.
* John Louis Emil Dreyer&#x27;s &quot;New General Catalogue&quot; is published.

==Biology==
* June 30 – The Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom opens its laboratory on Plymouth Hoe.
* Seventeen biologists found the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA, which will become a major center of applied research.
* Peter Hermann Stillmark describes the isolation of ricin, thus founding the field of lectinology.

==Chemistry==
* Methyl isocyanate is discovered.
* Henri-Louis Le Chatelier states that the response of a chemical system perturbed from equilibrium will be to counteract the perturbation.
* Emil Fischer establishes the relation between glucose, fructose and mannose by passage to a common osazone.

==Geography==
* January 27 – The National Geographic Society is founded in Washington, D.C. by Gardiner Greene Hubbard.

==Mathematics==
* The American Mathematical Society is founded by Thomas Fiske.
* Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem is first proved by David Hilbert.
* Francis Galton introduces the concept of correlation in statistics.
* Richard Dedekind publishes &quot;Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?&quot; (&quot;What are numbers and what should they be?&quot;) which includes his definition of an infinite set.
* Sofia Kovalevskaya discovers the &#x27;Kovalevskaya top&#x27;.

==Meteorology==
* The global atmospheric temperature returns to normal, five years after the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa (Krakatau). The volcanic dust veil, that has created spectacular atmospheric effects, also acted as a solar-radiation filter, lowering global temperatures by as much as 1.2 degrees Celsius in the year after the eruption.

==Physics==
* Heinrich Rudolf Hertz discovers radio waves.

==Physiology and medicine==
* Carlo Martinotti describes cortical cells later known as &quot;Martinotti cells&quot;.
* Emile Roux and Alexandre Yersin isolate diphtheria toxin.
* Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz names the chromosome.
* German ophthalmologist Adolf Gaston Eugen Fick constructs and fits the first successful glass contact lens.

==Technology==
* January 3 – Marvin Stone is granted a United States patent for the paper drinking straw.
* April – American engineer Oliver B. Shallenberger invents a practical AC induction electricity meter.
* May 1 – Nikola Tesla is granted a US patent for the induction motor.
* May 15 – Emile Berliner is granted a US patent for the gramophone record.
* August 10 – Gottlieb Daimler flies in an airship designed by Dr. Frederich Wölfert powered by a Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft-built petrol engine.
* September 4 – George Eastman is granted a US patent for his roll film camera, for which he registers the trademark &quot;Kodak&quot;.
* October 3 – The first patent for a ballpoint pen is granted to John Loud, a British tanner who wishes to produce a writing instrument that can write on leather.
* October 14 – Louis Le Prince shoots the first recorded film, &quot;Roundhay Garden Scene&quot;, in Leeds, England, using a single lens camera and Eastman paper film.
* December 7 – John Boyd Dunlop patents the pneumatic bicycle tyre.

<text>In comparative mythology, sky father is a term for a recurring concept in polytheistic religions of a sky god who is addressed as a &quot;father&quot;, often the father of a pantheon and is often either a reigning or former King of the Gods. The concept of &quot;sky father&quot; may also be taken to include Sun gods with similar characteristics, such as Ra. The concept is complementary to an &quot;earth mother&quot;.

&quot;Sky Father&quot; is a direct translation of the Vedic &quot;Dyaus Pita&quot;, etymologically descended from the same Proto-Indo-European deity name as the Greek &quot;Zeûs Pater&quot; and Roman &quot;Jupiter&quot;, all of which are reflexes of the same Proto-Indo-European deity&#x27;s name, &quot;*Dyēus Ph₂tḗr&quot;. While there are numerous parallels adduced from outside of Indo-European mythology, there are exceptions (e.g. In Egyptian mythology, Nut is the sky mother and Geb is the earth father).

<text>Georgy Mikhaylovich Grechko (; 25 May 1931 – 8 April 2017) was a Soviet cosmonaut. He flew to space on three missions, each bound for rendezvous with a different Salyut space station. Soyuz 17 was the first crewed vehicle to visit Salyut 4, Soyuz 26 was the first crewed vehicle to visit Salyut 6, and Soyuz T-14 visited Salyut 7. During the latter mission, Grechko helped to relieve the crew of Soyuz T-13, who had repaired damage to the station.

== Biography ==
Grechko graduated from the Leningrad Institute of Mechanics with a doctorate in mathematics. He was a member of Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He went on to work at Sergei Korolev&#x27;s design bureau and from there was selected for cosmonaut training for the Soviet Moon programme. When that program was cancelled, he went on to work on the Salyut space stations.

Grechko made the first spacewalk in an Orlan space suit on 20 December 1977 during the Salyut 6 EO-1 mission.

He was twice awarded the medal of Hero of the Soviet Union.

He resigned from the space programme in 1992 to lecture on atmospheric physics at the Russian Academy of Sciences. Grechko has written his memoirs as &quot;Космонавт No. 34: От лучины до пришельцев,&quot; (Cosmonaut No. 34 From Splinter to Aliens) Olma Media Grupp, Moscow, 2013.

A minor planet 3148 Grechko discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1979 is named after him.

Grechko had a brief cameo role in Richard Viktorov&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Per Aspera Ad Astra&quot;, and as a result attained pop culture status in his home city of Leningrad. He also appeared in the 1979 film &quot;Under the Constellation Gemini&quot;.

Grechko, along with Alexei Leonov, Vitaly Sevastyanov, and Rusty Schweickart established the Association of Space Explorers in 1984. Membership is open to all people who have flown in outer space.

Grechko died aged 85 as a result of several chronic illnesses. He was survived by wife Lyudmila and daughter Olga.

== Soyuz–Salyut missions ==
Georgy Grechko&#x27;s first mission to space began during the winter of 1974, when he and fellow Soviet cosmonaut Aleksei Gubarev were crewmen of the Soyuz 17-Salyut 4 mission. The Soyuz 17 rocket launched on 26 December 1974 and successfully docked with the Salyut 4 Space Station on 12 January 1975. This successful docking marked only the second complete success in five Soyuz-Salyut undertakings. The cosmonauts spent the remainder of their mission aboard the three room, 20 ton station. During their time aboard the Salyut 4 Space Station, Grechko and Gubarev conducted a wide range of studies that included infrared temperature scans of earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere, stellar observations and X-ray studies of the sun. In order to maintain fitness in weightlessness, Grechko spent up to two hours a day exercising on a bicycle and treadmill, as well as experimenting with wearing negative pressure suits. Grechko and Gubarev spent a total of 30 days in orbit, which set the Soviet record at the time, before returning safely on 9 February 1975.

In December 1977, Georgy Grechko returned to space with Yuri Romanenko during the Soyuz 26-Salyut 6 mission. The crew boarded the Soviet Salyut 6 Space Station, where they would stay long enough to eclipse the 84-day record set in 1974 by US Skylab astronauts Gerald Carr, William Pogue, and Edward Gibson. In January 1978, Grechko and Romanenko were joined by fellow cosmonauts Vladimir Dzhanibekov and Oleg Makarov, who linked their Soyuz 27 craft with the Salyut 6 Space Station and spent five days aboard the station along with Grechko and Romanenko, before returning to earth in Soyuz 26 craft. This event marked the first double docking and first double crew occupancy of a space station. On March 4, Grechko and Romanenko were joined by a different Soviet crew, consisting of Aleksei Gubarev (Grechko&#x27;s partner from his previous mission) and Czechoslavakian Vladimir Raemk, the first non-Russian cosmonaut.

The crew members of the Salyut 6 Space Station became the first men to carry out a systematic visual-instrumental observation of the earth. Their extended stay is what allowed the crew to pull off such an observation, as it takes two to three weeks for human eyesight to adapt to conditions in orbit. After several weeks in orbit, the members of the Salyut 6 crew were able to examine the finer details of the landscape, which included the traces left on the water surface by typhoons, enormous solitary waves that were over 100 kilometers long, and some of the characteristic features of the ocean floor. On March 15, after spending a record-setting total of 96 days in orbit, Grechko and Romanenko finally left the Salyut 6 Space Station and returned to earth aboard the Soyuz 27 spacecraft. After spending such an extended period of time in orbit, the crew began an expanded exercise routine a week prior to departure that was intended to minimize the effects of the return to normal gravity. Despite this training, both Grechko and Romanenko struggled to complete easy tasks shortly following their return, such as turning a radio dial or lifting a cup of tea. Fortunately, neither cosmonaut reported any serious readjustment issues.
