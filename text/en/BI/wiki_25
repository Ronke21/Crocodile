<text>An autopilot is a system used to control the path of a vehicle without requiring constant manual control by a human operator. Autopilots do not replace human operators. Instead, the autopilot assists the operator&#x27;s control of the vehicle, allowing the operator to focus on broader aspects of operations (for example, monitoring the trajectory, weather and on-board systems).

When present, an autopilot is often used in conjunction with an autothrottle, a system for controlling the power delivered by the engines.
An autopilot system is sometimes colloquially referred to as &quot;George&quot; (e.g. &quot;&quot;we&#x27;ll let George fly for a while&quot;; &quot;George is flying the plane now&quot;.&quot;). The etymology of the nickname is unclear: some claim it is a reference to American inventor George De Beeson (1897 - 1965), who patented an autopilot in the 1930s, while others claim that Royal Air Force pilots coined the term during World War II to symbolize that their aircraft technically belonged to King George VI.

==First autopilots==
In the early days of aviation, aircraft required the continuous attention of a pilot to fly safely. As aircraft range increased, allowing flights of many hours, the constant attention led to serious fatigue. An autopilot is designed to perform some of the pilot&#x27;s tasks.

The first aircraft autopilot was developed by Sperry Corporation in 1912. The autopilot connected a gyroscopic heading indicator, and attitude indicator to hydraulically operated elevators and rudder. (Ailerons were not connected as wing dihedral was counted upon to produce the necessary roll stability.) It permitted the aircraft to fly straight and level on a compass course without a pilot&#x27;s attention, greatly reducing the pilot&#x27;s workload.

Lawrence Sperry, the son of famous inventor Elmer Sperry, demonstrated it in 1914 at an aviation safety contest held in Paris. Sperry demonstrated the credibility of the invention by flying the aircraft with his hands away from the controls and visible to onlookers. Elmer Sperry Jr., the son of Lawrence Sperry, and Capt Shiras continued work on the same autopilot after the war, and in 1930, they tested a more compact and reliable autopilot which kept a U.S. Army Air Corps aircraft on a true heading and altitude for three hours.

In 1930, the Royal Aircraft Establishment in the United Kingdom developed an autopilot called a pilots&#x27; assister that used a pneumatically spun gyroscope to move the flight controls.

The autopilot was further developed, to include, for example, improved control algorithms and hydraulic servomechanisms. Adding more instruments, such as radio-navigation aids, made it possible to fly at night and in bad weather. In 1947, a U.S. Air Force C-53 made a transatlantic flight, including takeoff and landing, completely under the control of an autopilot. 
Bill Lear developed his F-5 automatic pilot, and automatic approach control system, and was awarded the Collier Trophy in 1949.

In the early 1920s, the Standard Oil tanker &quot;J.A. Moffet&quot; became the first ship to use an autopilot.

The Piasecki HUP-2 Retriever was the first production helicopter with an autopilot.

The lunar module digital autopilot of the Apollo program is an early example of a fully digital autopilot system in spacecraft.

==Modern autopilots==

Not all of the passenger aircraft flying today have an autopilot system. Older and smaller general aviation aircraft especially are still hand-flown, and even small airliners with fewer than twenty seats may also be without an autopilot as they are used on short-duration flights with two pilots. The installation of autopilots in aircraft with more than twenty seats is generally made mandatory by international aviation regulations. There are three levels of control in autopilots for smaller aircraft. A single-axis autopilot controls an aircraft in the roll axis only; such autopilots are also known colloquially as &quot;wing levellers&quot;, reflecting their single capability. A two-axis autopilot controls an aircraft in the pitch axis as well as roll, and may be little more than a wing leveller with limited pitch oscillation-correcting ability; or it may receive inputs from on-board radio navigation systems to provide true automatic flight guidance once the aircraft has taken off until shortly before landing; or its capabilities may lie somewhere between these two extremes. A three-axis autopilot adds control in the yaw axis and is not required in many small aircraft.

Autopilots in modern complex aircraft are three-axis and generally divide a flight into taxi, takeoff, climb, cruise (level flight), descent, approach, and landing phases. Autopilots that automate all of these flight phases except taxi and takeoff exist. An autopilot-controlled approach to landing on a runway and controlling the aircraft on rollout (i.e. keeping it on the centre of the runway) is known as an Autoland, where the autopilot utilizes an Instrument Landing System (ILS) Cat IIIc approach, which is used when the visibility is zero. These approaches are available at many major airports&#x27; runways today, especially at airports subject to adverse weather phenomena such as fog. The aircraft can typically stop on their own, but will require the disengagement of the autopilot in order to exit the runway and taxi to the gate. An autopilot is often an integral component of a Flight Management System.

Modern autopilots use computer software to control the aircraft. The software reads the aircraft&#x27;s current position, and then controls a flight control system to guide the aircraft. In such a system, besides classic flight controls, many autopilots incorporate thrust control capabilities that can control throttles to optimize the airspeed.

The autopilot in a modern large aircraft typically reads its position and the aircraft&#x27;s attitude from an inertial guidance system. Inertial guidance systems accumulate errors over time. They will incorporate error reduction systems such as the carousel system that rotates once a minute so that any errors are dissipated in different directions and have an overall nulling effect. Error in gyroscopes is known as drift. This is due to physical properties within the system, be it mechanical or laser guided, that corrupt positional data. The disagreements between the two are resolved with digital signal processing, most often a six-dimensional Kalman filter. The six dimensions are usually roll, pitch, yaw, altitude, latitude, and longitude. Aircraft may fly routes that have a required performance factor, therefore the amount of error or actual performance factor must be monitored in order to fly those particular routes. The longer the flight, the more error accumulates within the system. Radio aids such as DME, DME updates, and GPS may be used to correct the aircraft position.

===Control Wheel Steering===

An option midway between fully automated flight and manual flying is Control Wheel Steering (CWS). Although it is becoming less used as a stand-alone option in modern airliners, CWS is still a function on many aircraft today. Generally, an autopilot that is CWS equipped has three positions: off, CWS, and CMD. In CMD (Command) mode the autopilot has full control of the aircraft, and receives its input from either the heading/altitude setting, radio and navaids, or the FMS (Flight Management System). In CWS mode, the pilot controls the autopilot through inputs on the yoke or the stick. These inputs are translated to a specific heading and attitude, which the autopilot will then hold until instructed to do otherwise. This provides stability in pitch and roll. Some aircraft employ a form of CWS even in manual mode, such as the MD-11 which uses a constant CWS in roll. In many ways, a modern Airbus fly-by-wire aircraft in Normal Law is always in CWS mode. The major difference is that in this system the limitations of the aircraft are guarded by the flight control computer, and the pilot cannot steer the aircraft past these limits.

===Computer system details===
The hardware of an autopilot varies between implementations, but is generally designed with redundancy and reliability as foremost considerations. For example, the Rockwell Collins AFDS-770 Autopilot Flight Director System used on the Boeing 777 uses triplicated FCP-2002 microprocessors which have been formally verified and are fabricated in a radiation-resistant process.

Software and hardware in an autopilot are tightly controlled, and extensive test procedures are put in place.

Some autopilots also use design diversity. In this safety feature, critical software processes will not only run on separate computers, and possibly even using different architectures, but each computer will run software created by different engineering teams, often being programmed in different programming languages. It is generally considered unlikely that different engineering teams will make the same mistakes. As the software becomes more expensive and complex, design diversity is becoming less common because fewer engineering companies can afford it. The flight control computers on the Space Shuttle used this design: there were five computers, four of which redundantly ran identical software, and a fifth backup running software that was developed independently. The software on the fifth system provided only the basic functions needed to fly the Shuttle, further reducing any possible commonality with the software running on the four primary systems.

== Stability augmentation systems ==
A stability augmentation system (SAS) is another type of automatic flight control system; however, instead of maintaining the aircraft required altitude or flight path, the SAS will move the aircraft control surfaces to damp unacceptable motions. SAS automatically stabilizes the aircraft in one or more axes. The most common type of SAS is the yaw damper which is used to reduce the Dutch roll tendency of swept-wing aircraft. Some yaw dampers are part of the autopilot system while others are stand-alone systems.

Yaw dampers use a sensor to detect how fast the aircraft is rotating (either a gyroscope or a pair of accelerometers), a computer/amplifier and an actuator. The sensor detects when the aircraft begins the yawing part of Dutch roll. A computer processes the signal from the sensor to determine the rudder deflection required to damp the motion. The computer tells the actuator to move the rudder in the opposite direction to the motion since the rudder has to oppose the motion to reduce it. The Dutch roll is damped and the aircraft becomes stable about the yaw axis. Because Dutch roll is an instability that is inherent in all swept-wing aircraft, most swept-wing aircraft need some sort of yaw damper.

There are two types of yaw damper: the series yaw damper and the parallel yaw damper. The actuator of a parallel yaw damper will move the rudder independently of the pilot&#x27;s rudder pedals while the actuator of a series yaw damper is clutched to the rudder control quadrant, and will result in pedal movement when the rudder moves.

Some aircraft have stability augmentation systems that will stabilize the aircraft in more than a single axis. The Boeing B-52, for example, requires both pitch and yaw SAS in order to provide a stable bombing platform. Many helicopters have pitch, roll and yaw SAS systems. Pitch and roll SAS systems operate much the same way as the yaw damper described above; however, instead of damping Dutch roll, they will damp pitch and roll oscillations to improve the overall stability of the aircraft.

== Autopilot for ILS landings ==

Instrument-aided landings are defined in categories by the International Civil Aviation Organization, or ICAO. These are dependent upon the required visibility level and the degree to which the landing can be conducted automatically without input by the pilot.

CAT I – This category permits pilots to land with a decision height of and a forward visibility or Runway Visual Range (RVR) of . Autopilots are not required.

CAT II – This category permits pilots to land with a decision height between and and a RVR of . Autopilots have a fail passive requirement.

CAT IIIa -This category permits pilots to land with a decision height as low as and a RVR of . It needs a fail-passive autopilot. There must be only a 10−6 probability of landing outside the prescribed area.

CAT IIIb – As IIIa but with the addition of automatic roll out after touchdown incorporated with the pilot taking control some distance along the runway. This category permits pilots to land with a decision height less than 50 feet or no decision height and a forward visibility of in Europe (76 metres, compare this to aircraft size, some of which are now over long) or in the United States. For a landing-without-decision aid, a fail-operational autopilot is needed. For this category some form of runway guidance system is needed: at least fail-passive but it needs to be fail-operational for landing without decision height or for RVR below .

CAT IIIc – As IIIb but without decision height or visibility minimums, also known as &quot;zero-zero&quot;. Not yet implemented as it would require the pilots to taxi in zero-zero visibility. An aircraft that is capable of landing in a CAT IIIb that is equipped with autobrake would be able to fully stop on the runway but would have no ability to taxi.

Fail-passive autopilot: in case of failure, the aircraft stays in a controllable position and the pilot can take control of it to go around or finish landing. It is usually a dual-channel system.

Fail-operational autopilot: in case of a failure below alert height, the approach, flare and landing can still be completed automatically. It is usually a triple-channel system or dual-dual system. 

==Radio-controlled models==
In radio-controlled modelling, and especially RC aircraft and helicopters, an autopilot is usually a set of extra hardware and software that deals with pre-programming the model&#x27;s flight.

== Flight Director ==


A flight director (FD) is a flight instrument that is overlaid on the attitude indicator that shows the pilot of an aircraft the attitude required to execute the desired flight path. While the flight director is separate from the autopilot, they are closely linked. With a flight plan programmed into the flight computer, the flight director will command rolls when turns are required.

Without a flight director, the autopilot is limited to more basic modes, such as maintaining an altitude or a heading, or turning on to a new heading when commanded by the pilot.

When the autopilot and flight director are used together, more complex autopilot modes are possible. The autopilot can follow flight director commands, thus following the flight plan route without pilot intervention.

<doc id="343234" wikidata="Q172107" url="?curid=343234" title="Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth">
<text>The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, formally known as the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and also referred to as Poland–Lithuania or the First Polish Republic, was a federative real union between the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, existing from 1569 to 1795. This state was among the largest and most populated countries of 16th- to 17th-century Europe. At its peak in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth spanned nearly and supported a multi-ethnic population of approximately 12 million as of 1618. The official languages of the Commonwealth were Polish and Latin, with Catholicism as the state religion.

The Commonwealth was established as a single entity by the Union of Lublin on 1 July 1569. The two nations had previously been in a personal union since the Krewo Agreement of 1385 (Polish–Lithuanian union) and the subsequent marriage of Queen Jadwiga of Poland to Grand Duke Jogaila of Lithuania, who was crowned jure uxoris King of Poland. Their descendant, Sigismund II Augustus, enforced the merger to strengthen frontiers of his dominion and maintain unity as he remained childless. His death in 1572 marked the end of the Jagiellonian dynasty and introduced an elective monarchy, whereupon members of domestic noble families or external dynasties were elected to the throne for life.

The Commonwealth&#x27;s parliamentary system of government and elective monarchy, called the Golden Liberty, was an early example of constitutional monarchy. The General Sejm, the bicameral Parliament, held legislative power; its lower house was elected by &quot;szlachta&quot; nobles comprising some 15% of the population. The king and his government were bound by a constitutional statute, the Henrician Articles, which tightly circumscribed royal authority. The country also exhibited unusual levels of ethnic diversity and great religious tolerance by European standards, guaranteed by the Warsaw Confederation Act of 1573, though the practical degree of religious freedom varied. Poland acted as the dominant partner in the union. Polonization of nobles was generally voluntary, but state efforts at religious conversion were sometimes resisted.

After a long period of prosperity, the Commonwealth entered a period of protracted political, military, and economic decline. Its growing weakness led to its partitioning among its neighbours, Austria, Prussia, and Russia, during the late 18th century. Shortly before its demise, the Commonwealth adopted a major reform effort and enacted the 3 May Constitution, which was the first codified constitution in modern European history and the second in modern world history after the United States Constitution.

==Name==

The official name of the state was the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (, , ). The Latin term was usually employed in international treaties and diplomacy. By concluding the 1569 Union of Lublin the Grand Duchy of Lithuania remained a separate state from the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland with its own name, laws, and territory. The name &#x27;Commonwealth of Two Nations&#x27; () came into force during the reign of Stephen Báthory (since 1582, and was officially used until 1795). On 28 January 1588, Sigismund III Vasa has confirmed the Third Statute of Lithuania in which it was stated that the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth is a federation of two countries – Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland where both countries have equal rights within it.

In the 17th century and later it was also known as the &#x27;Most Serene Commonwealth of Poland&#x27; (, ), the Commonwealth of the Polish Kingdom, or the Commonwealth of Poland.

Western Europeans often simplified the name to &#x27;Poland&#x27; and in most past and modern sources it is referred to as the Kingdom of Poland, or just Poland. The terms &#x27;Commonwealth of Poland&#x27; and &#x27;Commonwealth of Two Nations&#x27; (, ) were used in the Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations (1791). In the preamble of the Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations (1791) the dualistic nature of the state was confirmed and separate monarchial titles of Stanisław August Poniatowski were included: King of Poland () and Grand Duke of Lithuania (), also the land envoys of the Polish Crown and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania () were mentioned. The English term Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and German Polen–Litauen are seen as renderings of the &#x27;Commonwealth of Two Nations&#x27; variant.

Other informal names include the &#x27;Republic of Nobles&#x27; () and the &#x27;First Commonwealth&#x27; () or &#x27;First Polish Republic&#x27; (), the latter relatively common in historiography to distinguish it from the Second Polish Republic. In Lithuania, the state is referred to as &#x27;Republic of Both Nations&#x27; (Lithuanian: &quot;Abiejų Tautų Respublika&quot;).

==History==

===Prelude (1370–1569)===

The Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania underwent an alternating series of wars and alliances across the 13th and 14th centuries. The relations between the two states differed at times as each strived and competed for political, economic or military dominance of the region. In turn, Poland had remained a staunch ally of its southern neighbour, Hungary. The last Polish monarch from the native Piast dynasty, Casimir the Great, died on 5 November 1370 without fathering a legitimate male heir. Consequently, the crown passed onto his Hungarian nephew, Louis of Anjou, who ruled the Kingdom of Hungary in a personal union with Poland. A fundamental step in developing extensive ties with Lithuania was a succession crisis arising in the 1380s. Louis died on 10 September 1382 and, like his uncle, did not produce a son to succeed him. His two daughters, Mary and Jadwiga (Hedwig), held claims to the vast dual realm.

The Polish lords rejected Mary in favour of her younger sister Jadwiga, partly due to Mary&#x27;s association with Sigismund of Luxembourg. The future queen regnant was betrothed to young William Habsburg, Duke of Austria, but certain factions of the nobility remained apprehensive believing that William would not secure domestic interests. Instead, they turned to Jogaila, the Grand Duke of Lithuania. Jogaila was a lifelong pagan and vowed to adopt Catholicism upon marriage by signing the Union of Krewo on 14 August 1385. The Act imposed Christianity in Lithuania and transformed Poland into a diarchy, a kingdom ruled over by two sovereigns; their descendants and successive monarchs held the titles of king and grand duke respectively. The ultimate clause dictated that Lithuania was to be merged in perpetuity (&quot;perpetuo applicare&quot;) with the Polish Kingdom; however, this did not take effect until 1569. Jogaila was crowned as Władysław II Jagiełło at Wawel Cathedral on 4 March 1386.

===Union of Lublin (1569)===
Several minor agreements were struck before unification, notably the Union of Kraków and Vilnius, the Union of Vilnius and Radom and the Union of Grodno. Lithuania&#x27;s vulnerable position and rising tensions on its eastern flank persuaded the nobles to seek a closer bond with Poland. The idea of a federation presented better economic opportunities, whilst securing Lithuania&#x27;s borders from hostile states to the north, south and east. Lesser Lithuanian nobility were eager to share the personal privileges and political liberties enjoyed by the Polish szlachta, but did not accept Polish demands for the incorporation of the Grand Duchy into Poland as a mere province, with no sense of autonomy. Mikołaj &quot;the Red&quot; Radziwiłł (Radvila Rudasis) and his cousin Mikołaj &quot;the Black&quot; Radziwiłł, two prominent nobles and military commanders in Lithuania, vocally opposed the union.

A fierce proponent of a single unified Commonwealth was Sigismund II Augustus, who was childless and ailing. According to historians, it was his active involvement which hastened the process and made the union possible. A parliament (sejm) convened on 10 January 1569 in the city of Lublin, attended by envoys from both nations. It was agreed that the merger will take place the same year and both parliaments will be fused into a joint assembly. No independent parliamentary convocation or diet was henceforth permitted. Subjects of the Polish Crown were no longer restricted in purchasing land on Lithuanian territory and a single currency was established. Whilst the military remained separate, a unified foreign policy meant that Lithuanian troops were obliged to contribute during a conflict not to their advantage. As a result, several Lithuanian magnates deplored the accords and left the assembly in protest. Sigismund II used his authority as grand duke and enforced the Act of Union &quot;in contumaciam&quot;. In fear, the absent nobles promptly returned to the negotiations. The Union of Lublin was passed by the gathered deputies and signed by attendees on 1 July, thus creating the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Sigismund&#x27;s death in 1572 was followed by an interregnum during which adjustments were made to the constitutional system; these adjustments significantly increased the power of the Polish nobility and established a truly elective monarchy.

===Apex and the Golden Age (1573–1648)===
On 11 May 1573, Henry de Valois, son of Henry II of France and Catherine de&#x27; Medici, was proclaimed King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania in the first royal election outside Warsaw. Approximately 40,000 nobles cast a vote in what was to become a centuries-long tradition of a nobles&#x27; democracy (Golden Liberty). Henry already posed as a candidate before Sigismund&#x27;s death and received widespread support from the pro-French factions. The choice was a political move aimed at curtailing Habsburg hegemony, ending skirmishes with the French-allied Ottomans, and profiting from the lucrative trade with France. It was also believed that an Austrian Archduke could be too powerful and attempt to limit noble privileges. French envoys had also offered large amounts of bribes, amounting to several hundred thousand ecus. Upon ascending the throne, Henry signed the contractual agreement known as the &quot;Pacta conventa&quot; and approbated the Henrician Articles. The Act stated the fundamental principles of governance and constitutional law in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In June 1574, Henry abandoned Poland and headed back to claim the French crown following the death of his brother and predecessor, Charles IX. The throne was subsequently declared vacant.

The interregnum concluded on 12 December 1575 when primate Jakub Uchański declared Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, as the next king. The decision was condemned by the anti-Habsburg coalition, which demanded a &quot;native&quot; candidate, known as &quot;Piasts&quot;. As a compromise, on 13 December 1575 Anna Jagiellon – sister of Sigismund Augustus and a member of the Jagiellonian dynasty – became the new monarch. The nobles simultaneously elected Stephen Báthory as co-regent, who ruled &quot;jure uxoris&quot;. Báthory&#x27;s election proved controversial – Lithuania and Ducal Prussia initially refused to recognise the Transylvanian as their ruler. Piotr Zborowski supported Bathory as he wanted to promote a princely or ducal candidate. He also endorsed the Duke of Ferrara. The wealthy port city of Gdańsk (Danzig) staged a revolt, and, with the help of Denmark, blockaded maritime trade to neutral Elbląg (Elbing). Báthory, unable to penetrate the city&#x27;s extensive fortifications, succumbed to the demands for greater privileges and freedoms. However, his successful Livonian campaign ended in the annexation of Livonia and the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (modern-day Estonia and Latvia, respectively), thus expanding the Commonwealth&#x27;s influence into the Baltics. Most importantly, Poland gained the Hanseatic city of Riga on the Baltic Sea.
In 1587, Sigismund Vasa – the son of John III of Sweden and Catherine Jagiellon – won the election, but his claim was overtly contested by Maximilian III of Austria, who launched a military expedition to challenge the new king. His defeat in 1588 at the hands of Jan Zamoyski sealed Sigismund&#x27;s right to the throne of Poland and Sweden. Sigismund&#x27;s long reign marked an end to the Polish Golden Age and the beginning of the Silver Age. A devout Catholic, he hoped to restore absolutism and imposed Roman Catholicism during the height of the Counter-Reformation. His intolerance towards the Protestants in Sweden sparked a war of independence, which ended the Polish–Swedish union. As a consequence, he was deposed in Sweden by his uncle Charles IX Vasa. In Poland, the Zebrzydowski rebellion was brutally suppressed.

Sigismund III then initiated a policy of expansionism, and invaded Russia in 1609 when that country was plagued by a civil war known as the Time of Troubles. In July 1610, the outnumbered Polish force comprising winged hussars defeated the Russians at the Battle of Klushino, which enabled the Poles to take and occupy Moscow for the next two years. The disgraced Vasili IV of Russia was transported in a cage to Warsaw where he paid a tribute to Sigismund; Vasili was later murdered in captivity. The Commonwealth forces were eventually driven out on 4 November 1612 (celebrated as Unity Day in Russia). The war concluded with a truce that granted Poland–Lithuania extensive territories in the east and marked its largest territorial expansion. At least five million Russians died between 1598 and 1613, the result of continuous conflict, famine and Sigismund&#x27;s invasion.
The Polish–Ottoman War (1620–21) forced Poland to withdraw from Moldavia in southeastern Europe, but Sigismund&#x27;s victory over the Turks at Khotyn diminished the supremacy of the Sultanate and eventually led to the murder of Osman II. This secured the Turkish frontier for the duration of Sigismund&#x27;s rule. In spite of the victories in the Polish–Swedish War (1626–1629), the exhausted Commonwealth army signed the Treaty of Altmark which ceded much of Livonia to Sweden under Gustavus Adolphus. At the same time, the country&#x27;s powerful parliament was dominated by nobles (&quot;Pic. 2&quot;) who were reluctant to get involved in the Thirty Years&#x27; War; this neutrality spared the country from the ravages of a political-religious conflict that devastated most of contemporary Europe.

During this period, Poland was experiencing a cultural awakening and extensive developments in arts and architecture; the first Vasa king openly sponsored foreign painters, craftsmen, musicians and engineers, who settled in the Commonwealth at his request.

Sigismund&#x27;s eldest son, Ladislaus succeeded him as Władysław IV in 1632 with no major opposition. A skilled tactician, he invested in artillery, modernised the army and fiercely defended the Commonwealth&#x27;s eastern borders. Under the Treaty of Stuhmsdorf, he reclaimed regions of Livonia and the Baltics which were lost during the Polish-Swedish wars. Unlike his father who worshipped the Habsburgs, Władysław sought closer ties with France and married Marie Louise Gonzaga, daughter of Charles I Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, in 1646.

===Deluge, rebellions and Vienna (1648–1696)===
The Commonwealth&#x27;s power and stability began waning after a series of blows during the following decades. Władysław&#x27;s brother, John II Casimir, proved to be weak and impotent. The multicultural and mega-diverse federation already suffered domestic problems. As persecution of religious and ethnic minorities strengthened, several groups started to rebel.

A major rebellion of self-governed Ukrainian Cossacks inhabiting south-eastern borderlands of the Commonwealth rioted against Polish and Catholic oppression of Orthodox Ukraine in 1648, in what came to be known as the Khmelnytsky Uprising. It resulted in a Ukrainian request, under the terms of the Treaty of Pereyaslav, for protection by the Russian Tsar. In 1651, in the face of a growing threat from Poland, and forsaken by his Tatar allies, Khmelnytsky asked the Tsar to incorporate Ukraine as an autonomous duchy under Russian protection. Russian annexation of Zaporizhian Ukraine gradually supplanted Polish influence in that part of Europe. In the years following, Polish settlers, nobles, Catholics and Jews became the victims of retaliation massacres instigated by the Cossacks in their dominions.

The other blow to the Commonwealth was a Swedish invasion in 1655, known as the Deluge, which was supported by troops of Transylvanian Duke George II Rákóczi and Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. Under the Treaty of Bromberg in 1657, Catholic Poland was forced to renounce its suzerainty over Protestant Prussia; in 1701 the once-insignificant duchy was transformed into the Kingdom of Prussia, which became a major European power in the 18th century and proved to be Poland&#x27;s most enduring foe.

In the late 17th century, the king of the weakened Commonwealth, John III Sobieski, allied with Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I to deal crushing defeats to the Ottoman Empire. In 1683, the Battle of Vienna marked the final turning point in the 250-year struggle between the forces of Christian Europe and the Islamic Ottomans. For its centuries-long opposition to Muslim advances, the Commonwealth would gain the name of &quot;Antemurale Christianitatis&quot; (bulwark of Christianity). During the next 16 years, the Great Turkish War would drive the Turks permanently south of the Danube River, never again to threaten central Europe.

===Political turmoil and the enlightenment (1697–1771)===
John Sobieski&#x27;s death in 1696 arguably ended the period of national sovereignty, and Poland&#x27;s relative authority over the region dwindled swiftly. By the 18th century, destabilization of its political system brought the Commonwealth to the brink of civil war and the state became increasingly susceptible to foreign influence. The remaining European powers perpetually meddled in the country&#x27;s affairs. Upon the death of a king, several royal houses actively intruded in the hope of securing votes for their desired candidates. The practice was common and apparent, and the selection was often the result of hefty bribes directed at corrupt nobles. Louis XIV of France heavily invested in François Louis, Prince of Conti, in opposition to James Louis Sobieski, Maximilian Emanuel of Bavaria and Frederick Augustus of Saxony. The latter&#x27;s conversion from Lutheranism to Catholicism awed the conservative magnates and Pope Innocent XII, who in turn voiced their endorsement. Imperial Russia and Habsburg Austria also contributed by financing Frederick, whose election took place in June 1697. Many questioned the legality of his elevation to the throne; it was speculated that the Prince of Conti had received more votes and was the rightful heir. Frederick hurried with his armies to Poland to quell any opposition. He was crowned as Augustus II in September and Conti&#x27;s brief military engagement near Gdańsk in November of the same year proved fruitless.

The House of Wettin ruled Poland–Lithuania and Saxony simultaneously, dividing power between the two states. In spite of his controversial means of attaining power, Augustus II lavishly spent on the arts and left an extensive cultural and architectural (Baroque) legacy in both countries. In Poland, he expanded Wilanów and facilitated the refurbishment of the Warsaw Royal Castle into a modern palatial residence. Countless landmarks and monuments in the city bear a name referencing the Saxon kings, notably Saxon Garden, Saxon Axis and the former Saxon Palace. The period saw the development of urban planning, street allocation, hospitals, schools (Collegium Nobilium), public parks and libraries (Załuski Library). First manufactories producing on a mass scale were opened to satisfy the demands of the nobility as consumers.
At the height of the Great Northern War a coalition (Warsaw Confederation) against Augustus II was formed by Stanisław Leszczyński and other magnates sponsored by Sweden. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was formally neutral at this point, as Augustus entered the war as Elector of Saxony. Disregarding Polish negotiation proposals supported by the Swedish parliament, Charles crossed into the Commonwealth and vanquished the Saxe-Polish forces at the Battle of Kliszów in 1702 and at the Battle of Pułtusk in 1703. Charles then succeeded in dethroning Augustus and coercing the Sejm (parliament) to replace him with Stanisław in 1704. Augustus regained the throne in 1709, but his own death in 1733 sparked the War of the Polish Succession in which Stanisław once more attempted to seize the crown, this time with the support of France. The Pacification Sejm culminated in Augustus III succeeding his father Frederick Augustus of Saxony.

The relative peace and inactivity that followed only weakened Poland&#x27;s reputation on the world stage. Aleksander Brückner noted that Polish customs and traditions were abandoned in favour of everything foreign, and neighbouring states continued to exploit Poland to their advantage. Moreover, Western Europe&#x27;s increasing exploitation of resources in the Americas rendered the Commonwealth&#x27;s supplies less crucial which resulted in financial losses. Augustus III spent little time in the Commonwealth, instead preferring the Saxon city of Dresden. He appointed Heinrich von Brühl as viceroy and minister of Polish affairs who in turn left the politics to Polish magnate families, such as the Czartoryskis and the Radziwiłłs. It was also during this period that the Polish Enlightenment began to sprout.

===Partitions (1772–1795)===
In 1764, aristocrat Stanisław August Poniatowski was elected monarch with the connivance and support of his former lover Catherine the Great, a German noblewoman who became Empress of Russia.

Poniatowski&#x27;s attempts at reform were met with staunch resistance both internally and externally. Any goal of stabilizing the Commonwealth was dangerous for its ambitious and aggressive neighbours. Like his predecessors, he sponsored artists and architects. In 1765 he founded the Warsaw Corps of Cadets, the first state school in Poland for all classes of society. In 1773 the king and parliament formed the Commission of National Education, the first Ministry of Education in European history. In 1792, the king ordered the creation of Virtuti Militari, the oldest military decoration still in use. Stanisław August also admired the culture of ancient kingdoms, particularly Rome and Greece; Neoclassicism became the dominant form of architectural and cultural expression.

Politically, however, the vast Commonwealth was in steady decline and by 1768, it started to be considered by Russians as a protectorate of the Russian Empire despite the fact that it was still an independent state. A majority of control over Poland was central to Catherine&#x27;s diplomatic and military strategies. Attempts at reform, such as the Four-Year Sejm&#x27;s May Constitution, came too late. The country was partitioned in three stages by the Russian Empire, the German Kingdom of Prussia, and the Austrian Habsburg monarchy. By 1795, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had been completely erased from the map of Europe. Poland and Lithuania were not re-established as independent countries until 1918.

==State organization and politics==
===Golden Liberty===

The political doctrine of the Commonwealth was &quot;our state is a republic under the presidency of the King&quot;. Chancellor Jan Zamoyski summed up this doctrine when he said that &quot;Rex regnat et non-gubernat&quot; (&quot;The King reigns but [&quot;lit.&quot; &#x27;and&#x27;] does not govern&quot;). The Commonwealth had a parliament, the Sejm, as well as a &quot;Senat&quot; and an elected king (&quot;Pic. 1&quot;). The king was obliged to respect citizens&#x27; rights specified in King Henry&#x27;s Articles as well as in &quot;pacta conventa&quot;, negotiated at the time of his election.

The monarch&#x27;s power was limited in favour of a sizable noble class. Each new king had to pledge to uphold the Henrician Articles, which were the basis of Poland&#x27;s political system (and included near-unprecedented guarantees of religious tolerance). Over time, the Henrician Articles were merged with the pacta conventa, specific pledges agreed to by the king-elect. From that point onwards, the king was effectively a partner with the noble class and was constantly supervised by a group of senators. The Sejm could veto the king on important matters, including legislation (the adoption of new laws), foreign affairs, declaration of war, and taxation (changes of existing taxes or the levying of new ones).

The foundation of the Commonwealth&#x27;s political system, the &quot;Golden Liberty&quot; ( or , a term used from 1573 on), included:
*election of the king by all nobles wishing to participate, known as &quot;wolna elekcja&quot; (free election);
*Sejm, the Commonwealth parliament which the king was required to hold every two years;
*&quot;pacta conventa&quot; (Latin), &quot;agreed-to agreements&quot; negotiated with the king-elect, including a bill of rights, binding on the king, derived from the earlier Henrician Articles.
*&quot;religious freedom&quot; guaranteed by Warsaw Confederation Act 1573,
*&quot;rokosz&quot; (insurrection), the right of szlachta to form a legal rebellion against a king who violated their guaranteed freedoms;
*&quot;liberum veto&quot; (Latin), the right of an individual Sejm deputy to oppose a decision by the majority in a Sejm session; the voicing of such a &quot;free veto&quot; nullified all the legislation that had been passed at that session; during the crisis of the second half of the 17th century, Polish nobles could also use the liberum veto in provincial sejmiks;
*&quot;konfederacja&quot; (from the Latin &quot;confederatio&quot;), the right to form an organization to force through a common political aim.

The three regions (see below) of the Commonwealth enjoyed a degree of autonomy. Each voivodship had its own parliament (sejmik), which exercised serious political power, including choice of poseł (deputy) to the national Sejm and charging of the deputy with specific voting instructions. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania had its own separate army, treasury and most other official institutions.

Golden Liberty created a state that was unusual for its time, although somewhat similar political systems existed in the contemporary city-states like the Republic of Venice. Both states were styled &quot;Serenissima Respublica&quot; or the &quot;Most Serene Republic&quot;. At a time when most European countries were headed toward centralization, absolute monarchy and religious and dynastic warfare, the Commonwealth experimented with decentralization, confederation and federation, democracy and religious tolerance.

This political system unusual for its time stemmed from the ascendance of the szlachta noble class over other social classes and over the political system of monarchy. In time, the szlachta accumulated enough privileges (such as those established by the Nihil novi Act of 1505) that no monarch could hope to break the szlachta&#x27;s grip on power. The Commonwealth&#x27;s political system is difficult to fit into a simple category, but it can be tentatively described as a mixture of:
*confederation and federation, with regard to the broad autonomy of its regions. It is, however, difficult to decisively call the Commonwealth either confederation or federation, as it had some qualities of both;
*oligarchy, as only the szlachta (nobility)around 15% of the populationhad political rights;
*democracy, since all the szlachta were equal in rights and privileges, and the Sejm could veto the king on important matters, including legislation (the adoption of new laws), foreign affairs, declaration of war, and taxation (changes of existing taxes or the levying of new ones). Also, the 15% of Commonwealth population who enjoyed those political rights (the szlachta) was a substantially larger percentage than in majority European countries even in the nineteenth century; note that in 1820 in France only about 1.5% of the male adult population had the right to vote, and in 1840 in Belgium, only about 5%.
*elective monarchy, since the monarch, elected by the szlachta, was Head of State;
*constitutional monarchy, since the monarch was bound by pacta conventa and other laws, and the szlachta could disobey any king&#x27;s decrees they deemed illegal.

===Magnate oligarchy===
The end of the Jagiellonian dynasty in 1572after nearly two centuriesdisrupted the fragile equilibrium of the Commonwealth&#x27;s government. Power increasingly slipped away from the central government to the nobility.

When presented with periodic opportunities to fill the throne, the &quot;szlachta&quot; exhibited a preference for foreign candidates who would not establish a strong and long-lasting dynasty. This policy often produced monarchs who were either totally ineffective or in constant debilitating conflict with the nobility. Furthermore, aside from notable exceptions such as the able Stefan Batory from Transylvania (1576–86), the kings of foreign origin were inclined to subordinate the interests of the Commonwealth to those of their own country and ruling house. This was especially visible in the policies and actions of the first two elected kings from the Swedish House of Vasa, whose politics brought the Commonwealth into conflict with Sweden, culminating in the war known as the Deluge (1655), one of the events that mark the end of the Commonwealth&#x27;s Golden Age and the beginning of the Commonwealth&#x27;s decline.

The Zebrzydowski Rebellion (1606–1607) marked a substantial increase in the power of the Polish magnates, and the transformation of &quot;szlachta democracy&quot; into &quot;magnate oligarchy&quot;. The Commonwealth&#x27;s political system was vulnerable to outside interference, as Sejm deputies bribed by foreign powers might use their liberum veto to block attempted reforms. This sapped the Commonwealth and plunged it into political paralysis and anarchy for over a century, from the mid-17th century to the end of the 18th, while its neighbours stabilised their internal affairs and increased their military might.

===Late reforms===
The Commonwealth did eventually make a serious effort to reform its political system, adopting in 1791 the Constitution of 3 May 1791, which historian Norman Davies calls the first of its kind in Europe. The revolutionary Constitution recast the erstwhile Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as a Polish–Lithuanian federal state with a hereditary monarchy and abolished many of the deleterious features of the old system.

The new constitution:
*abolished the liberum veto and banned the szlachta&#x27;s confederations;
*provided for a separation of powers among legislative, executive and judicial branches of government;
*established &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; and extended political rights to include not only the nobility but the bourgeoisie;
*increased the rights of the peasantry;
*preserved religious tolerance (but with a condemnation of apostasy from the Catholic faith).

These reforms came too late, however, as the Commonwealth was immediately invaded from all sides by its neighbors, which had been content to leave the Commonwealth alone as a weak buffer state, but reacted strongly to attempts by king Stanisław August Poniatowski and other reformers to strengthen the country. Russia feared the revolutionary implications of the 3 May Constitution&#x27;s political reforms and the prospect of the Commonwealth regaining its position as a European power. Catherine the Great regarded the May constitution as fatal to her influence and declared the Polish constitution Jacobinical. Grigori Aleksandrovich Potemkin drafted the act for the Targowica Confederation, referring to the constitution as the &quot;contagion of democratic ideas&quot;. Meanwhile, Prussia and Austria used it as a pretext for further territorial expansion. Prussian minister Ewald Friedrich von Hertzberg called the constitution &quot;a blow to the Prussian monarchy&quot;, fearing that a strengthened Poland would once again dominate Prussia. In the end, the 3 May Constitution was never fully implemented, and the Commonwealth entirely ceased to exist only four years after its adoption.

==Economy==


The economy of the Commonwealth was predominantly based on agricultural output and trade, though there was an abundance of artisan workshops and manufactories – notably paper mills, leather tanneries, ironworks, glassworks and brickyards. Some major cities were home to craftsmen, jewellers and clockmakers. The majority of industries and trades were concentrated in the Kingdom of Poland; the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was more rural and its economy was driven by farming and clothmaking. Mining developed in the south-west region of Poland which was rich in natural resources such as lead, coal, copper and salt. The currency used in Poland–Lithuania was the &quot;złoty&quot; (meaning &quot;the golden&quot;) and its subunit, the &quot;grosz&quot;. Foreign coins in the form of ducats, thalers and shillings were widely accepted and exchanged. The city of Gdańsk had the privilege of minting its own coinage. In 1794, Tadeusz Kościuszko began issuing the first Polish banknotes.

The country played a significant role in the supply of Western Europe by the export of grain (rye), cattle (oxen), furs, timber, linen, cannabis, ash, tar, carminic acid and amber. Cereals, cattle and fur amounted to nearly 90% of the country&#x27;s exports to European markets by overland and maritime trade in the 16th century. From Gdańsk, ships carried cargo to the major ports of the Low Countries, such as Antwerp and Amsterdam. The land routes, mostly to the German provinces of the Holy Roman Empire such as the cities of Leipzig and Nuremberg, were used for the export of live cattle (herds of around 50,000 head) hides, salt, tobacco, hemp and cotton from the Greater Poland region. In turn, the Commonwealth imported wine, beer, fruit, exotic spices, luxury goods (e.g. tapestries, &quot;Pic. 5&quot;), furniture, fabrics as well as industrial products like steel and tools.

The agricultural sector was dominated by feudalism based on the plantation system (serfs). Slavery was forbidden in Poland in the 15th century, and formally abolished in Lithuania in 1588, replaced by the second enserfment. Typically a nobleman&#x27;s landholding comprised a &quot;folwark&quot;, a large farmstead worked by serfs to produce surpluses for internal and external trade. This economic arrangement worked well for the ruling classes and nobles in the early years of the Commonwealth, which was one of the most prosperous eras of the grain trade. The economic strength of Commonwealth grain trade waned from the late 17th century on. Trade relationships were disrupted by the wars, and the Commonwealth proved unable to improve its transport infrastructure or its agricultural practices. Serfs in the region were increasingly tempted to flee. The Commonwealth&#x27;s major attempts at countering this problem and improving productivity consisted of increasing serfs&#x27; workload and further restricting their freedoms in a process known as export-led serfdom.

The owner of a folwark usually signed a contract with merchants of Gdańsk, who controlled 80% of this inland trade, to ship the grain north to that seaport on the Baltic Sea. Countless rivers and waterways in the Commonwealth were used for shipping purposes, including the Vistula, Pilica, Bug, San, Nida, Wieprz, and Neman. The rivers had relatively developed infrastructure, with river ports and granaries. Most of the river shipping moved north, southward transport being less profitable, and barges and rafts were often sold off in Gdańsk for lumber. Grodno become an important site after formation of a customs post at Augustów in 1569, which became a checkpoint for merchants travelling to the Crown lands from the Grand Duchy.
Urban population of the Commonwealth was low compared to Western Europe. Exact numbers depend on calculation methods. According to one source, the urban population of the Commonwealth was about 20% of the total in the 17th century, compared to approximately 50% in the Netherlands and Italy (&quot;Pic. 7&quot;). Another source suggests much lower figures: 4–8% urban population in Poland, 34–39% in the Netherlands and 22–23% in Italy. The Commonwealth&#x27;s preoccupation with agriculture, coupled with the nobles&#x27; privileged position when compared to the bourgeoisie, resulted in a fairly slow process of urbanization and thus a rather slow development of industries. The nobility could also regulate the price of grain for their advantage, thus acquiring much wealth. Some of the largest trade fairs in the Commonwealth were held at Lublin.

Several ancient trading routes such as the Amber Road (&quot;Pic. 4&quot;) extended across Poland–Lithuania, which was situated in the heart of Europe and attracted foreign merchants or settlers. Countless goods and cultural artefacts continued to pass from one region to another via the Commonwealth, particularly that the country was a link between the Middle East, the Ottoman Empire and Western Europe. For instance, Isfahan rugs imported from Persia to the Commonwealth were incorrectly known as &quot;Polish rugs&quot; () in Western Europe.

==Military==

The military in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth evolved from the merger of the armies from the Polish Kingdom and from the Grand Lithuanian Duchy, though each state maintained its own division. The united armed forces comprised the Crown Army (&quot;armia koronna&quot;), recruited in Poland, and the Lithuanian Army (&quot;armia litewska&quot;) in the Grand Duchy. The military was headed by the Hetman, a rank equivalent to that of a general or supreme commander in other countries. Monarchs could not declare war or summon an army without the consent of the Sejm parliament or the Senate. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy never played a major role in the military structure from the mid-17th century onwards.

The most prestigious formation of the two respective armes were their 16th- and 17th-century heavy cavalry in the form of Winged Hussars (&quot;husaria&quot;), whereas the Polish Royal Guards and were the elite of the infantry; the regiments were supervised by the king and his family. In 1788, the Great Sejm approved landslide reforms and defined future structures of the military; the Crown Army was to be split into four divisions, with seventeen field infantry regiments and eight cavalry brigades excluding special units; the Lithuanian Army was to be subdivided into two divisions, eight field regiments and two cavalry brigades excluding special units. If implemented, the reform predicted an army of almost 100,000 men.

The armies of those states differed from the organization common in other parts of Europe; according to Bardach, the mercenary formations (&quot;wojsko najemne&quot;), common in Western Europe, never gained widespread popularity in Poland. Brzezinski, however, notes that foreign mercenaries did form a significant portion of the more elite infantry units, at least until the early 17th century. In 16th-century Poland, several other formations formed the core of the military. There was a small standing army, &quot;obrona potoczna&quot; (&quot;continuous defense&quot;) about 1,500–3,000 strong, paid for by the king, and primarily stationed at the troubled southern and eastern borders. It was supplemented by two formations mobilised in case of war – the pospolite ruszenie (Polish for levée en masse – feudal levy of mostly noble knights-landholders), and the &quot;wojsko zaciężne&quot;, recruited by the Polish commanders for the conflict. It differed from other European mercenary formations in that it was commanded by Polish officers, and dissolved after the conflict has ended.

Several years before the Union of Lublin, the Polish &quot;obrona potoczna&quot; was reformed, as the Sejm (national parliament of Poland) legislated in 1562–1563 the creation of &quot;wojsko kwarciane&quot;, named after &quot;kwarta&quot; tax levied on the royal lands for the purpose of maintaining this formation. This formation was also paid for by the king, and in the peacetime, numbered about 3,500–4,000 men according to Bardach; Brzezinski gives the range of 3,000–5,000. It was composed mostly of the light cavalry units manned by nobility (szlachta) and commanded by hetmans. Often, in wartime, the Sejm would legislate a temporary increase in the size of the &quot;wojsko kwarciane&quot;.

Following the end of the Commonwealth, the Polish–Lithuanian military tradition would be continued by the Napoleonic Polish Legions and the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw.

==Culture==

===Science and literature===

The Commonwealth was an important European center for the development of modern social and political ideas. It was famous for its rare quasi-democratic political system, praised by philosophers, and during the Counter-Reformation was known for near-unparalleled religious tolerance, with peacefully coexisting Roman Catholic, Jewish, Orthodox Christian, Protestant and Muslim (Sufi) communities. In the 18th century, the French Catholic Rulhiere wrote of 16th century Poland: &quot;This country, which in our day we have seen divided on the pretext of religion, is the first state in Europe that exemplified tolerance. In this state, mosques arose between churches and synagogues.&quot; The Commonwealth gave rise to the famous Christian sect of the Polish Brethren, antecedents of British and American Unitarianism.

With its political system, the Commonwealth gave birth to political philosophers such as Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski (1503–1572) (&quot;Pic. 9&quot;), Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki (1530–1607) and Piotr Skarga (1536–1612). Later, works by Stanisław Staszic (1755–1826) and Hugo Kołłątaj (1750–1812) helped pave the way for the Constitution of 3 May 1791, which Norman Davies calls the first of its kind in Europe.

Kraków&#x27;s Jagiellonian University is one of the oldest universities in the world (established in 1364), together with the Jesuit Academy of Wilno (established in 1579) they were the major scholarly and scientific centers in the Commonwealth. The Komisja Edukacji Narodowej, Polish for &quot;Commission for National Education&quot;, formed in 1773, was the world&#x27;s first national Ministry of Education. Commonwealth scientists included: Martin Kromer (1512–1589), historian and cartographer; Michael Sendivogius (1566–1636), alchemist and chemist; Jan Brożek (&quot;Ioannes Broscius&quot; in Latin) (1585–1652), polymath: a mathematician, physician and astronomer; Krzysztof Arciszewski (&quot;Crestofle d&#x27;Artischau Arciszewski&quot; in Portuguese) (1592–1656), engineer, ethnographer, general and admiral of the Dutch West Indies Company army in the war with the Spanish Empire for control of Brazil; Kazimierz Siemienowicz (1600–1651), military engineer, artillery specialist and a founder of rocketry; Johannes Hevelius (1611–1687), astronomer, founder of lunar topography; Michał Boym (1612–1659), orientalist, cartographer, naturalist and diplomat in Ming Dynasty&#x27;s service (&quot;Pic. 11&quot;); Adam Adamandy Kochański (1631–1700), mathematician and engineer; Baal Shem Tov (הבעל שם טוב in Hebrew) (1698–1760), considered to be the founder of Hasidic Judaism; Marcin Odlanicki Poczobutt (1728–1810), astronomer and mathematician (&quot;Pic. 12&quot;); Jan Krzysztof Kluk (1739–1796), naturalist, agronomist and entomologist, John Jonston (1603–1675) scholar and physician, descended from Scottish nobility. In 1628 the Czech teacher, scientist, educator, and writer John Amos Comenius took refuge in the Commonwealth, when the Protestants were persecuted under the Counter Reformation.

The works of many Commonwealth authors are considered classics, including those of Jan Kochanowski (&quot;Pic. 10&quot;), Wacław Potocki, Ignacy Krasicki, and Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz. Many &quot;szlachta&quot; members wrote memoirs and diaries. Perhaps the most famous are the &quot;Memoirs of Polish History&quot; by Albrycht Stanisław Radziwiłł (1595–1656) and the &quot;Memoirs&quot; of Jan Chryzostom Pasek (&quot;ca.&quot; 1636–&quot;ca.&quot; 1701). Jakub Sobieski (1590–1646) (father of John III Sobieski) wrote notable diaries. During the Khotyn expedition in 1621 he wrote a diary called &quot;Commentariorum chotinensis belli libri tres&quot; (Diary of the Chocim War), which was published in 1646 in Gdańsk. It was used by Wacław Potocki as a basis for his epic poem, &quot;Transakcja wojny chocimskiej&quot; (&quot;The Progress of the War of Chocim&quot;). He also authored instructions for the journey of his sons to Kraków (1640) and France (1645), a good example of liberal education of the era.

===Art and music===
The art and music of the Commonwealth was largely shaped by prevailing European trends, though the country&#x27;s minorities, foreigners as well as native folk cultures also contributed to its versatile nature. A common art form of the Sarmatian period were coffin portraits (&quot;portrety trumienne&quot;) used in funerals and other important ceremonies. As a rule, such portraits were nailed to sheet metal, six- or eight- sided in shape, fixed to the front of a coffin placed on a high, ornate catafalque. These were a unique and distinguishable feature of the Commonwealth&#x27;s high culture, not found elsewhere in Europe. A similar tradition was only practiced in Roman Egypt. Polish monarchs and nobles frequently invited and sponsored foreign painters and artisans, notably from the Low Countries (the Netherlands, Flanders and Belgium), Germany or Italy. The interiors of upper-class residences, palaces and manors were adorned by wall tapestries (&quot;arrasy&quot; or &quot;tapiseria&quot;) imported from Western Europe; the most renowned collection are the Jagiellonian tapestries exhibited at Wawel Royal Castle in Kraków.

The economic, cultural and political ties between France and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth gave rise to the term &quot;à la polonaise&quot;, French for &quot;Polish-styled&quot;. With the marriage of Marie Leszczyńska to Louis XV of France in 1725, Polish culture began to flourish at the Palace of Versailles. Polish beds (&quot;lit à la polonaise&quot;) draped with baldachins became a centrepiece of Louis XV furniture in French chateaus. Folk flower motifs as well as Polish fashion were popularised in the form of a back-draped polonaise dress (&quot;robe à la polonaise&quot;) worn by aristocrats at Versailles.

The religious cultures of Poland–Lithuania coexisted and penetrated each other for the entirety of the Commonwealth&#x27;s history – the Jews adopted elements of the national dress, loanwords and calques became commonplace and Roman Catholic churches in regions with significant Protestant populations were much simpler in décor than those in other parts of Poland–Lithuania. Mutual influence was further reflected in the great popularity of Byzantine icons (&quot;Pic. 13&quot;) and the icons resembling effigies of Mary in the predominantly Latin territories of today&#x27;s Poland (Black Madonna) and Lithuania (Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn). Conversely, Latin infiltration into Ruthenian Orthodox and Protestant art was also conventional (&quot;Pic. 3&quot;).

Music was a common feature of religious and secular events. To that end many noblemen founded church and school choirs, and employed their own ensembles of musicians. Some, like Stanisław Lubomirski built their own opera houses (in Nowy Wiśnicz). Others, like Janusz Skumin Tyszkiewicz and Krzysztof Radziwiłł were known for their sponsorship of arts which manifested itself in their permanently retained orchestras, at their courts in Wilno (Vilnius). Musical life further flourished under the House of Vasa. Both foreign and domestic composers were active in the Commonwealth. Sigismund III brought in Italian composers and conductors, such as Luca Marenzio, Annibale Stabile, Asprilio Pacelli, Marco Scacchi and Diomedes Cato for the royal orchestra. Notable home grown musicians, who also composed and played for the King&#x27;s court, included Bartłomiej Pękiel, Jacek Różycki, Adam Jarzębski, Marcin Mielczewski, Stanisław Sylwester Szarzyński, Damian Stachowicz, Mikołaj Zieleński and Grzegorz Gorczycki.

===Architecture===

The architecture of the cities in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth reflected a combination of Polish, German and Italian trends. Italian Mannerism or the Late Renaissance had a profound impact on traditional burgher architecture which can be observed to this day – castles and tenements were fitted with central Italianate courtyards composed of arched loggias, colonnades, bay windows, balconies, portals and ornamental balustrades. Ceiling frescos, sgraffito, plafonds and coffering (patterned ceilings; Polish &quot;kaseton&quot;; from Italian &quot;cassettone&quot;) were widespread. Rooftops were generally covered with terracotta rooftiles. The most distinguishable feature of Polish Mannerism are decorative &quot;attics&quot; above the cornice on the façade. Cities in northern Poland–Lithuania and in Livonia adopted the Hanseatic (or &quot;Dutch&quot;) style as their primary form of architectural expression, comparable to that of the Netherlands, Belgium, northern Germany and Scandinavia.
The introduction of Baroque architecture was marked by construction of several Jesuit and Roman Catholic churches across Poland and Lithuania, notably the Peter and Paul Church in Kraków, the Corpus Christi Church in Nesvizh, Lublin Cathedral and UNESCO-enlisted sanctuary at Kalwaria Zebrzydowska. Fine examples of decorative Baroque and Rococo include Saint Anne&#x27;s in Kraków and the Fara Church in Poznań. Another characteristic is the common usage of black marble. Altars, fonts, portals, balustrades, columns, monuments, tombstones, headstones and whole rooms (e.g. Marble Room at the Royal Castle in Warsaw, St. Casimir Chapel of the Vilnius Cathedral and Vasa Chapel at Wawel Cathedral) were extensively decorated with black marble, which became popular after the mid-17th century.

Magnates often undertook construction projects as monuments to themselves: churches, cathedrals, monasteries (&quot;Pic. 14&quot;), and palaces like the present-day Presidential Palace in Warsaw and Pidhirtsi Castle built by Grand Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski. The largest projects involved entire towns, although in time many of them would lapse into obscurity or were abandoned. These towns were generally named after the sponsoring magnate. Among the most prominent is Zamość, founded by Jan Zamoyski and designed by the Italian architect Bernardo Morando as an ideal city. The magnates throughout Poland competed with the kings. The monumental castle Krzyżtopór, built in the style &quot;palazzo in fortezza&quot; between 1627 and 1644, had several courtyards surrounded by fortifications. Similar fortified complexes include castles in Łańcut and Krasiczyn.
The fascination with the culture and art of the Orient in the late Baroque period is reflected by Queen Marie&#x27;s Chinese Palace in Zolochiv (Złoczów). 18th-century magnate palaces represents the characteristic type of Baroque suburban residence built &quot;entre cour et jardin&quot; (between the entrance court and the garden). Its architecture – a merger of European art with old Commonwealth building traditions are visible in Wilanów Palace in Warsaw (&quot;Pic. 15&quot;), Branicki Palace in Białystok, Potocki Palace in Radzyń Podlaski, Raczyński Palace in Rogalin, Nieborów Palace and Kozłówka Palace near Lubartów. Lesser nobility resided in country manor houses known as &quot;dworek&quot;. Neoclassicism replaced Baroque by the second half of the 18th century – the last ruler of the Poland–Lithuania, Stanisław August Poniatowski, greatly admired the classical architecture of Ancient Rome and promoted it as a symbol of the Polish Enlightenment. The Palace on the Isle and the exterior of St. Anne&#x27;s Church in Warsaw are part of the neoclassical legacy of the former Commonwealth.

===&quot;Szlachta&quot; and Sarmatism===

The prevalent ideology of the &quot;szlachta&quot; became &quot;Sarmatism&quot;, named after the Sarmatians, alleged ancestors of the Poles. This belief system was an important part of &quot;szlachta&quot; culture, penetrating all aspects of its life. Sarmatism enshrined equality among &quot;szlachta&quot;, horseback riding, tradition, provincial quaint life in manor houses, peace and pacifism; championed oriental-inspired souvenirs or attire for men (&quot;żupan&quot;, &quot;kontusz&quot;, &quot;sukmana&quot;, &quot;pas kontuszowy&quot;, &quot;delia&quot;, &quot;szabla&quot;); favoured European Baroque architecture; endorsed Latin as a language of thought or expression; and served to integrate the multi-ethnic nobility by creating an almost nationalistic sense of unity and of pride in Golden Liberty.

In its early, idealistic form, Sarmatism represented a positive cultural movement: it supported religious belief, honesty, national pride, courage, equality and freedom. In time, however, it became distorted. Late extreme Sarmatism turned belief into bigotry, honesty into political naïveté, pride into arrogance, courage into stubbornness and freedom into anarchy. The faults of Sarmatism were blamed for the demise of the country from the late 18th century onwards. Criticism, often one-sided and exaggerated, was used by the Polish reformists to push for radical changes. This self-deprecation was accompanied by works of German, Russian and Austrian historians, who tried to prove that it was Poland itself that was to blame for its fall.

===Demographics===

The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was immensely multicultural throughout its existence – it comprised countless religious identities and ethnic minorities inhabiting the country&#x27;s vast territory. The precise number of minority groups and their populations can only be hypothesised. Statistically, the most prominent groups were the Poles, Lithuanians, Germans, Ruthenians and Jews. There were also considerable numbers of Czechs, Hungarians, Livonians, Romanis, Vlachs, Armenians, Italians, Scots, and the Dutch (Olędrzy), who were either categorised as merchants, settlers or refugees fleeing religious persecution.

Prior to the union with Lithuania, the Kingdom of Poland was much more homogenous; approximately 70% of the population was Polish and Roman Catholic. With the creation of the Commonwealth, the number of Poles in comparison to the total population decreased to 50%. In 1569, the population stood at 7 million, with roughly 4.5 million Poles, 750,000 Lithuanians, 700,000 Jews and 2 million Ruthenians. Historians Michał Kopczyński and Wojciech Tygielski suggest that with the territorial expansion after the Truce of Deulino in 1618, the Commonwealth&#x27;s population reached 12 million people, of which Poles constituted only 40%. At that time the nobility made up 10% of the entire population and the burghers around 15%. The average population density per square kilometer was: 24 in Mazovia, 23 in Lesser Poland, 19 in Greater Poland, 12 in Lublin palatinate, 10 in the Lwów area, 7 in Podolia and Volhynia, and 3 in the Kiev Voivodeship. There was a tendency for the people from the more densely inhabited western territories to migrate eastwards.
A sudden change in the country&#x27;s demographics occurred in the mid-17th century. The Second Northern War and the Deluge followed by famine in the period from 1648 to 1657 were accountable for at least 4 million deaths. Coupled with further territorial losses, by 1717 the population had fallen to 9 million. The population slowly recovered throughout the 18th century; just before the first partition of Poland in 1772, the Commonwealth&#x27;s population was 14 million, including around 1 million nobles. In 1792, the population of Poland was around 11 million and included 750,000 nobles.

The most multicultural and robust city in the country was Gdańsk, a major Hanseatic seaport on the Baltic and Poland&#x27;s wealthiest region. Gdańsk at the time was inhabited by a German-speaking majority and further hosted large numbers of foreign merchants, particularly of Scottish, Dutch or Scandinavian extraction. Historically, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was more diverse than the Kingdom of Poland, and was deemed a melting pot of many cultures and religions. Hence, the inhabitants of the Grand Duchy were collectively known as Litvins regardless of their nationality, with the exception of Jews residing in Lithuania who were called Litvaks.

Despite guaranteed religious tolerance, gradual Polonization and Counter-Reformation sought to minimise the Commonwealth&#x27;s diversity; the aim was to root out some minorities by imposing the Polish language, Latin, Polish culture and the Roman Catholic religion where possible. By the late 18th century, the Lithuanian language, culture and identity became vulnerable; the country&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Commonwealth of Poland&quot; in 1791.

===Religion===
The Warsaw Confederation signed on 28 January 1573 secured the rights of minorities and religions; it allowed all persons to practice any faith freely, though religious tolerance varied at times. As outlined by Norman Davies, &quot;the wording and substance of the declaration of the Confederation of Warsaw of were extraordinary with regards to prevailing conditions elsewhere in Europe; and they governed the principles of religious life in the Republic for over two hundred years.&quot; Subsequently, the Catholic church initiated a Counter-Reformation in Poland, relying heavily on methods of persuasion and legal means. As a result, compared to many other European countries, the conflict between the Catholics and the Protestants in Poland was relatively peaceful.

Poland retained religious freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was a place where the most radical religious sects, trying to escape persecution in other countries of the Christian world, sought refuge. In 1561 Giovanni Bernardino Bonifacio d&#x27;Oria, a religious exile living in Poland, wrote of his adopted country&#x27;s virtues to a colleague back in Italy: &quot;You could live here in accordance with your ideas and preferences, in great, even the greatest freedoms, including writing and publishing. No one is a censor here.&quot; Others, particularly the leaders of the Roman Catholic church, the Jesuits and papal legates, were less optimistic about Poland&#x27;s religious frivolity.

&quot;This country became a place of shelter for heretics&quot; – Cardinal Stanislaus Hosius, papal legate to Poland.
To be &quot;Polish&quot;, in remote and multi-ethnic parts of the Commonwealth, was then much less an index of ethnicity than of religion and rank; it was a designation largely reserved for the landed noble class (szlachta), which included Poles, but also many members of non-Polish origin who converted to Catholicism in increasing numbers with each following generation. For the non-Polish noble such conversion meant a final step of Polonization that followed the adoption of the Polish language and culture. Poland, as the culturally most advanced part of the Commonwealth, with the royal court, the capital, the largest cities, the second-oldest university in Central Europe (after Prague), and the more liberal and democratic social institutions had proven an irresistible magnet for the non-Polish nobility in the Commonwealth. Many referred to themselves as &quot;gente Ruthenus, natione Polonus&quot; (Ruthenian by blood, Polish by nationality) since the 16th century onwards.
As a result, in the eastern territories a Polish (or Polonised) aristocracy dominated a peasantry whose great majority was neither Polish nor Catholic. Moreover, the decades of peace brought huge colonization efforts to the eastern territories (nowadays roughly western and central Ukraine), heightening the tensions among nobles, Jews, Cossacks (traditionally Orthodox), Polish and Ruthenian peasants. When the latter, deprived of their native protectors among the Ruthenian nobility, turned for protection to cossacks that facilitated violence which in the end broke the Commonwealth. The tensions were aggravated by conflicts between Eastern Orthodoxy and the Greek Catholic Church following the Union of Brest, overall discrimination of Orthodox religions by dominant Catholicism, and several Cossack uprisings. In the west and north, many cities had sizable German minorities, often belonging to Lutheran or Reformed churches. The Commonwealth had also one of the largest Jewish diasporas in the world – by the mid-16th century 80% of the world&#x27;s Jews lived in Poland (&quot;Pic. 16&quot;).

Until the Reformation, the szlachta were mostly Catholics (&quot;Pic. 13&quot;). However, many noble families quickly adopted the Reformed religion. After the Counter-Reformation, when the Catholic Church regained power in Poland, the szlachta became almost exclusively Catholic.

The Crown had about double the population of Lithuania and five times the income of the latter&#x27;s treasury. As with other countries, the borders, area and population of the Commonwealth varied over time. After the Peace of Jam Zapolski (1582), the Commonwealth had approximately 815,000 km2 area and a population of 7.5 million. After the Truce of Deulino (1618), the Commonwealth had an area of some 990,000 km2 and a population of 11–12 million (including some 4 million Poles and close to a million Lithuanians).

===Languages===

==Legacy==

The Duchy of Warsaw, established in 1807 by Napoleon Bonaparte, traced its origins to the Commonwealth. Other revival movements appeared during the November Uprising (1830–31), the January Uprising (1863–64) and in the 1920s, with Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s failed attempt to create a Polish-led Intermarium (&quot;Międzymorze&quot;) federation that, at its largest extent, would span from Finland in the north to the Balkans in the south. The contemporary Republic of Poland considers itself a successor to the Commonwealth, whereas the Republic of Lithuania, re-established at the end of World War I, saw the participation of the Lithuanian state in the old Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth mostly in a negative light at the early stages of regaining its independence, although this attitude has been changing in recent years.

==Administrative divisions==


While the term &quot;Poland&quot; was also commonly used to denote this whole polity, Poland was in fact only part of a greater wholethe Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which comprised primarily two parts:
*the Crown of the Polish Kingdom (Poland proper), colloquially &quot;the Crown&quot;
*the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, colloquially &quot;Lithuania&quot;

The Commonwealth was further divided into smaller administrative units known as voivodeships (&quot;województwa&quot;). Each voivodeship was governed by a Voivode (&quot;wojewoda&quot;, governor). Voivodeships were further divided into &quot;powiats&quot;, each &quot;powiat&quot; being governed by a &quot;starosta&quot;. Cities were governed by castellans. There were frequent exceptions to these rules, often involving the &quot;ziemia&quot; subunit of administration.

The lands that once belonged to the Commonwealth are now largely distributed among several Central and East European countries: Poland, Ukraine, Moldova (Transnistria), Belarus, Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. Also some small towns in Upper Hungary (today mostly Slovakia), became a part of Poland in the Treaty of Lubowla (Spiš towns).

Other notable parts of the Commonwealth, without respect to region or voivodeship divisions, include:
* Lesser Poland Province (), southern Poland, with two largest cities, its capital at Kraków and Lublin in the north-east;
* Greater Poland Province (), west–central Poland around Poznań and the Warta River system;
* Mazovia (), central Poland, with its capital at Warsaw;
* Lithuania Proper (), northwest Grand Duchy, its most Catholic and ethnically Lithuanian part, capital Vilnius;
* Duchy of Samogitia (; ), westernmost and most autonomous part of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, also the western part of Lithuania Proper, capital Raseiniai;
* Royal Prussia (), at the southern shore of the Baltic Sea, was an autonomous area since the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), incorporated into the Crown in 1569 with the Commonwealth&#x27;s formation;
** Pomerelia (), Pomerania around Gdańsk, western part of Royal Prussia;
* Ruthenia (), the eastern Commonwealth, adjoining Russia;
* Duchy of Livonia (), a joint domain of the Crown and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Parts lost to Sweden in the 1620s and in 1660;
* Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (; ), a northern fief of the Commonwealth. It established a colony in Tobago in 1637 and on St. Andrews Island at the Gambia River in 1651 (see Couronian colonization);
* Silesia () was not within the Commonwealth, but small parts belonged to various Commonwealth kings; in particular, the Vasa kings were dukes of Opole (&quot;Oppeln&quot;), Prudnik (&quot;Neustadt&quot;) and Racibórz (&quot;Ratibor&quot;) from 1645 to 1666.
Commonwealth borders shifted with wars and treaties, sometimes several times in a decade, especially in the eastern and southern parts. After the Peace of Jam Zapolski (1582), the Commonwealth had approximately 815,000 km2 area and a population of 7.5 million. After the Truce of Deulino (1618), the Commonwealth had an area of some 1 million km2 (990,000 km2) and a population of about 11 million.

==Geography==
In the 16th century, the Polish bishop and cartographer Martin Kromer, who studied in Bologna, published a Latin atlas, entitled &quot;Poland: about Its Location, People, Culture, Offices and the Polish Commonwealth&quot;, which was regarded as one of the most comprehensive guides to the country.

Kromer&#x27;s works and other contemporary maps, such as those of Gerardus Mercator, show the Commonwealth as mostly plains. The Commonwealth&#x27;s southeastern part, the Kresy, was famous for its steppes. The Carpathian Mountains formed part of the southern border, with the Tatra Mountain chain the highest, and the Baltic Sea formed the Commonwealth&#x27;s northern border. As with most European countries at the time, the Commonwealth had extensive forest cover, especially in the east. Today, what remains of the Białowieża Forest constitutes the last largely intact primeval forest in Europe.

<text>Karl Eberhard Schöngarth (22 April 1903 – 16 May 1946) was a German lawyer and SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; in Nazi Germany. He was a war criminal who perpetrated mass murder and genocide in German-occupied Poland during the Holocaust. He participated in the January 1942 Wannsee Conference, at which the genocidal Final Solution to the Jewish Question was originally planned. After the war, Schöngarth and six others were tried for murdering an American pilot, Americo S. Galle, who was shot down over the Netherlands in November 1944. They were all found guilty. Schöngarth and four others were sentenced to death and executed in 1946.

== Early life ==
Schöngarth was born on 22 April 1903 in Leipzig, the son of a master brewer. He began high school at the age of 11 but, after the outbreak of the First World War, dropped out of school in order to work at a garden center to support the war effort. On 7 March 1918, Schöngarth was awarded a Young Men&#x27;s Iron Medal. After the war, he was to go back to high school to complete his education, but instead joined a &quot;Freikorps&quot; paramilitary group in Thuringia. He displayed ethno-nationalistic sentiments at an early age. He participated in the Kapp Putsch in 1920 and, in 1922, he joined the Nazi Party &quot;Ortsgruppe&quot; (local group) in Erfurt (membership number 43,870) and the Viking League. That year he also joined the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), the Nazi paramilitary organization, earned his &quot;Abitur&quot; and obtained a job as a bank teller at Deutsche bank. Following the failed Beer Hall Putsch, Schöngarth fled to Coburg to avoid a charge of treason but eventually returned to Erfurt and was granted amnesty. 

By 1924, Schöngarth&#x27;s involvement with the Nazi Party waned, he briefly served in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; Infantry Regiment 1/15 in Gießen, and then enrolled at Leipzig University, majoring in economics and law. He joined a Student Corps, &quot;Corps Germania&quot;, and continued his studies at the University of Greifswald and the University of Halle. He completed his first state legal examination in July 1928 and entered on his legal clerkship in the Erfurt district court and the Naumburg regional court. He then went on to acquire his doctorate in law from the Institute for Labor Law at the University of Leipzig on 28 June 1929 at the age of 26, and was awarded a &quot;cum laude&quot;. His thesis was on the subject of &quot;the refusal of notices of termination of employment contracts&quot;. He passed his second state legal examination in June 1932 and worked as an &quot;Assessor&quot; and assistant magistrate in Magdeburg, Erfurt and Torgau. In 1935, he married Dorothea Gross, with whom he had two sons.

== SS career ==
=== Gestapo official ===
After becoming a court official, Schöngarth began involving himself more heavily in the Nazi Party. On 1 March 1933 he joined the SS (member number 67,174), rejoined the Nazi Party (membership number 2,848,857), and was subsequently appointed as a postmaster in Erfurt. He left his postmaster position on 1 November 1935 when he joined the Prussian Gestapo in Berlin, and was assigned to the main press office and the political-church office. It is unclear how he obtained this post, but a letter from then SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Reinhard Heydrich to the Reich Ministry of the Interior recommending him, suggests that Heydrich was his patron. Schöngarth also was named as a government counselor (&quot;Regierungsrat&quot;) in April 1936. In November 1936, he became a member of the SD, the SS intelligence service, in the SD &quot;Hauptamt&quot; (later, the Reich Security Main Office) under Heydrich. Over the next few years, he was assigned as the Gestapo commander in Arnsberg (1936–1937), Bielefeld (1937), Dortmund (early 1938) and Münster (March 1938–October 1939). Advanced to senior government councilor (&quot;Oberregierungsrat&quot;) in April 1939, his next assignment, from December 1939 to January 1941, was as the Inspector for the Security Police (SiPo) and SD in &quot;Wehrkreis&quot; (military district) IV, headquartered in Dresden. On 20 November 1940, he was named to succeed Bruno Streckenbach as the (Commander of SiPo and SD) in the General Government, and he transferred to Kraków in January 1941 to work under Higher SS and Police Leader (HSSPF) SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger.

=== Einsatzgruppe in Poland ===
For part of the time during his posting in Kraków, Schöngarth led a temporary &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; unit, (&quot;Einsatzgruppe z.b.V.&quot;) in eastern Galicia. In June 1941, Schöngarth, on the orders of the RSHA, deployed Wolfgang Birkner to the Bialystok District to suppress resistance. Schöngarth was responsible for the murders of approximately 10,000 Polish Jews between July and September 1941 and the massacre of Lwów professors and their families behind the frontlines during Operation Barbarossa in the Soviet Union. The &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; led by Schöngarth murdered more than 5,000 Jews from the Brześć Ghetto between 10 and 12 July 1941. Schöngarth was a fanatical enemy of the Jews and utterly ruthless in his determination to carry out the executions. In Lwów, he informed officers under his command that anyone failing to carry out the execution orders would himself be shot, and that he would support any officer that shot a comrade for this failure.

=== Wannsee Conference ===
The Wannsee Conference, called to formulate the implementation of the Final Solution of the Jewish Question, took place during a fraught political atmosphere in the General Government. Hans Frank, the Governor General, was at odds with HSSPF Krüger who, though technically subordinate to Frank, was appointed by &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler and took orders only from him. They had major disagreements over control of the police forces, over Jewish policy and over the issue of the protection of German ethnicity and culture. Himmler, as the Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood, felt that this was solely in his purview. Heydrich, the conference organizer, wanted to ensure that the meeting ran smoothly and came to an agreement with regard to the planned actions. Due to the intense personal and political hostilities involved, Heydrich made the decision not to invite Krüger. He opted, instead, to invite Schöngarth who was less likely to clash with the representative of the General Government, Frank&#x27;s deputy, State Secretary Josef Buhler.

Schöngarth attended the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942, along with SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Rudolf Lange, representing the &quot;Reichskommissariat Ostland&quot;, who also had participated in the Holocaust with &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; A. The official minutes of the meeting (Wannsee Protocol) do not record any comments from Schöngarth who, given his recent &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; experience, certainly knew exactly what was being proposed and raised no objections. Despite the euphemisms used in the minutes, its author, SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Adolf Eichmann, testified at his trial in 1961 that the participants: &quot;were discussing the subject quite bluntly, quite differently from the language which I had to use later in the record. During the conversation they minced no words about it at all … they spoke about methods of killing, about liquidation, about extermination.&quot;

=== Police service in Greece and the Netherlands ===
In June 1942, charges of embezzlement, corruption, plundering and art racketeering were brought against Schöngarth. Himmler decided to defer any disciplinary action in order to quell rumours of corruption in the SS. Later in 1942, disputes arose in the General Government about whether to transport to the east the Jews who were working in the armaments industry. Schöngarth agreed that they were not replaceable and he began to agree with Frank that the policy should be relaxed. Krüger complained to Himmler that Schöngarth was contravening orders and was sympathetic with the views of the civil administration. He insisted that one or the other of them had to go, because they were unable to cooperate. In June 1943, Schöngarth was removed from his post in Poland and was replaced by SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot; Walther Bierkamp, who had led &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; D. Schöngarth was transferred for disciplinary reasons to an SS anti-aircraft artillery replacement regiment in Munich. This was part of a Waffen-SS unit. After a short training period, he was sent as a company commander with the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division to Lamia in occupied Greece, where he remained until July 1944 conducting anti-partisan operations.

From early July 1944 until the German surrender, Schöngarth was again made the Commander of SiPo and SD forces, this time at The Hague in the occupied Netherlands under HSSPF SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Hanns Albin Rauter. After Rauter was seriously wounded in an ambush by members of the Dutch resistance on the night of 6-7 March 1945, Schongarth immediately ordered mass executions in reprisal. A total of 263 Dutch citizens were executed, including 117 at Woeste Hoeve, the location of the ambush. On 10 March, Schöngarth was deputized to act as HSSPF for Rauter while he recovered from his wounds. During the course of the war, Schöngarth was awarded the War Merit Cross, 1st and 2nd class with Swords. After the surrender of German forces in the Netherlands, Schöngarth was taken into custody by British troops.
== Trial and execution ==
After an investigation, British occupation authorities charged Schöngarth with the murder of Americo S. Galle, an American pilot. The charge came after several Dutch people came forward and told British investigators that they had seen Galle&#x27;s plane being shot down. Galle had been captured alive, but was later escorted into the woods, after which the witnesses said they heard a gunshot. On 21 November 1944, Galle&#x27;s plane had been shot down in Enschede. He was captured by German soldiers, taken to a villa which the SD was using in Enschede, and had his army clothes changed out for civilian clothes. Schöngarth issued an order to kill Galle.

Several hours later, a car was driven to the area. Erwin Knop (born 16 August 1905), the commander of the local SiPo and the head of a local Einsatzkommando in Enschede, emerged. He was accompanied by Untersturmführer Wilhelm Hadler (born 14 February 1898) and Unterscharführer Herbert Gernoth (born 12 January 1906), both of whom were subordinates to Knop. Knop took Galle into the car. He was followed by Scharführer Erich Lebing, 56, and Waffen-SS Oberscharführer Fritz Boehm, 28, both of whom were attached to the local SD. Obersturmführer Friederich Beeck (born 5 August 1886), the head of the Enschede villa, supervised the execution, choosing a burial site and ordering a grave to be dug. Lebing drove the car into the woods and kept watch as the others prepared to carry out the execution. Knop told Galle in English what was happening, to which the airman responded by being &quot;very downhearted.&quot; Hadler and Gernoth dug a shallow grave, after which the rest of the group arrived. Hadler and Gernoth then escorted Galle from the car to the grave, where Gernoth shot him in the back of the neck.

Schöngarth, Beeck, Knop, Gernoth, Hadler, Lebing, and Boehm were tried by a British military court in Burgsteinfurt in February 1946. At the time, neither Galle&#x27;s identity nor his nationality were known, so the defendants were charged with murdering an &quot;unknown Allied airman.&quot; During his trial, Schöngarth&#x27;s crimes in Poland were never mentioned, while his crimes in the Netherlands were only briefly discussed.

* &quot;During your period in Holland, how many executions in all did you have to order or sanction?&quot;
* &quot;At the time of that interrogation I thought it would be about 150 to 200 cases, but they were all executions after proper sentences; they were only civilians who were sentenced to death on account of their disturbing order; and that was an order from the Reichskommissar.&quot;

Schöngarth denied any involvement in Galle&#x27;s death. However, all of Schöngarth&#x27;s codefendants said they had been following his orders. The lawyer for Schöngarth&#x27;s codefendants accused him of trying to force the blame onto his men.

* &quot;I put it to you that the real truth of what happened on the 21st November is this: a British or American airman landed in the grounds of the Villa and was captured by your men. You yourself decided that he was to be shot. You yourself ordered Knop to have him shot. You then went away in your car leaving your men to take the responsibility, and now that they stand in peril you, their commander, are trying to save your life at their expense.&quot;
* &quot;No.&quot;

On 11 February 1946, all of the defendants were found guilty. The defense of superior orders was rejected, with five of those convicted being sentenced to death, including Schöngarth. Lebing and Boehm avoided death sentences after using different defenses. Lebing claimed he hadn&#x27;t realized that Galle was a POW until it was too late since he was wearing civilian clothing. Boehm claimed ignorance and disgust over the execution, and said he&#x27;d tried to stop it from happening. Lebing was sentenced to 15 years in prison and Boehm was sentenced to 10 years in prison. After the trial was over, two Dutchmen found Galle&#x27;s notebook, which showed that he was an American.

Schöngarth and his condemned accomplices were all executed by hanging by Albert Pierrepoint at Hamelin Prison on 16 May 1946. Also hanged on the same day for unrelated crimes at Hamelin were Bruno Tesch and Karl Weinbacher.

While awaiting execution, Schöngarth was interviewed by a Dutch investigator. He was asked about suspected war criminal Pieter Menten and atrocities in which he was suspected of involvement. At the end of the interview, the investigator asked Schöngarth if he was telling the truth, he replied &quot;You know, I have only three weeks to live. That&#x27;s the whole truth.&quot; Shortly before his execution, Schöngarth was visited by Menten; the two turned out to be close friends. Schöngarth told Menten he&#x27;d done him many favours in the past. He made Menten promise to look out for his family, after which he gave him legal advice.

<text>Sandwell is a metropolitan borough of the West Midlands county in England. The borough is named after the Sandwell Priory, and spans a densely populated part of the West Midlands conurbation. Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council defines the borough as the six amalgamated towns of Oldbury, Rowley Regis, Smethwick, Tipton, Wednesbury and West Bromwich. Rowley Regis includes the towns of Blackheath and Cradley Heath.

Sandwell&#x27;s Strategic Town Centre is designated as West Bromwich, the largest town in the borough, while Sandwell Council House (the headquarters of the local authority) is situated in Oldbury. In 2019 Sandwell was ranked 12th most deprived of England&#x27;s 317 boroughs.

Bordering Sandwell is the City of Birmingham to the east, the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley to the south and west, the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall to the north, and the City of Wolverhampton to the north-west. Spanning the borough are the parliamentary constituencies of West Bromwich, Smethwick, the majority of Tipton and Wednesbury and also part of Halesowen, which both cross into the Dudley borough.

The borough covers an area of . At the 2011 census, it had a population of 309,000.

==History and culture==

The Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell was formed on 1 April 1974 as an amalgamation of the county boroughs of Warley (ceremonially within Worcestershire) and West Bromwich (ceremonially within Staffordshire), under the Local Government Act 1972. Warley had been formed in 1966 by a merger of the county borough of Smethwick with the municipal boroughs of Rowley Regis and Oldbury; at the same time, West Bromwich had absorbed the boroughs of Tipton and Wednesbury.

For its first 12 years of existence, Sandwell had a two-tier system of local government; Sandwell Council shared power with the West Midlands County Council. In 1986 the county council was abolished, and Sandwell effectively became a unitary authority. The borough is divided into 24 wards and is represented by 72 ward councillors on the borough council.

The borough was named after Sandwell Priory, the ruins of which are located in Sandwell Valley. Gaining widespread acceptance for the identity of Sandwell and unifying the distinct communities within the borough has been a protracted affair. The local council has considered changing its name over confusion outside the West Midlands as to the whereabouts of the borough. A survey of borough residents in June 2002 found that 65 per cent of respondents favoured retaining the name.

Landmarks and attractions in Sandwell include Sandwell Aquatics Centre, Wednesbury Museum and Art Gallery, Bishop Asbury Cottage, West Bromwich Manor House, Oak House, West Bromwich, and Sandwell Valley Country Park. It is also the home of West Bromwich Albion F.C.

Sandwell used to be a popular hotspot for car cruising. In 2015 a High Court order was introduced to ban car cruising in the area. An extension has been secured to run until at least 2021.

==Politics==
Since the council election in 2021, the political composition of the council has been as follows:

From the borough&#x27;s creation in 1974 until 2010, all Members of Parliament (MPs) within its boundaries were Labour. However, in the 2010 general election, Conservative party candidate James Morris was elected to the Halesowen and Rowley Regis seat which incorporates the Sandwell communities of Rowley Regis, Blackheath and Cradley Heath, and the neighbouring area of Halesowen which is situated within Dudley&#x27;s borders. This was the first time any part of Sandwell had elected a Conservative MP – or indeed an MP from any party other than Labour. In the December 2019 general election, however, Conservative candidates Nicola Richards and Shaun Bailey were elected to represent West Bromwich East and West Bromwich West respectively. This was the first time since the borough&#x27;s creation that West Bromwich has returned any Conservative MPs to Parliament, and the first time that a constituency fully within the boundaries of Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council has been represented by a Tory MP. The election of both Richards and Bailey has been marked as a significant milestone in the political history of the borough and marked the end to decades of control by Labour MPs.

===Wards===
The Sandwell Borough is divided into 24 electoral wards, with each one represented by 3 councillors on the borough council:

==Education==

Sandwell is home to nearly 100 primary schools, 25 secondary schools, 4 special schools and 1 college.

Sandwell College, the only further education college in the borough, was opened in September 1986 following the merger of Warley College and West Bromwich College. It was originally based in the old Warley College buildings on Pound Road, Oldbury, and the West Bromwich College buildings on West Bromwich High Street, as well as a building in Smethwick town centre, but moved into a new single site campus in West Bromwich town centre in September 2012. In 2004, a debt-ridden Sandwell College was subject to a police investigation.

<doc id="343240" wikidata="Q459494" url="?curid=343240" title="Ambrosian Rite">
<text>The Ambrosian Rite () is a Latin liturgical rite of the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church (specifically The Divine Liturgy of Saint Ambrose). The rite is named after Saint Ambrose, a bishop of Milan in the fourth century. It is used by around five million Catholics in the greater part of the Archdiocese of Milan (excluding Monza, Treviglio and Trezzo sull&#x27;Adda), in some parishes of the Diocese of Como, Bergamo, Novara, Lodi, in the Diocese of Lugano, Canton of Ticino, Switzerland, less prominently in some Western Rite orthodox parishes and on special occasions of other jurisdictions.

The Ambrosian Rite has risked suppression at various points in its history. It was reformed after the Second Vatican Council (Pope Paul VI belonged to the Ambrosian Rite, having previously been Archbishop of Milan). In the 20th century, it also gained prominence and prestige from the attentions of two other scholarly Archbishops of Milan: Achille Ratti, later Pope Pius XI, and the Blessed Ildefonso Schuster, both of whom were involved in studies and publications on the rite.

==History==
The Church of Milan&#x27;s own liturgy is named &quot;Ambrosian&quot; after its patron saint Ambrose. The Ambrosian Rite evolved and developed from the 4th century onwards. There is no direct evidence that the rite was the composition of St. Ambrose, but his name has been associated with it since the 8th century. It is possible that Ambrose, who succeeded the Arian bishop Auxentius of Milan, may have removed material seen as unorthodox by the mainstream church and issued corrected service books which included the principal characteristics distinguishing it from other rites.

According to St. Augustine (&quot;Confessiones&quot;, IX, vii) and Paulinus the Deacon (&quot;Vita S. Ambrosii&quot;, § 13), St. Ambrose introduced innovations, not indeed into the Mass, but into what would seem to be the Divine Office, at the time of his contest with the Empress Justina, for the Portian Basilica which she claimed for the Arians. St. Ambrose filled the church with Catholics and kept them there night and day until the peril was past. And he arranged Psalms and hymns for them to sing, as St. Augustine says, &quot;after the manner of the Orientals, lest the people should languish in cheerless monotony&quot;; and of this Paulinus the deacon says: &quot;Now for the first time antiphons, hymns, and vigils began to be part of the observance of the Church in Milan, which devout observance lasts to our day not only in that church but in nearly every province of the West&quot;.

From the time of St. Ambrose, whose hymns are well-known and whose liturgical allusions may certainly be explained as referring to a rite which possessed the characteristics of that which is called by his name, until the period of Charlemagne (circ AD 800), there is a gap in the history of the Milanese Rite. However, St. Simplician, the successor of St. Ambrose, added much to the rite and St. Lazarus (438-451) introduced the three days of the litanies (&quot;Cantù, Milano e il suo territorio&quot;, I, 116). The Church of Milan underwent various and for a period of some eighty years (570-649), during the Lombard conquests, the see was moved to Genoa in Liguria.

In the eighth century, manuscript evidence begins. In a short treatise on the various cursus entitled &quot;Ratio de Cursus qui fuerunt ex auctores&quot; (sic in Cotton Manuscripts, Nero A. II, in the British Library), written about the middle of the eighth century, probably by an Irish monk in France, is found perhaps the earliest attribution of the Milan use to St. Ambrose, though it quotes the authority of St. Augustine, probably alluding to the passage already mentioned: &quot;There is yet another Cursus which the blessed Bishop Augustine says that the blessed Ambrose composed because of the existence of a different use of the heretics, which previously used to be sung in Italy&quot;.

According to a narrative of Landulphus Senior, the eleventh-century chronicler of Milan, Charlemagne attempted to abolish the Ambrosian Rite, as he or his father, Pepin the Short, had abolished the Gallican Rite in France, in favour of a Gallicanized Roman Rite. He sent to Milan and caused to be destroyed or sent beyond the mountain, quasi in exilium (as if into exile), all the Ambrosian books which could be found. Eugenius the Bishop, (transmontane bishop, as Landulf calls him), begged him to reconsider his decision. After the manner of the time, an ordeal, which reminds one of the celebrated trials by fire and by battle in the case of Alfonso VI and the Mozarabic Rite, was determined on. Two books, Ambrosian and Roman, were laid closed upon the altar of St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Rome and left for three days, and the one which was found open was to win. They were both found open, and it was resolved that as God had shown that one was as acceptable as the other, the Ambrosian Rite should continue. But the destruction had been so far effective that no Ambrosian books could be found, save one missal which a faithful priest had hidden for six weeks in a cave in the mountains. Therefore the Manuale was written out from memory by certain priests and clerks (Landulph, Chron., 10-13). Walafridus Strabo, who died Abbot of Reichenau in 849, and must therefore have been nearly, if not quite, contemporary with this incident, says nothing about it, but (De Rebus Ecclesiasticis, xxii), speaking of various forms of the Mass, says: &quot;Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, also arranged a ceremonial for the Mass and other offices for his own church and for other parts of Liguria, which is still observed in the Milanese Church&quot;.

In the eleventh century Pope Nicholas II, who in 1060 had tried to abolish the Mozarabic Rite, wished also to attack the Ambrosian and was aided by St. Peter Damian but he was unsuccessful, and Pope Alexander II his successor, himself a Milanese, reversed his policy in this respect. St. Gregory VII made another attempt, and Le Brun (Explication de la Messe, III, art. I, § 8) conjectures that Landulf&#x27;s miraculous narrative was written with a purpose about that time. Having weathered these storms, the Ambrosian Rite had peace for some three centuries and a half.

In the first half of the fifteenth century Cardinal Branda da Castiglione, who died in 1448, was legate in Milan. As part of his plan for reconciling Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, and the Holy See, he endeavoured to substitute the Roman Rite for the Ambrosian. The result was a serious riot, and the Cardinal&#x27;s legateship came to an abrupt end. After that, the Ambrosian Rite was safe until the Council of Trent. The Rule of that Council, that local uses which could show a prescription of two centuries might be retained, saved Milan, not without a struggle, from the loss of its Rite, and St. Charles Borromeo though he made some alterations in a Roman direction, was most careful not to destroy its characteristics. A small attempt made against it by a Governor of Milan who had obtained permission from the Pope to have the Roman Mass said in any church which he might happen to attend, was defeated by St. Charles, and his own revisions were intended to do little more than was inevitable in a living rite.

Since his time the temper of the Milan Church has been most conservative, and the only alterations in subsequent editions seem to have been slight improvements in the wording of rubrics and in the arrangement of the books. The district in which the Ambrosian Rite is used is nominally the old archepiscopal province of Milan before the changes of 1515 and 1819, but actually, it is not exclusively used even in the city of Milan itself. In parts of the Swiss Canton of Ticino, it is used; in other parts, the Roman Rite is so much preferred that it is said that when Cardinal Gaisruck tried to force the Ambrosian upon them the inhabitants declared that they would be either Roman or Lutheran. There are traces also of the use of the Ambrosian Rite beyond the limits of the Province of Milan. In 1132-34, two Augustinian canons of Ratisbon, Paul, said by Bäumer to be Paul of Bernried, and Gebehard, held a correspondence with Anselm, Archbishop of Milan, and Martin, treasurer of St. Ambrose, with a view of obtaining copies of the books of the Ambrosian Rite, so that they might introduce it into their church. In the fourteenth century, the Emperor Charles IV introduced the Rite into the Church of St. Ambrose at Prague. Traces of it, mixed with the Roman, are said by Hoeyinck (Geschichte der kirchl. Liturgie des Bisthums Augsburg) to have remained in the diocese of Augsburg down to its last breviary of 1584, and according to Catena (Cantù, Milano e il suo territorio, 118) the use of Capua in the time of St. Charles Borromeo had some resemblance to that of Milan.

Important editions of the Ambrosian Missal were issued in 1475, 1594, 1609, 1902 and 1954. The last of these was the final edition in the form of the Ambrosian Rite that preceded the Second Vatican Council and is now used mainly in the church of San Rocco al Gentilino in Milan.

Following the guidelines of the Second Vatican Council and the preliminary revisions of the Ordinary of the Mass of the Roman Rite, a new bilingual (Latin and Italian) edition of the Ambrosian Missal was issued in 1966, simplifying the 1955 missal, mainly in the prayers the priest said inaudibly and in the genuflections, and adding the Prayer of the Faithful. The Eucharistic prayer continued to be said in Latin until 1967. The altars were moved to face the people.

When the Mass of Paul VI was issued in 1969, most Ambrosian-Rite priests began to use the new Roman Missal (only omitting the &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;), the Roman Lectionary, and the General Roman Calendar (with its four-week Advent). The Ambrosian form of administering the other sacraments was for the most part already identical with the Roman. This made it uncertain whether the Ambrosian Rite would survive. But in promulgating the documents of the 46th diocesan synod (1966–1973), Cardinal Archbishop Giovanni Colombo, supported by Pope Paul VI (a former Archbishop of Milan), finally decreed that the Ambrosian Rite, brought into line with the directives of the Second Vatican Council, should be preserved.

Work, still in progress, began on all the Ambrosian liturgical texts. On 11 April 1976, Cardinal Colombo published the new Ambrosian Missal, covering the whole liturgical year. Later in the same year an experimental Lectionary appeared, covering only some liturgical seasons, and still following the Roman-Rite Lectionary for the rest. Minor modifications of the Ambrosian Missal were implemented in 1978, restoring for example the place of the Creed in the Mass, and the new Ambrosian rite for funerals was issued.

The Ambrosian Missal also restored two early-medieval Ambrosian Eucharistic prayers, unusual for placing the epiclesis after the Words of Institution, in line with Oriental use.

In 1984-1985 the new Ambrosian Liturgy of the Hours was published and in 2006 the new Ambrosian rite of marriage. On 20 March 2008 the new Ambrosian Lectionary, superseding the 1976 experimental edition, and covering the whole liturgical year, was promulgated, coming into effect from the First Sunday of Advent 2008 (16 November 2008). It is based on the ancient Ambrosian liturgical tradition and contains in particular, a special rite of light (&quot;lucernarium&quot;) and proclamation of the resurrection of Jesus, for use before the Saturday-evening celebration of the Mass of the Sunday, seen as the weekly Easter. Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass in Milan using the Ambrosian Rite in 1983, as did Pope Francis in 2017.

==Origin==

The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1907 gives three theories of the ancient origin of the rite, none conclusive. The question resolves itself into whether the Ambrosian Rite is archaic Roman or a much-Romanized form of the Gallican Rite.

J. M. Neale and others from the Anglican tradition referred the Hispano-Gallican and Celtic family of liturgies to an original imported into Provence from Ephesus in Asia Minor by St. Irenæus, who had received it through St. Polycarp from St. John the Divine. The name Ephesine was applied to this liturgy, and it was sometimes called the Liturgy of St. John. In support of this theory, Colman, at the Synod of Whitby in 664, attributed the Celtic rule of Easter to St. John. But Neale greatly exaggerated the Romanizing effected by St. Charles Borromeo. W. C. Bishop, however, in his article on the Ambrosian Breviary, takes up the same line as Neale in claiming a Gallican origin for the Ambrosian Divine Office.

Louis Duchesne in his &quot;Origines du culte chrétien&quot; theorizes that the rite was imported or modified from the East, perhaps by the Cappadocian Arian Bishop Auxentius (355-374), the predecessor of St. Ambrose, and gradually spread to Gaul, Spain, and Britain. Jungmann later concluded that &quot;Duchesne&#x27;s thesis can be accepted in the sense that Milan was the centre from which a Gallican type liturgy took its origin.&quot; Here, &quot;Gallican&quot; means a Latin (not Eastern) liturgy somewhat different from that of Rome.

Antonio Maria Ceriani and Magistretti maintain that the Ambrosian Rite has preserved the pre-Gelasian and pre-Gregorian form of the Roman Rite.

==Differences from the Roman Rite==
Some features of the Ambrosian Rite distinguish it from the Roman Rite liturgy.

===Mass===
The main differences in the Mass are:
*The principal celebrant blesses all the readers, not only the deacon. The reader asks for the blessing saying to the priest: &quot;Bless me, father&quot;. Then, while tracing the sign of the cross, the main celebrant tells the reader: &quot;Read in the name of the Lord&quot;.
*The Gospel is followed by a short antiphon.
*The Rite of Peace comes before the Presentation of the Gifts.
*The Creed follows the Preparation of the Gifts, before the Prayer over the Gifts.
*There are some differences between the First Eucharistic Prayer of the Ambrosian Missal and the Roman Canon, the first in the Roman Missal; but its Eucharistic Prayers II, III, and IV are the same as in the Roman Rite. In addition, the Ambrosian Rite has two proper Eucharistic Prayers, used mainly on Easter and Holy Thursday. 
*The priest breaks the Host and places a piece in the main chalice before the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, while an antiphon (the &quot;Confractorium&quot;) is sung or recited.
*The &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; is not said.
*Before the final blessing, the people say &quot;Kyrie, eleison&quot; (&quot;Lord, have mercy&quot;) three times.
*At the end of the Mass, instead of saying &quot;The Mass is ended, go in peace&quot; the priest says simply &quot;Go in peace&quot;, to which the people respond &quot;In the name of Christ&quot;.
*The Ambrosian Rite has its own cycle of readings at Mass.
*Many of the prayers said by the priest during Mass are peculiar to the Ambrosian Rite, which has a particularly rich variety of prefaces.

===Liturgical year===
The main differences in the liturgical year are:
*Advent has six weeks, not four.
*Lent starts four days later than in the Roman Rite, so that Ash Wednesday is postponed to a week later than in the Roman Rite, and Carnival continues until &quot;sabato grasso&quot; (&quot;Fat Saturday&quot; in Italian), corresponding to Shrove Tuesday (called &quot;Mardi Gras&quot;, i.e. &quot;Fat Tuesday&quot;, in French) in areas where the Roman Rite is used. 
*On Fridays in Lent, Mass is not celebrated and, with a few exceptions, Communion is not distributed.
*Red, rather than the green used in the Roman Rite, is the standard colour of vestments from Pentecost to the third Sunday of October, and there are other differences in liturgical colours throughout the year.

===Other===
Other differences are that:
*The Liturgy of the Hours (also known as the Divine Office or Breviary) is different in structure and in various features.
*The liturgical rites of Holy Week are quite different.
*The rite of funerals is different.
*Baptism of infants is done by triple immersion of the head. 
*The thurible has no top cover, and is swung clockwise before the censing of a person or object.
*Ambrosian deacons wear the stole over the dalmatic and not under it.
*The Ambrosian cassock, buttoned with only five buttons below the neck, is held with a fascia at the waist, and is worn with a round white collar.
*Ambrosian chant is distinct from Gregorian chant.
*Some senior priests (notably provosts and certain canons) are entitled to wear vestments commonly associated with bishops, including the mitre.
*The liturgical burning of the faro (a large cotton sphere suspended in the air, inside the church) on feasts of martyrs.

==Early manuscripts==
The early manuscripts of the Ambrosian Rite are generally found in the following forms:

*The &quot;Sacramentary&quot; contains the Orationes super Populum, Prophecies, Epistles, Gospels, Orationes super Sindonem, and Orationes super Oblata, the Prefaces and Post-Communions throughout the year, with the variable forms of the Communicantes and Hanc igitur, when they occur, and the solitary Post Sanctus of Easter Eve, besides the ceremonies of Holy Week, etc., and the Ordinary and Canon of the Mass. There are often also occasional offices usually found in a modern ritual, such as Baptism, the Visitation and Unction of the Sick, the Burial of the Dead, and various benedictions. It is essentially a priest&#x27;s book, like the Euchologion of the Greeks.
*The &quot;Psalter&quot; contains the Psalms and Canticles. It is sometimes included with the &quot;Manual&quot;.
*The &quot;Manual&quot; is nearly the complement of the &quot;Sacramentary&quot; and the &quot;Psalter&quot; as regards both the Mass and the Divine Office. It contains for the Divine Office: the Lucernaria, Antiphons, Responsoria, Psallenda, Completoria, Capitula, Hymns, and other changeable parts, except the Lessons, which are found separately. And for the Mass, it contains the Ingressœ, Psalmellœ, Versus, Cantus, Antiphonœ ante and post Evangelium, Offertoria, Confractoria, and Transitoria. The &quot;Manual&quot; often also contains occasional services such as are now usually found in a Ritual.
*The &quot;Antiphoner&quot; is a Manual with notes.
*The &quot;Rituale&quot; and &quot;Pontificale&quot; have contents similar to those of Roman books of the same name, though the early Manuscripts are less ample.

<text>Oldbury is a market town in the metropolitan borough of Sandwell, in the county of the West Midlands, England. It is the administrative centre of the borough. At the 2011 census, the town had a population of 13,606, while the 2017 population of the wider built-up area was estimated at 25,488. Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council, which defines Oldbury Town as consisting of the wards of Bristnall, Langley, Oldbury, and Old Warley, gave the population as 50,641 in 2011.

==Etymology==
The place name Oldbury comes from the Old English &#x27;Ealdenbyrig&#x27;, – signifying that Oldbury was old even in early English times over 1,000 years ago. &quot;Eald&quot; being Old English for &#x27;old&#x27;, &quot;Byrig&quot; is the plural of &#x27;burh&#x27; in Old English – a burh being a fortification or fortified town.

==History==
Oldbury was part of the ancient parish of Halesowen, a detached part of Shropshire surrounded by Worcestershire and Staffordshire. After the dissolution of the monasteries, Henry VIII gave Hales Owen manor including Oldbury to Sir John Dudley. In 1555, Sir John&#x27;s son Robert sold most of Hales Owen manor but retained Oldbury and Langley which became a separate manor. Thus Sir Robert Dudley became the first Lord of the Manor of Oldbury. Oldbury manor was held by several families thereafter with the land gradually being sold off and the manorial functions dispersed. The last Lord of Oldbury Manor was Patrick Allan Fraser.

&quot;Pigot and Co.&#x27;s National Commercial Directory for 1828-9&quot; describes Oldbury as a village in Shropshire with close trade and manufacturing links to Dudley and Stourbridge. It notes the importance of the iron trade with its &quot;considerable blast furnaces, for making pig iron&quot; and states &quot;there are also steel works; and coal and iron-stone abound in the vicinity&quot;. Mention is made of a debtors&#x27; prison, and a court-house which held a fortnightly Court of Requests for recovery of debts not exceeding five pounds.

The first branch of Lloyds Bank was opened in Oldbury in 1864. The branch was founded to serve fellow Quakers Arthur Albright and John Wilson&#x27;s local chemical factory. The original building survives, but the Lloyds bank branch closed around 2005. 

==Local government==

By the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844, Oldbury was reincorporated into Worcestershire after a nine-hundred-year absence. 

Oldbury was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Halesowen, in 1866 Oldbury became a separate civil parish, in 1894, Oldbury became an Urban District, based at the Municipal Buildings and in 1935 the area gained Municipal Borough-status. Oldbury council built several thousand houses, flats and bungalows for 40 years from 1893 until its disbandment, the 1,000th of which was completed in 1933 at Wallace Road near the border with Rowley Regis. On 1 April 1966 the district was abolished and merged with the County Borough of Smethwick and the Municipal Borough of Rowley Regis to form the County Borough of Warley, part also went to the Municipal Borough of Halesowen and the County Borough of West Bromwich. The parish was also abolished on 1 April 1966 to form Warley, part also went to Halesowen and West Bromwich. In 1961 the parish had a population of 53,948.

In 1974, Oldbury became part of the new Sandwell Metropolitan Borough (a merger between the county boroughs of West Bromwich and Warley), and was transferred from Worcestershire into the new West Midlands Metropolitan County. Since 1986, after the abolition of the West Midlands County Council, Sandwell effectively became a unitary authority. Sandwell Council&#x27;s headquarters are in Oldbury town centre.

==Industry and commerce==
The town has seen a large expansion in retail since 1980. In October 1980, JSainsbury opened one of its first SavaCentre hypermarkets in Oldbury town centre. Twenty years later, it was rebranded as a traditional Sainsbury&#x27;s store as the SavaCentre side of the business was phased out. A Toys &quot;R&quot; Us superstore at Birchley Island opened in October 1988 but the retail chain went out of business in 2018. Oldbury Green Retail Park was built next to the town&#x27;s ring road in the mid-1990s. Homebase relocated there from its 1980s purpose-built store, which Gala Bingo subsequently took over.

Due to the socio-economics of Sandwell, the area has a number of social housing organisations such as Black Country Housing Group which has been operating in Sandwell since its relocation from Birmingham in the 1980s.

In October 2013, the commercial radio station Free Radio moved its local operations for the Black Country and Shropshire from Wolverhampton to new studios at Black Country House.

==Transport links==
===Rail=== 

For over thirty years, there were three railway stations in the parish with the name Oldbury; only one is still open, but under a new name. The surviving one, on the Stour Valley Line at Bromford Road, has existed since the 1850s. It was originally called Oldbury &amp; Bromford Lane, then Oldbury, and since 1984, Sandwell &amp; Dudley.

The second nearest railway station to the centre of Oldbury is Langley Green on the Stourbridge Extension Line, now the Birmingham to Worcester via Kidderminster Line. It opened in April 1867 and was originally called Langley Green &amp; Rood End, until a short half-mile long branch line, the Oldbury Railway, was linked to the station with its own (third) platform; this opened in November 1884 and the station was renamed Oldbury &amp; Langley Green. The Oldbury Railway, which also linked to Albright and Wilson, had both a passenger station, named Oldbury, on Halesowen Road; and a goods station, at the Birmingham Canal Navigations wharf in Oldbury. Passenger services ran to Oldbury station until March 1915; and the line closed completely other than as a freight line for Albright and Wilson. All traces of its viaduct and embankment beyond Tat Bank Road were destroyed in 1964 when the M5 motorway was built. A short stub of the line to Oldbury remained in situ but out of use.

===Road===

The M5 motorway runs through the town on an elevated section supported by reinforced concrete pillars. Access is from junction 2. 

The A4123 Birmingham to Wolverhampton dual carriageway runs just to west of the town centre. It provides a link from the Hagley Road near Harborne, Birmingham and runs north-westerly via Causeway Green to Birchley Island (M5 junction 2) and on through Tividale to Burnt Tree Junction where it becomes the Birmingham New Road. The road took three years to complete and was opened by the Prince of Wales on 2 November 1927. 

Buses run from Oldbury town centre to Bearwood, Birmingham city centre, Dudley, Halesowen, Merry Hill Shopping Centre, West Bromwich and Walsall. Services are operated by National Express West Midlands and Diamond Bus.

===Canal===
James Brindley&#x27;s original Birmingham Canal was cut south of Oldbury town centre in 1768.

<text>Rowley Regis ( ) is a town and former municipal borough in Sandwell in the county of the West Midlands, England. It forms part of the area immediately west of Birmingham known as the Black Country and encompasses the four Sandwell council wards of Blackheath, Cradley Heath and Old Hill, Tividale and Rowley. At the 2011 census, the combined population of these wards was 50,257.

==History==

The history of Rowley Regis can be traced back to the 12th century, when a small village grew around the parish church of St Giles, southeast of Dudley. Rowley was part of the Royal hunting grounds – Regis was added to the name of Rowley in around 1140 to signify it was that part of Rowley belonging to the King. 

Along with the rest of the Black Country, Rowley Regis began to see substantial development in the early to mid-19th century. Coal was mined at the Earl of Dudley&#x27;s Ramrod Colliery from 1855, at Rowley Hall Colliery from 1865 and at Bell End Colliery off Mincing Lane. The three collieries were connected by mineral tramway to the Causeway Green branch canal at Titford. All had ceased operation by 1920.

In 1933, Rowley Regis became a borough, and incorporated the communities of Blackheath, Old Hill, and Cradley Heath. These places were all within the ancient parish of Rowley Regis, which (despite being in the county of Staffordshire) was in the diocese of Worcester. The parish contained the manors of Rowley Regis and Rowley Somery, the latter being part of the barony of Dudley, but the extents of these manors and the relationship between them are not clear. Around the time that Rowley Regis became a borough, housebuilding accelerated in both the public and private sectors.

The present St Giles Church on Church Road is not the original church in Rowley Regis. The church built in 1840 to succeed the original mediaeval building, was found to be unsafe and condemned in 1900. The next church, built in 1904, was burned down in 1913, some believing the fire to have been started by Suffragettes or local striking steelworkers; this however is supposition and it was more than probable it was a simple accident, the church at this time using paraffin as a means of lighting and the latter perhaps causing the fire. Its present-day successor was designed by Holland W. Hobbiss and A. S. Dixon, and was built in 1923.
Rowley Regis railway station opened in 1867 in the south of the then village, and remains in use to this day.

The new Rowley Regis grammar school was opened on Hawes Lane in September 1962. Well-known former pupils include Pete Williams (original bass player with Dexys Midnight Runners), and actress Josie Lawrence. From September 1975, when comprehensive schools became universal in the new borough of Sandwell, the grammar school became Rowley Regis Sixth Form College, the last intake of grammar school pupils having been inducted the previous year. The younger pupils were distributed between local comprehensive schools.

In September 2003, it became an annexe of Dudley College, but this arrangement lasted just one year before the buildings fell into disuse. It was demolished three years later, and the site was redeveloped as the new Rowley Learning Campus under Sandwell&#x27;s Building Schools for the Future programme, comprising St Michael&#x27;s Church of England High School, Westminster Special School, and Whiteheath Education Centre, which opened in September 2011.


===Civic history===

Originally in Staffordshire, the Rowley Regis Urban District was formed in 1894 to cover the villages of Rowley, Blackheath, Cradley Heath, and Old Hill. The urban district was incorporated into a municipal borough in 1933. Following the acquisition of borough status, plans were unveiled to build new council offices in the borough to replace the existing offices in Lawrence Lane, Old Hill. A site on the corner of Halesowen Road and Barrs Road was selected. Work commenced in October 1937, and the building was opened by the Mayor of Rowley Regis in December 1938. Birmingham&#x27;s &quot;Evening Despatch&quot; newspaper described the building as &quot;spacious, imposing and distinctly modern&quot;. 

On 1 April 1966, the borough of Rowley Regis merged with the boroughs of Oldbury and Smethwick to form the Warley County Borough, part also went to the County Borough of West Bromwich, the County Borough of Dudley and the Municipal Borough of Halesowen, Rowley Regis became part of Worcestershire. The merger was unpopular with many residents and derided by some as &#x27;Warley white elephant&#x27;. The parish was also abolished on 1 April 1966 to form Warley, part also went to West Bromwich, Dudley and Halesowen. In 1961 the parish had a population of 48,146.

In 1974, Warley merged with West Bromwich to form Sandwell Metropolitan Borough in the new county of West Midlands.

Following the demise of Rowley Regis as a standalone borough in 1966, the council offices in Barrs Road were retained by Warley council and then by Sandwell council. However, a plan was submitted in July 2012 by Sandwell Leisure Trust to demolish the buildings to make way for an expansion to the neighbouring Haden Hill Leisure Centre, and the development of a new fire station.

The archives for Rowley Regis Borough are held at Sandwell Community History and Archives Service.

==Geography==

Rowley Regis is the location of the Rowley Hills, famed for the quarrying of Rowley Rag Stone. The hills form part of the east/west watershed between the rivers Trent and Severn, and contain the highest point in the West Midlands region, Turner&#x27;s Hill, at 269m above sea level.

A feature in &quot;The Birmingham Post&quot; of 10 November, 1952 describes Rowley Regis as a &quot;Town in Tiers&quot;; the explanation being that Cradley Heath and Old Hill lie in a valley, Blackheath is &quot;the next step up&quot; followed by a further climb up to Rowley parish church and up and over the Rowley Hills to Tividale.

<doc id="343246" wikidata="Q46966" url="?curid=343246" title="Ice shelf">
<text>An ice shelf is a large platform of glacial ice floating on the ocean, fed by one or multiple tributary glaciers. Ice shelves form along coastlines where the ice thickness is insufficient to displace the more dense surrounding ocean water. The boundary between the ice shelf (floating) and grounded ice (resting on bedrock or sediment) is referred to as the grounding line; the boundary between the ice shelf and the open ocean (often covered by sea ice) is the ice front or calving front. 
Ice shelves are found in Antarctica and the Arctic (Greenland, Northern Canada, and the Russian Arctic), and can range in thickness from about . The world&#x27;s largest ice shelves are the Ross Ice Shelf and the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf in Antarctica.

The movement of ice shelves is principally driven by gravity-induced pressure from the grounded ice. That flow continually moves ice from the grounding line to the seaward front of the shelf. Typically, a shelf front will extend forward for years or decades between major calving events (calving is the sudden release and breaking away of a mass of ice from a glacier, iceberg, ice front, ice shelf, or crevasse). Snow accumulation on the upper surface and melting from the lower surface are also important to the mass balance of an ice shelf. Ice may also accrete onto the underside of the shelf. 

The effects of climate change are visible in the changes to the cryosphere, such as reduction in sea ice and ice sheets, and disruption of ice shelves. In the last several decades, glaciologists have observed consistent decreases in ice shelf extent through melt, calving, and complete disintegration of some shelves. Well studied examples include disruptions of the Thwaites Ice Shelf, Larsen Ice Shelf, Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf (all three in the Antarctic) and the disruption of the Ellesmere Ice Shelf in the Arctic.

== Definition ==
An ice shelf is &quot;a floating slab of ice originating from land of considerable thickness extending from the coast (usually of great horizontal extent with a very gently sloping surface), resulting from the flow of ice sheets, initially formed by the accumulation of snow, and often filling embayments in the coastline of an ice sheet.&quot;

In contrast, sea ice is formed on water, is much thinner (typically less than ), and forms throughout the Arctic Ocean. It is also found in the Southern Ocean around the continent of Antarctica.

The term &quot;captured ice shelf&quot; has been used for the ice over a subglacial lake, such as Lake Vostok.

== Properties ==

Ice shelves are thick plates of ice, formed continuously by glaciers, that float atop an ocean. The shelves act as &quot;brakes&quot; for the glaciers. These shelves serve another important purpose—&quot;they moderate the amount of melting that occurs on the glaciers&#x27; surfaces. Once their ice shelves are removed, the glaciers increase in speed due to meltwater percolation and/or a reduction of braking forces, and they may begin to dump more ice into the ocean than they gather as snow in their catchments. Glacier ice speed increases are already observed in Peninsula areas where ice shelves disintegrated in prior years.&quot;

=== Height ===
The density contrast between glacial ice and liquid water means that at least of the floating ice is above the ocean surface, depending on how much pressurized air is contained in the bubbles within the glacial ice, stemming from compressed snow. The formula for the denominators above is formula_1, density of cold seawater is about 1028 kg/m3 and that of glacial ice from about 850 kg/m3 to well below 920 kg/m3, the limit for very cold ice without bubbles. The height of the shelf above the sea can be even larger, if there is much less dense firn and snow above the glacier ice.

== By country or region ==

=== Antarctica ===


A large portion of the Antarctic coastline has ice shelves attached. Their aggregate area is over .

It has been found that of all the ice shelves on Earth, nearly all of them are in Antarctica.

In steady state, about half of Antarctica&#x27;s ice shelf mass is lost to basal melt and half is lost to calving, but the relative importance of each process varies significantly between ice shelves. In recent decades, Antarctica&#x27;s ice shelves have been out of balance, as they have lost more mass to basal melt and calving than has been replenished by the influx of new ice and snow.

====Ross Ice Shelf====

====Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf====
=== Arctic ===

==== Canada ====
All Canadian ice shelves are attached to Ellesmere Island and lie north of 82°N. Ice shelves that are still in existence are the Alfred Ernest Ice Shelf, Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, Milne Ice Shelf and Smith Ice Shelf. The M&#x27;Clintock Ice Shelf broke up from 1963 to 1966; the Ayles Ice Shelf broke up in 2005; and the Markham Ice Shelf broke up in 2008. The remaining ice shelves have also lost a significant amount of their area over time, with the Milne Ice Shelf being the last to be affected, with it breaking off in August 2020.

==== Russia ====
The Matusevich Ice Shelf was a ice shelf located in Severnaya Zemlya being fed by some of the largest ice caps on October Revolution Island, the Karpinsky Ice Cap to the south and the Rusanov Ice Cap to the north. In 2012 it ceased to exist.

== Disruption due to climate change ==

In the last several decades, glaciologists have observed consistent decreases in ice shelf extent through melt, calving, and complete disintegration of some shelves. Well studied examples include disruptions of the Thwaites Ice Shelf, Larsen Ice Shelf, Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf (all three in the Antarctic) and the disruption of the Ellesmere Ice Shelf in the Arctic.

The effects of climate change are visible in the changes to the cryosphere, such as reduction in sea ice and ice sheets, and disruption of ice shelves.

===Disruption of Thwaites Ice Shelf===

===Disruption of Larsen Ice Shelf===
Two sections of Antarctica&#x27;s Larsen Ice Shelf broke apart into hundreds of unusually small fragments (hundreds of meters wide or less) in 1995 and 2002, Larsen C calved a huge ice island in 2017.

* Prince Gustav Ice Shelf has gone from an area of to in 2008. After their loss the reduced buttressing of feeder glaciers has allowed the expected speed-up of inland ice masses after shelf ice break-up.
* The Ross Ice Shelf is the largest ice shelf of Antarctica (an area of roughly and about across: about the size of France).
* Wilkins Ice Shelf is another ice shelf that has suffered substantial retreat. The ice shelf had an area of in 1998 when was lost that year. In 2007 and 2008 significant rifting developed and led to the loss of another of area and some of the calving occurred in the Austral winter. The calving seemed to have resulted from preconditioning such as thinning, possibly due to basal melt, as surface melt was not as evident, leading to a reduction in the strength of the pinning point connections. The thinner ice then experienced spreading rifts and breakup. This period culminated in the collapse of an ice bridge connecting the main ice shelf to Charcot Island leading to the loss of an additional between February and June 2009.

===Disruption of Ellesmere Ice Shelf (Arctic)===
The Ellesmere ice shelf was reduced by 90% in the twentieth century, leaving the separate Alfred Ernest, Ayles, Milne, Ward Hunt, and Markham ice shelves. A 1986 survey of Canadian ice shelves found that 48 km2 (3.3 cubic kilometres) of ice calved from the Milne and Ayles ice shelves between 1959 and 1974. The Ayles Ice Shelf calved entirely on August 13, 2005. The Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, the largest remaining section of thick (&gt;) landfast sea ice along the northern coastline of Ellesmere Island, lost of ice in a massive calving in 1961–1962. It further decreased by 27% in thickness () between 1967 and 1999. In the summer of 2002, the Ward Ice Shelf experienced another major breakup, and other instances of note happened in 2008 and 2010 as well. The last remnant to remain mostly intact, the Milne Ice Shelf, also ultimately experienced a major breakup at the end of July 2020, losing over 40% of its area.

<text>The Congress of Gniezno (, or &quot;Gnesener Übereinkunft&quot;) was an amicable meeting between the Polish Duke Bolesław I the Brave and Emperor Otto III, which took place at Gniezno in Poland on 11 March 1000. Scholars disagree over the details of the decisions made at the convention, especially whether the ruler of Poland was pledged the king&#x27;s crown or not.

==Background==

After his death in 997 during a mission among the pagan Prussian tribes, Bishop Adalbert of Prague was quickly canonized by the common effort of Duke Bolesław I and Emperor Otto III. Thus, Adalbert became the first Slavic bishop to become a saint. His body, bought back by Bolesław from the Prussians for its weight in gold, was put into a tomb at Gniezno Cathedral, which became the ecclesiastical center of Poland.

According to the chronicles of Thietmar of Merseburg, Otto III, who had been a friend and pupil of Adalbert, committed to a pilgrimage from Italy to St. Adalbert&#x27;s tomb in Gniezno; in his attempt to extend the influence of Christianity in Central and Eastern Europe, and to renew the Holy Roman Empire based on a federal concept (&quot;renovatio imperii Romanorum&quot;) with the Polish and Hungarian duchies upgraded to eastern &quot;federati&quot; of the empire. As part of this policy he also invested Grand Prince Stephen I of Hungary with the king&#x27;s crown (the Crown of Saint Stephen). 

The Polish Piast dynasty under Mieszko I had extended their domains beyond the Oder river, where their claims to power collided with the interests of the Saxon margrave Gero. After his defeat by Gero&#x27;s troops in 963, Mieszko I decided to come to terms with Emperor Otto I and agreed to pay tribute for this part of his lands. In turn he gained the title of &quot;amicus imperatoris&quot; (&quot;Friend of the Emperor&quot;) and the acknowledgment of his position as a &quot;Dux&quot; of Poland. He continued his policy of convergence with the Empire by marrying Oda, the daughter of the Saxon margrave Dietrich of Haldensleben, in 978 and by marrying his son Bolesław I to a daughter of Margrave Rikdag of Meissen. As a precaution however, shortly before his death in 992 he placed his realm (Civitas Schinesghe) under the protection of Pope John XV according to the &quot;dagome iudex&quot; regest. 

When his son Bolesław succeeded him, Poland remained an ally of the Empire in the campaigns against the Polabian Lutici tribes. Emperor Otto II died at the age of 28 in 983. His widow Theophanu acted as regent for her son, also called Otto. In 996 Otto III was crowned as Holy Roman Emperor at Rome. By the time of the congress at Gniezno in AD 1000, he was 20 years old.

==The act==

On the pilgrimage to Gniezno, Emperor Otto III was received by Bolesław at the Polish border on the Bóbr river near Małomice. Bishop Unger of Poznań escorted him to Gniezno. Between the 7th and 15th of March Otto invested Bolesław with the titles &quot;frater et cooperator Imperii&quot; (&quot;Brother and Partner of the Empire&quot;) and &quot;populi Romani amicus et socius&quot; as rendered in the 1115 &quot;Gesta principum Polonorum&quot; by the Kraków chronicler Gallus Anonymus, the first author of Polish history. Whether the act implemented an elevation of Bolesław to the status of &quot;king&quot; has not been conclusively established. In any case, Bolesław had himself crowned King of Poland at Gniezno Cathedral in 1025. 

On the same visit, Otto III raised Gniezno to the rank of an archbishopric. Three new dioceses subordinate to Gniezno were created: the Bishopric of Kraków (assigned to Bishop Poppo), the Bishopric of Wrocław (assigned to Bishop Jan) and the Bishopric of Kołobrzeg in Pomerania (assigned to bishop Reinbern). St. Adalbert&#x27;s brother Radzim Gaudenty became the first archbishop of Gniezno. Otto III gave Bolesław a replica of his Holy Lance, part of the Imperial Regalia, and Bolesław presented the Emperor with a relic, an arm of St. Adalbert in exchange.

The status of the Bishopric of Poznań of Bishop Unger, whose diocese had also comprised Gniezno before and who had not supported the creation of a separate archdiocese in Gniezno, is also subject to historical debate. One view holds that it stayed independent and with Unger as a missionary bishop directly subordinate to the pope while another one holds that it was attached to the Archbishopric of Magdeburg, the nearest German ecclesiastical province. However, generally, the congress is seen as having established complete ecclesiastical independence of the Polish church from Magdeburg. 

Bolesław subsequently accompanied Otto III on his way back to Germany. Both proceeded to the grave of Charlemagne at Aachen Cathedral, where Bolesław received Charlemagne&#x27;s throne as a gift. Both arranged the betrothal of Bolesław&#x27;s son Mieszko II Lambert with the Emperor&#x27;s niece Richeza of Lotharingia.

==Aftermath==
Due to Otto&#x27;s early death in 1002, his &quot;renovatio&quot; policies were not fully realized. King Henry II, Otto&#x27;s successor, changed the empire&#x27;s policies. Bolesław supported Henry&#x27;s rival, Margrave Eckard I of Meissen, expanded the Polish realm into the March of Lusatia and the Milceni lands, and also took the Bohemian throne at Prague, interfering with Henry&#x27;s interests. During a meeting with Henry II in Merseburg, Bolesław was attacked by Henry&#x27;s men and narrowly escaped with his life. As a consequence, the excellent relations between the Empire and Poland marked by the Congress of Gniezno turned into a state of hostility that soon emerged into a German–Polish War which finally ended with the 1018 Peace of Bautzen. 

It was not until Henry&#x27;s death in 1024, that Bolesław was able to acquire the papal consent for his coronation as Polish king. The Pomeranian diocese of Kołobrzeg, founded as a consequence of the Congress of Gniezno, was overthrown by a pagan resurgence of the Pomeranians around 1007, and bishop Reinbern was forced to return to Boleslaw&#x27;s court.

The creation of the separate Archdiocese of Gniezno, as directly subordinate to the Holy See rather than a German archdiocese, kept Poland independent from the Holy Roman Empire throughout the Middle Ages. Around 1075 the Bishopric of Poznań became a suffragan diocese of Gniezno. The archdiocese then controlled the whole Piast realm, as confirmed by the papal Bull of Gniezno in 1136.

<text>The 1921 Canadian federal election was held on December 6, 1921, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 14th Parliament of Canada. The Union government that had governed Canada through the First World War was defeated, and replaced by a Liberal government under the young leader William Lyon Mackenzie King. A new third party, the Progressive Party, won the second most seats in the election.

Since the 1911 election, the country had been governed by the Conservatives, first under the leadership of Prime Minister Robert Borden and then under Prime Minister Arthur Meighen. During the war, the Conservatives had united with the pro-conscription Liberal-Unionists and formed a Union government. A number of Members of Parliament (MPs), mostly Quebecers, stayed loyal to Sir Wilfrid Laurier, however, and they maintained their independence. When Laurier died, he was replaced as leader by the Ontarian Mackenzie King. After the 1919 federal budget, a number of western unionist MPs, who were former Liberals, left the Union government in protest against high tariffs on farm products imposed by the budget. Led by Thomas Alexander Crerar, the group became known as the Progressive Party. Also running were a number of Labour advocates, foremost amongst them J. S. Woodsworth of Winnipeg, who had organized their political movement after the Winnipeg general strike of 1919. Meighen had played a key role in violently suppressing the strikers and this earned him the animosity of organized labour.

Meighen attempted to make the &quot;Unionist&quot; party a permanent alliance of Tories and Liberals by renaming it the National Liberal and Conservative Party, but the name change failed, and most Unionist Liberals either returned to the Liberal fold or joined the new Progressive Party. Besides the labour strife and farm tariffs in the Prairie provinces, the Conscription Crisis of 1917 had a lasting effect on Tory fortunes by making the party virtually unelectable in Quebec.

The election was the first in which the majority of Canadian women were allowed to vote, thanks to reforms passed by the Conservatives. Five women also ran for office. Agnes Macphail of the Progressive Party was elected as the first woman MP in Canada.

Parliament was split three ways by this election. King&#x27;s Liberals took 41 percent of the vote and won a majority government of just one seat. It won all of Quebec, much of the Maritime Provinces, and a good portion of Ontario.

The Progressive Party, including the United Farmers of Alberta (UFA), won the second largest number of seats, dominating the Prairies, and winning almost a third of the seats in Ontario. Liberal and Conservative candidates were shut out in Alberta, with 10 UFA and two Labour candidates taking the province&#x27;s 12 federal seats. The party won only one seat east of Ontario, however. Despite winning the second most seats, it declined to form the official opposition. It would be the only Canadian federal election before 1993 in which a party other than the Liberals or the Conservatives/Progressive Conservatives won the second most seats.

The Unionists/Conservatives lost the most seats up to that time of any governing party at the federal level. They won fewer seats than the Progressives (despite having more popular votes) but were named as the official opposition anyway. The Conservatives won much of the Ontario seats and had some support in the Maritimes and British Columbia but won no seats in the Prairies or in Quebec.

Three Labour MPs were elected: Independent Labour candidate J. S. Woodsworth won a Winnipeg seat largely due to his role in the 1919 Winnipeg general strike, and Labour Party candidates William Irvine and Joseph Tweed Shaw were elected in Calgary.

==Majority or minority?==
King&#x27;s party won a slim majority of seats in the election. But the government that King formed in the parliament after this election soon became a minority government due to resignations and subsequent byelection defeats.

But his government achieved a slim majority again. This was strengthened when it gained two seats from Progressives who crossed the floor.

The Liberal Party lost two by-elections to Conservative candidates, but its majority was not affected by these losses. From November 25, 1924, to the dissolution of parliament, it held a two-seat majority because of its victory in a by-election in a seat that had been held by the Conservatives.

The Progressive caucus was less united than the Liberals or Conservatives, due to the formation of the Ginger Group and the semi-autonomous United Farmers of Alberta group. The Farmer MPs had promised among other things that they would reject the traditional Parliamentary traditions such as that of bending to the will of the party leader and whip. Many Progressives argued that an MP should be able to vote against the party line so long as the vote was in accordance to his constituents&#x27; wishes. As a result, King always found enough Progressive MPs who backed him on crucial votes and he generally had a working majority, until after four years in power, in 1925 his government was brought down by an adverse vote due to a moment of confusion.

== Electoral system ==

Most of the MPs were elected in single-winner First past the post; Ottawa and Halifax were two-seat ridings with each voter able to cast up to two votes as per Plurality block voting.

==National results ==

Note:

* not applicable - the party was not recognized in the previous election

* UFA candidates were sometimes referred to as Progressives, just as sometimes &quot;Progressive&quot; candidates running outside Alberta were referred to as UFA. All farmer/Progressive candidates running in Alberta were both UFA and Progressive, and sat as such in the House of Commons, at least until the UFA caucus became more independent. The vote shares of Progressive and UFA candidates shown above, if combined, are accurate for the two parties together as one.)

<doc id="343250" wikidata="Q1612069" url="?curid=343250" title="Junkanoo">
<text>Junkanoo is a festival that was originated during the period of African chattel slavery in British American colonies. It is practiced most notably in The Bahamas, Jamaica and Belize, and historically in North Carolina and Miami, where there are significant settlements of West Indian people during the post-emancipation era. In the present day, there are considerable variations in performance and spelling, but there are the shared elements of masquerade (or masking), drumming, dance, and parading.

In many territories, Junkanoo is observed around the week of Christmas. These Christmas-time parades are predominantly showcased in Jamaica. In The Bahamas, it was initially called Junkanoo and is said to date back to the 1700s where it is celebrated year round. In Belize, where the music is also mainstreamed, competition results are hotly contested. There are also Junkanoo parades in Miami in June and Key West in October, where local black populations have their roots in the Caribbean.

== Origins ==
Its origin is assumed to have begun in The Bahamas, but is claimed by several other islands in the English-speaking Caribbean. However, evidence shows that Junkanoo&#x27;s origins point strongly to Jamaica and was later spread throughout the Caribbean as early as the 18th century. Though stemming from the same origin, each celebration has been localized by different countries and, over time, evolved to be somewhat different.

This tradition is one of the oldest dance celebrations in Jamaica. In addition to being a cultural dance for the Garifuna people, this type of dancing is also performed in The Bahamas on their independence day and other historical holidays. 

Historically, Junkanoo parades were also found in southeastern North Carolina that can be traced back to Jamaican roots. However, the custom became less popular after slavery was abolished. The last known Junkanoo celebration in the Southern United States was in Wilmington, North Carolina, in the late 1880s.

Dances are choreographed to the beat of goatskin drums and cowbells.

==History==
The festival may have originated several centuries ago when enslaved Africans or their descendants, on the plantations in Jamaica, celebrated holidays granted around Christmastime. This was done with dance, music (drumming), and costumes. The costumes and drumming used in celebration in Jamaica show strong similarities to West African mask dances. 

A contribution to the origins of this Jamaican tradition could be found in three &quot;groups&quot; of West African festival traditions. These are;

# the annual New Yam Festival of the Mmo secret society of the Igbo peoples
# the Egungun masquerades of the Yoruba people, and 
# the Homowo yam festival of the Ga people

The tradition continued in countries like The Bahamas after emancipation. Junkanoo evolved far from simple origins to a formal, organized parade with intricate costumes, themed music, and official prizes within various categories.

The origin of the word &quot;junkanoo&quot; is disputed. Theories include that it is named after a folk hero named John Canoe or that it is derived from the French term &quot;gens inconnus&quot; (unknown people), as the revelers wear masks. 

Douglas Chambers, professor of African studies at the University of Southern Mississippi, suggests a possible Igbo origin from the Igbo yam deity &quot;Njoku Ji,&quot; referencing festivities in time for the New Yam Festival. Chambers also suggests a link with the Igbo &quot;okonko&quot; masking tradition of southern Igboland, which features horned maskers and other masked characters, similar to junkanoo masks. 

Similarities with the Yoruba Egungun festivals have also been identified. However, an Akan origin is more likely because the celebration of the Fancy Dress Festivals/Masquerades are during the same time (Christmas week (December 25–January 1)) in the Central and Western Regions of Ghana. In addition, John Canoe was an existing Ahanta chief and an Akan warrior hero that ruled Axim, Ghana before 1720, the same year the John Canoe festival was created in the Caribbean. As scholar Jeroen Dewulf pointed out, the term may have had a religious dimension, relating to the Akan deity &quot;Nyankompong&quot; (in today&#x27;s spelling), who was known in eighteenth-century English sources as &quot;John Company&quot;.

According to Edward Long, an 18th-century Jamaican enslaver/historian, the John Canoe festival was created in Jamaica and the Caribbean by enslaved Akan who backed the man known as John Canoe. Canoe was an ally soldier for the Germans until he turned his back on them for his Ahanta people, siding with the Asante, Nzema, Wassa and others in an alliance called Kotoko (another name for the Asante state), to take the area from the Germans and other Europeans. The news of his victory reached Jamaica, and he has been celebrated ever since the Christmas of 1708 when he first defeated Prussian forces for Axim. Twenty years later, his stronghold was broken by neighboring Fante forces, aided by the military might of the British.

Ahanta and other Asante Kotoko captives were taken to Jamaica as prisoners of war. The festival itself includes motifs from battles typical of Akan fashion. The many war masks and dance formations of the Ahanta people became part of this celebration worldwide, especially in the Caribbean. The elaborate masks and attire resemble Akan battledress with charms, referred to as a Batakari

==Description==
Junkanoo has been prominent and celebrated in colonies such as Jamaica (as Jankunu, jonkonnu), The Bahamas (as Junkanoo), and North Carolina.

Historian Stephen Nissenbaum described the festival as it was performed in 19th-century North Carolina: 
Essentially, it involved a band of black men—generally young—who dressed themselves in ornate and often bizarre costumes. Each band was led by a man who was variously dressed in animal horns, elaborate rags, female disguise, whiteface (and wearing a gentleman&#x27;s wig!), or simply his &quot;Sunday-go-to-meeting-suit.&quot; Accompanied by music, the band marched along the roads from plantation to plantation and town to town, accosting whites and sometimes even entering their houses. In the process, the men performed elaborate and (to white observers) grotesque dances that were probably of African origin. In return for this performance, they always demanded money (the leader generally carried &quot;a small bowl or tin cup&quot; for this purpose), though whiskey was an acceptable substitute.

==Popular culture==
The Junkanoo parade has been featured in movies, such as the James Bond film &quot;Thunderball&quot; (erroneously described as a local Mardi Gras-type festival), &quot;After the Sunset&quot;, and &quot;Jaws The Revenge.&quot; It was also in the season one episode, &quot;Calderone&#x27;s Return (Part II),&quot; of the 1984 television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, taking place on the fictitious island of St. Andrews. 

A song titled &quot;Junkanoo Holiday (Fallin&#x27;-Flyin&#x27;)&quot; was written by Kenny Loggins and is featured on his 1979 album &quot;Keep The Fire&quot;. This song immediately follows the hit song, &quot;This Is It,&quot; on the album. &quot;This Is It&quot; has a fade ending that segues into &quot;Junkanoo Holiday (Fallin&#x27;-Flyin&#x27;)&quot;, omitting a complete break between the two songs.

In the thirteenth episode of the television show &quot;Top Chef: All-Stars&quot;, &quot;Fit for a King&quot;, the contestants danced at a Junkanoo parade, learned about its history, and competed to make the best dish for the Junkanoo King.

The post-Covid return to Junkanoo was briefly discussed across the two-part episodes 189 and 190 of Nicole Byer and Sasheer Zamata&#x27;s podcast, &quot;Best Friends&quot;, documenting their trip to The Bahamas.

<text>Internet2 is a not-for-profit United States computer networking consortium led by members from the research and education communities, industry, and government. The Internet2 consortium administrative headquarters are located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with offices in Washington, D.C., and Emeryville, California.

As of November 2013, Internet2 has over 500 members including 251 institutions of higher education, 9 partners and 76 members from industry, over 100 research and education networks or connector organizations, and 67 affiliate members.

Internet2 operates the Internet2 Network, an Internet Protocol network using optical fiber that delivers network services for research and education, and provides a secure network testing and research environment. In late 2007, Internet2 began operating its newest dynamic circuit network, the Internet2 DCN, an advanced technology that allows user-based allocation of data circuits over the fiber-optic network.

The Internet2 Network, through its regional network and connector members, connects over 60,000 U.S. educational, research, government and &quot;community anchor&quot; institutions, from primary and secondary schools to community colleges and universities, public libraries and museums to health care organizations.

The Internet2 community develops and deploys network technologies for the future of the Internet. These technologies include large-scale network performance measurement and management tools, secure identity and access management tools and capabilities such as scheduling high-bandwidth, high-performance circuits.

Internet2 members serve on several advisory councils, collaborate in a variety of working groups and special interest groups, gather at spring and fall member meetings, and are encouraged to participate in the strategic planning process.

==History==
As the Internet gained in public recognition and popularity, universities were among the first institutions to outgrow the Internet&#x27;s bandwidth limitations because of the data transfer requirements faced by academic researchers who needed to collaborate with their colleagues. Some universities wanted to support high-performance applications like data mining, medical imaging and particle physics. This resulted in the creation of the very-high-performance Backbone Network Service, or vBNS, developed in 1995 by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and MCI for supercomputers at educational institutions. After the expiration of the NSF agreement, vBNS largely transitioned to providing service to the government. As a result, the research and education community founded Internet2 to serve its networking needs.

The Internet2 Project was originally established by 34 university researchers in 1996 under the auspices of EDUCOM (later EDUCAUSE), and was formally organized as the not-for-profit University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development (UCAID) in 1997. It later changed its name to Internet2. Internet2 is a registered trademark.

The Internet2 community, in partnership with Qwest, built the first Internet2 Network, called Abilene, in 1998 and was a prime investor in the National LambdaRail (NLR) project.
During 2004–2006, Internet2 and NLR held extensive discussions regarding a possible merger. Those talks paused in spring, 2006, resumed in March, 2007, but eventually ceased in the fall of 2007, due to unresolved differences.

In 2006, Internet2 announced a partnership with Level 3 Communications to launch a brand new nationwide network, boosting its capacity from 10 Gbit/s to 100 Gbit/s. In October, 2007, Internet2 officially retired Abilene and now refers to its new, higher capacity network as the Internet2 Network.

In 2010, Internet2 received a $62.5 million American Recovery and Reinvestment Act grant, which allowed Internet2 to put in place a long term IRU for fiber and upgrade the network with its own DWDM optical network system. Ciena later announced that this was the first 100G nationwide optical network. The upgrade to the new optical system was completed in December 2012.

==Objectives==
Internet2 provides the U.S. research and education community with a network that satisfies their bandwidth-intensive requirements. The network itself is a dynamic, robust and cost-effective hybrid optical and packet network. It furnishes a 100 Gbit/s network backbone to more than 210 U.S. educational institutions, 70 corporations and 45 non-profit and government agencies.

The objectives of the Internet2 consortium are:
* Developing and maintaining a leading-edge network.
* Fully exploiting the capabilities of broadband connections through the use of new-generation applications.
* Transferring new network services and applications to all levels of educational use, and eventually the broader Internet community.

The uses of the network span from collaborative applications, distributed research experiments, grid-based data analysis to social networking. Some of these applications are in varying levels of commercialization, such as IPv6, open-source middleware for secure network access, Layer 2 VPNs and dynamic circuit networks.

==Achievements==
These technologies and their organizational counterparts were not only created to make a faster alternative to the Internet. Many fields have been able to use the Abilene network to foster creativity, research, and development in a way that was not previously possible. Users of poor quality libraries can now download not only text but sound recordings, animations, videos, and other resources, which would be otherwise unavailable. Another application is the robust video conferencing now available to Internet2 participants. Neurosurgeons can now video conference with other experts in the field during an operation in a high resolution format with no apparent time lag.

==Application awards==
The &quot;Internet2 Driving Exemplary Applications&quot; (IDEA) award (not to be confused with IDEA awards) was first announced by Internet2 in 2006 as a way of recognizing those who create and use advanced network applications at their best. The judging is conducted by many universities and based upon the following criteria:

* Magnitude of the positive impact of the application for its (current) users
* Technical merit of the application.
* Breadth of impact, as indicated by current user base and likelihood of broader adoption by its full natural community of potential users

Winners of the award are announced each year at the Spring member meeting:
2006,
2007,
2008.

<text>The Cape Henry Memorial commemorates the first landfall at Cape Henry, in Virginia Beach, Virginia, of colonists bound for the Jamestown settlement. After landing on April 26, 1607, they explored the area, named the cape, and set up a cross before proceeding up the James River. A stone cross, set up in 1935 by the Daughters of the American Colonists, stands in the quarter-acre site. The memorial marks the First Landing, the very beginning of what would become British North America and subsequently Anglo Canada and the United States of America.

The Memorial also overlooks the scene of the Battle of the Virginia Capes, in which the French navy prevented the British from reinforcing General Cornwallis, and led to the Franco-American victory at Yorktown. A statue of Admiral Comte de Grasse and a granite memorial honor those who fought in the battle.

Although not memorialized at the park, this was also the location of the earlier smaller naval Battle of Cape Henry in which British and French naval squadrons fought in 1781.

The Cape Henry Memorial is within Joint Expeditionary Base East, but is an isolated unit of Colonial National Historical Park. A national park passport stamp for the Memorial can be obtained at the adjacent Old Cape Henry Light (not formally part of the Memorial).

<doc id="343256" wikidata="Q7262" url="?curid=343256" title="Gengshi Emperor">
<text>The Gengshi Emperor (died November AD 25), born Liu Xuan, was an emperor of the Han dynasty that had been restored following the downfall of Wang Mang&#x27;s short-lived Xin dynasty. He was also known by his courtesy name Shenggong and as the King or Prince of Huaiyang, a posthumous title bestowed upon him by Emperor Guangwu of the Eastern Han. The Gengshi Emperor was viewed as a weak and incompetent ruler, who briefly ruled over an empire willing to let him rule over them, but was unable to keep that empire together. He was eventually deposed by the Red Eyebrows and strangled a few months after his defeat.

Traditionally, historians treated his emperor status ambiguously: sometimes he would be referred to as the Gengshi Emperor, and sometimes by his posthumous title, Prince of Huaiyang. The regime of the Gengshi Emperor is known in historiography as the Xuan Han (), after his personal name Liu Xuan.

== Liu Yan and new emperor ==
Gengshi was a descendant of Emperor Jing of early Western Han dynasty, via the lineage of Liu Mai, Prince Ding of Changsha. His third cousin, Liu Yan, was a prominent general in the rebellions against the reign of Wang Mang in the short-lived Xin dynasty. In the year 22 AD, many rebel leaders were jealous of Liu Yan&#x27;s capabilities despite many of their men admiring Liu Yan and wanting him to become the emperor of a restored Han dynasty. They found Liu Xuan, then another local rebel leader who was claiming the title of General Gengshi () at the time and was considered a weak personality, and requested that he be made emperor. Liu Yan initially opposed this move and instead suggested that Liu Xuan carry the title &quot;King of Han&quot; first (echoing the founder of the Han dynasty, Emperor Gaozu). The other rebel leaders refused, and on 11 March 23, Liu Xuan was proclaimed emperor. Liu Yan became prime minister.

== Infighting, defeat of Wang Mang and the capture of Chang&#x27;an ==
The first major incident involving infighting in the Gengshi Emperor&#x27;s regime happened shortly after the Battle of Kunyang which would lead to the demise of Wang Mang and the Xin dynasty. The Gengshi Emperor was fearful of Liu Yan&#x27;s capabilities and keenly aware that many of Liu Yan&#x27;s followers were angry that Liu Yan was not made emperor. Liu Ji (), was particularly critical of the Gengshi Emperor. The emperor arrested Liu Ji and wanted to execute him, but Liu Yan tried to intercede. The emperor took Liu Yan&#x27;s intercession as a justification to execute Liu Yan as well. Subsequently, ashamed of what he had done, he spared Liu Yan&#x27;s brother Liu Xiu and honoured him by creating him Marquess of Wuxin.

The Gengshi Emperor then commissioned two armies, one led by Wang Kuang, targeting Luoyang, and the other led by Shentu Jian () and Li Song (), targeting Chang&#x27;an directly. All the populace on the way gathered, welcomed, and joined the Han forces. Shentu and Li quickly reached the outskirts of Chang&#x27;an. In response, the young men within Chang&#x27;an also rose up and stormed Weiyang Palace, the main imperial palace. Wang died during the battle at the palace, as did his daughter Princess Huanghuang (the former empress of Han). After Wang died, the crowd fought over the right to have the credit for having killed Wang, and many soldiers died in the ensuing fight. Wang&#x27;s body was cut into pieces, and his head was delivered to the provisional Han capital Wancheng, to be hung on the city wall.

== Attempted consolidation of power ==
After Wang Mang&#x27;s death, the Gengshi Emperor moved his capital from Wancheng to Luoyang. He then issued edicts to the entire empire, promising to allow Xin local officials who submitted to him to keep their posts. For a brief period, nearly the entire empire showed at least nominal submission, even including the powerful Chimei general Fan Chong (), who moved to Luoyang following promises of titles and honours. However, this policy was applied inconsistently, and local governors soon became apprehensive about giving up their power. Fan Chong soon left the capital and returned to his troops. In response, the Gengshi Emperor sent out his generals to try to calm the local governors and populace; these included Liu Xiu, who was sent to pacify the region north of the Yellow River. Soon the people began to see that the powerful officials around the Gengshi Emperor were in fact uneducated men lacking ability to govern; this made them lose confidence in the emperor&#x27;s government.

The Gengshi Emperor&#x27;s government was challenged by a major pretender in winter 23 AD. A fortuneteller in Handan named Wang Lang claimed to be actually named Liu Ziyu () and a son of Emperor Cheng. He claimed that his mother was a singer in Emperor Cheng&#x27;s service, and that Empress Zhao Feiyan had tried to kill him after his birth, but that a substitute child was killed instead. After he spread these rumours, the people of Handan believed that he was a genuine son of Emperor Cheng, and the commanderies north of the Yellow River quickly pledged allegiance to him as emperor. Liu Xiu was forced to withdraw to the northern city of Jicheng (modern Beijing). After some difficulties, however, Liu Xiu was able to unify the northern commanderies still loyal to the Gengshi Emperor and besiege Handan in 24 AD, killing Wang Lang. The Gengshi Emperor put Liu Xiu in charge of the region north of the Yellow Rivera and created him the Prince of Xiao, but Liu Xiu, still aware that he was not truly trusted and angry about his brother&#x27;s death, secretly planned to break away from the Gengshi Emperor&#x27;s rule. He put in place a strategy to strip other imperially-commissioned generals of their powers and troops, and then concentrated the troops under his own command.

The Gengshi Emperor moved his capital again, this time back to the Western Han capital of Chang&#x27;an. The people of Chang&#x27;an had previously been offended by the emperor&#x27;s officials, who did not appreciate their rising up against Wang Mang but rather considered them traitors. Once the Gengshi Emperor was back in the capital, he issued a general pardon, which calmed the situation for a while. At this time, Chang&#x27;an was still largely intact, except for Weiyang Palace which had been destroyed by fire. However, the Gengshi Emperor&#x27;s timidity quickly caused problems. When the imperial officials gathered for an official meeting, the emperor, who had never seen or been trained for such solemn occasions, seemed frightened and uncomfortable. Later, when generals submitted reports to him, he asked questions such as, &quot;How much did you pillage today?&quot; This type of behavior further reduced the people&#x27;s confidence in him.

The emperor entrusted his government to Zhao Meng (), whose daughter he took as an imperial consort. The emperor engaged in frequent drinking and was often unable to receive officials or make important decisions. In the meantime Zhao greatly abused his power. So when an honest official finally revealed Zhao&#x27;s crimes to the Gengshi Emperor, the emperor had him executed. The other powerful officials also greatly abused their power causing great confusion and anger.

In the autumn of 24 AD, the Gengshi Emperor sent his generals Li Bao () and Li Zhong () to try to capture modern Sichuan, then held by the local warlord Gongsun Shu (), but his generals were defeated by Gongsun.

== Defeat by the Chimei (Red Eyebrows) ==
In the winter of 24 AD, there was an ominous development. The Chimei troops stationed at Puyang were weary and wanted to go home. Their leaders felt that if they did so, Chimei forces would scatter and would be unable to be gathered again when needed. So to give them a purpose for remaining together, their leaders decided to announce that they were attacking the imperial capital Chang&#x27;an and, divided the troops into two armies and then headed west.

Liu Xiu, while he had a fairly strong force at his disposal, chose to stand by and wait for the Chimei to destroy the Gengshi Emperor. Liu Xiu used the Henei region (modern northern Henan, north of the Yellow River) as his base of operations because of its strategic location. The Chimei armies met up at Hongnong (弘農, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), and defeated the armies that the emperor sent to stop them.

In 25 AD, the Gengshi Emperor&#x27;s forces led to the death of the former Western Han emperor-designate, Emperor Ruzi (Liu Ying). Two co-conspirators, Fang Wang (), the former strategist for the local warlord Wei Xiao (), and Gong Lin () led a force of several thousand men, which kidnapped Liu Ying and then occupied Linjing (臨涇, in modern Qingyang, Gansu). The Gengshi Emperor sent his prime minister Li Song () with an army to attack them. They wiped out the rebel force, killing Liu Ying in the process.

In the summer of 25, Liu Xiu finally made a formal break with the emperor, after his forces and those of the emperor fought over control of the Henei and Luoyang regions. Liu Xiu declared himself emperor (establishing the regime known later as the Eastern Han Dynasty). His general Deng Yu then captured Shanxi, further reducing the Gengshi Emperor&#x27;s strength. Feeling trapped, a number of the emperor&#x27;s generals conspired to kidnap him and flee back to their home region of Nanyang (in modern Henan). Their plan was uncovered and many were executed. However, one general, Zhang Ang () occupied most of Chang&#x27;an, forcing the Gengshi Emperor to flee, just as the Chimei forces were approaching.

In the meantime, the Chimei decided that they also needed their own emperor. They found three descendants of Liu Zhang, Prince of Chengyang, who had been very popular with the people of his principality (from where many Chimei soldiers came) and who was worshipped as a god after his death. After drawing lots, the youngest of Liu Zhang&#x27;s descendants, the 15-year-old Liu Penzi was chosen and declared emperor. However, the young &quot;emperor&quot; was not given any power. Rather, he was effectively a puppet of the Chimei army.

Generals still loyal to the Gengshi Emperor were eventually able to evict Zhang Ang from the capital, but by that time the situation was desperate. Zhang and his allies surrendered to the Chimei and, working with them, attacked Chang&#x27;an, which fell quickly. The emperor fled, followed by his few remaining loyal followers, including Liu Zhi () the Prince of Dingtao and Liu Gong () the Marquess of Shi (who was Liu Penzi&#x27;s older brother). They were eventually made prisoners by one of the Gengshi Emperor&#x27;s generals, Yan Ben (), who, planned to hold them as bargaining chips. When Liu Xiu heard about the fall of Chang&#x27;an, he created the emperor Prince of Huaiyang, in absentia, and decreed that anyone who harmed the Prince of Huaiyang would be severely punished and that anyone who delivered him to Eastern Han would be rewarded. (This appears to be basically political propaganda on Liu Xiu&#x27;s part.) When news of Chang&#x27;an&#x27;s fall arrived in Luoyang, the city surrendered to Liu Xiu, who entered the city and made it his capital.

In the winter of 25 AD, after being held by Yan Ben for a few months, the Gengshi Emperor realised that his situation was futile and requested Liu Gong to negotiate surrender terms. A promise was made that he would be made the Prince of Changsha. Emperor Penzi&#x27;s general Xie Lu () arrived at Yan&#x27;s camp and escorted the Gengshi Emperor back to Chang&#x27;an to offer his seal (seized from Wang Mang) to Emperor Penzi. However, the Chimei generals, notwithstanding the earlier promise, wanted to execute him. It was only Liu Gong&#x27;s final intercession (in which he threatened to commit suicide at the execution site) that allowed the Gengshi Emperor to be spared and he was created the Prince of Changsha. However, the Gengshi Emperor was forced to stay in Xie Lu&#x27;s headquarters, with Liu Gong protecting him.

The Chimei generals were even less able to govern the capital than the emperor, because they were unable to control their soldiers from pillaging from the people. The people began to yearn for the return of the Gengshi Emperor. Zhang Ang and his allies, afraid of what might happen if the emperor returned to power, persuaded Xie Lu to strangle him. Liu Gong hid his body in a secure location, and years later, after Eastern Han had completely captured the Chang&#x27;an region, Liu Xiu had the Gengshi Emperor&#x27;s body buried with princely honours at Baling (), near the tomb of Emperor Wen.

<doc id="343258" wikidata="Q313852" url="?curid=343258" title="Tzvetan Todorov">
<text>Tzvetan Todorov (; ; ; 1 March 1939 – 7 February 2017) was a Bulgarian-French historian, philosopher, structuralist literary critic, sociologist and essayist. He was the author of many books and essays, which have had a significant influence in anthropology, sociology, semiotics, literary theory, intellectual history and culture theory.

==Early life==
Tzvetan Todorov was born on 1 March 1939 in Sofia, Bulgaria. He earned an M.A. in philology at the University of Sofia in 1963. He enrolled at the University of Paris to do his doctorat de troisième cycle (equivalent to the Ph.D.) in 1966 and his doctorat ès lettres in 1970.

==Career==
Todorov was appointed to his post as a director of research at the French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in 1968. In 1970, he helped to found the journal &quot;Poétique&quot;, of which he remained one of the managing editors until 1979. With structuralist literary critic Gérard Genette, he edited the &quot;Collection Poétique&quot;, the series of books on literary theory published by Éditions de Seuil, until 1987. He was a visiting professor at several universities in the US, including Harvard, Yale, Columbia and the University of California, Berkeley.

Todorov published a total of 39 books, including &quot;The Poetics of Prose&quot; (1971), &quot;Introduction to Poetics&quot; (1981), &quot;The Conquest of America: The Question of the Other&quot; (1982), &quot;Mikhail Bakhtin: The Dialogical Principle&quot; (1984), &quot;Facing the Extreme: Moral Life in the Concentration Camps&quot; (1991), &quot;On Human Diversity&quot; (1993), &quot;A French Tragedy: Scenes of Civil War, Summer 1944&quot; (1994), &quot;Voices from the Gulag: Life and Death in Communist Bulgaria&quot; (1999), &quot;Hope and Memory&quot; (2000), &quot;Imperfect Garden: The Legacy of Humanism&quot; (2002), &quot;In Defence of the Enlightenment&quot; (2009), &quot;Memory as a Remedy for Evil&quot; (2010), &quot;The Totalitarian Experience&quot; (2011), &quot;The Inner Enemies of Democracy&quot; (2014) and &quot;Insoumis&quot; (2015). Todorov&#x27;s historical interests focused on such crucial issues as the conquest of The Americas and the German Nazi concentration camps.

Todorov&#x27;s greatest contribution to literary theory was his definition, in &quot;Introduction à la littérature fantastique&quot; (1970), of the Fantastic, the fantastic uncanny, and the fantastic marvelous. Todorov defines the fantastic as being any event that happens in our world that seems to be supernatural. Upon the occurrence of the event, we must decide if the event was an illusion or whether it is real and has actually taken place. Todorov uses Alvaro from Jacques Cazotte&#x27;s &quot;Le Diable amoureux&quot; as an example of a fantastic event. Alvaro must decide whether the woman he is in love with is truly a woman or if she is the devil.

Upon choosing whether the event was real or imaginary, Todorov says that we enter into the genres of uncanny and marvelous. In the fantastic uncanny, the event that occurs is actually an illusion of some sort. The &quot;laws of reality&quot; remain intact and also provide a rational explanation for the fantastic event. Todorov gives examples of dreams, drugs, illusions of the senses, madness, etc. as things that could explain a fantastic/supernatural event. In the fantastic marvelous, the supernatural event that occurs has actually taken place and therefore the &quot;laws of reality&quot; have to be changed to explain the event. Only if the implied reader cannot opt for one or the other possibility is the text purely fantastic.

Aside from his work in literary theory, Todorov also published studies of philosophy. He wrote &quot;Frail Happiness&quot; about the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He focuses on Rousseau&#x27;s ideas of attaining human happiness and how we can live in &#x27;modern&#x27; times.

In one of his major works, &quot;Facing the Extreme&quot;, Todorov asks whether it is true the Nazi concentration camps and the Soviet Gulags revealed that in extreme situations &quot;all traces of moral life evaporate as men become beasts locked in a merciless struggle for survival&quot; (31–46). That opinion is commonplace of popularized accounts of the camps, and also appears in accounts of survivors themselves. Primo Levi, quoted in Todorov, writes that camp life is a &quot;continuous war of everyone against everyone.&quot; To survive, all dignity and conscience had to be sacrificed and everyone is alone. Reports from gulag survivors are similar. However, in his reading of actual survivor testimonies, Todorov says the picture is not that bleak, that there are many examples of inmates helping each other and showing compassion in human relationships despite the inhumane conditions and terror. Survivors point out that survival always depended on the help of others. He concludes that life in the camps and gulag did not follow the law of the jungle and that the counter-examples are numerous, even in Levi&#x27;s work.

Todorov&#x27;s honors included the CNRS Bronze Medal, the Charles Lévêque Prize of the Académie des sciences morales et politiques and the first Maugean Prize of the Académie française and the Prince of Asturias Award for Social Sciences; he was also an Officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. He was an elected member of both the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He also received the Prince of Asturias Award for Social Sciences. In 2015, he was awarded the [Wayne C. Booth] Award for lifetime achievement in narrative studies by the International Society for the Study of Narrative.

==Personal life and death==
Tzvetan Todorov was born in the family of Todor Borov, a Bulgarian linguist and intellectualist from the early 20th century. His brother is the Bulgarian mathematician and theoretical physicist Ivan Todorov.

Todorov was married twice. His first wife was the scholar Martine van Woerkens, with whom he had a son, Boris. His second was Canadian novelist and essayist Nancy Huston, with whom he had two children, daughter Léa and son Sacha; he and Huston divorced in 2014. He died on 7 February 2017, at the age of 77.

<doc id="343260" wikidata="Q5125081" url="?curid=343260" title="Claim Jumper">
<text>Claim Jumper Restaurant and Saloon is an American restaurant chain with 11 locations as of October 28th, 2023. The company is based in Houston, Texas.

==History==
Restaurateur Craig Nickoloff opened the first Claim Jumper in Los Alamitos, California, on September 27, 1977. The original restaurant had a large menu and an atmosphere inspired by California&#x27;s Gold Rush of 1849.

===Acquisition by Landry’s, Inc.===

In September 2010, the chain filed for bankruptcy and was slated to be auctioned off. In October 2010, Landry&#x27;s, Inc. acquired Claim Jumper, with a bid of $76.6 million. Landry&#x27;s President/CEO Tilman J. Fertitta relocated the company&#x27;s headquarters from Irvine, California, to Landry&#x27;s corporate headquarters in the Uptown area of Houston.

== Franchised locations ==
All locations on the claimjumper.com website are franchised to Kelly Restaurant Group (KRG). , KRG has locations in California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington.

Due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that part of the business was a buffet, KRG closed some of its locations, including the ones in Long Beach, California, Valencia, California,Nashville, Tennessee, and Lynnwood, Washington.

== Non-franchised locations ==
There are three locations that are still owned and operated by Landry&#x27;s. They are located inside the Golden Nuggets of Laughlin, Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada, and Lake Charles, Louisiana. These are also the only Claim Jumpers to be under the Landry&#x27;s Select Club rewards program.

<text>A mug shot or mugshot (an informal term for police photograph or booking photograph) is a photographic portrait of a person from the shoulders up, typically taken after a person is placed under arrest. The primary purpose of the mug shot is to allow law enforcement to have a photographic record of an arrested individual to allow for identification by victims, the public and investigators. However, in the United States, entrepreneurs have recently begun to monetize these public records via the mug shot publishing industry.

Photographing of criminals began in the 1840s only a few years after the invention of photography, but it was not until 1888 that French police officer Alphonse Bertillon standardized the process.

==Etymology==
&quot;Mug&quot; is an English slang term for &quot;face&quot;, dating from the 18th century. Mug shot can more loosely mean any small picture of a face used for any reason.

==Description==
A typical mug shot is two-part, with one side-view photo, and one front-view. The background is usually plain to avoid distraction from the head. Mug shots may be compiled into a mug book in order to determine the identity of a criminal. In high-profile cases, mug shots may also be published in the mass media.

==History==

The earliest photos of prisoners taken for use by law enforcement may have been taken in Belgium in 1843 and 1844. In Australia, police in Sydney were photographing criminals by 1846. In the United Kingdom, police in Liverpool and Birmingham were doing so by 1848. By 1853, the Philadelphia Police Department had a gallery where daguerreotypes of criminals were displayed. and the New York Police Department had the same by 1857.

The Pinkerton National Detective Agency began using these on wanted posters in the United States. By the 1870s the agency had amassed the largest collection of mug shots in the US.

The paired arrangement may have been inspired by the 1865 prison portraits taken by Alexander Gardner of accused conspirators in the Lincoln assassination trial, though Gardner&#x27;s photographs were full-body portraits with only the heads turned for the profile shots.

After the defeat of the Paris Commune in 1871, the Prefecture of Police of Paris hired a photographer, Eugène Appert, to take portraits of convicted prisoners. In 1888, Alphonse Bertillon invented the modern mug shot featuring full face and profile views, standardizing the lighting and angles. This system was soon adopted throughout Europe, and in the United States and Russia.

The arrested person is sometimes required to hold a placard with name, date of birth, booking ID, weight, and other relevant information on it. With digital photography, the digital photograph is linked to a database record concerning the arrest. In some jurisdictions, mug shots are not legally required to be taken, mostly in the cases of high-profile individuals already known to a wider public.

==Use in wanted posters==
Mug shots have often been incorporated into wanted posters, including those for the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.

==Online mug shot publishing==

In the US in the early 21st century an online industry developed around the publication and removal of mug shots from internet websites.

==Prejudicial nature==
The US legal system has long held that mug shots can have a negative effect on juries. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held, &quot;The double-shot picture, with front and profile shots alongside each other, is so familiar, from &#x27;wanted&#x27; posters in the post office, motion pictures and television, that the inference that the person involved has a criminal record, or has at least been in trouble with the police, is natural, perhaps automatic.&quot;

According to the &quot;Handbook of Massachusetts Evidence&quot;, &quot;Because of the risk of prejudice to the defendant inherent in the admission of photographs of the &#x27;mug shot&#x27; variety, judges and prosecutors are required to &#x27;use reasonable means to avoid calling the jury&#x27;s attention to the source of such photographs used to identify the defendant.&#x27;&quot; (p. 617) Elsewhere, it cites a ruling in &quot;Commonwealth v. Martin&quot; that &quot;admission of a defendant&#x27;s mug shot is &#x27;laden for characterizing the defendant as a careerist in crime.

Other states have similar rules. For example, Illinois specifies that all mug shots and booking information should be redacted.

==Mug book==
A mug book is a collection of photographs of criminals, typically in mug shots taken at the time of an arrest. A mug book is used by an eyewitness to a crime, with the assistance of law enforcement, in an effort to identify the perpetrator. Research has shown that grouped photos result in fewer false-positives than individually displaying each photo.

Mug book also has a meaning in genealogy and history, referring to local biographical histories published in the US in the late 19th century.

<text>Paul Louis Courier (; 4 January 177210 April 1825, Paris, France), French Hellenist and political writer.

==Life==
Brought up on his father&#x27;s estate of Méré in Touraine, he conceived a bitter aversion for the nobility, which seemed to strengthen with time. He would never take the name &quot;de Méré&quot;, to which he was entitled, lest he should be thought a nobleman. At the age of fifteen, he was sent to Paris to complete his education; his father&#x27;s teaching had already inspired him with a passionate devotion to Greek literature, and although he showed considerable mathematical ability, he continued to devote all his leisure to the classics. He entered the school of artillery at Châlons, however, and immediately on receiving his appointment as sub-lieutenant in September 1793 he joined the army of the Rhine. He served in various campaigns of the Revolutionary wars, especially in those of Italy in 1798-99 and 1806-7, and in the German campaign of 1809. He became &quot;chef d&#x27;escadron&quot; in 1803.

He made his first appearance as an author in 1802, when he contributed to the Magasin encyclopédique a critique on Johann Schweighäuser&#x27;s edition of Athenaeus. In the following year appeared his &quot;Eloge d&#x27;Hélène&quot;, a free imitation rather than a translation from Isocrates, which he had sketched in 1798. Courier had given up his commission in the autumn of 1808, but the general enthusiasm in Paris over the preparations for the new campaign affected him, and he attached himself to the staff of a general of artillery. But he was horror-struck by the carnage at Wagram (1809), refusing from that time to believe that there was any art in war.

He hastily quit Vienna, escaping the formal charge of desertion because his new appointment had not been confirmed. The savage independence of his nature rendered subordination intolerable to him; he had been three times disgraced for absenting himself without leave, and his superiors resented his satirical humour. After leaving the army he went to Florence, and was fortunate enough to discover in the Laurentian Library a complete manuscript of Longus&#x27;s &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot;, an edition of which he published in 1810. As a consequence of a misadventure—blotting the manuscript—he was involved in a quarrel with the librarian and was compelled by the government to leave Tuscany. He retired to his estate at Véretz (Indre-et-Loire), but frequently visited Paris, and divided his attention between literature and his farm.

After the second restoration of the Bourbons the career of Courier as political pamphleteer began. He had before this time waged war against local wrongs in his own district and had been the adviser and helpful friend of his neighbours. He now made himself by his letters and pamphlets one of the most dreaded opponents of the government of the Restoration. The first of these was his &quot;Petition aux deux chambres&quot; (1816), exposing the sufferings of the peasantry under the royalist reaction. In 1817 he was a candidate for a vacant seat in the Institute; and failing, he took his revenge by publishing a bitter &quot;Lettre à Messieurs de l&#x27;Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres&quot; (1819). This was followed (1819–1820) by a series of political letters of extraordinary power published in &quot;Le Censeur Européen&quot;. He advocated a liberal monarchy, at the head of which he doubtless wished to see Louis Philippe.

The proposal, in 1821, to purchase the estate of Chambord for the duke of Bordeaux called forth from Courier the Simple &quot;Discours de Paul Louis, vigneron de la Chavonnière&quot;, one of his best pieces. For this he was tried and condemned to suffer a short imprisonment and to pay a fine. Before he went to prison he published a &quot;compte rendu&quot; of his trial, which had a still larger circulation than the &quot;Discours&quot; itself. In 1823 appeared the &quot;Livret de Paul Louis&quot;, the &quot;Gazette de village&quot;, followed in 1824 by his famous &quot;Pamphlet des pamphlets&quot;, called by his biographer, Armand Carrel, his swan-song.

Courier published in 1807 his translation from Xenophon, &quot;Du commandement de la cavalerie et de l&#x27;equitation&quot;, and had a share in editing the &quot;Collections des romans grecs&quot;. He also projected a translation of Herodotus, and published a specimen, in which he attempted to imitate archaic French; but he did not live to carry out this plan. On April 10, 1825, on a Sunday afternoon, Courier was found shot in a wood near his house. The murderers, who were servants of his own, remained undiscovered for five years. There were many stories in the village of Veretz that they had been fired for their sexual liaisons with his wife, who left him for Paris shortly afterwards. He is buried in Veretz cemetery, close to his son and the grave of the later poet Eugène Bizeau. The anarchist poet&#x27;s grandmother was mentioned in Courier&#x27;s own work. There were, however, rumours of a political murder by the authorities which remained current for many years.

The writings of Courier, dealing with the facts and events of his own time, are valuable sources of information as to the condition of France before, during, and after the Revolution. Sainte-Beuve finds in Courier&#x27;s own words, &quot;peu de matière et beaucoup d&#x27;art&quot;, the secret and device of his talent, which gives his writings a value independent of the somewhat ephemeral subject-matter.

A &quot;Collection complète des pamphlets politiques et opuscules litteraires de P. L. Courier&quot; appeared in 1826. See editions of his Œuvres (1848), with an admirable biography by Armand Carrel, which is reproduced in a later edition, with a supplementary criticism by Francisque Sarcey (1876–1877); also three notices by Sainte-Beuve in the &quot;Causeries du lundi&quot; and the &quot;Nouveaux Lundis&quot;.

In the centre of Veretz there is a stele, raised in honour of Courier 50 years after his murder, and the opening was observed by many eminent writers of the time.

<text>The Hartley oscillator is an electronic oscillator circuit in which the oscillation frequency is determined by a tuned circuit consisting of capacitors and inductors, that is, an LC oscillator. The circuit was invented in 1915 by American engineer Ralph Hartley. The distinguishing feature of the Hartley oscillator is that the tuned circuit consists of a single capacitor in parallel with two inductors in series (or a single tapped inductor), and the feedback signal needed for oscillation is taken from the center connection of the two inductors.

== History ==

The Hartley oscillator was invented by Hartley while he was working for the Research Laboratory of the Western Electric Company. Hartley invented and patented the design in 1915 while overseeing Bell System&#x27;s transatlantic radiotelephone tests; it was awarded patent number 1,356,763 on October 26, 1920. 
In 1946 Hartley was awarded the Institute of Radio Engineers Medal of Honor &quot;for his early work on oscillating circuits employing triode tubes&quot; and for his work in information theory (which largely paralleled Harry Nyquist) about &quot;the fundamental relationship between the total amount of information which may be transmitted over a transmission system of limited band-width and the time required.&quot;

==Operation==

The Hartley oscillator is distinguished by a tank circuit consisting of two series-connected coils (or, often, a tapped coil) in parallel with a capacitor, with an amplifier between the relatively high impedance across the entire LC tank and the relatively low voltage/high current point between the coils. The original 1915 version used a triode as the amplifying device in common cathode configuration, with three batteries, and separate adjustable coils. The simplified common-drain JFET circuit diagram uses an LC tank (here the single winding is tapped) and a single battery, but is otherwise essentially the same as the patent drawing. The circuit illustrates the Hartley oscillator operation:

* the output from the JFET&#x27;s &quot;source&quot; (&quot;emitter&quot;, if a BJT had been used; &quot;cathode&quot; for a triode) has the same phase as the signal at its gate (or base) and roughly the same voltage as its input (which is the voltage across the entire tank circuit), but the &quot;current is amplified&quot;, i.e. it is acting as a current buffer or voltage-controlled voltage-source.
* this low impedance output is then fed into the coil tapping, effectively into an autotransformer that will step up the voltage, requiring a relatively high current (compared with that available at the top of the coil).
* with the capacitor-coil resonance, all frequencies other than the tuned frequency will tend to be absorbed (the tank will appear as nearly 0Ω near DC due to the inductor&#x27;s low reactance at low frequencies, and low again at very high frequencies due to the capacitor); they will also shift the phase of the feedback from the 0° needed for oscillation at all but the tuned frequency.

Variations on the simple circuit often include ways to automatically reduce the amplifier gain to maintain a constant output voltage at a level below overload; the simple circuit above will limit the output voltage due to the gate conducting on positive peaks, effectively damping oscillations but not before significant distortion (spurious harmonics) may result. Changing the tapped coil to two separate coils, as in the original patent schematic, still results in a working oscillator but now that the two coils are not magnetically coupled the inductance, and so frequency, calculation has to be modified (see below), and the explanation of the voltage increase mechanism is more complicated than the autotransformer scenario.

A quite different implementation using a tapped coil in an LC tank feedback arrangement is to employ a common-grid (or common-gate or common-base) amplifier stage, which is still non-inverting but provides &quot;voltage gain&quot; instead of &quot;current gain&quot;; the coil tapping is still connected to the cathode (or source or emitter), but this is now the (low impedance) input to the amplifier; the split tank circuit is now dropping the impedance from the relatively high output impedance of the plate (or drain or collector).
The Hartley oscillator is the dual of the Colpitts oscillator, which uses two capacitors rather than two inductors for its voltage divider. Although there is no requirement for mutual coupling between the two coil segments, the circuit is usually implemented using a tapped coil, with the feedback taken from the tap, as shown here. The optimal tapping point (or ratio of coil inductances) depends on the amplifying device used, which may be a bipolar junction transistor, FET, triode, or amplifier of almost any type (non-inverting in this case, although variations of the circuit with an earthed centre-point and feedback from an inverting amplifier or the collector/drain of a transistor are also common), but a junction FET (shown) or triode is often employed as a good degree of amplitude stability (and thus distortion reduction) can be achieved with a simple grid leak resistor-capacitor combination in series with the gate or grid (see the Scott circuit below) thanks to diode conduction on signal peaks building up enough negative bias to limit amplification.

The frequency of oscillation is approximately the resonant frequency of the tank circuit. If the capacitance of the tank capacitor is &quot;C&quot; and the total inductance of the tapped coil is &quot;L&quot; then
:formula_1
If two &quot;uncoupled&quot; coils of inductance &quot;L&quot;1 and &quot;L&quot;2 are used then 
:formula_2
However, if the two coils are magnetically coupled the total inductance will be greater because of mutual inductance &quot;k&quot;
:formula_3
The actual oscillation frequency will be slightly lower than given above, because of parasitic capacitance in the coil and loading by the transistor.

The Hartley oscillator has several advantages:

* The frequency may be adjusted using a single variable capacitor, one side of which can be earthed
* The output amplitude remains constant over the frequency range
* Either a tapped coil or two fixed inductors are needed, and very few other components
* Easy to create an accurate fixed-frequency crystal oscillator variation by replacing the capacitor with a (parallel-resonant) quartz crystal or replacing the top half of the tank circuit with a crystal and grid-leak resistor (as in the Tri-tet oscillator).

The output is harmonic-rich if taken from the amplifier and not directly from the LC circuit (unless amplitude-stabilisation circuitry is employed). This may be considered an advantage or a disadvantage.

===Practical example===
The schematic shows an example with component values. Instead of field-effect transistors, other active components such as bipolar junction transistors or vacuum tubes, capable of producing gain at the desired frequency, could be used.

The common drain amplifier has a high input impedance and a low output impedance. Therefore the amplifier input is connected to the high impedance top of the LC circuit C1, L1, L2 and the amplifier output is connected to the low impedance tap of the LC circuit. The grid leak C2 and R1 sets the operating point automatically through grid leak bias. A smaller value of C2 gives less harmonic distortion, but requires a larger load resistor. The load resistor RL is part of the simulation, not part of the circuit.

<text>Longus, sometimes Longos (), was the author of an ancient Greek novel or romance, &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot;. Nothing is known of his life; it is assumed that he lived on the isle of Lesbos (setting for &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot;) during the 2nd century AD.

It has been suggested that the name Longus is merely a misinterpretation of the first word of &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot;&#x27;s title &quot;Λεσβιακῶν ἐρωτικῶν λόγοι&quot; (&quot;story of a Lesbian romance&quot;, &quot;Lesbian&quot; for &quot;from Lesbos island&quot;) in the Florentine manuscript; EE Seiler observes that the best manuscript begins and ends with &quot;λόγου&quot; (not &quot;λόγγου&quot;) &quot;ποιμενικῶν&quot;. 

If his name was really Longus, he was possibly a freedman of some Roman family which bore that name as a cognomen.

<text>The Jefferson Highway was an automobile highway stretching through the central United States from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Winnipeg, Manitoba in Canada. The Jefferson Highway was replaced with the new numbered US Highway system in the late 1920s. Portions of the highway are still named Jefferson Highway, including the portions that run through Jefferson Parish, Louisiana; East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana; Lee&#x27;s Summit, Missouri; Osseo, Minnesota; and Wadena, Minnesota.

It was built in the 1910s as part of the National Auto Trail system.

Named for President Thomas Jefferson, inspired by the east–west Lincoln Highway, it was nicknamed the &quot;Palm to Pine Highway&quot;, for the varying types of trees found at either end.

==History==

The southern terminus of the Jefferson Highway was in New Orleans, Louisiana at the intersection of St. Charles Avenue and Common Street. It is marked by a six-foot tall Georgia granite obelisk donated by the New Orleans chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The obelisk was installed on April 15, 1918, and it was formally dedicated the following January.

The original route (finalized in December 1916) on today&#x27;s roads is as follows:
*Louisiana
**New Orleans to Kenner:
***From the southern terminus at Common Street, the Jefferson Highway followed St. Charles Avenue, Canal Street, City Park Avenue, and Metairie Road into Jefferson Parish.
***Leaving New Orleans, the Jefferson Highway followed Metairie Road, Shrewsbury Road, and Jefferson Highway to Kenner. This route is covered by LA 611-9, LA 3261, LA 611-3, US 90, and LA 48. (The section of road that is called &quot;Jefferson Highway&quot; between Shrewsbury Road and the New Orleans city limits at South Claiborne Avenue was not part of the original route, as it did not exist until 1928.)
**Kenner to Geismar:
***From Kenner to Geismar, the Jefferson Highway followed alongside the east bank levee of the Mississippi River which, due to various sections of levee being relocated during the 1920s and 1930s, is often a significant distance removed from the modern River Road. Also, a two-mile section between Norco and Montz was eliminated in 1935 when the parallel U.S. 61 Bonnet Carré Spillway Bridge carrying Airline Highway across the Bonnet Carré Spillway was opened. However, the route is approximated by LA 48 to Norco, River Road to Montz, LA 628 to LaPlace, LA 44 to Burnside, LA 942 to Darrow, and LA 75 to Geismar. (Portions of the River Road at Reserve and Gramercy are still known as Jefferson Highway.)
**Geismar to Baton Rouge:
***From Geismar to Baton Rouge, the route followed LA 73 and is still known as (Old) Jefferson Highway.
***The original routing through downtown Baton Rouge followed Claycut Road, LA 427 (South Acadian Thruway), LA 73 (Government Street), 19th Street, and North Street to the former Mississippi River ferry landing to Port Allen.
**Port Allen to Alexandria:
***LA 987 (Court Street), North Jefferson Avenue, and LA 986 (Rosedale Road) through Port Allen.
***LA 76 to Rosedale.
***LA 77 to Ravenswood.
***LA 10 to Red Cross.
***The Jefferson Highway crossed the Atchafalaya River by ferry to Melville and continued on LA 10 to Lebeau.
***US 71 to Bunkie.
***LA 1177 and US 71 to Cheneyville. (There is a short section of old Jefferson Highway off US 71 in Cheneyville.)
***US 71 and LA 456 to Lamourie. (Part of LA 456 at Lecompte is known as Jefferson Highway.)
***LA 470, US 71-167 (briefly), and Old Baton Rouge Highway to Alexandria.
**Alexandria to Pineville:
***US 71 (Jefferson Hwy. or MacArthur Dr.), Lee Street, Main Street, and Murray Street through Alexandria.
***The Jefferson Highway crossed the Red River on a now-demolished bridge at the foot of Murray Street into Pineville.
***US 165-BUS (Main Street and Military Highway), LA 180 (Jefferson Highway), and US 71 (Shreveport Highway) through Pineville.
**Pineville to Nachitoches:
***US 71 and LA 3225 (Shreveport Highway). (Stainaker Street is a small, severed portion of the original route near the junction of US 71 and LA 3225.)
***US 71, LA 492, and LA 8 to Colfax. (Numerous curves were straightened along this route sometime after 1956 and exist as small pieces of road such as: Old US 71, Walker Gravel Pit Road, and Parker Street west of LA 3225; Old US 71 and Rocky Lane at Rock Hill; and Old Jefferson Highway just south of Colfax.)
***LA 158 and US 71 to just south of Montgomery, following Old Jefferson Highway into town and leaving via North Jefferson Highway.
***US 71 and LA 1225 to Clarence.
***LA 6 to Natchitoches.
**Natchitoches to Shreveport:
***LA 6 (via LA 3278) to Robeline. (Several curves have been straightened between I-49 and Robeline, two of which exist as Old LA 6 and Johnny Floyd Road.)
***LA 120 to Belmont.
***LA 175 (via Old Jefferson Road north of Pelican) to Mansfield, following Old Jefferson Highway into town.
***US 171 to Shreveport, via Old Jefferson Road through Stonewall and Old Mansfield Road through Keithville.
**Shreveport to Texas state line:
***US 171, Mansfield Road, and US 79-US 80 (Greenwood Road) to I-20 at Flournoy.
***Westbrook Road, LA 511 (West 70th Street), US 79-80 (Greenwood Road) to Greenwood.
***US 80 (Texas Avenue) across the state line toward Waskom, Texas.

When Louisiana numbered its state highways in 1921, the entire length of the Jefferson Highway through Louisiana was designated as State Route 1. This route was in effect until the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering. When the U.S. Highway System was designated in 1926, the Jefferson Highway was split into four U.S. Highways in Louisiana: US 61 from New Orleans to Baton Rouge (before it was rerouted onto the Airline Highway), US 71 from Baton Rouge to Clarence, US 171 from Mansfield to Shreveport, and US 80 from Shreveport west into Texas. The section between Natchitoches and Mansfield was not included in the U.S. Highway System.

<text>A regenerative circuit is an amplifier circuit that employs positive feedback (also known as regeneration or reaction). Some of the output of the amplifying device is applied back to its input to add to the input signal, increasing the amplification. One example is the Schmitt trigger (which is also known as a regenerative comparator), but the most common use of the term is in RF amplifiers, and especially regenerative receivers, to greatly increase the gain of a single amplifier stage.

The regenerative receiver was invented in 1912 and patented in 1914 by American electrical engineer Edwin Armstrong when he was an undergraduate at Columbia University. It was widely used between 1915 and World War II. Advantages of regenerative receivers include increased sensitivity with modest hardware requirements, and increased selectivity because the Q of the tuned circuit will be increased when the amplifying vacuum tube or transistor has its feedback loop around the tuned circuit (via a &quot;tickler&quot; winding or a tapping on the coil) because it introduces some negative resistance.

Due partly to its tendency to radiate interference when oscillating, by the 1930s the regenerative receiver was largely superseded by other TRF receiver designs (for example &quot;reflex&quot; receivers) and especially by another Armstrong invention - superheterodyne receivers and is largely considered obsolete. Regeneration (now called positive feedback) is still widely used in other areas of electronics, such as in oscillators, active filters, and bootstrapped amplifiers.

A receiver circuit that used larger amounts of regeneration in a more complicated way to achieve even higher amplification, the superregenerative receiver, was also invented by Armstrong in 1922. It was never widely used in general commercial receivers, but due to its small parts count it was used in specialized applications. One widespread use during WWII was IFF transceivers, where single tuned circuit completed the entire electronics system. It is still used in a few specialized low data rate applications, such as garage door openers, wireless networking devices, walkie-talkies and toys.

==Regenerative receiver==
The gain of any amplifying device, such as a vacuum tube, transistor, or op amp, can be increased by feeding some of the energy from its output back into its input in phase with the original input signal. This is called positive feedback or &quot;regeneration&quot;. Because of the large amplification possible with regeneration, regenerative receivers often use only a single amplifying element (tube or transistor). In a regenerative receiver the output of the tube or transistor is connected back to its own input through a tuned circuit (LC circuit). The tuned circuit allows positive feedback only at its resonant frequency. In regenerative receivers using only one active device, the same tuned circuit is coupled to the antenna and also serves to select the radio frequency to be received, usually by means of variable capacitance. In the regenerative circuit discussed here, the active device also functions as a detector; this circuit is also known as a &quot;regenerative detector&quot;. A regeneration control is usually provided for adjusting the amount of feedback (the loop gain). It is desirable for the circuit design to provide regeneration control that can gradually increase feedback to the point of oscillation and that provides control of the oscillation from small to larger amplitude and back to no oscillation without jumps of amplitude or hysteresis in control.

Two important attributes of a radio receiver are &quot;sensitivity&quot; and &quot;selectivity&quot;. The regenerative detector provides sensitivity and selectivity due to voltage amplification and the characteristics of a resonant circuit consisting of inductance and capacitance. The regenerative voltage amplification formula_1 is formula_2 where formula_3 is the non-regenerative amplification and formula_4 is the portion of the output signal fed back to the L2 C2 circuit. As formula_5 becomes smaller the amplification increases. The formula_6 of the tuned circuit (L2 C2) without regeneration is formula_7 where formula_8 is the reactance of the coil and formula_9 represents the total dissipative loss of the tuned circuit. The positive feedback compensates the energy loss caused by formula_9, so it may be viewed as introducing a negative resistance formula_11 to the tuned circuit. The formula_6 of the tuned circuit with regeneration is formula_13. The regeneration increases the formula_6. Oscillation begins when formula_15.

Regeneration can increase the detection gain of a detector by a factor of 1,700 or more. This is quite an improvement, especially for the low-gain vacuum tubes of the 1920s and early 1930s. The type 36 screen-grid tube (obsolete since the mid-1930s) had a non-regenerative detection gain (audio frequency plate voltage divided by radio frequency input voltage) of only 9.2 at 7.2 MHz, but in a regenerative detector, had detection gain as high as 7,900 at critical regeneration (non-oscillating) and as high as 15,800 with regeneration just above critical. The &quot;... non-oscillating regenerative amplification is limited by the stability of the circuit elements, tube [or device] characteristics and [stability of] supply voltages which determine the maximum value of regeneration obtainable without self-oscillation&quot;. Intrinsically, there is little or no difference in the gain and stability available from vacuum tubes, JFETs, MOSFETs or bipolar junction transistors (BJTs).

A major improvement in stability and a small improvement in available gain for reception of CW radiotelegraphy is provided by the use of a separate oscillator, known as a &quot;heterodyne oscillator&quot; or &quot;beat oscillator&quot;. Providing the oscillation separately from the detector allows the regenerative detector to be set for maximum gain and selectivity - which is always in the non-oscillating condition. Interaction between the detector and the beat oscillator can be minimized by operating the beat oscillator at half of the receiver operating frequency, using the second harmonic of the beat oscillator in the detector.

===AM reception===
For AM reception, the gain of the loop is adjusted so it is just below the level required for oscillation (a loop gain of just less than one). The result of this is to greatly increase the gain of the amplifier at the bandpass frequency (resonant frequency), while not increasing it at other frequencies. So the incoming radio signal is amplified by a large factor, 103 - 105, increasing the receiver&#x27;s sensitivity to weak signals. The high gain also has the effect of reducing the circuit&#x27;s bandwidth (increasing the Q) by an equal factor, increasing the selectivity of the receiver.

===CW reception (autodyne mode)===

For the reception of CW radiotelegraphy (Morse code), the feedback is increased just to the point of oscillation. The tuned circuit is adjusted to provide typically 400 to 1000 Hertz difference between the receiver oscillation frequency and the desired transmitting station&#x27;s signal frequency. The two frequencies &quot;beat&quot; in the nonlinear amplifier, generating heterodyne or &quot;beat&quot; frequencies. The difference frequency, typically 400 to 1000 Hertz, is in the audio range; so it is heard as a tone in the receiver&#x27;s speaker whenever the station&#x27;s signal is present.

Demodulation of a signal in this manner, by use of a single amplifying device as oscillator and mixer simultaneously, is known as &quot;autodyne&quot; reception. The term &quot;autodyne&quot; predates multigrid tubes and is not applied to use of tubes specifically designed for frequency conversion.

===SSB reception===
For the reception of single-sideband (SSB) signals, the circuit is also adjusted to oscillate as in CW reception. The tuning is adjusted until the demodulated voice is intelligible.

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===
Regenerative receivers require fewer components than other types of receiver circuit, such as the TRF and superheterodyne. The circuit&#x27;s advantage was that it got much more amplification (gain) out of the expensive vacuum tubes, thus reducing the number of tubes required and therefore the cost of a receiver. Early vacuum tubes had low gain and tended to oscillate at radio frequencies (RF). TRF receivers often required 5 or 6 tubes; each stage requiring tuning and neutralization, making the receiver cumbersome, power hungry, and hard to adjust. A regenerative receiver, by contrast, could often provide adequate reception with the use of only one tube. In the 1930s the regenerative receiver was replaced by the superheterodyne circuit in commercial receivers due to the superheterodyne&#x27;s superior performance and the falling cost of tubes. Since the advent of the transistor in 1946, the low cost of active devices has removed most of the advantage of the circuit. However, in recent years the regenerative circuit has seen a modest comeback in receivers for low cost digital radio applications such as garage door openers, keyless locks, RFID readers and some cell phone receivers.

A disadvantage of this receiver, especially in designs that couple the detector tuned circuit to the antenna, is that the regeneration (feedback) level must be adjusted when the receiver is tuned to a different frequency. The antenna impedance varies with frequency, changing the loading of the input tuned circuit by the antenna, requiring the regeneration to be adjusted. In addition, the Q of the detector tuned circuit components vary with frequency, requiring adjustment of the regeneration control.

A disadvantage of the single active device regenerative detector in autodyne operation is that the local oscillation causes the operating point to move significantly away from the ideal operating point, resulting in the detection gain being reduced.

Another drawback is that when the circuit is adjusted to oscillate it can radiate a signal from its antenna, so it can cause interference to other nearby receivers. Adding an RF amplifier stage between the antenna and the regenerative detector can reduce unwanted radiation, but would add expense and complexity.

Other shortcomings of regenerative receivers are the sensitive and unstable tuning. These problems have the same cause: a regenerative receiver&#x27;s gain is greatest when it operates on the verge of oscillation, and in that condition, the circuit behaves chaotically. Simple regenerative receivers electrically couple the antenna to the detector tuned circuit, resulting in the electrical characteristics of the antenna influencing the resonant frequency of the detector tuned circuit. Any movement of the antenna or large objects near the antenna can change the tuning of the detector.

===History===

The inventor of FM radio, Edwin Armstrong, filed US patent 1113149 in 1913 about regenerative circuit while he was a junior in college. He patented the superregenerative circuit in 1922, and the superheterodyne receiver in 1918.

Lee De Forest filed US patent 1170881 in 1914 that became the cause of a contentious lawsuit with Armstrong, whose patent for the regenerative circuit had been issued in 1914. The lawsuit lasted until 1934, winding its way through the appeals process and ending up at the Supreme Court. Armstrong won the first case, lost the second, stalemated at the third, and then lost the final round at the Supreme Court.

At the time the regenerative receiver was introduced, vacuum tubes were expensive and consumed much power, with the added expense and encumbrance of heavy batteries. So this design, getting most gain out of one tube, filled the needs of the growing radio community and immediately thrived. Although the superheterodyne receiver is the most common receiver in use today, the regenerative radio made the most out of very few parts.

In World War II the regenerative circuit was used in some military equipment. An example is the German field radio &quot;Torn.E.b&quot;. Regenerative receivers needed far fewer tubes and less power consumption for nearly equivalent performance.

A related circuit, the &quot;superregenerative detector&quot;, found several highly important military uses in World War II in Friend or Foe identification equipment and in the top-secret proximity fuze. An example here is the miniature RK61 thyratron marketed in 1938, which was designed specifically to operate like a vacuum triode below its ignition voltage, allowing it to amplify analog signals as a self-quenching superregenerative detector in radio control receivers, and was the major technical development which led to the wartime development of radio-controlled weapons and the parallel development of radio controlled modelling as a hobby.

In the 1930s, the superheterodyne design began to gradually supplant the regenerative receiver, as tubes became far less expensive. In Germany the design was still used in the millions of mass-produced German &quot;peoples receivers&quot; (Volksempfänger) and &quot;German small receivers&quot; (DKE, Deutscher Kleinempfänger). Even after WWII, the regenerative design was still present in early after-war German minimal designs along the lines of the &quot;peoples receivers&quot; and &quot;small receivers&quot;, dictated by lack of materials. Frequently German military tubes like the &quot;RV12P2000&quot; were employed in such designs. There were even superheterodyne designs, which used the regenerative receiver as a combined IF and demodulator with fixed regeneration. The superregenerative design was also present in early FM broadcast receivers around 1950. Later it was almost completely phased out of mass production, remaining only in hobby kits, and some special applications, like gate openers.

==Superregenerative receiver==
The superregenerative receiver uses a second lower-frequency oscillation (within the same stage or by using a second oscillator stage) to provide single-device circuit gains of around one million. This second oscillation periodically interrupts or &quot;quenches&quot; the main RF oscillation. Ultrasonic quench rates between 30 and 100 kHz are typical. After each quenching, RF oscillation grows exponentially, starting from the tiny energy picked up by the antenna plus circuit noise. The amplitude reached at the end of the quench cycle (linear mode) or the time taken to reach limiting amplitude (log mode) depends on the strength of the received signal from which exponential growth started. A low-pass filter in the audio amplifier filters the quench and RF frequencies from the output, leaving the AM modulation. This provides a crude but very effective automatic gain control (AGC).

===Advantages and applications===
Superregenerative detectors work well for AM and can also be used for wide-band signals such as FM, where they perform &quot;slope detection&quot;. Regenerative detectors work well for narrow-band signals, especially for CW and SSB which need a heterodyne oscillator or BFO. A superregenerative detector does not have a usable heterodyne oscillator – even though the superregen always self-oscillates, so CW (Morse code)and SSB (single side band) signals can&#x27;t be received properly.

Superregeneration is most valuable above 27 MHz, and for signals where broad tuning is desirable. The superregen uses many fewer components for nearly the same sensitivity as more complex designs. It is easily possible to build superregen receivers which operate at microwatt power levels, in the 30 to 6,000 MHz range. It removes the need for the operator to manually adjust regeneration level to just below the point of oscillation - the circuit automatically is taken out of oscillation periodically, but with the disadvantage that small amounts of interference may be a problem for others. These are ideal for remote-sensing applications or where long battery life is important. For many years, superregenerative circuits have been used for commercial products such as garage-door openers, radar detectors, microwatt RF data links, and very low cost walkie-talkies.

Because the superregenerative detectors tend to receive the strongest signal and ignore other signals in the nearby spectrum, the superregen works best with bands that are relatively free of interfering signals. Due to Nyquist&#x27;s theorem, its quenching frequency must be at least twice the signal bandwidth. But quenching with overtones acts further as a heterodyne receiver mixing additional unneeded signals from those bands into the working frequency. Thus the overall bandwidth of superregenerator cannot be less than 4 times that of the quench frequency, assuming the quenching oscillator produces an ideal sine wave.

<text>Korea(n) Bay, sometimes West Korea(n) Bay (; ; or ), is a bight and the northern extension of the Yellow Sea, between the southeastern coastline of China&#x27;s Liaoning Province and the western coastline of North Korea&#x27;s North Pyongan, South Pyongan and South Hwanghae provinces. It is separated from the Bohai Sea by the Liaodong Peninsula, with Dalian&#x27;s Lüshunkou District marking its western end, and westernmost tip of North Korea&#x27;s Ryongyon County as its eastern end.

The Yalu (Amnok) River, which marks the western two-thirds of the China–North Korea border, empties into the Korea Bay between Dandong (China) and Sinŭiju (North Korea). The Chongchon River and Taedong River also drains into the Korea Bay at Sinanju and Nampo, respectively.

<text>Emperor Guangwu of Han (; 15 January 5 BC29 March AD 57), born Liu Xiu (), courtesy name Wenshu (), was a Chinese monarch. He served as an emperor of the Han dynasty by restoring the dynasty in AD 25, thus founding the Eastern Han dynasty. He ruled over parts of China at first since his dynasty was formed through rebellion against the short-lived Xin dynasty, and through suppression and conquest of regional warlords, the whole of China proper was consolidated by the time of his death in AD 57. During his reign, Taoism was made the official religion of China, and the Chinese folk religion began to decline.

Liu Xiu was one of the many descendants of the Han imperial family. Following the usurpation of the Han throne by Wang Mang and the ensuing civil war during the disintegration of Wang&#x27;s Xin dynasty, he emerged as one of several descendants of the fallen dynasty claiming the imperial throne. After assembling forces and proclaiming himself emperor in the face of competitors, he was able to defeat his rivals, destroy the peasant army of the Chimei, known for their disorganization and marauding, and finally reunify China in AD 36.

He established his capital in Luoyang, east of the former capital Chang&#x27;an (modern Xi&#x27;an), ushering in the Eastern Han (Later Han) dynasty. He implemented some reforms (notably land reform, albeit not very successfully) aimed at correcting some of the structural imbalances responsible for the downfall of the Former/Western Han. His reforms gave a new 200-year lease of life to the Han dynasty.

Emperor Guangwu&#x27;s campaigns featured many able generals, but curiously, he lacked major strategists. That may very well be because he himself appeared to be a brilliant strategist; he often instructed his generals on strategy from afar, and his predictions generally would be accurate. This was often emulated by later emperors who fancied themselves great strategists but who actually lacked Emperor Guangwu&#x27;s brilliance—usually to disastrous results.

Also unique among emperors in Chinese history was Emperor Guangwu&#x27;s combination of decisiveness and mercy. He often sought out peaceful means rather than bellicose means of putting areas under his control. He was, in particular, one rare example of a founding emperor of a dynasty who did not kill, out of jealousy or paranoia, any of the generals or officials who contributed to his victories after his rule was secure.

==Family background==
Liu Xiu was the sixth generation descendant of Emperor Jing of the Western Han dynasty. He was the son of Liu Qin (劉欽), magistrate (縣令 i.e., head official) of Nandun County (南頓縣), near present-day Xiangcheng, Henan. Liu Qin was the son of Liu Hui (劉回), vice governor in charge of military affairs for Julu Commandery (鉅鹿都尉). Liu Hui was the son of Liu Wai (劉外), governor of Yulin Commandery (鬱林太守). Liu Wai was the son of Liu Mai (劉買), known posthumously as Marquess Jie of Chongling (舂陵節侯). Liu Mai was the son of Liu Fa (劉發), known posthumously as Prince Ding of Changsha (長沙定王). The Prince of Changsha was a brother of Emperor Wu, a famous emperor of the Former Han and the son of Emperor Jing and Lady Tang. As a descendant of Liu Fa, this also made Liu Xiu third cousin to the Gengshi Emperor.

Liu Qin was married to the daughter of one Fan Chong (樊重), and he and his wife had three sons – Liu Yan, Liu Zhong (劉仲), and Liu Xiu. Liu Qin died early, and the brothers were raised by their uncle Liu Liang (劉良). Liu Yan was ambitious, and ever since Wang Mang usurped the Han throne in AD 8 and established the Xin dynasty, Liu Yan was constantly considering starting a rebellion to restore the Han dynasty. Liu Xiu, in contrast, was a careful man who was content to be a farmer. However, his brother-in-law Deng Chen (鄧晨), the husband of his sister Liu Yuan (劉元), who believed in a prophecy that a man named Liu Xiu would be emperor, constantly encouraged him to be more ambitious.

==Joining Lulin rebellion against Wang Mang==
In AD 22, with virtually the entire empire rebelling against Wang Mang&#x27;s incompetent rule, Liu Yan prepared his rebellion. He planned, along with his brothers, and Li Tong (李通) and his cousin Li Yi (李軼), to kidnap the governor for Nanyang Commandery (roughly modern Nanyang, Henan) and call for the people of the commandery to join him. When the young men of their home territory of Chongling heard about the rebellion, they were all scared to join—until they saw that Liu Xiu was part of the rebellion as well, figuring that if even a careful man like Liu Xiu was part of the rebellion, the rebellion was carefully planned.

However, the news of the plan leaked out, and Li Tong and Li Yi barely escaped with their lives (but their family was slaughtered). Liu Yan changed his plan and persuaded two branches of the Lulin – the Xinshi Force (新市兵) and Pinglin Force (平林兵) to join forces with him, and they had some military success. Encouraged, Liu Yan made a frontal assault against Wancheng (宛城), the capital of Nanyang Commandery—and suffered a major loss. Liu Yan and Liu Xiu, along with their sister Liu Boji (劉伯姬), survived, but their brother Liu Zhong and sister Liu Yuan died in the battle. Liu Yan&#x27;s allies, seeing his defeat, considered leaving him, but Liu Yan was able to persuade them, along with another branch of the Lülin, the Xiajiang Force (下江兵), to join him. In AD 23, they had a major victory against Xin forces, killing Zhen Fu (甄阜), the governor of Nanyang Commandery.

==As official under Gengshi Emperor==

===The Gengshi Emperor===

By this point, many other rebel leaders had become jealous of Liu Yan&#x27;s capabilities, and while a good number of their men admired Liu Yan and wanted him to become the emperor of a newly declared Han dynasty, they had other ideas. They found another local rebel leader, Liu Xuan, a third cousin of Liu Yan, who was claiming the title of General Gengshi (更始將軍) at the time and who was considered a weak personality, and requested that he be made emperor. Liu Yan initially opposed this move and instead suggested that Liu Xuan carry the title &quot;Prince of Han&quot; first (echoing the founder of the Han dynasty, Emperor Gaozu). The other rebel leaders refused, and in early AD 23, Liu Xuan was proclaimed emperor. Liu Yan became prime minister. Liu Xiu, along with many other rebel leaders, carried the title &quot;general&quot;.

===The Battle of Kunyang===

Liu Xiu would be instrumental in the key victory that sealed Wang Mang&#x27;s fate. Wang, aware that Gengshi Emperor was becoming a major threat, sent his cousin Wang Yi (王邑) and his prime minister Wang Xun (王尋) with what he considered to be overwhelming force, some 430,000 men, intending to crush the newly constituted Han regime. The Han forces were at this point in two groups—one led by Wang Feng (王鳳), Wang Chang (王常), and Liu Xiu, which, in response to the arrival of the Xin forces, withdrew to the small town of Kunyang (昆陽, in modern Ye County, Henan) and one led by Liu Yan, which was still besieging Wancheng. The rebels in Kunyang initially wanted to scatter, but Liu Xiu opposed it; rather, he advocated that they guard Kunyang securely, while he would gather all other available troops in surrounding areas and attack the Xin forces from the outside. After initially rejecting Liu Xiu&#x27;s idea, the Kunyang rebels eventually agreed.

Liu Xiu carried out his action, and when he returned to Kunyang, he began harassing the sieging Xin forces from the outside. Wang Yi and Wang Xun, annoyed, led 10,000 men to attack Liu Xiu and ordered the rest of their troops not to move from their siege locations. Once they engaged in battle, however, after minor losses, the other units were hesitant to assist them, and Liu Xiu killed Wang Xun in battle. Once that happened, the Han forces inside Kunyang burst out of the city and attacked the other Xin units, and the much larger Xin forces suffered a total collapse. The soldiers largely deserted and went home, unable to be gathered again. Wang Yi had to withdraw with only several thousand men back to Luoyang. This was a major blow to Xin, psychologically; after this point on, there would be no hope for it.

===Liu Yan&#x27;s death and Liu Xiu&#x27;s survival===
The very first major incident of infighting in Gengshi Emperor&#x27;s regime would happen in this time, though. The Gengshi Emperor was fearful of Liu Yan&#x27;s capabilities and was keenly aware that many of Liu Yan&#x27;s followers were angry that he was not made emperor. One, Liu Ji (劉稷), was particularly critical of Gengshi Emperor. The Gengshi Emperor arrested Liu Ji and wanted to execute him, but Liu Yan tried to intercede. The Gengshi Emperor, encouraged by Li Yi (who had by that point turned against Liu Yan) and Zhu Wei (朱鮪), took this opportunity to execute Liu Yan as well.

At this time, Liu Xiu was fighting on the frontlines. When he heard about his brother&#x27;s death, he quickly left his army and went back to the temporary capital Wancheng to beg forgiveness. When Liu Yan&#x27;s followers greeted him, he only thanked them but did not speak of his feelings, but rather blamed himself and did not mention of his achievements at Kunyang. He did not dare to mourn his brother. The Gengshi Emperor, ashamed of what he had done, spared Liu Xiu and created him the Marquess of Wuxin (武信侯).

Around this time, Liu Xiu married his childhood sweetheart, the famed beauty Yin Lihua. (According to &quot;Hou Han Shu&quot;, when Liu Xiu was younger, he visited the capital Chang&#x27;an; he became impressed with the mayor of the capital (&quot;zhijinyu&quot;, 執金吾) and, also impressed by Yin&#x27;s beauty, he made the remarks: &quot;If I were to be an official, I want to be &quot;zhijinyu&quot;; if I were to marry, I want to marry Yin Lihua&quot;. He eventually was able to accomplish both of these things and more.)

===Role in reorganization of Gengshi Emperor&#x27;s regime and dispatch to northern China===
====First days under the new emperor====

Soon, Wang Mang&#x27;s Xin dynasty and its capital Chang&#x27;an fell to the Gengshi Emperor&#x27;s forces, and Gengshi Emperor was acknowledged by virtually the entire empire as the emperor of the restored Han dynasty. He initially planned to set his capital at Luoyang, and he made Liu Xiu governor of the capital region. Liu Xiu was commissioned to repair the palaces and governmental offices at Luoyang. Of all of the major Han officials following the restoration, Liu Xiu alone quickly showed his talent for organization, and his agency quickly grew to resemble its pre-Wang Mang counterpart.

In any case, Gengshi Emperor&#x27;s regime was only able to obtain nominal submission from many regions of the empire, and one of the troublesome regions was north of the Yellow River. The Emperor considered dispatching a general to try to pacify the region, and his cousin Liu Ci (劉賜), who had succeeded Liu Yan as prime minister, endorsed Liu Xiu for that task. Liu Yan&#x27;s political enemies, including Li and Zhu, opposed, but after Liu Ci repeatedly endorsed Liu Xiu, the Gengshi Emperor relented and, in autumn of AD 23, he sent Liu Xiu to the region north of the Yellow River.

Liu Xiu was initially met with great gladness by the people north of the Yellow River. It was around this time that Deng Yu joined him (later to be his prime minister); other later important figures who joined him around this time included Feng Yi and Geng Chun (耿純). Deng, seeing that the Gengshi Emperor lacked the ability to rule, persuaded Liu Xiu to keep his sights broad and consider eventual independence.

====Northern expedition====

Liu Xiu would soon have a major problem on his hand, however, in winter 23, as he faced a pretender for the Han throne. A fortune teller in Handan named Wang Lang claimed to be actually named Liu Ziyu (劉子輿) and a son of Emperor Cheng. He claimed that his mother was a singer in Emperor Cheng&#x27;s service, and that Empress Zhao Feiyan had tried to kill him after his birth, but that a substitute child was killed instead. After he spread these rumors among the people, the people of Handan began to believe that he was a genuine son of Emperor Cheng, and the commanderies north of the Yellow River quickly pledged allegiance to him as emperor. In the spring of AD 24, Liu Xiu was forced to withdraw to the northern city of Jicheng (modern Beijing). Not long after, he faced rebellions in his immediate vicinity, and was nearly killed by rebels who pledged allegiance to Wang. He reached two commanderies in modern central Hebei that were still loyal to Gengshi Emperor—Xindu (信都, roughly modern Hengshui, Hebei), whose governor was Ren Guang (任光), and Herong, (和戎, roughly part of modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), whose governor was Pi Tong (邳彤). Ren&#x27;s deputy Li Chong (李忠), Wan Xiu (萬脩) and Liu Zhi (劉植), who was powerful clan in the region, also joined him. Additionally, he began to make Liu Zhi persuade Liu Yang (劉楊) the Prince of Zhending, who held 100,000 troops, to join him. He entered into a political marriage with Guo Shengtong, the niece of Liu Yang, and combined his forces. He mobilized their forces and won some major battles against Wang&#x27;s generals.

Meanwhile, a follower of Liu Xiu, Geng Yan, the son of the governor of Shanggu Commandery (上谷, roughly modern Zhangjiakou, Hebei), had fled back to his father&#x27;s commandery, and persuaded both his father Geng Kuang (耿況) and the governor of the neighboring Yuyang Commandery (漁陽, roughly modern Beijing), Peng Chong (彭寵), to support Liu Xiu. Geng Yan, being supported by Gen Kuang&#x27;s deputy Kou Xun (寇恂) and Jing Dan (景丹), and Peng&#x27;s deputy, Wu Han, led the two commanderies&#x27; cavalry and infantry forces south to join Liu Xiu. The combined forces gave Liu Xiu enough strength to make a direct assault against Handan, trapping and killing Wang Lang.

After Wang&#x27;s death, Gengshi Emperor made Liu Xiu the Prince of Xiao and summoned him back to the capital (then moved to Chang&#x27;an). Liu Xiu, persuaded by Geng Yan that he should be ready to set out his own course because the people were badly shaken by Gengshi Emperor and his officials&#x27; misrule, declined and claimed that the region still needed to be pacified.

==Independence from the Gengshi Emperor==
In the autumn of AD 24, Liu Xiu, still ostensibly an official under Gengshi Emperor, successfully pacified some of the larger agrarian rebel groups and merged them into his own forces. He also started replacing officials loyal to Gengshi Emperor with those loyal to himself. He consolidated his power north of the Yellow River and, as he predicted that the powerful Chimei would destroy Gengshi Emperor&#x27;s government for him, he waited by for that to happen, not intervening on either side as that conflict was developing. He put Kou Xun in charge of the Henei (modern northern Henan, north of the Yellow River) region and made it the base for food and manpower supplies, while commissioning Deng with an expedition force to the modern Shaanxi region, waiting for the confrontation between Gengshi Emperor and Chimei. In early AD 25, Deng, on his way west, seized the modern Shanxi region and put it under Liu Xiu&#x27;s control, before crossing the Yellow River into modern Shaanxi.

At this point, territories that Liu Xiu controlled were already impressive, compared to any other regional power in the empire broken apart by civil war—but he still carried just the title Prince of Xiao (which Gengshi Emperor had created him) and still ostensibly was controlling those territories as Gengshi Emperor&#x27;s deputy, even as he was already engaging militarily against some generals (e.g. Xie Gong – 謝躬) loyal to Gengshi Emperor (During this incident, Liu Xiu succeeded to persuade Ma Wu (馬武), who was the deputy of Xie Gong, to join him.). In the summer of AD 25, after repeated urging by his followers, he finally claimed the title of emperor and the right to succeed to the Han throne—as Emperor Guangwu.

==Campaign to unify the empire==

===Victory over the Chimei===

Soon after Emperor Guangwu&#x27;s ascension, the Gengshi Emperor&#x27;s regime was destroyed by the Chimei, who supported their own pretender to the Han throne, Liu Penzi. The Chimei leaders, despite being militarily powerful, were however even less capable at ruling than the Gengshi Emperor, and they soon alienated the people of the Guanzhong (關中, modern central Shaanxi) region, which they had taken over when they overthrew the Gengshi Emperor. They pillaged the Guanzhong region for supplies, but as eventually the supplies ran out, they were forced to withdraw east in an attempt to return home to what is now modern Shandong and northern Jiangsu. Emperor Guangwu, anticipating this, set up his forces to harass and tire the Chimei out, and then block them off at Yiyang (宜陽, in modern Luoyang, Henan). With their path blocked and their troops exhausted, the Chimei leaders surrendered. Emperor Guangwu spared them, including their pretender Liu Penzi.

===Gradual victories over other regional powers===
Chimei was the largest of the enemy forces that Emperor Guangwu had to deal with in his campaign to reunify the empire under the rule of his Eastern Han dynasty, but there were a number of regional powers that he had to deal with. These included:

* Liu Yong (劉永), also claiming to be the proper emperor of Han, based on his lineage—as the son of Liu Li (劉立), the Prince of Liang under the reigns of Emperor Cheng, Emperor Ai, and Emperor Ping who had been forced by Wang Mang to commit suicide; he controlled the modern eastern Henan and northern Jiangsu region.
* Peng Chong, who had been by this point aggravated by Emperor Guangwu&#x27;s official Zhu Fu (朱浮) into rebellion (in a rare case of a succession of wrong decisions by Emperor Guangwu—mistakes that he learned from and would not repeat); he claimed the title of the Prince of Yan and controlled the modern Beijing region.
* Zhang Bu (張步), nominally the Prince of Qi under Liu Yong, but who independently controlled the modern Shandong region.
* Wei Xiao (隗囂), nominally the commander of the Xizhou (西州) region paying allegiance to Emperor Guangwu, but who independently controlled the modern eastern Gansu region, east of the Yellow River.
* Dou Rong (竇融), nominally the governor of Liang Province (涼州) paying allegiance to Emperor Guangwu, but who independently controlled the modern western Gansu and northern Qinghai region, west of the Yellow River.
* Lu Fang (盧芳), who also claimed the name Liu Wenbo (劉文伯) and claimed to be a descendant of Emperor Wu and the proper Han emperor. He, supported by Xiongnu&#x27;s &quot;Chanyu&quot; Yu (輿), controlled the modern central and western Inner Mongolia region. Some Russian archaeologists have identified a Han-era Chinese-style palace unearthed near Abakan (in Southern Siberia) in 1941–45 as Lu Fang&#x27;s residence after he had left China for the lands of the Xiongnu.
* Gongsun Shu, who proclaimed himself emperor of Chengjia, who controlled the Yi Province, modern Sichuan, Chongqing and parts of Shaanxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan.

Of these powers, Gongsun Shu&#x27;s Chengjia was wealthy and powerful, but Gongsun was content to maintain his regional empire and not carry out any military expeditions outside his empire. Instead, he sat by as Emperor Guangwu carried out his unification campaign. Emperor Guangwu, hesitant to carry out annihilation campaigns, largely preferred first trying to persuade the regional warlords to submit to him. Wei and Dou did in AD 29, and as they were assisting Eastern Han forces to the north of Chengjia, Gongsun was further discouraged from trying to expand his empire.

Also in AD 29, Liu Yong&#x27;s son and heir Liu Yu (劉紆) was defeated by Eastern Han forces and killed. Also in AD 29, Peng&#x27;s slaves assassinated him, leading to a collapse of his regime. Zhang, seeing the futility of resistance, surrendered and was created a marquess. By AD 30, all of eastern China was under Emperor Guangwu&#x27;s rule.

Wei, seeing that Eastern Han was gradually unifying the empire, inexplicably began considering independence. He tried to persuade Dou to enter into an alliance with him to resist Eastern Han; Dou refused. When Eastern Han started considering conquering Chengjia, Wei, apprehensive of the implications of Chengjia&#x27;s fall, tried to persuade Emperor Guangwu not to carry out a campaign against Chengjia, and later refused to lead his forces south against Chengjia.

Emperor Guangwu, who in any case preferred peaceful resolution, repeatedly wrote both Wei and Gongsun with humble terms, trying to get them to submit to him, promising them titles and honors. Wei continued to nominally submit but act as an independent power, while Gongsun refused outright—but continued to be indecisive and took no actions while Eastern Han&#x27;s rule was being confirmed throughout the land.

Realizing that neither Wei nor Gongsun would voluntarily submit, Emperor Guangwu started a campaign against Wei in the summer of AD 30—assisted by Wei&#x27;s friend Ma Yuan, who had served as Wei&#x27;s liaison officer to Emperor Guangwu and had tried in vain to persuade him not to take the course of independence. In response, Wei formally submitted to Gongsun and accepted a princely title—Prince of Shuoning—from him, and also tried to persuade Dou to join him. Dou refused, and attacked Wei in coordination with Emperor Guangwu&#x27;s forces. After some initial successes, Wei&#x27;s small independent regime eventually collapsed under overwhelming force and was reduced severely. In AD 33, Wei died and was succeeded by his son Wei Chun (隗純). In the winter of AD 34, Shuoning&#x27;s capital Luomen (落門, in modern Tianshui, Gansu) fell, and Wei Chun surrendered.

Emperor Guangwu then turned his attention to Chengjia. He commissioned his generals Wu Han, Cen Peng (岑彭), Lai She (來歙), and Gai Yan (蓋延) to go on a two-pronged attack on Chengjia—Wu and Cen leading an army and a navy up the Yangtze river from modern Hubei, while Lai and Gai led an army south from modern Shaanxi. Instead of fighting the Eastern Han expedition on the battlefield, Gongsun tried to repel them by assassinating their generals—and he was initially successful, assassinating Cen and Lai and temporarily causing the Eastern Han forces to halt. However, Eastern Han forces regrouped, and in 36 they had Gongsun surrounded in his capital Chengdu (成都, modern Chengdu, Sichuan). However, initial attempts to siege the city was unsuccessful, and Wu, then in command of the expeditory force, considered withdrawing. Persuaded by his lieutenant Zhang Kan (張堪) that Gongsun was in desperate straits, however, Wu tricked Gongsun into believing that the Eastern Han forces were collapsing from fatigue, drawing him out of the city and engaging in battle. Gongsun was mortally wounded in battle, and Chengdu surrendered in the winter of AD 36. Liu&#x27;s general Wu Han then killed more than 10,000 people.

After Chengjia&#x27;s fall, Dou turned over the lands under his control to Emperor Guangwu in AD 36, and was made prime controller. Lu, after initially submitting to Emperor Guangwu and made the Prince of Dai (as Emperor Guangwu maintained the fiction that Lu was actually from imperial lineage), eventually rebelled again, but, unable to succeed, eventually fled to Xiongnu in AD 42. The empire was entirely under Emperor Guangwu&#x27;s rule. During the wartime, Liu&#x27;s general Geng Yan massacred 300 cities.

==Reign over unified empire==

Although Emperor Guangwu had already created many of his generals and officials marquesses, in AD 37, after the conquest of the empire was largely complete, he readjusted their marches in accordance with their accomplishments. He also considered what would be the best way to preserve the relationships between him and his generals and to protect their title and position so he therefore resolved to give the generals large marches but not give them official positions in his government. He rewarded them with great wealth and often listened to their advice, but rarely put them in positions of authority. He thereby reduced friction between him and his generals, thus allowing for their relationships to be preserved. In this, he was matched perhaps only by Emperor Taizu of Song.

As the emperor of the unified empire, Emperor Guangwu&#x27;s reign was marked by thriftiness, efficiency, and laxity of laws. For example, in AD 38, his official Liang Tong (梁統) submitted a petition to restore the criminal laws of late Western Han dynasty—which were far more severe. After discussion with other officials, Emperor Guangwu tabled Liang&#x27;s suggestion. But he originated the order that servants in the inner palace must be eunuchs.

Emperor Guangwu, however, had to deal with two campaigns against non-Chinese peoples. In AD 40, a Vietnamese woman named Trưng Trắc (Chinese: Zheng Ce (徵側)) and her sister Trưng Nhị (Chinese: Zheng Er (徵貳)) rebelled. Trưng Trắc claimed the title of queen, and she ruled over an independent kingdom for several years. In AD 41, Emperor Guangwu sent Ma Yuan against the Trưng sisters. In AD 43, he defeated the Trưng sisters and killed them. (According to Vietnamese historians, they committed suicide by jumping into a river.)

Emperor Guangwu also had to deal with periodic minor battles against the Xiongnu to the north. However, throughout his reign, there were no major wars with Xiongnu. Nevertheless, because of raids by Xiongnu, Wuhuan, and Xianbei, the northern commanderies became largely unpopulated, as the people suffered great casualties and also fled to more southerly lands.

With these engagements, Emperor Guangwu declined yet another foreign engagement. In AD 46, many Xiyu (modern Xinjiang and former Soviet central Asia) kingdoms were suffering under the hegemony of one of the kingdoms, Shache (Yarkand). They petitioned Emperor Guangwu to again reestablish the Western Han post of the governor of Xiyu. Emperor Guangwu declined, stating that his empire was so lacking in strength at the time that he could not expend efforts to protect Xiyu kingdoms. In response, the Xiyu kingdoms submitted to Xiongnu.

==Marital and succession issues==

While still under the Gengshi Emperor&#x27;s reign, Emperor Guangwu married his childhood sweetheart Yin Lihua. Later, in AD 24, while he was on his expedition north of the Yellow River, he entered a political marriage with Guo Shengtong (郭聖通), the niece of a regional warlord, Liu Yang (劉楊) the Prince of Zhending. In AD 25, Guo birth him a son, Liu Jiang (劉疆).

In AD 26, Emperor Guangwu was prepared to create an empress, and he favored his first love, Yin. However, Yin had not yet had a son by that point, and she declined the empress position and endorsed Guo. Emperor Guangwu therefore made Guo empress and her son Prince Jiang crown prince.

But by AD 41, Empress Guo had lost the emperor&#x27;s favor. She continuously complained about that fact, and this angered Emperor Guangwu. In AD 41, he deposed her and made Yin empress instead. Rather than imprisoning Guo (as is often the fate of deposed empresses), he made her son Liu Fu (劉輔) the Prince of Zhongshan and made her the Princess Dowager of Zhongshan. He made her brother Guo Kuang (郭況) an important official and, perhaps as a form of alimony, rewarded him with great wealth.

Not having the heart to depose both mother and son, Emperor Guangwu initially left Guo&#x27;s son, Jiang, as the crown prince. However, Crown Prince Jiang, realizing that his position was precarious, repeatedly offered to step down. In AD 43, Emperor Guangwu agreed and made Liu Yang (劉陽), the oldest son of Empress Yin, crown prince instead. Former Crown Prince Jiang was made the Prince of Donghai. He also changed Prince Yang&#x27;s name to Zhuang (莊).

==Late reign==
In AD 47, an opportunity arose with regard to Xiongnu. Xiongnu had a succession dispute, pitting the current chanyu, Punu (蒲奴) against his cousin Bi (比), the son of a former chanyu. In AD 48, Bi also claimed the title of chanyu, and submitted to Emperor Guangwu&#x27;s authority. Punu also submitted, in response, and the divided Xiongnu stopped waging war against Han.

In AD 49, a rare blot on Emperor Guangwu&#x27;s rule occurred. He had once again commissioned Ma Yuan to go on an expedition—against the indigenous people of the Wulin Commandery (modern northwestern Hunan and eastern Guizhou), who had rebelled. While Ma was on the expedition, however, a number of Ma&#x27;s political enemies made false accusations against Ma. Emperor Guangwu, believing these accusations, began investigating Ma, who happened to die of illness while on the campaign. With Ma dead and unable to defend himself, Emperor Guangwu stripped Ma of his marquess title and denounced him posthumously. (Ma&#x27;s reputation was not restored until his daughter later became empress to Emperor Guangwu&#x27;s son Emperor Ming.)

In AD 57, Emperor Guangwu died. He was succeeded by Crown Prince Zhuang, who ascended the throne as Emperor Ming.

<text>Guevenatten (; ) is a commune in the Haut-Rhin department in Alsace in north-eastern France.

==Geography==
Situated 6 km northwest of Dannemarie, Guevenatten occupies a rather rare site in Sundgau, because it is perched on the line of crests separating the valleys of Traubach and Soultzbach, both tributaries of the left bank of releases her(it).

Guevenatten stretches along the R.D.14, twice connecting the RN83 (Main road 83) to Dannemarie by Traubach-le-Haut. On the north of the village, the Sternenberg is the highest point in the municipality at 370 m.

The village preserved a rural character. The surface of the banns is of 217 ha, the used agricultural space represents 87,2%. The woody surface, included in the agricultural space, is of 58 ha of which 35ha of municipal forest.

<text>Pierre Raymond Sommer (31 August 1906 – 10 September 1950) was a French racing driver. He raced both before and after WWII with some success, particularly in endurance racing. He won the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race in both and , and although he did not reach the finishing line in any subsequent appearance at the Le Mans, he did lead each event until 1938. Sommer was also competitive at the highest level in Grand Prix motor racing, but did not win a race. He won the French Grand Prix in 1936, but the event that year was run as a sports car race.

After European racing resumed in the late 1940s, Sommer again won a number of sports car and minor Grand Prix events, and finished in fourth place in the 1950 Monaco Grand Prix, the second round of the newly-instituted Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship. He was killed toward the end of 1950, when his car overturned during a race at the Circuit de Cadours.

== Biography ==

Sommer was born in Mouzon in France, to a wealthy Sedan carpet-making family. His father, Roger Sommer, broke the Wright Brothers&#x27; record for the longest flight in 1909. It was not until 1931 that Raymond started to display daredevil tendencies of his own, entering motor races in a privateer Chrysler Imperial. The following year, he won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race, despite having to drive over 20 hours solo after his teammate, Luigi Chinetti, retired ill. During the 1930s, Sommer was to dominate the French endurance classic, winning again in 1933 driving an Alfa Romeo alongside Tazio Nuvolari. He also led every race until 1938, only to suffer a mechanical failure, once when 12 laps in the lead. Sommer traveled to Long Island, New York, to compete in the 1936 Vanderbilt Cup where he finished fourth behind the winner, Nuvolari.

Although a regular top-10 finisher in &quot;Grands Épreuves&quot; Sommer never won a race. At the time, the German manufacturers Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union were the dominant force in Grand Prix racing, together with the French Bugatti team. Sommer turned to sports cars once more, and in 1936 he won the French Grand Prix with Jean-Pierre Wimille, and the Spa 24 Hours endurance race with co-driver Francesco Severi. More wins came his way including at the &quot;Marseilles Three Hours&quot; at Miramas, the Grand Prix de Tunisie and La Turbie hill climb competition in 1938 and 1939 with Alfa Romeo 308 until the outbreak of World War II, where he played an active part in the French Resistance movement.

Following the war, Sommer claimed victory in the 1946 René Le Bègue Cup race at Saint-Cloud. At the 1947 Turin Grand Prix in Valentino Park he won the first ever Grand Prix for Enzo Ferrari as an independent constructor. The following season, Sommer switched from the Ferrari team, again for a privately owned car, this time a Talbot-Lago. In 1950, the Formula One World Championship began and Sommer drove in two Grand Prix races for Ferrari and three in a privately entered Talbot-Lago, retiring in all but one.

In July 1950 he won the Aix les Bains Circuit du Lac Grand Prix with a Ferrari 166.

In September 1950, he entered the Haute-Garonne Grand Prix in Cadours, France, where the steering failed on his 1100 cc Cooper and the car overturned at a corner. Sommer, wearing his traditional canvas helmet, was instantly killed.

<text>James Keir FRS (20 September 1735 – 11 October 1820) was a Scottish chemist, geologist, industrialist, and inventor, and an important member of the Lunar Society of Birmingham.

==Life and work==
Keir was born in Stirlingshire, Scotland, in 1735 as the 18th child of Magdaline Lind (aunt of James Lind) and John Keir. He attended the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh where he met and formed a lasting friendship with Erasmus Darwin.

At the age of 22, Keir joined the army and was commissioned into the 61st Regiment (now the Gloucestershire Regiment). During the seven years&#x27; war he was stationed with his regiment in the West Indies. He became lieutenant on, 31 March 1759, captain-lieutenant on 16 May 1766, and captain on 23 June of the same year.

In the spring of 1768 he resigned his commission, being disappointed at not meeting with more sympathy in his studies from his brother-officers. He found, however, one congenial friend in Alexander Blair, afterwards a captain in the 69th regiment of foot. While in the army Keir wrote a treatise on the art of war, which was accidentally burnt at his publishers, and a pamphlet addressed to the Marquis of Granby in favour of the sale of commissions. At this same period he used to rise at four o&#x27;clock in the morning to read the classics and military writers, and he translated many chapters of Polybius.

Keir ultimately settled at Hill Top, West Bromwich, Staffordshire, and devoted himself to chemistry and geology. In 1772, with others, Keir leased a long-established glassworks at Amblecote near Stourbridge, which he managed. Partners included Samuel Skey (who manufactured vitriol near Bewdley) and John Taylor (a leading Birmingham manufacturer). While there, Keir continued his chemical experiments, particularly into the properties of alkalis. A paper by him &quot;On the Crystallisations observed on Glass&quot; was communicated to the Royal Society by his friend George Fordyce and printed in the Society&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; in 1776.

Early in the same year Keir completed his translation of Macquer&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire de Chymie&quot;, with additions and notes, published at London in two quarto volumes. In 1777 he issued a &quot;Treatise on the Different kinds of Elastic Fluids or Gases&quot; (new edition, 1779). Keir had become friends with Matthew Boulton, and in the autumn of 1768 he first met James Watt at Boulton&#x27;s house.

In 1778 Keir gave up his glass business to undertake, in the absence of Boulton and Watt, the sole charge of their engineering works at Soho, Birmingham near Handsworth. He declined, however, the offer of a partnership on account of the financial risk, and limited his connection with the firm to the letter-copying machine department.

In 1779 Keir invented and took out a patent for an alloy of copper, zinc, and iron, which could be forged hot or cold. The alloy, which Keir called &quot;Eldorado metal,&quot; originally intended for sheathing ship bottoms, but later adopted for architectural fixtures. It has been said to be almost identical with what later became known as Muntz metal.
In 1780 Keir, in conjunction with Alexander Blair (then retired from the army), established a chemical works at Tipton, near Dudley, for the manufacture of alkali from the sodium and potassium sulphates, to which he afterwards added a soap manufactory. The method of extraction proceeded on a discovery of Keir&#x27;s. A nearby road was called Soap Factory Road, though it is now called Factory Road.

When Joseph Priestley came to Birmingham in 1780, he found an able assistant in Keir, who had discovered the distinction between carbon dioxide gas and atmospheric air. Keir worked closely with Priestley to investigate the properties of gases. On 3 May 1787 Keir communicated to the Royal Society some &quot;Experiments on the Congelation of the Vitriolic Acid&quot;, and on 1 May 1788 &quot;Remarks on the Principle of Acidity, Decomposition of Water, and Phlogiston&quot;. Another paper, on &quot;Fossil Alkali&quot;, appeared in 1788 in the &quot;Transactions of the Society of Arts&quot;. Keir published the first part of his &quot;Dictionary of Chemistry&quot; in 1789. He discontinued it upon becoming convinced of the weakness of his theory of phlogiston.

On 20 May 1790, Keir communicated to the Royal Society &quot;Experiments and Observations on the Dissolution of Metals in Acids, and their Precipitations, with an Account of a new compound Acid Menstruum, useful in some technical operations of parting metals&quot;. This paper contains suggestions which may have contributed to the discovery of the electro-plate process. It was translated into German later the same year by Augustin Gottfried Ludwig Lentin as &quot;Versuche und Beobachtungen über die Auflösung der Metalle in Säuren ... &quot;

About 1794, Keir and Blair purchased land in the Tividale area, on the borders of Dudley and Tipton, on which they established the Tividale colliery. Keir studied the mineralogy of Staffordshire, and in 1798 wrote an article on it for Stebbing Shaw&#x27;s &quot;History of Staffordshire&quot;. He also gave Shaw information on Staffordshire manufacturing.

Sir Humphry Davy, while visiting Gregory Watt at Birmingham in 1800, was introduced to Keir. In February 1811 Keir forwarded to the Geological Society &quot;An Account of the Strata in sinking a Pit in Tividale Colliery&quot;, accompanied by a number of specimens.

On 19 December 1807, while Keir was staying with Blair at Hilton Park, his house at West Bromwich was burnt, though most of his books and papers were saved. For a time he lived at a small farmhouse in the neighbourhood.

Keir died at West Bromwich on 11 October 1820, and was buried at All Saints Church, Charlemont. By his marriage in 1770 to Susanna Harvey (1747–1802) he had an only child, Amelia (1780–1857), who in 1801 married John Lewis Moilliet of Geneva and later Abberley, afterwards merchant and banker of Birmingham.

==Selected non-scientific writings==

In 1791 Keir wrote, at the special desire of the widow, a memoir of his friend Thomas Day, author of &quot;Sandford and Merton&quot;. During the same year Keir&#x27;s avowal of sympathy with the French revolution at a public dinner on 14 July exposed him to much virulent abuse. He defended himself and Priestley in various pamphlets, such as the &quot;Extinguisher Maker&quot;, &quot;T. Sobersides&quot;, and &quot;High Church Politics&quot;. In 1793 Keir published a pamphlet entitled &#x27;The Martial Character of Nations,&#x27; arguing that the French were not likely to become so pacific as to make national defence less necessary. Ten years later he wrote &quot;Reflections on the Invasion of Great Britain by the French Armies; on the Mode of Defence; and on the useful application of the National Levies&quot; (1803).

Keir, who frequently amused himself by writing poetry, suggested to Darwin many improvements (afterwards adopted) for the second part of the &quot;Botanic Garden&quot;. The most valuable portion of his correspondence was destroyed by the fire at his daughter&#x27;s residence, Abberley Hall, Worcestershire, on 25 December 1845. A selection from what was saved, with a sketch of his life, was printed for private circulation in 1859.

==Honours and memorials==

* Keir was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London on 8 December 1785.
* Keir is remembered by the Lunar Society Moonstones in Birmingham.

<text>Igo Gruden (18 April 1893 – 29 November 1948) was a Slovene poet and translator.

He was born as Ignacij Gruden in the small fishing village of Aurisina near Trieste, then part of the Austro-Hungarian County of Gorizia and Gradisca (now in Italy) as first of ten children of Franc Gruden and Justina Košuta. He attended high schools in Trieste and Gorizia, and then studied law in Vienna and Graz. During World War I, he served in the Austro-Hungarian Army and fought in the Battles of the Isonzo, where he was seriously injured. After the war, he continued his studies in Prague, graduating in 1921. The same year, he moved to Ljubljana, then part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, where he practiced law.

In the 1920s and 1930s, he was active in spreading the anti-Fascist sentiment among Slovene intellectuals. In 1922, he was arrested by the Italian authorities while visiting his native village, which was then under Italian jurisdiction. He was released after the intervention of the Yugoslav authorities. In Ljubljana, Gruden soon became part of the local left liberal intellectual circles. He collaborated with renowned journals such as &quot;Ljubljanski zvon&quot; and &quot;Sodobnost&quot;, and frequented authors such as Josip Vidmar, Juš Kozak, Ferdo Kozak, Fran Albreht, Stanko Leben, Lojze Ude and Anton Vodnik.

During World War II, he collaborated with the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation, and was interned by the Italian occupation forces to the Rab concentration camp. After the Italian armistice, he joined the Partisan resistance. After the war, he worked at the Slovenian section of the Yugoslav Radio in Belgrade, together with Matej Bor and Anton Ingolič. He died in Ljubljana and was buried in the Žale cemetery.

Gruden&#x27;s poetry was influenced mostly by the Slovene Modern (), particularly Oton Župančič and Dragotin Kette. He was also heavily influenced by Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio and Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. Initially, he followed the vitalist trend, but later moved to more reflexive poetry. During World War II, he published many poems describing the daily life in concentration camps.

<doc id="343286" wikidata="Q2502619" url="?curid=343286" title="Toffoli gate">
<text>In logic circuits, the Toffoli gate, also known as the CCNOT gate (“controlled-controlled-not”), invented by Tommaso Toffoli, is a CNOT gate with two control qubits and one target qubit. That is, the target qubit (third qubit) will be inverted if the first and second qubits are both 1. It is a universal reversible logic gate, which means that any classical reversible circuit can be constructed from Toffoli gates. 

==Description==
The truth table and permutation matrix are as follows (the permutation can be written (7,8) in cycle notation):

== Background ==

An input-consuming logic gate &quot;L&quot; is reversible if it meets the following conditions: (1) &quot;L&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;y&quot; is a gate where for any output &quot;y&quot;, there is a unique input &quot;x&quot;; (2) The gate &quot;L&quot; is reversible if there is a gate &quot;L&quot;´(&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; which maps &quot;y&quot; to &quot;x&quot;, for all &quot;y&quot;.

An example of a reversible logic gate is a NOT, which can be described from its truth table below:

The common AND gate is not reversible, because the inputs 00, 01 and 10 are all mapped to the output 0.

Reversible gates have been studied since the 1960s. The original motivation was that reversible gates dissipate less heat (or, in principle, no heat).

More recent motivation comes from quantum computing. In quantum mechanics the quantum state can evolve in two ways: by Schrödinger&#x27;s equation (unitary transformations), or by their collapse. Logic operations for quantum computers, of which the Toffoli gate is an example, are unitary transformations and therefore evolve reversibly.

==Hardware description==

The classical Toffoli gate implemented in the hardware description language Verilog:

module toffoli_gate (
 input u1, input u2, input in,
 output v1, output v2, output out);
always @(*) begin
 v1 = u1;
 v2 = u2;
 out = in ^ (u1 &amp;&amp; u2);
end
endmodule
==Universality and Toffoli gate==
Any reversible gate that consumes its inputs and allows all input computations must have no more input bits than output bits, by the pigeonhole principle. For one input bit, there are two possible reversible gates. One of them is NOT. The other is the identity gate, which maps its input to the output unchanged. For two input bits, the only non-trivial gate (up to symmetry) is the controlled NOT gate (CNOT), which XORs the first bit to the second bit and leaves the first bit unchanged.

Unfortunately, there are reversible functions that cannot be computed using just those gates. For example, AND cannot be achieved by those gates. In other words, the set consisting of NOT and XOR gates is not universal. To compute an arbitrary function using reversible gates, the Toffoli gate, proposed in 1980 by Toffoli, can indeed achieve the goal. It can be also described as mapping bits {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;} to {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; XOR (&quot;a&quot; AND &quot;b&quot;)}. This can also be understood as a modulo operation on bit &quot;c&quot;: {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;} → {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, (&quot;c&quot; + &quot;ab&quot;) mod 2}, often written as {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;} → {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; ⨁ &quot;ab&quot;}.

The Toffoli gate is universal; this means that for any Boolean function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;m&quot;), there is a circuit consisting of Toffoli gates that takes &quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;m&quot; and some extra bits set to 0 or 1 to outputs &quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;m&quot;, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;m&quot;), and some extra bits (called garbage). A NOT gate, for example, can be constructed from a Toffoli gate by setting the three input bits to {&quot;a&quot;, 1, 1}, making the third output bit (1 XOR (&quot;a&quot; AND 1)) = NOT &quot;a&quot;; (&quot;a&quot; AND &quot;b&quot;) is the third output bit from {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, 0}. Essentially, this means that one can use Toffoli gates to build systems that will perform any desired Boolean function computation in a reversible manner.

== Related logic gates ==

* The Fredkin gate is a universal reversible 3-bit gate that swaps the last two bits if the first bit is 1; a controlled-swap operation.
* The &quot;n&quot;-bit Toffoli gate is a generalization of the Toffoli gate. It takes &quot;n&quot; bits &quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; as inputs and outputs &quot;n&quot; bits. The first &quot;n&quot; − 1 output bits are just &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1. The last output bit is (&quot;x&quot;1 AND ... AND &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1) XOR &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;.
* The Toffoli gate can be realized by five two-qubit quantum gates, but it can be shown that it is not possible using fewer than five.
* Another universal gate, the Deutsch gate, can be realized by five optical pulses with neutral atoms. The Deutsch gate is a universal gate for quantum computing.
* The Margolus gate (named after Norman Margolus), also called simplified Toffoli, is very similar to a Toffoli gate but with a −1 in the diagonal: RCCX = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, −1, &quot;X&quot;). The Margolus gate is also universal for reversible circuits and acts very similar to a Toffoli gate, with the advantage that it can be constructed with about half of the CNOTs compared to the Toffoli gate.
* The iToffoli gate was implemented in superconducting qubits with pair-wise coupling by simultaneously applying noncommuting operations. 

==Relation to quantum computing==
Any reversible gate can be implemented on a quantum computer, and hence the Toffoli gate is also a quantum operator. However, the Toffoli gate cannot be used for universal quantum computation, though it does mean that a quantum computer can implement all possible classical computations. The Toffoli gate has to be implemented along with some inherently quantum gate(s) in order to be universal for quantum computation. Specifically any single-qubit gate with real coefficients that can create a nontrivial quantum state suffices.

A Toffoli gate based on quantum mechanics was successfully realized in January 2009 at the University of Innsbruck, Austria. While the implementation of an &quot;n&quot;-qubit Toffoli with circuit model requires formula_1 CNOT gates, the best known upper bound stands at formula_2 CNOT gates. It has been suggested that trapped Ion Quantum computers may be able to implement an &quot;n&quot;-qubit Toffoli gate directly. The application of many-body interaction could be used for direct operation of the gate in trapped ions, Rydberg atoms, and superconducting circuit implementations. Following the dark-state manifold, Khazali-Mølmer Cn-NOT gate operates with only three pulses, departing from the circuit model paradigm. The iToffoli gate was implemented in a single step using three superconducting qubits with pair-wise coupling.

<doc id="343288" wikidata="Q317200" url="?curid=343288" title="Jorge de Montemor">
<text> () (1520? – 26 February 1561) was a Portuguese novelist and poet, who wrote almost exclusively in Spanish. His most famous work is a pastoral prose romance, the &quot;Diana&quot; (1559).

==Biography==
He was born at Montemor-o-Velho (near Coimbra), whence he derived his name, the Spanish form of which is Montemayor.

He seems to have studied music in his youth, and to have gone to Spain in 1543 as chorister in the suite of the Portuguese Infanta Maria, first wife of Philip II. In 1552 he went back to Portugal in the suite of the Infanta Juana, wife of João Manuel, Prince of Portugal, and on the death of this prince in 1554 returned to Spain. He is said to have served in the army, to have accompanied Philip II to England in 1555, and to have travelled in Italy and the Low Countries; but it is certain that his poetical works were published at Antwerp in 1554, and again in 1558.

His reputation is based on a prose work, the &quot;Diana&quot;, a pastoral romance published about 1559. Shortly afterwards Montemor was killed in Piedmont, apparently in a love affair; a late edition of the &quot;Diana&quot; gives the exact date of his death. The &quot;Diana&quot; is generally stated to have been printed at Valencia in 1542; but, as the &quot;Canto de Orfeo&quot; refers to the widowhood of the Infanta Juana in 1554, the book must be of later date.

It is important as the first pastoral novel published in Spain; as the starting-point of a widespread literary fashion; and as the indirect source, through the translation included in Googe&#x27;s &quot;Eglogs, epytaphes and sonnets&quot; (1563), of an episode in &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;. Though Portuguese was Montemor&#x27;s native language, he only used it for two songs and a short prose passage in the sixth book of the &quot;Diana&quot;. His mastery of Spanish is amazing, and even Miguel de Cervantes, who judges the verses in the &quot;Diana&quot; with unaccustomed severity, recognizes the remarkable merit of Montemor&#x27;s prose style. That he pleased his own generation is proved by the seventeen editions and two continuations of the &quot;Diana&quot; published in the 16th century, by parodies, imitations and renderings in French and English.

<doc id="343289" wikidata="Q5430458" url="?curid=343289" title="Fairhaven, Bellingham, Washington">
<text>Fairhaven (or Fairhaven Village) was a settlement in Washington state founded in 1883 by Dan Harris. In 1903, it became part of the city of Bellingham and remains a historic neighborhood.

==Description==
The Fairhaven area is situated on the south side of Bellingham, and borders Bellingham Bay on the west and Western Washington University on the northeast.

Since 1989, Fairhaven has been the southernmost terminus of the Alaska Marine Highway System, Alaska&#x27;s state run ferry system. The Bellingham Cruise Terminal is also the departure point for summer passenger ferry service to the San Juan Islands and Victoria, British Columbia, Canada operated by Victoria/San Juan Cruises. Nearby is Fairhaven Station, a small transportation hub which serves as Bellingham&#x27;s &quot;Amtrak Cascades&quot; station stop as well as the Greyhound bus depot. Connections can be made to local taxis or local transit. Whatcom Transportation Authority recently upgraded Fairhaven&#x27;s bus service to every 15 minutes as part of its Red Line.
Fairhaven also plays outdoor movies every weekend during the summer at the Pickford Outdoor Cinema in Fairhaven&#x27;s historical district.

===Historical district===
In the center of the Fairhaven area is the Fairhaven Historical District, which features a seasonal farmer&#x27;s market as well as restaurants and shops. All newly constructed buildings are required to conform in outward appearance to the community&#x27;s traditional 19th-century style as defined by theBellingham Municipal Code.

==History==

Daniel Jefferson Harris (aka Dirty Dan) arrived in the Bellingham Bay area in 1853 or 1854, and befriended John Thomas, who had filed a land claim along Padden Creek. He helped Thomas start a cabin there, but Thomas died before the cabin was finished. Dan finished the claim on the land and the patented was issued in 1871. He also acquired several surrounding properties and named this area Fairhaven, from the native name see-see-lich-em, meaning safe port or fair haven (possibly also from a town in Maine that may or may not have been his birthplace). He platted the town in 1883, and started selling lots. As his fortune improved so did his appears and reputation, allowing him to marry in 1885. In 1888, he sold most of his property in Fairhaven to Nelson Bennett and left for California. Nelson Bennett, along with Charles Larrabee, who arrived in 1890, formed the Fairhaven Land Company, mostly financed by Larrabee, determined to grow Fairhaven into a major city. They promoted the land rich in natural resources, good weather, and endless possibilities, causing the population to grow from around 150 in 1889 to 8000 at the end of 1890. Part of that increase was due to the purchase by the Fairhaven Land Company of a tiny settlement called Bellingham, tucked between Sehome and Fairhaven, which had a post office starting in 1883.

Fairhaven, like many other coastal Washington cities, competed with other Washington cities for the position of terminal city of the Great Northern Railroad, but that title ultimately fell on Seattle. During this period of competitiveness, which lasted from the late 1870s through mid-1880s, Fairhaven adopted its iconic 19th century style and took on an aesthetic appeal to architecture and design. Even after it was decided that Seattle would house the Great Northern Railroad terminal, population and aesthetically-minded construction continued to boom until the late 1890s. Fairhaven was officially incorporated on May 13, 1890.

During the speculative frenzy of the 1890s, the grand Fairhaven Hotel was built to attract railroad tycoons to choose Fairhaven as the west coast terminus of transcontinental railways. The railways never came, but the imposing remnant of the old hotel stood until a fire and demolition in 1953.

On October 27, 1903, citizens of Fairhaven and citizens of a neighboring city on Bellingham Bay, Whatcom City, voted to consolidate into one city named Bellingham. On December 28, 1903, the new city of Bellingham was officially established.

In 1903, Fairhaven received a grant to build the area&#x27;s first Carnegie-funded library on 12th Street. The library continues to operate as a branch of the Bellingham Public Library system.

Fairhaven is also known for its historical ties to salmon canning, and from the late 1800s through to the 1940s was the home of numerous salmon canning operations, employing as many as 4,500 workers in the area. In the 1940s, the Pacific American Fisheries was headquartered in Fairhaven, and was known as the largest salmon canning operation in the world.

<doc id="343292" wikidata="Q983736" url="?curid=343292" title="William Small">
<text>William Small (1734–1775) was a Scottish physician and a professor of natural philosophy at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. There he became an influential mentor of Thomas Jefferson, who went on to be a leading proponent of the American Revolution, principal author of the Declaration of Independence, and the third President of the United States. From 1765, Small was an influential medical doctor in Birmingham, England, where he was a member of the Lunar Society.

==Early life and education==
Small was born in Carmyllie in Angus, Scotland, the son of a Presbyterian minister James Small and his wife Lillias Scott, and younger brother to Dr Robert Small. He attended Dundee Grammar School, and then Marischal College at the University of Aberdeen, where he received an MA in 1755.

==Career==
===Jefferson&#x27;s professor===

In 1758, he was appointed Professor of Natural Philosophy at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, then one of Britain&#x27;s American colonies.

Small was Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s professor at the College of William &amp; Mary, and had an influence on the young Jefferson. Small introduced Jefferson to members of Virginia society who proved influential in Jefferson&#x27;s life, including George Wythe, a leading jurist in the colonies and Francis Fauquier, the Governor of Virginia.

Recalling his years as a student, Jefferson described Small as:
a man profound in most of the useful branches of science, with a happy talent of communication, correct and gentlemanly manners, and a large and liberal mind... from his conversation I got my first views of the expansion of science and of the system of things in which we are placed.

===Return to Great Britain===
In 1764, Small returned to Britain with a letter of introduction to Matthew Boulton from Benjamin Franklin. Through this connection with Franklin, Small helped form the Lunar Society, a club of scientists and industrialists.

In 1765, he received his MD degree and established a medical practice in Birmingham, where he shared a house with fellow physician John Ash, the chief campaigner for the Birmingham infirmary. Small was Boulton&#x27;s physician and became a close friend of Erasmus Darwin, Thomas Day, James Keir, James Watt, Anna Seward, and others connected with the Lunar Society. Small was among the most popular members of the society and an active contributor to the society&#x27;s debates.

Small helped to bring the Theatre Royal to Birmingham in 1774 and, together with Ash, was involved in planning and building Birmingham General Hospital, which was completed in 1779.

==Death==
Small died in Birmingham on 25 February 1775 from malaria contracted during his stay in Virginia and was interred in St. Philip&#x27;s churchyard in Birmingham.

==Legacy==

The William Small Physical Laboratory, which houses the Physics Department at the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, is named in Small&#x27;s honour.

<text>Howard Nemerov (February 29, 1920 – July 5, 1991) was an American poet. He was twice Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress, from 1963 to 1964 and again from 1988 to 1990. For &quot;The Collected Poems of Howard Nemerov&quot; (1977), he won the National Book Award for Poetry, Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, and Bollingen Prize.

Nemerov was brother to photographer Diane Nemerov Arbus and father to art historian Alexander Nemerov, Professor of the History of Art and American Studies at Stanford University.

==Biography==
Nemerov was born on February 29, 1920, in New York City; his parents were David Nemerov (who among other things was a national director of the Anti Defamation League of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith) and Gertrude Russek. The Nemerovs were a Russian Jewish couple who lived in New York City and he rose to become chairman of Russeks, a Fifth Avenue women&#x27;s wear department store. His younger sisters were the photographer Diane Arbus and sculptor/painter Renee Nemerov Sparkia Brown. The elder Nemerov&#x27;s talents and interests extended to art connoisseurship, painting, philanthropy, and photography — talents and interests undoubtedly influential upon his son. Young Howard was raised in a sophisticated New York City environment where he attended the Society for Ethical Culture&#x27;s Fieldston School. Graduated in 1937 as an outstanding student and second-string team football fullback, he commenced studies at Harvard University where, in 1940, he was Bowdoin Essayist, and he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Throughout World War II, he served as a pilot, first in the Royal Canadian Air Force and later the U.S. Army Air Forces. He married in 1944, and after the war, having earned the rank of first lieutenant, returned to New York with his wife to complete his first book.

Nemerov then began teaching, first at Hamilton College and later at Bennington College, Brandeis University, and finally Washington University in St. Louis, where he was Edward Mallinckrodt Distinguished University Professor of English and Distinguished Poet in Residence from 1969 until his death in 1991. In 1999, Washington University dedicated a dormitory, The Howard Nemerov House, to him. Nemerov&#x27;s numerous collections of poetry include &quot;Trying Conclusions: New and Selected Poems, 1961-1991&quot; (University of Chicago Press, 1991); &quot;The Collected Poems of Howard Nemerov&quot; (1977), which won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the Bollingen Prize; &quot;The Winter Lightning: Selected Poems&quot; (1968); &quot;Mirrors and Windows&quot; (1958); &quot;The Salt Garden&quot; (1955); and &quot;The Image and the Law&quot; (1947). His novels have also been commended; they include &quot;The Homecoming Game&quot; (1957), &quot;Federigo: Or the Power of Love&quot; (1954), and &quot;The Melodramatists&quot; (1949).

Nemerov received many awards and honors, among them fellowships from The Academy of American Poets and The Guggenheim Foundation, a National Endowment for the Arts grant, the National Medal of Arts, the Bollingen Prize for Poetry, the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, and the first Aiken Taylor Award for Modern American Poetry.

Nemerov served as poetry consultant to the Library of Congress in 1963 and 1964, as a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets beginning in 1976, and two terms as poet laureate of the United States from 1988 to 1990. In 1990 he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. Nemerov died of cancer in 1991 in University City, Missouri. The Howard Nemerov Sonnet Award was instituted in 1994 to honor him, and by 2008 about 3000 sonnets were entered annually in the associated competition.

== Poetry ==
Nemerov&#x27;s work is formalist. He wrote almost exclusively in fixed forms and meter. While he is known for his meticulousness and refined technique, his work also has a reputation for being witty and playful. He is compared to John Hollander and Philip Larkin.

&quot;A Primer of the Daily Round&quot; is his most frequently anthologized poem, and highly representative of Nemerov&#x27;s poetic style. It is an archetypal Elizabethan sonnet, demonstrative of the prosodic creativity for which Nemerov is famous. Another widely appreciated poem is &quot;The War in the Air,&quot; which draws on his wartime experience as a pilot.

Nemerov&#x27;s &quot;Because You Asked about the Line between Prose and Poetry&quot; is frequently taught as an example of an Ars Poetica as it describes the nearly imperceptible change between rain and snow while still maintaining the formal poetic elements of rhyme and meter. A critical review by Mary Kinzie said of it: &quot;the poem imperceptibly thickens itself out of the stream of prose.&quot;

Nemerov also published a short story in the book &quot;Stories Selected from the Unexpected&quot; by Bennett Cerf under the pseudonym Joseph Cross called &quot;Exchange of Men&quot;. http://www.philsp.com/homeville/anth/s194.htm

<doc id="343294" wikidata="Q913872" url="?curid=343294" title="Bridget Fonda">
<text>Bridget Jane Fonda (born January 27, 1964) is an American former actress. She is known for her roles in films such as &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; (1990), &quot;Single White Female&quot; (1992), &quot;Singles&quot; (1992), &quot;Point of No Return&quot; (1993), &quot;It Could Happen to You&quot; (1994), &quot;Balto&quot; (1995), &quot;City Hall&quot; (1996), &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; (1997), &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; (1998), &quot;Lake Placid&quot; (1999), and &quot;Kiss of the Dragon&quot; (2001). She was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Mandy Rice-Davies in &quot;Scandal&quot; (1989), and received Primetime Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for the television films &quot;In the Gloaming&quot; (1997) and &quot;No Ordinary Baby&quot; (2001), respectively. Fonda retired from acting in 2002.

Fonda is the daughter of Peter Fonda, niece of Jane Fonda, and granddaughter of Henry Fonda. She is married to composer Danny Elfman, with whom she has a son.

==Early life==
Fonda was born on January 27, 1964, in Los Angeles, California, to a family of actors, including her grandfather Henry Fonda, father Peter Fonda, and her aunt Jane Fonda. Her mother, Susan Jane Brewer, is an artist. Fonda is named after actress Margaret Sullavan&#x27;s daughter Bridget Hayward. Her maternal grandmother, Mary Sweet, married businessman Noah Dietrich.

Fonda&#x27;s parents divorced in 1974, and the next year, her father Peter married Portia Rebecca Crockett (former wife of author Thomas McGuane). Crockett raised Fonda, her brother Justin, and older stepbrother Thomas McGuane Jr. in the Coldwater Canyon section of Los Angeles, as well as in Paradise Valley, south of Livingston, Montana.

==Career==
Fonda became involved with the theater when she was cast in a school production of &quot;Harvey&quot;. She studied method acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute as part of New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts acting program and graduated from NYU in 1986.

She made her movie debut at age five (filmed at age four) in &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969) as a child in the hippie commune that Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper visit on their trek across the United States.
Her second (non-speaking) part was in the 1982 comedy &quot;Partners&quot;. In 1988, she got her first substantial film role in &quot;Scandal&quot;, and appeared in &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; and &quot;Shag&quot; (both 1988).
Her breakthrough role was as a journalist in &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;, released in late 1990. After gaining additional work experience in a few theater productions, she appeared in the comedy &quot;Doc Hollywood&quot; (1991), and was cast as the lead in Barbet Schroeder&#x27;s &quot;Single White Female&quot;, followed by a role in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s ensemble comedy &quot;Singles&quot; (both 1992).

Fonda starred in 1993&#x27;s &quot;Point of No Return&quot;, an American remake of the 1990 French film &quot;Nikita&quot;. A review in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; cited her &quot;provocative, taunting assertiveness&quot;. In 1994, she starred alongside Nicolas Cage in the romantic comedy &quot;It Could Happen to You&quot;. She followed up with roles in the animated film &quot;Balto&quot; (1995) and the political thriller &quot;City Hall&quot; (1996). In 1997, she was on the same flight as Quentin Tarantino when he offered her the part of Melanie in &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;. She starred in &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; (1998) and &quot;Lake Placid&quot; (1999), and was also reportedly offered the lead, eponymous role in the television series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, but turned it down to concentrate on her film career.

Fonda received Primetime Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for the television films &quot;In the Gloaming&quot; (1997) and &quot;No Ordinary Baby&quot; (2001).

In 2001, Fonda starred with Jet Li in the action thriller film &quot;Kiss of the Dragon&quot;. Her final film role was in the 2001 movie &quot;The Whole Shebang&quot;. Her final role overall was the title role in the TV movie &quot;Snow Queen&quot; in 2002, and she has not appeared on screen since.

==Personal life==

Fonda met Eric Stoltz in 1986 and they began dating in 1990. In 1998, the couple ended their relationship.

In February 2003, she suffered a serious injury from a car crash that fractured a vertebra. The following month, she became engaged to film composer and former Oingo Boingo frontman Danny Elfman, and they married in November. In 2005, they had a son together.

After her engagement to Elfman, Fonda withdrew from acting and concentrated on her family life.

<text>Barnabe Googe (11 June 15407 February 1594), also spelt Barnabe Goche and Barnaby Goodge, was a poet and translator, one of the earliest English pastoral poets.

==Early life==
Barnabe Googe, born 11 June 1540 (St Barnabas Day), in Alvingham, Lincolnshire, was the son of Robert Googe (d. 5 May 1557) of Chilwell, Nottinghamshire, Recorder of Lincoln during the reign of Queen Mary, son of John Goche of London and Newland, Gloucestershire, in the Forest of Dean, by Jane Bridges, daughter and heir of James Bridges of the Forest of Dean. His mother was Margaret Mantell (d. 1540), the daughter of Sir Walter Mantell (d. 1529) of Nether Heyford, Northamptonshire, by Margaret Wood (d. 1577), one of the daughters and coheirs of Oliver Wood, esquire. Margaret Wood married twice after the death of Sir Walter Mantell (d. 1529). Her second husband was Sir William Haute (d. 1539) of Bishopsbourne, Kent, whose daughter, Jane Haute (d. in or after 1595), was the wife of the rebel, Thomas Wyatt. Margaret Wood&#x27;s third husband was Sir James Hales. Googe&#x27;s mother died when he was six weeks old, and according to Lyne, he &#x27;was probably brought up in Kent by his grandmother, Lady Hales&#x27;.

By his father&#x27;s second marriage to Ellen Gadbury, widow of a husband surnamed Parris, and daughter of a London goldsmith, he had a half brother, Robert Googe. By licence dated 21 May 1563, Ellen (née Gadbury) married William Burnell (d. 1570), esquire, of Winkburn, Nottinghamshire, Auditor to Henry VIII. It is said that Googe &#x27;came to dislike his stepmother intensely&#x27;.

At his father&#x27;s death on 5 May 1557, Googe inherited the manor of Horkstow and the lands of Alvingham Priory in Lincolnshire, and a house in London formerly owned by his grandfather. He studied at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge and at New College, Oxford, but does not seem to have graduated from either. He became a ward of the Queen, and it appears his wardship remained unsold until January 1561, when his kinsman, William Cecil, became Master of the Court of Wards and Liveries, and Googe was allowed to purchase his own wardship for £80, payable over an eight-year term. On 26 June 1563 he was granted licence to enter on his lands. In his will Googe&#x27;s father had requested his executors to have Googe educated at the Inns of Court, and by 29 March 1560 he was a member of Staple Inn, at the time associated with Gray&#x27;s Inn, where his cousin, William Lovelace, held the position of Reader in 1562 and 1567. Another of Googe&#x27;s associates at the Inns of Court was his cousin, Alexander Neville, of Gray&#x27;s Inn.

In a letter dated 1 October 1563, Cecil referred to Googe as his &#x27;servant&#x27; and &#x27;near kinsman&#x27;. According to Barrett, there is no record of the position he occupied in Cecil&#x27;s household apart from reference to him as a retainer and the fact that he was present on special occasions such as the Queen&#x27;s visit to Theobalds House in Hertfordshire in 1572, when he was &#x27;placed high on the list of servants&#x27; and referred to as the first server for the first meal&#x27;. Previous authorities claimed that he became a gentleman pensioner to Queen Elizabeth, but this has been disproved. Nonetheless, Googe did have close associations with the court through his relationship to Cecil. He exploited this important connection in the years that followed, and Cecil extended patronage towards his young protégé. It may have been due to Cecil&#x27;s encouragement that Googe accompanied the Elizabethan humanist scholar Sir Thomas Challoner on a diplomatic embassy to Spain in 1562.

Googe had begun writing poetry, and found himself in an exciting creative coterie with other young writers, such as Jasper Heywood and George Turberville. During his absence in Spain, Googe&#x27;s juvenile poems were sent to the printer by a friend, Laurence Blundeston. On his return, Googe learned of Blundeston&#x27;s actions and reluctantly gave his consent to their publication when he discovered that the printer had already paid for the paper for the print run and the composition was underway. The book appeared in 1563 as &quot;Eglogs, Epytaphes, and Sonettes&quot;, with a dedication to William Lovelace. Before the appearance of his book, no writer in England had ever published his own poetry under his own name; in this, Googe was an accidental pioneer.


==Marriage and later life==
Googe married Mary Darrell, one of the nine children of Thomas Darrell, esquire, of Scotney Castle, Kent, by his second wife, Mary Roydon, daughter of Thomas Roydon, esquire, of Roydon Hall (or Fortune) in East Peckham, Kent. Correspondence survives on the subject of Googe&#x27;s marriage with Mary Darrell, whose father, Thomas Darrell, refused Googe&#x27;s suit on the ground that she was bound by a previous contract to Sampson Lennard (154520 September 1615), son of John Lennard of Chevening, Kent. More to the point, recent research has shown that Thomas Darrell was a recusant who harboured Jesuit priests in his manor house of Scotney, near Lamberhurst in Kent. When Googe found his suit discouraged by Thomas Darrell, he appealed to his powerful contacts, and after intervention by his &#x27;near kinsman&#x27;, Sir William Cecil, the marriage duly took place in 1564 or 1565; Googe took his wife to live in Lamberhurst at the manor house of Chingley. They had seven sons, Matthew (c.1566-c.1624), Thomas (b.c.1568), Barnabe, William, Henry, Robert and Francis, and a daughter, Mary.

In 1569 Googe dedicated a long allegorical poem with a moralistic marine topic, &quot;The Shippe of Safegarde&quot;, to his sisters-in-law. By this time, Googe had served Cecil on a military expedition to Ireland, where he had contracted dysentery and nearly died. In 1571 he was returned as MP for Aldborough, Yorkshire. Further service in Ireland awaited him in 1582 when Googe was appointed to the position of provost-marshal of the court of Connaught; some twenty letters of his in this capacity are preserved in the Public Record Office. Googe considered the post a hardship. He wrote to Burghley that &quot;I here live amongst a sort of Scythians, wanting the comfort of my country, my poor wife and children&quot;. Googe repeatedly petitioned the political masters in London to be allowed to come home. On the death of his stepmother, Ellen (née Gadbury) in 1587 he received his inheritance. He finally succeeded in selling his office in the late 1580s.

Googe&#x27;s last known letter, dated 19 June 1587, was written from Lord Burghley&#x27;s chamber at court. In it Googe mentioned his new home at Alvingham. He is thought to have retired there for the remainder of his life. He died at Alvingham about 7 February 1594, and was buried in Cockerington church.

==Works==

&quot;The Zodiac of Life&quot; (1560--1565)

Googe began work on his translation on Palingenius’s &quot;Zodiacus vitae&quot; in the spring of 1559. He gave up soon after, but, encouraged by his uncle Thomas Mantell, his cousin Thomas Honywood, and the author and churchman John Bale, he resumed work on 12 December (which was the day of the winter solstice in 1559). He had finished the first three books by 10 March 1560, when he wrote the Latin dedication to three Kentish squires who had given him support : William Cromer, Thomas Honywood, and Ralph Heyman. On 28 March, de wrote a dedication in English to his grandmother, lady Hales, viz. Margaret Wood (Mantell Haute Hales). This instalment contains a Latin verse by Gilbert Duke, and various liminal poems by Googe himself.

By January 1561, Googe had completed the first six books of the &quot;Zodiac&quot;, which were published that years with a new dedication to Googe’s kinsman, sir William Cecil, dated 11 January. The earlier ones were not printed. Duke wrote a second Latin verse, and there were other Latin verses by Edward Dering and William Chaderton. Googe tells us that he had been accused of plagiarising the first three books; and the edition of 1565 he reveals that one of the clerks of the Privy Council, William Smith, had translated these books before Googe started work on them. Dering’s poem is an attack on William Fulke’s &quot;Antiprognosticon&quot; (1560), and on his supporters, who include William Painter, John Lucas the Younger, and Fulke’s brother Samuel.

On 18 April 1565, the full twelve-book version of Googe’s translation was published. There is a new dedication to Cecil. The poems from the 1561 edition are reprinted, with the exception of Dering’s. New poems by Christopher Carlile, Googe’s step-uncle, Jacobus Itzuertus (presumably a relative of the queen&#x27;s French secretary, Nicasius Yetsweirt), David Bell, and Richard Stephens.

The &quot;Zodiac&quot; was printed again in 1576, and several times afterwards.

Googe&#x27;s poems are written in the plain or native style which preceded and subsequently competed with the Petrarchan style. Petrarchan love poetry (much of the work of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, Sir Philip Sidney, Thomas Campion and others) was decorative, metaphorical and often exaggerated; it also involved a more fluid mastery of iambic English poetry than the alliterative Native Style: Googe&#x27;s tonic accents are heavy, the unaccents light; the result is sometimes deliberately blunt and plodding. The poems of George Turberville, Thomas More, George Gascoigne and Walter Raleigh are examples of a similar style.

Plain Style dealt with serious subjects in a serious way: its goal was not ornamental beauty, but truth. Googe&#x27;s poem of Money (&quot;Give money me, take friendship whoso list / For friends are gone come once adversity...&quot;) is a well-known example of the tradition.

Googe was an ardent Protestant, and his poetry is coloured by his religious and political views. In the third &quot;Eglog&quot;, for instance, he laments the decay of the old nobility and the rise of a new aristocracy of wealth, and he gives an indignant account of the sufferings of his co-religionists under Mary I of England. The other eclogues deal with the sorrows of earthly love, leading up to a dialogue between Corydon and Cornix, in which the heavenly love is extolled. The volume includes epitaphs on Nicholas Grimald, John Bale and on Thomas Phaer, whose translation of Virgil Googe esteemed.

The English pastoral poem &quot;Phyllida was a fayer maid&quot; (from &quot;Tottel&#x27;s Miscellany&quot; of 1558) has been doubtfully ascribed to Googe, despite showing little stylistic rapport with his acknowledged works. But Googe&#x27;s important contribution to pastoral poetry in English rests with his cycle of eclogues that synthesise trends from classical pastoral, the work of Mantuan, and the pastoral elements of Spanish romance, and he was the first English writer to reflect the influence of the &quot;Diana Enamorada&quot; of Montemayor.

==Translations==
Translations make up much of his other works which include:
* a translation from Marcellus Palingenius (said to be an anagram for Pier Angelo Manzolli) of a satirical Latin poem, &quot;Zodiacus Vitae&quot; (Venice, 1531?), in twelve books, under the title of &quot;The Zodyake of Life&quot; (1560);
* &quot;The Popish Kingdome, or reign of Antichrist&quot; (1570), translated from Thomas Kirchmeyer or Naogeorgus; &quot;The Spiritual Husbandrie&quot; from the same author, printed with the last &quot;Foure Bookes of Husbandrie&quot; (1577), collected by Conradus Heresbachius;
* &quot;The Overthrow of the Gout&quot; (1577), a translation from Christopher Ballista (Christophe Arbaleste), and &quot;The Proverbes of Lopes de Mendoza&quot; (1579). 

&quot;The Zodyake of Life&quot; was a significant translation, being adopted as a textbook for English grammar schools. As such, its ideas colour many of the works of English writers of the latter part of the sixteenth and the first part of the seventeenth centuries. Part of the book&#x27;s appeal, in addition to its poetical astronomy, was its notoriety as a Reformist text: Palingenius was placed on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; by the Inquisition, and consequently enjoyed popularity in Protestant regions across Europe. Between 1577 and 1631 the agricultural translation was printed at least six times under the title, &quot;The whole art of husbandry&quot;.

<text>Emperor Ming of Han (15June 28 – 5September 75 AD), born and also known as and as , was the second Emperor of the Eastern Han dynasty.

He was the fourth son and second crown prince of Emperor Guangwu. It was during Emperor Ming&#x27;s reign that Buddhism began to spread into China.

Emperor Ming was a hard-working, competent administrator of the empire who showed integrity and demanded integrity from his officials. He also extended Chinese control over the Tarim Basin and eradicated the Xiongnu influence there, through the conquests of his general Ban Chao.

The reigns of Emperor Ming and his son Emperor Zhang were typically considered the golden age of the Eastern Han Empire and known as the Rule of Ming and Zhang.

==Family background==
Liu Yang was born in AD28 to Emperor Guangwu and his first love, Consort Yin Lihua. When Emperor Guangwu, was still an official under Gengshi Emperor, he had married Yin in 23. After he became emperor in 25, had wanted to make her empress, but she declined because she had no sons at that point. Instead, she endorsed Consort Guo, who already had a son in Liu Jiang (), so Emperor Guangwu made Consort Guo empress and Prince Jiang crown prince in 26. However, Prince Yang&#x27;s birth in AD 28 was still considered a major event.

==From Dukedom of Donghai to crown prince==
In AD 39, Emperor Guangwu created all of his sons, other than Crown Prince Jiang, dukes, and Prince Yang was made the Duke of Donghai. He quickly became known for his intelligence even in his young age, and he often made quick judgments of situations that turned out to be correct. Emperor Guangwu became very impressed with him.

At the age of 41, Empress Guo had lost the emperor&#x27;s favor, and her constant complaints angered Emperor Guangwu. In AD 41, he deposed her and made Duke Yang&#x27;s mother Consort Yin empress instead. All of the imperial dukes were promoted to princes to accommodate Emperor Guangwu&#x27;s new title for Empress Guo—Princess Dowager of Zhongshan (after appointing her son Liu Fu () the Prince of Zhongshan); Duke Yang was made the Prince of Donghai.

After Empress Guo was deposed, her son, Crown Prince Jiang, became concerned about remaining crown prince, and repeatedly made requests to be replaced. Emperor Guangwu was initially hesitant to depose of both the mother and son, but in 43, he resolved the situation by switching Princes Jiang&#x27;s and Yang&#x27;s positions. He made Prince Jiang the Prince of Donghai, and made Prince Yang crown prince. At this time, he also changed Prince Yang&#x27;s name to Zhuang, perhaps because Yang (which means &quot;sun&quot;) is such a commonly used character that the law of naming taboo would cause the people too a lot of trouble. The new name was not without its own problems, and many members of the Zhuang clan were forced to change their names.

In 51, the woman who would eventually become his empress – Consort Ma, the youngest daughter of famed general Ma Yuan – would become a consort of his. At the time she was 12, and he was 23. She would become a favorite of his, but never bore him a son. Her niece (the daughter of her older sister), Consort Jia, also a consort of Crown Prince Zhuang, did give birth to a child—Liu Da (). So consort Ma adopted Consort Jia&#x27;s son as her own.

As crown prince, Zhuang was often requested by Emperor Guangwu to render opinions in important matters. In AD 51, he was involved in making a correct major decision in Han&#x27;s relationship with Xiongnu. By that point, Xiongnu had a civil war and divided themselves into two side—with North Xiongnu ruled by Chanyu Punu () and South Xiongnu ruled by Chanyu Bi (). Han had become allied with South Xiongnu, and in response, Chanyu Punu, also wanting peace with Han, requested a &quot;heqin&quot; marriage. Prince Zhuang suggested that Emperor Guangwu refuse the proposal, reasoning that North Xiongnu had only made the proposal to alienate South Xiongnu from Han. Emperor Guangwu agreed.

In 57, Emperor Guangwu died, and Crown Prince Zhuang succeeded to the throne as Emperor Ming.

==Early reign==
Due to a naming taboo, people with the surname Zhuang () were forced to change their surname to Yan ().

Emperor Ming quickly established himself as a diligent and capable administrator of the empire. He did many things to try to stamp out corrupt officials, often putting them to death if they were discovered.

One thing traditional historians praised him for was his fair treatment of his brothers by the deposed Empress Guo, treating them as if they were also born of his mother Empress Dowager Yin. In 58, when his older brother, Prince Jiang of Donghai (the former crown prince) died, he ordered that the princes and major officials to attend Prince Jiang&#x27;s funeral at Lucheng (, in modern Jining, Shandong), a highly unusual honor.

In 59, at the suggestion of his brother Liu Cang () the Prince of Dongping, Emperor Ming instituted a number of Confucian rituals, in which the emperor personally honored the officials who had helped him, to show humility.

In 60, he created his favorite Consort Ma (who was also a favorite of his mother Empress Dowager Yin) empress, and created her adopted son Prince Da crown prince.

The same year, to honour the generals and officials who had assisted his father Emperor Guangwu in re-establishing the Han dynasty, Emperor Ming, perhaps echoing what Emperor Xuan had done, had the portraits of 28 of them drawn on a palace tower (known as &quot;Yuntai 28 Generals&quot;). Later, four more portraits were added. However, Ma Yuan, because he was the father of the empress, did not receive this honor.

During the early part of his reign, North Xiongnu continued to be a constant threat to both Han and her ally South Xiongnu. Emperor Ming engaged in a variety of military and economic tactics to try to maintain peace with North Xiongnu and was largely successful. In 65, he established a permanent border defense force, known as the Duliao Army (), in charge of protecting the northern boundaries and South Xiongnu, and also to prevent the people of South Xiongnu from defecting to North Xiongnu.

In 66, in what would eventually evolve into one of the first imperial university in Chinese history, Emperor Ming built a Confucian school at the capital Luoyang, for the children of high officials and marquesses. South Xiongnu nobles&#x27; children also attended.

==Late reign==

=== The Chu and Huaiyang ===
Emperor Ming was, early in his reign, known for his generosity and affection for his brothers. This, however, apparently caused some of them to engage in behavior that were considered taboo at the time and caused them to be severely punished by Emperor Ming, leading also to two major mass executions that blotted Emperor Ming&#x27;s reign.

The first of these incidents happened in 66–67 and was relatively bloodless. The ambitious Prince Jing of Guanglin wanted to be emperor, and he plotted with people under him to rebel. When he was informed, he confessed, and Emperor Ming initially spared him and permitted him to remain the Prince of Guanglin but stripped his political powers. However, later Prince Jing hired warlocks to curse Emperor Ming. After he was discovered, Emperor Ming initially took no action, but in 67 forced Prince Jing to commit suicide.

The next incident would not be so bloodless. In 70, Prince Ying of Chu—incidentally, the only son of Emperor Guangwu not born of either of his empresses but of Consort Xu—hired warlocks to create golden turtles and jade cranes, and carved characters calling for unusual blessings on them—a major taboo at the time. Further, he was discovered to have written revolutionary writings. Emperor Ming did not put him to death, but deposed him from his principality, exiled him, and made him a commoner (but with a small fief of 500 households). In 71, Prince Ying committed suicide in exile. However, the investigation did not end. By Emperor Ming&#x27;s orders, Prince Ying&#x27;s associates (but not his family) were harshly tortured and interrogated, and anyone that they named as a co-conspirator was arrested and further tortured and interrogated. The interrogators themselves used this opportunity to falsely accuse many others of conspiracy. Tens of thousands of people died, either of torture or execution, during the investigation. Only after Empress Ma&#x27;s intercession and persuasive petitions by one of the interrogators, Han Lang (), did the interrogations taper off.

A similar incident happened in 73, when Prince Yan of Huaiyang was informed to have hired warlocks to curse Emperor Ming. Several of Prince Yan&#x27;s associates were executed, and there were also many others who were executed or exiled after Chu-style interrogations were carried out. Prince Yan himself was not executed, but was demoted from his commandery-level principality to be the Prince of Fulin, with only two counties in his principality.

===Campaigns against North Xiongnu and reassertion of suzerainty over Xiyu===
In 73, annoyed at North Xiongnu&#x27;s constant incursions against Han, Emperor Ming commissioned his generals Geng Bing () and Dou Gu () to lead a major expedition against North Xiongnu. They only had minor successes, but it demonstrated to North Xiongnu that Han was now in a position to strike back.

Dou, as part of his campaign, sent his assistant Ban Chao to visit the Xiyu (modern Xinjiang and former Soviet central Asia) kingdom of Shanshan (on the eastern edge of the Taklamakan Desert. (Xiyu kingdoms had long submitted to North Xiongnu&#x27;s authority, and unable to bear the heavy taxes, had often requested that Han step in and reassert suzerainty that had been established during the Western Han Dynasty, starting with Emperor Wu&#x27;s reign. However, they had been constantly rebuffed by Emperors Guangwu and Ming, who judged Han to be not sufficiently strong to engage in a Xiyu campaign.) Initially, the king of Shanshan was very pleased and welcomed the Han ambassadors as honored guests, but eventually the welcome faded. Ban realized that North Xiongnu ambassadors must have arrived. He found out where the North Xiongnu ambassadors were, and, in a night raid, massacred the Xiongnu ambassadors. The king of Shanshan was shocked but somewhat pleased, and submitted to Han suzerainty once again.

Emperor Ming promoted Ban and commissioned him to next visit Yutian (&quot;Khotan&quot;), then the strongest kingdom in southern Xiyu, which had a strong alliance with North Xiongnu. Guangde (), the King of Yutian, trusted his chief warlock, who demanded Ban&#x27;s horse. Ban agreed to give him the horse, and then, when the warlock arrived to pick up the horse, immediately executed him, and sent his head back to Guangde. Guangde was impressed and submitted to Han&#x27;s suzerainty. With Yutian having submitted, the Xiyu kingdoms largely all submitted as well.

In 74, Dou and Geng led a major military expedition against a major remaining ally of North Xiongnu, Cheshi (roughly modern Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang). Cheshi submitted, and at Dou&#x27;s suggestion, the office of the Protector General of Xiyu () was reinstituted. A North Xiongnu expedition in 75 to recapture Cheshi was repelled by Geng Gong (), one of the deputies of the protector general.

===Death===
In 75, Emperor Ming died. His will ordered that no temple be built for him, and that he only be worshipped as part of the worship of his mother Empress Dowager Yin. (This became a systematic reform that the rest of the Eastern Han Dynasty emperors largely followed; they did not have separate temples built for themselves, but instead were worshipped along with Emperor Guangwu. This was a major saving compared to the Western Han system of building a separate temple for each emperor.) His son Crown Prince Da succeeded to the throne as Emperor Zhang.

<doc id="343305" wikidata="Q489829" url="?curid=343305" title="Hyesan">
<text>Hyesan () is a city in the northern part of Ryanggang province of North Korea. It is a hub of river transportation as well as a product distribution centre. It is also the administrative centre of Ryanggang Province. As of 2008, the population of the city is 192,680.

== Area ==
Around the 1940s, this city included the nearby Paektu Mountains. However, due to several changes, the area of this city was reduced, and now it only includes the nearby Yalu River.

Due to the reunification matter with South Korea, this city is claimed by South Korea, following the boundaries of 1940s, not the one edited by North Korea. Therefore, according to South Korea, Hyesan still includes the nearby Paektu Mountains.

South Korea has a conflict with the People&#x27;s Republic of China because of the Paekdu Mountains. The mountain is actually divided in two: the south parts are ruled by North Korea while the north parts are ruled by the PRC. However, South Korea still claims the northern parts. It is not officially claimed, but on maps printed by South Korea, it is &quot;de facto&quot; claimed. The People&#x27;s Republic of China claims the entire mountain.

== Geography ==
The city is located in the Paektu Mountains at the border with the People&#x27;s Republic of China (Jilin province), from which it is separated by the Yalu (Amrok) River. Changbai is the closest Chinese city across the river.

===Climate===
Hyesan has an elevation-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dwb&quot;). It is located in the coldest area of Korea, which holds a record low temperature of in 1915. 

==Administrative divisions==
Hyesan City is divided into 25 &quot;tong&quot; (neighbourhoods) and 4 &quot;ri&quot; (villages):

==Economy ==

Hyesan has lumber processing mills, paper mills and textile mills. Since the North Korean economic crisis that intensified in the mid-1990s, the city has suffered from economic stagnation, and some factories in the city have closed. Reports and pictures taken from the Chinese side of the river show a &quot;Ghost City&quot;: there is almost no movement in the streets, and at night the city is dark and doesn&#x27;t have electricity. Residents of the city reputedly wash their clothes in the river because homes have no running water.

First explored in the 1960s, Hyesan mine produces 10,000 tons of copper concentrates annually. This area has 80% of North Korea&#x27;s available copper, and the North had estimated that it will be able to continue mining copper there for the next forty years. When Kapsan Tongjum Mine, explored during the Japanese colonial period, was finally depleted and closed in 1990, Hyesan Mine became the lifeline of the nation&#x27;s copper production. At that time, the mine flooded because the pumping device stopped operating due to the lack of electricity across the country. Although the workers at the mine did their best to pump the water, they could not stop the water flowing into the mine at a speed of 480m3/hour. In 1996, during the North&#x27;s &#x27;Arduous March&#x27;, electricity was not provided to the mine, leading to flooding in the mineshafts in January 1997. Hyesan Mine flooded again, as did other mines throughout the country, and lost all mining facilities. Since 1998, Kim Jong Il budgeted 8.2 million USD to dewater the mine, and the mine was recovered using electricity and equipment provided by China.

== Transportation ==
Hyesan is connected to other cities in North Korea by road, and by the Paektusan Ch&#x27;ŏngnyŏn and Pukbunaeryuk lines of the Korean State Railway.

Hyesan allegedly has a trolleybus system, though its actual existence is unknown.

== Education ==
Schools in Hyesan include Hyesan High School and Hyesan Girls&#x27; School. Higher education institutions include the Hyesan Medical University, the Hyesan University of Agriculture and Forestry, Kim Jŏng-suk College of Education, the Hyesan College of Light Engineering, and the Hyesan University of Industry.

The countryside near Hyesan has various attractions, including the Kwaegung Pavilion, Naegŏk Hot Spring and Mount Paektu.

== Notable people ==
* Yeonmi Park (b. 1993), activist and defector, escaped North Korea in 2007.
* Lee Hyeon-seo (b. 1980), activist and defector, escaped North Korea in 1997.

<text>The Pacific Grand Prix () was a round of the Formula One World Championship twice in the mid-1990s and non-championship events in the 1960s. The non-championship events were held at Laguna Seca in the United States from 1960 through 1963. The two championship races in 1994 and 1995 were held at the Tanaka International Aida circuit (now Okayama International Circuit), a slow and twisty track in the countryside of Aida, Japan, under the title Pacific Grand Prix as the title of Japanese Grand Prix was held by a race held at the Suzuka circuit which was also located in Japan. 

==Championship races==

The inaugural Championship race in 1994 saw Michael Schumacher take an easy victory after Ayrton Senna was involved in a first corner accident with Mika Häkkinen and Nicola Larini. Schumacher overtook Senna into the first corner and was never threatened for the lead from that point onward. Schumacher could have lapped second placed Gerhard Berger in the last third of the race, but chose not to. The fastest lap was set on lap 3. The race was notable for the Jordan team and Rubens Barrichello&#x27;s first podium finishes in F1 with third place. The more recent Pacific Grand Prix in 1995 was a more eventful affair, with some close racing throughout the field. Following the 1995 Kobe earthquake, the Pacific Grand Prix was moved from early in the calendar to the end of the calendar. The race culminated in a tactical victory for Michael Schumacher, securing his second World Championship, and making him the youngest double World Champion at the time (later surpassed by Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel).

This race made Japan one of only nine countries (the others being Great Britain, Spain, Germany, Italy, France, the United States, and, as a result of emergency schedule realignment for the season due to COVID-19 pandemic, Austria and Bahrain) to host multiple Grands Prix in the same year. It was discontinued primarily due to the TI Circuit&#x27;s location in a remote area of Japan; a similar criticism precluded Autopolis&#x27; plans (under &quot;Asian Grand Prix&quot; name) to host a second Japanese race in . A proposed attempt to continue the event&#x27;s name with a race in Sentul International Circuit in Indonesia was considered for 1996 (with date scheduled for 13 October), but it was cancelled as the corners were deemed too tight and unsuitable for Formula 1.

With the announcement that the Japanese Grand Prix would switch from the Suzuka Circuit to the Fuji Speedway from 2007, there had been media speculation that Suzuka may retain a race under a resurrection of the Pacific Grand Prix title. However, it was later announced that the Japanese Grand Prix would alternate between Fuji and Suzuka from 2009 onward although the alternation was cancelled as Toyota, the current Fuji Speedway owner discontinued further F1 races at Fuji, having pulled out of F1 at the end of 2009.

<text>Bayeux (, ; ) is a commune in the Calvados department in Normandy in northwestern France.

Bayeux is the home of the Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts the events leading up to the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. It is also known as the first major town secured by the Allies during Operation Overlord after D-Day. Charles de Gaulle made two famous speeches in this town.

==Administration==
Bayeux is a sub-prefecture of Calvados. It is the seat of the arrondissement of Bayeux and of the canton of Bayeux.

==Geography==
Bayeux is located from the coast of the English Channel and north-west of Caen. The city, with elevations varying from above sea level – with an average of – is bisected by the River Aure. Bayeux is located at the crossroads of RN 13 and the train route Paris-Caen-Cherbourg. The city is the capital of the Bessin, which extends north-west of Calvados. Bayeux station has rail connections to Caen, Cherbourg, Granville and Paris.

The river Aure flows through Bayeux, offering panoramic views from a number of locations. The Aure has a relatively high level of turbidity and the speed of its brownish water is moderate because of the slight slope of the watercourse, although where it is narrow in places like the centre of Bayeux, higher surface speeds are generated. In the centre of Bayeux near the Bayeux Tapestry Museum, pH levels were measured at 8.35 and the electrical conductivity of water was tested at 37 microsiemens per centimetre. Turbidity was measured at 13 centimetres by the Secchi disk method. At this point of reference, flows are generally of the order of .

The Bajocian Age in the Jurassic Period of geological time takes its name from the Latinised name of the inhabitants of Bayeux (the Bajocassi).

==Etymology==
The city was known as Augustodurum in the Roman Empire. It means the &quot;durum&quot; (Celtic word &quot;duro-&quot; &#x27;door&#x27;, &#x27;gate&#x27;, Welsh &#x27;, Breton &#x27; &#x27;door&#x27;, &#x27;gate&#x27;) dedicated to Augustus, Roman Emperor. The Celtic word &quot;duron&quot;, Latinised as &quot;durum&quot;, was probably used to translate the Latin word &quot;forum&quot; (Compare Fréjus &quot;Forum Julii&quot;, dedicated to Julius (Caesar)).

In the Late Empire it took the name of the Celtic tribe who lived here: the &quot;Bodiocassi&quot;, Latinized in &quot;Bajocassi&quot;, &quot;Bajocasses&quot;, and this word explains the place-names Bayeux and Bessin. &quot;Bodiocassi&quot; has been compared with Old Irish &quot;&quot; &#x27;with blond locks&#x27;.

==History==

===Origins===

Founded as a Gallo-Roman settlement in the 1st century BC under the name Augustodurum, Bayeux is the capital of the former territory of the Baiocasses people of Gaul, whose name appears in Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; (iv.107). Evidence of earlier human occupation of the territory comes from fortified Celtic camps, but there is no evidence of any major pre-existing Celtic town before the organization of Gaul in Roman &quot;civitates&quot;. Any settlement was more likely confined to scattered Druid huts along the banks of the Aure and Drome rivers or on Mount Phaunus where they worshipped. Cemeteries have been found on the nearby Mount Phaunus indicating the area as a Druid centre. Titus Sabinus, a lieutenant of Julius Caesar, subjected the Bessin region to Roman domination. The 5th-century &quot;Notitia provinciarum et civitatum Galliae&quot; mentions Suevi that had been officially settled here (&quot;laeti&quot;).

The town is mentioned by Ptolemy, writing in the reign of Antoninus Pius, under the name &quot;Noemagus Biducassium&quot; (for &quot;*Noviomagus Badiocassium&quot; &#x27;New market of the Badiocassi&#x27;) and remained so until the time of the Roman Empire. The main street was already the heart of the city. Two baths, under the Church of St. Lawrence and the post office in rue Laitière, and a sculpted head of the goddess Minerva have been found, attesting to the adoption of Roman culture. In 1990 a closer examination of huge blocks discovered in the cathedral in the 19th century indicated the presence of an old Roman building. Bayeux was built on a crossroads between Lisieux and Valognes, developing first on the west bank of the river. By the end of the 3rd century a walled enclosure surrounded the city and remained until it was removed in the 18th century. Its layout is still visible and can be followed today. The citadel of the city was located in the southwest corner, and the cathedral in the southeast. An important city in Normandy, Bayeux was part of the coastal defence of the Roman Empire against the pirates of the region, and a Roman legion was stationed there.

===Middle Ages===

The city was largely destroyed during the Viking raids of the late 9th century but was rebuilt in the early 10th century under the reign of Bothon. In the middle of the 10th century Bayeux was controlled by Hagrold, a pagan Viking who defended the city against the Franks. The 12th-century poet Benoît de Saint-Maure, in his verse history of the dukes of Normandy, remarked on the &quot;Danish&quot; commonly spoken at Bayeux in the 10th century.

The 11th century saw the creation of five villages beyond the walls to the northeast, evidence of its growth during Ducal Normandy. William the Conqueror&#x27;s half brother Odo of Bayeux completed the cathedral in the city and it was dedicated in 1077. However the city began to lose prominence when William placed his capital at Caen. When King Henry I of England defeated his brother Robert Curthose for the rule of Normandy, the city was burned to set an example to the rest of the duchy. Under Richard the Lionheart, Bayeux was wealthy enough to purchase a municipal charter. From the end of Richard&#x27;s reign to the end of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Bayeux was repeatedly pillaged until Henry V of England captured the city in 1417. After the Battle of Formigny, Charles VII of France recaptured the city and granted a general amnesty to its populace in 1450. The capture of Bayeux heralded a return to prosperity as new families replaced those decimated by war, and they built some 60 mansions scattered throughout the city, with stone supplanting wood.

===Post-medieval===
The area around Bayeux is called the Bessin, which was the bailiwick of the province Normandy until the French Revolution. 
During the Second World War, Bayeux was the first city of the Battle of Normandy to be liberated on 7 June by British troops of 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division with only light resistance. On 16 June 1944 General Charles de Gaulle made the first of two major speeches in Bayeux in which he made clear that France sided with the Allies. The buildings in Bayeux were virtually untouched during the Battle of Normandy, the German forces being fully involved in defending Caen from the Allies. Bayeux nevertheless became an important hub for the allies - military vehicles found difficulty moving through the narrow medieval streets. In late June the Royal Engineers and Pioneer Corps built a road around the town, the &#x27;Bayeux Bypass&#x27; – to facilitate the flow of traffic.

The Bayeux War Cemetery with its memorial includes the largest British cemetery dating from the Second World War in France. There are 4,648 graves, including 3,935 British and 466 Germans. Most of those buried there were killed in the invasion of Normandy in 1944.
Royal British Legion National, every 5 June at 1530 hrs, attends the 3rd Division Cean Memorial Service and beating retreat ceremony. On 6 June, it holds a remembrance service in Bayeux Cathedral starting at 1015 hrs, and later at 1200 hrs, the Royal British Legion National holds a service of remembrance at the Bayeux Cemetery. All services are open to the public, all Standards RBL, NVA, RN, ARMY, and RAF service and Regimental Associations are welcome to attend and parade. Details can be found at www.rblsomme.org

Bayeux is also the home of a memorial to all journalists who have lost their lives while reporting. The memorial was designed by Samuel Craquelin, who is a French architect. The memorial lists the names of 1,889 journalists killed between 1944 and 2007. The memorial was established in conjunction with the organisation Reporters Without Borders and is located in Bayeux because of its historic liberation on 7 June 1944. It was inaugurated on 2 May 2007.

==Population==

The inhabitants of Bayeux are called &quot;Bayeusains&quot; or &quot;Bajocasses&quot; .
==Sights==

Bayeux is a major tourist attraction, best known to British and French visitors for the Bayeux Tapestry, made to commemorate events in the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. According to French tradition, the tapestry was made by the attendants of Matilda of Flanders, wife of William the Conqueror. It was almost certainly designed and stitched in England, as evidenced by its English spellings. It is displayed in a museum in the town centre. The large Norman-Romanesque and Gothic Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Bayeux, consecrated in 1077, was probably the original home of the tapestry, where William&#x27;s half-brother Odo of Bayeux (represented on the tapestry wielding a wooden club at the Battle of Hastings) would have had it displayed.

The Jardin botanique de Bayeux is a local botanical garden dating from 1864.

<text>Dame Felicitas Corrigan OSB (6 March 1908 – 7 October 2003, Kathleen Corrigan) was an English Benedictine nun, author and humanitarian.

==Biography==
Corrigan was born in Liverpool in 1908 to a large family. She learned to play the organ at an early age and by age 15 was working as an organist at a local church. She then won an organ scholarship from the Archdiocese of Liverpool. While studying Gregorian Chant at Stanbrook Abbey in Worcestershire, she met Dame Laurentia McLachan, who would later inspire Corrigan to become a nun. Corrigan read English at the University of Liverpool, delivering a dissertation on the poet Coventry Patmore.

In 1934, the 25 year-old Corrigan entered Stanbrook Abbey as a novice. She became a nun and eventually the Abbey choir director. One of her projects was to develop an English version of the office of Compline for the abbey.

Corrigan wrote the book &quot;The Nun, the Infidel, and the Superman&quot; (1985). It was about the friendships between McLachlan and George Bernard Shaw and the scholar Sir Sydney Cockerell. The book was adapted into &quot;The Best of Friends&quot;, a play by Hugh Whitemore that was staged in the West End of London. It also became a film for television starring Wendy Hiller. In the course of her career, Felicitas corresponded with poet Siegfried Sassoon, actor Alec Guinness; and novelist Rumer Godden.

Corrigan&#x27;s biography of Helen Waddell was awarded the 1986 James Tait Black Memorial Prize. Corrigan also wrote about Hildegard of Bingen and edited publications for the Stanbrook Abbey Press. Her other works include:

*&quot;In a Great Tradition: Tribute to Dame Laurentia McLachlan, Abbess of Stanbrook&quot; (1956)
*&quot;George Thomas of Soho&quot; (1970)
*&quot;Siegfried Sassoon: Poet&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot; (1973)
*&quot;Benedictine Tapestry&quot; (1991)

Corrigan was Stanbrook Abbey&#x27;s organist from 1933 until 1990.
She died at Cheltenham on 7 October 2003.

<doc id="343315" wikidata="Q1246878" url="?curid=343315" title="Nicholas Grimald">
<text>Nicholas Grimald (or Grimoald) (1519–1562) was an English poet and dramatist.

==Life==

Nicholas Grimald was born to a modest yeoman family of farmers in 1519–20. His parents are unknown, despite the popular belief that his father was Giovanni Baptista Grimaldi. The poem &quot;A funeral song, upon the death of Annes his &quot;, accounts for his mother&#x27;s death. Grimald&#x27;s mother has been speculated to be Agnes Gyrmbold, who dies in 1555. The poem mentions his hardworking father, but focuses upon the fondness that he had for his mother. Grimald saw his parents&#x27; love and devotion for each other and expressed that in the poem. He was the only boy out of many girls.

Maps found of Huntingdonshire in the 16th century do not show a place that could be Brownshold. What was found was an estate named Leighton Bromswold. This is the closest match to how Grimald describes his home in the poem &quot;A funeral song, upon the death of Annes his &quot;.

The Grimald family was seen to be living in Leighton Bromswold for close to four hundred years. Their last name had gone through variations as shown by legal documents kept by the village. Variations include: Grymbaud, Grymbold, Grymbolde, Grimbold, Grimald, Grimbald, and Grymbalde.

There has been no evidence of Grimald ever being married or having children. Some of his contributed verses in Tottle&#x27;s &quot;Songes and Sonnettes&quot; refer to two women Grimald my have admired, Carie Day and Mistress Damascene Awdley. These verses show a debate on if marriage has the desired result that is wanted.

Grimald&#x27;s connection to Nicholas Ridley (martyr), bishop of London, brought him under suspicion, and he was imprisoned in the Marshalsea. It is said that he escaped the penalties of heresy by recanting his errors, and was despised accordingly by his Protestant contemporaries.

The exact date, cause, and location of his death are unknown. Barnabe Googe, in his &quot;Eglogs, Epythaphes, and Sonettes&quot; (1563), included &quot;An Epytaphes on the Death of Nicholas Grimaold&quot;, which was written before Googe&#x27;s departure abroad in 1562.

==Education and early career==
When Nicholas Grimald was fifteen years old, he started showing signs of poetic talent. His mother, who placed an emphasis on education, sent him to continue his education at Cambridge. This separation was hard for Grimald&#x27;s mother, as he was the only boy in the family.

In 1539–40, Grimald graduated from Christ&#x27;s College with a B.A.. Grimald travelled to Oxford a year later, when the prebendary of Leighton Bromswold Gilbert Smith, a family friend, was impressed by his work. In his first few years in Oxford, Grimald attended Brasenose College. When Grimald was unable to continue his school work because he lacked his books, his first drama was written. Grimald received encouragement from the Matthew Smith, the president of the school, along with other teachers and students who were eager to participate in the arts. The play was the Latin resurrection play &quot;Christus Redivivus&quot;. Grimald dedicated his work to Smith. It was written in 1541, but was published two years later in Germany in 1543.

At twenty-three years old in 1542, Grimald was able to acquire his B.A. at Oxford. This degree allowed his admission into Merton College, where he received his M.A. in 1544. In that same year, Grimald travelled back to Cambridge to get his M.A. at Christ&#x27;s College. Grimald chose to stay in Oxford after his degrees in 1544. His next work was another Latin tragedy based on the life and death of John the Baptist called &quot;Archipropheta&quot; in 1548. Grimald was licensed as a lecturer in 1552 by Richard Sampson, this allowed him to preach at Eccles. The next year he was appointed chaplain to Nicholas Ridley, bishop of London. Ridely&#x27;s high opinion of Grimald was shown when the bishop chose him to deliver a Latin address in April 1553, &quot;Oratio ad pontifices&quot;.

==Involvement with Nicholas Ridley==

Nicholas Grimald was appointed chaplain to Nicholas Ridley, bishop of London, in 1552. Previously, in a letter written to Sir John Gates and Sir William Cecil, Ridley praised Grimald for his preferment and commended him for his &quot;eloquence in both English and Latin&quot; (Matthew; Harrison 13). Ridley&#x27;s high opinion was later confirmed when the Bishop appointed Grimald to deliver the Latin address in April 1553, at an assembled bishops&#x27; meeting on absentee clergy.

The possible apostasy under Mary I put considerable strife on their relationship, and ultimately lead to its demise. Following Ridley&#x27;s successful recommendation for Grimald to be appointed chantership of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Queen Mary acceded to the throne. Queen Mary&#x27;s brutal prosecution of Protestants led to Ridley&#x27;s imprisonment. While in prison, Ridley wrote to Grimald and potentially sent him Lorenzo Valla&#x27;s &quot;De falso credita et ementita Constantini Donatione declamatio&quot;, a text denouncing the pope&#x27;s claim to dominion (13). The correspondence caught the attention of the Catholic authority and consequently led to Grimald&#x27;s imprisonment in the Marshalsea prison in 1555 (Stephen;Lee 1917).

Grimald&#x27;s imprisonment was brief, and many speculated the poet&#x27;s apostasy to Catholicism. Originally, Grimald quelled the accusations. In response to rumours of Grimald&#x27;s collusion with the Catholic Church, Ridley said, &quot;it will not sink into my head to think that Grimbol would ever play me such a Judas&#x27;s part&quot; (Matthew;Harrison 13). Ridley later confirmed Grimald&#x27;s betrayal, and said, in response Grimald&#x27;s imprisonment and apostasy to Catholicism, that &quot;he (Grimald) escaped not without some becking and bowing (alas) of is knee unto Baal&quot; (13). It is unclear whether or not there was reconciliation prior to Ridley&#x27;s execution.

==Works==

Upon arriving at Oxford, Grimald began his first major work; the Latin resurrection and tragicomedy &quot;Christus Redivus&quot; or &quot;The Resurrection of Christ&quot;. His motivation for starting the play was to redeem not being able to perform his studies because his books had come late. When proposing the idea of writing a play, Grimald received support from his peers, teachers, and even the college&#x27;s president. The story of the play consisted of the resurrection of Christ, and is thought to have been made for an Eastertime performance. It is believed Grimald wrote a companion play later in his life called &quot;Christus nascens&quot;, a nativity play made to be performed for Christmas. &quot;Christus Redivus&quot; was dedicated to the Archdeacon of Peterborough Gilbert Smith, and was eventually published in 1543 at Cologne.

It cannot be determined whether Grimald was familiar with George Buchanan&#x27;s &quot;Baptistes&quot; (1543), or with Jakob Schöpper&#x27;s &quot;Johannes decollatus vel Ectrachelistes&quot; (1546). Grimald provides a purely romantic motive for the catastrophe in the passionate attachment of Herodias to Herod Antipas, and constantly resorts to lyrical methods. As a poet Grimald is memorable as the earliest follower of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey in the production of blank verse. He writes sometimes simply enough, as in the lines on his own childhood addressed to his mother, but in general his style is more artificial, and his metaphors more studied than is the case with the other contributors to the &quot;Miscellany&quot;. His classical reading shows itself in the comparative terseness and smartness of his verses.

&quot;Archipropheta&quot; or &quot;The Archprophet&quot;, published in 1548, was a Latin drama that depicted the life of John the Baptist. Grimald submitted the play with his application for a fellowship with the new Dean of Christ Church, Dr Richard Cox. The application got him a job at the college as &quot;a senior or theologist&quot; where he would give lectures on rhetoric. &quot;Archipropheta&quot; is one of the first tragedies to be penned by an Englishman.

Grimald&#x27;s name is attributed to the work &quot;Vox Populi&quot;, or &quot;The People&#x27;s Complaint&quot;, published in 1549. The piece of writing criticised Church officials for failing to carry out their jobs correctly. According to Merrill, the work revolves around &quot;those rectors, vicars, archdeacons, deans, prebendaries, etc., who spend their lives far from their flocks, or do not perform their sacred duties.&quot;

He translated Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Officiis&quot; as &quot;Marcus Tullius Ciceroes thre bokes of duties&quot; (1556); a Latin paraphrase of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot; (printed 1591) is attributed to him, but most of the works assigned to him by John Bale are lost. Two Latin tragedies are extant: &quot;Archipropheta sive Johannes Baptista&quot;, printed at Cologne in 1548, probably performed at Oxford the year before, and &quot;Christus redivivus&quot; (Cologne, 1543), edited by JM Hart (for the Modern Language Association of America, 1886, separately issued 1899).

Grimald contributed forty poems to the original edition (June 1557) of &quot;Songes and Sonettes&quot; (commonly known as Tottel&#x27;s &quot;Miscellany&quot;). Two of Grimald&#x27;s poems printed in &quot;Miscellany&quot;, &quot;The Death of Zoroas&quot; and &quot;Marcus Tullius Ciceroes Death&quot;, are regarded as some of the first examples of English blank verse ever published. It is also possible that Grimald was an editor of the first edition of &quot;Miscellany&quot;. It is speculated that most of Grimald&#x27;s work was removed from the second edition due to his recantation of Protestantism. Tottel feared that Grimald&#x27;s recantation would cause book sales to decline, and thus decided to omit many of Grimald&#x27;s original works from the updated version. All of Grimald&#x27;s more personal works were left out of the second edition, and only his initials were used to signify his authorship of the nine remaining poems.

<doc id="343318" wikidata="Q7861736" url="?curid=343318" title="Tyseley">
<text>Tyseley is a district in the southern half of the city of Birmingham, England, near the Coventry Road and the districts of Acocks Green, Small Heath and Yardley. It is located near the Grand Union Canal.

==Etymology==
Tyseley means &quot;Tyssa&#x27;s clearing&quot; with &quot;-ley&quot; meaning woodland clearing.

==Education==
The local comprehensive secondary school (on Reddings Lane) is Yardleys School, which was newly constructed on the site of a former brick works. The school moved from its previous split site location in 2001. There is also several primary schools located in Tyseley, among those an Islamic school called Al Furqan which was established on site a decade ago.

==Industry==

Tyseley was once a thriving industrial area with thousands of people working in the area for major companies such as TI Reynolds (formally Reynolds Tubes) and Corona, attracting a large number of bicycle and motorcycle manufacturers to the area, and component suppliers. Other companies based in the area in the past include Abingdon Motorcycles (later becoming &quot;King Dick Tools&quot;), Dawes Cycles, Girling Brakes, Slumberland, Smiths Crisps, MEM Electrical, Harmo Exhausts, Wilmot Breedon and also the factory where Co-Operative Society (CWS) toys, motorcycles, prams and bicycles were made. They marketed their toys as &#x27;Tyseley Toys&#x27;.

The area contains many Victorian buildings that housed many manual workers reflecting the heritage of the area and the city. There is now a large incineration plant, the Tyseley Energy from Waste Plant, which burns rubbish and in the process produces electricity for the National Grid.

Much of Tyseley remains industrial, with many companies, including Klaxon, SCC, Western Pegasus Limited and Bakelite Limited, basing themselves there. One of the local attractions is the Tyseley Locomotive Works, located inside a large railway depot.

==Transport==
The 4, 4A, and 41 bus services, operated by National Express West Midlands, serve the Tyseley area.

Tyseley railway station was a predominant junction for the ex-Great Western Railway mainline between Birmingham Snow Hill and London Paddington, with the North Warwickshire Line (via Shirley to Stratford upon Avon) diverging here. Tyseley is on the Chiltern Main Line between London Marylebone and Birmingham Moor Street and Birmingham Snow Hill.

The North Warwickshire Line used to run beyond Stratford upon Avon onto Honeybourne railway station (which is on the Cotswold Line) as the Honeybourne Line to Cheltenham.

<doc id="343319" wikidata="Q7277" url="?curid=343319" title="Emperor Zhang of Han">
<text>Emperor Zhang of Han (; 56 – 9 April 88), born Liu Da (), was an emperor of the Chinese Han dynasty from 75 to 88. He was the third emperor of the Eastern Han.

Emperor Zhang was a hard-working and diligent emperor. He reduced taxes and paid close attention to all affairs of state. Zhang also reduced government spending as well as promoted Confucianism. As a result, Han society prospered and its culture flourished during this period. Along with his father Emperor Ming, Emperor Zhang&#x27;s reign has been highly praised and was regarded as the golden age of the Eastern Han period, and their reigns are collectively known as the Rule of Ming and Zhang.

During his reign, Chinese troops under the leadership of General Ban Chao progressed far west while in pursuit of Xiongnu insurgents harassing the trade routes now collectively known as the Silk Road.

The Eastern Han dynasty, after Emperor Zhang, would be plagued with internal strife between royal factions and eunuchs struggling for power. The people for the coming century and a half would yearn for the good days of Emperors Ming and Zhang. (However, part of the strife came from the power obtained by consort kin – and the precedent was set by Emperor Zhang&#x27;s bestowing of power on both his adoptive mother Empress Dowager Ma&#x27;s clan and his wife Empress Dou&#x27;s clan.) The strife between the eunuchs and royal factions would start a chain reaction of events that led to the end of the Han dynasty in 220.

== Family background ==
Then-Prince Da was born to then-Crown Prince Liu Zhuang and one of his consorts, Consort Jia, in 56. As Crown Prince Zhang&#x27;s favorite, Consort Ma – Consort Jia&#x27;s aunt (her mother&#x27;s sister) – had no sons, so on Crown Prince Zhang&#x27;s instruction, Consort Ma adopted Prince Da as her own son. Prince Da therefore grew up considering Consort Ma as his mother, and while he clearly knew that Consort Jia was his birth mother, he never treated her as his mother.

In 57, Prince Da&#x27;s grandfather Emperor Guangwu died, and his father Crown Prince Zhuang succeeded to the throne as Emperor Ming. In 60, at the behest of his mother Empress Dowager Yin Lihua, Emperor Ming made Consort Ma empress, and Prince Da, as her son, was made him crown prince, even though he had four brothers who were older than he was.

== As crown prince ==
Not much was recorded about Crown Prince Da&#x27;s career as crown prince, other than he was taught of the Confucian classics at a young age and was encouraged in his studies by his adoptive mother, Empress Ma, with whom he had a close relation. He was also close to his uncles of the Ma clan.

In 75, Emperor Ming died, and Crown Prince Da succeeded to the throne as Emperor Zhang at the age of 18. Empress Ma received the title of empress dowager.

== Early reign ==
Emperor Zhang continued his father&#x27;s hardworking tendencies as emperor, but he was more lenient than his strict father. He sought out honest officials and promoted them, and he himself lived thriftily. He was generally humble and honored the senior officials who had served his grandfather and father faithfully in accordance.

In 76, at the suggestion of his advisor Yang Zhong () and prime minister Diwu Lun (), Emperor Zhang ordered that his father&#x27;s Xiyu (modern Xinjiang and former Soviet central Asia) campaigns be abandoned. However, one of the Han generals in Xiyu, Ban Chao, seeing the importance of maintaining Han presence in Xiyu, refused to withdraw, and Emperor Zhang eventually relented and put Ban in charge of Han&#x27;s operations in Xiyu.

Being close to his Ma uncles, Emperor Zhang wanted to create them marquesses from the early start of his reign. This was initially rebuffed by Empress Dowager Ma, who found this inappropriate. In 79, however, he created them marquesses over her objection and over their requests to only be made acting marquesses.

In 77, Emperor Zhang took a daughter of his cousin, the Princess Piyang (), and great-granddaughter of the statesman Dou Rong (), as consort. He greatly loved her, and in 78, he created Consort Dou empress.

In 79, Empress Dowager Ma, who had given him much good counsel, died. Even after her death, Emperor Zhang did not honor his birth mother Consort Jia as his mother, but merely permitted her to take on the style of an imperial prince.

== Palace intrigue ==
After his mother&#x27;s death, Emperor Zhang continued to be a diligent emperor, but within the palace, there was much struggle between Empress Dou and the other imperial consorts, which would create political instability down the line.

While Empress Dowager Ma was alive, she selected two daughters of Song Yang () as consorts for Emperor Zhang. In 78, the elder Consort Song gave birth to a son named Liu Qing, and because Empress Dou was sonless, Prince Qing was made crown prince in 79. The Consorts Song were greatly favored by Empress Dowager Ma.

Later in 79, however, Empress Dou would (perhaps remembering Empress Dowager Ma&#x27;s example) adopt the son of another imperial consort, Consort Liang, Liu Zhao, as her own son, and she plotted, along with her mother Princess Piyang and her brothers, to have her adopted son made crown prince. After Empress Dowager Ma&#x27;s death, she put her plan into action. She had her brothers collect dossiers on faults of the Song clan while bribing the servants and eunuchs of Consorts Song to gather their own faults.

In 82, an opportunity came for Empress Dou. The elder Consort Song had become ill, and in her illness, she craved raw cuscuta, and she requested that her family bring them. Empress Dou seized the cuscuta and falsely accused Consort Song of using it for witchcraft. Emperor Zhang was enraged and expelled Crown Prince Qing from the palace. He had the Consorts Song arrested and interrogated by the eunuch Cai Lun. The Consorts Song saw that they were in deep straits, and they committed suicide by poison. Crown Prince Qing was deposed and created the Prince of Qinghe instead; he was replaced by Prince Zhao as crown prince. Prince Zhao, however, was friendly to his brother, and they often spent time together.

The Song sisters would not be Empress Dou&#x27;s only victims. After Prince Zhao was made crown prince, his birth mother&#x27;s clan, the Liangs, did not dare to openly celebrate, but were secretly happy. When the Dou clan heard of this, they were displeased and fearful, and they felt that they had to destroy the Liangs. Empress Dou began to give false reports about Prince Zhao&#x27;s birth mother, Consort Liang, and her sister, also an imperial consort, and they lost Emperor Zhang&#x27;s favor. In 83, the Dous further submitted false anonymous accusations against the Consorts Liang&#x27;s father Liang Song (), causing him to die in prison. The Consorts Liang died of sadness and fear.

The Dous, having made these power play, would eventually gain their goals of becoming even more powerful than they were. Also in 83, Emperor Zhang, having seen that his Ma cousins were not following the law, stopped favoring his Ma uncles, and eventually sent them back to their marches. Empress Dou&#x27;s brothers Dou Xian and Dou Du () effectively took over in the power structure – the first time in Han history that the empress&#x27; clan, rather than the empress dowager&#x27;s clan, was the most powerful consort clan. This trend held sway for the rest of Eastern Han dynasty and would prove to be a source of corruption.

== Late reign ==
However, Emperor Zhang himself remained fairly diligent and open-minded. For example, in 84, when two university students, Kong Xi () and Cui Yin () were accused of improperly criticizing his ancestor Emperor Wu and, by criticizing Emperor Wu, making veiled criticism of Emperor Zhang, Emperor Zhang accepted the letter that Kong submitted in his own defense and made him an official in his administration.

In 86, the first of the Qiang () rebellions began, and while the Qiang were pacified fairly quickly, this would be bad omen for the decades to come, as the Qiang, mistreated frequently by Han officials, would constantly rebel throughout the rest of the Eastern Han dynasty and become a major factor in the decline of the Han Empire.

In 88, Emperor Zhang died at the age of 32 and was succeeded by Crown Prince Zhao, who became Emperor He.

<text>Embrace was a short-lived American hardcore band from Washington, D.C., active from the summer of 1985 to the spring of 1986. Along with Rites of Spring, and Beefeater, it was one of the mainstay acts of the 1985 Revolution Summer movement, and was one of the first bands to be dubbed in the press as emotional hardcore, though the members had rejected the term since its creation. The band included lead vocalist Ian MacKaye of the defunct hardcore punk act Minor Threat and three former members of his brother Alec&#x27;s band, the Faith: guitarist Michael Hampton, drummer Ivor Hanson, and bassist Chris Bald. 

==History==
Hampton and Hanson had previously played together in S.O.A. The band played their first show on July 28, 1985, at Food for Thought, a former restaurant and music venue located on Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Dupont Circle; their ninth and final show was held at the 9:30 Club in March 1986. The only recording released by the quartet was their posthumous 1987 self-titled album, &quot;Embrace&quot;, being influenced by the Faith EP &quot;Subject to Change&quot;.

Following the breakup of Embrace, MacKaye and ex-Minor Threat drummer, Jeff Nelson, tried turning their recent one-off musical experiment in England, dubbed Egg Hunt, into an actual band, but the project never made it past the rehearsal stage. Hampton, for his part, teamed up with former members of Rites of Spring to form the short-lived post-hardcore outfit One Last Wish, while Bald moved on to the band Ignition. MacKaye eventually directed his energy and creativity toward the forming of Fugazi in 1987, and Ivor Hanson would pair up with Hampton again in 1988 for Manifesto.

During the band&#x27;s formative years, some fans started referring to them and fellow innovators Rites of Spring as emocore (emotive hardcore) bands, a term MacKaye publicly disagreed with.

== Legacy ==
In 1994, a tribute album for Embrace, &quot;Land of Greed... World of Need&quot;, was released through Trustkill Records, featuring Avail, Rancid, and Lifetime, among others. The concept was that each band would cover one song from the band&#x27;s sole album. The album was also a benefit for local homeless shelters.

<text>Copy editing (also known as copyediting and manuscript editing) is the process of revising written material (&quot;copy&quot;) to improve quality and readability, as well as ensuring that a text is free of errors in grammar, style, and accuracy. &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; states that manuscript editing encompasses &quot;simple mechanical corrections (mechanical editing) through sentence-level interventions (linear editing) to substantial remedial work on literary style and clarity, disorganized passages, baggy prose, muddled tables and figures, and the like (substantive editing)&quot;. In the context of print publication, copy editing is done before typesetting and again before proofreading. Outside traditional book and journal publishing, the term &quot;copy editing&quot; is used more broadly, and is sometimes referred to as proofreading; the term sometimes encompasses additional tasks.

Although copy editors are generally expected to make simple revisions to smooth awkward passages, they do not have a license to rewrite a text line by line, nor do they prepare material on an author&#x27;s behalf. (Creating original content to be published under another person&#x27;s name is called &quot;ghostwriting&quot;.) Furthermore, copy editors are expected to query structural and organizational problems, but they are not expected to fix these problems. In addition, copy editors do not normally engage in &quot;developmental editing&quot;, which includes helping an author develop an idea into a publishable manuscript, overhauling a rough draft, identifying gaps in subject coverage, devising strategies for more-effective communication of content, and creating features to enhance the final product and make it more competitive in the marketplace.

In the United States and Canada, an editor who does this work is called a copy editor. An organization&#x27;s highest-ranking copy editor, or the supervising editor of a group of copy editors, may be known as the &quot;copy chief&quot;, &quot;copy desk chief&quot;, or &quot;news editor&quot;. In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;copy editor&quot; is used, but in newspaper and magazine publishing, the term is subeditor (or &quot;sub-editor&quot;), commonly shortened to &quot;sub&quot;. In the context of the Internet, online &quot;copy&quot; refers to the textual content of web pages. Similar to print, online copy editing is the process of revising and preparing the raw or draft text of web pages for publication.

Copy editing has three levels: light, medium, and heavy. Depending on the budget and scheduling of the publication, the publisher will let the copy editor know what level of editing to employ. The chosen type of editing will help the copy editor prioritize their efforts.

== Practices ==
=== Mechanical editing ===
Mechanical editing is the process of closely reading a piece of writing for consistency, either internally or in accordance with the publisher&#x27;s house style. According to Einsohn, mechanical editors work with such things as the following:
* Abbreviations and acronyms
* Additional elements, such as charts, tables, and graphs
* Capitalization
* Footnotes and endnotes
* Hyphenation
* Italicization (appropriate use of emphasis (italic or bold); appropriate choice of broad typeface category (italic, roman, other), especially in mathematical or scientific texts)
* Numbers and numerals
* Punctuation
* Quotations
* Spelling

Gilad also mentions the following:
* Initialisms
* Page numbers, headers, and footers
* Underscoring

Proper spelling and punctuation are subjective in some cases, where they must be left to the discretion of the copy editor or the publisher. Most publishing firms use a widely recognized style guide such as the &quot;New Oxford Style Manual&quot;, &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; and &quot;The Canadian Style&quot;. Companies that produce documents and reports but do not consider themselves publishers in the usual sense tend to rely on in-house style guides or on the judgment of the copy editor.

=== Grammar and usage ===
The goal of the copy editor is to enforce inviolable rules while respecting personal stylistic preferences. This can be difficult, as some writers view grammatical corrections as a challenge to their intellectual ability or professional identity. Therefore, copy editors are encouraged to respect the author&#x27;s preference if it is acceptable. This practice is complicated further by volatile language conventions as recorded by books on grammar and usage, the authors of which often disagree.

=== Content editing ===
Content editing consists of reorganizing or restructuring a document. This involves any inconsistent parts of the content as well as any variances. Content editors can fix the content by either rewriting it or heavily editing it. The copy editor will often point out especially difficult passages to the author, who will resolve the issues.

Although copy editors are not responsible for factual correctness of the document, they can provide comments for the author on any information that they know to be untrue, such as year discrepancies or misleading ideas. Such fact-checking is acceptable for copy editors who know the document&#x27;s subject matter.

The copy editor must also point out any biased language without infringing on the author&#x27;s meaning. This includes material &quot;that might form the basis for a lawsuit alleging libel, invasion of privacy, or obscenity&quot;. Some see censoring biased language as political correctness, so it is important that the copy editor distinguish between the two. To do this, the copy editor will permit intentional &quot;politically incorrect&quot; views and censor only marginalized, offensive, or exclusive language.

=== Correlating parts, typecoding, and permissions ===
Most manuscripts will require the copy editor to correlate the parts within it. Copy editors must carry out the following tasks in this process:
* Verify any cross-references that appear in the text
* Check the numbering of footnotes, endnotes, tables, and illustrations
* Specify the placement of tables and illustrations
* Check the content of the illustrations against the captions and the text
* Read the list of illustrations against the illustrations and captions
* Read the table of contents against the manuscript
* Read the footnotes/endnotes and in-text citations against the bibliography
* Check the alphabetization of the bibliography or reference list
Some manuscripts may require special cross-checking. For example, in a how-to text, a copy editor might need to verify that the list of equipment or parts matches the instructions given within the text.
Typecoding is the process of identifying which sections of the manuscript are not regular running text. These portions of text, known as elements, include the following:
* Part and chapter numbers
* Titles and subtitles
* Headings and subheadings
* Lists
* Extracts
* Displayed equations
* Table numbers
* Source lines
* Footnotes
* Figure numbers and captions

It is the copy editor&#x27;s job to typecode (or make note of) all manuscript elements for the publication designer. Hard-copy copy editors are usually asked to pencil in the type codes in the left margin of the manuscript. On-screen copy editors may be asked to insert type codes at the beginning and end of each element.

Finally, if the manuscript contains long quotations from a published work that is still under copyright, the copy editor should remind the author to acquire permission to reprint those quotations. The same goes for the reprinting of tables, charts, graphs, and illustrations that have appeared in print. Rules vary for the reproduction of unpublished materials (letters, diaries, etc.)

== Processes ==
There are basic procedures that every copy editor must follow: copy editors need a system for marking changes to the author&#x27;s text (marking), a process for querying the author and the editorial coordinator (querying), a method for keeping track of editorial decisions (recordkeeping), and procedures for incorporating the author&#x27;s review of the copyediting into a final document (cleanup). These systems were originally developed in an era before that of the computer, but over time these procedures were adapted for a digital on-screen space.

Each medium (in print and on screen) has its own affordances, and although a copy editor may prefer one editing process over the other, copy editors are practically required to use both techniques.

=== Hard-copy editing ===
Traditional markup copyediting, or hard-copy editing, is still important because screening tests for employment may be administered in hard copy. Also, the author whose text the copy editor is editing may prefer hard-copy markup, and copy editors need to know traditional markup in case documents and materials cannot be exchanged electronically. When editing in hard copy, all participating parties (the editor, author, typesetter, and proofreader) must understand the marks the copy editor makes, and therefore a universal marking system that signifies these changes exists. This is also why the copy editor should write legibly and neatly. Copy editors working hard copy write their corrections in the text directly, leaving the margins for querying. Usually, the copy editor is asked to write in a bright color so that the author and other parties can easily recognize the editor&#x27;s changes.

=== On-screen editing ===
Every year, more editing projects are being done on computers and fewer in print. Also, if there is a digital version of a text that the copy editor is editing, the latter can more easily search words, run spell checkers, and generate clean copies of messy pages. The first thing copy editors must do when editing on screen is to copy the author&#x27;s files, as the original document must be preserved. Each word-processing program provides various options for how an editor&#x27;s markups are shown on screen and on the printout. On-screen editing mainly differs from hard-copy editing in the fact that the copy editor should edit more cleanly on screen, refraining from saving parts of words, and be careful in maintaining proper line spacing.

=== Querying ===
Copy editors often need to query their authors in order to address questions, comments, or explanations: most of these can be done in the margins of the text, or the comment section when on screen. The copy editor must consider when to query and the length and tone of their queries, as querying too often or seldom, cryptically, or sarcastically can result in a negative relationship between the copy editor and the author.

== Goals ==
A copy editor&#x27;s goals may change, depending on the publication for which they work; however, there are a few constituencies that must always be served – the author (the person who wrote or compiled the manuscript), the publisher (the person or company that pays for production), and the readers (the audience for whom the material is being produced). These parties (together with the copy editor) work to achieve the same goal, namely, to produce an error-free publication and improve the reader experience by reducing extraneous cognitive load. The copy editor strives to improve clarity, coherence, consistency, and correctness – otherwise known as the &quot;4 Cs&quot;, each of which serves the copy editor&#x27;s &quot;cardinal C&quot;, which is communication.

== History ==
The biggest difference between monastic copyists and copy editors is that copy editors leave edits as suggestions that can be rejected by the writer. These printing houses established procedures for editing, preparing the text, and proofreading the first typeset galley proofs. Specialist correctors ensured that texts followed the standards of the time.

Before the printing press, monastic copyists altered words or phrases they thought were odd, under the assumption that the copyist before them had made a mistake. This is what led to so much variety in standard texts like the Bible.

After the globalization of the book from 1800 to 1970 came the rise of American writers and editors. One editor in particular, Maxwell Perkins, was sought out by writers such as Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Wolfe because he greatly improved the work of these prominent authors with his editorial eye. Perkins was known for editing, guiding, and befriending his writers – but the times were changing.

In the late 19th century, the role of an editor was to decide if a manuscript was good enough to be published. As time passed, the role of an editor and publisher became more distant. Although there was a newfound relationship between editors and authors, thoughtful editing did not end.

Copy editors were employed at various publishing houses, magazines, journals, and by private authors seeking revisions to their work. Some copy editors were even employed by public relations and advertising firms who valued strong editing practices in their business.

The symbols used by copy editors today are based on those that have been used by proofreaders since the beginnings of publishing, though they have undergone some changes over time. However, the exact beginnings of the copyediting language used today are unclear. Despite its long history, copyediting as a practice has not experienced any extreme upheaval other than the desktop publishing revolution of the 1980s. This phenomenon began as the result of a series of inventions that were released during the middle of this decade, and refers to the growth of technology usage in the field of copyediting. Namely, the development of the Xerox Star computer, with its Viewpoint desktop environment and the Xerox multilingual character code (the precursor of Unicode); as well as others, such as the Macintosh computer, the desktop laser printer by Hewlett-Packard, and software for desktop publishing called PageMaker allowed the revolution to begin. By allowing both individuals and publishing agencies alike to cheaply and effectively begin to edit compositions entirely on-screen rather than by hand, desktop publishing revolution morphed copyediting into the practice it is today. Most copy editors today rely on more modern WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) text processors such as Microsoft Word that are based on the original PageMaker to do their work.

There were a few events that led to changes within copyediting as a career. One of these, the successful strike of the editorial department of the &quot;Newark Ledger&quot; from November 17, 1934, to March 28, 1935, was &quot;the first major action of its kind by any local guild ... [it] both confirmed the irreversibility of the guilds&#x27; movement away from the professional association idea and greatly accelerated that process&quot;. Paired with another string of strikes led by The New York Newspaper Guild against a number of smaller newspapers in the summer of 1934, these actions served to shift the image of the editorial worker as a &quot;professional&quot; to one as an average citizen. Another strike from the year 1934 was the strike at the Macaulay Company, reportedly the first-ever strike to occur at a publishing firm. At the conclusion of the second Macaulay strike, which occurred three months after the first, the nationwide drive towards unionization had entered the publishing industry and was &quot;sweeping through all the major publishing houses&quot;. As these events seemed to have the secondary result of lowering the status of editors across the various publishing fields, it could be said that they sparked the decline of copy editors, which can be seen across the publishing fields today.
Owing to the rise of the Digital Age, the roles and responsibilities of a copy editor have changed. For instance, beginning in 1990, copy editors learned pagination electronically. They could now look at multiple pages of a text on multiple screens and easily make their edits in that environment, as opposed to pasting physical paper cut-outs onto a board by hand. This technological advance also required that copy editors learn new software such as Adobe InDesign, QuarkXPress, Affinity Publisher or Scribus.

Modern copy editors are often required to edit for digital as well as print versions of the text. Digital copyediting requires copy editors to understand RSS feeds, social media (such as Twitter and Facebook), and HTML. What should be accounted for is that, in this digital age, information is constantly being released, which has led to a decline in the editing of the online versions. Editors of the website BuzzFeed commented that sometimes they &quot;simply can&#x27;t get [to] every post before it&#x27;s published&quot;.
While copy editors still do traditional tasks such as checking facts, grammar, style, and writing headlines, some of their duties have been pushed aside to make way for technology. Some copy editors now have to design page layouts and some even edit video content. Copy editors are now sometimes referred to as &quot;copy/layout editors&quot; or &quot;producers/designers&quot;.

== Changes in the field ==
Traditionally, the copy editor would read a printed or written manuscript, manually marking it with editor&#x27;s &quot;correction marks&quot;. At sizable newspapers, the main copy desk was often U-shaped; the copy desk chief sat in the &quot;slot&quot; (the center space of the U) and was known as the &quot;slot man&quot;, while copy editors were arrayed around him or her on the outside of the U, known as the &quot;rim&quot;. In the past, copy editors were sometimes known humorously as &quot;rim rats&quot;. Chief copy editors are still sometimes called &quot;the slot&quot;. But nowadays, the manuscript is more often read on a computer display and text corrections are entered directly.

The nearly universal adoption of computerized systems for editing and layout in newspapers and magazines has also led copy editors to become more involved in the design and the technicalities of production. Technical knowledge is therefore sometimes considered as important as writing ability, though this is truer in journalism than it is in book publishing. Hank Glamann, the co-founder of the American Copy Editors Society, made the following observation about ads for copy editor positions at American newspapers:
We want them to be skilled grammarians and wordsmiths and write bright and engaging headlines and must know Quark. But, often, when push comes to shove, we will let every single one of those requirements slide except the last one because you have to know that in order to push the button at the appointed time.

==Traits, skills, and training==
Besides an outstanding command of the language, copy editors need broad general knowledge for spotting factual errors; good critical thinking skills to recognize inconsistencies or vagueness; interpersonal skills for dealing with writers, other editors, and designers; attention to detail; and a sense of style. They must also set priorities and balance a desire for perfection with the need to meet deadlines.

Many copyeditors have a college degree, often in journalism, communications, or the language of the writing that they edit. Additionally, some copy editors take it upon themselves to gain a background in topics that would further help their careers. For instance, some copy editors may seek knowledge and background in statistics to help catch mistakes related to data within an article to help authors have a better chance of getting published. Statistics are an aspect of copy editing that may help understand a broader range of topics. Understanding how to read and interpret data allows copy editors to more accurately help authors which allows them to have a greater chance of publishing their work. According to Marisha Fonseca, who wrote a study on the correlation between understanding statistics in copy-editing,many articles contain statistical flaws. Although a background in statistics is not necessary to become a copy editor, the training and background in understanding quantitative data can allow copy editors to further prevent inaccuracies in data-related works. 

In the United States, copy editing is often taught as a college journalism course, though its name varies. The courses often include news design and pagination.

In the United States, The Dow Jones Newspaper Fund sponsors internships that include two weeks of training. Also, the American Press Institute, the Poynter Institute, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, UC San Diego Extension, and conferences of the American Copy Editors Society offer mid-career training for newspaper copy editors and news editors (news copy desk supervisors).

Most US newspapers and publishers give copy-editing job candidates an editing test or a tryout. These vary widely and can include general items such as acronyms, current events, math, punctuation, and skills such as the use of Associated Press style, headline writing, infographics editing, and journalism ethics.

Copy editors can also be trained in other software programs to ensure accuracy within a writer&#x27;s work. Whether using programs like illustrator, publisher, or photoshop, copy editors can obtain skills in using different types of software to help catch further errors that may be present in a writer&#x27;s work. Due to new developments in technology and its various uses, the training and skills that would help a copy editor are expected to change in the future.

== Differentiating from other forms of editing ==
Copy editing is an important step in the editing process. It is useful to differentiate it from other forms of editing to understand its unique role and significance.
===Vs. substantive editing===
* Copy editing: This process focuses on the clarity, accuracy, consistency, and overall readability of the text. It involves checking for grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, inconsistencies in style and formatting (and compliance with house style), and ensuring that the text flows smoothly. The primary goal is to polish the content without altering its core message.
* Substantive editing: Also known as structural or developmental editing, substantive editing delves deeper into the content&#x27;s structure and organization. It addresses issues like pacing, plot development in fiction, argument strength in non-fiction, and overall content organization. This form of editing may involve reordering sections, suggesting additional content, or recommending deletions.
===Vs. proofreading===
* Copy editing: As mentioned, copy editing focuses on improving the content&#x27;s clarity, coherence, and consistency. It ensures that the text adheres to a particular style guide and is free from factual errors.
* Proofreading: This is the final step in the editing process. Proofreading involves checking the text for typographical errors, missed grammatical mistakes, and formatting inconsistencies. It is the last line of defense before the content is published, and attempts to ensure that no minor errors slip through.
===Vs. line editing===
* Copy editing: This form of editing looks at the text from a broader perspective, ensuring consistency in style, tone, and voice. It also checks for factual accuracy and potential legal issues.
* Line editing: Line editing is a more in-depth review of each line in the manuscript. It focuses on the creative content, writing style, and language use at the sentence and paragraph level. The goal is to enhance the prose, making it clear and engaging.

Understanding these distinctions is useful for authors, publishers, and editors to ensure that each piece of content undergoes the appropriate level of scrutiny and refinement before reaching its audience.

== Contemporary ==

Before the digital era, copy editors would mark errors and inconsistencies with a red pen, using a markup language of symbols which were universally known. The traditional copy editor was once defined as editing for grammar, spelling, punctuation, and other mechanics of style.

Copy-editing symbols cannot be used in digital editing because they are not supported by tools such as track changes. With more posting online and less printing on paper, hard-copy can no longer keep pace with digital publishing. For a publisher to hire copy editors to print a hard copy, make edits, and then make changes is no longer the most efficient process. The position of copy editors is at risk because software can correct grammatical errors more quickly and cheaply.

Professionals feared that the introduction of digital editing software would end copyediting careers. Copy editors are still employed and needed for heavy edits, such as fact-checking and content organization, which are beyond the abilities of the software. With grammar software and journalists who can edit, copy editors are seen as a luxury in publishing. The potential for a company to use editing software may also require the copy editor to only perform heavy editing and querying. Though the steps for copyediting are the same, the execution has been adapted for digital environments.

The technological development of cloud storage allows contemporary copy editors and writers to upload and share files across multiple devices. Online word processors allow users to perform a number of tasks. Each processor has its advantages and disadvantages based on the users&#x27; preferences, but primarily allows users to share, edit and collaborate on documents. Additionally, Google Docs users can invite others via email to view, comment, and edit any file of their choosing, and those who were invited can view and edit the document together in real time. Unlike Google Docs, whose files can only be shared through the web app, Dropbox shares from a desktop app. Dropbox users can share documents as links or as shared folders. Users can create shared folders and add others to the folder. Files in a shared folder will appear in the other user&#x27;s Dropbox and all involved users receive notifications when edits are made to a file in the folder. Adobe&#x27;s Buzzword allows users to share files, with the user&#x27;s choice from varying levels of editing access and includes a version history feature which tracks changes made to documents and lets users revert to earlier versions. 
Useful in many word processors, a track changes feature allows users to make changes to a document and view them separately from the original document. In Microsoft Word, users can choose whether to show or hide changes by clicking track changes under the Review ribbon. Those editing documents can leave comments by clicking wherever the user desires to leave a comment and clicking New Comment under the review ribbon or by highlighting text and clicking New Comment. Users can apply revisions and choose which level of markups to view under the Show Markup dropdown menu in the Review ribbon. Users can also choose to accept or reject changes by clicking either Accept or Reject in the Review Ribbon.

=== Contemporary copy editor ===
The field of copy editing is not obsolete. Teresa Schmedding, president of the American Copy Editors Society (ACES) and a deputy managing editor at the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; in Chicago, thinks that copy editors are &quot;a natural fit&quot; for digital journalism and social media because, though publishing has been made available to almost anyone, quality and credibility is brought to content only by copy editors.

Copy editors must now consider multimedia aspects of the story, such as video, images, audio, and search engine optimization, which may be included in digital publications. Digital editing now requires copy editors to understand SEO, HTML, CSS, and RSS feeds, as well as creative tools like Adobe Illustrator. This shows that the age of copy editing has now surpassed traditional methods of editing. The basics of checking grammar and punctuation are still necessary, but in the age of technology, the field of copy-editing has grown to include digital editing of various forms of media. Contemporary copy editors now have to review and understand current technology to help authors gain credibility in today&#x27;s digital age. 

=== Issues ===
One of the problems with copy-editing is that it may slow the publication of the text. With the digital publishing era came an increased demand for a fast turnover of information. Additional details such as color printing, page size, and layout are determined by the allotted budget. Web-based publications, such as BuzzFeed and &quot;Slate&quot;, do not have enough room in their budgets to keep sufficient staff to edit their massive, daily rushes of content. Therefore copy chief Emmy Favila says lower-priority posts are published without copyedits at Buzzfeed. &quot;Slate&quot; does not edit its blog posts before publication, but all of its news articles are copy edited before publication, say &quot;Slate&quot; copy chief Lowen Liu and deputy editor Julia Turner.

In response to such high demands for fast-produced content, some online publications have started publishing articles first and then editing later, a process known as back-editing. Editors prioritize stories to edit based on traffic and whether the content was originally reported for needing edits.

Reading material has become increasingly accessible to users with a wide range of disabilities. Carolyn Rude exemplifies such cases in alternatively replacing illustrations with text and audio translations for the visually impaired. Rude also suggests that web developers attempt to stick to print guidelines, such as &quot;clear and simple language and consistent terms and navigation devices&quot;, especially when readers are looking at text in a second language.

== Effects of the internet==

According to a 2011 publication by Angela Anne Avery-Ahlijian, as online resources rise in popularity, copy editors endeavor to meet the increase in digital consumption to the best of their abilities, and such high competition has resulted in a gradual &quot;declining of quality in editing&quot;, such as copy editing or fact-checking. However, this does not mean that the internet has limited the scope of a copy editor&#x27;s responsibilities or job opportunities. One of the most important advancements of the digital age is the advent of pagination, which gives copy editors more control over the construction and revisions of their content, and is a convenient feature in modern software. Despite the increasing number of programs, however, some copy editors believe their basic functions and duties have not changed much. Other copy editors think that the Internet has simplified fact-checking and that websites such as Facebook or Twitter have aided information-gathering. Other digital skills, such as image selection and search engine optimization, increase the visibility of search results, especially when searching for keywords in headlines.

According to Avery-Ahlijian, in all likelihood the internet will continue to evolve, but this should not diminish the overall importance of copy editing. Although it may be tempting to neglect proper revisions in favor of convenience, the credibility and quality of an editor&#x27;s work should still be maintained, as there will always be updates in software and technology. As formats evolve, so too will the opportunities for journalists and other writers.

<doc id="343324" wikidata="Q1116788" url="?curid=343324" title="Edison Disc Record">
<text>The Edison Diamond Disc Record is a type of phonograph record marketed by Thomas A. Edison, Inc. on their Edison Record label from 1912 to 1929. They were named Diamond Discs because the matching Edison Disc Phonograph was fitted with a permanent conical diamond stylus for playing them. Diamond Discs were incompatible with lateral-groove disc record players, e.g. the Victor Victrola, the disposable steel needles of which would damage them while extracting hardly any sound. Uniquely, they are just under  in () thick.
Edison had previously made only phonograph cylinders but decided to add a disc format to the product line because of the increasingly dominant market share of the shellac disc records (later called 78s because of their typical rotational speed in revolutions per minute) made by competitors such as the Victor Talking Machine Company. Victor and most other makers recorded and played sound by a lateral or side-to-side motion of the stylus in the record groove, while in the Edison system the motion was vertical or up-and-down, known as vertical recording, as used for cylinder records. An Edison Disc Phonograph is distinguished by the diaphragm of the reproducer being parallel to the surface of the record. The diaphragm of a reproducer used for playing lateral records is at a right angle to the surface.

In the late summer and early fall of 1929 Edison also briefly produced a high-quality series of thin electrically recorded lateral-cut &quot;Needle Type&quot; disc records for use on standard record players.

==Historical background==
The record industry began in 1889 with some very-small-scale production of professionally recorded wax cylinder records. At first, costly wet-cell-powered, electric-motor-driven machines were needed to play them, and the customer base consisted solely of entrepreneurs with money-making nickel-in-the-slot phonographs in arcades, taverns, and other public places. Soon, some affluent individuals were customers, too. By the late 1890s, relatively inexpensive spring-motor-driven phonographs were available and becoming a fixture in middle-class homes. The record industry boomed. At the same time, the Berliner Gramophone Company was marketing the first crude disc records, which were simpler and cheaper to manufacture, less bulky to store, much less fragile, and could play louder than contemporary wax cylinders, although they were of markedly inferior sound quality. Their quality was soon greatly improved, and by about 1910 the cylinder was clearly losing this early format war. In 1912, Thomas Edison, who had previously made only cylinders, entered the disc market with his Diamond Disc Phonograph system, which was incompatible with other makers&#x27; disc records and players.

==Unusual characteristics==
Like cylinder records, the sound in a Diamond Disc&#x27;s groove was recorded by the vertical method, as variations in the depth of the groove cut. At that time, with the notable exception of Pathé Records, which used yet another incompatible format, a disc&#x27;s groove was normally of constant depth and modulated laterally, side-to-side. The vertical format demanded a perfectly flat surface for best results, so Edison made his Diamond Discs almost one-quarter of an inch (6 mm) thick. They consisted of a thin coating of a phenolic resin virtually identical to Bakelite on a core of compressed wood flour, later also china clay, lampblack for color, all in a rabbit-hide glue binder. With very rare exceptions, all were about ten inches in diameter, but they used a finer groove pitch (150 threads per inch, or &quot;TPI&quot;) and could play longer than lateral ten-inch records—up to minutes per side.

Among their advantages over the competition, they were played with a permanent conical diamond stylus, while lateral-cut records were played with a ten-for-a-penny steel needle that quickly wore to fit the groove contour and was meant to be replaced after one use. A feed screw mechanism inside the Phonograph moved the reproducer across the record at the required rate, relieving the groove of that work and thus reducing record wear. This design was in response to the patent held by the Victor Talking Machine Company that states that the groove of the record itself is what propelled the reproducer across the surface of the record via the needle. The playing speed for Diamond Discs was specified at exactly 80 revolutions per minute, at a time when other makers&#x27; recording speeds had not been standardized and could be as slow as 70 rpm or even faster than 80 rpm, but were typically somewhere around 76 rpm, leaving users who cared about correct pitch to adjust the playback speed for each record until it sounded right. Above all, there was, and still is, general agreement that the Diamond Disc system produced the clearest, most &#x27;present&#x27; sound of any non-electronic disc recording technology.

Although Victor&#x27;s Victrolas and similar record players could not play Diamond Discs (at best, only very faint sound would be heard, while the crude steel needle seriously damaged the groove) and Edison Diamond Disc Phonographs could not play Victor or other lateral-cut discs, third-party suppliers came up with adapters, such as the Kent adapter, to defeat this incompatibility, but typically with less than optimal sound quality. The Brunswick Ultona, the Sonora, and the expensive &quot;Duo-Vox&quot; phonograph made by the piano manufacturer Bush and Lane were the only non-Edison machines that came from the factory equipped to play Diamond Discs as well as Victor and other &#x27;needle-type&#x27; records, along with Pathé&#x27;s sapphire ball stylus hill-and-dale format that used a vertical groove that was U-shaped in cross-section. Edison discouraged all such alternatives by cautioning on some of the record sleeves: &quot;This Re-Creation should not be played on any instrument except the Edison Diamond Disc Phonograph and with the Edison Diamond Disc Reproducer, and we decline responsibility for any damage that may occur to it if this warning is ignored.&quot; The very good reason for such discouragement was that Diamond Disc grooves were too narrow and fragile to propel a soundbox across a record surface, as lateral machines did; Edison&#x27;s precise mechanical feed system on the Disc Phonograph for its weighted &quot;floating&quot; reproducer replaced that stress on its records.

==Rise and fall==
Diamond Discs enjoyed their greatest commercial success from the mid-1910s to the early 1920s, with sales peaking in 1920. Although they arguably had better audio fidelity, they were more expensive than, and incompatible with, other makers&#x27; products and ultimately failed in the marketplace. Not least among the factors contributing to their downfall was Thomas Edison&#x27;s insistence on imposing his own musical tastes on the catalog. As an elderly man who favored old-fashioned &quot;heart&quot; songs and had various idiosyncratic preferences about performance practices, he was increasingly out of touch with most of the record-buying public as the Jazz Age of the 1920s got underway. It was not until mid-decade that he reluctantly ceded control to his sons.

In 1926, an attempt at reviving interest in Edison records was made by introducing a long-playing Diamond Disc which still rotated at 80 rpm but tripled the standard groove pitch to 450 threads per inch by using an ultra-fine groove, achieving a playing time of 24 minutes per 10-inch disc (12 on each side) and 40 minutes per 12-inch disc (these were the only 12-inch Diamond Discs ever sold to the public). A special reproducer and modified feed screw mechanism were required to play them. There were problems with skipping, groove wall breakdown, overall low volume (about 40% of that of the regular Diamond Discs), and a failure to exploit the format by releasing a limited number of discs. Only 14 different Edison Long Play discs were issued before they were discontinued.

In August 1927, electrical recording began, making Edison the last major record company to adopt it, over two years after Victor Records, Columbia Records, and Brunswick Records had converted from acoustical recording. Sales continued to drop, however, and although Edison Diamond Discs were available from dealers until the company left the record business in late October 1929, the last vertically cut direct masters were recorded in the early summer of that year. Priority had been redirected to introducing a new line of Edison lateral or so-called Needle Type thin shellac records, compatible with ordinary record players, but although their audio quality was excellent this concession to commercial reality came too late to prevent the demise of the Edison Phonograph and Records Division just one day before the 1929 stock market crash.

<text>60 (sixty) () is the natural number following 59 and preceding 61. Being three times 20, it is called &quot;&quot; in older literature (&quot;kopa&quot; in Slavic, &quot;Schock&quot; in Germanic).

== In mathematics ==
60 is the 4th superior highly composite number, the 4th colossally abundant number, the 9th highly composite number, a unitary perfect number, and an abundant number. It is the smallest number divisible by the numbers 1 to 6.

The smallest group that is not a solvable is the alternating group A5, which has 60 elements.

There are 60 one-sided hexominoes, the polyominoes made from six squares.

There are 60 seconds in a minute, as well as 60 minutes in a degree.

==In science and technology==

The first fullerene to be discovered was buckminsterfullerene C60, an allotrope of carbon with 60 atoms in each molecule, arranged in a truncated icosahedron. This ball is known as a buckyball, and looks like a soccer ball.

The atomic number of neodymium is 60, and cobalt-60 (60Co) is a radioactive isotope of cobalt.

The electrical utility frequency in western Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, the United States, and several other countries in the Americas is 60 Hz.

An exbibyte (sometimes called exabyte) is 260 bytes.

==Cultural number systems==

The Babylonian cuneiform numerals had a base of 60, inherited from the Sumerian and Akkadian civilizations, and possibly motivated by the large number of divisors that 60 has. The sexagesimal measurement of time and of geometric angles is a legacy of the Babylonian system.

The number system in the Mali Empire was based on 60, reflected in the counting system of the Maasina Fulfulde, a variant of the Fula language spoken in contemporary Mali. The Ekagi of Western New Guinea used base 60, and the sexagenary cycle plays a role in Chinese calendar and numerology.

From Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in Slavic and Baltic languages 60 has its own name &quot;kopa&quot; (, , , , , ), in Germanic languages: , , , , and in refer to 60 = 5 dozen = small gross. This quantity was used in international medieval treaties e.g. for ransom of captured Teutonic Knights.

==In religion==
In Hinduism, the 60th birthday of a man is called Sashti poorthi. A ceremony called Sashti (60) Abda (years) Poorthi (completed) in Sanskrit is conducted to felicitate this birthday. It represents a milestone in his life. There are 60 years mentioned in the historic Indian calendars.

==In other fields==

It is:
* In time, the number of seconds in a minute, and the number of minutes in an hour. (a legacy of the Babylonian number system)
* The number of feet in the standard measurement tool to evaluate an automotive launch on a dragstrip, as the time taken to travel the first of the track.
* The number of miles per hour an automobile accelerates to from rest (0-60) as one of the standard measurements of performance
* The number of years in a sexagenary cycle
* In years of marriage, the diamond wedding anniversary
* The age for senior citizens in some cultures

<text>Robert William Barker (December 12, 1923 – August 26, 2023) was an American media personality and animal rights advocate. He hosted CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, the longest-running game show in North American television history, from 1972 to 2007. Barker also hosted &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; from 1956 to 1975.

Born in Darrington, Washington, in modest circumstances, Barker spent most of his youth on the Rosebud Indian Reservation and was a citizen of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. Barker joined the United States Navy Reserve during World War II. He worked part-time in radio while attending college. In 1950, Barker moved to California to pursue a broadcasting career. He was given his own radio show, &quot;The Bob Barker Show&quot;, which ran for six years. Barker began his game show career in 1956, hosting &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot;.

Barker began hosting &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; in 1972. He became an advocate for animal rights and of animal rights activism, supporting groups such as the United Activists for Animal Rights, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. In 2007, Barker retired from hosting &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; after celebrating his 50-year career on television. Regarded as a pop culture icon, Barker continued to make occasional appearances for several years into his retirement until 2015.

==Early life==
Barker was born in Darrington, Washington, and spent most of his youth on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in Mission, South Dakota. The U.S. Indian Census Rolls, 1885–1940, list Barker as a citizen of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, which the tribe publicly confirmed. His mother, Matilda (&quot;Tillie&quot;) Valandra (née Matilda Kent Tarleton), was a schoolteacher; his father, Byron John Barker, was the foreman on the electrical high line through the state of Washington. As Barker&#x27;s father was one-quarter Sioux, and his mother non-Native, Barker was one-eighth Sioux. Barker attended the grade school on the Rosebud Reservation where his mother was a teacher. Barker once said, &quot;I&#x27;ve always bragged about being part Indian, because they are a people to be proud of. And the Sioux were the greatest warriors of them all.&quot;

Barker met his future wife, Dorothy Jo Gideon, at an Ella Fitzgerald concert while he was attending high school in Missouri; they began dating when he was 15. Barker attended Drury College (now Drury University) in Springfield, Missouri, on a basketball athletic scholarship. He was a member of the Epsilon Beta chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity at Drury. Barker joined the United States Navy Reserve in 1943 during World War II to train as a fighter pilot but did not serve in combat. On January 12, 1945, while on leave from the military, Barker married Dorothy Jo. After the war, he returned to Drury to finish his education, graduating &quot;summa cum laude&quot; with a degree in economics.

==Career==
===Broadcasting===
While attending college in Drury, Barker worked his first media job at KTTS-FM Radio in Springfield. He and his wife left Springfield and moved to Lake Worth Beach, Florida, and Barker was news editor and announcer at nearby WWPG 1340 AM in Palm Beach (now WPBR in Lantana). In 1950, he moved to California to advance his broadcasting career. Barker was given his own radio show, &quot;The Bob Barker Show&quot;, which ran for the next six years from Burbank. He was hosting an audience-participation radio show on KNX (AM) in Los Angeles when game show producer Ralph Edwards, who was looking for a new host to replace Jack Bailey on the daytime-television version of his long-running show, &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot;, happened to be listening and liked Barker&#x27;s voice and style.

===Game shows===
====&quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; (1956–1975)====
Barker started hosting &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; on December 31, 1956, and continued with the program until 1975.

====&quot;The Price Is Right&quot; (1972–2007)====

In early 1972, Mark Goodson and Bill Todman began shopping a modernized revival of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, with Dennis James as host. NBC bought the syndicated nighttime version of the Show first with James at the helm. CBS expressed interest in the series. Due to a contractual obligation and the fact that James was already viewed as the &quot;NBC&quot; Host, CBS wanted Bob Barker as the daytime host. After some initial resistance, Barker instead offered to host another upcoming CBS game show, Jack Barry&#x27;s &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; (which had difficulty finding a host and was scheduled to debut the same day as &quot;Price&quot;) to allow James to host &quot;Price&quot;, but CBS rejected this proposal. In December 1974, James stepped in to host the daytime &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; for a week when Barker was ill. James was the only person to substitute on the daytime version of the show while Barker was hosting. In 1977, James&#x27; contract was not renewed, and Barker took over as host of the nighttime edition of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; until its cancellation in 1980.

On September 4, 1972, Barker began hosting the CBS revival of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;.

On October 15, 1987, Barker did what other MCs almost never did then: he stopped using hair dye and let his hair go gray, its natural color by that time.
On October 31, 2006, Barker announced that he would retire from &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; in June 2007. Barker taped his final episode on June 6, 2007, with the show airing twice on June 15; once in Daytime and once on Primetime. On October 15, 2007, Drew Carey took over hosting duties on the show.

After his retirement, Barker made three return appearances to &quot;The Price is Right&quot;. He first appeared on the episode that aired on April 16, 2009, to promote his new autobiography, &quot;Priceless Memories&quot;. Barker appeared in the Showcase round at the end of the show. Barker made another guest appearance on the show to celebrate his 90th birthday, which aired on December 12, 2013. Barker announced a contestant for the first time ever on the show, along with one showcase. Barker&#x27;s last appearance was a surprise appearance on April 1, 2015, for an April Fools&#x27; Day switch where he took Carey&#x27;s place at the show&#x27;s intro. Barker hosted the first bid and pricing game of that day before handing the hosting duties back to Carey; Barker later appeared during the showcase.

==Personal life==
Barker was married to Dorothy Jo Gideon from 1945 until her death from lung cancer at age 57 in 1981. From 1983 until his death, Barker was in a long-term relationship with Nancy Burnet, an admitted &quot;radical&quot; animal rights activist nearly 20 years younger than Barker. By mutual decision, Barker and Burnet were never married and lived in separate residences throughout their relationship. Barker had no children with either woman, stating that he had seen friends who had poor relationships with their children and felt like he was too busy to properly raise a child; as of 2007, Barker stated that he had no regrets about his decision. From the late 2000s onward, Burnet described the relationship as a platonic friendship, even as Barker had become more interested in remarrying; she recalled a 2011 incident where Barker drafted a prenuptial agreement for Burnet&#x27;s lawyer to review and revise as she felt fit, which she refused. Burnet managed Barker&#x27;s health and diet in retirement.

===Animal rights===
Barker was a vegetarian. In 1982, Barker began ending &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; episodes with the phrase: &quot;This is Bob Barker reminding you to help control the pet populationhave your pets spayed or neutered.&quot; Though Barker had already been dabbling in animal rights before meeting Burnet, his efforts became more aggressive during his relationship with her.

In 1987, Barker requested the removal of fur prizes for the Miss USA pageant and stepped down as host when the producers refused. In 1989, Barker and United Activists for Animal Rights publicly accused several media projects and the American Humane Association of animal mistreatment and condoning animal mistreatment, a tactic which for libel, slander, and invasion of privacy. The suit was finally settled by the insurer in 1994.

Barker founded DJ&amp;T Foundation in 1994, named after his late wife and mother, which has contributed millions of dollars to animal-neutering programs and funded animal rescue and park facilities all over the United States. In 2004, Barker donated $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ) to Columbia Law School to support the study of animal rights.

In 2009, Barker wrote a letter about three businesses in Cherokee, North Carolina, asking them to close their bear exhibits. He threatened to not attend the 2009 Game Show Awards, where Barker was to receive a lifetime achievement award, because Betty White would be attending. Although Barker had previously worked with White, he was feuding with her over the treatment of an elephant at the Los Angeles Zoo. White instead did not attend and pre-recorded her comments that she was scheduled to make about another awardee, Mark Goodson. That same year, Barker donated $1 million (equivalent to $1.4 million in 2021) to the University of Virginia Law School to support the study of animal rights. He made similar donations to Harvard Law School, Stanford Law School, Georgetown University Law Center, Duke University School of Law, Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, and University of California, Los Angeles.

In 2010, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society announced that it had purchased and outfitted a ship to interdict Japanese whaling operations in the Southern Ocean using $5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) provided by Barker. The ship was then named the MY &quot;Bob Barker&quot;, and its existence was first revealed when it helped discover the location of the Japanese whaling fleet.

Barker participated in several PETA public service announcements over the years, including one that claimed that vegan diets prevent Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In 2010, he donated $2.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) toward the purchase of office space for the organization in Los Angeles. The Bob Barker Building opened in 2012.

===Lawsuits===
In the late 1980s, Barker accused the American Humane Society and the United Activists for Animal Rights of condoning animal cruelty on the set of &quot;Project X&quot; and in several other media projects on the basis of allowing a cattle prod and a gun on set, and a rumored beating of a chimpanzee on set. American Humane responded by suing Barker for $10 million, citing libel, slander and invasion of privacy. American Humane claimed that there had been a two-year &quot;vendetta&quot; against them behind the accusations. In a series of public advertisements along with the lawsuit, American Humane responded to Barker&#x27;s claims that his allegations were made based on insufficient and misleading information. The suit was eventually settled by Barker&#x27;s insurance company, which paid American Humane $300,000.

In 1994, former model Dian Parkinson filed a lawsuit against Barker alleging sexual harassment following a three-year affair while working on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. Parkinson, who alleged that she was extorted by threats of firing, later dropped her lawsuit, claiming the stress from the ordeal was damaging her health.

In 1995, model Holly Hallstrom left &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and later filed suit against Barker, alleging that the reason she was fired was not so much because of her medication-mediated weight gain (as documented) but because, to Barker&#x27;s displeasure, she refused to give false information to the media regarding Parkinson&#x27;s suit, as she alleges Barker had requested she do. Barker countersued for slander, but Hallstrom prevailed, receiving a settlement in 2005.

In October 2007, Deborah Curling, a CBS employee assigned to &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, filed a lawsuit against CBS, Bob Barker, and &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; producers, claiming that she was forced to quit her job after testifying against Barker in a wrongful-termination lawsuit brought by a previous show producer. Curling claimed that she was demoted to an &quot;intolerable work environment&quot; backstage, which caused her to leave the job. Curling, who is black, also alleged that the show&#x27;s producers, including Barker, created a hostile work environment in which black employees and contestants were discriminated against. A few months later, Barker was removed from the lawsuit, and in September 2009, the lawsuit was dismissed. Curling&#x27;s attorney stated that he planned to appeal the dismissal of the lawsuit. In January 2012, the California Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal.

===Health and death===
On September 16, 1999, Barker was in Washington, D.C., to testify before Congress regarding proposed legislation that would ban captive elephants from traveling shows, such as circuses. While preparing for the presentation, Barker experienced what he called clumsiness in his right hand. Barker was admitted to George Washington University Hospital and diagnosed with a partially blocked left carotid artery. He underwent carotid endarterectomy to remove the blockage. The procedure went well enough that Barker was able to return to work within the month.

Three years later, Barker had two additional health crises after taping the 30th-season finale of &quot;The Price is Right&quot;. While lying in the sun on May 30, 2002, he experienced a stroke and was hospitalized; six weeks later, on July 11, Barker underwent prostate surgery. Both hospitalizations occurred at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C. and both surgeries were successful.

Barker had several mild bouts with skin cancer, a result of his frequent tanning. Barker consulted a dermatologist regularly to make sure any cancers were caught and removed before they spread; they did not pose a threat to his life. During a televised interview, Barker told viewers, &quot;I urge anyone who has spent some time in the sun, whether you&#x27;re doing it now or not, go to a dermatologist once a year.&quot;

On October 20, 2015, two police officers passing Barker&#x27;s Los Angeles-area home saw him trip and fall on a sidewalk. They called an ambulance which took him to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where Barker received stitches for an injured forehead and was released; he also hurt his left knee.

Barker slipped and hit his head at home on June 19, 2017. His maid drove him to the emergency room, where Barker was checked and released. His representative said it was not as serious as his earlier fall. In October and November 2018, Barker was rushed to the hospital for severe back pain. Barker suffered another fall in January 2019, but he was not hospitalized.

Barker&#x27;s last public interview was with &quot;People&quot; in August 2021, in which he discussed &quot;The Price Is Right&#x27;s&quot; upcoming 50th season on air. As of 2022, Burnet stated that other than some non-prescription supplements such as collagen and a meal replacement drink to replenish nutrients not found naturally in Barker&#x27;s vegetarian diet, he took only one prescription medication for hypothyroidism.

On August 26, 2023, Barker died at his home in Los Angeles at the age of 99 following several years with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, a condition that Burnet and Barker&#x27;s publicity team had kept hidden from the public. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism were listed as secondary causes of death. Barker was interred alongside his wife at Forest Lawn Memorial Park – Hollywood Hills.

<text>George FitzRoy Henry Somerset, 3rd Baron Raglan (18 September 1857 – 24 October 1921), styled The Honourable George Somerset until 1884, was a British soldier and Conservative politician. He served as Under-Secretary of State for War from 1900 to 1902 and was Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man from 1902 to 1919.

==Background and education==
A member of the Somerset family headed by the Duke of Beaufort, Somerset was the son of Richard Somerset, 2nd Baron Raglan, by his first wife Lady Georgina Lygon, third daughter of Henry Lygon, 4th Earl Beauchamp. He was a godchild of George V of Hanover, Somerset became a Page of Honour to Queen Victoria in 1868, which he remained until 1874. He was educated at Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

==Military and political career==
In 1870 Somerset joined the Grenadier Guards. He fought in the Second Anglo-Afghan War, reaching the rank of captain. He served as Under-Secretary of State for War in the Unionist Government headed by Lord Salisbury from 1900 to 1902.

In September 1902 Lord Raglan was appointed Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man. He arrived on the island on 18 October and was sworn in at Castletown on 21 October. During his tenure as Lieutenant Governor he became the Provincial Grand Master of the Freemasons in the Isle of Man from 1912 to 1919 and had the Lord Raglan Lodge No 3685 named in his honour.

Described as &quot;autocratic&quot; and &quot;unpopular&quot;, he opposed campaigns by Manx trade unions for direct taxation to fund an old-age pension and in 1918 ordered the removal of flour subsidies which increased the price of bread 15% above that in England. These actions had a direct effect in generating the July 1918 general strike on the island, which resulted in the passing of an act on direct taxation, reduction in bread prices and the introduction of pensions.

Lord Raglan resigned as Governor on 17 December 1918, citing ill-health.

==Family==
Lord Raglan married Lady Ethel Jemima Ponsonby, daughter of Walter Ponsonby, 7th Earl of Bessborough, on 28 February 1883. Lady Raglan was a one-time President of the Monmouthshire branch of the Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Families&#x27; Association, and died in 1940.
They had six children. He died on 24 October 1921, aged 64, and was succeeded in the barony by his son, Fitzroy.

<doc id="343333" wikidata="Q463529" url="?curid=343333" title="Cotentin Peninsula">
<text>The Cotentin Peninsula (, ; ), also known as the Cherbourg Peninsula, is a peninsula in Normandy that forms part of the northwest coast of France. It extends north-westward into the English Channel, towards Great Britain. To its west lie the Gulf of Saint-Malo and the Channel Islands, and to the southwest lies the peninsula of Brittany.

The peninsula lies wholly within the department of Manche, in the region of Normandy.

==Geography==
The Cotentin peninsula is part of the Armorican Massif (with the exception of the Plain lying in the Paris Basin) and lies between the estuary of the Vire river and Mont Saint-Michel Bay. It is divided into three areas: the headland of Cap de la Hague, the Cotentin Pass (the Plain), and the valley of the Saire River (Val de Saire). It forms the bulk of the department of Manche. Its southern part, known as &quot;le Marais&quot; (the Marshlands), crosses from east to west from just north west of Saint Lo and east of Lessay and marks a natural border with the rest of Manche.

The largest town on the peninsula is Cherbourg-en-Cotentin, a major cross-channel port on the north coast, with a population of approximately 120,000. The population of the peninsula is about 250,000.

The western coast of the peninsula, known as the &quot;Côte des Îles&quot; (&quot;Islands Coast&quot;), faces the Channel Islands. Ferry links serve Carteret and the islands of Jersey, Guernsey and Alderney from Dielette. Off the east coast of the peninsula lies the island of Tatihou and the Îles Saint-Marcouf.

The oldest stone in France is found in outcroppings on the coast of Cap de la Hague, at the tip of the peninsula.

Cotentin was almost an island at one time. Only a small strip of land in the heath of Lessay connected the peninsula with the mainland. Thanks to the so-called &quot;portes à flot&quot; (fr), which close at flood and open at ebb and which were built in the west coast and in the Baie des Veys, on the east coast, the Cotentin has become a peninsula.

The Côte des Havres lies between the Cape of Carteret and the Cape of Granville. To the northwest, there are two sand dune systems: one stretching between Siouville-Hague and Vauville, the other one stretching between Cap of Carteret and Baubigny.

==History==
===Roman Armorica===
The peninsula formed part of the Roman geographical area of Armorica. The town known today as Coutances, capital of the Unelli, a Gaulish tribe, acquired the name of &quot;Constantia&quot; in 298 during the reign of Roman emperor Constantius Chlorus. The base of the peninsula, called in Latin the &quot;pagus Constantinus&quot;, joined together with the &quot;pagus Coriovallensis&quot; centred upon Cherbourg to the north, subsequently became known as the Cotentin. Under the Carolingians it was administered by viscounts drawn successively from members of the Saint-Sauveur family, at their seat Saint-Sauveur on the Douve.

===Medieval history===
King Alan the Great of Brittany (d. 907) waged war successfully on the Norsemen. As a result of his conquests, the Cotentin Peninsula was included theoretically in the territory of the Kingdom of Brittany, after the Treaty of Compiègne (867) with the king of the Franks. The kings of Brittany suffered continuing Norse invasions and Norman raids, and Brittany lost the Cotentin Peninsula (and Avranchin nearby) after only 70 years of political domination.

Meanwhile, Vikings settled on the Cotentin in the ninth and tenth centuries. There are indications of a whaling industry there dating to the ninth century, possibly introduced by Norsemen. They were followed by Anglo-Norse and Anglo-Danish people, who established themselves as farmers. The Cotentin became part of Normandy in the early tenth century. Many placenames there are derived from the Norse language. Examples include La Hague, from &quot;hagi&quot; (&quot;meadow&quot; or &quot;enclosure&quot;), and La Hougue, from &quot;haugr&quot; (&quot;hill&quot; or &quot;mound&quot;). Other names are typical: all those ending with &quot;-tot&quot; (Quettetot..) from &quot;topt&quot; &quot;site of a house&quot; (modern &quot;-toft&quot;), &quot;-bec&quot; (Bricquebec, Houlbec..) from &quot;bekkr&quot; &quot;brook&quot;, &quot;stream&quot;, etc.

In 1088 Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, enfeoffed the Cotentin to his brother Henry, who later became king of England. Henry, as count of the Cotentin, established his first power base there and in the adjoining Avranchin, which lay to the south, beyond the River Thar.

During the Hundred Years War, King Edward III of England landed in the bay of La Hougue, and then went to the Church of Quettehou in Val de Saire. It was there that Edward III knighted his son Edward, the Black Prince. A remembrance plaque can be seen next to the altar.

===Modern history===

The naval Battle of La Hogue in 1692 was fought off Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue near Barfleur.

The town of Valognes was, until the French Revolution, a provincial social resort for the aristocracy, nicknamed the &quot;Versailles of Normandy&quot;. The social scene was described in the novels of Jules Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly (1808–1889) (himself from the Cotentin). Little now remains of the grand houses and châteaux; they were destroyed by combat there during the Battle of Normandy in World War II. The westernmost part of the D-Day landings was at Utah Beach, on the southeastern coast of the peninsula, and was followed by a campaign to occupy the peninsula and take Cherbourg.

The genetic history of the modern inhabitants of Cotentin Peninsula was studied by the University of Leicester in 2015-2016 to determine the extent of Scandinavian ancestry in Normandy. The results were inconclusive.

==Economy==
The peninsula&#x27;s main economic resource is agriculture. Dairy and vegetable farming are prominent activities, as well as aquaculture of oysters and mussels along the coast. Cider and calvados are produced from locally grown apples and pears.

The region hosts two important nuclear power facilities. At Flamanville there is a nuclear power plant, and the La Hague nuclear reprocessing plant is located a few miles to the north, at Beaumont-Hague. The facility stores all high-level waste from the French nuclear power program in one large vault. The nuclear industry provides a substantial portion of jobs in the region. The roads used for transport of nuclear waste have been blocked many times in the past by environmental action group Greenpeace. Local environmental groups have voiced concerns about the radioactivity levels of the cooling water at both these nuclear sites, which is being flushed into the bay of Vauville; however, the emitted radioactivity is several orders of magnitude below natural background levels and does not pose any hazard.

There are two major naval shipyards in Cherbourg. The state-owned shipyard Naval Group has built French nuclear submarines since the 1960s. Privately owned CMN builds frigates and patrol vessels for various states, mostly from the Middle East.

Tourism is also an important economic activity in this region. Many tourists visit the D-Day invasion beaches, including Utah Beach in the Cotentin. At Sainte-Mère-Église a few miles away from the beach, there is a museum commemorating the action of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. The &quot;Cité de la Mer&quot; in Cherbourg is a museum of oceanic and underseas subjects. The main attraction is &quot;Redoutable&quot;, the first French nuclear submarine, launched in 1967.

==Culture==
After quitting political life, the political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville (1805–1859) retreated to the family estate of Tocqueville, where he wrote much of his work.

Due to its comparative isolation, the peninsula is one of the remaining strongholds of the Norman language, and the local dialect is known as Cotentinais. The Norman language poet Côtis-Capel (1915–1986) described the environment of the peninsula, while French language poet Jacques Prévert made his home at Omonville-la-Petite. The painter Jean-François Millet (1814–1875) was also born on the peninsula.

The Norman language writer , native of Cherbourg, composed many songs which form part of the heritage of the region. Rossel&#x27;s song &quot;Sus la mé&quot; (&quot;on the sea&quot;) is often sung as a regional patriotic song.

<text>70 (seventy) is the natural number following 69 and preceding 71.

== Mathematics ==

=== Properties of the integer ===
70 is the fourth discrete sphenic number, as the first of the form formula_1. It is the smallest weird number, a natural number that is abundant but not semiperfect, where it is also the second-smallest primitive abundant number, after 20. 70 is in equivalence with the sum between the smallest number that is the sum of &quot;two&quot; abundant numbers, and the largest that is not (24, 46).

70 is the tenth Erdős–Woods number, since it is possible to find sequences of seventy consecutive integers such that each inner member shares a factor with either the first or the last member. It is also the sixth Pell number, preceding the tenth prime number 29, in the sequence formula_2. 

70 is a palindromic number in bases 9 (779), 13 (5513) and 34 (2234).

==== Happy number ====

70 is the thirteenth happy number in decimal, where 7 is the first such number greater than 1 in base ten: the sum of squares of its digits eventually reduces to 1. For both 7 and 70, there is 

:formula_3

97, which reduces from the sum of squares of digits of 49, is the only prime after 7 in the successive sums of squares of digits (7, 49, 97, 130, 10) before reducing to 1. More specifically, 97 is also the seventh happy prime in base ten. 

70 = 2 × 5 × 7 simplifies to 7 × 10, or the product of the first happy prime in decimal, and the base (10).

==== Aliquot sequence ====
70 contains an aliquot sum of 74, in an aliquot sequence of four composite numbers (70, 74, 40, 50, 43) in the prime 43-aliquot tree.

* The composite index of 70 is 50, which is the first non-trivial member of the 43-aliquot tree.
* 40, the Euler totient of 100, is the second non-trivial member of the 43-aliquot tree. 
* The composite index of 100 is 74 (the aliquot part of 70), the third non-trivial member of the 43-aliquot tree.

The sum 43 + 50 + 40 = 133 represents the one-hundredth composite number, where the sum of all members in this aliquot sequence up to 70 is the fifty-ninth prime, 277 (this prime index value represents the seventeenth prime number and seventh super-prime, 59).

==== Figurate numbers ====
* 70 is the seventh pentagonal number. 
* 70 is also the fourth 13-gonal (tridecagonal) number.
*70 is the fifth pentatope number.

The sum of the first seven prime numbers aside from 7 (i.e., 2, 3, 5, 11, …, 19) is 70; the first four primes in this sequence sum to 21 = 3 × 7, where the sum of the sixth, seventh and eighth indexed primes (in the sequence of prime numbers) 13 + 17 + 19 is the seventh square number, 49.

==== Central binomial coefficient ====
70 is the fourth central binomial coefficient, preceding formula_4, as the number of ways to choose 4 objects out of 8 if order does not matter; this is in equivalence with the number of possible values of an 8-bit binary number for which half the bits are on, and half are off.

=== Geometric properties ===
==== 7-simplex ====
In seven dimensions, the number of tetrahedral cells in a 7-simplex is 70. This makes 70 the central element in a seven by seven matrix configuration of a 7-simplex in seven-dimensional space:

formula_5

Aside from the 7-simplex, there are a total of seventy other uniform 7-polytopes with formula_6 symmetry. The 7-simplex can be constructed as the join of a point and a 6-simplex, whose order is 7!, where the 6-simplex has a total of seventy three-dimensional and two-dimensional elements (there are thirty-five 3-simplex cells, and thirty-five faces that are triangular).

70 is also the fifth pentatope number, as the number of 3-dimensional unit spheres which can be packed into a 4-simplex (or four-dimensional analogue of the regular tetrahedron) of edge-length 5.

==== Leech lattice ====
The sum of the first 24 squares starting from 1 is 70 = 4900, i.e. a square pyramidal number. This is the only non trivial solution to the cannonball problem, and relates 70 to the Leech lattice in twenty-four dimensions and thus string theory.

== In religion ==
* In Jewish tradition, Ptolemy II Philadelphus ordered 72 Jewish elders to translate the Torah into Greek; the result was the Septuagint (from the Latin for &quot;seventy&quot;). The Roman numeral seventy, LXX, is the scholarly symbol for the Septuagint.

* In Islamic history and in Islamic interpretation the number 70 or 72 is most often and generally hyperbole for an infinite amount:
** There are 70 dead among the Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s adversaries during the Battle of Badr.
** 70 of the Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s followers are martyred at the Battle of Uhud.
** In Shia Islam, there are 70 martyrs among Imam Hussein&#x27;s followers during the Battle of Karbala.

== In other fields ==
* In some traditions, 70 years of marriage is marked by a platinum wedding anniversary.
* Under Social Security (United States), the age at which a person can receive the maximum retirement benefits (and may do so and continue working without reduction of benefits).

== Number name ==

Several languages, especially ones with vigesimal number systems, do not have a specific word for 70: for example, ; , short for . (For French, this is true only in France; other French-speaking regions such as Belgium, Switzerland, Aosta Valley and Jersey use .)

<doc id="343335" wikidata="Q2777107" url="?curid=343335" title="Constructible universe">
<text>In mathematics, in set theory, the constructible universe (or Gödel&#x27;s constructible universe), denoted by formula_1 is a particular class of sets that can be described entirely in terms of simpler sets. formula_2 is the union of the constructible hierarchy formula_3. It was introduced by Kurt Gödel in his 1938 paper &quot;The Consistency of the Axiom of Choice and of the Generalized Continuum-Hypothesis&quot;. In this paper, he proved that the constructible universe is an inner model of ZF set theory (that is, of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice excluded), and also that the axiom of choice and the generalized continuum hypothesis are true in the constructible universe. This shows that both propositions are consistent with the basic axioms of set theory, if ZF itself is consistent. Since many other theorems only hold in systems in which one or both of the propositions is true, their consistency is an important result.

==What &quot;L&quot; is==
formula_2 can be thought of as being built in &quot;stages&quot; resembling the construction of the von Neumann universe, formula_5. The stages are indexed by ordinals. In von Neumann&#x27;s universe, at a successor stage, one takes formula_6 to be the set of &quot;all&quot; subsets of the previous stage, formula_7. By contrast, in Gödel&#x27;s constructible universe formula_2, one uses &quot;only&quot; those subsets of the previous stage that are:

*definable by a formula in the formal language of set theory,
*with parameters from the previous stage and,
*with the quantifiers interpreted to range over the previous stage.

By limiting oneself to sets defined only in terms of what has already been constructed, one ensures that the resulting sets will be constructed in a way that is independent of the peculiarities of the surrounding model of set theory and contained in any such model.

Define the Def operator:

formula_9

formula_2 is defined by transfinite recursion as follows:
* formula_11
* formula_12 
* If formula_13 is a limit ordinal, then formula_14 Here formula_15 means formula_16 precedes formula_17.
* formula_18 Here Ord denotes the class of all ordinals.

If formula_19 is an element of formula_3, 
then formula_21. So formula_3 is a subset of formula_23, which is a subset of the power set of formula_3. Consequently, this is a tower of nested transitive sets. But formula_2 itself is a proper class.

The elements of formula_2 are called &quot;constructible&quot; sets; and formula_2 itself is the &quot;constructible universe&quot;. The &quot;axiom of constructibility&quot;, aka &quot;formula_28&quot;, says that every set (of formula_5) is constructible, i.e. in formula_2.

==Additional facts about the sets Lα==
An equivalent definition for formula_3 is:
For any finite ordinal formula_32, the sets formula_33 and formula_34 are the same (whether formula_5 equals formula_2 or not), and thus formula_37 = formula_38: their elements are exactly the hereditarily finite sets. Equality beyond this point does not hold. Even in models of ZFC in which formula_5 equals formula_2, formula_41 is a proper subset of formula_42, and thereafter formula_23 is a proper subset of the power set of formula_3 for all formula_45. On the other hand, formula_28 does imply that formula_7 equals formula_3 if formula_49, for example if formula_50 is inaccessible. More generally, formula_28 implies formula_52 = formula_3 for all infinite cardinals formula_50.

If formula_50 is an infinite ordinal then there is a bijection between formula_3 and formula_50, and the bijection is constructible. So these sets are equinumerous in any model of set theory that includes them.

As defined above, formula_58 is the set of subsets of formula_59 defined by formula_60 formulas (with respect to the Levy hierarchy, i.e., formulas of set theory containing only bounded quantifiers) that use as parameters only formula_59 and its elements.

Another definition, due to Gödel, characterizes each formula_23 as the intersection of the power set of formula_3 with the closure of formula_64 under a collection of nine explicit functions, similar to Gödel operations. This definition makes no reference to definability.

All arithmetical subsets of formula_65 and relations on formula_65 belong to formula_41 (because the arithmetic definition gives one in formula_41). Conversely, any subset of formula_65 belonging to formula_41 is arithmetical (because elements of formula_37 can be coded by natural numbers in such a way that formula_72 is definable, i.e., arithmetic). On the other hand, formula_73 already contains certain non-arithmetical subsets of formula_65, such as the set of (natural numbers coding) true arithmetical statements (this can be defined from formula_41formula_76 so it is in formula_73).

All hyperarithmetical subsets of formula_65 and relations on formula_65 belong to formula_80 (where formula_81 stands for the Church–Kleene ordinal), and conversely any subset of formula_65 that belongs to formula_80 is hyperarithmetical.

== L is a standard inner model of ZFC ==
formula_84 is a standard model, i.e. formula_2 is a transitive class and the interpretation uses the real element relationship, so it is well-founded. formula_2 is an inner model, i.e. it contains all the ordinal numbers of formula_5 and it has no &quot;extra&quot; sets beyond those in formula_5. However formula_2 might be strictly a subclass of formula_5. formula_2 is a model of ZFC, which means that it satisfies the following axioms:
* Axiom of regularity: Every non-empty set formula_92 contains some element formula_93 such that formula_92 and formula_93 are disjoint sets.
: formula_84 is a substructure of formula_97, which is well founded, so formula_2 is well founded. In particular, if formula_99, then by the transitivity of formula_2, formula_101. If we use this same formula_93 as in formula_5, then it is still disjoint from formula_92 because we are using the same element relation and no new sets were added.
* Axiom of extensionality: Two sets are the same if they have the same elements.
: If formula_92 and formula_93 are in formula_2 and they have the same elements in formula_2, then by formula_2&#x27;s transitivity, they have the same elements (in formula_5). So they are equal (in formula_5 and thus in formula_2).
* Axiom of empty set: {} is a set.
: formula_113, which is in formula_114. So formula_115. Since the element relation is the same and no new elements were added, this is the empty set of formula_2.
* Axiom of pairing: If formula_92, formula_93 are sets, then formula_119 is a set.
: If formula_120 and formula_101, then there is some ordinal formula_50 such that formula_123 and formula_124. Then formula_125. Thus formula_126 and it has the same meaning for formula_2 as for formula_5.
* Axiom of union: For any set formula_92 there is a set formula_93 whose elements are precisely the elements of the elements of formula_92.
: If formula_123, then its elements are in formula_3 and their elements are also in formula_3. So formula_93 is a subset of formula_3. Then formula_137. Thus formula_101.
* Axiom of infinity: There exists a set formula_92 such that formula_140 is in formula_92 and whenever formula_93 is in formula_92, so is the union formula_144.
: Transfinite induction can be used to show each ordinal formula_50 is in formula_23. In particular, formula_147 and thus formula_148.
* Axiom of separation: Given any set formula_149 and any proposition formula_150, formula_151 is a set.
: By induction on subformulas of formula_152, one can show that there is an formula_50 such that formula_3 contains formula_149 and formula_156 and (formula_152 is true in formula_3 if and only if formula_152 is true in formula_2), the latter is called the &quot;reflection principle&quot;). So formula_161 = formula_162. Thus the subset is in formula_2.
* Axiom of replacement: Given any set formula_149 and any mapping (formally defined as a proposition formula_165 where formula_165 and formula_167 implies formula_168), formula_169 is a set.
: Let formula_170 be the formula that relativizes formula_152 to formula_2, i.e. all quantifiers in formula_152 are restricted to formula_2. formula_175 is a much more complex formula than formula_175, but it is still a finite formula, and since formula_152 was a mapping over formula_2, formula_175 must be a mapping over formula_5; thus we can apply replacement in formula_5 to formula_175. So formula_183 = formula_184 is a set in formula_5 and a subclass of formula_2. Again using the axiom of replacement in formula_5, we can show that there must be an formula_50 such that this set is a subset of formula_189. Then one can use the axiom of separation in formula_2 to finish showing that it is an element of formula_2
* Axiom of power set: For any set formula_92 there exists a set formula_93, such that the elements of formula_93 are precisely the subsets of formula_92.
: In general, some subsets of a set in formula_2 will not be in formula_2 So the whole power set of a set in formula_2 will usually not be in formula_2. What we need here is to show that the intersection of the power set with formula_2 &quot;is&quot; in formula_2. Use replacement in formula_5 to show that there is an α such that the intersection is a subset of formula_3. Then the intersection is formula_204. Thus the required set is in formula_2.
* Axiom of choice: Given a set formula_92 of mutually disjoint nonempty sets, there is a set formula_93 (a choice set for formula_92) containing exactly one element from each member of formula_92.
: One can show that there is a definable well-ordering of , in particular based on ordering all sets in formula_2 by their definitions and by the rank they appear at. So one chooses the least element of each member of formula_92 to form formula_93 using the axioms of union and separation in formula_2

Notice that the proof that formula_2 is a model of ZFC only requires that formula_5 be a model of ZF, i.e. we do &quot;not&quot; assume that the axiom of choice holds in formula_5.

== L is absolute and minimal ==
If formula_217 is any standard model of ZF sharing the same ordinals as formula_5, then the formula_2 defined in formula_217 is the same as the formula_2 defined in formula_5. In particular, formula_3 is the same in formula_217 and formula_5, for any ordinal formula_50. And the same formulas and parameters in formula_227 produce the same constructible sets in formula_23.

Furthermore, since formula_2 is a subclass of formula_5 and, similarly, formula_2 is a subclass of formula_217, formula_2 is the smallest class containing all the ordinals that is a standard model of ZF. Indeed, formula_2 is the intersection of all such classes.

If there is a &quot;set&quot; formula_217 in formula_5 that is a standard model of ZF, and the ordinal formula_237 is the set of ordinals that occur in formula_217, then formula_239 is the formula_2 of formula_217. If there is a set that is a standard model of ZF, then the smallest such set is such a formula_239. This set is called the minimal model of ZFC. Using the downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, one can show that the minimal model (if it exists) is a countable set.

Of course, any consistent theory must have a model, so even within the minimal model of set theory there are sets that are models of ZF (assuming ZF is consistent). However, those set models are non-standard. In particular, they do not use the normal element relation and they are not well founded.

Because both &quot;formula_2 constructed within formula_2&quot; and &quot;formula_5 constructed within formula_2&quot; result in the real formula_2, and both the formula_2 of formula_239 and the formula_5 of formula_239 are the real formula_239, we get that formula_253 is true in formula_2 and in any formula_239 that is a model of ZF. However, formula_253 does not hold in any other standard model of ZF.

=== L and large cardinals ===
Since formula_257, properties of ordinals that depend on the absence of a function or other structure (i.e. formula_258 formulas) are preserved when going down from formula_5 to formula_2. Hence initial ordinals of cardinals remain initial in formula_2. Regular ordinals remain regular in formula_2. Weak limit cardinals become strong limit cardinals in formula_2 because the generalized continuum hypothesis holds in formula_2. Weakly inaccessible cardinals become strongly inaccessible. Weakly Mahlo cardinals become strongly Mahlo. And more generally, any large cardinal property weaker than 0 (see the list of large cardinal properties) will be retained in formula_2.

However, formula_266 is false in formula_2 even if true in formula_5. So all the large cardinals whose existence implies formula_266 cease to have those large cardinal properties, but retain the properties weaker than formula_266 which they also possess. For example, measurable cardinals cease to be measurable but remain Mahlo in formula_2.

If formula_266 holds in formula_5, then there is a closed unbounded class of ordinals that are indiscernible in formula_2. While some of these are not even initial ordinals in formula_5, they have all the large cardinal properties weaker than formula_266 in formula_2. Furthermore, any strictly increasing class function from the class of indiscernibles to itself can be extended in a unique way to an elementary embedding of formula_2 into formula_2. This gives formula_2 a nice structure of repeating segments.

== L can be well-ordered ==
There are various ways of well-ordering formula_2. Some of these involve the &quot;fine structure&quot; of formula_2, which was first described by Ronald Bjorn Jensen in his 1972 paper entitled &quot;The fine structure of the constructible hierarchy&quot;. Instead of explaining the fine structure, we will give an outline of how formula_2 could be well-ordered using only the definition given above.

Suppose formula_92 and formula_93 are two different sets in formula_2 and we wish to determine whether formula_287 or formula_288. If formula_92 first appears in formula_23 and formula_93 first appears in formula_292 and formula_293 is different from formula_50, then let if and only if formula_295. Henceforth, we suppose that formula_296.

The stage formula_297 uses formulas with parameters from formula_3 to define the sets formula_92 and formula_93. If one discounts (for the moment) the parameters, the formulas can be given a standard Gödel numbering by the natural numbers. If formula_301 is the formula with the smallest Gödel number that can be used to define formula_92, and formula_303 is the formula with the smallest Gödel number that can be used to define formula_93, and formula_303 is different from formula_301, then let if and only if formula_307 in the Gödel numbering. Henceforth, we suppose that formula_308.

Suppose that formula_301 uses formula_32 parameters from formula_3. Suppose formula_156 is the sequence of parameters that can be used with formula_301 to define formula_92, and formula_315 does the same for formula_93. Then let formula_287 if and only if either formula_318 or (formula_319 and formula_320) or (formula_321 and formula_322 and formula_323), etc. This is called the reverse lexicographic ordering; if there are multiple sequences of parameters that define one of the sets, we choose the least one under this ordering. It being understood that each parameter&#x27;s possible values are ordered according to the restriction of the ordering of formula_2 to formula_3, so this definition involves transfinite recursion on formula_50.

The well-ordering of the values of single parameters is provided by the inductive hypothesis of the transfinite induction. The values of formula_32-tuples of parameters are well-ordered by the product ordering. The formulas with parameters are well-ordered by the ordered sum (by Gödel numbers) of well-orderings. And formula_2 is well-ordered by the ordered sum (indexed by formula_50) of the orderings on formula_23.

Notice that this well-ordering can be defined within formula_2 itself by a formula of set theory with no parameters, only the free-variables formula_92 and formula_93. And this formula gives the same truth value regardless of whether it is evaluated in formula_2, formula_5, or formula_217 (some other standard model of ZF with the same ordinals) and we will suppose that the formula is false if either formula_92 or formula_93 is not in formula_2.

It is well known that the axiom of choice is equivalent to the ability to well-order every set. Being able to well-order the proper class formula_5 (as we have done here with formula_2) is equivalent to the axiom of global choice, which is more powerful than the ordinary axiom of choice because it also covers proper classes of non-empty sets.

== has a reflection principle==
Proving that the axiom of separation, axiom of replacement, and axiom of choice hold in formula_2 requires (at least as shown above) the use of a reflection principle for formula_2. Here we describe such a principle.

By induction on formula_344, we can use ZF in formula_5 to prove that for any ordinal formula_50, there is an ordinal formula_347 such that for any sentence formula_348 with formula_349 in formula_350 and containing fewer than formula_32 symbols (counting a constant symbol for an element of formula_350 as one symbol) we get that formula_348 holds in formula_350 if and only if it holds in formula_2.

== The generalized continuum hypothesis holds in L ==
Let formula_356, and let formula_357 be any constructible subset of formula_149. Then there is some formula_293 with formula_360, so for some formula formula_301 and some formula_362 drawn from formula_350. By the downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and Mostowski collapse, there must be some transitive set formula_364 containing formula_3 and some formula_366, and having the same first-order theory as formula_350 with the formula_366 substituted for the formula_362; and this formula_364 will have the same cardinal as formula_3. Since formula_28 is true in formula_350, it is also true in , so formula_374 for some formula_375 having the same cardinal as formula_50. And formula_377 because formula_350 and formula_379 have the same theory. So formula_357 is in fact in formula_381.

So all the constructible subsets of an infinite set formula_149 have ranks with (at most) the same cardinal formula_237 as the rank of formula_149; it follows that if formula_385 is the initial ordinal for formula_386, then formula_387 serves as the &quot;power set&quot; of formula_149 within formula_2 Thus this &quot;power set&quot; formula_390. And this in turn means that the &quot;power set&quot; of formula_149 has cardinal at most formula_392. Assuming formula_149 itself has cardinal formula_237, the &quot;power set&quot; must then have cardinal exactly formula_386. But this is precisely the generalized continuum hypothesis relativized to formula_2.

== Constructible sets are definable from the ordinals ==
There is a formula of set theory that expresses the idea that formula_397. It has only free variables for formula_59 and formula_50. Using this we can expand the definition of each constructible set. If formula_400, then formula_401 for some formula formula_301 and some formula_156 in formula_3. This is equivalent to saying that: for all formula_93, formula_406 if and only if [there exists formula_59 such that formula_408 and formula_409 and formula_410] where formula_411 is the result of restricting each quantifier in formula_412 to formula_59. Notice that each formula_414 for some formula_415. Combine formulas for the formula_19&#x27;s with the formula for formula_149 and apply existential quantifiers over the formula_19&#x27;s outside and one gets a formula that defines the constructible set formula_149 using only the ordinals formula_50 that appear in expressions like formula_421 as parameters.

Example: The set formula_422 is constructible. It is the unique set formula_423 that satisfies the formula:

formula_424

where formula_425 is short for:

formula_426

Actually, even this complex formula has been simplified from what the instructions given in the first paragraph would yield. But the point remains, there is a formula of set theory that is true only for the desired constructible set formula_149 and that contains parameters only for ordinals.

==Relative constructibility==
Sometimes it is desirable to find a model of set theory that is narrow like formula_2, but that includes or is influenced by a set that is not constructible. This gives rise to the concept of relative constructibility, of which there are two flavors, denoted by formula_429 and formula_430.

The class formula_429 for a non-constructible set formula_432 is the intersection of all classes that are standard models of set theory and contain formula_432 and all the ordinals.

formula_429 is defined by transfinite recursion as follows:
*formula_435 = the smallest transitive set containing formula_432 as an element, i.e. the transitive closure of formula_437.
*formula_438 = formula_439
*If formula_440 is a limit ordinal, then formula_441.
*formula_442.

If formula_429 contains a well-ordering of the transitive closure of formula_437, then this can be extended to a well-ordering of formula_429. Otherwise, the axiom of choice will fail in formula_429.

A common example is formula_447, the smallest model that contains all the real numbers, which is used extensively in modern descriptive set theory.

The class formula_430 is the class of sets whose construction is influenced by formula_432, where formula_432 may be a (presumably non-constructible) set or a proper class. The definition of this class uses formula_451, which is the same as formula_452 except instead of evaluating the truth of formulas formula_301 in the model formula_454, one uses the model formula_455 where formula_432 is a unary predicate. The intended interpretation of formula_457 is formula_458. Then the definition of formula_430 is exactly that of formula_2 only with formula_461 replaced by formula_462.

formula_430 is always a model of the axiom of choice. Even if formula_432 is a set, formula_432 is not necessarily itself a member of formula_430, although it always is if formula_432 is a set of ordinals.

The sets in formula_429 or formula_430 are usually not actually constructible, and the properties of these models may be quite different from the properties of formula_2 itself.

<text>80 (eighty) is the natural number following 79 and preceding 81.

== In mathematics ==
80 is:

* the sum of Euler&#x27;s totient function φ(&quot;x&quot;) over the first sixteen integers.
* a semiperfect number, since adding up some subsets of its divisors (e.g., 1, 4, 5, 10, 20 and 40) gives 80.
* a ménage number.
* palindromic in bases 3 (22223), 6 (2126), 9 (889), 15 (5515), 19 (4419) and 39 (2239).
* a repdigit in bases 3, 9, 15, 19 and 39.
* the sum of the first 4 twin prime pairs ((3 + 5) + (5 + 7) + (11 + 13) + (17 + 19)).

The Pareto principle (also known as the 80-20 rule) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

Every solvable configuration of the 15 puzzle can be solved in no more than 80 single-tile moves.

<doc id="343339" wikidata="Q7280" url="?curid=343339" title="Emperor He of Han">
<text>Emperor He of Han (; 79 – 13 February 106) was an emperor of the Chinese Han dynasty who ruled from 88 to 106. He was the 4th emperor of the Eastern Han, and the 20th emperor of the Han dynasty.

Emperor He was a son of Emperor Zhang and, the then Empress Dou. He ascended the throne at the age of nine and ruled for 17 years. It was during Emperor He&#x27;s reign that the Eastern Han dynasty began its decline. Strife between consort clans and eunuchs began when Empress Dowager Dou (Emperor He&#x27;s adoptive mother) made her own family members important government officials. Her family was corrupt and intolerant of dissension. In 92, Emperor He was able to fix the situation by removing the empress dowager&#x27;s brothers with the aid of the eunuch Zheng Zhong and his half-brother Liu Qing the Prince of Qinghe. This in turn created a precedent for eunuchs to be involved in important affairs of state. The trend would continue to escalate for the next century, contributing to the eventual end of the Han dynasty in 220. Further, while Qiang revolts, spurred by corrupt and/or oppressive Han officials, started during his father Emperor Zhang&#x27;s reign, they began to create major problems for the Han during Emperor He&#x27;s reign and would last until the reign of Emperor Ling.

Emperor He himself appeared to be a kind and gentle man. However, he lacked his father&#x27;s and grandfather Emperor Ming&#x27;s acumen for governance and for judgment of character. Although Emperor He&#x27;s reign arguably began Han&#x27;s long decline, notable scientific progress was made during this period, including the invention of paper by the eunuch Cai Lun in 105.
One additional trend that started with Emperor He was the lack of imperial heirs - most of Emperor He&#x27;s sons predeceased him, and at his death he had only two living male children, neither of whom survived long after his death. Whereas many dynasties had succession crises triggered by an emperor&#x27;s many sons vying to succeed him, in the case of the Eastern Han, the crises were triggered by the lack of direct male line heirs, further adding to dynastic instability.

==Family background==
Prince Zhao was born to Emperor Zhang and his concubine Consort Liang in 79. Because Emperor Zhang&#x27;s favourite, Empress Dou, had no sons of her own, she adopted Prince Zhao as her own son; in doing so, she might have been inspired by her mother-in-law, Empress Ma, who had adopted Emperor Zhang, born of Emperor Ming&#x27;s concubine Consort Jia. By the time Prince Zhao was born, his older brother Liu Qing, born of another concubine, Consort Song, had already been created crown prince. However, Empress Dou dearly wanted to make her adopted son crown prince as well as to eliminate Consort Song and her younger sister, also an imperial consort, as competition for Emperor Zhang&#x27;s affection.

In 82, an opportunity came for Empress Dou. Consort Song, the mother of Crown Prince Qing, had become ill, and in her illness, she craved raw cuscuta, and she requested that her family bring her some. Empress Dou seized the cuscuta and accused Consort Song and her sister of using it for witchcraft. Emperor Zhang was enraged and expelled Crown Prince Qing from the palace. He had both Consort Song and her sister arrested and interrogated by the eunuch Cai Lun. Following this they committed suicide by poison. Crown Prince Qing was deposed and created the Prince of Qinghe instead; he was replaced by Prince Zhao as crown prince. Prince Zhao, however, was friendly to his brother, and they often spent time together.

The Song sisters would not be Empress Dou&#x27;s only victims. After Prince Zhao was made crown prince, his birth mother&#x27;s clan, the Liangs, did not dare to openly celebrate, but were secretly happy. When the Dou clan heard of this, they were displeased and fearful, and they felt that they had to destroy the Liangs. Empress Dou began to give false reports about Prince Zhao&#x27;s birth mother Consort Liang and her sister, also an imperial consort, and they lost Emperor Zhang&#x27;s favour. In 83, the Dou clan further submitted anonymous accusations against the father of both Consorts Liang, Liang Song (), who died in prison. The two Liang sisters died of sadness and fear.

In 88, Emperor Zhang died, and Crown Prince Zhao succeeded to the throne at age nine.

==Early reign under the shadow of the Dous==
The boy Emperor He had no real powers; these powers were in the hands of Empress Dowager Dou, and her brothers Dou Xian, Dou Du (), Dou Jing (), and Dou Gui (). Of her brothers, Dou Gui alone was humble and unassuming, but the other three, particularly Dou Xian, were arrogant, using their connection to the empress dowager to intimidate other officials into submission.

Late in 88, however, a crime that Dou Xian committed threatened to cause even Empress Dowager Dou to want him executed. Liu Chang (), the Marquess of Duxiang, was favoured by Empress Dowager Dou for his intelligence, and Dou Xian became fearful that Liu will reduce his power and influence. He therefore had Liu assassinated and blamed Liu&#x27;s brother Liu Gang (), the Marquess of Li. Several judges who were unafraid of Dou Xian, however, carried out a thorough investigation, and Dou Xian&#x27;s involvement was discovered. Empress Dowager Dou was enraged, and she put Dou Xian under arrest, and Dou Xian offered to lead an army against the North Xiongnu (Xiongnu having been divided into two since the times of Emperor Guangwu, with South Xiongnu being a loyal vassal and North Xiongnu being a constant nuisance, at most) to atone for his crimes.

Empress Dowager Dou agreed, and Dou Xian led an army and crushed the North Xiongnu in 89. After this great military victory, he became even more arrogant, and regained the support of Empress Dowager Dou. He had another major victory over the North Xiongnu in 91, essentially wiping North Xiongnu out as a political entity. As a result, Dou Xian so dominated the government that all dissenting officials faced the threat of demotion or even death.

==The coup d&#x27;etat against the Dous==
In 92, however, the Dous would suddenly fall as the result of a coup d&#x27;etat. The details are unclear, but it appeared that Emperor He, perhaps encouraged by his brother Prince Qing (whose mother had died at the Dous&#x27; hand and whose status as crown prince had been stripped away by their machinations) and the eunuch Zheng Zhong ().

Based on the traditional historical accounts, some of the Dous&#x27; relatives (but not the Dous themselves) had considered murdering the emperor. (The utter lack of motive, however, has led modern historians to generally discredit this assertion.) Emperor He, fearful of being murdered, planned along with Zheng and Liu Qing to destroy the Dous&#x27; power. They received some help—in the form of historical accounts that would inspire them as to what to do—from another brother of the emperor, Liu Kang (), the Prince of Qiancheng.

In the summer, Emperor He made a sudden move, issuing an edict ordering the imperial guards to go on alert and to close the gates of the capital Luoyang. The Dous&#x27; relatives who were accused of plotting to murder the emperor were executed. An imperial messenger was sent to seize Dou Xian&#x27;s seal as the commander of the armed forces. All of the empress dowager&#x27;s brothers were sent back to their march but under close guard—the emperor wanted to execute them but did not want to do so publicly, so once they returned to their marches, he ordered all of them, except for the more humble Dou Gui, to commit suicide.

==Late reign==
After the coup d&#x27;état against the Dous, Emperor He appeared to actually take power. Empress Dowager Dou lost all power, although he continued to honour her as his mother, apparently having some inkling but not knowing for sure that she was not his birth mother. Prince Qing became a trusted advisor, as did Zheng. This officially started the trend of palace eunuchs being involved in important matters of state within the government, which would contribute in part to the eventual end of the Han Dynasty in 220. In 102, Zheng was created marquess, in an unprecedented action. In the aftermath of the coup d&#x27;état, innumerable officials accused of being the Dous&#x27; associates were arrested or removed from their posts. The chief among them were the historian Ban Gu, who was a chief assistant of Dou Xian and who had apparently been complicit in Dou&#x27;s autocracy, as well as the commander of the armed forces Song You (), although Ban Gu&#x27;s brother Ban Chao was not affected and continued to enjoy imperial support in his Xiyu campaigns. In 97, Ban Chao sent his assistant Gan Ying () (Kan Ying) on a mission to the Roman Empire—but Gan turned back after reaching an unnamed shore in the Parthian Empire, which might have been the shore of the Persian Gulf—without reaching Rome. In 102, after Ban Chao&#x27;s retirement, however, mismanagement led the Xiyu kingdoms to rebel against Han authority, and the suzerainty over Xiyu was lost.

The reign of Emperor He was generally one free of major corruption, and the young emperor was himself humble and unassuming. He also appeared to genuinely care for the people. However, he was also undistinguished as an emperor, as he appeared to lack the abilities of his father and grandfather in actively doing what was good for the people.

In 97, Empress Dowager Dou died. It was only at this time that officials revealed to Emperor He that he was born of Consort Liang. He sought out her brothers and honoured them with powerful posts—and from this point on, the Liang clan would become one of the most powerful in the Eastern Han aristocracy. He also posthumously rewarded her with an empress title. However, he rejected a suggestion that Empress Dowager Dou be posthumously demoted, and he buried her with full imperial honours with his father Emperor Zhang. (He also posthumously honoured his brother Prince Qing&#x27;s mother with lesser honours and awarded her brothers with minor posts.)

===Issues with the Qiang===
Qiang rebellions — a persistent problem for the Eastern Han - also took place during Emperor He&#x27;s reign. (They had first started during his father Emperor Zhang&#x27;s reign, but were not a major problem until his reign.) In 92, when the official in charge of Qiang affairs, Deng Xun () died, the Qiang had been pacified apparently by Deng&#x27;s good governing tactics, but after Deng&#x27;s death, the new official Nie Shang () apparently inadvertently offended the Qiang chief Mitang (), and Mitang rebelled. In 93, the new official in charge of Qiang affairs, Guan You (), was able to defeat Mitang by alienating the other tribes from Mitang&#x27;s own, but Mitang was not captured and remained a threat. After Guan&#x27;s death, his successor Shi Chong (), indeed, would suffer major losses against Mitang. Mitang, however, would eventually surrender in 98 after running out of allies, and Emperor He in fact received Mitang in an official audience that year. In 100, however, Mitang, suspicious of Han officials&#x27; intentions in ordering him to move a long distance—under the rationale that his people were then living on poor soil and the new location provided better opportunities—rebelled again. However, for the rest of his years, Mitang would basically be a nuisance and not a major threat.

===Marital issues===
In 96, Emperor He created one of his favourites, Consort Yin—who came from the noble lineage of a brother of Emperor Guangwu&#x27;s wife, Empress Yin Lihua—empress. She was described as beautiful but short and clumsy, and also jealous. In particular, she became jealous of another of Emperor He&#x27;s favourites, Consort Deng Sui, who also came from a noble lineage, as a granddaughter of Emperor Guangwu&#x27;s prime minister Deng Yu (). Consort Deng was described to have tried to alleviate this situation by acting humbling before Empress Yin, but this further drew her wrath. Once, when Emperor He was ill, Empress Yin made the remark that if she became empress dowager, the Dengs would be slaughtered—and upon hearing that remark, Consort Deng considered committing suicide, and one of her ladies in waiting saved her by falsely telling her that the emperor had recovered. However, the emperor did soon recover, so Consort Deng and her family escaped a terrible fate.

In 102, Empress Yin and her grandmother, Deng Zhu (), were accused of using witchcraft to curse imperial consorts (probably including Consort Deng). Lady Deng and her sons, as well as Empress Yin&#x27;s brother Yin Fu (), died under interrogation and torture. Empress Yin was deposed, and her father Yin Gang () committed suicide. The rest of her family was exiled. She herself died in sorrow, probably in 102 as well.

After Empress Yin was deposed, Consort Deng was created empress. While she was empress, she constantly rejected Emperor He&#x27;s offers to promote her brothers, so they did not have much power during Emperor He&#x27;s reign.

===Death and succession problems===
Empress Deng and all of the imperial consorts were sonless for a long time. (Emperor He was described to have had a number of sons who died in young age; it is unclear whether Empresses Yin or Deng ever gave birth, but it appears that they did not.) Late in Emperor He&#x27;s reign, he had two sons—whose mothers were not mentioned in history—Liu Sheng () and Liu Long (). Under the superstition of the time, it was thought that they might survive better if they grew up outside the palace in light of their other brothers&#x27; early deaths, so both were given to foster parents.

In February 106, Emperor He died. At that time, Liu Sheng, the older son, was still young (but actual age is not recorded in history) and believed to be constantly ill. The younger, Liu Long, was only 100 days old. Both were welcomed back to the palace, and Empress Deng created Liu Long crown prince, believing that he would be healthier. On the night of Emperor He&#x27;s death, Liu Long was proclaimed emperor, as Emperor Shang. On 27 April 106, Emperor He was buried and given the temple name &quot;Muzong&quot;.

Emperor Shang would only live to age one, however, and died later in September 106. After Emperor Shang&#x27;s death, Empress Dowager Deng was apprehensive that Liu Sheng might resent her for not making him emperor first, refused to make him emperor, but made Prince Qing&#x27;s son Liu Hu () emperor, as Emperor An.

In 190, during the reign of Emperor Xian of Han, Emperor He&#x27;s temple name was revoked.

<text>90 (ninety) is the natural number following 89 and preceding 91.

In the English language, the numbers 90 and 19 are often confused, as they sound very similar. When carefully enunciated, they differ in which syllable is stressed: 19 /naɪnˈtiːn/ vs 90 /ˈnaɪnti/. However, in dates such as 1999, and when contrasting numbers in the teens and when counting, such as 17, 18, 19, the stress shifts to the first syllable: 19 /ˈnaɪntiːn/.

== In mathematics ==
Ninety is a pronic number as it is the product of 9 and 10, and along with 12 and 56, one of only a few pronic numbers whose digits in decimal are also successive. 90 is divisible by the sum of its base-ten digits, which makes it the thirty-second Harshad number.

=== Properties of the number ===

*90 is the only number to have an aliquot sum of 144 = 122. 

*Only three numbers have a set of divisors that generate a sum equal to 90, they are 40, 58, and 89. 

*90 is also the twentieth abundant and highly abundant number (with 20 the first primitive abundant number and 70 the second).

*The number of divisors of 90 is 12. As no smaller number has more than 12 divisors, 90 is a largely composite number.

*90 is the tenth and largest number to hold an Euler totient value of 24; no number has a totient that is 90, which makes it the eleventh nontotient (with 50 the fifth). 

The twelfth triangular number 78 is the only number to have an aliquot sum equal to 90, aside from the square of the twenty-fourth prime, 892 (which is centered octagonal). 90 is equal to the fifth sum of &quot;non-triangular&quot; numbers, respectively between the fifth and sixth triangular numbers, 15 and 21 (equivalently 16 + 17 ... + 20). It is also twice 45, which is the ninth triangular number, and the second-smallest sum of twelve non-zero integers, from two through thirteen formula_1.

90 can be expressed as the sum of distinct non-zero squares in six ways, more than any smaller number (see image):

formula_2.

The square of eleven 112 = 121 is the ninetieth indexed composite number, where the sum of integers formula_3 is 65, which in-turn represents the composite index of 90. In the fractional part of the decimal expansion of the reciprocal of 11 in base-10, &quot;90&quot; repeats periodically (when leading zeroes are moved to the end).

The eighteenth Stirling number of the second kind formula_4 is 90, from a formula_5 of 6 and a formula_6 of 3, as the number of ways of dividing a set of six objects into three non-empty subsets. 90 is also the sixteenth Perrin number from a sum of 39 and 51, whose difference is 12.

==== Prime sextuplets ====

The members of the first prime sextuplet (7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23) generate a sum equal to 90, and the difference between respective members of the first and second prime sextuplets is also 90, where the second prime sextuplet is (97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113). The last member of the second prime sextuplet, 113, is the 30th prime number. Since prime sextuplets are formed from prime members of lower order prime &quot;k&quot;-tuples, 90 is also a record maximal gap between various smaller pairs of prime &quot;k&quot;-tuples (which include quintuplets, quadruplets, and triplets).

==== Unitary perfect number ====

90 is the third unitary perfect number (after 6 and 60), since it is the sum of its unitary divisors excluding itself, and because it is equal to the sum of a subset of its divisors, it is also the twenty-first semiperfect number.

=== Right angle ===

An angle measuring 90 degrees is called a right angle. In normal space, the interior angles of a rectangle measure 90 degrees each, while in a right triangle, the angle opposing the hypotenuse measures 90 degrees, with the other two angles adding up to 90 for a total of  degrees.

=== Icosahedral symmetry ===

==== Solids ====

The rhombic enneacontahedron is a zonohedron with a total of 90 rhombic faces: 60 broad rhombi akin to those in the rhombic dodecahedron with diagonals in formula_7 ratio, and another 30 slim rhombi with diagonals in formula_8 golden ratio. The obtuse angle of the broad rhombic faces is also the dihedral angle of a regular icosahedron, with the obtuse angle in the faces of golden rhombi equal to the dihedral angle of a regular octahedron and the tetrahedral vertex-center-vertex angle, which is also the angle between Plateau borders: 109.471°. It is the dual polyhedron to the rectified truncated icosahedron, a near-miss Johnson solid. On the other hand, the final stellation of the icosahedron has 90 edges. It also has 92 vertices like the rhombic enneacontahedron, when interpreted as a simple polyhedron. Meanwhile, the truncated dodecahedron and truncated icosahedron both have 90 edges. A further four uniform star polyhedra (U37, U55, U58, U66) and four uniform compound polyhedra (UC32, UC34, UC36, UC55) contain 90 edges or vertices.

==== Witting polytope ====

The self-dual Witting polytope contains ninety van Oss polytopes such that sections by the common plane of two non-orthogonal hyperplanes of symmetry passing through the center yield complex 3{4}3 Möbius–Kantor polygons. The root vectors of simple Lie group E8 are represented by the vertex arrangement of the formula_9 polytope, which shares 240 vertices with the Witting polytope in four-dimensional complex space. By Coxeter, the incidence matrix configuration of the Witting polytope can be represented as:

:formula_10 or formula_11

This Witting configuration when reflected under the finite space formula_12 splits into 85 = 45 + 40 points &quot;and&quot; planes, alongside 27 + 90 + 240 = 357 lines.

Whereas the rhombic enneacontahedron is the zonohedrification of the regular dodecahedron, a honeycomb of Witting polytopes holds vertices isomorphic to the E8 lattice, whose symmetries can be traced back to the regular icosahedron via the icosian ring.

=== Cutting an annulus ===

The maximal number of pieces that can be obtained by cutting an annulus with twelve cuts is 90 (and equivalently, the number of 12-dimensional polyominoes that are &quot;prime&quot;).

<text>High-altitude military parachuting, or military free fall (MFF), is a method of delivering military personnel, military equipment, and other military supplies from a transport aircraft at a high altitude via free-fall parachute insertion. Two techniques are used: HALO (high altitude – low opening, often called a HALO jump) and HAHO (high altitude – high opening).

In the HALO technique, the parachutist opens the parachute at a low altitude after free-falling for a period of time, while in the HAHO technique, the parachutist opens the parachute at a high altitude just a few seconds after jumping from the aircraft.

Although HALO techniques were first developed in the 1960s for military use, in recent years HALO parachute designs have been more widely used in non-military applications, including as a form of skydiving.

In military operations, HALO is also used for delivering equipment, supplies, or personnel, while HAHO is generally used exclusively for personnel. In typical HALO/HAHO insertions the troops jump from altitudes between . Military parachutists will often reach a terminal velocity of , allowing for a jump time under two minutes.

== High-altitude low-opening – HALO ==
The origins of the HALO technique date to 1951 during the Korean War. John K. Singlaub, CIA deputy chief of station in Seoul wanted to use bomber aircraft for agent drops in CIA covert-action operations. Singlaub used an air force B-26 out of a FOB on Yeongheungdo Island and re-rigged the bomb bay as a jump platform. After he conducted a series of proof of concept test jumps, Singlaub borrowed an air force L-19 Bird Dog and made a series of high-altitude low-opening test jumps over the Han River.

In 1960, the United States Air Force began conducting experiments that followed earlier work by Colonel John Stapp in the late 1940s through early 1950s on survivability for pilots ejecting at high altitude. Stapp, a research biophysicist and medical doctor, used himself in rocket sled tests to study the effects of very high g-forces. Stapp also solved many of the problems of high-altitude flight in his earliest work for the U.S. Air Force and subjected himself to exposure to altitudes of up to . He later helped develop pressure suits and ejection seats, which have been used in jets ever since. As part of the experiments, on August 16, 1960, Colonel Joseph Kittinger performed the first high-altitude jump at above the Earth&#x27;s surface. Kittinger&#x27;s friend and United States Naval Parachute Test Jumper Joe Crotwell was also among the consultants and test jumpers of the original program. The first time the technique was used for combat was during the Vietnam War in Laos by members of MACV-SOG Recon Team Florida. SEAL Teams of the United States Navy expanded the HALO technique to include delivery of boats and other large items.

The technique is used to airdrop supplies, equipment, or personnel at high altitudes, where aircraft can fly above surface-to-air missile (SAM) engagement levels through enemy skies without posing a threat to the transport or load. In the event that anti-aircraft cannons are active near the drop zone, the HALO technique also minimizes the parachutist&#x27;s exposure to flak.

For military cargo airdrops, the rigged load is cut free and rolls out of the plane as a result of gravity. The load then proceeds to fall under canopy to a designated drop zone.

In a typical HALO exercise, the parachutist will jump from the aircraft, free-fall for a period of time at terminal velocity, and open their parachute at an altitude as low as AGL depending on the mission. The combination of high downward speed, minimal forward airspeed, and the use of only small amounts of metal helps to defeat radar and reduces the amount of time a parachute might be visible to ground observers, enabling a stealthy insertion.

== High-altitude high-opening – HAHO ==
The HAHO technique is used to airdrop personnel at high altitudes when aircraft are unable to fly above enemy skies without posing a threat to the jumpers. In addition, HAHO parachute jumps are employed in the covert insertion of military personnel (generally special operations forces) into enemy territory, in circumstances where the covert nature of an operation may be compromised by the loud noise of parachutes opening at low altitude.

HAHO jumps also allow a longer travel distance due to increased under-canopy time, allowing travelling distances of more than .

In a typical HAHO exercise, the jumper will jump from the aircraft and deploy the parachute immediately after exiting the aircraft. The jumper will use a compass or GPS device for guidance while flying for 30 or more miles (50 kilometers). The jumper must use way points and terrain features to navigate to their desired landing zone and correct their course to account for changes in wind speed and direction. If deploying as a team, the team will form up in a stack while airborne with their parachutes. Usually, the jumper in the lowest position will set the travel course and act as a guide for the other team members. HAHO insertions (excluding training) are intended to be executed at night.

Whilst in the British Special Forces (22 SAS), due to his extensive skydiving background, Charles &quot;Nish&quot; Bruce was pivotal in the original trials and development of the HAHO tactic now routinely used as a conflict insert for special forces.

== Military free-fall – MFF ==
In the United States, military personnel who intend to participate in high-altitude military operations must undergo intense training with strict rules and regulations. Military free-fall is one of the most dangerous and physically demanding skills in special operations. MFF operations are typically done under the cover of darkness, so as to hide the operator&#x27;s presence from opposing forces.

The transition into being military free-fall certified starts with successfully completing the static-line certification at Fort Moore, Georgia. The military free-fall course is instructed at Yuma Proving Ground and spans four weeks. The first week of the course students will learn how to stabilize their body in flight in a specially constructed vertical wind tunnel.

== Health risks ==

All types of parachuting techniques are dangerous, but HALO/HAHO carry special risks. At high altitudes (greater than ), the partial pressure of oxygen in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is low. Oxygen is required for human respiration and lack of pressure can lead to hypoxia. Rapid ascent in the jump aircraft without flushing sufficient nitrogen from the bloodstream and other body tissues can lead to decompression sickness, also known as caisson disease or &quot;the bends&quot;. Since altitude decompression is a form of decompression from saturation, the risk of decompression sickness remains in slow tissues. A longer period of oxygen prebreathing or altitude acclimatisation is necessary to eliminate risk completely. The procedures used for preparation for extravehicular activity in space suits are relevant.

A typical HAHO exercise will require a pre-breathing period (30–45 minutes) prior to jump where the jumper breathes 100% oxygen in order to flush nitrogen from their bloodstream. Also, a HAHO jumper will employ an oxygen bottle during the jump. Danger can come from medical conditions affecting the jumper. Other factors increasing risk include tobacco smoking, alcohol and drug use (including antihistamines, sedatives, and analgesics), anemia, carbon monoxide, fatigue and anxiety can all lead to a jumper being more susceptible to hypoxia. In addition, problems with the oxygen bottle and during the changeover from the pre-breather to the oxygen bottle can result in the return of nitrogen to the jumper&#x27;s bloodstream and, therefore, an increased likelihood of decompression sickness A jumper suffering from hypoxia may lose consciousness and therefore be unable to open the parachute.

Another risk is from the low ambient temperatures prevalent at higher altitudes. At an altitude of , the jumper faces temperatures of , and can experience frostbite. However, HAHO jumpers generally wear polypropylene knit undergarments and other warm clothing under a windproof shell to prevent this.

HALO carries the additional risk that if the parachute fails to deploy or lines become tangled, there is less time to resort to the reserve (back-up parachute) or untangle the lines.

A retrospective study pinpointed 134 parachutists with 141 injuries. All these injuries were a result of members in HALO training. The most common injuries found were fractures, which accounted for 35% of the total injuries. Muscle sprains accounted for 34.7% of injuries. Other proportionally higher injuries were dislocations at 9.9%, contusions at 7.8%, and cuts and lacerations at 4.9%. The article also noted that two deaths occurred while the study was being conducted.

== Example of use ==
* The first combat high-altitude jump took place during the Vietnam War on 28 November 1970, when a six-man MACV-SOG team from Recon Team Florida parachuted from a C-130 at into Laos.
* On 14 October 1990, while President George H. W. Bush was at Camp David, a team of operators from 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment–Delta conducted a successful low-level pull HALO drop on the White House as part of an exercise to test the Secret Service response to an attack on principal.
* BJ Worth, a professional stuntman doubling as James Bond, is shown in the 1997 film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; performing a HALO jump.
* In November 2001, a small team of U.S. troops from the 75th Ranger Regiment Regimental Reconnaissance Company freefall parachuted into Afghanistan in order to establish a landing strip.
* In 2002, United States Air Force Pararescue jumpers conducted a HALO jump in Afghanistan as a means of reaching a gravely wounded member of the Australian Special Air Service who was stranded in a minefield.
* Free fall parachute insertions were utilized during the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, as a means of bypassing enemy early warning systems.
* In 2009, during the rescue of Captain Richard Phillips off the coast of Somalia, a team of U.S. Navy SEALs carried out a nighttime HALO jump into the sea in order to reach USS &quot;Bainbridge&quot; which was towing a lifeboat containing Philips&#x27; hostage takers.
* In 2012, U.S. Navy SEALs used the technique to insert into Somalia to rescue two hostages being held by pirates near the town of Adow.
* Tom Cruise became the first actor to perform a HALO jump on camera for the 2018 film &quot;&quot;.

<text>Emperor Shang of Han (; late October or early November 105 – 21 September 106) was an infant emperor of the Chinese Han dynasty and the fifth emperor of the Eastern Han.

Born Liu Long, the infant was placed on the throne by the Empress Dowager Deng Sui when he was barely 100 days old, despite him having an older brother, Liu Sheng ().

Empress Dowager Deng also kept Liu Hu () – the twelve-year-old cousin of the young emperor and future Emperor An of Han – in the capital Luoyang as insurance against the emperor&#x27;s death. Liu Hu ascended to the throne when Emperor Shang died in September 106; however, Dowager Deng still remained as the regent for the teenager Emperor An. A decree by Empress Dowager Deng during this reign shed light on bureaucratic inefficiency.

Emperor Shang&#x27;s reign, like his father&#x27;s before him, was once again marred by corrupt eunuchs interfering themselves in important matters of state.

==Early life==
Prince Liu Long was born in autumn 105 to Emperor He and a concubine whose identity is unknown. Because Emperor He had, during his reign, frequently lost sons due to childhood illnesses, according to the superstitions of the time, both Prince Long and his older brother Prince Sheng were given to foster parents outside the palace to nurture.

When Emperor He died in February 106, his wife, Empress Deng Sui, brought the young princes back to the palace. Prince Sheng was older but regarded as frequently ill and unfit for the throne; therefore Empress Deng created the infant Prince Long crown prince and soon after had him proclaimed Emperor Shang, with Empress Deng acting as empress dowager.

==Reign==
After Emperor Shang was proclaimed emperor, his brother Prince Sheng was created the Prince of Pingyuan.

Concerned that Emperor Shang might not live long, Empress Dowager Deng also kept Liu Hu () – the twelve-year-old cousin of the young emperor and future Emperor An of Han – in the capital Luoyang as insurance against the emperor&#x27;s death. Prince Hu was viewed by some as the rightful heir to Emperor He, as he was the son of Prince Qing of Qinghe, who was once a crown prince under Emperor He&#x27;s father Emperor Zhang but was deposed due to machinations of Emperor Zhang&#x27;s wife Empress Dou.

As Emperor Shang was an infant, actual and formal power were vested with Empress Dowager Deng. Her brother Deng Zhi () became the most powerful official in the imperial government. During the short reign, Empress Dowager Deng issued a general pardon to those who had had rights stripped from them for associating with the family of Empress Dou.

=== Death ===
In September 106, Emperor Shang died. The officials had by this time realized that his older brother, Prince Sheng, was not as ill as originally thought and therefore wanted to make him emperor. However, Empress Dowager Deng was concerned that Prince Sheng might bear a grudge at not being made emperor before his brother, and therefore insisted on making Emperor Shang&#x27;s cousin, Prince Hu, emperor instead.

Emperor Shang, having died as a toddler, was not given a separate tomb, as is customary for emperors. Rather, in order to avoid unnecessary expenses, he was buried in the same tomb complex as his father Emperor He.

Prince Hu ascended to the throne – with the posthumous name &quot;Emperor An&quot; – when Emperor Shang died in 106; however, Dowager Deng still remained as the regent for the teenager Emperor An. A decree by Empress Dowager Deng during this reign shed light on bureaucratic inefficiency.
