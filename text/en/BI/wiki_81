<text>In economics, aggregate demand (AD) or domestic final demand (DFD) is the total demand for final goods and services in an economy at a given time. It is often called effective demand, though at other times this term is distinguished. This is the demand for the gross domestic product of a country. It specifies the amount of goods and services that will be purchased at all possible price levels. Consumer spending, investment, corporate and government expenditure, and net exports make up the aggregate demand.

The aggregate demand curve is plotted with real output on the horizontal axis and the price level on the vertical axis. While it is theorized to be downward sloping, the Sonnenschein–Mantel–Debreu results show that the slope of the curve cannot be mathematically derived from assumptions about individual rational behavior. Instead, the downward sloping aggregate demand curve is derived with the help of three macroeconomic assumptions about the functioning of markets: Pigou&#x27;s wealth effect, Keynes&#x27; interest rate effect and the Mundell–Fleming exchange-rate effect. The Pigou effect states that a higher price level implies lower real wealth and therefore lower consumption spending, giving a lower quantity of goods demanded in the aggregate. The Keynes effect states that a higher price level implies a lower real money supply and therefore higher interest rates resulting from relevant market equilibrium condition, in turn resulting in lower investment spending on new physical capital and hence a lower quantity of goods being demanded in the aggregate.

The Mundell–Fleming exchange-rate effect is an extension of the IS–LM model. Whereas the traditional IS-LM Model deals with a closed economy, Mundell–Fleming describes a small open economy. The Mundell–Fleming model portrays the short-run relationship between an economy&#x27;s nominal exchange rate, interest rate, and output (in contrast to the closed-economy IS–LM model, which focuses only on the relationship between the interest rate and output).

The aggregate demand curve illustrates the relationship between two factors: the quantity of output that is demanded and the aggregate price level. Aggregate demand is expressed contingent upon a fixed level of the nominal money supply. There are many factors that can shift the AD curve. Rightward shifts result from increases in the money supply, in government expenditure, or in autonomous components of investment or consumption spending, or from decreases in taxes.

According to the aggregate demand-aggregate supply model, when aggregate demand increases, there is movement up along the aggregate supply curve, giving a higher level of prices.

==History==

John Maynard Keynes in &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot; argued during the Great Depression that the loss of output by the private sector as a result of a systemic shock (the Wall Street crash of 1929) ought to be filled by government spending. First, he argued that with a lower &#x27;effective aggregate demand&#x27;, or the total amount of spending in the economy (lowered in the Crash), the private sector could subsist on a permanently reduced level of activity and involuntary unemployment, unless there were active intervention. Business lost access to capital, so it had dismissed workers. This meant workers had less to spend as consumers, consumers bought less from business, which because of additionally reduced demand, had found the need to dismiss workers. The downward spiral could only be halted and rectified by external action. Second, people with higher incomes have a lower average propensity to consume their incomes. People with lower incomes are inclined to spend their earnings immediately to buy housing, food, transport and so forth, while people with much higher incomes cannot consume everything. They save instead, which means that the velocity of money, meaning the circulation of income through different hands in the economy, is decreased. This lowered the rate of growth. Spending should therefore target public works programmes on a large enough scale to speed up growth to its previous levels.

==Components==
An aggregate demand curve is the sum of individual demand curves for different sectors of the economy. The aggregate demand is usually described as a linear sum of four separable demand sources:
: formula_1
where
* formula_2 is consumption (may also be known as consumer spending), which is given by formula_3 where formula_4 is consumers&#x27; income and formula_5 the taxes paid by consumers,
* formula_6 is investment,
* formula_7 is government spending,
* formula_8 is net exports, where
** formula_9 is total exports, and
** formula_10 total imports, given by formula_11.

These four major parts, which can be stated in either &#x27;nominal&#x27; or &#x27;real&#x27; terms, are: 
* personal consumption expenditures (formula_2) or &quot;consumption&quot;, demand by households and unattached individuals; its determination is described by the consumption function. A basic conception is that it is the total consumption expenditures of the domestic economy. The consumption function is formula_13, where
** formula_14 is autonomous consumption, formula_15 the marginal propensity to consume, and formula_16 the disposable income.
* gross private domestic investment (formula_6), such as spending by business firms on factory construction. This is conceived as all private sector spending aimed at the production of some future consumable.
** In Keynesian economics, not all of gross private domestic investment counts as part of aggregate demand. Much or most of the investment in inventories can be due to a short-fall in demand (unplanned inventory accumulation or &quot;general over-production&quot;). The Keynesian model forecasts a decrease in national output and income when there is unplanned investment. (Inventory accumulation would correspond to an excess supply of products; in the National Income and Product Accounts, it is treated as a purchase by its producer.) Thus, only the &quot;planned&quot; or intended or desired part of investment (formula_18) is counted as part of aggregate demand. (So, formula_6 does not include the &#x27;investment&#x27; in running up or depleting inventory levels.)
** Investment is affected by the output and the interest rate (formula_20). Consequently, we can write it as, formula_21, a function &quot;I&quot; which takes total income and interest rate as parameters. Investment has positive relationship with the output and negative relationship with the interest rate. Thus, an increase in the interest rate will cause aggregate demand to decline. Interest costs are part of the cost of borrowing and as they rise, both firms and households will cut back on spending. This shifts the aggregate demand curve to the left. This lowers equilibrium GDP below potential GDP.
* gross government investment and consumption expenditures (formula_7), also determined as formula_23, the difference of government expenditures and taxes. An increase in government expenditures or decrease in taxes, therefore leads to an increase in GDP as government expenditures are a component of aggregate demand.
* net exports (formula_24 and sometimes (formula_25)), net demand by the rest of the world for the country&#x27;s output. This contributes to the current account.

In sum, for a single country at a given time, aggregate demand (formula_26 or formula_27) is given by formula_28.

These macroeconomic variables are constructed from varying types of microeconomic variables from the price of each, so these variables are denominated in (real or nominal) currency terms.

== Aggregate demand curves ==
Understanding of the aggregate demand curve depends on whether it is examined based on changes in demand as income changes, or as price change.

===Keynesian cross===
===Aggregate demand-aggregate supply model===
Sometimes, especially in textbooks, &quot;aggregate demand&quot; refers to an entire demand curve that &quot;looks&quot; like that in a typical Marshallian supply and demand diagram.

Thus, we could refer to an &quot;aggregate quantity demanded&quot; (formula_29 in real or inflation-corrected terms) at any given aggregate average price level (such as the GDP deflator), formula_30.

In these diagrams, typically the formula_31 rises as the average price level (formula_30) falls, as with the formula_27 line in the diagram. The main theoretical reason for this is that if the nominal money supply (Ms) is constant, a falling formula_30 implies that the real money supply (formula_35)rises, encouraging lower interest rates and higher spending. This is often called the &quot;Keynes effect&quot;. 
Carefully using ideas from the theory of supply and demand, aggregate supply can help determine the extent to which increases in aggregate demand lead to increases in real output or instead to increases in prices (inflation). In the diagram, an increase in any of the components of formula_27 (at any given formula_30) shifts the formula_27 curve to the right. This increases both the level of real production (formula_4) and the average price level (formula_30).

But different levels of economic activity imply different mixtures of output and price increases. As shown, with very low levels of real gross domestic product and thus large amounts of unemployed resources, most economists of the Keynesian school suggest that most of the change would be in the form of output and employment increases. As the economy gets close to potential output (formula_41), we would see more and more price increases rather than output increases as formula_27 increases.

Beyond formula_41, this gets more intense, so that price increases dominate. Worse, output levels greater than formula_41 cannot be sustained for long. The formula_45 is a &quot;short-term&quot; relationship here. If the economy persists in operating above potential, the formula_45 curve will shift to the left, making the increases in real output transitory.

At low levels of formula_4, the world is more complicated. First, most modern industrial economies experience few if any fall in prices. So the formula_45 curve is unlikely to shift down or to the right. Second, when they do suffer price cuts (as in Japan), it can lead to disastrous deflation.

==Debt==
A post-Keynesian theory of aggregate demand emphasizes the role of debt, which it considers a fundamental component of aggregate demand; the contribution of change in debt to aggregate demand is referred to by some as the . Aggregate demand is &quot;spending&quot;, be it on consumption, investment, or other categories. Spending is related to income via:

:Income – Spending = Net savings

Rearranging this yields:

:Spending = Income – Net savings = Income + Net increase in debt

In words: What you spend is what you earn, plus what you borrow. If you spend $110 and earned $100, then you must have net borrowed $10. Conversely, if you spend $90 and earn $100, then you have net savings of $10, or have reduced debt by $10, for a net change in debt of –$10.

If debt grows or shrinks slowly as a percentage of GDP, its impact on aggregate demand is small. Conversely, if debt is significant, then changes in the dynamics of debt growth can have significant impact on aggregate demand. Change in debt is tied to the &quot;level&quot; of debt: if the overall debt level is 10% of GDP and 1% of loans are not repaid, this impacts GDP by 1% of 10% = 0.1% of GDP, which is statistical noise. Conversely, if the debt level is 300% of GDP and 1% of loans are not repaid, this impacts GDP by 1% of 300% = 3% of GDP, which is significant: a change of this magnitude will generally cause a recession.

Similarly, changes in the repayment rate (debtors paying down their debts) impact aggregate demand in proportion to the level of debt. Thus, as the level of debt in an economy grows, the economy becomes more sensitive to debt dynamics, and credit bubbles are of macroeconomic concern. Since write-offs and savings rates both spike in recessions, both of which result in shrinkage of credit, the resulting drop in aggregate demand can worsen and perpetuate the recession in a vicious cycle.

This perspective originates in, and is intimately tied to, the debt-deflation theory of Irving Fisher, and the notion of a credit bubble (credit being the flip side of debt), and has been elaborated in the Post-Keynesian school. If the overall level of debt is rising each year, then aggregate demand exceeds Income by that amount. However, if the level of debt stops rising and instead starts falling (if &quot;the bubble bursts&quot;), then aggregate demand falls short of income, by the amount of net savings (largely in the form of debt repayment or debt writing off, such as in bankruptcy). This causes a sudden and sustained drop in aggregate demand, and this shock is argued to be the proximate cause of a class of economic crises, properly financial crises. Indeed, a fall in the level of debt is not necessary – even a &quot;slowing&quot; in the rate of debt growth causes a drop in aggregate demand (relative to the higher borrowing year). These crises then end when credit starts growing again, either because most or all debts have been repaid or written off, or for other reasons as below.

From the perspective of debt, the Keynesian prescription of government deficit spending in the face of an economic crisis consists of the government net &quot;dis&quot;-saving (increasing its debt) to compensate for the shortfall in private debt: it replaces private debt with public debt. Other alternatives include seeking to restart the growth of private debt (&quot;reflate the bubble&quot;), or slow or stop its fall; and debt relief, which by lowering or eliminating debt stops credit from contracting (as it cannot fall below zero) and allows debt to either stabilize or grow – this has the further effect of redistributing wealth from creditors (who write off debts) to debtors (whose debts are relieved).

==Criticisms==
Austrian theorist Henry Hazlitt argued that aggregate demand is &quot;a meaningless concept&quot; in economic analysis. Friedrich Hayek, another Austrian, wrote that Keynes&#x27; study of the aggregate relations in an economy is &quot;fallacious&quot;, arguing that recessions are caused by micro-economic factors.

<doc id="353025" wikidata="Q27074911" url="?curid=353025" title="Downy woodpecker">
<text>The downy woodpecker (Dryobates pubescens) is a species of woodpecker, the smallest in North America. Length ranges from . Downy woodpeckers primarily live in forested areas throughout the United States and Canada, with the exception of deserts in the southwest and the northern tundra. The bird nests in tree cavities and feeds primarily on insects, although it supplements its diet with seeds and berries. The downy woodpecker is very similar in appearance to the hairy woodpecker, although they are not closely related.

==Taxonomy==
The downy woodpecker was described and illustrated with a hand-coloured plate by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;, which was published between 1729 and 1732. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he included the downy woodpecker, coined the binomial name &quot;Picus pubescens&quot; and cited Catesby&#x27;s book. The specific epithet &quot;pubescens&quot; is the Latin for &quot;pubescent&quot; or &quot;downy&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as &quot;America septentrionali&quot; (North America) but the locality is now restricted to South Carolina. The downy woodpecker was usually placed in either &quot;Dendrocopos&quot; or &quot;Picoides&quot;, but a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2015 found that these genera did not form monophyletic groups. In the revised generic classification, the downy woodpecker was placed with four other species in the resurrected genus &quot;Dryobates&quot;, that had been erected in 1826 by the German naturalist Friedrich Boie with the downy woodpecker as the type species. Within the genus, the downy woodpecker is sister to a clade containing Nuttall&#x27;s woodpecker (&quot;Dryobates nuttalli&quot;) and the ladder-backed woodpecker (&quot;Dryobates scalaris&quot;).

Despite their close resemblance, the downy and hairy woodpeckers are not very closely related; the outward similarity is an example of convergent evolution. Why they evolved this way cannot be explained with confidence; it may be relevant that the species exploit rather different-sized foodstuffs and do not compete very much ecologically.

Seven subspecies are recognized:
* &quot;D. p. glacialis&quot; (Grinnell, 1910) – southeast Alaska
* &quot;D. p. medianus&quot; (Swainson, 1832) – central Alaska to east Canada and central and east USA
* &quot;D. p. fumidus&quot; (Maynard, 1889) – southwest Canada and west Washington
* &quot;D. p. gairdnerii&quot; (Audubon, 1839) – west Oregon to northwest California
* &quot;D. p. turati&quot; (Malherbe, 1860) – central Washington to central California
* &quot;D. p. leucurus&quot; (Hartlaub, 1852) – Rocky Mountains (southeast Alaska to southwest USA)
* &quot;D. p. pubescens&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – southeast USA

== Description ==

Adult downy woodpeckers are the smallest of North America&#x27;s woodpeckers, but there are many smaller species elsewhere, especially the piculets. The total length of the species ranges from and the wingspan from . Body mass ranges from . Standard measurements are as follows: the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . The downy woodpecker is mainly black on the upperparts and wings, with a white back, throat and belly and white spotting on the wings. There is one white bar above the eye, and one below. They have a black tail with white outer feathers barred with black. Adult males have a red patch on the back of the head whereas juvenile birds display a red cap.

The downy woodpecker is virtually identical in plumage pattern to the larger hairy woodpecker, but it can be distinguished from the hairy by the presence of black spots on its white tail feathers and the length of its bill. The downy woodpecker&#x27;s bill is shorter than its head, whereas the hairy woodpecker&#x27;s bill is approximately equal to head length.

The downy woodpecker gives a number of vocalizations, including a short &quot;pik&quot; call. One may identify the woodpecker by the pik-call, counting half a second between piks (a total of four must be heard). The rattle-call is a short burst that sounds similar to a bouncing ball, while that of the hairy woodpecker is a shorter burst of the same amplitude. Like other woodpeckers, it also produces a drumming sound (sounds like four taps ) with its beak as it pecks into trees. Its drums are slower compared to other North American species.

==Behavior and ecology==

Downy woodpeckers are native to forested areas, mainly deciduous, of North America. Their range consists of most of the United States and Canada, except for the deserts of the southwest and the tundra of the north. Mostly permanent residents, northern birds may migrate further south; birds in mountainous areas may move to lower elevations.

Downy woodpeckers nest in a tree cavity excavated by the nesting pair in a dead tree or limb. In the winter, they roost in tree cavities. They tend to nest near soft snags, where the wood is softer and the inner heartwood of the tree can be accessed more easily. The woodpecker will form a nest cavity in the softer heartwood, and its nest will be protected by the outer portion of the tree. This portion is made up of harder sapwood, which serves as protection from the elements and predators. Heartwood is often softer in dead or decayed trees, as a result, the number of dead trees in a forest and downy woodpeckers habitats are positively correlated in studies. Downy woodpeckers prefer to nest in areas with ample light, leading them to favor trees with broader leaves, such as poplars, birches, and ashes, or forest openings and edges.

Downy woodpeckers forage on trees, picking the bark surface in summer and digging deeper in winter. They mainly eat insects, but they also feed on seeds and berries. They are a natural predator of the European corn borer, a moth that costs the US agriculture industry more than $1 billion annually in crop losses and population control. In winter, especially, downy woodpeckers can often be found in suburban backyards with mature trees where they feed on suet and shelled peanuts provided by mesh birdfeeders.

== Breeding ==
Downy woodpeckers will start breeding in their first possible season and will return to a site within 2 hectares of where they were born. They breed every year of their mature life, possibly returning to the same nest holes that they used in years prior. Barring the presence of an existing hole, downy woodpeckers will create a cavity in a tree roughly 2.4 to 15.3 m (8 to 50 ft) above the ground, with the male woodpecker pecking the hole for roughly half of the daylight hours, in 20 minute work sessions. The nest hole takes about two or three weeks to create, and normally measures 12 to 15 cm wide and about 20 to 30 cm deep.

A female will typically lay 4–5 white eggs, but can lay up to 7. During waking hours, both birds will incubate, or warm the eggs for 15 minute periods, taking turns in alternating shifts. At night, the male woodpecker typically will rest on the eggs for their continued warmth. This incubation period lasts for about 12 days. When the eggs hatch, the infant woodpeckers weigh about 1.6 grams, which will rise to around 3.2 grams over the course of its first day of life. They will appear fully grown by the 17th or 18th day.

These younger birds are demarcated by tinted red crowns for the males, and striped or white dotted crowns for the females. Eventually, these crowns will turn jet black after they finish moulting in summer. The young males will also gain a bright red dot on the back of their head once they reach adulthood. The adult birds will begin to moult earlier than their young. This process starts when their young still occupy the nest, ultimately culminating with replacement of the two strongest, central feathers. These feathers are maintained to retain the bird&#x27;s climbing power during the two month moult period. When the moulting ends in September, their plumage will have a slight yellow tinge.

<text>Pachypodium is a genus of succulent spine-bearing trees and shrubs, native to Madagascar and Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae.

==Genus characteristics==
All &quot;Pachypodium&quot; are succulent plants that exhibit, to varying degrees, the morphological characteristics of pachycaul trunks and spinescence. These are the most general features of the genus and can be considered distinguishing characteristics.

The pachycaul trunk is a morphologically enlarged trunk that stores water so as to survive seasonal drought or intermittent periods of root desiccation in exposed, dry, and rocky conditions. Whereas there is great variation in the habit of the plant body, all &quot;Pachypodium&quot; exhibit pachycaul growth. Variation in habit can range from dwarf flattened plants to bottle shaped shrubs to dendroid-shaped trees.

The second general characteristic of &quot;Pachypodium&quot; is spinescence, or having spines. The spines come clustered in either pairs or triplets with these clusters often arranged in rings or whorls around the trunk. Spines emerge with leaves, and like leaves grow for a short period before stopping growth and hardening. Spines do not regenerate so weathering and abrasion can wear away all but the youngest spines from older specimens - leaving smooth trunks and branches.

To some extent, branches are a characteristic of the genus. Some caution is warranted in overgeneralizing this characteristic. &quot;Pachypodium namaquanum&quot; is often branchless. &quot;Pachypodium brevicaule&quot; has no clear branches, and indeed may have evolved an alternative to branching in the form of nodes from which leaves, spines, and inflorescences emerge. In general &quot;Pachypodium&quot; have few branches. Since the environmental stresses and factors that contribute to branching can vary widely even in small areas, individual plants of the same species exhibit wide variation in branching morphology.

Unlike many members of the Apocynaceae, including some members of the superficially similar &quot;Adenium&quot;, &quot;Pachypodium&quot; species do not exude a milky latex. Rather, the sap is always clear.

===Morphology===
The morphology of the genus &quot;Pachypodium&quot; varies significantly both within and between species and is highly responsive to its immediate surrounding microenvironment. &quot;Pachypodium&quot; do not overly respond morphologically to larger vegetative zones. For example, &quot;Pachypodium&quot; can sometimes occur in prehumid vegetative zones where a taxon might find a suitable habitat on a rocky, sunny inselberg jutting above the humid canopy of the forest.

Morphologically, &quot;Pachypodium&quot; can be highly &quot;flexible&quot; in organization. Branching, if present at all, can be from either the base of the plant or at the crown. Freeform branching is a morphological adaptation to factors of the immediate microenvironment which, by their diversity, account for the wide range of habits:

* flattened dwarf species less than 8 cm tall but reaching 40 cm in diameter
* bottle- or oval-shaped shrubs to 4 m tall
* both branching and unbranched cigar- and cactus-like trees to 5 m tall.

Despite microenvironmental variation, &quot;Pachypodium&quot; are always succulent and always exhibit pachycaul trunks. &quot;Pachypodium&quot; are usually spinescent, but individual variation in spinescence as well as weathering and abrasion can result in plants with few if any spines.

===Adaptive features===
Variation among &quot;Pachypodium&quot; species is significant but all &quot;Pachypodium&quot; are succulent plants inhabiting seasonally or chronically dry landscapes. The genus employs two morphological adaptations to these xeric, isolated, habitats: Pachycaul trunks and spinescence.

====Pachycaul trunks====
&quot;Pachypodium&quot; trunks and branches are thickened with water-storing tissue. Plants must rely on the food and water stored in their thickened trunks during seasonal or intermittent drought when leaves have been shed and no water is available from the substrate. In addition to the lower surface-to-volume ratio which aides in water retention, the thickened trunks and branches can also possess photosynthetic surface tissue to allow nutrient synthesis even when leaves are not present.

Some species of pachypodium have developed geophytic pachycaul trunks, or trunks that are beneath the soil&#x27;s surface. These geophytic trunks are caudexes, enlarged stems or trunks that store water. They should not be mistaken for roots, because the enlargement occurs above the point where the roots branch off the main axis of the trunk.

====Spinescence====
The various species of Pachypodium are more or less heavily spined. Species from more arid regions have evolved denser and longer spines. Fog condenses on their spines in the form of dew, which drips down to the ground and increases the amount of moisture that&#x27;s available to their often shallow roots.

The concept of &quot;micro-endemism&quot; plays an important role in this relationship between adaptation mechanisms and speciation. It suggests a certain small scale &quot;nativeness&quot; by virtue of originating or occurring naturally in a particular place or location. The landscape of Madagascar is a perfect example of &quot;micro-endemism&quot; for species of &quot;Pachypodium&quot; and other taxa. Three factors can be seen to attribute speciation, or the occurrence of species diversity, via adaptive mechanisms to accelerated evolution as it occurs within the xeric landscape and climate.

(1) The variation of geology and topology in dry climates is thought to have a greater effect upon plants than in areas with high rainfall. Xeric environments are thus more demanding of adaptive mechanisms to aid in the plant&#x27;s survival than in places where rainfall is plentiful. The more the demanding, generally the more &quot;mechanized&quot; or &quot;mechanisms&quot; are needed to aid the plants&#x27; survival.

(2) The geological formations of locally xeric landscapes break up populations of organisms, i.e. plants, into smaller groups, where each group can initially interbreed but, with time, develop new genotypes and cannot be bred with exception to natural hybridization. Localized geology becomes harder to cross over for a given population to be &quot;continuous&quot; in a xeric geological landscape, because more demands are placed on the population. Therefore, populations are broken down into smaller units within this landscape. Groups of the original population become located to unique microenvironments within the landscape. Accordingly, measures to adapt to these microenvironments become more singular to the isolated habitat. Adaptive mechanisms are employed so as to aid the survival of the plant group. This adaptation eventually, in part, leads to speciation in the habitat, or diverse species across the spectrum of the landscape.

(3) Taxa tend to develop specialized xeromorphoric structures at some architectural level in arid, geological and topological landscapes, where a strategy of a &quot;flexible&quot; and &quot;strict&quot; architectural, organizational morphology at various levels of structure for &quot;Pachypodium&quot; becomes advantageous to succeeding in the isolated, specialized landscape. This strategy is seen in the manifest &quot;flexible&quot; variations of habit in species of &quot;Pachypodium&quot; while all the same they are &quot;strictly&quot; xeromorphic pachycaul trunks meant to conserve water for dry periods. At another level of structure, namely that of organs, we can see that dew and fog dripping spines are examples of a xeromorphic adaptive mechanized organ responding to microenvironments.

These newly created species from within the xeromorphic landscape take on different characters as responses to the habitat. For instance, there is an advantage to morphologically developing into bottle-shaped &quot;shrubs&quot; where the plants exist in open, sunny microenvironments on top of porous sandstone. Little competition exists for height within the habitat. Likewise, where competition for resources is more competitive—&quot;both in the number of species and the height of surrounding plants&quot;—there are times when it is to the advantage of a plant to develop into arborescent, dendroid &quot;trees.&quot; This development is because these particular &quot;Pachypodium&quot; must compete with other plants for resources in a dry deciduous forest, composed of, perhaps, arborescent &quot;Aloe&quot;, members of the Didiereaceae genera &quot;Alluaudia&quot;, &quot;Alluaudiopsis&quot;, &quot;Decaryia&quot;, and &quot;Didierea&quot; (all endemic to Madagascar), and &quot;Uncarina&quot; species, for instance.

The adaptive mechanism in a morphological form and an ecological response to habitats are typically manifested together at once for the genus &quot;Pachypodium&quot;.

Examining &quot;Pachypodium&quot; reveals characteristics of various organs that adapt to the microenvironment. These adaptations, variations on habit, trunks, branches, branchlets, spines, leaves, or flowers, are plentiful in demonstrating how &quot;Pachypodium&quot; as a genus fosters greater variation in its speciation. The manner in which speciation occurs in &quot;Pachypodium&quot;, therefore, is apparent: adaptive mechanisms on a morphological level respond to the microenvironment of &quot;Pachypodium&quot; habitat. The genus&#x27; unique organizational, architectural morphology shapes plants that are highly, adaptively responsive to their immediate, surrounding, microenvironments. The duplicity of an adaptive mechanism that is at once &quot;strict&quot; and &quot;flexible&quot; at differing levels of plant physiology, or structure, has granted &quot;Pachypodium&quot; the ability to evolve within the landscape into variations that fulfill an ecological niche as various species.

The hypothesis of micro-endemism, therefore, states that speciation occurs in small specific habitats as aided by adaptive mechanism occurring in geological, topographical, and climatic isolation. Geologically and topographically, plant populations in xeric climates are broken down into smaller groups. The microclimate responds to the given location transforming it into a habitat. Isolated, the duplicity of organization in &quot;Pachypodium&quot; form through geology and location significant variation where over evolutionary time a new species might develop, if not have developed. The development of new species is through, in part, the adaptive mechanisms of pachycaul and spinescence as well as strict and flexible structural organization at various levels of plant physiology.

==Taxonomy==
===Number of species===
There are now 25 known species, of which 20 come from Madagascar, where isolated landscapes and micro-environmental conditions have produced highly specialized species. The species count continues to grow as &quot;Pachypodium menabeum&quot; has been resurrected from invalid taxonomy and &quot;Pachypodium makayense&quot; added newly to the list. One can speculate that in regions such as Madagascar, there might still be unidentified species that are confined to a single rocky outcrop or an inselberg.

===Affinities within the Apocynaceae===
The family Apocynaceae before it included Asclepiadaceae had 3 genera that can be considered succulent plants: &quot;Adenium&quot;, &quot;Pachypodium&quot;, and &quot;Plumeria&quot;. The first two genera (&quot;Pachypodium&quot; and &quot;Adenium&quot;) are generally assumed to have a close association with each other. Studies; however, of these two genera reveal that they are not as intimately close as once thought.

However, a study of key characteristics of the taxon and a cladistic study of the subfamily Apocynoideae and the family Asclepiadaceae (before its merging with the Apocynaceae), demonstrates that this closed association is not warranted. True, both are succulent plants and pachycaul. According to Leeuwenberg however, &quot;Adenium&quot; is maintained in the subtribe Neriinae, placed underneath the tribe Wrightieae whereas &quot;Pachypodium&quot; is placed beside them in the subtribe Pachypodiinae, within the tribe Echiteae. Though related, these taxa means that the two are not intimately related.

==Distribution and habitats==

===Distribution===
&quot;Pachypodium&quot; are native to Madagascar and continental Southern Africa, including Angola, Eswatini, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe.

===Habitat===


&quot;Pachypodium&quot; in both mainland Africa and Madagascar grow at a wide variety of altitudes. They range from sea level—where some species, such as &quot;P. geayi&quot;, grow in sand dunes—to in the case of &quot;Pachypodium lealii&quot; in southern Africa and in the case &quot;Pachypodium brevicaule&quot; in Madagascar.

In continental southern Africa, the extreme temperatures range from in some locations to as high as , whereas in Madagascar, the temperature ranges from .

A generalization about precipitation regimes for both southern Africa and Madagascar does not have much meaning because the habitats of &quot;Pachypodium&quot; vary so greatly in moisture regime. In some places in southern Africa, &quot;Pachypodium&quot; receive as little as of annual precipitation, while in others they receive as much as . A precipitation regime for a species of &quot;Pachypodium&quot;, therefore, depends upon a habitat&#x27;s location relative to the influences of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and the various mountain ranges of southern continental Africa and of Madagascar.

The genus grows in areas where there are significant dry seasons that range from five to ten months. For example, they are common in the Madagascar dry deciduous forests with their long dry season and severe limestone ridden soils.

&quot;Pachypodium&quot; grows in various types of substrates. Some species only grow in one substrate whereas other will grow in several. The degree to which a taxon can grow in a given substrate seems to determine how specialized its habitat is within the landscape and climates. On outcrops, steep hills, and inselbergs, the plants are subjected to fluctuating moisture, high winds, and temperature extremes. Only plants with special adaptations to exposure and extreme drought can survive, let alone thrive, on these exposed geological habitats. &quot;Pachypodium&quot; root in cleft, fissures, and crevices of those rocky formations. The non-succulent roots penetrate deeply into the accumulated soil, mineral, and humus in these crevices. Moisture is able to seep deep into these crevices. Very little transpiration occurs. In this manner, rocky substrates provide moisture in the habitat. This saturation of crevices can only occur, however, if there is not a considerable runoff from the rock&#x27;s surface and if there is abundant fine soil in the cracks that, in turn, retain water. The substrate, therefore, plays a critical role in the creation of micro-environmental &quot;arid islands.&quot;

Sand readily store water because it is taken up easily and there is less evaporation except for the top layer. Very deep sand; however, has the problem of seepage. Yet in moderation shallow and deep sand substrates have water available to &quot;Pachypodium&quot;. With shallow sand substrates, &quot;Pachypodium&quot; grow on sand dunes near the sea. Where water is in deep sandy substrate, &quot;Pachypodium&quot; grow on sand &quot;over&quot; laterite red soil. Laterite soil is a largely impermeable soil that traps water for the use of the flora that include &quot;Pachypodium&quot;.

==Protection status==
Internationally &quot;Pachypodium&quot; are protected under the CITES treaty. According to it, members of this genus cannot be collected from endemic, native locations within the landscape. They are not easily, readily imported and exported between nations either. The protection afforded by the CITES treaty responses to two issues:

*The esteem the genus has within Collector&#x27;s and Nursery Trade. As highly esteemed plants, succulent enthusiast desire to collect more and more species and cultivars. In the case of &quot;Pachypodium&quot;, seed, seedlings, and even mature, nursery-grown specimen plants are fortunately available readily in Nursery Trade.
*Destruction of the genus&#x27;s endemic habitats, e.g. through agriculture.

Extinction of identified species seems yet unlikely, as the collection of seed and the cultivation of the plant safeguard the genus.

==History of the genus==
The early history of the genus &quot;Pachypodium&quot; demonstrates the typical process of a taxon becoming a new genus. Initially debate occurred over if &quot;Pachypodium&quot; belonged to the genus &quot;Echites&quot; or if it constituted a separate genus. &quot;Pachypodium &quot;were first published as a unique genus, separate from &quot;Echites&quot;, by Leandley in 1830.

Then the debate centered on the nomenclature of species uniquely found in continental Southern Africa. That changed when, in 1882, Baker contributed the first species accepted into the genus from Madagascar. The degree of speciation then turned to Madagascar, where the count of species far exceeds those on the mainland.

In 1907, Costantin and Bois constructed the first monograph, of &quot;Pachypodium&quot;, in which they enumerated 17 species, where ten were from Madagascar and seven were from continental southern Africa.

==Natural history==
There is no fossil records of &quot;Pachypodium&quot; known. Yet certain conclusions can be drawn from the geology of the landscape in Madagascar as to the past natural history of &quot;Pachypodium&quot;.

==Vernacular names==
In southern Africa it is called the &quot;Kudu Lily&quot;. In Madagascar, they are known as &quot;bontaka&quot;, &quot;vontaka&quot; and &quot;votaka&quot; which means &quot;swelling&quot;.

<text>was a Japanese writer active during the Taishō and Shōwa periods of Japan, whose work was distinguished by its lucid, straightforward style and strong autobiographical overtones.

==Early life==
Shiga was born in Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture, as the son of a banker and descendant of an aristocratic samurai family. In 1885, the family moved to Tokyo and Shiga given into his grandparents&#x27; custody. His mother died when he was twelve, an experience that marked the beginning of an obsession with and fear of death both on an individual and a collective level, and which stayed with him until his early thirties. At the same time, his relationship with his father became increasingly strained. One conflict resulted from Shiga&#x27;s announcement that he intended to participate in the protests following the 1907 Ashio Copper Mine incident and his father&#x27;s forbidding him to do so because part of the family&#x27;s wealth was derived from a past investment in the mine. 

Shiga&#x27;s imagination was inspired by nature, and he was an avid reader of Thomas Carlyle and Ralph Waldo Emerson, as well as of Lafcadio Hearn&#x27;s stories of the supernatural. At the age of 18, Shiga converted to Christianity under the influence of Uchimura Kanzō, but struggled with his new religion due to his own homosexual tendencies. He graduated from the Gakushuin Peer&#x27;s Elementary School in 1906 and started studying English literature at Tokyo Imperial University, but left two years later without a degree. Another family crisis arose when Shiga announced to marry one of the housemaids, Chiyo, with whom he was having an affair. The father terminated his son&#x27;s plans, and the maid was removed from the household.

==Literary career==
In 1910, Shiga co-founded the magazine &quot;Shirakaba&quot; (&quot;White birch&quot;), the literary publication of the Shirakaba-ha (&quot;White birch society&quot;). Other co-founders included Saneatsu Mushanokōji and Rigen Kinoshita, who Shiga had befriended at Gakushuin Peer&#x27;s School, and Takeo Arishima and Ton Satomi. The Shirakaba-ha rejected Confucianism and Naturalism, and instead propagated individualism, idealism and humanitarianism, for which Russian writer Leo Tolstoy served as a model. Shiga contributed the story &quot;As Far as Abashiri&quot; (&quot;Abashiri made&quot;) to the first issue.

In the following years, Shiga published short stories like &quot;The Razor&quot; (&quot;Kamisori&quot;, 1910), &quot;Han&#x27;s Crime&quot; (&quot;Han no hanzai&quot;, 1913) and &quot;Seibei and his Gourds&quot; (&quot;Seibei to hyotan&quot;, 1913). The story &quot;Ōtsu Junkichi&quot;, published in &quot;Chūō Kōron&quot; in 1912, his first publication for which he received a fee, was an autobiographical account of his affair with the former housemaid Chiyo and the familial conflicts. It also marked the first time that Shiga drew on the method of a narrating self, a distinctive mark of the I-novel genre, to which many of Shiga&#x27;s works are ascribed to. While working on &quot;Ōtsu Junkichi&quot;, Shiga had read the English translation of Anatole France&#x27;s novel &quot;The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard&quot;, which he cited as an important influence on his own writing.

In 1914, Shiga married Sada Kadenokōji, a widow with a six-year-old daughter (and a cousin of Mushanokōji), which led to a complete break between father and son. However, 1917 saw the reconciliation with his father, which he thematised in his novella &quot;Reconciliation&quot; (&quot;Wakai&quot;, 1917). He followed with a series of short stories and &quot;A Dark Night&#x27;s Passing&quot; (&quot;An&#x27;ya koro&quot;, 1921–1937); the latter, his only full length novel, was serialized in the socialist magazine &quot;Kaizō&quot; and is regarded as his major work. The novel&#x27;s protagonist, young struggling writer Kensaku, has often been associated with its author. Shiga&#x27;s sometimes confessional stories also included a series of accounts of his extramarital affair in the mid-1920s, among them &quot;A Memory of Yamashina&quot; (&quot;Yamashina no kioku&quot;, 1926), &quot;Infatuation&quot; (&quot;Chijo&quot;, 1926) and &quot;Kuniko&quot; (1927).

Shiga&#x27;s work influenced many later writers, including Kazu Ozaki, Kiku Amino, Motojirō Kajii, Takiji Kobayashi, Fumio Niwa, Kōsaku Takii, Kiyoshi Naoi, Toshimasa Shimamura, Hiroyuki Agawa and Shizuo Fujieda. While his work was praised by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa and Sei Itō, other contemporaries like Dazai Osamu, Mitsuo Nakamura and Sakunosuke Oda were strongly critical of it. Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki praised the &quot;practicality&quot; (jitsuyō) of Shiga&#x27;s style, in which he discovered, with reference to &quot;At Kinosaki&quot;, a &quot;tightening up&quot; (higishimeta) of the sentences: &quot;[…] any word that is not absolutely necessary has been left out&quot;.

Shiga was also known for being a harsh moral critic of the literary establishment, blaming Tōson Shimazaki for having written his debut novel &quot;The Broken Commandment&quot; under such precarious financial hardship that Shimazaki&#x27;s three young daughters died of malnutrition.

==Later life==

Shiga published very few new works in his later years. These included the short stories &quot;A Gray Moon&quot; (&quot;Haiiro no tsuki&quot;, 1946) and &quot;Yamabato&quot; (1951), or essays like &quot;Kokuko mondai&quot; (1946), in which he proposed to make French the national language of Japan. He served as the first post-war president of the from 1947 to 1948, and was awarded the Order of Culture in 1949. He died of pneumonia on October 21, 1971, at Kantō Central Public Hospital in Setagaya, Tokyo. His grave is at Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo. His house in Nara, where he lived from 1929 to 1938, has been preserved and is open to the public as a memorial museum.

<text>Pachypodium lealii, the bottle tree, is a species of plant included in the &quot;genus&quot; &quot;Pachypodium&quot;. The scientific name derives from the 19th century Portuguese geologist Fernando da Costa Leal, who described the bottle tree during an exploration in southern Angola.

This species can be either a shrub or a tree up to 6 meters tall and is characterized by the thick bottle-shaped trunk, which is almost branchless until the top. The branches are few and covered by slender thorns up to 30 cm long. Leaves are oblong and are covered with short hairs on both surfaces. The flowers, shown below in detail, are present in the spring, when the tree is leafless. The white flowers, characteristic of the family Apocynaceae, cluster around the tips of the branches.

The plant produces a watery latex, rich in toxic alkaloids, used by local populations as arrow poison for hunting. In contact with the eyes this latex can produce blindness.

==Distribution and habitats==

===Distribution===
The bottle tree is an endemic species of Namibia and southern Angola where it occupies the semi-desert areas and dry bushvelds, usually along rocky hillsides. It is especially common in the Etendeka plateau of NE Namibia, where it can be seen growing in the basalt slopes.

===Habitat===
Altitudinal range of this species is 1000–1600 metres above sea level. The extreme temperatures range from an occasional -10 °C to as much to 45 °C.

==Protection status==
Pachypodium lealii doesn&#x27;t appear to be under significant threat, but the lack of young specimens, and the removal of wild plants for trade, is a concern in Namibia. It is listed on Appendix II of CITES, which makes it an offence to trade these plants internationally without a permit.

<text>The A483, officially described as the Swansea to Manchester Trunk Road, although now ending in Chester, is a major road in the United Kingdom. It runs from Swansea in Wales to Chester in England via Llandovery, Llandrindod Wells, Oswestry and Wrexham, a distance of around .

==Route description==
===Swansea===
The A483 begins at the M4 motorway junction 42, just east of Swansea. It travels west along the Fabian Way towards Swansea city centre, where it turns to a northwesterly direction. It meets the M4 again at junction 47 at Penllergaer, after which it multiplexes with the A48 along Swansea Road, Bryntirion Road and Bolgoed Road to Pontarddulais.

===Carmarthenshire===
After Pontarddulais, the route continues along Heol Fforest and Carmarthen Road. It diverges from the A48 at the M4 junction 49, turning northeast towards Ammanford and then north towards Llandeilo. At Llandeilo it joins the A40, then multiplexes with this route as far as Llandovery. From here, it continues north into Powys.

===Powys===
The A483 continues through Llanwrtyd Wells, Builth Wells (where it intersects with the A470) and Llandrindod Wells. It intersects with the A44 at Crossgates, just north of Llandrindod Wells, then continues to Newtown. The original route, through the centre of the town, passed under the Cambrian Line at the Dolfor Road Railway Bridge. This low bridge, with a height restriction of , was hit by high vehicles on many occasions. A bypass to the Southeast of Newtown was opened in 2019, crossing the Cambrian Line to the East of the town before rejoining the original route. From Newtown, the road continues to Welshpool, running roughly parallel to the River Severn, before crossing the border into England at Llanymynech.

===Shropshire===
From Llanymynech, the A483 continues north, bypassing Oswestry. Here, it picks up a multiplex with the A5; the two routes then cross into Wales at Chirk.

===Wrexham===
After the A5 diverges to the west at Chirk, the A483 crosses the River Dee, then reaches Ruabon. Here, it becomes a dual carriageway with numbered grade-separated junctions.

Junction 1 – A539 Ruabon

Junction 2 – B5426 Johnstown

Junction 3 – A5152 Croesfoel

Junction 4 – A525 Ruthin Road

Junction 5 – A541 Mold Road

Junction 6 – A5156 (A534) Gresford

Junction 7 – B5102 Rossett

===Cheshire===
Just south of Chester, the A483 intersects with the A55 North Wales Expressway. It then continues as a single carriageway to its terminus at the city centre, crossing the Grosvenor Bridge over the Dee.

==Future==
There have been demands for a dual carriageway from Shrewsbury to Wrexham, including the section of the A483 from Oswestry to Ruabon; also a campaign by residents for a bypassing Llanymynech and Pant.

<text>In graph theory, an undirected graph is called a minor of the graph if can be formed from by deleting edges, vertices and by contracting edges.

The theory of graph minors began with Wagner&#x27;s theorem that a graph is planar if and only if its minors include neither the complete graph nor the complete bipartite graph . The Robertson–Seymour theorem implies that an analogous forbidden minor characterization exists for every property of graphs that is preserved by deletions and edge contractions.
For every fixed graph , it is possible to test whether is a minor of an input graph in polynomial time; together with the forbidden minor characterization this implies that every graph property preserved by deletions and contractions may be recognized in polynomial time.

Other results and conjectures involving graph minors include the graph structure theorem, according to which the graphs that do not have as a minor may be formed by gluing together simpler pieces, and Hadwiger&#x27;s conjecture relating the inability to color a graph to the existence of a large complete graph as a minor of it. Important variants of graph minors include the topological minors and immersion minors.

==Definitions==
An edge contraction is an operation that removes an edge from a graph while simultaneously merging the two vertices it used to connect. An undirected graph is a minor of another undirected graph if a graph isomorphic to can be obtained from by contracting some edges, deleting some edges, and deleting some isolated vertices. The order in which a sequence of such contractions and deletions is performed on does not affect the resulting graph .

Graph minors are often studied in the more general context of matroid minors. In this context, it is common to assume that all graphs are connected, with self-loops and multiple edges allowed (that is, they are multigraphs rather than simple graphs); the contraction of a loop and the deletion of a cut-edge are forbidden operations. This point of view has the advantage that edge deletions leave the rank of a graph unchanged, and edge contractions always reduce the rank by one.

In other contexts (such as with the study of pseudoforests) it makes more sense to allow the deletion of a cut-edge, and to allow disconnected graphs, but to forbid multigraphs. In this variation of graph minor theory, a graph is always simplified after any edge contraction to eliminate its self-loops and multiple edges.

A function is referred to as &quot;minor-monotone&quot; if, whenever is a minor of , one has .

==Example==
In the following example, graph &quot;H&quot; is a minor of graph &quot;G&quot;:

H. 

G. 

The following diagram illustrates this. First construct a subgraph of &quot;G&quot; by deleting the dashed edges (and the resulting isolated vertex), and then contract the gray edge (merging the two vertices it connects):

== Major results and conjectures ==
It is straightforward to verify that the graph minor relation forms a partial order on the isomorphism classes of finite undirected graphs: it is transitive (a minor of a minor of is a minor of itself), and and can only be minors of each other if they are isomorphic because any nontrivial minor operation removes edges or vertices. A deep result by Neil Robertson and Paul Seymour states that this partial order is actually a well-quasi-ordering: if an infinite list of finite graphs is given, then there always exist two indices such that is a minor of . Another equivalent way of stating this is that any set of graphs can have only a finite number of minimal elements under the minor ordering. This result proved a conjecture formerly known as Wagner&#x27;s conjecture, after Klaus Wagner; Wagner had conjectured it long earlier, but only published it in 1970.

In the course of their proof, Seymour and Robertson also prove the graph structure theorem in which they determine, for any fixed graph , the rough structure of any graph that does not have as a minor. The statement of the theorem is itself long and involved, but in short it establishes that such a graph must have the structure of a clique-sum of smaller graphs that are modified in small ways from graphs embedded on surfaces of bounded genus.
Thus, their theory establishes fundamental connections between graph minors and topological embeddings of graphs.
For any graph , the simple -minor-free graphs must be sparse, which means that the number of edges is less than some constant multiple of the number of vertices. More specifically, if has vertices, then a simple -vertex simple -minor-free graph can have at most formula_1 edges, and some -minor-free graphs have at least this many edges. Thus, if has vertices, then -minor-free graphs have average degree formula_2 and furthermore degeneracy formula_2. Additionally, the -minor-free graphs have a separator theorem similar to the planar separator theorem for planar graphs: for any fixed , and any -vertex -minor-free graph , it is possible to find a subset of formula_4 vertices whose removal splits into two (possibly disconnected) subgraphs with at most vertices per subgraph. Even stronger, for any fixed , -minor-free graphs have treewidth formula_4.

The Hadwiger conjecture in graph theory proposes that if a graph does not contain a minor isomorphic to the complete graph on vertices, then has a proper coloring with colors. The case is a restatement of the four color theorem. The Hadwiger conjecture has been proven for , but is unknown in the general case. call it &quot;one of the deepest unsolved problems in graph theory.&quot; Another result relating the four-color theorem to graph minors is the snark theorem announced by Robertson, Sanders, Seymour, and Thomas, a strengthening of the four-color theorem conjectured by W. T. Tutte and stating that any bridgeless 3-regular graph that requires four colors in an edge coloring must have the Petersen graph as a minor.

==Minor-closed graph families== 
Many families of graphs have the property that every minor of a graph in &quot;F&quot; is also in &quot;F&quot;; such a class is said to be &quot;minor-closed&quot;. For instance, in any planar graph, or any embedding of a graph on a fixed topological surface, neither the removal of edges nor the contraction of edges can increase the genus of the embedding; therefore, planar graphs and the graphs embeddable on any fixed surface form minor-closed families.

If &quot;F&quot; is a minor-closed family, then (because of the well-quasi-ordering property of minors) among the graphs that do not belong to &quot;F&quot; there is a finite set &quot;X&quot; of minor-minimal graphs. These graphs are forbidden minors for &quot;F&quot;: a graph belongs to &quot;F&quot; if and only if it does not contain as a minor any graph in &quot;X&quot;. That is, every minor-closed family &quot;F&quot; can be characterized as the family of &quot;X&quot;-minor-free graphs for some finite set &quot;X&quot; of forbidden minors.
The best-known example of a characterization of this type is Wagner&#x27;s theorem characterizing the planar graphs as the graphs having neither K5 nor K3,3 as minors.

In some cases, the properties of the graphs in a minor-closed family may be closely connected to the properties of their excluded minors. For example a minor-closed graph family &quot;F&quot; has bounded pathwidth if and only if its forbidden minors include a forest, &quot;F&quot; has bounded tree-depth if and only if its forbidden minors include a disjoint union of path graphs, &quot;F&quot; has bounded treewidth if and only if its forbidden minors include a planar graph, and &quot;F&quot; has bounded local treewidth (a functional relationship between diameter and treewidth) if and only if its forbidden minors include an apex graph (a graph that can be made planar by the removal of a single vertex). If &quot;H&quot; can be drawn in the plane with only a single crossing (that is, it has crossing number one) then the &quot;H&quot;-minor-free graphs have a simplified structure theorem in which they are formed as clique-sums of planar graphs and graphs of bounded treewidth. For instance, both &quot;K&quot;5 and &quot;K&quot;3,3 have crossing number one, and as Wagner showed the &quot;K&quot;5-free graphs are exactly the 3-clique-sums of planar graphs and the eight-vertex Wagner graph, while the &quot;K&quot;3,3-free graphs are exactly the 2-clique-sums of planar graphs and &quot;K&quot;5.

==Variations==
===Topological minors=== 
A graph &quot;H&quot; is called a topological minor of a graph &quot;G&quot; if a subdivision of &quot;H&quot; is isomorphic to a subgraph of &quot;G&quot;. Every topological minor is also a minor. The converse however is not true in general (for instance the complete graph &quot;K&quot;5 in the Petersen graph is a minor but not a topological one), but holds for graph with maximum degree not greater than three.

The topological minor relation is not a well-quasi-ordering on the set of finite graphs and hence the result of Robertson and Seymour does not apply to topological minors. However it is straightforward to construct finite forbidden topological minor characterizations from finite forbidden minor characterizations by replacing every branch set with &quot;k&quot; outgoing edges by every tree on &quot;k&quot; leaves that has down degree at least two.

===Induced minors===
A graph &quot;H&quot; is called an induced minor of a graph &quot;G&quot; if it can be obtained from an induced subgraph of &quot;G&quot; by contracting edges. Otherwise, &quot;G&quot; is said to be &quot;H&quot;-induced minor-free.

===Immersion minor===
A graph operation called &quot;lifting&quot; is central in a concept called &quot;immersions&quot;. The &quot;lifting&quot; is an operation on adjacent edges. Given three vertices &quot;v&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, and &quot;w&quot;, where &quot;(v,u)&quot; and &quot;(u,w)&quot; are edges in the graph, the lifting of &quot;vuw&quot;, or equivalent of &quot;(v,u), (u,w)&quot; is the operation that deletes the two edges &quot;(v,u)&quot; and &quot;(u,w)&quot; and adds the edge &quot;(v,w)&quot;. In the case where &quot;(v,w)&quot; already was present, &quot;v&quot; and &quot;w&quot; will now be connected by more than one edge, and hence this operation is intrinsically a multi-graph operation.

In the case where a graph &quot;H&quot; can be obtained from a graph &quot;G&quot; by a sequence of lifting operations (on &quot;G&quot;) and then finding an isomorphic subgraph, we say that &quot;H&quot; is an immersion minor of &quot;G&quot;.
There is yet another way of defining immersion minors, which is equivalent to the lifting operation. We say that &quot;H&quot; is an immersion minor of &quot;G&quot; if there exists an injective mapping from vertices in &quot;H&quot; to vertices in &quot;G&quot; where the images of adjacent elements of &quot;H&quot; are connected in &quot;G&quot; by edge-disjoint paths.

The immersion minor relation is a well-quasi-ordering on the set of finite graphs and hence the result of Robertson and Seymour applies to immersion minors. This furthermore means that every immersion minor-closed family is characterized by a finite family of forbidden immersion minors.

In graph drawing, immersion minors arise as the planarizations of non-planar graphs: from a drawing of a graph in the plane, with crossings, one can form an immersion minor by replacing each crossing point by a new vertex, and in the process also subdividing each crossed edge into a path. This allows drawing methods for planar graphs to be extended to non-planar graphs.

===Shallow minors===
A shallow minor of a graph &quot;G&quot; is a minor in which the edges of &quot;G&quot; that were contracted to form the minor form a collection of disjoint subgraphs with low diameter. Shallow minors interpolate between the theories of graph minors and subgraphs, in that shallow minors with high depth coincide with the usual type of graph minor, while the shallow minors with depth zero are exactly the subgraphs. They also allow the theory of graph minors to be extended to classes of graphs such as the 1-planar graphs that are not closed under taking minors.

===Parity conditions===
An alternative and equivalent definition of a graph minor is that &quot;H&quot; is a minor of &quot;G&quot; whenever the vertices of &quot;H&quot; can be represented by a collection of vertex-disjoint subtrees of &quot;G&quot;, such that if two vertices are adjacent in &quot;H&quot;, there exists an edge with its endpoints in the corresponding two trees in &quot;G&quot;.
An odd minor restricts this definition by adding parity conditions to these subtrees. If &quot;H&quot; is represented by a collection of subtrees of &quot;G&quot; as above, then &quot;H&quot; is an odd minor of &quot;G&quot; whenever it is possible to assign two colors to the vertices of &quot;G&quot; in such a way that each edge of &quot;G&quot; within a subtree is properly colored (its endpoints have different colors) and each edge of &quot;G&quot; that represents an adjacency between two subtrees is monochromatic (both its endpoints are the same color). Unlike for the usual kind of graph minors, graphs with forbidden odd minors are not necessarily sparse. The Hadwiger conjecture, that &quot;k&quot;-chromatic graphs necessarily contain &quot;k&quot;-vertex complete graphs as minors, has also been studied from the point of view of odd minors.

A different parity-based extension of the notion of graph minors is the concept of a bipartite minor, which produces a bipartite graph whenever the starting graph is bipartite. A graph &quot;H&quot; is a bipartite minor of another graph &quot;G&quot; whenever &quot;H&quot; can be obtained from &quot;G&quot; by deleting vertices, deleting edges, and collapsing pairs of vertices that are at distance two from each other along a peripheral cycle of the graph. A form of Wagner&#x27;s theorem applies for bipartite minors: A bipartite graph &quot;G&quot; is a planar graph if and only if it does not have the utility graph &quot;K&quot;3,3 as a bipartite minor.

==Algorithms==
The problem of deciding whether a graph &quot;G&quot; contains &quot;H&quot; as a minor is NP-complete in general; for instance, if &quot;H&quot; is a cycle graph with the same number of vertices as &quot;G&quot;, then &quot;H&quot; is a minor of &quot;G&quot; if and only if &quot;G&quot; contains a Hamiltonian cycle. However, when &quot;G&quot; is part of the input but &quot;H&quot; is fixed, it can be solved in polynomial time. More specifically, the running time for testing whether &quot;H&quot; is a minor of &quot;G&quot; in this case is &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;3), where &quot;n&quot; is the number of vertices in &quot;G&quot; and the big O notation hides a constant that depends superexponentially on &quot;H&quot;; since the original Graph Minors result, this algorithm has been improved to &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;2) time. Thus, by applying the polynomial time algorithm for testing whether a given graph contains any of the forbidden minors, it is theoretically possible to recognize the members of any minor-closed family in polynomial time. This result is not used in practice since the hidden constant is so huge (needing three layers of Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation to express) as to rule out any application, making it a galactic algorithm. Furthermore, in order to apply this result constructively, it is necessary to know what the forbidden minors of the graph family are. In some cases, the forbidden minors are known, or can be computed.

In the case where &quot;H&quot; is a fixed planar graph, then we can test in linear time in an input graph &quot;G&quot; whether &quot;H&quot; is a minor of &quot;G&quot;. In cases where &quot;H&quot; is not fixed, faster algorithms are known in the case where &quot;G&quot; is planar.

<doc id="353045" wikidata="Q735387" url="?curid=353045" title="William McKell">
<text>Sir William John McKell, (26 September 1891 – 11 January 1985) was an Australian politician who served as the 12th Governor-General of Australia, in office from 1947 to 1953. He had previously been Premier of New South Wales from 1941 to 1947, as leader of the Labor Party.

McKell was born in the small town of Pambula, New South Wales, but grew up in Sydney. He left school at thirteen, training as a boilermaker at Mort&#x27;s Dock. McKell soon became involved with the union movement, and after a brief period on the railways began working full-time as a union secretary. He sided with the anti-conscriptionists during the Labor Party split of 1916, and at the 1917 state election defeated James McGowen, a former Labor premier who had been expelled from the party. In 1920, aged 29, McKell was Minister of Justice under John Storey. He also served as a minister under John Dooley and Jack Lang.

During the Labor Party&#x27;s internal tensions in the 1930s, McKell came to be seen as a compromise candidate for the leadership of the party. He replaced Jack Lang as leader of the opposition in 1939, and became premier following Labor&#x27;s victory at the 1941 state election. As premier, McKell oversaw both the war effort and the initial stages of post-war reconstruction, carrying out an ambitious programme of public works as well as various social reforms. He was re-elected with an increased majority at the 1944 election, making him the first Labor premier to win successive elections in New South Wales.

McKell had planned to retire from public life in 1946, but was instead convinced by Ben Chifley to become Governor-General. His appointment was initially controversial due to its openly political nature; Sir Robert Menzies called it &quot;shocking and humiliating&quot;. However, when Menzies returned as prime minister in 1949, they formed an amicable working relationship. Some of McKell&#x27;s actions as Governor-General were unpopular amongst his old Labor Party colleagues, notably his acceptance of a knighthood and his decision to grant Menzies a double dissolution in 1951. In later life, he served as a trustee of the Sydney Cricket Ground, and as a member of the Reid Commission, which drafted the Constitution of Malaysia.

==Early life==
Bill McKell was born in Pambula, New South Wales, the eldest of four children. His father, Robert Pollock McKell, was a butcher who moved the family to Surry Hills in Sydney in 1898. Three years later he abandoned them. For the rest of his life, McKell concealed the matter by saying his father had died young. The family moved to Redfern, with McKell&#x27;s mother working to support the family. He was educated at Bourke Street Public School in Surry Hills. McKell supplemented the family income by working part-time. As well as being a good student, McKell was a talented sportsman.

In 1906, McKell became an apprentice boilermaker at Mort&#x27;s Dock at Balmain in Sydney. He joined the Federated Society of Boilermakers and Iron and Steel Ship-Builders and organized fellow apprentices to fight for improved conditions. Completing his articles, McKell worked for the New South Wales Government Railways from 1913 to 1914. He became full-time Assistant Secretary of the Boilermakers&#x27; Society in 1914.

McKell was also active in the Labor Party (ALP), which he joined in 1908. He was prominent in the Industrial Section, which took control of the Party in 1916. McKell became a member of the State Executive. When Labor split over conscription in that year, McKell was an anti-conscriptionist. James McGowen, MLA for Redfern and first ALP Premier of New South Wales, had been expelled from the party for supporting conscription. McKell defeated McGowen at the 1917 election.

In 1919, McKell bought a house in Redfern that was to be his long-term home. The following year, he married Mary &#x27;Minnie&#x27; Pye (later Lady McKell). The first of three children soon followed. In 1933, McKell bought a property near Goulburn.

==Parliamentary career==

Except for the period of proportional representation (1920–1927), when he was a member for Botany, McKell represented the seat of Redfern until he resigned to become Governor-General in 1947. As an MP, McKell studied for the Bar and was admitted in 1925.

McKell became Minister of Justice after Labor won the 1920 election and retained the position until the Government was defeated in 1922. When Labor regained office under John Thomas (Jack) Lang&#x27;s Leadership in 1925, McKell returned to the Justice portfolio. He also became Lang&#x27;s assistant at Treasury. In May 1927, Lang reconstructed his Cabinet with loyalists. McKell at first retained his post but was dropped on 8 June. When Lang won the 1930 election, McKell became a Minister but was relegated to the minor portfolio of Local Government. In June 1931, McKell again became Justice Minister, where he remained until Lang&#x27;s dismissal by Governor Game in May 1932.

Growing resentment in the labour movement at Lang led to the formation of a breakaway Industrial Labor Party in February 1938 led by MLA for Botany, Robert Heffron. In 1939, the ALP Federal Executive intervened and a unity conference was held in August. Lang&#x27;s opponents had a comfortable majority and took control of the Executive. In the Parliamentary Party ballot on 5 September 1939, McKell had 13 votes, Lang 12 and Heffron seven. In the next ballot, all of Heffron&#x27;s votes went to McKell who became Leader of the Opposition.

==Premier of New South Wales==
In the May 1941 election campaign, McKell outlined a programme of reforms for both city and country NSW. McKell contrasted this with United Australia Party Premier Alexander Mair&#x27;s attitude that all social and other reform had to be postponed because of the war. The result was a victory for McKell, with Labor winning 54 of the 90 seats.

McKell set up a War Effort Co-ordination Committee chaired by himself. The Government built ships, roads, air strips and other defence works. NSW produced munitions and grew food. A vigorous civil defence and air raid precaution programme was instituted.

At the 1944 election, the Government won 56 seats, two more than in 1941. McKell was the first NSW Labor Premier to win a second consecutive term. On 26 March 1945, he broke Lang&#x27;s record as the longest serving ALP Premier. The McKell Government achieved an impressive record in the social, industrial, planning, and environmental areas, including Kosciusko National Park and the Snowy Mountains Scheme.

On 13 February 1946, McKell announced that he was retiring from politics before the next election. Prime Minister Chifley appointed McKell Governor-General. The official announcement was made on 31 January 1947. McKell resigned from Parliament and the Premiership on 6 February.

==Governor-General==
In 1947 Chifley gained formal agreement from George VI for McKell&#x27;s appointment as Governor-General. This occurred only after very considerable opposition from the King and a detailed correspondence between them, also involving the incumbent Governor-General (George&#x27;s brother, the Duke of Gloucester) and the British Foreign Office, the details of which did not come to light for over 50 years. The objection was not personal (George VI had never met McKell) but centred on his being closely associated with a particular political party, and with a particular state. There was no precedent for a serving Australian politician, let alone a party leader and head of government, to be named Governor-General, although there was a South African one and several former Governors-General had strong ties with British political parties. In the end, the King had no option but accept Chifley&#x27;s assurances of McKell&#x27;s personal integrity and that the Crown would not be exposed to any political controversy.

Chifley was determined that the Duke of Gloucester&#x27;s successor should be a native-born Australian, and he seems to have deliberately chosen a Labor man with a working-class background to make a political point. There was an outcry from the Liberal opposition and the conservative press: Robert Menzies called the appointment &quot;shocking and humiliating&quot;. In a debate on a censure motion on 20 February, Menzies said the fact that McKell was actively engaged in politics when the appointment was announced (even though he had since vacated the political stage) was &quot;a grave disqualification&quot; which &quot;strikes at the very foundation of the office of the Governor-Generalship, because that office in Australia should be as far removed from party politics as is the Crown itself in Great Britain&quot;. Chifley, in response, accepted full responsibility for the appointment, said that he offered no apologies, and &quot;I am completely confident that as time goes on I shall have no reason to regret my action&quot;.

McKell kept a dignified silence on the matter of his appointment, rather than conducting a public defence of it. Nevertheless, Chifley publicly argued that any suitable Australian should be capable of being chosen as Governor-General. Once McKell took office on 11 March, however, the continuing respect for the Crown and its representative meant that there was no further criticism. McKell carried out the usual round of his formal duties with dignity, behaved with unfailing respect towards the King himself, and succeeded in winning over all but the most inflexible. When Menzies succeeded Chifley as Prime Minister in December 1949, his relations with McKell were initially civil rather than friendly, but later on, the two men formed a cordial working relationship. Menzies even extended McKell&#x27;s term by 14 months from its initial five years.

The most controversial moment in McKell&#x27;s vice-regal career came in March 1951, when Menzies asked him for a double dissolution election. Labor had retained control of the Senate after the 1949 election, and the Senate had referred the Government&#x27;s banking bill to a committee. Menzies argued that this constituted &quot;failure to pass&quot; in terms of Section 57 of the Australian Constitution. Many in the ALP, though not Chifley, thought that McKell should and would refuse Menzies a double dissolution, but the Governor-General agreed (with little hesitation) to grant one. McKell took the view that an election was necessary (since the Government&#x27;s lower-house majority was still so big that there was no prospect of it losing a House of Representatives vote of confidence, such as in 1941 had ended Sir Arthur Fadden&#x27;s far more vulnerable administration), and that it was for the electorate, not for himself, to determine whether the Senate or Menzies was right. He saw it as his duty to act on the advice of his Prime Minister. Sections of the Labor Party condemned McKell for granting the double dissolution, claiming he had &#x27;ambushed&#x27; his old Party.

On 13 November 1951, McKell accepted a knighthood (Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George) from George VI, who personally invested him at Buckingham Palace while McKell was on an official visit to the United Kingdom. This caused considerable controversy in the Labor Party, as it was Labor policy to have nothing to do with knighthoods (a policy confirmed by the case of Queensland union leader Sir Jack Egerton a generation afterwards); but there was nothing Labor could do about it, since McKell had severed all connections with the party on assuming office. Also it was unprecedented and was still considered somewhat inappropriate, for a Governor-General not to be at least a knight (many had been peers). McKell was the only Australian Governor-General to be knighted during his term, until Quentin Bryce was appointed a Dame of the Order of Australia in March 2014.

McKell&#x27;s Official Secretary for the first few weeks was Sir Leighton Bracegirdle, whose retirement was overdue after serving McKell&#x27;s three predecessors over 16 years. He was succeeded by Sir Murray Tyrrell.

==Later life==
McKell retired in May 1953. From June 1956 to 1957, he served as a member of the Reid Commission, which was responsible for drafting the Constitution of the Federation of Malaya (now Malaysia).

A long time Trustee and former chairman, McKell was a regular at the Sydney Cricket Ground. From the 1970s onwards there was a revival of academic and Labor Party interest in McKell and his legacy. Neville Wran (ALP Premier from 1976 to 1986) named a new state office building after McKell (the McKell Building, in Haymarket), and the party called one of its research bodies the McKell Institute.

McKell died in the Sydney suburb of Waverley in January 1985 aged 93. A memorial service was held at St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral. His widow, Lady (Mary) McKell, survived him by only six months. Both Sir William&#x27;s and Lady McKell&#x27;s ashes are interred at Northern Suburbs Crematorium, North Ryde.

<doc id="353047" wikidata="Q679687" url="?curid=353047" title="Legislative Council of the Isle of Man">
<text>The Legislative Council () is the upper chamber of Tynwald, the legislature of the Isle of Man. The abbreviation &quot;LegCo&quot; is often used.

It consists of eleven members (MLCs):
* Eight members elected by the House of Keys
* Three &quot;ex officio&quot; members:
** President of Tynwald, &quot;ex officio&quot; President of the Legislative Council (casting vote)
** Bishop of Sodor and Man
** Attorney General for the Isle of Man (non-voting)

Historically, most or all elected MLCs were former MHKs, but this practice has now much reduced or ceased.

Formerly, the Lieutenant Governor presided over the Legislative Council and over Tynwald Court (a joint session of the Council and the House of Keys). Now, however, the President of Tynwald, who is chosen by the whole Tynwald for a five-year term, is the &quot;ex officio&quot; President of the Legislative Council, and presides over both the Legislative Council and Tynwald Court, except that the Lieutenant Governor presides once a year on Tynwald Day.

Furthermore, the Church of England Bishop of Sodor and Man and the Attorney General have seats on the Legislative Council. The Bishop is a voting member, the Attorney General is a non-voting member, and the President has the casting vote.

The Council does not usually originate legislation; most of the time, it reviews draft legislation originating in the House of Keys. However, it is possible for legislation to originate in the Council: a recent example is the Equality Act 2017.

==Method of election==
The MLCs are elected by the members of the House of Keys for a term of five years. Four MLCs retire at a time, and four new MLCs are then elected. An MLC must be at least 21 years old and resident in the Isle of Man. Historically the election procedure has been cumbersome, and on some occasions in recent years the election has required many ballots, stretching over a period of weeks or even months. However the Standing Orders of the House of Keys regarding the election of MLCs were amended on 4 April 2017, and a relevant Guidance Note was issued by the Speaker of the House of Keys in June 2017. In 2018, only one ballot was required, although some felt that that was at the cost of allowing members to vote for an excessive number of candidates (one member voted for 13 candidates out of 15 and another for 11).

A motion was proposed in the Keys on 28 January 2020, shortly before the 2020 MLC election, which would have prevented MHKs voting for more candidates than there are places to be filled, but this was rejected.

In 2020, again only one ballot was required, and members voted for an average of about 4 candidates each. In 2023, again only one ballot was required, and members voted for an average of about 5 candidates each.

==2016 Review of the Functioning of Tynwald==
For many years there has been considerable debate about the functioning of Tynwald, and specifically about the composition, method of election, and functions of the Legislative Council. In the past, a number of reforms were made in the composition of the Legislative Council, which are set out below. In 2016 Lord Lisvane was asked to carry out a review of the functioning of Tynwald. Among his recommendations were:

* Members of the Legislative Council should continue not to be directly elected, but instead should be nominated by an independent Nominations Commission to the House of Keys. No sitting MHK could be nominated.
* The Legislative Council should not vote on taxation or appropriation.
* Only exceptionally should MLCs be ministers.
* The Bishop should continue as an &quot;ex officio&quot; voting member of the Legislative Council.

However there has been little action to implement these recommendations.

==1990 reform and current composition==
The Lieutenant Governor was removed as Presiding Officer of Tynwald and replaced by a member of Tynwald elected by the Members of the High Court of Tynwald as President of Tynwald. (Currently only MHKs are electors.) The President of Tynwald is also a member of the Legislative Council and presides at its sittings. The members are thus:

*President of Tynwald
*Attorney General
*Bishop of Sodor and Man
*Eight members elected by the House of Keys

The non-&quot;ex officio&quot; members are elected by the House of Keys for terms which end at the end of February immediately before the fifth anniversary of their election.

==Current membership==

==Membership of the council since 1990==

==Past membership==
==Historical composition==

===Original===

The original function of the Legislative Council was executive (i.e. giving advice to the Lieutenant Governor — or Lords of Mann prior to Revestment) and its membership was entirely appointed, as follows:

*Lieutenant Governor 
*Bishop of Sodor and Man
*First Deemster
*Second Deemster
*Clerk of the Rolls (Position amalgamated with the First Deemster in 1918.)
*Attorney General
*Receiver General
*Water Bailiff (position dissolved 1885)
*Archdeacon of Sodor and Man
*Vicar General of Sodor and Man (At various times there were two of these.)
Historically the &quot;Comptroller&quot; (a position sometimes held together with another office such as that of Receiver-General) and an &quot;Archdeacon&#x27;s Official&quot; were also members.
Before the Reformation the Council included other prelates, such as the Abbot of Rushen.

The first seven were Crown appointments and the last two appointments by the Bishop. Reforms were slowly made to reduce the number of judicial and religious appointments and these members were slowly replaced by indirectly elected members.

===1917 reform===

In 1917, the Judicature (Amendment) Act introduced by the Legislative Council removed Clerk of the Rolls from the composition of the Council. It then consisted of the following members:

* Lieutenant Governor
* Bishop of Sodor and Man
* First Deemster
* Second Deemster
* Attorney General
* Receiver General
* Archdeacon of Sodor and Man
* Vicar General of Sodor and Man

===1919 reform===

In 1919, The Archdeacon; the Vicar General; and the Receiver General were removed as &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the Council by the Isle of Man Constitution Amendment Act 1919. The members were thus:

*Lieutenant Governor
*First Deemster
*Second Deemster
*Attorney General
*Bishop of Sodor and Man
*Two members appointed by the Lieutenant Governor
*Four members elected by the House of Keys

===1961 reform===

Increased the number of elected members from four to five.

===1965 reform===
The Second Deemster lost his seat in the Council. The members were thus:

*Lieutenant Governor
*First Deemster
*Attorney General
*Bishop of Sodor and Man
*Two members appointed by the Lieutenant Governor
*Five members elected by the House of Keys

===1969 reform===

The Isle of Man Constitution Act 1969 removed the two appointed members of the Legislative Council. The members were thus:

* Lieutenant Governor
* First Deemster
* Attorney General
* Bishop of Sodor and Man
* Seven members elected by the House of Keys

===1971 reform===
The Isle of Man Constitution Act 1971 removed the Attorney-General&#x27;s vote, and he no longer counted towards a quorum.

===1975 reform===
The First Deemster lost his seat in the Council, by virtue of the Isle of Man Constitution (Amendment) Act 1975. The members were thus:

*Lieutenant Governor
*Attorney General
*Bishop of Sodor and Man
*Eight members elected by the House of Keys

===1980 reform===
The Lieutenant Governor was removed as Presiding Officer and replaced by an indirectly elected President of the Legislative Council. The Governor still presided at joint sittings of Tynwald. The members were thus:

*President of the Legislative Council
*Attorney General
*Bishop of Sodor and Man
*Eight members elected by the House of Keys

<text>Jan Betley (1908 - 1980) was a Polish painter.

Betley was born in Płock. Before the World War II, he was a student of two well known Polish painters, Tadeusz Pruszkowski and Felicjan Kowarski, at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw (ASP). In 1936, he graduated under the advisory of Pruszkowski and qualified himself as the assistant-professor in 1948. Most of his early paintings were lost during the war time. After the war he taught at the ASP.

He was a member of the &quot;Fourth Group&quot; advocating traditional subjects and perfectionism of technique. He is known for his portraits, landscapes, paintings of horses, battle scenes and genre pieces. He was closely related to Polish Colourism. His works can be found in Polish museums and in private collections in Poland and England.

Betley died in Warsaw at age 72.

<text>In Kapampangan mythology, Mayari is the goddess of the moon and ruler of the world during nighttime.

==In Kapampangan mythology==
In Kampampangan mythology, Bathala, the creator of the world, died without leaving a will. His children &quot;Apolaki&quot; and &quot;Mayari&quot; had a quarrel, for each wanted to rule the world alone. The two fought out the conflict with bamboo clubs (&quot;Zabbors&quot;), back and forth they fought until at last &quot;Apolaki&quot; struck &quot;Mayari&quot; in the face and she became blind in one eye. When he saw his sister stricken, &quot;Apolaki&quot; took pity on her and agreed to rule the earth together but at different times. However, her light is dimmer than her brother&#x27;s due to the loss of her eye.

==In Sambal mythology==

In Sambal mythology, Malayari is chief god of the Sambals, who predominantly live in Zambales. He is the creator of all things, and the omnipotent ruler over life and death. Malayari is a compassionate and loving god, sending rain, health, wealth and abundance to those who deserve it, but punishing those who ignore his commandments. ¶

<text>Vilnius County () is the largest of the 10 counties of Lithuania, located in the east of the country around the city Vilnius and is also known as Capital Region or Sostinės regionas by the Lithuanian statistics department and Eurostat. On 1 July 2010, the county administration was abolished, and since that date, Vilnius County remains as the territorial and statistical unit.

==History==
Until the Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in late 18th century the area belonged to the Vilnius Voivodship and Trakai Voivodship of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In the Russian Empire it belonged to the Northwestern Krai and approximately corresponded to its Vilna Governorate (as of 1843). During World War I, following the German offensive of 1915, it was occupied by the German army. After the war, some parts of the area was ruled by local Polish self-government established after the German Ober-Ost army withdrew from the area.

Following the start of the Polish-Bolshevik War in 1919, it was occupied by the Red Army, which was pushed back by the Polish Army. In 1920, it was again occupied by the Red Army, but the Soviets officially recognized the sovereignty of the Lithuanian Republic over the city immediately after defeat during Battle of Warsaw. During their retreat, the Bolsheviks passed the sovereignty over the area to Lithuania. The Polish commander Józef Piłsudski ordered his subordinate general Lucjan Żeligowski to &quot;rebel&quot; his Lithuanian-Belarusian division and capture the city of Vilnius, without declaring war on Lithuania. The area of the future Vilnius County was seized by the Polish forces without significant opposition from Lithuanian forces and Gen. Żeligowski created a short-lived state called the Republic of Central Lithuania. Following the elections held there in 1922 the state was incorporated into Poland (see Vilnius region, Central Lithuania).

As a result of the Nazi-Soviet Alliance and the Polish Defensive War of 1939, the area was captured by the Soviet Union, which transferred parts of what is now &quot;Vilnius County&quot; and Utena County to Lithuania, only to annex it the following year. In 1941, it was conquered by the Nazi Germany. During World War II, the area saw formation of many resistance units, most notably the Polish Home Army and, after 1943, Soviet partisans. After the war, Vilniaus Apskritis existed as a relic of the pre-war independent state in Lithuanian SSR between 1944 and 1950. In this period, a significant part of its population moved to Poland during the so-called repatriation.

After 1990, when Lithuania became independent, Vilnius county was re-established differently in 1994. This entity has different boundaries than any previous entity and is not directly related to previous entities in this area. The mission of the county is different as well: its primary goal (as in that of Lithuania&#x27;s other counties) is to oversee that municipalities in its area follow the laws of Lithuania.

==Municipalities==
The county is subdivided into six district municipalities, one municipality and one city municipality:

==Demographics==

According to the 2021 census, the county population was 810,797 people, of which:
* Lithuanians – 63.07% (511,426)
* Poles – 21.08% (170,919)
* Russians – 8.65% (70,170)
* Belarusians – 2.59% (21,055)
* Ukrainians – 0.76% (6,170)
* Others / did not specify – 3.82% (31,048)

==Economy==
In 2022, GDP per capita of Vilnius County was €35,300, making it the richest county in Lithuania and Baltic States.
As of 2022, the average monthly gross wage in Vilnius County reached €2,002.

<text>North Somerset is a unitary authority in the ceremonial county of Somerset, England. The council is based in Weston-super-Mare, the area&#x27;s largest town. The district also contains the towns of Clevedon, Nailsea and Portishead, along with a number of villages and surrounding rural areas. Some southern parts of the district fall within the Mendip Hills, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The district was formed in 1974 as the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Avon was abolished in 1996, when the district was renamed North Somerset and its council took on county-level functions from the abolished county council.

The district is on the coast, facing the Bristol Channel to the west. The neighbouring districts are Bristol, Bath and North East Somerset and Somerset.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering four former districts and part of a fifth, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Axbridge Rural District (part, being Steep Holm island and parishes lying generally north of the River Axe and Mendip Hills, rest split between Mendip and Sedgemoor)
*Clevedon Urban District
*Long Ashton Rural District
*Portishead Urban District
*Weston-super-Mare Municipal Borough
The whole area had been part of Somerset prior to the 1974 reforms, but was transferred to the new county of Avon. The new district was named Woodspring after Woodspring Priory, an isolated medieval church near the coast in the parish of Kewstoke, north of Weston-super-Mare.

Following the Banham Review, the county of Avon was abolished in 1996, with the area being divided into unitary authorities responsible for both district and county-level functions. Woodspring became one of the unitary authorities, and the government gave the district the new name &quot;North West Somerset&quot; as part of the reforms. The area was also transferred back to Somerset for the ceremonial purposes of lieutenancy and shrievalty.

In July 1995 the council resolved to change the name to &quot;North Somerset&quot; with effect from when the reforms came into effect on 1 April 1996. Some years later the government identified that the council&#x27;s decision to rename in 1995 may not have been technically valid, and so in 2005 the council passed another resolution formally changing the name to put the matter beyond doubt.

==Governance==

North Somerset Council provides both county-level and district-level services. The whole area is also covered by civil parishes, which form a second tier of local government.

The area comprises the parliamentary constituencies of Weston-super-Mare and North Somerset.

==Settlements==

The principal towns in the district are the coastal towns of Weston-super-Mare, Portishead, Clevedon and Nailsea.

==Places of interest==
North Somerset&#x27;s natural environment and coastal towns attract visitors from nearby cities. Notable geographical features include:
* Gordano Valley
* Mendip Hills – the ridgeway forms part of the district boundary
* Sand Bay and Sand Point
* Worlebury Hill
* Burrington Combe, Goblin Combe, Brockley Combe
* North Somerset Levels

Notable religious sites include Woodspring Priory.

==Economy==
North Somerset&#x27;s economy is traditionally based on agriculture, including sheep raised for wool on the Mendip Hills and dairy farming in the valleys. This is celebrated at the annual North Somerset Show. During the Georgian era tourism became a significant economic sector in the coastal towns, most notably Weston-super-Mare which grew from a small village to a large resort town. Though tourism declined in the mid to late-20th century, in common with most British coastal resorts, this sector of the economy has stabilised.

In the 19th century the major port city of Bristol found that modern ships had outgrown the narrow river approach and the Port of Bristol company began seeking locations for new docks on the coast. The first of these was Portishead Dock, which handled coal from South Wales, though this too has seen shipping outgrow its facilities. The newer Royal Portbury Dock is noted for the large volume of car imports.

==Demographics==
North Somerset covers an area of around and has a resident population of 193,000 (1.4% BME) living in 85,000 households.

The population of North Somerset has doubled since the 1950s and is predicted to rise by 6,184 or 3.0% to 2011 and by 17% to 2026. Whilst the proportion of people in North Somerset who are under 45 is lower than the national average, population growth is predicted to be strongest in the 2034 age group. Conversely North Somerset has a 4.2% higher percentage of older people (60+ female, 65+ male) than the rest of England and Wales. This disparity increases with age with the percentage of the population over 75 years almost 30% higher than the national average, resulting in a relatively aged population.

In 2001 there were 134,132 people of working age living in North Somerset and 91,767 were in employment; an economic activity rate of 68.4%. This is very close to the economic activity rate of the West of England sub-region which was 68.8% in the 2001 census.

The 2001 census stated that 1.38% of North Somerset residents identified themselves as belonging to a visible ethnic group and a further 1.27% identified themselves as &#x27;white other&#x27;.

<text>North Tyneside is a metropolitan borough in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear, England. It forms part of the greater Tyneside conurbation. North Tyneside Council is headquartered at Cobalt Park, Wallsend.

North Tyneside is bordered by Newcastle upon Tyne to the west, the North Sea to the east, the River Tyne to the south and Northumberland to the north. Within its bounds are the towns of Wallsend, North Shields, Killingworth, Tynemouth and Whitley Bay, which form a continuously built-up area contiguous with Newcastle upon Tyne.

==History==
The borough was formed on 1 April 1974 by the merger of the county borough of Tynemouth, with the borough of Wallsend, part of the borough of Whitley Bay, the urban district of Longbenton and part of the urban district of Seaton Valley, all of which were in Northumberland. Killingworth was built as a new town in the 1960s and became part of North Tyneside.

==Geography==
The following places are located in North Tyneside:

*Annitsford
*Backworth
*Battle Hill
*Benton
*Burradon
*Camperdown
*Cullercoats
*Dudley
*Earsdon
*Forest Hall
*Holystone
*Howdon
*Killingworth
*Longbenton
*Meadow Well
*Monkseaton
*Moorside
*Murton
*New York
*North Shields
*Northumberland Park
*Palmersville
*Percy Main
*Preston
*Seaton Burn
*Shiremoor
*Tynemouth
*Wallsend
*Wellfield
*West Allotment
*West Moor
*Whitley Bay
*Willington Quay
North Tyneside is split by the A19: the west of the borough is more urban, and is mostly contiguous with the city of Newcastle. The towns in the east of the borough are more separate from the central part of the Newcastle urban area. Many of the most affluent neighbourhoods in Tyne and Wear are found in the coastal part of the borough.

==Governance==

Unlike most English districts, North Tyneside Council is led by a directly elected mayor; since May 2013, this post has been held by Norma Redfearn of the Labour Party. She was most recently elected on 6 May 2021.

The council has sixty elected members, three from each of the twenty wards in the borough. Elections are staggered into thirds, with one councillor from each ward elected each year for three consecutive years, and the mayoral election held on the fourth year.

North Tyneside is part of the North East Mayoral Combined Authority, which is chaired by the directly elected Mayor of the North East; there are therefore two directly elected mayors covering North Tyneside. The combined authority was established in 2024 covering North Tyneside, County Durham, Gateshead, Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, South Tyneside and Sunderland.

==Economy==

North Tyneside lies in the coalfield that covers the South-East of the historic county of Northumberland. It has traditionally been a centre of heavy industry along with the rest of Tyneside, with for example the Swan Hunter shipyard in Wallsend, and export of coal. Today most of the heavy industry has gone, leaving high unemployment in some areas (over the borough, 5.1% compared to 3.7% for the UK in 2022).

==Transport==

Two key roads serve North Tyneside:

*The A19 which leaves the A1 north of Newcastle and runs through the borough and then through the Tyne Tunnel to South Tyneside, Teesside and towards the South.
*The Coast Road (A1058) runs from Newcastle to the coast. For most of its length it is grade-separated.

North Tyneside is served by 17 stations on the Tyne and Wear Metro on a loop from Newcastle through Wallsend, North Shields, Whitley Bay, Benton and back to Newcastle. Trains operate at least every 15 minutes, with extra services in the peak hours. Most of the stations serving North Tyneside fall into fare zones B and C.

There are no National Rail stations in the borough, despite the East Coast Main Line and Blyth and Tyne routes passing through. The nearest National Rail stations are Cramlington, Manors and Newcastle, which is also served by the Tyne &amp; Wear Metro.

North Tyneside has an extensive bus network, with most areas benefiting from direct services to Newcastle. Many areas have direct bus services to Cramlington, Blyth or Morpeth. The principle bus operators in the area are Arriva North East (all areas), Go North East (most areas) and Stagecoach in Newcastle (Benton, Forest Hall, Killingworth and Wallsend).

The Shields Ferry links North Shields to South Shields, in South Tyneside.

There is an international ferry terminal at Royal Quays in North Shields, with a service to Amsterdam (IJmuiden).

<text>Redcar is a seaside town on the Yorkshire Coast in the Redcar and Cleveland unitary authority. It is in the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire, England, and is located east of Middlesbrough.

The Teesside built-up area&#x27;s Redcar subdivision had a population of 37,073 at the 2011 Census. The town is made up of Coatham, Dormanstown, Kirkleatham, Newcomen, West Dyke, Wheatlands and Zetland.

It gained a town charter in 1922, from then until 1968 it was governed by the municipal borough of Redcar. Since the abolition of County Borough of Teesside, which existed from 1968 until 1974, the town has been unparished.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Redcar occupies a low-lying site by the sea; the second element of its name is from Old Norse &quot;kjarr&quot;, meaning &#x27;marsh&#x27;, and the first may be either Old English (Anglo-Saxon) &quot;rēad&quot; meaning &#x27;red&#x27; or OE &quot;hrēod&quot; &#x27;reed&#x27;. The town originated as a fishing hamlet in the 14th century, trading with the larger adjacent hamlet of Coatham. Until the mid-19th century it was within the parish of Marske-by-the-Sea – mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086.

=== Zetland lifeboat ===

Numerous ships have foundered off the Redcar coastline and many of their wrecks still exist. The &quot;Zetland&quot; is the world&#x27;s oldest surviving lifeboat. It was built by Henry Greathead of South Shields and is housed in a volunteer-led sea-front museum. The lifeboat was first stationed at Redcar in 1802.

=== Victorian Era ===
As seaside holidays became fashionable in the early 19th century, Redcar&#x27;s facilities expanded. By 1841, Redcar had 794 inhabitants. In 1846, work was completed on the Middlesbrough and Redcar Railway and the presently named station, created to attract tourism and trade.

Redcar&#x27;s population expansion corresponded with Middlesbrough&#x27;s, with the discovery in 1850 of iron ore in the Eston area of Cleveland Hills. Redcar prospered as a seaside town drawing tourists attracted by eight miles of sands stretching from South Gare to Saltburn-by-the-Sea.

Plans for a pier were drawn up in 1866, but lay dormant until prompted by the announcement of plans to build a pier at Coatham in 1871. Coatham Pier was wrecked before it was completed when two sailing ships were driven through it in a storm. It had to be shortened because of the cost of repairs and was re-opened with an entrance with two kiosks and a roller-skating rink on the Redcar side, and a bandstand halfway along its length.

Redcar Racecourse was created in 1875. Redcar Pier, another pier as well as Coatham Pier, was built in the late 1870s. In October 1880 the brig &quot;Luna&quot; caused £1,000 worth of damage to this pier. In New Year&#x27;s Eve 1885 &quot;SS Cochrane&quot; demolished the landing stage. and in 1897 the schooner &quot;Amarant&quot; went through the pier. A year later, its head and bandstand burned down.

In October 1898 the Coatham Pier was almost wrecked when the barque &quot;Birger&quot; struck it and the pier was thereafter allowed to disintegrate. An anchor from the &quot;Birger&quot; can be seen on the sea front pavement close to the Zetland Lifeboat Museum.

In 1907 a pavilion ballroom was built on Redcar Pier behind the entrance kiosks and in 1928 it was extended. A glass house for concerts was added to the remains of Coatham Pier&#x27;s entrance. The presently named railway station was built in 1929.

In 1929 Coatham Pier&#x27;s glasshouse was replaced by the New Pavilion theatre. After the war, comedian and entertainer Larry Grayson coined his catchphrase &quot;Shut that Door!&quot; while performing there, since the stage door was open to the cold North Sea breeze.

=== Second World War ===
Redcar Pier was deliberately breached (sectioned) in 1940 to prevent its use by enemy invasion forces. As a result of sectioning, damage by a mine explosion and deterioration it was never reconnected and instead allowed to become even more dilapidated.

=== Post war ===

In 1964 the New Pavilion Theatre was transformed into the Regent Cinema. The Redcar Pier pavilion continued in use after the war but storm damage led to it being declared unsafe and it was demolished in 1980–1981.

===Redcar Steelworks===

The town&#x27;s main employers in the post-war era were the nearby Teesside Steelworks at Warrenby, founded by Dorman Long in 1917, and the ICI Wilton chemical works. The steel produced at Dorman Long was used to build the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Tyne Bridge, Auckland Harbour Bridge and many others. Both the Warrenby and Lackenby sites became part of Tata Steel when Corus was taken over in 2007, but continued to trade under the Corus name until at least February 2008. SSI bought the plant from Tata Steel in February 2011, for £320 million.

After a two-year hiatus following the mothballing of the plant in February 2010, steel was once again being made at Redcar. The Thai owners of the former Corus Plant at Lackenby, Sahaviriya Steel Industries (SSI), re-ignited the blast furnace, one of the largest in Europe, on 15 April 2012.

On 18 September 2015, production was paused due to the decline in steel prices. On 28 September 2015, the plant was &quot;mothballed&quot; amid poor steel trading conditions across the world and a drop in steel prices. On 2 October, the owner of the site, SSI UK, entered liquidation. On 12 October 2015 the administrator announced that there was no realistic prospect of finding a buyer and the ovens would be extinguished.

== Governance ==
===Wards and areas===
Wards periodically change, as of 2018 the town is made up of Coatham, Dormanstown, Kirkleatham, Newcomen, West Dyke, Wheatlands and Zetland. Redcar is made up of areas that do not lend their name to a ward: Warrenby, Lakes Estate, Redcar East, The Ings, Ings Farm, Mickledales and Westfield.

===Authority===
Redcar was formerly a township and chapelry in the parishes of Marske and Upleatham. In 1866, Redcar became a separate civil parish. A district in Redcar&#x27;s name formed in 1885. Three years after the district was formed, the centuries-old Yorkshire authority was replaced by the North Riding of Yorkshire county council. The district became an urban district in 1894.
The settlement&#x27;s town charter occurred in 1922, the district was able to be styled as a municipal borough and the settlement as a town. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished and merged with Teesside and Marske. 

The 1974 reform created the non-metropolitan County of Cleveland, under the Langbaurgh non-metropolitan district. The county was also inserted into the North East England region. After further changes in 1996, the district became a unitary authority called Redcar &amp; Cleveland in the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire, the county straddling two regions of England.

The North East England region was sub-divided into combined authorities. In May 2017, the Tees Valley which includes Redcar, elected its first mayor. Ben Houchen has been Tees Valley Mayor since 2017, winning the inaugural mayoral election in the combined authority. Houchen was re-elected in 2021 and won a third term in 2024.

===Parliament===
The town of Redcar is within the Redcar parliamentary constituency, which also includes neighbouring South Bank, Eston, Ormesby (part), Nunthorpe (part) and Guisborough. 

==Culture and community==
===Culture===
The Palace Hub, on the beach front, was built by Redcar and Cleveland Council for the creative and cultural sector of the town. An art gallery and business start up centre are located in the building. The main library is in the Redcar Heart building in the centre of the town and there is a long-standing Redcar Literary Institute, which was founded in 1896.

Redcar is home to the Tuned In! Centre, which opened in 2011 and overlooks the sea front. The multi purpose venue hosts live music as well as creative workshops for young people. The annual event Clubland on the Beach, which showcases dance acts attracting visitors from across the country, has been held at Majuba Road in Redcar for the past three years.

===Parks===

The town has had several parks built for tourism: Coatham Enclosure, Locke Park, Zetland Park, Lily Park, an Amusement Park with a roller coaster, and a small sea front park known locally as &quot;Titty Bottle Park&quot;. The Amusement Park near the railway closed decades ago, and &quot;Titty Bottle Park&quot; was absorbed into the redeveloped sea front around Redcar Beacon.

== Landmarks ==
=== Towers ===

At the west end of High Street is a Grade II listed clock tower,
a memorial to King Edward VII. 

Construction of the Redcar Beacon started in 2011.
In 2013, when the building had been completed, it was nominated for the &quot;Building Design&quot; Carbuncle Cup for worst new building. It came third in the whole of the UK. In December 2015, the Beacon was damaged by winds from Storm Desmond, with several large pieces of panelling falling onto the beach below. It was also damaged in winter 2016, where a panel from the top fell off in a storm.

===Buildings===

There are 23 listed buildings in Redcar. The Grade I Listed Sir William Turner&#x27;s Hospital in Kirkleatham was built between 1674–1676 and listed on the 14 June 1952.

On the Esplanade is the Grade II-Listed Zetland Lifeboat Museum housing the world&#x27;s oldest lifeboat Zetland Lifeboat.

The Victorian, former Coatham Hotel stands on Newcomen Terrace sea front. The ballroom of the hotel was home to the Redcar Jazz Club, a venue for bands of the late 1960s and early 1970s.

===Structures and sculptures===
In the south-east of Redcar is an aircraft listening post. This was built in 1916, during the First World War, as part of a regional defence system to give early warning of approaching aircraft, principally Zeppelins. It is an example of an acoustic mirror, similar to others found along the east coast of Britain. The mirror was used up until the invention of radar.
It is now a Grade II listed building.

== Demographics ==
==Religion==
Catholic churches 

In 1874, four furnaces were built at the nearby Warrenby ironworks, which attracted a lot of Irish Catholic workers. So, a small church dedicated to the Sacred Heart was built to welcome Redcar&#x27;s Catholics to Mass. In the same year, a school-chapel was also built, which later became a Methodist chapel. The present Sacred Heart church, was built, in the fully-developed Gothic Revival style, soon afterwards. It opened in 1914.

The architect Frank Spinks was commissioned to build St Augustine&#x27;s church for the eastern part of the town, in 1937. These parishes were followed by St William&#x27;s church in Dormanstown and St Alban&#x27;s church, which was built amongst the newer housing estates of the 1960s and 70s. 

With declining congregations, the number of parishes was reduced. In 2011, St Alban’s closed, and in 2012, St William’s also closed.  The new parish of Blessed Nicholas Postgate was formed through the union of the parishes of the Sacred Heart and St Augustine, in 2015. Five years later, in 2020, the nearby Saltburn parish of St Bede’s Church, was also absorbed into the Parish of Blessed Nicholas Postgate.

Church of England 
To the east of Redcar there is the Anglican 
Church of St Peter, designed by Ignatius Bonomi and built 1822–29 on land given by Lord Dundas. It is a grade II* listed building. 
 The foundation stone was laid by Lady Turner of Kirkleatham in 1823. Formerly, it was part of Marske Parish, but became an independent parish in 1867. It has a window commemorating local benefactor Sir William Turner.

== Transport ==

Redcar has two railway stations, on the Tees Valley line, with trains operated by Northern and TransPennine Express, namely Redcar Central and Redcar East. A third station Redcar British Steel, which closed in December 2019, served the steelworks.

The main roads through the town are the A1085 and the A1042, with the A174 bypassing. Redcar is served primarily by Arriva North East buses, connecting Redcar with the surrounding towns and villages.

The Pangea North and CANTAT-3 submarine telecommunication cables both come ashore between Redcar and Marske-by-the-Sea.

== Education ==
The town&#x27;s further education college is Redcar &amp; Cleveland College.

The town&#x27;s secondary schools are: Outwood Academy Redcar, Sacred Heart Catholic Secondary and Rye Hills Academy.

There are eleven primary schools in Redcar: Coatham, Dormanstown, Green Gates, Ings Farm, John E Batty, Lakes, Newcomen, Riverdale, St Benedict&#x27;s, Wheatlands and Zetland.

<text>Inês de Castro (; in Castilian: Inés; 1325 – 7 January 1355) was a Galician noblewoman and courtier, best known as lover and posthumously recognized wife of King Pedro I of Portugal. The dramatic circumstances of her relationship with Pedro (at the time Prince of Portugal), which was forbidden by his father King Afonso IV, her murder at the orders of Afonso, Pedro&#x27;s bloody revenge on her killers, and the legend of the coronation of her exhumed corpse by Pedro, have made Inês de Castro a frequent subject of art, music, drama and poetry through the ages.

==Biography==
Inês was the natural daughter of Pedro Fernández de Castro, Lord of Lemos and Sarria, and his noble Portuguese mistress Aldonça Lourenço de Valadares. Her family descended both from the Galician and Portuguese nobilities. She was also well connected to the Castilian royal family, by illegitimate descent. Her stepmother was Infanta Beatriz of Portugal, the youngest daughter of Afonso of Portugal, Lord of Portalegre and Violante Manuel. Her grandmother was Violante Sánchez of Castile, Lady of Uzero, the illegitimate daughter of Sancho IV of Castile. Her great-great grandfather was Rodrigo Alfonso de León, Lord of Aliger, the illegitimate son of Alfonso IX of León. She also descended from Infanta Sancha Henriques of Portugal, the daughter of Henry, Count of Portugal.

Inês came to Portugal in 1340 as a lady-in-waiting of Constance of Castile, recently married to Pedro, the heir apparent to the Portuguese throne. The prince fell in love with her and started to neglect his lawful wife, endangering the already feeble relations with Castile. Moreover, Pedro&#x27;s love for Inês brought the exiled Castilian nobility very close to power, with Inês&#x27; brothers becoming the prince&#x27;s friends and trusted advisors. King Afonso IV of Portugal, Pedro&#x27;s father, disliked Inês&#x27; influence on his son and waited for their mutual infatuation to wear off, but it did not.

Constance of Castile died in 1349. Afonso IV tried several times to arrange for his son to be remarried, but Pedro refused. Afonso IV had banished Inês from the court in 1344. After several attempts to keep the lovers apart, Afonso IV ordered Inês&#x27; death. Pêro Coelho, Álvaro Gonçalves, and Diogo Lopes Pacheco went to the Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Velha in Coimbra, where Inês was living at the time, and killed her, decapitating her in front of her small children.

Pedro became king of Portugal in 1357 (Pedro I of Portugal). He then sought out Inês&#x27; killers, who had gone into exile in Castile, and managed to capture Coelho and Gonçalves in 1361. He executed them publicly by ripping their hearts out, claiming they didn&#x27;t have one after having pulverized his own heart. He also stated that he had secretly married Inês, although his word was, and still is, the only proof of the marriage. During the 1383–85 Crisis of royal succession in Portugal, João das Regras produced evidence that allegedly established that Pope Innocent VI had refused Pedro&#x27;s request to recognize his marriage to Inês and legitimize his children by her, the elder of whom, John, Duke of Valencia de Campos would have a strong potential claim to the throne of Portugal. By negating these children&#x27;s claimed legitimacy, João das Regras strengthened the claim of another illegitimate child of Pedro I of Portugal: John, Master of Aviz, who ultimately took the throne and ruled as John I of Portugal.

Some sources say that after Pedro became king of Portugal, he had Inês&#x27; body exhumed from her grave and forced the entire court to swear allegiance to their new queen: &quot;The king [Pedro] caused the body of his beloved Inês to be disinterred, and placed on a throne, adorned with the diadem and royal robes, and required all the nobility of the kingdom to approach and kiss the hem of her garment, rendering her when dead that homage which she had not received in her life...&quot; Some modern sources characterize the story of Inês&#x27; post-mortem coronation as a &quot;legend&quot; and it is most likely a myth, since the story only appeared in 1577 in Jerónimo Bermúdez&#x27; play &quot;Nise Laureada.&quot; She was later buried at the Monastery of Alcobaça where her tomb can still be seen, opposite Pedro&#x27;s, so that, according to legend, at the Last Judgment Pedro and Inês can look at each other as they rise from their graves. However, initially their tombs were disposed side by side, only being put opposite each other centuries after their deaths. Both tombs are exquisitely sculpted with scenes from their lives and a promise by Pedro that they would be together &quot;até ao fim do mundo&quot; (until the end of the world).

==Issue==
Inês de Castro and Pedro I had the following children, who were legitimized by Pedro I on 19 March 1361:
*Afonso, died shortly after birth.
*John, Duke of Valencia de Campos, claimant to the throne during the 1383–85 Crisis.
*Denis, Lord of Cifuentes, claimant to the throne during the 1383–1385 Crisis.
*Beatrice, married Sancho of Castile, Count of Alburquerque and was thereby the great-grandmother of Ferdinand II of Aragon, and thereby an ancestor of all Spanish monarchs.

==Inês de Castro in literature and music==
Inês de Castro&#x27;s story is immortalized in several plays and poems in Portuguese, such as &quot;The Lusíadas&quot; by Luís de Camões (canto iii, stanzas 118-135), and Spanish, such as &quot;Nise lastimosa&quot; and &quot;Nise laureada&quot; (1577) by Jerónimo Bermúdez, &quot;Reinar despues de morir&quot; by Luís Vélez de Guevara, as well as by the comtesse de Genlis (Inès de Castro, 1826), and in a play by French playwright Henry de Montherlant called &quot;La Reine morte&quot; (&quot;The Dead Queen&quot;). &quot;Inês de Castro&quot; is a novel by Maria Pilar Queralt del Hierro (es) in Spanish and Portuguese. 

Works written in English include Aphra Behn&#x27;s novel &quot;Agnes de Castro, or, the Force of Generous Love&quot; (1688); and Catharine Trotter Cockburn&#x27;s play &quot;Agnes de Castro&quot; (1695). Mary Russell Mitford also wrote a drama from the story entitled &quot;Inez de Castro. The Undiscovered Island,&quot; a novel in English by Darrell Kastin, features a descendant&#x27;s version of the events in the tragedy of Inês de Castro and Dom Pedro. It was published in 2009 by Tagus Press, University of Mass, Dartmouth. 

Felicia Hemans&#x27; poem &quot;The Coronation of Inez de Castro&quot; first appeared in The New Monthly Magazine in 1828.

She is a recurring figure in Ezra Pound&#x27;s &quot;The Cantos&quot;. She appears first at the end of Canto III, in the lines &quot;Ignez da Castro murdered, and a wall/Here stripped, here made to stand&quot;.

There have been over 20 operas and ballets created about Inês de Castro. Operas from the 18th and 19th centuries include:
*&quot;Ines di Castro&quot; by Bernhard Anselm Weber (1790, Hanover) 
*&quot;Ines di Castro&quot; by Niccolò Antonio Zingarelli (1798) 
*&quot;Ines de Castro&quot; by Walter Savage Landor (1831)
*&quot;Ines de Castro&quot; by Giuseppe Persiani to a libretto by Salvadore Cammarano (1835) 
*&quot;Ines di Castro&quot; by Pietro Antonio Coppola (1842, Lisbon)

In modern times, Inês de Castro has continued to inspire operatic works, including:
*&quot;Ines de Castro&quot; by Scottish composer James MacMillan. This work was first performed at the 1996 Edinburgh International Festival
*&quot;&quot; (&quot;Rage&quot;) in German by Swiss composer Andrea Lorenzo Scartazzini. The world premiere of this work was given at the Theater Erfurt, Germany, on 9 September 2006.
*&quot;Ines de Castro&quot; by American composer Thomas Pasatieri. This work premiered in 1976 with the Baltimore Opera Company.
*&quot;Ines&quot; by Canadian composer James Rolfe. Premiered in 2009 by the Queen of Puddings Music Theatre Company in Toronto.

In addition, Portuguese composer Pedro Camacho (born 1979) composed the Requiem to Inês de Castro, first performed on March 28, 2012, in New Cathedral of Coimbra on the occasion of 650 years of the transportation of Ines de Castro&#x27;s body from Coimbra to Alcobaça Monastery.
Christopher Bochman, with the Lisbon Youth Orchestra, has produced an opera &quot;Corpo E Alma&quot; (Body and Soul) focusing on Pedro&#x27;s transition from a sensual to a spiritual love following her death, drawing on various aspects of the tale.

== Popular culture ==

The 2005 TV series &quot;Pedro e Inês&quot; recounts the love story.

The 2018 film &quot;Pedro e Inês&quot; (released as &quot;The Dead Queen&quot; internationally), based on the novel by Rosa Lobato de Faria retells the story of Inês de Castro (played by Joana de Verona) and King Pedro I of Portugal (Diogo Amaral). The film was met with some acclaim, winning 5 awards including Best Ensemble - National Competition at the CinEuphoria Awards 2019. Director António Ferreira received best director at Prémios Fantastic (2019) and Prémios Áquila (2020).

<text>Barrow-in-Furness is a port town and civil parish (as just &quot;Barrow&quot;) in the Westmorland and Furness district of Cumbria, England. Historically in Lancashire, it was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1867 and merged with Dalton-in-Furness Urban District in 1974 to form the Borough of Barrow-in-Furness. The borough was merged into the new Westmorland and Furness district in 2023. At the tip of the Furness peninsula, close to the Lake District, it is bordered by Morecambe Bay, the Duddon Estuary and the Irish Sea. In 2021, Barrow&#x27;s population was 55,489, making it the second largest urban area in Cumbria after Carlisle, and the largest in the Westmorland and Furness unitary authority. 

Natives of Barrow, as well as the local dialect, are known as Barrovian. In the Middle Ages, Barrow was a small hamlet within the parish of Dalton-in-Furness with Furness Abbey, now on the outskirts of the town, controlling the local economy before its dissolution in 1537. The iron prospector Henry Schneider arrived in Furness in 1839 and, with other investors, opened the Furness Railway in 1846 to transport iron ore and slate from local mines to the coast. Further hematite deposits were discovered, of sufficient size to develop factories for smelting and exporting steel. For a period in the late 19th century, the Barrow Hematite Steel Company-owned steelworks was the world&#x27;s largest.

Barrow&#x27;s location and the availability of steel allowed the town to develop into a significant producer of naval vessels, a shift that was accelerated during World War I and the local yard&#x27;s specialisation in submarines. The original iron- and steel-making enterprises closed down after World War II, leaving Vickers shipyard as Barrow&#x27;s main industry and employer. Several Royal Navy flagships, the vast majority of its nuclear submarines as well as numerous other naval vessels, ocean liners and oil tankers have been manufactured at the facility.

The end of the Cold War and subsequent decrease in military spending saw high unemployment in the town through lack of contracts; despite this, the BAE Systems shipyard remains operational as the UK&#x27;s largest by workforce (12,000 employees in 2024) and is now undergoing a major expansion associated with the submarine programme. Furthermore, in 2023 it was announced that a new class of nuclear submarine, associated with the trilateral AUKUS military alliance, will be designed and principally constructed in Barrow. 

Today Barrow is also a hub for energy generation and handling. Offshore wind farms form one of the highest concentrations of turbines in the world, including the second largest offshore farm, with multiple operating bases in Barrow.

==Toponymy==
The name was originally that of an island, Barrai, which can be traced back to 1190. This was later renamed Old Barrow, recorded as Oldebarrey in 1537, and Old Barrow Insula and Barrohead in 1577. The island was then joined to the mainland and the town took its name. The name itself seems to mean &quot;island with promontory&quot;, combining British &quot;barro-&quot; and Old Norse &quot;ey&quot;, but it is more likely that Scandinavian settlers simply accepted &quot;barro-&quot; as a meaningless name, and so added an explanatory Old Norse second element.

===Nicknames===
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Barrow was nicknamed &quot;the English Chicago&quot; because of the sudden and rapid growth in its industry, economic stature and overall size. More recently the town has been dubbed the &quot;capital of blue-collar Britain&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, reflecting its strong working class identity. Barrow is also often jokingly referred to as being at the end of the longest cul-de-sac in the country because of its isolated location at the tip of the Furness peninsula.

==History==
===Early history===
Barrow and the surrounding area has been settled non-continuously for several millennia with evidence of Neolithic inhabitants on Walney Island. Despite a rich history of Roman settlement across Cumbria and the discovery of related artefacts in the Barrow area, no buildings or structures have been found to support the idea of a functioning Roman community on the Furness peninsula. The Furness Hoard discovery of Viking silver coins and other artefacts in 2011 provided significant archaeological evidence of Norse settlement in the early 9th century. Several areas of Barrow including Yarlside and Ormsgill, as well as &quot;Barrow&quot; and &quot;Furness&quot;, have names of Old Norse origin. The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded the settlements of Hietun, Rosse and Hougenai, which are now the districts of Hawcoat, Roose and Walney respectively.
In the Middle Ages the Furness peninsula was controlled by the Cistercian monks of the Abbey of St Mary of Furness, known as Furness Abbey. This was in the &quot;Vale of Nightshade&quot;, now on the outskirts of the town. Founded for the Savigniac order, it was built on the orders of King Stephen in 1123. Soon after the abbey&#x27;s foundation the monks discovered iron ore deposits, later to provide the basis for the Furness economy. These thin strata, close to the surface, were extracted through open cut workings, which were then smelted by the monks. The proceeds from mining, along with agriculture and fisheries, meant that by the 15th century the abbey had become the second richest and most powerful Cistercian abbey in England, after Fountains Abbey in Yorkshire. The monks of Furness Abbey constructed a wooden tower on nearby Piel Island in 1212 which acted as their main trading point; it was twice invaded by the Scots, in 1316 and 1322. In 1327 King Edward III gave Furness Abbey a licence to crenellate the tower, and a motte-and-bailey castle was built. However Barrow itself was just a hamlet in the parish of Dalton-in-Furness, reliant on the land and sea for survival. Small quantities of iron and ore were exported from jetties on the channel separating the village from Walney Island. Aside from Furness Abbey and Piel Castle the oldest surviving buildings in Barrow are cottages and farmhouses in Newbarns and Ormsgill which date back to the early 17th century; as well as Rampside Hall, a Grade I listed building and the best-preserved in the Barrow area from the 1600s. Even as late as 1843 there were still only 32 dwellings, including two pubs.

===19th century===

In 1839 Henry Schneider arrived as a young speculator and dealer in iron, and he discovered large deposits of haematite in 1850. He and other investors founded the Furness Railway, the first section of which opened in 1846, to transport the ore from the slate quarries at Kirkby-in-Furness and haematite mines at Lindal-in-Furness and Askam and Ireleth to a deep-water harbour near Roa Island. The crucial and difficult link across Morecambe Bay between Ulverston and Carnforth on the main line was promoted, as the Ulverston and Lancaster Railway, by a group led by John Brogden and opened in 1857. It was promptly purchased by the Furness Railway.

The docks built between 1863 and 1881 in the more sheltered channel between the mainland and Barrow Island replaced the port at Roa Island. The first dock to open was Devonshire Dock in 1867, and Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone stated his belief that &quot;Barrow would become another Liverpool&quot;. The increasing quantities of iron ore mined in Furness were then brought into the centre of Barrow to be transported by sea.
The investors in the burgeoning mining and railway industries decided that greater profits could be made by smelting the iron ore and converting the resultant pig-iron into steel, and then exporting the finished product. Schneider and James Ramsden, the railway&#x27;s general manager, erected blast furnaces at Barrow that by 1876 formed the largest steelworks in the world. Its success was a result of the availability of local iron ore and coal from the Cumberland mines and easy rail and sea transport. The Furness Railway, which counted local aristocrats the 7th Duke of Devonshire and the Duke of Buccleuch as investors, kick-started the Industrial Revolution on the peninsula. The railway brought mined ore to the town, where the steelworks produced large quantities of steel. It was used for shipbuilding, and derived products such as rails were also exported from the newly built docks.

Barrow&#x27;s population grew rapidly. Population figures for the town itself were not collected until 1871, though sources suggest that Barrow&#x27;s population was still as low as 700 in 1851. During the first half of the 19th century, Barrow formed part of the parish of Dalton-in-Furness, the population of which shows some of Barrow&#x27;s early growth from the 1850s:

Population of the Parish of Dalton-in-Furness
In 1871 Barrow&#x27;s population was recorded at 18,584 and in 1881 at 47,259, less than forty years after the railway was built. The majority of migrants originated from elsewhere in Lancashire although significant numbers settled in Barrow from Ireland and Scotland, which represented 11% and 7% of the local population in the 1890s. By the turn of the 20th century, the Scottish-born population had increased to form the highest portion anywhere in England. Other notable immigrant groups included Cornish people who represented 80% of the district of Roose&#x27;s population at the time of the 1881 census. In an attempt to diversify Barrow&#x27;s economy James Ramsden founded the Barrow and Calcutta Jute Company in 1870 and the Barrow Jute Works was soon constructed alongside the Furness Railway line in Hindpool. The mill employed 2,000 women at its peak and was awarded a gold medal for its produce at the 1878 Paris Exposition Universelle.
The sheltered strait between Barrow and Walney Island was an ideal location for the shipyard. The first ship to be built, the &quot;Jane Roper&quot;, was launched in 1852; the first steamship, a 3,000-ton liner named &quot;Duke of Devonshire&quot;, in 1873. Shipbuilding activity increased, and on 18 February 1871 the Barrow Shipbuilding Company was incorporated. Barrow&#x27;s relative isolation from the United Kingdom&#x27;s industrial heartlands meant that the newly formed company included several capabilities that would usually be subcontracted to other establishments. In particular, a large engineering works was constructed including a foundry and pattern shop, a forge, and an engine shop. In addition, the shipyard had a joiners&#x27; shop, a boat-building shed and a sailmaking and rigging loft.

During these boom years, Ramsden proposed building a planned town to accommodate the large workforce which had arrived. There are few planned towns in the United Kingdom, and Barrow is one of the oldest. Its centre contains a grid of well-built terraced houses, with a tree-lined road leading away from a central square. Ramsden later became the first mayor of Barrow, which was given municipal borough status in 1867, and county borough status in 1889. The imposing red sandstone town hall, designed by W.H. Lynn, was built in a neo-gothic style in 1887. Prior to this, the borough council had met at the railway headquarters: the railway company&#x27;s control of industry extended to the administration of the town itself.
The Barrow Shipbuilding Company was taken over by the Sheffield steel firm of Vickers in 1897, by which time the shipyard had surpassed the railway and steelworks as the largest employer and landowner in Barrow. The company constructed Vickerstown, modelled on George Cadbury&#x27;s Bournville, on the adjacent Walney Island in the early 20th century to house its employees. It also commissioned Sir Edwin Lutyens to design Abbey House as a guest house and residence for its managing director, Commander Craven.

===20th century===
By the 1890s the shipyard was heavily engaged in the construction of warships for the Royal Navy and also for export. The Royal Navy&#x27;s first submarine, &quot;Holland 1&quot;, was built in 1901, and by 1914 the UK had the most advanced submarine fleet in the world, with 94% of it constructed by Vickers. Vickers was also famous for the construction of airships and airship hangars during the early 20th century. Originally constructed in a large shed at Cavendish Dock, production later relocated to Barrow/Walney Island Airport. HMA No. 1, nicknamed the Mayfly is the most notable airship to have been built in Barrow. The first of its kind in the UK it came to an untimely end on 24 September 1911 when it was wrecked by wind during trials. Well-known ships built in Barrow include , the Japanese flagship during the 1905 Russo-Japanese War, the liner and the aircraft carriers and . It should also be noted that there was a significant presence of Vickers&#x27; armament division in Barrow with the huge Heavy Engineering Workshop on Michaelson Road supplying ammunition for the British Army and Royal Navy throughout both world wars. World War 1 brought significant temporary migration as workers arrived to work in the munitions factory and shipyard, with the town&#x27;s population reaching to an estimated peak of around 82,000 during the War. Thousands of local men fought abroad during World War I, 616 were ultimately killed in action.

During World War II, Barrow was a target for the German air force looking to disable the town&#x27;s shipbuilding capabilities (see Barrow Blitz). The town suffered the most in a short period between April and May 1941. During the war, a local housewife, Nella Last, was selected to write a diary of her experiences on the home front for the Mass-Observation project. Her memoirs were later adapted for television as &quot;Housewife, 49&quot; starring Victoria Wood. The difficulty in targeting bombs meant that the shipyards and steelworks were often missed, at the expense of the residential areas. Ultimately, 83 people were killed and 11,000 houses in the area were left damaged. To escape the heaviest bombardments, many people in the central areas left the town to sleep in hedgerows, with some being permanently evacuated. Barrow&#x27;s industry continued to supply the war effort, with Winston Churchill visiting the town on one occasion to launch the aircraft carrier . Besides the dozens of civilians killed during World War II, some 268 Barrovian men were also killed whilst in combat.

Barrow&#x27;s population reached a second peak in of 77,900 in 1951; however, by this point the long decline of mining and steel-making as a result of overseas competition and dwindling resources had already begun. The Barrow ironworks closed in 1963, three years after the last Furness mine shut. The by then small steelworks followed suit in 1983, leaving Barrow&#x27;s shipyard as the town&#x27;s principal industry. From the 1960s onwards it concentrated its efforts in submarine manufacture, and the UK&#x27;s first nuclear-powered submarine, , was constructed in 1960. , the , and s all followed. The last of these are armed with Trident II missiles as part of the British government&#x27;s Trident nuclear programme.

The end of the Cold War in 1991 marked a reduction in the demand for military ships and submarines, and the town continued its decline. The shipyard&#x27;s dependency on military contracts at the expense of civilian and commercial engineering and shipbuilding meant it was particularly hard hit as government defence spending was reduced dramatically. As a result, the workforce shrank from 14,500 in 1990 to 5,800 in February 1995, with overall unemployment in the town rising over that period from 4.6% to 10%. The rejection by the VSEL management of detailed plans for Barrow&#x27;s industrial renewal in the mid-to-late 1980s remains controversial. This has led to renewed academic attention in recent years to the possibilities of converting military-industrial production in declining shipbuilding areas to the offshore renewable energy sector.

===21st century===

In a 2002 outbreak of legionellosis in the town, 172 people were reported to have caught the disease, of whom seven died. This made it the fourth worst outbreak in the world in terms of number of cases and sixth worst in terms of deaths. The source of the bacteria was later found to be steam from a badly maintained air conditioning unit in the council-run arts centre Forum 28.

At the conclusion of the inquest into the seven deaths, the coroner for Furness and South Cumbria criticised the council for its health and safety failings. In 2006, council employee Gillian Beckingham and employer Barrow Borough Council were cleared of seven charges of manslaughter. Beckingham, the council senior architect was fined £15,000 and the authority £125,000. Following the trials the contractor responsible for maintaining the plant settled a £1.5 million claim by the council for damages. The borough council was the first public body in the country to face corporate manslaughter charges.

2006 saw the construction of Barrow Offshore Wind Farm, which has acted as a catalyst for further investment in offshore renewable energy. Ormonde Wind Farm and Walney Wind Farm followed in 2011, the latter of which became the largest offshore wind farm in the world. The three wind farms are located west of Walney Island and are operated primarily by Ørsted (company), contain a total of 162 turbines and have a combined nameplate capacity of 607 MW, providing energy for well over half a million homes. West of Duddon Sands Wind Farm was commissioned in 2014 while Walney was extended in 2018 to again become the world&#x27;s largest such offshore facility.

During the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Barrow had the highest rate of infection of any local authority in the United Kingdom. This was attributed to various socio-economic factors and a high level of testing also seen in the neighbouring authorities of South Lakeland and Lancaster. Rates fluctuated throughout the year and towards the end of 2020 infection rates were amongst the lowest in country.

From the mid 2010&#x27;s to present, significant investment has taken place at BAE Systems&#x27; shipyard in Barrow with an expansion to accommodate the new programme. Further to this, commitments associated with the AUKUS submarine programme will safeguard the shipyard&#x27;s long-term future. Significant investment in renewable energy is also taking place with emerging proposals to repurpose Rampside Gas Terminals to facilitate the storage of carbon in the depleted Morecambe gas fields.

In 2023 media reported that Barrow was &quot;torn apart&quot; by false grooming gang allegations, with public demonstrations targeting the local newspaper, the Asian community and police.
The scandal was the subject of the 2024 BBC documentary &quot;Liar: The Fake Grooming Scandal&quot; and the perpetrator Eleanor Williams was duly convicted and sentenced to eight and a half years in prison. 

==Governance==
Barrow is the largest town in the district of Westmorland and Furness. Previously the town was in the borough of Barrow-in-Furness, which had directly inherited the municipal and county borough charters given to the town in the late 19th century. Historically it is part of the hundred of Lonsdale &#x27;north of the sands&#x27; in the historic county boundaries of Lancashire.
===1974 reorganisation===
From the 1974 local government reforms until 2023, the town was within the administrative county of Cumbria. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished and became an unparished area. It still forms a part of the Duchy of Lancaster. The Barrow-in-Furness Borough Council formed the &#x27;lower&#x27; tier of local government under Cumbria County Council. Since the 2011 local election, the Labour Party has had overall control of the borough council, while the Borough elected six Labour and five Conservative Party councillors at the 2017 Cumbria County election. Until 2023 the town, along with Walney Island, was unparished and formed the bulk of the wards which made the entire borough&#x27;s area. The mayor and deputy mayor of Barrow were elected annually, and held the roles of chairman and vice-chairman of Barrow-in-Furness Borough Council. The borough and former county borough of Barrow-in-Furness were served by 107 mayors, beginning with Sir James Ramsden in 1867 and continuing through to incumbent 2022 mayor Helen Wall.
===2023 reorganisation===
On 1 April 2023, both Barrow Borough Council and Cumbria County Council ceased to exist when the districts of Barrow, Eden and South Lakeland merged to form Westmorland and Furness. A civil parish was formed named just &quot;Barrow&quot; from the unparished area.

At the same time, ward boundaries within Barrow were redrawn, combining previously independent wards. These include: &#x27;Old Barrow&#x27; (comprising the existing Barrow Island, Central and Hindpool wards), Hawcoat and Newbarns, Ormsgill and Parkside, Risedale and Roosecote and Walney Island.
===Members of Parliament===
The Barrow-in-Furness UK Parliament constituency first came into existence during the 1885 United Kingdom general election, with David Duncan of the Liberal Party becoming the first Member of Parliament (MP) for the town. The seat was won by the Conservative Party in 1892, before being won for the first time by Labour in 1906. In the subsequent 40 years the seat swung between Conservative and Labour, but since 1945 it has been generally considered a Labour safe seat. In 1983, the constituency was expanded to include several commuter towns such as Dalton-in-Furness and Ulverston and was renamed Barrow and Furness. It was subsequently won by the Conservatives, with the victory attributed to Labour&#x27;s stance against the nuclear-powered submarines that were being constructed in Barrow. Following a change in Labour policy the party won Barrow and Furness in 1992. John Woodcock was the MP for the constituency between the 2010 and 2019 general election, when Conservative Simon Fell succeeded as MP for the Borough. In the 2024 General Election, Labour candidate Michelle Scrogham became MP for Barrow and Furness, with 18,537 votes. 

==Geography==
Barrow is situated at the tip of the Furness peninsula on the north-western edge of Morecambe Bay, south of the Duddon Estuary and east of the Irish Sea. Walney Island, surrounds the peninsula&#x27;s Irish Sea coast and is separated from Barrow by the narrow Walney Channel. Both Morecambe Bay and the Duddon Estuary are characterized by large areas of quicksand and fast-moving tidal bores. Areas of sand dunes exist on coasts surrounding Barrow, particularly at Roanhead and North Walney. The town centre and major industrial areas sit on a fairly flat coastal shelf, with hillier ground rising to the east of the town, peaking at at Yarlside. Barrow sits on soils deposited during the end of the Ice Age, eroded from the mountains of the Lake District National Park, to the north-east. Barrow&#x27;s soils are composed of glacial lake clay and glacial till, while Walney is almost entirely made up of reworked glacial morraine. Beneath these soils is a sandstone bedrock, from which many of the town&#x27;s older buildings are constructed.

Barrow town centre is located to the north-east of the docks, with suburbs also extending to the north and east, as well as onto Walney. Barrow is the only major urban area in South Cumbria, with the nearest settlements of a similar size being Lancaster and Morecambe. Other towns nearby include Dalton-in-Furness, Askam-in-Furness, Ulverston, Millom, Grange-over-Sands, Kendal and Windermere.

===Islands===

Most of the town is sheltered from the Irish Sea by Walney Island, a 14 mile (22.5 km) long island connected to the mainland by the bascule type Jubilee bridge. About 13,000 live on the isle&#x27;s various settlements, mostly in Vickerstown, which was built to house workers in the rapidly expanding shipyard. Another significant island which lay in the Walney Channel was Barrow Island, but following the filling of the channel to create land for the shipyard it is now directly connected to the town. Other islands which lie close to Barrow are Piel Island, whose castle protected the harbour from marauding Scots, Sheep Island, Roa Island and Foulney Island.

===Parks and open spaces===

There are numerous natural and managed public parks and open spaces within Barrow. Walney North and South Nature Reserves are protected as Sites of Special Scientific Interest, as is Sandscale Haws. Formal woodland areas within the town include Hawcoat/Ormsgill Quarry, How Tun Woods, Abbotswood, Barrow Steel Works &amp; Slag Bank and Sowerby Wood. The 45-Acre Barrow Park is the largest and most centrally located man-made park in the town with smaller parks including Channelside Haven, Hindpool Urban Park and Vickerstown Park. There are also 25 council-owned playgrounds and 15 allotments.

===Climate===
==Demography==

===Population===
The Barrow council district, which included adjacent urban areas, had a population of 67,407 according to the 2021 census. This is -0.25% less than the 2011 figure and one of only five district which saw a decline in population, although the rate of decline is much lower than the 4% reduction seen between 2001 and 2011. The Office for National Statistics states Barrow&#x27;s population as being in long term decline with a projected population of around 65,000 by 2037. This is largely a result of negative net migration although is based on historic trends thus does not take account of investment at BAE Systems and associated substantial job creation. The population within the town of Barrow itself was 55,489 as at 2021.

===Ethnicity and language===
The 2021 census states 95.7% of the former Borough of Barrow&#x27;s population (I.e. Barrow, Dalton and villages) as White British, and ethnic minority populations in Barrow stood at 4.2%. Other ethnic groups in Barrow include Other White 1.4%, Asian 1.4%, Mixed Race 0.8%, Black 0.5%, Arab 0.1% and all other ethnic groups represented 0.2% of the population. The first people to settle in what is now Barrow were the Celts and Scandinavians followed by the Cornish. Most Barrovians however are descended from migrants from Scotland, Ireland and other parts of England who arrived from the late 19th century onwards. 

Barrow&#x27;s Chinese connections were the subject of a documentary on Chinese state television in 2014. The programme covered diplomat Li Hongzhang&#x27;s fact finding mission to the town&#x27;s steelworks and shipyard in 1896 as well as the 2012 discovery of a hoard of Chinese coins discovered in Barrow dated around a similar time that have been suggested as having been brought over by sailors or labourers. The Society for Anglo-Chinese Understanding is a charity with a branch based in Barrow that aims to develop relations with the British Chinese community and the general British population. It was established in 1975 and publishes the quarterly &quot;China Eye&quot; magazine.

In 2021 93.0% of the borough&#x27;s population was born in England, 2.3% in Scotland, 0.5% in Wales and 0.4% in Northern Ireland. 3.8% of the town&#x27;s 2021 population were born elsewhere in the world. The five most common foreign countries of birth were the Philippines, India, Nigeria, Germany and Poland.

According to the 2021 census, 98.4% of Barrovians spoke English as a main language, with Tagalog, the various Chinese dialects and Polish prevailing as the second, third and fourth most common main languages (0.3%, 0.2% and 0.2% of the population respectively). The Tagalog-speaking population represents the second highest of any district in northern England by percentage of the population.

===Religion===
In the 2021 census 53.1% of the Borough of Barrow&#x27;s population stated themselves as being Christian. People stating no religion or chose not to state totalled 45.5% combined. Other religious groups represented 1.4% of the population, with Islam and Buddhism prevailing as the first and second most common groups. Conishead Priory, the first Kadampa Buddhist centre in the west, is home to around 100 Buddhists and is located off the Barrow to Ulverston Coast Road. Historically Barrow was home to a notable Ashkenazi Jewish community that peaked in size during the 1930s with a synagogue in the town. Nonetheless, it closed in 1974 and less than 20 Jews were recorded by the 2021 census.

==Economy==

Historically Barrow&#x27;s economy was dominated by the manufacturing sector, with the Barrow Hematite Steel Company and Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering being amongst the most important global companies in their respective fields during the 20th century. In the present day, manufacturing remains the largest employment sector in the town. BAE Systems is the single largest employer with around 12,000 employees as at 2024, anticipated to increase by a further 5,000. However, like most of the UK, employment trends have greatly diversified since the 20th century and there are no other predominant employment sectors in Barrow.

===Shipyard and port===
Barrow has played a vital role in global ship and submarine construction for around 150 years. Ottoman submarine &quot;Abdül Hamid&quot; was built in the town in 1886 and became the first submarine in the world to fire a live torpedo underwater, while oil tanker &quot;British Admiral&quot; became the first British vessel to exceed 100,000 tonnes when launched in 1965. The vast majority of all current and former Royal Navy submarines were constructed in Barrow as well as numerous Royal Navy Fleet Flagships.
The BAE Systems Maritime – Submarines shipyard at Barrow is the largest in the UK by workforce ahead of BAE Systems Maritime – Naval Ships in Govan. It was expanded in 1986 by construction of a new covered assembly facility, the Devonshire Dock Hall (DDH), completed by Alfred McAlpine, on land that was created by infilling part of the Devonshire Dock with 2.4 million tonnes of sand pumped from nearby Roosecote Sands. The main hall has a height of , length of , width of and an area of . An extension to the hall in the late 2010s has taken the total area to over , retaining its place as one of the largest shipbuilding construction complex of its kind in Europe. 

The DDH provides a controlled environment for ship and submarine assembly, and avoids the difficulties caused by building on the slope of traditional slipways. Outside the hall, a 24,300 tonne capacity shiplift allows completed vessels to be lowered into the water independently of the tide. Vessels can also be lifted out of the water and transferred to the hall. The first use of the DDH was for construction of the s, and later vessels of the were also built there. The shipyard is currently constructing the s, the first of which was launched on 8 June 2007. BAE Systems is currently studying the design of a new class of ballistic missile submarines. BAE Systems also has orders for submarine pressure domes for the Spanish Navy.

The shipyard has been awarded contracts for the construction of submarines which will carry nuclear missiles in a successor programme to the current &quot;Vanguard&quot; class containing the Trident system. BAE Systems is investing £300 million in Barrow&#x27;s shipyard to construct buildings capable of manufacturing and assembling the new class of submarines. This major development is the largest in 25 years at the shipyard and will see thousands of new jobs created, further cementing its place as the UK&#x27;s largest shipyard and one of the few to have seen continuous contracts since founding over a century ago.

In 2023 the governments of the United Kingdom, United States and Australia committed to construction of a new class of nuclear submarine as part of the AUKUS military alliance. The new SSN-AUKUS class of submarines will be designed and predominantly constructed in Barrow securing the shipyard&#x27;s long term future even beyond Dreadnought. Submarines to be constructed in Australia will also be based on design principles established in Barrow.
The most recent surface vessels to be constructed in Barrow were and amphibious assault ships and in the early 2000s when the shipyard was part of BAE Systems Marine division. It also undertook fitting out and commissioning of helicopter carrier in the mid-1990s after the ship was built by Kvaerner Govan in Glasgow.

Associated British Ports Holdings owns and operates the Port of Barrow which can berth vessels up to long and with a draught of . The four main docks include Buccleuch Dock, Cavendish Dock, Devonshire Dock and Ramsden Dock, with the latter handling almost all of the port&#x27;s cargo. Buccleuch and Devonshire Docks are utilised primarily by BAE Systems, while Cavendish Dock the largest by surface area is now a reservoir. Principal traffic includes the export of condensate by-product from the production of gas at the Rampside Gas Terminal, wood pulp and locally quarried limestone which is exported to Scandinavia for use in the paper industry. The port, which has deep water access, also handles the shipment of nuclear fuels and radioactive waste for BNFL&#x27;s nearby Sellafield plant.

James Fisher &amp; Sons, a service provider in all sectors of the marine industry and a specialist supplier of engineering services to the nuclear industry in the UK and abroad, was founded in Barrow in 1847. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is the largest company to have its headquarters in Cumbria. Annual revenue stood at £307 million in 2012 (up 15% from £268 million in 2011), as well as staff numbers standing at over 1,500 worldwide, with 120 of those in the Barrow headquarters. Numerous vessels are registered at the Port of Barrow, with the majority being owned by James Fisher &amp; Sons and International Nuclear Services/Pacific Nuclear Transport Limited.

===Energy generation===

In 1899 Barrow Corporation built and operated the coal-fired Barrow-in-Furness power station in Buccleugh Street adjacent to the railway line. This eventually had a generating capacity of 23 MW; it was decommissioned in 1960.

Roosecote power station was a 120 MW coal-fired generating station commissioned in 1953, it was later converted to gas firing and closed in 1986. A 120 MW combined cycle gas turbine station was commissioned in 1991, it was closed in 2012. From 2018 the site has been the location of 49 MW battery storage facility.

In 1985, gas was discovered in Morecambe Bay, and to this day the products have been processed onshore at Rampside Gas Terminal in south Barrow. The complex is operated jointly Spirit Energy. Directly adjacent to Rampside Gas Terminal is Roosecote Power Station which was the first CCGT power station to supply electricity to the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Grid. Although originally coal-fired, the station became gas-fired until it was mothballed in 2015.

In 2023 with gas reserves in Morecambe Bay depleting, Spirit Energy revealed plans to utilise the former gas fields as a carbon storage cluster capable of storing a gigaton of carbon dioxide. It is anticipated that carbon emitted from industrial uses across the north will be transported via both pipelines and ships. 

Barrow and its wider urban area form part of &#x27;Britain&#x27;s Energy Coast&#x27;, and has one of the highest concentrations of wind farms in the world, the vast majority are located offshore and have been built during the early 2010s. All four of these wind farms are located off the coast of Walney Island, including the 189 turbine Walney Wind Farm, 108 turbine West Duddon wind farm, 30 turbine Barrow Offshore Wind Farm and 30 turbine Ormonde Wind Farm. Walney Wind Farm was the largest offshore wind farm in the world upon completion, in 2015 it received government consent to be trebled in size. DONG Energy and Scottish Power maintain a wind farm operations base with 30 full-time staff members at the Port of Barrow.

Sellafield and Heysham nuclear power stations are also located within of Barrow.

===Tourism and leisure===
Although it is at the end of a peninsula, Barrow is only around 20 minutes from the Lake District, Barrow has been referred to as a &quot;gateway to the lakes&quot; and &quot;where the lakes meets the sea&quot;, a status which could be enhanced by the new marina complex and planned cruise ship terminal.

Barrow itself has several tourist attractions that support just over 1,000 jobs; the town saw a higher growth in tourist expenditure during the 2000s than Cumbria as a whole and had about 2.3 million overnight stays during 2008. Barrow&#x27;s most popular free-entry tourist attraction is the Dock Museum. The museum tells the history of Barrow (including the steelworks industry, the shipyard and the Barrow Blitz), as well as offering gallery space to local artists and schoolchildren. It is built upon and around an old graving dock. Walney Island has two world-renowned nature reserves (the 130 hectare (0.5 sq mi) South Walney Nature Reserve and the 650 hectare (2.5 sq mi) North Walney Nature Reserve). Both nature reserves have Site of Special Scientific Interest designation, as do the Duddon Estuary and Sandscale Haws to the north of the borough. Barrow has a number of beaches which are popular in the summer with sunbathers, kitesurfers and caravanners. They include Earnse Bay, Biggar Bank, Roanhead and Rampside. The first two of these provide views of the Isle of Man and Anglesey on exceptionally clear days. The wider borough has more than 60 km of coastline. The Park Leisure Centre is a fitness suite with a pool, set in the Barrow Park. The historic ruins of Furness Abbey and Piel Castle, which are both managed by English Heritage, are also popular tourist destinations.
The town centre is home to a large indoor market and Portland Walk Shopping Centre, the latter previously hosting a number of major national retailers although many have since vacated. Barrow has many retail and leisure parks for a town of its size, including Cornmill Crossing, Cornerhouse Retail Park, Hollywood Park, Hindpool Retail Park and Walney Road Retail Park. Between them they host a number of supermarkets, electrical, home furnishing, clothing and discount stores, gyms, restaurants and Cumbria&#x27;s largest cinema. Other modern visitor attractions in Barrow include Lazer Zone in Hindpool Road&#x27;s former Custom House and a similar Lazer Quest, escape room and play centre in the former Hitchens building on Buccleuch Street.

===Regeneration and redevelopment===

Urban regeneration has been ongoing in Barrow since the 1990s. Portland Walk Shopping Centre opened in 1998 anchored by Debenhams as part of a major reconstruction of Barrow town centre. Around the same time the Hindpool Retail Parks and Dock Museum were constructed over various former industrial sites in Barrow, including the dry dock, the Barrow Jute Works and the Barrow Steel Works. Recent construction projects in the town also include the £43 million expansion of Furness College&#x27;s Channelside campus, £22.5 million Furness Academy new build, £14.5 million central Barrow flood relief scheme, £8.5 million Barrow police station, £5 million town centre redevelopment scheme, £4 million Scottish Power wind farm operations centre as well as the North Central Renewal Area, shake up of the town&#x27;s residential and retirement homes and a number of large-scale hotel schemes catering for the influx of contractors working for BAE Systems (namely Holiday Inn Express, Premier Inn and Wetherspoon).

The Waterfront is an ambitious ongoing £200 million dockland regeneration project, which began in 2007. The project includes a new Barrow Marina Village which will incorporate an £8 million 400-berth marina, 650 homes, restaurants, shops, hotels and a new state of the art bridge across Cavendish Dock. A large watersports centre is also proposed, with the possibility of a cruise ship terminal. Some cruise ships are already scheduled to dock in Barrow, mainly for tourists to visit the Lake District, although there is no official cruise ship terminal yet. Developments have stalled since 2010 when the Northwest Regional Development Agency was disbanded and essential government funding was lost. Despite this Barrow Borough Council has since purchased land needed to make the development a reality and currently controls 95% of the site. The executive director of the council has stated construction of the Waterfront could resume by 2017 as economic prospects improve and has pledged funds to conduct a market testing exercise. The allocation of Growth Deal investment (2014–2021) will make improvements to the Barrow Waterfront Enterprise Zone far more secure, whilst the project also received Levelling Up funding in 2022. In 2014 a £300 million investment into the shipyard was announced by BAE Systems, in anticipation of the new generation of UK nuclear submarines. Construction will take up to eight years and create thousands of new jobs at the shipyard thereafter. Amongst proposals are an extension to the DDH complex and new buildings in the central yard area off Bridge Road on Barrow Island (a site formerly mooted for a huge construction hall for the construction of &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class aircraft carrier sections which the yard failed to win contracts for), these will house pressure hull units ready for shot blasting and painting, and be a place for joining submarine equipment modules. Redevelopment of the 5.8 hectare central yard area was completed in 2018 and is dominated by the Central Yard Complex Facility which measures long, wide and tall, only 10% smaller than the volume of the pre-expansion Devonshire Dock Hall.

Other large-scale developments associated with BAE include a logistics centre which was constructed in the Waterfront Business Park in 2015 and a central training facility which is proposed at Buccleuch Dock Road.

===Other===
Other major employers include the National Health Service, through Furness General Hospital, which employs 1,800 staff, the Kimberly Clark paper mill, which has 400 employees, BAE Systems&#x27; Land and Armaments division, Furness Building Society which is one of the 20 largest of its kind and Westmorland and Furness Council. Amongst many retailers that have established themselves in Barrow, the furniture store Stollers is noted as being one of the largest shops of its kind in the UK.

===Employment===
According to the 2011 census, 78.2% of males aged 16–64 and females aged 16–59 in Barrow were economically active. This figure is higher than the North West and England averages. 73.8% of the population was employed, which again is higher than regional and national averages; the unemployment rate stood at 5.6% which is lower than both averages. Despite this the percentage of people claiming key benefits, which is independent of the unemployment figure, is much higher than both averages at 21.0%, or almost a quarter of all Barrovians of working age. The most common form of benefit received was the Incapacity Benefit, claimed by 11.0% of the adult population, while 4.0% claimed Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance, which is on a par with the national average.

The list below shows how many people were employed in certain sectors according to the 2011 census. Little change occurred between the 2001 and 2011 census; Barrow still has a much higher percentage of workers in the manufacturing sector than the national average, ranking third in 2011 behind Corby, Northamptonshire and Pendle, Lancashire. The percentage working in manufacturing has increased further during the 2010s given thousands of new roles created at the shipyard in association with the Trident renewal programme.

South West Cumbria has one of the UK&#x27;s most self-contained workforces, and Barrow itself has the sixth lowest proportion of people who travel outside of the country for work. In 2001, 76% of the working age population in Barrow commuted within for work, when compared to the England average of 54%. A significant proportion of the town&#x27;s population are employed at the Sellafield nuclear facility.

==Transport==

===Road===
Barrow&#x27;s principal road link is the A590. This runs to Barrow from the M6 motorway via Ulverston, skirting the southern Lake District. Just north of Barrow is the southern end of the A595, linking the town to West Cumbria. The A5087 connects Barrow&#x27;s southern suburbs to Ulverston via a scenic coastal route. Abbey Road is the principal road through central Barrow, whilst Walney Bridge connects Barrow Island to Walney Island.

The possibility of a bridge link over Morecambe Bay is occasionally raised, and feasibility studies have been carried out.

===Bus===
Bus services within the town are operated by Stagecoach North West. There is no specifically designated bus station, although many bus routes start and end near the town hall. The original bus station, since demolished, was known for its role in a 1970s television commercial for Chewits sweets. As well as local suburban and village services, longer-distance buses run to Ulverston, Millom, Bowness, Windermere and Kendal.

===Rail===

Barrow-in-Furness railway station provides connections to Whitehaven, Workington and Carlisle to the north, via the Cumbrian Coast Line, and to Ulverston, Grange-over-Sands and Lancaster to the east, via the Furness Line – both of which connect to the West Coast Mainline. Numerous daily trains run to Manchester. The station handles over 600,000 passengers annually. Barrow has a second railway station, Roose, which serves the suburb of the same name.

Furness Abbey, Barrow&#x27;s third main line station, closed in 1950. There was also a station on Barrow Island, for commuters between the shipyard and nearby towns served by the Furness Railway. This railway link was severed in 1966 when the famous cradle bridge across the docks was closed permanently for safety reasons. There were also stations at Piel, Rabbit Hill, Rampside, Ramsden Dock and Strand.

Between 1885 and 1932, the Barrow-in-Furness Tramways Company operated a double-decker tram service over several miles, primarily around central Barrow, Barrow Island and Hindpool.

===Air===
Barrow/Walney Island Airport (IATA airport code: BWF, ICAO: EGNL) is a former commercial airport and Royal Air Force base currently owned by BAE Systems which operates two Beechcraft King Air B200 and one B250 aircraft which fly to various destinations across the UK every weekday, including Bristol, Glasgow, London and Manchester. The airport&#x27;s runways take on a triangular form, the longest runway is almost . The airport was expanded by BAE in 2018 including the construction of a new terminal building, hangar and control tower.

Manchester Airport is the closest major airport, with direct links to Barrow railway station and about two hours away by road.

In 2018 a heliport was built on a site adjacent to Park Road, Ormsgill for energy firm Ørsted and to support the offshore energy sector.

===Sea===
Despite being one of the UK&#x27;s leading shipbuilding centres, the Associated British Ports&#x27; Port of Barrow is only a minor port. Historically, the Isle of Man Steam Packet and the Barrow Steam Navigation Company (a subsidiary of the Furness Railway and later London, Midland and Scottish Railway) operated a number of steamers and passenger ferry services between Rampside and Ramsden Dock and Ardrossan (Scotland), Belfast (Northern Ireland), Blackpool, Douglas (Isle of Man), Fleetwood and Heysham. All services had ceased operation by the mid-20th century.

For a short period during the early 1880s, transatlantic travel was possible from the town. The Anchor Line operated a fortnightly service utilising three of its steamships, &quot;Alexandria&quot;, &quot;Caledonia&quot; and &quot;Columbia&quot;, between Barrow and New York City via Dublin. There are proposals to construct a cruise ship terminal in Barrow as part of the Waterfront redevelopment project.

==Sport==
===Football===
Barrow are in EFL League Two, the fourth tier of English football and are the town&#x27;s only professional sports team. The team, founded in 1901, are nicknamed the Bluebirds and play their home games at the Holker Street stadium. The side were members of the Football League until they failed to be re-elected in 1972. In 1990, they won the FA Trophy beating Leek Town 3–0 in the final at Wembley Stadium, London. Twenty years later, on 8 May 2010, Barrow repeated the feat, beating Stevenage Borough 2–1 after extra time.

After 48 years in non-league football, Barrow were crowned champions of the National League on 17 June 2020, sealing their return to the Football League.

Football players born in Barrow include England internationals Emlyn Hughes and Gary Stevens, as well as Harry Hadley, and Vic Metcalfe.
Of current professional footballers, Georgia Stanway of Bayern Munich, Wayne Curtis, Morecambe striker, Bolton Wanderers midfielder George Thomason and Iran Under-20 and Hibernian winger Shana Haji hail from the town.

Holker Old Boys, based at Rakesmoor Lane, are an amateur football team that play in the North West Counties Football League Division One.

===Rugby===
The town is considered one of rugby league&#x27;s traditional heartlands at semi-professional and amateur levels. Barrow Raiders, the town&#x27;s semi-professional team, whose home games are at Craven Park, currently operate in the second-tier RFL Championship.

In the 1950s the side played in three Challenge Cup finals, winning the last of these against Workington Town. In the 1997 reorganisation of the sport the original Barrow RLFC team merged with Carlisle Border Raiders to form Barrow Border Raiders, with the word &quot;border&quot; later dropped. Players who were born in the town and played at a professional level include brothers Ade and Mat Gardner and Willie Horne. The latter captained Barrow to their Challenge Cup victory and represented Great Britain at an international level. He was inducted into the &quot;Barrow Hall of Fame&quot; along with former Barrow players Phil Jackson and Jimmy Lewthwaite.

At an amateur level, eight rugby league teams participate in the Barrow &amp; District League. They include Askam, Barrow Island, Dalton, Hindpool, Millom, Roose Pioneers, Ulverston and Walney.

===Golf===

Barrow is home to two large golf clubs. Barrow Golf Club, founded in 1922, is in Hawcoat and covers some with 18 holes. Furness Golf Club, founded in 1872, is the sixth oldest golf club in England and is possibly the more famous of the two. It is located on Walney Island, just from the Irish Sea. It also offers an 18-hole course, a shop and other facilities. The Furness Golf Centre is located on the outskirts of Barrow close to Roanhead and is home to a 14-bay driving range, golf shop, swing studio and the Fairway Hotel. The hoaxer Maurice Flitcroft, known as the &quot;world&#x27;s worst golfer&quot; lived and worked in the town.

===Motor sports===

Barrow has staged speedway racing at three venues since the pioneer days in the late 1920s. The first track was at Holker Street. This venue had a revival for a short spell in the early to mid-1970s being utilised by the short-lived Barrow Bombers. In 1930 the sport moved to Little Park but this a somewhat hazy venue. The sport had a revival in 1978 at Park Avenue Industrial Estate but this was relatively short lived.

====Bike racing====

Barrow has produced a number of noteworthy motorcyclists throughout the years, such as Manx Grand Prix winner Eddie Crooks, TT Rider Dan Stewart, Speedway ace Adam Roynon and multiple British Sandtrack Champion John Pepper.

====Karting====

Kart racer Kristian Brierley received national attention after successfully winning the internationally televised TKM Karting Festival in 2015. He followed this up by winning the opening round of the British Championship in 2016 and ultimately went on to finish the season in 6th place.

Multiple other &#x27;Barrovians&#x27; have also competed at national level in karting such as Max Davis, Daniel Pepper, Kieran Pepper, Mark Fell, Oliver Dilks and Jake Calvert.

In 2020 Max Davies became the first person from the Barrow area to be selected to represent Team GB at the ROK World Finals where he finished 29th overall out of 75 competitors from 25 competing countries, he was also the youngest member of Team GB to compete that year.

In 2021 Max Davies was selected for Team GB again as was fellow &#x27;Barrovian&#x27; Daniel Pepper after Pepper had finished that years British championship in 2nd with Davies placing in 3rd.

Pepper&#x27;s 2nd place finish in the 2021 British Championship gave him the highest placed seeding of a Barrow born driver in the 21st century, breaking the record of his own brother Kieran Pepper who had been seeded 3rd the previous year.

Mark Fell remains the only driver from the Barrow area to have won a British Championship which dates back to the early 1990s.

===Other sports===

Barrow is home to the Walney Terriers American Football club, formed in 2011 the club originally trained at Memorial Fields on Walney Island before establishing training grounds elsewhere in Barrow and Ulverston. The Terriers play in the North West conference of the BAFA&#x27;s National League alongside the likes of the Manchester Titans and Merseyside Nighthawks.

One of the town&#x27;s most notable annual sporting events is the Keswick to Barrow (K2B), a walking and running event that has taken place every year since 1967 between Keswick and Barrow. The event has raised millions for charity and regularly sees in excess of 3,000 participants.

Barrow Born Orienteer and Fell Runner Carl Hill was selected to carry the olympic torch for a stage through Morecambe in the buildup to the 2012 summer Olympics. He was nominated for this honor by his father David Hill who was proud of his sons accomplishments in running for England and Great Britain in Orienteering whilst also provided a large portion of his time to getting kids into sport.

==Culture==
Barrow, although one of the country&#x27;s smallest local authorities, contains a wealth of natural and built heritage assets, which includes 274 Listed Buildings and four SSSIs. The 2016 Heritage Index formed by the Royal Society of Arts and the Heritage Lottery Fund placed the borough as sixth highest of 325 English districts for &#x27;assets&#x27; with especially high scores relating to nationally important landscape and natural heritage assets and industrial heritage assets.

===Architecture===


Barrow is one of Britain&#x27;s few planned towns, and the spacious tree-lined avenues within the oldest parts of the town (including Central Barrow, Hindpool and Salthouse) are more akin to the layout of a much larger city. The town centre is distinguished by its Victorian and Edwardian era civic buildings, such as the Town Hall, Main Public Library, former Technical School, former Central Fire Station, Salvation Army Building, Custom House, National Westminster Bank, The Duke of Edinburgh Hotel, St. George&#x27;s Church, St. Mary&#x27;s RC Church and St. James&#x27; Church. Oppositely, several distinctive buildings have been demolished in Barrow since the mid-20th century as a result of neglect or war damage, amongst the most iconic are Abbots Wood, Barrow Central Railway Station, Infield House, North Lonsdale Hospital, Scotch Buildings and the Waverley Hotel. Lancaster architects Sharpe, Paley and Austin were prolific throughout the development of Barrow. A number of Barrow&#x27;s landmark buildings were constructed from locally sourced sandstone, evident from the high number of brown and red coloured stone buildings in the town. Similar materials were used in a number of local buildings in the early 20th century, and often accompanied by terracotta. There are also an increasing number of modern office buildings as well as the shipyard&#x27;s construction halls which dominate much of Barrow&#x27;s skyline. Despite much of Barrow having been constructed from the late 19th to mid 20th centuries, architectural styles vary greatly across the town from the Art Deco John Whinnerah Institute to the Byzantine style St. John&#x27;s Church, Neo-Elizabethan Abbey House and Tudor Revival Vickerstown estate.

Barrow has 8 Grade I listed buildings, 15 Grade II* and 249 Grade II buildings. The majority of Grade I listed buildings and structures are in and around the Furness Abbey complex while many Grade II* listed buildings in the town are 19th century tenements on Barrow Island including the Devonshire Buildings. There are a number of Conservation Areas across Barrow named as such for their architectural or historical significance, they include Barrow Island, Biggar, Central Barrow, Furness Abbey, North Scale, North and South Vickerstown and St. George&#x27;s Square. Historically Barrow&#x27;s skyline was dominated by shipyard cranes and industrial chimneys, although little evidence of this remains in the present day with the last hammerhead crane – the iconic yellow crane of Buccleuch Dock – being dismantled in 2011, despite calls for listing status like the smaller Titan Clydebank in Glasgow. The tallest building in Barrow is Devonshire Dock Hall at . Also worthy of note are the turbines of Ormonde Wind Farm located just off the coast of Barrow which stand at .

In terms of housing, the majority of dwellings in Barrow are Victorian terraces. At 47.0% of local housing stock in 2011, the figure is much higher than England&#x27;s average of 24.5%. 29.7% of dwellings are semi-detached, 12.09% detached and 10.2% flats, maisonettes or apartments. Great variety in housing styles is a feature across central Barrow, Barrow Island, Hindpool, and Vickerstown. Most were built around a grid design in accordance with plans drawn up by James Ramsden.

===Arts===

;Music
Barrow has produced several musical performers of note. They include Thomas Round, a singer and actor in D&#x27;Oyly Carte productions of Savoy Opera as well as Glenn Cornick, the original bass guitarist in the rock band Jethro Tull. Paul MacKenzie, bass player with 1980s Preston-based thrash metal band Xentrix, is from Barrow. Stephen Fitzpatrick (1994/95-2019), lead singer and guitarist of the late indie duo Her&#x27;s, was also from Barrow. More recently, hip-hop DJ and record producer Aim has had considerable commercial success.

;Expressive arts
Several notables in Art and Literature have come from Barrow. Artist Keith Tyson, the 2002 Turner Prize winner, was born in nearby Ulverston, attended the Barrow-in-Furness College of Engineering and worked at the then VSEL shipyard. Constance Spry, the author and florist who revolutionised interior design in the 1930s, and 1940s, moved to the town with her son Anthony during World War I to work as a welfare supervisor. Peter Purves, later a Blue Peter presenter, began his acting career with 2 years as a member of the Renaissance Theatre Company at the town&#x27;s Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre.

During the mid-20th century, Barrow contained a wealth of theatres/cinemas including the Coliseum, Electric Theatre, Essoldo, Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Hippodrome, Pavilion, Ritz, Roxy, Royalty Theatre and Tivoli. All but the Pavilion and Roxy have since been demolished, most recently in 2004 with the demolition of the Apollo (formerly the Ritz). The Canteen Media &amp; Arts Centre – known simply as &quot;The Canteen&quot; – and The Forum are now the main venues for theatre, while the Vue Cinema in Hollywood Park is the only cinema in the town.

;Literature

*Barrow and Vickerstown on Walney Island featured in children&#x27;s book series &quot;The Railway Series&quot;, which developed into the show &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot;, as the point where the fictional Island of Sodor connected to mainland Britain and the national rail network.

*A number of the Lake Poets have referred to locations in present day Barrow: for example, William Wordsworth&#x27;s 1805 autobiographical poem &quot;The Prelude&quot; describes his visits to Furness Abbey.
*The Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa wrote a series of sonnets called &quot;Barrow-on-Furness&quot; (sic). His &quot;heteronym&quot; Álvaro de Campos lived in Barrow when he was studying ship engineering, but Pessoa himself had never visited, and mistakenly assumed that &quot;Furness&quot; was the name of a river.
*According to narrative exposition in Chapter 5 of Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27; 1926 novel &quot;Clouds of Witness&quot;, Inspector Charles Parker, Lord Peter Wimsey&#x27;s friend and eventual brother-in-law, attended Barrow-in-Furness Grammar School.
*Renowned novelist D. H. Lawrence was in Barrow at the outbreak of World War I and wrote about his experiences in the town.
*The 2015 novel &quot;Career of Evil&quot; by Robert Galbraith (a pseudonym of J. K. Rowling) was partially set in Barrow.

Wartime diarist and local housewife Nella Last&#x27;s memoirs were adapted for television, with parts of the town used in filming. The resulting programme, &quot;Housewife, 49&quot;, written by and starring comedian Victoria Wood, was broadcast by ITV in 2006. It won two BAFTA awards – one for Best Single Drama, the other for Best Actress (Wood).
CITV children&#x27;s show &quot;The Treacle People&quot; had two villains named Barrow and Furness.

===Dialect and accent===

Furness is unique within Cumbria and the local dialect and accent is fairly Lancashire-orientated. Until 1974 Furness was an exclave of Lancashire, however as with Liverpool, for example, the &quot;Barrovian&quot; dialect has been influenced by large numbers of settlers from various regions. During the town&#x27;s rapid growth from 1860 onward, thousands came to Barrow from Scotland, Ireland, Wales and elsewhere in northern England. As Glaswegian and Geordie dialects mingled in Barrow numerous more migrated from Lancashire and other parts of England which in effect created the noticeably Northern &quot;Barrovian&quot; dialect. In general the &quot;Barrovian&quot; accent tends to drop certain letters (including &quot;H&quot; and &quot;T&quot;).

===Nightlife===

There are many pubs and working men&#x27;s clubs in Barrow. Barrow has fourteen of the latter, one of the highest number per capita of any British town. Bars and clubs are found primarily in Barrow town centre along Cavendish Street and Dalton Road. Cornwallis Street and Duke Street were, during much of the late 20th/early 21st centuries, the centre of the town&#x27;s nightlife, however the closure of around a dozen venues has left a cluster of vacant buildings and only one remaining bar. Between 2004 and 2010 Barrow was home to one of North West England&#x27;s largest nightclubs, the -capacity Blue Lagoon occupied the entire hull of the former Danish ferry Princess Selandia, which has now left the town. Barrow&#x27;s largest nightclub is now Manhattans, which opened on Cavendish Street in late 2011.

===Food===
A traditional favourite food in Barrow is the pie, and particularly the meat and potato pie. Pie shops are common, and Green&#x27;s of Jarrow Street is noted as a favourite of Barrow-born celebrity chef Dave Myers and journalist Martin Tarbuck, who declared them to be Britain&#x27;s best pies in a book dedicated to the subject.

Barrow was also the home of soft-drink company Marsh&#x27;s, which produced a distinctive sarsaparilla-flavoured fizzy drink known as &quot;Sass&quot;. Marsh&#x27;s was purchased by Purity Soft Drinks of Birmingham in 1993, and the company stopped producing Sass in 1999. Remaining bottles have subsequently sold for high prices as a collector&#x27;s item. A new product, labelled &quot;Barrow Sass&quot;, was launched in 2014 in a bid to replicate traditional Sass. The coasts around Barrow have rich cockle beds from which cockles have traditionally been gathered, although numbers have been low following intensive gathering during the early 2000s, in the run-up to the 2004 Morecambe Bay cockling disaster. One of England&#x27;s few remaining oyster farms is in the Biggar area of Walney. Traditional Cumberland sausages are less associated with Barrow itself than the rest of Cumbria, but are readily available from the surrounding rural area. Cumbria has produced a number of famed dishes and is home to countless Michelin Guide restaurants, one of which is in Dalton.

==Social issues==

=== Lifestyle ===

Having emerged as mixture of working-class cultures from across Britain and Ireland in the 19th century, subsequent low levels of migration and a continued tradition of industrial employment mean that Barrow&#x27;s culture still reflects many of the traditions of the British working class. In September 2008, Barrow was named as the most working-class location in the United Kingdom, based on a series of measures devised to judge the lifestyle of the people. The research was carried out by Locallife.co.uk which determined that there is a fish and chip shop, working men&#x27;s club, bookmakers or trade union office for every 2,917 people (Crewe, Doncaster, Wolverhampton and Preston completed the top five of &#x27;the most working class places in Britain&#x27;). This is in direct contrast to the 1870s, when a developing Barrow had more aristocrats per head of the population than anywhere else in the country.

In the 2019 Indices of Deprivation, Barrow was ranked as the 44th most deprived district in England (out of a total of 326). The equivalent figures for 2007, 2010 stood at 29th, 32nd and 44th most deprived respectively. The Indices of Deprivation is based on income, employment, education, health, crime and barriers to housing and services and living environment. Within these subcategories, most notably Barrow ranked as the 4th most deprived in terms of health deprivation and disability, and in huge contrast, 316th most deprived in terms of access to housing and services (i.e. 10th least deprived). In the 2019 Indices of Deprivation, seven Lower Super Output Areas across Barrow Island, Central and Hindpool were amongst the 1% most deprived areas in the country, while large parts of suburban Barrow including Newbarns and Roose were amongst the 25% of least deprived areas in England.

=== Health ===

The principal hospital in Barrow is Furness General Hospital, operated by the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust and located on the outskirts of the town. As of December 2023 there were 10 NHS GP practices/doctors&#x27; surgeries in Barrow. The life expectancy for males in Barrow is 76.6 years (compared to the England average of 78.7) and 80.6 years for females (compared to the national average of 82.8). A 2021 NHS in depth publication on health in Barrow (the former district) indicated that the population of Barrow is by most measures in a worse state than the national average. Indicators such as rate of cardiovascular disease, self-harm and suicide, alcoholism and excessive weight are worse than the England average. However, a number of indicators are similar to the average or are significantly better, including the percentage of children in absolute low income families.

=== Crime ===

Policing is by Cumbria Constabulary, which alongside the county of Cumbria was formed in 1974. The Ministry of Defence Police maintain a presence on Barrow Island around the shipyard also. Previously the town was policed by Barrow-in-Furness Borough Police. Barrow previously had one full-time police station in Market Street in the Central ward. A new multi-million pound building was built on James Freel Close on Channelside in Hindpool and is the town&#x27;s only police station, with extra jail cells and improved facilities. Several consecutive annual publications by Cumbria Constabulary entitled the &#x27;Cumbria Community Safety Strategic Assessment&#x27; have stated that overall crime in Barrow is declining, with some indicators far better than the national average.

Since November 2019 Ministry of Defence Police have been based at the BAE Systems Shipyard.

==Education==

Education in the state-funded sector includes fifteen primary schools, five infant schools, five junior schools and many nurseries. The three secondary schools in the town are: Furness Academy, St. Bernard&#x27;s Catholic High School and Walney School. Chetwynde School is an all-through school for children aged 4 to 18. Formerly a private school, Chetwynde became a state-funded free school in 2014.

In the further education sector there is one college, Furness College. Furness College merged with Barrow Sixth Form College in 2016 forming the largest college in Cumbria. Technical and professional qualifications are delivered at the Channelside campus, with A levels delivered at the Rating Lane campus, the home of the former sixth form college. Although there are currently no higher education institutions based in Barrow, Furness College offers several higher apprenticeships, foundation degrees, Bachelor&#x27;s and Master&#x27;s programmes accredited by the University of Cumbria, University of Lancaster and the University of Central Lancashire. In March 2023 plans were approved for a 1,400-capacity campus of the University of Cumbria on Barrow Island which is expected to be open for Autumn 2024. The university campus would be situated adjacent to BAE&#x27;s Submarine Academy and form a new &#x27;Learning Quarter&#x27; for the town.

The town&#x27;s main library is the Central Library in Ramsden Square, situated near the town centre. The library was established in 1882 in a room near the town hall, and moved to its current premises in 1922. A branch of the County Archive Service, opened in 1979 and containing many of the town&#x27;s archives, is located within adjoining premises, whilst until 1991 the library also housed the Furness Museum, a forerunner of the Dock Museum. Smaller branch libraries are currently provided at Walney, Roose and Barrow Island. Known librarian Michael Wilson originates in Barrow-in-Furness. Michael Wilson is currently leader of the Collection Logistics Alpha Team at Cambridge University Library.

<doc id="353069" wikidata="Q6150957" url="?curid=353069" title="Gastric dilatation volvulus">
<text>Gastric dilatation volvulus (GDV), also known as gastric dilation, twisted stomach, or gastric torsion, is a medical condition that affects dogs and rarely cats and guinea pigs, in which the stomach becomes overstretched and rotated by excessive gas content. The condition also involves compression of the diaphragm and caudal vena cavae. The word bloat is often used as a general term to mean gas distension without stomach torsion (a normal change after eating), or to refer to GDV.

GDV is a life-threatening condition in dogs that requires prompt treatment. It is common in certain breeds; deep-chested breeds are especially at risk. Mortality rates in dogs range from 10 to 60%, even with treatment. With surgery, the mortality rate is 15 to 33 percent.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms are not necessarily distinguishable from other kinds of distress. A dog might stand uncomfortably and seem to be in extreme discomfort for no apparent reason. Other possible symptoms include firm distension of the abdomen, weakness, depression, difficulty breathing, hypersalivation, and retching without producing any vomitus (nonproductive vomiting). Many dogs with GDV have cardiac arrhythmias (40% in one study). Chronic GDV in dogs, include symptoms such as loss of appetite, vomiting, and weight loss. Hypovolaemia may occur and in severe cases hypovolaemic shock and hypoperfusion.

Blood dyscrasias have been identified in patients with GDV. Haemological conditions that may be identified include: neutrophilic leukocytosis, lymphopaenia, leukopaenia, thrombocytopaenia, and haemoconcentration. Other conditions include: hepatocelluar damage, cholestasis, azotemia and hypokalaemia.
==Causes==
Gastric dilatation volvulus is multifactorial without any one cause being identified, but in all cases the immediate prerequisite is a dysfunction of the sphincter between the esophagus and stomach and an obstruction of outflow through the pylorus.

Hypergastrinaemia has been hypothesised as a cause of GDV. Pyloric hypertrophy as a result of hypergastrinaemia was presumed to cause pyloric outflow obstruction, retarding gastric emptying. Studies have not found evidence to support this theory. One study found no association between pyloric hypertrophy and GDV.

Impairment of gastric myoelectricity retarding gastric emptying has been hypothesised as a cause of GDV. Currently no study has identified an association between gastric myoelectricity and GDV.

===Risk factors===
Dog breeds that have a higher depth to width ratio of the thorax are significantly more likely to acquire GDV than other breeds. If there is a family history of the condition the risk is even more severe, highlighting a heritability to the predisposing factors. Body weight is a factor with obese dogs being less likely to develop GDV than healthy or underweight dogs.

Stress is known to impair gastrointestinal function. Stress has been identified as a risk factor for GDV, the exact manner for this is not currently known.

Other risk factors include: nasal mite infection; gastrointestinal disease; and inflammatory bowel disease, with 61% of dogs with GDV having inflammatory bowel disease identified via biopsy in one study. 

The breeds most likely to develop GDV are the Great Dane (10 times more likely), Weimaraner (4.6) St Bernard (4.2) and the Irish Setter (3.5). Other breeds with a predisposition include the Irish Wolfhound, Borzoi, English Mastiff, Akita, Bull Mastiff, pointing dogs, Bloodhound, Grand Bleu de Gascogne and the standard Poodle. The Great Dane has been found to have a lifetime risk of 42.4% in one study, which has led to the Great Dane being the focus of investigations into causes and risk factors for GDV. One study has found certain alleles of the DLA88, DRB1 and TLR5 genes, which are part of the canine immune system, to predispose a dog to GDV. Further studies have associated these alleles with greater diversity in the gut microbiome and an increased risk of GDV.

GDV has been reported across the age range in dogs. It is more likely to occur in older dogs but is not a geriatric disease and the risk plateaus after the first 2–4 years for large dogs.
===Dietary factors===
One common recommendation in the past has been to raise the food bowl of dogs when they eat, but this was shown to increase the risk in one study. Eating only once daily and eating food consisting of particles less than in size also has been shown increase the risk of GDV. One study looking at the ingredients of dry dog food found that while neither grains, soy, nor animal proteins increased risk of bloat, foods containing an increased amount of added oils or fats do increase the risk, possibly owing to delayed emptying of the stomach.

==Pathophysiology==
The exact pathophysiology is not understood. It is still unknown what order the condition occurs: whether dilatation or volvulus occurs first.

The stomach twists around the longitudinal axis of the digestive tract, also known as volvulus. The most common direction for rotation is clockwise, viewing the animal from behind. The stomach can rotate up to 360° in this direction and 90° counterclockwise. If the volvulus is greater than 180°, the esophagus is closed off, thereby preventing the animal from relieving the condition by belching or vomiting. The results of this distortion of normal anatomy and gas distension include hypotension (low blood pressure), decreased return of blood to the heart, ischemia (loss of blood supply) of the stomach, and shock. Pressure on the portal vein decreases blood flow to liver and decreases the ability of that organ to remove toxins and absorbed bacteria from the blood. Rotations of up to 360° have been reported but typically rotations stop around 270°.

==Diagnosis==

A diagnosis of GDV is made by several factors. The breed and history often gives a significant suspicion of the condition, and a physical examination often reveals the telltale sign of a distended abdomen with abdominal tympany. Shock is diagnosed by the presence of pale mucous membranes with poor capillary refill, increased heart rate, and poor pulse quality. Radiographs (X-rays), usually taken after decompression of the stomach if the dog is unstable, shows a stomach distended with gas. The pylorus, which normally is ventral and to the right of the body of the stomach, is cranial to the body of the stomach and left of the midline, often separated on the X-ray by soft tissue and giving the appearance of a separate gas-filled pocket (double-bubble sign).

==Treatment==
Patients with GDV need to be stabilised as soon as possible. Perfusion and blood pressure need to be normalised before any further treatment can be performed. Analgesia should also be provided.

Patients require intravenous fluid therapy with saline. Colloid fluids may be required if the patient does not respond well to the crystalloid solution. Antiarrhythmic drugs should be administered after starting fluid therapy to stabilise blood pressure. Other drugs such as dobutamine should be provided if blood pressure fails to normalise, only as a last resort. Other vasopressors can be used such as ephedrine, phenylephrine, and epinephrine.

Percutaneous decompression is the easiest method of treating GDV. A large catheter is inserted into the gastric lumen. If done incorrectly the spleen may be lacerated or punctured. Potentially the content of the stomach may leak if the procedure is performed incorrectly.

Orogastric intubation is another method for treatment. An orogastric tube is entered into the stomach via the oesophageal sphincter, tepid water is sent as a bolus through the tube into the stomach to lavage it. Fluid should be regurgitated up the tube. If it is not then a stomach perforation has likely occurred. 

To restore the stomach to the normal position an exploratory laparotomy (explap) is needed. Sometimes a gastrectomy may be required. During the explap the stomach is rotated up to 360° to put it back into the right position, although typically such extreme rotation is not needed. Pulling on the pylorus allows for the stomach to be repositioned. Sometimes the dilatation is serious enough that the stomach requires further decompression before repositioning. Other organs of the digestive system are assessed during the procedure. Splenectomy may be required. Gastropexy involves suturing the pyloric antrum to the abdominal wall to prevent recurrence of GDV. Patients that do not receive a gastropexy have a high likelihood of GDV recurrence with one study finding 80% of dogs that suffered a GDV but did not undergo a gastropexy having GDV reoccur.

==Prevention==
Recurrence of GDV attacks can be a problem, occurring in up to 80% of dogs treated medically only (without surgery). To prevent recurrence, at the same time the bloat is treated surgically, a right-side gastropexy is often performed, which by a variety of methods firmly attaches the stomach wall to the body wall, to prevent it from twisting inside the abdominal cavity in the future. While dogs that have had gastropexies still may develop gas distension of the stomach, a significant reduction in recurrence of gastric volvulus is seen. Of 136 dogs that had surgery for gastric dilatation-volvulus, six that did have gastropexies had a recurrence, while 74 (54.5%) of those without the additional surgery recurred. Gastropexies are also performed prophylactically in dogs considered to be at high risk of GDV, including dogs with previous episodes or with gastrointestinal disease predisposing to GDV, and dogs with a first-order relative (parent or sibling) with a history of it.

Precautions that are likely to help prevent gastric dilatation-volvulus include feeding small meals throughout the day instead of one big meal, and not exercising immediately before or after a meal.

==Prognosis==

Immediate treatment is the most important factor in a favorable prognosis. A delay in treatment greater than 6 hours or the presence of peritonitis, sepsis, hypotension, or disseminated intravascular coagulation are negative prognostic indicators. Patients that lack the ability to walk are 4.4 times more likely to die. Comatose patients are 36 times more likely to die. Dogs that show depression when presented are three times more likely to die.

Historically, GDV has held a guarded prognosis. Although &quot;early studies showed mortality rates between 33 and 68% for dogs with GDV,&quot; studies from 2007 to 2012 &quot;reported mortality rates between 10 and 26.8%&quot;. Mortality rates approach 10 to 40% even with treatment. With prompt treatment and good preoperative stabilization of the patient, mortality is significantly lessened to 10% overall (in a referral setting). Negative prognostic indicators following surgical intervention include postoperative cardiac arrhythmia, splenectomy, or splenectomy with partial gastric resection. A longer time from presentation to surgery was associated with a lower mortality, presumably because these dogs had received more complete preoperative fluid resuscitation, thus were better cardiovascularly stabilized prior to the procedure.

Prognosis is guarded if the cardia is necrotic. Many dogs are euthanised due to risks of performing surgery or inability to afford costly surgery and treatment.

==Epidemiology==
As a general rule, GDV is of greatest risk to deep-chested dogs. The five breeds at greatest risk are Great Danes, Weimaraners, St. Bernards, Gordon Setters, and Irish Setters. In fact, the lifetime risk for a Great Dane to develop GDV has been estimated to be close to 37%. Standard Poodles are also at risk for this health problem, as are Irish Wolfhounds, German Shorthaired Pointers, German Shepherds, and Rhodesian Ridgebacks. Basset Hounds and Dachshunds have the greatest risk for dogs less than .

==Society and culture==
*In the novel and film &quot;Marley &amp; Me&quot;, Marley develops and ultimately dies of &quot;bloat&quot;. 
*In &quot;Dog of Death,&quot; an episode of the animated TV series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the family dog Santa&#x27;s Little Helper develops a &quot;twisted stomach&quot;, necessitating surgery.

<text>The epiglottis (: epiglottises or epiglottides) is a leaf-shaped flap in the throat that prevents food and water from entering the trachea and the lungs. It stays open during breathing, allowing air into the larynx. During swallowing, it closes to prevent aspiration of food into the lungs, forcing the swallowed liquids or food to go along the esophagus toward the stomach instead. It is thus the valve that diverts passage to either the trachea or the esophagus. 

The epiglottis is made of elastic cartilage covered with a mucous membrane, attached to the entrance of the larynx. It projects upwards and backwards behind the tongue and the hyoid bone. 

The epiglottis may be inflamed in a condition called epiglottitis, which is most commonly due to the vaccine-preventable bacterium &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;. Dysfunction may cause the inhalation of food, called aspiration, which may lead to pneumonia or airway obstruction. The epiglottis is also an important landmark for intubation. 

The epiglottis has been identified as early as Aristotle, and gets its name from being above the glottis (&quot;&quot; + &quot;glottis&quot;).

==Structure==

The epiglottis sits at the entrance of the larynx. It is shaped like a leaf of purslane and has a free upper part that rests behind the tongue, and a lower stalk (). The stalk originates from the back surface of the thyroid cartilage, connected by a thyroepiglottic ligament. At the sides, the stalk is connected to the arytenoid cartilages at the walls of the larynx by folds. 

The epiglottis originates at the entrance of the larynx, and is attached to the hyoid bone. From there, it projects upwards and backwards behind the tongue. The space between the epiglottis and the tongue is called the vallecula.

===Microanatomy===
The epiglottis has two surfaces; a forward-facing surface, and a surface facing the larynx. The forward-facing surface is covered with several layers of thin cells (stratified squamous epithelium), and is not covered with keratin, the same surface as the back of the tongue. The back surface is covered in a layer of column-shaped cells with cilia, similar to the rest of the respiratory tract. It also has mucus-secreting goblet cells. There is an intermediate zone between these surfaces that contains cells that transition in shape. The body of the epiglottis consists of elastic cartilage.

===Development===
The epiglottis arises from the fourth pharyngeal arch. It can be seen as a distinct structure later than the other cartilage of the pharynx, visible around the fifth month of development. The position of the epiglottis also changes with ageing. In infants, it touches the soft palate, whereas in adults, its position is lower.

===Variation===

A high-rising epiglottis is a normal anatomical variation, visible during an examination of the mouth. It does not cause any serious problem apart from maybe a mild sensation of a foreign body in the throat. It is seen more often in children than adults and does not need any medical or surgical intervention. The front surface of the epiglottis is occasionally notched.

==Function==
The epiglottis is normally pointed upward during breathing with its underside functioning as part of the pharynx. There are taste buds on the epiglottis.

=== Swallowing ===
During swallowing, the epiglottis bends backwards, folding over the entrance to the trachea, and preventing food from going into it. The folding backwards is a complex movement the causes of which are not completely understood. It is likely that during swallowing the hyoid bone and the larynx move upwards and forwards, which increases passive pressure from the back of the tongue; the aryepiglottic muscles contract; the passive weight of the food pushes down; and the laryngeal and thyroarytenoid muscles contract. The consequence of this is that during swallowing the bent epiglottis blocks off the trachea, preventing food from going into it; food instead travels down the esophagus, which is behind it.

===Speech sounds===
In many languages, the epiglottis is not essential for producing sounds. In some languages, the epiglottis is used to produce epiglottal consonant speech sounds, though this sound-type is rather rare.

==Clinical significance==
===Inflammation===

Inflammation of the epiglottis is known as epiglottitis. Epiglottitis is mainly caused by &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;. A person with epiglottitis may have a fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing. For this reason, acute epiglottitis is considered a medical emergency, because of the risk of obstruction of the pharynx. Epiglottitis is often managed with antibiotics, inhaled aerosolised epinephrine to act as a bronchodilator, and may require tracheal intubation or a tracheostomy if breathing is difficult. 

The incidence of epiglottitis has decreased significantly in countries where vaccination against &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; is administered.

=== Aspiration ===
When food or other objects travel down the respiratory tract rather than down the esophagus to the stomach, this is called . This can lead to the obstruction of airways, inflammation of lung tissue, and aspiration pneumonia; and in the long term, atelectasis and bronchiectasis. One reason aspiration can occur is because of failure of the epiglottis to close completely.

If food or liquid enters the airway due to the epiglottis failing to close properly, throat-clearing or a cough reflex may occur to protect the respiratory system and expel material from the airway. Where there is impairment in laryngeal vestibule sensation, silent aspiration (entry of material to the airway that does not result in a cough reflex) may occur.

===Other===
The epiglottis and vallecula are important anatomical landmarks in intubation. Abnormal positioning of the epiglottis is a rare cause of obstructive sleep apnoea.

== Other animals ==
The epiglottis is present in mammals, including land mammals and cetaceans, also as a cartilaginous structure. Like in humans, it functions to prevent entry of food into the trachea during swallowing. The position of the larynx is flat in mice and other rodents, as well as rabbits. For this reason, because the epiglottis is located behind the soft palate in rabbits, they are obligate nose breathers, as are mice and other rodents. In rodents and mice, there is a unique pouch in front of the epiglottis, and the epiglottis is commonly injured by inhaled substances, particularly at the transition zone between the flattened and cuboidal epithelium. It is also common to see taste buds on the epiglottis in these species.

==History==
The epiglottis was noted by Aristotle, although the epiglottis&#x27; function was first defined by Vesalius in 1543. The word has Greek roots. The epiglottis gets its name from being above () the glottis ().

<doc id="353074" wikidata="Q430660" url="?curid=353074" title="Micropayment">
<text>A micropayment is a financial transaction involving a very small sum of money and usually one that occurs online. A number of micropayment systems were proposed and developed in the mid-to-late 1990s, all of which were ultimately unsuccessful. A second generation of micropayment systems emerged in the 2010s.

While micropayments were originally envisioned to involve very small sums of money, practical systems to allow transactions of less than 1 have seen little success. One problem that has prevented the emergence of micropayment systems is a need to keep costs for individual transactions low, which is impractical when transacting such small sums even if the transaction fee is just a few cents.

==Definition==
There are a number of different definitions of what constitutes a micropayment. PayPal defines a micropayment as a transaction of less than £5 while Visa defines it as a transaction under 20 Australian dollars.

==History==
The term was coined by Ted Nelson, long before the invention of the World Wide Web. Initially, this was conceived as a way to pay the various copyright holders of a compound work. Micropayments, on the Web, were initially devised as a way of allowing the sale of online content and as a way to pay for very low cost network services. They were envisioned to involve small fractions of a cent, as little as US$0.0001 to a few cents. Micropayments would enable people to sell content on the Internet and would be an alternative to advertising revenue.
During the late 1990s, there was a movement to create microtransaction standards, and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) worked on incorporating micropayments into HTML, even going as far as to suggest the embedding of payment-request information in HTTP error codes. The W3C has since stopped its efforts in this area, and micropayments have not become a widely used method of selling content over the Internet.

===Early research and systems===
In the late 1990s, established companies such as IBM and Compaq had microtransaction divisions, and research on micropayments and micropayment standards was performed at Carnegie Mellon and by the World Wide Web Consortium.

====IBM Micro Payments====
IBM&#x27;s Micro Payments was established , and were it to have become operational would have &quot;allowed vendors and merchants to sell content, information, and services over the Internet for amounts as low as one cent&quot;.

====iPIN====
An early attempt at making micropayments work, iPIN was a 1998 venture-capital-funded startup that provided services that allowed purchasers to add incremental micropayment charges to their existing bill for Internet services. Debuting in 1999, its service was never widely adopted.

====Millicent====
Millicent, originally a project of Digital Equipment Corporation, was a micropayment system that was to support transactions from as small as 1/10 of a cent up to $5.00. It grew out of The Millicent Protocol for Inexpensive Electronic Commerce, which was presented at the 1995 World Wide Web Conference in Boston, but the project became associated with Compaq after that company purchased Digital Equipment Corporation. The payment system employed symmetric cryptography.

====NetBill====
The NetBill electronic commerce project at Carnegie Mellon university researched Distributed transaction processing systems and developed protocols and software to support payment for goods and services over the Internet. It featured pre-paid accounts from which micropayment charges could be drawn. NetBill was initially absorbed by CyberCash in 1997 and ultimately taken over by PayPal.

==Online gaming==

The term micropayment or microtransaction is sometimes attributed to the sale of virtual goods in online games, most commonly involving an in-game currency or service bought with real world money and only available within the online game.

==Recent systems==
Current systems either allow many micropayments but charge the user&#x27;s phone bill one lump sum or use funded wallets.

===Dropp===
Dropp is a micropayments platform that allows consumers and merchants to make and accept payments as low as $0.01 for physical or digital goods and services. Dropp accepts both FIAT and cryptocurrencies: the US dollar, AED, HBAR, and USDC. Dropp&#x27;s platform is designed to provide a Pay-Per-Use alternative to flat fee paid subscriptions as a solution to consumer subscription fatigue. Dropp provides an alternative monetization model to digital merchants while maintaining complete privacy for consumer transactions. Dropp&#x27;s fee is 5 cents for a $1 transaction, with an average fee of 1% + 25 cents on all transactions above $5. Dropp is currently supported on mobile and web browsers and has Shopify and WordPress user plugins for accepting micropayments.

===Flattr===

Flattr is a micropayment system (more specifically, a microdonation system) which launched in August 2010. Actual bank transactions and overhead costs are involved only on funds withdrawn from the recipient&#x27;s accounts.

===Jamatto===
Jamatto is a micropayments and microsubscriptions system that allows websites and publishers to accept payments as small as 1¢ by modifying just their HTML source code Jamatto is in use by newspapers across three continents.

===M-Coin===
A service provided by TIMWE, M-Coin allows users to make micropayments on the Internet. The user&#x27;s phone bill is then charged by the mobile network operator.

===PayPal===
PayPal MicroPayments is a micropayment system that charges payments to user&#x27;s PayPal account and allows transactions of less than US$12 to take place. As of 2013, the service is offered in selected currencies only. The PayPal charge for a micropayment from a U.S. account is a flat five cents per transaction plus five percent of the transaction (as compared with PayPal&#x27;s normal 2.9% and 30 cents for larger sums).

===Swish===

Swish is a payment system between bank accounts in Sweden. It is designed for small instant transactions between people, instead of using cash (cash has largely dropped in use in Sweden since 2010), but is also used by small businesses such as sports clubs that don&#x27;t want to deal with the cost of a credit card reader. A cell phone number is used as a unique user identifier, and must have been registered at a Swedish bank. A smartphone app is used to send money, but any cell phone can be used as a receiver. 

The lowest permitted payment is 1 SEK (around 0.09 EUR) and the highest is 10,000 (around 950 EUR), although 150,000 SEK can be transferred if the transaction is preregistered in the internet bank. The fee is generally zero for private people, but when the receiver is an organisation e.g. sports club or company, there is fee of 2 SEK.

Similar apps with zero fee for small instant private transactions, Vipps and MobilePay have become popular in Norway and Denmark.

===Tikkie===

Tikkie is a Dutch payment system in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, run by the ABN AMRO bank. It is available to anyone with a Dutch bank account and a Dutch, Belgian or German phone number. It was originally marketed as a way to share costs between friends, e.g. when sharing a ride or at a restaurant or buying movie tickets, but there is now also a business variant for e.g. paying toll fees or congestion charges, and a restaurant variant whereby the restaurant sends payment requests to the individual people at the table. Tikkie is free for private transactions (even for users of other banks, since Dutch banks typically charge annual banking fees instead of per-transaction fees), but there is a transaction cost for business clients.

A Tikkie payment request consists of a generated hyperlink (which may be encoded as a QR code) that redirects to the iDeal payment system which is used by most banks in the Netherlands. If the payer has a banking app for any Dutch bank on his mobile device, the Tikkie link can open the banking app directly. Alternatively, the payment can be made in a web browser. Payment requests are generated by an Apple or Android mobile app and payment requests are typically sent via messaging systems like WhatsApp or Telegram.

In 2017 there were 1 million users and 150 000 payment requests per week. By 2018, Tikkie reported 2 million users and 440 000 payment requests per week. By 2019, there were about 5 million users, with 200 000 payment requests per day. 50% of Tikkie payment requests are honoured within 1 hour, and 80% are paid within 24 hours. In 2017, the average payment request was EUR 12. By 2018, the average payment request was EUR 27.50. A sender may send no more than EUR 750 and a recipient may receive no more than EUR 2500 per Tikkie.

=== Blendle ===

Blendle is an online news platform that aggregates articles from a variety of newspapers and magazines and sells them on a pay-per-article basis, leading Nieman Lab to describe it as a &quot;micropayments-for-news pioneer&quot;. It operates in the Netherlands, Germany and the US. In 2019, five years after its launch, it announced that it would change its business model away from micropayments to premium subscriptions. Nieman Lab commented that &quot;micropayments keep not panning out&quot;.

==Obsolete systems==
===Zong===
Zong mobile payments was a micropayment system that charged payments to users&#x27; mobile phone bills. The company was acquired by eBay and integrated with PayPal in 2011.

<doc id="353077" wikidata="Q1275806" url="?curid=353077" title="EROS (microkernel)">
<text>Extremely Reliable Operating System (EROS) is an operating system developed starting in 1991 at the University of Pennsylvania, and then Johns Hopkins University, and The EROS Group, LLC. Features include automatic data and process persistence, some preliminary real-time support, and capability-based security. EROS is purely a research operating system, and was never deployed in real world use. , development stopped in favor of a successor system, CapROS.

==Key concepts==
The overriding goal of the EROS system (and its relatives) is to provide strong support at the operating system level for the efficient restructuring of critical applications into small communicating components. Each component can communicate with the others only through protected interfaces, and is isolated from the rest of the system. A &quot;protected interface&quot;, in this context, is one that is enforced by the lowest level part of the operating system, the kernel. That is the only part of the system that can move information from one process to another. It also has complete control of the machine and (if properly constructed) cannot be bypassed. In EROS, the kernel-provided mechanism by which one component names and invokes the services of another is a capability, using inter-process communication (IPC). By enforcing capability-protected interfaces, the kernel ensures that all communications to a process arrive via an intentionally exported interface. It also ensures that &quot;no&quot; invocation is possible unless the invoking component holds a valid capability to the invoked component. Protection in capability systems is achieved by restricting the propagation of capabilities from one component to another, often through a security policy termed &quot;confinement&quot;.

Capability systems naturally promote component-based software structure. This organizational approach is similar to the programming language concept of object-oriented programming, but occurs at larger granularity and does not include the concept of inheritance. When software is restructured in this way, several benefits emerge:

*The individual components are most naturally structured as event loops. Examples of systems that are commonly structured this way include aircraft flight control systems (see also DO-178B Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification), and telephone switching systems (see 5ESS switch). Event-driven programming is chosen for these systems mainly because of simplicity and robustness, which are essential attributes in life-critical and mission-critical systems.
*Components become smaller and individually testable, which helps to more readily isolate and identify flaws and bugs.
*The isolation of each component from the others limits the scope of any damage that may occur when something goes wrong or the software misbehaves.

Collectively, these benefits lead to measurably more robust and secure systems. The Plessey System 250 was a system originally designed for use in telephony switches, which capability-based design was chosen specifically for reasons of robustness.

In contrast to many earlier systems, capabilities are the &quot;only&quot; mechanism for naming and using resources in EROS, making it what is sometimes referred to as a &quot;pure&quot; capability system. In contrast, IBM i is an example of a commercially successful capability system, but it is not a pure capability system.

Pure capability architectures are supported by well-tested and mature mathematical security models. These have been used to formally demonstrate that capability-based systems can be made secure if implemented correctly. The so-called &quot;safety property&quot; has been shown to be decidable for pure capability systems (see Lipton). Confinement, which is the fundamental building block of isolation, has been formally verified to be enforceable by pure capability systems, and is reduced to practical implementation by the EROS &quot;constructor&quot; and the KeyKOS &quot;factory&quot;. No comparable verification exists for any other primitive protection mechanism. There is a fundamental result in the literature showing that &quot;safety&quot; is mathematically undecidable in the general case (see HRU, but note that it is of course provable for an unbounded set of restricted cases). Of greater practical importance, safety has been shown to be &quot;false&quot; for all of the primitive protection mechanisms shipping in current commodity operating systems. Safety is a necessary precondition to successful enforcement of &quot;any&quot; security policy. In practical terms, this result means that it is not possible &quot;in principle&quot; to secure current commodity systems, but it is potentially possible to secure capability-based systems &quot;provided&quot; they are implemented with sufficient care. Neither EROS nor KeyKOS has ever been successfully penetrated, and their isolation mechanisms have never been successfully defeated by any inside attacker, but it is not known whether the two implementations were careful enough. One goal of the Coyotos project was to demonstrate that component isolation and security has been definitively achieved by applying software verification techniques.

The L4.sec system, which is a successor to the L4 microkernel family, is a capability-based system, and has been significantly influenced by the results of the EROS project. The influence is mutual, since the EROS work on high-performance invocation was motivated strongly by Jochen Liedtke&#x27;s successes with the L4 microkernel family.

==History==
The primary developer of EROS was Jonathan S. Shapiro. He was also the driving force behind Coyotos, which was an &quot;evolutionary step&quot; beyond the EROS operating system.

The EROS project started in 1991 as a clean-room reconstruction of an earlier operating system, KeyKOS. KeyKOS was developed by Key Logic, Inc., and was a direct continuation of work on the earlier &quot;Great New Operating System In the Sky&quot; (GNOSIS) system created by Tymshare, Inc. The circumstances surrounding Key Logic&#x27;s demise in 1991 made licensing KeyKOS impractical. Since KeyKOS did not run on popular commodity processors in any case, the decision was made to reconstruct it from the publicly available documentation.

By late 1992, it had become clear that processor architecture had changed significantly since the introduction of the capability idea, and it was no longer obvious that component-structured systems were practical. Microkernel-based systems, which similarly favor large numbers of processes and IPC, were facing severe performance challenges, and it was uncertain if these could be successfully resolved. The x86 architecture was clearly emerging as the dominant architecture but the expensive user/supervisor transition latency on the 386 and 486 presented serious challenges for process-based isolation. The EROS project was turning into a research effort, and moved to the University of Pennsylvania to become the focus of Shapiro&#x27;s dissertation research. By 1999, a high performance implementation for the Pentium processor had been demonstrated that was directly performance competitive with the L4 microkernel family, which is known for its exceptional speed in IPC. The EROS confinement mechanism had been formally verified, in the process creating a general formal model for secure capability systems.

In 2000, Shapiro joined the faculty of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. At Hopkins, the goal was to show how to &quot;use&quot; the facilities provided by the EROS kernel to construct secure and defensible servers at application level. Funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Air Force Research Laboratory, EROS was used as the basis for a trusted window system, a high-performance, defensible network stack, and the beginnings of a secure web browser. It was also used to explore the effectiveness of lightweight static checking. In 2003, some very challenging security issues were discovered that are intrinsic to &quot;any&quot; system architecture based on synchronous IPC primitives (notably including EROS and L4). Work on EROS halted in favor of Coyotos, which resolved these issues.

, EROS and its successors are the only widely available capability systems that run on commodity hardware.

==Status==
Work on EROS and Coyotos by the original group has halted, but there is a successor system. CapROS (Capability Based Reliable Operating System), a successor of EROS, is an open-source, commercially oriented operating system.

<text>A cable television headend is a master facility for receiving television signals for processing and distribution over a cable television system. A headend facility may be staffed or unstaffed and is typically surrounded by some type of security fencing. The building is typically sturdy and purpose-built to provide security, cooling, and easy access for the electronic equipment used to receive and re-transmit video over the local cable infrastructure. One can also find head ends in power-line communication (PLC) substations and Internet communications networks.

==Reception==
Nearly all cable TV systems carry subscription content that is relayed from a satellite in geosynchronous orbit. Encrypted to prevent unauthorized use, this content is uplinked from one or more earth stations operated by various content delivery companies. The content is then analog or digitally modulated and transmitted through the cable network (the OSP or &quot;OutSide Plant&quot;) to subscriber homes by means of coaxial or fiber-optic cables buried underground or strung from utility poles.

Most cable TV systems also carry local over-the-air television stations for distribution. While each terrestrial channel represents a defined frequency, one or more commercial-grade receiving television antennas are used to receive the multiple channels that the cable company wishes to distribute. These antennas are often built into a single tower structure called a master antenna television structure. Commercial TV pre-amplifiers strengthen the weakened terrestrial TV signals for distribution, usually after re-modulation using a cable-specific analog or digital scheme.

Some cable TV systems receive the local television stations&#x27; programming by dedicated coaxial cable, microwave link or fiber-optic line, installed between the local station and the headend. A device called a modulator at the local station&#x27;s facilities feed their programming over this line to the cable TV headend, which in turn receives it with another device called a demodulator. It is then distributed through the cable TV headend to subscribers. This is usually more reliable than receiving the local stations&#x27; broadcasts over the air with an antenna. However, off-air reception is used as a backup by the headend in case of failure. In some cases systems receive local channels by satellite.

Other sources of programming include those delivered via fiber optics, telephone wires, the Internet, microwave towers and local public-access television channels that are sent to the cable headend on an upstream frequency over the cable system itself (known in the industry as &quot;T&quot;-channels), or via a dedicated line set up by the cable company, as mentioned earlier for reception of local television stations&#x27; programming by the headend.

==Signal processing==
Once a television signal is received, it must be processed. For digital satellite TV signals, a dedicated commercial satellite receiver is needed for each channel that is to be distributed by the cable system; these are usually rack-mountable receivers that are designed to take up less space than consumer receivers. They output video and stereo audio signals as well as a digital signal for digital plants.

Analog terrestrial TV signals require a processor which is a RF receiver that outputs video and audio. In some cases the processor will include a built-in modulator.

Digital terrestrial TV signals require a special digital processor.

Digital channels are usually received on an L band QAM stream from a satellite, which uses multiplexing. Using special receivers such as the Motorola MPS, the signal can be demultiplexed or &quot;Demuxed&quot; to extract specific channels from the multiplexed signal. At this point, local insertion may be performed to add content specifically targeted to the local geographic area.

===Analog Modulation===

Cable television signals are then mixed in accordance with the cable system&#x27;s channel numbering scheme using a series of cable modulators (one for each channel), which is in turn fed into a frequency multiplexer or signal combiner. The mixed signals are sent into a broadband amplifier, then sent into the cable system by the trunk line and continuously re-amplified as needed.

Modulators essentially take an input signal and attach it to a specific frequency. For example, in North America, NTSC standards dictate that CH2 is a 6 MHz wide channel with its luminance carrier at 55.25 MHz, so the modulator for channel 2 will impose the appropriate input signal on to the 55.25 MHz frequency to be received by any TV tuned to Channel 2.

===Digital Modulation===

Digital channels are modulated as well; however, instead of each channel being modulated on to a specific frequency, multiple digital channels are modulated on to one specific ATSC frequency. Using QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation), a CATV operator can place usually up to eight subchannels on each channel so channel 2 may actually be carrying channels 1–8 in a viewer&#x27;s city. Set-top boxes (STBs) or CableCards are required to receive these digital signals and are provided by the cable operator themselves.

Many modern cable systems are now &quot;all digital&quot; meaning analog video signals have been discontinued in order to reuse spectrum. The RF channels analog used to occupy are now open for a cable system to reuse most commonly as High Speed Data (commonly referred to in the industry as &quot;HSD&quot;) channels to increase subscriber download/upload internet speeds. (see DOCSIS) Analog video removal also essentially eliminates cable theft since analog signals were transmitted unencrypted. Most digital video signals are compressed to MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 formats in order to combine multiple video streams into a QAM making the most efficient use of spectrum which a customer cable set top box receives, demodulates, de-encrypts and displays as a virtual channel number that the viewer recognizes. In many cases the same TV network may appear multiple times in a local channel lineup as a different channel the viewer sees (I.E. CNN as 34, 334, 1034) this is due to previous generations of channel lineups kept in service and intended to not confuse viewers who are familiar with the network appearing on a number they are used to. Although a channel may be in a line up multiple times the RF QAM it is combined or &quot;muxed&quot; into is modulated and compressed just once. A set top box tunes to that same QAM when any instance of that network is called by the viewer. Virtual channeling also allows the cable operator to change the physical frequency a QAM is on without the viewer noticing the channel number changing in their lineup.

Most digital cable systems encrypt their signals (both data and video) to eliminate unauthorized reception.

==National Video Transporting==
===Super Headend===
Most commonly in large nationwide cable systems a central or &quot;super headend&quot; is in service to feed a local hub via a fiber optic transport circuit. In some cases a single super headend could service a cable company&#x27;s entire service footprint. Super headends allow for a single site of satellite dishes that can be placed in optimal locations for satellite coverage and signal strength, usually in areas of high ground elevation and open terrain. In large cable systems, a provider may operate multiple super headends as a way of redundancy in the event of a failure. Super headends also create a cost-effective environment for cable operators as the amount of equipment and faculties is greatly reduced and the signals can be replicated and transmitted to local hubs that feed a community or city.

===Market Center Headend===

In some large nationwide cable systems, a sort of median point between a large super headend and local hub exists and is known as a market center headend or region headend. Typically a market center headend receives its national video content from the super headend, then forwards that alongside local ad splicing and local channels to local hubs. Market center headends are regularly staffed while hubs are not (outside of normal maintenance and servicing). A main benefit of a market center headend is it can give more attention to local service and details than a nationwide super headend could. For example, a market center headend allows for engineers to pull local video feeds such as public access channels and local channels for viewing and analyzation of video quality defects when such an issue may not be immediately noticed locally. Another benefit is the quick action of channel blackouts in certain areas during times of carriage contract disputes with broadcasters. Market center headends can service hubs in a large city, an entire state or even multiple states.

==Cable Hubs and Nodes==

A cable hub is a building or shelter usually smaller than a headend that takes an already processed video signal from a headend and transmits it to a local community. (or multiple communities) Most cable hubs are used in conjunction with an HFC Plant. Combined IP video and data enters a hub via a microwave or fiber optic transport circuit and gets routed to QAM devices such as a cable modem termination system which changes the IP data into an RF QAM to be combined with other services (such as video on demand, switched video) and transmitted to the subscriber. The RF from each service gets combined in the hub to ultimately a single coax cable broken down per node, but right before it leaves the hub to feed customers, gets changed to fiber optic light to feed local cable nodes which may cover a large building, a neighborhood or in rural areas, an entire community. The cable node located in the field in-turn reverses the optical light from the hub and changes the signals back to RF over coaxial cable. This is called a &quot;forward&quot; path (download). The inverse happens on the upload or &quot;return&quot; path as customers transmit data back to a hub. Cable nodes were initially intended to reduce amplifier cascade and improve signal quality to subscribers distant from a hub. Modern cable nodes still serve the same purpose for amplifier cascade reduction, but now are strategically placed in areas of high data density to better allocate bandwidth availability and reduce oversubscribing in a particular area. Cable nodes also allow for multiple channel lineups or public access markets out of the same hub.

===Local Channel Receiving=== 
Since a super headend feeding a hub may be located out of market, a hub may also be equipped with an antenna tower and off-air antennas to receive the local channels in that particular market. The local channels received at that hub then get distributed to other hubs in the area. Depending on its geographic footprint and location, a hub may also receive local channels from neighbouring markets and combine them with the immediate market giving viewers from that particular hub multi-market programming, which the cable company may black out certain programming per carriage contract and FCC regulations. A cable system may build a fibre optic circuit as a primary path to a local television station as an additional mean to bring its programming into a cable system and utilise the off-air antennas as a backup.

==OTN Hub==
OTN (Optical Terminal Node) hubs are usually a remote site spawning from a larger hub, located in and intended to serve rural communities and are equipped with just HFC combining equipment for a limited number of optical nodes in the community. An OTN&#x27;s primary purpose is to extend the HFC cable plant to rural communities without having to locate on site, core network equipment such as a CMTS or video edge QAM devices. The OTN relies on the parent hub (where the core network equipment is actually located) to provide the video and HSD services to its area. An OTN is commonly a small shelter or building containing just a few equipment racks.

===Transporting Services to an OTN===
Since core network equipment (CMTS, video edge devices, core router/switches) are not located within the OTN itself, HSD and video services are multiplexed and transmitted to the OTN from the parent hub over an RF-to-fiber link. At the OTN, the individual services get de-multiplexed and connected into the OTN&#x27;s forward/return combining plant for distribution to the community. OTNs also allow rual communities to be served with the same tier of service urban communities can receive without the cable operator having to invest large amounts of money on additional fiber construction and networking equipment for only a limited number of potential customers.

<doc id="353081" wikidata="Q1175156" url="?curid=353081" title="Max Payne (video game)">
<text>Max Payne is a 2001 third-person shooter game developed by Remedy Entertainment. It was originally released for Windows by Gathering of Developers in July 2001, and was later ported by Rockstar Games to the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in December 2001, and by MacSoft and Feral Interactive to Mac OS X in July 2002. A version of the game for the Game Boy Advance, featuring an isometric perspective but retaining most of the original&#x27;s gameplay elements, was released by Rockstar in December 2003, and an enhanced port for mobile devices was published in 2012 to coincide with the release of Rockstar&#x27;s &quot;Max Payne 3&quot;. A Dreamcast version of the game was also planned, but was canceled due to the discontinuation of the console in 2001. &quot;Max Payne&quot; was also made available on Xbox 360 as part of Xbox Originals program in 2009, on PlayStation 3 as a PS2 Classic in 2012, on PlayStation 4 in 2016, and on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in 2021, due to the consoles&#x27; respective backward compatibility and emulation features.

The game centers on former NYPD detective Max Payne, who attempts to solve the murder of his family while investigating a mysterious new designer drug called &quot;Valkyr&quot;. While doing so, Max becomes entangled in a large and complex conspiracy involving a major pharmaceutical company, organized crime, a secret society, and the U.S. military. The game features a gritty neo-noir style and uses graphic novel panels with voice-overs as its primary means of storytelling, drawing inspiration from hard-boiled detective novels by authors like Mickey Spillane. It contains many allusions to Norse mythology, particularly the myth of Ragnarök and several names. The gameplay is heavily influenced by the Hong Kong action cinema genre, particularly the work of director John Woo, and it was one of the first games to feature the bullet-time effect popularized by &quot;The Matrix&quot;.

&quot;Max Payne&quot; received positive reviews from critics, who praised its exciting gunplay and use of noir storytelling devices, while some criticised its linear level design and short length. The game sold 4 million units. It is considered one of the greatest games ever made. It won a large number of accolades, including a BAFTA Award for Best PC Game of 2001. Its success launched the &quot;Max Payne&quot; franchise, including the sequels &quot;Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne&quot;, developed again by Remedy and published by Rockstar in October 2003, and &quot;Max Payne 3&quot;, developed solely by Rockstar and released in May 2012. A loose film adaptation of the first game was released in October 2008. In 2022, it was announced that Remedy is developing remakes of &quot;Max Payne&quot; and &quot;Max Payne 2&quot; for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S, with Rockstar publishing.

==Gameplay==

The player assumes the role of the titular character, with gameplay revolving around the use of the bullet time mechanic during firefights – when triggered, time is slowed down to such an extent that the speed at which bullets and other projectiles move is slow enough to be seen by the naked eye. Although Max&#x27;s movement is also slowed, the player is still able to aim and react in real-time, allowing them more time to plan and react to enemies.

Players are initially armed with a 9mm Beretta pistol, but as the game progresses, other weapons become available including submachine guns and explosives, with Max able to dual-wield some weapons for an increase in firepower at the cost of higher ammo consumption. When hurt, Max can replenish health by taking painkillers, which can be found in medical cabinets, lying around in levels, or taken from slain enemies.

The game&#x27;s AI is dependent on scripted commands: most of the behavior exhibited by enemies (such as taking cover, retreating from the player, or throwing grenades) is scripted.

Progression through the levels is linear, occasionally incorporating small platforming and puzzle-solving elements. The game&#x27;s storyline is often advanced in-game by the player following Max&#x27;s internal monologue as the character determines what his next steps should be, breaking between – and sometimes within – levels in order to deliver larger story beats via graphic novel-styled interludes.

In addition to the standard game difficulty, &quot;Fugitive&quot;, the game also features &quot;Hard-Boiled&quot;, which increases damage taken while limiting health and ammo supplies; &quot;Dead on Arrival&quot;, which limits the player to only seven saves per chapter; and &quot;New York Minute&quot;, which forces the player to complete each chapter within an allotted time. Upon completing the game on &quot;Dead on Arrival&quot;, the player unlocks &quot;The Last Challenge&quot; (also known as &quot;End Combat&quot; or &quot;Final Battle&quot; in other releases), which gives the player a select amount of painkillers, weapons, and ammunition, and puts them in a firefight with perpetual bullet time against the &quot;Killer Suit&quot; hitmen seen during the later parts of the game&#x27;s campaign.

==Plot==

Max Payne (James McCaffrey) is a former NYPD officer-turned-DEA agent whose wife Michelle (Haviland Morris) and newborn daughter Rose were murdered by armed junkies that were high on a new designer drug called Valkyr. In 2001, three years after their deaths, Max works undercover within the Punchinello Crime Family, who control the trafficking of Valkyr. His DEA colleague, B.B. (Adam Grupper), arranges a meeting between Max and his friend and former colleague, Alex Balder (Chris Phillips), in a subway station. While waiting for Alex, Max accidentally gets in a shootout with mobsters working for Punchinello underboss Jack Lupino (Jeff Gurner), who are staging a bank robbery through an abandoned part of the subway. When Alex arrives, he is killed by an unseen assassin, who frames Max for the murder.

Hunted by both the police and his former mob associates, who now know he is a cop, Max searches for Vinnie Gognitti (Joe Dallo), Lupino&#x27;s right-hand man, in New York&#x27;s underworld in the hopes that he will lead him to Lupino. Along the way, he breaks up a Valkyr drug deal and discovers that Russian mobster Vladimir Lem (Dominic Hawksley) has started a war with the Punchinello family. After catching Gognitti, Max interrogates him and learns Lupino is at his nightclub. Max kills Lupino before running into Mona Sax (Julia Murney), a contract assassin and the sister-in-law of Don Angelo Punchinello (Joe Ragno). Mona, seeking revenge against Punchinello for abusing her sister and not wanting Max to get in her way, gives him a drink laced with Valkyr. While experiencing a nightmare of the night his family was killed, Max is found by mobsters and taken away to be tortured, but manages to escape.

Max strikes a partnership with Lem, who gives him a tip about a cargo ship at the Brooklyn waterfront carrying high-powered firearms, which some of Lem&#x27;s former henchmen intend to sell to Punchinello. After securing the weapons, Max attempts to lure the Don into a trap at his restaurant, only to be ambushed himself. After escaping, Max storms Punchinello&#x27;s manor and confronts the Don, but discovers that he is only a puppet in a bigger conspiracy. The manor is then overrun by mercenaries who kill Punchinello and leave Max for dead after injecting him with a Valkyr overdose.

After another drug-induced nightmare, Max heads to an old steel foundry where the mercenaries are regrouping. There, he finds a hidden underground military research complex, and discovers that Valkyr is the result of the &quot;Valhalla Project&quot;, a Gulf War-era military experiment to improve soldiers&#x27; stamina and morale through chemical enhancements. The project was halted after a few years due to poor results, but was later secretly restarted by Nicole Horne (Jane Gennaro) through her pharmaceutical company, Aesir. When Michelle accidentally found out about Aesir&#x27;s illegal experiments, Horne ordered her and her family&#x27;s death. Max escapes from the bunker after Aesir initiates a self-destruct protocol to get rid of the evidence and witnesses, including their own men.

Max, having figured out that B.B. is on Horne&#x27;s payroll and framed him for Alex&#x27;s murder, agrees to meet him at a parking lot complex, where he kills him and his men. Max is then called to meet a secret society called the Inner Circle, who have been observing him. Their leader, Alfred Woden (John Randolph Jones), reveals that Horne was once a member, and asks Max to kill her in exchange for dealing with the charges against him. The meeting is ambushed by Horne&#x27;s men, but both Max and Woden escape. Max arrives at Aesir&#x27;s headquarters and fights his way to the top. Along the way, Max runs into Mona again, who has been hired by Horne to kill him; she refuses to do so and is seemingly killed for it, but her body vanishes. As Horne attempts to flee in her helicopter, Max severs the guy wires of the building&#x27;s antenna, causing it to crash into the helicopter and kill Horne. As the NYPD storms the building, Max surrenders and is taken into custody. Outside, he notices Woden among the crowd formed at the scene and smiles knowing that Woden will ensure his protection.

== Characters ==
;Max Payne

Max Payne (voiced by James McCaffrey) is a fugitive DEA agent and former NYPD detective whose wife Michelle and newborn daughter were killed in connection with the Valkyr drug case. Max then goes undercover in the mob and eventually becomes a one-man-army vigilante, waging a personal war on crime. Max ends up killing hundreds of gangsters and conspiracy enforcers while on the run from the police determined to stop his vendetta against all those responsible for his family&#x27;s death. He uses metaphors and wordplay to describe the world around him within his inner monologues, which often contradict his external responses to characters he speaks with. The game presents the story as retold by Max from his point of view.

;Mona Sax

Mona Sax (voiced by Julia Murney): The twin sister of Lisa Punchinello and a contract killer, Mona is the femme fatale of the game. She has a grudge against her sister Lisa&#x27;s abusive husband, Mafia boss Angelo Punchinello, whom she desires to kill. After Punchinello is killed, she sides with Nicole Horne, who hires her to kill Max. Finding herself unable to do so, she is shot in the head by one of Horne&#x27;s henchmen and collapses inside an elevator, though it is implied that she survived, as her body is gone when the elevator&#x27;s doors reopen.

==Development==
Remedy Entertainment developed an idea of a &quot;third-person action game&quot; in late 1996, after completing &quot;Death Rally&quot; (their first game), inspired first by &quot;Loaded&quot; and then by the success of &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; (although determined to avoid its &quot;horrid camera system&quot;). According to the game&#x27;s story and scriptwriter Sam Lake, for him &quot;the starting point was this archetype of the private eye, the hard-boiled cop&quot; that would be used in a game with a &quot;deeper, more psychological&quot; story. A game prototype and design document of the project, with the working titles &quot;Dark Justice&quot; and &quot;Max Heat&quot; (a wordplay on this is a TV show called &quot;Dick Justice&quot; and a porn film &quot;Max Heat&quot;, both featured in &quot;Max Payne 2&quot;), were soon created and shown to 3D Realms, who signed a development deal and production began. In 1999, the designers traveled from Finland to New York to research the city, accompanied by two ex-NYPD bodyguards, to get ideas for environments and take thousands of photographs for mapping.

For cutscenes, the developers found comic panels (with voice-overs) to be more effective and less costly to use than fully animated cinematics, noting that comic panels forced the player to interpret each panel for themselves and &quot;the nuances are there in the head of the reader [...] it would be much harder to reach that level with in-game or even pre-rendered cinematics&quot;. They also found it easier to reorganize the comic panels if the plot needed to be changed while developing the game. The in-game engine is used for some cutscenes involving action sequences. The music for the game was composed by Kärtsy Hatakka.

Remedy used their game engine, which they dubbed MaxFX (or MAX-FX, in development since early 1997). The only games that used this engine were &quot;Max Payne&quot; and its sequel, while a MaxFX level editor was also included in the release. MAX-FX was licensed to Futuremark, who used it for their 3DMark benchmark series with the last one being 3DMark 2001 Second Edition.

The first trailer showcasing an early version of the game&#x27;s story and gameplay was shown at the 1998 E3, attracting considerable interest due to its innovative content and effects (especially the MaxFX&#x27;s 3D particle-based system for smoke and muzzle flashes), although 3D Realms producers later claimed they deliberately avoided overhyping the game. &quot;Max Payne&quot; was initially scheduled to be released in the summer of 1999; however, it was repeatedly delayed and got heavily revamped in 2000. In particular, the game&#x27;s graphics were improved to feature much more realistic textures and lighting, while the multiplayer mode was dropped. The game was released for Windows on 25 July 2001. The intended release was on Monday, 23 July 2001 but an error on the customs form for the shipment from the production facility in Canada caused FedEx to ship the game copies to Memphis, Tennessee, instead of Dallas, such that a trucking company had to be hired to bring them to their intended destination for worldwide shipment.

As a result of the inevitable comparisons to &quot;The Matrix&quot;, the designers have included several homages to the film in order to capitalize on the hype: for instance, the detonation of the subway tunnel door to gain access to the bank vault is similar to the cartwheeling elevator door in the movie, while the introduction &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot; level is similar to the lobby shootout scene in the film. Futuremark, which licensed the MAX-FX graphics for their 3DMark benchmark series, included a &quot;Matrix&quot;-like lobby shootout as a game test in the 2001 edition.

===Game Boy Advance version===
Released on 16 December 2003, the GBA version of the game was developed in 2003 by Möbius Entertainment (later Rockstar Leeds). Since it was developed on a far less powerful platform, this version differs significantly from the PC versions and its Xbox and PlayStation 2 ports: instead of a 3D shooter, the game is based on sprite graphics and is shown from an isometric perspective. However, the other gameplay features have remained very similar to the original, including the use of polygonal graphics for the characters. The story also remained the same as in the PC and console versions, though some levels from the original are omitted, and the game still features many of the original&#x27;s graphic novel sections, complete with some of the voice-overs. The music was composed by Tom Kingsley.

===&quot;Max Payne Mobile&quot;===
On 6 April 2012, Max Payne was announced for Android and iOS, titled &quot;Max Payne Mobile&quot;, a port of the PC version of the original &quot;Max Payne&quot;. The game was released for iOS on 13 April 2012, while the Android version was delayed until 14 June 2012. No major changes were made to the game apart from the HD overhaul. A new version 1.3 was released on 18 March 2013 that fixes a bug that prevents users from accessing their cloud saves.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Max Payne&quot; was released to positive reviews. &quot;AllGame&quot; praised the game&#x27;s atmosphere, level and sound design while stating that the &quot;story is, at times, predictable and full of clichés&quot; and that &quot;Unlike &quot;Half-Life&quot;, where the action is integrated perfectly with its simplistic, yet appropriate story, Max Payne frequently yanks you out of the game and forces you to look at a badly-drawn in-game &#x27;graphic novel&#x27; and listen to mediocre dialogue.&quot; The review also noted a lack of replay value or multiplayer modes. In a mixed review, &quot;Edge&quot; praised &quot;Max Payne&quot; for successfully integrating the bullet time mechanic into its core but criticized its linear and shallow level design. While the graphics were generally praised for high-resolution textures, the character models lacked animated facial expressions (&quot;IGN&quot; criticized the titular character&#x27;s &quot;grimace on his face that makes him look constipated&quot;).

The PlayStation 2 version suffered from reduced detail and occasional slowdowns, as the game stressed the limits of the console&#x27;s power. Also, the levels were broken up into smaller parts so it would not tax the PlayStation 2&#x27;s 32 MB of RAM, which according to &quot;IGN&quot; caused &quot;heavy disruption to the flow and tension of the story&quot;. Otherwise, it was a faithful port that retained all of the content from the PC original. &quot;GameSpot&quot; awarded it an 8.0/10, (compared to the 9.2 ratings awarded to the PC and Xbox versions), saying &quot;If you can&#x27;t play this intense, original action game on any platform except the PS2, then that&#x27;s where you should play it--but only by default.&quot;

Jeff Lundrigan reviewed the PC version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;&quot;Max Payne&quot; is not perfect. On the other hand, we can think of few games, ever, that were such a blast to play, so neatly captured the essence of what they set out to simulate, or were just so over-the-top cool.&quot;

&quot;Max Payne Mobile&quot; received generally positive reviews. Appolicious praised the HD graphics overhaul, although it pointed out the game&#x27;s age and the issues with the touchscreen controls.

===Sales===
In the United States, in its debut month, &quot;Max Payne&quot; sold roughly 82,000 units. In the US, it was the 19th best-selling computer game of 2001, with domestic sales of 300,782 units and revenues of $13.8 million. In the US, the game&#x27;s PC and PlayStation 2 versions respectively sold 430,000 units ($16.9 million in revenue) and 1.6 million units ($56 million in revenue) by 2006. According to &quot;Edge&quot; and &quot;Next Generation&quot;, this made &quot;Max Payne&quot; the country&#x27;s 33rd highest-selling computer game released between 2000 and 2006, and the 26th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between those dates.

In the United Kingdom, the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA) awarded &quot;Max Payne&quot;″s computer version a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award, and its PlayStation 2 version a &quot;Gold&quot; award, indicating respective sales of at least 100,000 and 200,000 units in the country.

&quot;Max Payne&quot; ultimately sold 4 million units. 

=== Accolades ===
The game won many annual awards for the year 2001, including Best PC Game by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts; Golden Joystick Award by Dennis Publishing; Visitors Award Best PC Game at the European Computer Trade Show; Best Game of 2001, Best Graphics in a PC Game, and Best PC Action Game by &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;; Readers Choice Best Game and Best PC Game by &quot;Pelit&quot;; Computer Game of the Year by &quot;The Augusta Chronicle&quot;; Best PC Game of 2001 by Amazon.com; PC Game of the Year by Shacknews and by GameZone; The Best of 2001 - PC and Editor&#x27;s Choice by Game Revolution; Reader&#x27;s Choice Game, Best Single Player Action Game, and Best Xbox Game by GameSpot; Readers&#x27; Choice Game of the Year, Best Storyline, Best Graphics and Best Use of Sound, and Best Adventure Game (Xbox) and Editor&#x27;s Choice by IGN; Gamers Choice Award (Xbox) by Games Domain; Best Gimmick by GameSpy (runner-up in the Best Ingame Cinematics and Best Movie Trailer categories); and Editor&#x27;s Choice and Best Innovation Destined for Overuse by &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;. The staff of IGN wrote: &quot;This game garnered so many votes from the readers that we almost decided to create a new Best Max Payne Game of 2001 category.&quot; The site also called it the 96th best PlayStation 2 game. They claimed that gamers thought of &quot;Max Payne&quot; instead of &quot;The Matrix&quot; when they thought of bullet time. &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; presented &quot;Max Payne&quot; with its 2001 &quot;Best Action Game&quot; and &quot;Best Graphics&quot; awards and the editors summarized the game as &quot;spine-chilling, exhilarating, and surreal&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; named &quot;Max Payne&quot;″s Xbox version the sixth-best console game of 2001. It was a runner-up in the publication&#x27;s annual &quot;Best Xbox Game&quot; and, among console games, &quot;Best Story&quot; and &quot;Best Shooting Game&quot; award categories.

An early version of &quot;Max Payne&quot; was also a runner-up for the Best of Show award at E3 in 1998. The finished game received several Game of the Month-type awards in various video game outlets (and a Seal of Excellence at Adrenaline Vault) and was included in the 2005 list of 50 best games of all time, as well as in the 2011 list of 100 top PC games of all time. In 2007, bit-tech included the game and its sequel on the list of the top five most moddable games. It received two awards from Eurogamer, Best Game Cinematography Award and Best Game Character Award of 2001.

==Legacy==

A sequel, &quot;Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne&quot;, was released in 2003. The third game, &quot;Max Payne 3&quot;, was developed by Rockstar Games and released in 2012. &quot;Max Payne&quot;, a film loosely based on the video game, was released in 2008, starring Mark Wahlberg as Max Payne and Mila Kunis as Mona Sax. In April 2022, Remedy announced that it is remaking &quot;Max Payne&quot; and &quot;Max Payne 2&quot; with funding from Rockstar, using Remedy&#x27;s Northlight Engine, to be released as a compilation for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S.

<text>Michel Lotito (; 16 June 1950 17 April 2006) was a French entertainer, born in Grenoble, famous for deliberate consumption of indigestible objects. He came to be known as Monsieur &quot;Mouth&quot; Mangetout (&quot;Mr. Eat-All&quot;). His digestive system was incredibly resilient, allowing him to consume up to 900 grams of metal per day. He started eating this unusual diet at age 9.

== Entertainment ==
Michel Lotito began eating unusual material at 9 years of age, and he performed publicly beginning in 1966, around the age of 16. He had an eating disorder known as pica, which is a psychological disorder characterised by an appetite for substances that are largely non-nutritive. Doctors determined that Lotito also had a thick lining in his stomach and intestines which allowed his consumption of sharp metal without suffering injury. Lotito also had digestive juices that were unusually powerful, meaning that he could digest the unusual materials. Soft foods, such as bananas gave him heartburn specifically when he had metal in his stomach.

Lotito&#x27;s performance involved the consumption of metal, glass, rubber and other materials. He disassembled, cut up, and consumed items such as bicycles, shopping carts, televisions, beds and a Cessna 150, among other items. It took him roughly two years, from 1978 to 1980, to eat the Cessna 150.

Lotito claimed not to suffer ill effects from his consumption of substances typically considered poisonous. When performing, he ingested approximately of material daily, preceding it with mineral oil and drinking considerable quantities of water during the meal. It is estimated that between 1959 and 1997, Lotito &quot;had eaten nearly nine tons of metal.&quot;

Lotito&#x27;s method for eating all of this metal was to break it into small pieces before attempting to eat it. He then drank mineral oil and continued to drink water while swallowing the metal bits. This allowed him to swallow the metal without damaging his throat. Lotito did not have any digestive problems as a result of his unusual diet.

In 2022, Madison Dapcevich of &quot;Snopes&quot;, the fact-checking website, investigated Lotito&#x27;s claim that he ate an entire airplane. She concluded that, although there are many accounts of Lotito&#x27;s consumption of unusual objects, and that he &quot;very likely&quot; consumed such objects on stage as a professional entertainer, she was unable to confirm that Lotito ate an entire airplane, or even part of one.

==Awards==
Lotito holds the record for the &#x27;strangest diet&#x27; in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;. He was awarded a brass plaque by the publishers to commemorate his abilities. He ate his award.

==Death==
Lotito died of natural causes at age 55 on 17 April 2006 in Grenoble.

==List of unusual items consumed==
At least: 

*45 door hinges
*18 bicycles
*15 shopping carts
*7 TV sets
*6 chandeliers
*2 beds
*1 pair of skis
*1 computer
*1 copy of the textbook Gravitation by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler.
*1 Cessna 150 light aircraft
*1 waterbed (full of water)
* of steel chain at once
*1 coffin (with handles)
*1 Guinness award plaque
*Assorted razors and bolts
==In popular culture==

* &quot;The Man Who Ate the 747&quot; (2000) is the debut novel of Ben Sherwood. It follows a record keeper for &quot;The Book of Records&quot; who discovers a farmer attempting to woo a woman by gradually eating a Boeing 747. The novel was heavily inspired by &quot;The Guinness Book of World Records&quot;; Sherwood interviewed Lotito via telephone as part of his research.
* &quot;How to Eat an Airplane&quot; (2016) is a picture book based on Lotito, written by Peter Pearson and illustrated by Mircea Catusanu.

<doc id="353085" wikidata="Q7993606" url="?curid=353085" title="While">
<text>While is a word in the English language that functions both as a noun and as a subordinating conjunction. Its meaning varies largely based on its intended function, position in the phrase and even the writer or speaker&#x27;s regional dialect. As a conjunction, it is synonymous with the word whilst, a form often considered archaic in American English, as well as in some style guides on both sides of the Atlantic.

==Usage==

===Noun===
&quot;A while&quot; and &quot;awhile&quot; are often confused due to the fact that &quot;while&quot; is often accompanied by the indefinite article. The main difference is that &quot;a while&quot; means &quot;an amount of time&quot; or &quot;some duration&quot; whereas &quot;awhile&quot; is an adverb meaning &quot;&quot;for&quot; some amount of time&quot; or &quot;&quot;for&quot; some duration&quot;.

:&quot;I slept for a while before dinner.&quot;
:&quot;I slept awhile before dinner.&quot;

Both of these sentences yield the same effective meaning. &quot;Whilst&quot; is only a conjunction, and so its use here would be incorrect.

===Conjunction===
The primary function of the word as a conjunction is to indicate that two separate clauses occur at the same time.

:&quot;The days were hot while we were on vacation.&quot;
:&quot;I read a magazine while I was waiting.&quot;

&quot;While&quot; can also be legitimately used in the contrastive sense, comparable to the words &quot;although&quot; or &quot;whereas&quot;, provided that it is not ambiguous (although some commentators, such as Eric Partridge, have disapproved of such use):

:&quot;While I like cats, my husband is allergic.&quot;
:&quot;While Sally plays, Sue works.&quot;

The latter sentence can mean either &quot;during the time that Sally plays, Sue works&quot; or &quot;although Sally plays, Sue works&quot; and is thus ambiguous.

&quot;Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot; disapproves of several uses of the conjunctive &quot;while&quot;. At times it is inappropriately used as a coordinating conjunction: &quot;and&quot; or &quot;but&quot; should be used instead. Its usage as &quot;elegant variation&quot; is also discouraged, as it is masquerading as a &quot;formal word&quot;.

In some dialects of Northern England, &quot;while&quot; is translated into standard English as &quot;until&quot;; for example, &quot;At least wait while we&#x27;re done.&quot;

===Usage===
In standard British English and Australian English, &quot;whilst&quot;, as a conjunction, is synonymous with &quot;although&quot;, &quot;whereas&quot;, &quot;but&quot; or &quot;while&quot;. Unlike &quot;whilst&quot;, &quot;while&quot; is also used as a noun (as in &quot;rest for a while&quot;) or a verb (as in &quot;while away the hours&quot;).

The usage of &quot;whilst&quot; is chiefly British. For example, the BBC World Service website &quot;Learning English&quot;, in their &quot;Ask about English&quot; section, uses the word &quot;whilst&quot; when explaining the usage of &quot;while and whereas&quot;.

In American English, &quot;whilst&quot; is considered to be pretentious, archaic, and obsolete.

Some publications on both sides of the Atlantic disapprove of &quot;whilst&quot; in their style guides (along with other words ending in &quot;st&quot;; &quot;amidst&quot;, &quot;amongst&quot;, &quot;unbeknownst&quot;, etc.); for example:
* BBC News: &quot;while and not &#x27;whilst&#x27;&quot;
* Times Online Style Guide: &quot;while (not whilst)&quot;
* Guardian Style Guide: &quot;while not whilst&quot;
* Hansard: the Canadian Parliament record: &quot;while not whilst&quot;

The American Heritage Guide writes that, &quot;while using &quot;whilst&quot; runs the risk of sounding pretentious, it can sometimes add a literary or ironically formal note to a piece of writing&quot;.

&quot;Practical English Usage&quot; by Michael Swan (OUP), a reference book for intermediate and advanced learners of English, does not include &quot;whilst&quot; but has several sections covering the usage of &quot;while&quot;.

<text>The Mäntsälä rebellion (, ) was a failed coup attempt by the Lapua Movement to overthrow the Finnish government.

On 27 February 1932, some 400 armed members of the Civil Guards had interrupted a meeting of Social Democrats in Mäntsälä with small arms fire. This action had been done by a regional sect of the movement, however, the national organization soon joined in. In the next few days, leading members of the Lapua Movement and hundreds of armed members of Civil Guards arrived at Mäntsälä. The former Chief of General Staff, Major General Wallenius also joined the leadership of the rebellion. The men refused to disperse and demanded the cabinet&#x27;s resignation and a change in political course.

Two days later, the cabinet ordered the leaders of the Lapua Movement arrested using the &quot;Protection of the Republic Act&quot; which the movement itself had urged for a year before. Army units prepared as the Chief of Defence, Lieutenant General Aarne Sihvo was prepared to use force to end the rebellion. Orders were given to reinforce the defence of Helsinki with tanks and artillery in case the situation worsened. As the tensions grew, so did the consumption of alcohol among the instigators.

On 2 March 1932, President Pehr Evind Svinhufvud gave a radio speech in which he urged the militiamen to return home and promised that only the leaders would be punished. The President&#x27;s speech was as follows:

The men dispersed and the leaders were arrested a few days later. In spring, the Lapua Movement was disbanded. Only a small part of the Civil Guards had joined the rebels, while the majority remained loyal to the government. On 16 July 1932, an indictment sought the punishment of 102 rebels. Of these defendants, 52 of them received prison terms, 32 received conditional prison terms, 20 of them were pardoned, and 24 were released without any criminal convictions.

The Mäntsälä rebellion can be considered the last major radical-right-wing incident in Finland after the Civil War. In the coming years, the economic situation in Finland would improve and radical movements would lose support.

<text>Malacology is the branch of invertebrate zoology that deals with the study of the Mollusca (molluscs or mollusks), the second-largest phylum of animals in terms of described species after the arthropods. Mollusks include snails and slugs, clams, and cephalopods, along with numerous other kinds, many of which have shells. Malacology derives &#x27;-logy&#x27;, &#x27;study of&#x27;.

Fields within malacological research include taxonomy, ecology and evolution. Several subdivisions of malacology exist, including conchology, devoted to the study of mollusk shells, and teuthology, the study of cephalopods such as octopus, squid, and cuttlefish. Applied malacology studies medical, veterinary, and agricultural applications, for example the study of mollusks as vectors of schistosomiasis and other diseases.

Archaeology employs malacology to understand the evolution of the climate, the biota of the area, and the usage of the site.

Zoological methods are used in malacological research. Malacological field methods and laboratory methods (such as collecting, documenting and archiving, and molecular techniques) were summarized by Sturm et al. (2006).

== History ==
Malacology evolved from the earlier discipline of conchology, which focused solely on the collection and classification of shells. The transformation into a comprehensive field of biological study occurred over several key historical milestones.

===Early period pre-1795===

Before the late 18th century, the study of mollusks was limited to conchology, emphasizing the aesthetic and taxonomic value of shells. During this time, the term &quot;mollusks&quot; referred only to shell-less species such as cephalopods and slugs. Organisms with shells were classified under &quot;Testacea&quot;, reflecting a limited understanding of their broader biological characteristics.

===The contributions of Cuvier===

In 1795, French naturalist Georges Cuvier introduced a new classification system for invertebrates based on anatomical observations. He proposed that mollusks represented a distinct group of organisms unified by common morphological traits. This approach laid the groundwork for the transition from conchology to malacology, as it highlighted the importance of internal anatomy over external shell features.

===Early 19th century===

Following Cuvier’s work, the early 19th century saw an expansion of the field’s focus. Scientists began studying not only the external shells of mollusks but also their internal anatomy, physiological functions, and ecological roles. This marked a shift toward viewing mollusks as complete organisms, rather than merely as shell producers. The term &quot;malacology&quot; was officially introduced in 1825 by French zoologist and anatomist Henri-Marie Ducrotay de Blainville. Derived from the Greek word &quot;malakos&quot; (meaning &quot;soft&quot;), it reflected a broader interest in the biological and ecological characteristics of mollusks, including their soft body structures. This moment is considered the formal establishment of malacology as a distinct scientific discipline.

===Late 19th century and beyond===

By the late 19th century, malacology had expanded further to encompass evolutionary biology, taxonomy, and ecology. Researchers investigated the relationships between mollusks and other invertebrates, as well as their roles in various ecosystems. The discipline continued to integrate new methodologies and technologies, solidifying its place within zoology.

== Malacologists ==

Those who study malacology are known as malacologists. Those who study primarily or exclusively the shells of mollusks are known as conchologists, while those who study mollusks of the class Cephalopoda are teuthologists.

<text>George Peter Metesky (November 2, 1903 – May 23, 1994), better known as the Mad Bomber, was an American electrician and mechanic who terrorized New York City for 16 years in the 1940s and 1950s with explosives that he planted in theaters, terminals, libraries and offices. Bombs were left in phone booths, storage lockers and restrooms in public buildings, including Grand Central Terminal, Pennsylvania Station, Radio City Music Hall, the New York Public Library, the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the RCA Building, and in the New York City Subway. Metesky also bombed movie theaters, where he cut into seat upholstery and slipped his explosive devices inside.

Angry and resentful about events surrounding a workplace injury suffered years earlier, Metesky planted at least 33 bombs, of which 22 exploded, injuring 15 people.
The hunt for the bomber enlisted an early use of offender profiling. He was apprehended in 1957 based on clues given in letters he wrote to a newspaper. He was found legally insane and committed to a state mental hospital.
==Industrial injury==
Following World War I, Metesky joined the U.S. Marines, serving as a specialist electrician at the United States Consulate in Shanghai. Returning home, he went to work as a mechanic for a subsidiary of the Consolidated Edison utility company and lived in Waterbury, Connecticut, with his two unmarried sisters. In 1931, Metesky was working as a generator wiper at the company&#x27;s Hell Gate generating plant when a boiler backfire produced a blast of hot gases. The blast knocked Metesky down and the fumes filled his lungs, choking him.

The accident left him disabled and, after collecting 26 weeks of sick pay, he lost his job. According to claims disputed by Consolidated Edison, the accident led to pneumonia that in turn developed into tuberculosis. A claim for workers&#x27; compensation was denied because he waited too long to file it. Three appeals of the denial were also rejected, the last in 1936. He developed a hatred for the company&#x27;s attorneys and for the three co-workers whose testimony in his compensation case he believed was perjured in favor of the company.

==Bombs==

Metesky&#x27;s bombs were gunpowder-filled pipe bombs, ranging in size from long and from in diameter. Most used timers constructed from flashlight batteries and cheap pocket watches. Investigators at bomb sites learned to look for a wool sock – Metesky used these to transport the bombs and sometimes to hang them from a rail or projection.

Between 1940 and 1956, Metesky planted at least 33 bombs, of which 22 exploded, injuring 15 people.

===First bombs (1940–1941)===
He planted his first bomb on November 16, 1940, leaving it on a window sill at the Consolidated Edison power plant at 170 West 64th Street in Manhattan. Metesky&#x27;s first bomb was crude, a short length of brass pipe filled with gunpowder, with an ignition mechanism made of sugar and flashlight batteries. Enclosed in a wooden toolbox and left on a Consolidated Edison power plant window sill, it was found before it could go off. It was wrapped in a note written in distinctive block letters and signed &quot;F.P.&quot;, stating 

Some investigators wondered if the bomb was an intentional dud, since if it had exploded the note would have been obliterated.

In September 1941, a bomb with a similar ignition mechanism was found lying in the street about five blocks away from the Consolidated Edison headquarters building at 4 Irving Place. This one had no note, and was also a dud. Police theorized that the bomber might have spotted a police officer and dropped the bomb without setting its fuse.

===Hiatus===
Shortly after the United States entered World War II in December 1941, the police received a letter in block capital letters:

True to his word, Metesky planted no bombs between 1941 and 1951, choosing instead to send letters and postcards to police stations, newspapers, private citizens and Con Edison. Investigators studying the penciled, block-lettered messages noted that the letters &quot;G&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; had an odd shape, possibly indicating a European education.

===1951–1956===

His first two bombs drew little attention, but the string of random bombings that began in 1951 frayed the city&#x27;s nerves and taxed the resources of the New York City Police Department (NYPD). Metesky often placed warning calls to the buildings where he had planted bombs, but would not specify the bomb&#x27;s exact location. He wrote to newspapers warning that he planned to plant more.
Some bombs came with notes, but the note never revealed a motive, or a reason for choosing that particular location. The long hiatus since the last bomb and the improved construction techniques of the first new bomb led investigators to believe that the bomber had served in the military.

For his new wave of bombings, Metesky mainly chose public buildings as targets, bombing several of them multiple times. Bombs were left in phone booths, storage lockers and restrooms in public buildings including Grand Central Terminal (five times), Pennsylvania Station (five times), Radio City Music Hall (three times), the New York Public Library (twice), the Port Authority Bus Terminal (twice) and the RCA Building, as well as in the New York City Subway. Metesky also bombed movie theaters, where he cut into seat upholstery and slipped his explosive devices inside.

====1951====

On March 29, the first Metesky bomb of the new wave, and also the first Metesky bomb to explode, startled commuters in Grand Central Terminal but injured no one. It had been dropped into a sand urn near the Grand Central Oyster Bar &amp; Restaurant on the terminal&#x27;s lower level. In April, Metesky&#x27;s next bomb exploded without injury in a telephone booth in the New York Public Library. In August a phone-booth bomb exploded without injury at Grand Central.

Police dismissed the event as the work of &quot;boys or pranksters&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the event in the following day&#x27;s issue, though only with a three-paragraph brief at the bottom of page 24.

Metesky next planted a bomb that exploded without injury in a phone booth at the Consolidated Edison headquarters building at 4 Irving Place. He also mailed one bomb, which did not explode, to Consolidated Edison from White Plains, New York.

On October 22, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; received a letter in penciled block letters, stating 

The letter directed police to the Paramount Theater in Times Square, where a bomb was discovered and disabled, and to a telephone booth at Pennsylvania Station where nothing was found.

On November 28, a coin-operated locker at the IRT 14th Street subway station was bombed, without injury. Near the end of the year, the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; received another letter, warning:

====1952====
On March 19, a bomb exploded in a phone booth at the Port Authority Bus Terminal without causing injury. In June and again in December bombs exploded in seats at the Lexington Avenue Loew&#x27;s theater. The December bombing injured one person, and was the first Metesky bomb to cause injury. Police had asked the newspapers not to print any of the bomber&#x27;s letters and to play down earlier bombings, but by now the public was becoming aware that a &quot;Mad Bomber&quot; was on the loose.

====1953====
Bombs exploded in seats at Radio City Music Hall and at the Capitol Theater, with no injuries. A bomb again exploded near the Oyster Bar in Grand Central Terminal, this time in a coin-operated rental locker, again with no injuries. Police described this bomb as the homemade product of a &quot;publicity-seeking jerk&quot;. An unexploded bomb was found in a rental locker at Pennsylvania Station.

====1954====
A bomb wedged behind a sink in a Grand Central Terminal men&#x27;s room exploded in March, slightly injuring three men.

A bomb planted in a phone booth at the Port Authority Bus Terminal exploded with no injuries. Another bomb was discovered in a phone booth that was removed from Pennsylvania Station for repair.

As a capacity Radio City Music Hall audience of 6,200 watched Bing Crosby&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot; on November 7, a bomb stuffed into the bottom cushion of a seat in the 15th row exploded, injuring four patrons. The explosion was muffled by the heavy upholstery, and only those nearby heard it. While the film continued, the injured were escorted to the facility&#x27;s first-aid room and about 50 people in the immediate area were moved to the back of the theater. After the film and the following stage show concluded an hour-and-a-half later, the police roped off 150 seats in the area of the explosion and began the search for evidence.

====1955====
A bomb exploded without injuries on the platform at the IRT Sutter Avenue subway station in Brooklyn. A bomb hung beneath a phone booth shelf exploded on the main floor of Macy&#x27;s department store, with no injuries. Two bombs exploded without injuries at Pennsylvania Station, one in a rental locker and one in a phone booth. A bomb was found at Radio City Music Hall after a warning phone call.

At the Roxy Theater, a bomb dropped out of a slashed seat onto an upholsterer&#x27;s workbench without exploding. A seat bomb exploded at the Paramount Theater; one patron was struck on the shoe by bomb fragments but disclaimed injury. Investigators discovered a small penknife pushed inside the seat, one of several found at theater seat bombings. They theorized that the bomber left his knives behind in case he was stopped and questioned. In December, a bomb exploded without injuries in a Grand Central men&#x27;s-room stall.

====1956====
A 74-year-old men&#x27;s-room attendant at Pennsylvania Station was seriously injured when a bomb in a toilet bowl exploded. A young man had reported an obstruction and the attendant tried to clear it using a plunger. Among the porcelain fragments, investigators found a watch frame and a wool sock.

A guard at the RCA Building in Rockefeller Center discovered a piece of pipe about five inches long in a telephone booth. A second guard thought it might be useful in a plumbing project and took it home on the bus to New Jersey, where it exploded on his kitchen table early the next morning. No one was injured.

A December 2 bombing at the Paramount Theater in Brooklyn left six of the theater&#x27;s 1,500 occupants injured, one seriously, and drew tremendous news coverage and editorial attention. The next day, Police Commissioner Stephen P. Kennedy ordered what he called the &quot;greatest manhunt in the history of the Police Department&quot;.

On December 24, a New York Public Library clerk using a phone booth dropped a coin. Looking up after he retrieved it, he saw a maroon-colored sock held to the underside of the shelf by a magnet. The sock contained an iron pipe with a threaded cap on each end. After consulting with other employees, he threw the device out a window into Bryant Park, bringing the bomb squad and more than 60 NYPD police officers and detectives to the scene.

In a letter to the &quot;New York Journal American&quot; the next month, Metesky said that the Public Library bomb, as well as one discovered later the same week inside a seat at the Times Square Paramount, had been planted months before.

===1957 discovery===
Eight months after Metesky&#x27;s January 1957 arrest, a bomb not found in several police searches was discovered at the Lexington Avenue Loew&#x27;s Theater by an upholsterer repairing a recently vandalized seat. It was the last of the three bombs Metesky said he had planted there. The first two had exploded, one in June 1952 and one in December 1952, with the December explosion resulting in one injury. 

As of the Loew&#x27;s discovery, only two of the dozens of bombs that Metesky claimed to have planted remained unaccounted for: one at a Con Edison site on the East River, the other at the Embassy Theater at 7th Avenue and 47th Street.

With the finding of the third Loew&#x27;s bomb, police closed their &quot;Mad Bomber&quot; case, saying that their searches of the two remaining locations had been so thorough that they were satisfied that the bombs were no longer there, if indeed they ever had been.

==Search==
Throughout the investigation, the prevailing theory was that the bomber was a former Con Edison employee with a grudge against the company. Con Edison employment records were reviewed, but there were hundreds of other leads, tips, and crank letters to be followed up on. Detectives ranged far and wide, checking lawsuit records, mental hospital admissions, and vocational schools where bomb parts might be made. Citizens turned in neighbors who behaved oddly, and co-workers who seemed to know too much about bombs. A new group, the Bomb Investigation Unit, was formed to work on nothing but bomber leads.

In April 1956, the department issued a multi-state alert for a person described as a skilled mechanic, with access to a drill press or lathe (for its ability to thread pipe), who posted mail from White Plains, was over 40, and had a &quot;deep-seated hatred of the Consolidated Edison Company&quot;. A warning circular picturing a homemade pipe bomb similar to the bomber&#x27;s was distributed. Police distributed samples of the bomber&#x27;s distinctive printing and asked anyone who might recognize it to notify them. A review of drivers&#x27; license applications in White Plains, the city favored by the bomber for posting his mail, found similarities in 500 of them to the bomber&#x27;s printing; the names were forwarded to the NYPD for investigation.

The December 2, 1956, bombing of the Brooklyn Paramount drew tremendous news coverage and editorial attention. The following day, Police Commissioner Stephen P. Kennedy met with commanders of every NYPD division and ordered what he called the &quot;greatest manhunt in the history of the Police Department&quot;. Calling the bomber&#x27;s activities &quot;an outrage that cannot be tolerated&quot;, he promised &quot;an immediate good promotion&quot; to whoever arrested the bomber, and directed commanders to alert every member of the force to the absolute necessity of a capture.

On December 27, 1956, the New York City Board of Estimate and the Patrolmen&#x27;s Benevolent Association posted $26,000 in rewards for the bomber&#x27;s apprehension.

===Distractions===
Throughout the search, simulated bombs and false bomb reports wasted police resources and frightened an already nervous public.

Around 1951 Frederick Eberhardt, 56 years old and, like Metesky, a former Con Edison employee with a grudge, sent a simulated pipe bomb filled with sugar to the company&#x27;s personnel director at 4 Irving Place. Eberhardt was charged with sending threatening material through the mails. At his arraignment in November, an assistant district attorney told the judge, &quot;This defendant is a particular source of annoyance to the New York City police. We are firmly convinced that he is not of sound mind. He has been sending simulated bombs around the city the past few months. Hundreds of police have been called out at all hours of the day and night to investigate because of his actions.&quot;

Eberhardt was sent to Bellevue Hospital for psychiatric examination. Several months later the case was dismissed after Eberhardt&#x27;s lawyer argued successfully that the package contained no &quot;written threats&quot;, as the law required.

In October 1951, the main waiting room at Grand Central Terminal was emptied and 3,000 lockers were searched after a telephoned bomb warning. The search involved more than 35 NYPD personnel, and took three hours because 1,500 of the lockers were in use and only one master key was available. As each locker was opened, the head of the bomb squad palpated its contents, keeping a portable fluoroscope at the ready.

On December 29, 1956, at the height of false bomb reports from theaters, department stores, schools and offices, a note left in a phone booth at Grand Central Terminal reported that a bomb had been placed at the Empire State Building, requiring a search of all 102 floors of the landmark. A 63-year-old railroad worker picked up at Grand Central as a suspect died of a heart attack while being questioned at the East 35th Street station house. Later investigation eliminated him as a suspect.

==Profile==
Fingerprint experts, handwriting experts, the bomb investigation unit, and other NYPD groups worked with dedication but made little progress. With traditional police methods seemingly useless against Metesky&#x27;s erratic bombing campaign, police captain John Cronin approached his friend James A. Brussel, a criminologist, psychiatrist, and assistant commissioner of the New York State Commission for Mental Hygiene. Captain Cronin asked Brussel to meet with Inspector Howard E. Finney, head of the NYPD&#x27;s Crime Laboratory.

In his office with Finney and two detectives, Brussel examined the crime-scene photos and letters and discussed the bomber&#x27;s metal-working and electrical skills. As he talked with the police, Brussel developed what he called a kind of &quot;portrait&quot; of the bomber, what would now be called an offender profile. The bomber&#x27;s belief that he had been wronged by Consolidated Edison and by others acting in concert with Consolidated Edison seemed to dominate his thoughts, leading Brussel to conclude that the bomber was suffering from paranoia, a condition he described as &quot;a chronic disorder of insidious development, characterized by persistent, unalterable, systematized, logically constructed delusions.&quot; Based on the evidence and his own experience dealing with psychotic criminals, Brussel put forth a number of theories beyond the obvious grudge against Consolidated Edison:



Brussel additionally predicted to his visitors that when the bomber was caught, he would be wearing a double-breasted suit, buttoned.

Although the police policy had been to keep the bomber investigation low-key, Brussel convinced them to heavily publicize the profile, predicting that any wrong assumption made in it would prod the bomber to respond. Under the headline &quot;16-Year Search for a Madman&quot;, the &quot;New York Times&quot; version of the profile summarized the major predictions:

Newspapers published the profile on December 25, 1956, alongside the story of the so-called &quot;Christmas Eve&quot; bomb discovered in the Public Library. By the end of the month, bomb hoaxes and false confessions had risen to epidemic proportions. At the peak of the hysteria on December 28, police received over 50 false bomb alarms, over 20 the next day.

==&quot;Journal-American&quot; letters==
The day after the profile was published, the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; published an open letter, prepared in cooperation with the police, urging the bomber to give himself up. The newspaper promised a &quot;fair trial&quot; and offered to publish his grievances. Metesky wrote back the next day, signing his letter &quot;F.P.&quot;. He said that he would not be giving himself up, and revealed a wish to &quot;bring the Con. Edison to justice&quot;. He listed all the locations where he had placed bombs that year, and seemed concerned that perhaps not all had been discovered. Later in the letter he said 

After some editing by the police, the newspaper published Metesky&#x27;s letter on January 10, along with another open letter asking him for more information about his grievances.

Metesky&#x27;s second letter provided some details about the materials used in the bombs (he favored pistol powder, as &quot;shotgun powder has very little power&quot;), promised a bombing &quot;truce&quot; until at least March 1, and wrote &quot;I was injured on job at Consolidated Edison plant – as a result I am adjudged – totally and permanently disabled&quot;, going on to say that he had to pay his own medical bills and that Consolidated Edison had blocked his workers&#x27; compensation case. He also said 

After police editing, the newspaper published his letter on January 15 and asked the bomber for &quot;further details and dates&quot; about his compensation case so that a new and fair hearing could be held.

Metesky&#x27;s third letter was received by the newspaper on Saturday, January 19. The letter complained of lying unnoticed for hours on &quot;cold concrete&quot; after his injury without any first aid being rendered, then developing pneumonia and later tuberculosis. The letter added details about his lost compensation case and the &quot;perjury&quot; of his co-workers, and gave the date of his injury, September 5, 1931. The letter suggested that if he did not have a family that would be &quot;branded&quot; by his giving himself up, he might consider doing so to get his compensation case reopened.
He thanked the &quot;Journal-American&quot; for publicizing his case and said &quot;the bombings will never be resumed.&quot; This letter was published Tuesday, the day after Metesky was arrested.

==Identification==
Con Edison clerk Alice Kelly had for days been scouring company workers&#x27; compensation files for employees with a serious health problem. On Friday, January 18, 1957, while searching the final batch of &quot;troublesome&quot; worker&#x27;s compensation case files – those where threats were made or implied – she found a file marked in red with the words &quot;injustice&quot; and &quot;permanent disability&quot;, words that had been printed in the &quot;Journal-American&quot;.

The file indicated that Metesky, an employee from 1929 to 1931, had been injured in a plant accident on September 5, 1931. Several letters from Metesky in the file used wording similar to the letters in the &quot;Journal-American&quot;, including the phrase &quot;dastardly deeds&quot;. The police were notified shortly before 5:00 that evening. They initially treated the notification as just &quot;one of a number&quot; of leads they were working on, but asked Waterbury police to do a &quot;discreet check&quot; on George Metesky and the house at 17 Fourth Street.

After Metesky&#x27;s arrest, early police statements credited the finding of his file to an NYPD detective. Later, a report developed in a reward investigation conceded that Alice Kelly had found the file, and explained the misplaced credit as due to a misunderstanding of the file being &quot;picked up&quot; by the detective (at the Con Edison offices on Monday morning) as meaning that the file was &quot;picked out&quot; (of many). Although the NYPD did officially credit Kelly with turning up the clue that led to Metesky&#x27;s arrest, she declined to claim the $26,000 in rewards, saying she had merely been doing her job. Consolidated Edison&#x27;s board of directors also declined to file for the reward, prompting a group of shareholders to file as representatives of Kelly and the company.

Police investigators who later reviewed the path that led them to Metesky said that Con Edison had impeded the investigation for almost two years by repeatedly telling them that the records of employees whose services were terminated prior to 1940, the group Metesky was in, had been destroyed. The investigators said that they had learned of the records&#x27; existence only on January 14, through a confidential tip, and that even in the face of police demands and formal requests Con Edison stalled, declaring that the papers were legal documents and that the company&#x27;s legal department would have to be consulted before granting access. A statement by the president of Consolidated Edison said this was due to a &quot;misunderstanding&quot;.

==Arrest==
Accompanied by Waterbury police, four NYPD detectives arrived at Metesky&#x27;s home with a search warrant shortly before midnight on Monday, January 21, 1957. They asked him for a handwriting sample, and to make a letter &quot;G&quot;. He made the &quot;G&quot;, looked up and said, &quot;I know why you fellows are here. You think I&#x27;m the Mad Bomber.&quot; The detectives asked what &quot;F.P.&quot; stood for, and he responded, &quot;F.P. stands for Fair Play.&quot;

He led them to the garage workshop, where they found his lathe. Back in the house they found pipes and connectors suitable for bombs hidden in the pantry, as well as three cheap pocket watches, flashlight batteries, brass terminal knobs, and unmatched wool socks of the type used to transport the bombs. Metesky had answered the door in pajamas; after he was ordered to get dressed for the trip to Waterbury Police Headquarters, he reappeared wearing a double-breasted suit, buttoned.

==Interrogation==
Metesky told the arresting officers that he had been &quot;gassed&quot; in the Con Edison accident, had contracted tuberculosis as a result, and started planting bombs because he &quot;got a bum deal&quot;. Going over a police list of 32 bomb locations, but never using the word &quot;bomb&quot;, he remembered the exact date where each &quot;unit&quot; had been placed, and its size. He then added to the police list the size, date and location of 15 early bombs the police had not known about – all left at Con Edison locations, and apparently never reported.
When his Con Edison bombs were not mentioned in the newspapers, he started planting bombs in public places to gain publicity for what he termed the &quot;injustices&quot; done him. He also confirmed the reason no bombs were planted during the United States&#x27; involvement in World War II – the former marine had abstained &quot;for patriotic reasons&quot;.

In their search, police found parts for a bomb that would have been larger than any of the others. Metesky explained that it was intended for the New York Coliseum.

==Indictment==
Metesky admitted to placing 32 bombs. After a grand jury heard testimony from 35 witnesses including police experts and those injured, he was indicted on 47 charges – of attempted murder, damaging a building by explosion, maliciously endangering life, and violation of New York State&#x27;s Sullivan Law by carrying concealed weapons, the bombs. Seven counts of attempted murder were charged, based on the seven persons injured in the preceding five years, the statute of limitations in the case. Metesky was brought to the courtroom to hear the charges from Manhattan&#x27;s Bellevue Hospital, where he had been undergoing psychiatric examination.

==Commitment to Matteawan==

After hearing from psychiatric experts, Judge Samuel Liebowitz declared the tubercular Metesky a paranoid schizophrenic, &quot;hopeless and incurable both mentally and physically&quot;, and found him legally insane and incompetent to stand trial. On April 18, 1957, Judge Liebowitz committed Metesky to the Matteawan Hospital for the Criminally Insane at Beacon, New York.

Expected to live only a few weeks due to his advanced tuberculosis, Metesky had to be carried into the hospital. After a year and a half of treatment, his health had improved, and a newspaper article written fourteen years later described the 68-year-old Metesky as &quot;vigorous and healthy looking&quot;.

While he was at Matteawan, the &quot;Journal-American&quot; hired a leading workers&#x27; compensation attorney Bartholomew James O&#x27;Rourke to appeal his disallowed claim for the 1931 injury, on the grounds that Metesky was mentally incompetent at the time and did not know his rights. The appeal was denied.

Metesky was unresponsive to psychiatric therapy, but was a model inmate and caused no trouble. He was visited regularly by his sisters and occasionally by Brussel, to whom he would point out that he had deliberately built his bombs not to kill anyone.

==Release==
In 1973, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a mentally ill defendant cannot be committed to a hospital operated by the New York State Department of Correctional Services unless a jury finds him dangerous. Since Metesky had been committed to Matteawan without a jury trial, he was transferred to the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center, a state hospital outside the correctional system.

Doctors determined that he was harmless, and because he had already served two-thirds of the 25-year maximum sentence he would have received at trial, Metesky was released on December 13, 1973. The single condition was that he make regular visits to a Connecticut Department of Mental Hygiene clinic near his home.

Interviewed by a reporter upon his release, he said that he had forsworn violence, but reaffirmed his anger and resentment toward Consolidated Edison. He also stated that, before he began planting his bombs, 

Metesky returned to his home in Waterbury, where he died 20 years later in 1994 at the age of 90.

<text>The Labour Party of Scotland was a minor Scottish nationalist political party that was active in the early 1970s. Formed as a left-wing breakaway from Dundee&#x27;s branch of the Scottish National Party (SNP), it is perhaps best known for standing in the Dundee East by-election of 1973, where its interference split the nationalist vote and probably cost the SNP a parliamentary seat as a result. The party contested elections to Dundee City Council two months later but was ultimately unsuccessful. It folded soon after, and by early 1974 most of its membership had returned to the SNP, whose campaigns on North Sea oil were proving popular with Scotland&#x27;s urban electorate. It never had any official political representation.

William Wolfe, then leader of the SNP, dismissed the Labour Party of Scotland&#x27;s founding as opportunism on the part of local politicians. These included George MacLean, the party&#x27;s most popular member, whose by-election rival Gordon Wilson succeeded Wolfe in 1979.

==History==
===Formation===
The party was founded by disgruntled Scottish National Party (SNP) activists from Dundee as a breakaway group sometime in the early 1970s. William Wolfe, then leader of the SNP, contended that the split had not occurred as a result of any ideological difference, instead arguing that the leaders of the new group departed to advance their own local political careers. That said, the small party has been described by historian Peter Lynch as more radical than the SNP; it was broadly left-wing and strongly supportive of Scotland&#x27;s labour movement, as its name would suggest. It modeled itself on a separate Glaswegian group that was founded in 1971 and also called itself the &quot;Labour Party of Scotland&quot;, although this faction soon refused any affiliation with the Dundee group. In spite of this, the Dundee party proceeded to develop its organisation and rented office rooms.

===By-election campaign===
Unlike its Glaswegian counterpart, which exclusively contested elections to the Glasgow Corporation, Dundee&#x27;s now larger party fought for a seat in the United Kingdom Parliament. The appointment of George Thomson as a European Commissioner in January 1973 saw him vacate his constituency of Dundee East, triggering a by-election two months later. The Labour Party of Scotland selected George MacLean to be its candidate, pitting him against Labour&#x27;s George Machin, the SNP&#x27;s Gordon Wilson and Conservative candidate William Fitzgerald, then Lord Provost of Dundee. Nathaniel Gordon of the Liberal Party, equally optimistic, attracted Jeremy Thorpe to the city during his campaign. In a closely fought contest, George Machin took the seat with a majority of 1,141, despite Labour&#x27;s vote share declining by 15.6%. This was largely down to the strong performance of the SNP, who increased its own by 21.2%. The latter&#x27;s campaign capitalised on keeping North Sea oil in Scotland to benefit people living in urban areas. A similar platform was used in the Glasgow Govan by-election later that year, electing Margo MacDonald to the House of Commons.

Political scientist David Boothroyd believes that the intervention of the Labour Party of Scotland in the Dundee by-election prevented a similar accomplishment by splitting the nationalist vote. Indeed, the 1,409 votes for MacLean outnumbered Machin&#x27;s majority over his SNP rival Gordon Wilson; Boothroyd further opines &quot;it is questionable whether voters were clear about [the party&#x27;s] origin.&quot; Nevertheless, the SNP&#x27;s popularity in both 1973 by-elections served as a prelude to the &quot;It&#x27;s Scotland&#x27;s oil&quot; political campaign, which has since become synonymous with the party&#x27;s economic case for Scottish independence.

===Council election and dissolution===
On 2 May 1973 elections to Dundee City Council commenced, with the Labour Party of Scotland fielding a total of nine candidates in eight of the city&#x27;s 12 wards. MacLean stood in the Downfield area and returned the party&#x27;s best result, capturing 242 ballots and 6.1% of the vote; D. McGarry, one of two party candidates in Camperdown, produced the weakest, collecting 1.6% with 123 votes. None of the party&#x27;s candidates were elected, leading to its quiet dissolution 22 days later. Such a decision was made in conjunction with the previously unaffiliated Glasgow party so that &quot;the national movement could show a united front&quot;; commentators Andrew Murray Scott and Iain MacLeay simply surmise &quot;[n]either group was successful&quot;. Dissolved by a motion with seven for and just one against, most of their members duly returned to the SNP, some becoming involved with the party&#x27;s pirate station Radio Free Scotland. Without the encumbrance of the minor Dundee group, Gordon Wilson was returned as Member of Parliament for Dundee East in February&#x27;s general election of the following year, concurrently serving as Depute Leader of his party. Wilson later served as Leader of the SNP from 1979 to 1990, succeeding William Wolfe.

<doc id="353102" wikidata="Q313831" url="?curid=353102" title="Franco Corelli">
<text>Franco Corelli (8 April 1921 – 29 October 2003) was an Italian tenor who had a major international opera career between 1951 and 1976. Associated in particular with the spinto and dramatic tenor roles of the Italian repertory, he was celebrated universally for his powerhouse voice, electrifying top notes, clear timbre, passionate singing and remarkable performances. Dubbed the &quot;prince of tenors&quot;, audiences were enchanted by his handsome features and charismatic stage presence. He had a long and fruitful partnership with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City between 1961 and 1975. He also appeared on the stages of most of the major opera houses in Europe and with opera companies throughout North America.

==Biography==

===Early life and education: 1921–1950===
Corelli was born Dario Franco Corelli in Ancona into a family some say had little or no musical background. While his parents were not particularly musical, his paternal grandfather Augusto had actually quit working at 35 to establish a successful career as an operatic tenor. His older brother Aldo subsequently quit school to become an operatic baritone, and two of his uncles sang in the Teatro delle Muse chorus in Ancona. His father was a shipbuilder for the Italian Navy and the family lived beside the Adriatic Sea. Corelli loved the sea and initially decided to follow in the footsteps of his father by pursuing a degree in naval engineering at the University of Bologna. While studying there he entered a music competition under the dare of a friend who was an amateur singer. While he did not win the competition, he was encouraged by the judges to pursue a singing career and Corelli entered the Pesaro Conservatory of Music to study opera.

At the conservatory, Corelli studied under Rita Pavoni, but was unhappy with the results, saying these lessons basically destroyed his upper register. After this Corelli decided to become his own teacher, and referred to voice teachers as &quot;dangerous people&quot; and a &quot;plague to singers&quot;. Corelli stated that he learned part of his technique from a friend who was a student of Arturo Melocchi, the voice teacher who taught Mario Del Monaco, and who advocated a technique based on singing with the larynx lowered. Corelli studied with Melocchi himself only &quot;sometimes&quot;. Corelli modified the technique to avoid limitations that Corelli perceived in the ability of students of Melocchi to handle mezza-voce (moderate volume) and legato (smooth) singing. He carefully studied the career of Del Monaco, who preceded Corelli into the first rank of Italian tenors using the lowered-larynx technique, and who was sometimes criticized for lacking subtlety in his singing. Corelli stated: &quot;I ultimately modified the method so that my larynx &#x27;floats&#x27;—I do not keep it lowered to the maximum at all times.&quot; Corelli also learned by imitating the style and vocal effects of the recordings of great tenors like Enrico Caruso, Giacomo Lauri-Volpi, Aureliano Pertile, and Beniamino Gigli. &quot;Opera News&quot; stated that Corelli&#x27;s lowered-larynx technique &quot;resulted in [a] cavernous sound even in high-flying passages, where it gained brilliance. Regulating the breath pressure, the tenor was able to reduce this sound while retaining the core of the voice in a diminuendo, or even a morendo on a high B-flat, the effect requested by Verdi at the end of &#x27;Celeste Aida&#x27;.&quot;

===Early career: 1951–1960===
In the summer of 1951, Corelli won the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in Florence, earning a debut at Spoleto the following fall. He was originally scheduled to sing Radames in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aïda&quot; and spent three months preparing the role with conductor Giuseppe Bertelli. However, Corelli eventually switched to Don José in Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, feeling that at this point he lacked the technical finesse and legato for the role of Radamès. In May 1952, he made his debut at the Rome Opera as Maurizio in &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot; opposite Maria Caniglia as Adriana. The same year he appeared in operas with smaller opera houses throughout Italy and on the Italian radio. In 1953 he joined the Rome Opera&#x27;s roster of principal tenors where he spent much of his time performing through 1958. His first role with the company in 1953 was that of Romeo in Zandonai&#x27;s rarely heard opera &quot;Giulietta e Romeo&quot;. Later that season he sang Pollione in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot; opposite Maria Callas in the title role. It was the first time the two sang opposite one another and Callas immediately became an admirer of Corelli. The two performed frequently with each other over the next several years in a partnership that lasted to the end of Callas&#x27;s career.

While singing at the Rome Opera, Corelli also made numerous appearances with other opera houses both in Italy and internationally. He made his first appearance at La Scala in Milan in 1954, as Licinio in Spontini&#x27;s &quot;La vestale&quot; opposite Callas&#x27;s Giulia for the opening of the 1954–1955 season. He returned several more times to that house over the next five years, singing opposite Callas in productions of &quot;Fedora&quot; (1956), &quot;Il pirata&quot; (1958) and &quot;Poliuto&quot; (1960). He also notably portrayed the role of Dick Johnson in a highly celebrated performance of &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; at La Scala in 1956, opposite Gigliola Frazzoni and Tito Gobbi, which was broadcast live on Italian radio. Other important debuts for Corelli soon followed, including his first appearances at: the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in Florence and the Arena di Verona Festival in 1955; the Vienna State Opera, as Radamès, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London, as Cavaradossi, in 1957; the Teatro Nacional de São Carlos in Lisbon, the Lyric Opera of Chicago and the San Francisco Opera in 1958; and the Berlin State Opera in 1961. Among the many triumphs of the decade for Corelli were two highly celebrated performances at the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples, a 1958 appearance as Don Alvaro in &quot;La forza del destino&quot; opposite another one of his frequent collaborators, Renata Tebaldi as Leonora and a 1959 performance of Maurizio in &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot; opposite Magda Olivero in the title role.

During his early career, Corelli sang in a number of rare operas in which he triumphed including performances of Spontini&#x27;s &quot;Agnes von Hohenstaufen&quot; in its Italian version, Agnese di Hohenstaufen, Handel&#x27;s &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; and &quot;Hercules&quot;, Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;, and the world premiere of Guido Guerrini&#x27;s &quot;Enea&quot;. By 1960 his active repertory included some 30 roles including the title role in Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;, Turiddu in Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, Rodolfo in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot;, and the title roles in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlo&quot; and &quot;Ernani&quot;.

In 1957, Corelli met soprano Loretta di Lelio when she came backstage after one of his performances at the Rome Opera House to get his autograph. They began seeing each other romantically and married in 1958. After their marriage, Loretta gave up her fledgling opera career to serve as her husband&#x27;s business manager, secretary, public relations agent, cook, and English translator. Their marriage endured until Corelli&#x27;s death forty-five years later.

===The Metropolitan Opera years: 1961–1975===
Corelli made his debut at New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera on 27 January 1961 as Manrico in &quot;Il trovatore,&quot; opposite soprano Leontyne Price as Leonora who was also making her house debut at the Met that evening. He would sing to great acclaim at the Met until 1974 in roles such as Calaf (with Birgit Nilsson as Turandot), Cavaradossi, Maurizio, Ernani, Rodolfo and Edgardo. He also undertook French parts in new productions of &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; and &quot;Werther&quot;. He sang at a number of historic nights at the Met including: the closing gala at the old Met, the concert honoring Sir Rudolf Bing&#x27;s retirement, and Callas&#x27;s legendary comeback Tosca. His last performance at the Met was on 28 December 1974 as Calàf with Ingrid Bjoner, also singing her last performance at the Met, as Turandot. However, Corelli did tour extensively with the Metropolitan Opera in 1975, singing in performances in cities throughout the United States and in Japan.

While singing at the Met, Corelli continued to be a presence on the international stage. In 1961 he made his debut with the Deutsche Oper Berlin. He returned to La Scala in 1962, for a revival of Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;, opposite Joan Sutherland, and that same year appeared as Manrico in a lauded production of &quot;Il trovatore&quot; at the Salzburg Festival under Herbert von Karajan and opposite Leontyne Price, Giulietta Simionato, and Ettore Bastianini. Also in 1962 he made his first appearance with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company as Mario Cavaradossi. He returned to Philadelphia almost every year through 1971 portraying close to a dozen different roles. He made his debut at the Paris Opéra in 1964 opposite Callas in Tosca and Norma. He also earned high acclaim while collaborating with the Italian-American conductor Alfredo Antonini in several gala concerts in New York during the mid 1960s.

In the early 1970s, Corelli&#x27;s voice began to show some signs of wear after years of hard use in a demanding repertory. As a result, the resultant nerves surrounding performances became increasingly difficult to handle for the tenor. He made his last opera appearance as Rodolfo in 1976 in Torre del Lago at the age of 55. Corelli later said of the decision, &quot;I felt that my voice was a little tired, a little opaque, less brilliant than before. The singer&#x27;s life cost me a great deal. I was full of apprehension and mad at everyone. I was a bundle of nerves, I wasn&#x27;t eating or sleeping.&quot;

===Later life: 1976–2003===
After retiring from the stage, Corelli became a popular voice teacher in New York City, somewhat ironic for a man who himself disdained voice teachers for much of his life. He was briefly coaxed out of retirement for concerts in 1980 and 1981. He died in Milan 29 October 2003, aged 82, after suffering a stroke earlier that year, and was buried in Milan&#x27;s Cimitero Monumentale.

===Critical reception===
With a rich and ringing spinto tenor voice and movie-star good looks, Corelli won a wide public following from early on his career. However, while the public was enthralled with the tenor, music critics were divided, with some complaining about what they perceived as self-indulgence of phrasing and expression. During the 1960s the anti-Corelli sentiment was epitomized by Alan Rich of &quot;The New York Herald Tribune&quot; in a 1966 article which, while acknowledged the vibrancy and white heat of his singing, considered Corelli a throwback. Rich said that Corelli is &quot;not employed by an opera, but employs it to serve purposes it was not meant to serve.&quot; Also, many critics did not look favourably on his performances in French opera, owing to the tenor&#x27;s exotic French diction and style. However, Corelli also had his admirers among several highly respected and notable critics, including Harold C. Schonberg of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who once defended the expressive liberties taken by Corelli saying that his performance possessed &quot;its own kind of logic&quot;.

==Repertoire==
==Selected recordings==
Corelli made many recordings of solo arias and complete operas. These reveal the splendour of Corelli&#x27;s voice in its prime during the late 1950s and 1960s. Many admirers prefer recordings of his live performances, finding Corelli&#x27;s singing in front of an audience more exciting than his studio performances. Many of these are available.

<text>The island of Ireland, comprising Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, has an extensive network of tens of thousands of kilometres of public roads, usually surfaced. These roads have been developed and modernised over centuries, from trackways suitable only for walkers and horses, to surfaced roads including modern motorways. Driving is on the left-hand side of the road. The major routes were established before Irish independence and consequently take little cognisance of the border other than a change of identification number and street furniture. Northern Ireland has had motorways since 1962, and has a well-developed network of primary, secondary and local routes. The Republic started work on its motorway network in the early 1980s; and historically, the road network there was once somewhat less well developed. However, the Celtic Tiger economic boom and an influx of European Union structural funding, saw national roads and regional roads in the Republic come up to international standard quite quickly. In the mid-1990s, for example, the Republic went from having only a few short sections of motorway to a network of motorways, dual carriageways and other improvements on most major routes as part of a National Development Plan. Road construction in Northern Ireland now tends to proceed at a slower pace than in the Republic, although a number of important bypasses and upgrades to dual carriageway have recently been completed or are about to begin.

Roads in Northern Ireland are classified as either Highways, motorways (shown by the letter &quot;M&quot; followed by a route number, e.g. M1), A-roads (shown by the letter &quot;A&quot; followed by a route number, e.g. A6), B-roads (shown by the letter &quot;B&quot; followed by a route number, e.g. B135) and other roads. There are two types of A-roads: primary and non-primary.

Roads in the Republic are classified as motorways (shown by the letter &quot;M&quot; followed by a route number, e.g. M7), national roads (shown by the letter &quot;N&quot; followed by a route number, e.g. N25), regional roads (shown by the letter &quot;R&quot; followed by a route number, e.g. R611) and local roads (shown by the letter &quot;L&quot; followed by a route number, e.g. L4202). There are two types of national roads: national primary routes and national secondary routes.

Road signs in Northern Ireland follow the same design rules as the rest of the United Kingdom. Distance signposts in Northern Ireland show distances in miles, while all signposts placed in the Republic since the 1990s use kilometres. The Republic&#x27;s road signs are generally bilingual, using both official languages, Irish and English. However, signs in the Gaeltacht (Irish speaking areas) use only Irish. The Irish language names are written in italic script, the English in capitals. Signs in Northern Ireland are in English only. Warning signs in the Republic have a yellow background and are diamond-shaped, those in Northern Ireland are triangle-shaped and have a white background with a red border.

Speed limits in Northern Ireland are specified in miles per hour. Those in the Republic use kilometres per hour (km/h), a change introduced on 20 January 2005. This involved the provision of 58,000 new metric speed limit signs, replacing and supplementing 35,000 imperial signs.

==History==

There have been routes and trackways in Ireland connecting settlements and facilitating trade since ancient times. Ireland was never part of the Roman Empire and, therefore, Roman roads were not built in Ireland. However, an Iron Age road with a stone surface has been excavated in Munster and togher () roads, a type of causeway built through bogs, were found in many areas of the country.

According to an entry in the Annals of the Four Masters for AD 123, there were five principal highways () leading to Tara () in Early Medieval Ireland.

Early medieval law-tracts set out five types of road including the highway (&quot;slighe&quot;), the &#x27;[regional] main road&#x27; (&quot;ród&quot; or &quot;rout&quot;), the &#x27;connecting road&#x27; (&quot;lámraite&quot;), the &#x27;side road&#x27; (&quot;tógraite&quot;) which could be tolled, and the &#x27;cow road&#x27; (&quot;bóthar&quot;). &quot;Bóthar&quot; is the most common term for &#x27;road&#x27; in modern Irish: its diminutive form, &quot;bóithrín&quot;, (or boreen in English) is used as a term for very narrow, rural roads.

The development of roads in Ireland seemed to have stagnated until the eighteenth- and early nineteenth-centuries. However, in the 18th century, a network of turnpike roads (charging tolls) was built: &quot;a turnpike was a primitive form of turnstile – a gate across the road, opened on payment of a toll. The average length of a turnpike road was 30 miles&quot;. Routes to and from Dublin were developed initially and the network spread throughout the country. Turnpikes operated between 1729 and 1858 when the extensive railway network made them increasingly unpopular.

Specialist routes to facilitate the butter trade, which centred on Cork, were built in Munster. The first &quot;butter road&quot; was commissioned in 1748 and was built by John Murphy of Castleisland in County Kerry. In other areas, notably in County Wicklow, military roads were built to help secure British military control over remote areas. The Military Road through County Wicklow was begun in 1800 and completed in 1809. The R115 is part of the Military Road for its entire length.

Railways became the dominant form of land transport from the mid-19th century. This situation persisted until the first half of the 20th century when motorised road transport (cars, buses and trucks) gradually began to take over from railways as the most important form of land transport.

Pre-independence legislation (the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919) laid the foundation for the regulation of the modern system of public roads in Ireland. The Act gave the Minister for Local Government the power to classify roads: Trunk Road Funds were used to enable local councils to improve major roads and road surfacing was gradually undertaken throughout the 1920s, 1930s and beyond.

By the 1950s an established system of road classification and numbering with Trunk Roads and Link Roads had long been developed. The present system of road classification and numbering began in 1977 when twenty-five National primary roads and thirty-three National secondary roads were designated.

Regional roads were first formally designated in 1994, although Regional road route-numbers began appearing on signposts in the 1980s. The Roads Act 1993 also classified all public roads which are not national or regional roads as local roads.

==Roads in the Republic of Ireland==

The Republic has an extensive network of public roads connecting all parts of the country.
As of 31 December 2013, there was a total of of national roads: of which were national primary routes (including motorways) and were national secondary routes.

By May 2018 Network Lengths were as follows.

National Primary Roads (including motorways) 

National Secondary Roads 

&quot;Total National Road N (and M) Network &quot;

In addition to national roads, the Republic also has an extensive network of other public roads: there are:

 of Regional Roads R and
 of Local L roads.

Local Roads are broken into three classes,

Local Primary (LP) ,
Local Secondary (LS) and
Local Tertiary LT 

For a combined public road network length of in 2018

The Republic&#x27;s major road network is focused on Dublin. Motorways were extended from Dublin to other major cities as part of the Transport 21 programme which aimed to have a world-class motorway network in place by the end of 2010. At that time, Ireland&#x27;s main cities (Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Belfast) excluding Derry were connected to Dublin with motorways or with near-motorway standard roads. Dublin was the focus of some other major projects, such as the East-Link and West-Link toll-bridges, as well as the Dublin Port Tunnel. Major by-pass projects were also built around other cities and towns. The Jack Lynch Tunnel under the River Lee in Cork was a major project outside Dublin, and a fourth crossing at Limerick under the River Shannon (known as the Limerick Tunnel) opened in 2010.

The different classes of roads in Ireland are allocated blocks of numbers so that no number is used more than once save in the case of Local Primary Roads.(not all road numbers are currently in use):
* National Primary Roads are numbered from N1 to N50 (motorway sections are signed with M prefix instead of N ).
* National Secondary Roads are numbered from N51 to N99.
* Regional Roads are numbered from R100 to R999.
* Local Primary Roads are numbered from L1000 to L4999.
* Local Secondary Roads are numbered from L5000 to L8999.
* Local Tertiary Roads are numbered from L10001 to L89999 with the first 4 digits representing the Local Primary or Secondary road it starts off from. Local Tertiary roads which are unrelated to a Local Primary or Secondary road are given numbers from L90000 up.

===Motorways===

In the Republic of Ireland, a motorway forms part of a national primary route, but is indicated by the prefix M instead of N. Motorways are the highest standard roads and certain drivers and vehicles are prohibited from using them. The motorway network has been expanded extensively since the 1990s, through construction of new motorways and redesignation of existing motorway-standard dual-carriageway sections of National Primary routes.

The first motorway section in the state was the M7 Naas by-pass, which opened in 1983. Since 2009, all motorways in Ireland are part of, or form, &quot;national primary roads&quot;. At the end of 2004 there were of motorway in the Republic and of dual-carriageway. This was extended, by the end of 2005, to of motorway and of dual-carriageway. By the end of December 2009 there were of motorway in Ireland, with under construction at the time.

As of 2019, the following motorway routes are in operation:
* M1, part of the DublinBelfast route: from M50 J3 at Dublin Airport to Thistle Cross (just north of Dundalk), where it reverts to the N1 numbering as a dual carriageway up to the border with Northern Ireland, where it continues without interruption as the A1 dual carriageway to a junction with Northern Ireland&#x27;s M1 and on to Belfast.
* M2, part of the DublinDerry/Letterkenny route: from just north of M50 J5 to just north of Ashbourne, County Meath, (where it reverts to a single-carriageway road (N2) as far as the border, then continues as the A5 to Derry or recrosses the border to become the N14 to Letterkenny).
* M3, part of the DublinCavan/Enniskillen/Donegal route: from Clonee (on N3 from M50 J6) to Kells bypass. The route continues as the N3 as far as the border, then becomes the A509 to Enniskillen, whereupon it is renumbered the A46 to the border at Belleek and resumes its N3 identity as far as Ballyshannon on the N15 SligoDonegal road.
* M4, part of the DublinSligo route: from Lucan (on N4 from M50 J7) to Kinnegad at which point it reverts to dual carriageway to (bypass) Mullingar.
* M6, part of the DublinGalway route: leaves M4 at J11 near Kinnegad, ending at the R381 crossing where it reverts to the N6 dual carriageway around Galway. The section around Athlone reverts to N6 status as it is an all-traffic dual carriageway. This was the first city-to-city motorway link in Ireland. Opened in January 2010.
* M7, part of the DublinLimerick route: begins at the Naas bypass at the end of the N7 Naas Road dual carriageway from M50 J9 and continues to Rossbrien outside Limerick where the motorway forms an interchange with the N18 &amp; M20 routes at junction 30.
* M8, part of the DublinCork route: branches off the M7 at junction 19 and continues to the Dunkettle interchange outside Cork where it forms an interchange with the N25 and N40 routes.
* M9, part of the DublinWaterford route: branches off the M7 at junction 11 and continues towards the Quarry Roundabout outside Waterford where it forms a junction with the N24.
* M11, two separate parts of the DublinWexford route: the southern tip of the M50 to the west side of Bray and from Coyne&#x27;s Cross to just north of Oilgate.
* M17, part of the GalwaySligo route: begins at junction 18 on the M6 and continues to a terminus roundabout on the outskirts of Tuam. Continues northbound towards Sligo as the N17.
* M18, part of the Limerick Ennis – Galway route: begins at junction 9 for Shannon Airport from the N18 dual carriageway from the Rossbrien Interchange in Limerick and continues to junction 18 with a junction on the M6 for Galway.
* M20, part of the CorkLimerick route: branches off the M7 at junction 30 and the N18 at junction 1 at the Rossbrien interchange outside Limerick and continues for towards Attyflin near Patrickswell at junction 4. Here the route forms an interchange with the N20 towards Cork and the N21 to Tralee &amp; Killarney. Both the N20 &amp; N21 from here are single carriageway.
* M50, C – shaped ring road that forms a bypass of Dublin. The motorway connects to all the national primary routes from Dublin to the main cities and regions of Ireland as well as Dublin City centre.

In June 2007, it was announced that around of &#x27;new&#x27; motorway would be created; however, much of this resulted from the re-classification of most of the country&#x27;s high-quality dual carriageways to motorway regulations rather than the construction of purpose-built motorways. This affected most of the major inter-urban routes between Dublin and various towns and cities and some of the Atlantic Corridor along the Western seaboard.

====Planned motorways====
* M20; Completion of the upgrading of the N20 route between Cork and Limerick to motorway standard. This will extend the existing section of M20 outside Limerick to Cork.

By 2015, TII planned that there would be approximately of motorway in Ireland, comprising the M50 (), M20 ( approx), M18 ( approx), M17 (), M11 (), M9 (), M8 (), M7 (), M6 (), M4 (), M3 (), M2 (), and M1 (). However the Irish financial crisis brought this target into question.

===National primary roads===
National Primary routes form the main cross country roads in Ireland and include all motorways. This category of road is numbered from 1–50 with the prefix &quot;N&quot; (or &quot;M&quot; for motorway sections). The routes numbered N1-N11 radiate anti-clockwise from Dublin, with those in the range N12-N26 being cross-country roads and N27-N33 being newer short link roads. The N40 is the Cork Ring Road and the N50 is the Dublin Ring Road. National secondary roads (see next section) are numbered under the same scheme with higher numbers. On road signage, destinations served but not on the route in question are listed in brackets, with the connecting route also listed (see thumbnail).

Northern Ireland route sections (which are classified separately according to NI schemes) are in some cases included in a theoretical complete cross-border route – for example the N3 route, which re-enters the Republic. These are listed here in brackets for completeness (and are present on southern road signage).


This list ignores the sections of route reclassified as motorway (see previous section).

===National secondary roads===


National secondary roads fill in the rest of the main cross country routes in Ireland. They connect large towns (such as Birr) which are not served by National Primary routes, and some routes (such as N59) follow long coastal route connecting many towns. They are indicated with a &quot;N&quot; prefix followed by a number from 51 to 99 (N87 is currently the highest).

There are of national secondary roads in Ireland, making up slightly less than 50% of the entire national route (national primary and national secondary) network. National secondary routes are generally more poorly maintained than primary routes (although their quality can vary widely), but often carry more traffic than regional roads. Almost the entire network of national secondary roads is single carriageway, although there are some short sections of dual carriageway on the Tallaght bypass section of the N81, on the N52 at Dundalk, on the N85 at Ennis, on the N62 at Athlone and on the N71 between Cork and Bandon. Typically, national secondary roads are of a similar standard or higher than regional roads although some are of lower quality than the better sections of regional roads. Many of them have been resurfaced with higher quality pavements in recent years with relatively smooth surfaces and good road markings and signposting. However, road widths and alignments are often inadequate, with many narrow and winding sections.

National secondary roads generally do not bypass towns on their routes although there are a number of exceptions: the N52 bypasses Nenagh, Mullingar and the centre of Dundalk (as a relief road) with a further N52 bypass of Tullamore planned, the N55 (along with the N3) bypasses Cavan, the N56 forms part of the Donegal bypass, the N61 and the N63 bypass Roscommon, the N71 bypasses Halfway and Skibbereen, the N74 bypasses Cashel, the N76 bypasses Callan, the N77 forms the northern part of the Kilkenny ring road, the N80 bypasses Carlow and the N85 bypasses Ennis. When the Fermoy (Moorepark) to Kilbehenny section of the M8 was completed, the former N8 bypass of Mitchelstown was re-classified as the N73.

Examples of national secondary roads are:
*N52 Dundalk via Mullingar and Birr to Nenagh joining M7 to Limerick
*N59 Galway – Clifden – Westport – Bangor Erris – Ballina – Ballysadare
*N62 Athlone – Horse and Jockey
*N74 Cashel – Golden – Tipperary Town
*N81 Dublin – Tullow
*N86 Tralee – Dingle via Lispole

===Alternative National roads===
Alternative National roads are regional roads which provide an alternative route to a national route. A large amount of national primary routes have been replaced by motorways, which certain drivers and vehicles are prohibited from using. These regional roads provide an alternative route to the motorway for these drivers. They are usually the former national road which was downgraded following the opening of the motorway. In 2010 new signage was introduced for alternative routes. They are signposted in black on a yellow background, instead of black on a white background for other regional roads. This new signage has been installed on most roads, being included when signage was replaced. Roads where the new signage has been installed include the R132 in Swords (alternative to M1), the R147 in Dunshaughlin (alternative to M3), the entire length of the R448 (alternative to M9), the R712 in Paulstown (alternative to N10) and the R772 from Rathnew to Arklow (alternative to M11).

===Regional roads===
Regional Roads fill in the rest of the main roads in Ireland. They connect many small towns to each other and to the national road network. There are over of regional roads. Regional roads are numbered with three digit route numbers, prefixed by &quot;R&quot; (e.g. R105). Route numbers range from R1xx in the north-east to R7xx in the south-east of the country, with newer short urban roads numbered R8xx and R9xx. They are signposted in black with a white background. Some of the more important regional roads such as the R136 Outer Orbital, Dublin and the R710 Waterford Outer Ring Road are dual-carriageway in whole or part. Most regional roads are however single carriageway roads, and many are rather narrow country roads.

Regional roads are subject to a general speed limit of or in built-up areas.

While funding for national primary roads is administered centrally by Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), regional and local roads are less well funded (although funding has increased in the 2000s). Local councils are responsible for these roads, as opposed to TII.

===Local roads===


All public roads which are not motorways, national roads or regional roads are local roads: &quot;a public road, other than a national road or a regional road, shall be a local road&quot;.

Local roads vary greatly in quality, from wide urban streets to very narrow, rural lanes, known as boreens in Ireland. There are three types of Local road: Local Primary (local roads wider than 4 metres (13&#x27;)), Local Secondary (local roads narrower than 4 metres (13&#x27;)) and Local Tertiary (cul-de-sacs and other minor roads).

Local roads are subject to a general speed limit of or in built-up areas. While this is the maximum speed allowed, drivers must adhere to the Road Traffic Act and drive with due care and attention and with regard to the road conditions.

Local roads are not generally referred to by number, but are registered with a four- or five-digit &quot;L&quot; number, taking the form Lxxxx. It used to be rare to see these numbers on signposts (and these numbers do not appear on Ordnance Survey maps), but in 2006 the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government began a programme of new signage for regional roads that incorporates local road numbers on directional signage (see thumbnails).

===Old system===

The Republic of Ireland had a different road numbering system prior to the introduction of the National Route numbering system.

Major roads were marked with &quot;T&quot; for Trunk Road, less important roads were marked with &quot;L&quot; for Link Road.

The first nine Trunk Roads (T1, T2, T3, T4, T4a, T5, T6, T7, T8) radiated out from Dublin (with the T8 branching off the T7 at Enniscorthy) and followed an anti-clockwise pattern. This pattern was similar to the existing anti-clockwise pattern which the routes radiating out of Dublin follow.

Unlike the present system, where each road (whether N- or R-) has a unique number, under the Trunk/Link system, the L-roads were numbered separately beginning with L1. These L (for Link Road) classifications are not related to the current Lxxxx numbers for Local Roads. Confusingly, some old road signs still show the former (now obsolete) road numbers.

Trunk Roads were broadly equivalent to the present National Roads, and Link Roads to the present Regional Roads. Most of the National Primary and National Secondary routes had been Trunk Roads and generally they followed the routes of these Trunk roads, albeit with a different numbering system. However, some National Primary and Secondary roads also incorporated Link Roads and unclassified roads into their routes. Furthermore, many Trunk Roads were downgraded to Regional roads, effectively &#x27;de-trunked&#x27;. Some newer National Primary routes were built as new roads in the 1990s and therefore did not incorporate former Trunk, Link or unclassified roads into their routes.

====Former major trunk roads in Ireland and current equivalents====

*T1 = Dublin – north of Dundalk (Belfast). Mainly present R132, old N1; largely replaced by M1
*T2 = Dublin – north of Monaghan (Derry). Mainly present N2 road

==Roads in Northern Ireland==

The main roads in Northern Ireland, which connect well with those in the Republic, are classified &quot;M&quot;/&quot;A&quot;/&quot;B&quot; as in Great Britain. Whereas the roads in Great Britain are numbered according to a zonal system, there is no available explanation for the allocation of road numbers in Northern Ireland, though their numbering is separate from the system in England, Scotland and Wales.

==European routes==
The following European routes include sections in Ireland:

*E1 – Larne – Belfast – Dublin – Rosslare – A Coruña – Pontevedra – Valença do Minho – Vila Real de Santo António – Huelva – Sevilla

<doc id="353109" wikidata="Q15526726" url="?curid=353109" title="Benjamin Waugh">
<text>Benjamin Waugh (20 February 183911 March 1908) was a Victorian era social reformer and campaigner who founded and directed the UK charity, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) in the late 19th century. He was also a journalist, public speaker and organiser who helped secure Britain’s first legislation on children’s rights.

==Early life==
Waugh was born in Settle, West Riding of Yorkshire. Aged eight, he was affected by the death of his mother and soon afterwards his father sent him to a private school in Warwickshire run by his maternal uncle, a Congregational minister. When 14, he was apprenticed to Samuel Boothroyd, a draper and member of the Congregational Church in Southport, Lancashire. By the age of 20, Waugh had become secretary of the local branch of the United Kingdom Alliance, a leading temperance organisation. His religious conviction led to him giving up the drapery business while remaining friendly with his former employer whose daughter Sarah later became his wife. Between 1862 and 1865, he studied at the Congregationalist Airedale Theological College in Bradford and on graduation, married Sarah Boothroyd with whom he moved to Newbury, near Reading, as minister to the local Congregational church. Both politically liberal and a non-fundamentalist, he became a Fellow of the Geological Society in 1865. A year later, he accepted the pastorate of the Independent Chapel at Maze Hill in Greenwich.

==Early career==
As a Congregational minister in poverty-stricken East Greenwich, Waugh devoted himself to improving the conditions of the inhabitants, including establishing a creche for working mothers and a Society for Temporary Relief in Poverty and Sickness. In 1870, John Stuart Mill and four trade unions nominated him as a candidate in the election to represent Greenwich on the new London School Board; when elected he argued for non-sectarian elementary education. Befriending fellow Board member Thomas Huxley, he learnt from Huxley the importance of factual investigation during his subsequent campaigns on behalf of neglected children. The first of these concerned the incarceration of child offenders in adult prisons, and Waugh became widely known for his book, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Gaol Cradle, Who Rocks it?&quot; that pleaded against child imprisonment and for the creation of juvenile courts. The year following its publication he collapsed from over-work but despite thereafter declining re-election to a third three-year term on the School Board, continued to do too much.

== &quot;The Sunday Magazine&quot; ==
After another breakdown in 1877, he resigned his ministry in Greenwich on medical advice and accepted an offer by the publisher Isbister to edit the widely-circulated monthly periodical, &quot;The Sunday Magazine&quot;. It attracted contributions from numerous well-known writers, including novelist Hesba Stretton who helped found what later was to become the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Waugh also contributed poems and articles to the magazine. His monthly stories &#x27;Sunday Evenings with My Children&#x27; were later published in book form.

==National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children==
In 1884, at the suggestion of Hesba Stretton he brought together a number of leading philanthropists to found the London Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (modelled on a similar initiative in Liverpool), launched at London&#x27;s Mansion House on 8 July. The London body&#x27;s first chairman was veteran social reformer, Lord Shaftesbury. The Society evolved to become the NSPCC some five years later (14 May 1889), with Waugh as its honorary director and Queen Victoria as patron. Under Waugh&#x27;s leadership and guidance, 200 local NSPCC branches were created across the UK to campaign for children to be protected from harm, neglect and abuse. Local groups raised funds for the NSPCC, funding a body of inspectors to investigate and prevent cruelty to children. Many of the fund-raisers were middle-class women who, according to social historian George Behlmer, were ‘left no room for doubt on the subject of female duty&#x27;. Its women supporters had to postpone fighting for their own rights until ‘the citizenship and rights of children are established’.

Waugh supported the agitation of his friend W. T. Stead against ‘white slavery’ in 1885. He was also instrumental in inserting a provision into the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 allowing law courts to accept as evidence the testimony of children too young to understand the meaning of an oath. Waugh afterwards played leading role in securing the landmark Anti-Cruelty Act 1889, popularly known as the &#x27;Children&#x27;s Charter&#x27;, which allowed a child to be taken from abusive parents. Waugh&#x27;s achievements led to criticism and in 1896 the &quot;Echo&quot; newspaper accused him of financial mismanagement along with a strong personal attack.

&#x27;Mr. Waugh declares that he is above all committees, He initiates expenditure, gives orders, buys houses, starts shelters, takes and dismisses officials without asking permission from committees. The N.S.P.C.C.is virtually a one-man society&#x27;.

Lord Herschell&#x27;s subsequent independent review of the NSPCC management dismissed the slanders, found that the NSPCC had not been financially mismanaged and made some sensible recommendations about tightening up the administration that he concluded was fundamentally sound. And although Herschell found that Benjamin Waugh sometimes used too vehement and impetuous language, &quot;It was rare for the zeal and enthusiasm to promote a great cause... [to be] combined with a philosophic calm&quot;. 

Waugh was so dedicated to the Society that he refused to take a salary for the first 11 years, relying solely on the income from editing the &quot;Sunday Magazine&quot; which he eventually gave up in 1895. By early 1904, he was so worn out from over-work that his doctor insisted he take a complete break in the form of a six-month ocean voyage. Although he returned to work in August that year, ill-health compelled him to resign from the NSPCC in March 1905 and he died three years later while visiting Southend-on-Sea, where he is buried in the borough cemetery in Sutton Road.

==Family and homes==
With his wife Sarah, Waugh had 11 children (three of whom died in infancy) including his daughters Edna, who would become a notable watercolour artist and Rosa, his biographer and who would follow in his footsteps as a social activist.

When Congregational minister in Greenwich, Waugh lived at Croom&#x27;s Hill in Greenwich, and at 53 Woodlands Villas (today Vanbrugh Park) in neighbouring Blackheath. In 1879, the family moved to Oak Cottage in Shipbourne, Kent from where they moved in 1881 to 33 The Green, Southgate. In 1888, the family moved to 33 Hatfield Road in St Albans that Waugh named Otterleigh after his mother&#x27;s birthplace in Yorkshire. In 1902 they settled in Bedford Park, Chiswick until his retirement in 1905 after which he and Sarah moved to Weybridge. 

A blue plaque marks the site of the house in Southgate and at what was mistakenly believed to be that of Waugh&#x27;s residence on Croom&#x27;s Hill when it was installed in 1984 by the Greater London Council. English Heritage, the successor authority responsible for blue plaques correctly identifies Waugh&#x27;s former home as 62 Croom&#x27;s Hill.

<text>The Chittagong Hill Tracts (), often shortened to simply the Hill Tracts and abbreviated to CHT, refers to the three hilly districts within the Chittagong Division in southeastern Bangladesh, bordering India and Myanmar (Burma) in the east: Khagrachhari, Rangamati, and Bandarban. Covering , CHT is a extensively hilly area and home to a variety of tribal peoples in Bangladesh. The CHT were divided by the British in the 19th century into three tribal chieftaincies, the Chakma Circle, the Mong Circle and the Bohmong Circle. They formed a single district until 1984, when they were divided into three separate districts.

==Geography==
The Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) is a extensive hilly area in Bangladesh, lie in the southeastern part of the country (210 25&#x27; N to 230 45&#x27; N latitude and 910 54&#x27; E to 920 50&#x27; E longitude) bordering the Indian state of Tripura on the north, 
Rakhine State of Myanmar on the south, Chin state of Myanmar and Indian state Mizoram on the east, Chittagong District and Cox&#x27;s Bazar District on the west. The area of the Chittagong Hill Tracts is about 13,184 km2, which is approximately one-tenth of the total area of Bangladesh. The Chittagong Hill Tracts combine three hilly districts of Bangladesh: Rangamati, Khagrachhari and Bandarban districts.

The mountainous rugged terrain with deep forests, lakes and falls gives it a different character from the rest of Bangladesh.
Karnaphuli River, Sangu River are the main river of CHT.

Saka Haphong, the highest peak of Bangladesh, is located here. Though officially Tazing Dong is declared as the highest peak, it is also located here. Keokradong is another famous peak in this area.

==History==
It has been a warzone between the Arakan Kingdom, Chakma kingdom and the Twipra Kingdom.

In the early 13th century the Chakma people settled from Arakan (Burma) before the Mughal and Bengali people settlement, due to defeat from the Rakhine king. The Chakmas are the single largest indigenous group, comprising half of the indigenous population. The Marma people are the second largest tribe. They came from Burma when Arakan was conquered by Burmese king Bodawpaya. The place was ruled by the Chakma king there was a conflict between the Chakma king and Mughals in which the Chakma king agreed to pay tribute of cotton to the Mughals.

Mughal and early British records name the region &quot;Jum Bungoo&quot;, &quot;Jum mahal&quot; or &quot;Kapas mahal&quot;. In 1787, the East India Company made the region its tributary after battling Chakma raja and agreeing on peace treaty.

Under British control, the British East India Company in order to suppress the Chakma queen power Kalindi Rani divided the hills into three parts. This was done in regional areas known as Chakma Circle, Mong Circle, and Bohmong Circle. The early colonial history of the Chittagong Hill Tracts is a record of recurring raids by the eastern hill indigenous (Mizo or Lushai) and of the operations undertaken by the British to repress them.

===British rule===
The use of the name &quot;Chittagong&quot; for this area dates to the 1860 British annexation of the region, bringing it under the direct control of British India. Situated beyond the inland hills, Chittagong proper is a coastal area in the plains where the British were based. As colonial influence grew, &quot;Chittagong&quot; enlarged as well, expanding eastwards to subsume the Hill Tracts under its revenue-collection territory.

The recorded population increased from 69,607 in 1872 to 101,597 in 1881, to 107,286 in 1891, and to 124,762 in 1901. The census of 1872 was, however, very imperfect, and the actual population growth probably did not exceed what might be expected in a sparsely inhabited but fairly healthy tract.

When the 1901 census was taken there were no towns, and 211 of the villages had populations of less than 500 apiece; only one exceeded 2,000. The population density, excluding the area of uninhabited forest (1,385 square miles), was 33 persons per square mile. There was a little immigration from Chittagong, and a few persons had emigrated to Tripura. The proportion of females to every 100 males was only 90 in the district-born and 83 in the total population. 
That time Buddhists numbered 100,000, Hindus 50,000, and Muslims 3,000.

===End of British rule===
===Conflict===
==Land use and environment==

===Tobacco cultivation===
Tobacco cultivation is damaging the ecology of the area, with the loss of indigenous trees such as &quot;Chukrasia tabularis&quot; (Indian mahogany), and soil fertility.

Most of the farmers of Rangamati, Bandarban, and Khagrachhari have been losing their interest in cultivating their own indigenous crops after defaulting on loans provided by tobacco companies.

===Environmental issues===
Like other mountainous areas in South and Southeast Asia, the Chittagong Hill Tracts are undergoing deforestation and land degradation arising from environmentally unsuitable activities such as tobacco cultivation in sloping land, shifting cultivation and logging. Shifting cultivation, also known as slash-and-burn agriculture or swidden cultivation, embraces a large variety of primitive forms of agriculture. It is a unique stage in the evolution from hunting and food gathering to sedentary farming. Humankind began to change its mode of life from food gatherer to food producer about 7000 B.C. by adopting shifting cultivation. Some form of shifting cultivation has been practised in most parts of the world, but more intensive forms of agriculture have subsequently replaced it.
The present shifting cultivation system with short fallow periods in the Chittagong Hill Tracts has accelerated erosion, land degradation, deforestation, and impoverishment of tribal people in CHT. If the present state of degradation is continued, most of the areas under shifting cultivation will be severely degraded and future generations will face more difficulties in eking out their livelihoods on further degraded land, although there is some scope for shifting cultivators to leave the degraded fields and move to other areas. It is estimated that on average eight hectares of land is necessary for the sustenance of a family in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. If this ratio is adopted, 1,240,000 ha land is required to sustain the present population; however, the total land available, excluding the reserve forest, is 928,000 ha. Shifting cultivation, therefore, cannot fulfill even the subsistence requirements of the people. In such a situation, either large non-farm employment opportunities need to be created or more productive land-use systems need to be developed and adopted. Given the sluggish growth of the economy, there is limited scope for generating adequate non-farming employment opportunities in the near future. It is, therefore, imperative to replace the present shifting cultivation system with more productive and sustainable land use systems to enable people to secure their livelihoods.

<text>Ksar or qṣar (), in plural ksour or qsour (), is a type of fortified village in North Africa, usually found in the regions predominantly or traditionally inhabited by Berbers (Amazigh). The equivalent Berber term used is &quot;&quot; (singular) or (plural).

== Etymology ==
The Arabic &quot;qaṣr&quot; () was probably borrowed from the Latin word .

== Architecture ==
Ksour in the Maghreb typically consist of attached houses, often having a fortified communal granary like those in Algeria, or the ghorfa and agadir types known in Tunisia and Morocco respectively, beside other structures like a mosque, hammam, oven, and shops. Ksur or igherman are widespread among the oasis populations of North Africa. Ksars are sometimes situated in mountain locations to make defense easier; they often are entirely within a single, continuous wall. The building material of the entire structure usually is adobe, or cut stone and adobe. The idea of the ksar as a granary is a confused notion of two things: the granary itself, found within a ksar, and the ksar, a village, typically with granaries within it. Ksars form one of the main manifestations of Berber architecture.

<text>Albert Toft (3 June 1862 – 18 December 1949) was a British sculptor.

Toft&#x27;s career was dominated by public commemorative commissions in bronze, mostly single statues of military or royal figures. The Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897, Boer War to 1902, and then World War I to 1918, provided plentiful commissions. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; describes Toft as one of the major figures of the &quot;New Sculpture&quot; movement following on from William Hamo Thornycroft and George Frampton. Toft described his work as &#x27;Idealist&#x27; but he also said of himself that &quot;to become an idealist you must necessarily first be a realist.&quot;

His father was a notable modeller in ceramics, and his brother was the landscape artist Joseph Alfonso Toft.

==Biography==
Toft was born in Handsworth, then in Staffordshire, and now a suburb of Birmingham. His parents were Charles Toft (1832–1909) and Rosanna Reeves. His father was a senior modeller at Mintons, and then the chief modeller at Wedgwood pottery. He had also taught modelling at Birmingham School of Art for some years to 1873.

Toft trained at Wedgwood, and attended art schools in Hanley, Staffordshire and Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1881 he won a scholarship to study sculpture at the South Kensington Schools under Professor Édouard Lantéri. He received silver medals in his second and third years.

From 1885 onwards Toft exhibited at the Royal Academy and some of his most notable works exhibited at the Royal Academy included &quot;Fate-Led&quot; (1890, now at Walker Art Gallery), &quot;The Sere and Yellow Leaf&quot; (1892), &quot;Spring&quot; (1897, now at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery), &quot;The Spirit of Contemplation&quot; (1901; Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle) and &quot;The Metal Pourer&quot; (1915). In 1915 his sculpture &quot;The Bather&quot; was purchased using the Royal Academy&#x27;s Chantrey Fund. His 1888 bust of William Ewart Gladstone for the National Liberal Club was modelled from life and acclaimed as one of the best. In 1900 Toft received a bronze medal at the Universal Exhibition in Paris.

He created monuments to Queen Victoria for Leamington Spa, Nottingham, and South Shields, and to Edward VII in Birmingham and Warwick. He designed the coronation medal of George V and Queen Mary (1911) and a statuette of W. S. Penley playing Charley&#x27;s Aunt for Royal Doulton (1913). He also published a book, &quot;Modelling and Sculpture&quot; in 1911, which was reprinted in 1949.

He made a series of war memorials, starting with the South African War Memorial in Cardiff (1910), and then many after the First World War, including the Royal Fusiliers War Memorial in London (1922), and four statues for the Birmingham Hall of Memory (1923–24).

In 1891 Toft was elected to the Art Workers Guild and in 1938 he was elected a fellow to the Royal Society of British Sculptors.

He died in Worthing.

<text>Redruth ( , ) is a town and civil parish in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. According to the 2011 census, the population of Redruth was 14,018 In the same year the population of the Camborne-Redruth urban area, which also includes Carn Brea, Illogan and several outlying villages, stood at 55,400 which made it the largest conurbation in Cornwall. Redruth lies approximately at the junction of the A393 and A3047 roads, on the route of the old London to Land&#x27;s End trunk road (now the A30), and is approximately west of Truro, east of St Ives, north east of Penzance and north west of Falmouth. Camborne and Redruth together form the largest urban area in Cornwall and before local government reorganisation were an urban district.

==Toponymy==
The name Redruth derives from its older Cornish name, &quot;Rhyd-ruth&quot;. It means Red Ford (literally ford-red). The first syllable &#x27;red&#x27; means ford. The second &#x27;ruth&#x27; means red.

&quot;Rhyd&quot; is the older form of &#x27;Res&#x27;, which is a Cornish equivalent to a ford (across a river), a common Celtic word; Old Cornish &quot;rid&quot;; Welsh &quot;rhyd&quot; (Old Welsh &quot;rit&quot;); Old Breton &quot;rit&quot; or &quot;ret&quot;, Gaulish &quot;ritu-&quot;, all from Indo-European &quot;*prtus&quot; derived word in &quot;-tu&quot; from the root *per &quot; to cross, to go through &quot;; Proto-Germanic &quot;*furdúz&quot; (English ford, German &quot;Furt&quot;); Latin &quot;portus&quot;, all related to the Celtic word.

Again, it is the &quot;-ruth&quot; (and not the &quot;Red-&quot; part of the name) which means the colour red.

Beroul&#x27;s &quot;Roman de Tristan&quot; features a location in Cornwall called &quot;Crois Rouge&quot; in Norman French or &#x27;red cross&#x27; in English.

==History==
Traditionally in the Penwith Hundred, the town has developed away from the original settlement, which was near where the present Churchtown (around St. Euny&#x27;s Church) district of Redruth stands today. This location is a steeply wooded valley, with Carn Brea on one side and the now-called Bullers Hill on the other. The presence of shallow lodes of tin and copper lying east to west made it an advantageous site for extracting metals, including, tin, lead and copper. The first settlers stayed by a crossing in the river and started extracting metal ores, and this process turned the colour of the river red.

Historically, Redruth was a small market town overshadowed by its neighbours until a boom in the demand for copper ore during the 18th century. Copper ore had mostly been discarded by the Cornish tin-mining industry but was now needed to make brass, an essential metal in the Industrial Revolution. Surrounded by copper ore deposits, Redruth quickly became one of the largest and richest mining areas in Britain and the town&#x27;s population grew markedly, although most miners&#x27; families remained poor.

In the 1880s and 1890s the town end of Clinton Road gained a number of institutions, notably a School of Mines and Art School in 1882–83, St. Andrew&#x27;s Church (replacing the chapel in Chapel Street) in 1883 and, opposite, the Free Library, built in 1895. The Mining Exchange was built in 1880 as a place for the trading of mineral stock.

By the end of the 19th century, the Cornish mining industry was in decline and Britain was importing most of its copper ore. To find employment, many miners emigrated to the newer mining industries in the Americas, Pachuca, Mexico, Australasia and South Africa. By the turn of the 20th century, Victoria Park had been laid out to commemorate the Golden Jubilee and this part of town had taken on its present appearance – a far cry from the jumble of mining activity that had taken place there in the early 19th century. Redruth was making its transition from a market town dominated by mines and industry to a residential centre. Cornwall&#x27;s last fully operational mine, South Crofty at Pool between Redruth and Camborne, closed in March 1998.

==Governance==

===Parliamentary representation===
The Camborne and Redruth constituency was created for the 2010 general election, following a review of parliamentary representation in Cornwall by the Boundary Commission for England, which increased the number of seats in the county from five to six.
It is primarily a successor to the former Falmouth and Camborne seat.

In the 2024 United Kingdom general election the results were:





===Local government===
Redruth until the late 1800s comprised the Redruth Urban District and Redruth Rural District. The urban district was merged with that of Camborne and parts of Redruth Rural District and Helston Rural District (both of which were being abolished) in 1934 to form the Camborne-Redruth Urban District. The urban district persisted until it was merged into the Kerrier district of Cornwall under the Local Government Act 1972. Redruth is represented on Cornwall Council by three wards: Redruth Central, Redruth North and Redruth South.

====Town Council====
The composition of Redruth Town Council as of August 2024:
==Education==

Redruth School, a Technology College, is a secondary school, for ages 11–16. It used to have a sixth form, for students aged 11 to 16, however, it closed applications for new students in 2016 and officially closed in 2020 due to funding cuts.
The town used to have a coeducational independent school, Highfields Private School, but it closed in 2012.

Primary schools within the town include Pennoweth School, Treleigh School, Treloweth Community Primary School, Trewirgie Infant School and Trewirgie Junior School.

The Curnow Community Special School caters for students with special needs.

The Passmore Edwards Free Library was built in 1894. Its architect was James Hicks who used a castellated baronial style; there is a prominent octagonal tower. The reading room was once the school of Thomas Collins, where Collins, who had been headmaster of Trewirgie School, taught local children and the children left behind by parents who had emigrated overseas.

==Notable buildings==
The Parish Church of St Uny, which is some distance from the town centre, is of Norman foundation but was rebuilt in 1756; it is grade II* listed. The patron saint is also honoured at Lelant. The tower is two centuries earlier and the whole church is built of granite. A chapel of ease was built in the town in 1828 but it is no longer in use. Other places of worship include the Wesleyan Church of 1826, the Free Methodist Church of 1864 (in grand Italianate style) and the Quaker Meeting House of 1833 (no longer in use).

The former post office in Alma Place is now the Redruth Civic Centre and home of Redruth Town Council, as well as the Redruth Library and Information Service.

The Mining Exchange building was used as a housing advice centre (it was built in 1880 as accommodation for share brokers).

The Old Courthouse, which once accommodated the local council, was completed in 1850.

===Murdoch House===

The house now called Murdoch (or, sometimes Murdock) House in the middle of Cross Street was erected in the 1660s as a chapel and it afterwards became a prison. William Murdoch lived in it from 1782 to 1798. During this time, he worked on local tin and copper mines, erecting engines on behalf of Boulton and Watt.
He fitted the house out with gas lighting from coal gas – this was the first house in the world with this type of lighting.

In the 19th century, the house was used as a tea room, run by a Mrs Knuckey. In 1931 Mr A. Pearce Jenkin, a leading citizen of Redruth purchased the house and gave it as a gift to the Society of Friends (Quakers).

Murdoch House has since been fully restored and is now regularly used by the Redruth Old Cornwall Society, as well as the Cornish-American Connection and the Redruth Story Group. Next door are St. Rumon&#x27;s Gardens.

===Kresen Kernow===
Kresen Kernow, on the site of Redruth Brewery, houses the archives and collections of the former Cornwall Records Office and Cornish Studies Library. It also holds a collection of Tregellas Tapestries which depict the history of Cornwall in embroidery.

===Tin Miner Statue===

A bronze sculpture of a Cornish miner by artist David Annand standing at 6 feet 7 inches was erected in April 2008.
The sculpture was commissioned by the Redruth Public Realm Working Party&#x27;s Mining Art Group in response to comments received during the consultation process, that the town did not have anything to represent the history of the men who worked down the tin and copper mines in the area.
David Annand was selected from over 70 artists who responded to an advert placed by Cornwall Arts Centre Trust, the project managers, for expressions of interest in August 2006.

==21st century==

Redruth is a small commercial town. It is twinned with Plumergat and Meriadec in Brittany, France, Mineral Point, Wisconsin in the United States, and Real del Monte in Mexico. A museum organised by the Old Cornwall Society is housed in the Town Council office at the bottom of the main street.

Redruth is also home to Carn Brea, which has most historical interest. The Carn, however, is not the highest point in Redruth; it is beaten slightly by Carnmenellis, south west of the town centre.

===Sport===
Redruth Rugby Football Club currently play in National League 2 South (tier 4 of rugby union in England). Players such as Phil Vickery and Rob Thirlby have both passed through its ranks though the club&#x27;s most famous &quot;son&quot; must be Richard Sharp OBE. A resident of Clinton Road with his mother and brother Nigel, he represented Redruth, Cornwall, and England, leading his country to the Five Nations title in 1963. Redruth football club has not enjoyed as much success but still thrives in its regular fixtures. On the high street there is a Tang Soo Do (Korean Karate) and Kickboxing Academy named ISK Martial Arts. Duchy Hockey Club are based at Pool Academy on the outskirts of Redruth and compete in the West of England regional leagues. Redruth Cricket Club currently consists of 4 Men&#x27;s playing XIs, one women&#x27;s XI and multiple youth sides. Redruth First XI play in the Cornwall Cricket League ECB Premier League, coming second in the 2019 season. The Second XI placed second in County League One, the second division of Cornish Cricket, in the same year.

===Performing arts===
Actress Kristin Scott Thomas, electronic musician Luke Vibert, baritone Benjamin Luxon, opera singer Alan Opie, record producer and broadcaster Tris Penna, and the co founder of and drummer with Fleetwood Mac, Mick Fleetwood, were all born here. The writer and comedian Rory McGrath was born here and educated at the town&#x27;s secondary school, Cornish artist Jonathan Polkest studied art at The Redruth School of Art in Clinton Road, The musician Aphex Twin (and friend of Vibert) grew up near Redruth. Luke Vibert has released an album called &quot;Chicago, Detroit, Redruth&quot; and has also recorded under the alias &quot;Kerrier District&quot;; a reference to name of the district in which Redruth is located. Hedluv + Passman both grew up in Redruth, and wrote the song &quot;&#x27;druth&quot; in tribute to the town. The traditional Cornish dance and music group, Hevva is based in Redruth.

===Scholars and philanthropists===
The historians Kenneth Hamilton Jenkin and Charles Thomas were also born in Redruth, and the Victorian philanthropist John Passmore Edwards was born in the neighbouring village of Blackwater.

===Town centre shopping===
Key shops and other outlets within the town centre include a multi-screen cinema, a covered market way, an old butter market, various antique shops, a second hand book shop and two supermarkets, plus Greens Newsagents, and the local cash and carry Jims. Off the main street (Fore Street), there are two separate specialist shopping areas, Bond Street (to the south of the railway station) and Green Lane to the north.

===Street landscaping===
Street landscaping in Redruth includes wooden seating, with granite furniture, signposts, street lights and litter bins, and two sets of bronze &#x27;dogs&#x27;, which were cast from the boots of former tin miners by sculptor David Kemp. The town has a burgundy colour theme, which is in the Public Realm regeneration work to highlight the town&#x27;s name. A project to light various public buildings around the town with LED coloured lights has already commenced. Some of the buildings opposite the railway station and the St Rumon&#x27;s Gardens have now (April 2008) been completed.

===Environment awards===
On 7 November 2007, Redruth jointly won (with Luton) the annual UK town centre environment awards, which are run by the BCSC (a retail property consortium). The judges praised the cast bronze &#x27;dogs&#x27; and also liked the large amount of work that had been done to the town in terms of landscaping the central area (mainly Fore St &amp; the opeways).

===Heartlands visitor park===
Just outside the town is a European funded visitor attraction, themed on the Robinson Shaft Mine, it offers parking, an adventure play ground for older children and a pleasant restaurant. At times the last working Cornish pumping engine can be seen working. The museum is an Anchor point on the European Route of Industrial Heritage.

===Miscellany===
It is home to Cornwall&#x27;s first ILR Radio Station, Pirate FM. On 20 June 2008, the town held its first regular Farmers&#x27; Market in Market Place: the Market will now be held every Friday throughout the year.

==Transport==

Redruth is an important transport hub. The railway station is a railhead for both Helston and the Lizard, and there are frequent buses connecting the three places. Bus services to the town are provided by Go Cornwall Bus, First Kernow, and Hopley&#x27;s Coaches, all under the Transport for Cornwall scheme. The railway station is served by Great Western Railway (GWR) operated trains from Paddington, South Wales, and the Midlands, as well as a daily CrossCountry service to the North. Redruth is next to the main A30 road and thus has access to the main route out of the county as well as routes to the far West, North Cornwall, South East Cornwall and Plymouth. Another road, the A393, bisects the town in a north–south direction, and links the A30 with the port of Falmouth. A third road, the A3047, links Redruth with Camborne, some four miles () to the west.

The Barncoose by-pass connects between the Redruth Community Hospital and the Barncoose Industrial Estate. It is intended to reduce HGV traffic using the main Camborne road and provide a direct access to the Industrial Estate. It did, however, provoke some controversy, as some residents in Barncoose lost their parking spaces to make way for the new road. It was extended further towards Camborne in 2016.

==Cornish wrestling==
Redruth has been a major centre for Cornish wrestling for centuries. The ancient traditional location for wrestling tournaments was at Plain-an-Gwarry, Redruth, which continued to be used as a venue, even after the Plen-an-gwary disappeared. Many other venues started to be used in the 1800s onwards such as South Turnpike, and the Recreation Ground/football ground.

In 1887, Redruth hosted 2 challenge matches for the world title in Cornish wrestling at the recreation ground. In July, John Pearce drew with Jack Carkeek from the US. The results of the fight were disputed and at a later brawl in a hotel between the two, Carkeek bit off Pearce&#x27;s ear. In August, Carkeek defeated Philip Hancock, although there were accusations that Hancock threw the fight.

In 1889, Redruth hosted the tournament for &quot;Championship of World&quot;, where many wrestlers descended on Redruth, including Carkeek, who eventually won.

The Interceltic games were held in Redruth in 1933 and 1972.

Men from Redruth were very successful in Cornish wrestling throughout the world.
