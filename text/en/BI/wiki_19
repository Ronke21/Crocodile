<text>A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity that comprises all church congregations of the same kind, identifiable by traits such as a name, particular history, organization, leadership, theological doctrine, worship style and, sometimes, a founder. It is a secular and neutral term, generally used to denote any established Christian church. Unlike a cult or sect, a denomination is usually seen as part of the Christian religious mainstream. Most Christian denominations refer to themselves as &quot;churches&quot;, whereas some newer ones tend to interchangeably use the terms &quot;churches&quot;, &quot;assemblies&quot;, &quot;fellowships&quot;, etc. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, biblical hermeneutics, theology, ecclesiology, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations—often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties—are sometimes known as &quot;branches of Christianity&quot;. These branches differ in many ways, especially through differences in practices and belief.

Individual denominations vary widely in the degree to which they recognize one another. Several groups say they are the direct and sole authentic successor of the church founded by Jesus Christ in the 1st century AD. Others, however, believe in denominationalism, where some or all Christian groups are legitimate churches of the same religion regardless of their distinguishing labels, beliefs, and practices. Because of this concept, some Christian bodies reject the term &quot;denomination&quot; to describe themselves, to avoid implying equivalence with other churches or denominations.

The Catholic Church, which has over 1.3 billion members or 50.1% of all Christians worldwide, does not view itself as a denomination, but as the original pre-denominational Church. The total Protestant population has reached around 1.047 billion in 2024, accounting for about 39.8% of all Christians. Sixteenth-century Protestants separated from the Catholic Church as a result of the Reformation, a movement against doctrines and practices which the Reformers perceived to be in violation of the Bible. Together, Catholicism and Protestantism (with major traditions including Adventism, Anabaptism, Anglicanism, Baptists, Lutheranism, Methodism, Moravianism, Pentecostalism, Plymouth Brethren, Quakerism, Reformed, and Waldensianism) compose Western Christianity. Western Christian denominations prevail in Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe (excluding Eastern Europe), North America, Oceania and South America.

The Eastern Orthodox Church, with an estimated 230 million adherents, is the second-largest Christian body in the world and also considers itself the original pre-denominational Church. Orthodox Christians, 80% of whom are Eastern Orthodox and 20% Oriental Orthodox, make up about 11.9% of the global Christian population. The Eastern Orthodox Church is itself a communion of fully independent autocephalous churches (or &quot;jurisdictions&quot;) that recognize each other, for the most part. Similarly, the Catholic Church is a communion of &quot;sui iuris&quot; churches, including 23 Eastern ones. The Eastern Orthodox Church, the 23 Eastern Catholic Churches, the Oriental Orthodox communion, the Assyrian Church of the East, the Ancient Church of the East, and the Eastern Lutheran Churches constitute Eastern Christianity. There are certain Eastern Protestant Christians that have adopted Protestant theology but have cultural and historical ties with other Eastern Christians. Eastern Christian denominations are represented mostly in Eastern Europe, North Asia, the Middle East, Northeast Africa, and India.

Christians have various doctrines about the Church (the body of the faithful that they believe Jesus Christ established) and about how the divine church corresponds to Christian denominations. The Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Church of the East and Lutheran denominations, each hold that only their own specific organization faithfully represents the one holy catholic and apostolic Church, to the exclusion of all others. Certain denominational traditions teach that they were divinely instituted to propagate a certain doctrine or spiritual experience, for example the raising up of Methodism by God to propagate entire sanctification (the &quot;second blessing&quot;), or the launch of Pentecostalism to bestow a supernatural empowerment evidenced by speaking in tongues on humanity.

Restorationism emerged after the Second Great Awakening and collectively affirms belief in a Great Apostasy, thus promoting a belief in restoring what they see as primitive Christianity. It includes Mormons, Irvingians, Christadelphians, Swedenborgians, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, among others, although beliefs between these religions differ greatly.

Generally, members of the various denominations acknowledge each other as Christians, at least to the extent that they have mutually recognized baptisms and acknowledge historically orthodox views including the divinity of Jesus and doctrines of sin and salvation, even though doctrinal and ecclesiological obstacles hinder full communion between churches. Since the reforms surrounding the Second Vatican Council of 1962–1965, the Catholic Church has referred to Protestant churches as ecclesial communities, while reserving the term &quot;church&quot; for apostolic churches, including the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches, as well as the Ancient and Assyrian Churches of the East . But some non-denominational Christians do not follow any particular branch, though they sometimes are regarded as Protestants.

== Terminology ==
Each group uses different terminology to discuss their beliefs. This section will discuss the definitions of several terms used throughout the article, before discussing the beliefs themselves in detail in following sections.

A denomination within Christianity can be defined as a &quot;recognized autonomous branch of the Christian Church&quot;; major synonyms include &quot;religious group, sect, Church,&quot; etc. &quot;Church&quot; as a synonym, refers to a &quot;particular Christian organization with its own clergy, buildings, and distinctive doctrines&quot;; &quot;church&quot; can also more broadly be defined as the entire body of Christians, the &quot;Christian Church&quot;.

Some traditional and evangelical Protestants draw a distinction between membership in the universal church and fellowship within the local church. Becoming a believer in Christ makes one a member of the universal church; one then may join a fellowship of other local believers. Some evangelical groups describe themselves as interdenominational fellowships, partnering with local churches to strengthen evangelical efforts, usually targeting a particular group with specialized needs, such as students or ethnic groups. A related concept is denominationalism, the belief that some or all Christian groups are legitimate churches of the same religion regardless of their distinguishing labels, beliefs, and practices. (Conversely, &quot;denominationalism&quot; can also refer to &quot;emphasizing of denominational differences to the point of being narrowly exclusive&quot;, similar to sectarianism.)

The views of Protestant leaders differ greatly from those of the leaders of the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, the two largest Christian denominations. Each church makes mutually exclusive statements for itself to be the direct continuation of the church founded by Jesus Christ, from whom other denominations later broke away. These churches, and a few others, reject denominationalism. For the purpose of academic study of religion, the main families of Christianity are categorized as a denomination, that is, &quot;an organized body of Christians.&quot; 

Historically, Catholics would label members of certain Christian churches (also certain non-Christian religions) by the names of their founders, either actual or purported. Such supposed founders were referred to as heresiarchs. This was done even when the party thus labeled viewed itself as belonging to the one true church. This allowed the Catholic party to say that the other church was founded by the founder, while the Catholic church was founded by Christ. This was done intentionally in order to &quot;produce the appearance of the fragmentation within Christianity&quot; – a problem which the Catholic side would then attempt to remedy on its own terms.

Although Catholics reject branch theory, Pope Benedict XVI and Pope John Paul II used the &quot;two lungs&quot; concept to relate Catholicism with Eastern Orthodoxy.

== Major branches ==
Christianity can be taxonomically divided into six main groups: the Church of the East, Oriental Orthodoxy, Eastern Orthodoxy, Catholicism, Protestantism, and Restorationism. Protestantism includes many groups which do not share any ecclesiastical governance and have widely diverging beliefs and practices. Major Protestant branches include Adventism, Anabaptism, Anglicanism, Baptists, Lutheranism, Methodism, Moravianism, Quakerism, Pentecostalism, Plymouth Brethren, Reformed Christianity, and Waldensianism. Reformed Christianity itself includes the Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, Evangelical Anglican, Congregationalist, and Reformed Baptist traditions. Anabaptist Christianity itself includes the Amish, Apostolic, Bruderhof, Hutterite, Mennonite, River Brethren, and Schwarzenau Brethren traditions.

Within the Restorationist branch of Christianity, denominations include the Irvingians, Swedenborgians, Christadelphians, Latter Day Saints, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, , and .

Christianity has denominational families (or movements) and also has individual denominations (or communions). The difference between a denomination and a denominational family is sometimes unclear to outsiders. Some denominational families can be considered major branches. Groups that are members of a branch, while sharing historical ties and similar doctrines, are not necessarily in communion with one another.

There were some movements considered heresies by the early Church which do not exist today and are not generally referred to as denominations: examples include the Gnostics (who had believed in an esoteric dualism called gnosis), the Ebionites (who denied the divinity of Jesus), and the Arians (who subordinated the Son to the Father by denying the pre-existence of Christ, thus placing Jesus as a created being), Bogomilism and the Bosnian Church. The greatest divisions in Christianity today, however, are between the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox, Catholics, and the various denominations formed during and after the Protestant Reformation. There also exists a number of non-Trinitarian groups.

=== Denominationalism ===
Denominationalism is the belief that some or all Christian groups are legitimate churches of the same religion regardless of their distinguishing labels, beliefs, and practices. The idea was first articulated by Independents within the Puritan movement. They argued that differences among Christians were inevitable, but that separation based on these differences was not necessarily schism. Christians are obligated to practice their beliefs rather than remain within a church with which they disagree, but they must also recognize their imperfect knowledge and not condemn other Christians as apostate over unimportant matters.

Some Christians view denominationalism as a regrettable fact. As of 2011, divisions are becoming less sharp, and there is increasing cooperation between denominations, which is known as ecumenism. Many denominations participate in the World Council of Churches.

=== Taxonomy ===
== Historical schisms and divisions ==
Christianity has not been a monolithic faith since the first century or Apostolic Age, though Christians were largely in communion with each other. Today there exist a large variety of groups that share a common history and tradition within and without mainstream Christianity. Christianity is the largest religion in the world (making up approximately one-third of the population) and the various divisions have commonalities and differences in tradition, theology, church government, doctrine, and language.

The largest schism or division in many classification schemes is between the families of Eastern and Western Christianity. After these two larger families come distinct branches of Christianity. Most classification schemes list Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, and Orthodox Christianity, with Orthodox Christianity being divided into Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy and the Church of the East. However Roman Catholicism is to be seen as a distinct denomination within Western Christianity. Protestantism includes diverse groups such as Adventists, Anabaptists, Anglicans, Baptists, Congregationalists, Methodists (inclusive of the Holiness movement), Moravians, Pentecostals, Presbyterians, Reformed, and Unitarians (depending on one&#x27;s classification scheme) are all a part of the same family but have distinct doctrinal variations within each group—Lutherans see themselves not to be a part of the rest of what they call &quot;Reformed Protestantism&quot; due to radical differences in sacramental theology and historical approach to the Reformation itself (both Reformed and Lutherans see their reformation in the sixteenth century to be a &#x27;reforming&#x27; of the Catholic Church, not a rejection of it entirely). From these come denominations, which in the West, have independence from the others in their doctrine.

The Catholic Church, due to its hierarchical structures, is not said to be made up of denominations, rather, it is a single denomination that include kinds of regional councils and individual congregations and church bodies, which do not officially differ from one another in doctrine.

===Antiquity===
The initial differences between the East and West traditions stem from socio-cultural and ethno-linguistic divisions in and between the Western Roman and Byzantine empires. Since the West (that is, Western Europe) spoke Latin as its &quot;lingua franca&quot; and the East (Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and northern Africa) largely used Aramaic and Koine Greek to transmit writings, theological developments were difficult to translate from one branch to the other. In the course of ecumenical councils (large gatherings of Christian leaders), some church bodies split from the larger family of Christianity. Many earlier heretical groups either died off for lack of followers or suppression by the early proto-orthodox Church at large (such as Apollinarians, Montanists, and Ebionites).

Following the Council of Chalcedon in 451, the next large split came with the Syriac and Coptic churches dividing themselves, with some churches becoming today&#x27;s Oriental Orthodox. The Armenian Apostolic Church, whose representatives were not able to attend the council did not accept new dogmas and now is also seen as an Oriental Orthodox church. In modern times, there have also been moves towards healing this split, with common Christological statements being made between Pope John Paul II and Syriac Patriarch Ignatius Zakka I Iwas, as well as between representatives of both Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy.

There has been a statement that the Chalcedonian Creed restored Nestorianism, however this is refuted by maintaining the following distinctions associated with the &quot;person&quot; of Christ: two hypostases, two natures (Nestorian); one hypostasis, one nature (Monophysite); one hypostasis, two natures (Eastern Orthodox/Roman Catholic).

===Middle Ages===

In Western Christianity, a handful of geographically isolated movements preceded the spirit of the Protestant Reformation. The Cathars were a very strong movement in medieval southwestern France, but did not survive into modern times. In northern Italy and southeastern France, Peter Waldo founded the Waldensians in the 12th century. This movement has largely been absorbed by modern-day Protestant groups. In Bohemia, a movement in the early 15th century by Jan Hus called the Hussites defied Catholic dogma, creating the still-extant Moravian Church, a major Protestant denomination.

Although the church as a whole did not experience any major divisions for centuries afterward, the Eastern and Western groups drifted until the point where patriarchs from both families excommunicated one another in about 1054 in what is known as the Great Schism. The political and theological reasons for the schism are complex, but one major controversy was the inclusion and acceptance in the West of the filioque clause into the Nicene Creed, which the East viewed as erroneous. Another was the definition of papal primacy.

Both West and East agreed that the Patriarch of Rome was owed a &quot;primacy of honour&quot; by the other patriarchs (those of Alexandria, Antioch, Constantinople and Jerusalem), but the West also contended that this primacy extended to jurisdiction, a position rejected by the Eastern patriarchs. Various attempts at dialogue between the two groups would occur, but it was only in the 1960s, under Pope Paul VI and Patriarch Athenagoras, that significant steps began to be made to mend the relationship between the two.

===Protestant Reformation (16th century)===
The Protestant Reformation began with the posting of Martin Luther&#x27;s &quot;Ninety-Five Theses&quot; in Saxony on October 31, 1517, written as a set of grievances to reform the pre-Reformation Western Church. Luther&#x27;s writings, combined with the work of Swiss theologian Huldrych Zwingli and French theologian and politician John Calvin sought to reform existing problems in doctrine and practice. Due to the reactions of ecclesiastical office holders at the time of the reformers, these reformers separated from the Catholic Church, instigating a rift in Western Christianity.

In England, Henry VIII of England declared himself to be supreme head of the Church of England with the Act of Supremacy in 1534, founding the Church of England, repressing both Lutheran reformers and those loyal to the pope. Thomas Cranmer as Archbishop of Canterbury introduced the Reformation, in a form compromising between the Calvinists and Lutherans.

===Old and Liberal Catholic Churches (19th–20th centuries)===

The Old Catholic Church split from the Catholic Church in the 1870s because of the promulgation of the dogma of papal infallibility as promoted by the First Vatican Council of 1869–1870. The term &#x27;Old Catholic&#x27; was first used in 1853 to describe the members of the See of Utrecht that were not under Papal authority. The Old Catholic movement grew in America but has not maintained ties with Utrecht, although talks are under way between independent Old Catholic bishops and Utrecht.

The Liberal Catholic Church started in 1916 via an Old Catholic bishop in London, bishop Matthew, who consecrated bishop James Wedgwood to the Episcopacy. This stream has in its relatively short existence known many splits, which operate worldwide under several names.

===Eastern Christianity===
In the Eastern world, the largest body of believers in modern times is the Eastern Orthodox Church, sometimes imprecisely called &quot;Greek Orthodox&quot; because from the time of Christ through the Byzantine empire, Greek was its common language. However, the term &quot;Greek Orthodox&quot; actually refers to only one portion of the entire Eastern Orthodox Church. The Eastern Orthodox Church believes itself to be the continuation of the original Christian Church established by Jesus Christ, and the Apostles. The Orthodox and Catholics have been separated since the 11th century, following the East–West Schism, with each of them saying they represent the original pre-schism Church.

The Eastern Orthodox consider themselves to be spiritually one body, which is administratively grouped into several autocephalous jurisdictions (also commonly referred to as &quot;churches&quot;, despite being parts of one Church). They do not recognize any single bishop as universal church leader, but rather each bishop governs only his own diocese. The Patriarch of Constantinople is known as the Ecumenical Patriarch, and holds the title &quot;first among equals&quot;, meaning only that if a great council is called, the patriarch sits as president of the council. He has no more power than any other bishop. Currently, the largest synod with the most members is the Russian Orthodox Church. Others include the ancient Patriarchates of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem, the Georgian, Romanian, Serbian and Bulgarian Orthodox churches, and several smaller ones.

The second largest Eastern Christian communion is Oriental Orthodoxy, which is organized in a similar manner, with six national autocephalous groups and two autonomous bodies, although there are greater internal differences than among the Eastern Orthodox (especially in the diversity of rites being used). The six autocephalous Oriental Orthodox churches are the Coptic (Egyptian), Syriac, Armenian, Malankara (Indian), Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox churches. In the Aramaic-speaking areas of the Middle East, the Syriac Orthodox Church has long been dominant. Although the region of modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea has had a strong body of believers since the infancy of Christianity, these regions only gained autocephaly in 1963 and 1994 respectively. The Oriental Orthodox are distinguished from the Eastern Orthodox by doctrinal differences concerning the union of human and divine natures in the person of Jesus Christ, and the two communions separated as a consequence of the Council of Chalcedon in the year 451, although there have been recent moves towards reconciliation. Since these groups are relatively obscure in the West, literature on them has sometimes included the Church of the East, which, like the Oriental Orthodox, originated in the 1st century A.D., but has not been in communion with them since before the Council of Ephesus of 431.

Largely aniconic, the Church of the East represents a third Eastern Christian tradition in its own right. In recent centuries, it has split into three Churches. The largest (since the early 20th century) is the Baghdad-based Chaldean Catholic Church formed from groups that entered communion with Rome at different times, beginning in 1552. The second-largest is what since 1976 is officially called the Assyrian Church of the East and which from 1933 to 2015 was headquartered first in Cyprus and then in the United States, but whose present Catholicos-Patriarch, Gewargis III, elected in 2015, lives in Erbil, Iraq. The third is the Ancient Church of the East, distinct since 1964 and headed by Addai II Giwargis, resident in Baghdad.

There are also the Eastern Catholic Churches, most of which are counterparts of those listed above, sharing with them the same theological and liturgical traditions, but differing from them in that they recognize the Bishop of Rome as the universal head of the Church. They are fully part of the Catholic communion, on the same level juridically as the Latin Church. Most of their members do not describe themselves as &quot;&quot;Roman&quot; Catholics&quot;, a term they associate with membership of the Latin Church, and speak of themselves in relation to whichever Church they belong to: Maronites, Melkites, Ukrainian Catholics, Coptic Catholics, Chaldean Catholics, etc.

And finally the smallest Eastern Christian group founded in early 20th century is Byzantine Rite Lutheranism where accept Byzantine Rite as Church&#x27;s liturgy while retaining their Lutheran traditions like Ukrainian Lutheran Church. It is considered part of Eastern Protestant denominational movement.

===Western Christianity===
The Latin portion of the Catholic Church, along with Protestantism, comprise the three major divisions of Christianity in the Western world. Catholics do not describe themselves as a denomination but rather as the original Church, from which all other branches broke off in schism. The Baptist, Methodist, and Lutheran churches are generally considered to be Protestant denominations, although strictly speaking, of these three, only the Lutherans took part in the official Protestation at Speyer after the decree of the Second Diet of Speyer mandated the burning of Luther&#x27;s works and the end of the Protestant Reformation. Anglicanism is generally classified as Protestant, being originally seen as a &quot;via media&quot;, or middle way between Lutheranism and Reformed Christianity, and since the Oxford Movement of the 19th century, some Anglican writers of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship emphasize a more catholic understanding of the church and characterize it as being &quot;both&quot; Protestant and Catholic. A case is sometimes also made to regard Lutheranism in a similar way, considering the catholic character of its foundational documents (the Augsburg Confession and other documents contained in the Book of Concord) and its existence prior to the Anglican, Anabaptist, and Reformed churches, from which nearly all other Protestant denominations derive.

One central tenet of Catholicism (which is a common point between Catholic, Scandinavian Lutheran, Anglican, Moravian, Orthodox, and some other Churches), is its practice of apostolic succession. &quot;Apostle&quot; means &quot;one who is sent out&quot;. Jesus commissioned the first twelve apostles, and they, in turn laid hands on subsequent church leaders to ordain (commission) them for ministry. In this manner, Catholics and Anglicans trace their ordained ministers all the way back to the original Twelve.

Catholics believe that the Pope has authority which can be traced directly to the apostle Peter whom they hold to be the original head of and first Pope of the Church. There are smaller churches, such as the Old Catholic Church which rejected the definition of Papal Infallibility at the First Vatican Council, as well as Evangelical Catholics and Anglo-Catholics, who are Lutherans and Anglicans that believe that Lutheranism and Anglicanism, respectively, are a continuation of historical Catholicism and who incorporate many Catholic beliefs and practices. The Catholic Church refers to itself simply by the terms &quot;Catholic&quot; and &quot;Catholicism&quot; (which mean universal).

Some Catholics, based on a strict interpretation of &quot;extra ecclesiam nulla salus&quot; (&quot;Outside the Church, there is no salvation&quot;), reject any notion those outside its communion could be regarded as part of any true Catholic Christian faith. This is called Feeneyism, which is considered a heresy by the Catholic Church, and was rejected by the Second Vatican Council (19621965). Catholicism has a hierarchical structure in which supreme authority for matters of faith and practice are the exclusive domain of the Pope, who sits on the Throne of Peter, and the bishops when acting in union with him.

Each Protestant movement has developed freely, and many have split over theological issues. For instance, a number of movements grew out of spiritual revivals, such as Pentecostalism. Doctrinal issues and matters of conscience have also divided Protestants. Still others formed out of administrative issues; Methodism branched off as its own group of denominations when the American Revolutionary War complicated the movement&#x27;s ability to ordain ministers (it had begun as a movement within the Church of England). In Methodism&#x27;s case, it has undergone a number of administrative schisms and mergers with other denominations (especially those associated with the holiness movement in the 20th century).

The Anabaptist tradition, made up of the Amish, Hutterites, and Mennonites, rejected the Roman Catholic and Lutheran doctrines of infant baptism; this tradition is also noted for its belief in pacifism. Many Anabaptists do not see themselves as Protestant, but a separate tradition altogether.

Some denominations which arose alongside the Western Christian tradition consider themselves Christian, but neither Catholic nor wholly Protestant, such as the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). Quakerism began as an evangelical Christian movement in 17th century England, eschewing priests and all formal Anglican or Catholic sacraments in their worship, including many of those practices that remained among the stridently Protestant Puritans such as baptism with water. They were known in America for helping with the Underground Railroad, and like the Mennonites, Quakers traditionally refrain from participation in war.

Many churches with roots in Restorationism reject being identified as Protestant or even as a denomination at all, as they use only the Bible and not creeds, and model the church after what they feel is the first-century church found in scripture; the Churches of Christ are one example; African Initiated Churches, like Kimbanguism, mostly fall within Protestantism, with varying degrees of syncretism. The measure of mutual acceptance between the denominations and movements varies, but is growing largely due to the ecumenical movement in the 20th century and overarching Christian bodies such as the World Council of Churches.

=== Christians with Jewish roots ===

Messianic Jews maintain a Jewish identity while accepting Jesus as the Messiah and the New Testament as authoritative. After the founding of the church, the disciples of Jesus generally retained their ethnic origins while accepting the Gospel message. The first church council was called in Jerusalem to address just this issue, and the deciding opinion was written by James the Just, the first bishop of Jerusalem and a pivotal figure in the Christian movement. The history of Messianic Judaism includes many movements and groups and defies any simple classification scheme.

The 19th century saw at least 250,000 Jews convert to Christianity according to existing records of various societies. Data from the Pew Research Center has it that, as of 2013, about 1.6 million adult American Jews identify themselves as Christians, most as Protestants. According to the same data, most of the Jews who identify themselves as some sort of Christian (1.6 million) were raised as Jews or are Jews by ancestry.

== Modern history ==
=== Unitarianism ===

Within Italy, Poland, Lithuania, Transylvania, Hungary and Romania Unitarian Churches emerged from the Reformed tradition in the 16th century. They adopted the Anabaptist doctrine of credobaptism. The Unitarian Church of Transylvania is an example of such a denomination that arose in this era and is represented in the Protestant Theological Institute of Cluj. Due to their rejection of the Athanasian Creed which contains the doctrine of the Trinity, many mainstream Christian Churches do not recognize Unitarians as Christians.

=== Restorationism ===
==== Second Great Awakening ====

The Stone–Campbell Restoration Movement began on the American frontier during the Second Great Awakening (1790–1870) of the early 19th century. The movement sought to restore the church and &quot;the unification of all Christians in a single body patterned after the church of the New Testament.&quot; Members do not identify as Protestant but simply as Christian.

The Restoration Movement developed from several independent efforts to return to apostolic Christianity, but two groups, which independently developed similar approaches to the Christian faith, were particularly important. The first, led by Barton W. Stone, began at Cane Ridge, Kentucky and called themselves simply as &quot;Christians&quot;. The second began in western Pennsylvania and Virginia (now West Virginia) and was led by Thomas Campbell and his son, Alexander Campbell; they used the name &quot;Disciples of Christ&quot;. Both groups sought to restore the whole Christian church on the pattern set forth in the New Testament, and both believed that creeds kept Christianity divided. In 1832 they joined in fellowship with a handshake.

Among other things, they were united in the belief that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; that Christians should celebrate the Lord&#x27;s Supper on the first day of each week; and that baptism of adult believers by immersion in water is a necessary condition for salvation. Because the founders wanted to abandon all denominational labels, they used the biblical names for the followers of Jesus. Both groups promoted a return to the purposes of the 1st-century churches as described in the New Testament. One historian of the movement has argued that it was primarily a unity movement, with the restoration motif playing a subordinate role.

The Restoration Movement has since divided into multiple separate groups. There are three main branches in the US: the Churches of Christ, the Christian churches and churches of Christ, and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Other U.S.-based groups affiliated with the movement are the International Churches of Christ and the International Christian Churches. Non-U.S. groups include the Churches of Christ in Australia, the Evangelical Christian Church in Canada, the Churches of Christ in Europe. The Plymouth Brethren are a similar though historically unrelated group which originated in the United Kingdom. Some churches, such as Churches of Christ or the Plymouth Brethren reject formal ties with other churches within the movement.

Other Christian groups originating during the Second Great Awakening including the Adventist movement, the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and Christian Science, founded within fifty years of one another, all consider themselves to be restorative of primitive Christianity and the early church. Some Baptist churches with Landmarkist views have similar beliefs concerning their connection with primitive Christianity.

==== Latter Day Saint movement ====
Most Latter Day Saint denominations are derived from the Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints) established by Joseph Smith in 1830, which is categorized as a Restorationist denomination. The largest worldwide denomination is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, colloquially referred to as Mormonism. Various considerably smaller sects broke from this movement after its relocation to the Rocky Mountains in the mid-1800s. Several of these broke away over the abandonment of practicing plural marriage after the 1890 Manifesto. Most of the &quot;Prairie Saint&quot; denominations (see below) were established after Smith&#x27;s death by the remnants of the Latter Day Saints who did not go west with Brigham Young. Many of these opposed some of the 1840s theological developments in favor of 1830s theological understandings and practices. Other denominations are defined by either a belief in Joseph Smith as a prophet or acceptance of the Book of Mormon as scripture. Mormons generally consider themselves to be restorationist, believing that Smith, as prophet, seer, and revelator, restored the original and true Church of Christ to the earth. Some Latter Day Saint denominations are regarded by other Christians as being nontrinitarian or even non-Christian, but the Latter Day Saints are predominantly in disagreement with these statements. Latter Day Saints see themselves as believing in a Godhead comprising the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost as separate personages united in purpose. Latter Day Saints regard traditional definitions of the Trinity as aberrations of true doctrine and emblematic of the Great Apostasy but they do not accept certain trinitarian definitions in the post-apostolic creeds, such as the Athanasian Creed.

=== Spiritual Christianity ===
Spiritual Christianity, inclusive of the Molokans, &quot;Dukh-i-zhizniki&quot;, Doukhobors, and numerous tribal faiths, emerged in Russia, each containing a unique tradition. The Doukhobor have maintained close association with Mennonite Anabaptist Christians and Quaker Christians due to analogous religious practices; all of these groups are furthermore collectively considered to be peace churches due to their belief in pacifism.

=== Other movements ===
Protestant denominations have shown a strong tendency towards diversification and fragmentation, giving rise to numerous churches and movements, especially in Anglo-American religious history, where the process is cast in terms of a series of &quot;Great Awakenings&quot;.

The most recent wave of diversification, known as the Fourth Great Awakening took place during the 1960s to 1980s and resulted in phenomena such as the Charismatic Movement, the Jesus movement, and a number of parachurch organizations based in Evangelicalism.

Many independent churches and movements consider themselves to be non-denominational, but may vary greatly in doctrine. Many of these, like the local churches movement, reflect the core teachings of traditional Christianity. Others however, such as The Way International, have been denounced as cults by the Christian anti-cult movement. Further, others may have similar doctrine to mainline churches but incorporate a multi-faith and ecumenical model such as the Interfaith-Ecumenical Church (IEC) that is based entirely in a virtual and international model.

Two movements, which are entirely unrelated in their founding, but share a common element of an additional Messiah (or incarnation of Christ) are the Unification Church and the Rastafari movement. These movements fall outside of traditional taxonomies of Christian groups, though both cite the Christian Bible as a basis for their beliefs.

Syncretism of Christian beliefs with local and tribal religions is a phenomenon that occurs throughout the world. An example of this is the Native American Church. The ceremonies of this group are strongly tied to the use of peyote. (Parallels may be drawn here with the Rastafari spiritual use of cannabis.) While traditions vary from tribe to tribe, they often include a belief in Jesus as a Native American cultural hero, an intercessor for man, or a spiritual guardian; belief in the Bible; and an association of Jesus with peyote.

There are also some Christians that reject organized religion altogether. Some Christian anarchists—often those of a Protestant background—believe that the original teachings of Jesus were corrupted by Roman statism (compare Early Christianity and State church of the Roman Empire), and that earthly authority such as government, or indeed the established Church, do not and should not have power over them. Following &quot;The Golden Rule&quot;, many oppose the use of physical force in any circumstance, and advocate nonviolence. The Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy wrote &quot;The Kingdom of God Is Within You&quot;, and was a Christian anarchist.

<text>A virion (plural, &quot;viria&quot; or &quot;virions&quot;) is an inert virus particle capable of invading a cell. Upon entering the cell, the virion disassembles and the genetic material from the virus takes control of the cell infrastructure, thus enabling the virus to replicate. The genetic material (&quot;core&quot;, either DNA or RNA, along with occasionally present virus core protein) inside the virion is usually enclosed in a protection shell, known as the capsid. 

While the terms &quot;virus&quot; and &quot;virion&quot; are occasionally confused, recently &quot;virion&quot; is used solely to describe the virus structure outside of cells, while the terms &quot;virus/viral&quot; are broader and also include biological properties such as the infectivity of a virion.

== Components ==
A virion consists of one or more nucleic acid genome molecules (single-stranded or double-stranded RNA or DNA) and coatings (a capsid and possibly a viral envelope). The virion may contain other proteins (for example with enzymatic activities) and/or nucleoproteins.

=== Capsid ===
In the vast majority of viruses, the DNA and RNA components are packed into a protein shell, the capsid. The capsid proteins are often differentiated into major and minor capsid proteins (MCP and mCP). In exceptional cases, there are also viruses without a capsid (i.e., true virions), such as the RNA viruses of the &quot;Narnaviridae&quot; and the viroids of the &quot;Pospiviroidae&quot; (with the Citrus Exocortis Viroid and the Citrus Bark Crack Viroid).

If the genome consists of several segments, these are usually packaged together in a capsid (e.g., influenza viruses), and in some viruses, the segments can also be individually packaged in their own capsids (e.g., in &quot;Nanoviridae&quot;).
Since the genome of viruses is relatively simple, the capsid architecture relies on repetition of simple structures, similar to the faces of a polyhedron. Each face in turn is formed by a repetition of simpler sub-units, with the amount of repetitions called a triangulation number (T). Similar capsid structures can be used by many different types of viruses.

In many viruses, the virions have icosahedral symmetry, which can be ideally isometric or elongated. Many virions also have other shapes:
* &quot;Inoviridae&quot; and &quot;Filoviridae&quot;: thread-like/filamentous/helical
* &quot;Ampullaviridae&quot;: bottle-shaped
* &quot;Bicaudaviridae&quot;, &quot;Fuselloviridae&quot;, &quot;Halspiviridae&quot; and &quot;Thaspiviridae&quot;: spindle- to lemon-shaped
* &quot;Poxviridae&quot; and &quot;Ovaliviridae&quot;: ovoid to ellipsoid
* &quot;Gammaretrovirus&quot; and other &quot;Retroviridae&quot;, such as HIV, roughly round to complexly multiform (pleomorphic).
From observations using microscopy, there are indications of many more distinct shapes.

=== Tail ===

In some groups of viruses—such as the class &quot;Caudoviricetes&quot; (&quot;tail viruses&quot;) and the genus &quot;Tupanvirus&quot;—the capsid carries an appendage called the &quot;tail&quot;.

The tail of the &quot;Caudoviricetes&quot; is usually divided into:
* a neck, possibly with collar a long, possibly contractile tail sheath
* base plate
* possibly tail fibers/tail spikes
The latter are used to establish contact with the host cell. The tail of these viruses serves as an injection device to introduce their own genome into the host cell. The &quot;Caudoviricetes&quot; tail material is also differentiated into major and minor tail proteins (MTP and mTP), as seen in the Enterobacteria phage lambda. In addition, there may be a tail spike protein (TSP) or tail fiber protein (TFP).

Even in viruses with helical morphology (such as the &quot;Rudiviridae&quot; and &quot;Ahmunviridae&quot;), the terminal fiber proteins responsible for the receptor binding are called tail fiber proteins.

=== Spikes ===
Spikes (peplomers) can protrude from the capsid, as in the &quot;Coronaviridae&quot;, the &quot;Tectiviridae&quot;, and others. These are used to establish contact with the host cell.

In viruses of the genus &quot;Chlorovirus&quot;, the virions have a single spike that serves as an injection device; an extendable injection apparatus are found in virions of the family &quot;Tectiviridae&quot;.

=== Viral envelope ===
In many virus species, the virion also has an outer membrane, the viral envelope. The envelope includes a lipid bilayer and surface proteins, similar to the cell membranes, that are usually used for the envelope construction when the virus is exiting the cell. This structure helps with attachment to the cell and also assists evading the immune system of the host organism while the virion is searching for a cell to infect.

<text>Yi Hwang (; 1501–1570) was a Korean philosopher, writer, and Confucian scholar of the Joseon period. He is considered the most important philosopher of Korea - he is honored by printing his portrait on the 1000 South Korean won banknote, on the reverse of which one can see an image of his school, Dosan Seowon. He was of the Neo-Confucian literati, established the Yeongnam School and set up the Dosan Seowon, a private Confucian academy.

Yi Hwang is often referred to by his art name Toegye (&quot;Retreating Creek&quot;). His courtesy name was Gyeongho.

His interpretation of Neo-Confucianism was influential not only in Korea, but also in Japan, Taiwan, and Vietnam, and is now being studied even in the mainland China. His main work, &quot;Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning&quot;, originally published in classical Chinese language, has been already translated into modern Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, English, French, German, Russian and Polish.

Some of his writings were looted by the Japanese military during the Japanese invasion of Korea.

== Biography ==
Yi Hwang was born in Ongye-ri, Andong, in the north of Gyeongsang Province, in 1501. He belonged to the Jinbo Yi clan, and was the youngest son among eight children. A child prodigy, he learned the &quot;Analects of Confucius&quot; from his uncle at age twelve and admiring the poetry of Tao Yuanming, started writing poetry. His poem &quot;Yadang&quot; (, &quot;Pond in the Wild&quot;), written at the age of eighteen, is considered one of his major works. Around the age of twenty, he immersed himself in the study of I Ching and Neo-Confucianism.

He came to Seoul (then known as Hanseong) when he was 23 years old and entered the national academy Sungkyunkwan in 1523. In 1527 he passed preliminary exams to become a government official, but re-entered Sungkyunkwan at the age of 33 and socialized with the scholar Kim In-hu. He passed the civil service exams with top honors in 1534 and continued his scholarly pursuits whilst working for the government. He returned to his childhood home at the death of his mother at the age of 37 and mourned her for 3 years. He was appointed various positions from the age of 39 and sometimes held multiple positions including secret royal inspector, or &quot;Amhaengeosa&quot; (), in 1542. His integrity made him relentless as he took part in purges of corrupt government officials. On numerous occasions he was even exiled from the capital for his firm commitment to principle.

Yi Hwang was disillusioned by the power struggles and discord in the royal court during the later years of King Jungjong&#x27;s reign and left political office. However, he was continuously brought out of retirement and held several positions away from the royal court and in rural areas. He was the governor of Danyang at 48 and governor of Punggi afterwards. During his days at Pungi he redeveloped and improved the private Neo-Confucian academy Baekundong Seowon established by his predecessor Ju Se-bung.

He was named &quot;Daesaseong&quot; (대사성, head instructor) of Sungkyunkwan in 1552 but turned down other prominent offices later on. In 1560, he established the &quot;Dosan seodang&quot; and engrossed himself in meditation, study, and teaching his disciples. King Myeongjong tried to coax him back to political office, but he was steadfast in his devotion to study. He finally returned to the royal court at 67 upon the king&#x27;s request when envoys from the Ming dynasty came to Seoul. When King Myeongjong suddenly died, his successor King Seonjo appointed Yi Hwang as &quot;Yejo panseo&quot; (, minister of rites) but he declined and returned to his home once again.

However, the king continuously called Yi Hwang back and unable to refuse further, he resumed office at the age of 68 and wrote many advisory documents including &quot;Seonghak sipdo&quot; (, &quot;Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning&quot;). He also gave lectures from the teachings of Song dynasty Confucian scholars Cheng Yi and Cheng Hao, I Ching, Analects, and Zhang Zai in royal presence. He finally retired from politics at the age of 70 and died in 1570.

During forty years of public life he served four kings (Jungjong, Injong, Myeongjong and Seonjo). On his death, Yi Hwang was posthumously promoted to the highest ministerial rank, and his mortuary tablet housed in a Confucian shrine as well as in the shrine of King Seonjo. His disciples and followers reorganized the &quot;Dosan seodang&quot; to Dosan Seowon in 1574.

==Teachings==
Yi Hwang was the author of many books on Confucianism. He followed the dualistic Neo-Confucianism teachings of Zhu Xi, which views &quot;i&quot; (Chinese &quot;li&quot;) and &quot;gi&quot; (Chinese &quot;qi&quot;) as the forces of foundation of the universe. Yi Hwang placed emphasis on the &quot;i&quot;, the formative element, as the existential force that determines &quot;gi&quot;. This school of thought contrasted with the school that focused on the concrete element of &quot;gi&quot;, established by Yi Hwang&#x27;s counterpart Yi I. Understanding the determinative pattern of &quot;i&quot; would be more essential in understanding the universe than recognizing the principles that govern individual manifestations of &quot;gi&quot;. This approach of placing importance on the role of &quot;i&quot; became the core of the Yeongnam School, where Yi Hwang&#x27;s legacy was carried on by prominent figures such as Yu Sŏngnyong and Kim Seong-il.

Yi Hwang was also talented in calligraphy and poetry, writing a collection of &quot;sijo&quot;, a three line poetic form popular with the literati of the Joseon period.

==Selected works==
These are some of Yi Hwang&#x27;s published writings:
* 1599 — 退溪全書
* 1681 — &quot;The Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning&quot; ()
* 1746 — 退溪集
* &quot;Outline and Explanations of the Works of Zhu Xi&quot; ()
* &quot;Commentary on the Heart Sutra&quot; ()
* &quot;History of Neo-Confucianism in the Song, Yuan and Ming Dynasties&quot; ()
* &quot;The Four-Seven Debate&quot; (): discusses Mencius&#x27;s philosophy with Gi Dae-seung

===Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning===
The Neo-Confucian literature of &quot;Seonghaksipdo&quot; was composed by Yi Hwang in 1568 for King Seonjo. It is a series of lectures for rulers through examples of past sages. Traditional Confucians had affirmed that any man could learn to become a sage; the new Confucians made the ideal of sagehood real and attainable, just as enlightenment was for Buddhists. Yi Hwang intended to present that path by starting each chapter with a diagram and related text drawn from Zhu Xi or another leading authority, and concluding with a brief commentary. He intended for &quot;Ten Diagrams&quot; to be made into a ten paneled standing screen, as well as a short book, so that the mind of the viewer could be constantly engaged with its contents, until it totally assimilated the material.

==Legacy==

Toegyero, a street in central Seoul, is named after him, and he is depicted on the South Korean 1,000 won note. The Taekwondo pattern Toi-Gye was named in honor of Yi Hwang.

Many institutes and university research departments devoted to Yi Hwang have been established. The Toegye Studies Institute set up in Seoul in 1970, Kyungpook National University&#x27;s Toegye Institute opened in 1979, and an institute and library in Dankook University in 1986. There are research institutes in Tokyo, Taiwan, Hamburg and the United States.

A notable direct descendant of Yi is poet and independence activist Yi Yuksa, who is also an Andong native.

<doc id="342423" wikidata="Q5192766" url="?curid=342423" title="Cuisine of California">
<text>The cuisine of [[California]] reflects the diverse culture of California and is influenced largely by European American, Hispanic American (Mexican, Latin American, Spanish), East Asian and Oceanian influences (Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Filipino, Vietnamese, Thai, Hawaiian), and Western European influences (Italian, French, Portuguese), as well as the food trends and traditions of larger American cuisine.

The main trends were influenced by a combination of Mediterranean climate, geography and geology of the region&#x27;s proximity to the ocean, its movie roots in Hollywood, its technology roots in Silicon Valley and the Napa wine country, as well as its major produce production. California used to be part of Mexico which influenced the state&#x27;s food.

==Local ingredients==
Fresh fruits, vegetables, and meats – many of them organic – are commonplace. Their prevalence is driven by the local climate, which is largely a mild Mediterranean climate, and includes a variety of microclimates, as well as health-conscious diets and lifestyles.

In Northern California, with wine country nearby, French, Italian, and Mediterranean inspired food is prominent, as well as Asian-inspired fare. Many of the restaurants, cafes, bistros, and grills use ingredients sourced from local growers and farmers&#x27; markets. A unique sourdough-style bread has its origins in San Francisco.

The California coast, especially the North Coast and Central Coast regions, is a source of seafood, which is a staple in the California diet.

California produces almost all of the country&#x27;s almonds, apricots, dates, figs, kiwi fruit, nectarines, olives, pistachios, prunes, and walnuts. It leads in the production of avocados, grapes, lemons, melons, peaches, plums, and strawberries. This agricultural diversity of California&#x27;s Central Valley provides fresh produce in the state. With less than 1% of the total farmland in the US, the Central Valley produces 8% of the nation&#x27;s agricultural output by value.

&quot;Sunset&quot;, a lifestyle magazine of the West published in California, has featured recipes that have influenced the cuisine of California, including the promotion of outdoor eating.

==Shellfish and seafood==

In Northern California and the Central Coastal region, Dungeness crab is abundant. Sardines, oysters, and salmon were formerly major industries in the state, before declines in fish stocks. The Chinook salmon is native to California and are known to spawn in local rivers, however they are considered an endangered species in 2023.

== Asian and Oceanian influences ==
As one of the U.S. states nearest Asia and Oceania, and with long-standing Asian American and Oceanian American populations, the state tends to adopt foods from those national styles. The American style of sushi possibly began in California; the term &quot;California roll&quot; is used to describe sushi with avocado as a primary ingredient. 

East Asian confectionery such as mochi ice cream and boba have gained popularity throughout California and the United States, with many establishments that produce them beginning in California.

==Latino and Hispanic influence==
Because of California&#x27;s mostly colonial European Spanish roots, Mexican territorial history, and its original population consisting of Meso-Americans, Spanish colonizers and Mexican ranchers, Mexican and Spanish-origin cuisine is very influential and popular in California, particularly Southern California.

Commercial taquería-style Mexican fast food, consisting of offerings such as burritos, refried beans, tortas, tacos, nachos, and quesadillas, is widely popular. Taquerías can be found throughout California.

Traditional Mexican food, while not as common as commercial food, is still widely prepared and abundant in the ethnic Mexican American border communities of San Diego, the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the San Francisco Bay Area, and in Mexican-American enclaves throughout California. Examples of these foods include tamales, tortillas, &quot;tostadas&quot;, &quot;mole&quot;, &quot;menudo&quot;, &quot;pozole&quot;, &quot;sopes&quot;, &quot;chile relleno&quot; and enchiladas.

In addition to Mexican food, California restaurants serve up nearly every variation of Central American food there is. For example, &quot;pupuserías&quot; are common in areas with a large population of Salvadorans (&quot;pupusas&quot; are stuffed tortillas from El Salvador).

&quot;Fresh-Mex&quot; or &quot;Baja-style&quot; Mexican food, which places an emphasis on fresh ingredients and sometimes seafood, inspired by Baja California fare, is popular. El Pollo Loco, a fast-food chain that originated in Northern Mexico, is a common sight. Rubio&#x27;s Fresh Mexican Grill, Baja Fresh, Wahoo&#x27;s Fish Taco, Chronic Tacos, Chipotle, Qdoba and La Salsa are examples of the Baja-style Mexican-American food trend.

==Fusion cuisine==

Fusion cuisine is quite popular in California. The emphasis of California cuisine is on the use of fresh, local ingredients which are often acquired daily at farmers markets. Menus are changed to accommodate the availability of ingredients in season. Some restaurants create a new menu daily.

California chef Wolfgang Puck is known as one of the pioneers of fusion cuisine, popularizing such dishes as Chinese chicken salad at the restaurant Ma Maison in Los Angeles. His restaurant Chinois in Santa Monica was named after the term attributed to Richard Wing, who in the 1960s combined French and Chinese cooking at the former Imperial Dynasty restaurant in Hanford, California.

== Barbecue ==
Barbecue has been a part of California cuisine since Mexicans cooked beef in pit barbecues on ranches since the 1840s. Santa Maria, California, is famous for the tri-tip, a special kind of beef cut that can be grilled, baked, braised, or roasted.

California&#x27;s barbecue style is also influenced by the styles of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma, brought by Dust Bowl migrants. Chicken, beef ribs, sausages, and steaks are also grilled or smoked in a barbecue pit.

The barbecue sauce used in this state is tomato-based, as with all other western states. Santa Maria barbecue, however, uses no sauce, relying instead on the flavor of the tri-tip and the slow live-oak fire over which it is cooked.

Pork baby back ribs are popular for barbecue in the Western region in comparison to the popular use of spare ribs in the United States.

==Sandwiches, burgers, and fast food==
Southern California&#x27;s car culture and the population&#x27;s reliance on automobiles for transportation throughout California&#x27;s vast cities, has widely contributed to the popularity of the classic drive-in and modern drive-through restaurants. Fast food restaurant chains such as McDonald&#x27;s, Jack in the Box, In-N-Out Burger, Carl&#x27;s Jr., Wienerschnitzel, Del Taco, Taco Bell, Panda Express, Original Tommy&#x27;s, Fatburger, The Habit, and Big Boy were all established in Southern California.

Regional fast-food menus differ, generally depending on the ethnic composition of an area. In Southern California, smaller chains like The Hat feature hamburgers, Mexican food, chili fries, and pastrami. 

In Northern California, smaller chains like Gott&#x27;s Roadside feature Niman Ranch hamburgers with toppings like avocado, ahi burgers, salads, and they have a full wine bar with many local varieties; and the local chain Original Joe&#x27;s is a steakhouse that serves Italian-American food, which includes their noted dish Joe&#x27;s Special.

While gastropubs are not unique to California, the concept of the gourmet hamburger is very popular.

== Specific dishes ==

== World War I ==
VII Corps was organized at the end of World War I on 19 August 1918, at Remiremont, France and was inactivated on 11 July 1919. It was commanded by Major Generals William M. Wright, Omar Bundy, William G. Haan, and Henry Tureman Allen. It was composed of the 6th, 81st and 88th Divisions, and served in the Vosges Sector.

==Post-World War I==

The VII Corps was constituted in the Organized Reserve on 29 July 1921, allotted to the Seventh Corps Area, and assigned to the Third Army. Per General Order #2, Headquarters, Seventh Corps Area, the corps headquarters was activated on 9 January 1922 at the Old Customhouse, 3rd and Olive Streets, St. Louis, Missouri, with Regular Army and Organized Reserve personnel. The corps headquarters was responsible for providing and planning administration, organization, supply, and training for army, corps, and other nondivisional Reserve units, less field and coast artillery, in the Seventh Corps Area. The headquarters was relieved from active duty on 27 January 1923 and all Regular Army personnel were reassigned to the Headquarters, Non-Divisional Group, Seventh Corps Area, which assumed the responsibilities previously held by the VII Corps. Both the corps headquarters and headquarters company remained active in the Organized Reserve.

The VII Corps headquarters was withdrawn from the Organized Reserve on 15 August 1927 and allotted to the Regular Army. As part of the four-army plan put into effect on 1 October 1933, the VII Corps was relieved from the Third Army and assigned to the Fourth Army. Concurrently, the VII Corps headquarters was partially activated at Omaha, Nebraska, with Regular Army personnel assigned to Headquarters, Seventh Corps Area, and Reserve personnel from the corps area at large. On the same date, the headquarters company, VII Corps, was withdrawn from the Organized Reserve and allotted to the Regular Army. As a &quot;Regular Army Inactive&quot; unit, the corps headquarters was organized provisionally for short periods using its assigned Reserve officers and staff officers from Headquarters, Seventh Corps Area. These periods included several Second Army command post exercises (CPXs) in the 1930s and that part of the Fourth Army maneuvers held at Camp Ripley, Minnesota, in August 1937. The designated mobilization station for the corps headquarters from 1927 to 1939 was Camp Pike, Arkansas, where it would assume command and control of its assigned subordinate corps troops, which would then be mobilizing primarily in the Seventh Corps Area. Although the 1939 Protective Mobilization Plan changed the mobilization station for the corps headquarters to Fort Snelling, Minnesota.

== World War II ==

The headquarters, VII Corps, was activated on 25 November 1940, less Reserve personnel, at Fort McClellan, Alabama; the headquarters company had been activated there two weeks before on 10 November. At Fort McClellan, the VII Corps assumed command and control of the 27th, 33rd, and 35th Divisions. The corps headquarters was transferred on 25 January 1941 to the Ramsey Building at 19th Street and North E Avenue, Birmingham, Alabama. The corps participated in the Tennessee Maneuvers in May–June 1941 and the Louisiana Maneuvers in September–October 1941 as part of the Second Army. After the Louisiana Maneuvers, the corps headquarters returned to Birmingham, where it was located on 7 December 1941. In late December 1941, VII Corps headquarters was moved to San Jose, California as part of the Western Defense Command and as it continued to train and prepare for deployment.

Its first return to continental Europe took place on D-Day in June 1944, as one of the two assault corps for the U.S. First Army during Operation Overlord, targeting Utah Beach via amphibious assault. For Overlord, the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions were attached to VII Corps. After the Battle of Normandy the airborne units were assigned to the newly created XVIII Airborne Corps. Subsequently, VII Corps participated in many battles during the advance across France; this included taking 25,000 German prisoners during the Battle of the Mons Pocket in early September 1944. The corps subsequently took part in the invasion of Germany until the surrender of the Third Reich in May 1945. The corps was inactivated in 1946.

=== Battle of Normandy ===
For the Normandy Operation, VII Corps was part of 21st Army Group under the command of General Bernard Montgomery and the U.S. First Army commanded by Lieutenant General Courtney Hodges. The Corps was commanded by Major General J. Lawton Collins.

VII Corps led the initial assault of Operation Cobra, the First Army-led offensive as part of the breakout of the Normandy area. Its success is credited with changing the war in France from high-intensity infantry combat to rapid maneuver warfare. Elements of VII Corps saw much combat in the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest.

== Cold War ==


From reactivation in 1950 and throughout the Cold War, the corps guarded part of NATO&#x27;s front with the Warsaw Pact. Headquartered in Stuttgart at Kelley Barracks it was one of the two main US combat formations in Germany along with V Corps, which was headquartered in Frankfurt am Main at Abrams Building.

As finally envisaged in the General Defense Plan circa 1989, the 1st Canadian Division with its main headquarters at Kingston, Ontario, would have been assigned to the Commander, Central Army Group&#x27;s tactical reserve, fighting alongside either the German II Corps or VII Corps.

=== Structure 1989 ===
At the end of the Cold War in 1989 VII Corps consisted of the following units:

* VII Corps, Stuttgart, West Germany
** 1st Armored Division, Ansbach
** 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized), Fort Riley, Kansas (Exercise Reforger unit)
*** 1st Infantry Division (Forward), Göppingen, West Germany
** 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized), Würzburg
** VII Corps Artillery, Augsburg
*** 17th Field Artillery Brigade, Augsburg
*** 72nd Field Artillery Brigade, Wertheim

** 7th Engineer Brigade, Kornwestheim
** 14th Military Police Brigade, Kornwestheim
** 93rd Signal Brigade (Corps), Ludwigsburg

** 2nd Corps Support Command, Nellingen auf den Fildern
** 602nd Air Support Operations Group, USAF Stuttgart

== Gulf War ==

After Saddam Hussein&#x27;s troops invaded Kuwait in 1990, the corps was deployed to Saudi Arabia as part of the second major wave of deployments of American forces. Its presence took US forces in theatre from a force capable of defending Saudi Arabia to a force capable of ejecting Iraqi troops from Kuwait.

In the Gulf War, VII Corps was probably the most powerful formation of its type ever to take to the battlefield. Normally, a corps commands three divisions when at full strength, along with other units such as artillery of various types, corps-level engineers and support units. However, VII Corps had far more firepower under its command. It consisted of 1,487 tanks, 1,384 infantry fighting vehicles, 568 artillery pieces, 132 MLRS, 8 missile launchers, and 242 attack helicopters. It had a total troop strength of 146,321 troops.

Its principal full-strength fighting formations were the 1st Armored Division (United States), the 3rd Armored Division (United States) and the 1st Infantry Division (United States). The 2nd Armored Division (Forward) was assigned to the 1st Infantry Division as its third maneuver brigade. In addition, the corps had the 2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States) to act as a scouting and screening force, and two further heavy divisions, the 1st Cavalry Division (United States) and the British 1st Armoured Division, as well as the 11th Aviation Group. Although both 1st Cavalry Division and 1st Armoured Division had only two maneuver brigades, they were still powerful formations in their own right.

VII Corps was originally deployed to provide an offensive option if needed. In the 100-hour war they were given a mission: To destroy the Iraqi Republican Guard&#x27;s heavy divisions. That meant that the 1st Infantry Division had to make a forced entry to make room for the British attack on the right wing and to secure the main forces advance on the left. That attack force was led by the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment and Task Force 1-41 Infantry followed by the other two brigades of the 1st Infantry Division. The 1st Armored Division would head north to engage the Iraqi Republican Guard in the Battle of Medina Ridge. The 3rd Armored Division would protect the flank of the 1st Infantry Division. That gave VII Corps commander General Frederick M. Franks, Jr. a three division strike force to confront several Iraqi Armored Divisions. After the corps had turned 90 degrees east according to FRAGPLAN 7 and after the Cavalry Regiment had fought the single sided Battle of 73 Easting the three Divisions (plus the British on the right wing) fought one of the most one-sided battles in the history of the U.S. Army.

VII Corps cut a swath through Iraqi forces. It advanced with U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps on its left wing and Arab forces on its right wing. It pulverized all Iraqi forces that tried to stand and fight and destroyed a good proportion of the Iraqi Republican Guard divisions. This confrontation was known as the Battle of Norfolk.

VII Corps&#x27; attack destroyed several divisions including the Medina and the Tawakalna Republican Guards division along with support units. It also destroyed most of the Iraqi VII Corps that had guarded the frontline as well as other units. The Battle of 73 Easting was later studied as a textbook armored battle by U.S. staff colleges. The cost in lives was 36 US and UK dead; trifling, in terms of expected casualties, for the war the two armies had trained for against the Soviets.

Virtually every manoeuvre battalion in the 1st and 3rd Armored Divisions, 1st Inf Div (M), and 2 ACR received the Valorous Unit Award. In addition, six of the ten VII Corps manoeuvre brigade headquarters that saw substantial combat against the Republican Guard received the VUA in contravention of the spirit, if not the letter, of AR672-5-1&#x27;s guidance that &quot;[o]nly on rare occasions will a unit larger than a battalion qualify for award of the VUA.&quot;

During the Gulf War VII Corps destroyed nearly 1,350 Iraqi tanks, 1,224 armored troop carriers, 285 artillery pieces, 105 air defense systems, 1,229 trucks, and lost nearly 36 armored vehicles. They suffered a total of 47 dead and 192 wounded.

== Redeployment and inactivation ==
After the fighting was over, most VII Corps units were redeployed directly to the United States for reassignment or inactivation. VII Corps HQ returned to Germany and was disbanded as part of the post-Cold War American defense spending cuts. Some VII Corps units remained in Germany and were reassigned to V Corps or USAREUR. A farewell ceremony was held in downtown Stuttgart at Schlossplatz, where the VII Corps colors were retired on 18 March 1992. The official inactivation was held at Fort McPherson, Ga., in April 1992.

<text>The Namibia dollar (symbol: $ or N$; code: NAD) has been the currency of Namibia since 1993. It is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign ($), or alternatively N$ to distinguish it from other currencies called “dollar.” It is divided into 100 cents.

== History ==

The dollar replaced the South African rand, which had been the country&#x27;s currency while it was under South African rule as South-West Africa from 1920 until 1990, at par. The rand is still legal tender, as the Namibian dollar is linked to the South African rand and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis locally. Namibia was also part of the Common Monetary Area from independence in 1990 until the introduction of the dollar in 1993.

In the beginning, alternative names for the Namibian dollar were suggested, including &quot;Namibian kalahar&quot;, referencing the Kalahari Desert in the east of Namibia, but ultimately the government settled on the name &quot;Namibian dollar&quot;. The first notes were issued on 15 September 1993.

The Bank of Namibia issued the first banknotes on 15 September 1993 and, in December, issued the first national coins.

== Coins ==
Coins in circulation

Years of mintage are 1993, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2015. The cent coins are made of nickel plated steel and the dollar coins of brass. From January 2019, 5c coins are no longer produced, but they are still used for daily transactions.

== Banknotes ==

The following banknotes are currently in circulation:
* N$10
* N$20
* N$30
* N$50
* N$100
* N$200

Historically, Kaptein Hendrik Witbooi, once chief of the Namaqua people and instrumental in leading the revolts against German rule at the turn of the 20th century, has been depicted on all Namibian banknotes. However, on 21 March 2012, the Bank of Namibia introduced a new series of banknotes to be issued in May 2012. The new family of banknotes will have the same denomination structure as the current series. All denominations have improved anti-counterfeiting features, and the portrait of Kaptein Hendrik Witbooi is retained for all but the 10 and 20 dollar notes, which feature a new portrait of Sam Nujoma, the founding president and father of the Namibian nation.

The Bank of Namibia has discovered that the diamond-shaped optically variable ink patch on the N$10 and N$20 notes was cracking after multiple folding and handling. The Bank of Namibia has recently issued in limited quantity, the N$10 and N$20 notes on paper with improved quality and shifted the placement of the diamond-shaped optically variable ink feature.

On 21 March 2020, the Bank of Namibia unveiled a new 30 dollar polymer note to commemorate the 30th anniversary of independence. The theme of the note is &#x27;3 Decades of Peace and Stability&#x27;, represented by the smooth transition of power between the three presidents since independence.

==Test coins==

During the planning phase of the introduction of a new national currency replacing the South African rand, the newly founded Bank of Namibia minted a proof series of coins denominated in dollars as well as in marks, for the consideration of the Namibian Ministry of Finance. The decision then fell in favour of the name ‘dollar’ for the new currency.

The proof series consisted of four different coins: 1 mark, 1 dollar (both in copper/nickel), 10 marks and 10 dollars (both in silver). The obverse of the mark pieces shows a sitting lion where the dollar pieces depict a San (Bushman) with bow and arrow. All obverse sides bear the indication of denomination as well as the remark ‘PROBE’/‘ESSAI’ (proof). The reverse of the 1-mark/1-dollar pieces shows Namibia&#x27;s former coat of arms surrounded by the inscription ‘NAMIBIA’, the year (1990) and two ears of corn. The ten-mark/ten-dollar pieces bear the inscription ‘INDEPENDENCE’/‘UNABHÄNGIGKEIT’ (&quot;independence&quot; in German) instead of the ears.

There was a series of Namibian pattern coins denominated in Rand dated 1990. This short-lived tender was cited in the 2005 edition of Krause&#x27;s &#x27;Unusual World Coins&#x27;.

In 1918, a wing of two Canadian squadrons called the Canadian Air Force (CAF) was formed in England and attached to the Royal Air Force, but it also would never see wartime service. Postwar, an air militia also known as the Canadian Air Force was formed in Canada in 1920. In 1924 the CAF was renamed the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) when it was granted the royal title by King George V. The RCAF existed as an independent service until 1968.

The modern Royal Canadian Air Force, formerly known as Canadian Forces Air Command, traces its history to the unification of Canada&#x27;s armed services in 1968, and is one of three environmental commands of the Canadian Forces. The Royal Canadian Air Force has served in the Second World War, the Korean War, and several United Nations peacekeeping missions and NATO operations. The force maintained a presence in Europe through the second half of the 20th century.

== Beginnings ==
=== Beginning years ===

The first heavier-than-air, powered aircraft flight in Canada and the British Empire occurred on 23 February 1909 when Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s &quot;Silver Dart&quot; took off from the ice of Bras d&#x27;Or Lake at Baddeck, Nova Scotia with J.A.D. McCurdy at the controls. The 1/2-mile flight was followed by a longer flight of 20 miles on 10 March 1909.

McCurdy and his partner F. W. &quot;Casey&quot; Baldwin had formed the Canadian Aerodrome Company, and they hoped that the Department of Militia and Defence would be interested in buying the company&#x27;s aircraft. Two staff officers at Militia Headquarters were interested in using aircraft for military use, and so the aviators were invited to Camp Petawawa to demonstrate their aircraft. On 2 August 1909, the &quot;Silver Dart&quot; made four successful flights; however, on the fourth flight McCurdy wrecked the craft on landing when one wheel struck a rise in the ground. The Silver Dart never flew again. A second aircraft, the &quot;Baddeck No.1&quot;, was flown a few days later, but was severely damaged on its second landing. Before the accidents, however, the &quot;Silver Dart&quot; made the first passenger flight aboard a heavier-than-air aircraft in Canada when McCurdy flew with Baldwin. After the crashes, the militia department showed no interest in aircraft. It was not until the First World War that the Canadian government became interested in military aviation.

=== First World War ===
At the beginning of the First World War on 4 August 1914, Canada became involved in the conflict by virtue of Britain&#x27;s declaration. Some European nations were using aircraft for military purposes and Canada&#x27;s Minister of Militia and Defence, Sam Hughes, who was organizing the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), inquired how Canada could assist military aviation. London answered with a request for six experienced pilots immediately, but Hughes was unable to fill the requirement.

Hughes did authorize the creation of a small aviation unit to accompany the CEF to Britain and on 16 September 1914, the Canadian Aviation Corps (CAC), which was formed with two officers, one mechanic, and $5000 to purchase an aircraft from the Burgess Company in Massachusetts, for delivery to Valcartier, near Quebec City. The Burgess-Dunne biplane was delivered on 1 October 1914, and was shipped immediately to England. On arrival, the biplane was transported to Salisbury Plain where the CEF was marshalled for training. The craft never flew. It quickly deteriorated in the damp winter climate. By May 1915, the CAC no longer existed.

During the First World War over 20,000 Canadians volunteered to serve with the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Royal Naval Air Service, producing such aces as William Barker, W.A. &quot;Billy&quot; Bishop, Naval Pilot Raymond Collishaw, Roy Brown, Donald MacLaren, Frederick McCall, and Wilfrid &quot;Wop&quot; May. In 1917 the RFC opened training airfields in Canada to recruit and train Canadian airmen. The Canadian government advanced the RFC money to open an aircraft factory in Toronto, Canadian Aeroplanes, but did not otherwise take part.

In 1915, Britain suggested that Canada should consider raising its own air units. However, it was not until spring 1918 that the Canadian government proposed forming a wing of eight squadrons for service with the Canadian Corps in France. Rather than the proposed eight squadrons, the British Air Ministry formed two Canadian squadrons (one bomber, one fighter). On 19 September 1918, the Canadian government authorized the creation of the Canadian Air Force (CAF) to take control of these two squadrons (eventually to become No 1 Wing, CAF) under the command of Canada&#x27;s Lieutenant-Colonel Billy Bishop, the leading ace of the British Empire and the first Canadian aviator awarded the Victoria Cross. In June 1919 the British government cut funding to the squadrons, and in February 1920, the CAF in Europe was disbanded, never having flown any operations.

There had been some thought that these two European squadrons would be the nucleus of a new Canadian air force. However, on 30 May 1919 the Canadian government decided against a new military air force because it was felt none was needed.

== Establishment ==

=== Air Board and the Canadian Air Force ===
Because of Canada&#x27;s involvement with aviation during the First World War, the government felt obliged to further its responsibilities related to aviation in Canada. It was thought that since Canada had a large supply of trained personnel and equipment because of the war, government responsibilities could be better enabled by facilitating civil (non-military) aviation. As early as October 1917 a government committee, the Reconstruction and Development Committee, was established to examine issues related to transportation, including air transportation, in the post-war era. The future of civil aviation was also determined by Canada&#x27;s commitment to the International Convention for Air Navigation, part of the convention signed by Britain in Paris in 1919. Canada was required to control air navigation and traffic within its borders. For these reasons, Canada instituted the Air Board, whose task was mainly regulatory but it was also responsible for controlling civil aviation and handling air defence.

One of the Air Board&#x27;s first responsibilities was managing the operation of over 100 surplus aircraft that had been gifted to Canada by the British Government to help Canada with air defence. Several flying boat aircraft and other equipment had also been donated to Canada by the Americans who had temporarily established naval air stations on the east coast pending formation of the Royal Canadian Naval Air Service. The Air Board decided to operate these aircraft in support of civil operations such as forestry, photographic surveying, and anti-smuggling patrols. Six air stations were established by the Air Board in 1920–21 for civil flying operations: Jericho Beach, Morley (later moved to High River), Ottawa, Dartmouth, Victoria Beach and Roberval.

The Air Board&#x27;s venture into air defence consisted of providing refresher training to former wartime pilots via a small part-time, non-permanent air militia known as the Canadian Air Force (CAF) at the old Royal Flying Corps air station, Camp Borden. Political thinking at the time was that proposing a permanent military air service, especially during peacetime, would not be popular with the public. This training scheme began in July 1920 and ended in March 1922 with no new pilots trained.

In 1922, the Air Board with its CAF branch, the Department of Militia and Defence, and the Department of Naval Services were amalgamated to form the Department of National Defence. The CAF became a new organization and by January 1923 when the reorganization was finalized, the CAF became responsible for all flying operations in Canada, including civil aviation. The CAF itself was also reorganized, effective 1 July 1922. On 25 November 1922, the six Air Board stations were declared CAF stations.

=== Royal Canadian Air Force ===
The thought that the Canadian Air Force should become &quot;Royal&quot; was first generated when the Australian Air Force became &quot;Royal&quot; in August 1921. Formal application to change the title was made on 5 January 1923, and on 15 February 1923, Canada was notified that King George V had granted the title. The Canadian Government, however, did not officially recognize the granting of the new title, &quot;Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF)&quot;, until 1 April 1924.

With this designation, Canada&#x27;s air force became a permanent component of Canada&#x27;s defence forces. The new air force was to be organized into a permanent force and an auxiliary or non-permanent Force (Non-Permanent Active Air Force, or NPAAF), but the NPAAF did not become active for another eight years. The RCAF replaced the Air Board and the CAF as the regulator of Canadian civil aviation and continued civil tasks such as anti-smuggling patrols, forest fire watches, aerial forest spraying, mail delivery, mercy flights, law enforcement, and surveying/aerial photography, and there was some training. A major undertaking by the RCAF during 1927–28 was the &quot;Hudson Strait Expedition&quot; whose purpose was to investigate ice movements and navigation conditions in the Hudson Strait in preparation for the possible creation of a major shipping port on Hudson Bay at Churchill, Manitoba. Another notable operation involved assisting the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in curtailing rum-running. Liquor, destined to the United States during the American Prohibition era, was being landed on Nova Scotia&#x27;s remote coasts. Aircraft patrols meant to prevent this activity accounted for almost half of the civil flying carried out by the RCAF in 1932.

In 1927 the management of aviation in Canada was reorganized so that the RCAF, now considered to be a military body, did not control civil flying. A new government branch, the &quot;Civil Government Air Operations&quot; (CGAO) Branch, was formed to manage air operations that supported civil departments. However, the RCAF administered the branch, and supplied almost all the aircraft and personnel. The RCAF continued to support the CGAO until the Department of Transport assumed responsibility for supporting civil departments or until these departments instituted their own flying services.

Budget cuts in the early 1930s affected personnel strength, airfield construction, pilot training, aircraft purchases and operational flying. The &quot;Big Cut&quot; of 1932 was especially devastating to the RCAF. The NPAAF was finally formed in 1932 in response to the budget cuts. The air force began to rebuild throughout the 1930s, however, and priorities were aimed at increasing the strength of the RCAF as a military organization rather than improving it to better support civil air operations. New aircraft were ordered and new air stations were built. Ten auxiliary squadrons were formed between 1932 and 1938. The RCAF expanded or combined its units, and regional commands were implemented.

By the end of the 1930s the RCAF was not a major military force. Aircraft were obsolete, and the RCAF had no experience in military operations. Although new pilots and other personnel had been trained, manpower was still lacking. Many of these problems would be surmounted with the implementation of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP) during the Second World War.

== Second World War ==
The outbreak of the Second World War saw the RCAF fielding eight of its eleven permanent operational squadrons, but by October 1939 15 squadrons were available (12 for homeland defence, three for overseas service). Twenty types of aircraft were in service at this point, over half being for training or transport, and the RCAF started the war with only 29 front-line fighter and bomber aircraft. The RCAF reached peak strength of 215,000 (all ranks) in January 1944. By the end of the war the RCAF would be the fourth largest Allied air force. Approximately 13,000 RCAF personnel were killed while on operations or died as prisoners of war. Another 4000 died during training or from other causes.

During the war, the RCAF was involved in three areas: the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP), home defence, and overseas operations.
=== British Commonwealth Air Training Plan ===

In 1939, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand agreed to train aircrew for wartime service. The training plan, known as the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP), was administered by the Canadian government and commanded by the RCAF; however, a supervisory board with representatives of each of the four involved countries protected the interests of the other three countries. Training airfields and other facilities were located throughout Canada. Although some aircrew training took place in other Commonwealth countries, Canada&#x27;s training facilities supplied the majority of aircrew for overseas operational service. Schools included initial training schools, elementary flying training schools, service flying training schools, flying instructor&#x27;s schools, general reconnaissance schools, operational training units, wireless schools, bombing and gunnery schools, a flight engineers&#x27; school, air navigation schools, air observer schools, radio direction finding (radar) schools, specialist schools, and a few supplementary schools. The BCATP contributed over 130,000 aircrew to the war effort.
=== Home defence ===
Home defence was overseen by two commands of the Home War Establishment: Western Air Command and Eastern Air Command. Located on the west and east coasts of Canada, these commands grew to 37 squadrons, and were responsible for protecting Canada&#x27;s coasts from enemy attack and for protecting allied shipping. Threats included German U-boats along the east coast and in Atlantic shipping lanes and the potential of attack by Japanese forces. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, more squadrons were deployed to the west. Canadian units were sent to Alaska to assist the Americans in Alaska&#x27;s defence during the Aleutian Islands Campaign.
====Domestic RCAF squadron codes 1939–1945====
=== Overseas operations ===

Forty-eight RCAF squadrons were involved in overseas operational duties in Britain, northwest Europe, North Africa, and Southeast Asia. These squadrons participated in most roles, including fighter, night fighter, fighter intruder, reconnaissance, anti-shipping, anti-submarine, strategic bombing, transport, and fighter-bomber. RCAF squadrons often included non-RCAF personnel, and RCAF personnel were also members of Royal Air Force (RAF) squadrons. High-scoring Canadian fighter pilots include George Beurling, Don Laubman, James (Stocky) Edwards and Robert Fumerton.

The RCAF played key roles in the Battle of Britain, antisubmarine warfare during the Battle of the Atlantic, the bombing campaigns against German industries (notably with No. 6 Group, RAF Bomber Command), and close support of Allied forces during the Battle of Normandy and subsequent land campaigns in northwest Europe. RCAF squadrons and personnel were also involved with operations in Egypt, Italy, Sicily, Malta, Ceylon, India, and Burma.

By October 1942, the RCAF had five bomber squadrons serving with Bomber Command. 425 Squadron was made up of French-Canadians, through English was the language of command for all squadrons. In January 1943, 11 bomber squadrons were formed by transferring all of the Canadians serving in the RAF to RCAF, which became No. 6 Group RCAF of Bomber Command under Air Vice-Marshal G.E. Brookes. The air crews serving in 6 Group were based in the Vale of York, requiring longer flights to Germany. The Vale of York was also a region inclined to be foggy and icy in the winter, making take-off and landings dangerous. Furthermore, 6 Group continued to fly obsolete Wellington and Halifax bombers and only received their first Lancaster bombers in August 1943.

No. 6 Group lost 100 bombers in air raids over Germany, suffering a 7% loss ratio. Morale suffered because of the heavy losses, with many bombers became unserviceable, failed to take off or returned early. On the night of 20 January 1944, 6 Group was ordered to bomb Berlin. Of the 147 bombers ordered to bomb Berlin, 3 could not take off, 17 turned back over the North Sea, and nine were shot down. The next night, when 125 bombers were ordered to strike Berlin, 11 failed to take off, 12 turned back and 24 were shot down over Germany. The losses together with the morale problems were felt to be almost a crisis, which led to a new commander for 6 Group being appointed.

On February 29, 1944, Air Vice-Marshal C.M &quot;Black Mike&quot; McEwen took command of 6 Group and brought about improved navigational training and better training for the ground crews. In March 1944, the bombing offensive against Germany was stopped and Bomber Command began bombing targets in France as a prelude to Operation Overlord As France was closer to Britain than Germany, this required shorter flights and imposed less of a burden on the bomber crews.

Only in October 1944 did the strategic bombing offensive resume and 6 Group went back to bombing German cities. By the end of 1944, 6 Group was suffering the lowest losses of any of the Bomber Command groups and the highest accuracy in bombing targets. Altogether, 9,980 Canadians were killed in bombing raids against German cities between 1940 and 1945, making the strategic bombing offensive one of the most costly operations for Canada in World War II. 


====Overseas RCAF squadron codes 1940–1945 (400-series)====

== Cold War ==
By spring 1945, the BCATP was discontinued and the RCAF was reduced from 215,000 to 164,846 (all ranks) and by VJ Day on 2 September 1945, it was proposed that the RCAF maintain a peacetime strength of 16,000 (all ranks) and eight squadrons. By the end of 1947 the RCAF had five squadrons and close to 12,000 personnel (all ranks). Peacetime activities resumed and the RCAF participated in such pursuits as aerial photography, mapping and surveying, transportation, search and rescue, and mercy missions. In March 1947 the RCAF&#x27;s first helicopters, several Sikorsky H-5s, were delivered, which were used for training and search and rescue. Interest in the Arctic led to several northern military expeditions supported by the RCAF.

By the end of 1948, the Soviet bloc was perceived as a serious threat to security in Europe. The Cold War had begun and peacetime activities were no longer a priority for the air force. The Canadian government began preparing to meet this threat. In December 1948 the government decided to increase the number of RCAF establishments, increase the size of and recondition existing air stations, recruit additional personnel, and obtain and produce new (jet) aircraft. Although the RCAF had a jet fighter in 1948, the British de Havilland Vampire, it would be replaced, beginning in 1951 by the more effective Sabre, built under licence by Canadair. The new Avro CF-100 &quot;Canuck&quot; was also built and entered squadron service in April 1953. The RCAF was the first air force to operate jet transportation aircraft with two Comets entering service in 1953. Re-equipping and expansion of the air force led to the government abandoning its plans for just eight squadrons.

In April 1949 Canada joined NATO, and as part of its military commitment established an Air Division (No. 1 Air Division) in Europe consisting of four wings. The first wing to form, No. 1 Fighter Wing, was established at North Luffenham, England in 1951, but later moved to Marville, France. Other RCAF wings quickly followed, with bases established at Grostenquin (No. 2 Fighter Wing), France; Zweibrücken (No. 3 Fighter Wing), West Germany; and Baden-Soellingen (No. 4 Fighter Wing), West Germany. Each of these wings consisted of three fighter squadrons. The backbone of RCAF support to NATO&#x27;s air forces in Europe in the 1950s were the CF-100 and the Sabre. Until 1958 the RCAF also trained aircrew from other NATO countries under the NATO Air Training Plan.

In 1950, the RCAF was heavily involved with the transportation of personnel and supplies in support of the Korean War. The RCAF was not involved with a combat role since no jet fighter squadrons capable of the type of combat required in Korea were yet in service, and capable fighter squadrons that later did become operational were allocated to NATO duty in Europe. Twenty-two RCAF fighter pilots, however, flew on exchange duty with the USAF in Korea. Several, including Squadron Leader Joseph A.O. &quot;Omer&quot; Levesque, and Flight Lieutenant E. A. &quot;Ernie&quot; Glover scored air-to-air victories.

The Soviet nuclear threat posed by a growing bomber fleet in the early 1950s saw the USAF and RCAF partner to build the Pinetree Line network of early warning radar stations across Canada at roughly the 50° north parallel of latitude with additional stations along the east and west coasts. This was expanded in the mid-1950s with the building of the Mid-Canada Line at roughly the 55° north parallel, and finally in the late-1950s and into the early 1960s the DEW Line was built across the Arctic regions of North America. The nature of the Soviet bomber threat and of other hostile incursions into North American airspace saw an RCAF and USAF partnership in the creation of the North American Air (Aerospace, after 1981) Defense Command (NORAD) which was formed on 1 August 1957.

The Soviet bomber threat posed to North America also saw the RCAF begin the development of the Avro CF-105 Arrow fighter-interceptor. The changing nature of the Soviet threat from bombers to ICBMs in the late 1950s, and pressure from the United States, saw the CF-105 program scrapped in favour of Bomarc nuclear-tipped anti-aircraft missiles.

To improve its abilities, the RCAF began replacing its 1950s-era aircraft with smaller numbers of second-generation aircraft. For instance, for air defence, the CF-101 Voodoo armed with the AIR-2 Genie nuclear-armed air-to-air missile replaced the CF-100, and Sabres were replaced by the CF-104 Starfighter, which served in a strike/reconnaissance role.

Coastal defence and peacekeeping support were also important. Maritime patrol squadrons stationed on Canada&#x27;s east and west coasts were provided with Lancasters, and later Neptune, and Argus aircraft to carry on anti-submarine operations. The RCAF&#x27;s peacekeeping role mainly included the transportation of troops, supplies, and truce observers to troubled areas of the world.

Many RCAF aerobatic or flight demonstration teams existed during this period. These include the Blue Devils (flying Vampires), the Fireballs (an Air Division team flying Sabres), the Sky Lancers (an Air Division team flying Sabres), the Golden Hawks (flying Sabres), the Goldilocks (flying Harvards), and the Golden Centennaires (flying Tutors).

Because of the Cold War and the Korean War, the RCAF grew to a strength of 54,000 personnel (all ranks) by 1954 and reached a 1955 peak of 41 squadrons.
===Unification and Air Command===
In 1964 the Canadian government began to reorganize Canada&#x27;s armed forces with the aim of integrating the RCAF with the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) and the Canadian Army to form the unified Canadian Forces. The purpose of the merger was to reduce costs and increase operating efficiency. The Minister of National Defence, Paul Hellyer stated on 4 November 1966 that &quot;the amalgamation...will provide the flexibility to enable Canada to meet in the most effective manner the military requirements of the future. It will also establish Canada as an unquestionable leader in the field of military organization.&quot; A new National Defence Act was passed in April 1967. On 1 February 1968 the Canadian Forces Reorganization Act came into effect and the RCAF ceased to exist. The three branches of the Canadian Forces were unified into a single service with the aim of improving Canada&#x27;s military effectiveness and flexibility.

Six commands were established for the unified forces:

1. Mobile Command was composed of former Canadian Army ground forces, as well as the army&#x27;s tactical helicopters (CH-135 Twin Huey, CH-136 Kiowa, CH-147 Chinook, CH-113A Voyageur) and CF-5 tactical and ground attack aircraft.

2. Maritime Command operated aircraft in support of former RCN vessels as well as maritime patrol and reconnaissance missions, including CH-124 Sea King, CP-107 Argus, and the CP-121 Tracker.

3. Air Defence Command consisted primarily of CF-101 Voodoo fighter-interceptor aircraft and the radar networks of DEW Line, Mid-Canada Line and Pinetree Line early warning stations.

4. Air Transport Command was responsible for strategic airlift and refueling aircraft. Its primary role was the transportation of Mobile Command ground troops to and from distant conflict zones. The CC-137 Husky was used in this capacity.

5. Training Command was responsible for aircrew and trades training across all commands in the armed forces.

6. Materiel Command provided maintenance and supply support to the other commands.

Along with these six new commands, Communications Systems and Canadian Forces Europe were formed. Communications Systems was formed into a command in 1970. In 1971, the Snowbirds aerobatic team, flying the CT-114 Tutor trainer, was formally created to demonstrate the flying skills of Canadian air force personnel. The team continues the flying demonstration tradition of previous Canadian air force aerobatic teams. The Snowbirds were designated a squadron (No. 431 Air Demonstration Squadron) in 1978.

On 2 September 1975, the Canadian Forces transferred the air assets of all commands to a newly formed Air Command (AIRCOM). Air Defence Command and Air Transport Command were abolished. In their place, Air Defence Group and Air Transport Group were formed and made subordinate to Air Command. The air assets of Maritime Command were transferred to a newly formed Maritime Air Group. Air training became the responsibility of a newly created 14 Air Training Group and the air assets of Mobile Command were transferred to a newly formed 10 Tactical Air Group. No. 1 Canadian Air Group was formed in Europe to control all air assets there. AIRCOM closely resembled the old RCAF as the new command handled all the aviation requirements of Canada&#x27;s military.
Several bases closed during the 1970s–1990s as aircraft changes took place. As CF-18A/B Hornet tactical fighter bombers were acquired, CF-104 Starfighter and CF-101 Voodoo aircraft were retired in the early-mid-1980s, leading to the closing of CFB Chatham and CFB Baden Soellingen and various bombing ranges. The CF-116 fighter aircraft and Boeing 707 transport/refuelling aircraft were retired. Also, over the years, the stations of the three radar early warning lines were modernized or closed. In the late 1970s AIRCOM replaced the CP-107 Argus and CP-121 Tracker with the CP-140 Aurora/CP-140A Arcturus maritime patrol aircraft.

==Post-Cold War period==

Following the end of the Cold War, government cutbacks along with the shift of east coast maritime squadrons and units from CFB Summerside to CFB Greenwood led to the closure of CFB Summerside in 1991. Canadian Forces Europe was shut down in 1994.

In the early 1990s, AIRCOM transport and utility helicopters in support of army operations were cut back and consolidated with the purchase of the CH-146 Griffon, replacing the CH-135 Twin Huey, CH-136 Kiowa, and CH-147 Chinook. The CH-137 Husky was replaced by the Airbus CC-150 Polaris in 1997.

Search and rescue squadrons received new aircraft when the CH-149 Cormorant replaced the CH-113 Labrador beginning in 2002. The CC-115 Buffalo was replaced in the 2000s with the CC-130 Hercules at CFB Trenton and CFB Greenwood, but are still used on the west coast. Ship-borne anti-submarine helicopter squadrons are currently operating the CH-124 Sea King.

In 2007 and 2008, four C-17 Globemaster IIIs, based at CFB Trenton, were added to improve transportation capabilities. Seventeen CC-130J Super Hercules tactical transport aircraft were acquired by May 2012.

On 1 July 31, 1997, all previous groups were eliminated and placed under No. 1 Canadian Air Division/Canadian NORAD Region. The new operational structure was based on 11 operational &quot;wings&quot; located across Canada. On 25 June 2009, 2 Canadian Air Division (2 CAD) was established to be responsible for air force training and doctrine. Units forming 2 CAD include: 15 Wing Moose Jaw, 16 Wing Borden and the Canadian Aerospace Warfare Centre located at 8 Wing Trenton.

On 16 July 2010, the Canadian government announced that the replacement for the CF-18 will be the American F-35. Sixty-five would be ordered; they would be based at CFB Bagotville and CFB Cold Lake.
On 16 August 2011, the Canadian government announced that the name &quot;Air Command&quot; was being changed to the air force&#x27;s original historic name: Royal Canadian Air Force. The change was made to better reflect Canada&#x27;s military heritage and align Canada with other key Commonwealth countries whose militaries use the royal designation.

From March to November 2011, six CF-18 Hornet fighter jets, two Boeing CC-177 Globemasters, two CP-140 Auroras, and approximately 250 Canadian Forces personnel were deployed as part of Operation Mobile, Canada&#x27;s response to the Libyan uprising. Air Command helped maintain a no-fly zone as part of Operation Odyssey Dawn. Canadian CF-18s carried out bomb strikes on Libyan military installations.

In 2014, RCAF aircraft became involved with supplying military supplies to Iraq as part of Operation Impact. Several CF-18s have been conducting combat air strikes.

== Victoria Cross recipients ==
The Victoria Cross (VC) is the highest award given to British and Commonwealth armed forces personnel of any rank in any service, and civilians under military command for bravery in the presence of the enemy. This honour has been granted to two members of the Royal Canadian Air Force since its inception in 1924.
*Pilot Officer Andrew Charles Mynarski, for valour during action over Cambrai, France, 12 June 1944.
*Flight Lieutenant David Ernest Hornell, for valour during action near the Faroe Islands, 24 June 1944.

== Women in the RCAF ==

The Canadian Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (CWAAF) was formed in 1941 to take over positions that would allow more men to participate in wartime training and combat duties. The unit&#x27;s name was changed to the Royal Canadian Air Force Women&#x27;s Division (WD) in 1942. Although the Women&#x27;s Division was discontinued in 1946 after wartime service, women were permitted to enter the RCAF in 1951 when the air force was expanding to meet Canada&#x27;s NATO commitments. Women were accepted as military pilots in 1980, and Canada became the first Western country to allow women to be fighter pilots in 1988.

== Symbols, insignia and markings ==
=== Roundels ===
The RCAF used British roundels and other markings until 1946, when Canada began using its own insignia identity. The British roundel existed in several versions. During the Second World War the red circle was painted out or reduced in size on some aircraft active in the Pacific theatre to avoid confusion with the Japanese Hinomaru. Roundels were also modified to be less visible on camouflaged aircraft or to make them more visible.

Canada was the first Commonwealth country to dispense with the RAF system. The maple leaf replaced the British-style inner circle to give it a distinctive Canadian character. Although the maple leaf roundel was approved for use by the RCAF in 1924, it was not until after the war that it began to be used on aircraft. It was, however, used on the ensign beginning in 1941. Popularization of the &quot;maple leaf&quot; roundel during the war years was partly achieved through unofficial means, as the Ottawa RCAF Flyers hockey team wore a variant of the future RCAF &quot;maple leaf&quot; roundel on team sweaters. Following the Second World War, from 1946 to 1948 a roundel with a red leaf set inside a blue disk (referred to as the RCAF Type 1 roundel) was used on non-camouflaged aircraft. Several versions of the maple leaf roundel existed from wartime to 1965. Sizes of the leaf and the ring thickness sometimes changed, and some versions of the RCAF roundel included a white or yellow outline, which were specific to certain aircraft.

The realistic-looking &quot;silver maple&quot; style of leaf (referred to as the &quot;RCAF&quot; roundel) was replaced with the eleven-point stylized leaf of the new Canadian flag in February 1965 (referred to as the &quot;CAF&quot; roundel). A slightly modified standardized version of this roundel (referred to as the &quot;CAF revision E&quot; roundel) was used by Air Command, and continues to be used by the &quot;new&quot; RCAF. An all-red &quot;unification roundel&quot; was used on a few aircraft from 1967 to 1968. Like the RCAF roundel, this new roundel sometimes changed – mainly in the size of the leaf and ring thickness, and one version had a white ring, which was used on certain aircraft. The current RCAF also uses a low visibility tactical grey roundel.

RCAF aircraft used the British fin flash, which consisted of red and blue vertical bands separated by a white band. In 1955 the red ensign Canadian Flag began replacing the fin flash on aircraft based in Europe. On Canada-based aircraft the flag began replacing the flash in 1958. Beginning in 1965 the new Canadian flag was used.
=== Ensign ===

The ensign of the original Royal Canadian Air Force was based on the RAF ensign, a light (sky) blue ensign, but with the Canadian roundel. Until the Second World War the RAF ensign was used by the RCAF; the RCAF ensign with the maple leaf roundel began to be used in 1941. The flag was discontinued when Canada&#x27;s armed services were unified, but a modified version with the revised roundel and Canadian flag was re-adopted by Air Command 1985. The current RCAF maintains use of this ensign.
=== Badge ===

The badge of the original RCAF was similar to that used by the RAF, the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal New Zealand Air Force. It consists of the Imperial Crown, an &quot;eagle volant&quot; (flying eagle), a circle which was formerly inscribed from 1924 to 1968 with the RCAF&#x27;s motto &quot;per ardua ad astra&quot; (which is usually translated as &quot;Through Adversity to the Stars&quot;) - this was changed in 1968 to &quot;Sic itur ad astra&quot;, translating to &quot;such is the pathway to the stars&quot;; in use to this day - and a scroll inscribed with &quot;Royal Canadian Air Force&quot;. The RCAF began using a modified version of the RAF badge in 1924. Once it was learned the badge had never been officially sanctioned, the Chester Herald prepared an improved design, and in January 1943 the badge was approved by the King.

The original badge disappeared when the services were unified. Air Command adopted a new design consisting of the imperial crown, an eagle &quot;rising to sinister from the Canadian Astral crown&quot; on an azure background, the Crown of Stars, which represents Air Command, and a new motto. This badge was replaced by a new badge in September 2013. The new badge includes the eagle volant used in the pre-unification RCAF badge.

=== Tartan ===
The Royal Canadian Air Force Tartan was designed by Kinloch Anderson Ltd. in Edinburgh, Scotland at the request of the RCAF, and is based on the Anderson tartan. Colors are primarily dark blue, light blue, and maroon. The design was officially endorsed by the Air Council in May 1942. The tartan was used on RCAF pipe band kilts and on other articles of clothing and regalia. After unification of Canada&#x27;s armed forces, the tartan continued to be used.

== Ranks and uniforms ==

=== Ranks ===
The original Royal Canadian Air Force used a rank structure similar to that of the Royal Air Force, with the exceptions, in the enlisted ranks, of the RCAF having the ranks of warrant officer 1 and 2, not having the ranks of senior aircraftman or junior technician, and not distinguishing between aircrew and non-aircrew for sergeants and above. The rank structure is almost identical to that of the Royal Australian Air Force, once again with the exception of warrant officer 2. RCAF Women&#x27;s Division personnel used a different rank structure. When the age limit for British Commonwealth Air Training Plan aircrew recruits was lowered to seventeen in 1941, the recruits were placed into the temporary rank of &quot;boy&quot; until they reached their eighteenth birthday and became eligible for flying training. With the exception of the rank of &quot;aviator&quot;, the current RCAF uses the army-style ranks instituted by the Canadian Forces when unification took place in 1968.

This chart compares ranks of the former and current RCAF. Ranks are listed with the most senior rank at the top.

==== Commander-in-Chief ====
==== Officers ====
==== Non-commissioned members ====
=== Uniforms ===
Uniforms of the original RCAF were nearly identical to the Royal Air Force and other Dominion air forces in cut, colour and insignia. Personnel wore RAF-pattern blue battledress, though some personnel in the 2nd Tactical Air Force and in the Pacific also wore army khaki battledress with standard RCAF insignia. A khaki-drill uniform was introduced for wear in summer and warm climates.

During the Second World War Canadian airmen and airwomen posted outside Canada wore a &quot;Canada&quot; nationality shoulder flash, as did Canadians serving with the RAF. This was usually light blue lettering on curved blue-grey for commissioned officers and Warrant Officer 1, and light blue lettering curved above an eagle for other ranks, except for warm weather uniforms, which had red embroidery on khaki-drill. Later in the war all RCAF personnel wore this nationality distinction, which was continued until unification.

After the war, the insignia for Warrant Officer I changed from the Royal coat of arms to the Canadian coat of arms. Along with the rest of the Commonwealth, insignia using the Imperial Crown changed from the Tudor Crown to the St. Edward&#x27;s Crown after the accession of Queen Elizabeth II to the Throne of Canada.

After unification, all personnel in the Canadian Forces wore a rifle green uniform with only cap and collar badges (a modified version of the former RCAF badge) as distinguishing marks for pilots and aircrew. Use of this uniform continued under Air Command from 1975 until the mid-1980s, when Air Command adopted a blue &quot;distinctive environmental uniform&quot;. This uniform continued to be used until 2015 when the rank structure and insignia changed. Insignia changed from golden yellow to a pearl-grey colour similar to that worn before unification of Canada&#x27;s Armed Forces in 1968 and the button color was changed. Other changes reflect the replacement of the rank of &quot;private&quot; with that of &quot;aviator&quot;, and officers&#x27; tunic sleeve insignia were modified.

== Leadership ==
The Commander of the Royal Canadian Air Force is the institutional head of the Royal Canadian Air Force. Starting with the Canadian Air Force in 1920, air force commanders have had several titles: Officer Commanding, Director, Senior Air Officer, Chief of the Air Staff, and Commander. In August 2011, with the restoration of the Royal Canadian Air Force name, the title &quot;Chief of the Air Staff&quot; was changed to &quot;Commander of the Royal Canadian Air Force.&quot;

<text>The Community of Portuguese Language Countries (; : CPLP), also known as the Lusophone Community (), is an international organization and political association of Lusophone nations across five continents, where Portuguese is an official language. The CPLP operates as a privileged, multilateral forum for the mutual cooperation of the governments, economies, non-governmental organizations, and peoples of the &quot;Lusofonia&quot;. The CPLP consists of 9 member states and 33 associate observers, located in Europe, South America, Asia, Africa and Oceania, totaling 38 countries and 4 organizations.

The CPLP was founded in 1996, in Lisbon, by Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, and São Tomé and Príncipe, nearly two decades after the beginning of the decolonization of the Portuguese Empire. Following the independence of East Timor in 2002 and the application by Equatorial Guinea in 2014, both of those countries became members of the CPLP. Macau (a Special Administrative Region of China), Galicia (an Autonomous Community of Spain), and Uruguay are formally interested in full membership and another 17 countries across the world are formally interested in associate observer status.

== History ==

The idea of a type of international community or political union of Portuguese language countries had been proposed and studied numerous times in history. However, the idea for what would become the CPLP came about in 1983, during a state visit to Cape Verde by Jaime Gama, Foreign Minister of Portugal, when he first proposed a biennial summit of heads of state and government of Lusophone countries of the world and the idea of regular meetings between ministerial counterparts of the member states.

The Community of Portuguese Language Countries was officially founded on 17 July 1996 at the 1st CPLP Heads of State &amp; Government Summit, in Lisbon, Portugal.

In 2005, during a meeting in Luanda, the ministers of culture of the member states declared the 5 May as the (&quot;Dia da Cultura Lusófona&quot; in Portuguese).

Through successive enlargements, the Union has grown from the seven founding states—Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, and São Tomé and Príncipe—to the current nine, with the self-determination of East Timor in 2002 and the accession of Equatorial Guinea in 2014 at the 10th CPLP Summit in Dili, East Timor with the issuance of the Dili Declaration.

The community has grown beyond its mission in fostering cultural ties between the Portuguese language countries into facilitating trade and political cooperation between the Lusophone countries of the world, with the CPLP is the fourth-largest producer of oil in the world and its citizens totalling more than 270 million people.

In 2017, in Brasília, the nine-member states agreed to enlarge cooperation in matters of the seas, tourism, economy and more ambitious defense and cooperation mechanisms. More rights to the observer states were also approved, which Argentina planned to join.

== Structure ==
The CPLP&#x27;s guidelines and priorities are established by a biannual Conference of Heads of State and Government (known as the CPLP Summits) and the Organization&#x27;s plan of action is approved by the Council of Foreign Ministers, which meets every year. Special summits can be requested at any time by 2/3 of the member states, usually for the purpose of pressing matters or incidents at the moment. There are also monthly meetings of the Permanent Steering Committee that follow specific initiatives and projects.

The headquarters of the CPLP is in Penafiel Palace in Lisbon, Portugal, but the organization maintains dedicated bureaus in all of the foreign ministries of the CPLP member states.

The CPLP is financed by its member states.

In 2016, CPLP revised its cooperation protocol in defense, affirming the organization in the promotion of peace and security.

The 2017 Exercício Felino military exercise taking place in Academia Militar das Agulhas Negras, Resende, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, aims for the increased interoperability of the armed forces of Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, São Tomé and Príncipe, and East Timor. The first phase of the exercise, known as &quot;Carta&quot; (chart) took place in Cape Verde in 2016, in which the operation was planned and executed using computer networks as a war game. The Exercício Felino was established in the year 2000.

=== &quot;CPLP Mobility&quot; ===
The 2021 Summit in Luanda saw the creation of the &quot;CPLP Mobility&quot;, a system that seeks to facilitate the entry and permanence of citizens of one country in another.

The Parliamentary Assembly, founded on the principle of one language - the Portuguese language - and common values, constitutes a space for strengthening ties of cooperation, solidarity and exchange between member Parliaments, with a view to contributing to the consolidation of peace, democracy and the rule of law in the respective countries. These are the pillars on which the objectives enshrined in the Statute and Regulations are based, instruments approved right at its first meeting. The rotating presidency of the CPLP Parliamentary Assembly was assumed in July 2021 by Guinea-Bissau, whose executive secretary is Cipriano Cassamá.

== Operating agencies ==
The Community of Portuguese Language Countries relies on six operating agencies to carry out its mandate: Universidade da Integração Internacional da Lusofonia Afro-Brasileira, União das Cidades Capitais Luso-Afro-Américo-Asiáticas, Associação das Universidades de Língua Portuguesa, Instituto Internacional da Língua Portuguesa, União dos Advogados de Língua Portuguesa and TV CPLP via Web.

=== University for International Integration of the Afro-Brazilian Lusophony (UNILAB) ===
The UNILAB is a public federal university located in Redenção, Ceará, Brazil. The major courses offered are preferentially the ones included in the mutual interest of all countries in the Community of Portuguese Language Countries. They are: Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Sao Tome and Principe, Mozambique and East Timor. Looking for international integration, 50% of the seats in the University are for international students from those countries. The UNILAB is a private postgraduate institution that trains managers and high-level trainers in areas that are a priority for development in Lusophone Africa, but also includes East Timor and Macau. Its political-pedagogical project is innovative, as are those of Unila and Uniam, aiming at international integration.

=== UCCLA ===
The Union of Luso-Afro-Americo-Asian Capital Cities (União das Cidades Capitais Luso-Afro-Américo-Asiáticas, UCCLA) is an international organization formed by cities in Lusophony. It was founded in Lisbon on 28 June 1985, at the Centro Cultural das Descobertas. On that date, the constitutive document was signed by the presidents of the municipalities of Lisbon (Nuno Abecasis), Bissau (Francisca Pereira), Maputo (Alberto Massavanhane), Praia (Felix Gomes Monteiro), Rio de Janeiro - that ceased being the capital of Brazil in 1960 -(Laura de Macedo), São Tomé (Gaspar Ramos) and Macau (Carlos Algéos Ayres). Its current secretary general is the Portuguese politician .

Then came the remaining capital cities of Portuguese official expression and other non-capital cities, such as Brasília – capital of Brazil since 1960 - (1986), Cacheu and Luanda (1989), Guimarães (1990), Taipa and Coloane islands (1991), Santo António (1993), Ilha de Moçambique (1994), Salvador (1995), Belo Horizonte (1998), Belém (1999), Bolama, Huambo, Porto Alegre and Mindelo (2000), Dili (2002), São Filipe, Oecusse (2004), Angra do Heroísmo (2013) and Santiago de Compostela (2016).
The international intermunicipal association focuses on cooperation projects in the areas of companies, immigrants, culture, promotion of the Portuguese language and urban issues such as garbage, the road system, heritage conservation, public health and water supply.

=== Association of Portuguese Language Universities (AULP) ===
Founded in 1986 in Lisbon, Portugal, the Association of Portuguese Language Universities (AULP) is an international NGO that promotes cooperation and information exchange between universities and higher institutes. With around 140 members from the eight Portuguese-speaking countries (Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe, East Timor) and Macau, its mission is to facilitate communication between members for the benefit of collective development of teaching and the Portuguese language in the world. It aims to stimulate research and exchange between students and teachers and also proposes continuous reflection through the daily dissemination of news and the organization of conferences and events. The president of the AULP is usually the vice-rector of the university elected to preside over the organization, and it is currently headed by the University of Coimbra, whose vice-rector is the Portuguese João Nuno Calvão da Silva.

=== International Portuguese Language Institute ===

The International Portuguese Language Institute is the Community of Portuguese Language Countries&#x27;s institute supporting the spread and popularity of the Portuguese language in the world. The institute&#x27;s headquarters is located in Praia, Cape Verde. Its history starts in 1989 when the countries of Portuguese language gathered in São Luís do Maranhão in Brazil to create a base for a Portuguese language community. The Brazilian president, José Sarney, proposed the idea of an international institute to promote the language. Only 10 years later in a meeting in São Tomé and Príncipe, a small island-nation in the Gulf of Guinea, the institute&#x27;s objectives, implementation and location (Cape Verde) were set.

The IILP&#x27;s fundamental objectives are &quot;the promotion, the defence, the enrichment and the spread of the Portuguese language as a vehicle of culture, education, information and access to scientific and technologic knowledge and of official use in international forums&quot;.

=== Union of Portuguese Speaking Lawyers ===
The Union of Portuguese Language Lawyers (UALP) was created in 2002 under the designation of “Association of Bar Associations and Lawyers of Portuguese Speaking Countries&quot;, thus formalizing the alliance that existed between the lawyers of Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea- Bissau, Macau, Mozambique, Portugal, São Tomé and Príncipe and East Timor. The designation of UALP was adopted in 2005. Currently, the UALP represents more than a million lawyers.

The UALP&#x27;s main vectors of action are centered on cooperation in terms of training, internships, the way of practicing law and the relevant legislation applicable to lawyers, as well as the sharing of experiences in the scope of management, organization of events and forms of contact and participation of lawyers registered with the respective Orders and Associations. Its current president is the Angolan lawyer Luís Paulo Monteiro.

=== TV CPLP ===
TV CPLP is a proposal for a television channel made within the Community of Portuguese Language Countries to be broadcast internationally. Its costs will be borne by UNESCO and the Portuguese Government. All programs will be broadcast in Portuguese, in their different ways of speaking and all accents. At CPLP, the proposal was discussed at the Workshop on the Television Content Sharing Platform, between Public Televisions of Portuguese Speaking Countries and CPLP TV, in Lisbon on 16 October 2007, as well as at the Round Table for a Television Content Sharing Platform between Public Television Operators from Portuguese-speaking Countries and TV CPLP, in Lisbon from March 5 to 7, 2007.

It will be created by the following Portuguese-speaking TV channels and will be broadcast by the 8 founding countries and also to other countries.

As a Lusophone Content Exchange Platform, the proposal was presented in Brazil as a project by the Instituto Cultural Brasil Plus (ICBrPLus) called &quot;TV CPLP Via Web&quot; by a commission of the Federal Senate of Brazil and approved by Ordinance No. 416 of the Secretariat Executive of the Ministry of Culture.

== Membership ==

=== Member states ===
There are nine full member states of the CPLP. Seven were founding members of the CPLP: Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, and São Tomé and Príncipe; East Timor joined in 2002, after achieving independence, and Equatorial Guinea joined in 2014.

====Macau candidacy====
Macau was the last Portuguese colony to be decolonized, and returned to China in 1999 after more than four centuries under Portuguese control. It still retains traces of Lusophone culture and Portuguese is one of the official languages of the territory. Despite that, the majority of the population in Macau do not speak and understand Portuguese; rather, Cantonese is the main language. In 2006, during the II Ministerial meeting between China and Portuguese Speaking Countries, the CPLP Executive Secretary and Deputy ambassador Tadeu Soares invited the Chief Executive of the Government of the Macau Special Administrative Region, Edmund Ho, to request the Associate Observer status for Macau. The Government of Macau has not yet formalized this request.

====Equatorial Guinea accession====
When the CPLP was formed, Equatorial Guinea asked for observer status. Equatorial Guinea () was a Portuguese colony from the 15th to 18th centuries and has some territories where Portuguese-based creole languages are spoken and cultural connections with São Tomé and Príncipe and Portugal are felt. In the 21st century, the country has cooperated with Portuguese-speaking African countries and Brazil at an educational level. At the CPLP summit of July 2004, in São Tomé and Príncipe, the member states agreed to change the statutes of the community to accept states as associate observers. Equatorial Guinea then engaged in discussion for full membership. In June 2010, Equatorial Guinea asked to be admitted as full member. At its eighth summit in Luanda in July 2010, the CPLP decided to open formal negotiations with Equatorial Guinea about full membership in the CPLP. At its 10th summit in Dili in July 2014, Equatorial Guinea was admitted as CPLP member.

=== Associate observers ===
In July 2006, during the Bissau summit, Equatorial Guinea and Mauritius were admitted as Associate Observers along with 17 International associations and organizations considered as Consultative Observers. On 23 July 2014, Equatorial Guinea was admitted as a CPLP member.

Mauritius, which was discovered by Portuguese explorers and maintains strong connections with Mozambique, is an Associate Observer. In 2008, Senegal, with historical connections to Portuguese colonisation in Casamance, was admitted as Associate Observer.

In July 2014, during the Dili summit, the Heads of State and Government approved a resolution that grants Georgia, Japan, Namibia and Turkey the status of Associate Observers. Japan has had historical contacts with the Portuguese language in the 16th and 17th century, and today has connections to the Lusophone world through Japanese Brazilians in Brazil and Japan. Namibia has had extensive contact with the Lusophone world due to its location just south of Angola.

Three European nations, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, were admitted as observers along with Uruguay at the 2016 summit. Uruguay has historical ties to Brazil and Portugal and has some speakers of Uruguayan Portuguese, an Uruguayan variety of Portuguese. In January 2018 and prior to the 2018 summit, Italy requested the observer status as an effort for the consolidation of bilateral relations with all of the Portuguese-speaking countries. In its request, the Italian government referred that due to the increasing number of associated observers in the community, CPLP is becoming a forum for countries in various geographical regions. Earlier in January, Andorra also formalized its candidacy for the same status. Italy shares a legacy of Ancient Rome and Italy is the non-Lusophone nation with the greatest number of university chairs in the Portuguese language. Because of immigration and geographic proximity, Portuguese is one of the most spoken languages in Andorra.

In the 2018 summit with all the heads of state present, with the exception of East Timor due to national policies issues, several observers joined the organization: Luxembourg, Andorra, the United Kingdom, Argentina, Serbia, Chile, France, Italy and the Organization of Ibero-American States joined as observers. Uruguay, an observer nation since 2016, admitted in early 2018 a candidacy to become full member of the CPLP.

The 2021 summit in Luanda, Angola saw the admission of ten new state observers to the organization: Canada, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Greece, India, Ireland, Peru, Qatar, Romania, Spain and the United States. They were joined by the organizational observers of the G7+, the Ibero-American Summit and the European Public Law Organization.

=== Consultative observers ===
The status of &quot;consultative observer&quot; is granted to organizations of civil society throughout the Lusofonia and pan-Lusophone bodies, as well as Lusophone institutions based outside of the Lusofonia, which serve a consultative status to the CPLP.

== Scope ==
The Portuguese-speaking countries are home to 267 million people located across the globe but having a common language, a shared history, and some cultural similarities. The CPLP nations have a combined area of about , which is more than twice as large as the European Union , but with a little more than half of the population.

===Political cooperation===
Since its formation, the CPLP has helped to solve problems in São Tomé and Príncipe and in Guinea-Bissau, because of coups d&#x27;état in those countries. The CPLP helped these two countries to take economic reforms (in the case of São Tomé) and democratic ones (in the case of Guinea-Bissau).

In the early 21st century, the leaders of the CPLP believed that peace in Angola and Mozambique, as well as East Timor&#x27;s independence, favored the development of the CPLP and a strengthening of multilateral cooperation.

=== Language ===
Since many children in rural areas of Lusophone Africa and East Timor are out-of-school youth, the education officials in these regions seek help from Portugal and Brazil to increase the education to spread Portuguese fluency (like establishing Instituto Camões language center branches in main cities and rural towns), as Portuguese is becoming one of the main languages in Southern Africa, where it is also taught in Namibia and South Africa.

Angola has not yet signed the most recent accord on the orthography of the Portuguese language, and has asked other PALOP countries to support it in discussions on various points of that accord with Portugal.

=== Education ===
In many developing Portuguese-speaking nations, Portuguese is the language of government and commerce which means that Portuguese-speaking people from African nations can work and communicate with others in different parts of the world, especially in Portugal and Brazil, where the economies are stronger. Many leaders of Portuguese-speaking nations in Africa are fearful that language standards do not meet the fluency required and are therefore making it compulsory in schools so that a higher degree of fluency is achieved and young Africans will be able to speak a world language that will help them later in life.

===Lusophone Citizenship===
Easing citizens&#x27; cross-border movement between the member states was proposed at the 2017 CPLP Summit. This proposal by Portugal and Cape Verde to Brazil was thought by some to conflict with Europe&#x27;s Schengen area. However, this free movement is based on a different model: as residence permits, associated with the recognition of academic degrees and professional qualification, and maintenance of social rights including pension systems. It would henceforth establish the Lusophone citizenship, the &quot;cidadania lusófona&quot;.

== Institutions ==

===CPLP Summits===

<text>Howard Hathaway Aiken (March 8, 1900 – March 14, 1973) was an American physicist and a pioneer in computing. He was the original conceptual designer behind IBM&#x27;s Harvard Mark I, the United States&#x27; first programmable computer.

== Biography ==
Aiken was born on 8 March 1900, in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Daniel Aiken, who came from a wealthy and established Indiana family, and Margaret Emily Mierisch, whose parents were German immigrants. He grew up in Indianapolis where he graduated from Arsenal Technical High School in 1919. Aiken studied at the University of Wisconsin–Madison where he received his B.S. in electrical engineering in 1923. He later obtained his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in physics from Harvard University in 1937 and 1939, respectively. During this time, he encountered differential equations that he could only solve numerically. Inspired by Charles Babbage&#x27;s difference engine, he envisioned an electro-mechanical computing device that could do much of the tedious work for him. This computer was originally called the ASCC (Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator) and later renamed Harvard Mark I. With engineering, construction, and funding from IBM, the machine was completed and installed at Harvard in February 1944. Richard Milton Bloch, Robert Campbell and Grace Hopper joined the project later as programmers. In 1947, Aiken completed his work on the Harvard Mark II computer. He continued his work on the Mark III and the Harvard Mark IV. The Mark III used some electronic components and the Mark IV was all-electronic. The Mark III and Mark IV used magnetic drum memory and the Mark IV also had magnetic-core memory.

Aiken accumulated honorary degrees at the University of Wisconsin, Wayne State University and Technische Hochschule, Darmstadt. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1947. He received the University of Wisconsin–Madison College of Engineering Engineers Day Award in 1958, the Harry H. Goode Memorial Award in 1964, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1965, the John Price Wetherill Medal in 1964, and the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Edison Medal in 1970 &quot;For a meritorious career of pioneering contributions to the development and application of large-scale digital computers and important contributions to education in the digital computer field.&quot;

In addition to his work on the Mark series, another important contribution of Aiken&#x27;s was the introduction of a master&#x27;s program for computer science at Harvard in 1947, nearly a decade before the programs began to appear in other universities. This became a starting ground to future computer scientists, many of whom did doctoral dissertations under Aiken.

==Personal life==
Howard Aiken married three times: to Louise Mancill in June 1937, then later to Agnes Montgomery, and lastly to Mary McFarland. He had two children; one with his first wife, and one with his second.

Howard Aiken was also a Commander in the United States Navy Reserve.

After he retired at age 60 to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Aiken continued his contributions to technology. He founded Howard Aiken Industries Incorporated, which was a consulting firm that helped failing businesses recover. During his years in Florida, he joined the University of Miami as a Distinguished Professor of Information. In addition, Aiken became a consultant for companies such as Lockheed Martin and Monsanto. On the morning of March 14, 1973, Aiken died in his sleep during a consulting trip to St. Louis, Missouri. His widow, Mary, died in 2013.

<text>The term center or centre is used in various contexts in abstract algebra to denote the set of all those elements that commute with all other elements.
* The center of a group &quot;G&quot; consists of all those elements &quot;x&quot; in &quot;G&quot; such that &quot;xg&quot; = &quot;gx&quot; for all &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;. This is a normal subgroup of &quot;G&quot;.
* The similarly named notion for a semigroup is defined likewise and it is a subsemigroup.
* The center of a ring (or an associative algebra) &quot;R&quot; is the subset of &quot;R&quot; consisting of all those elements &quot;x&quot; of &quot;R&quot; such that &quot;xr&quot; = &quot;rx&quot; for all &quot;r&quot; in &quot;R&quot;. The center is a commutative subring of &quot;R&quot;.
* The center of a Lie algebra &quot;L&quot; consists of all those elements &quot;x&quot; in &quot;L&quot; such that [&quot;x&quot;,&quot;a&quot;] = 0 for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;L&quot;. This is an ideal of the Lie algebra &quot;L&quot;.

The name is also used for any naturally occurring mixture or complex of various such enzymes, that act serially or synergistically to decompose cellulosic material.

Cellulases break down the cellulose molecule into monosaccharides (&quot;simple sugars&quot;) such as β-glucose, or shorter polysaccharides and oligosaccharides. Cellulose breakdown is of considerable economic importance, because it makes a major constituent of plants available for consumption and use in chemical reactions. The specific reaction involved is the hydrolysis of the 1,4-β--glycosidic linkages in cellulose, hemicellulose, lichenin, and cereal β--glucans. Because cellulose molecules bind strongly to each other, cellulolysis is relatively difficult compared to the breakdown of other polysaccharides such as starch.

Most mammals have only very limited ability to digest dietary fibres like cellulose by themselves. In many herbivorous animals such as ruminants like cattle and sheep and hindgut fermenters like horses, cellulases are produced by symbiotic bacteria. Endogenous cellulases are produced by a few types of animals, such as some termites, snails, and earthworms.

Cellulases have also been found in green microalgae (&quot;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&quot;, &quot;Gonium pectorale&quot; and &quot;Volvox carteri&quot;) and their catalytic domains (CD) belonging to GH9 Family show highest sequence homology to metazoan endogenous cellulases. Algal cellulases are modular, consisting of putative novel cysteine-rich
carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), proline/serine-(PS) rich linkers in addition to putative Ig-like and unknown domains in some members. Cellulase from &quot;Gonium pectorale&quot; consisted of two CDs separated by linkers and with a C-terminal CBM.

Several different kinds of cellulases are known, which differ structurally and mechanistically. Synonyms, derivatives, and specific enzymes associated with the name &quot;cellulase&quot; include endo-1,4-β--glucanase (β-1,4-glucanase, β-1,4-endoglucan hydrolase, endoglucanase D, 1,4-(1,3;1,4)-β--glucan 4-glucanohydrolase), carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase), avicelase, celludextrinase, cellulase A, cellulosin AP, alkali cellulase, cellulase A 3, 9.5 cellulase, celloxylanase and pancellase SS. Enzymes that cleave lignin have occasionally been called cellulases, but this old usage is deprecated; they are lignin-modifying enzymes.

== Types and action ==
Five general types of cellulases based on the type of reaction catalyzed:

*Endocellulases (EC 3.2.1.4) randomly cleave internal bonds at amorphous sites that create new chain ends.
* Exocellulases or cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91) cleave two to four units from the ends of the exposed chains produced by endocellulase, resulting in tetrasaccharides or disaccharides, such as cellobiose. Exocellulases are further classified into type I, that work processively from the reducing end of the cellulose chain, and type II, that work processively from the nonreducing end. 
* Cellobiases (EC 3.2.1.21) or β-glucosidases hydrolyse the exocellulase product into individual monosaccharides.
* Oxidative cellulases depolymerize cellulose by radical reactions, as for instance cellobiose dehydrogenase (acceptor).
* Cellulose phosphorylases depolymerize cellulose using phosphates instead of water.

Within the above types there are also progressive (also known as processive) and nonprogressive types. Progressive cellulase will continue to interact with a single polysaccharide strand, nonprogressive cellulase will interact once then disengage and engage another polysaccharide strand.

Cellulase action is considered to be synergistic as all three classes of cellulase can yield much more sugar than the addition of all three separately. Aside from ruminants, most animals (including humans) do not produce cellulase in their bodies and can only partially break down cellulose through fermentation, limiting their ability to use energy in fibrous plant material.

== Structure ==

Most fungal cellulases have a two-domain structure, with one catalytic domain and one cellulose binding domain, that are connected by a flexible linker. This structure is adapted for working on an insoluble substrate, and it allows the enzyme to diffuse two-dimensionally on a surface in a caterpillar-like fashion. However, there are also cellulases (mostly endoglucanases) that lack cellulose binding domains.

Both binding of substrates and catalysis depend on the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme which arises as a consequence of the level of protein folding. The amino acid sequence and arrangement of their residues that occur within the active site, the position where the substrate binds, may influence factors like binding affinity of ligands, stabilization of substrates within the active site and catalysis. The substrate structure is complementary to the precise active site structure of enzyme. Changes in the position of residues may result in distortion of one or more of these interactions. Additional factors like temperature, pH and metal ions influence the non-covalent interactions between enzyme structure. The &quot;Thermotoga maritima&quot; species make cellulases consisting of 2 β-sheets (protein structures) surrounding a central catalytic region which is the active-site. The enzyme is categorised as an endoglucanase, which internally cleaves β-1,4-glycosydic bonds in cellulose chains facilitating further degradation of the polymer. Different species in the same family as &quot;T. maritima&quot; make cellulases with different structures. Cellulases produced by the species &quot;Coprinopsis cinerea&quot; consists of seven protein strands in the shape of an enclosed tunnel called a β/α barrel. These enzymes hydrolyse the substrate carboxymethyl cellulose. Binding of the substrate in the active site induces a change in conformation which allows degradation of the molecule.

=== Cellulase complexes ===

In many bacteria, cellulases in vivo are complex enzyme structures organized in supramolecular complexes, the cellulosomes. They can contain, but are not limited to, five different enzymatic subunits representing namely endocellulases, exocellulases, cellobiases, oxidative cellulases and cellulose phosphorylases wherein only exocellulases and cellobiases participate in the actual hydrolysis of the β(1→4) linkage. The number of sub-units making up cellulosomes can also determine the rate of enzyme activity.

Multidomain cellulases are widespread among many taxonomic groups, however, cellulases from anaerobic bacteria, found in cellulosomes, have the most complex architecture consisting of different types of modules. For example, &quot;Clostridium cellulolyticum&quot; produces 13 GH9 modular cellulases containing a different number and arrangement of catalytic-domain (CD), carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), dockerin, linker and Ig-like domain.

The cellulase complex from &quot;Trichoderma reesei&quot;, for example, comprises a component labeled C1 (57,000 daltons) that separates the chains of crystalline cellulose, an endoglucanase (about 52,000 daltons), an exoglucanase (about 61,000 dalton), and a β-glucosidase (76,000 daltons).

Numerous &quot;signature&quot; sequences known as dockerins and cohesins have been identified in the genomes of bacteria that produce cellulosomes. Depending on their amino acid sequence and tertiary structures, cellulases are divided into clans and families.

Multimodular cellulases are more efficient than free enzyme (with only CD) due to synergism because of the close proximity between the enzyme and the cellulosic substrate. CBM are involved in binding of cellulose whereas glycosylated linkers provide flexibility to the CD for higher activity and protease protection, as well as increased binding to the cellulose surface.

== Mechanism of cellulolysis ==


== Uses ==
Cellulase is used for commercial food processing in coffee. It performs hydrolysis of cellulose during drying of beans. Furthermore, cellulases are widely used in textile industry and in laundry detergents. They have also been used in the pulp and paper industry for various purposes, and they are even used for pharmaceutical applications.
Cellulase is used in the fermentation of biomass into biofuels, although this process is relatively experimental at present. 

===Paper and pulp===
Cellulases have a wide varierty of applications in the paper and pulp industry. In the production and recycling processes cellulases can be applied to improve debarking, pulping, bleaching, drainage or deinking. 

The use of cellulase can also improve the quality of the paper. Cellulases affect the fiber morphology, which may lead to improved fibre-fibre bonding, resulting in increased fibre cohesion. Additional effects on the paper may include increased tensile strength, higher bulk, porosity and tissue softness.

===Pharmaceutical===
Cellulase is used in medicine as a treatment for phytobezoars, a form of cellulose bezoar found in the human stomach, and it has exhibited efficacy in degrading polymicrobial bacterial biofilms by hydrolyzing the β(1-4) glycosidic linkages within the structural, matrix exopolysaccharides of the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS).

===Textiles===
Various uses of cellulases in the textile industry include biostoning of jeans, polishing of textile fibres, softening of garments, removal of excess dye or the restoration of colour brightness.

===Agriculture===
Cellulases can be used in the agricultural sector as a plant pathogen and for disease control. It is also applied to enhance seed germination and improvement of the root system, and may lead to improved soil quality and recude the dependence on mineral fertilisers.

== Measurement ==
As the native substrate, cellulose, is a water-insoluble polymer, traditional reducing sugar assays using this substrate can not be employed for the measurement of cellulase activity. Analytical scientists have developed a number of alternative methods. 
* DNSA Method Cellulase activity was determined by incubating 0.5 ml of supernatant with 0.5 ml of 1% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) in 0.05M citrate buffer (pH 4.8) at 50 °C for 30 minutes. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 3 ml dinitrosalicylic acid reagent. Absorbance was read at 540 nm.

A viscometer can be used to measure the decrease in viscosity of a solution containing a water-soluble cellulose derivative such as carboxymethyl cellulose upon incubation with a cellulase sample. The decrease in viscosity is directly proportional to the cellulase activity. While such assays are very sensitive and specific for &quot;endo&quot;-cellulase (&quot;exo&quot;-acting cellulase enzymes produce little or no change in viscosity), they are limited by the fact that it is hard to define activity in conventional enzyme units (micromoles of substrate hydrolyzed or product produced per minute).

=== Cellooligosaccharide substrates ===

The lower DP cello-oligosaccharides (DP2-6) are sufficiently soluble in water to act as viable substrates for cellulase enzymes. However, as these substrates are themselves &#x27;reducing sugars&#x27;, they are not suitable for use in traditional reducing sugar assays because they generate a high &#x27;blank&#x27; value. However their cellulase mediated hydrolysis can be monitored by HPLC or IC methods to gain valuable information on the substrate requirements of a particular cellulase enzyme.

=== Reduced cello-oligosaccharide substrates ===

Cello-oligosaccharides can be chemically reduced through the action of sodium borohydride to produce their corresponding sugar alcohols. These compounds do not react in reducing sugar assays but their hydrolysis products do. This makes borohydride reduced cello-oligosaccharides valuable substrates for the assay of cellulase using traditional reducing sugar assays such as the Nelson-Symogyi method.

=== Dyed polysaccharide substrates ===
These substrates can be subdivided into two classes-
* Insoluble chromogenic substrates: An insoluble cellulase substrate such as AZCL-HE-cellulose absorbs water to create gelatinous particles when placed in solution. This substrate is gradually depolymerised and solubilised by the action of cellulase. The reaction is terminated by adding an alkaline solution to stop enzyme activity and the reaction slurry is filtered or centrifuged. The colour in the filtrate or supernatant is measured and can be related to enzyme activity. 
* Soluble chromogenic substrates: A cellulase sample is incubated with a water-soluble substrate such as azo-CM-cellulose, the reaction is terminated and high molecular weight, partially hydrolysed fragments are precipitated from solution with an organic solvent such as ethanol or methoxyethanol. The suspension is mixed thoroughly, centrifuged, and the colour in the supernatant solution (due to small, soluble, dyed fragments) is measured. With the aid of a standard curve, the enzyme activity can be determined.

=== Enzyme coupled reagents ===

New reagents have been developed that allow for the specific measurement of &quot;endo&quot;-cellulase. These methods involve the use of functionalised oligosaccharide substrates in the presence of an ancillary enzyme. In the example shown, a cellulase enzyme is able to recognise the trisaccharide fragment of cellulose and cleave this unit. The ancillary enzyme present in the reagent mixture (β-glucosidase) then acts to hydrolyse the fragment containing the chromophore or fluorophore. The assay is terminated by the addition of a basic solution that stops the enzymatic reaction and deprotonates the liberated phenolic compound to produce the phenolate species. The cellulase activity of a given sample is directly proportional to the quantity of phenolate liberated which can be measured using a spectrophotometer. The acetal functionalisation on the non-reducing end of the trisaccharide substrate prevents the action of the ancillary β-glucosidase on the parent substrate.

<text>Soldatensender Calais (G.9) (, &quot;Soldiers&#x27; Radio Calais&quot;) was a British black propaganda broadcaster during the Second World War operated by the Political Warfare Executive. It pretended to be a station of the German military broadcasting network. The station was in operation between 14 November 1943 and 30 April 1945, when it ceased operations.

&quot;Soldatensender Calais&quot; operated on the mediumwave band on 833 kHz (360 metres), 714 kHz (420 metres), and 612 kHz (490 metres), with an associated shortwave station &quot;Kurzwellensender Atlantik&quot; (&quot;Shortwave Station Atlantic&quot;) created to broadcast to U-boat crews. The station used a 500 kilowatt transmitter originally built for American broadcaster WJZ, in Newark, New Jersey. This transmitter had lain unused at the factory after the United States Federal Communications Commission imposed a 50 kW power limit on all U.S. stations, and so RCA was glad to sell it overseas and the British Secret Service bought it for £165,000. Codenamed Aspidistra, it was installed in a huge, underground bunker near Crowborough in Sussex, England, where it was briefly the world&#x27;s largest medium wave station, perfect for deceptive &quot;black&quot; operation.
&quot;Soldatensender Calais&quot; operated from 6 p.m. local time to dawn. Unlike its predecessor &quot;Gustav Siegfried Eins&quot;, the programmes were live from the purposely-built broadcast studio at Milton Bryan in Bedfordshire and presented by Agnes Bernelle using the codename &quot;Vicky&quot;.

The method of propaganda used by &quot;Soldatensender Calais&quot; was described by Sefton Delmer, its creator, in his book, &quot;Black Boomerang&quot;, as &quot;cover, cover, dirt, cover, dirt&quot;; that is, using good music and providing coverage of sports and other events of interest to a German serviceman, the station made that listener receptive to propaganda items aimed at decreasing morale. An example was a warning of confidence men swindling German soldiers being transferred from France to the Russian front. This approach could be compared to those used by Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally, without the heavy-handedness of the Axis programs. &quot;Soldatensender Calais&quot;, as part of its cover, relayed speeches by Adolf Hitler and other Nazi officials.

During the D-Day invasion of 6 June 1944, &quot;Soldatensender Calais&quot; broadcast information that was intended to impress German intelligence officers that the invasion area was wider than it actually was. After the Pas de Calais area was overrun, the station changed its callsign to &quot;Soldatensender West&quot;.

&quot;Soldatensender&quot;&#x27;s broadcast was repeated in print the next day in the PWE/OSS &quot;Nachrichten für die Truppe&quot; air-dropped newspaper for German troops.

The station closed on 30 April 1945 without any official announcement.

Other clandestine radio stations operated by the Political Warfare Executive and its forerunners during the war included &quot;Das wahre Deutschland&quot; (G.1), &quot;Sender der Europäischen Revolution&quot; (G.2), &quot;Gustav Siegfried Eins&quot; (G.3), &quot;Wehrmachtssender Nord&quot; (G.5) and the &quot;German Priest&quot; (G.7) station.

The Soviet-based German People&#x27;s Radio also known as &quot;Deutscher Volkssender&quot; was inspired, in part, by Soldatensender Calais.

<text>Menlo Park is an unincorporated community within Edison Township in Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey.

In 1876, Thomas Edison set up his home and research laboratory in Menlo Park, at the time an unsuccessful real estate development named after the town of Menlo Park, California. In this lab, which was one of the first to pursue practical, commercial applications of research, Edison invented the phonograph and developed a commercially viable incandescent light bulb filament. Christie Street in Menlo Park was one of the first streets in the world to use electric lights for illumination. In 1887, Edison moved his home and laboratory to West Orange. After his death, the Thomas Alva Edison Memorial Tower and Museum was constructed near his old Menlo Park lab and dedicated in 1938. Edison&#x27;s old lab site and memorial now make up Edison State Park.

The municipality in which Menlo Park is located, which was called &quot;Raritan Township&quot; while Edison was alive, was changed to Edison Township on November 10, 1954.

<text>Stadium Australia, currently known as Accor Stadium for sponsorship reasons, is a multi-purpose stadium located in the suburb of Sydney Olympic Park, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The stadium, which is sometimes referred to as Sydney Olympic Stadium, Homebush Stadium or simply the Olympic Stadium, was completed in March 1999 at a cost of A$690 million to host the 2000 Summer Olympics. The Stadium was leased by a private company, the Stadium Australia Group, until the Stadium was sold back to the NSW Government on 1 June 2016 after NSW Premier Michael Baird announced the Stadium was to be redeveloped as a world-class rectangular stadium. The Stadium is owned by Venues NSW on behalf of the NSW Government.

The stadium was originally built to hold circa 115,000 spectators, making it the largest Olympic Stadium ever built and the second largest stadium in Australia after the Melbourne Cricket Ground which held more than 120,000 before its re-design in the early 2000s. In 2003, reconfiguration work was completed to shorten the north and south wings, and install movable seating. These changes reduced the capacity to 80,000, with the capacity to add seating depending on the venue configuration. Awnings were also added over the north and south stands, allowing most of the seating to be under cover. The stadium was engineered along sustainable lines, e.g., utilising less steel in the roof structure than the Olympic stadiums of Athens and Beijing.

==Naming rights==
The stadium lacked a naming rights sponsor in its formative years, bearing the name Sydney Olympic Stadium when it was opened in 1999, and then Stadium Australia in 2001. In 2002, telecommunications company Telstra acquired the naming rights, resulting in the stadium being known as &quot;Telstra Stadium&quot;. On 12 December 2007 it was announced by the Stadium Australia Group (SAG) that the stadium&#x27;s name was to be changed to &quot;ANZ Stadium&quot; after concluding a deal with ANZ Bank worth around A$31.5 million over seven years. This change took effect on 1 January 2008. In 2014, ANZ renewed the deal through to the end of 2017 and again until its closure for rebuilding in October 2019.

In December 2020, ANZ&#x27;s naming rights to the stadium expired and it reverted to being &quot;Stadium Australia&quot;.

In November 2021, multinational hospitality company Accor acquired the rights, with the venue to be known as &quot;Accor Stadium&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===

The first sporting event held at the stadium was on 6 March 1999 when a then-record rugby league football crowd of 104,583 watched the NRL first round double-header, featuring Newcastle v Manly and Parramatta v St George Illawarra Dragons. The attendance broke the old record of 102,569 set at the Odsal Stadium in Bradford, England for the Challenge Cup Final replay between Warrington and Halifax held on 5 May 1954.

The first musical act held at the newly built stadium was the Bee Gees, consisting of Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb, on 27 March 1999. The band had embarked on what would be their final world tour as a group before the death of Maurice, the tour ending in the newly built Olympic Stadium. The show was sold out with an attendance of 66,285.

The stadium was not officially opened until 12 June 1999 when the Australian National Soccer team played the FIFA All Stars. Australia won the match 3–2 in front of a crowd of 88,101. Stadium Australia also played host to the national side&#x27;s historic playoff win over Uruguay in November 2005, a victory which granted Australia FIFA World Cup qualification for only the second time in the country&#x27;s history. The event attracted a virtual capacity crowd of 82,698.

The 1999 Bledisloe Cup rugby union match between Australia and New Zealand attracted a then-world record rugby union crowd of 107,042. In 2000, this was bettered when a near-capacity crowd of 109,874 (capacity at the time was 110,000) witnessed the &quot;greatest ever rugby match&quot; when a Jonah Lomu try sealed an All Blacks win over the Wallabies 39–35. The All Blacks had led 24-0 after 11 minutes only to see Australia draw level at 24–24 by halftime.

An exhibition soccer match between the Australia national team and English club Manchester United was played on 18 July 1999. Manchester United defeated Australia 1–0 in front of 78,000 spectators.

On 9 June 1999, the stadium hosted its first State of Origin series game between New South Wales and Queensland. The match, Game 2 of the three-game series, saw the record Origin attendance in Sydney when 88,336 saw the Blues christen their new home with a 12–8 win. The attendance broke the Origin attendance record of 87,161 set at the Melbourne Cricket Ground for Game 2 of the 1994 series.

On 7 August 1999, a National Football League (American football) exhibition game called the American Bowl was played between the Denver Broncos and the San Diego Chargers, bringing home former Australian Football League player Darren Bennett, the Chargers&#x27; punter. The Broncos won the game 20–17 in front of 73,811 spectators. This was Australia&#x27;s first, and currently only, American Bowl game.

The 1999 National Rugby League grand final, played on 26 September between the Melbourne Storm and the St George Illawarra Dragons, broke the rugby league world-record crowd previously set earlier in the season when 107,999 came to watch the Storm defeat the Dragons 20–18 to win their first NRL premiership.
During the 2000 Olympics, the evening athletics sessions on day 11 attracted 112,524 spectators on the night that Australia&#x27;s Cathy Freeman won the Olympic Gold Medal for the Women&#x27;s 400 metres. As of 2014, this remains the world record attendance for any athletics event. Also during the Olympics, the soccer final attracted 104,098 to witness Cameroon defeat Spain for its first-ever Olympic gold medal. This was an Olympic Games football attendance record, breaking the record of 101,799 set at the Rose Bowl during the Gold medal game of the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.

The opening ceremony for the 2000 Summer Olympics at the stadium completely sold out all 110,000 seats, while the highest attendance for any event in modern Olympic Games history was recorded with 114,714 at the stadium for the closing ceremony of the same Games. Musical acts for the closing ceremony were a &quot;who&#x27;s who&quot; of Australian music including Kylie Minogue, John Williamson, John Paul Young, Jimmy Barnes, Midnight Oil, INXS (with Jon Stevens), Men at Work, and Slim Dusty who sang &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;. Also in attendance on stage during the Closing ceremony were other famous Australian&#x27;s including golfer Greg Norman and comedian-actor Paul Hogan. The venue also hosted the same events during the 2000 Summer Paralympics.

===Post-reconfiguration===

The Sydney Swans v Collingwood Australian Football League (AFL) match at the Stadium on Saturday, 23 August 2003 set an attendance record for the largest crowd to watch an Australian rules football match outside Victoria with 72,393 spectators (87.7% capacity) attending and was the largest home-and-away AFL crowd at any Australian stadium for 2003. The attendance broke the record of 66,897 set at Football Park in Adelaide, South Australia on 28 September 1976 for the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) grand final between the Sturt and Port Adelaide Football Clubs.

2 October 2005 saw 82,453 attend the NRL grand final in which the Wests Tigers defeated the North Queensland Cowboys 30–16.
16 November 2005 saw 82,698 attend the second leg of the Oceania-South America Qualification Playoff game for qualification to the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Australia defeated Uruguay 1–0, which led to a penalty shootout as Uruguay had won the first leg of the playoff 1–0. Australia won the shootout 4–2 and secured a spot in the World Cup for the first time since 1974. The penalty spot where John Aloisi&#x27;s spot kick secured victory has been permanently preserved and is on public display at the stadium.

On 1 October 2006, the stadium hosted the 2006 NRL Grand Final between the Brisbane Broncos and Melbourne Storm. It was the first time since the competition began in 1908 that two teams from outside of Sydney had contested the grand final. 79,609 fans saw the Broncos defeat the Storm 15–8. As of the 2018 NRL Grand Final, this is one of three times that no Sydney based team has contested the premiership decider and also the only time an NRL grand final at the Olympic Stadium has failed to attract at least 80,000 fans.

On 5 October 2008, the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles defeated the Melbourne Storm 40–0 in the 2008 NRL Grand Final in front of 80,388 fans. This is the record winning margin for a grand final, breaking the previous record of 38-0 when Eastern Suburbs defeated St George in the 1975 Grand Final played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 2008 was the centenary year of the competition. It was also the first time a team had been held scoreless in a grand final since Manly had defeated Cronulla-Sutherland 16–0 in the 1978 Grand Final Replay at the SCG (the original Grand Final that year had been drawn 11-11).

In February 2009, the stadium replaced its existing two television screens with new Panasonic HD LED video screens that measure 23x10m – 70% larger than the original screens, and 50% larger than the screens in the Beijing National Stadium, while consuming less power than the old screens. Additionally, an LED perimeter screen showcasing ANZ advertising has been installed on the second level from the 30m line to the 30m line.

25 September 2009 saw the largest ever NRL finals attendance (non-grand final) in competition history when 74,549 fans saw the Parramatta Eels defeat the Bulldogs RLFC 22–12 in the preliminary final of the 2009 NRL season. This beat the previous finals record of 57,973 set at the Sydney Cricket Ground for the preliminary final of the 1963 NSWRFL season which St George defeat Parramatta 12–7.

It hosted its first International Cricket match when Australia took on India in a Twenty20 night game on 1 February 2012. The match attracted a crowd of 59,569 which remains the largest crowd ever for a cricket match in New South Wales.

30 September 2012 saw the largest ever NRL Grand Final crowd since reconfiguration up until 2014 when 82,976 attended the 2012 NRL Grand Final to see the Melbourne Storm defeat the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 14–4. This number was nearly reached in the 2009 NRL Grand Final between the Storm and the Parramatta Eels, with 82,538 in attendance. On 13 and 14 December 2010, a U2 concert, one of the biggest in history, was held at the ANZ Stadium.

On 6 July 2013 a new rectangle configuration record attendance of 83,702 watched the British &amp; Irish Lions defeat Australia 41–16 to win the Tom Richards Cup series by 2–1.

The record set by the Wallabies test was broken just 10 days later on 17 July when 83,813 (only 187 short of capacity) attended Game 3 of the 2013 State of Origin series. Queensland defeated NSW 12–10 to win their 8th straight Origin series. With 80,380 attending Game 1 at the stadium, the attendances also broke the Origin attendance records for the first and third game of a series. With the second game of the series attracting 51,690 to Brisbane&#x27;s Suncorp Stadium, 2013 also broke the Origin series attendance record with 215,883 attending the three games.

On 6 September 2013, the largest ever NRL minor round attendance for a single game at the stadium was set when 59,708 saw eventual 2013 Premiers the Sydney Roosters defeat South Sydney 24–12 in the final round of the 2013 NRL season. This was also the largest single game minor round crowd in the history of the premiership dating back to 1908, breaking the previous record set at the ANZ Stadium in Brisbane (now known as the Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre) on 27 August 1993 when St George defeated Brisbane 16–10 in Round 22 of the 1993 NSWRL season in front of 58,593 fans.

On 18 June 2014, 83,421 fans saw NSW defeat Qld 6–4 in Game 2 of the 2014 State of Origin series. After having won Game 1 at the Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane, the home side&#x27;s win saw Queensland&#x27;s eight year domination of Origin come to an end as New South Wales won their first series since 2005.

On 5 October 2014, a new post-reconfiguration attendance record of 83,833 saw South Sydney defeat Canterbury-Bankstown 30–6 in the 2014 NRL Grand Final. It was the Rabbitohs first grand final appearance and premiership win since 1971.

On 27 December 2014, a new domestic cricket record crowd for NSW was set with 32,823 attending the Sydney Derby between the Sydney Thunder and the Sydney Sixers. The crowd was the highest domestic cricket crowd in NSW history, only to be knocked off a few weeks later at the Sydney Cricket Ground involving the same two teams.

History was repeated on 4 October 2015 when for only the second time in the NRL&#x27;s history, no NSW team was in the grand final and for the first time ever, it was a Queensland derby in the final between Brisbane and North Queensland. 82,758 people, many of whom had travelled down from various parts of Queensland, witnessed one of the all-time great grand finals when the game went into golden point time courtesy of a Kyle Feldt try in the dying moments to level the scores at 16 all. But the game would be remembered for Ben Hunt&#x27;s dropped ball from the kick-off to extra time which led to Johnathan Thurston&#x27;s field goal that gave North Queensland their first premiership in the NRL since being admitted into the competition in 1995. Apart from games involving national teams, the crowd is the largest ever in NSW not to involve a team based in the state.

On 30 September 2018, the Grand Final between the Sydney Roosters and the Melbourne Storm featured one of the most courageous performances in Australian sporting history when Cooper Cronk, despite carrying a severe shoulder injury from the week before, played for nearly the entire match, inspiring his Roosters to a famous 21–6 victory over his former club and at the same time denying the Storm back to back premierships.

On 6 October 2019, another notable NRL Grand Final was held with 82,922 people witnessing the Sydney Roosters become the first back to back premiers in the NRL since the Brisbane Broncos of 1992 and 1993, defeating the Canberra Raiders who were in their first Grand Final since 1994 in controversial circumstances. During the 2nd half with 10 minutes to go with scores locked at 8 all, referee Ben Cummins initially gave Canberra a new set of six tackles after he thought a Roosters player touched the ball, but then retracted the call as Canberra&#x27;s Jack Wighton was tackled with the ball and ordered a handover to the Roosters with James Tedesco scoring the winning try for the Roosters shortly after the handover to win 14–8.

==Development==
In October 2001, major reconfiguration work on the stadium was commenced to allow for sports that require an oval field, such as cricket and Australian rules football, to be played at the ground. The two wing stands and the athletics track were removed; they were replaced with a movable seating section. New roofs were built over the two ends and seats that had a poor view of the field were removed. The reconfiguration reduced the capacity to 84,000 for the rectangular field and 82,500 for the oval field at a total cost of $80 million. The construction work was carried out by Multiplex.

The reconfiguration work was completed in October 2003 in time for the 2003 Rugby World Cup where the then Telstra Stadium hosted the opening game, two other groups games, both semi-finals, the third-place play-off and final matches of the competition. In the first semi-final on 15 November 2003, Australia beat New Zealand 22–10 and then in the second semi-final the following day England beat France 24–7. In the final, on 22 November, England beat Australia 20–17 in extra time.

In 2022, a new scoreboard was installed at the southern end of the stadium, measuring 120 metres wide. Also in 2022, the stadium lighting was replaced with new LED sports lights and were first used in Game One of the 2022 State of Origin series.

In 2023, upgrades of the match day change rooms and media facilities were completed at a cost of $81.4 million ahead of the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup and were first used for a NRL game between South Sydney and Manly Warringah on 25 March 2023.

==Proposed renovations==
In September 2015, the New South Wales Government announced it intended to upgrade the stadium within the next decade, and install a retractable roof over the stadium.

On 23 November 2017, the New South Wales Government revealed that Stadium Australia would be knocked down and completely re-built, with a new 75,000 seat rectangular stadium built in its place. The announcement was made in conjunction with the unveiling of rebuilding plans for the Sydney Football Stadium in Moore Park. The original plan for Stadium Australia was for the demolition to start in 2019 and the new stadium to be completed by 2021.

On 29 March 2018 NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian backflipped on the rebuilding plan, and revealed the government would instead refurbish Stadium Australia and reconfigure the pitch dimensions to a permanently rectangular shape. This would come at a cost of $800 million, compared to the knock-down and rebuild cost of $1.3 billion.

On 31 May 2020, the renovation plans were cancelled by the government, who pointed to a shift in budget priorities as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The decision meant the stadium remained capable of hosting oval-shaped sports such as cricket and Australian rules football, and retain its capacity to 83,500.

==Uses==
Various sporting codes have used this ground on a regular basis. The National Rugby League is the most regular tenant of the ground, while rugby union internationals, soccer internationals and Australian rules football are all played at the ground. ANZ Stadium hosts the following:

===Rugby league===

* Two teams play the majority of their home games there: Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs (since 1999) and South Sydney Rabbitohs (since 2006). 
*The Parramatta Eels played two home games a year at Stadium Australia between 2008 and 2016. Parramatta then called the stadium their temporary home from 2017 until April 2019 while their regular home ground Parramatta Stadium was demolished; with the Western Sydney Stadium built in its place. 
*The Wests Tigers now share the Western Sydney Stadium with Parramatta, using it as one of their three home grounds, having previously used the stadium between 2005–2008 and 2014–2018. Since 2021, Accor Stadium has been their home ground for Easter Monday home games against Parramatta. 
*The St George Illawarra Dragons called Stadium Australia their Sydney home in 2008 while their home ground, Kogarah Oval was redeveloped, and again for 2 games a year between 2014 and 2017.
* All New South Wales home games of the State of Origin series are played at the stadium each year (either one or two annually since 1999), and every NRL Grand Final has been held there since 1999 with the exception of the 2021 NRL Grand Final, which was played at Lang Park, Brisbane due to ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns in New South Wales.
* The North Sydney Bears and Manly Warringah played at least one home game at Stadium Australia in its opening year.

===Rugby union===
* In October and November 2003, the stadium hosted seven matches in the 2003 Rugby World Cup. Among them were the opener on 10 October, which Australia won 24–8 against Argentina, both semifinals and the final on 22 November, which England won against Australia 20-17 following Jonny Wilkinson&#x27;s 100th-minute drop goal to win their first Rugby World Cup.
* On 6 July 2013, the last test of the 2013 British &amp; Irish Lions tour was played in the ANZ Stadium, with the Lions winning 41–16 to win the series.
* On 2 August 2014, the stadium played host to the Super Rugby Final between the New South Wales Waratahs and the Canterbury Crusaders. A record Super Rugby crowd of over 61,800 witnessed the Waratahs defeat the Crusaders in a thriller, 33–32.

===Cricket===
* The Stadium has been approved as a ground for international cricket and has hosted Twenty20 Internationals.
* The Stadium was home to the Sydney Thunder franchise of the Big Bash League from 2011 to 2014. In June 2015, the Thunder announced they would leave ANZ Stadium and play all home games at Sydney Showground Stadium until the 2024-25 BBL season.
* It hosted its first International Cricket match when Australia took on India in a Twenty20 night game on 1 February 2012 and hosted its last T20 International in 2014.

===Soccer===
As the largest capacity stadium in Australia that can be configured for rectangular field sports, high-profile Australia national soccer team (Socceroos) fixtures are often staged at the stadium. The stadium hosted Australia&#x27;s 2005 shootout victory over Uruguay in the OFC-CONMEBOL intercontinental play-off, which qualified the Socceroos for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, their first appearance since 1974. Australia&#x27;s extra time victory over South Korea in the 2015 AFC Asian Cup Final, which marked the Socceroos&#x27; first Asian Cup victory, also came at the stadium. Stadium Australia was also the venue for Australia&#x27;s 3–1 victory against Honduras in the 2018 FIFA World Cup CONCACAF-AFC intercontinental play-off. 

The venue hosted the 2000 Olympics football gold medal match, with Cameroon defeating Spain 5–3 on penalties. The match attracted a crowd of 104,098, which remains the all-time largest attendance for an association football game in Australia. 

Sydney FC have played a number of one-off exhibition matches at the stadium. Sydney FC defeated the Los Angeles Galaxy of MLS 5–3 in front of a crowd of 80,295 in 2007.

<text>John Lewis Gaddis (born April 2, 1941) is an American Cold War historian, political scientist, and writer. He is the Robert A. Lovett Professor of Military and Naval History at Yale University. He is best known for his work on the Cold War and grand strategy, and he has been hailed as the &quot;Dean of Cold War Historians&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Gaddis is also the official biographer of the prominent 20th-century American diplomat and historian George F. Kennan. &quot;George F. Kennan: An American Life&quot; (2011), his biography of Kennan, won the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography.

== Biography ==
Gaddis attended the University of Texas at Austin, receiving his BA in 1963, MA in 1965, and PhD in 1968, the latter under the direction of Robert Divine. Gaddis then taught briefly at Indiana University Southeast, before joining Ohio University in 1969. At Ohio, he founded and directed the Contemporary History Institute, and was named a distinguished professor in 1983.

In the 1975–77 academic years, Gaddis was a visiting professor of Strategy at the Naval War College. In the 1992–93 academic year, he was the Harmsworth Visiting professor of American History at Oxford. He has also held visiting positions at Princeton University and the University of Helsinki. He served as president of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations in 1992.

In 1997, he moved to Yale University to become the Lovett Professor of Military and Naval History. In the 2000–01 academic year, Gaddis was the George Eastman Professor at Oxford, the second scholar (after Robin Winks) to have the honor of being both Eastman and Harmsworth professor. He sits on the advisory committee of the Wilson Center&#x27;s Cold War International History Project, which he helped establish in 1991. Gaddis is also known for his close relationship with the late George Kennan and his wife, whom Gaddis described as &quot;my companions&quot;.

== Scholarship ==
Gaddis is a well-known historian for his writing about the Cold War. Perhaps his most famous work is &quot;Strategies of Containment&quot; (1982; rev. 2005), which analyzes the theory and practice of containment that was employed against the Soviet Union by Cold War American presidents. His 1983 distillation of post-revisionist scholarship also guided Cold War research.

&quot;We Now Know&quot; (1997) presented an analysis of the Cold War through the Cuban Missile Crisis that incorporated new archival evidence from the Soviet bloc. It is one of the first attempts to write the Cold War&#x27;s history after it ended.

&quot;The Cold War&quot; (2005) is an examination of the history and effects of the Cold War in a more removed context, and won Gaddis the 2006 Harry S. Truman Book Prize. Critics were less impressed, with Tony Judt summarising the book as &quot;a history of America&#x27;s cold war: as seen from America, as experienced in America, and told in a way most agreeable to many American readers,&quot; and David S. Painter writing that it was a &quot;carefully crafted defense of US policy and policymakers&quot; that was &quot;not comprehensive.&quot;

Gaddis&#x27;s 2011 biography of George Kennan garnered multiple prizes, including a Pulitzer.

John Nagl described Gaddis&#x27;s 2018 book &quot;On Grand Strategy&quot; as &quot;a book that should be read by every American leader or would-be leader&quot;.

Gaddis is known for arguing that Soviet leader Joseph Stalin&#x27;s personality and role in history constituted one of the most important causes of the Cold War. Within the field of U.S. diplomatic history, he was originally most associated with the concept of post-revisionism, the idea of moving past the revisionist and orthodox interpretations of the origins of the Cold War to embrace what were (in the 1970s) interpretations based upon the then-growing availability of government documents from the United States, Great Britain and other western government archives. Due to his growing focus on Stalin and leanings toward US nationalism, Gaddis is now widely seen as more orthodox than post-revisionist. Revisionist historian Bruce Cumings had a debate with Gaddis in the 1990s, in which Cumings criticized Gaddis as moralistic and lacking in objectivity.

== Political views ==
During the US invasion of Iraq, Gaddis argued: &quot;The world now must be made safe for democracy, and this is no longer just an idealistic issue; it&#x27;s an issue of our own safety.&quot; During the United States occupation of Iraq, Gaddis asserted that Bush had established America &quot;as a &quot;more&quot; powerful and purposeful actor within the international system than it had been on September 11, 2001.&quot; Historian James Chace argues that Gaddis supports an &quot;informal imperial policy abroad.&quot; Gaddis believes that preventive war is a constructive part of American tradition, and that there is no meaningful difference between preventive and pre-emptive war.

About the Trump presidency he said, &quot;We may have been overdue for some reconsideration of the whole political system. There are times when the vision is not going to come from within the system and the vision is going to come from outside the system. And maybe this is one of those times.&quot;

== Personal life == 
Gaddis was born in Cotulla, Texas, the son of Harry Passmore Gaddis and his wife Isabel Florence (Maltsberger) Gaddis. He is close to President George W. Bush, making suggestions to his speech writers, and has been described as an &quot;overt admirer&quot; of the 43rd President. After leaving office, Bush took up painting as a hobby at Gaddis&#x27;s recommendation. Gaddis is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

<text>The Telharmonium (also known as the Dynamophone) was an early electrical organ, developed by Thaddeus Cahill c. 1896 and patented in 1897. The electrical signal from the Telharmonium was transmitted over wires; it was heard on the receiving end by means of &quot;horn&quot; speakers.

Like the later Hammond organ, the Telharmonium used tonewheels to generate musical sounds as electrical signals by additive synthesis. It is considered to be the first electromechanical musical instrument.

== Background ==
*1809, Prussian Samuel Thomas Soemmerring created an electrical telegraph that triggered an array of tuned bells
*In 1885, Hermann Helmholtz’s ‘On the Sensations of Tone’ (1862) appeared in English
*Elisha Gray’s ‘Musical Telegraph’ of 1874
*In Paris, Clément Ader created the ‘Théâtrophone’ in 1881 using two lines to pass music from a local theater to two separate phone receivers, dubbed &quot;binauriclar auduition&quot;, the first &quot;stereo&quot; concert via telephone.
*In 1890 AT&amp;T ceased work on a service to provide music, admitting difficulty with sound quality.
*In 1893 Hungarian Tivadar Puskás created the ‘Telefonhírmondó’ or ‘Telephone Herald’

==History==
In 1890&#x27;s, Thaddeus Cahill was a lawyer living in Washington DC who invented devices for Pianos and Typewriters.

:&quot;Cahill was working as a Congressional aide when he conceived the idea&quot;

The final design, patented in 1897, had twelve separate alternating-current generators, to generate electric waves, to produce the twelve basic tones of the musical scale, that would be controlled by a keyboard and heard through a telephone receiver.

Cahill built three versions. Each was an advancement over the features of its predecessor.

By 1901, Cahill had constructed a working model, to seek financial backing for a finished machine. The Mark I weighed 7 tons.

The 1906 model, had 145 separate electric generators. The Mark II weighed almost 200 tons, was 60 feet long, had multiple keyboards and controls, and required at least two players.

:&quot;As early as 1906, the Cahill Telharmonium Company of New York attempted to sell musical entertainment (produced by Dr. Thaddeus Cahill&#x27;s &quot;Telharmonium,&quot; an early synthesizer) to subscribers through the telephone. The Bell Telephone company, claiming that company equipment might be damaged, refused to give the company permission to use its lines, and the firm switched to radio technology&quot;

:&quot;Dr. Lee DeForest, of wireless telegraphy fame, made a series of successful tests with Telharmonic music currents, making the selection of the concert at Telharmonic hall clearly audible to hearers miles away without wires.&quot; — &quot;Passaic Daily News&quot;, Passaic, New Jersey, 16 March 1907, Page 6

The 1911, last Telharmonium, the Mark III, weighed almost 200 tons, was 60 feet long, had multiple keyboards and controls, and required at least two players, was installed in a special performance room in New York City.

A small number of performances were given for live audiences, in addition to the telephone transmissions. Performances in New York City (some at &quot;Telharmonic Hall&quot;, 39th and Broadway) were well received by the public in 1906, with Mark Twain among the appreciative audience. In these presentations, the performer sat at a console to control the instrument. The actual mechanism was so large it occupied an entire room; wires from the controlling console were fed discreetly through holes in the auditorium floor, into the instrument room below.

The Telharmonium foreshadowed modern electronic musical equipment in a number of ways. For instance, its sound output came in the form of connecting ordinary telephone receivers to large paper cones—a primitive form of loudspeaker. Cahill stated that electromagnetic diaphragms were the most preferable means of outputting its distinctive sound. There are no known recordings of its music.

The Telharmonium was retailed by Cahill for $200,000.

The Telharmonium&#x27;s demise came for a number of reasons. The instrument was immense in size and weight. This being an age before vacuum tubes had been invented, it required large electric dynamos which consumed great amounts of power in order to generate sufficiently strong audio signals. In addition, problems began to arise when telephone broadcasts of Telharmonium music were subject to crosstalk and unsuspecting telephone users would be interrupted by strange electronic music. By 1912, interest in this revolutionary instrument had changed, and Cahill&#x27;s company was declared not successful in 1914.

Cahill died in 1934; his younger brother retained the Mark I for decades, but was unable to interest anyone in it. This was the last version to be scrapped, in 1962.

==Design==
:&quot;The telharmonium generated its sounds using a system of alternators called &quot;rheotomes.&quot; Each rheotome was actually a cog with a specific number of notched teeth. As the edge of the rheotome rotated against a wire brush (part of a larger circuit), the teeth would contact the brush a certain number of times each second, based on the rheotome&#x27;s diameter. This resulted in the electrical oscillation of a sonic frequency.&quot;

Telharmonium tones were described as &quot;clear and pure&quot; — referring to the electronic sine wave tones it was capable of producing. However, it was not restricted to such simple sounds. Each tonewheel of the instrument corresponded to a single note, and, to broaden its possibilities, Cahill added several extra tonewheels to add harmonics to each note. This, combined with organ-like stops and multiple keyboards (the Telharmonium was polyphonic), as well as a number of foot pedals, meant that every sound could be sculpted and reshaped — the instrument was noted for its ability to reproduce the sounds of common orchestral woodwind instruments such as the flute, bassoon, clarinet, and also the cello. The Telharmonium needed 671 kilowatts of power:233 and had 153 keys that allowed it to work properly.

== Legacy ==
:&quot;Ferruccio Busoni was inspired by the machine at the height of its popularity and moved to write his ‘Sketch of a New Aesthetic of Music’ (1907) which in turn became the clarion call and inspiration for the new generation of electronic composers such as Edgard Varèse and Luigi Russolo.&quot;

<text>In politics, a red flag is predominantly a symbol of left-wing ideologies, including socialism, communism, anarchism, and the labour movement. The originally empty or plain red flag has been associated with left-wing politics since the French Revolution (1789–1799). The red flag and red as a political colour are the oldest symbols of socialism.

Socialists adopted the symbol during the Revolutions of 1848. It was first used as the flag of a new authority by the Lyon Commune and Paris Commune in the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871). The flag of the Soviet Union, introduced during the Russian Revolution, as well as the flags of many subsequent communist states, were explicitly inspired by the plain red flag. Many socialist and socialist-adjacent political parties, including those of democratic socialists and social democrats, have adapted and adopted a red flag as their symbol. The plain red flag was an official symbol of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom until the late 1980s. It was the inspiration for the socialist songs &quot;The Red Flag&quot; and &quot;Bandiera Rossa&quot;.

== History ==

Red color as a combat or revolt symbol in Europe goes back to the turn of the second millennium and before. In the Middle Ages, ships in combat flew long red streamers called baucans or bauccedillian to signify a fight with no quarter. 
Prior to the French Revolution and in some contexts since, red banners were seen as symbols of defiance and battle.

In Eastern Arabia, tribal federations used red standards as their flags. These federations later developed into sheikhdoms and emirates. The red standard was adopted as one of the early Islamic flags. The prominent Arab military commander Amr ibn al-As used a red banner.

The red cap was a symbol of popular revolt in France going back to the Jacquerie of 1358. The color red became associated with patriotism early in the French Revolution due to the popularity of the tricolour cockade, introduced in July 1789, and the Phrygian cap, introduced in May 1790. A red flag was raised over the Champ-de-Mars in Paris on July 17, 1791, by Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette, commander of the National Guard, as a symbol of martial law, warning rioters to disperse. As many as fifty anti-royalist protesters were killed in the fighting that followed. Inverting the original symbolism, the Jacobins protested this action by flying a red flag to honour the &quot;martyrs&#x27; blood&quot; of those who had been killed. They created their own red flags to declare &quot;the martial law of the people against the revolt of the court.&quot; The plain red flag has since been associated with left-wing politics.

In 1797, British sailors mutinied near the mouth of the River Thames and hoisted red flags on several ships.
Two red flags soaked in calf&#x27;s blood were flown by marchers in South Wales during the Merthyr Rising of 1831. It is claimed to be the first time that the red flag was waved as a banner of workers&#x27; power. The red flags of Merthyr became a potent relic following the execution of early trade unionist Dic Penderyn (Richard Lewis) in August 1831, despite a public campaign to pardon him.

During the Battle of the Alamo in March 1836, General Antonio López de Santa Anna of Mexico signified no quarter by displaying a plain blood-red flag ( square) from the highest church tower in Béxar. William B. Travis, a commander of the Alamo defenders, responded with a blast from the Alamo&#x27;s largest cannon.
During the Uruguayan Civil War (1839–1851), the victorious liberal faction of &quot;Colorados&quot; () used red flags. This prolonged struggle received considerable attention and sympathy from liberals and revolutionaries in Europe; Giuseppe Garibaldi first made a name for himself in 1843, having been inspired to have his troops wear the famous Red Shirts.

The Ottoman Empire used a variety of flags, especially as naval ensigns, during its history. The star and crescent came into use in the second half of the 18th century. A &quot;&quot; () from 1793 required that the ships of the Ottoman Navy use a red flag with the star and crescent in white. In 1844, a version of this flag with a five-pointed star was officially adopted as the flag of the Ottoman Empire.

During the 1848 revolution in France, socialists and radical republicans demanded that the red flag be adopted as France&#x27;s national flag. Led by poet-politician Alphonse de Lamartine, the government rejected the demand: &quot;[T]he red flag that you have brought back here has done nothing but being trailed around the Champ-de-Mars in the people&#x27;s blood in [17]91 and [17]93, whereas the Tricolore flag went round the world along with the name, the glory and the liberty of the homeland!&quot;

Following the unexpected defeat of France by the Germans in the Franco-Prussian War, French workers and socialist revolutionaries seized major cities and created the Lyon Commune and Paris Commune. The Lyon Commune was established in September 1870 and lasted for roughly eight months, while the Paris Commune was established in March 1871 and crushed by the French Army after two months, with much bloodshed. The original red banners of the Paris Commune became icons of the socialist revolution; in 1921, members of the French Communist Party came to Moscow and presented the new Soviet government with one of the original Commune banners; it remains in place in the tomb of Vladimir Lenin, next to his open coffin.

In the Haymarket affair, during which a bomb blast killed a police officer at a May Day rally for an eight-hour workday in Chicago, anarchists flew red flags. This event, considered to be the beginning of the revival of the international labour movement, is still commemorated annually in many countries as International Workers&#x27; Day (though not in the United States).

The red flag gained wide popularity in Russia during the Russian Revolutions of 1917, having been used as a symbol of revolutionary struggle in both the February Revolution and October Revolution; red was the political color of socialists on several opposed sides in the revolutions, such as the Bolsheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries. During the Russian Civil War (1917–1922), a red flag, with a red star symbolising the party and hammer and sickle to symbolise the workers and peasants respectively, became the official flag of Soviet Russia, and, in 1923, of the Soviet Union. It remained so until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.

During the Chinese Civil War (1927–1949), the flag of the Chinese Communist Party became a red flag with a hammer and sickle, while the flag of the People&#x27;s Republic of China became a red flag with a large star symbolising the party and four smaller stars symbolising workers, peasants, the urban middle class, and rural middle class, respectively. During the Cold War, many communist states, such as Vietnam, also adopted red flags, while others, such as Cuba, chose to keep their previous flags. Red national flags with symbolism unrelated to socialism have also been adopted; the red flag of Nepal, for instance, represents its national flower.

== Usage ==
=== Anarchism ===
The red flag was one of the first anarchist symbols prior to the October Revolution, after which red flags started to be associated with Marxism-Leninism, Bolshevism, and state socialism.

=== Arab world ===
Recent and current Arabian red flags include those of Muscat and Oman, the individual emirates of the United Arab Emirates, the Sheikhdom of Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar.

=== China ===
In China, both the Nationalist Party-led Republic of China and the Communist Party-led People&#x27;s Republic of China use red fields for their flags, referencing their revolutionary origins. Streets, buildings, businesses and product brands named after the red flag are common in China as a result of recuperation. For example, a famous line of limousine cars manufactured by China FAW Group Corporation has the brand name of Red Flag. In 1967 during the Cultural Revolution, Pilal in Akto County, Kizilsu, Xinjiang, China was renamed as Hongqi Commune (), meaning &#x27;red flag commune&#x27;. In 1968, Baykurut Commune in Ulugqat County, Kizilsu, Xinjiang, China was also renamed as Hongqi Commune.

=== Labour Party (UK) ===
The red flag was the emblem of the British Labour Party from its inception until the Labour Party Conference of 1986 when it was replaced by a red rose, itself a variant of the fist and rose, then in wide use by left of center parties in Europe. The more floral red rose design has subsequently been adopted by a number of other socialist and social-democratic parties throughout Europe. Members of the party also sing the traditional anthem &quot;The Red Flag&quot; at the conclusion of the annual party conference. In February 2006, &quot;The Red Flag&quot; was sung in Parliament to mark the centenary of the Labour Party&#x27;s founding. The flag was regularly flown above Sheffield Town Hall on May Day under David Blunkett&#x27;s Labour administration of Sheffield City Council during the 1980s.

=== Newspapers ===
Various socialist newspapers have used the name &quot;The Red Flag.&quot;

=== Soviet Union ===

In the Soviet Union, the Red Banner () was a widely used revolutionary symbol. Military units, institutions, and organizations that were awarded with the Order of the Red Banner, such as the Soviet Army, Soviet Navy, and MVD Internal Troops, were referred to with the honorific title &quot;of the Red Banner&quot; (), as in &quot;Red Banner Pacific Fleet&quot;, &quot;Guards Red Banner Submarine &quot;&quot;&quot;, or &quot;Twice Red Banner Alexandrov Soviet Army Choir&quot;. Civilian establishments that were awarded with the Order of the Red Banner of Labour were also sometimes addressed with the &quot;Red-Banner&quot; honorific.

The Transferable Red Banner () was an award for Soviet collectives in various workplaces that won socialist emulation contests. The term &quot;transferable&quot; means that for a given kind of competition at a given establishment (enterprise, school, institute, clinic, etc.) or category of establishments (e.g., type of industry), a single physical copy of the award was transferred from the winner of one competition to the winner of the next (held annually or quarterly). Any of several levels of the award could have been awarded, depending on the level of the socialist competition: all-Union, union-republican, oblast-wide, industry-wide, enterprise/institution-wide, etc. Similar awards existed in several communist states.

A new article, 190, was added to the Soviet criminal code in the 1960s. It permitted imprisonment for anti-Soviet agitation (part 1), for participation in unauthorized meetings (part 2), and for defamation of the Soviet coat of arms or the Red Banner (part 3).

=== Trade unionism ===
The building to have had a red flag flying for the longest period of time is the Victorian Trades Hall in Melbourne, Australia, the oldest trade union building in the world. The flag has been flying for over a century.

== Historical laws banning red flags ==
After the suppression of the 1848 revolution, red flags and other insignia dominated by the colour red were banned in Prussia, as would later be the case in France after the demise of the Paris Commune. During the persecution of communists and socialists amid the Red Scare of 1919–1920 in the United States, many states passed laws forbidding displays of red flags, including Minnesota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, and California. In &quot;Stromberg v. California&quot;, the Supreme Court of the United States held that such laws are unconstitutional.

In Australia, red flags were similarly banned in September 1918 under the &quot;War Precautions Act 1914&quot;. This ban was an arguable cause of the Red Flag riots. The ban ended in Australia with the repeal of the Act in 1920.

<text>On 7 November 1963, 11 West German miners were rescued from a collapsed mine after surviving for 14 days, an event that later became known as the Wunder von Lengede (&quot;miracle of Lengede&quot;).

On 24 October 1963, the Lengede-Broistedt Iron Mine near Salzgitter was flooded with of muddy water after a sedimentation pond had broken its ground and the tunnels between the and levels. Out of 129 workers, 79 escaped during the first few hours. They used underground mine ventilation raises and further shafts which had been provided with ladders due to safety regulations. At first there seemed to be no hope for the remaining 50 miners. Several attempts and deliberations about possible rescue positions within the mine and the successful rescue of miners at the one or other locations gave rise to a sequence of dramatic and technically challenging rescue missions with hitherto unseen worldwide media coverage.

== The float rescue==
After one day, seven more miners could be located with a small access bore hole close to the Hauptbremsberg, a central transport hub in the mine. While broader rescue drilling was underway, due to the falling water level, they sent a message to the surface that they would try to escape on their own. Four foremen from above secretly took the initiative to meet the men halfway with a makeshift float and get them back to the surface.

== The air bubble==
It had been calculated that four more workers could have survived in an air bubble on their working place. A bore hole drilled to that section revealed life signs. These miners (only three had actually survived) had to be brought to the surface through an escape hole while significantly high pressure was maintained to avoid decompression sickness and a return of the water. The rescue operations were led by several groups of experts, the medical team led by Dr. Wünsche, an aviation medic. 
The miners received games, cameras (copies of the photos were returned to them) and a special diet. Various communication channels to friends and loved ones were established. After their rescue on 1 November, rescue equipment was moved off-site, as there seemed to be no hope for the remaining men. A memorial church service for the missing men was already scheduled for 4 November.

== The &quot;Alter Mann&quot; rescue==

A worker called Hütter, whose long-time foreman was among the missing, suggested a further escape zone on the previous Sunday to the technical director Ferling. This last escape resort was in an abandoned part of the mine, in (&quot;old man&quot;). Under normal conditions, it was absolutely forbidden to enter this area, but workers now and then had a look at &quot;Alter Mann&quot; areas or used them to take a rest or shortcut. The suggestion led to a final hole being drilled down to this highly dangerous and unstable area. When contact with a new group of 11 survivors was established via hammer signal, newspapers and media worldwide began to speak of a miracle. As the experienced rescuers had hoped, more than 20 miners had fled into the &quot;Alter Mann&quot; as water rose in the newer parts of the mine. By the time the drill came down, only 11 had survived amid the falling rock, debris, wounded and dying comrades and different water levels. They had only a bottle of tea with them and the batteries of their helmet lamps had to be rationed. Due to instability, the final steps of drilling were done with a compressor.

After a few more days of drilling rescue access holes, the 11 miners were brought to safety on 7 November after being trapped for two weeks. They were rescued from a depth of via a diameter shaft, using a device called Dahlbusch bomb. The remaining 29 workers had died; 19 were killed directly in the disaster, 10 in the aftermath while awaiting rescue.
There were some harsh discussions about why and whether this last resort had not been suggested earlier. As it was revealed later, rumours about the &quot;Alter Mann&quot; as a possible refuge had been raised as early as two days after the flooding. However these had not been taken into account till the formal attempt by Hütter. &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; described some rumours about East German involvement against critics as well a sort of psychological barrier between different hierarchy levels as reason for the late search in the &quot;Alter Mann&quot;.
== Media presence==
The turn of events, with the various dramatic efforts to reach and rescue the survivors, attracted international media attention. There was stiff competition between the 365 press people and 83 journalists and technicians of TV and radio stations. The reporters used fixed telephone lines temporarily provided and leased by the inhabitants of Lengede. Press reporter Gerhard Mauz and his Volkswagen beetle got celebrity status, since he had occupied a central place 50 m away from the borehole and was using the phone line of the local railway station inn to report from the car.

Others, especially press people, were less lucky. A French press journalist, Jean Yves Grandmange was beaten 5 times while attempting interviews. Because special equipment provided by different TV and radio stations was also used to provide communication with the miners, these reporters received privileged access. Chancellor Ludwig Erhard personally visited the mine site and spoke with the miners. Erhard had formally obtained permission from his cabinet members to skip normal duties and visit the site. Over 450 journalists from all over the world were present when the last miners were rescued.

This event, along with the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II 10 years earlier, became a hallmark for early TV coverage of events with international interest. The rescue was the first significant news story to receive current daily &quot;breaking news&quot; television coverage, and it made watching the &quot;Tagesschau&quot; a sort of ritual in Western Germany.

== In popular culture ==
In 1969, Rudolf Jugert made the first movie about the events. Several TV documentaries have been shot as well, such as &quot;Das Wunder von Lengede oder Ich wünsch&#x27; keinem was wir mitgemacht haben&quot; in 1979 by ZDF and &quot;Das Drama von Lengede, Protokoll einer Katastrophe&quot; in 2003 by WDR. 
In 2003, a two-part television film titled &quot;Das Wunder von Lengede&quot; (or &quot;&quot;) was produced by German television station Sat.1. The film was written by Benedikt Röskau based on the recollections of one of the rescued miners. It was directed by Kaspar Heidelbach and featured Heino Ferch, Jan Josef Liefers, , Heike Makatsch, Axel Prahl, Uwe Rohde, Armin Rohde, Klaus J. Behrendt and Thomas Heinze. It was first broadcast on 9–10 November 2003 and was televised in Sweden, among others. 
The film won a Grimme Award in 2004.

The television series &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; (1965–1966), about a rescue organization, was inspired by this disaster.

<doc id="342495" wikidata="Q7271018" url="?curid=342495" title="Vile Bodies">
<text>Vile Bodies is the second novel by Evelyn Waugh, published in 1930. It satirises the bright young things, the rich young people partying in London after World War I, and the press which fed on their doings. 
The original title &quot;Bright Young Things&quot;, which Waugh changed because he thought the phrase had become too clichéd, was used in Stephen Fry&#x27;s 2003 film adaptation. The eventual title appears in a comment made by the novel&#x27;s narrator in reference to the characters&#x27; party-driven lifestyle: &quot;All that succession and repetition of massed humanity... Those vile bodies...&quot;.
The book was dedicated to B. G. and D. G., Waugh&#x27;s friends Bryan Guinness and his wife Diana.

==Plot==
Adam Symes has a novel to finish and, with the proceeds, plans to marry Nina Blount. Returning from France, his manuscript is impounded as obscene by customs officers, while in the next room his friend Agatha Runcible is strip searched as a suspected jewel thief. She rings the newspapers about her fate. Adam rings Nina to say he cannot now marry her, and has to negotiate a penal new contract with his publisher.

Winning £1,000 on a bet, Adam gives it to a drunk major to place on a horse, but the major disappears. After a fancy dress party, where he meets up with Nina and Agatha, the young people go back to the home of a quiet girl who turns out to be the Prime Minister&#x27;s daughter. Agatha, who is in Hawaiian costume, is kicked out, to the delight of press photographers. The implication of orgies at 10 Downing Street causes the collapse of the government.

Nina suggests that Adam asks her widowed father in the country for money to marry on. The eccentric old man comes up with a cheque for £1,000 and, in celebration, Adam takes Nina to a country hotel to claim her virginity. She claims not to have enjoyed it, and also points out to Adam that the signature on the cheque reads Charlie Chaplin.

The next big party in London is being held by Margot Metroland, whose private business is recruiting girls for Latin American brothels, and will feature an American lady evangelist with her choir of female angels. The party is crashed by Simon Balcairn, a friend of Adam&#x27;s who is a gossip columnist, but Simon is kicked out and in despair gasses himself.

Simon&#x27;s job is offered to Adam, who initially devotes much of his column to the exploits of his friends but finds he can only broaden the scope by invention. A dim childhood friend of Nina is transformed in dashing man-about-town Ginger Littlejohn. Still unable to marry, Nina suggests another attempt at her father. Adam finds the old man involved in the shooting of a historical film on his estate and comes away empty-handed.

While he was away, he got Nina and other friends to write his column, for which he is sacked. With friends, Adam goes to some motor races where he sees the drunk major, who says he has got Adam&#x27;s winnings but then disappears. A drunk Agatha takes off in a racing car and crashes with serious injuries, from which she later dies.

Nina announces that she is engaged to Ginger. Later Ginger confronts Adam with &quot;serious talk&quot; about Nina, in response to which the jobless, penniless and defeated Adam jokingly proposes to &quot;sell his share in her&quot; and settles for £78/16/2 in order to pay a hotel bill. The nuptial pair fly off to France for their honeymoon, but Ginger is unable to join Nina for Christmas at the house of her father, who he has not yet met. Adam steps into the breach, sharing a bedroom as Nina&#x27;s husband and watching her father&#x27;s maladroit film.

War breaks out, in which Adam finds himself alone on a devastated battlefield in France. He comes across the drunk major, now a general, who still has his winnings (although heavily devalued now) and invites him to champagne in his staff car. There they find one of the evangelist&#x27;s angels, back in Europe after her experiences in the South American entertainment industry. While general and angel flirt, an exhausted Adam falls asleep.

==Style==
Heavily influenced by the cinema and by the disjointed style of T. S. Eliot, &quot;Vile Bodies&quot; is Waugh&#x27;s most ostentatiously &quot;modern&quot; novel. Fragments of dialogue and rapid scene changes are held together by the dry, almost perversely unflappable narrator. 
Waugh said it was the first novel in which much of the dialogue takes place on the telephone. The book shifts in tone from light-hearted romp to bleak desolation (Waugh himself later attributed it to the breakdown of his first marriage halfway through the book&#x27;s composition). Some have defended the novel&#x27;s downbeat ending as a poetically just reversal of the conventions of comic romance.

==Influence==
David Bowie cited the novel as the primary influence on his composition of the song &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;.

A film adaptation, titled &quot;Bright Young Things&quot;, was released in 2003, written and directed by Stephen Fry.

<doc id="342502" wikidata="Q326188" url="?curid=342502" title="Pomerelia">
<text>Pomerelia, also known as Eastern Pomerania, Vistula Pomerania, and also before World War II as Polish Pomerania, is a historical sub-region of Pomerania on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea in northern Poland.

[[Gdańsk Pomerania]] is largely coextensive with Pomerelia, but slightly narrower, as it does not include Chełmno Land or Michałów Land.

Its largest and most important city is Gdańsk. Since 1999 the region has formed the core of Pomeranian Voivodeship.

==Overview==
Pomerelia is located in northern Poland west of the Vistula river and east of the Łeba river, mostly within the Pomeranian Voivodeship, with southern part located in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship and small parts in West Pomeranian Voivodeship. It has traditionally been divided into Kashubia, Kociewie, Tuchola Forest and Chełmno Land (including the Michałów Land, sometimes with the addition of Lubawa Land). The Lauenburg and Bütow Land is considered by Polish historiography a part of Kashubia (and thus Gdańsk Pomerania and Pomerelia), while German historiography tends to treat it as a part of Farther Pomerania. Pomerelia has been inhabited by ethnic Kashubians, Kociewians, Borowians and Chełminians, respectively.

==Name==
In the Polish language, the area has been called (&#x27;Pomerania&#x27;) since the Early Middle Ages. In the early 14th century, the Teutonic Knights invaded and annexed the region from Poland into their monastic state, which already included historical Prussia, located east of the region. As a result of Teutonic rule, in German terminology, the name of Prussia was extended to annexed Polish lands like Vistula/Eastern Pomerania, although it was never inhabited by Baltic Prussians but by Slavic Poles.

After the area was reintegrated with Poland in 1466, both names were in use: &quot;Pomerania&quot; was used when referring to the Pomeranian Voivodeship (Gdańsk Pomerania) and the Chełmno Voivodeship, while &quot;Royal Prussia&quot; was used as the name of the wider province, which, however, also included the Malbork Voivodeship and the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia, covering the Prussian historical areas of Pomesania, Pogesania and Warmia, the only actual Prussian territories of the province. 
After the Partitions of Poland, the area was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia and formed part of the newly established province of &quot;West Prussia&quot;, and the name &quot;Pomerania&quot; was avoided by Prussian or German authorities in relation to this region.

Outside of the Kingdom of Prussia and later Germany, the area was termed Polish Pomerania () since at least the 18th century to distinguish it from Hither and Farther Pomerania, territories long outside of Polish rule. In the late 19th century this term was used in order to underline Polish claims to that area that was then ruled by the German Kingdom of Prussia. The designation of Polish Pomerania became obsolete since Farther Pomerania and a small part of Hither Pomerania were also transferred to Poland as part of the territories recovered from Germany, following World War II.

==History==
===Outline===
====Early history====
In its early history, the territory which later became known as Pomerelia was the site of the Pomeranian culture (also called the Pomerelian face urn culture, 650-150 BC), the Oksywie culture (150 BC-AD 1, associated with parts of the Rugii and Lemovii), and the Wielbark Culture (AD 1–450, associated with Veneti, Goths, Rugii, Gepids). In the mid-6th century Jordanes mentioned the Vistula estuary as the home of the Vidivarii. Pomerelia was settled by West Slavic and Lechitic tribes in the 7th and 8th centuries.

====Early medieval Poland====
In the tenth century, Pomerelia was already settled by West-Slavic Pomeranians. The area was conquered and incorporated into early medieval Poland either by Duke Mieszko I – the first historical Polish ruler - in the second half of the tenth century or even earlier, by his father, in the 940s or 950s – the date of incorporation is unknown. Mieszko founded Gdańsk to control the mouth of the Vistula between 970 and 980. According to Józef Spors, despite some cultural differences, the inhabitants of the whole of Pomerania had very close ties with residents of other Piast provinces, from which Pomerelia was separated by large stretches of woodlands and swamps.

The Piasts introduced Christianity to pagan Pomerelia, though it is disputed to what extent the conversion materialized. In the eleventh century the region had loosened its close connections with the kingdom of Poland and subsequently for some years formed an independent duchy. Most scholars suggest that Pomerelia was still part of Poland during the reign of king Bolesław I of Poland and his son Mieszko II Lambert. However, there are also different opinions e.g. Peter Oliver Loew suggests the Slavs in Pomerelia severed their ties with the Piasts and reverted the Piasts&#x27; introduction of Christianity already in the first years of the 11th century. The exact date of separation is unknown, however. It was suggested that the inhabitants of Pomerelia participated in the Pagan reaction in Poland, actively supported Miecław who intended to detach Masovia from the power of the rulers of Poland, but after the defeat of Miecław in 1047 accepted the rule of duke Casimir I the Restorer and that the province remained a part of Poland till the 1060s, when Pomerelian troops took part in the expedition of the Polish king Bolesław II the Generous against Bohemia in 1061 or 1068. Duke Bolesław suffered a defeat during the siege of Hradec and had to retreat to Poland. Soon after Pomerelia separated from his realm. A campaign by Piast duke Władysław I Herman to conquer Pomerelia in 1090–91 was unsuccessful, but resulted in the burning of many Pomerelian forts during the retreat.

In 1116, direct control over Pomerelia was reestablished by Bolesław III Wrymouth of Poland, who by 1122 had also conquered the central and western parts of Pomerania. While the latter regions (forming the Duchy of Pomerania) regained independence quickly, Pomerelia remained within the Polish realm. It was administered by governors of a local dynasty, the Samborides, and subordinated to the bishopric of Włocławek. In 1138, following the death of Bolesław III, Poland was fragmented into several provincial principalities. The &quot;principes&quot; in Pomerelia gradually gained more local power, evolving into semi-independent entities, much like other fragmented Polish territories, with the difference that the other parts of the realm were governed by Piast descendants of Bolesław III. The Christian centre became Oliwa Abbey near Gdańsk.

Two Samborides administering Pomerelia in the 12th century are known by name: Sobieslaw I and his son, Sambor I.

====Danish conquest and independence====
In 1210, king Valdemar II of Denmark invaded Pomerelia, whose &quot;princeps&quot; Mestwin I became his vassal. The Danish suzerainty did not last long, however. Mestwin had already gained more independence from Poland and expanded southward, and his son Swietopelk II, who succeeded him in 1217, gained full independence in 1227.

====Duchy of Pomerelia====
After Mestwin I&#x27;s death, Pomerelia was internally divided among his sons Swietopelk II, Wartislaw, Sambor II and Ratibor. Swietopelk II, who took his seat in Gdańsk, assumed a leading position over his brothers: Sambor II, who received the castellany of Lubieszewo (the center later moved to Tczew), and Ratibor, who received the Białogard area, were initially under his tutelage. The fourth brother, Wartislaw, took his seat in Świecie, thus controlling the second important area besides Gdańsk. Wartislaw died before 27 December 1229, his share was to be given to Oliwa Abbey by his brothers. The remaining brothers engaged in a civil war: Sambor II and Ratibor allied with the Teutonic Order and the Duke of Kuyavia against Swietopelk, who in turn allied with the Old Prussians, took Ratibor prisoner and temporarily assumed control over the latter&#x27;s share. The revolt of the Old Prussians against the Teutonic Order in 1242 took place in the context of these alliances. Peace was restored only in the Treaty of Christburg (Dzierzgoń) in 1249, mediated by the later pope Urban IV, then papal legate and archidiacone of Lüttich (Liege).

In the west, the Pomerelian dukes&#x27; claim to the lands of Schlawe (Sławno) and Stolp (Słupsk), where the last Ratiboride duke Ratibor II had died after 1223, was challenged by the Griffin dukes of Pomerania, Barnim I and Wartislaw III. In this conflict, Swietopelk II initially won the upper hand, but could not force a final decision.

Swietopelk II, who styled himself &quot;dux.&quot; since 1227, chartered the town of Gdańsk with Lübeck law and invited the Dominican Order. His conflicts with the Teutonic Order, who had become his eastern neighbor in 1230, were settled in 1253 by exempting the order from the Vistula dues. With Swietopelk II&#x27;s death in 1266, the rule of his realm passed to his sons Wartislaw and Mestwin II. These brothers initiated another civil war, with Mestwin II allying with and pledging allegiance to the Brandenburg margraves (Treaty of Arnswalde/Choszczno 1269). The margraves, who in the 1269 treaty also gained the land of Białogarda, were also supposed to help Mestwin II securing the lands of Schlawe (Sławno) and Stolp (Słupsk), which after Swietopelk II&#x27;s death were in part taken over by Barnim III. With the margraves&#x27; aid, Mestwin II succeeded in expelling Wartislaw from Gdansk in 1270/71. The lands of Schlawe/Slawno, however, were taken over by Mestwin II&#x27;s nephew Wizlaw II, prince of Rügen in 1269/70, who founded the town of Rügenwalde (now Darlowo) near the fort of Dirlow.

In 1273, Mestwin found himself in open conflict against the margraves who refused to remove their troops from Gdańsk, Mestwin&#x27;s possession, which he had been forced to temporarily lease to them during his struggles against Wartisław and Sambor. Since the lease had now expired, through this action, the Margrave Conrad broke the Treaty of Arnswalde/Choszczno and subsequent agreements. His aim was to capture as much of Mestwin&#x27;s Pomerelia as possible. Mestwin, unable to dislodge the Brandenburgian troops himself called in the aid of Bolesław the Pious, whose troops took the city with a direct attack. The war against Brandenburg ended in 1273 with a treaty (possibly signed at Drawno Bridge), in which Brandenburg returned Gdańsk to Mestwin while he paid feudal homage to the margraves for the lands of Schlawe (Sławno) and Stolp (Słupsk).

On February 15, 1282, High Duke of Poland and Wielkopolska Przemysł II and the Duke of Pomerelia Mestwin II, signed the Treaty of Kępno which transferred the suzerainty over Pomerelia to Przemysł. As a result of the treaty the period of Pomerelian independence ended and the region was again part of Poland. Przemysł adopted the title &quot;dux Polonie et Pomeranie&quot; (Duke of Poland and Pomerania). Mestwin, per the agreement, retained &quot;de facto&quot; control over the province until his death in 1294, at which time Przemysł, who was already the &quot;de jure&quot; ruler of the territory, took it under his direct rule.

The hereditary ruleta of the Duchy included as follows:
:*Świętobor, Duke (11th–12th century)
:*Swietopelk I, Duke (1109/13–1121)
:*Sobieslaw I, Duke (1150s–1177/79)
:*Sambor I, Duke (1177/79–1205)
:*Mestwin I, Duke (1205–1219/20)
:*Swietopelk II, Duke (1215–1266)
:*Mestwin II, Duke (1273–1294)
:*Przemysł II, Duke (1294–1296)

====Late medieval Poland====
After the death of Mestwin II of Pomerania in 1294, his co-ruler Przemysł II of Poland, according to the Treaty of Kępno, took control over Pomerelia. He was crowned as king of Poland in 1295, but ruled directly only over Pomerelia and Greater Poland, while the rest of the country (Silesia, Lesser Poland, Masovia) was ruled by other Piasts. However, Przemysł was murdered soon afterwards and succeeded by Władysław I the Elbow-high. Władysław, sold his rights to the Duchy of Kraków to King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia in 1297 and accepted him as his suzerain in 1299. However, he lost control of Greater Poland and Pomerelia in 1300 after a nobility revolt. These were captured by Wenceslaus who now, after gaining most of the Polish lands, was crowned in Gniezno as king of Poland by archbishop Jakub Świnka Upon the deaths of Wenceslaus and his successor Wenceslaus III and with them the extinction of the Přemyslid dynasty, Pomerelia was recaptured by Władysław I the Elbow-high in 1306.

====Teutonic Order====


During Władysław&#x27;s rule, the Margraviate of Brandenburg staked its claim on the territory in 1308, leading the local governor appointed by Władysław I the Elbow-high to request assistance from the Teutonic Knights, who evicted the Brandenburgers but took the area for themselves, annexing and incorporating it into the Teutonic Order state in 1309 (Teutonic takeover of Danzig (Gdańsk) and Treaty of Soldin/Myślibórz). At the same time, Słupsk and Sławno became part of the Duchy of Pomerania. This event caused a long-lasting dispute between Poland and the Teutonic Order over the control of Gdańsk Pomerania. It resulted in a series of Polish–Teutonic Wars throughout the 14th and 15th centuries.

====Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth====
In 1440, many cities of the region joined the newly formed anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation. In 1454, the organization asked Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon to reincorporate the region into the Kingdom of Poland, to which the King agreed and signed an act of re-incorporation in Kraków. After the subsequent Thirteen Years&#x27; War (1454–1466), the longest of all Polish–Teutonic wars, the Teutonic Knights renounced any claims to the region and recognized it as part of Poland. Pomerelia was organized into the Pomeranian Voivodeship, part of the larger Polish provinces of Royal Prussia within Greater Poland Province. Lauenburg and Bütow Land (Lębork and Bytów) was a Polish fief ruled by Pomeranian dukes until 1637, when it was incorporated directly into Poland. In early modern times Gdańsk was the biggest city of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and most of its exports (especially grain) were made through the port. Gdańsk and Żuławy Wiślane were mostly German/Dutch-speaking Lutheran or Reformed, while most of the region remained Polish/Kashubian Catholic. In the 17th century Pomerelia was attacked and destroyed by a Swedish army.

====Partitions of Poland====
Pomerelia was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia during the late 18th century Partitions of Poland, becoming part of the new Province of West Prussia, and part of Germany in 1871. The region was subjected to intense Germanisation policies.

====Interwar period====
After World War I, in 1918, Poland regained its independence as the Second Polish Republic, and the Treaty of Versailles restored most of the region from Weimar Germany back to Poland, forming the Pomeranian Voivodeship (Greater Pomerania as of 1938). Gdańsk with Żuławy became the Free City of Danzig. In the interbellum, German propaganda coined the term of Polish Corridor in reference to the region.

====World War II====
The region was the site of the Battle of Westerplatte, the first battle of the German invasion of Poland which started World War II in September 1939, as well as several other important battles incl. at Hel, Gdynia and Kępa Oksywska. Afterwards it was occupied and illegally annexed by Nazi Germany, and the Polish population was subjected to various crimes, such as mass arrests, imprisonment, slave labor, kidnapping of children, deportations to Nazi concentration camps and genocide, incl. the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;. The Germans established the Stutthof concentration camp, the first Nazi concentration camp outside of pre-war German borders, with multiple subcamps in the region. Major sites of massacres of Poles in the region included Piaśnica, Szpęgawsk, Mniszek, Igielska Valley, Luszkówko, Skarszewy, Rudzki Most and Grupa.

====Post-war period====
After the defeat of Germany in the war in 1945, almost the entire region, including the former Free City of Danzig, was reclaimed by Poland according to the Potsdam Agreement, except for a small portion of the Vistula Spit around the village of Narmeln (Polski) which was annexed by the Soviet Union. The local German minority population which included numerous members of the Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz complicit in its atrocities, fled or was expelled to Germany, also in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement.

====Contemporary====
Historic Pomerelia nowadays forms the bulk of the Pomeranian Voivodeship, but its southern part is part of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, while a small western fragment (Gmina Biały Bór) is in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship.

===Historical population===

During the Early Middle Ages Pomerelia (the name comes from Proto-Slavic &quot;po more&quot;, which means &quot;land at the sea&quot;) was inhabited by West Slavic, Lechitic tribes, with occasional presence of Scandinavians operating a few trading posts in the area. The region then became a territory of the nascent Polish state and continued as such (briefly interrupted by a Danish invasion) into the 12th century. In contrast to the gradual and mostly peaceful process of Ostsiedlung occurring at the time in some other regions such as Silesia or Farther Pomerania, Pomerelia was instead violently overrun by the State of the Teutonic Order including the principal city of the territory. In the latter case, the troops of the German monastic state exterminated the original Polish inhabitants of the city and initiated a massive colonisation campaign to hastily repopulate the area with numerous German-speaking settlers, especially in major urban areas, while in smaller towns and in rural areas, speakers of Kashubian and Greater Polish (i.e. Kociewiacy, and Borowiacy) predominated. The Teutonic Order developed the land in amelioration projects, dyking of the founding of German-settled Estates and villages.

As the result of the Thirteen Years&#x27; War of 1454-1466, Pomerelia became part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland again, within the province of Royal Prussia (which along Pomerelia also included the western rim of the actual region of Prussia, namely Warmia as well as Malbork Land, the latter comprising northern parts of Pomesania and Pogesania). After the Partitions of Poland in 1772–1795, historical Pomerelia became part of the new province of West Prussia within the Kingdom of Prussia. Temporarily, during the Napoleonic Wars until 1815, Gdańsk became a Free City, while southern portions of West Prussia with Toruń became parts of the Duchy of Warsaw. Perhaps the earliest census figures (from years 1817 and 1819) about the ethnic or national composition of the region come from Prussian data published in 1823. At that time, entire West Prussia (of which historical Pomerelia was part) had 630,077 inhabitants – 327,300 ethnic Poles (52%), 290,000 Germans (46%) and 12,700 Jews (2%). In this data Kashubians are included with Poles, while Mennonites (numbering 2% of West Prussia&#x27;s population) are included with Germans.

Another German author, Karl Andree, in his book &quot;&quot; (Leipzig 1831), gives the total population of West Prussia as 700,000 inhabitants – including 50% Poles (350,000), 47% Germans (330,000) and 3% Jews (20,000).

There are also estimates of the religious structure (number of temples) of the pre-1772 Pomerelian Voivodeship of Poland. Around year 1772 that voivodeship had 221 (66,6%) Roman Catholic, 79 (23,8%) Lutheran, 23 (6,9%) Jewish, six (1,8%) Mennonite, two (0,6%) Czech Brethren and one (0,3%) Calvinist churches:

<text>The five &quot;solae&quot; ( from the Latin &#x27;, lit. &quot;alone&quot;; occasionally [[Anglicized]] tofive solas) of the Protestant Reformation are a foundational set of Christian theological principles held by theologians and clergy to be central to the doctrines of justification and salvation as taught by the Lutheranism, Reformed and Evangelical branches of Protestantism, as well as in some branches of Baptist and Pentecostalism.

Each &quot;sola&quot; represents a key belief in these Protestant traditions that is putatively distinct from the theological doctrine of the Catholic Church, although they were not assembled as a theological unit until the 20th century. The Reformers are known to have only stated two of the five &quot;solae&quot; clearly. Even today there are differences as to what constitutes the &quot;solae,&quot; how many there are, and how to interpret them to reflect the Reformers&#x27; beliefs.

==History==
The solae were not systematically articulated together as a set of five until the 20th century; however, &quot;sola gratia&quot; and &quot;sola fide&quot; were used in conjunction by the Reformers themselves.

In 1554, for example, Philip Melanchthon wrote, &quot;sola gratia justificamus et sola fide justificamur&quot; (&quot;only by grace do we justify and only by faith are we justified&quot;). All of the solae appear in writings by the Protestant Reformers, but they are not catalogued together by any.

In 1916, Lutheran scholar Theodore Engelder published an article titled &quot;The Three Principles of the Reformation: &quot;Sola Scriptura, Sola Gratia, Sola Fides&quot;&quot; (&quot;only scripture, only grace, only faith&quot;). In 1934, theologian Emil Brunner substituted &quot;Soli Deo gloriam&quot; for &quot;Sola Scriptura&quot;. In 1958, historian Geoffrey Elton, summarizing the work of John Calvin, wrote that Calvin had &quot;joined together&quot; the &quot;great watchwords&quot;. Elton listed &quot;sola fide&quot; with &quot;sola gratia&quot; as one term, followed by &quot;sola scriptura&quot; and &quot;soli Deo gloria&quot;. Later, in commenting on Karl Barth&#x27;s theological system, Brunner added &quot;Christus solus&quot; to the litany of solas while leaving out &quot;sola scriptura&quot;. The first time the additional two solae are mentioned is in Johann Baptiste Metz&#x27;s 1965, &quot;The Church and the World&quot;.

==The three &quot;solae&quot;==
In most of the earliest articulations of the solae, three were typically specified: scripture over tradition, faith over works, and grace over merit. Each was intended to represent an important distinction compared with teachings claimed in Catholic doctrine.

===&quot;Sola scriptura&quot; (&quot;by scripture alone&quot;)===
&quot;Sola scriptura&quot; is upheld by Lutheran and Reformed theologies and asserts that scripture must govern over church traditions and interpretations which are themselves held to be subject to scripture. All church traditions, creeds, and teachings must be in unity with the teachings of scripture as the divinely inspired Word of God.

The doctrine of &quot;sola scriptura&quot; affirms that scripture is the only source of normative, apostolic, infallible revelation and that “all things necessary for salvation and about faith and life are taught in the Bible with sufficient clarity so that the ordinary believer can find it there and understand it.”

This particular sola is sometimes called the formal principle of the Reformation, since it is the source and norm of the material cause or principle, the gospel of Jesus Christ that is received &quot;sola fide&quot; (Latin ablative, sōlā fidē, meaning &quot;by faith alone&quot;) and &quot;sola gratia&quot; (Latin ablative, &quot;sōlā grātiā&quot;, meaning &quot;by grace alone&quot; or by God&#x27;s favor). The adjective (&quot;sola&quot;) and the noun (&quot;scriptura&quot;) are in the ablative case rather than in the nominative case to indicate that the Bible does not stand alone apart from God, but rather that it is the instrument of God by which he reveals himself for salvation through faith in Christ (&quot;solus Christus&quot; or &quot;solo Christo&quot;).

It should be emphasized that this doctrine in no way denies tradition, reason, or experience as sources of truth. There is nothing in Sola Scriptura that eliminates other authorities. What it does say is that there is only one authority that can absolutely bind the conscience, that authority is holy scripture and that all controversies about doctrine and theology must be resolved in the final analysis by scripture.

===&quot;Sola fide&quot; (&quot;by faith alone&quot;)===


Sola fide is summarized in the Thirty-nine Articles of the Anglican church, specifically Article XI &quot;Of the Justification of Man&quot;:

Bishop Scott J. Jones in &quot;United Methodist Doctrine&quot; writes that in Methodist theology:

For Luther, baptism is a work of God by which the forgiveness of sins and salvation earned by Christ&#x27;s death, and confirmed by Christ&#x27;s resurrection, are given to the baptized person who believes God&#x27;s Word that says He is doing exactly that in baptism. Infant baptism is not only appropriate, but urged: &quot;We bring the child in the conviction and hope that it believes, and we pray that God may grant it faith; but we do not baptize it upon that, but solely upon the command of God.&quot;

The Bible talks about the idea of being justified by faith opposed to &quot;works of the law&quot;:For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law. Romans 3:28 ESV

For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from first to last,[a] just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.” Romans 1:17

===&quot;Sola gratia&quot; (&quot;by grace alone&quot;)===

&quot;Sola gratia&quot;, or &quot;only grace&quot;, specifically excludes the merit done by a person as part of achieving salvation. &quot;Sola gratia&quot; is the teaching that salvation comes by divine grace or &quot;unmerited favor&quot; only, not as something merited by the sinner. A famous verse used to back up this doctrine is:For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast. Ephesians 2:8-9

Protestant Arminians, such as Methodists, are synergists but may also claim the doctrine of &quot;sola gratia&quot;, though they understand it quite differently than Lutherans and Calvinists do. Arminians believe that God saves only by grace and not at all by merit, but man, enabled by what is referred to as &quot;prevenient grace&quot;, is enabled by the Holy Spirit to understand the Gospel and respond in faith. Arminians believe that this is compatible with salvation by grace alone, since all the actual saving is done by grace. Arminians believe that humans are only capable of receiving salvation when first enabled to do so by prevenient grace, which they believe is distributed to everyone. Arminians therefore do not reject the conception of &quot;sola gratia&quot; expounded by Lutheran and Reformed theologians, although their interpretation of it is quite different.

John Owen, in &quot;A Display of Arminianism&quot;, rejects the implied belief that the understanding of the Reformed theology has any alliance between the two doctrines and Arminianism is but another form of pelagianism, known as semipelagianism.

==The five &quot;solae&quot;==
While the Reformers of the 16th century wrote of all five solae in various period writings, they are not all mentioned together in one place and were not systematically brought together until the 20th century.

===&quot;Solus Christus&quot; or &quot;solo Christo&quot; (&quot;Christ alone&quot; or &quot;through Christ alone&quot;)===

&quot;Solus Christus&quot;, or &quot;only Christ&quot;, excludes the priestly class as necessary for sacraments. &quot;Solus Christus&quot; is the teaching that Christ is the only mediator between God and man, and that there is salvation through no other. For this reason, the phrase is sometimes rendered in the ablative case, &quot;solo Christo&quot;, meaning that salvation is &quot;by Christ alone&quot;.

With regard to Lutheran theology, while rejecting all other mediators between God and man, classical Lutheranism continues to honor the memory of the Virgin Mary and other exemplary saints. This principle rejects sacerdotalism, the belief that there are no sacraments in the church without the services of priests ordained by apostolic succession. Martin Luther taught the &quot;general priesthood of the baptized&quot;, which was modified in later Lutheranism and classical Protestant theology into &quot;the priesthood of all believers&quot;, denying the exclusive use of the title &quot;priest&quot; (Latin &quot;sacerdos&quot;) to the clergy. This principle does not deny the office of the holy ministry to which is committed the public proclamation of the Gospel and the administration of the sacraments. In this way, Luther in his &quot;Small Catechism&quot; could speak of the role of &quot;a confessor&quot; to confer sacramental absolution on a penitent; the section in this catechism known as &quot;The Office of the Keys&quot; (not written by Luther but added with his approval) identifies the &quot;called ministers of Christ&quot; as being the ones who exercise the binding and loosing of absolution and excommunication through Law and Gospel ministry.

This binding and loosing is laid out in the Lutheran formula of holy absolution: the &quot;called and ordained servant of the Word&quot; forgives penitents&#x27; sins (speaks Christ&#x27;s words of forgiveness: &quot;I forgive you all your sins&quot;) without any addition of penances or satisfactions and not as an interceding or mediating &quot;priest&quot;, but &quot;by virtue of [his] office as a called and ordained servant of the Word&quot; and &quot;in the stead and by the command of [his] Lord Jesus Christ&quot;. In this tradition absolution reconciles the penitent with God directly through faith in Christ&#x27;s forgiveness rather than with the priest and the church as mediating entities between the penitent and God.

===&quot;Soli Deo gloria&quot; (&quot;glory to God alone&quot;)===

&quot;Soli Deo gloria&quot;, or &quot;glory to God alone&quot;, stands in opposition to the veneration perceived by many to be present in the Roman Catholic Church of Mary the mother of Jesus, the saints, or angels. &quot;Soli Deo gloria&quot; is the teaching that all glory is to be due to God alone, since salvation is accomplished solely through His will and action – not only the gift of the all-sufficient atonement of Jesus on the cross, but also the gift of faith in that atonement, created in the heart of the believer by the Holy Spirit. Some Reformers believed that human beings – even saints canonized by the Roman Catholic Church, the popes, and the ecclesiastical hierarchy – are not worthy of the glory that was accorded them; that is, one should not exalt such humans for their good works, but rather praise and give glory to God.

==Additional &quot;solae&quot;==
More recently, certain scholars have suggested that there should be additional solae on the list: &quot;Sola ecclesia&quot; (&quot;the Church alone&quot;), &quot;Sola caritas&quot; (&quot;Charitable-love alone&quot;) and &quot;Sola Spiritus&quot; (In the &quot;Spirit alone&quot;). At the other end of the spectrum, emerging from the Imiaslavie and Primitive Catholicism streams, some Christians now affirm the &quot;sōlum nōmen&quot; position that the holy “name alone” is all-sufficient, based upon the insight Jesus is “the one name that contains everything”.

<text>The Angry Beavers is an American animated sitcom created by Mitch Schauer for Nickelodeon. The series revolves around the zany hijinks of Norbert and Daggett Beaver, two young beaver brothers who have moved out of their parents&#x27; home to become bachelors in the forest near the fictional Wayouttatown, Oregon. The series premiered in the United States on April 19, 1997, and ended its initial run on November 11, 2003. 5 episodes would not premiere in the United States on Nickelodeon during its initial run and would premiere in that country on Nicktoons in 2006, with the last episode airing on August 27. The complete series has also been released on DVD in Region 1 by Shout! Factory.

==Characters==
===The Angry Beavers===
*Norbert Foster &quot;Norb&quot; Beaver (voiced by Mitchell Whitfield in the pilot and Nick Bakay in the series) is a yellow beaver, who is Daggett&#x27;s older brother by four minutes. Articulate and well-read, Norbert is a highly opinionated beaver who acts as the voice of reason and straight man to his younger brother&#x27;s insane ideas. Despite this, he is very lazy and patronizing towards Daggett. Norbert can be extremely and unjustifiably selfish at times, and tends to bully, insult, and take advantage of his brother, which usually backfires in some way but does not lead to any permanent consequences for him like it does for Daggett. 
*Daggett Doofus &quot;Dag&quot; Beaver (voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz) is a brown beaver, and the younger brother of Norbert by four minutes. Energetic and childish, Daggett has a habit of over-the-top and sensitive emotions, as well as a self-defence mechanism of name-calling. Those things could very well have to do with how he is constantly treated badly. He seems to have a love-hate relationship with Norbert, helping and antagonizing him as his mood requires. He may or may not be aware that Norbert is abusing him. He has a telephone in the likeness of Bullwinkle J. Moose from &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;.

===Supporting and recurring===
*Stump is a giant sequoia stump who is a close friend of Norbert and Daggett. He frequents many of the beavers&#x27; social events, forming an integral part of their inner friendship circle. He is apparently alive, although he is never seen doing anything on screen, and he does not talk, at least out loud. When Daggett first met Stump in the Season One episode &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Stumping to Dinner?&quot;, he was jealous of him, but Stump brought Norbert and Daggett closer together, essentially by emotionally manipulating Daggett. In the Season Two episode &quot;Stump Looks for His Roots&quot;, he journeys off in search of his real family. Norbert and Daggett almost ate Stump while they were in a cave in the Season Three episode &quot;What&#x27;s Eating You?&quot;
*Treeflower (voiced by Cynthia Mann) is Norbert&#x27;s girlfriend who is an orange hippie beaver with many jobs outside the forest. Treeflower first met Norbert in &quot;Bummer of Love,&quot; but her first appearance was in an earlier episode titled &quot;Long in the Teeth&quot; which takes place after they first met. She once dated Truckee the Shrew in the Season Two episode &quot;Tree of Hearts&quot;, but since he only cares about his truck they broke up and her and Norbert have had romantic feelings for each other again ever since. Treeflower was also Muscular Beaver&#x27;s sidekick, Goody Good Gal. Her careers include elevator songwriter, championship snowboarder, superhero and firefighter. As revealed by series creator Mitch Schauer, she and Norbert were in fact boyfriend and girlfriend during the events of the series and had gotten married and had two daughters, Lily and Petunia after the events of the series.
*Bing (voiced by Victor Wilson) is an annoying talkative lizard who hangs out with Norbert and Dagget. Bing went through a breakup in the Season Three episode &quot;Tough Love.&quot;. Norbert and Daggett also fought over him because he told all the other creatures that they were both constantly ditching him in another Season Three episode &quot;Nice &amp; Lonely.&quot;. Bing has a tendency to talk fast. Bing is able to camouflage himself to blend with his surroundings like a chameleon but is able to lose and generate his tail like a skink or a gecko, proving that he is an unrealistic species. Bing has a girlfriend named Wanda.
*Barry Bear (voiced by John Garry) is Norbert and Daggett&#x27;s disco/funk-loving grizzly bear best friend, whose voice and personality is modeled on Barry White. Barry is a vegetarian despite being a bear. He once made a disco album after everybody got sick of Beaver Fever. In the Season Two episode &quot;Un-Barry-Able, Barry felt awkward around Norbert because he was acting like Daggett. In the Season Three episode &quot;Finger Lickin&#x27; Goofs,&quot; the beavers thought Barry was going to eat them (a lie that Bill Licking made up).
*Truckee (voiced by Mark Klastorin in most appearances and Mitch Schauer in &quot;Dag&#x27;s List&quot;) is a truck-loving shrew, who Daggett hates immensely. He drives a big truck around called &quot;Big Renee&quot;. In the Season Four episode &quot;The Posei-Dam Adventure&quot;, Truckee once worked together with Daggett when a &quot;volnado&quot; (a combination of a tornado and volcano) threatened to destroy his dam. Though they escaped, he stole all of Norbert&#x27;s stuff (he could not take Daggett&#x27;s stuff because Daggett had it all nailed down). He can be seen without his outfit on and is very volatile about the size of his ears, as revealed in the Season One episode &quot;Enter the Daggett&quot;. He also has a minor crush on Treeflower, as shown in the Season Two episode &quot;Tree of Hearts&quot;.
*Big Rabbit (voiced by Scott Weil in most appearances and Richard Steven Horvitz in &quot;Omega Beaver&quot;) is Norbert and Daggett&#x27;s toughest friend. It is revealed that he sent a threatening note to them and set up a bodyguard business so they would be his friend in the Season Three premiere episode &quot;My Bunnyguard&quot;. Norb and Dag eventually meet his family in the Season Four episode &quot;Big Fun&quot;.
*Wolffe D. Wolf (voiced by Wally Wingert) is an easygoing gray wolf who is a close friend of Norbert and Daggett and is the opposite of the typical wolfish stereotype.
*Chelsea Beaver (voiced by Chelsea Schauer) is one of Norbert and Daggett&#x27;s younger sisters and a female doppelgänger of Daggett. Chelsea is also manic and naive like Daggett.
*Stacy Beaver (voiced by Stacy Schauer) is another of Norbert and Daggett&#x27;s younger sisters and a female doppelgänger of Norbert. Stacy is also level-headed and sardonic like Norbert.
*Leonard Beaver (voiced by Tim Thomerson in most appearances and Lorin Dreyfuss in &quot;If You In-Sisters&quot;) is the lazy and scruffy father of Norbert, Daggett, Chelsea, and Stacy. In the Season Three episode &quot;A Little Dad&#x27;ll Do You&quot;, he once stayed with Norbert and Daggett because their mother and sisters left to visit their grandmother. Leonard has a strange condition called the &quot;poo spot&quot; (when someone presses it, it makes a flatulence noise). In the Season Three episode &quot;Slap Happy&quot;, he also encourages Dag to slap his tail even though beavers are only supposed to use the slap for emergencies.
*Rose Beaver (voiced by Sheryl Bernstein in her cameo appearance &quot;Up All Night&quot;, Linda Phillips in &quot;Kandid Kreatures&quot;, Marcia Wallace in &quot;If You In-Sisters&quot; and Ruth Buzzi in &quot;The Mom from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;) is Norbert, Dagget, Chelsea, and Stacy&#x27;s mother and Leonard&#x27;s wife. She is a secret agent as well as a housewife.
*High Princess (voiced by Beverly Garland) is the leader of the female raccoon tribe and the beavers&#x27; nemesis who appears twice in the series. During her first appearance, she mistakes Daggett for a god because he had a knot hole on his head. However, Norbert and Daggett end up destroying the knot hole. She gets even with the beavers by having her tribe cook their dam over an open flame. During her second appearance, it was revealed that she was the one pranking Norb and Dag.
*Bill Licking (voiced by Gregg Berger) is a wig-wearing wildlife television host and Norbert and Daggett&#x27;s influence and sometimes rival. In the Season Two episode &quot;Kandid Kreatures&quot;, he had a contract with the beavers to make them look good but instead he humiliated them. The beavers got even with him by attacking him on his show.
*Laverta Lutz (voiced by Kate Donahue) is a big, careless Southern-accented magical woman who works in the bowing alley as a maintenance worker who always bumps into Daggett for making wishes for him. She helped Dag bowl better, helped him win arguments against Norb, and transported him to a world where Norb was an only child.
*El Grapadura (voiced by Timothy Borquez in most appearances, Luke Torres in &quot;Kandid Kreatures&quot; and Joe Lala in some episodes) is the Mexican Luchador, Norbert and Daggett&#x27;s favorite wrestling hero. His name translates in English as The Stapler.
*Oxnard Montalvo (voiced by Tom Kane) is Norbert and Daggett&#x27;s favorite B movie actor. Norbert and Daggett once helped him save the world from the monsters in his movies because they brought them to life by remembering his films. Scientist #1 managed to make him do his movies in color. Unlike most humans in the series, Oxnard, along with Toluca and Dr. Cowtiki, is drawn more realistically.
*Toluca Lake (voiced by Adrienne Barbeau, Sheryl Bernstein as &quot;Actress Sarah&quot; in lUp All Night&quot;) is an actress who plays the damsel in distress in Oxnard&#x27;s B-Movies.
*Dr. Cowtiki (voiced by William Schallert) is the other actor who played the scientist in the B-Movies with Oxnard and Toluca.
*Scientist #1 (voiced by Edward Winter) is a mad scientist who laughs in an evil way as he does his job for science and is the main antagonist of the series and archenemy of Norbert and Daggett. Scientist #1 always mistakes the beavers for pointy weasels. His chest hair is literally in the shape of a one and in one episode, it is revealed that he does not have eyes underneath his glasses, though in previous episodes he was shown with eyes. In the Season Three episode &quot;I Am Not An Animal, I&#x27;m Scientist #1&quot;, he once accidentally transformed himself into a beaver and built a futuristic society.

==Production==
===Conception and development===
&quot;The Angry Beavers&quot; was the brainchild of Mitch Schauer, and was co-developed by Keith Kaczorek. Prior to the series, Schauer was originally an assistant storyboard artist for other Nickelodeon shows, such as &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, and &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;. Schauer also storyboarded 8 episodes of the 1992 &quot;Addams Family&quot; television series. During his time as producer of the Warner Bros. animated series &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; in 1995&quot;,&quot; Gunther-Wahl Productions Inc. (Schauer&#x27;s employer at the time) requested three ideas for animated series, as the studio had the opportunity to pitch a show to Nickelodeon. One of the three ideas that Schauer presented was an early concept for &quot;The Angry Beavers&quot;. Schauer wasn&#x27;t even present for the pitch meeting, his ideas being pitched for him by the production company instead. Of the three ideas, network producer Mary Harrington was intrigued by the Beavers. &quot;The Angry Beavers&quot; was inspired from Schauer&#x27;s early years in Oklahoma when he was homeless and often spotted beavers in a nearby river. The initial concept of the show centered on two bad-tempered, politically incorrect beavers that hated anything that was a fad, cause, or just popular in the media. &quot;I tend to develop things that are counterculture&quot;, stated Schauer. &quot;I like to buck whatever is popular at the time or considered society&#x27;s way of doing things, because you get more interest when you stand outside the box&quot;. Schauer was against making the beavers cute, as a response to many of the &quot;soft, safe&quot; character designs at the time. He also cited cartoons such as &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;, &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, and &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; as primary influences for the show.

During production of the series, Schauer and the crew began to learn more about real world beavers and implemented their traits into the show&#x27;s storylines, considering himself to have become a &quot;beaver expert&quot; by the end of its run. Traits adapted into the show include their endlessly growing incisors, tail slapping, and scent glands. During his time at Nickelodeon, Schauer gifted Harrington a personally signed log that was bitten by a beaver, though he later admitted in 2017 that he bit it himself.

Richard Steven Horvitz and Nick Bakay were chosen as voice actors for main beavers Daggett and Norbert, respectively. Gunther-Wahl held auditions for over 300 different actors, but Schauer settled on the two because they embodied the two beavers&#x27; characters perfectly, also being impressed by their chemistry upon being introduced to one another. He recalled the two frequently going off-script while recording, which he encouraged, considering their improvisation leading to some of the series&#x27; best moments. Schauer was influenced by classic Hollywood director Howard Hawks for the show&#x27;s ad-libbing and overlapping of dialogue.

===Challenges, censorship, and &quot;Bye Bye Beavers&quot;===
There was often tension between the show&#x27;s staff and Nickelodeon, with the channel imposing seemingly arbitrary restrictions on the show&#x27;s content. An example includes season one&#x27;s &quot;Go Beavers&quot; where they rejected a scene that would have featured a blimp crashing into an audience of people, while a scene in the same segment featuring out of control zambonis that wipe into and supposedly kill a crowd of people didn&#x27;t meet any objections, nor did the instances of Norbert savagely beating Daggett with a stick and ignoring his many injuries. Most infamously, the words &quot;Shut up!&quot; were initially censored in the 1998 segment &quot;Alley Oops&quot;. Writer Micah Wright attributed this to then-Nickelodeon president Herb Scannell, quoting him as saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t like it when children say &#x27;Shut up,&#x27; so if we never say it on our show, children will never say it in the real world&quot;. Wright further claimed that Scannell &quot;would make these sweeping pronouncements about the way the world worked, and the way that kids thought, and what he wanted the world to look like&quot;, also imposing a &quot;no-drag&quot; policy, which forbade characters dressing in non-gender conforming clothing in order to prevent &quot;sexual confusion&quot; amongst the show&#x27;s younger viewers. Nick Bakay, voice of Norbert, also expressed displeasure with the network, dubbing them &quot;not very artist-friendly&quot;.

While the show was popular and was renewed for four seasons, staff continued to push against the network&#x27;s Standards and Practices division. &quot;We were significantly over budget, behind schedule, and had generally worn out our welcome [with the network]&quot; recalled series co-developer Keith Kaczorek. As the series faced cancellation, the crew devised a finale segment, &quot;Bye Bye Beavers&quot;, where the Beavers are informed by mail that their show is cancelled. During the segment, they openly criticize the network for cancelling shows and syndication, wrestle with their existence as cartoon characters, and even referencing the infamous censoring of the words &quot;shut up&quot;. The segment was set to end with both beavers being &quot;killed off&quot; and sent to cartoon heaven. The segment was expected to be fully produced, as Nickelodeon initially approved the premise of the segment, but as production went on they reversed their decision. Production was halted as the segment went against the network&#x27;s policies of forbidding any reference to a show ending or characters dying. As a result, the segment only exists in the form of leaked storyboards and audio (the latter being released by Richard Steven Horvitz, voice of Daggett, in 2006). Margie Cohn, then-executive vice president of the network&#x27;s original programming, admitted that the segment&#x27;s script was &quot;beautifully crafted, funny, and clever&quot;, but ultimately the network was against the idea of killing off characters that its audience had grown to love.

Schauer would sometimes poke fun at the network&#x27;s demands. The segment &quot;The Legend of Kid Friendly&quot; (where the Beavers face off against a cyborg cowboy literally named &quot;Kid Friendly&quot;) was created as a response to broadcast standards notes received from the network. &quot;One of the most repeated notes was &#x27;make sure it&#x27;s kid-friendly&#x27;, so it seemed natural to write a story around the comment&quot;, said Schauer. Weapons featured in the show typically received feedback requesting them be redesigned to be &quot;larger and more colorful&quot;, to which the crew would happily oblige. Despite the crew typically being at odds with network censorship, Schauer considers the experience working with Nickelodeon a positive one.

&quot;The Angry Beavers&quot; was the final (and most notable) animated series produced by Gunther-Wahl Productions Inc., which was later shut down in 2001, two years before the series ended its run.

==Episodes==

== Reception ==
The Angry Beavers received positive reviews from critics. In a positive review, Harlene Ellin of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; praised the show for its humor, visuals, cultural references, and nonsensical plots, writing &quot;Although the story lines can be pure silliness, the characters are well-developed and likable, whether they&#x27;re fighting each other or working together. But most of all, [this show is] downright funny. And dam it, &#x27;The Angry Beavers&#x27; is definitely that.&quot; Hollywood.com considered the show to be &quot;truly the most clever and mature cartoon to air on Nickelodeon&quot;, praising its &quot;whip-smart&quot; dialogue and cultural references, considering it underappreciated when compared to Nickelodeon&#x27;s other classic cartoons. Spencer Coriarty of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; wrote, &quot;Together the two seem to get involved in every odd occurrence conceivable [...] the animation here is rather stunning, as is the offbeat writing which includes throwbacks to 1950s sci-fi. Creative as it is sporadic, &quot;The Angry Beavers&quot; is chaotic, nutty, whacky, and fun in the best possible way.&quot; Olivia Armstrong of &quot;Decider&quot; praised the show for appealing to older audiences, saying &quot;Not only did &quot;you&quot; love to watch the adventures of Norbert and Daggett Beaver, but so did your parents and older siblings, without pestering you to hand over the remote. Perhaps it was the pure slapstick comedy or their bizarre, sometimes inappropriate friends and neighbors, but those beavers will go down in history as the funniest dam dwellers to ever exist and the oddest way to bring your family together.&quot; Andrea Graham of Common Sense Media spoke positively of the series, writing &quot;While the series&#x27; humor may seem sophomoric, it&#x27;s actually quite funny.&quot;

=== Awards and nominations ===
==Home media==
Nickelodeon and Amazon.com teamed up to release &quot;The Angry Beavers&quot; and other Nick shows on manufacture-on-demand DVD-R discs available exclusively through Amazon&#x27;s CreateSpace arm.

&quot;The Angry Beavers&quot; sets, among others, were discontinued when Nick began releasing traditional DVDs of many of their series in association with Shout! Factory. The first DVD release for &quot;Angry Beavers&quot; was the Seasons 1 and 2 4-disc set on August 23, 2011. Season 3: Part 1 was released in a 2-disc set on February 28, 2012. Season 3: Part 2 was released in a 2-disc set on August 14, 2012. Season 4 (The Final Season) was released in a 2-disc set on February 4, 2014.

On July 30, 2013, Shout! Factory released the complete series set in Region 1.

In Australia, &quot;The Angry Beavers&quot; has been released on DVD by Beyond Home Entertainment.
==Video games==
Though the series has no official video games, Norbert and Daggett appear in &quot;Nicktoons Racing&quot; and &quot;Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2&quot; as playable characters. The two also make cameo appearances in &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Nicktoons MLB&quot;.

==Future==
On January 5, 2016, Mitch Schauer mentioned on the Apathetic Enthusiasm Podcast episode titled &quot;The Not So Angry Animator&quot; that he would be open to the idea of bringing the series back and getting the original actors involved if he could. He also revealed that his daughter Chelsea Schauer came up with the title &quot;ReSpooted&quot; and that Norbert would be married and he would have children with Treeflower while Daggett would still be single.

On June 11, 2017, Patricia Miranda interviewed Mitch on her podcast titled Old School Lane and Mitch brought up that it would be a parody of &quot;The Shining&quot;. He also said he&#x27;s pitched it to Nickelodeon and they&#x27;ve been &quot;on and off&quot; about it.

On January 7, 2018, Nickelodeon Animation&#x27;s Tumblr page said this about the possibility of a revival: &quot;Nothing&#x27;s being whispered down the halls right now...but you never know!&quot;

On April 19, 2022, Mitch Schauer and various people who worked on the series were interviewed again by Miranda in celebration of the twenty fifth anniversary of the series. Mitch expanded upon the &quot;ReSpooted&quot; idea, stating that the specific genders of Norbert and Treeflower&#x27;s children would be two daughters named Lily and Petunia and that Daggett would still visit them from time to time.

<doc id="342509" wikidata="Q157484" url="?curid=342509" title="Offal">
<text>Offal (), also called variety meats, pluck or organ meats, is the internal organs of a butchered animal. The word does not refer to a particular list of edible organs, and these lists of organs vary with culture and region, but usually exclude skeletal muscle. Offal may also refer to the by-products of milled grains, such as corn or wheat.

Some cultures strongly consider offal consumption to be taboo, while others use it as part of their everyday food or, in many instances, as delicacies. Certain offal dishes—including &quot;foie gras&quot; and &quot;pâté&quot;—are often regarded as gourmet food in the culinary arts. Others remain part of traditional regional cuisine and are consumed especially during holidays; some examples are sweetbread, Jewish chopped liver, Scottish haggis, U.S. chitterlings, and Mexican menudo. On the other hand, intestines are traditionally used as casing for sausages.

Depending on the context, &quot;offal&quot; may refer only to those parts of an animal carcass discarded after butchering or skinning; offal not used directly for human or animal consumption is often processed in a rendering plant, producing material that is used for fertilizer or fuel; or in some cases, it may be added to commercially produced pet food. In earlier times, mobs sometimes threw offal and other rubbish at condemned criminals as a show of public disapproval.

==Etymology and terminology==

The word shares its etymology with several Germanic words: West Frisian &#x27;, German ( in some Western German dialects and Luxembourgish), &quot;afval&quot; in Dutch and Afrikaans, &quot;avfall&quot; in Norwegian and Swedish, and in Danish. These Germanic words all mean &quot;garbage/rubbish&quot; or &quot;waste&quot; or—literally—&quot;off-fall&quot;, referring to that which has fallen off during butchering. However, these words are not often used to refer to food except for Afrikaans in the agglutination (lit. &quot;off-fall-flesh&quot;), which does indeed mean offal. For instance, the German word for offal is meaning innards and the Swedish word is &#x27; literally meaning &quot;inside-food&quot;. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word entered Middle English from Middle Dutch in the form &quot;&quot;, derived from &quot;af&quot; (off) and &quot;vallen&quot; (to fall). 

It is not related to the English word &quot;awful&quot;, which originally meant &quot;inspiring awe,&quot; then shifted meaning to &quot;terrifying&quot; and then to &quot;very bad.&quot;

Organ meat is typically referred to with established terms used for other edible parts of the animal, such that the heart of a cow would be known as beef heart, while that of a pig would be known as pork heart.

In some parts of Europe, scrotum, brain, chitterlings (pig&#x27;s small intestine), trotters (feet), heart, head (of pigs, calves, sheep and lamb), kidney, liver, spleen, &quot;lights&quot; (lung), sweetbreads (thymus or pancreas), fries (testicles), tongue, snout (nose), tripe (reticulum) and maws (stomach) from various mammals are common menu items.

===Great Britain===
In medieval times, &quot;humble pie&quot; (originally &quot;umble pie&quot;) made from animal innards (especially deer) was a peasant food and is the source of the commonly used idiom &quot;eating humble pie&quot;, although it has lost its original meaning as meat pies made from offal are no longer referred to by this name. The traditional Scottish haggis consists of a sheep&#x27;s stomach stuffed with a boiled mix of liver, heart, lungs, rolled oats, and other ingredients. In the English Midlands and South Wales, faggots are made from ground or minced pig offal (mainly liver and cheek), bread, herbs, and onion wrapped in pig&#x27;s caul fat.

Only two offal-based dishes are still routinely served nationwide at home and in restaurants and are available as pre-cooked package meals in supermarket chains: steak and kidney pie (typically featuring veal or beef kidneys), still widely known and enjoyed in Britain, and liver (of lamb, calf, pig or cow) and onions served in a rich sauce (gravy).

Brawn (the British English term for &#x27;head cheese&#x27;) is the collection of meat and tissue found on an animal&#x27;s skull (typically a pig) that is cooked, chilled and set in gelatin. Another British food is black pudding, consisting of congealed pig&#x27;s blood with oatmeal made into sausage-like links with pig intestine as a casing, then boiled and usually fried on preparation.

&quot;Luncheon tongue&quot; refers to reformed pork tongue pieces. &quot;Ox tongue&quot; made from the pressed complete tongue, is more expensive. Both kinds of tongue are found in tinned form and in slices in supermarkets and local butchers. Home cooking and pressing of tongue have become less common over the last fifty years.

Bleached tripe was a popular dish in Northern England (especially in South Lancashire), with many specialist tripe shops in industrial areas. Today in South Lancashire, certain markets (for example, in Wigan) may still sell tripe, but all the specialist tripe shops have now closed.

&quot;Elder&quot; is the name given to cooked cow&#x27;s udder—another Lancashire offal dish rarely seen today. Offal connoisseurs such as Ben Greenwood OBE have frequently campaigned to bring Elder back on the menu of restaurants across Yorkshire and Lancashire.
===Ireland===

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the poor in Ireland ate offal as they could not afford the more prized cuts; black pudding, pig&#x27;s feet, lamb liver, lamb and veal kidney and sweetbreads were all popular. In the late 18th century, Dublin saw rioting when local butchers began to export offcuts of beef, instead of selling them locally.

A famous fictional consumer of offal is Leopold Bloom of James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; (published 1922, set in 1904 Dublin):

Ireland exports large amounts of offal (€134 million in 2022), with Irish beef tongue being popular in Japan.

Offal consumption has risen in recent years as there is growing awareness of the nutritional benefits, including from fitness influencers.

===Nordic countries===
====Norway====
In Norway the &quot;smalahove&quot; is a traditional dish, usually eaten around and before Christmas time, made from a sheep&#x27;s head. The skin and fleece of the head is torched, the brain is removed, and the head is salted, sometimes smoked, and dried. The head is boiled for about three hours and served with mashed rutabaga/swede and potatoes. The ear and eye (half of a head is one serving) are normally eaten first, as they are the fattiest area and must be eaten warm. The head is often eaten from the front to the back, working around the bones of the skull. &quot;Smalahove&quot; is considered by some to be unappealing or even repulsive. It is mostly enjoyed by enthusiasts and is often served to tourists and more adventurous visitors.

Other Norwegian specialities include &quot;smalaføtter&quot;, a traditional dish similar to &quot;smalahove&quot;, but instead of a sheep&#x27;s head, it is made of lamb&#x27;s feet. &quot;Syltelabb&quot; is a boiled, salt-cured pig&#x27;s trotter, known as a Christmas delicacy for enthusiasts. Syltelabb is usually sold cooked and salted.

Liver pâté (&quot;leverpostei&quot;) and patéd lung (&quot;lungemos&quot;) are common dishes, as are head cheese (&quot;sylte&quot;) and blood pudding (&quot;blodklubb&quot;). Fish roe and liver are also central to several Norwegian dishes, such as &quot;mølje&quot;.

====Denmark====

In Denmark, a version of liver pâté known as &quot;leverpostej&quot; and used as a spread (often in an open sandwich on rye bread) is popular. The most common main ingredients of &quot;leverpostej&quot; are pork liver, lard, and anchovies, but numerous alternative recipes exist. The 5.5 million Danes consume roughly 14,000 tons of &quot;leverpostej&quot; per year, the most popular commercial brand being Stryhn&#x27;s. Versions of brawn (often served on rye bread as an open sandwich with a garnish of cucumber slices or Dijon mustard and pickled beetroot) and blood sausage (served pan-fried with muscovado) are eaten mainly during wintertime, including as part of the traditional Danish Christmas lunch or &quot;julefrokost&quot;.
Heart is commonly eaten, either calf, cow, or pork. &quot;Grydestegte hjerter&quot; is a Sunday dish of stuffed pork heart, served with carrots, Brussels sprouts, and mashed potatoes.

====Iceland====
Iceland has several traditional dishes using offal. The Icelandic &quot;slátur&quot; (lit. slaughter) consists of &quot;blóðmör&quot; (blood sausage) and &quot;lifrarpylsa&quot; (liver sausage), typically boiled and served with mashed potatoes. &quot;Blóðmör&quot; is a sausage made of lamb&#x27;s blood, suet and rye, while &quot;lifrarpylsa&quot; is made of lamb&#x27;s liver, suet and rye. Similar to the Norwegian &quot;smalahove&quot;, the Icelandic &quot;svið&quot; is the head of a sheep with the wool singed off, boiled and typically served with mashed potatoes and mashed &quot;rutabaga&quot;.

====Sweden====

Sweden has a version of the British black pudding called &quot;blodpudding&quot; (blood pudding). The Swedish analogue of Scottish haggis is called &quot;pölsa&quot; or &quot;lungmos&quot; (mashed lung). The Swedish &quot;pölsa&quot; is made of offal like liver or heart, onions, rolled barley and spices, and is served with boiled potatoes, fried eggs, and sliced beetroot. &quot;Blodpudding&quot; is mostly served sliced and fried with lingonberry preserve, grated carrot or cabbage, and fried bacon. Other popular offal dishes are &quot;levergryta&quot; (liver stew) and &quot;leverpastej&quot; (liver pâté).

====Finland====

Finland also has its own version of black pudding, &quot;mustamakkara&quot; (black sausage). There is also liver sausage, usually eaten as a spread on bread, similar to the Danish &quot;leverpostej&quot;. Liver is also eaten in various other forms including fried slices and minced liver patties. Liver casserole, traditionally made with minced liver, rice, butter, onions, egg, syrup, and usually, raisins used to be mainly a Christmas dish, but is now available and eaten all year round. Many traditional and modern game recipes use offal. One of the most popular offal dishes is &quot;verilettu&quot; (or &quot;veriohukainen&quot; or &quot;verilätty&quot;) which translates to blood pancake, a pan-fried thin bread-like snack traditionally enjoyed with lingonberry jam. &quot;Verilettu&quot; is common in Sweden and Norway, going by the name &quot;Blodplättar&quot;.

===Western Europe===
In France, the city of Lyon is well known for its offal: &quot;andouillette&quot;, &quot;tablier de sapeur&quot; (breaded tripe), &quot;foie de veau&quot;, &quot;rognons à la crème&quot;, and &quot;tripes&quot;, among others.
In Marseille, lamb&#x27;s trotters and a package of lamb tripe are a traditional food under the name &quot;&quot;pieds et paquets&quot;.

Especially in southern Germany, some offal varieties are served in regional cuisine. The Bavarian expression &quot;Kronfleischküche&quot; includes skirt steak and offal as well, e.g., &#x27;, a sausage containing small pieces of spleen, and even dishes based on udder. Swabia is famous for &quot;Saure Kutteln&quot;—sour tripes served steaming hot with fried potatoes. &quot;Herzgulasch&quot; is a (formerly cheaper) type of goulash using heart. Liver is part of various recipes, such as some sorts of &quot;Knödel&quot; and &quot;Spätzle&quot;, and in &quot;Liverwurst&quot;. As a main dish, together with cooked sliced apple and onion rings, liver (&quot;Leber Berliner Art&quot;, liver Berlin style) is a famous recipe from the German capital. Helmut Kohl&#x27;s preference for &quot;Saumagen&quot; was a challenge to various political visitors during his terms as German Chancellor. &#x27; are small dumplings made with bone marrow; they are served as part of &quot;Hochzeitssuppe&quot; (wedding soup), a soup served at marriages in some German regions. In Bavaria, lung stew is served with &quot;Knödel&quot;, dumplings. Blood tongue, or &quot;Zungenwurst&quot;, is a variety of German head cheese with blood. It is a large head cheese made with pig&#x27;s blood, suet, bread crumbs, and oatmeal with chunks of pickled beef tongue added. It has a slight resemblance to blood sausage. It is commonly sliced and browned in butter or bacon fat prior to consumption. It is sold in markets pre-cooked, and its appearance is maroon to black in color.

In Austrian, particularly Viennese cuisine, the &quot;Beuschel&quot; is a traditional offal dish. It is a sort of ragout containing veal lungs and heart. It is usually served in a sour cream sauce and with bread dumplings (&quot;Semmelknödel&quot;). A type of black pudding by the name of &quot;Blunzn&quot; or &quot;Blutwurst&quot; is also common. In traditional Viennese cuisine, many types of offal including calf&#x27;s liver (&quot;Kalbsleber&quot;), sweetbread (&quot;Kalbsbries&quot;), or calf&#x27;s brain with egg (&quot;Hirn mit Ei&quot;) have played an important role, but their popularity has strongly dwindled in recent times.

In Belgium several classic dishes include organ meat. Beef or veal tongue in tomato-Madeira sauce with mushrooms and kidneys in mustard cream sauce are probably the most famous ones. The famous &quot;stoofvlees&quot; or carbonade flamande, a beef stew with onions and brown beer, used to contain pieces of liver or kidney, to reduce the costs. Pork tongues are also eaten cold with bread and a vinaigrette with raw onions or mustard.

===Southern Europe===

In Italy consumption of entrails and internal organs is widespread. Among the most popular are fried or stewed brains; boiled stomach (trippa), often served in a tomato sauce; lampredotto (the fourth stomach of the cow), boiled in broth and seasoned with parsley sauce and chilli; liver (stir-fried with onions, roasted); kidneys; heart and coronaries ( or animelle); head, eyes, and testicles of a pig; and several preparations based on chicken entrails. &quot;Pajata&quot;, a traditional dish from Rome, refers to the intestines of an unweaned calf, i.e., fed only on its mother&#x27;s milk. Soon after nursing, the calf is slaughtered, and its intestines are cleaned, but the milk is left inside. When cooked, the combination of heat and the enzyme rennet in the intestines coagulates the milk to create a thick, creamy, cheese-like sauce. &quot;Pajata&quot; and tomatoes are often used to prepare a sauce for rigatoni. In Sicily, many enjoy a sandwich called &quot;pani câ mèusa&quot;, bread with spleen and caciocavallo cheese. In the Italian neighborhoods of Brooklyn, New York, where it is also commonly eaten, it goes by the name &quot;vastedda&quot;,&quot;, which in Sicilian refers to the bread only. In Norcia and other parts of Umbria, pig&#x27;s bowels are also cured with herbs, chili peppers, and spices, then dried and smoked to make a tough, spicy sausage in which the bowel, instead of serving only as the usual casing, is the main ingredient.

Italy&#x27;s Florentine cuisine includes cow brain.

In Spain, the visceral organs are used in many traditional dishes, but the use of some of them is falling out of favor with the younger generations. Some traditional dishes are &quot;callos&quot; (cow tripe, very traditional in Madrid and Asturias), liver (often prepared with onion or with garlic and parsley, and also as breaded steaks), kidneys (often prepared with sherry or grilled), sheep&#x27;s brains, &quot;criadillas&quot; (bull testicles), braised cow&#x27;s tongue, pig&#x27;s head and feet (in Catalonia; pig&#x27;s feet are also traditionally eaten with snails), pork brains (part of the traditional &quot;tortilla sacromonte&quot; in Granada), and pig&#x27;s ears (mostly in Galicia). There are also many varieties of blood sausage (&quot;morcilla&quot;), with various textures and flavours ranging from mild to very spicy. Some of the strongest are as hard in texture as chorizo or salami, while others are soft, and some types incorporate rice, giving the stuffing a haggis-like appearance. &quot;Morcillas&quot; are added to soups or boiled on their own, in which case the cooking liquid is discarded. They are sometimes grilled but rarely fried. Also coagulated, boiled blood is a typical dish in Valencia (cut into cubes and often prepared with onion or tomato sauce).

In Portugal traditionally, viscera and other animal parts are used in many dishes. Trotters (also known as &quot;chispe&quot;), tripe, and pig&#x27;s ears are cooked in bean broths. Tripe is famously cooked in Porto, where one of the most traditional dishes is tripe in the fashion of Porto, &quot;tripas à moda do Porto&quot;. Pig&#x27;s ears are usually diced into squares of cartilage and fat and pickled, after which they are eaten as an appetizer or a snack. Also common the use of stew of chicken stomach (&quot;moelas&quot;), mostly used as an appetizer. The cow&#x27;s brain () is also a delicacy, although consumption has decreased since the Creutzfeldt–Jakob outbreak. The blood of the pig is used to produce a form of black pudding known as , which includes flour and seasonings. A wide variety of offal and pig blood is made into a traditional soup of the north of Portugal called . Chicken feet are also used in soups.

In Greece (and similarly in Turkey, Albania and North Macedonia), consists of liver, spleen, and small intestine, roasted over an open fire. A festive variety is (from Turkish , Macedonian ), traditional for Easter; pieces of lamb offal (liver, heart, lungs, spleen, kidney and fat) are pierced on a spit and covered by washed small intestine wound around in a tube-like fashion, then roasted over a coal fire. Another traditional Easter food is &quot;magiritsa&quot;, a soup made with lamb offal and lettuce in a white sauce, eaten at midnight on Easter Sunday as an end to the lenten fast. Tzigerosarmas (from Turkish , meaning &quot;liver wrap&quot;) and &quot;gardoumba&quot; are two varieties of and made in different sizes and with extra spices. In Turkey, &quot;mumbar&quot;, beef or sheep tripe stuffed with rice, is a typical dish in Adana in southern Turkey. Paça soup is made from lamb or sheep feet, except in summer. If lamb or sheep head is added, it becomes &quot;Kelle&quot; &quot;Paça&quot;. Liver is fried, grilled, skewed and additive of pilaf. Liver shish can be eaten at breakfast in Şanlıurfa, Diyarbakır, Gaziantep and Adana. Brain can be fried or baked. It can also be consumed as salad.

===Eastern Europe===

In Romania, there is a dish similar to haggis called , which is served at Easter. Romanian families make a kind of traditional sausage from pork offal, called &quot;&quot;, the main difference being that is enclosed in abdominal membranes () of the animal, while chitterlings is used for . A popular dish of tripe soup called is similar to . Also in Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Turkey, is a widespread soup variety.

There is also a twofold variation on the concept of head cheese: &quot;piftie&quot; which does contain gelatin, is served cold and is usually only made from pork or beef (traditionally only pork), but does not contain as much head material (usually only the lower legs and ears are used since they contain large amounts of gelatin) and which is exclusively made of meat and tissue found on the head (save for the eyes and usually only made from lamb; addition of brain and tongue varies by local habit). is made by first boiling the head whole (to soften the meat and make it easier to peel off) and then peeling/scraping off all meat and tissue from it. A generous amount of garlic or garlic juice, the &quot;mujdei&quot;, is then added and the dish is served warm.

Finally, there are many dishes in Romania that are based on whole offal, such as grilled pig and cow kidney (served with boiled or steam cooked vegetables—usually peas and carrot slices); butcher&#x27;s brain called &quot;creier pane&quot; (usually lamb&#x27;s brains, rolled in batter and deep-fried); tongue and olives stew (mostly done with cow tongue) and many others.

The Armenian traditional dish known as &quot;khash&quot; is a traditional meal with inexpensive ingredients, originating in the Shirak region. The main ingredient in &quot;khash&quot; is pig&#x27;s or cow&#x27;s feet, although other animal parts, such as the ears and tripe, may also be used. Formerly a nutritious winter food for the poor, it is now considered a delicacy, and is enjoyed as a festive winter meal.

In Hungary, a variety of traditional dishes are based on offal. &quot;Pacal&quot; or &quot;pacalpörkölt&quot; (tripe stew), a popular spicy stew, considered a national dish, is made from beef tripe. Ground or chopped pork offal is usually made into a hearty sausage known as &quot;disznósajt&quot; (lit. &quot;pig cheese&quot;) somewhat resembling haggis. Puddings and sausages made with blood (&quot;véres hurka&quot;) and liver (&quot;májas hurka&quot;) are also quite common, especially as part of the &quot;&quot;disznótoros&quot;,&quot; a dish of different sausages produced from pork. Heart, liver and gizzards of chicken are a traditional part of chicken soup. Gizzards can also be made into a stew (&quot;zúzapörkölt&quot;). While decreasing in popularity, stews made from poultry testicles (&quot;kakashere pörkölt&quot;) are still considered a delicacy and a dish of high prestige in the countryside. Another dish which became less common is &quot;&quot;vese-velő&quot; (pig kidneys with brain). &quot;Szalontüdő&quot; is made out of the heart and lungs of pork.

Offal is not an uncommon ingredient in Polish cuisine. &quot;Kaszanka&quot;, a traditional sausage similar to black pudding, is made with a mixture of pig&#x27;s blood, pig offal and buckwheat or barley usually served fried with onions or grilled. Beef tripe is used to cook a popular soup simply called &quot;flaki&quot; (pl. &quot;guts&quot;). Chicken gizzards or hearts can be a base for various stews or soups, such as &quot;krupnik&quot;, a pearl barley soup (not to be confused with a vodka brand of the same name). Other offal-based soups, less popular today, are Polish blood soup (&quot;czernina&quot;) and tail soup (&quot;zupa ogonowa&quot;), based on a cooked beef tail. Pork or beef liver is often consumed sautéed or grilled with onions; liver is also used as one of the ingredients for stuffing baked whole duck or other poultry, or a piglet. Pâtés containing liver are popular. Pork, beef or veal kidneys, known in Polish as &quot;cynadry&quot;, are typically braised and eaten as a main dish. Pork tongues can be served hot, in a sauce, or cold, set into aspic. Cold pork trotters in aspic are very popular, especially as a companion to vodka. In the past, braised pork or veal brain was a popular snack, but today it is rare.

In Russia, beef liver and tongue are considered valuable delicacies, which may be cooked and served on their own. Kidneys and brains are sometimes used in cooking. The heart is often eaten on its own or used as an additive to the ground meat, as do lungs which give a lighter, airier texture to it. Pig&#x27;s or sheep&#x27;s stomach is sometimes used for &quot;nyanya&quot;, a dish similar to haggis. Head and collagen-rich extremities are used to make &quot;kholodets&quot;—a version of aspic, whereby these body parts are slowly boiled for several hours with meat and spices, removed and discarded, and the remaining broth is cooled until it congeals.

==South America==
In Brazil, &quot;churrasco&quot; (barbecue) often includes chicken hearts, roasted on a big skewer. The typical &quot;feijoada&quot; sometimes contains pork trimmings (ears, feet and tail). Gizzard stews, fried beef liver and beef stomach stews used to be more popular dishes in the past, but are nonetheless still consumed. &quot;Buchada&quot;, a popular dish from the northeast of the country, consists of the diced organs of a goat, which are seasoned and then sewn inside the goat&#x27;s stomach (&quot;bucho&quot;) and boiled. &quot;Dobradinha&quot; is a dish made with tripe, a variation of the northern Portuguese dish. In the Northeast of Brazil the &quot;sarapatel&quot; is a very common dish, usually prepared with pork organs (heart, liver, intestine, and kidneys) boiled along with coagulated pork blood in a spiced stew.

In Argentina and Uruguay, the traditional &quot;asado&quot; is often made along with several offal types (called &quot;achuras&quot;&quot;), like &quot;chinchulines&quot; and &quot;tripa gorda&quot; (chitterlings), &quot;mollejas&quot; (sweetbreads) and &quot;riñón&quot; (cow&#x27;s kidney). &quot;Sesos&quot; (brains) are used to make ravioli stuffing. The tongue is usually boiled, sliced and marinated with a mixture of oil, vinegar, salt, chopped peppers and garlic.

In Colombia, &quot;menudencias&quot; is the name given to the chicken leftovers or offal such as the head, neck, gizzard, and feet. A popular cheap dish containing all this and more is called &quot;sopa de menudencias&quot;. Head cheese is also common. Just like in Argentina, and depending on the region, Colombian asado and &quot;picada&quot; involve many offal types, including &quot;chunchullo&quot; (chitterlings), chicken hearts, and &quot;bofe&quot; (beef lung). &quot;Pelanga&quot; is a dish from the departments of Cundinamarca and Boyaca that contains beef or pork snout (&quot;jeta&quot;), trachea, tongue, and ears. &quot;Pepitoria&quot; is a dish in the department of Santander that involves offal from billy goats (kidney, liver, heart).

In Peru and Bolivia, beef heart is used for &quot;anticuchos&quot;—a sort of &quot;brochette&quot;.
In Chile, the tongue is boiled, sliced and served in a walnut-based sauce in New year and Christmas festivities (&quot;lengua nogada&quot;) while the soup is used later to cook a wheat, milk and spice ball mix called &quot;albóndigas de sémola&quot;. There is also a blood drink called &quot;Ñachi&quot;, made from spiced, fresh blood from a recently slaughtered animal. &quot;Criadillas&quot; or &quot;huevos de toro&quot; (&quot;bull&#x27;s eggs&quot;, testicles) are eaten mostly in cattle-raising regions, while cow udder (&quot;ubres&quot;) is served fried or boiled.

&quot;Sopa de mondongo&quot; is a soup made from diced tripe (the stomach of a cow or pig) slow-cooked with vegetables such as bell peppers, onions, carrots, cabbage, celery, tomatoes, cilantro (coriander), garlic or root vegetables. Variations can also be found in Nicaragua, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Honduras, El Salvador, Panama, Puerto Rico, Venezuela.

==Sub-Saharan Africa==

Sausage is made from the small intestine of a goat, cow or sheep, stuffed with chilli and small chunks of meat, fatty meat, and blood (although some people prefer the bloodless kind). In Kenya, it is commonly referred to as &#x27;mutura&#x27;, which is the Kikuyu name for it. Sheep&#x27;s or goat&#x27;s stomach is also stuffed in a similar way.

In the Kikuyu traditions, grilled goat/sheep kidneys are a delicacy usually reserved for young ladies, although today, anybody can consume it. Similarly, the tongue was reserved for men and the ears were to be eaten by little girls. The testicles were for the young men.
The livers are also consumed. The heads, lungs, and hooves of animals are boiled to make soup and sometimes mixed with herbs for medicinal purposes.

In South Africa offal, locally known as tripe, is enjoyed by South Africans of diverse backgrounds. Due to the popularity of this dish, it is one of the few customs that white (especially Afrikaners) and black South Africans share.

Offal dishes in South Africa do not usually consist of any organs and are mostly limited to stomach skin, sheep&#x27;s head, shin, and very rarely brains. Sheep&#x27;s head has gained many nicknames over the years such as &#x27;skopo&#x27; (township colloquial term meaning head) and &#x27;smiley&#x27; (referring to the expression of the head when cooked).

There are numerous recipes to cook the above-mentioned items available on many South African websites. One of the more popular way to cook offal in South Africa is to cook it with small potatoes in a curry sauce served on rice. Alternatively, it can be served with samp or maize rice.

In Zimbabwe, as in most of sub-Saharan Africa, little of a slaughtered animal goes to waste. Offal is a common relish enjoyed by people of all cultures. Beef and goat offal dishes include the stomach, hooves (trotters), shin, intestines, liver, head, tongue, pancreas, lungs, kidneys, udders, and, very rarely in certain communities, testicles. Beef or goat blood, sometimes mixed with other offal pieces, is often cooked to make a dish known in Shona as &quot;&quot;. Chicken dishes include feet, liver, intestines, and gizzards. A popular preparation of goat or sheep offal involves wrapping pieces of the stomach with the intestines before cooking.

In Nigeria offal is consumed by all the people in Nigeria, in delicacies such as Abula, Edika ikong and white soup. It is called &#x27;Inu eran&#x27; in Yoruba literally meaning the insides of an animal. They have names for some parts which include roundabout, shaki (tripes), Edo (liver).

==East Asia==

===China===

In China, many organs and animal-parts are used for food or traditional Chinese medicine. Since pork is the most consumed non-seafood meat in China, popular pork offal dishes include stir-fried pork kidneys with oyster sauce, ginger and scallions, &quot;五更肠旺—Wu Geng Chang Wang&quot;, a spicy stew with preserved mustard, tofu, pork intestine slices and congealed pork blood cubes. &quot;炸肥肠—Zha Fei Chang&quot;, deep fried pork intestine slices and dipped in a sweet bean sauce, is commonly offered by street hawkers. Pork tongue slices with salt and sesame oil is also a popular dish, especially in Sichuan province. Braised pork ear strips in soy sauce, five-spice powder and sugar is a common &quot;cold plate&quot; appetizer available as hawker food or in major local supermarkets. Stir-fried pork kidneys or liver slices with oyster sauce, ginger and scallions or in soups is a regular dish in southern provinces. Pork blood soup is at least 1,000 years old since the Northern Song dynasty, when the quintessential Chinese restaurant and eateries became popular. Pork blood soup and dumplings, jiaozi, were recorded as food for night labourers in Kaifeng. In Shanghai cuisine, the soup has evolved into the well-known &quot;酸辣湯—Suan La Tang&quot;, Hot and Sour Soup, with various additional ingredients. As well as pork, the offal of other animals is used in traditional Chinese cooking, most commonly cattle, duck, and chicken.

Offal dishes are particularly popular in the southern region of Guangdong and in Hong Kong. For example, Cantonese &quot;燒味—&quot;Siu mei&quot;&quot;, (Barbecued/Roasted Delicacies) shops, have achieved their foundation of influence here. Besides the popular &quot;cha siu&quot; barbecued pork, &quot;siu yuk&quot; crispy skin pork, along with assorted types of poultry, there are also the roasted chicken liver with honey, and the very traditional, and very expensive now, &quot;金錢雞—Gum Chin Gai&quot;, another honey-roasted dim sum that is a sandwich of a piece each of pork fat, pork/chicken liver, ginger and cha siu.

The use of offal in dim sum does not stop there. In dim sum restaurants, the feet of chicken, ducks and pork are offered in various cooking styles. For example, &quot;豬腳薑—Jui Kerk Gieng&quot; (pork feet in sweet vinegar stew) is a popular bowl now besides its traditional function as a supplement for postpartum mother care. Young ginger stems, boiled eggs, and blanched pork feet are stew in sweet black rice vinegar for a few hours to make this. &quot;鴨腳紮—Ap Kerk Jat&quot; (literally Duck leg Wrap) is a piece each of ham, shiitake mushroom and deep-fried fish maw wrapped with duck feet in a dried bean curd sheet in and steamed. The use of fish offal in Cantonese cuisine is not limited to the maw. For example, there is the folksy dish of &quot;東江魚雲煲—Tung Gong Yu Wan Bo&quot;, a casserole with the lips of freshwater large head fish; and shark fin soup.

In the more pragmatic folksy eateries, however, maximum utilization of the food resource is the traditional wisdom. The fish is used in its entirety and nothing is wasted. Deep-fried fish skin is a popular side dish at fish ball noodle shops. The intestines are steamed with egg and other ingredients in Hakka cuisine. Finally, the bones are wrapped in a cotton bag to boil in the soup for noodles.

Teochew cuisine shows its best manifestation also in Hong Kong. The goose meat, liver, blood, intestine, feet, neck and tongue are all major ingredients to various dishes. There is also the must-try soup, pork stomach with whole peppercorns and pickled mustard.

The use of beef organs is classically represented in noodle shops here. Each respectable operation has its own recipe for preparing the stews of brisket, intestine, lung, and varieties of tripe. The big pots are often placed facing the street and next to the entrance such that the mouth-watering aroma is the best draw for the shop&#x27;s business.

Contrary to a common Westerners&#x27; disgust for these dishes due to cultural unfamiliarity and sanitary concerns, these offal items are very well cleaned. The pork intestines&#x27; tough inner skin (which is exposed to bolus and pre-fecal materials) is completely removed. Then, the intestine is exhaustively soaked, cleaned and rinsed. The nephrons of pork kidneys are skillfully excised, and the kidneys are soaked for several hours and cleaned.

The use of the pancreas, liver, kidney, gall bladder, lung and even bronchus of various farm animals together with herbs in Chinese medicine have strong empirical theories and studies are being conducted to try to understand their nature in modern scientific terms. However, there are other strange offal usages in folk practice. Taoist and rural folk beliefs have their influence. The idea of essences and energy, heat and cold, is key. Snake wine with a live snake gallbladder is thought to promote stamina due to the &quot;essences of energy and heat&quot;, which is derived from a snake&#x27;s attributes, such as aggressive behavior (fiery) and venom (energy). When bears were more common in the Chinese northeast, bears claw and dried bear offal were used as medicines, seen as a source of vitality. Dry deer antlers are still a common medicine, thought to provide &quot;yang energy&quot; to complement the male sex and the tail, &quot;yin energy&quot; for the female sex. Extractions of animal penises and testes are still believed to contribute to better male performance and those of the embryo and uterus to the eternal youth of the female. However, these are being marginalized as synthetic hormones get more popular and affordable.

The Cantonese consumed monkey brains, but this is now rare to non-existent, and primarily offered to rich, Western tourists.

===Japan===

Japan also has a long history of eating offal, and the Manyoshu, an anthology compiled around the 7th to 8th century, mentions eating deer liver as a household dish and stomach as salted fish.
There is a popular belief in Japan that people did not eat offal, and that Japan was a Buddhist country and did not eat meat before the Meiji period. In fact, meat was well eaten in Japan even before the Meiji period, and there are many records in written sources, and there is a long history of eating offal in Japan.
A dish of horse offal cooked in a pot has been a common dish since the Edo period, and the Ryukyu Kingdom, which was located in present-day Okinawa, has been in existence since the 15th century and has a custom of eating pork in its entirety, including the offal.
Although there was an official ban on eating meat in Japan during the Edo period, the culture of eating meat actually continued, and many meat dishes from various animals are recorded in literature. In addition, there are still meat specialty restaurants in Japan that have been in business for 300 years. Hormon-yaki was previously known as motsu-yaki, and this dish has long been on the menus of Edo-era restaurants.
There is a popular belief that &quot;nowadays, many restaurants specializing in offal (especially beef offal) can be found in the Korean style,&quot; but this is a misconception. In Japan, there is a dish called &quot;Genghis Khan,&quot; which is a mutton barbecue dish invented in 1910, and together with &quot;Horumonyaki,&quot; it is the root of Japanese yakiniku cuisine.
Korean yakiniku was born in the 1970s when &quot;Japanese yakiniku cuisine&quot; was introduced to Korea, and Japanese yakiniku restaurants began to be established in Korea around 1980. In Japan, horumon-yaki (grilled hormone) existed as an established dish before that, and a variety of organ meats are eaten. The correct answer is not &quot;Korean style can be seen,&quot; but &quot;Japanese offal cuisine was introduced and the culture of eating offal in Korea was established.

===Korea===
In Korea, offal usage is very similar to mainland China but less frequent. Grilled intestine slices and pork blood are both consumed. Headcheese prepared with pork head meat was quite popular in the past. Steamed pork intestines are easy to be found in traditional markets. The popular traditional Korean sausage called sundae is steamed pork small intestines filled with pork blood, seasoned noodles, and vegetables. Pork feet steamed in a special stock are considered a delicacy in Korea. Beef stomach and intestines are still quite popular for cooking. It is not difficult to find grilled chicken hearts, gizzards, and feet in traditional street bars. Medicinal usages are also similar to mainland China and less common with offal uses.

==Southeast Asia==
===Indonesia===

In Indonesia cow and goat internal organs are popular delicacies, it can be fried, made into soto soups or grilled as satay and almost all of the parts of the animal are eaten. &quot;Soto Betawi&quot; is known as the type of soto that uses various kinds of offal, while &quot;soto babat&quot; only uses tripes. Within Indonesian cuisine traditions, the Minangkabau cuisine (popularly known as &quot;Padang food&quot;) are known for their fondness of offal, mostly are made into &quot;gulai&quot; (a type of curry) such as &quot;gulai otak&quot; (brain), &quot;gulai babat&quot; (tripes), &quot;gulai usus&quot; (intestine), &quot;gulai sumsum&quot; (bone marrow), also fried &quot;hati&quot; (liver) and &quot;limpa&quot; (spleen). The cartilage, skin and tendon parts of cow legs are also used in dishes called &quot;tunjang&quot;, &quot;kaki sapi&quot; or &quot;kikil&quot; also can be made as gulai or soto. Cow&#x27;s stomach (&quot;babat&quot;) and intestine (&quot;iso&quot;) are popular, fried or in soup, in Javanese cuisine. Cow&#x27;s lung called &quot;paru&quot;, coated with spices (turmeric and coriander) and fried is often eaten as a snack or side dish. The liver is also sometimes made into a spicy dish called rendang. Cow or goat tongue is sliced and fried, sometimes in a spicy sauce, or more often beef tongue are cooked as semur stew. Brain is sometimes consumed as soto or gulai. The eye is also consumed as soto, while bone marrow is consumed as soup or soto. Cows and goat testicles popularly called &quot;torpedo&quot; are also consumed as satay or soto. Due to their rarity, the testicles are among the most expensive offal in Indonesia.

A non-halal offal dish is popular among Chinese Indonesian community. &quot;Sekba&quot; is a Chinese Indonesian pork offal stewed in mild soy sauce-based soup. The stew tastes mildly sweet and salty, made from soy sauce, garlic, and Chinese herbs. It is a popular fare street food in Indonesian Chinatowns, such as Gloria alley, Glodok Chinatown in Jakarta. The types of pork offal being offered as &quot;sekba&quot; are pig&#x27;s ears, tongue, intestines and lungs.

Avian offal are commonly consumed too. Giblets, liver and intestines of chicken, duck and &quot;burung ayam-ayaman&quot; (watercock) are consumed as delicacies, commonly skewered as satay and being deep-fried. Deep-fried crispy chicken intestine in particular is a popular snack.

===Malaysia and Singapore===
In Malaysia, cow or goat lung, called &quot;paru&quot;, coated in turmeric and fried is often served as a side dish to rice, especially in the ever popular nasi lemak. Tripe is used in a few dishes either stir fried or in a gravy. Tripe is also consumed as satay. The liver is deep-fried or stir-fried in some vegetable dishes.

In Malaysia and Singapore, pig&#x27;s organ soup is a common feature of hawker centres. Due to Singapore&#x27;s proximity and ethnic makeup, many of the items written for Indonesia and Malaysia above are also found in Singapore.

===Philippines===

In the Philippines, people eat practically every part of the pig, including snout, intestines, ears, and innards. The dish &quot;sisig&quot; from Pampanga is traditionally made from the skin on a pig&#x27;s head, and it also includes the ears and brain. The dish from the Ilocos Region also includes the same pig parts, while &quot;warek-warek&quot;, also from the same region, uses pig innards. &quot;Dinuguan&quot; is a particular type of blood-stew (depending on region) made using pig intestines, pork meat and sometimes ears and cheeks usually with a vinegar base, and green chilli peppers. Pig&#x27;s blood is also the main ingredient of &quot;pinuneg&quot;, a blood sausage made in the Cordilleras. &quot;Bopis&quot; (bópiz in Spanish) is a spicy Filipino dish made out of pork lungs and heart sautéed in tomatoes, chilies and onions. Pieces of pigs&#x27; lungs (&quot;baga&quot;) along with the tendons (&quot;litid&quot;) are also skewered and deep-fried and are served as street food in Metro Manila. Another treat is &quot;chicharong bulaklak&quot; which is made by frying a pig&#x27;s bowel mesentery until crispy.

&quot;Isaw&quot; is a street food popular in the Philippines made with pig and chicken intestine pieces which are skewered, barbecued, and dipped in vinegar before eating. Other street food that are prepared in a similar way are pig ears, skin, liver and coagulated blood cut into cubes, and chicken heads, necks, feet, and gizzards. On the other hand, chicken gizzard and liver are also cooked together &quot;adobo&quot; style and are served as a viand eaten with rice.

The original stew was made from goat offal or goat tripe, however, offal from cattle or carabao are also used. &quot;Papaitan&quot; means &quot;bitterness&quot;, from the taste of the bile. In the province of Cagayan, a version of the dish without the bile is called &quot;menudencia&quot;. The dish &quot;kare-kare&quot; is made with beef tripe and tail stewed in peanut sauce. Beef tripe is also a main ingredient in a rice porridge dish called &quot;goto&quot;. Although, goto in the province of Batangas refers to a soup dish with the same tripe ingredient, instead of rice porridge. Beef tongue, on the other hand, is stewed in a creamy dish called &quot;lengua&quot; (Spanish for &quot;tongue&quot;). Beef liver, as well as pig liver, are also main ingredients in meat stews such as &quot;menudo&quot;, and the &quot;Ilocano&quot; &quot;igado&quot; (from &quot;hígado&quot; or Spanish for &quot;liver&quot;).

===Thailand===

In Thai cuisine, offal is used in many dishes. The well-known &quot;lap&quot; made with minced pork, which often features on menus in the West, will in Thailand often also contain some liver or intestines. Deep-fried intestines, known as &quot;sai mu thot&quot;, are eaten with a spicy dipping sauce. Other dishes containing offal are the Thai-Chinese soup called &quot;kuaichap&quot; (intestines, liver) and the northern Thai &quot;aep ong-o&quot; (pig brains). &quot;Tai pla&quot; is a salty sauce of southern Thai cuisine made from the fermented innards of the short-bodied mackerel. It is used in dishes such as &quot;kaeng tai pla&quot; and &quot;nam phrik tai pla&quot;.

===Vietnam===

==South Asia==
===India and Pakistan===
In India and Pakistan, the goat&#x27;s brain (&quot;maghaz&quot;), feet (&quot;paey&quot;), head (&quot;siri&quot;), stomach (&quot;ojhari&quot; or &quot;but&quot;), tongue (&quot;zabaan&quot;), liver (&quot;kaleji&quot;), kidney (&quot;gurda&quot;), udder (&quot;kheeri&quot;) and testicles (&quot;kapooray&quot;) as well as chickens&#x27; heart and liver are staple. &quot;Kata-Kat&quot;, a popular dish, is a combination of spices, brains, liver, kidneys, and other organs.

Barbecued chicken tail (&quot;dumchi&quot;) can be found on the menu of many street food sellers in Lahore, Pakistan.

==== South India ====
In Hyderabad, lamb and goat brain sautéed and stir-fried with spices (often called &quot;bheja fry&quot;) is a delicacy and often conflated with the city. In the city of Mangalore, a spicy dish called &quot;raghti&quot;, made of heavily spiced porcine offal and cartilaginous tissue, is considered a homely indulgence by the local Christian community.

In Tamilnadu, goat spleen is called &quot;suvarotti&quot;. Suvarotti is also known as &#x27;manneeral&#x27;, even though some say that both are little different. Suvarotti means it sticks to the wall. It is believed because of this nature, the nutrients from the suvarotti sticks to our body.

Goat spleen/Suvarotti/Manneral is cleaned and in a whole piece. Goat spleen is highly rich in Iron, it drastically increases haemoglobin levels in blood and kicks out anemia. Goat spleen has both iron and vitamin C and so the iron in it is easily absorbed by the body. 

==== West India ====
&quot;Sorpatel&quot; is a popular pork gravy consumed by Christians in Goa and Mumbai. The name comes from the word &quot;sarapatel&quot; meaning ‘confusion’ as the thick gravy is heady with spice, vinegar, and contains the heart, liver, ears, tongue and sometimes the blood of a pig. Less commonly, pig tails, noses and lungs are also added.

Among Goan Christians, roasted beef tongue is also a staple at any meal laid out for a party.

Buffalo leaf tripe stuffed with bone marrow (), stuffed goat lung () and fried variety meats () are delicacies in the Kathmandu Valley.

==Middle East==
Jerusalem mixed grill () is a popular dish and local specialty originating in the Mahane Yehuda Market that consists of chicken hearts, spleens, and liver mixed with bits of lamb cooked on a flat grill, seasoned with onion, garlic, black pepper, cumin, turmeric, and coriander.

In Syria, lamb brain is used in &quot;nikhaat&quot; dishes and sometimes as a sandwich filling. A tradition practised less often today would be to eat fish eyes either raw, boiled, or fried. Another popular dish in the region surrounding is , which is rice-stuffed sheep intestine. Raw mutton liver known as &quot;qasbeh nayyeh&quot; (sometimes lungs) is also occasionally consumed (when the animal&#x27;s origin and processing is trusted). The &quot;meelaq&quot; is a traditional dish based on liver, kidney and (sometimes) the heart (which is strictly speaking muscle).

In Iran, tongue (&quot;zabaan&quot;), feet (&quot;paa&quot;) or Kaleh Pacheh, sheep liver (&quot;jigar&quot;), heart (&quot;del&quot;), lungs (&quot;shosh&quot;), testicles (&quot;donbalan&quot;) and kidneys are used as certain types of &quot;kebab&quot; and have a high popularity among people, as well as sheep intestines and stomach, though the latter is boiled. Sheep skull and tongue, alongside knee joints, as a formal breakfast dish called &quot;kale pache&quot; (lit. &quot;head and leg&quot;), are boiled in water with beans and eaten with traditional bread.

&quot;Pacha&quot; (Persian term), is a traditional Iraqi dish made from sheep&#x27;s head, trotters, and stomach; all boiled slowly and served with bread sunken in the broth. The cheeks and tongues are considered the best parts. Many people prefer not to eat the eyeballs, which could be removed before cooking. The stomach lining would be filled with rice and lamb and stitched with a sewing thread ().

The dish is known in Kuwait, Bahrain, and other Persian Gulf countries as &quot;Pacha&quot; (پاچة), too. A variation of that is found in other Arab countries, such as in Egypt, and is known as &quot;Kawari&quot;&#x27; (). It is still eaten by Iraqi Jews.

In Egypt, fried beef and lamb liver () with a cumin-based coating is a popular dish, most often served in sandwiches with a bit of onion from small shops in most major cities. Thin-sliced fried liver with slices of mild peppers, garlic, and lemon is considered a speciality of Alexandria (as &quot; Kibda Skandarani&quot;, &quot;Alexandrian liver&quot;), and is often served as a separate plate, sandwich, or topping for kushari.

Cow brain is eaten in Egypt, as are sheep brains.

Sheep brain is eaten in Iraq. It is also eaten in Iran, where it is known as Kaleh Pacheh.

===Turkic cuisine===
In Turkey, Azerbaijan, Iranian Azerbaijan and some other Turkic cuisines, there are varieties of offal dishes, especially those of sheep. For &quot;Jağur Bağur&quot;, sheep liver and heart are diced and soaked with onion for some hours and then fried with other additives. For &quot;Bağırsak Kebab&quot;, sheep intestine is wrapped and baked in a stove or by skewers on a barbeque.

==North America==
===United States===

Although the term &quot;offal&quot; is used in the United Kingdom and Canada, in the United States the terms &quot;variety meats&quot; or &quot;organ meats&quot; are used instead. In the United States, some regional cuisines make extensive use of certain organs of specific animals. The derisive term &quot;mystery meat&quot; is often used to describe offal which have been ground or otherwise heavily processed in order to obscure its origin.

In the United States, the giblets of chickens, turkeys, and ducks are much more commonly consumed than the mammal offal. Traditional recipes for turkey gravy and stuffing typically include the bird&#x27;s giblets (the traditional Thanksgiving meal in the US). Use of organs of mammals is not common, except for the liver, which is common to a certain degree. Examples include liver sausage (braunschweiger) and pâté. Liver and onions is a traditional, &quot;classic&quot; menu item in diners throughout the country, often as a &quot;blue plate special&quot;.

Mammal offal is somewhat more popular in certain areas. In the American South, some recipes include chitterlings, livers, brain, and hog maw. Scrapple, sometimes made from pork offal, is somewhat common in the Mid-Atlantic region, particularly in Philadelphia and areas with Amish communities. Pepper Pot soup (frequently served in Philadelphia) is made from beef tripe. Fried-brain sandwiches are a speciality in the Ohio River Valley. Rocky Mountain oysters, &quot;prairie oysters&quot;, or &quot;turkey fries&quot; (beef testicles) are a delicacy eaten in some cattle-raising parts of the western US and Canada. In South Carolina, pork liver and other organ meats are often cooked into &quot;hash&quot;, a kind of stew.

Offal dishes from many other cultures exist but the appeal is usually limited to the immigrant communities that introduced the dish. For example, chopped liver, lungen stew, and beef tongue (especially as used by Kosher delis) in American Jewish culture, or &quot;menudo&quot; in Mexican-American culture.

Ironically, given its provenance and history, offal has started to be reintroduced as an item of haute cuisine, with stylish restaurants offering roasted bone marrow, fried pork rind, tongue or heart as part of their menus.

African-American slaves were often given throw-away parts of meat during slavery. Black slaves would consume chitterlings during the winter. Undesirable parts of an animal such as neck bones, hog maws, pig ears and pig feet, were given to the African American slaves to eat.

===Mexico===

In some Latin American countries, such as Mexico, almost all internal parts and organs are consumed regularly. Chicken hearts, gizzards and livers are usually eaten fried or boiled, either alone, or in broth.

Several types of offal are commonly used in tacos, including:
* &quot;tacos de lengua&quot;: boiled beef tongue
* &quot;tacos de sesos&quot;: beef brain
* &quot;tacos de cabeza&quot;: every part of the cow&#x27;s head, including lips, cheeks, eyes, etc.
* &quot;tacos de ojo&quot;: cow&#x27;s eyes
* &quot;tacos de chicharrón&quot;: fried pork rinds (chicharrón), a common snack food item
* &quot;tacos de tripas&quot;: beef tripe (tripas)

In many of the regional cuisines of Mexico there are dishes made of offal. Menudo is a typical dish made of tripe that is native of the border region with the United States. While Menudo is cooked with hominy, in Central Mexico the tripe does not have hominy. This dish is called &quot;pancita&quot;. Cow offal such as kidneys and liver are popular in the entire country, in dishes such as &quot;higado encebollado&quot; or &quot;riñones a la Mexicana&quot;. The bone marrow from the cow forms the basis of various soups such as the typical dish of Mexico City, such as &quot;sopa de medula&quot;. The northern region is cattle country and is famous for its tacos de &quot;tripa de leche&quot;, made of cow intestines and the south consumes pig intestines (&quot;tripita&quot;). The whole pig, from snout to tail including genitals (such as the boiled, then fried penis are named &quot;machitos&quot;). Head cheese is common. The skin can be fried (&quot;cueritos&quot;) or pickled (&quot;cueritos en vinagre&quot;) and are found in stores and restaurants all over Mexico. Pig brains (&quot;sesos&quot;), cheeks and eyes and other parts are eaten throughout the country with many variations. These parts have curious names such as &quot;nana&quot;, &quot;bofe&quot;, &quot;pajarilla&quot; &quot;nenepil&quot;. Pig throat tacos [&quot;buche&quot;] are very popular in the border region. Fried lamb offal, is popular in Central Mexico, especially the stomach (&quot;panza&quot;), which is somewhat similar to haggis. Mexico City has taquerias that offer the whole pig in their menu. Chicken innards are ubiquitous in Mexico such as sweetbreads (&quot;sopa de molleja&quot; or innards (&quot;sopa de dentros de pollo&quot;).

===Caribbean Islands===
Sheep&#x27;s or goat&#x27;s head are eaten as part of the barbacoa, a dish originating with the Taino people. Cow cod soup is a traditional Jamaican dish made with bull penis. Morcilla (blood sausage), Chicharrón (fried pork rinds), and other pork offal are commonly served in a Puerto Rican Cuchifrito. Sopa de mondongo, made with tripe, is common in the Caribbean and throughout Latin America. Gandinga is a hearty stew, well known in Cuba and Puerto Rico, prepared from the heart, liver, kidneys, and oesophagal tissue of either pork (&quot;gandinga de cerdo&quot;) or beef (&quot;gandinga de res&quot;).

==Australia==

In Australia offal is used in a few dishes inherited from British cuisine; liver may be used in liver and onions, and kidney in steak and kidney pie, as well as in some recipes for rissoles. Lamb brains are occasionally crumbed and fried. Other forms of offal are consumed in some ethnic dishes.
Australian food standards require that products containing offal be labelled as such. The presence of brain, heart, kidney, liver, tongue or tripe must be declared either by specific type or more generally as offal. Other offal, such as blood, pancreas, spleen and thymus must be declared by name.

==Health and food safety issues==
The offal of certain animals is unsafe to consume:
* The internal organs of the fugu pufferfish are highly toxic—in Japan, fugu can only be prepared by trained master chefs, working under extremely strict regulations, sanitary conditions, and licensing. Even a residual portion of fugu toxin can be fatal.
* The liver of the polar bear is unsafe to eat because it is very high in vitamin A and can cause hypervitaminosis A, a dangerous disorder. This has been recognized since at least 1597 when Gerrit de Veer wrote in his diary that, while taking refuge in the winter in Novaya Zemlya, he and his men became gravely ill after eating polar-bear liver. Seal liver is similarly toxic, as is dog liver.
* Some animal intestines are very high in coliform bacteria and need to be washed and cooked thoroughly to be safe for eating.
* Nervous system tissue can be contaminated with TSE prions, which cause bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, &quot;mad cow disease&quot;); in some jurisdictions these offal are classified as specified risk materials and are subject to special regulations.
* Offal very high in purines can precipitate an acute attack of gout in someone with the condition.
* Certain types of offal, including kidneys, stomach, intestines, heart, tongue, and liver, can be very high in saturated fats.
* The practice of feeding raw offal to dogs on farms and ranches can spread echinococcosis, a potentially fatal parasitic disease of animals, including humans.
* The United Kingdom banned the sale of animal brains in order to curtail the spread of mad cow disease in the 1980s and 90s.
* A similar ban is imposed by the Food and Drug Administration on animal lungs in the United States due to concerns such as fungal spores or cross-contamination with other organs, although these concerns have been criticized as unfounded.

<doc id="342510" wikidata="Q11037120" url="?curid=342510" title="Middle Pomerania">
<text>The term Middle or Central [[Pomerania]] can refer to two distinct areas, depending on whether it is used as a translation of the corresponding German or Polish terms Mittelpommern (also Mittelpommerscher Keil) or Pomorze Środkowe, respectively.

==Mittelpommern==
Mittelpommern in historical usage denotes the central parts of the former Duchy, later Province of Pomerania, located approximately between the rivers Peene and Rega, including the towns Trzebiatów, Resko and Nowogard.

=== Mittelpommerscher Keil ===
Mittelpommerscher Keil (Middle Pomeranian Wedge) is a term used in ethnolinguistics, which carries a narrower meaning; it corresponds to the south-central part of Mittelpommern, roughly between the rivers Zarow and Ihna (Ina). This area differed from the rest of the duchy or province by the dialect of the inhabitants, who spoke the Mittelpommersch variety closely related to Märkisch-Brandenburgisch, as well as in the town law of the cities, which was Magdeburg Law (vs Lübeck Law in the other parts). Since World War II the Oder-Neisse line divides this area, reducing the German part to the former Uecker-Randow district, as well as to the Amt Gartz (Oder) in the Uckermark district. 
==Pomorze Środkowe==
Pomorze Środkowe in modern usage are terms coined in Poland for the area of the former Koszalin Voivodeship (1950-1975), spanning roughly from the area east of the river Rega (&quot;Rega&quot;) to the river Łeba, which was split in 1975 with the remains since 1999 merged into the West Pomeranian, Pomeranian and Greater Poland voivodeships. In 2003, a movement presented to the Polish Sejm parliament a petition for the recreation of the Koszalin voivodeship as the Central Pomeranian Voivodeship, signed by 135,000 people.

<text>Heike Makatsch (; born 13 August 1971) is a German actress. She is known for her roles as Lisa Addison in &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (2002), Mia in &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003), as Liesel&#x27;s mother in &quot;The Book Thief&quot; (2013), and as Carlotta Klatt in &quot;Where&#x27;s Wanda?&quot; (2024).

==Early life==
Makatsch was born in Düsseldorf, West Germany, the daughter of former German national ice hockey team goaltender Rainer Makatsch.

In 1997, she started hosting her own weekly, late night show titled &quot;Heike Makatsch Show&quot;. However, due to bad ratings, it was canceled after only eight episodes.

Makatsch first appeared in a film in 1996 when she starred in Detlev Buck&#x27;s &quot;Männerpension&quot; (English: &quot;Jailbirds&quot;). She received the Bavarian Film Award as the most talented young actor for her performance.

She is perhaps best known for her role as Lisa Addison, Matt&#x27;s sister in the video game-based sci-fi/horror film &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (2002).

She voiced Terk in the German dub of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Tarzan&quot;.

Since 2012, Makatsch has been a face for French cosmetics company L&#x27;Oréal.

Makatsch served on the jury of the Goldene Kamera awards in 2017.

==Personal life==
Makatsch was in a seven-year relationship with British actor Daniel Craig, ending in 2004.

She has three daughters, born in 2007, 2009, and 2015; the first two are with musician Max Martin Schröder, from the German indie band Tomte. She has been in a relationship with actor Trystan Pütter since 2017.

<doc id="342518" wikidata="Q3106001" url="?curid=342518" title="Gilgamesh the King">
<text>Gilgamesh the King is a 1984 historical novel by American writer Robert Silverberg, presenting the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; as a novel. In the afterword the author wrote &quot;at all times I have attempted to interpret the fanciful and fantastic events of these poems in a realistic way, that is, to tell the story of Gilgamesh as though he were writing his own memoirs, and to that end I have introduced many interpretations of my own devising which for better or for worse are in no way to be ascribed to the scholars&quot;.

== Plot introduction ==
The novel is told from the point of view of Gilgamesh, and is primarily ambivalent about the supernatural elements of the epic. But the events are portrayed in a fairly realistic manner.
Gilgamesh is a giant among men and an amazing warrior, even since he was very young. When the king of Uruk (his father) dies, Gilgamesh is exiled by the recently crowned Dumuzi, jealous of his skills and power. When in time Dumuzi dies, Gilgamesh comes back to the kingdom to be proclaimed.

Silverberg afterwards wrote a number of stories for the fantasy anthology series &quot;Heroes in Hell&quot; describing Gilgamesh&#x27;s posthumous adventures in the underworld, including the award-winning novella &quot;Gilgamesh in the Outback&quot;.

==Reception==
Neil Gaiman reviewed &quot;Gilgamesh the King&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;A fascinating look at a long-gone culture, with a magnificent Jim Burns cover.&quot;

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Gilgamesh the King&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #69, and stated that &quot;Silverberg&#x27;s version is laudable, essential reading [...] but his realistic approach weakens (I think) the theme of immortality. Compare his amazing fantasy &quot;The Book of Skulls&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="342520" wikidata="Q5042317" url="?curid=342520" title="Fuel efficiency">
<text>Fuel efficiency (or fuel economy) is a form of thermal efficiency, meaning the ratio of effort to result of a process that converts chemical potential energy contained in a carrier (fuel) into kinetic energy or work. Overall fuel efficiency may vary per device, which in turn may vary per application, and this spectrum of variance is often illustrated as a continuous energy profile. Non-transportation applications, such as industry, benefit from increased fuel efficiency, especially fossil fuel power plants or industries dealing with combustion, such as ammonia production during the Haber process.

In the context of transport, fuel economy is the energy efficiency of a particular vehicle, given as a ratio of distance traveled per unit of fuel consumed. It is dependent on several factors including engine efficiency, transmission design, and tire design. In most countries, using the metric system, fuel economy is stated as &quot;fuel consumption&quot; in liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km) or kilometers per liter (km/L or kmpl). In a number of countries still using other systems, fuel economy is expressed in miles per gallon (mpg), for example in the US and usually also in the UK (imperial gallon); there is sometimes confusion as the imperial gallon is 20% larger than the US gallon so that mpg values are not directly comparable. Traditionally, litres per mil were used in Norway and Sweden, but both have aligned to the EU standard of L/100 km. 

Fuel consumption is a more accurate measure of a vehicle&#x27;s performance because it is a linear relationship while fuel economy leads to distortions in efficiency improvements. Weight-specific efficiency (efficiency per unit weight) may be stated for freight, and passenger-specific efficiency (vehicle efficiency per passenger) for passenger vehicles.

==Vehicle design==
Fuel efficiency is dependent on many parameters of a vehicle, including its engine parameters, aerodynamic drag, weight, AC usage, fuel and rolling resistance. There have been advances in all areas of vehicle design in recent decades. Fuel efficiency of vehicles can also be improved by careful maintenance and driving habits.

Hybrid vehicles use two or more power sources for propulsion. In many designs, a small combustion engine is combined with electric motors. Kinetic energy which would otherwise be lost to heat during braking is recaptured as electrical power to improve fuel efficiency. The larger batteries in these vehicles power the car&#x27;s electronics, allowing the engine to shut off and avoid prolonged idling.

==Fleet efficiency==

Fleet efficiency describes the average efficiency of a population of vehicles. Technological advances in efficiency may be offset by a change in buying habits with a propensity to heavier vehicles that are less fuel-efficient.

==Energy efficiency terminology==
Energy efficiency is similar to fuel efficiency but the input is usually in units of energy such as megajoules (MJ), kilowatt-hours (kW·h), kilocalories (kcal) or British thermal units (BTU). The inverse of &quot;energy efficiency&quot; is &quot;energy intensity&quot;, or the amount of input energy required for a unit of output such as MJ/passenger-km (of passenger transport), BTU/ton-mile or kJ/t-km (of freight transport), GJ/t (for production of steel and other materials), BTU/(kW·h) (for electricity generation), or litres/100 km (of vehicle travel). Litres per 100 km is also a measure of &quot;energy intensity&quot; where the input is measured by the amount of fuel and the output is measured by the distance travelled. For example: Fuel economy in automobiles.

Given a heat value of a fuel, it would be trivial to convert from fuel units (such as litres of gasoline) to energy units (such as MJ) and conversely. But there are two problems with comparisons made using energy units:
* There are two different heat values for any hydrogen-containing fuel which can differ by several percent (see below).
* When comparing transportation energy costs, a kilowatt hour of electric energy may require an amount of fuel with heating value of 2 or 3 kilowatt hours to produce it.

==Energy content of fuel==

The specific energy content of a fuel is the heat energy obtained when a certain quantity is burned (such as a gallon, litre, kilogram). It is sometimes called the heat of combustion. There exists two different values of specific heat energy for the same batch of fuel. One is the high (or gross) heat of combustion and the other is the low (or net) heat of combustion. The high value is obtained when, after the combustion, the water in the exhaust is in liquid form. For the low value, the exhaust has all the water in vapor form (steam). Since water vapor gives up heat energy when it changes from vapor to liquid, the liquid water value is larger since it includes the latent heat of vaporization of water. The difference between the high and low values is significant, about 8 or 9%. This accounts for most of the apparent discrepancy in the heat value of gasoline. In the U.S. (and the table) the high heat values have traditionally been used, but in many other countries, the low heat values are commonly used.


Neither the gross heat of combustion nor the net heat of combustion gives the theoretical amount of mechanical energy (work) that can be obtained from the reaction. (This is given by the change in Gibbs free energy, and is around 45.7 MJ/kg for gasoline.) The actual amount of mechanical work obtained from fuel (the inverse of the specific fuel consumption) depends on the engine. A figure of 17.6 MJ/kg is possible with a gasoline engine, and 19.1 MJ/kg for a diesel engine. See Brake-specific fuel consumption for more information.

== Transportation ==
=== Fuel efficiency of motor vehicles ===
===Driving technique===
==Advanced technology==
The most efficient machines for converting energy to rotary motion are electric motors, as used in electric vehicles. However, electricity is not a primary energy source so the efficiency of the electricity production has also to be taken into account. Railway trains can be powered using electricity, delivered through an additional running rail, overhead catenary system or by on-board generators used in diesel-electric locomotives as common on the US and UK rail networks. Pollution produced from centralised generation of electricity is emitted at a distant power station, rather than &quot;on site&quot;. Pollution can be reduced by using more railway electrification and low carbon power for electricity. Some railways, such as the French SNCF and Swiss federal railways derive most, if not 100% of their power, from hydroelectric or nuclear power stations, therefore atmospheric pollution from their rail networks is very low. This was reflected in a study by AEA Technology between a Eurostar train and airline journeys between London and Paris, which showed the trains on average emitting 10 times less CO2, per passenger, than planes, helped in part by French nuclear generation.

=== Hydrogen fuel cells ===
In the future, hydrogen cars may be commercially available. Toyota is test-marketing vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells in southern California, where a series of hydrogen fueling stations has been established. Powered either through chemical reactions in a fuel cell that create electricity to drive very efficient electrical motors or by directly burning hydrogen in a combustion engine (near identically to a natural gas vehicle, and similarly compatible with both natural gas and gasoline); these vehicles promise to have near-zero pollution from the tailpipe (exhaust pipe). Potentially the atmospheric pollution could be minimal, provided the hydrogen is made by electrolysis using electricity from non-polluting sources such as solar, wind or hydroelectricity or nuclear. Commercial hydrogen production uses fossil fuels and produces more carbon dioxide than hydrogen.

Because there are pollutants involved in the manufacture and destruction of a car and the production, transmission and storage of electricity and hydrogen, the label &quot;zero pollution&quot; applies only to the car&#x27;s conversion of stored energy into movement.

In 2004, a consortium of major auto-makers — BMW, General Motors, Honda, Toyota and Volkswagen/Audi — came up with &quot;Top Tier Detergent Gasoline Standard&quot; to gasoline brands in the US and Canada that meet their minimum standards for detergent content and do not contain metallic additives. Top Tier gasoline contains higher levels of detergent additives in order to prevent the build-up of deposits (typically, on fuel injector and intake valve) known to reduce fuel economy and engine performance.

===In microgravity===
How fuel combusts affects how much energy is produced. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has investigated fuel consumption in microgravity.

The common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on convection, because soot tends to rise to the top of a flame, such as in a candle, making the flame yellow. In microgravity or zero gravity, such as an environment in outer space, convection no longer occurs, and the flame becomes spherical, with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient. There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely one given is the hypothesis that the temperature is evenly distributed enough that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs., National Aeronautics and Space Administration, April 2005. Experiments by NASA in microgravity reveal that diffusion flames in microgravity allow more soot to be completely oxidised after they are produced than diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behaved differently in microgravity when compared to normal gravity conditions.LSP-1 experiment results, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, April 2005. Premixed flames in microgravity burn at a much slower rate and more efficiently than even a candle on Earth, and last much longer.

<text>Frederic Anthony Rzewski ( ; April 13, 1938 – June 26, 2021) was an American composer and pianist, considered to be one of the most important American composer-pianists of his time. From 1977 up to his eventual death, he lived mainly in Belgium. His major compositions, which often incorporate social and political themes, include the minimalist &quot;Coming Together&quot; and the variation set &quot;The People United Will Never Be Defeated!&quot;, which has been called &quot;a modern classic&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Rzewski was born on April 13, 1938, in Westfield, Massachusetts, to parents of Polish and Jewish descent, and raised Catholic. He began playing piano at age 5 and attended Phillips Academy, Harvard, and Princeton, where his teachers included Randall Thompson, Roger Sessions, Walter Piston, and Milton Babbitt. In 1960, he went to Italy on a Fulbright grant, a trip which was formative in his future musical development. In addition to studying with Luigi Dallapiccola in Florence on a Fulbright scholarship he began a career as a performer of new piano music, often with an improvisatory element.

== Career ==
In 1966, Rzewski co-founded Musica Elettronica Viva with Alvin Curran and Richard Teitelbaum in Rome. Musica Elettronica Viva conceived music as a collective, collaborative process, with improvisation and live electronic instruments prominently featured. In 1971, he returned to New York from Italy.

In 1977, Rzewski became Professor of Composition at the Conservatoire Royal de Musique in Liège, Belgium, then directed by Henri Pousseur. Occasionally, he taught for short periods at schools and universities throughout the U.S. and Europe, including Yale University, the University of Cincinnati, the California Institute of the Arts, the University of California, San Diego, the Royal Conservatory of The Hague, and Trinity College of Music, London.

Many of Rzewski&#x27;s works were inspired by secular and socio-historical themes, show a deep political conscience and feature improvisational elements. His better-known works include &quot;The People United Will Never Be Defeated!&quot; (36 variations on the Sergio Ortega song &quot;El pueblo unido jamás será vencido&quot;); &quot;Coming Together&quot;, a setting of letters from Sam Melville, an inmate at Attica State Prison, at the time of the riots there (1972); &quot;North American Ballads&quot; (I. &quot;Dreadful Memories&quot;; II. &quot;Which Side Are You On?&quot;; III. &quot;Down by the Riverside&quot;; IV. &quot;Winnsboro Cotton Mill Blues&quot;) (1978–79); &quot;Night Crossing with Fisherman&quot;; &quot;Fougues&quot;; &quot;Fantasia&quot; and &quot;Sonata&quot;; &quot;The Price of Oil&quot;, and &quot;Le Silence des Espaces Infinis&quot;, both of which use graphical notation; &quot;Les Moutons de Panurge&quot;; and the &quot;Antigone-Legend&quot;. Rzewski&#x27;s later compositions include &quot;Nanosonatas&quot; (2006–2010) and &quot;Cadenza con o senza Beethoven&quot; (2003), written for Beethoven&#x27;s Fourth Piano Concerto. Rzewski played the solo part in the world premiere of his piano concerto at the 2013 BBC Proms.

== Personal life and death ==
In 1963, Rzewski married Nicole Abbeloos; they had five children. While Rzewski never divorced Abbeloos, his companion for about the last 20 years of his life was Françoise Walot, with whom he had two children. He also had five grandchildren. Rzewski died of an apparent heart attack in Montiano, Tuscany, Italy, on June 26, 2021, at the age of 83.

== Appraisal ==
Nicolas Slonimsky said of Rzewski in 1993: &quot;He is furthermore a granitically overpowering piano technician, capable of depositing huge boulders of sonoristic material across the keyboard without actually wrecking the instrument.&quot; Michael Schell called Rzewski &quot;the most important living composer of piano music, and surely one of the dozen or so most important living American composers&quot;.

In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau reviewed &quot;Coming Together/Attica/Moutons de Panurge&quot;, an album recorded with vocals by performance artist Steve Ben Israel and released in 1973 by Opus One Records. &quot;The design of &#x27;Coming Together&#x27; is simple, even minimal&quot;, Christgau said. &quot;Steve ben Israel reads and rereads one of Sam Melville&#x27;s letters from Attica over a jazzy, repetitious vamp. Yet the result is political art as expressive and accessible as &quot;Guernica&quot;. In ben Israel&#x27;s interpretation, Melville&#x27;s prison years have made him both visionary and mad, and the torment of his incarceration is rendered more vivid by the nagging intensity of the music. The [LP&#x27;s] other side features a less inspiring political piece and a percussion composition, each likable but not compelling, but that&#x27;s a cavil. &#x27;Coming Together&#x27; is amazing.&quot;

<text>Roma Eterna is a science fiction fixup novel by American writer Robert Silverberg, published in 2003, which presents an alternative history in which the Roman Empire survives to the present day. Each of the ten chapters was first published as a short story, six of them in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot;, between 1989 and 2003.

==Plot introduction==
The point of divergence is the failure of the Israelite Exodus from Egypt. Moses and many of the Israelites drowned, and the remnant, led by Aaron, were fetched back to slavery in Egypt, a traumatic event recorded for posterity in the &quot;Book of Aaron&quot;, an alternate version of the Bible. Later, the Hebrews were freed from bondage and remained a distinct religious-ethnic minority in Egypt, practicing a monotheistic religion, up to the equivalent of our 20th century (the 27th century of the Roman calendar).

Still, affairs of the larger world and the rise and fall of empires and cultures remained roughly the same as in our history until the division of the Roman Empire, which was never Christianised in this history. Mutual assistance between the Western and the Eastern Roman Empire against barbarian invasions preserved both from falling and kept Roman rule intact throughout the imperial dominions.

Despite the absence of Christianity, which, in our history, considerably influenced early Islam, Muhammad still started his prophetic career but was assassinated by a perceptive Roman agent, nipping Islam in the bud and thus precluding the spread of any monotheistic religion through the Roman Empire. Monotheism remained limited to the specific Hebrew sect in Egypt.

==Plot summary==
The novel is presented as a series of vignettes over a period of about 1500 years, from to . Most of the story-chapters involve Roman politics, either the competition between the Western and Eastern Empires to dominate the other or the violent creation of the Second Roman Republic in about . Others describe the first Roman circumnavigation of the world and unsuccessful attempts to conquer Nova Roma (Central America).

Many features of our own history are repeated in this history, though under changed circumstances: the equivalent of the 16th and 17th centuries have bold navigators and adventurers, romanticised by later generations but unpleasantly brutal and ruthless when looked at closely; in the late 18th to mid-19th centuries, a decadent old order is overthrown by revolution followed by a reign of terror and the reemergence of Republicanism; though Italy remains a central part of the Roman Empire, the Latin dialect spoken there develops into a kind of Italian, and the name &quot;Marcus&quot; changes into &quot;Marco&quot;; though Vienna is a provincial capital which never had an Emperor of its own, its population dances the Waltz; by the 20th century, people travel by cars rather than carriages and by the second half of the century, space flight is achieved.

It concludes with the first story to be written, when a group of Hebrew citizens in Alexandria prepare to depart Earth in a rocket which explodes shortly after takeoff. But they will try again, still believing God chose them to inherit the Promised Land, just not on Rome-dominated Earth.

==Chapters==
The book consists of a prologue and ten chapters &quot;(Gregorian calendar year)&quot;:
* AUC 1203: Prologue &quot;(AD 450)&quot;
* AUC 1282: With Caesar in the Underworld &quot;(529)&quot;
* AUC 1365: A Hero of the Empire &quot;(612)&quot;
* AUC 1861: The Second Wave &quot;(1108)&quot;
* AUC 1951: Waiting for the End &quot;(1198)&quot;
* AUC 2206: An Outpost of the Realm &quot;(1453)&quot;
* AUC 2543: Getting to know the Dragon &quot;(1790)&quot;
* AUC 2568: The Reign of Terror &quot;(1815)&quot;
* AUC 2603: Via Roma &quot;(1850)&quot;
* AUC 2650: Tales from the Venia Woods &quot;(1897)&quot;
* AUC 2723: To the Promised Land &quot;(1970)&quot;

==Literary significance and reception==
The book received a share of negative criticism. It was accused of concentrating too much on the upper class and not drawing a detailed picture of Roman life and its change through the ages. The only story in the book to receive true praise from reviewer Alma A. Hromic is the last chapter, &quot;To the Promised Land&quot;, which incidentally, does not deal with Romans or the upper class of the Empire.

Five of the stories in the series, &quot;Waiting for the End,&quot; &quot;Getting to Know the Dragon,&quot; &quot;A Hero of the Empire,&quot; &quot;With Caesar in the Underworld,&quot; and &quot;The Reign of Terror&quot; were nominated for the Sidewise Award for Alternate History upon their original publications, although none of the stories won.

<text>Georges Charpak (; born Jerzy Charpak; 1 August 1924 – 29 September 2010) was a Polish-born French physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1992 for his invention of the multiwire proportional chamber.

==Life==
Georges Charpak was born on 1 August 1924 as Jerzy Charpak to Jewish parents, Anna (Szapiro) and Maurice Charpak, in the village of Dąbrowica in Poland (now Dubrovytsia in Ukraine). Charpak&#x27;s family moved from Poland to Paris when he was seven years old, beginning his study of mathematics in 1941 at the Lycée Saint-Louis. The actor and film director André Charpak was his younger brother.

During World War II Charpak served in the resistance and was imprisoned by Vichy authorities in 1943. In 1944 he was deported to the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau, where he remained until the camp was liberated in 1945.

After &quot;classes préparatoires&quot; studies at Lycée Saint-Louis in Paris and later at Lycée Joffre in Montpellier, he joined in 1945 the Paris-based École des Mines, one of the most prestigious engineering schools in France. The following year he became a naturalized French citizen. He graduated in 1948, earning the French degree of &quot;Civil Engineer of Mines&quot; (&quot;Ingénieur Civil des Mines&quot; equivalent to a Master&#x27;s degree) becoming a pupil in the laboratory of Frédéric Joliot-Curie at the Collège de France during 1949, the year after Curie had directed construction of the first &quot;atomic pile&quot; within France. While at the Collège, Charpak secured a research position for the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). He received his PhD in 1954 in nuclear physics at the Collège de France, receiving the qualification after having written a thesis on the subject of very-low-energy radiation due to disintegration of nuclei (Charpak &amp; Suzor).

In 1959, he joined the staff of CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Geneva, where he invented and developed the multiwire proportional chamber. The chamber was patented and that quickly superseded the old bubble chambers, allowing for better data processing. This new creation had been made public during 1968. Charpak was later to become a joint inventor with Nlolc and Policarpo of the scintillation drift chamber during the latter parts of the 1970s. He eventually retired from CERN in 1991. In 1980, Georges Charpak became professor-in-residence at École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles in Paris (ESPCI) and held the Joliot-Curie Chair there in 1984. This is where he developed and demonstrated the powerful applications of the particle detectors he invented, most notably for enabling better health diagnostics. 
He was the co-founder of a number of start-up in the biolab arena, including Molecular Engines Laboratories, Biospace Instruments and SuperSonic Imagine – together with Mathias Fink. He was elected to the French Academy of Sciences on 20 May 1985.

Georges Charpak was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1992 &quot;for his invention and development of particle detectors, in particular the multiwire proportional chamber&quot;, with affiliations to both École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles (ESPCI) and CERN. This was the last time a single person was awarded the Physics prize, as of 2025. In 1999, Charpak received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In France, Charpak was a very strong advocate for nuclear power. Charpak was a member of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

Charpak married Dominique Vidal in 1953. They had three children. The pediatrician Nathalie Charpak (born 1955) is his daughter.

Charpak died on 29 September 2010, in Paris, at the age of 86.

<text>A villa is a type of house that was originally an ancient Roman upper class country house that originally provided an escape from urban life. Since its origins in the Roman villa, the idea and function of a villa have evolved considerably. After the fall of the Roman Republic, villas became small farming compounds, which were increasingly fortified in Late Antiquity, sometimes transferred to the Church for reuse as a monastery. Then they gradually re-evolved through the Middle Ages into elegant upper-class country homes. In the early modern period, any comfortable detached house with a garden near a city or town was likely to be described as a villa; most survivals have now been engulfed by suburbia. In modern parlance, &quot;villa&quot; can refer to various types and sizes of residences, ranging from the suburban semi-detached double villa to, in some countries, especially around the Mediterranean, residences of above average size in the countryside.

==Roman==
Roman villas included:
* the &quot;villa urbana&quot;, a suburban or country seat that could easily be reached from Rome or another city for a night or two. They often featured decorated rooms and porticoes.
* the &quot;villa rustica&quot;, the farm-house estate that was permanently occupied by the servants who had charge generally of the estate, which would centre on the villa itself, perhaps only seasonally occupied. The Roman &quot;villae rusticae&quot; at the heart of &quot;latifundia&quot; were the earliest versions of what later and elsewhere became called manors and plantations. 
* the &quot;otium villa&quot;, for rural retirement or pleasure.

In terms of design, there was often little difference in the main residence between these types at any particular level of size, but the presence or absence of farm outbuildings reflected the size and function of the estate.

Not included as &quot;villae&quot; were the &quot;domus&quot;, city houses for the élite and privileged classes, and the &quot;insulae&quot;, blocks of apartment buildings for the rest of the population. In &quot;Satyricon&quot; (1st century CE), Petronius described the wide range of Roman dwellings. Another type of villae is the &quot;villa maritima&quot;, a seaside villa, located on the coast.
A concentration of Imperial villas existed on the Gulf of Naples, on the Isle of Capri, at Monte Circeo and at Antium. Examples include the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum; and the Villa of the Mysteries and Villa of the Vettii in Pompeii.

There was an important villa maritima in Barcola near Trieste. This villa was located directly on the coast and was divided into terraces in a representation area in which luxury and power was displayed, a separate living area, a garden, some facilities open to the sea and a thermal bath. Not far from this noble place, which was already popular with the Romans because of its favorable microclimate, one of the most important Villa Maritima of its time, the Miramare Castle, was built in the 19th century.

Wealthy Romans also escaped the summer heat in the hills round Rome, especially around Tibur (Tivoli and Frascati), such as at Hadrian&#x27;s Villa. Cicero allegedly possessed no fewer than seven villas, the oldest of which was near Arpinum, which he inherited. Pliny the Younger had three or four, of which the example near Laurentium is the best known from his descriptions.

Roman writers refer with satisfaction to the self-sufficiency of their &quot;latifundium&quot; villas, where they drank their own wine and pressed their own oil. This was an affectation of urban aristocrats playing at being old-fashioned virtuous Roman farmers, it has been said that the economic independence of later rural villas was a symptom of the increasing economic fragmentation of the Roman Empire.

===In Roman Britannia===

Archaeologists have meticulously examined numerous Roman villas in England. Like their Italian counterparts, they were complete working agrarian societies of fields and vineyards, perhaps even tileworks or quarries, ranged round a high-status power centre with its baths and gardens. The grand villa at Woodchester preserved its mosaic floors when the Anglo-Saxon parish church was built (not by chance) upon its site. Grave-diggers preparing for burials in the churchyard as late as the 18th century had to punch through the intact mosaic floors. The even more palatial &quot;villa rustica&quot; at Fishbourne near Winchester was built (uncharacteristically) as a large open rectangle, with porticos enclosing gardens entered through a portico. Towards the end of the 3rd century, Roman towns in Britain ceased to expand: like patricians near the centre of the empire, Roman Britons withdrew from the cities to their villas, which entered on a palatial building phase, a &quot;golden age&quot; of villa life. &quot;Villae rusticae&quot; are essential in the Empire&#x27;s economy.

Two kinds of villa-plan in Roman Britain may be characteristic of Roman villas in general. The more usual plan extended wings of rooms all opening onto a linking portico, which might be extended at right angles, even to enclose a courtyard. The other kind featured an aisled central hall like a basilica, suggesting the villa owner&#x27;s magisterial role. The villa buildings were often independent structures linked by their enclosed courtyards. Timber-framed construction, carefully fitted with mortises and tenons and dowelled together, set on stone footings, were the rule, replaced by stone buildings for the important ceremonial rooms. Traces of window glass have been found, as well as ironwork window grilles. 

===Monastery villas of Late Antiquity===
With the decline and collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the fourth and fifth centuries, the villas were more and more isolated and came to be protected by walls. In England the villas were abandoned, looted, and burned by Anglo-Saxon invaders in the fifth century, but the concept of an isolated, self-sufficient agrarian working community, housed close together, survived into Anglo-Saxon culture as the &quot;vill&quot;, with its inhabitants – if formally bound to the land – as &quot;villeins&quot;.

In regions on the Continent, aristocrats and territorial magnates donated large working villas and overgrown abandoned ones to individual monks; these might become the nuclei of monasteries. In this way, the Italian villa system of late Antiquity survived into the early Medieval period in the form of monasteries that withstood the disruptions of the Gothic War (535–554) and the Lombards. About 529 Benedict of Nursia established his influential monastery of Monte Cassino in the ruins of a villa at Subiaco that had belonged to Nero.

From the sixth to the eighth century, Gallo-Roman villas in the Merovingian royal fisc were repeatedly donated as sites for monasteries under royal patronage in Gaul – Saint-Maur-des-Fossés and Fleury Abbey provide examples. In Germany a famous example is Echternach; as late as 698, Willibrord established an abbey at a Roman villa of Echternach near Trier, presented to him by Irmina, daughter of Dagobert II, king of the Franks. Kintzheim was &quot;Villa Regis&quot;, the &quot;villa of the king&quot;. Around 590, Saint Eligius was born in a highly placed Gallo-Roman family at the &#x27;villa&#x27; of Chaptelat near Limoges, in Aquitaine (now France). The abbey at Stavelot was founded ca 650 on the domain of a former villa near Liège and the abbey of Vézelay had a similar founding.

==Post-Roman era==

As Europe&#x27;s influence spread to other cultures, the form, and use of the villa would also spread as well. In post-Roman times a &quot;villa&quot; referred to a self-sufficient, usually fortified Italian or Gallo-Roman farmstead. It was economically as self-sufficient as a &quot;village&quot; and its inhabitants, who might be legally tied to it as serfs were &quot;villeins&quot;. The Merovingian Franks inherited the concept, followed by the Carolingian French but the later French term was &quot;basti&quot; or &quot;bastide.&quot;

&quot;Villa&quot;/&quot;Vila&quot; (or its cognates) is part of many Spanish and Portuguese placenames, like Vila Real and Villadiego: a &quot;villa&quot;/&quot;vila&quot; is a town with a charter (&quot;fuero&quot; or &quot;foral&quot;) of lesser importance than a &quot;ciudad&quot;/&quot;cidade&quot; (&quot;city&quot;). When it is associated with a personal name, &quot;villa&quot; was probably used in the original sense of a country estate rather than a chartered town. Later evolution has made the Hispanic distinction between &quot;villas&quot; and &quot;ciudades&quot; a purely honorific one. Madrid is the &quot;Villa y Corte&quot;, the villa considered to be separate from the formerly mobile royal court, but the much smaller Ciudad Real was declared &quot;ciudad&quot; by the Spanish crown.

==Italian Renaissance==
===Tuscany===

In 14th and 15th century Italy, a &quot;villa&quot; once more connoted a country house, like the first Medici villas, the Villa del Trebbio and that at Cafaggiolo, both strong fortified houses built in the 14th century in the Mugello region near Florence. In 1450, Giovanni de&#x27; Medici commenced on a hillside the Villa Medici in Fiesole, Tuscany, probably the first villa created under the instructions of Leon Battista Alberti, who theorized the features of the new idea of villa in his &quot;De re aedificatoria&quot;.
These first examples of Renaissance villa predate the age of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, who added the Villa di Poggio a Caiano by Giuliano da Sangallo, begun in 1470, in Poggio a Caiano, Province of Prato, Tuscany.

From Tuscany the idea of &quot;villa&quot; was spread again through Renaissance Italy and Europe.

====Tuscan villa gardens====

The Quattrocento villa gardens were treated as a fundamental and aesthetic link between a residential building and the outdoors, with views over a humanized agricultural landscape, at that time the only desirable aspect of nature. Later villas and gardens include the Palazzo Pitti and Boboli Gardens in Florence, and the Villa di Pratolino in Vaglia.

===Rome===

Rome had more than its share of villas with easy reach of the small sixteenth-century city: the progenitor, the first &quot;villa suburbana&quot; built since Antiquity, was the Belvedere or &quot;palazzetto&quot;, designed by Antonio del Pollaiuolo and built on the slope above the Vatican Palace.
The Villa Madama, the design of which, attributed to Raphael and carried out by Giulio Romano in 1520, was one of the most influential private houses ever built; elements derived from Villa Madama appeared in villas through the 19th century. Villa Albani was built near the Porta Salaria. Other are the Villa Borghese; the Villa Doria Pamphili (1650); the Villa Giulia of Pope Julius III (1550), designed by Vignola. The Roman villas Villa Ludovisi and Villa Montalto, were destroyed during the late nineteenth century in the wake of the real estate bubble that took place in Rome after the seat of government of a united Italy was established at Rome.

The cool hills of Frascati gained the Villa Aldobrandini (1592); the Villa Falconieri and the Villa Mondragone. The Villa d&#x27;Este near Tivoli is famous for the water play in its terraced gardens. The Villa Medici was on the edge of Rome, on the Pincian Hill, when it was built in 1540. Besides these designed for seasonal pleasure, usually located within easy distance of a city, other Italian villas were remade from a &quot;rocca&quot; or castello, as the family seat of power, such as Villa Caprarola for the Farnese.

Near Siena in Tuscany, the Villa Cetinale was built by Cardinal Flavio Chigi. He employed Carlo Fontana, pupil of Gian Lorenzo Bernini to transform the villa and dramatic gardens in a Roman Baroque style by 1680. The Villa Lante garden is one of the most sublime creations of the Italian villa in the landscape, completed in the 17th century.

=== Venice===

In the later 16th century in the northeastern Italian Peninsula the Palladian villas of the Veneto, designed by Andrea Palladio (1508–1580), were built in Vicenza in the Republic of Venice. Palladio always designed his villas with reference to their setting. He often unified all the farm buildings into the architecture of his extended villas while focusing on symmetry and perfect proportion.

Examples are the Villa Emo, the Villa Godi, the Villa Forni Cerato, the Villa Capra &quot;La Rotonda&quot;, and Villa Foscari.

The Villas are grouped into an association (Associazione Ville Venete) and offer touristic itineraries and accommodation possibilities.

==Villas elsewhere==

===17th century===
Soon after in Greenwich England, following his 1613–1615 Grand Tour, Inigo Jones designed and built the Queen&#x27;s House between 1615 and 1617 in an early Palladian architecture style adaptation in another country. The Palladian villa style renewed its influence in different countries and eras and remained influential for over four hundred years, with the Neo-Palladian a part of the late 17th century and on Renaissance Revival architecture period.

===18th and 19th centuries===
In the early 18th century the English took up the term, and applied it to compact houses in the country, especially those accessible from London: Chiswick House is an example of such a &quot;party villa&quot;. Thanks to the revival of interest in Palladio and Inigo Jones, soon Neo-Palladian villas dotted the valley of the River Thames and English countryside. Marble Hill House in England was conceived originally as a &quot;villa&quot; in the 18th-century sense.

In many ways the late 18th century Monticello, by Thomas Jefferson in Virginia, United States is a Palladian Revival villa. Other examples of the period and style are Hammond-Harwood House in Annapolis, Maryland; and many pre-American Civil War or antebellum plantations, such as Westover Plantation and many other James River plantations as well dozens of Antebellum era plantations in the rest of the Old South functioned as the Roman Latifundium villas had. A later revival, in the Gilded Age and early 20th century, produced The Breakers in Newport, Rhode Island, Filoli in Woodside, California, and Dumbarton Oaks in Georgetown, Washington, D.C.; by architects-landscape architects such as Richard Morris Hunt, Willis Polk, and Beatrix Farrand.

In the nineteenth century, the term &quot;villa&quot; was extended to describe any large suburban house that was free-standing in a landscaped plot of ground. By the time &#x27;semi-detached villas&#x27; were being erected at the turn of the twentieth century, the term collapsed under its extension and overuse.

The second half of the nineteenth century saw the creation of large &quot;Villenkolonien&quot; in the German speaking countries, wealthy residential areas that were completely made up of large mansion houses and often built to an artfully created masterplan. Also many large mansions for the wealthy German industrialists were built, such as Villa Hügel in Essen. The Villenkolonie of Lichterfelde West in Berlin was conceived after an extended trip by the architect through the South of England.
Representative historicist mansions in Germany include the Heiligendamm and other resort architecture mansions at the Baltic Sea, Rose Island and King&#x27;s House on Schachen in the Bavarian Alps, Villa Dessauer in Bamberg, Villa Wahnfried in Bayreuth, Drachenburg near Bonn, Hammerschmidt Villa in Bonn, the Liebermann Villa and Britz House in Berlin, Albrechtsberg, Eckberg, Villa Stockhausen and in Dresden, Villa Waldberta in Feldafing, in Frankfurt, Jenisch House and Budge-Palais in Hamburg, and in Königstein, Villa Stuck and in Munich, Schloss Klink at Lake Müritz, Villa Ludwigshöhe in Rhineland-Palatinate, Villa Haux in Stuttgart and Weinberg House in Waren.

In France the Château de Ferrières is an example of the Italian Neo-Renaissance style villa – and in Britain the Mentmore Towers. A representative building of this style in Germany is Villa Haas (designed by Ludwig Hofmann) in Hesse.
Villa Hakasalmi in Helsinki (built in 1834–46) represents Empire-era villa architecture. It was the home of Aurora Karamzin (1808–1902) at the end of the 19th century and is now the city museum of Helsinki, Finland. 

===20th – 21st centuries===

====Europe====
During the 19th and 20th century, the term &quot;villa&quot; became widespread for detached mansions in Europe. Special forms are for instance spa villas (&quot;Kurvillen&quot; in German) and seaside villas (&quot;Bädervillen&quot; in German), that became especially popular at the end of the 19th century. The tradition established back then continued throughout the 20th century and even until today.

Another trend was the erection of rather minimalist mansions in the Bauhaus style since the 1920s, that also continues until today.

In Denmark, Norway and Sweden &quot;villa&quot; denotes most forms of single-family detached homes, regardless of size and standard.

====Americas====
The villa concept lived and lives on in the haciendas of Latin America and the estancias of Brazil and Argentina. The oldest are original Portuguese and Spanish Colonial architecture; followed after independences in the Americas from Spain and Portugal, by the Spanish Colonial Revival style with regional variations. In the 20th century International Style villas were designed by Roberto Burle Marx, Oscar Niemeyer, Luis Barragán, and other architects developing a unique Euro-Latin synthesized aesthetic.

Villas are particularly well represented in California and the West Coast of the United States, where they were originally commissioned by well travelled &quot;upper-class&quot; patrons moving on from the Queen Anne style Victorian architecture and Beaux-Arts architecture. Communities such as Montecito, Pasadena, Bel Air, Beverly Hills, and San Marino in Southern California, and Atherton and Piedmont in the San Francisco Bay Area are a few examples of villa density.

The popularity of Mediterranean Revival architecture in its various iterations over the last century has been consistently used in that region and in Florida. Just a few of the notable early architects were Wallace Neff, Addison Mizner, Stanford White, and George Washington Smith. A few examples are the Harold Lloyd Estate in Beverly Hills, California, Medici scale Hearst Castle on the Central Coast of California, and Villa Montalvo in the Santa Cruz Mountains of Saratoga, California, Villa Vizcaya in Coconut Grove, Miami, American Craftsman versions are the Gamble House and the villas by Greene and Greene in Pasadena, California

====Modern villas====
Modern architecture has produced some important examples of buildings known as villas:
* Villa Noailles by Robert Mallet-Stevens in Hyères, France
* Villa Savoye by Le Corbusier in Poissy, France
* Villa Mairea by Alvar Aalto in Noormarkku, Finland
* Villa Tugendhat by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in Brno, Czech Republic
* Villa Lewaro by Vertner Tandy in Irvington, New York

Country-villa examples:
* Hollyhock House (1919) by Frank Lloyd Wright in Hollywood
* Gropius House by Walter Gropius (1937) in Lincoln, Massachusetts
* Fallingwater by Frank Lloyd Wright (1939) in Pennsylvania, U.S.
* Farnsworth House by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in Plano, Illinois
* Kaufmann Desert House by Richard Neutra (1946) in Palm Springs, California
* Auldbrass Plantation by Frank Lloyd Wright (1940–1951) in Beaufort County, South Carolina
* Palácio da Alvorada by Oscar Niemeyer (1958) in Brasília, Brazil
* Getty Villa, in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles

====Other====
Today, the term &quot;villa&quot; is often applied to vacation rental properties. In the United Kingdom the term is used for high quality detached homes in warm destinations, particularly Florida and the Mediterranean. The term is also used in Pakistan, and in some of the Caribbean islands such as Jamaica, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Guadeloupe, British Virgin Islands, and others. It is similar for the coastal resort areas of Baja California Sur and mainland Mexico, and for hospitality industry destination resort &quot;luxury bungalows&quot; in various locations worldwide.

In Indonesia, the term &quot;villa&quot; is applied to Dutch colonial country houses (&quot;landhuis&quot;). Nowadays, the term is more popularly applied to vacation rental usually located in countryside area.

In Australia, &quot;villas&quot; or &quot;villa units&quot; are terms used to describe a type of townhouse complex which contains, possibly smaller attached or detached houses of up to 3–4 bedrooms that were built since the early 1980s.

In New Zealand, &quot;villa&quot; refers almost exclusively to Victorian and Edwardian wooden weatherboard houses mainly built between 1880 and 1914, characterised by high ceilings (often ), sash windows, and a long entrance hall.

In South Korea, the term &quot;villa&quot; refers to small multi-household house with 4 floors or less.

In Cambodia, &quot;villa&quot; is used as a loanword in the local language of Khmer, and is generally used to describe any type of detached townhouse that features yard space. The term does not apply to any particular architectural style or size, the only features that distinguish a Khmer villa from another building are the yard space and being fully detached. The terms &quot;twin-villa&quot; and &quot;mini-villa&quot; have been coined meaning semi-detached and smaller versions respectively. Generally, these would be more luxurious and spacious houses than the more common row houses. The yard space would also typically feature some form of garden, trees or greenery. Generally, these would be properties in major cities, where there is more wealth and hence more luxurious houses.

<text>Laurie Spiegel (born September 20, 1945) is an American composer. She has worked at Bell Laboratories, in computer graphics, and is known primarily for her electronic music compositions and her algorithmic composition software Music Mouse. She is also a guitarist and lutenist.

Spiegel&#x27;s musical interpretation of Johannes Kepler&#x27;s &quot;Harmonices Mundi&quot; appeared on &quot;Sounds of Earth&quot; section of the Voyager Golden Record. Her 1972 piece &quot;Sediment&quot; was included in the 2012 film &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;.

She has been inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

== Education ==

Spiegel&#x27;s early musical experiences were largely self-directed, beginning with the mandolin, guitar, and banjo she had as a child, which she learned to play by ear. She became interested by electronics after using a tape-operated computer at Purdue University as part of a high school class field trip. At the age of 20, she taught herself Western music notation, after which she began writing down her compositions.

Spiegel attended Shimer College in Naperville, Illinois, through the school&#x27;s early entrance program. She subsequently spent a year at the University of Oxford through an exchange program at Shimer. After receiving her bachelor&#x27;s degree in sociology from Shimer in 1967, she stayed in Oxford for an additional year, commuting to London to study guitar, music theory, and composition with John W. Duarte. 

After moving to Manhattan, where she briefly worked in social sciences research and documentary film, she studied composition under Jacob Druckman, Vincent Persichetti, and Hall Overton at the Juilliard School from 1969 to 1972 and privately with Emmanuel Ghent. Spiegel felt like an outsider at the Juilliard School, perceiving her interests in the emotional and structural aspects of music to be at odds with &quot;the post-Webernite, serialist, atonal, blip and bleep school of music&quot; which dominated conservatory pedagogy at the time. However, she forged many meaningful connections outside of the conservatory by working in shared studio spaces around New York, such as the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center (now the &quot;Computer Music Center&quot;) to which her composition teacher had granted her access. 

She subsequently became Druckman&#x27;s assistant and followed him to Brooklyn College, completing her master&#x27;s degree in composition there in 1975 and pursuing research in early American music under the direction of H. Wiley Hitchcock.

== Career ==

Best known for her use of algorithmic composition techniques, Spiegel worked with Buchla and Electronic Music Laboratories synthesizers and digital systems including Bell Labs&#x27; GROOVE system (1973–1978), the Bell Labs Digital Synthesizer (1977), the alphaSyntauri synthesizer system for the Apple II computer (1978–1981), and the McLeyvier (1981–1985). In various pieces, Spiegel has used musical algorithms to simulate natural phenomena, emulate tonal harmony rules of earlier musical eras, and sonically represent large data sets. In her piece &quot;Viroid&quot;, for example, she used the genetic code of a simple organism to determine the pitches produced by a synthesizer. In her 1977 piece &quot;Improvisation on a Concerto Generator&quot;, she used an algorithm designed to replicate Bach&#x27;s &quot;chorale-style harmonic progressions.&quot; Spiegel views algorithmic music as a natural extension to the rule-based systems of traditional Western music, such as counterpoint and voice-leading, and her ultimate goal in using such techniques is to automate logical musical tasks so that she can &quot;focus more completely on the aspects of music that I cannot reduce to logic.&quot; 

Many of Spiegel&#x27;s non-algorithmic compositions also use algorithm-like rules, and the artist has claimed that defining these rules in computer code was simply a natural next step for her own musical self expression.

Spiegel&#x27;s best known and most widely used software was Music Mouse (1986), a self-described &quot;intelligent instrument&quot; for Macintosh, Amiga, and Atari computers. In addition to improvisations using this software, Spiegel composed several works using Music Mouse including &quot;Cavis muris&quot; in 1986, &quot;Three Sonic Spaces&quot; in 1989, and &quot;Sound Zones&quot; in 1990. She continued to update the program through Macintosh OS 9, and as of 2012, it remained available for purchase or demo download from her Web site.

In addition to electronics and computer-based music, Spiegel has composed works for piano, guitar and other solo instruments and small orchestra, as well as drawings, photography, video art, numerous writings and computer software. In the visual domain, Spiegel wrote one of the first drawing or painting programs at Bell Labs, which she expanded to include interactive video and synchronous audio output in the mid-1970s.

Spiegel was a video artist in residence at the Experimental Television Lab at WNET Thirteen in New York (1976). She composed series music for the TV Lab&#x27;s weekly &quot;VTR—Video and Television Review&quot; and audio special effects for its 2-hour science fiction film &quot;The Lathe of Heaven&quot;, both under the direction of David Loxton.

In addition to computer software development, starting in the early 1970s, Spiegel supported herself by both teaching and by soundtrack composition, having had steady work throughout the 1970s at Spectra Films, Valkhn Films, the Experimental TV Lab at WNET (PBS), and subsequently for various individual video artists, animators, and filmmakers. As a self-proclaimed lover of emotional music, Spiegel thoroughly enjoyed her brief work as a soundtrack composer : &quot;When you do soundtracks,&quot; she claims, &quot;all that really matters is emotional content.&quot;

In the 1980s, she focused on developing music software and consulting in the music technology field, as well as teaching at Cooper Union and New York University. For her work she received a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award (2018).

In 2018 Spiegel&#x27;s early &quot;Music for New Electronic Media&quot; was part of the Chicago New Media 1973-1992 Exhibition, curated by Jon Cates.

In 2023, she was awarded the Giga-Hertz Main Award for Electronic Music by the Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe for her life&#x27;s work. In 2018, she began the process of digitally archiving her entire body of work.

== Influence and Activism ==
Spiegel&#x27;s writings on the importance of musical pattern manipulation on computer music interface design has influenced the design of live coding music software environments such as Tidalcycles.

Spiegel is an outspoken animal rights activist, and she has sought throughout her career to raise awareness for &quot;underprivileged and disparaged&quot; animals within urban landscapes, such as mice, rats, and pigeons. She first learned to care for pigeons as part of a college psychology course, and she began rehabilitating injured birds in Tribeca after the September 11 attacks. In 2004, Spiegel started a personal effort to regularly feed local pigeons so that they could have &quot;species appropriate&quot; meals, and as of 2024, she continues to feed pigeons almost daily in Manhattan&#x27;s Duane Park. 

As part of her effort to raise awareness for animal rights, Spiegel has composed several works related to urban wildlife. The most notable of these works is a 2006 audio-visual installation titled &quot;Ferals&quot; which featured over 3,000 original photographs of New York City pigeons. This visual display was accompanied by a collage of pigeon sounds which attempted to sonically relate the story of &quot;two hungry juvenile pigeons begging their parents for food.&quot; Other works focused on animal rights include &quot;Anon a Mouse&quot; (2003), a short recorded &quot;opera&quot; featuring a human, a dog, and a mouse, and &quot;Cavis Muris&quot; (1986), which attempted to sonically depict the mice which occupied her warehouse at the time.

Spiegel is also dedicated to the democratization and accessibility of music, and she has described her achievements towards this end as &quot;one of the greatest gratifications of my own work.&quot; She believes that the tools of computer music, such as her own Music Mouse software, can lower the monetary and temporal barriers to entry that has been historically associated with music production. These sorts of tools, she believes, have already increased the representation of groups which have been historically underrepresented in the industry, such as women composers.

<text>Fred Holland Day (July 23, 1864 – November 23, 1933) was an American photographer and publisher. He was prominent in literary and photography circles in the late nineteenth century and was a leading Pictorialist. He was an early and vocal advocate for accepting photography as a fine art.

==Life==
Fred Holland Day was the son of a wealthy Boston merchant, and was a man of independent means for all his life. He was a descendant of Ralph Day of Dedham.

Day&#x27;s life and works were controversial because he took an unconventional approach to religious subjects and often photographed male nudes. His emphasis on the classical ideal sometimes bordered on homoeroticism. According to Pam Roberts, &quot;Day never married and his sexual orientation, whilst it is widely assumed that he was homosexual, because of his interests, his photographic subject matter, his general flamboyant demeanor, was, like much else about him, a very private matter.&quot;

Day spent much time among poor immigrant children in Boston, tutoring them in reading and mentoring them. One in particular, the 13-year-old Lebanese immigrant Kahlil Gibran, went on to fame as the author of &quot;The Prophet&quot;.

Day co-founded and self-financed the publishing firm of Copeland and Day, which from 1893 through 1899 published about a hundred titles. The firm was influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement and William Morris&#x27;s Kelmscott Press. The firm was the American publisher of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Salomé&quot;, illustrated by Aubrey Beardsley; &quot;The Yellow Book&quot;, a periodical also illustrated by Beardsley; and &quot;The Black Riders and Other Lines&quot; by Stephen Crane.

He is known to have traveled. Beaumont Newhall states that he visited Algiers, possibly as a result of reading Wilde and Gide. There is a photographic &quot;Portrait of F. Holland Day in Arab Costume, 1901&quot; by Frederick H. Evans.

Day was a friend of Louise Imogen Guiney and Ralph Adams Cram, and a member of social clubs, such as the Visionists, formed around shared interests in arts and literature. He was a major patron of Aubrey Beardsley.

He was also a lifelong bibliophile and collector. Most notable among his collections was his world-class collection on the poet John Keats.

==Work==
At the turn of the century, his influence and reputation as a photographer rivaled that of Alfred Stieglitz, who later eclipsed him. The high point of Day&#x27;s photographic career was probably his organization of an exhibition of photographs at the Royal Photographic Society in 1900. &quot;New School of American Photography&quot; presented 375 photographs by 42 photographers, 103 of them by Day, and evoked both high praise and vitriolic scorn from critics. The populist &quot;Photographic News&quot; saw it as the result &quot;of a diseased imagination, of which much has been fostered by the ravings of a few lunatics ... unacademic ... and eccentric&quot;.

Day belonged to the pictorialist movement which regarded photography as a fine art and which often included symbolist imagery. The Photo-Secessionists invited him to join, but he declined the offer. As was common at the time, his photographs allude to classical antiquity in manner, composition and often in theme. From 1896 through 1898 Day experimented with Christian themes, using himself as a model for Jesus. Neighbors in Norwood, Massachusetts, assisted him in an outdoor photographic re-enactment of the crucifixion of Jesus. This culminated in his series of self-photographs, &quot;The Seven Last Words,&quot; depicting the seven last words of Christ.

He often made only a single print from a negative. He used only the platinum process, being unsatisfied with any other, and lost interest in photography when platinum became unobtainable following the Russian Revolution.

==Legacy==
Day became all but forgotten for a number of reasons. He was eclipsed by his rival, Stieglitz. The pictorial and symbolist photographic style went out of fashion in the face of the radical shift towards early modernism in the art world. Two thousand of his prints and negatives were lost in a 1904 fire. The few hundred that survived were sent to the Royal Photographic Society in the 1930s.

Since the 1990s, Day&#x27;s works have been included in major exhibitions by museum curators, notably in the solo Day retrospective at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 2000-2001 and similar shows at the Royal Photographic Society in England and the Fuller Craft Museum. Art historians are once again taking an interest in Day, and there are now significant academic texts on Day&#x27;s homoerotic portraiture, and its similarities to the work of Walter Pater and Thomas Eakins.

Day&#x27;s house at 93 Day Street in Norwood, Massachusetts, is now the F. Holland Day House &amp; Norwood History Museum. It also serves as the headquarters of the Norwood Historical Society.

<text>The chipping sparrow (Spizella passerina) is a species of New World sparrow, a passerine bird in the family Passerellidae. It is widespread, fairly tame, and common across most of its North American range.

The chipping sparrow has five subspecies. This bird is a partial migrant with northerly populations flying southwards in the fall to overwinter in Mexico and the southern United States, and flying northward again in spring.

It molts twice a year. In its breeding plumage it has orangish-rust upper parts, gray head and underparts and a distinctive reddish cap. In non-breeding plumage, the cap is brown and the facial markings are less distinct. The song is a trill and the bird has a piercing flight call that can be heard while it is migrating at night.

In the winter, Chipping Sparrows are gregarious and form flocks, sometimes associating with other bird species. They mostly forage on the ground for seeds and other food items, as well as clambering on plants and trees, feeding on buds and small arthropods. In the west of their range they breed mainly in coniferous forests, but in the east, they choose woodland, farmland, parks and gardens. Breeding starts in late April and May and the nest is often built in a tree.

==Description==

Throughout the year, adults are gray below and an orangish-rust color above. Adults in alternate (breeding) plumage have a reddish cap, a nearly white supercilium, and a black trans-ocular line (running through the eye). Adults in basic (nonbreeding) plumage are less prominently marked, with a brownish cap, a dusky eyebrow, and a dark eye-line.

Juvenile chipping sparrows are prominently streaked below. Like non-breeding adults, they show a dark eye-line, extending both in front of and behind the eye. The brownish cap and dusky eyebrow are variable but generally obscure in juveniles.

Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

==Breeding==
The male chipping sparrows start arriving at the breeding grounds from March (in more southern areas, such as Texas) to mid-May (in southern Alberta and northern Ontario). The female arrives one to two weeks later, and the male starts singing soon after to find and court a mate. After pair formation, nesting begins (within about two weeks of the female&#x27;s arrival). Overall, the breeding season is from March till about August.

The chipping sparrow breeds in grassy, open woodland clearings and shrubby grass fields. The nest is normally above ground but below in height, and about on average, in a tree (usually a conifer, especially those that are young, short, and thick) or bush. The nest itself is constructed by the female in about four days. It consists of a loose platform of grass and rootlets and open inner cup of plant fiber and animal hair.

The chipping sparrow lays a clutch of two to seven pale blue to white eggs with black, brown, or purple markings. They are about , and incubated by the female for 10 to 15 days. The chipping sparrow is often brood parasitized by brown-headed cowbirds, usually resulting in the nest being abandoned.

==Feeding==
The chipping sparrow feeds on seeds year-round, although insects form most of the diet in the breeding season. Spiders are sometimes taken. &quot;Taraxacum officinale&quot; seeds are important during spring, and seeds from &quot;Fallopia convolvulus&quot;, &quot;Melilotus&quot; spp., &quot;Stellaria media&quot;, &quot;Chenopodium album&quot;, &quot;Avena&quot; spp., and others.

Throughout the year, chipping sparrows forage on the ground in covered areas, often near the edges of fields.

<doc id="342555" wikidata="Q632891" url="?curid=342555" title="McMaster University">
<text>McMaster University (McMaster or Mac) is a public research university in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. The main McMaster campus is on of land near the residential neighbourhoods of Ainslie Wood and Westdale, adjacent to the Royal Botanical Gardens. It operates six academic faculties: the DeGroote School of Business, Engineering, Health Sciences, Humanities, Social Science, and Science. It is a member of the U15, a group of research-intensive universities in Canada.

The university bears the name of William McMaster, a prominent Canadian senator and banker who bequeathed C$900,000 to its founding. It was incorporated under the terms of an act of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1887, merging the Toronto Baptist College with Woodstock College. It opened in Toronto in 1890. Inadequate facilities and the gift of land in Hamilton prompted its relocation in 1930. The Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec controlled the university until it became a privately chartered, publicly funded non-denominational institution in 1957.

As of 2024, McMaster University has over 32,000 undergraduate and over 5,000 post-graduate students. Alumni and former students reside across Canada and in 143 countries. Its athletic teams are known as the Marauders, and are members of U Sports. Notable alumni include government officials, academics, business leaders, Rhodes Scholars, Gates Cambridge Scholars, and Nobel laureates.

==History==
McMaster University resulted from the outgrowth of educational initiatives undertaken by Baptists as early as the 1830s. The predecessor institution of McMaster was established in 1881 as Toronto Baptist College. Canadian Senator William McMaster, the first president of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, bequeathed funds to endow a university, which was incorporated through a merger of Toronto Baptist College and the faculty of theology in Woodstock College, Woodstock, Ontario. The merger was formalized in 1887 when the &quot;Act to unite Toronto Baptist College and Woodstock College&quot; was granted royal assent, with the newly incorporated institution being named McMaster University. 

In 1887, the widow of William McMaster, Susan Moulton McMaster, conveyed a former family residence to the university for the purpose of establishing a preparatory school for girls. The Ladies&#x27; Department of Woodstock College transferred control of its Ladies&#x27; Department to the university, and the building was reopened as Moulton Ladies&#x27; College in 1888. The preparatory school operated until 1958, when it was closed by the university.

The new university, housed in McMaster Hall in Toronto, was sponsored by the Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec as an undergraduate institution for its clergy and adherents. The first courses—initially limited to arts and theology leading to a BA degree—were taught in 1890, and the first degrees were conferred in 1894.

As the university grew, McMaster Hall started to become overcrowded. The suggestion to move the university to Hamilton was first brought up by a student and Hamilton native in 1909, although the proposal was not seriously considered by the university until two years later. By the 1920s, after previous proposals between various university staff, the Hamilton Chamber of Commerce launched a campaign to bring McMaster University to Hamilton. As the issue of space at McMaster Hall became more acute, the university administration debated the future of the university. The university nearly became federated with the University of Toronto, as had been the case with Trinity College and Victoria College.

Instead, in 1927, the university administration decided to move the university to Hamilton. The Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec secured $1.5 million, while the citizens of Hamilton raised an additional $500,000 to help finance the move. The lands for the university and new buildings were secured through gifts from graduates. Lands were transferred from Royal Botanical Gardens to establish the campus area. The first academic session on the new Hamilton campus began in 1930. McMaster&#x27;s property in Toronto was sold to the University of Toronto when McMaster moved to Hamilton in 1930. McMaster Hall is now home to the Royal Conservatory of Music.

Professional programs during the interwar period were limited to just theology and nursing. By the 1940s the McMaster administration was under pressure to modernize and expand the university&#x27;s programs. During the Second World War and post-war periods the demand for technological expertise, particularly in the sciences, increased. This problem placed a strain on the finances of what was still a denominational Baptist institution. In particular, the institution could no longer secure sufficient funds from denominational sources alone to sustain science research. Since denominational institutions could not receive public funds, the Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec decided to reorganize the university, creating two federated colleges. The arts and divinity programs were reconstituted as University College and science was reorganized under the newly incorporated Hamilton College as a separate division capable of receiving provincial grants. Hamilton College was incorporated in 1948 by letters patent under &quot;The Companies Act&quot;, although it remained only affiliated with the university. The university traditionally focused on undergraduate studies, and did not offer a PhD program until 1949.

Through the 1950s increased funding advanced the place of sciences within the institution. In 1950, the university had completed the construction of three academic buildings for the sciences, all designed by local architect William Russell Souter. Public funding was eventually necessary to ensure the humanities and social sciences were given an equal place. Thus, in 1957 the university reorganized once again under &quot;The McMaster University Act, 1957&quot;, dissolving the two colleges. Its property was vested to McMaster and the university became a nondenominational institution eligible for public funding. The historic Baptist connection was continued through McMaster Divinity College, a separately chartered affiliated college of the university. Also in 1957, PhD programs were consolidated in a new Faculty of Graduate Studies. Construction of the McMaster Nuclear Reactor also began in 1957, and was the first university-based research reactor in the Commonwealth when it began operating in 1959.

In 1965, with the support of the Ontario government, the university established a medical school and teaching hospital, graduating its first class of physicians in 1972. In 1968 the university was reorganized under an amended act of the McMaster Act into the Divisions of Arts, Science, and Health Sciences, each with its own vice-president, while the Divinity College continued under its existing arrangement. In 1974 the divisional structure of the university was dissolved and reorganized again under &quot;The McMaster University Act, 1976&quot; and the vice-presidents were replaced by a single vice-president (academic). The Faculties of Business, Engineering, Health Sciences, Humanities, Science, and Social Sciences were retained, each under the leadership of a dean.

==Campus==

McMaster University is in the city of Hamilton, Ontario, in the Golden Horseshoe along the western end of Lake Ontario. The main campus is bordered to the north by Cootes Paradise, an extensive natural marshland; to the east and west by residential neighbourhoods; and to its south by Main Street West, a major transportation artery. Its northern boundaries are a popular destination for walkers who use the many trails that connect the campus to Royal Botanical Gardens. While the main campus is , most of the teaching facilities are within the core . In addition to its main campus in Hamilton, McMaster owns several other properties around Hamilton as well as in Burlington, Kitchener, and St. Catharines, Ontario.

In 2017, the university owned and managed 58 buildings, including both on and off campus housing. The buildings at McMaster vary in age—from Hamilton Hall which opened in 1926, to the university&#x27;s new Bertrand Russell Archives and Research Centre, which opened 25 June 2018. McMaster&#x27;s main campus is divided into three main areas: the Core Campus, North Campus and West Campus. The Core Campus has most of the university&#x27;s academic, research and residential buildings, while the North Campus is made up of the university&#x27;s athletic precinct and a small amount of surface parking. The West Campus is the least developed area of the main campus, containing only a few buildings, surface parking, and undeveloped land. Security at the university is provided by special constables employed by McMaster University Security Service, a department of the university.
===Academic facilities===

The university&#x27;s campus has gone through continuous development since 1928. The main campus&#x27;s six original buildings are of Collegiate Gothic architecture, designed by William Lyon Somerville, who also laid out the initial campus plan. They are now flanked by over fifty structures built predominantly from the 1940s to 1960s. The largest facility is the McMaster University Medical Centre, a multi-use research hospital that is home to the second-largest neonatal intensive care unit and the third-largest child and youth mental health unit in the country. It is connected to the Life Sciences building and the Michael DeGroote Centre for Learning &amp; Discovery, which houses many well-funded research groups in areas of genetics, infectious diseases, and several specific conditions.

The McMaster Nuclear Reactor (MNR) has been the largest university reactor in the Commonwealth since it began operation and is the second largest research reactor in North America. It is a &quot;pool-type&quot; reactor with a core of enriched uranium fuel moderated and cooled by distilled water. While the MNR&#x27;s primary purpose is research and the production of medical isotopes, the MNR serves students in nuclear engineering, medical and health physics, and other applied radiation sciences. The university provides a wide range of irradiation, laboratory, and holding facilities, which include a cyclotron, an accelerator, a small-angle neutron-scattering detector, and wide-angle neutron scattering facilities. The cyclotron is used for the production of fluorine-18, and is used for research purposes, particularly the development of novel molecular imaging agents.

===Library and museum===
The university&#x27;s library system is a member of 31 organizations, including the Association of Research Libraries. Around 2.8 million articles were downloaded from the library system&#x27;s electronic journal collection during the 2016 academic year. The university library employs 138 professional, and support staff. The library&#x27;s resource expenditure for the 2016–2017 academic year was approximately $11.5 million, with 81 per cent of the budget allocated to serial and e-resource subscriptions, 9 per cent on hard copy acquisitions, and 10 per cent to membership and collections support. The library system include four libraries housing 1,274,265 paper books and 3,689,973 total resources, including videos, maps, sound recordings, and microfilm. Mills Library houses the humanities and social sciences collections, with a wide range of print and digital resources. Innis Library houses content which supports the academic and research interests of the DeGroote School of Business. Thode Library houses academic material of various disciplines of science and engineering, while the Health Science Library houses books pertaining to medical sciences. The William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections at McMaster University consist of papers of Canadian publishers; British personalities and of Canadian literary figures such as Farley Mowat, Pierre Berton, Matt Cohen, and Marian Engel. It includes the archives of Bertrand Russell, and of labour unions.

The McMaster Museum of Art&#x27;s (MMA) principal role is to support the academic mission of McMaster University and to contribute to the discourse on art in Canada. The museum has the highest attendance figures for a university-affiliated museum in Canada, with 30,000 visitors in 2016. Established in 1967, the museum houses and exhibits the university&#x27;s art collection. As of 2015, that collection of 5,971 pieces holds a value of $98.7 million. The collection includes works by Gustave Courbet, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Walter Sickert and Vincent van Gogh. The museum also boasts the most comprehensive collection of German expressionist and Weimar period prints in Canada.

===Housing and student facilities===
As of August 2022, McMaster has thirteen smoke-free student residences: Bates Residence, Brandon Hall, Edwards Hall, Hedden Hall, Les Prince Hall, Mary E. Keyes Residence, Matthews Hall, McKay Hall, Moulton Hall, Peter George Centre for Living and Learning, Wallingford Hall, Whidden Hall, and Woodstock Hall. McMaster&#x27;s student residences can accommodate 4,186 students. The latest residence to be built was Peter George Centre for Living and Learning (PGCLL), which was completed in Fall 2019. PGCLL can house 500 students and also contains lecture halls, tutorial rooms, and eateries. Les Prince Hall, the second-latest residence to be completed and a large co-ed building, opened in 2006. It was named for a long-time hall master in the residence system who lived with his family on campus until after his retirement in 1980. In September 2010, 50.19 per cent of first-year students lived on campus, with 15.54 per cent of the overall undergraduate population living on campus.

Residences provide traditional room and board style, furnished apartment style, and suite-style accommodation. Brandon Hall houses the university&#x27;s substance-free lifestyle living spaces. The residence system is supervised by Residence Life staff, who provide guidance and help the transition to university life for many first-year students. 

The McMaster University Student Centre (MUSC) is the centre of student life and programming. It has a café, study space, common areas, and several administrative departments, including the CIBC Conference Hall. The MUSC contains the offices of a number of student organizations, including the McMaster Students Union and &quot;The Silhouette&quot; weekly newspaper as well as other services such as the Campus Health Centre and the campus dentist. The university has over twenty dining outlets throughout the campus, including two major residence dining facilities. The university has several vegetarian establishments, such as a completely vegetarian cafe known as Bridges Café and a farmers market stand. The university was voted as the country&#x27;s most vegan-friendly university through People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) for a number of years. Several other dining outlets at McMaster have garnered awards throughout the years for food services.

===Off-campus facilities===
As of 2010 McMaster University&#x27;s DeGroote School of Business operates a site in the neighbouring city of Burlington. Consideration for the new building began in 2004, when McMaster University had announced its initial intent to construct a new arts- and technology-intensive campus in partnership with the city of Burlington. In 2009, the City of Burlington, Halton Region, and McMaster University signed an official agreement laying out the timelines and next steps for the university&#x27;s expansion into Burlington. Construction began on 17 June 2009, and the official opening was on 7 October 2010. The four-story, building is called the Ron Joyce Centre. The Ron Joyce Centre is home to DeGroote&#x27;s MBA program and its business management program (both degree and non-degree programs).

McMaster has several administrative offices at its Downtown Centre. The McMaster Centre for Continuing Education, which offers certificate and diploma programs as well as personal and professional development programs, is within the former Bank of Montreal Pavilion at Lloyd D. Jackson Square. McMaster had also announced construction of the McMaster Downtown Health Campus in downtown Hamilton had begun in December 2012. The Health Campus is expected to provide teaching spaces, exam rooms and clinical spaces for local residents.

The Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine is on the main campus as well as in two regional campuses at St. Catharines and Kitchener. The Waterloo Regional Campus is in downtown Kitchener, where it shares facilities with the Health Sciences Campus of the University of Waterloo. The campus in St. Catharines is at Brock University&#x27;s Niagara Health and Bioscience Research Complex. Approximately 30 medical students in each year of the program attend each campus. Those who apply to McMaster&#x27;s School of Medicine are asked to rank their site choice (Hamilton, Niagara Region, Waterloo Region) from first to third, or no preference. Offers of admission to the medical school are made from a rank list irrespective of geographical preference. Subsequent to an applicant&#x27;s acceptance, registrants to the class are placed based on their preference and geographical background. The offers given out by McMaster are bound to the assigned site.

McMaster purchased a large industrial park three kilometres east of its main Hamilton campus in 2005 with the intention of creating an array of research facilities for the development of advanced manufacturing and materials, biotechnology, automotive, and nanotechnology. In July 2005 the federal government announced it would relocate CANMET, a federal government materials research laboratory, from its Ottawa centre to Hamilton. This decision helped spearhead the development of the McMaster Innovation Park. The United Nations University-International Network on Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH) is headquartered within the park. UNU-INWEH is the only United Nations agency headquartered in Ontario and the only North American host site for a United Nations University, after moving to McMaster Innovation Park on 23 April 2008.

===Sustainability===
The Office of Sustainability, created as the All-modes Commuting &amp; Transportation Office in 2002, is charged with promoting sustainable operations and growth at the university. The Office of Sustainability, headed by the Manager of University Sustainability, works with various members of the university population, external community groups, and the government. Along with the other members of the Council of Ontario Universities, McMaster signed a pledge in 2009 known as &quot;Ontario Universities Committed to a Greener World&quot;, with the objective of transforming its campus into a model of environmental responsibility. On 21 October 2010, the university signed two accords addressing the issue of climate change: the Talloires Declaration and the &quot;University and College Presidents&#x27; Climate Change Statement of Action for Canada&quot;.

The university campus received a B grade from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card for 2011.

==Administration==
The governance of the university is conducted through the board of governors and the senate, both of which were established in the Act to unite Toronto Baptist College and Woodstock College in 1887. The board is responsible for the university&#x27;s conduct, management, and control of the university and of its property, revenues, business, and affairs. Ex officio governors of the Board include the university&#x27;s chancellor, president, and the chairman of the board-senate committee on long-range planning. The Board also consists of 34 other governors, either appointed or elected by the various members of the university&#x27;s community, including elected representatives from the student body. While The McMaster University Act, 1976 outlines that the board be only composed of 37 members, the Board also includes 12 honorary members, bringing the total number of governors to 51.

The senate is responsible for the university&#x27;s academics, including standards for admission into the university and qualifications for degrees, diplomas, and certificates. The senate consists of 15 ex officio positions granted to the chancellor, the president, the vice-presidents of the university, the senior dean of each faculty, the dean of graduate studies, the dean of adult education, the principal of McMaster Divinity College, and the chairman of the Undergraduate Council. The senate also consists of 51 other members, appointed or elected by the various communities of the university, including elected representatives of the student body. Meetings of the board of governors and the senate are open to the public.

The president acts as the chief executive officer of the university under the authority of the board and the senate, and supervises and directs the academic and administrative work of the university and of its teaching and non-teaching staff. The office was created in 1949, with George Gilmour serving as the university&#x27;s first president. The office of the vice-chancellor, created at the same time as the office of president, has always been held by the incumbent president of the university. The university president, David H. Farrar, has served the post on an interim basis since 1 July 2019, although his tenure as the official university president did not begin until the following year. 

David Farrar&#x27;s tenure will end in 2025, following the announcement of his resignation. McMaster University is pleased to announce the appointment of its 9th president and vice-chancellor, Dr. Susan Tighe.

The appointment of Dr. Tighe was unanimously approved by the Committee for Recommending a President which was then followed by approval of the university’s Senate and Board of Governors.

===Affiliated institution===
McMaster University is affiliated with one post-secondary institution, McMaster Divinity College. The seminary is within the campus of the university. As an affiliated institution, two members of the Divinity College sit on the university&#x27;s senate, as well as appoint one representative to sit in the university&#x27;s board of governors. However, the Divinity College operates with its own senate and board of trustees. Although Divinity College has the authority to confer their own degrees, students taking the college&#x27;s Master of Divinity and Master of Theological Studies are awarded degrees by McMaster University. Students of Divinity College have access to the catalogue of McMaster University Library, while students of the university similarly have access to the Canadian Baptist Archives, managed by the university&#x27;s library system.

The university and the divinity college were incorporated as the same institution in 1887, a result of a merger between two Baptist institutions, the Canadian Literary Institute in Woodstock, Ontario, and Toronto Baptist College. McMaster University continued to operate as a Baptist-run institution until 1957, when provincial legislation allowed for the governance of the university to pass from the Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec, to a privately chartered, publicly funded arrangement. McMaster&#x27;s Faculty of Theology was spun-off into McMaster Divinity College, a separately-chartered affiliated college of the university.

From 1911 to 1938, Brandon College (reincorporated as Brandon University in 1967) was an affiliated institution of McMaster. Located in Brandon, Manitoba, the affiliated institution was funded by the Baptist Union of Western Canada. The college ended its affiliation with McMaster in 1938, after Brandon College became a non-denominational institution.

===Finances===
The net assets owned by the university as of 6 June 2024 stands at C$2,058.7 million. The university had completed the 2024–2025 year with revenues of C$1,400.3 million, expenses of $1,367.7 million, for an excess in revenue of $32.6 million. McMaster&#x27;s revenue comes from endowment income, gifts, fees, and annual grants from the City of Hamilton, the Province of Ontario, and the Government of Canada. In the 2024-25 academic year, the largest source of revenue for the university was tuition fees, followed by operating grants provided by the government. As of 30 April 2023, McMaster&#x27;s external financial endowment was valued at C$589.4 million. The financing of McMaster&#x27;s scholarships and bursaries takes up 40 per cent of the endowments received. Financial Services comprises the following areas: Student Accounts &amp; Cashiers, Financial Accounting and Reporting, and Budgeting Services.

The university has been registered as an educational charitable organization in Canada since 1 January 1967. As of 2011, the university is registered primarily as a post-secondary institution, with 70 per cent of the charity dedicated to the management and maintenance of the university. The remaining 30 per cent has been dedicated under research.

==Academics==

McMaster is a publicly funded research university, and a member of the Universities Canada. McMaster functions on a semester system, operating year-round on academic semesters, fall/winter and spring/summer. In the 2016–2017 academic year, the university had an enrolment of 31,265 students; 26,780 undergraduate students, 4,485 graduate students. Programs, departments, and schools at McMaster are divided among six faculties, the DeGroote School of Business, the Faculty of Health Sciences, the Faculty of Humanities, the Faculty of Engineering, the Faculty of Science, and the Faculty of Social Sciences.

By enrolment, McMaster&#x27;s largest faculty in September 2016 was the Faculty of Science, with 7,004 full-time and part-time undergraduate and graduate students. The Faculty of Humanities was the smallest faculty by enrolment, with 2,729 full-time and part-time undergraduate and graduate students. The Faculty of Health Sciences holds the highest graduate enrolment, with 1,144 graduate students. A number of university students are enrolled in interdisciplinary programs, administered by two or more faculties, including 549 graduate students. At the undergraduate level, the Arts and Science program is taught jointly by the six faculties at McMaster. Created in 1981, the program aims to provide a broad-based, liberal education, providing substantial work in both the arts and sciences. In September 2016, 278 undergraduate students were enrolled in the Arts and Science program.

The university also jointly administers several undergraduate collaborative programs with Mohawk College, in which 2,697 students are enrolled. The university also awards degrees to graduate students of McMaster Divinity College. The Divinity College was originally the university&#x27;s Faculty of Theology, before it was reorganized into a separately chartered, affiliated college of the university in 1957.

Students may apply for financial aid such as the Ontario Student Assistance Program and Canada Student Loans and Grants through the federal and provincial governments. The financial aid provided may come in the form of loans, grants, bursaries, scholarships, fellowships, debt reduction, interest relief, and work programs. In the 2016–2017 academic year, McMaster students received approximately C$100,972,910 in Ontario Student Assistance Program loans and C$40,061,756 in grants, approximately $140,981,009 in total. In the same year students received C$10,135,233.65 in bursaries.

The university international student exchange agreements with over 100 universities outside Canada, enabling its students to earn credits while studying abroad.

===McMaster Model===
The McMaster Model is the university&#x27;s policy for a student-centred, problem-based, interdisciplinary approach to learning. During the 1960s the McMaster University Medical School pioneered problem-based learning (PBL) tutorials that have since been adopted by other fields in the Faculty of Health Science, as well as other faculties and programs in the university. The PBL tutorial model has since been adopted into the curriculums of other medical schools in Canada, and more than 80 per cent of medical schools in the United States.

In 1991, McMaster&#x27;s School of Medicine adopted progress testing, developing the personal progress index (PPI), a system based on progress testing invented concurrently by the University of Missouri-Kansas City&#x27;s medical school and the Maastricht University. The PPI is used as an objective method for assessing acquisition and retention of knowledge for students in the medical program. The PPI is administered at regular intervals to all students in the program, regardless of their level of training, and plots students&#x27; scores as they move through the program. Students typically score 20 per cent on their first examination, and increase by five to seven per cent with each successive examination. Students can monitor the changes in their scores and receive formative feedback based on a standardized score relative to the class mean. Due to the overwhelming success and research supporting the use of the PPI as an evaluation tool, it is now used in Canada, US, Europe, and Australia.

===Rankings and reputation===

McMaster University has placed in post-secondary school rankings. In the 2022 &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; rankings, the university ranked 90th in the world and fourth in Canada.

In &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; 2023 rankings, McMaster placed fourth in their Medical-Doctoral university category, and fifth in their reputation survey for Canadian universities. McMaster was ranked in spite of having opted out from participation in Maclean&#x27;s graduate survey since 2006.

McMaster also placed in a number of rankings that evaluated the employment prospects of graduates. In &quot;QS&quot;″s 2022 graduate employability ranking, the university ranked 81st in the world, and fourth in Canada. In the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;″s 2022 global employability ranking, McMaster placed 81st in the world, and fifth in Canada. In an employability survey published by the New York Times in October 2011, when CEOs and chairmen were asked to select the top universities which they recruited from, McMaster placed 61st in the world, and fourth in Canada.

As of 2024, several of McMaster&#x27;s health science areas rank in the Top 5 in Canada and Top 100 globally, including Clinical Medicine (2nd in Canada and 17th globally) and Endocrinology and Metabolism (2nd in Canada and 36th globally).

===Research===

In 2018, Research Infosource named McMaster as the most research intensive university in the country with an average sponsored research income (external sources of funding) of C$434,700 per faculty member in 2017, the highest average in the country, and nearly double the average for universities in the &quot;Medical-Doctoral&quot; category. In the same year, graduate students averaged a sponsored research income of $82,800, the highest out of any full-service university. With a sponsored research income of $379.959 million in 2017, McMaster has the seventh largest sponsored research income amongst Canadian universities. In the 2015–2016 academic year, the federal government was the largest source of McMaster&#x27;s sponsored research income (excluding affiliated hospitals), providing 61.4 per cent of McMaster&#x27;s research budget, primarily through grants. Corporate research income account for 7.3 per cent of the overall research budget.

McMaster has been ranked on several bibliometric university rankings, which uses citation analysis to evaluate the impact a university has on academic publications. In 2019, the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities ranked McMaster 119th in the world, and sixth in Canada. The University Ranking by Academic Performance 2018–19 rankings placed the university 126th in the world, and sixth in Canada.

McMaster has received accolades for its research strengths, particularly in the field of health sciences. The Faculty of Health Science oversees $130 million a year in research, much of it conducted by scientists and physicians who teach in the medical school. The university also operates a brain bank, whose collection includes a portion of Albert Einstein&#x27;s brain, preserved and held for medical research. Researchers there have identified differences in his brain that may relate to his genius for spatial and mathematical thinking. In addition to traditional forms of research, members of Faculty of Health Sciences have also been credited with developments within the medical practice. A McMaster research group led by David Sackett and later Gordon Guyatt had been credited for establishing the methodologies used in evidence-based medicine. Research institutes operated by the Faculty of Health Science include the Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health, and the Population Health Research Institute. The faculty also operates a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory.

Other research institutes operated by the university include the Origins Institute, the McMaster Manufacturing Research Institute, and the Brockhouse Institute for Materials Research (BIMR). BIMR was created in 1960 by Howard Petch, the institute was named after McMaster alumnus Bertram Brockhouse. The BIMR is an interdisciplinary research organization with the mandate to develop, support, and co-ordinate all materials research related activities at McMaster. Its membership of 123 faculty members is drawn from 13 departments in the Faculties of Science, Engineering, and Health Sciences, as well as several Canadian and international universities. Facilities of the BIMR include the Canadian Centre for Electron Microscopy, Centre for Crystal Growth, McMaster Analytical Xray Facility, Electronic and Magnetic Characterization Facility, and the Photonics Research Laboratories. The Canadian Centre for Electron Microscopy is home to the world&#x27;s most powerful electron microscope; the Titan 80–300 cubed microscope has a magnification of 14 million and is used for material, medical, and nanotechnology research.

The Biology Greenhouse holds 217 plants in a facility, and is used as a teaching and research facility by the Department of Biology. In addition to maintaining its permanent collection, the Biology Greenhouse also grows plants for both short-term research studies.
In addition, the university also operates the McMaster Nuclear Reactor, used for nuclear science and engineering research since 1959. The university regularly acquires an operating license for the reactor from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, with the latest 10-year license issued on 1 July 2014. The swimming pool reactor is used for research, educational, and commercial applications such as neutron radiography, and medical radioisotope production; including 60 per cent of the world&#x27;s supply of iodine-125, an isotope used in nuclear medicine to treat prostate cancer. The production of molybdenum-99 has occasionally been moved to the university&#x27;s reactor, when production at the National Research Universal reactor was temporarily halted.

The strength of nuclear science at McMaster was augmented in 1968 under the presidency of Dr. H.G. Thode by the construction of a 10MV Model FN Tandem particle accelerator. The 3MV Model KN single-ended accelerator was added the same year. The academic direction of the laboratory fell to the Physics Department in the early days, as it was primarily a nuclear structure laboratory. During the next 28 years, the nuclear research effort was extensive, with hundreds of graduate students trained and many publications generated.

===Admissions===
The requirements for admission differ between students from Ontario, other provinces in Canada, and international students due to the lack of uniformity in marking schemes. The acceptance rate at McMaster for full-time, first-year applications in 2021 was 61 per cent. In September 2014, the secondary school average for full-time first-year students at McMaster University was 87.7 per cent. The university received 33,195 applicants in 2024.

However, students entering McMaster&#x27;s more selective undergraduate programs, including the Health Sciences, Integrated Sciences, and Arts and Science programs, had a secondary school average of 96.3 per cent. In 2016, Yahoo! Finance named the university&#x27;s Health Sciences program the toughest Canadian undergraduate program to gain admission to, with an acceptance rate of 4.5 per cent out of an average of 3,500 applicants each year.

The Michael DeGroote School of Medicine has notably developed admission tests adopted by other schools. In 2001, they developed the multiple-mini interview to address long-standing concerns over standard panel interviews; viewed as poor reflectors for medical school performance. This format uses short, independent assessments in a timed circuit to obtain aggregate scores in interpersonal skills, professionalism, ethical/moral judgment, and critical thinking to assess candidates. The multiple-mini interview has consistently shown to have a higher predictive validity for future performance than traditional interviews. The multiple-mini interview process has since been adopted by the majority of Canadian medical schools, as well as a number of medical schools in the United States. In 2010, the medical school developed the Computer-based Assessment for Sampling Personal Characteristics, to better assess the applicant&#x27;s personal characteristics. Several other medical schools have adopted the CASPer test, including New York Medical College, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, and the University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine.

==Student life==

In the 2016–2017 academic year, the university had an enrolment of 31,625 students: 26,780 undergraduate students, 4,485 graduate students. The student body is largely made up of Canadians, making up 90.27 per cent of the student population. International students represented, respectively, 9.73 per cent of the student population. Full-time students make up about 93.8 per cent of the student body. Among full-time students, the university has a first-time student retention rate of 90.9 per cent.

===Student groups===

The main student unions on administrative and policy issues are the McMaster Students Union for full-time undergraduates, the McMaster Association of Part-Time Students for part-time undergraduates, and the McMaster Graduate Students Association for postgraduates. In addition, each faculty has its own student representative body. There are more than 300 student organizations and clubs, covering a wide range of interests such as academics, culture, religion, social issues, and recreation. Many of them are centred at McMaster&#x27;s student activity centre. &quot;The Silhouette&quot;, the student-run newspaper, is the oldest student service at McMaster University, in publication since 1929. Since 1968, the McMaster Engineering Society has published &quot;The Plumbline&quot;, the main satire magazine of McMaster University. The campus radio station CFMU-FM (93.3 FM) is Canada&#x27;s second-oldest campus radio station, and has been broadcasting since 1978. MacInsiders, a once-popular online student-run forum and information network, had been operating from 2007 to 2019 and had over 18,000 registered members. The university is also home to the McMaster Improv Team, a drop-in club dedicated to practicing and performing improvisational comedy. The McMaster Artificial Intelligence Society, or Mac AI, was founded in December 2017 and has grown to be one of the largest undergraduate AI organizations in Canada – around 2-3% of the McMaster student population is a general member of the club.

The university hosts a number of honour societies, including the McMaster Honour Society and a chapter of the Golden Key International Honour Society. The university is home to two semi-professional acting companies, McMaster Musical Theatre and the McMaster Thespian Company. The McMaster Engineering Musical is an annual musical production written, directed, and cast by engineers. The production often features unique interpretations of popular songs or musicals. The university and the student unions do not recognize any fraternity or sororities; with existing fraternities and sororities chapters based at McMaster operating as non-accredited off-campus organizations.

===Athletics===
Athletics at McMaster is managed by the university&#x27;s student affairs, under their athletics and recreation department. The university&#x27;s varsity teams compete in the Ontario University Athletics conference of U Sports (formerly called Canadian Interuniversity Sport). The university&#x27;s team sports programs include baseball, basketball, football, lacrosse, rugby, soccer, swimming, volleyball, ringette, and water polo. The first major sport game played at McMaster was in 1889, when a group of alumni from Toronto Baptist College and Woodstock College played an exhibition game against one another, sparking an early intercity rivalry between McMaster students. In 1897 the university placed all physical activity and sports under the jurisdiction of a central executive committee. The varsity teams have been known as the McMaster Marauders since 1948, through a contest run by the student newspaper, The Silhouette, to name the university&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team. In 2016–2017 academic year, McMaster had over 1,100 student-athletes in either varsity or club teams.

The Marauders have won 11 national championships and 139 provincial champions since 1961. The men&#x27;s water polo team has won the Ontario University Athletics championship 25 times, making it the Marauders&#x27; most successful team at the provincial level. The men&#x27;s wrestling team has been the Marauders&#x27; most successful team at the national level, winning the Canadian Interuniversity Sport championship four times. McMaster University has graduated 34 Olympic athletes, eight Olympic coaches, two Olympic administrators and two Olympic officials. As is mandatory for all members of U Sports, McMaster University does not provide full-ride athletic scholarships.

The university&#x27;s sports facilities are in the northeast corner of the main campus. The university has a number of sports facilities, including the David Braley Athletic Centre and the Ron Joyce Stadium. Ron Joyce Stadium includes a full-sized Canadian football field and FIFA-sized soccer pitch. The stadium features permanent seating for 6,000 and temporary seating for an additional 6,000 on the other side of the field when needed. Ron Joyce Stadium is not only used by the university&#x27;s football and soccer varsity teams it is also used as the training camp for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League and as the home stadium for the Hamilton Nationals of Major League Lacrosse.

Intramural sport leagues and tournaments have a high level of participation at McMaster. Opportunities are offered at multiple skill levels and across a variety of sports to service a range of interest and ability. Sports offered include traditional sports like volleyball, basketball, soccer and cricket, as well as less traditional events like dodgeball, inner tube water polo, and extreme potato sack racing.

==Insignias and other representations==
McMaster uses a number of symbols to represent the institution, with the university&#x27;s Office of Public Relations managing the university&#x27;s visual identity. The university&#x27;s present visual identity, and logo was approved by the university senate in 1997. Other symbols utilized by the university includes a flag, unveiled on 29 September 2015, as well as a ceremonial mace. The university mace was bequeathed in 1950 from the graduating class of 1900. Used in ceremonies such as convocation, the mace symbolizes the authority of the university senate to confer degrees. The university also uses several tag lines as a part of its overall branding effort. As of 2007, the branding tag line used by the university is &quot;Learning Without Borders,&quot; although the previous tag line, &quot;Inspire, Innovation, and Discovery,&quot; is still used to a limited extent. 
In addition to the visual representations of the institution, the university&#x27;s individual departments, faculties, and schools also employ symbols to visually represent them. One such example is the Faculty of Engineering&#x27;s fireball emblem, adopted by the faculty in 1960. The fireball was adopted from the coat of arms of the defunct Hamilton College.

===Motto and songs===
The university&#x27;s motto, chosen from Colossians 1:17, is . The motto, adopted in 1888, is Greek for &quot;In Christ all things consist&quot;. The McMaster motto is unusual in that it employs Greek instead of Latin or English. The use of Latin reflects the origin of universities in mediaeval institutions in which Latin was more prominent than Greek. McMaster&#x27;s founders desired to go back beyond the Middle Ages to the earliest days of the Christian faith, and therefore used the Greek form.

Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement and convocation, and athletic games are &quot;The Alma Mater Song&quot; (1935), with words by Mrs. A.A. Burridge and music by Hugh Brearly; &quot;Shout for McMaster! (The McMaster March)&quot;, with words by Claire Senior Burke et al., and music by Arthur Burridge; and &quot;My Mac&quot; (1982), with words and music by Fred Moyes. Specifically, &quot;Shout for McMaster!&quot; is recognized as the university&#x27;s fight song.

===Coat of arms===

After the university moved to Hamilton in 1930, the university petitioned Lord Lyon King of Arms in Edinburgh for a coat of arms. The request was granted on behalf of The Crown on 20 October 1930. In 1997, the board of governors introduced a simplified shield design, which recognized the tradition of McMaster&#x27;s heraldry while improving the quality of print and electronic reproduction. The university&#x27;s arms and badge was registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on 15 October 2006.

The coat of arms consists of a shield, a crest, and a motto, together with a helmet. The shield contains an eagle, symbolic of the heavenly vision, with a cross on its breast to indicate Christianity as the inspiration for the university&#x27;s vision. The chief of the shield bears an open book, a common symbol of learning. A golden maple leaf is situated on each side of the book, signifying the university&#x27;s charter was granted by the Province of Ontario. The helmet, above the shield, has the open visor and forward-facing style typically used by universities. The mantling surrounding the shield and helmet represents the cloak worn over a knight&#x27;s armour as protection from the sun. The crest, above the helmet, is a stag and oak tree, which serves as a tribute to the Canadian senator, William McMaster, who also used a stag and oak on his insignias. The motto is above the crest, as is common in Scottish heraldry.
