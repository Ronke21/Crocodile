<text>Juvenile delinquency, also known as juvenile offending, is the act of participating in unlawful behavior as a minor or individual younger than the statutory age of majority. These acts would be considered crimes if the individuals committing them were older. The term delinquent usually refers to juvenile delinquency, and is also generalised to refer to a young person who behaves an unacceptable way.

In the United States, a juvenile delinquent is a person who commits a crime and is under a specific age. Most states specify a juvenile delinquent, or young offender, as an individual under 18 years of age while a few states have set the maximum age slightly different. The term &quot;juvenile delinquent&quot; originated from the late 18th and early 19th centuries when treatment of juvenile and adult criminals was similar and punishment was over the seriousness of an offense. Before the 18th century, juveniles over age 7 were tried in the same criminal court as adults and, if convicted, could get the death penalty. Illinois established the first juvenile court. This juvenile court focused on treatment objectives instead of punishment, determined appropriate terminology associated with juvenile offenders, and made juvenile records confidential. In 2021, Michigan, New York, and Vermont raised the maximum age to under 19, and Vermont law was updated again in 2022 to include individuals under the age of 20. Only three states, Georgia, Texas, and Wisconsin, still appropriate the age of a juvenile delinquent as someone under the age of 17. While the maximum age in some US states has increased, Japan has lowered the juvenile delinquent age from under 20 to under 18. This change occurred on 1 April 2022 when the Japanese Diet activated a law lowering the age of minor status in the country. Just as there are differences in the maximum age of a juvenile delinquent, the minimum age for a child to be considered capable of delinquency or the age of criminal responsibility varies considerably between the states. Some states that impose a minimum age have made recent amendments to raise the minimum age, but most states remain ambiguous on the minimum age for a child to be determined a juvenile delinquent. In 2021, North Carolina changed the minimum age from 6 years old to 10 years old while Connecticut moved from 7 to 10 and New York made an adjustment from 7 to 12. In some states the minimum age depends on the seriousness of the crime committed. Juvenile delinquents or juvenile offenders commit crimes ranging from status offenses such as, truancy, violating a curfew or underage drinking and smoking to more serious offenses categorized as property crimes, violent crimes, sexual offenses, and cybercrimes.

Some scholars have found an increase in arrests for youth and have concluded that this may reflect more aggressive criminal justice and zero-tolerance policies rather than changes in youth behavior. Youth violence rates in the United States have dropped to approximately 12% of peak rates in 1993 according to official US government statistics, suggesting that most juvenile offending is non-violent. Many delinquent acts can be attributed to the environmental factors such as family behavior or peer influence. One contributing factor that has gained attention in recent years is the school to prison pipeline. According to Diverse Education, nearly 75% of states have built more jails and prisons than colleges. CNN also provides a diagram that shows that cost per inmate is significantly higher in most states than cost per student. This shows that tax payers&#x27; dollars are going toward providing for prisoners rather than providing for the educational system and promoting the advancement of education. For every school that is built, the focus on punitive punishment has been seen to correlate with juvenile delinquency rates. Some have suggested shifting from zero tolerance policies to restorative justice approaches.

Juvenile detention centers, juvenile courts and electronic monitoring are common structures of the juvenile legal system. Juvenile courts are in place to address offenses for minors as civil rather than criminal cases in most instances. The frequency of use and structure of these courts in the United States varies by state. Depending on the type and severity of the offense committed, it is possible for people under 18 to be charged and treated as adults.

==Overview==
Juvenile delinquency, or offending, is often separated into three categories:
* delinquency, crimes committed by minors, which are dealt with by the juvenile courts and justice system;
* criminal behavior, crimes dealt with by the criminal justice system;
*status offenses, offenses that are only classified as such because only a minor can commit them. One example of this is possession of alcohol by a minor. These offenses are also dealt with by the juvenile courts.

Currently, there is not an agency whose jurisdiction is tracking worldwide juvenile delinquency but UNICEF estimates that over one million children are in some type of detention globally. Many countries do not keep records of the amount of delinquent or detained minors but of the ones that do, the United States has the highest number of juvenile delinquency cases. In the United States, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention compiles data concerning trends in juvenile delinquency. According to their most recent publication, 7 in 1000 juveniles in the US committed a serious crime in 2016. A serious crime is defined by the US Department of Justice as one of the following eight offenses: murder and non-negligent homicide, rape (legacy &amp; revised), robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, larceny-theft, and arson. According to research compiled by James Howell in 2009, the arrest rate for juveniles has been dropping consistently since its peak in 1994. Of the cases for juvenile delinquency that make it through the court system, probation is the most common consequence and males account for over 70% of the caseloads.

According to developmental research by Moffitt (2006), there are two different types of offenders that emerge in adolescence. The first is an age specific offender, referred to as the adolescence-limited offender, for whom juvenile offending or delinquency begins and ends during their period of adolescence. Moffitt argues that most teenagers tend to show some form of antisocial or delinquent behavior during adolescence, it is therefore important to account for these behaviors in childhood in order to determine whether they will be adolescence-limited offenders or something more long term. The other type of offender is the repeat offender, referred to as the life-course-persistent offender, who begins offending or showing antisocial/aggressive behavior in adolescence (or even in childhood) and continues into adulthood.

==Situational factors==
Most of influencing factors for juvenile delinquency tend to be caused by a mix of both genetic and environmental factors. According to Laurence Steinberg&#x27;s book &quot;Adolescence&quot;, the two largest predictors of juvenile delinquency are parenting style and peer group association. Additional factors that may lead a teenager into juvenile delinquency include poor or low,
socioeconomic status, poor school readiness/performance and/or failure and peer rejection. Delinquent activity, especially the involvement in youth gangs, may also be caused by a desire for protection against violence or financial hardship. Juvenile offenders can view delinquent activity as a means of gaining access to resources to protect against such threats. Research by Carrie Dabb indicates that even changes in the weather can increase the likelihood of children exhibiting deviant behavior.

==Family environment==
:Family factors that may have an influence on offending include: the level of parental supervision, the way parents discipline a child, parental conflict or separation, criminal activity by parents or siblings, parental abuse or neglect, and the quality of the parent-child relationship. As mentioned above, parenting style is not of the largest predictors of juvenile delinquency. There are 4 categories of parenting styles which describe the attitudes and behaviors that parents express while raising their children.
:* Authoritative parenting is characterized by warmth and support in addition to discipline.
:* Indulgent parenting is characterized by warmth and regard towards their children but lack structure and discipline.
:*Authoritarian parenting is characterized by high discipline without the warmth thus leading to often hostile demeanor and harsh correction
:*Neglectful parenting is both non responsive and non demanding. The child is not engaged either affectionately or disciplinary by the parent.

According to research done by Laura E. Berk, the style of parenting that would be most beneficial for a child, based on studies conducted by Diana Baumrind(1971) is the authoritative child-rearing style because it combines acceptance with discipline to render healthy development for the child.

As concluded in Steinberg&#x27;s &quot;Adolescence&quot;, children brought up by single parents are more likely to live in poverty and engage in delinquent behavior than those who live with both parents. However, according to research done by Graham and Bowling, once the attachment a child feels towards their parent(s) and the level of parental supervision are taken into account, children in single parent families are no more likely to offend than others. It was seen that when a child has low parental supervision they are much more likely to offend. Negative peer group association is more likely when adolescents are left unsupervised. A lack of supervision is also connected to poor relationships between children and parents. Children who are often in conflict with their parents may be less willing to discuss their activities with them. Conflict between a child&#x27;s parents is also much more closely linked to offending than being raised by a lone parent.

Adolescents with siblings who have committed crimes are more likely to be influenced by their siblings and become delinquent if the sibling is older, of the same sex/gender, and maintains a good relationship with the child. Cases where a younger criminal sibling influences an older one are rare. An aggressive more hostile sibling is less likely to influence a younger sibling in the direction of delinquency, if anything, the more strained the relationship between the siblings, the less they will want to be influence each other.

Children resulting from unintended pregnancies are more likely to exhibit delinquent behavior. They also have lower mother-child relationship quality.

===Peer influence===
Peer rejection in childhood is also a large predictor of juvenile delinquency. This rejection can affect the child&#x27;s ability to be socialized properly and often leads them to gravitate towards anti-social peer groups. Association with anti-social groups often leads to the promotion of violent, aggressive and deviant behavior. Robert Vargas&#x27;s &quot;Being in &#x27;Bad&#x27; Company,&quot; explains that adolescents who can choose between groups of friends are less susceptible to peer influence that could lead them to commit illegal acts. Aggressive adolescents who have been rejected by peers are also more likely to have a &quot;hostile attribution bias&quot;, which leads people to interpret the actions of others (whether they be hostile or not) as purposefully hostile and aggressive towards them. This often leads to an impulsive and aggressive reaction.

Conformity plays a significant role in the vast impact that peer group influence has on an individual. Aronson, Wilson, &amp; Akert (2013) point to the research experiment conducted by Solomon Asch (1956), to ascertain whether a group could influence an individual&#x27;s behavior. The experiment was executed by asking a participant determine which line in the set of 3 lines matched the length of an original line. Confederates knew the purpose of the experiment and were directed to answer the questions incorrectly during certain phases of the experiment. These confederates answered the question before the participant. The confederates answered the first few questions correctly, as did the participant. Eventually, all of the confederates started to answer incorrectly. The purpose of the experiment was to see if the group would influence the participant to answer incorrectly. Asch found that seventy-six percent of the participants conformed and answered incorrectly when influenced by the group. According to these findings, it was concluded that a peer group that is involved in deviant behavior can influence an adolescent to engage in similar activities. Once the adolescent becomes part of the group, they will be susceptible to groupthink.

===School to prison pipeline===
A common contributor to juvenile delinquency rates is a phenomenon referred to as the school to prison pipeline. In recent years, school disciplinary measures have become increasingly policed. According to one study, 67% of high school students attend schools with police officers. This rise in police presence is often attributed to the implementation of zero tolerance policies. Based on the &quot;broken windows&quot; theory of criminology and the Gun-Free Schools Act, zero tolerance policies stress the use of specific, consistent, and harsh punishment to deal with in school infractions. Often measures such as suspension or expulsion are assigned to students who deviant regardless of the reason or past disciplinary history. This use of punishment often has been linked with increasing high school drop out rates and future arrests. It was found in a 2018 study that students who received a suspension were less likely to graduate and more likely to be arrested or on probation. As stated in research by Matthew Theriot, the increased police presence in school and use of tougher punishment methods leads student actions to be criminalized and in turn referred to juvenile justice systems.

The Center on Youth Justice at the Vera Institute of Justice found that &quot;for similar students attending similar schools, a single suspension or expulsion doubles the risk that a student will repeat a grade. Being retained a grade, especially while in middle or high school, is one of the strongest predictors of dropping out. In a national longitudinal study, it was reported that youth with a prior suspension were 68% more likely to dropout of school.

The school to prison pipeline disproportionately affects minority students. According to data compiled by the United States Government Accountability Office, 39% of students who received a suspension in the 2013–14 school year were Black, even though Black students accounted for only about 15% of public school students. This over-representation applied to both boys and girls of African descent. Compared to White students, Black students were expelled or suspended 3 times as frequently.

==Personality factors==
Juvenile delinquency is the unlawful activities by minors in their teen or pre-teen years. It is influenced by four main risk factors, namely: personality, background, state of mind and drugs.

===Gender===
Gender is another risk factor in regards to influencing delinquent behavior. The predictors of different types of delinquency vary across females and males for various reasons, but a common underlying reason for this is socialization. Different predictors of delinquency emerge when analyzing distinct offending types across gender, but overall it is evident that males commit more crimes than females. Across all offenses, females are less likely to be involved in delinquent acts than males. Females not only commit fewer offenses, but they also commit less serious offenses.

Socialization plays a key role in the gender gap in delinquency because male and female juveniles are often socialized differently. Girls&#x27; and boys&#x27; experiences are heavily mediated by gender, which alters their interactions in society. Males and females are differently controlled and bonded, suggesting that they will not make the same choices and may follow different paths of delinquency. Social bonds are important for both males and females, but different aspects of the bond are relevant for each gender. The degree of involvement in social settings is a significant predictor of male&#x27;s violent delinquency, but is not significant for females. Males tend to be more connected with their peer relationships which in effect has a stronger influence on their behavior. Association with delinquent peers is one of the strongest correlates of juvenile delinquency, and much of the gender gap can be accounted for by the fact that males are more likely to have friends that support delinquent behavior. Delinquent peers are positively and significantly related to delinquency in males but delinquent peers are negatively and insignificantly related to delinquency for females. As for females, familial functioning relationships have shown to be more important. Female juveniles tend to be more strongly connected with their families, the disconnect or the lack of socialization between their family members can significantly predict their likelihood of committing crimes as juveniles and even as adults. When the family is disrupted, females are more likely to engage in delinquent behavior than males. Boys, however, tend to be less connected to their family and are not as affected by these relationships. When it comes to minor offenses such as fighting, vandalism, shoplifting, and the carrying of weapons, differences in gender are limited because they are most common among both males as well as females. Elements of the social bond, social disorganization, routine activities, opportunity, and attitudes towards violence are also related to delinquent behavior among both males and females.

===Neurological===
Individual psychological or behavioral risk factors that may make offending more likely include low intelligence, impulsiveness or the inability to delay gratification, aggression, lack of empathy, and restlessness. Other risk factors that may be evident during childhood and adolescence include, aggressive or troublesome behavior, language delays or impairments, lack of emotional control (learning to control one&#x27;s anger), and cruelty to animals.

Children with low intelligence are more likely to do badly in school. This may increase the chances of offending because low educational attainment, a low attachment to school, and low educational aspirations are all risk factors for offending in themselves. Children who perform poorly at school are also more likely to be truant, and the status offense of truancy is linked to further offending.

Impulsiveness is seen by some as the key aspect of a child&#x27;s personality that predicts offending. However, it is not clear whether these aspects of personality are a result of &quot;deficits in the executive functions of the brain&quot; or a result of parental influences or other social factors. In any event, studies of adolescent development show that teenagers are more prone to risk-taking, which may explain the high disproportionate rate of offending among adolescents.

===Psychological===
Juvenile delinquents are often diagnosed with different disorders. Around six to sixteen percent of male teens and two to nine percent of female teens have a conduct disorder. These can vary from oppositional-defiant disorder, which is not necessarily aggressive, to antisocial personality disorder, often diagnosed among psychopaths. A conduct disorder can develop during childhood and then manifest itself during adolescence.

Juvenile delinquents who have recurring encounters with the criminal justice system, or in other words those who are life-course-persistent offenders, are sometimes diagnosed with conduct disorders because they show a continuous disregard for their own and others safety and/or property. Once the juvenile continues to exhibit the same behavioral patterns and turns eighteen he is then at risk of being diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder and much more prone to become a serious criminal offender. One of the main components used in diagnosing an adult with antisocial personality disorder consists of presenting documented history of conduct disorder before the age of 15. These two personality disorders are analogous in their erratic and aggressive behavior. This is why habitual juvenile offenders diagnosed with conduct disorder are likely to exhibit signs of antisocial personality disorder early in life and then as they mature. Some times these juveniles reach maturation and they develop into career criminals, or life-course-persistent offenders. &quot;Career criminals begin committing antisocial behavior before entering grade school and are versatile in that they engage in an array of destructive behaviors, offend at exceedingly high rates, and are less likely to quit committing crime as they age.&quot;

Quantitative research was completed on 9,945 juvenile male offenders between the ages of 10 and 18 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the 1970s. The longitudinal birth cohort was used to examine a trend among a small percentage of career criminals who accounted for the largest percentage of crime activity. The trend exhibited a new phenomenon among habitual offenders. The phenomenon indicated that only 6% of the youth qualified under their definition of a habitual offender (known today as life-course persistent offenders, or career criminals) and yet were responsible for 52% of the delinquency within the entire study. The same 6% of chronic offenders accounted for 71% of the murders and 69% of the aggravated assaults. This phenomenon was later researched among an adult population in 1977 and resulted in similar findings. S. A. Mednick did a birth cohort of 30,000 males and found that 1% of the males were responsible for more than half of the criminal activity. The habitual crime behavior found among juveniles is similar to that of adults. As stated before most life-course persistent offenders begin exhibiting antisocial, violent, and/or delinquent behavior, prior to adolescence. Therefore, while there is a high rate of juvenile delinquency, it is the small percentage of life-course persistent, career criminals that are responsible for most of the violent crimes.

==Criminology==
There are a multitude of different theories on the causes of crime (criminology) most, if not all, of which are applicable to the causes of juvenile delinquency.

===Rational choice===
Classical criminology stresses that the causes of crime lie within individual offenders, rather than in their external environment. For classicists, offenders are motivated by rational , and the importance of free will and personal responsibility is emphasized. Rational choice theory is the clearest example of that idea. Delinquency is one of the major factors motivated by rational choice.

===Social disorganization===
Current positivist approaches generally focus on the culture. A type of criminological theory attributing variation in crime and delinquency over time and among territories to the absence or breakdown of communal institutions (such as family, school, church, and social groups) and communal relationships that traditionally encouraged cooperative relationships among people.

===Strain===
Strain theory is associated mainly with the work of Robert K. Merton, who felt that there are institutionalized paths to success in society. Strain theory holds that crime is caused by the difficulty for those in poverty have to achieve socially-valued goals by legitimate means. Since those with, for instance, poor educational attainment have difficulty achieving wealth and status by securing well-paid employment, they are more likely to use criminal means to obtain those goals.
Merton&#x27;s suggests five adaptations to this dilemma:
# &quot;Innovation&quot;: individuals who accept socially-approved goals but not necessarily the socially-approved means.
# &quot;Retreatism&quot;: those who reject socially-approved goals and the means for acquiring them.
# &quot;Ritualism&quot;: those who buy into a system of socially-approved means but lose sight of the goals. Merton believed that drug users are in this category.
# &quot;Conformity&quot;: those who conform to the system&#x27;s means and goals.
# &quot;Rebellion&quot;: people who negate socially-approved goals and means by creating a new system of acceptable goals and means.

A difficulty with strain theory is that it does not explore why children of low-income families have poor educational attainment in the first place. More importantly, much youth crime does not have an economic motivation. Strain theory fails to explain violent crime, the type of youth crime that causes most anxiety to the public.

===Differential association===
Differential association is another theory that deals with young people in a group context and looks at how peer pressure and the existence of gangs could lead them into crime. It suggests young people are motivated to commit crimes by delinquent peers and learn criminal skills from them. The diminished influence of peers after men marry has also been cited as a factor in desisting from offending. There is strong evidence that young people with criminal friends are more likely to commit crimes themselves. However, offenders may prefer to associate with one another, rather than delinquent peers causing someone to start offending. Furthermore, there is the question of how the delinquent peer group initially became delinquent.

===Labeling===
Labeling theory is a concept in criminology that aims to explain deviant behavior from the social context, rather the individual themselves. It is part of interactionism criminology, which states that once young people have been labeled as criminal, they are more likely to offend. The idea is that once labelled as deviant, a young person may accept that role and be more likely to associate with others who have been similarly labeled. Labelling theorists say that male children from poor families are more likely to be labelled deviant, which may partially explain the existence of more working-class young male offenders.

===Social control===
Social control theory proposes that exploiting the process of socialization and social learning builds self-control and can reduce the inclination to indulge in behavior that is recognized as antisocial. These four types of control can help prevent juvenile delinquency:

Direct by which punishment is threatened or applied for wrongful behavior, and compliance is rewarded by parents, family, and authority figures.
Internal by which a youth refrains from delinquency through the conscience or superego.
Indirect by identification with those who influence behavior, such as because the delinquent act might cause pain and disappointment to parents and others close relationships.
Control through needs satisfaction: if all an individual&#x27;s needs are met, there is no point in criminal activity.

==Punishment==
In 2020 a ruling abolished the death penalty for juveniles in Saudi Arabia. Despite this Mustafa Hashem al-Darwish was executed in June 2021. He was alleged to have of taken part in anti-government demonstrations at the age of 17. al-Darwish had been detained in May 2015 being placed in solitary confinement for years. al-Darwish claimed that he faced brutal torture and beatings and was forced to sign confessions.

One criminal justice approach to juvenile delinquency is through the juvenile court systems. These courts are specifically for minors to be tried in. Sometimes, juvenile offenders are sent to adult prisons. In the United States, children as young as 8 can be tried and convicted as adults. Additionally, the United States was the only recorded country to sentence children as young as 13 to life sentences without parole also known as death in prison sentences. As of 2012, the Supreme Court has declared death in prison sentences unconstitutional for the vast majority of cases involving children. According to the US Department of Justice, about 3,600 children are housed in adult jails.

According to a report released by the Prison Policy Initiative, over 48,000 children are held in juvenile detention centers or prisons in America. The worldwide number is unknown but UNICEF estimates that over 1 million children experience confinement in various countries. Juveniles in youth detention centers are sometimes subject to many of the same punishments as adults, such as solitary confinement, despite a younger age or the presence of disabilities. Due to the influx of minors in detention facilities due to the school to prison pipeline, education is increasingly becoming a concern. Children in juvenile detention have a compromised or nonexistent schooling which to a higher number of drop outs and failure to complete secondary education.

==Prevention==
Delinquency prevention is the broad term for all efforts aimed at preventing youth from becoming involved in criminal, or other antisocial, activity. Prevention services may include activities such as substance abuse education and treatment, family counseling, youth mentoring, parenting education, educational support, and youth sheltering. Increasing availability and use of family planning services, including education and contraceptives helps to reduce unintended pregnancy and unwanted births, which are risk factors for delinquency. It has been noted that often interventions such as peer groups may leave at-risk children worse off than if there had never been an intervention.

===Policies===
Education promotes economic growth, national productivity and innovation, and values of democracy and social cohesion. Prevention through education has been seen to discourage delinquency for minors and help them strengthen the connection and understanding between peers

A well-known intervention treatment is the Scared Straight Treatment. According to research done by Scott Lilienfeld, this type of intervention is often harmful because of juvenile offenders&#x27; vicarious exposure to criminal role models and the possibility of increased resentment in reaction to the confrontational interactions. It has been reasoned that the most efficient interventions are those that not only separate at-risk teens from anti-social peers, and place them instead with pro-social ones, but also simultaneously improve their home environment by training parents with appropriate parenting styles.

In response to the data correlated with the school to prison pipeline, some institutions have implemented restorative justice policies. The restorative justice approach emphasizes conflict resolution and non-punitive intervention. Interventions such as hiring more counselors as opposed to security professionals or focusing on talking through problems would be included in a restorative justice approach.

It is also important to note certain works of legislation that have already been published in the United States in response to general prisoner re-entry, extending to juveniles, such as the Second Chance Act (2007) and most recently, the Second Chance Reauthorization Act (2018).

===Juvenile reform===
Juvenile reform deals with the vocational programs and educational approach to reducing recidivism rates of juvenile offenders. Most countries in the world legislate processes for juvenile reform and re-entry, some more elaborate and formal than others. In theory, juvenile re-entry is sensitive to the fact that juveniles are young and assumes they are capable of change; it approaches a juvenile offender&#x27;s situation and history holistically, evaluating the earlier factors that could lead a juvenile to commit crimes. In practice, this is complicated since juvenile delinquents return home to varying and unpredictable circumstances, including poverty, substance abuse, domestic violence, etc..

In the United States, juvenile reform is split into four main phases:

# The Entry Phase: The youth enters residential placement
# The Placement Phase: Amount of time youth is in the placement facility (whatever that may be)
# The Transitional Phase (re-entry): Act of leaving facility and entering community (from right after exit of facility to right before entering community)
# The Community-based Aftercare Phase: Period of time after youth returns to the community (usually 120-day period right after transitional phase)

An understanding of the factors involved in each of these steps is crucial to creating an effective juvenile reform program. One non-profit identifies the following approaches to juvenile reform:

# Early Intervention: preventing juvenile youth from ever encountering the justice system by implementation of conflict-resolution practices or administrative strategies that aim to teach the child healthy actions to take in difficult situations. It is implemented before any offense is committed and often involves a thorough discussion of what individual issues a child is dealing with.
# Diversion: the placement of youth in programs that redirect youth away from juvenile justice system processing, or programs that divert youth from secure detention in a juvenile justice facility. These programs are most often in attempt to protect juveniles from getting a charge on their record after they have already committed a crime. This can be led through school administration intervention or by law enforcement officers that have been trained in dealing with at-risk youth. These programs are often given to children who have unstable life circumstances and are thus extended aid that will attack the &quot;root problems&quot; rather than further isolate them in society.
# Alternatives to Secure Confinement: a juvenile justice approach that does not require the juvenile&#x27;s entry in a &quot;jail-like&quot; facility. Often involves the juvenile&#x27;s continued participation in society, but in a modified manner. Such alternatives include home confinement, supervision of a probation officer, community service requirements, and community-based facilities, among others.
# Evidence-Based Practices: the emphasis on encouraging youth participation in programs that have evidence of working. The evaluation of &quot;success&quot; for a program is dependent on multiple factors, such as reduction of recidivism rates, cost-effectiveness, and addressing health problems.
# Diverting Youth Who Commit Status Offenses: programs that address the &quot;root&quot; problems causing a juvenile&#x27;s behavior and actions. Such programs are often part of a tiered approach to juvenile justice and reform.
# Funding Community-Based Alternatives on a Large Scale: the supporting of all initiatives in a community that have been proven to help with juvenile betterment and reform. This allows the community to help its own and does not rely on the decisions of the state regarding the needs of juveniles.

While juvenile reform has proved to be an effective and humanizing approach response to juvenile delinquency, it is a very complex area that still has many ongoing debates. For example, many countries around the world are debating the appropriate age of a juvenile, as well as trying to understand whether there are some crimes that are so heinous, they should be exempt from any understanding. Based on these discussions, legislation needs to be consistently updated and considered as social, cultural, and political landscapes change.

==Juvenile sex crimes==
Juveniles who commit sexual crimes refer to individuals adjudicated in a criminal court for a sexual crime. Sex crimes are defined as sexually abusive behavior committed by a person under the age of 18 that is perpetrated &quot;against the victim&#x27;s will, without consent, and in an aggressive, exploitative, manipulative, and/or threatening manner&quot;. It is important to utilize appropriate terminology for juvenile sex offenders. Harsh and inappropriate expressions include terms such as &quot;pedophile, child molester, predator, perpetrator, and mini-perp&quot;. These terms have often been associated with this group, regardless of the youth&#x27;s age, diagnosis, cognitive abilities, or developmental stage. Using appropriate expressions can facilitate a more accurate depiction of juvenile sex offenders and may decrease the subsequent aversive psychological affects from using such labels. In the Arab Gulf states, homosexual acts are classified as an offense, and constitute one of the primary crimes for which juvenile males are charged.

===Prevalence data===
Examining prevalence data and the characteristics of juvenile sex offenders is a fundamental component to obtain a precise understanding of this heterogeneous group. With mandatory reporting laws in place, it became a necessity for providers to report any incidents of disclosed sexual abuse. Longo and Prescott indicate that juveniles commit approximately 30-60% of all child sexual abuse. The Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Reports indicate that in 2008 youth under the age of 18 accounted for 16.7% of forcible rapes and 20.61% of other sexual offenses. Center for Sex Offender Management indicates that approximately one-fifth of all rapes and one-half of all sexual child molestation can be accounted for by juveniles.

===Official record data===
The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention indicates that 15% of juvenile arrests occurred for rape in 2006, and 12% were clearance (resolved by an arrest). The total number of juvenile arrests in 2006 for forcible rape was 3,610 with 2% being female and 36% being under the age of 15 years. This trend has declined throughout the years with forcible rape from 1997–2006 being −30% and from 2005 to 2006 being −10%. The OJJDP reports that the juvenile arrest rate for forcible rape increased from the early 1980s through the 1990s and at that time it fell again. Violent crime rates in the U.S. have been on a steady decline since the 1990s. The OJJDP also reported that the total number of juvenile arrests in 2006 for sex offenses (other than forcible rape) was 15,900 with 10% being female and 47% being under the age of 15. There was again a decrease with the trend throughout the years with sex offenses from 1997 to 2006 being −16% and from 2005 to 2006 being −9%.

===Males who commit sexual crimes===
Barbaree and Marshall indicate that juvenile males contribute to the majority of sex crimes, with 2–4% of adolescent males having reported committing sexually assaultive behavior, and 20% of all rapes and 30–50% of all child molestation are perpetrated by adolescent males. It is clear that males are over-represented in this population. This is consistent with Ryan and Lane&#x27;s research indicating that males account for 91-93% of the reported juvenile sex offenses. Righthand and Welch reported that females account for an estimated 2–11% of incidents of sexual offending. In addition, it reported by The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention that in the juvenile arrests during 2006, African American male youth were disproportionately arrested (34%) for forcible rape. In one case in a foster home a 13-year-old boy raped a 9-year-old boy by having forced anal sex with him. In a court hearing the 9-year-old boy said he had done this multiple times. The 13-year-old boy was charged for sexual assault.

===Juvenile sex crimes internationally===
Sexual crimes committed by juveniles are not just an issue in the United States. Studies from the Netherlands show that out of 3,200 sex offenders recorded by police in 2009, 672 of those were juveniles, approximately 21 percent of sexual offenders. The study also points out the male to female ratio of sexual predators.

In 2009, a U.S. congressman proposed legislation that would create an International Sex Offender Registry. The bill was introduced due to the fact that because laws differ in different countries, someone who is on the sex offender registry in the U.S. who may be barred from living certain places and doing certain activities has free range in other less developed countries. This can lead to child sex tourism, when a sexual predator will go to less developed countries and prey on young boys and girls. Karne Newburn in his article, The Prospect of an International Sex Offender Registry, pointed out some serious flaws in the proposed bill, such as creating safety issues within the communities for the sex offenders placed on the registry. Newburn suggested instead of creating an International Sex Offender Registry from the U.S. model the U.S. join other countries in a dialogue on creating an effective model. As of now no registry exists. Despite this there is still interest in creating some sort of international registry.

==By country==
===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom has three separate and distinct criminal justice systems: England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. Young offenders are often dealt with by the Youth Offending Team. There is concern young adult offenders are not getting the support they need to help them avoid reoffending.

In England and Wales the age of criminal responsibility is set at 10. Young offenders aged 10 to 17 (i.e. up to their 18th birthday) are classed as a juvenile offender. Between the ages of 18 and 20 (i.e. up to their 21st birthday) they are classed as young offenders. Offenders aged 21 and over are known as adult offenders. 

In Scotland the age of criminal responsibility was formerly set at 8, one of the lowest ages of criminal responsibility in Europe. It has since been raised to 12 by the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010, which received Royal Assent on 6 August 2010.

In Northern Ireland, the age of criminal responsibility is 10.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the YCJA protects the rights of young offenders. It has four main goals to ensure the youth is subject to meaningful consequences that promote the long-term protection of society, to rehabilitate and reintegrate the youth into society seamlessly, and to prevent crime by examining the underlying causes. The YCJA was introduced in 2003, succeeding the Young Offender&#x27;s Act.

===Northern Europe===
In Sweden, the age of criminal responsibility is set at 15 since 1902.

=== United States ===
In the United States, the age of criminal responsibility for federal crimes is set at 11. While this has been set at the federal level, each state is responsible for setting their own age of criminal responsibility. Thirty-one states have no minimum age for criminal responsibility, while the remaining 19 do. North Carolina has the lowest responsibility age of 6 years old and Massachusetts has the highest of 12 years old.

There are 1.5 million cases per year in the US that handle status offenses or criminal offenses by young offenders. However, only 52 juveniles were fully sentenced to prison-time between 2010–2015. Recidivism is common among young offenders, with 67% becoming repeat offenders.

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, the age of criminal responsibility is set at the age of 18. Anyone that is found guilty of committing crimes prior to the age of 18 is treated to other options rather than jail. These include, for children under 12, foster care options in order to get them a safer family, and, for young offenders over 12, being sentenced to complying with a range of socio-educative measures that can go from a warning to community work and even to internment in specialized facilities, which include basic schooling and occupational training courses that aim at preventing the offenders from resorting to crime to support themselves, although conditions in such facilities are often subpar. With a spike in crime rates among young offenders occurring in 2015, along with an almost 40% increase in internments of young offenders, there was a push to lower the age of criminal responsibility to 16, which ultimately failed.

=== China ===
Juvenile crime has risen in China with an average increase of 5% per year. In 2021, China lowered the age of criminal responsibility from 14 to 12 in an amendment to its , and it mandated that such prosecution must be approved by the Supreme People&#x27;s Procuratorate.

<text>Melanthiaceae, also called the bunchflower family, is a family of flowering herbaceous perennial plants native to the Northern Hemisphere. Along with many other lilioid monocots, early authors considered members of this family to belong to the family Liliaceae, in part because both their sepals and petals closely resemble each other and are often large and showy like those of lilies, while some more recent taxonomists have placed them in a family Trilliaceae. The most authoritative modern treatment, however, the APG III system of 2009 (unchanged from the 2003 APG II system and the 1998 APG system), places the family in the order Liliales, in the clade monocots. Circumscribed in this way, the family includes up to 17 genera.

Familiar members of the family include the genera &quot;Paris&quot; and &quot;Trillium&quot;.


== Genera and species ==
, the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families accepted 17 genera in the family. They have been divided into five tribes. It has a total of ca 173 known species. Generic assignments within the tribe Melanthieae in particular have been changed radically as a result of molecular phylogenetic studies in the 21st century. Some taxonomists have combined the three genera of Heloniadae into one genus (&quot;Helonias&quot;).

;Heloniadeae

<text>Alessandro &quot;Alex&quot; Zanardi (; born 23 October 1966) is an Italian professional racing driver and paracyclist. He won the CART championship in 1997 and 1998, and took 15 wins in the series. He also raced in Formula One from 1991 to 1994 and again in 1999; his best result was a sixth-place finish in the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix. He returned to CART in 2001, but a major crash in the 2001 American Memorial resulted in the amputation of his legs. He returned to racing less than two years after the accident, competing in the European Touring Car Championship in 2003–2004 and then in the World Touring Car Championship between 2005 and 2009; he scored four wins.

In addition to continuing to race cars, Zanardi took up competition in handcycling, a form of paralympic cycling, with the stated goal of representing Italy at the 2012 Summer Paralympics. In September 2011, Zanardi won his first senior international handcycling medal, the silver medal in the H4 category time trial at the UCI World Road Para-Cycling Championships. In September 2012 he won gold medals at the London Paralympics in the individual H4 time trial and the individual H4 road race, followed by a silver medal in the mixed H1-4 team relay, and in September 2016 he won a gold and a silver medal at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Paralympics.

On 19 June 2020, Zanardi was involved in a serious road accident while competing in the Obiettivo tricolore handcycling race, near Siena. After being transferred to hospital, Zanardi underwent three hours of neurosurgery and maxillofacial surgery before being placed in a medically induced coma.

==Early life==
Alex Zanardi was born in Bologna, Italy on 23 October 1966, son of Dino and Anna Zanardi. His family moved to the town of Castel Maggiore on the city&#x27;s outskirts when he was four years of age. His sister Cristina was a promising swimmer prior to her death in an automobile collision in 1979.

Zanardi began racing karts at age 13. He built his kart from the wheels of a dustbin and pipes from his father&#x27;s work. In 1988, he joined the Italian Formula 3 series, with a fifth place as his highest finish. In 1989, Zanardi took two pole positions and three podiums despite his team&#x27;s switching to unleaded fuel, which reduced his car&#x27;s engine power. In 1991, he moved up to the Formula 3000 series with the Il Barone Rampante team, themselves newcomers to the series. He won his F3000 debut race, scoring two more wins that season and finishing second in the championship.

==Motor racing==
===Formula One (1991–1994)===
After testing for the Footwork team, Zanardi mounted a strong season in F3000. Eddie Jordan looked to replace Roberto Moreno for the remainder of the 1991 season, bringing in Zanardi for the last three races. Zanardi finished two of them, both in 9th place. In , however, Zanardi had to be content with guest drives for Minardi, replacing the injured Christian Fittipaldi. In the off-season, he tested for Benetton, but he contracted with Lotus for 1993. He later stated that in hindsight, he should have stayed on as the Benetton test driver as he would likely have been given a full-time drive for 1994 following Riccardo Patrese&#x27;s retirement, where he would have been in a race-winning car alongside that year&#x27;s world champion Michael Schumacher.

Zanardi compared reasonably to teammate Johnny Herbert in 1993 and was important in fine-tuning the team&#x27;s active suspension system, scoring his only F1 point at the Brazilian Grand Prix. He was injured when an elderly motorist collided with his bicycle, knocking him down and running over Zanardi&#x27;s left foot. Despite several broken bones, Zanardi raced in Germany, but he spun out and did not finish. Zanardi&#x27;s season ended prematurely after he sustained a concussion as a result of a crash in practice for the Belgian Grand Prix.

Still recovering, Zanardi missed the beginning of the season while he was working as a test driver for Lotus, but he returned in the Spanish Grand Prix, replacing Pedro Lamy, who had been injured in a testing crash. However, Lotus struggled in its final season in F1 and Zanardi failed to score a single point or qualify higher than 13th. For the races in Belgium and Portugal, Zanardi was replaced by Belgian pay driver Philippe Adams.

With Lotus Formula One defunct, Zanardi practiced to race in sports car racing. His first meeting was at a Porsche Supercup event at Imola. Zanardi later raced at a four-hour event at Donington Park, where he and Alex Portman retired with eight minutes remaining despite leading by over a lap. The pair managed to finish 4th at a rainy day race at Silverstone.

===CART Championship series===

During 1995, Zanardi went to the United States for a drive in the CART Series. He felt that finding a race seat would be easy with Formula One experience, but drew no interest from any team. However, Reynard Commercial Director Rick Gorne managed to secure Zanardi a test drive at Homestead with Chip Ganassi Racing. Zanardi signed a contract on 23 October 1995. The team&#x27;s race engineer Mo Nunn advised Chip against signing him, as he believed Italian drivers were too prone to mistakes.

He rapidly became one of the series&#x27; most popular drivers. He took the pole for his second race, although his first win didn&#x27;t come until mid-season. Overall, he won three races in his rookie season and six pole positions, finishing third in the championship behind teammate Jimmy Vasser and Michael Andretti. He and Andretti were level on points but Andretti took second place by virtue of having five race wins compared to Zanardi&#x27;s three. Zanardi was named Rookie of the Year.

A win came at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca for the final race of the 1996 season, where he conducted a highly risky overtake at the Corkscrew corner (known to many racing fans as &quot;The Pass&quot;; the maneuver was banned for future years), on race leader Bryan Herta, having fought his way through the field.

Zanardi improved his form in CART in 1997, winning five of seventeen races, including three in a row and four of the five rounds held in the mid to late portion of the season en route to winning the Drivers&#x27; Championship. 1998 saw Zanardi even more dominant in his Ganassi Reynard-Honda, winning 7 of 19 races with an incredible 15 podiums in those 19 races. He won four races in a row in June and July en route to his second consecutive CART title, the third in a row for Ganassi and Honda, and the fourth for Reynard.

After winning a race, Zanardi was fond of spinning his car around in tight circles, leaving circular doughnut-shaped patterns of tyre rubber on the track; this would eventually become a popular means of celebrating race wins all across America.

===Return to Formula One===

Zanardi&#x27;s CART success caught the attention of Sir Frank Williams, with whom he made contact in 1997, to inform them he would be available for contract negotiations if needed. Williams visited Zanardi, who signed a three-year contract in July 1998 which was publicly confirmed in September of that year. He began testing at the end of that year alongside test driver Juan Pablo Montoya. Zanardi also received offers from BAR and Honda. In Australia, Zanardi was 9th quickest in the first free practice session but had limited track time due to reliability issues and traffic in qualifying meant he could only start 15th. He showed promise in the warm-up with 6th but the race saw him crash out on lap 21. Moving on to Brazil, Zanardi once again experienced limited time on the track which was mainly due to engine issues. He started 16th and retired with a differential failure. Zanardi also incurred a $5,000 fine for speeding in the pit lane.

At Imola, his form improved with a start position of 10th. The race itself threw up a surprise for Zanardi. His car was suffering electronic issues and ran a steady 7th in the closing stages and ran over oil from Johnny Herbert&#x27;s Stewart at the Villeneuve chicane and spun into the gravel. Zanardi out-qualified Schumacher at Monaco by over half a second. More drama occurred on race day as the seat in his Williams broke off during the early stages of the race but he managed to finish 8th and last of the runners. In Spain, despite setting the 5th-quickest lap in first free practice, a wrong set-up placed Zanardi 17th in qualifying. His car&#x27;s gearbox seized after a pit stop. Similar problems occurred in Canada where Friday practice running was limited. Managing to out-qualify Schumacher, Zanardi&#x27;s race was incident filled. Whilst running in 8th, he spun off into the gravel trap early on and dropped to last. Further time was lost when leaving the pit lane during a safety car period and receiving a stop-go penalty. A further excursion occurred when a maneuver on Luca Badoer&#x27;s Minardi ended with Zanardi crashing out.

The wet qualifying for the French Grand Prix saw him qualify 15th after the Williams team misread conditions and aquaplaned during the race. At Silverstone, Zanardi qualified 13th and finished 11th. In Austria, he started 14th. In the first part of the race, Zanardi&#x27;s radio communications failed and around lap 33, his team hung out pit boards, calling him in to pit, but a battle with Pedro Diniz distracted Zanardi, causing him to miss the board twice, and eventually ran out of fuel. Mechanical failures saw Zanardi with premature exits from the next two races before he finished eighth in Belgium.

In Monza, Zanardi qualified 4th ahead of teammate Ralf Schumacher. He overtook David Coulthard and Heinz-Harald Frentzen at the start. Frentzen took over 2nd from Zanardi at the Roggia chicane. On the third lap, the floor on the Williams became loose and he was forced to wave his rivals past, but managed to finish 7th. At the next round at the Nürburgring, Zanardi qualified in 18th, placing blame on traffic. He performed well at the start but had to take avoiding action when Alexander Wurz clipped Pedro Diniz. The incident left Zanardi in last position but he regained positions before his car succumbed to his engine stalling. The penultimate round in Malaysia had seen Zanardi start from 16th with a first-lap collision that damaged his front rim with a pit-stop preventing better progress. He later ran wide, which caused damage to the car radiators and prompted another pit-stop with Zanardi finishing 10th.

The final race of the season was in Japan, where he qualified 16th. In the race, Zanardi overtook many of his rivals, driving as high as 9th before his pit-lane limiter activated with the engine shutting off when he attempted to turn off the limiter on the first lap. At the end of the season, Zanardi and the Williams team decided to go their separate ways with an estimated cost of $4 million for the termination of Zanardi&#x27;s contract.

===CART return and Lausitzring crash===


In the 2000 season Zanardi was not signed for a team, but was interested in a CART comeback. He tested for Mo Nunn in July at Sebring driving for 246 laps and opted to sign to the team for 2001.

For most of the season, Zanardi had little success, with three top-ten finishes and a best result of fourth place in the 2001 Molson Indy Toronto. During the 2001 American Memorial at the EuroSpeedway Lausitz on 15 September 2001, Zanardi started from the back of the grid and was gaining the upper hand of the race. After a late pit stop, Zanardi was attempting to merge back onto the track when he accelerated abruptly, lost control of his car, and spun onto the race track into the direct path of Patrick Carpentier. Carpentier was able to avoid him, but Alex Tagliani, who was just behind Carpentier at the time, was not, and Zanardi&#x27;s car was blindsided from behind the front wheel, severing the nose of the car. Zanardi lost both legs (one at and one above the knee) in the impact and nearly three-quarters of his blood volume, though rapid medical intervention saved his life. Further portions of his legs were amputated during three hours of surgery to clean and facilitate closing the wounds.

==Post-amputation racing==
Zanardi was fitted with two prosthetic limbs and began rehabilitating. Dissatisfied with the limitations of legs available commercially, Zanardi designed and built his own custom legs, to allow him to compare the weight and stiffness of various feet to find the ones most suitable for racing. In 2002, CART honoured Zanardi by allowing him to wave the checkered flag in Toronto, Canada. In 2003, Zanardi was ready to take to the track again, with the aid of hand-operated brake and accelerator controls. Before the 2003 German 500 began, Zanardi ceremonially drove the thirteen laps he never finished at the Lausitzring in 2001. His fastest lap time of 37.487 seconds would have qualified him fifth in the actual race.
Zanardi competed at Monza, Italy in a round of the 2003 European Touring Car Championship, in his first race since the accident in a touring car modified to allow the use of his prosthetic feet, finishing the race in seventh. In 2004, Zanardi returned to racing full-time, driving for Roberto Ravaglia&#x27;s BMW Team Italy-Spain in the FIA European Touring Car Championship. In 2005, the series became the World Touring Car Championship by adding two non-European races. On 24 August 2005, Zanardi won his first world series race, celebrating with a series of trademark &quot;donuts&quot;. He took further wins at Istanbul in 2006 and Brno in 2008 and 2009. At the end of the 2009 season, he announced his retirement from the WTCC. He took the 2005 Italian Superturismo Championship as organised by the Automobile Club d&#x27;Italia with eight victories from twelve races in a Team BMW Italy-entered BMW 320si run by ROAL Motorsport.

Zanardi returned to a Formula One car in late November 2006 at a testing session for BMW Sauber in Valencia, Spain. The car had been specially adapted to have hand controls fitted on the steering wheel. After the drive, Zanardi said that the main problem he was having was using only his right hand to steer through corners, as his left operated the throttle. Zanardi said, &quot;Of course, I know that I won&#x27;t get a contract with the Formula One team, however having the chance to drive an F1 racer again is just incredible.&quot;

Since 2004, CRG has made and sold a range of kart chassis bearing Zanardi&#x27;s name. The Zanardi chassis has been raced in the European KF1 Championship and World Championship as well as in many other racing events worldwide. Dutch driver Nyck de Vries won the CIK-FIA Karting World Championship in 2010 and 2011 with Zanardi karts.

In November 2012, Zanardi tested a BMW DTM touring car, completing 32 laps of the Nürburgring. He later said that the test had rekindled his interest in motor racing, and in January 2014, it was announced that he would return to motorsport in the 2014 Blancpain Sprint Series season, racing a BMW Z4 GT3 for Ravaglia&#x27;s ROAL Motorsport team. In 2018, he made a one-off appearance in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters, driving a BMW M4 DTM in the Misano round of the series. After qualifying in last place for both races, he finished 12th out of 13 finishers in the first race before placing fifth in the second race in mixed weather: after the race he said that as radio communication between drivers and the pits is banned in the DTM except when cars are in the pit lane, when his team told him of his fifth-place finish he initially believed it was a joke at his expense.

Zanardi returned to American motor racing by entering the 2019 24 Hours of Daytona that January. Using a similar set of controls as the BMW M4 that he used in the DTM series, the GTLM-specification BMW M8 GTE had a special steering wheel that allowed him to actuate the accelerator with his left hand and shift with his right hand. Brakes were applied with a large handle with by his right hand. The brake handle also had a downshift trigger on it so he can still &quot;engine brake&quot; like his teammates John Edwards, Jesse Krohn and Chaz Mostert. The team finished 32nd overall and ninth in the GTLM category.

===Zanardi Edition NSX===
The Alex Zanardi Edition Acura NSX was introduced in 1999 for the U.S. market to commemorate Zanardi&#x27;s two back-to-back CART championship wins for Honda in 1997 and 1998. The car features revised suspension, as well as a fixed roof, lightweight BBS wheels, single-pane rear glass, a lightweight rear spoiler, manual steering, and a lighter battery, making it lighter than the targa top version. Only 51 examples were ever built, and all were painted in the newly introduced New Formula Red Color Code: R-510 which subsequently replaced Formula Red Color Code: R-77 in all markets from 2000 onward, to reflect the colour of the car he drove for Chip Ganassi Racing.

==Handcycling and triathlon==
After the injuries sustained from his 2001 racing accident, Zanardi decided to return to sport, taking up handcycling. In 2007, he achieved 4th place in the New York City Marathon in the handcycle division, after only four weeks of training. He has since taken up handcycling in earnest, and competed at the Para-Cycling Road World Championships in 2009. He stated that he was targeting a place in the Italian team for the 2012 Summer Paralympics. In 2009, he won the Venice Marathon in the category for disabled people, riding his wheelchair in one hour, thirteen minutes, 56 seconds, and won the Rome City Marathon in 2010, in a time of one hour, fifteen minutes, 53 seconds. In 2011, at his fourth attempt, Zanardi won the New York City Marathon in his handcycling class.

On 5 September 2012, Zanardi won a gold medal in the men&#x27;s road time trial H4 at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London, finishing 27.14 seconds ahead of Nobert Mosandi at Brands Hatch in Kent. Two days later, he won the individual H4 road race, ahead of Ernst van Dyk (South Africa) and Wim Decleir (Belgium), and then a silver medal for Italy in the mixed team relay H1-4 on 8 September 2012. The bike used by Zanardi was constructed by Italian racecar constructor Dallara. As a result, Zanardi was named one of &quot;The Men of the Year 2012&quot; by &quot;Top Gear&quot;. Zanardi was also voted the best male athlete of the 2012 Paralympics.

Before the Games in London, Zanardi expressed interest in returning to auto racing for the 2013 Indianapolis 500; while this failed to pan out, at the event he was presented with his 1996 CART Laguna Seca-winning car by Target Chip Ganassi Racing.

Zanardi completed the 2014 Ironman World Championship with a time of 9:47&#x27;14, ranking 272nd overall and 19th out of 247 in the 45–49-year category. He used a handbike for the cycling section and a wheelchair for the running section. In September 2015, Zanardi announced that he would be taking part in the Berlin Marathon using a recumbent hand cycle. At the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro he won the gold medals in the H5 category road cycling men&#x27;s time trial and mixed team relay, and also silver in the road race. On 22 September 2018, in a triathlon competition in Cervia, Italy, Zanardi broke the Ironman world record in the category of disabled people, with a time of 8:26&#x27;6. With that time, he also ranked fifth overall in the competition.

===2020 cycling accident===
On 19 June 2020, Zanardi was involved in a serious accident while competing in the &quot;Obiettivo tricolore&quot; Italian national road race for paralympic athletes. The accident occurred on State Highway 146 between Pienza and San Quirico. According to &quot;Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;, Zanardi was descending down a hill when he lost control of his handbike and veered into an oncoming truck, leading to severe facial and cranial trauma. Emergency services attended the scene after other competitors helped to raise the alarm, and Zanardi was airlifted to the Santa Maria alle Scotte Hospital in Siena. He was treated in intensive care for serious head injuries. In September 2020, it was reported that Zanardi was showing signs of interaction but that his condition remained &quot;serious&quot;, and that he had undergone several surgeries to reconstruct his face. In November 2020, Zanardi was transferred to a hospital in Padua, which was closer to his home to continue his recovery. In December 2020, it was reported that Zanardi regained his sight and hearing; he could also respond non-verbally to questions and shake hands on demand. In January 2021, it was reported that Zanardi was able to speak again following a waking surgery. In December 2021, 18 months after the accident, he was able to return home in order to continue his rehabilitation.

==Personal life==
Zanardi has been married to Daniela Manni since 1996, and they have a son, Niccolò (born 7 September 1998). He has co-written two books based on his life, &quot;Alex Zanardi: My Story&quot; (2004) with Gianluca Gasparini and &quot;Alex Zanardi: My Sweetest Victory&quot; (2004). Zanardi and his story have been featured on the HBO sports series &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&quot;. Zanardi wrote the opening chapters for the books of Steve Olvey, the former CART medical director, including, &quot;Rapid Response: My Inside Story as a Motor Racing Life Saver&quot;.

Zanardi has received multiple awards, including the Autosport Gregor Grant Award in 1998 and 2003, the Laureus World Sports Award for Comeback of the Year in 2005, and the Gazzetta Legend Award in 2015. He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2013 and the Long Beach Motorsports walk of fame in 2022.

In July 2022, Zanardi was hospitalized after a fire broke out at his home in Italy due to a defect on his home&#x27;s solar panels, which damaged medical equipment he used while recovering from his hand-cycling crash. He was released back to his home 76 days later in September.

<doc id="348736" wikidata="Q269500" url="?curid=348736" title="Chad Smith">
<text>Chad Smith (born October 25, 1961) is an American musician who has been the drummer of the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers since 1988, and became the band&#x27;s longest-serving drummer, and appeared on the band&#x27;s total 10 studio albums. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012. Smith is also the drummer of the hard rock supergroup Chickenfoot, formed in 2008, and of the all-instrumental outfit Chad Smith&#x27;s Bombastic Meatbats, formed in 2007. He worked with the Chicks on &quot;Taking the Long Way&quot;, an album that won five Grammy Awards in 2007.

Smith has recorded with Glenn Hughes, Johnny Cash, John Fogerty, Jennifer Nettles, Kid Rock, Jake Bugg, the Avett Brothers, Joe Satriani, Post Malone, Eddie Vedder, Lana Del Rey, Halsey, The Chicks, Dua Lipa, Charli XCX and Hardy . In 2010, joined by Dick Van Dyke and Leslie Bixler, he released &quot;Rhythm Train&quot;, a children&#x27;s album which featured Smith singing and playing various instruments. In 2020, Smith co-wrote and performed as part of the backing band on Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s album, &quot;Ordinary Man&quot;, and again in 2022 on &quot;Patient Number 9&quot;. That same year, Smith was a member of Eddie Vedder&#x27;s backing band, The Earthlings, after co-writing and recording the album, &quot;Earthling&quot;. He was the primary drummer on Iggy Pop&#x27;s &quot;Every Loser&quot; the following year.

&quot;Spin&quot; magazine placed Smith at number 91 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Drummers of Alternative Music&quot; in May 2013. Readers of UK-based &quot;Rhythm&quot; magazine ranked Smith and Red Hot Chili Pepper bassist Flea the fourth-greatest rhythm section of all time in their June 2013 issue. Smith is also known for his charity work especially with young musicians. He has been a lobbyist in support of music education in U.S. public schools. Smith is also the host of the PBS concert series &quot;Landmarks Live in Concert&quot;, which began in January 2017.

==Early life==
Smith was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, the third child of Joan and Curtis Smith. He spent most of his childhood in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where he graduated from Lahser High School in 1980. He started to play drums at age seven and grew up listening mainly to bands such as Rush, the Rolling Stones, Humble Pie, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, the Who, the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Kiss.

Smith did not receive formal drum lessons, and gained drumming experience by playing in school bands. He ran away from home when he was 15, but returned home after a summer.

Smith spent his early years in various rock bands, starting in high school with a band called Paradise which won a battle of the bands in Birmingham, Michigan, in 1977. Following this, Smith played with Pharroh and Michigan-based band Toby Redd. Pharroh&#x27;s percussionist Larry Fratangelo, who also worked with Parliament-Funkadelic, introduced Smith to R&amp;B and funk music and taught him how to play funk. Smith said, &quot;I think up until then, I was a drummer. Once I studied with Larry, I turned into a musician.&quot; Funk drummers David Garibaldi, Jabo Starks, Clyde Stubblefield, and Greg Errico caught his attention and influenced his style. Smith decided to move to California to pursue his musical aspirations.

==Music career==
===Red Hot Chili Peppers (1988–present)===
In 1988, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were looking for a replacement for their drummer D.H. Peligro, who had recently been fired. Already into the process of working on their fourth studio album and hiring new guitarist John Frusciante the band held open auditions for a new drummer. Smith was the last drummer to audition for the band and the band felt that on looks alone, Smith would be the wrong fit as he looked more hair-metal than punk. Nonetheless, the band were impressed by his audition. Singer Anthony Kiedis admired Smith and found his persistence impressive.

Smith joined the Chili Peppers in December 1988. Within a few months, he was recording his first album with the band, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot;, which was released in 1989. Smith reflected on joining the band in a 2012 interview by saying &quot;I remember thinking, &#x27;Oh, cool, they have a record deal. Great! I&#x27;d love to be in a band that has a record deal. We started playing, and right away we just hit it off musically. I was like, &#x27;Man, this is a blast! These guys are great!&#x27; ... We were just doing what we do. We just jammed, which is what we still do today. It&#x27;s very similar.&quot; Smith has recorded ten albums with the band since 1989 with their most recent, &quot;Return of the Dream Canteen&quot;, being released in 2022.

===Chad Smith&#x27;s Bombastic Meatbats (2007–present)===
In 2007, Smith, along with fellow Glenn Hughes alumni, guitarist Jeff Kollman and keyboardist Ed Roth, formed an all-instrumental band inspired by their shared love of 1970s funk and fusion. Still unnamed at the time, the group, rounded out by bassist Kevin Chown, debuted at the 2008 NAMM Show in Anaheim, California. The band has released two studio albums and a double live disc as Chad Smith&#x27;s Bombastic Meatbats since its inception.

===Chickenfoot (2008–present)===
Following a lengthy world tour in support of &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot;, the Chili Peppers decided to take a break in 2008. During this break, Smith joined the hard rock supergroup Chickenfoot, whose other members are Sammy Hagar, Joe Satriani and Michael Anthony. The group has released two studio albums, a live album and a box set to date with Smith. Due to touring commitments with the Chili Peppers in 2011, Smith was unable to tour with Chickenfoot and was replaced by Kenny Aronoff. In 2012, Smith rejoined Chickenfoot for a four-song encore and the band briefly reunited for only two shows on May 7, and May 8, 2016, at Harrah&#x27;s Showroom at South Lake Tahoe.

During the show, the band debuted a new song titled &quot;Divine Termination&quot;. In June 2016, Smith discussed the future of Chickenfoot touring and recording new music saying that &quot;everyone has different things going on. We really enjoy playing together, but with my schedule I don&#x27;t see us playing too much. I would love to make some new music with those guys, but we&#x27;d have to be in the same room at the same time. I just don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s up in the air. I love playing with those guys, though. It&#x27;s a real treat.

===Other projects===

Smith released 2010&#x27;s &quot;Rhythm Train&quot;, a critically acclaimed children&#x27;s album which he recorded with Dick Van Dyke and Leslie Bixler.

Smith released an app in March 2012, which is a free mobile application for iPhone, iPad, and Android devices and features his &quot;Drummer GPS&quot;. The GPS section of the app spotlights drummers Smith has been influenced by and those he regards as some of the best modern drummers. In May 2013, he launched &quot;In Conversation with Chad Smith&quot;, his own podcast through MusicRadar where he interviews other musical artists.

Smith joined Sammy Hagar in the studio to work on music for what would become Hagar&#x27;s sixteenth studio album. They were joined by guitarist Neal Schon (from Journey) and bassist Michael Anthony and according to Hagar, it was the rebirth of his 1980s band HSAS, which featured Schon and two other members.

In 2013, Smith joined jazz musician Jon Batiste and bassist/producer Bill Laswell to create a unique musical group to score a film that had yet to be written and would never be made. The album, &quot;The Process&quot;, was released on November 4, 2014.

Starting on January 20, 2017, Smith began hosting &quot;Landmarks Live in Concert&quot;, an eight-episode concert series on PBS in which Smith will sit down and discuss music with various artists. The first two episodes featured Alicia Keys and Brad Paisley.

Smith performs drums on the Lorne Balfe composed score for &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;. The soundtrack for the animated film was released on February 3, 2017.

On May 28, 2018, Smith along with co-host and Yahoo Entertainment music editor Lyndsey Parker, began their own music radio talk show on SiriusXM titled VOLUME West which airs every Monday. The duo will talk music with artists, industry leaders, friends and they will also interview their guests about their favorite songs, albums, and artists.

Smith performs drums on the Post Malone song &quot;Take What You Want&quot; from his third album &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s Bleeding&quot;. The song also features Black Sabbath lead singer Ozzy Osbourne and rapper Travis Scott. That collaboration with Post Malone led to the creation of Osbourne&#x27;s 2020 album, &quot;Ordinary Man&quot;, which Smith co-wrote along with Guns N&#x27; Roses bassist Duff McKagan and producer Andrew Watt. Smith also performed drums on every track. On December 17, 2020, it was announced that the next studio album by Ozzy Osbourne was halfway done and would again feature Smith along with Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo and drummer Taylor Hawkins from Foo Fighters.

On January 1, 2021, Post Malone during his Bud Light Seltzer Sessions New Year&#x27;s Eve 2021 livestream show was joined by Smith, Slash from Guns N&#x27; Roses, Chris Chaney from Jane&#x27;s Addiction and producer/guitarist Andrew Watt for a performance of Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;War Pigs&quot; and &quot;Rooster&quot; by Alice In Chains. Smith contributed to the charity tribute album &quot;The Metallica Blacklist&quot;, released in September 2021, backing Miley Cyrus on her cover of the Metallica song &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;.

Smith performs drums on Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s 2022 album, &quot;Patient Number 9&quot;. Smith also co-wrote two of the songs on the album.

Smith and Flea, Josh Klinghoffer collaborated with Morrissey on his upcoming album &quot;Bonfire of Teenagers,&quot; which was supposed to be released in February 2023, but in December 2022 it was announced that its future is in limbo, as Capitol Records decided not to release it.

Smith performs on seven of the songs and also co-wrote five songs on Iggy Pop&#x27;s 2022 album, &quot;Every Loser&quot;. To promote the album, Smith will be part of Pop&#x27;s backing band called The Losers which consists of Josh Klinghoffer, Duff McKagan and Andrew Watt.

It was announced in March 2024 that Smith will appear as himself in &quot;Spinal Tap II&quot;, the upcoming sequel to the 1984 mockumentary film &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot;.

==Playing style==
Smith&#x27;s technique is recognized for its use of ghost notes, as well as his fast right foot.

He cites Buddy Rich, John Bonham, Ian Paice, Mitch Mitchell, Bill Ward, Keith Moon, Stewart Copeland, Neil Peart, Ringo Starr, Ginger Baker, Roger Taylor and Topper Headon as influences on his drumming.

==Charity work==
Smith is an active supporter of several non-profit organizations including &quot;Surfer&#x27;s Healing&quot;, SeriousFun Network, MusiCares, Silverlake Conservatory of Music, &quot;Guitar Mash NY&quot;, &quot;Camp Korey&quot; and Little Kids Rock which he discussed in an interview with Making Music Magazine.

In April 2013, Smith was asked by the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM), to represent the music community by going to Washington, D.C. as a lobbyist in support of music education in US public schools. While in DC, Smith had the opportunity to meet with congressional leaders and share his experience as a student who learned his craft entirely within the public school system. Smith has since been invited back to lobby in April 2014 in support of public school music education.

In 2014, Smith joined Bystander Revolution a group that speaks out against bullying in schools and tries to find solutions. Smith released a few videos discussing his own childhood being bullied along with his son&#x27;s recent experiences with bullies.

On May 21, 2014, Smith appeared along with other celebrities in Washington, D.C. at a White House talent show held by Michelle Obama which was organized to raise awareness for Turnaround Arts, a program enacted under the guidance of the President&#x27;s Committee on the Arts and Humanities (PCAH) to increase performance and achievement at some of the lowest-ranked schools in the country through arts education. Students from eight schools around the country participated in the show which featured musical theatre, spoken word and interpretative dance. President Barack Obama made a surprise appearance at the event. Smith adopted a school in Greenfield, California also lobbied Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner for increased funding for arts education and that it is a personal issue for him. Smith said &quot;I didn&#x27;t give a shit about science, math or English when I was in school and music was the only reason I wanted to go. It got me interested in other subjects and I would&#x27;ve never graduated without it. If kids can connect with some sort of art in some way, it will enrich their lives in ways they probably can&#x27;t fully comprehend at the time.&quot; Earlier in the week, Smith was joined by former New York Yankee and musician, Bernie Williams at Savoy Elementary School in Washington, D.C. where together they taught a music class. &quot;These are schools where the kids look down at their feet and have no hope and don&#x27;t feel like they mean anything. They have no self-worth. They need something. This is not a photo-op and just throwing some money. You really roll your sleeves up and immerse yourself in the school.&quot; Smith said.

Smith appeared at Sammy Hagar and James Hetfield&#x27;s 2nd annual &quot;Acoustic-4-A-Cure&quot; benefit concert in San Francisco, California on May 15, 2015. The benefit was held to raise money and awareness for the Pediatric Cancer Program at UCSF Benioff Children&#x27;s Hospital. Smith was joined onstage by Pat Monahan of the band Train and comedian Adam Sandler for a performance of Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Dream On&quot; and Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Ramble On&quot;.

The following day on May 16, 2015, Smith was honored by national nonprofit, &quot;Little Kids Rock&quot; at its annual Family Jam benefit at Facebook&#x27;s Menlo Park campus for his work to help expand public schoolchildren&#x27;s access to music education with the &quot;Livin&#x27; The Dream Award&quot;. In a statement on receiving the award Smith said &quot;It is such an honor for me to be recognized by an amazing charity like &quot;Little Kids Rock&quot; for supporting their work to keep music education thriving in our schools. Music has made such a tremendous impact in my life and I am blessed to be able to give that gift back to the next generation of music makers!&quot;

Smith along with his Chili Peppers bandmates announced in September 2015 that they would be supporting Bernie Sanders in his campaign for the 2016 presidential election. In February 2016, the Chili Peppers performed on behalf of Sanders at his &quot;Feel the Bern&quot; campaign fundraiser.

On April 29, 2016, Chad Smith and Will Ferrell hosted the &quot;Red Hot Benefit Comedy + Music Show &amp; Quinceanera&quot;. The benefit featured a performance by the Chili Peppers along with comedy acts selected by Ferrell and Funny or Die. A portion of the proceeds went to Ferrell&#x27;s Cancer for College and Smith&#x27;s Silverlake Conservatory of Music.

On February 12, 2018, Smith again teamed with Will Ferrell for his One Classy Night event at the Moore Theater in Seattle to help raise money for Cancer for College. Smith along with Ferrell, Mike McCready and Brandi Carlile performed songs by Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, R.E.M. and were joined by Eddie Vedder for a cover of Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;. The event raised $300,000 in college scholarship money for students who have survived cancer, and has raised 2.3 million to date.

On October 6, 2018, Smith and Will Ferrell hosted &quot;Will Ferrell&#x27;s Best Night of Your Life&quot;, a one night charity event in Los Angeles at the Greek Theater. The event, produced by Funny or Die, will benefit Cancer for College and feature many big-name celebrities. Smith also will assemble an MVP musical line up dubbed Chad Smith&#x27;s Super Mega Funktastic Jam Rock All Stars which will feature his Chili Peppers bandmate Josh Klinghoffer, Mike McCready of Pearl Jam, Duff McKagan of Guns N&#x27; Roses, Stefan Lessard of Dave Matthews Band, Brad Paisley and Chris Martin of Coldplay.

On January 13, 2019, Smith along with the Chili Peppers performed at a benefit for victims of the recent deadly Woolsey Fire. &quot;It was cool. It was fun. It was a good vibe, and we really appreciate all the people that came down and paid a lot of money — it wasn&#x27;t a cheap ticket. But all the proceeds are going to the people that suffered from the fires and the families and everything that is involved in that.&quot; Smith said that the fires even put the band&#x27;s recording of their twelfth album on hold saying &quot;the house we were working in, there was no damage, it didn&#x27;t burn down, but we couldn&#x27;t get back in there. So that halted our [progress]. Myself and Anthony both live in Point Dume. Seventy houses in our neighborhood burned down. Ours was spared, luckily.&quot;

==Visual art==
In January 2020, Smith opened his first art exhibit, stating &quot;The way that I want to interpret my feelings about playing the drums and playing music - I&#x27;m trying to put this in a different medium. [...] I love to express myself in any sort of creative way that I can, and doing this is another way to kind of take chances and take a risk, and I like to do that. I think it&#x27;s important for any artist to do that- to keep trying new things. It&#x27;s not your normal medium, you know. It&#x27;s not like Bob Ross with an afro in front of the thing and painting,&quot; Smith said.

==Personal life==
=== Family and relationships ===
Smith has been married twice. Smith was married to Maria St John from 1992 to 1997, with whom Smith had a daughter.

In 2004, Smith married his second wife, architect Nancy Mack, with whom he has three sons. The family lives in Malibu, California.

He also has two other children through other relationships.

=== Sexual misconduct ===
At an MTV Spring Break concert in 1990, Smith and his bandmate Flea were accused of sexually harassing a 20-year-old woman as she was dancing during the concert. According to beach rangers, Smith&#x27;s bandmate Flea picked up the woman and swung her over his shoulder. She was thrown onto the sand; Flea and Smith spanked her and attempted to remove her swimsuit bottoms. Flea knelt on her legs, yelling at her to perform a sexual act. As a result, the two men were ordered to apologize, pay a fine, and donate to a rape crisis centre. The woman approved of this sentence. Smith in his apology wrote: &quot;I clearly got carried away in the theatrics of the moment and I now realize how inappropriate and wrong my actions were.&quot;

=== Sobriety ===
Like some of his bandmates in the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Smith has struggled with substance abuse. He struggled with alcoholism and cocaine use for many years. He checked into a drug rehabilitation facility in 2008.

=== Sports ===
Smith is also an avid fan of his hometown Michigan sports teams, including the NHL&#x27;s Detroit Red Wings. Similarly to Kiedis and Flea, Smith is also an avid fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, regularly displaying the team&#x27;s logo on his drum kit.

Following the Red Hot Chili Peppers May 14, 2017, performance in Columbus, Ohio, Smith sang the University of Michigan fight song &quot;The Victors&quot;. Smith&#x27;s singing of the fight song made national news as the University of Michigan and Ohio State are longtime sports rivals. At shows in Ohio, Smith&#x27;s drumset has sometimes featured the Michigan Wolverines logo. Smith and Flea have owned season tickets to the Los Angeles Rams since 2016.

===Will Ferrell resemblance===
Smith is widely known for his strong facial resemblance to actor and comedian Will Ferrell, which he has acknowledged by wearing shirts reading &quot;I Am Not Will Ferrell&quot; in live performances. Smith said that the two first met during the premiere of the film &quot;The Ladies Man&quot; (2000). He said, &quot;I&#x27;m looking at Will and thinking, &#x27;People really think I look like him? I don&#x27;t fucking look like that. He looks me up and down and says, &#x27;You&#x27;re very handsome,&#x27; and walks away. Totally deadpan. I was like, &#x27;You&#x27;re funny. You&#x27;re funny. Both Smith and Ferrell have utilized the resemblance for various appearances together, including their own events for charity and a 2014 appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, in which the duo faced off in a drum battle, which segued into a musical number by the Red Hot Chili Peppers performing a cover of Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot;, as a reference to the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; &quot;More Cowbell&quot; skit, in which both Ferrell and Jimmy Fallon starred. During a December 2022 Rams&#x27; home game in Los Angeles, the Rams&#x27; media team poked fun at the recurring gag after Smith made an appearance with the rival-Seattle Seahawks&#x27; drum line the week prior; displaying Smith next to a picture of Ferrell on the jumbotron.

In the January 2025 Peacock documentary &quot;SNL50: Beyond Saturday Night&quot;, the entire third episode was devoted to the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; &quot;More Cowbell&quot; skit. Ferrell wrote the skit for a 2000 episode of the show and portrayed the character of Gene Frenkle. Ferrell and others in the documentary discuss the skit and it&#x27;s legacy including newly filmed flashback scenes with Chad Smith portraying the Frenkle character.

=== Shark attack incident ===
While scuba diving on vacation near Wakaya Island on November 12, 1992, following the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; tour of Australia, Smith was attacked by an approximately three-meter hammerhead shark. He was diving offshore when the shark began circling him. Smith attempted to keep still as the shark approached, then fended it off when it attempted to bite him. Afterwards, the shark swam away. The shark removed a &quot;small chunk of skin&quot; from his left arm.

<doc id="348737" wikidata="Q483852" url="?curid=348737" title="Mrs. Doubtfire">
<text>Mrs. Doubtfire is a 1993 American comedy film directed by Chris Columbus, written by Randi Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon, based on the 1987 novel &quot;Madame Doubtfire&quot;, by Anne Fine. The film was produced by Mark Radcliffe, Marsha Garces Williams and her then-husband Robin Williams, who also starred in the lead role. The film co-stars Sally Field, Pierce Brosnan, Harvey Fierstein, and Robert Prosky. It follows a recently divorced actor who disguises himself as an elderly female housekeeper to be able to interact with his children.

The film was released in the United States by 20th Century Fox on November 24, 1993. It won the Academy Award for Best Makeup, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. Williams was awarded the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.

The film grossed $441.3 million on a $25 million budget, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 1993. The film received mixed reviews on release, but placed 67th in the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs&quot; list and 40th on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies of All Time&quot; list. The original music score was composed by Howard Shore.

==Plot==

Daniel Hillard, a freelance voice actor living in San Francisco, is a devoted father to his three kids—14-year-old Lydia, 12-year-old Chris, and 5-year-old Natalie—although his workaholic wife Miranda considers him immature and unreliable. After quitting a gig following a disagreement over a morally questionable script, Daniel returns home to throw Chris a chaotic birthday party despite Miranda&#x27;s objections due to Chris&#x27; poor grades. In the ensuing argument, Miranda loses her temper and admits that she wants a divorce. Due to Daniel&#x27;s unemployed and homeless status, Miranda is granted sole custody of the kids, with Daniel having visitation rights every Saturday; shared custody is contingent on Daniel finding a steady job and suitable residence within three months.

Daniel secures an apartment and a shipping clerk job at a television station. After learning that Miranda is looking to hire a housekeeper, Daniel secretly alters her classified ad form before calling her using his voice acting skills to pose as various undesirable applicants before calling as &quot;Euphegenia Doubtfire&quot; (a name he gets from a newspaper headline), an elderly British nanny with strong credentials. Impressed, Miranda invites Mrs. Doubtfire for an interview. Daniel&#x27;s brother, Frank, a makeup artist, and Frank&#x27;s domestic partner, Jack, use makeup and prosthetics to help Daniel appear as an old woman.

Miranda hires Mrs. Doubtfire following a successful interview. The kids initially struggle under her authority, but eventually come around and thrive, while Miranda becomes more easygoing and closer with the kids. Daniel also further improves himself by becoming more responsible and learning several household skills, earning Miranda&#x27;s respect. However, this further limits Daniel&#x27;s access to his kids, as Miranda puts more trust in Mrs. Doubtfire than him and cannot bring herself to dismiss her. Miranda also begins dating an old friend, Stuart &quot;Stu&quot; Dunmeyer, to Daniel&#x27;s chagrin. One night, Chris catches Mrs. Doubtfire standing while urinating and frantically instructs Lydia to call the police. In a panic, Daniel reveals his identity; Lydia and Chris agree to keep his secret so that they can continue spending time with their father.

One day, Jonathan Lundy, the CEO of the station where Daniel works, sees Daniel playing with props on the set of a recently canceled children&#x27;s show. Impressed by his voice acting, humor, and imagination, Lundy invites Daniel to dinner to discuss plans for a new show. The meeting turns out to be at the same place and time as a planned birthday dinner for Miranda to which Mrs. Doubtfire is invited. Daniel spends the night changing in and out of the Mrs. Doubtfire costume so that he can attend both events, but accidentally drunkenly returns to Lundy in costume; he quickly explains by claiming that Mrs. Doubtfire is his idea for the new show&#x27;s host. After learning of Stu&#x27;s pepper allergy, Daniel sneaks into the kitchen and seasons Stu&#x27;s jambalaya with powdered cayenne. When Stu begins choking, Daniel remorsefully administers the Heimlich maneuver, causing his prosthetic mask to slip off, exposing his identity. Horrified, Miranda leaves with the kids.

At their next custody hearing, Daniel points out that he has met the judge&#x27;s requirements ahead of schedule and explains that his actions were done due to love for his kids and begs to be allowed to continue to see them. The judge, finding Daniel&#x27;s behavior unorthodox, dismisses his words as another ruse, grants Miranda full custody of the kids, and further restricts Daniel&#x27;s rights to supervised Saturday visits. This devastates Daniel, the kids, and even Miranda, who realizes that her resentment and bitterness toward Daniel have been hurting the family. Without Mrs. Doubtfire, Miranda and the kids become miserable and acknowledge that &quot;she&quot; improved their lives. They then discover that Mrs. Doubtfire is hosting a new children&#x27;s show, &quot;Euphegenia&#x27;s House&quot;, which becomes a nationwide hit.

One day, Miranda visits Daniel on the set and admits that things were better when he was involved with the family. She arranges joint custody, allowing Daniel to take the kids daily after school. As Daniel leaves for the day with the kids, Miranda watches an episode of &quot;Euphegenia&#x27;s House&quot; where Mrs. Doubtfire answers a letter from a young girl whose parents recently separated. Mrs. Doubtfire says that no matter what arrangements families have, love will prevail.

===Casting===

Tim Allen was offered the roles of Daniel Hillard and Stu Denmeyer, but declined both of them.

==Production==

&quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; was filmed in San Francisco. Various locations in the city were used during filming. Parts were filmed at the studios of television station KTVU in Oakland. Street signs for the intersection near the &quot;Painted Lady&quot; home, Steiner, and Broadway, were visible onscreen.

The exact address, 2640 Steiner Street, became a tourist attraction for some time after the film&#x27;s release. Following Williams&#x27; death on August 11, 2014, the house became an impromptu memorial. All interior filming for the home took place in a Bay Area warehouse, converted for soundstage usage. Williams&#x27; character, Daniel Hillard, lived upstairs from Danilo Bakery at 516 Green Street; his children attended a school at Filbert and Taylor.

The makeup for Mrs. Doubtfire&#x27;s appearance took four hours to apply. Williams later recounted how he used to walk through San Francisco dressed in full makeup and costume as Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire, and on one occasion, visiting a sex shop to buy a large dildo and other toys. Director Chris Columbus stated in a 2015 interview that they shot with multiple cameras at once, like shooting a documentary, to capture the cast members&#x27; reaction to Williams&#x27;s improvisation. According to Columbus, they ran out of film after shooting too much of Williams&#x27; improvisation. The restaurant scene was filmed at Bridges Restaurant &amp; Bar in Danville, California.

The score was composed, orchestrated and conducted by Howard Shore.

The &quot;Pudgy and Grunge&quot; animated film segment in the opening scene was directed by Chuck Jones. Though only one minute of the cartoon is shown during the film, Jones and his team animated five minutes of footage.

==Release==
The film was released in the United States on November 24, 1993, and was rated PG-13.

When the film was released in the United Kingdom in January 1994, it received a certificate of 12, which, at the time, completely refused access to children under age 12 at cinemas (the 12A certificate did not exist until 2002). This resulted in cinemas requesting their local authorities to override the decision of the British Board of Film Classification, after having to turn down disappointed families. In February 1994, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that the censors refused to give the film a U or PG certificate, and gave it a 12 instead, which was due to 20th Century Fox refusing to remove three controversial lines. After the film&#x27;s distributors requested the BBFC to reconsider, a compromise was reached, and the film was rerated PG, with just one of the proposed three cuts implemented, involving the removal of thirteen seconds featuring sexual innuendo (the other two cuts would have removed just some of the innuendo), and it was rereleased in May 1994.

===Home media===
Fox Video released the film on VHS in the United States on April 26, 1994, just five months after the film&#x27;s theatrical release and while the film was still grossing over $1 million a weekend. It would also debut on a THX certified LaserDisc release that same month.

In the United Kingdom, the PG version was used in the initial VHS and DVD releases. In November 2012, the distributors resubmitted the original version to the BBFC, and the 12 certificate was reinstated for home video, along with a 12A certificate for cinema release in 2014. On March 4, 2013, the original version was released on Blu-ray and downloads in the United Kingdom.

===Deleted scenes===
Over 30 minutes of scenes were omitted from the final cut of the film, some of which were featured in the 2008 DVD release of &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; called the &quot;Behind-the-Seams Edition&quot;. If the scenes had been included, the film would have run for 157 minutes. These include an entire subplot featuring Daniel&#x27;s conflict with his nosy neighbor, Gloria Chaney (Polly Holliday), in which, after Daniel dresses as Mrs. Doubtfire, he fools Gloria into killing her flowers by spraying dog urine on them, and a final confrontation in which Gloria sees Daniel in his Mrs. Doubtfire bodycostume but without the face mask. There is also an extended scene at Bridges restaurant. In 2016, three scenes from the 2008 DVD release, which were also included in the 2013 Blu-ray release, gained media attention to much fanfare and praise for Robin Williams. These included a scene in which Daniel and Miranda fight at Lydia&#x27;s spelling bee competition, and a confrontation scene with Miranda after Daniel&#x27;s identity is revealed at the restaurant. He recovers and comes back home to the family.

In early 2021, several web articles claimed that there was an NC-17 cut of the film featuring extraordinarily vulgar ad libs by Robin Williams. However, the claim was debunked by director Chris Columbus and star Mara Wilson, with Columbus stating that Williams did film enough outtakes to make an R-rated version, but that an NC-17 rating was absurd. Wilson previously denied the claims of an NC-17 version of the film in 2016 in her memoir, &quot;Where Are They Now?: True Stories of Girlhood and Accidental Fame&quot;.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; collected $20.4 million during its three-day opening weekend. Within its first five days of release, it generated a total gross of $27.5 million. Upon opening, it would go on to reach the number one spot at the box office, beating out &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; and &quot;A Perfect World&quot;. This would be the last non-Disney film to win the Thanksgiving weekend box office until &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; in 2000. The film earned $219,195,243 in the United States and Canada, and $222,090,952 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $441,286,195, making it Fox&#x27;s highest-grossing film internationally at the time, and the highest-grossing cross-dressing film. It became the second-highest-grossing film of 1993, behind &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot; Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 52.6 million tickets in the US. It had a record opening for Fox in the United Kingdom, with $5.8 million in 6 days (and the third-best in the country, after &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;), and went on to gross $30.1 million, a Fox record. It had the second-biggest opening in Italy, behind &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, with $2.9 million, and also grossed a record for Fox in Italy, with $15.6 million. It had record openings for Fox in France (with an opening week gross of $4.8 million, and a total of $23 million), Belgium, Hungary and Denmark. It grossed $29.6 million in Germany. The film was number one at the Australian box office and Japanese box office for nine consecutive weeks.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; received mixed reviews from critics upon release. At the time of its release, several critics compared &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; unfavorably with &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; (1959), and others who viewed the film favorably noted its similarity to &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982).

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; has a rating of 71%, based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 5.90/10. The site&#x27;s critical reception reads: &quot;On paper, &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; might seem excessively broad or sentimental, but Robin Williams shines so brightly in the title role that the end result is difficult to resist.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 53 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of a possible four. He questioned if William&#x27;s character could actually conceal his identity in makeup from his ex-wife and children, and also wrote &quot;the film is not as amusing as the premise, and there were long stretches when I&#x27;d had quite enough of Mrs. Doubtfire.&quot; Ebert also noted comparisons to &quot;Tootsie&quot;, which he described as &quot;more believable, more intelligent and funnier&quot; while &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; was essentially a television sitcom.

In 2000, the American Film Institute placed the film on its 100 Years...100 Laughs list, where it was ranked #67.

==Canceled sequel and Cast Reunions==
In 2001, Bonnie Hunt began to develop &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire 2&quot;. Anne Fine had not written a follow-up to &quot;Alias Madame Doubtfire&quot;, and writing for the sequel did not begin until 2003. Robin Williams was set to return in disguise as the eponymous Mrs. Doubtfire. Rewriting began in 2006 because Williams was unhappy with the plot in the new script. The film had been anticipated for release in late 2007, but following further script problems, the sequel was scrapped in December 2006.

In 2006, in a &quot;Newsday&quot; interview, Williams said that the sequel was indefinitely scrapped, stating his reasons:

Also, in December that year, during an interview on BBC Radio 1 by DJ Edith Bowman, Williams said that if it was not going to be done right, then it was not worth doing, and that there would not be a sequel with him in it.

In August 2010, on &quot;Alan Carr: Chatty Man&quot;, Williams again brought up the topic of a sequel to &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;. He blamed the script not being right as the reason why a sequel was not made. He claimed that the script had been written three times and failed, and there was no mention of any ongoing work on the project. Furthermore, in December 2011, during an interview by &quot;Moviehole&quot;, Williams again stated that the chances of a sequel are &quot;highly unlikely&quot;.

In 2011, Williams said:

In 2014, Chris Columbus stated, in turn:

In April 2014, a sequel was announced to be in development at 20th Century Fox. Williams and Columbus were expected to return, and &quot;Elf&quot; screenwriter, David Berenbaum, was hired to write the script. Initial reception to the announcement was mixed, with some people fearing that the sequel would revive certain misgivings about the transgender community and set the LGBTQ awareness progress back two and a half decades, especially after an image of the character was used to mock the trans community at a medical insurance coverage reform in 2013. Matthew Lawrence, Lisa Jakub and Pierce Brosnan had expressed interest in reprising their respective characters for the sequel. However, Mara Wilson, who played Natalie Hillard in the original film, expressed no interest in returning for the sequel. Following Williams&#x27;s death in August 2014, plans for a sequel were put on hold, then again canceled.

In August 2014, shortly after Robin Williams&#x27;s death, it was revealed that Williams had grown weary working on film sets because it tended to take him away from his family for extended periods of time, and he signed on for the sequel &quot;purely out of necessity&quot;. In August 2015, Chris Columbus revealed that the sequel came to be after someone came up with a very interesting idea, and that his conversation with Williams about the subject was the last time he ever talked to the actor. In December 2021, Columbus stated that a sequel is impossible without Robin Williams&#x27;s involvement.

The three sibling cast members reunited with Pierce Brosnan in 2018 for the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary and on their own for a joint podcast appearance in 2024.

== Stage adaptation ==

Theatrical producer Kevin McCollum spoke in 2013 about the film&#x27;s musical prospects, noting that the plot was &quot;tailored for Broadway audiences&quot;. Following a 2015 plan going on hiatus, McCollum assembled a different creative team in 2018: Karey and Wayne Kirkpatrick composing the score, with John O&#x27;Farrell and Karey Kirkpatrick writing the book, and Tony Award-winner Jerry Zaks directing. The musical, &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;, premiered in Seattle at the 5th Avenue Theatre on December 13, 2019. The production transferred to Broadway, with previews beginning March 9, 2020, at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre. All Broadway productions were suspended three days later due to the coronavirus pandemic. Eventually, &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; resumed previews on October 21, 2021, and officially opened on December 5, 2021.

<text>The Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP; commonly called the Irish Party or the Home Rule Party) was formed in 1874 by Isaac Butt, the leader of the Nationalist Party, replacing the Home Rule League, as official parliamentary party for Irish nationalist Members of Parliament (MPs) elected to the House of Commons at Westminster within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland up until 1918. Its central objectives were legislative independence for Ireland and land reform. Its constitutional movement was instrumental in laying the groundwork for Irish self-government through three Irish Home Rule bills.

==Origins==
The IPP evolved out of the Home Rule League which Isaac Butt founded after he defected from the Irish Conservative Party in 1873. The League sought to gain a limited form of freedom for Ireland within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in order to manage Irish domestic affairs in the interest of the Protestant landlord class. It was inspired by the success in the 1868 general election of William Ewart Gladstone and his Liberal Party under the slogan &quot;Justice for Ireland&quot;, in which the Liberals won 65 of the 105 Irish seats at Westminster. Gladstone said his mission was to pacify Ireland. The Irish Church Act 1869 provided for the disestablishment of the Anglican Church of Ireland, whose members were a minority in Ireland and would have largely voted Conservative. He also introduced his first land bill which led to the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870, implementing limited &quot;tenant rights&quot;, thereby impinging on the powers of the Irish landlords to indiscriminately evict tenant farmers. At first the Catholic hierarchy supported Gladstone supervising Irish affairs, hoping to gain financial aid for a Catholic University. But his educational programme of 1873 did not provide for a denominational university.

The Home Government Association adopted educational issues and land reform into its programme, the hierarchy then favouring a Dublin-based parliament. The increasing Catholic numbers within the association frightened off its Protestant, landlord element. The association was dissolved and Butt replaced it with the Home Rule League, formed after a conference in Dublin in November 1873. Gladstone unexpectedly called a general election in 1874, which helped bring the League to the foreground. Under the Ballot Act 1872, votes in general election were to be cast in private for the first time. The League put denominational education, land reform and release of political prisoners at the centre of the movement. It had difficulty finding reliable candidates to support its Home Rule issue, though succeeded in winning sixty Irish seats, many with ex-Liberals.

==History==
===Party inaugurated===
After the 1874 general election, forty-six members assembled in Dublin and organised themselves into a separate Irish parliamentary party in the Commons. The political outlook appeared encouraging at first, but the party was unable to achieve anything, the Liberals and Gladstone having lost the election. Isaac Butt made some well-received speeches but failed to persuade any of the major parties to support bills beneficial to Ireland, nothing worthwhile reaching the statute books.

A minor group of impatient young Irish members, the genuine &quot;Home-Rulers&quot; distanced themselves from Butt&#x27;s lack of assertiveness and, led by Charles Stewart Parnell, Joseph Biggar, John O&#x27;Connor Power, Edmund Dwyer Gray, Frank Hugh O&#x27;Donnell and John Dillon, some of whom had close connections with the Fenian movement, adopted the method of parliamentary &quot;obstructionism&quot; during 1876–1877, to bring Westminster out of its complacency towards Ireland by proposing amendments to almost every bill and making lengthy overnight speeches. This did not bring Home Rule closer, but helped to revitalise the Irish party. Butt considered obstructionism a threat to democracy; in practice, its greatest achievement was to help bring Parnell to the fore of the political scene. An internal struggle began between Butt&#x27;s majority and Parnell&#x27;s minority leading to a rift in the party; Parnell determined to obtain control of the Home Rule League.

===Land-war mainspring===

Parnell first worked successfully to have Fenians freed who missed out on Gladstone&#x27;s earlier amnesty, including Michael Davitt. After his release in 1877, Davitt travelled to America to meet John Devoy, the leading Irish-American Fenian and raise funds. During 1878 Parnell also met with leading members of the Irish American Fenians. In October Devoy agreed to a New Departure of separating militancy from the constitutional movement in order to further its path to Home Rule. Throughout 1879 Parnell continued to campaign for land reform and when Davitt founded the Irish National Land League in October 1879 Parnell was elected president, but did not take control of it, favouring to continue to hold mass meetings. Isaac Butt died later that year and Parnell held back in grabbing control of the party. Instead he travelled to America with John Dillon on a fund raising mission for political purposes and to relieve distress in Ireland after a world economic depression slumped the sale of agricultural produce.

At the 1880 general election, sixty-four Home Rulers were elected, twenty-seven Parnell supporters, facilitating in May his nomination as leader of a divided Home Rule Party and of a country on the brink of a land war. He immediately understood that supporting land agitation was a means to achieving his objective of self-government. The Conservatives under Disraeli had been defeated in the election and Gladstone was again Prime Minister. He attempted to defuse the land question with the &quot;dual ownership&quot; Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881 which failed to eliminate tenant evictions. Parnell and his party lieutenants, William O&#x27;Brien, John Dillon, Michael Davitt, Willie Redmond, went into a bitter verbal offensive and were imprisoned in October 1881 under the Irish Coercion Act in Kilmainham Jail for &quot;sabotaging the Land Act&quot;, from where the No Rent Manifesto was issued calling for a national tenant farmer rent strike which was partially followed. Although the League discouraged violence, agrarian crimes increased widely.

===Truce and treaty===

In April 1882 Parnell moved to make a deal with the government. The settlement involved withdrawing the manifesto and undertaking to move against agrarian crime, seeing militancy would never win Home Rule. The so-called Kilmainham Treaty, a truce not dissimilar to truces to follow, marked a critical turning point in Parnell&#x27;s leadership, though it resulted in losing the support of Devoy&#x27;s American-Irish. However, his political diplomacy preserved the national Home Rule movement after the Phoenix Park Murders in May of the Chief Secretary for Ireland and his Under Secretary. For the next twenty years Fenians and physical-force militancy ceased to play a role in Irish politics.

With the Land League suppressed and internally fracturing, Parnell resurrected it in October as the Irish National League (INL). It combined moderate agrarianism, a Home Rule programme with electoral functions. It was hierarchical and autocratic in structure with Parnell wielding immense authority and direct parliamentary control. Parliamentary constitutionalism was the future path. The informal alliance between the new, tightly disciplined National League and the Catholic Church was one of the main factors for the revitalisation of the national Home Rule cause after 1882. Parnell saw that the explicit endorsement of Catholicism was of vital importance to the success of this venture. At the end of 1882 the organisation already had 232 branches, in 1885 increased to 592 branches. He left the day-to-day running of the League in the hands of his lieutenants Timothy Harrington as Secretary, William O&#x27;Brien editor of its newspaper &quot;United Ireland&quot; and Tim Healy.

===Parnellism reigns===

Parnell&#x27;s new Irish Parliamentary Party emerged swiftly as a tightly disciplined—one author described it as &quot;a regiment led by C. S. Parnell and by Michael Davitt&quot; and on the whole, energetic body of parliamentarians with strict rules. The inauguration of the &quot;party pledge&quot; in 1884 decisively reinforced that each member was required to sit, act and vote with the party, one of the first instances of a whip (Richard Power) in western politics. The members were also paid stipends, or expense allowances from party funds, which helped both to increase parliamentary turnout and enabled middle-class members such as William O&#x27;Brien or later D. D. Sheehan attend parliament, long before other MPs first received state pay in 1911. The profiles of the 105 Irish MPs had changed considerably since 1868 when 69% were landlords or the sons of landlords, reduced to 47% by 1874. Those with professional backgrounds increased from 10% to 23% in the same period, by the early 1890s professionals exceeding 50%.

Now at his height Parnell pressed Gladstone to resolve the Irish Question with Home Rule, but the Liberals were divided. Parnell then sided with the Conservatives. Gladstone&#x27;s second government fell, and Lord Salisbury&#x27;s Conservatives formed an administration. Both parties now courted Parnell.

The result of Parnell&#x27;s reforms and reorganisation were fully reflected in the general election of November–December 1885. This election was the first to be fought under the extended suffrage of the 1884 Reform Act. The Reform Act had increased from 220,000 to 500,000 the number of Irishmen who had a right to vote, many of whom were small farmers. The election increased the total Irish Party representation from 63 to 85 seats, which included seventeen in Ulster. In January 1886 the INL had developed to 1,262 branches and could claim to contain the vast body of Irish Catholic public sentiment. It acted not merely as an electoral committee for the Irish Party, but as local law-giver, unofficial parliament, government, police and supreme court. Parnell&#x27;s personal authority in the organisation was enormous. The INL was a formidable political machine built in the traditional political culture of rural Ireland. It was an alliance of tenant farmers, shopkeepers and publicans. No one could stand against it.

The party secured a seat in the English city of Liverpool, which contains a large Irish Catholic community. T. P. O&#x27;Connor won the Liverpool Scotland seat in 1885 and retained it in every election until his death in 1929 – even after the demise of the actual party (O&#x27;Connor being returned unopposed in the elections of 1918, 1922, 1923, 1924, and 1929).

The IPP emerged from the 1885 general election holding the balance of power. The Liberals had won 335 seats, but the IPP&#x27;s 86 seats were enough to keep the 249 Conservatives in power for the time being.

===Home Rule delayed===
Early in 1886, Gladstone declared himself in favour of Home Rule. Parnell&#x27;s party changed sides, allowing Gladstone to form his third government. Gladstone introduced the first Home Rule Bill 1886 and, after a long and fierce debate, made a remarkable , beseeching parliament to pass the bill which was, however, defeated by 341 to 311 votes. The Bill caused serious riots in Belfast during the summer and autumn of 1886, in which many were killed.

Since 1882, Parnell&#x27;s successful drive for Home Rule created great anxiety amongst Protestants and Unionists north and south alike, fearing Catholic intolerance from a nationalist parliament in Dublin under their control would impose tariffs on industry. While most of Ireland was primarily agricultural, six of the counties in Ulster were the location of heavy industry and would be affected by any tariff barriers imposed. It resulted in the revival of the Orange Order to resist Home Rule and the forming of an Irish Unionist Party. With the Conservatives playing the &quot;Ulster card&quot;, and sections of the Liberal faction voting against the bill, Gladstone hinted that eventually a separate solution for Ulster might need to be sought. His observation echoed far into the next century.

The Liberal Party split on the issue of Irish Home Rule. With the defeat of his Home Rule bill, Gladstone was granted a general election for July 1886, the result swinging in the other direction. The Conservatives were the largest party and were able to form a minority government with the loose support of the Liberal faction opposed to Home Rule, the Liberal Unionist Party.

The Irish Party retained 85 seats and, in the years up to 1889, centred itself around the formidable figure of Parnell, who continued to pursue Home Rule, striving to reassure English voters that it would be of no threat to them. During that period, the National League was out of contact with him and primarily concerned with its own vested interests, keeping up local agitation during the Plan of Campaign to further the not-fully-resolved land question, and leading Liberal voters to slowly increase their support for Home Rule.

===Zenith eclipse===
Parnell successfully exposed an attempt to use the forged Pigott Papers to associate him and his party with crime and violence; he was vindicated in February 1890. Gladstone invited Parnell to his country house (Hawarden in Flintshire) to discuss a renewed Home Rule bill. This was the high point of Parnell&#x27;s career. However, since 1880 he had had a family relationship with a married woman Katharine O&#x27;Shea who bore him three children. Her divorce proceedings first came to court late in 1890, in which Parnell was named co-respondent. This was a political scandal for English Victorian society. Gladstone reacted by informing Parnell that if he were re-elected leader of the Irish Party, Home Rule would be withdrawn. Parnell did not disclose this to his party and was selected leader on 25 November.

A special meeting of the party a week later lasted six days at the end of which 45 &quot;anti-Parnellites&quot; walked out, leaving him with 27 faithful followers, J. J. Clancy one of his key defenders. Both sides returned to Ireland to organise their supporters into two parties, the former Parnellite Irish National League (INL) under John Redmond and John Dillon&#x27;s anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation (INF). By-elections in 1891 were fought with bitter venom by the INF anti-Parnellites, Dillon and Healy making extremely personal attacks on Parnell. The INF was also supported by the Catholic clergy who went to aggressive extremes to ensure that INF candidates were returned.

Parnell worked untiringly between Ireland and Britain making speeches for support which he actually got from the (IRB) Fenians who rallied to him. He was married in June 1891 to Mrs O&#x27;Shea. After an election tour in the west of Ireland, his health deteriorated seriously, and he died in October in their Brighton home. His funeral in Dublin was attended by 200,000 people. In his speeches he was convinced of an Ireland completely separated from Britain, but was ambiguous, never committing himself nor distancing himself, from the use of physical-force.

===Party divided===
In the 1892 general election that followed, Redmond&#x27;s Parnellites won a third of the Home Rule/nationalist votes (18.2% Parnellites v. 58.9% for anti-Parnellites) but only nine seats, the anti-Parnellites returned 72 MPs divided between Dillonites and a fragmented minority of six Healyites – the People&#x27;s Rights Association. Gladstone and the Liberals were again in power, the divided Home Rulers holding the balance of power. He brought in his promised second Home Rule Bill in 1893. It was master-handled through three readings of the Commons by William O&#x27;Brien and passed in September by 301 votes to 267, during which Unionist conventions called in Dublin and Belfast to oppose the bill, denounced the possibility of partition. A week later 419 peers in the Lords rejected it, only 41 supporting. Gladstone retired in 1894.

The Conservatives and Liberal Unionists returned to power in the 1895 general election, now in coalition and remaining in office until 1905. During those years Home Rule was not on their agenda. Instead, with Arthur Balfour&#x27;s &quot;Constructive Unionism&quot; approach to settling the Irish Question they enacted many important reforms introduced by the Irish members, who, on the other hand, made no effort to settle their party differences. This bred apathy amongst the Irish public towards politics, much needed financial contributions from America ebbing away. In this period of political disarray and disunity of purpose young Irish nationalists turned instead to the country&#x27;s new cultural and militant movements, enabling the Church to fill the political vacuum.

The unresolved land reform situation was again the mainspring for renewed political activity. William O&#x27;Brien had withdrawn from parliament to Mayo and in 1898, driven by the plight of the farming community&#x27;s need for more land, formed together with Davitt a new land movement, the United Irish League (UIL). It quickly spread first in the west, the following year nationwide like the old Land League and attracted members from all factions of the two split parties, O&#x27;Brien threatening to displace them and take them both over.

===Reconstruction===
The outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899 was condemned by both Irish factions; their combined opposition helped to bring about a measure of understanding between them. By 1900 the threat of O&#x27;Brien swamping and outmanoeuvring them at the upcoming elections forced the two divided parties, the INL and the INF, to re-unite. He was the prime mover and may be truly regarded as an architect of the settlement of 1900 in merging them under a new programme of agrarian agitation, political reform and Home Rule into a new united Irish Parliamentary Party. Redmond, leader of the smaller INL group, was chosen as its leader mainly due to the personal rivalries between the INF&#x27;s Anti-Parnellite leaders. After the party returned 77 MPs in the 1900 general election a period of considerable political development followed.

The UIL, explicitly designed to reconcile the fragmented party, was accepted as the parliamentary nationalists&#x27; main support organisation, with which O&#x27;Brien intensified his campaign of agrarian agitation. Encouraged by the Chief Secretary George Wyndham and initiated by moderate landlords led by Lord Dunraven the December 1902 Land Reform Conference followed, which successfully aimed at a settlement by conciliatory agreement between landlord and tenant. O&#x27;Brien, Redmond, T. W. Russell (who spoke for Ulster tenant-farmers) and Timothy Harrington represented the tenant side. Its outcome became the basis for O&#x27;Brien orchestrating the unprecedented Wyndham Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903 through parliament, which enabled tenant farmers to buy out their landlord&#x27;s land at favourable annuities, while giving the landlords a premium price. The last landlords sold out in the 1920s, thus ending the age-old Irish land question.

===Renewed rift===
The masterful strategy adopted by William O&#x27;Brien of bringing about agreement on land purchase between tenants and landlords under the Act, may almost be said to have been too great a success as it resulted in a rush of landlords to sell and of tenants to buy. Dillon, the deputy party leader, disfavoured the Act because he opposed any negotiations with landlords, Michael Davitt objected to peasant proprietorship, demanding land nationalisation. Together with Thomas Sexton editor of the party&#x27;s &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, they campaigned against O&#x27;Brien, ferociously attacking him for putting Land Purchase and Conciliation before Home Rule. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s appeal to Redmond to suppress their opposition went unheeded. After stating that he was making no headway with his policy, he resigned his parliamentary seat in November 1903. It was a serious setback for the party, at the same time turning once intimate friends into mortal enemies. O&#x27;Brien subsequently engaged during 1904–1905 with the Irish Reform Association and in 1907 with the Irish Council Bill which he viewed as a step in the right direction, or &quot;Home Rule by instalments&quot;, equally condemned by his opponents.
O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s UIL was taken over by Dillon&#x27;s protégé and ally, Joseph Devlin, a young Belfast MP, as its new secretary. Devlin had founded a decade earlier the Catholic sectarian neo-Ribbon Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH), organising its rise first in Ulster and after he had control of the UIL, eventually across the south, largely displacing the UIL. The Irish Party came to have an increasing dependence on the AOH, though the party&#x27;s attempts to crush out Healyite and O&#x27;Brienite &#x27;factionism&#x27; were carried out through its national organisation, the UIL. The 1906 general election saw the Liberals back in power with 379 seats, an overwhelming majority of 88 over all other parties, after they had promised Home Rule. Redmond&#x27;s IPP now with 82 seats, at first delighted until the Liberals backed down on Home Rule, knowing it had no chance in the Lords.

The IPP rift with O&#x27;Brien deepened after he helped guide the Bryce 1906 Labourers (Ireland) Act through parliament, which provided large-scale government funding for a programme of extensive rural social housing. In the following five years over 40,000 labourer owned cottages standing on an acre of land and purchases at low annual annuities, were erected by Local County Councils. The Act, and the follow-on Birrell Labourers Act of 1911, housed over a quarter of a million rural labourers and their families and thereby transformed the Irish countryside.

In 1907 Richard Hazleton became the new party secretary. Outside the party at this time were the MPs William O&#x27;Brien, Sir Thomas Esmonde, T. M. Healy, Charles Dolan, John O&#x27;Donnell, Augustine Roche and D. D. Sheehan. Proposals to reunite the party were made by Redmond and a meeting summoned for the Mansion House, Dublin in April 1908. O&#x27;Brien and others rejoined the party temporarily for the sake of unity. But on his demand for further treasury funding for land purchase, O&#x27;Brien was ultimately driven out for good at a Dublin Convention in February 1909 by the party&#x27;s vigorous militant support organisation, Devlin&#x27;s &quot;Hibernians&quot;. After which O&#x27;Brien founded his own political party in March 1909, the All-for-Ireland League (AFIL).

===Notable legislation===
During the previous years many notable Acts of social legislation were pressed for and passed in Ireland&#x27;s interest:
*The creation of the Congested Districts Board in 1891, which built public works for, and provided employment in, the poor districts of western Ireland.
*The extensive 1898 Local Government Act abolished the old landlord-dominated Grand Juries and replaced them by forty-nine county, urban and rural district councils, managed by Irish people for the administration of local affairs. The councils were very popular in Ireland as they established a political class, who showed themselves capable of running Irish affairs. It also stimulated the desire to attain Home Rule and to manage affairs on a national level. A less positive consequence was that the councils were largely dominated by the Irish Party, becoming the wielders of local patronage.
*Irish Department of Agriculture Act and Technical Instructors Act (1899) (initiative of Horace Plunkett)
*Tenant Land Purchase Acts: (Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903 and Birrell Act 1909), contributing greatly to the solution of the contentious land question
*Labourers (Ireland) Acts (Bryce Act 1906 and Birrell Act 1911) (the Sheehan Acts), providing rural labourers with extensive housing
*Town Tenants Act (1906)
*Evicted Tenants Act (1907)
*Old Age Pensions Act (1908)
*Irish (Catholic) University Act (1908)
*Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Act (1908) (the Clancy Act)

===Home Rule succeeds===
In the January 1910 United Kingdom general election (January 1910 general election in Ireland), the Liberals lost their majority, and became dependent on the Irish (IPP and AFIL) Party&#x27;s 84 seats. Redmond, holding the balance of power in the Commons, renewed the old &quot;Liberal Alliance&quot; this time with H. H. Asquith as Prime Minister (the Labour Party also supported the government). Asquith needed the support of Irish MPs to pass the People&#x27;s Budget and, after a second general election in December 1910 had produced almost exactly the same result, he had no choice but to agree to a new Home Rule Bill. The Parliament Act 1911 abolished the veto of the House of Lords over most matters and limited them to a two-year delaying power, ensuring that Redmond&#x27;s reward of a Government of Ireland Bill for the whole of Ireland introduced in 1912 would subsequently achieve national self-government in Dublin by 1914.

This prospect after 40 years of struggle was greeted optimistically, even when self-government was initially limited to running Irish affairs. But for Unionists, convinced the Union with the United Kingdom was economically best for Ireland, and for Protestants, now that Devlin&#x27;s paramilitary AOH organisation had saturated the entire island, fearing a Church dominated nationalist government, it was a disaster.

After the Bill passed its first readings in 1913, Ulster Unionists&#x27; opposition became a repeat scenario of events in 1886 and 1893, their leader Sir Edward Carson approving of an Ulster Volunteer militia to oppose Home Rule. Unionists and the Orange Order in mass demonstrations determined to ensure that Home Rule would not apply for them. Nationalists in turn formed their own armed group, the Irish Volunteers to enforce Home Rule. The initiative for a series of meetings leading up to the public inauguration of the Volunteers came from the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB). The Volunteers had 180,000 members by May 1914. Redmond, worried by the growth of nationalist mass movement outside the Party, quickly tried to take control of the Volunteers. He demanded and was given a position on its leadership council and rapidly filled its ranks with IPP supporters.

Redmond and his IPP nationalists, as later those who succeeded them in 1919, had little or no knowledge of Belfast, underestimating Unionist resistance as a bluff, insisting &quot;Ulster will have to follow&quot;. William O&#x27;Brien who in 1893 worked closely on passing the Second Home Rule Bill, warned to no avail, that if adequate provisions were not made for Ulster, All-Ireland self-government would never be achieved.

The Bill was the centre of intense parliamentary debate and controversy throughout 1913–1914 before it passed its final reading in May, denounced by the O&#x27;Brienite Party as a &quot;partition deal&quot; after Carson forced through an Amending Bill providing for the exclusion of Ulster, permanent or provisional to be negotiated, which ultimately led to the partition of Ireland. This was deeply resented among northern nationalists and southern unionists who felt themselves abandoned. The Government of Ireland Act 1914 received Royal Assent in September 1914, celebrated with bonfires across southern Ireland.

===Europe intervenes===
The outbreak of World War I in August led to the suspension of the Home Rule Act for the duration of the war, expected to only last a year. Ireland&#x27;s involvement in the war defused the threat of civil war in Ireland and was to prove crucial to subsequent Irish history. After neutral Belgium had been overrun by Germany, Redmond and his party leaders, in order to ensure Home Rule would be implemented after the war, called on the Irish Volunteers to support Britain&#x27;s war effort (her commitment under the Triple Entente and the Allied cause).

The Volunteers split on the issue of support for the British and Allied war effort. The majority (over 142,000) formed the National Volunteers, compared to roughly 10,000 who stayed with the original organisation. Though initially there was a surge in voluntary enlistment for the Irish regiments of the 10th (Irish) Division and the 16th (Irish) Division of Kitchener&#x27;s New Service Army formed for the war, the enthusiasm did not last.

Unlike their 36th (Ulster) Division counterparts and the Ulster Volunteers who manned it with their own trained military reserve officers, the southern Volunteers possessed no officers with previous military experience with the result that the War Office had the 16th Division led by English officers, which with the exception of Irish General William Hickie, and the fact that the division did not have its own specific uniforms, was an unpopular decision. The War Office also reacted with suspicion to Redmond&#x27;s remark that the Volunteers would soon return as an armed army to oppose Ulster&#x27;s resistance to Home Rule.

Around 24,000 of the National Volunteers did enlist but the remainder, or about 80% did not. Moreover, the organisation declined due to lack of training and organisation as the war went on. &quot;The resulting collapse of the National Volunteers presaged that of the Irish Party itself, though this was less obvious. Its support for the War was gradually revealed to be a major political encumbrance.&quot; The Under Secretary for Ireland, Mathew Nathan, writing in November 1915, thought that Redmond&#x27;s stance on the War ultimately cost him and his party their pre-eminent position in Irish life, &quot;Redmond has been honestly imperial, but by going as far as he has, he has lost his position in the country.&quot;

When the war situation worsened, a new Conservative-Liberal coalition government was formed in May 1915. Redmond was offered a seat in its cabinet, which he declined. This was welcomed in Ireland but greatly weakened his position after his rival, unionist leader Carson accepted a cabinet post. As the war prolonged, the IPP&#x27;s image suffered from the horrific casualties at the Cape Helles landings at Gallipoli as well as on the Western Front.

The party was taken by surprise by the Easter Rising in April 1916, launched by the section of the Irish Volunteers who had remained in the original organisation. The Volunteers, infiltrated to a large degree by the separatist Irish Republican Brotherhood, declared an Irish Republic and took over much of the centre of Dublin. The rebellion in Dublin was put down in a week of fighting with about 500 deaths. The manner in which British General Maxwell dealt with its leaders won sympathy for their cause. A total of 16 were shot within weeks of the Rising and another hanged several weeks later. The Rising began the decline of constitutional nationalism as represented by the IPP and the ascent of a more radical separatist form of Irish nationalism. John Redmond, protesting at the severity of the state&#x27;s response to the Rising, wrote to Asquith, &quot;if any more executions take place, Ireland will become impossible for any Constitutional Party or leader&quot;.

Further problems for the party followed Asquith&#x27;s abortive attempt to introduce Home Rule in July 1916 which failed on the threat of partition. Again Lloyd George&#x27;s initiative to disentangle the Home Rule deadlock after Redmond called the Irish Convention in June 1917, when Southern Unionists sided with Nationalists on the issue of Home Rule, ended unresolved due to Ulster resistance.

===Crisis and change===
In sharp contrast to Parnell, John Redmond lacked charisma. He worked well in small committees, but had little success in arousing large audiences. Parnell always chose the nominees to Parliament. Now they were selected by the local party organisations, giving Redmond numerous weak MPs over whom he had little control. Redmond was an excellent representative of the old Ireland, but grew increasingly out-dated as he paid little attention to the new forces attracting younger Irishman, such as Sinn Féin, and the Ancient Order of Hibernians in politics, the Gaelic Athletic Association in sports, and the Gaelic League in cultural affairs. He never tried to understand the forces emerging in Ulster. Redmond was further weakened in 1914 by the formation by Sinn Féin members of the militaristic Irish Volunteers. His enthusiastic support for the British war effort alienated many Catholics. His party had been increasingly hollowed out, and the major crises—notably the Easter Rising in 1916 and the Conscription crisis of 1918—were enough to destroy it.

Redmond died in March 1918 and John Dillon took over the IPP leadership. In March the German spring offensive overran part of the British front. Lloyd George&#x27;s cabinet took a &quot;dual policy&quot; decision by, clumsily linking implementing Home Rule with alleviating the severe manpower shortage by extending conscription to Ireland. The Irish party withdrew in protest from Westminster and returned to Ireland to join forces with other national organisations in massed anti-conscription demonstrations in Dublin. Although conscription was never enforced in Ireland, as fresh American troops began to be deployed to France in large numbers, the threat of conscription radicalised Irish politics. Sinn Féin, the political arm of the Volunteer insurgents, had public opinion believe that they alone had prevented conscription.

The Irish party held its own and returned its candidates in by-elections up to the end of 1916, the last in the West-Cork by-election of October 1916. The tide then changed after it lost three by-elections in 1917 to the more physical-force republican Sinn Féin movement, which in the meantime had built up 1,500 organised clubs around Ireland and exceeded the strength of the old UIL, most of the latter members now joining the new movement. At the end of the war in November 1918 when elections were announced for the December general election, the Irish electorate of nearly two million had a threefold increase under the Representation of the People Act 1918. Women were granted franchise for the first time (confined to those over thirty) and a vote to every male over twenty-one years of age. This increased the number of voters from 30% to 75% of all adults.

===Decisive election===

The Irish Parliamentary Party was for the first time confronted with double opponents from both Unionists and Sinn Féin (the Irish Labour Party founded in 1912 did not participate). In the past the IPP only faced opposition from candidates at conventions within the Home Rule movement. It never had to compete a nationwide election, so that the party branches and organisation had slowly declined. In most constituencies the new young local Sinn Féin organisation controlled the electoral scene well in advance of the election. As a result, in 25 constituencies the IPP did not contest the seats, and Sinn Féin candidates were returned unopposed.

The Party lost 78 of its 84 seats. This was due to the &quot;first past the post&quot; British electoral system. Votes cast for the IPP were 220,837 (21.7%) for merely 6 seats (down from 84 out of 105 seats in 1910). Sinn Féin votes were 476,087 (or 46.9%) for 48 seats, plus 25 uncontested totalling an 73 seats. Unionist (including Unionist Labour) votes were 305,206 (30.2%) – by which Unionists increased their representation from 19 to 26 seats. The Irish Party leader Dillon lost his seat and the party was dissolved. The remnants of the IPP later re-established itself with six members to form the Nationalist Party in Northern Ireland under Joe Devlin.

Twenty-seven of the newly elected Sinn Féin MPs assembled in Dublin on 21 January 1919 and formed an Irish parliament, or Dáil Éireann of a self-declared Irish Republic. Their remaining MPs were either still imprisoned or impaired. The UK state did not recognise the Dáil&#x27;s unilateral existence, which led to the War of Independence. The government remained committed to introducing Home Rule in Ireland, and in 1921 implemented the Fourth Home Rule Act, which partitioned Ireland into Northern Ireland and a non-functioning Southern Ireland before the Anglo-Irish Treaty.

==After dissolution==
The results, while a triumph for the republicans, showed that the IPP&#x27;s politics still had a significant constituency across the island. In the North East, and especially in Belfast, the IPP had more or less held their ground against the Sinn Féin insurgency, (Éamon de Valera soundly beaten by Joe Devlin in the Falls division). The IPP regrouped to become the Nationalist Party of Northern Ireland.

In the South after the Irish Civil War, the political estate of the Irish Party inherited by Sinn Féin evolved into the two nationalist parties of the post-1922 state. On the pro-Treaty side, some Cumann na nGaedheal / Fine Gael leaders (apart from James Dillon) had &#x27;Redmondite&#x27; backgrounds, the most notable being John A. Costello, a later Taoiseach. The core of this party group was however solidly Sinn Féin, IRB and IRA in background. On the anti-Treaty Sinn Féin side that developed into Fianna Fáil, there was no continuity with the Irish Party at elite level. Many former AOH/IPP followers also lingered on as a pro-Treaty support organisation, some AOH adherents later fought on the Francoist side in the Spanish Civil War, the quasi-fascist Blueshirt movement of the 1930s maybe owing much to its Ribbon tradition. Veteran MP Timothy Michael Healy was the first Governor-General of the Irish Free State (1922–1928), an enlightened choice to bridge the gap between the old order and the new generation of Cumann na nGaedheal politicians, although highly partisan (his nephew was Minister for Justice Kevin O&#x27;Higgins; Healy made a public attack on Fianna Fáil and Éamon de Valera, which led to republican calls for his resignation). Former party MP Hugh Law was elected as a Cumann na nGaedheal TD during the 1920s.

The conservative nationalist National League Party operated between 1926 and 1931, founded by former IPP MPs Captain William Redmond (son of Irish National League and IPP leader John Redmond) and Thomas O&#x27;Donnell. It quickly faltered, with many of its prominent members (including Redmond, Vincent Rice, John Jinks and James Coburn) joining Cumann na nGaedheal / Fine Gael, although O&#x27;Donnell became an active member of Fianna Fáil. A short-lived National Centre Party was formed in 1932, absorbing the remnants of the conservative Farmers&#x27; Party and led by Frank MacDermot and James Dillon (son of IPP leader John Dillon). The success of Fianna Fáil prompted the National Centre Party to amalgamate with Cumann na nGaedheal to become Fine Gael in 1933. Both MacDermot and Dillon later left Fine Gael, and both argued for Irish entry into World War II on th side of the Allies. MacDermot later joined Fianna Fáil while Dillon returned to Fine Gael and served as party leader from 1959 to 1965.

<doc id="348746" wikidata="Q486882" url="?curid=348746" title="Michio Kaku">
<text>Michio Kaku (; ; born January 24, 1947) is an American physicist, science communicator, futurologist, and writer of popular-science. He is a professor of theoretical physics at the City College of New York and the CUNY Graduate Center. Kaku is the author of several books about physics and related topics and has made frequent appearances on radio, television, and film. He is also a regular contributor to his own blog, as well as other popular media outlets. For his efforts to bridge science and science fiction, he is a 2021 Sir Arthur Clarke Lifetime Achievement Awardee.

His books &quot;Physics of the Impossible&quot; (2008), &quot;Physics of the Future&quot; (2011), &quot;The Future of the Mind&quot; (2014), and &quot;The God Equation: The Quest for a Theory of Everything&quot; (2021) became &quot;New York Times&quot; best sellers. Kaku has hosted several television specials for the BBC, the Discovery Channel, the History Channel, and the Science Channel.

==Early life and education==
Kaku was born in 1947 in San Jose, California. His parents were both second-generation Japanese-Americans. According to Kaku, his grandfather came to the United States to participate in the cleanup operation after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and his father and mother were both born in California. Both his parents were interned in the Tule Lake War Relocation Center during World War II, where they met and where his elder brother was born.

According to Kaku, he was inspired to pursue a career in physics after seeing a photograph of Albert Einstein&#x27;s desk at the time of his death. Kaku was fascinated to learn that Einstein had been unable to complete his unified field theory and resolved to dedicate his life to solving this theory. For a high school science fair, Kaku built a 2.3 eV “atom smasher” in his parents&#x27; garage. Using scrap metal and of wire, the device was powerful enough to produce antimatter. It was at this National Science Fair in Albuquerque, New Mexico, that he attracted the attention of physicist Edward Teller, who took Kaku as a protégé, awarding him the Hertz Engineering Scholarship. 

Kaku attended Harvard College, where he was a resident of Leverett House, and graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1968 as the first in his physics class. He attended the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, receiving a PhD and holding a lectureship at Princeton University in 1972.

In 1968, during the Vietnam War, Kaku, who was about to be drafted, joined the United States Army, remaining until 1970. He completed his basic training at Fort Benning, Georgia, and advanced infantry training at Fort Lewis, Washington. However, he was never deployed to Vietnam.

==Academic career==
As part of the research program in 1975 and 1977 at the department of physics at the City College of the City University of New York, Kaku worked on research on quantum mechanics. He was a Visitor and Member (1973 and 1990) at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and New York University. As of 2024, he holds the Henry Semat Chair and Professorship in theoretical physics at the City College of New York.

Between 1970 and 2000, Kaku had papers published in physics journals covering topics such as superstring theory, supergravity, supersymmetry, and hadronic physics. In 1974, Kaku and Prof. Keiji Kikkawa of Osaka University co-authored the first papers describing string theory in a field form.

Kaku is the author of several textbooks on string theory and quantum field theory. An explicit description of the second-quantization of the light-cone string was given by Kaku and Keiji Kikkawa.

==Popular science==
Kaku is most widely known as a popularizer of science and physics outreach specialist. He has written books and appeared on many television programs as well as film. He also hosts a weekly radio program.

===Radio===
Kaku is the host of the weekly one-hour radio program &quot;Exploration&quot;, produced by the Pacifica Foundation&#x27;s WBAI in New York. &quot;Exploration&quot; is syndicated to community and independent radio stations and makes previous broadcasts available on the program&#x27;s website. Kaku defines the show as dealing with the general topics of science, war, peace, and the environment.

In April 2006, Kaku began broadcasting &quot;Science Fantastic&quot; on 90 commercial radio stations in the United States. It is syndicated by Talk Radio Network and now reaches 130 radio stations and America&#x27;s Talk on XM and was the only nationally syndicated science radio program. When Kaku is busy filming for television, &quot;Science Fantastic&quot; goes on hiatus, sometimes for several months.

Kaku is also a frequent guest on many programs. As a guest on the program &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; on November 30, 2007, he reaffirmed his belief that the existence of extraterrestrial life is a certainty.

===Television and film===

Kaku has appeared in many forms of media and on many programs and networks, including &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;The Screen Savers&quot;, &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;Imus In The Morning&quot;, &quot;Nightline&quot;, &quot;20/20&quot;, &quot;Naked Science&quot;, CNN, ABC News, CBS News, NBC News, Al Jazeera English, Fox News Channel, The History Channel, &quot;Conan&quot;, The Science Channel, The Discovery Channel, TLC, &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;, &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, &quot;The Art Bell Show&quot; and its successor, &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;, &quot;BBC World News America&quot;, &quot;The Covino &amp; Rich Show&quot;, &quot;Head Rush&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, the Joe Rogan Experience, and &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;.

In February 2006, Kaku appeared as presenter in the BBC-TV four-part documentary &quot;Time&quot; which discussed the nature of time.

On January 28, 2007, Kaku hosted the Discovery Channel series &quot;2057&quot;. This three-hour program discussed how medicine, cities, and energy could change over the next 50 years.

In 2008, Kaku hosted the three-hour BBC-TV documentary &quot;Visions of the Future&quot;, on the future of computers, medicine, and quantum physics, and he appeared in several episodes of the History Channel&#x27;s &quot;Universe&quot; and &quot;Ancient Aliens&quot; series.

On December 1, 2009, he began hosting a 12-episode weekly television series for the Science Channel at 10 pm, called &quot;Sci Fi Science: Physics of the Impossible&quot;, based on the book of the same name. Each 30-minute episode discusses the scientific basis behind imaginative schemes, such as time travel, parallel universes, warp drive, and similar. Each episode includes interviews with other scientists working on prototypes of these technologies, interviews with science fiction fans, and clips from relevant science fiction movies.

In January 2007, Kaku visited Oman. While there, he talked at length to select members of that country&#x27;s decision makers. In an interview with local media, Kaku elaborated on his vision of the future of humans. Kaku considers climate change and terrorism as serious threats in human evolution from a Type 0 civilization to Type 1 on the Kardashev scale.

==Policy advocacy and activism==
Kaku has publicly stated his concerns over matters including people denying the anthropogenic cause of global warming, nuclear armament, nuclear power, and what he believes to be the general misuse of science. He was critical of the Cassini–Huygens space probe because of the of plutonium contained in the craft for use by its radioisotope thermoelectric generator. Conscious of the possibility of casualties if the probe&#x27;s fuel were dispersed into the environment during a malfunction and crash as the probe was making a &quot;sling-shot&quot; maneuver around Earth, Kaku publicly criticized NASA&#x27;s risk assessment. He has spoken on the dangers of space junk and called for more and better monitoring. Kaku is generally a vigorous supporter of the exploration of space, believing that the ultimate destiny of the human race may lie in extrasolar planets, but he is critical of some of the cost-ineffective missions and methods of NASA.

Kaku credits his anti-nuclear war position to information he learned via programs he heard on the Pacifica Radio network during his student years in California. It was during this period that he made the decision to turn away from a career developing the next generation of nuclear weapons in association with his mentor, Edward Teller, and instead focused on research, teaching, writing, and accepting media opportunities to educate.

Kaku was a board member of Peace Action and of radio station WBAI-FM in New York City, where he originated his long-running program, &quot;Exploration&quot;, that focuses on the issues of science, war, peace, and the environment.

His remark from an interview in support of SETI, &quot;We could be in the middle of an intergalactic conversation... and we wouldn&#x27;t even &quot;know&quot;&quot;, is used in the third Symphony of Science installment &quot;Our Place in the Cosmos&quot;. Kaku is also a member of the CuriosityStream advisory board.

==Personal life==
Kaku is married to Shizue Kaku. They have two daughters.

He enjoys figure skating as a recreational hobby.

<doc id="348751" wikidata="Q1413204" url="?curid=348751" title="Monte Bolca">
<text>Monte Bolca is an Early Eocene-aged geologic site located near Verona, Italy. A &quot;Konservat-Lagerstätte&quot;, it contains an extremely well-preserved and diverse marine biota, including the most diverse fish fauna of any Cenozoic fossil site, as well as many of the earliest fossil occurrences of modern marine fish groups. It was one of the first fossil sites with high quality preservation known to Europeans, with studies of its biota dating back to the 18th century and earlier, and is still an important source of fossils.

==Geology==
The sediments comprising Monte Bolca were deposited in a shallow part of the Tethys Ocean during the late part of the Early Eocene, about 50 to 49 million years ago. These sediments were uplifted to their present elevation during the formation of the Alps, in two stages: one between 30 and 50 million years ago, and one 24 million years ago. The entire formation consists of of limestone, all of which contain fossils, but interspersed in which are the lagerstätte layers that contain the highly preserved specimens.

Within these layers, the fish and other specimens are so highly preserved that their organs are often completely intact in fossil form, and even the skin color can sometimes be determined. The normal rearrangement of the specimens caused by mud-dwelling organisms in the layer before it turned to stone has been avoided—it is assumed that the mud in question was low in oxygen, preventing both decay and the mixing action of scavengers.

==History==
Strictly speaking, the Monte Bolca site is one specific spot near the village of Bolca in Italy, known as the &quot;Pesciara&quot; (&quot;The Fishbowl&quot;) due to its many extraordinarily well preserved Eocene fish fossils. However, there are several other related outcroppings in the general vicinity that also carry similar fossils, such as Monte Postale and Monte Vegroni. The term Monte Bolca is used interchangeably to refer to the one, original site, or to all the sites collectively.

The fossils at Monte Bolca have been known since at least the 16th century, though the first extensive research was conducted on them by Giovanni Serafino Volta in the late 18th century. They were studied intensively in the 19th century once it was definitively proven that fossils were the remnants of dead animals.

Fossils from Monte Bolca are commonly available for sale by commercial fossil dealers, and due to their popularity and preservation regularly sell for several hundred dollars.

==Species in the formation==
=== Animal fossils ===
Monte Bolca is rich in fish: 250 species (140 genera, 90 families and 19 orders). Additionally a cephalopod, crustaceans, jellyfish and polychaete worms have been found whole, but foraminifera, molluscs, and corals are found in fragments and may have been transported. Bird feathers and tortoise shell plates have been found, as well as many insects, freshwater and land plants.

===Plant fossils===

One of the more interesting puzzles in ichnotaxonomy, pertains to fossils from Monte Bolca, originally named &quot;Zoophycos caput-medusae&quot;, previously thought to be trace fossils, were found to be plants instead and given the name Algarum by French zoologist Henri Milne-Edwards in 1866. The type specimen collected by Italian paleobotanist Abramo Bartolommeo Massalongo before 1855 is at the Natural History Museum of Verona and was preserved in a lithographic limestone upper and lower slab.

When Italian botanist Achille Forti (28 November 1878 Verona -11 February 1937 Verona) worked on the specimens in 1926, they were reinterpreted as close relatives of the sea palm, now known to be a brown algae, which had lived in the coastal waters of the Eocene sea. He renamed the species &quot;Postelsia caput-medusae&quot; which makes it related to the genus &quot;Postelsia&quot;, now with only one living species, which was described by its discoverer Franz Josef Ruprecht in 1852 as &quot;Postelsia palmaeformis&quot;. His type-specimen is from Bodega Bay, California, but the species is found along the Pacific coast. The appearance of the plant is a holdfast on the bottom, with a stem-like stipe between there and the fronds which are about to . In life, the fronds hang vertically when the tide is in but flop over the stipe when exposed by low tide.

Curiously, other specimens from this deposit collected and described by Massalongo in 1855 were actually trace fossils, only this one was a plant.

<doc id="348759" wikidata="Q16004" url="?curid=348759" title="Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg">
<text>Henri (; , ; born 16 April 1955) is Grand Duke of Luxembourg, reigning since 2000. He is the eldest son of Grand Duke Jean and Princess Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium, as well as a first cousin of King Philippe of Belgium. In 2019, his net worth was estimated around US$4 billion.

Having delegated some of his powers to his eldest son and heir apparent, Guillaume, in 2024, he is set to abdicate in his favour on 3 October 2025.

==Early life and education==
Prince Henri was born on 16 April 1955, at the Betzdorf Castle in Luxembourg as the second child and first son of Jean, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg, and his wife, Princess Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium. His father was the eldest son of Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, and Prince Félix of Bourbon-Parma. His mother was the only daughter of King Leopold III of Belgium by his first wife, Princess Astrid of Sweden. The prince&#x27;s godparents were his maternal uncle the Prince of Liège (later Albert II of Belgium) and his paternal aunt Princess Marie Gabriele.

Henri has four siblings: Archduchess Marie Astrid of Austria (born 1954), Prince Jean of Luxembourg (born 1957), Princess Margaretha of Liechtenstein (born 1957) and Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg (born 1963).

On 12 November 1964, when Henri was nine, his grandmother abdicated and his father became Grand Duke. By two sovereign decisions of 14 April 1973 the Grand Duke decided that &quot;Henri will be considered as having reached the age of majority as from 16 April 1973, the date on which he will have reached the age of eighteen years&quot; and &quot;that His Royal Highness Prince Henri will bear, in His capacity as Heir Apparent to the Crown of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and of the Grand-Ducal Trust, the title of Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg, Hereditary Prince of Nassau, Prince of Bourbon of Parma.&quot;

Henri was educated in Luxembourg and in France, where he obtained his Baccalauréat in 1974, after which he undertook military officer training at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, England on the Standard Military Course (SMC) 7. He then studied political science at University of Geneva and the Graduate Institute of International Studies, graduating in 1980.

Prince Henri became heir apparent to the Luxembourg throne on the abdication of his paternal grandmother, Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg, on 12 November 1964. From 1980 to 1998, he was a member of the Council of State.

==Reign==

===Accession===
On 4 March 1998, Prince Henri was appointed as lieutenant representative by his father, Grand Duke Jean, meaning that he assumed most of his father&#x27;s constitutional powers. On 7 October 2000, immediately following the abdication of his father, Henri acceded as Grand Duke of Luxembourg and took the constitutional oath before the Chamber of Deputies later that day. He became Henri I even though Luxembourg had 7 monarchs named Henri prior to 1815.

===Role and interests===

As the head of a constitutional monarchy, Grand Duke Henri&#x27;s duties are primarily representative. However, he retains the constitutional power to appoint the prime minister and government, to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies, to promulgate laws and to accredit ambassadors. With few exceptions, however, he is bound by convention to act on the advice of the government.

Grand Duke Henri is commander-in-chief of the Luxembourg Army, in which he holds the rank of general. In addition, he was made an honorary major in the British Army&#x27;s Parachute Regiment, effective 19 July 1989.

One of the grand duke&#x27;s main functions is to represent Luxembourg in the field of foreign affairs. In May 2001, Grand Duke Henri and Grand Duchess Maria Teresa undertook their first foreign state visit to Spain at the invitation of King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofía of Spain.

Grand Duke Henri is a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), a member of The Mentor Foundation (established by the World Health Organization) and a director of the Charles Darwin Trust for the Galápagos Islands.

The grand duke lives with his family at Berg Castle in Luxembourg. He also has a holiday home in Cabasson, a village in the commune of Bormes-les-Mimosas in Southern France.

===Media and publicity controversies===
Since the accession of Henri to the Grand Ducal Throne in 2000, the court&#x27;s approach to media and publicity has varied markedly. In 2002, Grand Duke Henri expressly identified himself with a press conference called by Maria Teresa with a view to discussing with journalists the shortcomings of her personal relations with her mother-in-law Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte.

In contrast, when the grand ducal couple&#x27;s first grandchild was born in 2006, the Court Circular pointedly omitted to mention the event, probably as the father Prince Louis was not married at the time. However, the pregnancy was announced in 2005, so the country was informed that the prince and his girlfriend were going to be parents. The press also had access to the child&#x27;s baptism.

The grand ducal family&#x27;s approach to media and publicity issues has given rise to media comment regarding the quality of communications advice which has been sought and followed. As well as the public airing of the difficulties between the grand duchess and her mother-in-law, several other events have resulted in adverse publicity, most notably: in 2004, the opening of parliament by the grand duke in person, the first time in over 100 years the monarch had done so; in 2005, the grand duke announced he intended to vote in favour of the European Constitution in the impending referendum, only to be reminded by senior politicians that he had no such right. The proposed sale of large tracts of the Gruenewald in the summer of 2006 was shortly followed by the proposed sale (cancelled shortly afterwards) at Sotheby&#x27;s of recently deceased Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte&#x27;s effects.

===Euthanasia and constitutional reform controversies===
On 2 December 2008, it was announced that Grand Duke Henri had stated he would refuse to give his assent to a new law on euthanasia that had been passed earlier in the year by the Chamber of Deputies. Under the constitution then, the grand duke &quot;sanctions and promulgates the laws&quot; meaning the need for the grand duke&#x27;s sanction or approval was required in order for laws to take effect. In the absence of clarity on the long-term implications for the constitutional position of the grand duke posed by such a refusal, it was announced by Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker that a constitutional amendment would be brought forward.

The Luxembourg ruling house had tried to block a decision by Parliament only once before, when Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde refused to sign a bill in 1912 to reduce the role of Roman Catholic priests within the education system. The ultimate solution was that the grand duke would be declared unable to perform his duty temporarily. This was similar to the &quot;escape route&quot; provided to his uncle King Baudouin of Belgium when he refused to sign an abortion law in 1991; thus the law could take effect without the signature of the grand duke, but also without the need to enact far-reaching changes in the constitution.

Article 34 of the constitution was subsequently amended to remove the term &quot;assent&quot;, leaving the relevant provision to read: &quot;The Grand Duke promulgates the laws...&quot; As a result, his signature is still needed but it is clear that his signature is automatic and that he has no freedom of decision. The head of state no longer has to &quot;sanction&quot; laws for them to take effect, as the officeholder merely promulgates them.

===Health issues===
On 3 February 2011, Henri was admitted to the Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg on falling ill. Shortly after, the grand ducal court issued a statement saying that he was to undergo an angioplasty. The day after, the communications chief announced that the procedure had been a success. &quot;The state of His Royal Highness&#x27; health is not disturbing,&quot; the statement read, before stating the grand duke may leave the hospital within the next few days. Although the reason has not formally been disclosed, it is reported that the grand duke felt ill after waking that day, and the court physician noticed circulation problems. It was then that he was rushed to hospital, to the cardiac unit, and was discharged the following day.

===Waringo report===
On 31 January 2020, the Waringo report was released, a governmental report on the internal workings of the monarchy that had been compiled by Jeannot Waringo, former Financial Director of Luxembourg. The report identified significant problems in terms of staff management at the Palace resulting in a high turnover rate and an atmosphere of fear. It noted that internal communications were almost nonexistent. Waringo indicated that the most important staff decisions were made by the Grand Duchess. There was no division of staff for personal use and that for official functions. Waringo was also not able to determine if the grand ducal couple&#x27;s private activities were financed by the State or not. The report calls for a reform of the monarchy.
The Court responded that &quot;(i)n the interests of greater transparency and modernization, the Court will contribute constructively to the implementation of the improvements proposed in this report.&quot;

===Abdication===

On 23 June 2024, his official birthday, Henri announced his plans to appoint his son Guillaume as lieutenant representative (regent) in October. Traditionally, this signals the Grand Duke&#x27;s intention to abdicate in the future. On 8 October, Guillaume was sworn in as lieutenant representative. On 24 December 2024, the Grand Duke announced in his Christmas message his intention to abdicate in favour of Hereditary Grand Duke Guillaume on 3 October 2025.

==Marriage and family==
While studying in Geneva, Henri met the Cuban-born María Teresa Mestre y Batista, who was also a political science student. They married in Luxembourg in a civil ceremony on 4 February 1981 and a religious ceremony on 14 February 1981 with the previous consent of the grand duke, dated 7 November 1980. The couple have five children and eight grandchildren:

<doc id="348762" wikidata="Q973685" url="?curid=348762" title="Mari language">
<text>The Mari language (, ; ), formerly known as the Cheremiss language, spoken by approximately 400,000 people, belongs to the Uralic language family. It is spoken primarily in the Mari Republic of the Russian Federation, as well as in the area along the Vyatka river basin and eastwards to the Urals. Mari speakers, known as the Mari, are found also in the Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Udmurtia, and Perm regions.

Mari is the titular and official language of its republic, alongside Russian.

The Mari language today has three standard forms: Hill Mari, Northwestern Mari, and Meadow Mari. The latter is predominant and spans the continuum Meadow Mari to Eastern Mari from the Republic into the Ural dialects of Bashkortostan, Sverdlovsk Oblast and Udmurtia), whereas the former, Hill Mari, shares a stronger affiliation with the Northwestern dialect (spoken in the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and parts of the Kirov Oblast). Both language forms use modified versions of Cyrillic script. For the non-native, Hill Mari, or Western Mari, can be recognized by its use of the special letters &quot;ӓ&quot; and &quot;ӹ&quot; in addition to the shared letters &quot;ӱ&quot; and &quot;ӧ&quot;, while Eastern and Meadow Mari utilize a special letter &quot;ҥ&quot;.

The use of two &quot;variants&quot;, as opposed to two &quot;languages&quot;, has been debated: Maris recognize the unity of the ethnic group, and the two forms are very close, but distinct enough to cause some problems with communication.

== Ethnonym and glottonym ==
The Mari language and people were known as &quot;Cheremis&quot; (, &quot;cheremisy&quot;, &quot;cheremisskiy yazyk&quot;). In medieval texts the variant forms Sarmys and Tsarmys are also found, as well as ; and , &quot;Śarmăs&quot; before the Russian Revolution. The term &quot;Mari&quot; comes from the Maris&#x27; autonym ().

== Sociolinguistic situation ==

Most Maris live in rural areas with slightly more than a quarter living in cities. In the republic&#x27;s capital, Yoshkar-Ola, the percentage of Maris is just over 23 percent. At the end of the 1980s (per the 1989 census) Maris numbered 670,868, of whom 80% (542,160) claimed Mari as their first language and 18.8% did not speak Mari. In the Mari Republic, 11.6% claimed Mari was not their first language. In a survey by the Mari Research Institute more than three quarters of Maris surveyed considered Mari language to be the most crucial marker of ethnic identity, followed by traditional culture (61%) and common historical past (22%), religion (16%), character and mentality (15%) and appearance (11%) (see Glukhov and Glukhov for details). A gradual downward trend towards assimilation to Russian has been noted for the Communist period: the 1926 census indicated more than 99% of Maris considered Mari their first language, declining to less than 81% in 1989. Some qualitative evidence of a reversal in recent years has been noted. 

There was no state support for Mari language in Imperial Russia, and with the exception of some enthusiasts and numerous ecclesiastical texts by the Russian Orthodox Church, there was almost no education in Mari language. After the October Revolution, there was a period of support of all lesser national cultures in the Soviet Union, but eventually Russification returned. While the development of Mari literary language continued, still, only elementary-school education was available in Mari in the Soviet period, with this policy ending in village schools in the 1970–1980s. The period of glasnost and perestroika in the 1990s opened opportunities for a revival of efforts expand the use of Mari in education and the public sphere. In the 1990s, the Mari language, alongside Russian, was proclaimed in the republican constitution to be an official language of Mari El. By the beginning of the 21st century, Mari language and literature was taught in 226 schools. At the History and Philology Department of the Mari State University and the Krupskaya Teachers&#x27; Training Institute (Yoshkar-Ola), more than half of the subjects are taught in Mari. However, by 2024, only 9% of ethnic Mari children where being taught Mari in just 81 schools.

== Dialects ==

The principal division between Mari varieties is the West and the East. According to the Soviet linguist Kovedyaeva (1976:9-15, 1993:163-164) the Mari macrolanguage is divided into four main dialects:
* Hill Mari, spoken mainly on the right upper bank of the Volga River around Kozmodemyansk (hence the name), but also on the left bank and in the mouth of Vetluga.
* Northwestern Mari
* Meadow Mari, spoken on the left Volgan bank on the central and eastern plain (&quot;meadow&quot;) of Mari El around the republican capital, Yoshkar-Ola.
* Eastern Mari is scattered to the east of Mari El from Vyatka through Kama to Ufa.
Each main dialect is divided into their own smaller local subdialects. Only Hill and Meadow Mari have their own literary written standard varieties, based on the dialects of Kozmodemyansk and Yoshkar-Ola respectively.

Eastern and Meadow Mari are often united as a Meadow-Eastern supra-dialect. Northwestern Mari is transitional between the Hill and Meadow dialects, and its phonology and morphology are closer to Hill Mari.

== Phonology ==
=== Vowels ===

# Only in Hill Mari
The schwa and its fronted counterpart are usually transcribed in Finno-Ugric transcription as &quot;ə̑&quot; (reduced mid unrounded vowel) and &quot;ə&quot; (reduced front unrounded vowel) respectively. The former has sometimes been transcribed in IPA as , but phonetically the vowel is most strongly distinguished by its short duration and reduced quality. Descriptions vary on the degree of backness and labialization.

The mid vowels , , have more reduced allophones , , at the end of a word.

==== Word prosody ====
Stress is not phonemic in Mari, but a dynamic stress system is exhibited phonetically, the stressed syllable being higher in pitch and amplitude and greater in length than an unstressed syllable. Generally, there is one prominent syllable per word and prominence may be found in any syllable of the word. Post- and prefixes behave as clitics, i.e., they do not have their own stress. For example, пӧ́рт (&quot;pört&quot;, &quot;house&quot;) гыч (&quot;gəč&quot;, &quot;out of&quot;) (); or му́ро (&quot;muro&quot;, &quot;song&quot;) дене (&quot;dene&quot;, &quot;with&quot;) ().

=== Consonants ===
Consonants are shown in Cyrillic, Latin, and the :

# Only in Russian loanwords, in Hill Mari also onomatopoeia and Chuvashian loanwords.
# Palatalisation is marked in different ways. A following a palatalised consonant is written as , and following a palatalised consonant is written as . If the vowel following a palatalised consonant is an е or an и, palatalisation is not marked at all. In other cases, the soft sign ь is used to mark palatalisation.
# The modified Cyrillic letter for the velar nasal () combines the Cyrillic letter with and , where the rightmost post of Н is conflated with the vertical post of : . Although Hill Mari has this sound too, this character is only used in Meadow Mari.
# In Russian loanwords and after nasals, are voiced stops. Word-finally and before a consonant, there is free variation between voiced fricatives () and voiceless stops .

=== Phonological processes ===

Like several other Uralic languages, Mari has vowel harmony. In addition to front/back harmony, Mari also features round/unround harmony. If the stressed vowel in the word is rounded, then the suffix will contain a rounded vowel: for example, кӱтӱ́ ([kyˈty] &#x27;herd&#x27;) becomes кӱтӱ́штӧ ([kyˈtyʃtø], &#x27;in the herd&#x27;); if the stressed vowel is unrounded, then the suffix will contain an unrounded vowel: ки́д ([kid], &#x27;hand&#x27;) becomes ки́дыште ([ˈkidəʃte], &#x27;in the hand&#x27;). If the stressed vowel is back, then the suffix will end in a back vowel: агу́р ([aˈgur], &#x27;whirlpool&#x27;) becomes агу́рышто ([aˈgurəʃto], &#x27;in the whirlpool&#x27;).

== Orthography ==

Mari is mostly written with the Cyrillic script.

== Declension ==

Like other Uralic languages, Mari is an agglutinating language. It lacks grammatical gender, and does not use articles.

=== Case ===
Meadow Mari has 9 productive cases, of which 3 are locative cases. The usage of the latter ones is restricted to inanimate objects.

Many cases, aside from their basic function, are used in other situations, such as in expressions of time.
* Nominative, used for subjects, predicatives and for other grammatical functions.
* Genitive, is used for possessive constructions.
* Dative, the indirect object&#x27;s case.
* Accusative, the direct object&#x27;s case.
* Comitative, used when a subject or an object can be split up into parts, or in adverbials expressing the involvement of an object in an action.
* Comparative, used to express the likeness to something.
* Inessive, used to state where something is.
* Illative, used to state where something is going.
* Lative, used to express into what something is going.

If a locative statement was to be made about an animate object, postpositions would be used.

Additionally, terms denoting family members have vocative forms. These are, however, not created with a specific paradigm, and only exist in a few pre-defined cases.

Hill Mari has these cases, plus the abessive case (of the form -де), which is used to form adverbials stating without the involvement or influence of which an action happens.

=== Number ===
Mari, though an agglutinative language, does not have a separate morpheme to signify plurality. There are three particles, which are attached to the end of words with a hyphen, used to signify plural.
* -влак (&quot;-vlak&quot;) – Standard plural form.
* -шамыч (&quot;-šamõč&quot;) – Alternative standard plural, used in many dialects. There is no difference in meaning between these two.
* -мыт (&quot;mət&quot;) – Sociative plural. Used to signify a group of people: the members of a family, a person and their family and friends.

=== Possessive suffixes ===
Every grammatical person in Mari has its own possessive suffix.

=== Additional suffixes ===
Additional particles, falling into none of the categories above, can be added to the very end of a word, giving it some additional meaning. For example, the suffix -ат &quot;(-at&quot;), means &#x27;also&#x27; or &#x27;too&#x27;.

=== Arrangement of suffixes ===
The arrangement of suffixes varies from case to case. Although the case suffixes are after the possessive suffixes in the genitive and the accusative, the opposite is the case for the locative cases. In the dative, both arrangements are possible.

There are many other arrangements in the plural—the position of the plural particle is flexible. The arrangement here is one commonly used possibility.

=== Comparison ===
Comparison happens with adjectives and adverbs. The comparative is formed with the suffix -рак (-rak). The superlative is formed by adding the word эн (en) in front.

== Conjugation ==
Morphologically, conjugation follows three tenses and three moods in Meadow Mari.

=== Conjugation types ===
In Meadow Mari, verbs can conjugate according to two conjugation types. These differ from each other in all forms but the infinitive and the third-person plural of the imperative. Unfortunately, the infinitive is the form denoted in dictionaries and word lists. It is, thus, necessary to either mark verb infinitives by their conjugation type in word lists, or to include a form in which the conjugation class is visible—usually, the first-person singular present, which ends in -ам (or -ям) for verbs in the first category, and in -ем (or -эм) for second-type verbs.

=== Tense ===
The three tenses of Mari verbs are:
# Present: The present tense is used for present and future actions, for states of being and for habitual actions, among others.
# First preterite: The first preterite is used to express observed, recent actions.
# Second preterite: The second preterite is used for actions that are in the more-distant past.

Additional tenses can be formed through periphrasis.
* First periphrastic imperfect
* Second periphrastic imperfect
* First periphrastic perfect
* Second periphrastic perfect

=== Mood ===
The moods are:
# Indicative: The indicative is used to express facts and positive beliefs. All intentions that a particular language does not categorize as another mood are classified as indicative. It can be formed in all persons, in all times.
# Imperative: The imperative expresses direct commands, requests, and prohibitions. It only exists in the present tense, and exists in all persons but the first person singular.
# Desiderative: The desiderative is used to express desires. It can be formed for all persons, in the present tense and in the two periphrastic imperfect.

=== Negation ===
Negation in Mari uses a &#x27;negative verb&#x27;, much like Finnish does. The negative verb is more versatile than the negative verb in Finnish (see Finnish grammar), existing in more grammatical tenses and moods. It has its own form in the present indicative, imperative and desiderative, and in the first preterite indicative. Other negations are periphrastic.

The negation verb in its corresponding form is put in front of the negated verb in its second-person singular (the stem-only form), much as it is in Finnish and Estonian.

The verb улаш (ulaš) – to be – has its own negated forms.

=== Example ===
In order to illustrate the conjugation in the respective moods and times, one verb of the first declination (лекташ – to go) and one verb of the second declination (мондаш – to forget) will be used.

# In the first conjugation, the imperative second-person singular is formed by removing the &quot;-аш&quot; ending from the infinitive. Four consonant combinations are not allowed at the end of an imperative, and are thus simplified—one consonant is lost. &lt;br&gt; &quot;кт&quot; → &quot;к&quot;, &quot;нч&quot; → &quot;ч&quot;, &quot;чк&quot; → &quot;ч&quot;, &quot;шк&quot; → &quot;ш&quot;

=== Infinitive forms ===
Verbs have two infinitive forms: the standard infinitive and the necessive infinitive, used when a person must do something. The person needing to do something is put in the dative in such a situation.

=== Participles ===
There are four participles in Meadow Mari:
* Active participle
* Passive participle
* Negative participle
* Future participle

=== Gerunds ===
There are five gerunds in Meadow Mari:
* Affirmative instructive gerund
* Negative instructive gerund
* Gerund for prior actions I
* Gerund for prior actions II
* Gerund for simultaneous actions

== Syntax ==
=== Word order ===
Word order in Mari is subject–object–verb. This means that the object appears directly before the predicate. Word order in Mari is affected by information structure. However, the position of the verb is not affected. The focus position is directly before the verb. Subjects, objects, adverbial, and secondary predicate can appear in this position. The examples below quoted in Saarinen (2022) show the different elements that can appear in the focus position.

&lt;section begin=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;
1PST:first preterite
2PST:second preterite
&lt;section end=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;

Question particles мо /mo/ and ма /mɑ/ are clause-final.

However, Georgieva et al. (2021) point out that Mari also allows backgrounded material to occur after the verb.

Moving the verb to other positions in the sentence is possible for stylistic reasons or for emphasis.

=== Nominal predication ===
Two nouns can be put against each other to form nominal predication. According to Saarinen (2022) both nouns and adjectives appear in the nominative case and do not agree with the subject in number in nominal predication. Saarinen (2022) notes that when the sentence is in the indicative mood with 3sg, a copula is not used. However, a copula is obligatory and appears clause-final and in other persons, tenses, and moods.

=== Verbal predication ===
Saarinen (2022) points out that the object is marked with the accusative in transitive clauses. However, the object can appear in the nominative case in non-finite constructions. When the clause is ditransitive, the direct object appears in the accusative case and the indirect takes the dative case. However, Saarinen (2022) notes that in dialects and with verbs such as йӱкты- /jyktə-/ &#x27;water&#x27; and пукшы- /pukʃə-/ &#x27;feed&#x27; both objects appear in the accusative case.

== Vocabulary ==
Note that the accent mark, which denotes the place of stress, is not used in actual Mari orthography.

<doc id="348775" wikidata="Q99864" url="?curid=348775" title="Freedom of the City">
<text>The Freedom of the City (or Borough in some parts of the UK) is an honour bestowed by a municipality upon a valued member of the community, or upon a visiting celebrity or dignitary. Arising from the medieval practice of granting respected citizens freedom from serfdom, the tradition still lives on in countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, Canada, South Africa and New Zealand—although today the title of &quot;freeman&quot; confers no special privileges. The Freedom of the City can also be granted by municipal authorities to military units which have earned the city&#x27;s trust; in this context, it is sometimes called the Freedom of Entry. This allows them the freedom to parade through the city, and is an affirmation of the bond between the regiment and the citizenry.

The honour was sometimes accompanied by a &quot;freedom box&quot;, a small gold box inscribed to record the occasion; these are not usual today. In some countries, such as the United States, esteemed residents and visitors may instead be presented with the Key to the City, a similarly symbolic honour. Other US cities award Honorary Citizenship with just a certificate.

==Military privilege==
Freedom of the City is an ancient honour granted to martial organisations, allowing them the privilege to march into the city &quot;with drums beating, colours flying, and bayonets fixed&quot;.

This honour dates back to ancient Rome which regarded the &quot;pomerium&quot;, the boundary of the city, as sacred. Promagistrates and generals were forbidden from entering it, and resigned their &quot;imperium&quot; immediately upon crossing it. An exception was made for victory celebrations (called triumphs), during which the victorious general would be permitted to enter for one day only. Under the Republic, soldiers also lost their status when entering, becoming citizens: thus soldiers at their general&#x27;s triumph wore civilian dress. Weapons were also banned inside the pomerium for religious and traditional reasons. (The assassination of Julius Caesar occurred outside this boundary.)

Similar laws were passed by other European cities throughout the Medieval era, to protect public security and civic rights, even against their own king&#x27;s troops. As a result, soldiers would be forced to camp outside the walls of the city during the winter months. The Freedom of the City was an honour granted only to troops which had earned the trust of the local populace, either through some valiant action or simply by being a familiar presence.

Today, martial freedom of the city is an entirely ceremonial honour, usually bestowed upon a unit with historic ties to the area, as a token of appreciation for their long and dedicated service. The awarding of the Freedom is often accompanied by a celebratory parade through the city.

==Entitlement to civil privileges==

A slightly more common freedom of the city is connected to the medieval concept of &quot;free status&quot;, when city and town charters drew a distinction between freemen and vassals of a feudal lord. As such, freemen actually pre-date modern boroughs. Early freedom of the boroughs ceremonies had great importance in affirming that the recipient enjoyed privileges such as the right to trade and own property, and protection within the town.

In modern society, the award of honorary freedom of the city or borough tends to be entirely ceremonial, given by the local government in many towns and cities on those who have served in some exceptional capacity, or upon any whom the city wishes to bestow an honour.

===United Kingdom===
Before parliamentary reform in 1832, freedom of the city or town conferred the right to vote in the parliamentary boroughs for the MPs. Until the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 the freemen were the exclusive electorate for some of the boroughs. These two acts together curtailed the power of the freemen and extended the franchise to all &quot;householders&quot; (defined as local rate payers; in fact therefore property owners). The private property belonging to the freemen collectively was retained. The freemen of York, Oxford and Newcastle upon Tyne still own considerable areas within their towns, although the income is effectively given to support charitable objects. The Local Government Act 1972 specifically preserved freemen&#x27;s rights. The Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 removed any restrictions entitling only men to be freemen.

Today, the grant of honorary freedom in the United Kingdom is governed by the Local Government Act 1972 (as amended by the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009). The 1972 Act enabled the councils of cities, royal boroughs, boroughs, and parishes (or, in Wales, communities) with the status of a royal town to confer the status of honorary freeman on &quot;persons of distinction and persons who have, in the opinion of the council, rendered eminent services&quot; to the local area. The 2009 Act extends the ability to grant the status of honorary freeman to any county, city, district, borough, town, parish or community council (so removing the requirement for the town to have &#x27;royal&#x27; status, and also enabling county councils to confer the honour). A special meeting of the council can grant the honour by passing a resolution with a two-thirds majority.

The exact qualifications for borough freedom differ between each city or town, but generally fall into two categories, &quot;patrimony&quot; (inheritance) and &quot;servitude&quot; (apprenticeship). For example, in Chester, only the children or grandchildren of freemen may apply for admission. In York, this extends to great- and great-great-grandchildren, and apprenticeship to a freeman of the city will also allow admission. In Great Grimsby, the widow of a freeman passes his rights to her second husband, who retains the privilege after either divorce from or death of the widow. The borough freedom is strongest in York, Chester, Newcastle upon Tyne and Coventry; in Coventry, freedom is qualified by having served an apprenticeship. Durham and Northampton have extended their admission criteria to those who have served an apprenticeship without being &quot;bound&quot; (trained) by a freeman directly. Freemen of Newcastle upon Tyne are bestowed the right to graze cattle on the town moor.

====Freedom of the City of Belfast====

Recipients of this honour have included athlete Mary Peters, actor Kenneth Branagh, diplomat John Jordan, industrialist Andrew Carnegie, shipowner Thomas Henry Ismay and Prime Minister Winston Churchill.

====Freedom of the City of London====

In England, the most established borough freedom is that conferred by the Freedom of the City of London, first recorded in 1237. This is closely tied to the role and status of the livery companies. From 1835, the freedom &quot;without the intervention of a Livery Company&quot; has been bestowed by a general resolution of Common Council, by &quot;redemption&quot; (purchase), at one time for an onerous sum. Now the Freedom can be obtained by servitude, by patrimony, by nomination, or by presentation via a Livery Company. Freedom through nomination by two sponsors is available for a fee (known as a &quot;fine&quot;) of but is free to those on the electoral roll of the City.

New freemen are enrolled in a ceremony in Guildhall, when they receive a guide to conducting their lives in an honourable fashion and a sealed certificate. Freemen&#x27;s children get admission preference at the City of London Freemen&#x27;s School. There are a number of rights traditionally but apocryphally associated with freemen—the right to drive sheep and cattle over London Bridge; to a silken rope, if hanged; to carry a naked sword in public; or that if the City of London Police finds a freeman drunk and incapable, they will bundle him or her into a taxi and send them home rather than throw them into a cell. While sheep have occasionally been driven over London Bridge by freemen on special occasions, these privileges are now effectively symbolic.

The right to herd sheep and cattle across London&#x27;s four bridges is no longer economically relevant, as there are no livestock markets in the city. Nevertheless, this right has been exercised, or the city has granted permission, on several occasions in modern times: 
* On 19 August 1999, Jef Smith, a freeman of London walked two sheep over Tower Bridge to bring attention to the rights of older citizens.
* On 17 June 2006, a flock of about thirty sheep was driven across the Millennium Bridge to mark the start of London Architecture Week.
* On 31 August 2008, Amanda Cottrell, former High Sheriff of Kent, marched six rams across London Bridge to promote fundraising for the restoration of Canterbury Cathedral and &quot;a scheme backing local food production&quot;.
* On 17 September 2008, the Lord Mayor of London, David Lewis, and some 500 freemen drove a flock of Romney ewes in relay across London Bridge to raise funds for the Lord Mayor&#x27;s charities (Orbis and Wellbeing of Women).
* On 7 April 2013, actor and presenter Stephen Fry drove Grace, a year-old lamb, over London Bridge for a documentary about becoming a freeman, &quot;Stephen Fry&#x27;s Key To The City&quot;.
*On 27 April 2019, freeman of the city Simone Lakmaker drove Mark, a ram from Spitalfields City Farm, over London Bridge as part of her 80th birthday celebrations and to raise awareness for her charity the Speaking Out Forum.

By 2015, the driving of sheep across the bridge had become an annual event, organised by the Worshipful Company of Woolmen livery company, typically to raise funds for the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Appeal and the Worshipful Company of Woolmen.
====Freedom of the City of York====
York has a long history of freemen dating back to the Anglo-Saxon period, with records dating back to 1272. Freemen may claim their rights through patronage (as far back as their great-great-grandparent, there are records of women being admitted in York in medieval times, a right forgotten for a time until the late 1970s when the gild carried out research and rediscovered it) or apprenticeship. Once sworn in, freemen can join the Gild (archaic spelling used) of Freemen who continue to take an interest in the affairs of the city. New admissions are made every year (usually October) following an admission ceremony with the Lord Mayor at the Guildhall. Prince Andrew, Duke of York was given the honour in 1986, but a councillors&#x27; vote stripped him of the title after allegations of sexual abuse became public.

===Republic of Ireland===
In Ireland, borough freedom of the city is generally given to noted foreign and national dignitaries and the list rarely exceeds a few dozen. As in the United Kingdom, the title generally comes with various ancient privileges – for instance, freemen of Dublin are allowed the right to vote in certain elections, bring goods for sale in the city without customs and the right to pasture sheep on common ground such as College Green and St. Stephen&#x27;s Green.

===Canada===
Freedom of the City is a privilege bestowed to individual units of the Canadian Forces. Many units exercise this privilege in conjunction with significant annual commemorations. The Calgary Highlanders commemorate the Battle of Kitcheners&#x27; Wood with an annual freedom of the city parade.

==Key to the city==



In some countries, such as the United States, an ornamental key – the &quot;key to the city&quot; – is presented to esteemed visitors, residents, or others whom the city wishes to honour. This practice is a variation on the freedom of the city tradition, and has a similar symbolic meaning; evoking medieval walled cities, the gates of which would be guarded during the day and locked at night, the key symbolises the freedom of the recipient to enter and leave the city at will, as a trusted friend of city residents.

In some cities in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, the key to the city is given to the so-called &quot; who leads the carnivals which take place the week prior to Septuagesima. The tradition is that the mayor steps down for this period and power is transferred to the prince carnival, who then returns the key at the end of Shrove Tuesday / Mardi Gras. Today, the handing over of the key is mostly symbolic and marks the start and end of the carnival.

A similar tradition exists in some festivities in Latin America (like in Rio Carnival), where the festival&#x27;s King Momo receives the key to the city at the start of the festivities. 

As part of the yearly Gasparilla Pirate Festival in Tampa, Florida a friendly invasion by the crew of the mythical pirate José Gaspar is recreated where costumed pirates make their way to the Tampa Convention Center and they demand that the mayor surrender the key to the city in a playful ceremony.

In Canada, major cities including Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal may award a key to the city to influential business leaders, musicians, and political leaders. In 2016, the Canadian recording artist Drake received a key to the city of Toronto, presented by the mayor John Tory. In a local tradition, Calgary has opted to award esteemed visitors a symbolic cowboy hat instead of a key; this is usually followed by reciting one of two oaths (one formal, the other more silly) to become honorary Calgarians.

<doc id="348777" wikidata="Q734453" url="?curid=348777" title="Pevensey">
<text>Pevensey ( ) is a village and civil parish in the Wealden district of East Sussex, England. The main village is located north-east of Eastbourne, one mile (1.6 km) inland from Pevensey Bay. The settlement of Pevensey Bay forms part of the parish. It was here that William the Conqueror made the landing in his invasion of England in 1066 after crossing the English Channel from Normandy.

==Geography==
Pevensey is situated on a spur of sand and clay, about above sea level. In Roman times this spur was a peninsula that projected into a tidal lagoon and marshes. A small river, Pevensey Haven, runs along the north side of the peninsula and would originally have discharged into the lagoon, but is now largely silted up. The lagoon extended inland as far north as Hailsham and eastwards to Hooe. With the effect of longshore drift this large bay was gradually cut off from the sea by shingle, so that today&#x27;s marshes are all that remain behind the shingle beach.

The marshes, known as the Pevensey Levels, cover an area of around . The marshes are a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a large nature reserve, jointly owned by Natural England and the Sussex Wildlife Trust. There are many nationally rare plants and invertebrates, including the fen raft spider. The site is very fragile and general access is not permitted.

Pevensey is also the start point of the 1066 Country Walk which is a long-distance footpath covering many historical sites in the area.

===Pevensey Bay===
The settlement of Pevensey Bay lies behind and on the shingle beach. Although small, it is nevertheless a seaside resort in miniature and has many of the facilities of its larger counterparts elsewhere. It is a clay bay, making it susceptible to erosion over time. The shingle beach at Pevensey Bay provides an important defence against flooding and storm damage from the sea for a large area of low-lying land beyond. There are two Martello towers, constructed in 1806 as Napoleonic coastal defences. Before development commenced it was known as Wallsend; the 16th century Castle Hotel standing alone on the beach.

==Name==
The earliest evidence for the name &quot;Pevensey&quot; is in later copies of charters dated to 788 and 790, and the name occurs in a variety of forms, including &quot;Pefensea&quot;, &quot;Pæfensea&quot; and &quot;Pævenisel&quot;. The name means &quot;River of [a man named] Pefen&quot; and derives from the Anglo-Saxon personal name &quot;Pefen&quot; plus &quot;eã&quot;, &quot;river&quot;, presumably a reference to the now largely silted-up Pevensey Haven. The spellings &quot;Pemse&quot; and &quot;Pemsey&quot; indicate the local pronunciation , .

==History==

===Roman fort===

By the 4th century AD the south and east of the province of Britannia was under frequent attack from marauding barbarian tribes: including the Jutes and Saxons. To counter these attacks the Romans built a total of eleven forts between Essex and the Isle of Wight, now known as the &quot;Saxon Shore Forts&quot;. The fort at Pevensey, built between AD 300 and 340, was named Anderitum. The earliest stone remains on the site date from the Roman period, including the outer bailey wall. The sea washed over what is now Pevensey Marshes, surrounding the fort on three sides.

When the Roman army left Britain, the province was more vulnerable to attack, first by the Jutes in east Kent, and the Romanised native Britons attempted to defend their island from attack. Following the Jutish example the Saxons began invading Britain in earnest. Around 491, Saxons, possibly led by Ælle of Sussex began to colonise the south coast and besieged Anderitum over a number of years. After a long struggle the British defences were overrun. Some remaining Britons on the south coast fled north, others emigrated by boat to what is now called Brittany and the area became the Kingdom of the South Saxons, later called Sussex. The old Roman fort of Anderida was burned and left derelict. For a while the ruined castle was known by the Saxons as Andredceaster and the Weald of southern England – which stretches 120 miles (200 km) from Anderida to Dorset – was named Andredsweald, the Forest of Anderida.

The fort probably remained derelict until, in 1042, Harold Godwinson, later Harold II of England, established a stronghold here, improving fortifications by digging ditches within the walls of the fort. The English army remained at the fort during the summer of 1066 before abandoning it to meet the invading Norwegians further north.

When William the Conqueror invaded Sussex in September 1066 there were no defenders at Pevensey and the bay provided a safe haven for the invading fleet.

=== Castle ===
In late 1066 the Roman fort at Pevensey was occupied by the Normans; much of the Roman stonework still existing today is due largely to the work of Robert, Count of Mortain (half brother to William), who was granted Pevensey Castle shortly after the Norman Conquest. Robert de Mortain used the remains as the base for building his castle, carrying out only minor repairs to the walls forming the outer bailey, and building a new inner bailey at the eastern end.

At the time of the Domesday survey of 1086, Pevensey was a significant settlement of 110 households and a mill.

The castle was besieged several times during the 11th–13th centuries. An order by Queen Elizabeth I that it be demolished and an attempt at demolition during the Puritan times were both unsuccessful: the order was ignored and only a few stones were removed on the two occasions. As late as 1942 small additions were made to the castle for the defence of Britain, when it was used to spot German aircraft during World War II.

Today the castle is in the upkeep of English Heritage.

===Liberty of Pevensey===
The Liberty (or Lowey) of Pevensey was an ancient now obsolete hundred, containing the parishes of Westham and Pevensey. They were entirely within the Levels and together regarded as constituting part of the port of Hastings, and consequently would be entitled to all the privileges and immunities enjoyed by the Cinque Ports and not part of the county of Sussex jurisdiction. This would have been the case until the system of hundreds as administration divisions was abandoned in the 19th century.

===Other historic events===
In the 16th century Pevensey became what was known as a &quot;non-corporate limb&quot; of the Hastings, as part of the Confederation of the Cinque Ports. Along with most of the other Ports, its importance dwindled as the ports themselves became disconnected from the sea: Pevensey was two miles (3.2 km) distant.

During the 18th and 19th centuries Pevensey Bay became involved in the south coast smuggling trade, since it was one of the easier places to land the contraband. In 1833 a violent clash occurred between the smugglers and customs men at Pevensey Bay.

Some of the more than 100 Martello towers were erected along the beaches of Pevensey Bay at the beginning of the 19th century against Napoleonic attack.

==Governance==

In 1207 the town was granted a royal charter by King John and was governed by Pevensey Corporation. With the decline in the town&#x27;s importance by the 19th century, the Corporation was eventually dissolved in 1886 and the town lost its borough status. The records of the Corporation are held in the East Sussex Record Office at Brighton, and a voluntary body, the Pevensey Town Trust, was formed to manage the property which had formerly belonged to the Corporation, most notably Pevensey Court House.

Pevensey is now a village, with a parish council consisting of twelve elected councillors. Three councillors are elected to the Wealden District Council to represent Pevensey; the Member of Parliament is Kieran Mullan, who represents the Bexhill and Battle Constituency, of which Pevensey is part. Pevensey is also part of the electoral ward called Pevensey and Westham. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 9,467.

==Religious buildings==
Within the parish are the Anglican parish church dedicated to
St Nicolas; St Wilfrid&#x27;s church, Pevensey Bay; the Wesleyan Methodist church, the Pevensey Bay Free Church, and Holy Rood Catholic church, Pevensey Bay.

==Historic buildings==
Pevensey has 23 buildings of historic significance listed by English Heritage including the Grade I listed St Nicolas church and the Grade II* listed Old Mint House. In 2022 the Old Mint House was added to English Heritage&#x27;s list of buildings at risk of disrepair.

==Transport==
The A259 road passes through Pevensey. Two railway stations serve the area: Pevensey and Westham and Pevensey Bay. 

==Culture==

===Pevensey in the arts===
*J. M. W. Turner painted Pevensey Castle.
*Pevensey features several times in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Puck of Pook&#x27;s Hill&quot; (1907). Kipling&#x27;s characters describe it as &quot;England&#x27;s Gate&quot;, the reason for this being the above history. Kipling lived near to Pevensey at Burwash, and the area is described in his autobiography.
*The fall of Anderitum, now Pevensey, in the final years of Roman occupation features in the 1875 novel &quot;Anderida: or the Briton and the Saxon, A. D. CCCCXLI&quot; by Thomas Burnside Crowther. He drew on the account in Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;.
*Pevensey features in &quot;The Saxon Shore&quot; (1983), a book of photographs by photographer Fay Godwin.
*Pevensey is the setting for parts of George Gissing&#x27;s 1887 novel &quot;Thyrza&quot;, with an especially fine description in Chapter XLI, &quot;The Living&quot;.
*Robert Sheldon composed &quot;Pevensey Castle&quot;, published by C.L. Barnhouse in 1993.
*Pevensey, and in particular Pevensey Bay, feature in the 1946 crime novel &quot;Uneasy Terms&quot; by best selling author Peter Cheyney. In Chapter 7 the hero, a private detective called Slim Callaghan, goes for a ride out on Pevensey Bay with the alluring murder suspect, Corinne Alardyse.
*Pevensey Bay was the landing place of Gibreel Farishta and Saladin Chamcha in Salman Rushdie&#x27;s &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;.
*Pevensey was mentioned in the memoirs of comedian Spike Milligan. Based at nearby Bexhill, Pevensey’s Martello Tower was one of three Observation Posts to which Milligan and his fellow signallers were assigned during the Second World War and featured in Milligan&#x27;s book &quot;Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall&quot;. According to Milligan, it was preferred to the other two: ‘’Most of us tried for the Martello on Pevensey Beach as the local birds were easier to lay, but you had to be quick because of the tides.’’ Milligan does not clarify which of the three towers in Pevensey was used.

==Sport==
Pevensey Bay Sailing Club offers a variety of classes of boats: the club played a leading role in the development of the National 12 and Merlin Rocket Development Class racing dinghies in the 1970s when it was the home club of Phil Morrison, the British yacht designer and father of Stevie Morrison, a British Olympic 49er sailor in the 2008 games. The village also has a village cricket team.

<text>Pterichthyodes is a genus of antiarch placoderm fishes from the Devonian period. Its fossils have been discovered in Scotland. They were one of the first species recognized for what they were, as their fossils are common in the Old Red Sandstone formation studied by geologists in the early 19th century. Due to their extreme divergence from modern-day fish, they were a puzzle unsolved until Charles Darwin brought forward his theories on evolution.

== Description ==

As with all other antiarchs, &quot;Pterichthyodes&quot; had heavily armored heads and forebodies, while their scaly tails were unarmored. Specimen length ranges from to . As placoderms, they were members of the earliest known vertebrates to possess jaws, though they had grinding plates rather than teeth. The generic name of &quot;Pterichthyodes&quot; refers directly to their odd wing-like appendages (&quot;pterichthys&quot; being a compound crassis word from Ancient Greek for &quot;wing-fish&quot;), which correspond to and were derived from the pectoral fins seen in modern fish and other non-antiarch placoderms. Fossils of &quot;Pterichtyodes&quot; showing eyes positioned on the direct of the head and a &quot;ventrally flattened trunk shield&quot; suggest that it was a &quot;bottom dweller&quot;, living at the bottom of lakes, where it might have crawled using its pectoral appendages. It has also been theorized that &quot;Pterichthyodes&quot; and other antiarchs used these appendages to bury itself.

&quot;Pterichthyodes&quot; would have fed by browsing shallower areas of the lake bed for decaying detritus.

<doc id="348780" wikidata="Q852586" url="?curid=348780" title="Proof that e is irrational">
<text>The number &quot;e&quot; was introduced by Jacob Bernoulli in 1683. More than half a century later, Euler, who had been a student of Jacob&#x27;s younger brother Johann, proved that &quot;e&quot; is irrational; that is, that it cannot be expressed as the quotient of two integers.

==Euler&#x27;s proof==
Euler wrote the first proof of the fact that &quot;e&quot; is irrational in 1737 (but the text was only published seven years later). He computed the representation of &quot;e&quot; as a simple continued fraction, which is

:formula_1

Since this continued fraction is infinite and every rational number has a terminating continued fraction, &quot;e&quot; is irrational. A short proof of the previous equality is known. Since the simple continued fraction of &quot;e&quot; is not periodic, this also proves that &quot;e&quot; is not a root of a quadratic polynomial with rational coefficients; in particular, &quot;e&quot;2 is irrational.

==Fourier&#x27;s proof==
The most well-known proof is Joseph Fourier&#x27;s proof by contradiction, which is based upon the equality

: formula_2

Initially &quot;e&quot; is assumed to be a rational number of the form . The idea is to then analyze the scaled-up difference (here denoted &quot;x&quot;) between the series representation of &quot;e&quot; and its strictly smaller partial sum, which approximates the limiting value &quot;e&quot;. By choosing the scale factor to be the factorial of &quot;b&quot;, the fraction and the partial sum are turned into integers, hence &quot;x&quot; must be a positive integer. However, the fast convergence of the series representation implies that &quot;x&quot; is still strictly smaller than 1. From this contradiction we deduce that &quot;e&quot; is irrational.

Now for the details. If &quot;e&quot; is a rational number, there exist positive integers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; such that . Define the number

: formula_3

Use the assumption that &quot;e&quot; = to obtain

: formula_4

The first term is an integer, and every fraction in the sum is actually an integer because for each term. Therefore, under the assumption that &quot;e&quot; is rational, &quot;x&quot; is an integer.

We now prove that . First, to prove that &quot;x&quot; is strictly positive, we insert the above series representation of &quot;e&quot; into the definition of &quot;x&quot; and obtain

: formula_5

because all the terms are strictly positive.

We now prove that . For all terms with we have the upper estimate

: formula_6

This inequality is strict for every . Changing the index of summation to and using the formula for the infinite geometric series, we obtain

:formula_7

And therefore formula_8

Since there is no integer strictly between 0 and 1, we have reached a contradiction, and so &quot;e&quot; is irrational, Q.E.D.

==Alternate proofs==
Another proof can be obtained from the previous one by noting that

: formula_9

and this inequality is equivalent to the assertion that &quot;bx&quot; &lt; 1. This is impossible, of course, since &quot;b&quot; and &quot;x&quot; are positive integers.

Still another proof can be obtained from the fact that

: formula_10

Define formula_11 as follows:

: formula_12

Then

: formula_13

which implies

: formula_14 

for any positive integer formula_15.

Note that formula_16 is always an integer. Assume that formula_17 is rational, so formula_18 where formula_19 are co-prime, and formula_20 It is possible to appropriately choose formula_15 so that formula_22 is an integer, i.e. formula_23 Hence, for this choice, the difference between formula_22 and formula_16 would be an integer. But from the above inequality, that is not possible. So, formula_17 is irrational. This means that formula_27 is irrational.

==Generalizations==
In 1840, Liouville published a proof of the fact that &quot;e&quot;2 is irrational followed by a proof that &quot;e&quot;2 is not a root of a second-degree polynomial with rational coefficients. This last fact implies that &quot;e&quot;4 is irrational. His proofs are similar to Fourier&#x27;s proof of the irrationality of &quot;e&quot;. In 1891, Hurwitz explained how it is possible to prove along the same line of ideas that &quot;e&quot; is not a root of a third-degree polynomial with rational coefficients, which implies that &quot;e&quot;3 is irrational. More generally, &quot;e&quot;&quot;q&quot; is irrational for any non-zero rational &quot;q&quot;.

Charles Hermite further proved that &quot;e&quot; is a transcendental number, in 1873, which means that is not a root of any polynomial with rational coefficients, as is for any non-zero algebraic &quot;α&quot;.

<text>Yemenite Jews, also known as Yemeni Jews or Teimanim (from ; ), are Jews who live, or once lived, in Yemen, and their descendants maintaining their customs. After several waves of persecution, the vast majority of Yemenite Jews emigrated to Israel in Operation Magic Carpet between June 1949 and September 1950. Most Yemenite Jews now live in Israel, with smaller communities in the United States and elsewhere. As of 2024, only one Jew, Levi Marhabi, remains in Yemen, although &quot;Ynet&quot; cited local sources stating that the actual number is five.

Yemenite Jews observe a unique religious tradition that distinguishes them from Ashkenazi Jews, Sephardic Jews, and other Jewish groups. They have been described as &quot;the most Jewish of all Jews&quot; and &quot;the ones who have preserved the Hebrew language the best&quot;. Yemenite Jews are considered Mizrahi or &quot;Eastern&quot; Jews, though they differ from other Mizrahis, who have undergone a process of total or partial assimilation to Sephardic law and customs. While the Shami sub-group of Yemenite Jews did adopt a Sephardic-influenced rite, this was mostly due to it being forced upon them, and did not reflect a demographic or general cultural shift among the vast majority of Yemenite Jews.

==History==
===Ancient history===
Records referring to Judaism in Yemen started to appear during the rule of the Himyarite Kingdom, which was established in Yemen in 110 BCE. Various inscriptions in the Ancient South Arabian script in the 2nd century CE refer to the construction of synagogues approved by Himyarite kings.

In the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 132 CE, there was significant Jewish emigration from Roman Judea to Yemen, which was then famous in the Greco-Roman world for its prosperous trade, particularly in spices. The Christian missionary Theophilos the Indian, who came to Yemen in the mid-fourth century, complained that he had found great numbers of Jews.

By 380 CE, Himyarite religious practices had undergone fundamental changes. The inscriptions were no longer addressed to Almaqah or Attar but to a single deity called Rahmanan. Debate among scholars continues as to whether the Himyarite monotheism was influenced by Judaism or Christianity. Jews became especially numerous and powerful in the southern part of Arabia, a rich and fertile land of incense and spices and a way station on the incense trade route and the trade routes to Africa, India, and East Asia. The Yemeni tribes did not oppose the Jewish presence in their country.

====Dynastic conversion to Judaism====

In 390 CE, the Himyarite king Abu Karib led a military campaign northwards and fought the Jews of Yathrib. When Abu Karib fell ill, two local Jewish scholars named Kaab and Assad took the opportunity to travel to his camp, where they treated him and persuaded him to lift the siege. The scholars also inspired in the king an interest in Judaism, and he converted in 390, persuading his army to do likewise. With this, the Himyarite kingdom, &quot;the dominant power on the Arabian peninsula&quot;, was converted to Judaism. In Yemen, several inscriptions dating back to the 4th and 5th centuries CE have been found in Hebrew and Sabaean praising the ruling house in Jewish terms for &quot;helping and empowering the People of Israel&quot;.

====Abu Nuwas and intercommunal unrest====
By 516 AD, tribal unrest broke out, and several tribal elites fought for power. One of those elites was Joseph Dhu Nuwas or &quot;Yûsuf &#x27;As&#x27;ar Yaṯ&#x27;ar&quot; as mentioned in ancient south Arabian inscriptions. The actual story of Joseph is murky. Greek and Ethiopian accounts, portray him as a Jewish zealot. Some scholars suggest that he was a converted Jew. Church of the East accounts claim that his mother was a Jew taken captive from Nisibis and bought by a king in Yemen, whose ancestors had formerly converted to Judaism. Syriac and Byzantine sources maintain that Yûsuf &#x27;As&#x27;ar sought to convert other Yemeni Christians, but they refused to renounce Christianity. The actual picture, however, remains unclear.

In 2009 a BBC broadcast defended a claim that Yûsuf &#x27;As&#x27;ar offered villagers the choice between conversion to Judaism or death and then massacred 20,000 Christians. The program&#x27;s producers stated that, &quot;The production team spoke to many historians over 18 months, among them Nigel Groom, who was our consultant, and Professor Abdul Rahman Al-Ansary [former professor of archaeology at the King Saud University in Riyadh].&quot; Inscriptions attributed to Yûsuf &#x27;As&#x27;ar himself show the great pride he expressed after killing more than 22,000 Christians in Ẓafār and Najran. According to Jamme, Sabaean inscriptions reveal that the combined war booty (excluding deaths) from campaigns waged against the Abyssinians in Ẓafār, the fighters in &#x27;Ašʻarān, Rakbān, Farasān, Muḥwān (Mocha), and the fighters and military units in Najran, amounted to 12,500 war trophies, 11,000 captives and 290,000 camels and bovines and sheep.

Historian Glen Bowersock described this as a &quot;savage pogrom that the Jewish king of the Arabs launched against the Christians in the city of Najran. The king himself reported in excruciating detail to his Arab and Persian allies about the massacres he had inflicted on all Christians who refused to convert to Judaism.&quot; There were also reports of massacres and destruction of places of worship by Christians, too. Francis Edward Peters wrote that while there is no doubt that this was a religious persecution, it is equally clear that a political struggle was going on as well.

According to &#x27;Irfan Shahid&#x27;s &quot;Martyrs of Najran – New Documents&quot;, Dhu-Nuwas sent an army of some 120,000 soldiers to lay siege to the city of Najran, which lasted for six months, with the city finally taken and burnt on the 15th day of the seventh month (i.e. the lunar month Tishri). The city had revolted against the king and they refused to deliver it up unto the king. About three hundred of the city&#x27;s inhabitants surrendered to the king&#x27;s forces, under the assurances of an oath that no harm would come to them, and these were later bound, while those remaining in the city were burnt alive within their church. The death toll in this account is said to have reached about two thousand. However, in the Sabaean inscriptions describing these events, it is reported that by the month Dhu-Madra&#x27;an (between July and September) there were &quot;1000 killed, 1500 prisoners [taken] and 10,000 head of cattle.&quot;
There are two dates mentioned in the &quot;letter of Simeon of Beit Aršam.&quot; One date indicates the letter was written in Tammuz in the year 830 of Alexander (518/519 CE), from the camp of GBALA (Jebala), king of the &#x27;SNYA (Ghassanids or the Ġassān clan). In it, he tells of the events that transpired in Najran, while the other date puts the letter&#x27;s composition in the year 835 of Alexander (523/524 CE). The second letter, however, is actually a Syriac copy of the original, copied in the year 1490 of the Seleucid Era (= 1178/79 CE). Today, it is largely agreed that the latter date is the accurate one, as it is confirmed by the Martyrium Arethae, as well as by epigraphic records, namely Sabaean inscriptions discovered in the Asir of Saudi Arabia (Bi&#x27;r Ḥimâ), photographed by J. Ryckmans in Ry 507, 8 ~ 9, and by A. Jamme in Ja 1028, which give the old Sabaean year 633 for these operations (said to correspond with 523 CE).

Procopius, John of Ephesus, and other contemporary historians recount Kaleb&#x27;s invasion of Yemen around 520, against the Himyarite king Yūsuf As&#x27;ar Yath&#x27;ar, known as Dhu Nuwas, a Jewish convert who was persecuting the Christian community of Najran. After much fighting, Kaleb&#x27;s soldiers eventually routed Yusuf&#x27;s forces. They killed the king, allowing Kaleb to appoint Sumyafa Ashwa, a native Christian (named Esimiphaios by Procopius), as his viceroy of Himyar.

Aksumite control of Arabia Felix continued until c. 525 when Sumyafa Ashwa was deposed by the Abyssinian General Abraha, who made himself king. Procopius states that Kaleb made several unsuccessful attempts to recover his overseas territory; however, his successor later negotiated a peace with Abraha, where Abraha acknowledged the Axumite king&#x27;s authority and paid tribute. Stuart Munro-Hay opines that by this expedition Axum overextended itself, and this final intervention across the Red Sea, &quot;was Aksum&#x27;s swan-song as a great power in the region.&quot;

====Tradition====
There are numerous accounts and traditions concerning the arrival of Jews in various regions in Southern Arabia. One tradition suggests that King Solomon sent Jewish merchant marines to Yemen to prospect for gold and silver with which to adorn his Temple in Jerusalem. In 1881, the French vice consulate in Yemen wrote to the leaders of the Alliance (the Alliance Israelite Universelle) in France, that he read in a book by the Arab historian Abu-Alfada that the Jews of Yemen settled in the area in 1451 BCE.

Another legend says that Yemeni tribes converted to Judaism after the Queen of Sheba&#x27;s visit to King Solomon. The Sanaite Jews have a tradition that their ancestors settled in Yemen 42 years before the destruction of the First Temple. It is said that under the prophet Jeremiah some 75,000 Jews, including priests and Levites, traveled to Yemen.

Another legend states that when Ezra commanded the Jews to return to Jerusalem they disobeyed, whereupon he pronounced a ban upon them. According to this legend, as a punishment for this hasty action, Ezra was denied burial in Israel. As a result of this local tradition, which cannot be validated historically, it is said that no Jew of Yemen gives the name of Ezra to a child, although all other Biblical appellatives are used. The Yemenite Jews claim that Ezra cursed them to be a poor people for not heeding his call. This seems to have come true in the eyes of some Yemenites, as Yemen is extremely poor. However, some Yemenite sages in Israel today emphatically reject this story as myth, if not outright blasphemy.

Because of Yemenite Jewry&#x27;s cultural affiliation with Babylon, historian Yehuda Ratzaby opines that the Jews of Yemen migrated to Yemen from places in Babylonia. According to local legends, the kingdom&#x27;s aristocracy converted to Judaism in the 6th century CE.

===Middle Ages===

====Jewish–Muslim relations in Yemen====

As People of the Book, Jews were assured freedom of religion in exchange for payment of the jizya or poll tax, which was imposed on non-Muslim monotheists. Feudal overlords imposed this annual tax upon Jews, which, under Islamic law, was to ensure their status as protected persons of the state. This tax (tribute) was assessed against every male thirteen years and older and its remittance varied between the wealthy and the poor. In the early 20th century, this amounted to one Maria Theresa thaler (&quot;riyal&quot;) for a poor man, two thalers in specie for the middle classes, and four or more thalers for the rich. Upon payment, Jews were also exempt from paying the &quot;zakat&quot; which must be paid by Muslims once their residual wealth reaches a certain threshold.

Active persecution of Jews did not gain full force until a Zaydi clan seized power from the more tolerant Sunni Muslims, early in the 10th century. The legal status of Jews in Yemen started to deteriorate around the time the Tahirids took Sana&#x27;a from Zaidis, mainly because of new discrimination established by the Muslim rulers. Such laws were not included in Zaidi legal writings till comparatively late with &quot;Kitab al-Azhar&quot; of al-Mahdi Ahmad bin Yahya in the first half of the 15th century. This also led to deterioration of the economic and social situation of Jews.

Jewish intellectuals wrote in both Hebrew and Arabic and engaged in the same literary endeavours as the Muslim majority. According to a late-9th-century document, the first Zaydi imam al-Hadi ila&#x27;l-Haqq Yahya had imposed limitations and a special tax on land held by Jews and Christians of Najran. In the mid-11th century, Jews from several communities in the Yemen highlands, including Sanaʿa, appear to have been attracted to the Sulayhids&#x27; capital of Dhu Jibla. The city was founded by Abdullah bin Muhammad al-Sulaihi in the mid-11th century, and according to &quot;Tarikh al-Yamman&quot; of the famed Yemenite author Umara al-Yamani (1121–74), was named after a Jewish pottery merchant.

During the 12th century, Aden was first ruled by the Fatimid Caliphate and then the Ayyubids. The city formed a great emporium on the sea route to India. Documents of the Cairo Geniza about Aden reflect a thriving Jewish community led by the prominent Bundar family. Abu Ali Hasan ibn Bundar served as the head of the Jewish communities in Yemen as well as a representative of the merchants in Aden. His son Madmun was the central figure in Yemenite Jewry during the flourishing of trade with India. The Bundar family produced some celebrated &quot;negidim&quot; who exerted authority over the Jews of Yemen as well as Jewish merchants in India and Ceylon. The community developed communal and spiritual connections in addition to business and family ties with other Jewish communities in the Islamic world. They also developed ties with and funded Jewish centers in Iraq, Palestine, and Egypt. Due to the trade, Jews also emigrated to Aden for mercantile and personal reasons.

Yemenite Jews experienced violent persecution at times. In the late 1160s, the Yemenite ruler &#x27;Abd-al-Nabī ibn Mahdi gave Jews a choice of conversion to Islam or martyrdom. Mahdi also imposed his beliefs upon the Muslims besides the Jews. This led to a revival of Jewish messianism, but also led to mass-conversion. While a popular local Yemenite Jewish preacher called on Jews to choose martyrdom, Maimonides sent what is known as the &quot;Epistle to Yemen&quot; requesting that they remain faithful to their religion, but if at all possible, not to cast affronts before their antagonists. The persecution ended in 1173 with the defeat of ibn Mahdi and conquest of Yemen by Turan-Shah, the brother of Saladin, and they were allowed to return to their faith.

According to two Genizah documents, the Ayyubid ruler of Yemen al-Malik al-Mu&#x27;izz al-Ismail (reigned 1197–1202) attempted to force the Jews of Aden to convert. The second document details the relief of the Jewish community after his murder and those who had been forced to convert reverted to Judaism.

The rule of Shafi&#x27;i Rasulids which lasted from 1229 to 1474 brought stability to the region. During this period, Jews enjoyed social and economic prosperity. This changed with the rise of the Tahiri dynasty that ruled until the conquest of Yemen by the Ottoman Empire in 1517. A note written in a Jewish manuscript mentions the destruction of the old synagogue in Sana&#x27;a in 1457 under the rule of the dynasty&#x27;s founder Ahmad &#x27;Amir. An important note of the treatment of Jews by Tahirids is found in the colophon of a Jewish manuscript from Yemen in 1505, when the last Tahirid Sultan took Sana&#x27;a from the Zaydis. The document describes one kingdom as exploitive and the other as repressive.

The Jewish communities experienced a messianic episode with the rise of another Messiah claimant in Bayhan District, mentioned by Hayim bin Yahya Habhush in &quot;History of the Jews in Yemen&quot; written in 1893 and Ba&#x27;faqia al-Shihri&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; written in the 16th century. The messiah was acknowledged as a political figure and gathered many people around him into what seemed to be an organized military force. The Tahirid Sultan Amir ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab attacked the messiah, killing many Jews and crushing the movement. He saw it as a violation of the protection agreement and liquidated the Jewish settlement in Hadhramaut as collective punishment. Presumably some of them were killed, many converted to Islam or migrated to Aden and the adjacent mainland of Yemen. It seems, however, that the liquidation was not immediate. Jews of the place are recorded by 1527, but not by the 1660s. After the 15th century, Jewish communities only existed in the Hadhramaut&#x27;s western periphery. The oppression at the hands of pious Muslim rulers and endangerment of the community because of the plots of a few Jewish messianists are common themes in the history of Yemenite Jews.

====Maimonides====

Maimonides (1138–1204), the 12th-century philosopher, scholar and codifier of halakha, was adulated by the Jews of Yemen for his interventions on their behalf during times of religious persecution, heresy, and heavy taxation.

When the writings of Maimonides reached the heads of the community, they continued to address their questions unto him and sent emissaries to purchase several copies of his books, just as he acknowledged. In all the subjects of the Torah, Yemenite Jews customarily base their rule of practice (halakhah) on Maimonides&#x27; teachings, and will instruct following his view, whether in lenient or strict rulings, even where most other halakhic authorities disagree. Even so, some ancient customs remained with the Yemenite Jews, especially in those matters committed unto the masses and to the general public, which are still adhered to by them from an ancient period, and which they did not change even though Maimonides ruled otherwise. In common Jewish practice, the Jews of Yemen dissented with Maimonides&#x27; rulings in more than 50 places, ten of which places are named explicitly by Yosef Qafih.

===Early modern period===
The Zaydi enforced a statute known as the Orphan&#x27;s Decree, anchored in their own 18th-century legal interpretations and enforced at the end of that century. It obligated the Zaydi state to take under its protection and to educate in Islamic ways any dhimmi (i.e. non-Muslim) child whose parents had died when he was a minor. The Orphan&#x27;s Decree was ignored during the Ottoman rule (1872–1918), but was renewed during the period of Imam Yahya (1918–1948).

Under the Zaydi rule, the Jews were considered to be impure and therefore forbidden to touch a Muslim or a Muslim&#x27;s food. They were obligated to humble themselves before a Muslim, to walk to the left side, and greet him first. They could not build houses higher than a Muslim&#x27;s or ride a camel or horse, and when riding on a mule or a donkey, they had to sit sideways. Upon entering the Muslim quarter a Jew had to take off his foot-gear and walk barefoot. If attacked with stones or fists by youth, a Jew was not allowed to fight them. In such situations, he had the option of fleeing or seeking intervention by a merciful Muslim passerby.
Ottoman rule ended in 1630, when the Zaydis took over Yemen. Jews were once again persecuted. In 1679, under the rule of Al-Mahdi Ahmad, Jews were expelled &quot;en masse&quot; from all parts of Yemen to the distant province of Mawza, in what was known as the Mawza Exile, when many Jews died of starvation and disease as a consequence. As many as two-thirds of the exiled Jews did not survive. Their houses and property were seized, and many synagogues were destroyed or converted into mosques.

The Jewish community recovered partly because of Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi, also called &quot;Sahib al-Mawahib&quot;, who protected them and allowed them to return to their previous status. He rejected the pleas for Jewish deportation by the clerics and maintained ties with the Jewish &#x27;Iraqi family which was charged with the mint house. From the end of the 17th century, the Jews ran the mint house of the imams. In 1725, Imam Al-Mutawakkil ordered closure of synagogues because of the Jews selling wine to Muslims. However, their closure was rejected by a religious legal ruling that these synagogues were permitted by his predecessors.

The Jews of Yemen had expertise in a wide range of trades normally avoided by Zaydi Muslims. Trades such as silver-smithing, blacksmiths, repairing weapons and tools, weaving, pottery, masonry, carpentry, shoemaking, and tailoring were occupations that were exclusively taken by Jews. The division of labor created a sort of covenant, based on mutual economic and social dependency, between the Zaydi Muslim population and the Jews of Yemen. The Muslims produced and supplied food, and the Jews supplied all manufactured products and services that the Yemeni farmers needed.

The Jewish community headed by Shalom &#x27;Iraqi recovered from this affair and the position of &#x27;Iraqi strengthened under Imam Al-Mansur. The community flourished under him because of the part it played in trade with India through Mocha. The German researcher Carsten Niebuhr who visited Yemen in 1763, reports that two years before he arrived, Shalom &#x27;Iraqi had been imprisoned and fined while twelve out of fourteen synagogues in a village near Sana&#x27;a were shut down. &#x27;Iraqi was released two weeks before his arrival. Jewish sources attribute this to a regime change. The Imam Al-Mahdi Abbas was extremely religious and his ideological affinity with the clerics created an atmosphere of extreme repression. He however resisted their pressure on him to expel the Jews. The synagogues were reopened by Ali al-Mansur after payment of a heavy fee.

In the early 18th-century, many Jews in Yemen were employed in some of the most degrading and menial tasks, on behalf of the Arab population, such as cleaning the cess pools and latrines.

===Late modern period===
At the beginning of the nineteenth-century, Yemenite Jews lived principally in Sana&#x27;a (7,000-plus), with the largest Jewish population and twenty-eight synagogues, followed by Rada&#x27;a, with the second-largest Jewish population and nine synagogues, Sa&#x27;dah (1,000), Dhamar (1,000), Aden (200), the desert of Beda (2,000), Manakhah (3,000), among others. Almost all resided in the interior of the plateau. Carl Rathjens who visited Yemen in the years 1927 and 1931 puts the total number of Jewish communities in Yemen at 371 settlements. Other significant Jewish communities in Yemen were based in the south central highlands in the cities of: Taiz (the birthplace of one of the most famous Yemenite Jewish spiritual leaders, &quot;Mori&quot; Salem Al-Shabazzi Mashta), Ba&#x27;dan, and other cities and towns in the Shar&#x27;ab region. Many other Jewish communities in Yemen were long since abandoned by their Jewish inhabitants. Yemenite Jews were chiefly artisans, including gold-, silver- and blacksmiths in the San&#x27;a area, and coffee merchants in the south central highland areas.

In 1912, Zionist emissary Shmuel Yavne&#x27;eli came into contact with Habbani Jews, describing them in the following way:The Jews in these parts are held in high esteem by everyone in Yemen and Aden. They are said to be courageous, always with their weapons and wild long hair, and the names of their towns are mentioned by the Jews of Yemen with great admiration.

====19th-century Yemenite messianic movements====
During this period messianic expectations were very intense among the Jews of Yemen (and among many Arabs as well). The three pseudo-messiahs of this period, and their years of activity, are:
* Shukr Kuhayl I (1861–65)
* Shukr Kuhayl II (1868–75)
* Joseph Abdallah (1888–93)
According to the Jewish traveler Jacob Saphir, the majority of Yemenite Jews during his visit of 1862 entertained a belief in the messianic proclamations of Shukr Kuhayl I. Earlier Yemenite messiah claimants included the anonymous 12th-century messiah who was the subject of Maimonides&#x27;s famous Iggeret Teman, or &quot;Epistle to Yemen&quot;, the messiah of Bayhan (c. 1495), and Suleiman Jamal (c. 1667), in what Lenowitz regards as a unified messiah history spanning 600 years.

====Orphan&#x27;s decree (Yemen, 1922)====
In 1922, the government of Yemen, under Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din, re-introduced an ancient Islamic law entitled the &quot;orphans decree&quot;. The law dictated that if Jewish boys or girls under the age of 12 were orphaned, they were to be forcibly converted to Islam, their connections to their families and communities were to be severed, and they had to be handed over to Muslim foster families. The rule was based on the law that the prophet Muhammad is &quot;the father of the orphans&quot;, and on the fact that the Jews in Yemen were considered &quot;under protection&quot;, and the ruler was obligated to care for them. The Jews tried to prevent the conversion of orphans in two main ways, which were by marrying them so the authorities would consider them as adults, or by smuggling them out of the country.

====Emigration to Israel====

=====Places of origin and 1881–1939 new communities=====
The three major population centers for Jews in southern Arabia were Aden, Habban, and the Hadhramaut. The Jews of Aden lived in and around the city, and flourished during the British Aden Protectorate.

The vast majority of Yemenite immigrants counted by the authorities of Mandate Palestine in 1939 had settled in the country prior to that date. Throughout the periods of Ottoman Palestine and Mandatory Palestine, Jews from Yemen had settled primarily in agricultural settlements in the country, namely: Petach Tikvah (Machaneh Yehuda), Rishon Lezion (Shivat Zion), Rehovot (Sha&#x27;arayim and Marmorek), Wadi Chanin (later called Ness Ziona), Be&#x27;er Ya&#x27;akov, Hadera (Nachliel), Zichron Yaakov, Yavne&#x27;el, Gedera, Ben Shemen, Kinneret, Degania and Milhamia. Others chose to live in the urban areas of Jerusalem (Silwan, and Nachalat Zvi), Jaffa, Tel Aviv (Kerem Hateimanim), and later, Netanya (Shekhunat Zvi).

=====First wave of emigration: 1881 to 1918=====
Emigration from Yemen to Palestine began in 1881, and continued almost without interruption until 1914. It was during this time that about 10% of the Yemenite Jews left. Due to the changes in the Ottoman Empire, citizens could move more freely, and in 1869, travel was improved with the opening of the Suez Canal, which reduced the travel time from Yemen to Palestine. Certain Yemenite Jews interpreted these changes and the new developments in the &quot;Holy Land&quot; as heavenly signs that the time of redemption was near. By settling in the Holy Land, they would play a part in what they believed could precipitate the anticipated messianic era.

From 1881 to 1882, some 30 Jewish families left Sana&#x27;a and several nearby settlements, and made the long trek by foot and by sea to Jerusalem, where most had settled in Silwan. This wave was followed by other Jews from central Yemen, who continued to move into Palestine until 1914. The majority of these groups would later move into Jerusalem proper and Jaffa. Rabbi Avraham Al-Naddaf, who migrated to Jerusalem in 1891, described in his autobiography the hardships the Yemenite Jewish community faced in their new country, where there were no hostelries to accommodate wayfarers and new immigrants. On the other hand, he writes that the Sephardi &quot;kollelim&quot; (seminaries) had taken under their auspices the Yemenite Jews from the moment they set foot in Jerusalem. Later, however, the Yemenites would come to feel discriminated against by the Sephardic community, who compelled them to no longer make use of their own soft, pliable matzah, but to buy from them only the hard cracker-like matzah made weeks in advance prior to Passover. He also mentions that the Yemenite community would pay the prescribed tax to the public coffers; yet, they were not being allotted an equal share or subsidy as had been given to the Sephardic Jews. By 1910, the Yemenites had broken away from the Sephardic seminaries.

Before World War I, there was another wave that began in 1906 and continued until 1914. Hundreds of Yemenite Jews made their way to the Holy Land, and chose to settle in the agricultural settlements. It was after these movements that the World Zionist Organization sent Shmuel Yavne&#x27;eli to Yemen to encourage Jews to emigrate to Palestine. Yavne&#x27;eli reached Yemen at the beginning of 1911, and returned in April 1912. Due to Yavne&#x27;eli&#x27;s efforts, about 1,000 Jews left central and southern Yemen, with several hundred more arriving before 1914. The purpose of this immigration was considered by the Zionist Office as allowing the importation of cheap labour. This wave of Yemenite Jewry underwent extreme suffering, physically and mentally, and those who arrived between 1912 and 1918 had a very high incidence of premature mortality, ranging from between 30% and 40% generally and, in some townships, reaching as high as 50%.

=====Second wave of emigration: 1920 to 1950=====

During the British Mandate of Palestine, the total number of persons registered as immigrants from Yemen, between the years April 1939 – December 1945, was put at 4,554. By 1947, there were an estimated 35,000 Yemenite Jews living in Mandate Palestine. After the UN partition vote on Palestine, Arab rioters, assisted by the local police force, engaged in a pogrom in Aden that killed 82 Jews and destroyed hundreds of Jewish homes. Aden&#x27;s Jewish community was economically paralyzed, as most of the Jewish stores and businesses were destroyed. Early in 1948, the unfounded rumour of the ritual murder of two girls led to looting.

Following the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the messianism which had long been prevalent within the Yemenite community reemerged. David Ben-Gurion leading the new state caused many to believe that this was the &quot;Kingdom of David&quot;, while many of the mostly poor Yemenite Jews viewed Israel as an escape from their poverty. Moreover, the Israeli government used significant messianic messaging and language in its attempts to convince Yemenite Jewry to move to Israel.

This increasingly perilous situation led to the emigration of virtually the entire Yemenite Jewish community between June 1949 and September 1950 in Operation Magic Carpet. During this period, over 50,000 Jews migrated to Israel. The operation began in June 1949 and ended in September 1950. Part of the operation happened during the 1948 Palestine War and it was planned by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. The plan was for the Jews from all over Yemen to make their way to the Aden area. Specifically, the Jews were to arrive in Hashed Camp and live there until they could be airlifted to Israel. Hashed was an old British military camp in the desert, about a mile away from the city of Sheikh Othman. The operation took longer than was originally planned. Over the course of the operation, hundreds of migrants died in Hashed Camp, as well as on the plane rides to Israel. This was due to the camps extreme overcrowding and poor hygiene, housing, and medical care. The camps was built to house only 500 people but at points housed at least 12,000. These 12,000 lacked toilets, shelter, swift access to medical care, or a cemetery to bury the many dead. By September 1950, almost 50,000 Jews had been successfully airlifted to the newly formed state of Israel.

A smaller, continuous migration was allowed to continue into 1962, when a civil war put an abrupt halt to any further Jewish exodus.

According to an official statement by Alaska Airlines:
In the wake of the 1948 Arab Israeli War when vast territories were added to the State of Israel, the Jewish Agency under the good offices of Levi Eshkol, then head of the Settlement Department in that Agency, decided to settle many of the new immigrants arriving in Israel in newly founded agricultural communities. The idea was given further impetus when Yosef Weitz of the Jewish National Fund proposed settling many of the country&#x27;s new immigrants upon agricultural farms built in the recently acquired territories: in the mountainous regions, in Galilee and in the Jerusalem Corridor, places heretofore sparsely settled. It was decided that these new immigrants, many of whom were Yemenites, would make their livelihood by preparing the land for cultivation and planting trees. The first stage of this plan was to call such places &quot;work villages,&quot; later to be converted into &quot;cooperative farms&quot; (&quot;moshavim&quot;). In this manner were established Eshtaol, Yish&#x27;i, Ajjur, Dayraban Gimel, Allar Aleph, Allar-Bet, Kesalon, among other places, although the majority of these frontier places were later abandoned by the new immigrants from Yemen for more urban places in central Israel. This prompted Levi Eshkol to write in a letter to Prime-Minister Ben-Gurion (dated 10 April 1950): &quot;The Yemenite vision doesn&#x27;t allow him to see what he can do in a place of boulders and rocks. He cannot imagine such a development as Neve Ilan which sits upon dry rock. Instead, he imagines that he is being deprived...&quot; Many Yemenite Jews became irreligious through the re-education program of the Jewish Agency.

===Contemporary history===
====Missing children (Israel, 1949–51)====

Claims were made that, between 1949 and 1951, up to 1,033 children of Yemenite immigrant families may have disappeared from the immigrant camps. It was said that the parents were told that their children were ill and required hospitalization. Upon later visiting the hospital, it is claimed that the parents were told that their children had died though no bodies were presented and graves which have later proven to be empty in many cases were shown to the parents. Those who believed the theory contended that the Israeli government as well as other organizations in Israel kidnapped the children and gave them for adoption to other, non-Yemenite, families.

In 2001 a seven-year public inquiry commission concluded that the accusations that Yemenite children were kidnapped by the government are not true. The commission unequivocally rejected claims of a plot to take children away from Yemenite immigrants. The report determined that documentation existed showing that 972 of the 1,033 missing children were deceased. Five additional missing babies were found to be alive. The commission was unable to discover what happened in another 56 cases. With regard to these unresolved 56 cases, the commission deemed it &quot;possible&quot; that the children were handed over for adoption following decisions made by individual local social workers, but not as part of an official policy. In 2016, 400,000 documents were released in regard to the Yemenite Jewish Children affair.In 2016 after having re-examined evidence given to a commission of inquiry in the late 1990s, Cabinet Minister Tzachi Hanegbi told Israeli TV: &quot;They took the children and gave them away. I don&#x27;t know where.&quot; The minister admitted that at least &quot;hundreds&quot; of children were taken without their parent&#x27;s consent, marking the first time such a public claim had been made by a government official.In December 2021, &quot;Haaretz&quot; exposed a draft report on the affair whose publication was being suppressed by the Ministry of Health. Written by the outgoing deputy director general and two others, it &quot;reveals the involvement of doctors, nurses and caregivers in taking the children and acting as middlemen in their adoptions, sometimes in exchange for money. The report chronicles racist perceptions at the time of &#x27;backward immigrants&#x27; from Middle Eastern and North African countries, using the pretext of it being in the &#x27;best interests of the children&#x27; to justify their being taken away from their biological parents.&quot;This was thought to be the first official reference to the involvement of a ministry in the affair.

====Final wave of emigration: 1990 to 2016====
A third wave of emigration from Yemen began in the late 20th-century, with the intercession of Human Rights activist and professor, Hayim Tawil, founder of the International Coalition for the Revival of the Jews of Yemen (ICROJOY) in 1988. Tawil was instrumental in bringing out from Yemen the first Jew to emigrate in 23 years, and who set foot in Israel in September 1990. He was followed by other families in 1992, with the greatest bulk of Jewish families arriving in Israel between 1993 and 1994. These new Yemenite Jewish immigrants settled mainly in Rehovot (&quot;Oshiyot&quot;), Ashkelon and Beer-Sheva. Other families arrived in 1995 and 1996.

From August 1992 to July 17, 1993, Jews numbering some 246 persons moved to Israel from Yemen, via Germany, and some via the United States.

A small Jewish community existed in the town of Bayt Harash (2 km away from Raydah). They had a rabbi, a functioning synagogue, and a mikveh. They also had a boys yeshiva and a girls seminary, funded by a Satmar-affiliated Hasidic organization in Monsey, New York, U.S. A small Jewish enclave also existed in the town of Raydah, which lies north of Sana&#x27;a. The town hosted a yeshiva, also funded by a Satmar-affiliated organization.

In spite of hostile conditions in recent years for Jews still living in Yemen, Yemeni security forces have gone to great lengths to try to convince the Jews to stay in their towns. These attempts, however, failed, and the authorities were forced to provide financial aid for the Jews so they would be able to rent accommodations in safer areas.

Despite an official ban on emigration, many Yemenite Jews emigrated to Israel, the United States, and the United Kingdom in the 2000s, fleeing anti-Semitic persecution and seeking better Jewish marriage prospects. Many of them had initially gone there to study but had never returned. There was essentially no Jewish population in Sanaʽa until the Shia insurgency broke out in northern Yemen in 2004. In 2006 it was reported that a Jewish woman in Yemen who had spurned a Muslim suitor had not only been kidnapped and forced to marry him, but had been forced to convert to Islam as well. The Houthis directly threatened the Jewish community in 2007, prompting the government of President Saleh to offer them refuge in Sanaʽa. , around 700 Jews were living in the capital under government protection.

In December 2008, Moshe Ya&#x27;ish al-Nahari, a 30-year-old Hebrew teacher and kosher butcher from Raydah, was shot and killed by Abed el-Aziz el-Abadi, a former MiG-29 pilot in the Yemeni Air Force. Abadi confronted Nahari in the Raydah market, and shouted out, &quot;Jew, accept the message of Islam&quot;, and opened fire with an AK-47. Nahari was shot five times and died. During interrogation, Abadi proudly confessed his crime, and stated that &quot;these Jews must convert to Islam&quot;. Abadi had murdered his wife two years before but had avoided prison by paying her family compensation. The court found Abadi mentally unstable, and ordered him to pay only a fine, but an appeals court sentenced him to death. Yet, he escaped from prison with ten inmates in 2011. Following al-Nahari&#x27;s murder, the Jewish community expressed its feelings of insecurity, claiming to have received hate mail and threats by phone from Islamic extremists. Dozens of Jews reported receiving death threats and said that they had been subjected to violent harassment. Nahari&#x27;s killing and continual anti-Semitic harassment prompted approximately 20 other Jewish residents of Raydah to emigrate to Israel. In 2009, five of Nahari&#x27;s children moved to Israel, and in 2012, his wife and four other children followed, having initially stayed in Yemen so she could serve as a witness in Abadi&#x27;s trial.

In February 2009, 10 Yemeni Jews migrated to Israel, and in July 2009, three families, or 16 people in total, followed suit. On October 31, 2009, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that in June 2009, an estimated 350 Jews were left in Yemen, and by October 2009, 60 had emigrated to the United States, and 100 were considering following suit. The BBC estimated that the community numbered 370 and was dwindling. In 2010, it was reported that 200 Yemeni Jews would be allowed to immigrate to the United Kingdom.

In August 2012, Aharon Zindani, a Jewish community leader from Sana&#x27;a, was stabbed to death in a market in an anti-Semitic attack. Subsequently, his wife and five children emigrated to Israel, and took his body with them for burial in Israel, with assistance from the Jewish Agency and the Israeli Foreign Ministry.

In January 2013, it was reported that a group of 60 Yemenite Jews had migrated to Israel in a secret operation, arriving in Israel via a flight from Qatar. This was reported to be part of a larger operation which was being carried out in order to bring the approximately 400 Jews left in Yemen to Israel in the coming months.

====Yemeni civil war to present====

On October 11, 2015, Likud MK Ayoob Kara stated that members of the Yemenite Jewish community had contacted him to say that the Houthi-led Yemen government had given them an ultimatum to convert or leave the country. A spokesman for the party of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh denied the reports as incorrect.

On March 21, 2016, a group of 19 Yemenite Jews were flown to Israel in a secret operation, leaving the population at about 50. On 7 June 2016, Jews who had been arrested in Yemen after having helped to smuggle out a Torah scroll were released.

In May 2017 the Yemeni-based charity Mona Relief (Yemen Organization for Humanitarian Relief and Development) gave aid to 86 members of the Jewish community in Sana&#x27;a.

In a July 2018 interview with a Yemenite rabbi, he claimed that they were definitely treated very well before the recent war in Yemen which has affected all communities in Yemen. He has also said that Yemenite Jews should have never traveled away from Yemen and that he believes thousands of Yemenite Jews will return to Yemen after the war ends.

In 2019, the Mona Relief website reported (February 25): &quot;Mona Relief&#x27;s team in the capital Sana&#x27;a delivered today monthly food aid packages to Jewish minority families in Yemen. Mona Relief has been delivering food aid baskets to Jewish community in the capital Sana&#x27;a since 2016. Our project today was funded by Mona Relief&#x27;s online fundraising campaign in indiegogo...&quot;

As of March 2020, the Jewish cemetery in Aden was destroyed. On April 28, 2020, Yemenite Minister Moammer al-Iryani remarked the &quot;fate of the last 50 Jews&quot; in Yemen is &quot;unknown&quot;.

A 2020 World Population Review with a Census of Jewish population by country has &quot;no&quot; listing of &quot;any&quot; Jews in Yemen.

On July 13, 2020, it was reported that the Houthi Militia were capturing the last Jews of Yemen of the Kharif District. In their last mention of the Jews in Yemen in July 2020 the Mona Relief reported on their Website that as of July 19, 2020, of the Jewish Population in Yemen there were only a &quot;handful&quot; of Jews in Sana&#x27;a.

According to Yemeni publications published in July 2020, the last two Jewish families were waiting for deportation from the areas controlled by the Houthis, which would make Yemen, for the first time in its modern history, devoid of Jews, with the exception of the families of the brothers Suleiman Musa Salem and Sulaiman Yahya Habib in Sana&#x27;a and the family of Salem Musa Mara&#x27;bi who moved to the complex owned by the Ministry of Defense near the U.S. embassy in 2007 after the Houthis assaulted them and looted their homes. The publications said that a Jewish woman lives with her brother in the Rayda district and a man and his wife live in the Arhab district of the Sana&#x27;a governorate. A source said, &quot;It is now clear that the Houthis want to deport the rest of the Jews, and prevent them from selling their properties at their real prices, and we are surprised that the international community and local and international human rights organizations have remained silent towards the process of forced deportation and forcing the Jews to leave their country and prevent them from disposing of their property.

In August 2020 of an estimated 100 or so remaining Yemen Jews, 42 have migrated to UAE and the rest would also leave. On November 10, 2020, the U.S. State Department called for the immediate and unconditional release of Levi Salem Musa Marhabi, one of the last remaining Yemenite Jews in Yemen. A press statement said Marhabi has been wrongfully detained by the Houthi militia for four years, despite a court ordering his release in September 2019. In December 2020 an Israeli Rabbi visited the Yemenite Jews who escaped to the UAE.

On 28 March 2021, 13 Jews were forced by the Houthis to leave Yemen; less than 10 Jews still resided in Yemen. According to one report there are six Jews left in Yemen: one woman; her brother; 3 others, and Levi Salem Marhabi (who has been imprisoned for helping smuggle a Torah scroll out of Yemen). &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; reported that the remaining Jewish population in Yemen consists of four elderly Jews, ending the continuous presence of a community that dated back to antiquity. In December 2021 the Jews of Yemen received Hanukkah kits. In March 2022 the United Nations reported there is just one Jew in Yemen (Levi Salem Marhabi), however &quot;Ynet&quot; cited local sources stating that as of 19 June 2024 the actual number is five.(one of the last Jews in Yemen Yihye Ben-Yosef had just died leaving Marhabi and four others still alive )

===Timeline of events===
==Religious traditions==
Yemenite Jews and the Aramaic speaking Kurdish Jews are the only communities who maintain the tradition of reading the Torah in the synagogue in both Hebrew and the Aramaic Targum (&quot;translation&quot;). Most non-Yemenite synagogues have a specified person called a Baal Koreh, who reads from the Torah scroll when congregants are called to the Torah scroll for an aliyah. In the Yemenite tradition, each person called to the Torah scroll for an aliyah reads for himself. Children under the age of Bar Mitzvah are often given the sixth aliyah. Each verse of the Torah read in Hebrew is followed by the Aramaic translation, usually chanted by a child. Both the sixth aliyah and the Targum have a simplified melody, distinct from the general Torah melody used for the other aliyot.

Like most other Jewish communities, Yemenite Jews chant different melodies for Torah, Prophets (Haftara), Megillat Aicha (Book of Lamentations), Kohelet (Ecclesiastes, read during Sukkot), and Megillat Esther (the Scroll of Esther read on Purim). Unlike Ashkenazic communities, there are melodies for Mishle (Proverbs) and Psalms.


In larger Jewish communities, such as Sana&#x27;a and Sad&#x27;a, boys were sent to the &quot;melamed&quot; at the age of three to begin their religious learning. They attended the &quot;melamed&quot; from early dawn to sunset on Sunday through Thursday and until noon on Friday. Jewish women were required to have a thorough knowledge of the laws pertaining to Kashrut and Taharat Mishpachah (family purity) i.e. Niddah. Some women even mastered the laws of Shechita, thereby acting as ritual slaughterers.

People also sat on the floors of synagogues instead of sitting on chairs, similar to the way many other non-Ashkenazi Jews sat in synagogues. This is in accordance with what Rambam (Maimonides) wrote in his Mishneh Torah:


The lack of chairs may also have been to provide more space for prostration, another ancient Jewish observance that the Jews of Yemen continued to practise until very recent times. There are still a few Yemenite Jews who prostrate themselves during the part of everyday Jewish prayer called Tachanun (Supplication), though such individuals usually do so in privacy. In the small Jewish community that exists today in Bet Harash, prostration is still done during the tachanun prayer. Jews of European origin generally prostrate only during certain portions of special prayers during Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year) and Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement). Prostration was a common practise amongst all Jews until some point during the late Middle Ages or Renaissance period.

Like Yemenite Jewish homes, the synagogues in Yemen had to be lower in height than the lowest mosque in the area. In order to accommodate this, synagogues were built into the ground to give them more space without looking large from the outside. In some parts of Yemen, minyanim would often just meet in homes of Jews, instead of the community having a separate building for a synagogue. Beauty and artwork were saved for the ritual objects in the synagogue and in the home.

Yemenite Jews also wore a distinctive tallit often found to this day. The Yemenite tallit features a wide &quot;atara&quot; and large corner patches, embellished with silver or gold thread, and the fringes along the sides of the tallit are netted. According to the Baladi custom, the tzitzit are tied with seven &quot;chulyot&quot; (hitches), based on Maimonides&#x27; teaching.

On Sabbath days, the traditional Yemenite bread was not the &quot;Challah&quot;, as found in Western Jewish communities, but the &quot;Kubaneh&quot;, which was eaten on Sabbath mornings after first making the blessing over two flatbreads baked in an earthen oven.

===Weddings and marriage traditions===

During a Yemenite Jewish wedding, the bride was bedecked with jewelry and wore a traditional wedding costume, including an elaborate headdress decorated with flowers and rue leaves, which were believed to ward off evil. Gold threads were woven into the fabric of her clothing. Songs were sung as part of a seven-day wedding celebration, with lyrics about friendship and love in alternating verses of Hebrew and Arabic.

In Yemen, the Jewish practice was not for the groom and his bride to be secluded in a canopy (&quot;chuppah&quot;) hung on four poles, as is widely practiced today in Jewish weddings, but rather in a bridal chamber that was, in effect, a highly decorated room in the house of the groom. This room was traditionally decorated with large hanging sheets of colored, patterned cloth, replete with wall cushions and short-length mattresses for reclining. Their marriage is consummated when they have been left together alone in this room. This ancient practice finds expression in the writings of Isaac ben Abba Mari (c. 1122 – c. 1193), author of &quot;Sefer ha-&#x27;Ittur&quot;, concerning the Benediction of the Bridegroom: &quot;Now the &quot;chuppah&quot; is when her father delivers her unto her husband, bringing her into that house wherein is some new innovation, such as the sheets… surrounding the walls, etc. For we recite in the Jerusalem Talmud, &quot;Sotah&quot; 46a (&quot;Sotah&quot; 9:15), &#x27;Those bridal chambers, (&quot;chuppoth hathanim&quot;), they hang within them patterned sheets and gold-embroidered ribbons,&#x27; etc.&quot;
After immigration to Israel, the regional varieties of Yemenite bridal jewelry were replaced by a uniform item that became identified with the community: the splendid bridal garb of Sana&#x27;a.

Before the wedding, Yemenite and other Eastern Jewish communities perform the henna ceremony, an ancient ritual with Bronze Age origins. The family of the bride mixes a paste derived from the henna plant that is placed on the palms of the bride and groom, and their guests. After the paste is washed off, a deep orange stain remains that gradually fades over the next week.

Yemenites had a special affinity for Henna due to biblical and Talmudic references. Henna, in the Bible, is Camphire, and is mentioned in the Song of Solomon, as well as in the Talmud. This tradition is also practiced by Pashtuns and Afghan Jews.

:&quot;My Beloved is unto me as a cluster of Camphire in the vineyards of En-Gedi&quot; Song of Solomon, 1:14

A Yemenite Jewish wedding custom specific only to the community of Aden is the Talbis, revolving around the groom. A number of special songs are sung by the men while holding candles, and the groom is dressed in a golden garment.

===Religious groups===
The three main groups of Yemenite Jews are the Baladi, Shami, and the Maimonideans or &quot;Rambamists&quot;. In addition, the &quot;Rechabites&quot; are a tribe in Sana&#x27;a claiming to be descendants of Jehonadab that was found in 1839 by Reverend Joseph Wolff, who later went to Bukhara to attempt to save Lieutenant Colonel Charles Stoddart and Captain Arthur Conolly.

The differences between these groups largely concern the respective influence of the original Yemenite tradition, which was largely based on the works of Maimonides, and on the Kabbalistic tradition embodied in the Zohar and in the school of Isaac Luria, which was increasingly influential from the 17th century on.
* The Baladi Jews (from Arabic &quot;balad&quot;, country) generally follow the legal rulings of the &quot;Rambam&quot; (Maimonides) as codified in his work the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;. Their liturgy was developed by a rabbi known as the Maharitz (&quot;Moreinu Ha-Rav Yiḥya Tzalaḥ&quot;), in an attempt to break the deadlock between the pre-existing followers of Maimonides and the new followers of the mystic, Isaac Luria. It substantially follows the older Yemenite tradition, with only a few concessions to the usages of the Ari. A Baladi Jew may or may not accept the Kabbalah theologically: if he does, he regards himself as following Luria&#x27;s own advice that every Jew should follow his ancestral tradition.
* The Shami Jews (from Arabic &quot;ash-Sham&quot;, the north, referring to the region of Syria including Israel) represent those who accepted the Sephardic/Mizrahi rite and lines of rabbinic authority, after being exposed to new inexpensive, typeset siddurs (prayer books) brought from Israel and the Sephardic diaspora by envoys and merchants in the late 17th century and 18th century. The &quot;local rabbinic leadership resisted the new versions ... Nevertheless, the new prayer books were widely accepted.&quot; As part of that process, the Shami accepted the Zohar and modified their rites to accommodate the usages of the Ari to the maximum extent. The text of the Shami siddur now largely follows the Sephardic tradition, though the pronunciation, chant and customs are still Yemenite in flavour. They generally base their legal rulings both on the Rambam (Maimonides) and on the Shulchan Aruch (Code of Jewish Law). In their interpretation of Jewish law, Shami Yemenite Jews were strongly influenced by Syrian Sephardi Jews, though on some issues, they rejected the later European codes of Jewish law, and instead followed the earlier decisions of Maimonides. Most Yemenite Jews living today follow the Shami customs. The Shami rite was always more prevalent, even 50 years ago.
* The &quot;Rambamists&quot; are followers of, or to some extent influenced by, the Dor Daim movement, and are strict followers of Talmudic law as compiled by Maimonides, aka &quot;Rambam&quot;. They are regarded as a subdivision of the Baladi Jews, and claim to preserve the Baladi tradition in its pure form. They generally reject the Zohar and Lurianic Kabbalah altogether. Many of them object to terms like &quot;Rambamist&quot;. In their eyes, they are simply following the most ancient preservation of Torah, which (according to their research) was recorded in the Mishneh Torah.

====School reform dispute (Dor Daim vs Iqshim)====
Towards the end of the 19th century, new ideas began to reach Yemenite Jews from abroad. Hebrew newspapers began to arrive, and relations developed with Sephardic Jews, who came to Yemen from various Ottoman provinces to trade with the army and government officials.

Two Jewish travelers, Joseph Halévy, a French-trained Jewish Orientalist, and Eduard Glaser, an Austrian-Jewish astronomer and Arabist, in particular had a strong influence on a group of young Yemenite Jews, the most outstanding of whom was Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ. As a result of his contact with Halévy and Glaser, Qafiḥ introduced modern content into the educational system. Qafiḥ opened a new school and, in addition to traditional subjects, introduced arithmetic, Hebrew and Arabic, with the grammar of both languages. The curriculum also included subjects such as natural science, history, geography, astronomy, sports and Turkish.

The Dor Daim and Iqshim dispute about the Zohar literature broke out in 1912, inflamed Sana&#x27;a&#x27;s Jewish community, and split it into two rival groups that maintained separate communal institutions until the late 1940s. Rabbi Qafiḥ and his friends were the leaders of a group of Maimonideans called Dor Daim (the &quot;generation of knowledge&quot;). Their goal was to bring Yemenite Jews back to the original Maimonidean method of understanding Judaism that existed in pre-17th-century Yemen.

Similar to certain Spanish and Portuguese Jews (Western Sephardi Jews), the Dor Daim rejected the Zohar, a book of esoteric mysticism. They felt that the Kabbalah which was based on the Zohar was irrational, alien, and inconsistent with the true reasonable nature of Judaism. In 1913, when it seemed that Rabbi Qafiḥ, then headmaster of the new Jewish school and working closely with the Ottoman authorities, enjoyed sufficient political support, the Dor Daim made its views public, and tried to convince the entire community to accept them. Many of the non-Dor Deah elements of the community rejected the Dor Deah concepts. The opposition, the Iqshim, headed by Rabbi Yiḥya Yiṣḥaq, the Hakham Bashi, refused to deviate from the accepted customs and from the study of the Zohar. One of the Iqshim&#x27;s targets in the fight against Rabbi Qafiḥ was his modern Turkish-Jewish school. Due to the Dor Daim and Iqshim dispute, the school closed 5 years after it was opened, before the educational system could develop a reserve of young people who had been exposed to its ideas.

===Education===
Education of children was of paramount importance to Jewish fathers in Yemen, who, as a rule, sent their children from an early age to study the portions of the Torah, usually under the tutelage of a local teacher. Often, such teachings were conducted in the home of their teacher. It was not uncommon for the teacher to be occupied in his trade (coat maker, weaver, etc.) while instructing his students. All instruction consisted of the recital and memorization of sacred texts. The most astute of these students, when they came of age, pursued after a higher Jewish education and which almost always entailed studying &quot;Shechita&quot; (ritual slaughter), and receiving a license () from a qualified instructor to slaughter domestic livestock.

==Yemenite Jewish culture==

===Yemenite Hebrew===

Yemenite Hebrew has been studied by scholars, many of whom believe it to contain the most ancient phonetic and grammatical features. There are two main pronunciations of Yemenite Hebrew, considered by many scholars to be the most accurate modern-day form of Biblical Hebrew, although there are technically a total of five that relate to the regions of Yemen. In the Yemenite dialect, all Hebrew letters have a distinct sound, except for &quot;sāmeḵ&quot; () and &quot;śîn&quot; (), which are both pronounced . The Sanaani Hebrew pronunciation (used by the majority) has been indirectly critiqued by Saadia Gaon since it contains the Hebrew letters &quot;&quot; and &quot;guf&quot;, which he rules is incorrect. There are Yemenite scholars, such as Rabbi Ratzon Arusi, who say that such a perspective is a misunderstanding of Saadia Gaon&#x27;s words.

Rabbi Mazuz postulates this hypothesis through the Djerban (Tunisia) Jewish dialect&#x27;s use of &quot;gimmel&quot; and &quot;quf&quot;, switching to &quot;&quot; and &quot;guf&quot; when talking with Gentiles in the Arabic dialect of Jerba. While Jewish boys learned Hebrew from the age of 3, it was used primarily as a liturgical and scholarly language. In daily life, Yemenite Jews spoke in regional Judeo-Arabic.

===Yemenite Jewish literature===
The oldest Yemenite manuscripts are those of the Hebrew Bible, which the Yemenite Jews call &quot;Taj&quot; (&quot;crown&quot;). The oldest texts dating from the 9th century, and each of them has a short Masoretic introduction, while many contain Arabic commentaries.

Yemenite Jews were acquainted with the works of Saadia Gaon, Rashi, Kimhi, Nahmanides, Yehudah ha Levy and Isaac Arama, besides producing a number of exegetes from among themselves. In the 14th century, Nathanael ben Isaiah wrote an Arabic commentary on the Bible; in the second half of the 15th century, Saadia ben David al-Adeni was the author of a commentary on Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Abraham ben Solomon wrote on the Prophets.

Among the midrash collections from Yemen mention should be made of the &quot;Midrash ha-Gadol&quot; of David bar Amram al-Adeni. Between 1413 and 1430 the physician Yaḥya Zechariah b. Solomon wrote a compilation entitled &quot;Midrash ha-Ḥefeẓ,&quot; which included the Pentateuch, Lamentations, Book of Esther, and other sections of the Hebrew Bible. Between 1484 and 1493 David al-Lawani composed his &quot;Midrash al-Wajiz al-Mughni.&quot; The earliest complete Judeo-Arabic copy of Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, copied in Yemen in 1380, was found in the India Office Library and added to the collection of the British Library in 1992.
Among the Yemenite poets who wrote Hebrew and Arabic hymns modeled after the Spanish school, mention may be made of Zechariah (Yaḥya) al-Dhahiri and the members of the Shabazi family. Al-Dhahiri&#x27;s work, which makes use of the poetic genre known as &quot;maqāmah&quot;, a style inspired by Ḥariri, was written in 1573 under the title &quot;Sefer ha-Musar&quot;. Herein, the author describes in 45 chapters his travels throughout India, Iraq, Turkey, Syria, the Land of Israel and Egypt, including a description of Rabbi Yosef Karo&#x27;s seat of learning in Safed. The philosophical writers include: Saadia b. Jabeẓ and Saadia b. Mas&#x27;ud, both at the beginning of the 14th century; Ibn al-Ḥawas, the author of a treatise in the form of a dialogue written in rhymed prose, and termed by its author the &quot;Flower of Yemen&quot;; Ḥasan al-Dhamari; and Joseph ha-Levi b. Jefes, who wrote the philosophical treatises &quot;Ner Yisrael&quot; (1420) and &quot;Kitab al-Masaḥah.&quot;

===Yemenite Jewish clothing===
====Men&#x27;s clothing====

A Tunic () and habit (), the latter made with a central hat (), were the traditional items of clothing worn by a married Jewish man in Yemen. Leading rabbinic scholar and sage, Rabbi Yosef Qafih, described the manner in which they would wrap their habits, saying that the habit was sometimes worn while wrapped around a man&#x27;s head, or simply partly draped over his head. German ethnographer Erich Brauer (1895–1942) described the differences between Jewish and Gentile garb, making note of the fact that the differences existed only in their outer garments, but not in their undergarments. He also offered the following description:
As noted, some of the men&#x27;s dress-codes were forced upon them by laws of the State. For example, formerly in Yemen, Jews were not allowed to wear clothing of any color besides blue. Earlier, in Jacob Saphir&#x27;s time (1859), they&#x27;d wear outer garments that were &quot;utterly black.&quot; When German-Danish explorer, Carsten Niebuhr, visited Yemen in 1763, the only person he saw wearing the blue-colored tunic was the Jewish courtier, the Minister and Prince, Sālim b. Aharon Irāqi Ha-Kohen, who served under two kings for a period of no less than twenty-eight years.

The traditional Yemenite &quot;tallīt&quot; is a full-length &quot;tallīt&quot; made from fine wool or goat&#x27;s hair of a single black or brown color, called &quot;šämläh&quot;, but it was not unique unto Jews alone. Muslims would also wear similar items of covering, to protect them from the heat or rain. Jewish garments, however, bore the ritual fringes prescribed for such garments. The wearing of such garments was not unique to prayer time alone, but was worn the entire day. Later, decorative black and white striped shawls were imported into the country from Europe, and which were highly valued by the Jews of Yemen who wore them on special occasions and on the Sabbath day. The small &quot;tallīt&quot; (&quot;ṭallīt kaṭan&quot;) was introduced into Yemen via Aden from European centers, and principally worn by rabbis and educated persons.

====Women&#x27;s clothing====
Jewish women in Yemen traditionally wore branched pantaloons beneath their long black tunics. The pantaloons were usually made of a jet-black color, tapering close to their ankles, and decorated at the lower seams with a fine embroidered stitch of silver. The tunic served as, both, a dress and long-sleeved blouse, all in one piece. In addition, all young girls wore a black, conical shaped hat upon their heads, which took the place of a scarf. These hats were called in the local vernacular, &quot;gargush&quot;, and were also decorated with an embroidered sash about its borders, besides being equipped with tapering flaps that extended down to the ears and to the nape of the neck. Older women in Sana&#x27;a would wear a broad veil-like scarf over their heads, called &quot;maswan&quot;, especially when going out in public places, and which was traditionally worn above the closer fitting scarves that covered their hair. All women were adorned with black slippers when walking in public places, and only very small girls would walk barefoot.

Jewish women and girls in Haydan a-sham (in the far northern districts of Yemen) did not make use of the gargush, but would wear a black scarf tied firmly to their foreheads, resembling a black band, along with the covering made by an additional scarf that covered the hair.

===Culinary specialties===
The Yemenite Jews are known for bringing to Israel certain culinary dishes, now popularly eaten by all ethnic-groups living in Israel, namely, the &quot;malawach&quot; (itself an adaptation of the Yemeni &quot;mulawah&quot;), and &quot;jachnun&quot;. Lesser-known breadstuffs include the &quot;kubaneh&quot; (a traditional Sabbath bread), &quot;luḥūḥ&quot;, &quot;sabayah&quot;, and &quot;zalabiyeh&quot;.

===Yemenite Jewish surnames===
The subject of Jewish surnames in Yemen is a complex one. Most surnames are gentilic or toponymic surnames, meaning, they are derived from the name of an ancestor&#x27;s place of residence (the name of a town or village, such as Gadasi from al-Gades; Qa&#x27;taby from Qa&#x27;tabah; Manqadi from Manqadah; Damari from Dhamar, Damti from Damt, etc.), while fewer are eponymous or patronymic surnames, being derived from the name of an ancient ancestor. Some surnames reflect an ancestor&#x27;s profession. In some cases, surnames are derived from a certain physical characteristic of one&#x27;s distant ancestor. Some families bear original Spanish surnames, such as Medina and Giyyat. Some names went through additional changes upon emigration to Israel. For example, some who formerly bore the surname of Radha (Judeo-Arabic: ) have changed their surname to Ratzon (Hebrew: ), the Hebrew being the direct translation of the word&#x27;s meaning in Arabic, while yet others have simply changed their names to a more Hebraicized sound, such as the surnames of Al-Nadaf (lit. a stuffer of cushions; carder of cotton), which was later changed to Nadav (&quot;generous&quot;), and &#x27;Urqabi (so-named from a locality in Yemen) which was later changed to Argov; or Sheḥib (Judeo-Arabic: ), meaning &quot;one whose voice is hoarse,&quot; which was changed to Shevach (Hebrew: ), meaning &quot;praise,&quot; by a reversal of the last two letters.

====Claimed family lineages====
Some Jewish families have preserved traditions which are related to their tribal affiliations, based on partial genealogical records which have been passed down from generation to generation. In Yemen, for example, some Jews trace their lineage to Judah, others trace their lineage to Benjamin, and others trace their lineage to Levi and Reuben. Of particular interest is one distinguished Jewish family of Yemen, named Salah, which traced its lineage to Bani, one of the sons of Perez, the son of Judah.
===Interaction with Israeli culture===

Israeli Yemenite Jews were initially discouraged from practicing their culture by the dominant Ashkenazi majority, and the practice of using henna before weddings declined. Beginning around the late 1970s, discussions were held in honor of the ethnic heritage of Yemenite Jews and by 2018, a revival of some Yemenite customs occurred. The cathartic moment was an exhibition of a Yemeni bride which was shown at the Israel Museum in 1965.

====Music====

Yemeni Jews are predominant among Israeli performers of Mizrahi music. Yemenite singer Shoshana Damari is considered &quot;The queen of Israeli music&quot;, and 2 of the most successful Israeli singers abroad, Ofra Haza and Achinoam Nini (Noa), are of Yemenite origin. At the Eurovision Song Contest, 1998, 1979, and 1978 winners Dana International, Gali Atari, and Izhar Cohen, 1983 runner-up Ofra Haza, and 2008 top 10 finalist Boaz Mauda, are Yemenite Jews. Harel Skaat, who competed at Oslo in 2010, is the son of a Yemenite Jewish father. Other Israeli singers and musicians of Yemenite Jewish descent include Zohar Argov, the three sisters of the music group A-WA (Yemenite Jewish father), Inbar Bakal, Mosh Ben-Ari, Yosefa Dahari, Daklon, Eyal Golan, Zion Golan, Yishai Levi, Sara Levi-Tanai (choreographer and songwriter), Bo&#x27;az Ma&#x27;uda, Avihu Medina, Boaz Sharabi, Pe&#x27;er Tasi, Rucka Rucka Ali, Shimi Tavori, Margalit Tzan&#x27;ani, and Tomer Yosef of Balkan Beat Box.

==Genetic studies==
Studies on uniparental haplogroups have indicated shared roots between Yemenite Jewish and members of the world&#x27;s other various Jewish communities, as well as some type of contribution from the local non-Jewish population. Y chromosome haplogroups have shown a strong link to other Jewish groups, such as the European Ashkenazi and Middle Eastern Iraqi Jews, and to non-Jewish Levantine populations, such as Palestinians and Samaritans. Yemenite Jews commonly carry West Eurasian mitochondrial DNA haplogroups that are found in other Jewish and Levantine groups but not in non-Jewish Yemenis, suggesting ancient Israelite descent. What makes them stand out among Jewish populations is the presence of sub-Saharan African L haplogroups, which are common among non-Jewish Yemenis but not in other Jewish groups. Nonetheless, compared to non-Jewish Yemenis, Yemenite Jews have a lower frequency and diversity of L haplotypes. It has been proposed that the L lineages might reflect admixture from a local non-Jewish source, whereas a 2011 study by Amy L. Non and others concluded that there is ”little evidence for large-scale conversion of local Yemeni”.

By autosomal DNA, Yemenite Jews are relatively distinct from other Jewish groups. Instead, they are closer to the non-Jewish population of the Arabian Peninsula.

However, according to Simon Schama, the Israeli geneticist Batsheva Bonne-Tamir established that the ancestry of Yemeni Jews goes back to south-Western Arabian and Bedouin conversions.

In medicine, the mutation SAMD9 (sterile alpha motif domain containing 9), which encodes a protein involved in the regulation of extraosseous calcification, has been found to underlie normophosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis in families of Jewish Yemenite origin.

<text>Korean era names were titles adopted in historical Korea for the purpose of year identification and numbering. Era names were used during the period of Silla, Goguryeo, Balhae, Taebong, Goryeo, Joseon, and the Korean Empire. Various Korean regimes officially adopted the era names of Chinese dynasties.

Era names originated in 140 BCE in China, during the reign of the Emperor Wu of Han. Since the middle of the 6th century CE, various Korean regimes started to use era names.

The North Korean government and associated organizations use a variation of the Gregorian calendar with a Juche year based on April 15, 1912 CE, the date of birth of Kim Il-sung, as year 1. There is no Juche year 0. The calendar was introduced in 1997. Months are unchanged from those in the standard Gregorian calendar. In many instances, the Juche year is given after the CE year, for example, &quot;18  2025 Juche 114&quot;. But in North Korean publications, the Juche year is usually placed before the corresponding CE year, as in &quot;Juche 114 (2025)&quot;.

<text>Piero Capponi (1447 – September 25, 1496) was an Italian statesman and military leader from Florence; he is celebrated for his bold defiance of the King of France in 1494.

==Biography==

First intended for a business career, Piero&#x27;s diplomatic abilities were recognized by Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, who sent him as ambassador to various courts, where he acquitted himself with distinction. In 1492 upon the death of Lorenzo, the feckless leadership Piero de&#x27; Medici led Capponi to become one of the leaders of the anti-Medicean faction which two years later succeeded in expelling this Medici ruler from Florence. Capponi was then made chief of the republic and conducted public affairs with great skill, notably in the difficult negotiations with Charles VIII of France, who had invaded Italy in 1494 and in whose camp the exiled Medici had taken refuge.
In November 1494 on his way to Naples from Milan, Charles and his large army passed through Lucca into Tuscan territory, occupying Pisa, a city still restless after the Florentine subjugation in 1406. He was allowed to enter and welcomed into Florence on November 17 with his army, and immediately began to behave as though he were the conqueror of the city. The Republican Signoria was anxious to be on good terms with him, but he began to imply he would mediate the relationship of France to Pisa and the future role of the deposed Piero de&#x27; Medici in Florence. Additionally, he requested a loan of 150,000 ducats to help fund his enterprise. Piero and his fellow Republican councilors where not willing to accede to such demands. The temper of the city soon changed, and the citizens began to prepare for the possibility of an urban war with French soldiers already billeted inside the walls. 

The Florentine republic was willing to pay him a large sum of money, but in settling the amount further disagreements arose. Charles finally presented an ultimatum to the Council of the Signoria, and if his demands were declined, he threatened &quot;Then we shall sound our trumpets&quot;. An angered Capponi ripped up the written demands before the King himself, and replied &quot;And we shall toll our bells&quot;. Charles, who did not relish the idea of house-to-house fighting, moderated his demands and concluded a more equitable treaty with the republic. The final treaty ultimately did not insist on Pisan independence from Florence or on a reimposition of the expelled Medici. The total payment was reduced and split into allotments over a year.

On November 28 Charles VIII departed Florence, and Capponi was appointed to reform the government of Florence. But being more at home in the camp than in the council chamber, he was glad of the opportunity of leading the armies of the republic against the Pisan rebels. He proved a most capable general, but while besieging the castle of Soiana, he was killed on the 25 September 1496. His death was greatly regretted, for the Florentines recognized in him their ablest statesman and warrior.

Piero&#x27;s son, Niccolò Capponi, was elected Gonfaloniero di Giustizia in 1527, but died in 1529, after the Medici restoration.

<doc id="348799" wikidata="Q2266066" url="?curid=348799" title="Individual time trial">
<text>An individual time trial (ITT) is a road bicycle race in which cyclists race alone against the clock (in French: &quot;contre la montre&quot; – literally &quot;against the watch&quot;, in Italian: &quot;tappa a cronometro&quot; &quot;stopwatch stage&quot;). There are also track-based time trials where riders compete in velodromes, and team time trials (TTT). ITTs are also referred to as &quot;the race of truth&quot;, as winning depends only on each rider&#x27;s strength and endurance, and not on help provided by teammates and others riding ahead and creating a slipstream. Individual time trial are usually held on flat or rolling terrain, although sometimes they are held up a mountain road (in Italian: &quot;cronoscalata&quot; &quot;chrono climbing&quot;). Sometimes the opening stage of a stage race is a very short individual time trial called a prologue (8 km or less for men, 4 km or less for women and juniors).

Starting times are at equal intervals, usually one or two minutes apart. The starting sequence is usually based on the finishing times in preceding races (or preceding stages in the case of a multi-stage race) with the highest ranked cyclist starting last. Starting later gives the racer the advantage of knowing what time they need to beat (and also makes the event more interesting to spectators). Competitors are not permitted to draft (ride in the slipstream) behind each other. Any help between riders is forbidden. The rider with the fastest time is declared the winner.

==Professional==

Bicycle construction is limited by regulations covering dimensions and other features such as weight. UCI Regulations
At the professional level, time trials (TTs) are frequently accompanied by motorcycles, some carrying video equipment or race officials, and riders may be followed by a team car carrying coaches and spare parts, but the cyclists are not permitted to draft behind the vehicles. Race regulations typically dictate a minimum distance behind the cyclist which the car must maintain and a minimum gap that must exist between two cyclists before the car may enter that gap.

Individual time trials are often used as stages in stage races such as the Grand Tours; these vary from short prologue time trials over no more than eight kilometres (designed to create an attacking racing style earlier in the race) to longer distance events over flat or rolling courses, to timed ascents of mountain roads (mountain time trial). In the 1989 edition of the Tour de France, eventual winner Greg LeMond made up a 50-second deficit to runner-up Laurent Fignon over 24.5 km during the individual time trial on the final stage to win the race by 8 seconds, the smallest margin ever. The Vuelta a España often features a final individual time trial in Madrid in which the winner is often decided, providing much drama and excitement at the end of the stage race. In recent years, Óscar Sevilla and Roberto Heras have seen their lead evaporate in the time trial in Madrid.

The &quot;Grand Prix des Nations&quot; was a semi-Classic event; professionals may also compete in the annual World time trial championship. The individual time trial is also an Olympic event in which professionals are allowed to participate.

Many of the top stage racers have also been top performers in the individual time trial, such as Lance Armstrong, Eddy Merckx, Alfredo Binda, Jacques Anquetil, Bernard Hinault, Fausto Coppi, Laurent Fignon, Greg LeMond, Miguel Indurain, Jan Ullrich, Ivan Basso, Alberto Contador, Cadel Evans, Fabian Cancellara, Tom Dumoulin, Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome. Most recent winners of the Tour de France have been good time-trialists; exceptions include Marco Pantani, Carlos Sastre, and Andy Schleck, who were climbing specialists.

==Performance and tactics==
To do well in an ITT, cyclists must
* maintain a steady power output for long periods
* maintain a controlled heart rate for long periods
* have a smooth, regular pedalling technique
* position themselves to be extremely aerodynamic
* discipline themselves to operate just below the anaerobic threshold until near the end of the course

Beginners are often criticized for putting in a &quot;J&quot; profile effort, meaning that they often go out too hard in the beginning, compensate by reducing their efforts in the middle, and then realize towards the end that they have not put out enough effort during the race. As a result, the time trial is often considered the most difficult part of any major competition for young cyclists.

==Time trial equipment==

Special aerodynamic time trial bicycles, clothing, helmets, aerobars and other equipment are often used in ITT events. Generally, components are designed to be as aerodynamic as possible, as most of the rider&#x27;s effort goes into overcoming aerodynamic drag. The rider&#x27;s position makes the greatest difference, and most use the now-standard tuck position, using tribars to allow the rider to position their arms inline with the wind and allow their back to sit as low and flat as possible, reducing frontal area and improving air flow around the body. TT bikes often have lower handlebars than normal road racing bikes to facilitate this. Also, the saddle is sometimes moved forwards relative to the handlebars and bottom bracket to allow the hips a more natural angle of motion, improving performance (for UCI-sanctioned events, the saddle must be a certain distance behind a vertical line drawn through the center of the bottom bracket).

Up until the late 1980s, low-profile &#x27;bullhorn&#x27; handlebars were used, and normal drop handlebars before them. Then in the late 1980s triathletes developed so-called tri-bars that allowed for a much better aerodynamic position. They were first brought into the time trialling public eye in the 1989 Tour de France when Greg LeMond overcame a 50-second deficit in the final day&#x27;s time trial to win the Tour by 8 seconds from Frenchman Laurent Fignon. Fignon was using conventional handlebars, Lemond the new triathlon style. The concept has changed little since then, with only Scotsman Graeme Obree attempting to improve the idea. His arms-under-the-torso tuck was revolutionary, helping him and others to break world records and win World Championships. The UCI banned it in 1994, but he came back with the &#x27;Superman&#x27; position, an evolution of the traditional tri position, but with the arms fully stretched out in front. This was also banned, and there are now strict rules governing the dimensions of handlebars, which can make life difficult for taller riders who fall outside the defined parameters and must adapt their positions to fit the rules.

Equipment used is very specialized, and component manufacturers can spend vast sums of time and money on wind tunnel testing to ensure their product is faster than the competition&#x27;s. Deep section or solid disc wheels are often used to reduce turbulence around the spokes, but these can affect handling in windy conditions. In the UK the front wheel must have a minimum of 45% open area when viewed from the side, for safety reasons. UCI events still permit the use of disc wheels for the front, but it is very unusual. Many components are modified for aerodynamic efficiency, and manufacturers are now developing more integrated systems, such as brakes built into the fork or frame so as not to disturb the airflow.

Clothing is also different for time trialing. One-piece skinsuits that do not flap in the wind are common; tight lycra shoe covers help improve airflow over buckles and straps; long pointed helmets channel air down the riders back (the position of the helmet above the rider&#x27;s back is crucial, it must be as close to the body as possible; too high and the air will just flow underneath the helmet. This is often hard to achieve as the rider moves his head due to the suffering endured during a hard race).

<doc id="348803" wikidata="Q4671173" url="?curid=348803" title="Academic dress of Durham University">
<text>The academic dress of Durham University has many similarities with that of other older British universities such as Oxford and Cambridge. Most colleges of Durham University insist on gowns being worn on formal occasions, including matriculation and formal halls (dinners); exceptions are Van Mildert, St Cuthbert&#x27;s Society (matriculation and selected dinners only), Collingwood, Stephenson, St Aidans, and The College of St Hild and St Bede (matriculation only). Some colleges also insist on their being worn to Junior Common Room meetings, and they are often seen in college chapels. At formal halls, only gowns are worn and doctors normally wear their undress gowns; for more ceremonial occasions full-dress gowns and hoods are worn by graduates. Until 1990, the General Regulations of university &#x27;recommended&#x27; the wearing of gowns by members of the university when attending divine service at the Cathedral – but this is now left to individual choice apart from at certain services (such as the Founders and Benefactors service). Gowns are also customarily worn to meetings of the university Senate by members of that body.

Regulations on the wearing of undergraduate gowns in college are technically set by the colleges themselves, but in many colleges the regulations are decided by the JCRs. Note that as some colleges do not wear undergraduate gowns, it is entirely possible to pass through an undergraduate degree at Durham, graduate &quot;in absentia&quot;, and never have to wear a gown. Alternatively, by attending a college with frequent formals (twice a week at Castle, Chad&#x27;s and Hatfield) and attending evensong at the cathedral regularly, it is possible to spend a fair proportion of one&#x27;s time whilst attending the university in a gown.

Regulations on academic dress can be found in the University Calendar.

The official robemakers to the University are William Gray and Son. The company, successor to Sewell and Son, was established in 1871 and currently has premises on Neville Street.

==Gowns==
There are four main gowns in the Durham scheme, corresponding to the four levels within the university: Undergraduates, Bachelors, Masters, and Doctors. With the exception of the full-dress doctors&#x27; gowns, all Durham gowns are black. For a further explanation of gown classifications, see Groves classification system.

===Undergraduates===
A knee-length gown gathered at the yoke with elbow-length square sleeves, but with the forearm seam opened about four inches from the bottom. Different undergraduate gowns have been used for different faculties at various times. The original undergraduate gown was short, similar to that used at Oxford, but this was changed after a petition from the students to Senate to a longer gown, similar to the Oxford scholars gown. At some time (described as &quot;recent&quot; in 1932) an attempt was made to introduce a purple undergraduate gown, but this did not catch on. In 1904 the undergraduate gowns were:
:Arts, Science and Education – no trimming on sleeve
:Theology – pointed sleeves rather than square
:Medicine – gimp trimming on sleeve

In 1936 the undergraduate gowns were:
:Arts – no trimming on sleeve
:Medicine – gimp trimming on sleeve
:Science – black velvet trimming on sleeve.

The Science and Arts gowns remained the same in 1995, and Commerce used the same gown as arts, while Medicine was no longer offered at Durham after 1963. The shape is [u4] in the Groves classification system. The Arts, Commerce and Science gowns remained in 2012, with the Theology gown returning and being described as Oxford BA [b8] shape.

The Hild and Bede college gown, retained from before the college became a constituent college of the university, differs from other Durham gowns in being made of brocaded fabric and being shorter ([u5] – the same shape as the Oxford commoner&#x27;s gown). The St Chad&#x27;s undergraduate gown (rarely seen outside of matriculation) is the same shape as the Arts gown, but adds two black buttons at the lower end of the forearm, joined across the slit by 5 inches of twisted green cord.

==== Scholars ====
Scholars also wear a distinctive gown. In 1904 this followed the pattern of the Arts gown but with no opening on the arm seam ([u2] – the same as the Oxford scholar&#x27;s gown), and this remained the case in 1995. In 2011 the university sanctioned the use of a different gown, described as &quot;Black cord, pointed sleeve, with cord and button, edged with palatinate ribbon one inch wide.&quot;

===Bachelors===
A full-length gown, coming to somewhere between mid-calf and the ankle, with pointed sleeves hanging down almost as far and a black cord and button on the yoke. The major difference between this and the BA gown worn at many other British universities is that the forearm seam is opened for 15–25 cm above the wrist, where it is held closed with a button and loop. The arm can then be passed through the opening so the arm is exposed from around the elbow rather than being covered to the wrist. The shape is referred to as [b5] in the Groves classification system.

The bachelors&#x27; gown is used by all bachelors. It is also used for the four-year integrated masters&#x27; courses, such as the MEng and the MSci, and for postgraduate diplomas and certificates.

===Masters===
The masters&#x27; gown is identical to the Oxford MA gown [m1], with the addition of a black cord and button on the yoke. It has long, rectangular sleeves that are closed at the ends, with a crescent cut out of each sleeve-end, and a horizontal arm-slit just above the elbow.

The masters&#x27; gown is used for post-graduate masters courses and as the undress gown for doctors (the only exceptions being the MMus and undress DMus gowns - see &#x27;Music degrees&#x27; below). Doctors of Divinity wear the masters&#x27; gown with a black silk scarf, while the junior doctors (PhDs and EdDs) are distinguished by a palatinate cord and button on the yoke.

===Doctors===
The doctors&#x27; full-dress gown is a scarlet cassimere gown, except brocaded white satin for DMus and scarlet Panama for the DBA and DThM, in the Oxford shape [d2]: gathered at the yoke and with bell sleeves. The sleeves and facings are in a coloured silk (see below).

====Doctors&#x27; silks====
The colour of the silk on the gown&#x27;s sleeves and facings indicates which doctorate the wearer holds. The colours of the silk are:

*Junior doctors:
**EdD (Doctor of Education) – facings scarlet trimmed with 1 inch palatinate on the inside and the sleeves (from the bottom) 4 inches palatinate and 4 inches white
**PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) – scarlet trimmed with 1 inch palatinate on the inside of the facings and the top of the sleeves
**DBA (Doctor of Business Administration) – facings with white silk and bound on the inside edge with palatinate purple silk.
**MD (Doctor of Medicine) – facings and sleeves palatinate cassimere and red silk
**DThM (Doctor of Theology and Ministry) – facings red silk trimmed with 1 inch palatinate silk and the sleeves 8 inches palatinate silk trimmed with one inch black silk at the top
*Higher doctors:
**DMus (Doctor of Music) – palatinate
**DLitt (Doctor of Letters) – old gold satin
**DSc (Doctor of Science) – scarlet
**DCL (Doctor of Civil Law) – white
**DD (Doctor of Divinity) – palatinate

===Music Gowns===
The MMus and undress DMus gowns use the Oxford lay gown [d4], which is similar in shape to the masters&#x27; gown but with a flap collar covering the yoke and with inverted T-shaped armholes rather than straight horizontal cuts. Additionally there are panels of lace (known as gimp) near the foot of the gown and (on the DMus undress gown) on the sleeves. Instead of this panel, the MMus gown has a row of lace running from the armholes to the base of the sleeves.

==Hoods==
Durham has two types of hoods for its degrees: Oxford simple shape [S1], consisting of just a cowl and liripipe, and full shape, consisting of a cowl and cape. Of the full hoods, there are three variants: the BA shape [f6] with a large semi-circular cape and long thin liripipe; the BSc shape [f7] with a shorter cape with rounded corners and a broad liripipe and rounded corners to the cape; and the doctors&#x27; shape [f4], which is similar to the BCL but with the cowl edge cut at 80 degrees to the cape and the liripipe sticking out at a 45 degree angle. Hoods may be made of silk or stuff (material other than silk – normally cotton). The shape in which the hood is made is governed only by tradition, but the materials and colours used are laid down in the university regulations. Many of the hoods feature palatinate – a particular shade of purple that is associated with the university.

===Theological college courses===
St John&#x27;s College has its own hood for graduates of its ministerial training course: of the Durham BSc pattern, in black stuff, the cowl faced inside with 2&quot; blue silk. St Chad&#x27;s College, which ceased to be a full-time theological college in the early 1970s, nevertheless had a hood for graduates of the part-time training course associated with the college: Cambridge MA pattern, the cowl faced inside with 2&quot; olive-green silk. This was later superseded by the current pattern, Oxford simple-shape, faced inside with 2&quot; olive-green silk and lined with blue-green brocade.

===Bachelors===

Bachelors&#x27; hoods are full-shape made with black stuff except for the BSc and LLB (made with palatinate silk). The BA uses its own specific full-shape [f6], while other bachelor&#x27;s degrees use the BSc shape [f7]. The hoods are:

*BA (Bachelor of Arts) Part lined with white fur and trimmed with white fur on the cape.
*BSc (Bachelor of Science) Palatinate bound white fur with a 0.5 inch scarlet band inside the fur
*LLB (Bachelor of Laws) Maroon edged with white fur
*BPhil (Bachelor of Philosophy) Part lined with 4 inches of white silk and trimmed with white fur on the cape
*BEng (Bachelor of Engineering) Scarlet bordered with 3 inches palatinate and trimmed with white fur on the cape

*BPhys (Bachelor of Physics) Palatinate silk, bound with white fur and a 0.5 inch dark purple ribbon on the outer edge

===Masters===
All masters use full shape hoods except for the MA, MEd, MSW and MAnth which use the simple shape. All masters&#x27; hoods are made in black silk except for the MJur, MRes, MSW and MAnth, which are made in palatinate silk. They are lined as follows:

*Postgraduate master&#x27;s:
**MA (Master of Arts) Palatinate
**MBA (Master of Business Administration) Palatinate with a border of white, bound scarlet on both sides

**PgCert (Postgraduate Certificate): Black outer, self-lined black, trimmed with a single row of 0.5 inch palatinate ribbon

===Doctors===
Doctors wear full-shape hoods with round-cornered capes. All these hoods are of scarlet cassimere, except DMus and DSc (which are made of brocaded white satin and palatinate cassimere respectively). The linings are generally the same colours as the sleeves and facings and the gowns:

*Higher Doctors:
**DD (Doctor of Divinity) Palatinate
**DCL (Doctor of Civil Law) White
**DSc (Doctor of Science) Scarlet
**DLitt (Doctor of Letters) Old Gold
**DMus (Doctor of Music) Palatinate
*Junior Doctors:
**PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) Lined scarlet bound 1 inch palatinate on all edges
**EdD (Doctor of Education) Lined white bound 3 inches palatinate on all edges
**DBA (Doctor of Business Administration) Not made of cassimere but rather wool Panama, lined with white silk and bound on all edges with palatinate purple silk one inch wide.

==Caps==
Gown and hoods are worn for graduations, but mortarboards are not part of the university&#x27;s academic dress, except for higher doctors in full dress, who wear soft square hats (known as John Knox caps [h3]) with a tump at the centre of the crown rather than mortarboards or Tudor bonnets.

==Degrees no longer awarded==
The following degrees, at one time or another, have ceased to be awarded by the University of Durham. Those in &quot;italics&quot; were linked to departments based in Newcastle upon Tyne; when, in 1963, Newcastle became a university in its own right, it retained the academical dress associated with these degrees and for the most part continues to use it.

Except where noted, the standard bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s gown was worn (see above).

When, in the 1990s, Durham University re-instituted the degree of LLB (previously associated with the Newcastle division and latterly with Newcastle University), it adopted a design of hood which was essentially the old hood reversed (see above) – though for some reason this logic was not followed with the re-instituted LLM 
The old BCL degree was rebranded as MJur at about the same time – leading to the peculiarity of a fur hood being worn with a master&#x27;s gown for this degree. As a research degree of 50,000 words, the thesis requirement of the MJur is greater than that required for the LLM.

==University officials==
The Chancellor of the university wears a gown of black brocaded satin trimmed with gold lace in a distinctive pattern unique to the Universities of Durham and Newcastle. The Vice-Chancellor &amp; Warden and the Pro-Vice-Chancellors wear black silk gowns with identical lace trimming, but in silver rather than gold. A scarlet habit is worn beneath these gowns (see below); at the neck, the chancellor wears a lace jabot, the Vice-Chancellor and his/her deputies wear white tie and bands. A black velvet mortar-board, with gold or silver tassel as appropriate, is also worn.

The office of Proctor is in abeyance at Durham, but a distinctive form of dress is prescribed for these officials, viz: a black silk gown, sleeves and front faced with black velvet and sleeves lined with palatinate purple silk; black velvet mortar-board; black velvet hood lined with palatinate purple silk.

==Habits==
In Durham, the early statutes require the wearing of a Convocation Habit &#x27;under the gown&#x27; (though later statutes say &#x27;with the gown&#x27; rather than under it). Pre-World War II graduation photographs frequently show Durham doctors who are members of Convocation wearing the habit beneath their full-dress doctoral gown and hood. The Chancellor and the Vice-Chancellor were formerly directed to wear the Convocation Habit under their gold- and silver-laced gowns, &quot;or Scarlet Habit if not holding a Doctorate&quot;. This latter usage is followed to this day, the Habit being sleeved like a cassock).

<doc id="348806" wikidata="Q574437" url="?curid=348806" title="Armand Carrel">
<text>Jean-Baptiste Nicolas Armand Carrel (8 May 1800 – 25 July 1836) was a French journalist and political writer.

==Early life==
He was born at Rouen. His father was a wealthy merchant, and he received a liberal education at the &quot;Lycée Pierre Corneille&quot; in Rouen, afterwards attending the military school at St Cyr. He had a deep admiration for the great generals of Napoleon, and his uncompromising spirit and independent views marked him as a leader. Entering the army as sub-lieutenant, he took a secret but active part in the unsuccessful Belfort Conspiracy. At the outbreak of war with Spain in 1823, Carrel, whose sympathies were with the liberal cause, resigned, and succeeded in escaping to Barcelona. He enrolled in the foreign legion and fought gallantly against his former comrades. The legion was compelled to surrender near Figueres, and Carrel was taken prisoner by his former general, Damas. There was considerable difficulty about the terms of his capitulation, and one council of war condemned Carrel to death. The sentence was not carried out, and he was soon acquitted and freed.

==Career in Journalism==
His career as a soldier being finally over, Carrel decided to devote himself to literature. He went to Paris and began as secretary to Augustin Thierry, the historian. His services were found to be of great value, and he obtained admirable training as a writer, and lead himself to investigate interesting events of British history. His first work of importance (he had already written some historical abstracts) was the &quot;History of the Counter-Revolution in England&quot;, a political study of the events that culminated in the &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot;.

He gradually became known as a journalist for various periodicals; but it was not until he formed his connection with &quot;Le National&quot;, a daily founded in 1830, that he became a power in France. At first, &quot;Le National&quot; was a collaborative effort by Adolphe Thiers, François Mignet, Auguste Sautelet, and Carrel; but after the July Revolution of 1830, Thiers and Mignet assumed office, and the entire management of the publication was left in Carrel&#x27;s hands. Under his direction the journal became the foremost political organ in Paris. His judgment was unusually clear, his principles solid and well founded, his sincerity and honesty beyond question; and to these qualities, he united an admirable style, lucid, precise and well-balanced.

As the defender of democracy, Carrel faced serious dangers. Once, he was sent to Sainte-Pélagie Prison, and he appeared several times before the Tribunal of Paris to answer for his journal. In July 1835, he was one of a number of newspaper editors and writers arrested in the aftermath of Giuseppe Marco Fieschi&#x27;s attempted assassination of King Louis Philippe I.

==Death==
Carrel had previously fought two duels with editors of rival papers. The third dispute, which led to his duel with Émile de Girardin was minor, and might have been amicably settled had it not been for Carrel&#x27;s own obstinacy. The meeting took place on the morning of 22 July 1836 in the Paris suburb of Saint-Mandé. De Girardin was wounded in the thigh, Carrel in the groin. The wound immediately appeared to be dangerous, and Carrel was carried to the house of a friend where he died two days later, at age 36.

==Legacy==
Carrel&#x27;s works were published in five volumes with biographical notes by Émile Littré, (Paris, 1858).

In the 19th arrondissement of Paris, the Place Armand-Carrel (in French) and the Rue Armand-Carrel (in French) are named after him. The former was named in an 1879 decree.

<doc id="348810" wikidata="Q162247" url="?curid=348810" title="Therion (band)">
<text>Therion (formerly Blitzkrieg) is a Swedish symphonic metal band founded by Christofer Johnsson in 1987. Its name was inspired by the Celtic Frost album &quot;To Mega Therion&quot;. &quot;To Mega Therion&quot; is Greek for &quot;The Great Beast&quot; and was a title used by occultist Aleister Crowley. Originally a death metal band, Therion adjusted its musical style by adding orchestral elements, including choirs, classical musicians, and even a full orchestra at their concert performances. As a result, they are considered pioneers of the symphonic metal genre.

Therion takes its themes for the lyrics from different mythologies and practices, including occultism, magic and ancient traditions and writings.

==History==

===Blitzkrieg and Megatherion (1987–1988)===

Therion originated as the band Blitzkrieg in Upplands Väsby, Sweden. In 1987, Christofer Johnsson, who had played bass for three months, teamed up with guitarist Peter Hansson, whom he had met in several musical groups, and drummer Oskar Forss, who was Johnsson&#x27;s old schoolmate. The band&#x27;s main influences were Metallica and Slayer, but its sound resembled Venom and Motörhead. The band had only two concerts. In March 1988, it split up after some disagreements with Forss.

In 1988, the band reformed with the moniker Megatherion, which was based on the album title &quot;To Mega Therion&quot; by the Swiss heavy metal band Celtic Frost. Johnsson has mentioned that &quot;therion&quot; is Greek for &quot;beast&quot; and likens it to Belphegor. Johnsson switched from bass to guitar and Peter Hansson played guitar. Johan Hansson (who would later form the Swedish death metal band Crematory) became its bassist, and Mika Tovalainen its drummer. After the band shortened its name to &quot;Therion&quot;, Erik Gustafsson of Dismember replaced Johan Hansson as the bassist, and Oskar Forss returned and replaced Tovalainen as the drummer. Matti Kärki, later to be the front man of Dismember, also joined the band and took over the vocals.

===Demos and record deals (1989–1993)===
In 1989, Therion released two demos: &quot;Paroxysmal Holocaust&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Darkest Veils of Inner Wickedness&quot;. Matti had left the band shortly after the first demo, so Christofer took over the vocals again. In 1990, the band worked with House of Kicks, a local record store, to print and release the &quot;Time Shall Tell&quot; demo on 12 inch vinyl. The latest release enabled the band the sign a one-album record deal with Deaf Records.

Therion&#x27;s first full-length album, &quot;Of Darkness...&quot;, released in 1991, featured songs that Johnsson had composed in the 1980s. The band called it &quot;both a debut album and the end of an era&quot;, and described it as progressive death metal, since it contained elements that did not quite fit the standards of death metal at the time. The lyrics were very political, in the vein of Napalm Death, Nuclear Assault and other late-1980s hardcore punk bands.

Therion signed with Active Records for its second album, &quot;Beyond Sanctorum&quot;. Prior to the recording sessions, Gustafsson left the band to return to the United States, so Therion continued as a trio with Hansson, Forss and Johnsson, the last of whom covered the bass. The album shows a more experimental edge to the death metal music; keyboard and clean vocals were used sparingly.

After the recording, Therion changed members again. Forss left the band, and Hansson had to quit for health issues. For the Central European gigs, Johnsson brought in drummer Piotr Wawrzeniuk from his other band Carbonized, bassist Andreas Wahl, and Magnus Barthelsson who was an old friend from school.

===Musical metamorphosis (1993–1996)===
In order to scale down operations, Active Records had stopped releasing new records and transferred the band to Megarock Records. They released &quot;Symphony Masses: Ho Drakon Ho Megas&quot; in 1993. Its style combined death metal and doom metal, with elements of Middle Eastern music, industrial music, traditional 1980s heavy metal, classical music and religious chanting. &quot;Symphony Masses&quot; sold about 10,000 copies, which was more than the band&#x27;s first two albums, but hardly a financial success. As the band&#x27;s touring gigs were not that profitable, Barthelsson and Wahl quit the band, and Fredrik Isaksson was brought in as the new bassist. After a hiatus where Johnsson worked as a vocalist for Messiah, they received an offer to join metal label Nuclear Blast. Megarock Records, lacking the resources to properly promote the band, decided to release Therion without any strings attached. Therion signed with Nuclear Blast in 1994, and has remained with them since.

Therion&#x27;s first album with Nuclear Blast was &quot;Lepaca Kliffoth&quot;, with its single &quot;The Beauty in Black&quot; released in advance of the album. To Johnsson&#x27;s surprise, &quot;The Beauty in Black&quot; sold 12,000 copies in Europe, before the company stopped printing. The album experimented with more elements: &quot;a classic soprano and bass-baritone, more keyboards, more Persian influences, more melodies&quot;. Johnsson had &quot;a new style of singing&quot; that severed their ties to death metal. The album sold around 15,000 copies over the following weeks. Isaksson had some personal problems, and was eventually released from the band. Therion brought in bassist Lars Rosenberg from the death metal band Entombed. The band toured with Annihilator in Germany, and also did a small headlining tour in Argentina and Chile.

===Symphonic metal beginning (1996–2001)===

In 1996, Therion recorded their experimental album &quot;Theli&quot;. The album heavily featured the vocals of two choirs, as well as vocals from Johnsson, Wawrzeniuk and guest vocalist Dan Swanö. The album featured keyboards and classic samples, which was labeled the &quot;Barmbek Symphony Orchestra&quot; after the subway station next to the studio. Jason Ankeny of Allmusic noted that the album &quot;was almost universally acclaimed as the apex of Therion&#x27;s career to date, fully realizing Johnsson&#x27;s taste for elaborate, operatic grandeur&quot;. In a month, the album sold 75,000, more than double that of &quot;Lepaca Kliffoth&quot;.

Personal issues plagued the band&#x27;s members. Jonas Mellberg, who had joined as a guitarist from Unanimated, had severe alcohol problems, and walked out during the mixing and mastering sessions. Wawrzeniuk was busy with his studies, so Johnsson brought in more members for their tours, including Tommy Eriksson of Shadowseeds. Rosenberg&#x27;s drinking problems got worse and he was fired from the band.

In 1997, Therion released &quot;A&#x27;arab Zaraq - Lucid Dreaming&quot;, which contained unreleased songs from &quot;Theli&quot;, some covers, and Johnsson&#x27;s soundtrack that he produced for a short art movie called &quot;The Golden Embrace&quot;.

Johnsson noted that the next album, &quot;Vovin&quot;, was practically a solo album as it used studio musicians instead of the ones from the &quot;Theli&quot; tour, besides Eriksson, who provided some guitar support. &quot;Vovin&quot; was recorded at Woodhouse Studios; it involved a real string orchestra for the first time, and a &quot;hand picked opera choir&quot; which included Austrian singer Martina Hornbacher, and British vocalist Sarah Jezebel Deva. The album was released in 1998, and in two months, sales had reached 150,000 in Europe alone, doubling sales of &quot;Theli&quot;.

The band toured with Moonspell and showcased Hornbacher and Deva on vocals. It brought in Sami Karppinen as the drummer, Kristian Niemann on guitar, and his brother Johan Niemann on bass. The album &quot;Crowning of Atlantis&quot;, released in 1999, was a mini-album that was padded to full-length with covers and live tracks.

The band&#x27;s next release, &quot;Deggial&quot;, involved the participation of a full orchestra. Johnsson noted it was 90% another solo album, but with a more permanent band lineup. &quot;Deggial&quot; sold more copies than &quot;Theli&quot; but not as many as &quot;Vovin&quot;.

===&quot;Secret of the Runes&quot; (2001–2002)===
Johnsson had written seven songs but shelved them in order to make a Nordic concept album. He built a recording studio for the band called &quot;Modern Art&quot;. The band&#x27;s tenth album, &quot;Secret of the Runes&quot;, was released in 2001, and had themes from the nine worlds of Norse mythology. It included the cover songs of &quot;Crying Days&quot; (Scorpions) and &quot;Summer Night City&quot; (ABBA), of which, Piotr Wawrzeniuk provided vocals. The album received positive reviews, and was an Allmusic editors&#x27; pick. Therion headlined tours in Europe and Latin America with Evergrey and My Insanity. Afterwards, Karppinen left the band to focus as a sound engineer for Modern Art, but brought in replacement drummer Richard Evensand.

In 2001, Therion released the compilation album &quot;Bells of Doom&quot; to its official fan club. It includes recordings from the Blitzkrieg days in 1987, demos from 1989 that did not appear on any album, and an unofficial promotional demo from 1994 that enabled the band to land the record deal with Nuclear Blast. The album was later sold through Therion&#x27;s webstore. In 2002, Therion released its first concert album &quot;Live in Midgård&quot;, which contained recordings from its &quot;Secret of the Runes&quot; tour. Mostly drawing from its Budapest concert, the album was released to commemorate the band&#x27;s 15th anniversary.

===&quot;Lemuria&quot; and &quot;Sirius B&quot; (2004–2006)===

After the &quot;Secret of the Runes&quot; tour, the band had amassed 55 unreleased songs which included the ones Johnsson had shelved as well as contributions from the Niemann brothers. Johnsson remarked that &quot;we went through the songs and realized that we had enough good material for three albums. Recording one after the other, promoting, and touring each one separately would have taken several years and would have been a bad idea; and being so productive, we would have had another 55 songs waiting when we finally came to the end of it.&quot; In 2004, the band released 21 tracks on two albums: &quot;Lemuria&quot; and &quot;Sirius B&quot;. The albums were released simultaneously and were available as separate albums or a twin-pack. 171 musicians participated, including the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and a 32-member choir. Contributing to lead vocals were Mats Levén and a returning Piotr Wawrzeniuk.

In July 2005, the band released &quot;Atlantis Lucid Dreaming&quot;, which is a compilation of the 1997 tracks that were not part of &quot;The Golden Embrace&quot; soundtrack (not including its Iron Maiden cover of &quot;Children of the Damned&quot;), and seven tracks from its 1999 album &quot;Crowning of Atlantis&quot;. It included a bonus live version of &quot;Black Sun&quot;.

The band toured &quot;Lemuria / Sirius B&quot; over two years and 106 shows, with its final performance at the ProgPower Festival in Cheltenham, UK on 21 March 2006. The last gig marked Johnsson&#x27;s final vocal stage performance.

Therion released their first DVD set, &quot;Celebrators of Becoming&quot;, in May 2006. The set contains four DVDs which include concert footage from its 2004 visit to Mexico City, documentaries of its 2004–2006 World Tour, Johnsson&#x27;s art movie &quot;The Golden Embrace&quot;, the band&#x27;s music video singles, bootlegs and commentaries, and two audio CDs from its Mexico City concert.

===&quot;Gothic Kabbalah&quot;, live classical shows and the 20th Anniversary Tour (2006–2007)===
In September 2006, Johnsson announced that recording was completed for a new album with 9 songs written by then drummer, Petter Karlsson. &quot;Gothic Kabbalah&quot; was released on 12 January 2007, and was followed with a tour through Europe, North and South America with Grave Digger and with support act Sabaton. Therion also toured Japan for the first time. The band&#x27;s Warsaw gig was recorded for the live album and video set &quot;Live Gothic&quot;, which was released in 2008.

In these times Therion held live shows that included local symphonic orchestras and choirs. The &quot;Therion Goes Classic&quot; show took place on 9 December 2006, in Bucharest, Romania. Another show followed at the Miskolc Opera Festival in Miskolc, Hungary on 16 June 2007, with future band member Lori Lewis as its featured vocalist. The first half of the show featured orchestral pieces from Dvořák, Verdi, Mozart, Saint-Saëns and Wagner. The second half pulled from Therion&#x27;s repertoire. The song &quot;Clavicula Nox&quot; was featured as a full orchestral version in the first half. The Bucharest concert was broadcast on Romanian television, and its first part was later released together with the entire Miskolc concert as the DVD/CD box set &quot;The Miskolc Experience&quot; in June 2009.

In November–December 2007, Therion had a 20-year anniversary tour with 16 shows in Europe. Songs included &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; parts 1 and 2, the entire &quot;Theli&quot; album, and &quot;Adulruna Rediviva&quot;. Part of the set list was determined by fan voting. Some songs were accompanied by keyboardist Ferdy Doernberg and a belly dancer on stage, and some of the shows featured also the ex-singers Piotr Wawrzeniuk and Mats Levén. The Budapest gig of the tour was recorded, but it was released only in February 2014 as a part of the DVD &quot;Adulruna Rediviva and Beyond&quot;.

===New line up and &quot;Sitra Ahra&quot; (2008–2011)===
In 2008, the band announced that its core group of musicians would be parting ways, but Johnsson posted that he was in no way ending Therion. Johan Koleberg became the new drummer, and Nalle Påhlsson the bassist. The band did not tour that year, except for a single open-air festival show in Płock, Poland on 6 September.

On 10 May 2009, following the release of &quot;The Miskolc Experience&quot;, Therion announced Thomas Vikström as its new lead vocalist. 
The band worked on a new album, &quot;Sitra Ahra&quot;, which featured new guitarist Christian Vidal, and Snowy Shaw on vocals.

&quot;Sitra Ahra&quot; was released on 17 September 2010 The band toured South and Central America for 17 days, and European tour through November and December.

In March 2011, &quot;Gothic Kabbalah&quot; singer Katarina Lilja left the band for a second time to &quot;re-join the boring civil world and not be a cool rock star anymore&quot;. Thomas Vikström&#x27;s daughter, Linnéa, provided supporting vocals for the band since the Bloodstock Open Air festival in 2011. Therion performed at Hellfest Summer Open Air, ProgPower USA, and the 2012 cruise liner based festival 70000 Tons of Metal. In a Bloodstock interview, Shaw mentioned that the band will work on new material at the end of the year. In September 2011, after four years of collaboration and session work, vocalist Lori Lewis joined Therion as a member. In this year also a board game called &quot;011&quot; was released; it features the band members and is based on the &quot;Sitra Ahra&quot; album.

===&quot;Les Fleurs du Mal&quot; and Luciferian Light Orchestra (2012–2016)===

On 14 February 2012, Therion announced it was recording a studio album and had planned a 25th Anniversary Tour. &quot;Les Fleurs du Mal&quot; was released on September 28. The album is considered by Johnsson to be an &quot;art project&quot;, which includes not only the music, but also special inlay graphics and video clips - in 2015 partly released on a limited edition DVD called &quot;Garden Of Evil&quot;. The album consisted of covers of French chansons and pop songs that were performed in the band&#x27;s style. On the release day the 25th Anniversary Tour was also started through Europe, also featuring the album&#x27;s contributing keyboardist Stefan Jernståhl. Some leftover songs were released on an EP &quot;Les Épaves&quot; in the end of 2015.

On 14 September, Johnsson posted a statement on the band&#x27;s website about developing a rock metal opera, and that the band will not be doing any major tours or releasing studio albums. According to this, in 2013 the band was to play only at three minor summer festivals in Europe. In April 2013 this statement was reconsidered by Johnsson itself, and the Rock Opera Unveiled Tour was scheduled for December 2013 with 15 European gigs, to test the fans&#x27; acceptance of the new material. The main framework of these shows included excerpts from the future rock opera, and the entire Vovin album due to its 15th anniversary.

On 21 February 2014 two new releases were put on market: a deluxe edition of &quot;Theli&quot; – including three bonus tracks from &quot;A&#x27;arab Zaraq – Lucid Dreaming&quot; and a DVD with &quot;Theli&quot;″s live performance – and a DVD set &quot;Adulruna Rediviva and Beyond&quot; with the 2007 Anniversary concert in Budapest and the 2011 Atlanta show.

In 2014 the Rock Opera unveiled tour has continued with a Latin American leg, which has also meant – &quot;due to family- and work-related reasons&quot; – the last live performances of Lori Lewis. However, she has remained a band member for studio performances. The new touring singer has become Sandra Laureano, debuting on the Summer festival gigs and the tour for the first time in China and through entire Russia in October 2014. The Russian leg of this tour was made upon the invitation of their 2013 tour support band Arkona, and drums were played by their former member Sami Karppinen, as Johan Koleberg was not able to tour with them.
However, Sandra as a dramatic soprano did not suit for every song, so she was replaced first by coloratura Isa García Navas, and later Chiara Malvestiti to sing in the shows.

In 2015 Johnsson worked on another side project, called Luciferian Light Orchestra, which features songs in the &#x27;70s occult rock style. An eponymous album was also released in that year, accompanied by on-stage appearances as support of Therion&#x27;s 2015 Latin American and 2016 European tours, featuring Vidal and Påhlsson (both of them masked) on guitar. In addition to the last two tours, Therion had the very first acoustic gigs in Latin America and on 3 July 2016 in Bucharest.

CDs and DVDs related to the side projects were not released by Nuclear Blast, but by Johnsson&#x27;s own label, Adulruna.

===&quot;Beloved Antichrist&quot; (2017–2019)===

On 13 November 2016 the band announced that Johan Koleberg had decided to leave the band &quot;due to different goals in playing music&quot;. For the 2017 live gigs the former Amon Amarth member Fredrik Andersson filled in, then on 21 November 2017 Sami Karppinen officially re-joined.

On 26 January, Johnsson revealed he had been suffering from intense pain in the neck and shoulders, and he was diagnosed with two spinal disc herniations (allegedly resulting from years of headbanging), and he was at risk of losing the ability to perform live. As a result, the rock opera project was delayed and the band downplayed their sets of songs in concerts to allow Johnsson to perform. By 8 April, Johnsson announced he had been able to avoid surgery as his condition had improved through physiotherapy, and the band would resume performing at festivals by August.

Johnsson also arranged the orchestration of Sabaton&#x27;s stage show with symphonic orchestra, performed on 13 July 2017 at the Masters Of Rock festival in Vizovice, Czech Republic.

On 15 August 2017, the band announced the title and the release date of an operatic rock musical. &quot;Beloved Antichrist&quot; – inspired by and partly based on Vladimir Solovyov&#x27;s &quot;Tale of the Antichrist&quot; – containing over 3 hours of music, and 29 vocal characters was scheduled for 26 January 2018, later postponed first to 2 February and finally to 9 February.

In 2018 a European and a Latin American tour was scheduled, later also extended for China, and – for the very first time – Australia. After the last show of the tour, Linnéa Vikström ended the collaboration with the band and was replaced by the new touring member Rosalía Sairem. 

On 10 August 2019 Nalle Påhlsson has decided to withdraw from touring, and remain only a member for songwriting and studio recordings. For the year&#x27;s only remaining show Justin Biggs from the band Sorcerer was standing in.

===The &quot;Leviathan&quot; trilogy (2020–present)===

The first &quot;Leviathan&quot; album was released on 22 January 2021, partly with Snowy Shaw on drums. A sequel, titled &quot;Leviathan II&quot;, was released on 26 October 2022. 

The 2022 festival shows of the band featured again Johan Koleberg on drums, as Sami Karppinen took over the duties on Opeth&#x27;s concerts after the leaving of Martin Axenrot. For the end of the year a European tour was scheduled, but cancelled due to problems with their booking agent and also stating increased costs of touring contributing to the decision. Instead of it only four shows were played in Malta, Greece and Turkey in January 2023, subsequently followed by a long Latin-American tour, which included 18 shows in Mexico. 

After more than 30 years at Nuclear Blast the band has signed on 27 April 2023 to Napalm Records. The third and final installment album, &quot;Leviathan III&quot;, was released already by the new label on 15 December 2023. 

The conclusion of the trilogy was followed up by a tour through Europe and China in February and March 2024. As Chiara Malvestiti became unable to stand on stage due to her pregnancy and childbirth the year before, Lori Lewis returned as a touring singer too. The tour was preceded by the band&#x27;s third show with orchestra and choir in Mexico City on 20 January 2024, which didn&#x27;t feature any covers, and deviated only slightly from the tour&#x27;s setlist. The second leg of the tour went through Turkey and Latin America in Autumn 2024.

==Influences==
Therion draws its influences from several different bands. The name comes from Celtic Frost&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;To Mega Therion&quot; and much of its music prior to &quot;Theli&quot; was inspired by the 1987 album &quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot;. For &quot;Theli&quot;, the band drew from Pink Floyd&#x27;s album &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; and progressive rock group Klaatu&#x27;s album &quot;Hope&quot;.

From &quot;Vovin&quot; onwards, the band has drawn inspiration from classical composers like Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss, heavy metal acts from the 1980s like Iron Maiden, Accept, 1970s hard rock bands such as Scorpions, Uriah Heep, Judas Priest, and &quot;tons of progressive &#x27;70s bands that nobody knows anymore these days&quot;.

==Symbols==

The symbols on Therion&#x27;s album covers originate from magick and occult themes. The most common symbol is an {11:5} hendecagram, an eleven-pointed star. First appearing on the 1993 album &quot;Symphony Masses: Ho Drakon Ho Megas&quot;, and most album since, it symbolizes the night side of the Qabalah..

Other symbols include:
* Pythagorean pentagram (one point down), on the dragon&#x27;s head, for the cover of &quot;Symphony Masses: Ho Drakon Ho Megas&quot;.
* Nordic runes with Elder Fuþark alphabet, on the front cover and the booklet for the album &quot;Secret of the Runes&quot;.
* Celtic cross, on the booklet&#x27;s page for &quot;Helheim&quot; on the album &quot;Secret of the Runes&quot;.
* Clavicula Nox, a key symbol in Dragon Rouge and also the title of one of the band&#x27;s tracks, on the covers of &quot;Crowning of Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Vovin&quot; (inlay), and &quot;Eye of Shiva&quot;.
* Mjölnir, the Hammer of Thor, on the inlay cover of &quot;Secret of the Runes&quot;.
* The astronomical symbols Venus (♀), moon (☽), and sun (☉), on the covers for &quot;The Early Chapters of Revelation&quot; box-set.
* The Kabbalistic Tree of Life, seen on the &quot;Sitra Ahra&quot; album cover.

Topalov was born in Ruse, Bulgaria. His father taught him to play chess at the age of eight. Topalov quickly established himself as a chess prodigy. At age 12, Topalov began working with the controversial Silvio Danailov, a relationship that continues today.

In 1989 he won the World Under-14 Championship in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, and in 1990 won the silver medal at the World Under-16 Championship in Singapore. He became a Grandmaster in 1992 and won in Terrassa. He shared first at the Budapest Zonal group B in 1993 but struggled at the Biel Interzonal, scoring 5.5/13. He made his Olympiad debut in Moscow 1994, leading Bulgaria to a fourth-place, defeating Garry Kasparov on board one.

Over the next ten years Topalov ascended the world chess rankings. He played in Linares 1994 (6½/13), Linares 1995 (8/13), Amsterdam 1995. In a strong run of tournament performances in 1996 he placed third at Wijk aan Zee, tied for first at Amsterdam, Vienna and Madrid, won outright at Novgorod and shared first in Dos Hermanas. As early as 1996, he was being invited to events for the world&#x27;s elite such as Las Palmas (5/10), the first category 21 tournament, played in December 1996, with Kasparov, Anand, Kramnik and Karpov participating. The next year he won at Antwerp and Madrid.

Topalov&#x27;s loss to reigning Classical World Champion Garry Kasparov at the 1999 Corus chess tournament is generally hailed as one of the greatest games ever played. Kasparov later said, &quot;He looked up. Perhaps there was a sign from above that Topalov would play a great game today. It takes two, you know, to do that.&quot;

In 2001, he shared the overall title at Amber Melody and won at Dortmund.

In the knockout tournaments for the FIDE World Chess Championship, he reached the last 16 in 1999, the quarter-finals in 2000, the final 16 in 2001, and the semifinals in the 2004 tournament. In 2002, he lost the final of the Dortmund Candidates Tournament (for the right to challenge for the rival Classical World Chess Championship) to Peter Leko.

Topalov tied for first at the 2002 NAO Chess Masters in Cannes and won at Benidorm in 2003.

Topalov scored his first major success at Linares 2005, tying for first place with Garry Kasparov (though losing on tiebreak rules), and defeating Kasparov in the last round, in what was to be Kasparov&#x27;s last tournament game before his retirement. He followed this up with a one-point victory at Mtel Masters. In 2006 he tied for first at Corus with Anand.

=== 2005–2006: FIDE world chess champion ===
Based on his rating, Topalov was invited to the eight-player, double round-robin FIDE World Chess Championship in San Luis, Argentina, in September–October 2005. Scoring 6½/7 in the first cycle, Topalov had virtually clinched the tournament at the halfway mark, before drawing every game in the second cycle to win by 1½ points to become FIDE World Chess Champion. The average rating of the field in the championship was 2739, and Topalov&#x27;s performance rating was 2890.

On 16 April 2006, FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov announced that a match between Classical and FIDE World Champions Kramnik and Topalov would be held in September–October 2006 to re-unify the Championships after thirteen years of separation. Kramnik defeated Topalov to become the first undisputed champion in thirteen years.

On 28 September 2006, Topalov&#x27;s manager Silvio Danailov published a press release, casting suspicion on Kramnik&#x27;s behaviour during the games. The Bulgarian team made a public statement that Kramnik visited his private bathroom (the only place without any audio or video surveillance) unreasonably often, about fifty times per game (a number that FIDE officials later claimed to be exaggerated) and made the most significant decisions in the game in the bathroom.

They also demanded that the organizers of the tournament allow journalists access to the surveillance video from Kramnik&#x27;s room for games 1 through 4. The organizers made parts of the video available, explaining that other parts of it were missing due to technical issues. Danailov demanded to stop the use of private restrooms and bathrooms, and threatened to reconsider Topalov&#x27;s participation in the match. The Appeals Committee that governed the match agreed, and ruled that the players&#x27; private restrooms should be closed and replaced with a shared one.

Kramnik refused to play game 5 and was forfeited. On 1 October, the restroom issue was resolved in Kramnik&#x27;s favour and the Appeals Committee resigned and were replaced. The FIDE president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov decided that the current score of 3–2 should be preserved. He also indicated that this was not a compromise decision but his own. The match resumed on 2 October 2006.

On 1 October, the Association of Chess Professionals released a statement denouncing Danailov for publicly accusing his opponent without evidence, and calling for him to be investigated by the FIDE Ethics Committee.

On 3 October, Topalov said in a press conference, &quot;I believe that his (Kramnik&#x27;s) play is fair, and my decision to continue the match proves it&quot;. However, the next day, the crisis escalated, with Topalov&#x27;s manager strongly implying that Kramnik was receiving computer assistance.

On 14 December 2006, Topalov directly accused Kramnik of using computer assistance in their World Championship match. On 14 February 2007, Topalov&#x27;s manager released pictures, purporting to show cables in the ceiling of a toilet used by Kramnik during the World Championship match in Elista. They were supposedly reported to the authorities, who Danailov claims suppressed the information. The Topalov team claims they were pressured by officials to keep their allegations quiet. On 29 July 2007, following a complaint by Kramnik&#x27;s manager Carsten Hensel, the FIDE Ethics Commission sanctioned Topalov with &quot;a severe reprimand&quot; because of the accusations made in the interview of 14 December. According to the Ethics Commission, &quot;these statements were clearly defamatory and damaged the honour of Mr. Vladimir Kramnik, harming his personal and professional reputation&quot;.

=== 2006–2010 ===
Soon after losing the match, Topalov finished third of four players in Essent with only 2½/6, losing both games against Judit Polgár and one against Shakhriyar Mamedyarov.

In May 2006, Topalov defended his M-Tel Masters title, coming first with 6½/10, a half point ahead of Gata Kamsky.

In January 2007, Topalov finished in joint first place at Corus along with Levon Aronian and Teimour Radjabov.

In May 2007, Topalov won the M-Tel Masters tournament for a third consecutive time with 5½/10, defeating then- leader Sasikiran in the final round.

In November 2007, Topalov won the Vitoria Gasteiz charity event.

Topalov won the 14th Ciudad Dos Hermanas Rapid, 17–21 April 2008, defeating GM Francisco Vallejo Pons of Spain 2½–1½ in the final match by winning the first game and drawing the remaining three.

In September 2008, Topalov won the Bilbao 2008 tournament. Following this victory, he became the world number one on the official October 2008 ratings list. He also won the Pearl Spring event held in Nanjing as well as Villarobledo Chess Festival.

Topalov lost his chance to compete in the 2007 world championship tournament when he lost the 2006 reunification match. Danailov expressed a desire for a rematch between Topalov and Kramnik, proposing a match in March 2007, though no such match took place. The issue was settled in June 2007, when Topalov and Kramnik were granted special privileges in the 2008–09 championship cycle. Topalov was given direct entry to a &quot;Challenger Match&quot; against the winner of the Chess World Cup 2007.

The 2007 Chess World Cup was won by Gata Kamsky. The Challenger Match between Topalov and Kamsky took place in February 2009 in Sofia. Topalov won the match 4½–2½.

Topalov won the 2010 Linares chess tournament held in February, defeating Boris Gelfand in the last round.

=== 2010 World Championship ===
Before the 2010 World Chess Championship match with Veselin Topalov, Viswanathan Anand, who had booked on the flight Frankfurt–Sofia on 16 April, was stranded due to the cancellation of all flights following the volcano ash cloud from Eyjafjallajökull. Anand asked for a three-day postponement, which the Bulgarian organisers refused on 19 April. Anand eventually reached Sofia on 20 April, after a 40-hour road journey. Consequently, the first game was delayed by one day.

The match consisted of 12 games. In Game 1, Topalov quickly defeated Anand in 30 moves, utilizing a very sharp line of attack that broke through Anand&#x27;s Grunfeld Defence. It was revealed afterwards that Topalov had found the line during his opening preparation, with the help of a powerful supercomputer loaned to him by Bulgaria&#x27;s Defense Department. Anand quickly responded with a win in Game 2, employing a novelty out of the Catalan Opening that was not easily recognized by computers at the time (15. Qa3!?, followed by 16. bxa3!). Anand would win again with the Catalan in Game 4, only to drop Game 8 and leave the score level once again. After 11 games the score was tied at 5½–5½. Anand won game 12 on the Black side of a Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined to win the game and the match. Topalov chose to accept a pawn sacrifice by Anand, hoping to force a result and avoid a rapid chess tiebreak round. But after Topalov&#x27;s dubious 31st and 32nd moves, Anand used the sacrifice to obtain a strong attack against Topalov&#x27;s relatively exposed king. Topalov subsequently resigned, allowing Anand to retain the World Championship.

As runner-up in the World Chess Championship 2010, Topalov automatically qualified for the Candidates Matches for the World Chess Championship 2012, where he was the top seed. However, he lost to newly crowned U.S. champion Gata Kamsky in the quarterfinals. Later that year he won the King&#x27;s Tournament in Romania.

<doc id="348815" wikidata="Q286644" url="?curid=348815" title="Émile de Girardin">
<text>Émile de Girardin (; 22 June 180227 April 1881) was a French journalist, publisher and politician. He was the most successful and flamboyant French journalist of the era, presenting himself as a promoter of mass education through mass journalism. His magazines reached over a hundred thousand subscribers, and his inexpensive daily newspaper &quot;La Presse&quot; undersold the competition by half, thanks to its cheaper production and heavier advertising. Like most prominent journalists, Girardin was deeply involved in politics, and served in parliament. To his bitter disappointment, he never held high office. He was a brilliant polemicist, a master of controversy, with pungent short sentences that immediately caught the reader&#x27;s attention.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===

Girardin was born in Paris, the bastard son of General Alexandre de Girardin and of his mistress Madame Dupuy (&quot;née&quot; Fagnan), wife of a Parisian advocate.

His first publication was a novel, &quot;Émile&quot;, dealing with his birth and early life, and appeared under the name of Girardin in 1827. He became inspector of fine arts under the Martignac ministry just before the revolution of 1830, and was an energetic and passionate journalist. Besides his work on the daily press he issued miscellaneous publications which attained an enormous circulation. His &quot;Journal des connaissances utiles&quot; had 120,000 subscribers, and the initial edition of his &quot;Almanach de France&quot; (1834) ran to a million copies. He founded the illustrated literary magazine &quot;Musée des familles&quot; in 1833.

In 1836 he inaugurated penny press journalism in a popular conservative organ, &quot;La Presse&quot;, the subscription to which was only forty francs a year. It was the first newspaper anywhere to rely on paid advertising to lower its price, extend its readership and increase its profitability and the formula was soon copied by all titles. This undertaking involved him in a duel with Armand Carrel, the fatal result of which made him refuse satisfaction to later opponents. In 1839 he was excluded from the Chamber of Deputies, to which he had been elected four times, on the plea of his foreign birth, but was admitted in 1842. He resigned early in February 1847, and on 24 February 1848 sent a note to Louis Philippe demanding his resignation and the regency of the duchess of Orléans.

===Political career===

In the Legislative Assembly he voted with the Mountain. In 1850, Girardin wrote an article called &quot;Le Socialisme et l&#x27;Impot&quot;. In his article, Girardin suggested that there was a &quot;good&quot; socialism and a &quot;bad&quot; socialism. This article was reviewed by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels in a jointly written article carried in their newspaper &quot;Neue Rheinisch Zeitung Politisch-Ökonomische Revue No. 4&quot;. Giradin defined &quot;good socialism&quot; as promoting harmony between capital and labor, while &quot;bad socialism&quot; promoted war between capital and labor. Marx and Engels criticized Girardin&#x27;s theory of good socialism as not being socialism at all. Girardin&#x27;s &quot;good socialism&quot; actually ignored workers in society and concluded that society was composed exclusively of capitalists.

Later, Girardin pressed eagerly in his paper for the election of Prince Louis Napoleon, of whom he afterwards became one of the most violent opponents. In 1856 he sold &quot;La Presse&quot;, only to resume it in 1862, but its vogue was over, and Girardin started a new journal, &quot;La Liberté&quot;, the sale of which was forbidden in the public streets. He supported Émile Ollivier and the Liberal Empire, but plunged into vehement journalism again to advocate war against Prussia.

===Final years===
Of his many subsequent enterprises the most successful was the purchase of &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot;, which served to advocate the policy of Adolphe Thiers, though he himself did not contribute. The crisis of 16 May 1877, when Jules Simon fell from power, made him resume his pen to attack MacMahon and the party of reaction in &quot;La France&quot; and in &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot;. Émile de Girardin married in 1831 Delphine Gay, and after her death in 1855 Guillemette Josephine Brunold, countess von Tieffenbach, morganatic granddaughter of Prince Frederick of Nassau. He was divorced from his second wife in 1872. He died in Paris.

<text>Rotax is the brand name for a range of internal combustion engines developed and manufactured by the Austrian company BRP-Rotax GmbH &amp; Co KG (until 2016 BRP-Powertrain GmbH &amp; Co. KG), in turn owned by the Canadian Bombardier Recreational Products (BRP). Under the Rotax brand, the company is one of the world&#x27;s largest producers of light piston engines.

Rotax four-stroke and advanced two-stroke engines are used in a wide variety of small land, sea and airborne vehicles. Bombardier Recreational Products use them in their own range of such vehicles. Since the 1990s, Rotax has been the world&#x27;s dominant supplier of engines for ultralight aircraft and light sport aircraft, and a major producer of engines for other light aircraft.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1920 in Dresden, Saxony, Germany, as ROTAX-WERK AG, the name referring to the „rotanda axis“ used in the 1906 bicycle freewheel patent by Friedrich Theodor Gottschalk (1858-1932). In 1930, Rotax was taken over by Fichtel &amp; Sachs and transferred its operations, soon reduced to sales, to Schweinfurt, northern Bavaria, Germany. When this area came within reach of allied bombing in 1943, the engine production of Fichtel &amp; Sachs, was moved further south-east within the Greater German Reich, to Wels, Reichsgau Oberdonau, into the facilities of Reform-Werke Bauer &amp; Co that had produced agricultural machines. To conceal this move, the Rotax named was used. 

After the war, under US control, Reform-Werke Bauer resumed agricultural production in the Wels city center near the central station. Rotax was moved to nearby Gunskirchen in 1947, and ownership was transferred by the 1955 Austrian State Treaty to Austria. In 1959, the majority of Rotax shares were taken over by the Vienna-based Lohner-Werke, a manufacturer of car and railway wagon bodies.

In 1970, Lohner-Rotax was bought by the Canadian Bombardier Inc. The former Bombardier branch, Bombardier Recreational Products, now an independent company, uses Rotax engines in its ground vehicles, personal water craft, and snowmobiles.

== Applications ==

=== Snowmobiles ===
The original application for Rotax engines was Ski-Doo snowmobiles from Bombardier Recreational Products including two-stroke and four-stroke, turbocharged and naturally aspirated, two- and three-cylinder models.

=== Aircraft ===
Rotax is one of the world&#x27;s principal suppliers of aircraft engines for ultralight aircraft, light aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles. Between 1985 and 1995, 60,000 Rotax engines were sold for aircraft propulsion. In the light aircraft class, in 1998 Rotax outsold all other aero engine manufacturers combined. Their four-stroke engines powered most U.S.-certified light sport aircraft when they first appeared around 2004. Over two decades later, Rotax engines remain the most popular line of engines for light sport and ultralight aircraft, and the second-most-popular (after Lycoming Engines) for U.S. Experimental / Amateur-Built (E/A-B) aircraft.

==== Two-stroke aircraft engines ====

Rotax air-cooled, two-stroke engines began appearing on ultralight aircraft in the early 1980s, with a pair of single-cylinder, Rotax 185s powering the single-seat Lazair ultralight by 1982. Soon, the , single-cylinder Rotax 277 became the most widely used engine powering U.S. ultralight aircraft (and remains, for many, the only Rotax engine they can use to adequately power the aircraft and still remain within the FAA-mandated weight limits for ultralight aircraft which can be operated without a pilot&#x27;s license).

Two-stroke Rotax model numbers approximated the engine&#x27;s displacement (in cubic centimeters), and the first two digits (from the 277, on) are very roughly similar to the engine&#x27;s horsepower (e.g.: The Rotax 447 engine displaces 437 cc, and is rated at ).

Subsequent evolutions of the early designs included the two-cylinder, two-stroke Rotax 377, Rotax 447, and Rotax 503, all in production by 1985 (the last of these, the 503, was discontinued in 2010-2011, by then the most popular engine it its class, and still widely used as of 2023). Later two-stroke designs included the Rotax 532 (circa 1984) and Rotax 582, both of which augmented the air-cooling with liquid-cooled cylinder heads.

Most Rotax two-stroke engines were rated, recommended, or reported with a TBO (time between overhauls) of about 150-300 hours (compared to 1200-2000 hours for government-certified, conventional, four-stroke, light aircraft engines), though later models improved upon that some.

==== Four-stroke aircraft engines ====

Moving towards more demanding aircraft applications, Rotax, by 1989, developed a four-stroke, four-cylinder, engine: the Rotax 912, with versions eventually ranging from , followed by a turbocharged 115 horsepower Rotax 914.

Rotax four-stroke engines differ from conventional four-stroke aircraft engines by their unusually small displacement for the amount of power -- compensated for by higher than normal rotational speed (over 5,000 rpm). To reduce propeller-shaft speeds to normal aircraft propeller rotational speeds, (around 2300-2400 rpm) the engines use a reduction gearbox. They are also designed to accept motor spirit, with up to 10% ethanol content.

These engines were initially given a 600-hour Time Before Overhaul (TBO), less than traditional light aircraft engines. But operational experience and modifications to address specific reliability issues over time gradually extended the TBO to 2,000 hours. An independent 2022 statistical study of U.S. government accident data found that the Rotax 912 family had the lowest rate of failure of the six most common lines of engines used in registered Experimental/Amateur-Built (E/A-B) aircraft.

By 2014, Rotax had produced and sold 50,000 of 912/914 four-stroke engines. Later models increased power, with several variants of the 912 family, and a new Rotax 915 iS.

The Rotax four-stroke aircraft engine line immediately dominated the emerging category of U.S.-certified &quot;Light Sport Aircraft&quot; (LSAs), powering most of them. One general aviation industry media reporter found that 70-80% of the 66,000 aircraft he&#x27;d identified, worldwide, used Rotax four-stroke engines. The 912/914/915 series also powers larger certified aircraft, including the Diamond Katana, and the twin-engined Tecnam P2006T and Leza/Lockwood Aircam.

=== Motorcycles ===
The Can-Am division of Bombardier Inc. developed a line of motorcycles starting in 1971, powered by Rotax engines. The Can-Am motorcycle operation was outsourced to Armstrong-CCM Motorcycles in 1983, with production ending in 1987.

Can-Am resumed motorcycle production with a series of on-road three-wheel motorcycles, starting with the Spyder, using Rotax engines. As of 2020, there are three models: the Ryker uses the 2-cylinder 600 ACE and 3-cylinder 900 ACE, the Spyder F3 and the Spyder RT use the 3-cylinder 1330 ACE. 1000 V-twin 5sp.

In the motorcycle world Rotax are particularly known for their single-cylinder engines of comparatively small to medium displacement. Several major motorbike manufacturers, who are otherwise renowned for their proprietary but bigger engines, use Rotax engines in their smaller models.

As an example of larger displacements, Rotax developed a 798 cc parallel twin engine with and for BMW, which was built from 2006 to 2020. 

Brands using Rotax engines include:
* Aprilia Pegaso, Aprilia RSV Mille, Aprilia RSV 1000 R, Aprilia Tuono the Falco and Futura.
* ATK 250, 350, 406, 560, 604, 605
* BMW F650, BMW F800S, BMW F800ST, BMW F800GT, BMW F800R, BMW F800GS
* Buell 1125, 604, 636 ccm

=== Personal watercraft ===
As of 2020, all Sea-Doo brand personal watercraft from Bombardier Recreational Products are equipped with four-stroke, supercharged and normally aspirated, three-cylinder Rotax engines of the Advanced Combustion Efficiency (ACE) series.

=== Off-road vehicles ===
Can-Am Off-Road vehicles from Bombardier Recreational Products are equipped with Rotax engines.

===Karting ===
The company introduced the Rotax Max for karting in 1998, and started organizing the Rotax Max Challenge in 2000.

<doc id="348820" wikidata="Q437094" url="?curid=348820" title="Delphine de Girardin">
<text>Delphine de Girardin (24 January 1804 – 29 June 1855), pen name &quot;Vicomte Delaunay&quot;, was a French writer.

==Life==
de Girardin was born in Aachen, and christened Delphine Gay. Her mother, the well-known Madame Sophie Gay, brought her up in the midst of a brilliant literary society. Her cousin was the writer Hortense Allart. Gay published two volumes of miscellanea, &quot;Essais poetiques&quot; (1824) and &quot;Nouveaux Essais poétiques&quot; (1825). A visit to Italy in 1827, during which she was enthusiastically welcomed by the literati of Rome and even crowned in the capitol, produced various poems, of which the most ambitious was &quot;Napoline&quot; (1833).

Gay&#x27;s marriage in 1831 to Émile de Girardin opened up a new literary career. The contemporary sketches that she contributed from 1836 to 1839 to the &quot;La Presse&quot;, under the pen name of Charles de Launay, were collected under the title &quot;Lettres parisiennes&quot; (1843), and obtained a brilliant success. &quot;Contes d&#x27;une vieille fille a ses neveux&quot; (1832), &quot;La Canne de Monsieur de Balzac&quot; (1836) and &quot;Il ne faut pas jouer avec la douleur&quot; (1853) are among the best-known of her romances; and her dramatic pieces in prose and verse include &quot;L&#x27;École des journalistes&quot; (1840), &quot;Judith&quot; (1843), &quot;Cléopâtre&quot; (1847), &quot;Lady Tartuffe&quot; (1853), and the one-act comedies, &quot;C&#x27;est la faute du mari&quot; (1851), &quot;La Joie fait peur&quot; (1854), &quot;Le Chapeau d&#x27;un horloger&quot; (1854) and &quot;Une Femme qui deteste son mari&quot;, which did not appear till after the author&#x27;s death, which occurred in Paris.

Madame Girardin exercised considerable personal influence in contemporary literary society, and in her drawing-room were often to be found Théophile Gautier, Honoré de Balzac, Alfred de Musset and Victor Hugo. She frequently held spiritualist seances, known also to be attended by Victor Hugo and members of his family. Her collected works were published in six volumes (1860-1861).

<doc id="348824" wikidata="Q7956415" url="?curid=348824" title="WTSN (TV channel)">
<text>WTSN was a Canadian English language category 1 television channel owned by CTV Specialty Television Inc. (CTV Specialty), a joint venture between Bell Globemedia (80%) and ESPN (20%). The channel broadcast sports programming featuring female athletes.

Marketed as &quot;the world&#x27;s first 24-hour sports network dedicated to celebrating the achievements of women in sports,&quot; the channel was a spin-off of its sister channel, TSN, Canada&#x27;s first and at the time, largest national sports channel.

==Programming==
Programming on the network included a variety of programs ranging from live and tape-delayed sports events, documentaries, talk shows, news, and more.

Sports events coverage on the network included LPGA golf, WNBA basketball, women&#x27;s tennis, WUSA soccer, women&#x27;s curling, CWHL and WWHL ice hockey and coverage of various women&#x27;s teams in Canadian Interuniversity Sport, among others.

The network also aired special coverage of Hayley Wickenheiser&#x27;s debut in the Finnish men&#x27;s hockey league.

==History==
In November 2000, NetStar Communications Inc. (later renamed CTV Specialty Television Inc.) was granted approval for a television broadcasting licence by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for a national English-language Category 1 specialty television service called &quot;Women&#x27;s Sports Network&quot;, described as a service to be &quot;dedicated entirely to sports that feature female athletes and participants, including coverage of professional and amateur sporting events, magazine shows, documentaries and instructional programs.&quot;

Prior to the channel&#x27;s launch, NetStar announced that prominent sports broadcaster Sue Prestedge was named the senior vice-president of the channel.

The channel launched on September 7, 2001, as WTSN.

On August 29, 2003, CTV Specialty announced that they would be ceasing the network&#x27;s operations on September 30, 2003, due to lack of expected growth, limited ad revenue, and the high cost of running a sports service.

TSN did not immediately surrender the channel&#x27;s licence, and filed an intervention in January 2005 with the CRTC against a proposed licence amendment for Fox Sports World Canada that may have impacted on WTSN&#x27;s mandate. Media analysts speculated that it may be possible that the channel might have relaunched at a later date if economic conditions were found to be more favourable. The licence was eventually revoked at the company&#x27;s request on December 19, 2006.

<text>Simon James Honey (born 23 May 1956), better known as Ben Dover, is an English pornographic actor, director and producer. He has also worked under several other pseudonyms including Steve Perry as producer and Lindsay Honey as an actor and musician. 

Honey was included in Larry Flynt&#x27;s &quot;Hustler&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top 50 Most Hated People in Porn&quot; list, printed in the January 1999 issue and in 2011, he was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame.

Honey has also won a host of awards for the Ben Dover series including the Breakthrough Award at the AVN Awards in 1997, AVN&#x27;s &quot;Best Gonzo&quot; Award twice (in 2000 for &quot;Ben Dover&#x27;s End Games&quot; and in 2002 for &quot;Ben Dover&#x27;s The Booty Bandit&quot;). In 2006, he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the UK Adult Film Awards, which he co-presented with Kristyn Halborg, Kelly Stafford and co-star Pascal White.

In 2012, Honey was nominated by the Internet Service Providers Association as an Internet Villain for his involvement with his company Golden Eye (International) in speculative invoicing.

==Biography==

===Early days in the music industry===

Born in Sittingbourne, Kent to Sylvia (née Foster) (1926–2017) and Frank Cyril Honey (1921–1993), Honey attended Borden Grammar School. Following expulsion from school in 1973, he moved to Newquay, Cornwall where he worked as a children&#x27;s entertainer called &quot;Uncle Simon&quot; and drummed in a cabaret band for the summer season.

Using the pseudonym Lindsay Honey as he &quot;didn&#x27;t think Simon fitted the bill somehow&quot;, he began working as a session drummer for artists such as Edison Lighthouse and White Plains. Honey joined Artful Dodgers who released one single &quot;Here We Go&quot; in 1978 before changing their name to 20th Century Heroes.

Following a chance meeting between the band&#x27;s guitarist Paul Jackson and one time Bay City Rollers bassist Ian Mitchell (who replaced original member Alan Longmuir in 1976, before quitting after seven months) in a taxi, the band (Jackson, Honey and bassist John Jay) agreed to be his backing band and the Ian Mitchell Band was launched in May 1979. Although the band were not successful in the UK, they released three studio albums within a single year and toured across Europe and Japan. Following the departure of Jackson, the band changed their name to La Rox and reinvented themselves as a glam rock band, with Honey becoming the band&#x27;s keyboard player. The change made little impact on the band&#x27;s fortunes in the UK, and they split up in 1982. Honey, along with the band&#x27;s second drummer John Towe and guitarist Lea Hart (who had replaced Paul Jackson) scored a minor UK hit, under the name Small Ads, with the one-off single &quot;Small Ads&quot;, released in April 1981.

Honey also worked as a cabaret singer under the pseudonym &quot;Steve Jackson&quot; and briefly reunited with Mitchell to form &quot;Bachelor Of Hearts&quot; who released one album in 1983 to little fanfare (a version of the track &quot;Girls in Jeans&quot; was later used as the outro music on Ben Dover films).

===Early adult film work===
In 1978, broke from his dwindling career as a musician and working as a male stripper using the stage name &quot;Hot Rod&quot; (due to his reported likeness to Rod Stewart at the time), Honey responded to an advertisement for models in &quot;The Stage&quot; newspaper and met agent Kent William Boulton (1941–2002), a college lecturer from Bromley and former Labour Party candidate on the Isle of Wight who entered the porn business late in life and was renowned for organising &quot;spanking parties&quot;.

Being paid £150 a shoot, Honey started working for Berth Milton Sr, publisher of Private Magazine and other European hardcore porn magazines such as Rodox/Color Climax, a Danish company. His first shoot was with a then 17-year-old Eileen Daly, who had gone to see the same agent above a strip club in Soho with her mother. Honey was introduced by Boulton to the photographer Lexington Steel and director Mike Freeman.

====Working for Videx Ltd.====
Honey began working as an actor for Mike Freeman&#x27;s Videx Ltd. in 1980, a video production company based in Wimbledon. Freeman had produced softcore porn throughout the 1960s via his company Climax Films, and employed well known Soho gangster Gerald Patrick Joseph Hawley as a bodyguard. He was jailed in December 1969 for the murder of Hawley, reportedly after he tried to take over Freeman&#x27;s business.

Upon release from prison in 1979, Freeman set about exploiting the Obscene Publications Act, which didn&#x27;t yet cover the new video format, and started producing hardcore pornography. While working at Videx, Honey starred in his first film as an actor in &quot;Truth or Dare&quot; with actress Paula Meadows. However, the law was soon changed to bring video under the Obscene Publications Act and Freeman&#x27;s home was raided in 1981 by the OPS (Obscene Publications Squad), with all the Videx video equipment confiscated in the process. The Videx offices were raided again in 1983 and Freeman was arrested in relation to the film &quot;The Videx Video Show&quot; under Obscene Publications Act and Perverting the course of justice.

Freeman was sentenced to 15 months in the case relating to the first raid in 1981 involving the video &quot;Sex Slave&quot;. Honey took over Videx and produced and directed his first film, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Ransom&quot;, for the company which featured his bandmate Ian Mitchell. After serving ten months Freeman was released from prison and set about preparing for the case of the second raid in relation to the video &quot;The Videx Video Show&quot;. Freeman was charged under The Obscene Publications Act and Protection of Children Act, as images of children taken at a naturist park were featured (although in a separate scene to any pornographic content). Having called film critic Derek Malcolm as a witness who classed the film as &quot;harmless erotica&quot; and successfully demonstrating that the film was not obscene, Freeman, Honey, Freeman&#x27;s girlfriend and company secretary Sara Bhaskaran, and silent business partner John Edward Currey were found not guilty under the Obscene Publications Act. However, Freeman was found guilty of perverting the course of justice, despite having already been acquitted of the offence relating to the video, and sentenced to a further 15 months. He was then recalled by the Parole Board for his previous life sentence for murder.

====Going it alone and imprisonment====
Honey worked as a photographer, under the pseudonym &quot;Brian Wilson&quot; (after The Beach Boys singer), for &quot;Escort&quot; magazine throughout the 1980s, shooting his partner Linzi Drew who regularly appeared in the magazine. The couple also took the Videx equipment (which Freeman had purchased to replace the original confiscated equipment) and mailing list to set up their own mail order business. Operating from their home, Corner Cottage in Stoke d&#x27;Abernon, Surrey, they sold hardcore pornographic films under various names such as Stephanie Perry and Glamour Pussy Video Club via adverts in magazines. The couple also used other addresses across Surrey, including that of a pet shop, where order forms would be collected.

The couple were arrested in February 1990 following a police raid on their home and convicted in 1992 at Guildford Crown Court under the Obscene Publications Act for &quot;publishing obscene material for gain&quot; and &quot;being in possession of obscene material&quot; following a sting operation in which an undercover police officer joined the companies&#x27; mailing list and over a period of more than a year bought several videos, which also proved that the operation was &quot;an on-going tax-free profitable business&quot;.

Drew was sentenced to four months, which she served at Holloway Prison and Drake Hall, Staffordshire, before being released after serving two months, while Honey was sentenced to nine months, which he served at Brixton Prison before being transferred after five weeks to Send Open Prison, Surrey. Documents seized by the police indicated that they had 400 people on their mailing list who paid £60 per video.

In December 1993 Honey filed for bankruptcy. Following release from prison Honey and Bill Wright (a.k.a. Frank Thring) were commissioned to work on the first feature-length videos for Berth Milton, Sr.&#x27;s Private Media Group, which had only produced magazines before. Honey directed its first seven films with Wright and took on the new pseudonym Steve Perry (after the Journey frontman).

===Ben Dover series===
Honey started production of a new gonzo-style series in summer 1994 using the stage name Ben Dover (a name which was influenced by a title from John Stagliano&#x27;s &quot;Buttman&quot; pornography video series &quot;Bendover Babes&quot;). He directed, produced and starred (as both cameraman/narrator and occasionally as performer) in the series between 1995 and 2002 along with actors including Marino Franchi and Pascal White. In 1995, Drew became pregnant with their son Tyger Drew-Honey and left the pornography industry.

Upon release in the United States, the Ben Dover films were edited by VCA Pictures to censor the more graphic contents of the original productions. In 2002 Honey was dropped by VCA, which had been taken over by Hustler, and opted to concentrate on the market in the UK instead. It wasn&#x27;t until 2004 that he again attempted to obtain US distribution for his films and signed a deal with Kick Ass Pictures and resurrected the Ben Dover brand. He began producing the &quot;Ben Dover&#x27;s Kick Ass Anal Adventures&quot; series, of which there were five instalments.

In 2008 Honey attended the UK Adult Film Awards once more, representing Television X and Red Hot TV along with Linsey Dawn Mckenzie and other British adult film stars. Television X has shown some of his most recent projects such as &quot;St/ Teenycums&quot;, which won Best Script at the UK Adult Film Awards 2008.

Following the demise of physical DVD sales, Honey diversified the Ben Dover brand by launching branded clothing, sex toys (including &quot;The Ben Dover Signature line&quot;, which produces, among other products, &quot;The Ben Dover Realistic Penis&quot; and &quot;The Ben Dover Anal Kit&quot;), male enhancers, mugs and stickers as well as Ben Dover approved stag and hen parties. Honey also hosts &quot;Ben Dover Porn Disco&quot;s involving wet t-shirt competitions and &quot;SwingalongaBen&quot; swinging parties in Aston, Birmingham.

Also in 2012, Honey started production on a new online Ben Dover series &quot;Like Father Like Son,&quot; an incest-based series where he and his on-screen son have sex with the same girl together. He confirmed the series did not feature his own son.

===Outside the porn industry===

In addition to his pornographic work, in 2000 Honey featured in the feature film &quot;Last Resort&quot; (2000), in which he played a low-budget porn producer.

In 2001, despite admitting to having failed to vote in the previous election, Honey revealed that he was considering standing as an independent candidate in the next general election as an &quot;Independent Libertarian&quot;. He would advocate the dismantling of the Royal Family, branding them an &quot;outdated, irrelevant and frankly dangerous institution&quot;, removing any power from the church and reforming the National Health Service and would &quot;make patients at A&amp;E departments who are there as a result of pub fights etc, be made to pay a serious levy for the expense of treating them&quot;. In 2009 Honey resurrected his plans to enter politics, with his own party &quot;New Democrats&quot;.

In September 2009, Honey was featured on the BBC Four programme &quot;Rich Man Poor Man: Ben Dover Straightens Up&quot;, where he attempted to search for personal fulfilment in his life and be taken seriously by making a break in mainstream acting. He performed his one-man show &quot;Innocent &#x27;Til Proven Filthy&quot; at the 2009 Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

Honey appeared as Arthur in the comedy film &quot;On the Ropes&quot;.

In 2012 Honey joined the Guns N&#x27; Roses tribute band &quot;Guns 2 Roses&quot; as a special guest drummer, and continues to tour with them on select dates. He also released the mockumentary &quot;The Only Way is Dover&quot; on YouTube, claiming &quot;It&#x27;s a bit like &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. It&#x27;s not about porn, it&#x27;s about what we do when we&#x27;re not doing porn.&quot;

In 2016 Honey was cast by film producer Mark Noyce as Rubber John in the comedy film &quot;The Blazing Cannons&quot;.

In February 2017, Honey revealed that he was battling bladder cancer and is currently undergoing chemotherapy.

===Golden Eye – speculative invoicing===
In 2008, Honey set up the shell company Golden Eye (International) Ltd with Julian Fraser Becker (commercial director of Optime Strategies Ltd, who trade as Ben Dover Productions) which claims to be the &quot;holder of numerous film copyrights&quot;, primarily those of Ben Dover Productions films. The company was named after the house Honey shared with his partner Linzi Drew and son, Tyger Drew-Honey in Hersham, Surrey into which they moved in 2005 and left in 2011, after the couple split up and the house put up for sale and sold in November 2011.

In May 2009, Ben Dover Productions announced that it was retaining the services of the Anti Piracy Group to tackle the problem of DVD piracy. The company claimed their sales and profits had plummeted due to organised crime gangs flooding the streets with pirated DVDs of their titles.

The company then engaged in a campaign of &quot;speculative invoicing&quot;, where they sent out letters, initially through lawyers, to alleged copyright infringers demanding a payment of £700 or face the threat of potential court action: a scheme described by the House of Lords as &quot;straightforward legal blackmail&quot; and a scam. The company paid for a list of alleged BitTorrent file-sharers identities, and retained the services of Tilly Bailey &amp; Irvine to pursue the alleged copyright infringers for compensation, using what they claimed to be &quot;bespoke technology which captures the irrefutable evidence of the perpetrators&quot;. It was revealed that this technology, investigated and checked by physicist and &quot;checked computer expert&quot; Clement Vogler of computer consultants Ad Litem Limited, a company which was dissolved in 2011, was targeting innocent individuals, and that the speculative invoicing relied on the embarrassment of those targeted agreeing to the fine to avoid the threatened court action, regardless of whether they were guilty or not. The data gatherer Alireza Torabi of NG3 Systems also gathered IP data for ACS:Law. Following adverse public and press reaction, Tilly Bailey &amp; Irvine abandoned the practice and accepted a £2,800 fine from the Solicitors Regulation Authority. Without the aid of solicitors, Golden Eye (International) Limited continued the practice of speculatively invoicing those they claim had &quot;infringed their copyrights&quot;.

In 2011, the company lost a court case against an internet user who they claimed had illegally downloaded the Ben Dover film &quot;Fancy An Indian?&quot;, and were themselves accused of breaching the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 and Civil Procedure Rules when issuing the claim. Timothy Dutton QC of the Solicitors Regulation Authority noted that as computer IP addresses can be shared, faked and hijacked, the evidence being used was of the &quot;flimsiest&quot; variety. Golden Eye attempted to get the case tried in a county court, but when it was confirmed it would need to be tried at the London Patents County Court the company tried to pull out of the case. Judge Birss QC highlighted similarities between this and a previous case involving Media CAT Limited and lawyers who unsuccessfully tried to sue 27 individuals for alleged copyright infringement, as Media CAT Limited were not the rights holders of the copyrighted material in question and led to ACS:Law ceasing to trade.

In order for the case to progress in the Patents County Court, the actual copyright holder, Optime Strategies Limited (who trade as Ben Dover Productions), would have to have joined Golden Eye (Julian Becker is a director of both companies) and &quot;potentially put themselves at risk of becoming liable for a wasted costs claim if the case were to fail like ACS:Law&#x27;s did&quot;. To avoid this, in January 2012, the company instead started pursuing individuals through the HM Courts &amp; Tribunals Money Claim Online service for claims which should only be made through the Patents County Court.

On 9 March 2012, Golden Eye went to court in an attempt to obtain a Norwich Pharmacal Order (NPO) for the details of over 9,000 IP addresses from internet service provider O2 (UK)/Telefónica Europe (an internet provider who previously had not contested NPOs) to service further &quot;speculative invoicing&quot; letters to alleged copyright infringers. Golden Eye were questioned by statutory consumer organisation Consumer Focus regarding the company&#x27;s ability (or lack of) to connect an IP address with the account holder, the company&#x27;s role in relation to the copyrights involved and the amount being demanded, which they stated was &quot;far and above the likely actual damages&quot;.

On 26 March 2012, the High Court ordered O2 to hand over the details of 9,124 of its customers’ details to Golden Eye. However, the judge deemed the proposed £700 fine to be &quot;unsupported and unsupportable&quot; and that the bill payer couldn&#x27;t automatically be assumed to be guilty of any alleged copyright violation, and therefore any claim made by Golden Eye/Ben Dover Productions/Optime Strategies Ltd couldn&#x27;t move forward unless the recipient of the company&#x27;s speculative invoicing letters admitted their own guilt due to the evidence used being unreliable. The wording of any such letters would also be severely restricted, and the &quot;precise wording of the order and of the letter of claim&quot; would be decided at a further hearing. Consumer Focus welcomed the ruling that bill payers couldn&#x27;t automatically be assumed to be guilty of any alleged copyright violation on their internet connection, commenting that &quot;Consumers should not be subject to the type of threatening letters Golden Eye intended to send to more than 9,000 O2 customers&quot;. Golden Eye&#x27;s lawyer admitted that taking a test case to court would not be cost effective, and therefore the company didn&#x27;t intend on taking any cases to court and that they relied on those accused paying their &quot;fine&quot;.

In July 2012, the High Court ruled that Golden Eye would only be granted access to data in relation to Ben Dover Production films, not the titles by twelve other production companies that Golden Eye were acting on behalf of (including Terry Stephen&#x27;s One Eyed Jack Productions and Justin Ribeiro Dos Santos&#x27;s Joybear Pictures) and would take 75% of any &quot;damages&quot; paid, which Mr Justice Arnold stated &quot;would be tantamount to the court sanctioning the sale of the intended defendants’ privacy and data protection rights to the highest bidder&quot;. This meant that Golden Eye would only be able to target 2,845 of its original target of over 9,000 households. It was revealed in December 2012 that the IP data supplied to O2 (UK)/Telefónica Europe by Golden Eye, from 2,850 alleged copyright infringements of Ben Dover Production films could only be matched to less than 1,000 individuals.

In an interview with &quot;Vice&quot;, Honey claimed his income had dropped 90% in two years and admitted his reasons for his involvement in speculative invoicing was that &quot;if I can&#x27;t make money out of porn, the only way I can make money is to get to the people who are not buying it&quot;.

===Personal life===
Honey used to be married to adult actress and model Linzi Drew. Their son is English actor, musician and television presenter Tyger Drew-Honey, best known for starring in the BBC sit-com &quot;Outnumbered&quot;. Honey also appeared in the first episode of his son&#x27;s TV series &quot;Tyger Takes On...&quot;, which examined the influence of pornography on Drew-Honey&#x27;s generation.

<text>Tanzwut () is a German Neue Deutsche Härte and Medieval metal band which originated as a side project of Corvus Corax members. The band uses a Medieval theme during their live performances which are expressed through their stagecraft, costumes and choreography.

Their name is the German term for &quot;dancing mania&quot;, but is directly translated with &quot;dance rage&quot;. Tanzwut are known for their heavy use of bagpipes, an unusual instrument for a metal band. The group has achieved international success, filling concert halls as far away from their home country as Mexico.

Since Ihr wolltet Spass the band have been gravitating towards a more industrial metal approach, incorporating the use of more down-tuned guitars, harsher vocals and darker atmospheres. On &quot;Weiße Nächte&quot; (&quot;White Nights&quot;) though, Tanzwut completely removed its industrial sound for a more refined classical approach centered around bagpipes with a heavy metal sound. However, some of the industrial influence returned with &quot;Höllenfahrt&quot; (&quot;Hell Ride&quot;) and the band have written material in a more traditional style similar to that of Corvus Corax (&quot;Morus et Diabolus&quot; and &quot;Eselsmesse&quot;).

<doc id="348833" wikidata="Q1858747" url="?curid=348833" title="Formica rufibarbis">
<text>Formica rufibarbis is a European formicine ant of the &quot;Formica fusca&quot; group. In the classification by Auguste Forel, it is treated in the subgenus &quot;Serviformica&quot;. &quot;F. rufibarbis&quot; is subject to a Species Action Plan (SAP) in England, where it is known from only two locations, although it is not considered to be at risk on continental Europe.

==Taxonomy==
The name &quot;Formica rufibarbis&quot; was first given to this ant by Lord Avebury in Britain in his 1881 work &quot;Ants, Bees and Wasps&quot; although the species had been earlier misidentified as &quot;F. cunicularia&quot; by Frederick Smith in 1851.

==Description==
The Red-barbed Ant is readily identified by its relatively large size and distinctive coloration of a blackish head and thorax, contrasting with a light reddish thorax. Small dark workers do occur and may be mistaken for &quot;F. fusca&quot;, although there is always a degree of colouration between thorax and abdomen. Workers can also be confused with &quot;F. cunicularia&quot; which does not have hairs on the thorax.

==Life cycle==
Colonies usually contain one to three queens, although the occurrence of gynaecoid or egg laying workers has also been recorded. Queens found colonies in the same manner as other ants from the &quot;Formica fusca&quot; group. Eggs are first laid early in the new year, and colonies reach a maximum size of around 500 workers.
Alates emerge in late June to early July.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is locally common throughout continental Europe, and ranges from Portugal to Western Siberia. it nests in short, lowland grass and heather or maritime heath overlying loose or sandy soils.

===Status in Britain===
In Britain, the species has always been scarce, confined to heaths in Surrey and the Isles of Scilly, where it is sometimes known as the &quot;St Martin&#x27;s Ant&quot;. In the 1927 edition of &quot;British Ants: their life histories and classification&quot;, Donisthorpe gives its distribution as being confined to Ripley, Chobham, Reigate and Weybridge. In 2004 there were only four nests in Surrey. It was once found in Cornwall at Whitsand Bay but has not been recorded since 1907. In the Isles of Scilly it is found on the islands of Great Ganilly, Nornour, St Martin&#x27;s and Teän.
As of 2015, &quot;F. rufibarbis&quot; is now confined to one known colony on mainland Britain, nesting on the edge of a Heath, the location is kept a closely guarded secret due to the risk posed by curious members of the public. However the nest is also at risk from &quot;F. sanguinea&quot;, a slavemaker ant, which currently nests only a few hundred meters away.

==Behaviour==
&quot;F. rufibarbis&quot; nests completely within the ground, usually in sandy banks, and nest chambers situated about a foot beneath the surface are accessible only from a single entrance. This makes the locating of colonies very difficult, so it is possible that the small numbers of recorded colonies constitute an under-representation. Workers forage singly and Donisthorpe observed: &quot;The workers are very audacious and will even endeavour to rob &quot;F. rufa&quot; of its prey – holding on and pulling – and the moment the &quot;rufa&quot; lets go, to get a better grip, or to attack the &quot;rufibarbis&quot;, the latter swiftly decamps with the prize.&quot; Workers also possess a remarkable sense of sight, and will proceed to their nest entrance in a dead straight line even if major obstacles are placed to disrupt their path. Donisthorpe describes this phenomenon thus: &quot;On July 12, 1913, having observed several &quot;rufibarbis&quot; workers running about on a path near a sandy bank at Weybridge, I endeavoured to find their nest, and commenced to pull up handfuls of herbage on the top of the bank, which I let fall on the slope. I then saw a worker approaching with a fly in its jaws and start to mount the bank, and as the scattered herbage was directly in its way, I feared the ant might be diverted from its nest, but when it reached the obstacle it never hesitated for a moment, but running straight over it in a direct line, entered its nest on the top of the bank, which I was thus enabled to find.&quot;

==Predation==
Like other &quot;Serviformica&quot;, this species is subject to raids by dulotic species such as &quot;Formica sanguinea&quot; and &quot;Polyergus rufescens&quot; where their ranges coalesce. In Britain this only takes place at Chobham in the case of the former (the latter does not occur in the country).

The Diocese of Truro was established in December 1876, and its first bishop, Edward White Benson, was consecrated on 25 April 1877 at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

Construction began in 1880 to a design by the leading Gothic Revival architect John Loughborough Pearson. Truro was the first Anglican cathedral to be built on a new site in England since Salisbury Cathedral in 1220. It was built on the site of the 16th-century parish church of St Mary the Virgin, a building in the Perpendicular style with a spire tall. The final services in St Mary&#x27;s were held on Sunday 3 October 1880 and the church was demolished that month, leaving only the south aisle, which was retained to serve as the parish church. From 24 October 1880 until 1887 a temporary wooden building on an adjacent site served as the cathedral. The seats were free and unappropriated, accommodated fewer than 400 people and was extremely hot in summer and cold in winter. It was in this building that Benson introduced the new evening service of Nine Lessons and Carols on Christmas Eve, 1880. 

The choir and transepts were complete by October 1887. The service of consecration took place on 3 November, performed by E. W. Benson, by then Archbishop of Canterbury. His successor as Bishop of Truro, George Wilkinson, and twenty other bishops were also present, together with civic representatives and diocesan clergy, and about 2,000 other people. The central tower was finished by 1905 and the building was completed with the opening of the two western towers in 1910. J. L. Pearson died in 1897 and his son Frank took over the project. Frank Loughborough Pearson&#x27;s other works include St Matthew&#x27;s, Auckland in New Zealand. 
Pearson&#x27;s design combines the Early English style with certain French characteristics, chiefly spires and rose windows. Its resemblance to Lincoln Cathedral is not coincidental; Pearson had been appointed as Lincoln Cathedral&#x27;s architect and the first Bishop of Truro, Edward Benson, had previously been Canon Chancellor at Lincoln. The central tower and spire stands tall, while the western towers reach to . Four kinds of stone were used: Mabe granite for the exterior, and St Stephen&#x27;s granite for the interior, with dressings and shafts of Bath and Polyphant stone. The spires and turret roofs are of stone, except for a copper spire over the bell tower at west end of St Mary&#x27;s Aisle. The other roofs are of slate. The cathedral is vaulted throughout. Nathaniel Hitch was responsible for the decorative sculpture, including the reredos.

The original south aisle of St Mary&#x27;s Church survives, incorporated into the south-east corner of the cathedral and known as St Mary&#x27;s Aisle. It still functions as the city centre&#x27;s parish church. Three brasses were described by Edwin Dunkin in 1882: those of Cuthbert Sydnam (1630), Thomas Hasell (1567) and George Fitzpen, rector of the parish. As the cathedral is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, it has no Lady Chapel. A Jesus Chapel and the Chapel of Unity and Peace are reserved for quiet and prayer throughout the day. There was no chapter house until 1967, when the opportunity to enlarge the building on the south-east arose. The architect of the new building was John Taylor.
Upon the foundation of Truro Cathedral, Bishop Benson was authorised to establish 24 honorary canonries. In 1878 a new act of Parliament authorised the bishop to establish residentiary canonries. In 1882 an existing canonry was transferred to Truro from Exeter whose income enabled the provision of two canonries at Truro. In 1906 the office of sub-dean was endowed, but the position of dean was still held by the bishop, at least until 1925. This remained the case until it became possible to fund the office of dean. The Victorian acts of Parliament which apply to the cathedral are the Bishopric of Truro Act 1876 (39 &amp; 40 Vict. c. 54), the (41 &amp; 42 Vict. c. 44), and the Truro Bishopric and Chapter Acts Amendment Act 1887 (50 &amp; 51 Vict. c. 12). Preaching duties in the cathedral are shared out among the bishop, residentiary canons and honorary canons.

The Royal Maundy Service was held in the cathedral in 1994 when Queen Elizabeth II presented 134 Cornish people with the traditional Maundy money.

==Restoration==

In 2002 the cathedral embarked on what was hoped to be a fifteen-year project to restore the east end, the west front and the central tower and spire. Each of the projects would be undertaken as funds allowed. The east end restoration repaired stonework and damage to the iron work on the stained glass windows. From 2004, a year-long project saw the restoration of the massive west front and towers. In 2009 and 2010 work on the central tower and spire began. 

Restoration work is being carried out by W. R. Bedford; Stuart Aston, managing director, said that the problem is the Bath Stone used on the more decorative areas of the cathedral, has not stood up well to the salts and sand in the maritime climate of Cornwall. Erosion of the stonework has left much of the exposed stonework in such a damaged condition that it resembles honeycomb. Funding for the restoration of the tower and spire has been partly met by grants from English Heritage, Friends of Truro Cathedral, the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Tanner Trust, the cathedral itself and by public subscription. The &quot;Save Our Spire&quot; campaign has raised nearly £50,000 towards the cost.

==Governance==

The cathedral is governed by a three-tier structure as set out in the Cathedral Measure and Statutes. The chapter (comprising the dean, three residentiary canons and three chapter canons), the cathedral council and the college of canons.

===Dean and chapter===
As of 3 October 2022:
*Dean — Simon Robinson (interim since October 2022, announced as permanent dean 17 August 2023) to be installed in Autumn 2023.
*Canon chancellor — Alan Bashforth (since 2014 installation)
*Canon precentor — Simon Griffiths (since 2016 installation)
*Canon missioner — vacant since 2014
*Diocesan canon — vacant since April 2020; Barley was canon pastor and priest-in-charge of Tresillian and Penkevil and rural dean of Powder

==Organs==

The Father Willis organ of 1887 is widely regarded as one of the finest instruments in the country. &quot;It is not easy, even today, to think how the magnificence of the Willis organ in Truro Cathedral could be improved&quot; wrote W. L. Sumner in his 1952 book &quot;The Organ&quot;. It was built in 1887 in London and arrived in Cornwall by boat. It has an almost identical specification to the organ he built a year earlier for the then parish church of St Michael, Coventry (later Coventry Cathedral). Both instruments have the standard Willis hallmarks—tierce mixtures on Great and Swell, characterful gedackts on the Choir, and a small but telling pedal division.

Apart from the addition of the electric blower in the 1920s, no major work was done until 1963, when the grandson of the original builder carried out a conservative restoration, at a cost of some £17,000. Before this time, the organ console was situated high up within the main case of the instrument, necessitating a walk of two or three minutes up a spiral staircase in the north transept. The action was a mixture of Barker lever, pneumatic and tracker. There were very few playing aids and contact between the organist and choir, some below, would have been almost impossible. In 1963, the organ committee decided to keep the original tonal scheme and voicing, and move the console over on to the south side in a new gallery placed above the choir stalls to a design by the architect John Phillips. Here the organist can hear the instrument properly, and maintain close contact with the choir.

The other main organ in the cathedral is a two-manual instrument in St Mary&#x27;s aisle, the sole remnant of the former parish church. It was originally built by Renatus Harris and was installed in Truro in 1750 by John Byfield. It was re-installed in the temporary church in 1880, but was significantly rebuilt and reduced in size in 1887 for installation in its current location. There is also a four-stop continuo organ by Kenneth Tickell.

In 2012, Tim Rice backed the 125-year anniversary appeal to support Truro Cathedral&#x27;s choir and music.

==Bells==
A ring of ten bells was cast in 1909 by John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough: the tenor bell weighs 33cwt-3qr-10lb (3790lb). Four further bells, also cast by Taylor, were installed in 2011: two completing the original ring to twelve, and two smaller ones to give the option of a lighter sound. In addition there are six bells in the Green Tower, previously in St Mary&#x27;s Parish Church, of which five form a chiming peal. A planned great bourdon bell for the south-west tower was never made.

==Choir==
Truro Cathedral has had an unbroken choral tradition dating from 1876. The present-day choir has twelve adult singers who are either lay vicars or choral scholars, accompanied by either eighteen boy choristers or eighteen girl choristers. After the closure of Truro Cathedral School in 1982, the cathedral no longer has a dedicated cathedral school. Instead, the choristers are awarded bursaries to attend Truro School.

Girl choristers were first admitted to the cathedral choir in 2015. On International Women&#x27;s Day in 2017 they appeared for the first time in a broadcast of the BBC Radio 3 programme &quot;Choral Evensong&quot;. The service included the first performance of two new works, namely a set of canticles by Dobrinka Tabakova and a set of responses by Sasha Johnson-Manning. The cathedral&#x27;s girl choristers were also among those selected to sing at the coronation of Charles III and Camilla in 2023. 

The choir appeared on the 2019 season of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;.

<doc id="348837" wikidata="Q6245315" url="?curid=348837" title="John Loughborough Pearson">
<text>John Loughborough Pearson (5 July 1817 – 11 December 1897) was a British Gothic Revival architect renowned for his work on churches and cathedrals. Pearson revived and practised largely the art of vaulting, and acquired in it a proficiency unrivalled in his generation. He worked on at least 210 ecclesiastical buildings in England alone in a career spanning 54 years.

==Early life and education==
Pearson was born in Brussels on 5 July 1817. He was the son of William Pearson, etcher, of Durham, and was brought up there. At the age of fourteen, he was articled to Ignatius Bonomi, architect, of Durham, whose clergy clientele helped stimulate Pearson&#x27;s long association with religious architecture, particularly of the Gothic style.

Pearson moved to London, where he became a pupil of Philip Hardwick (1792–1870), architect of the Euston Arch and Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. He lived in central London at 13 Mansfield Street (where a blue plaque commemorates him). He was awarded the RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 1880.

==Career==
From the erection of his first church at Ellerker, in Yorkshire, in 1843, to that of St Peter&#x27;s, Vauxhall, in 1864, his buildings are geometrical in manner and exhibit a close adherence to precedent, but elegance of proportion and refinement of detail lift them out of the commonplace of mere imitation. Holy Trinity, Westminster (1848), and St Mary&#x27;s, Dalton Holme (1858), are notable examples of this phase.

Pearson began his career drawing purely on English medieval prototypes, but increasingly incorporated ideas from abroad: Charles Locke Eastlake described Pearson&#x27;s Christchurch at Appleton-le-Moors in North Yorkshire as &quot;modelled on the earliest and severest type of French Gothic, with an admixture of details almost Byzantine in character.&quot;
St Peter&#x27;s Church, Vauxhall (1864), was his first groined church, and the first of a series of buildings which brought Pearson to the forefront among his contemporaries. In these he applied the Early English style to modern needs and modern economy with unrivalled success. St Augustine&#x27;s, Kilburn (1871), St John&#x27;s, Red Lion Square, London (1874, destroyed by a parachute mine in 1941), St Alban&#x27;s, Conybere Street, Birmingham (1880), St Michael&#x27;s, Croydon (1880), St John&#x27;s, Norwood (1881), St Stephen&#x27;s, Bournemouth (1889), and All Saints Church, Hove (1889), are characteristic examples of his mature work. He also did restoration work on smaller churches, including St Edward&#x27;s Church, Stow-on-the-Wold in Gloucestershire.

He was enlisted by Sir Tatton Sykes, 5th Baronet to develop the first of what now are known as &quot;Sykes churches&quot; near Sledmere. Initially Pearson restored the Church of St Michael and All Angels, Garton on the Wolds and the churches at Kirkburn, and Bishop Wilton, along with a new one at Hilton.

== Cathedrals ==
Pearson is best known for Truro Cathedral (1880), the first Anglican cathedral to be built in England since 1697. It has a special interest in its apt incorporation of the south aisle of the ancient church. Pearson&#x27;s conservative spirit fitted him for the repair of ancient buildings, and among cathedrals and other historic buildings placed under his care were Lincoln, Chichester, Peterborough, Bristol and Exeter cathedrals, St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, Westminster Hall, and Westminster Abbey, in the surveyorship of which he succeeded Sir George Gilbert Scott. He re-faced the north transept of Westminster Abbey, except for the porches (which are the work of Scott), and also designed the vigorous organ cases. In his handling of ancient buildings he was repeatedly opposed by the anti-restorers of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (as in the case of the west front of Peterborough Cathedral in 1896), but he generally proved the soundness of his judgment by his executed work.

While Truro Cathedral is considered his British masterpiece there are many who consider St John&#x27;s Cathedral in Brisbane, Australia, his finest work. St John&#x27;s was initially designed by Pearson and then by his son Frank following his father&#x27;s death in 1897. The cathedral was constructed between 1906 and 2009 and is a study in contrast to Truro. While lacking some of the decorative detail found at Truro and having shorter towers, the cathedral also departs from the conventional Early English style Neo-Gothic Pearson used extensively at Truro. St John&#x27;s employs a broad mix of styles: some early English Gothic (lancet windows and bell-shaped capitals in the piers); early French Gothic (the pyramidal spires of the towers, and the internal sexpartite vault of the ceiling, also used at Truro); and Spanish Gothic used extensively in the internal design of the nave and sanctuary. The form of Spanish Gothic used at St John&#x27;s is based on Barcelona Cathedral. The Barcelona influence can be seen in the nave which has two walls forming double aisles; the inner wall forming the nave arcade which has a wide panel below the triforium to help keep out the subtropical sun. But the Spanish precedent can best been seen in the cathedral&#x27;s large apsidal sanctuary (wholly different from the conventional English square-end at Truro) whose tall pillars reach from ground floor to the arches immediately below the vault, producing an effect of extraordinary complexity and beauty.

== Non-ecclesiastical buildings ==
Pearson&#x27;s practice was not confined to church buildings. Treberfydd (1850), Quar Wood (1858), Lechlade Manor, an Elizabethan house (1873), Westwood House, Sydenham, in the French Renaissance style (1880), the Astor estate offices (1892) upon the Victoria Embankment, London, the remodelling of the interiors of Cliveden House (1893) and No. 18 Carlton House Terrace (1894), with many parsonages, show his aptitude for domestic architecture.

In general design he first aimed at form, embracing both proportion and contour; and his work may be recognized by accurate scholarship coupled with harmonious detail. Its keynotes are cautiousness and refinement rather than boldness.

== Recognition ==
He was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1874, becoming a full member in 1880. He was also a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and a fellow and member of the Council of the Royal Institute of British Architects.

== Personal life ==
In 1862, Pearson married Jemima Christian, a cousin of his friend Ewan Christian, a Manxman and architect to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their son Frank Loughborough Pearson (1864–1947) was born two years later, but to Pearson&#x27;s great sorrow Jemima died on 25 March 1865 of typhoid fever. Frank followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps completing much of his work before embarking on his own original designs.

Pearson is buried in the nave of Westminster Abbey, where his grave is marked by the appropriate motto &quot;Sustinuit et abstinuit&quot;.

== Legacy ==
In total, 198 churches created or worked on by Pearson are now listed buildings. In 2016, Historic England commissioned a selective assessment of the significance of &quot;The Church and Chapel Interiors of John Loughborough Pearson&quot; to help those caring for the buildings to understand the importance of interior fixtures and fittings—particularly movable furniture, which is not covered by listing but a key part of the original designs.

<text>Landsberg am Lech is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Aichach-Friedberg, Fürstenfeldbruck, Starnberg, Weilheim-Schongau, Ostallgäu and Augsburg.

== History ==

In 1180 the lands east of the Lech river fell to the Wittelsbach dynasty of Bavaria; the lands on the western bank were acquired about 1315.

The district of Landsberg was established in 1938 as the successor of another entity (&quot;Bezirksamt&quot;) of the same name. In the administrative reform of 1972 the district received its present shape.

In the final stages of World War II, the German Armaments Ministry and the SS established the Kaufering concentration camp, including 11 subcamps in the general area of Landsberg and Kaufering. It was set up as a subcamp of Dachau. At the end of April 1945, the SS evacuated or destroyed what they could before the Allies arrived. A dramatization of the discovery and liberation of the camp was presented in Episode 9: Why We Fight of the &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; mini-series in the year 2001. The historical information, film and photographic material were given by Anton Posset to the film producer Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks.

== Geography ==

=== State ===
The administrative district lies in the west of Upper Bavaria and borders there on the administrative district Swabia (Bavaria). It comprises 31 municipalities with a total area of 804 km². The district is dominated by the Lech with its numerous barrages, the Ammersee, the rural communities in the south reaching as far as the foothills of the Alps and the large district town of Landsberg am Lech situated at the junction of the Bundesautobahn 96 (Munich-Lindau) with the Bundesstraße 17 (Augsburg-Füssen-Austria). The lowest point is Unterbergen (521 metres), the highest is Sachsenrieder Forst near Dietlried (853 metres).

The district has a share in the natural areas of Lechfeld, Ammersee and Pfaffenwinkel.

=== Land use ===
Settlement and traffic areas in the district account for 11.1% of the total area. Agricultural land accounts for 82.2% of the total area of the district, 54.2% of which is agricultural land and 28% forest land. While the north of the district is relatively poor in forests, the southern part has a high proportion of forest areas and large closed forest areas, such as the Sachsenrieder Forst and the Forst Bayerdießen.

=== Language border ===
The Bavarian-Alemannic language border runs through the district, essentially along the Lech. Within a few kilometers there are often clear differences in the local dialect.

The Lechrainer dialect is characteristic of the district.

=== Neighbouring districts ===
The administrative district borders clockwise in the north beginning with the administrative districts Aichach-Friedberg, Fürstenfeldbruck, Starnberg, Weilheim-Schongau, Ostallgäu and Augsburg.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms displays:
* the blue and white checked pattern of Bavaria
* the eagle was the heraldic animal of the county of Dießen-Andechs, which possessed the lands east of the Lech river before the 12th century
* the lion stands for Henry the Lion, who was the founder of the city of Landsberg

<text>Ignatius Bonomi (1787–1870) was an English architect and surveyor, with Italian origins by his father, strongly associated with Durham in north-east England.

==Life==
He was the son of an architect and draughtsman, Joseph Bonomi (1739–1808), who had worked with Robert and James Adam, while his brother Joseph Bonomi the Younger was a noted artist, sculptor and Egyptologist.
Bonomi was Surveyor of Bridges for the County of Durham, and his works included the Skerne Bridge; one of the first railway bridges in Britain, over the River Skerne, near Darlington, for the Stockton and Darlington Railway, in 1824 (hence he is sometimes referred to as &#x27;the first railway architect&#x27;).

He was also responsible for a number of church buildings (including commissions at Durham Cathedral). Other historic buildings, in Gothic and neo-classical styles, included Durham Castle, Lambton Castle (continuing the work started by his father), Durham Prison, Elvet Hill House (1820), Burn Hall, Windlestone Hall and Eggleston Hall, all in County Durham. In Derbyshire he designed Christ Church King Sterndale near Buxton, built in 1848–9 for the Pickford family, founders of the Pickfords removals business.

In 1817 Bonomi was contracted to design a mansion, Normanby Hall, in Normanby.

Other works included the remodelling of Crossbeck House (Normanby) (1824) the design of Marton House near Appleby-in-Westmorland, Cumbria (1822), Blagdon Hall (1830) in Stannington near Morpeth, St Mary&#x27;s Church, Sunderland (1830), rebuiding St Oswald&#x27;s Church, Durham (1834), the church of St John the Baptist in Leeming, North Yorkshire (1839) and the restoration of St Nicholas House, Richmond, North Yorkshire. For his brother Joseph, he also designed a house, &quot;The Camels&quot;, at Wimbledon in south-west London. He also designed houses at Masterman Place in Middleton-in-Teesdale.

In 1831, Bonomi took on John Loughborough Pearson as an apprentice. In 1842 he entered into a partnership with John Augustus Cory, later Cumberland County Architect (from 1862). The church of St John the Evangelist, Nenthead (1845, the highest church in England) was one of their joint projects.

Until 1850 he lived in his modest stone villa in Durham City, now the Oriental Museum.

<text>Garmarna is a Swedish folk rock band. Their songs are mainly old Scandinavian ballads.

== Biography ==
Garmarna was founded in 1990. Stefan Brisland-Ferner, Gotte Ringqvist and Rickard Westman were inspired by old Swedish music, which they had heard in a theatre. They began searching for old tunes and instruments. After two years of playing together, Jens Höglin joined the band on drums.

In 1992 the band recorded their first EP. They thought that female vocals would provide a contrast to the dark mood of their music and invited Emma Härdelin, a long-time friend of the band, as the guest vocalist on the EP. She officially joined the band in 1993. The debut EP sold well in Sweden, and helped the band tour in Scandinavia.

On the album &quot;Vittrad&quot;, the band decided to add samples and sequencers to the mix. In 1994, Omnium released &quot;Vittrad&quot; in the United States, with English translations of the old songs.

Garmarna started a long German tour and released the album &quot;Guds spelemän&quot; in 1996. The album sold well in Sweden and was reviewed favourably internationally.

In 1998 Garmarna did a series of concerts in churches in the North of Sweden presenting their interpretation of the medieval works of Hildegard of Bingen, together with actress Felicia Konrad.

In 1999 the band released their third album &quot;Vedergällningen&quot;. The album&#x27;s production leaned towards rock and trip hop, the atmosphere of the music being more obscure than in previous albums.

After &quot;Vedergällningen&quot;, the band collaborated with Swedish House producer Eric S. for their next studio album &quot;Hildegard von Bingen&quot;, which was released in 2001. The tracks in this album are based on the compositions of 12th century German abbess Hildegard of Bingen, with the lyrics to each song being sung entirely in Latin.

In 2003, their first EP was released as a full album with six bonus tracks.

In 2016, the band released their sixth album called &quot;6.&quot;

In 2018, Garmarna initiated a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for a new album, &quot;Förbundet&quot;, to be released on November 6, 2020. The album was released on Season of Mist containing mostly interpretations of traditional Swedish folk songs and two original tracks by Garmarna. Guest musicians on this album include Maria Franz from Heilung and Anders Norudde from Hedningarna.

<text>The erratic ant (Tapinoma erraticum) is a species of dolichoderine ant first described in 1789 by Latreille.

This species ranges throughout central Europe from the mountains of southern Italy to northern Germany. It is present in coastal areas of southern England and on the islands of Gotland and Öland in Sweden.

A thermophilic species, &quot;T. erraticum&quot; is found principally on dry heathland, exposed to the sun. The workers are very agile, and are usually only seen when the sun is shining, and the species can easily be distinguished from superficially similar species (e.g. &quot;Lasius niger&quot;) by its tendency to hold its gaster almost vertically when moving. Horace Donisthorpe commented: &quot;When the sun is obscured these ants immediately disappear, and on cold and cloudy days very few specimens are to be found away from the nest.&quot;

Colonies are usually small, although larger colonies occasionally occur. Donisthorpe records having found a particularly large colony in Weybridge on July 29, 1913, in which &quot;the deälated females and workers in this nest being the largest I have ever seen&quot;.

Colonies are polygynous and have been recorded to contain up to 40 deälated females. Nests are shallow and small solaria often feature in nest structure to concentrate solar heat onto the ants&#x27; brood.

Nuptial flights take place in June, although they may be postponed during colder years to July.

<doc id="348853" wikidata="Q922903" url="?curid=348853" title="Tyranny of the majority">
<text>Tyranny of the majority refers to a situation in majority rule where the preferences and interests of the majority dominate the political landscape, potentially sidelining or repressing minority groups and using majority rule to take non-democratic actions. This idea has been discussed by various thinkers, including John Stuart Mill in &quot;On Liberty&quot; and Alexis de Tocqueville in &quot;Democracy in America&quot;.

To reduce the risk of majority tyranny, modern democracies frequently have countermajoritarian institutions that restrict the ability of majorities to repress minorities and stymie political competition. In the context of a nation, constitutional limits on the powers of a legislative body such as a bill of rights or supermajority clause have been used. Separation of powers or judicial independence may also be implemented.

In social choice, a tyranny-of-the-majority scenario can be formally defined as a situation where the candidate or decision preferred by a majority is greatly inferior (hence &quot;tyranny&quot;) to the socially optimal candidate or decision according to some measure of excellence such as total utilitarianism or the egalitarian rule.

==Origin of the term==
The origin of the term &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; is commonly attributed to Alexis de Tocqueville, who used it in his book &quot;Democracy in America&quot;. It appears in Part 2 of the book in the title of Chapter 8, &quot;What Moderates the Tyranny of the Majority in the United States&#x27; Absence of Administrative Centralization&quot; () and in the previous chapter in the names of sections such as &quot;The Tyranny of the Majority&quot; and &quot;Effects of the Tyranny of the Majority on American National Character; the Courtier Spirit in the United States&quot;.

While the specific phrase &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; is frequently attributed to various Founding Fathers of the United States, only John Adams is known to have used it, arguing against government by a single unicameral elected body. Writing in defense of the Constitution in March 1788, Adams referred to &quot;a single sovereign assembly, each member…only accountable to his constituents; and the majority of members who have been of one party&quot; as a &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;, attempting to highlight the need instead for &quot;a mixed government, consisting of three branches&quot;. Constitutional author James Madison presented a similar idea in Federalist 10, citing the destabilizing effect of &quot;the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority&quot; on a government, though the essay as a whole focuses on the Constitution&#x27;s efforts to mitigate factionalism generally.

Later users include Edmund Burke, who wrote in a 1790 letter that &quot;The tyranny of a multitude is a multiplied tyranny.&quot; It was further popularised by John Stuart Mill, influenced by Tocqueville, in &quot;On Liberty&quot; (1859). Friedrich Nietzsche used the phrase in the first sequel to &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot; (1879). Ayn Rand wrote that individual rights are not subject to a public vote, and that the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities and &quot;the smallest minority on earth is the individual&quot;. In Herbert Marcuse&#x27;s 1965 essay &quot;Repressive Tolerance&quot;, he said &quot;tolerance is extended to policies, conditions, and modes of behavior which should not be tolerated because they are impeding, if not destroying, the chances of creating an existence without fear and misery&quot; and that &quot;this sort of tolerance strengthens the tyranny of the majority against which authentic liberals protested&quot;. In 1994, legal scholar Lani Guinier used the phrase as the title for a collection of law review articles.

A term used in Classical and Hellenistic Greece for oppressive popular rule was &quot;ochlocracy&quot; (&quot;mob rule&quot;); &quot;tyranny&quot; meant rule by one man—whether undesirable or not.

== Examples ==

Herbert Spencer, in &quot;The Right to Ignore the State&quot; (1851), pointed the problem with the following example:
==Concurrent majority==
Secession of the Confederate States of America from the United States was anchored by a version of subsidiarity, found within the doctrines of John C. Calhoun. Antebellum South Carolina utilized Calhoun&#x27;s doctrines in the Old South as public policy, adopted from his theory of concurrent majority. This &quot;localism&quot; strategy was presented as a mechanism to circumvent Calhoun&#x27;s perceived tyranny of the majority in the United States. Each state presumptively held the Sovereign power to block federal laws that infringed upon states&#x27; rights, autonomously. Calhoun&#x27;s policies directly influenced Southern public policy regarding slavery, and undermined the Supremacy Clause power granted to the federal government. The subsequent creation of the Confederate States of America catalyzed the American Civil War.

19th century concurrent majority theories held logical counterbalances to standard tyranny of the majority harms originating from Antiquity and onward. Essentially, illegitimate or temporary coalitions that held majority volume could disproportionately outweigh and hurt any significant minority, by nature and sheer volume. Calhoun&#x27;s contemporary doctrine was presented as one of limitation within American democracy to prevent traditional tyranny, whether actual or imagined.

== Viewpoints ==

===James Madison===

Federalist No. 10 &quot;The Same Subject Continued: The Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection&quot; (November 23, 1787): 

The inference to which we are brought is, that the CAUSES of faction cannot be removed, and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its EFFECTS. If a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may convulse the society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the Constitution. When a majority is included in a faction, the form of popular government, on the other hand, enables it to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens. To secure the public good and private rights against the danger of such a faction, and at the same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular government, is then the great object to which our inquiries are directed...By what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of two only. Either the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at the same time must be prevented, or the majority, having such coexistent passion or interest, must be rendered, by their number and local situation, unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of oppression.

=== Alexis de Tocqueville ===
With respect to American democracy, Tocqueville, in his book Democracy in America, says:


=== Critique by Robert A. Dahl ===
Robert A. Dahl argues that the tyranny of the majority is a spurious dilemma (p. 171): 

=== Trampling the rights of minorities ===
Regarding recent American politics (specifically initiatives), Donovan et al. argue that:
===Public choice theory===
The notion that, in a democracy, the greatest concern is that the majority will tyrannise and exploit diverse smaller interests, has been criticised by Mancur Olson in &quot;The Logic of Collective Action&quot;, who argues instead that narrow and well organised minorities are more likely to assert their interests over those of the majority. Olson argues that when the benefits of political action (e.g., lobbying) are spread over fewer agents, there is a stronger individual incentive to contribute to that political activity. Narrow groups, especially those who can reward active participation to their group goals, might therefore be able to dominate or distort political process, a process studied in public choice theory.

Class studies

Tyranny of the majority has also been prevalent in some class studies. Rahim Baizidi uses the concept of &quot;democratic suppression&quot; to analyze the tyranny of the majority in economic classes. According to this, the majority of the upper and middle classes, together with a small portion of the lower class, form the majority coalition of conservative forces in the society.

===Vote trading===
Anti-federalists of public choice theory point out that vote trading can protect minority interests from majorities in representative democratic bodies such as legislatures. They continue that direct democracy, such as statewide propositions on ballots, does not offer such protections.

<text>James Lee Dozier (born April 10, 1931) is a retired United States Army officer. In December 1981, he was kidnapped by the Italian Red Brigades, a Marxist guerilla group. After 42 days of captivity, he was rescued by NOCS - an elite Italian special forces unit - with help from the Intelligence Support Activity&#x27;s Operation Winter Harvest. At the time, General Dozier was serving as deputy Chief of Staff at NATO&#x27;s Southern European land forces headquarters in Verona, Italy. In a press statement, the Red Brigades claimed that the excellent diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Italy - and the fact that Dozier was an American officer invited to work in Italy - rendered his abduction &quot;justified&quot;. To date, he remains the only American flag officer ever taken prisoner by a violent non-state actor.

==Military career==
Dozier was born in Arcadia, Florida. Dozier graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1956. He was a classmate of General Norman Schwarzkopf. He went to the Armor School at Fort Knox, Kentucky, for basic and advanced training in armored warfare. He served in the Vietnam War with the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment from 1968 to 1969 where he was awarded the Silver Star medal and later served tours of duty at the Pentagon and in West Germany.

==Education==
Dozier graduated from the U.S. Military Academy with a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering. Later he earned a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Arizona. Dozier attended the Army Command and General Staff College and the Army War College.

==Kidnapping==

At the time, Brigadier General Dozier was kidnapped from his apartment in Verona at approximately 6 pm on December 17, 1981, by four men posing as plumbers. It was later reported that as many as four additional terrorists provided support using multiple vehicles. Although his wife, Judy Dozier, was not kidnapped, she was briefly held at gunpoint to coerce Dozier into compliance, and the terrorists left her bound and chained in the apartment&#x27;s laundry room. Judy Dozier was rescued after she generated enough noise by leaning against the washing machine and hitting it with her shoulders and knees, which alerted a downstairs neighbor.

In his paper &quot;The Italian Red Brigades (1969–1984): Political Revolution and Threats to the State&quot;, Paul J. Smith, a National Security Affairs professor at the U.S. Naval War College, explains that

Dozier was able to temporarily remove his headphones while his guard was not watching, allowing him to identify morning and evening traffic and thus tell time. He tracked the days in his diary, ending with a count of 40 days - a discrepancy of 2 days from the actual duration of his captivity. Dozier kept a diary by playing Solitaire and recording fabricated scores on paper supplied by his guards. These scores were a base-seven alpha-numeric code developed by Dozier, based on the seven piles of cards used in the card game and the number of cards in each pile.

Dozier was held for 42 days until January 28, 1982, when a team from NOCS - a special operations unit of the Italian police) - rescued him from an apartment in Padua without firing a shot, capturing the entire terrorist cell. According to Luis Elizondo, remote viewers — trained as “supersoldiers” with psychic abilities under the Stargate program — were credited with locating Brigadier General Dozier during his kidnapping by the Red Brigades. The guard, Ugo Milani, assigned to kill Dozier in the event of a rescue attempt did not do so, and was overwhelmed by the rescuing force.

After his return to the U.S. Army in Vicenza, President Reagan congratulated him by telephone on regaining his freedom.

==Aftermath==
Dozier was later promoted to major general and eventually retired from active military service.

==Awards and decorations==

During his military career he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star and Purple Heart (for actions during Vietnam War), Ranger Tab and Parachutist Badge.

<doc id="348860" wikidata="Q7249476" url="?curid=348860" title="Projective representation">
<text>In the field of representation theory in mathematics, a projective representation of a group &quot;G&quot; on a vector space &quot;V&quot; over a field &quot;F&quot; is a group homomorphism from &quot;G&quot; to the projective linear group
formula_1
where GL(&quot;V&quot;) is the general linear group of invertible linear transformations of &quot;V&quot; over &quot;F&quot;, and &quot;F&quot;∗ is the normal subgroup consisting of nonzero scalar multiples of the identity transformation (see Scalar transformation).

In more concrete terms, a projective representation of formula_2 is a collection of operators formula_3 satisfying the homomorphism property up to a constant:
:formula_4
for some constant formula_5. Equivalently, a projective representation of formula_2 is a collection of operators formula_7, such that formula_8. Note that, in this notation, formula_9 is a &quot;set&quot; of linear operators related by multiplication with some nonzero scalar.

If it is possible to choose a particular representative formula_10 in each family of operators in such a way that the homomorphism property is satisfied &quot;on the nose&quot;, rather than just up to a constant, then we say that formula_11 can be &quot;de-projectivized&quot;, or that formula_11 can be &quot;lifted to an ordinary representation&quot;. More concretely, we thus say that formula_11 can be de-projectivized if there are formula_10 for each formula_15 such that formula_16. This possibility is discussed further below.

==Linear representations and projective representations==

One way in which a projective representation can arise is by taking a linear group representation of on and applying the quotient map

:formula_17

which is the quotient by the subgroup of scalar transformations (diagonal matrices with all diagonal entries equal). The interest for algebra is in the process in the other direction: given a &quot;projective representation&quot;, try to &#x27;lift&#x27; it to an ordinary &quot;linear representation&quot;. A general projective representation cannot be lifted to a linear representation , and the obstruction to this lifting can be understood via group cohomology, as described below.

However, one &quot;can&quot; lift a projective representation formula_18 of to a linear representation of a different group , which will be a central extension of . The group formula_19 is the subgroup of formula_20 defined as follows:
:formula_21,
where formula_22 is the quotient map of formula_23 onto formula_24. Since formula_18 is a homomorphism, it is easy to check that formula_19 is, indeed, a subgroup of formula_20. If the original projective representation formula_18 is faithful, then formula_19 is isomorphic to the preimage in formula_23 of formula_31.

We can define a homomorphism formula_32 by setting formula_33. The kernel of formula_34 is:
:formula_35,
which is contained in the center of formula_19. It is clear also that formula_34 is surjective, so that formula_19 is a central extension of formula_2. We can also define an ordinary representation formula_40 of formula_19 by setting formula_42. The &quot;ordinary&quot; representation formula_40 of formula_19 is a lift of the &quot;projective&quot; representation formula_18 of formula_2 in the sense that:
:formula_47.

If is a perfect group there is a single universal perfect central extension of that can be used.

===Group cohomology===
The analysis of the lifting question involves group cohomology. Indeed, if one fixes for each in a lifted element in lifting from back to , the lifts then satisfy

:formula_48

for some scalar in . It follows that the 2-cocycle or Schur multiplier satisfies the cocycle equation

:formula_49

for all in . This depends on the choice of the lift ; a different choice of lift will result in a different cocycle

:formula_50

cohomologous to . Thus defines a unique class in . This class might not be trivial. For example, in the case of the symmetric group and alternating group, Schur established that there is exactly one non-trivial class of Schur multiplier, and completely determined all the corresponding irreducible representations.

In general, a nontrivial class leads to an extension problem for . If is correctly extended we obtain a linear representation of the extended group, which induces the original projective representation when pushed back down to . The solution is always a central extension. From Schur&#x27;s lemma, it follows that the irreducible representations of central extensions of , and the irreducible projective representations of , are essentially the same objects.

==First example: discrete Fourier transform==

Consider the field formula_51 of integers mod formula_52, where formula_52 is prime, and let formula_54 be the formula_52-dimensional space of functions on formula_51 with values in formula_57. For each formula_58 in formula_51, define two operators, formula_60 and formula_61 on formula_54 as follows:
:formula_63

We write the formula for formula_61 as if formula_58 and formula_66 were integers, but it is easily seen that the result only depends on the value of formula_58 and formula_66 mod formula_52. The operator formula_60 is a translation, while formula_61 is a shift in frequency space (that is, it has the effect of translating the discrete Fourier transform of formula_72).

One may easily verify that for any formula_58 and formula_66 in formula_51, the operators formula_60 and formula_77 commute up to multiplication by a constant:
:formula_78.

We may therefore define a projective representation formula_18 of formula_80 as follows:
:formula_81,
where formula_82 denotes the image of an operator formula_83 in the quotient group formula_24. Since formula_60 and formula_77 commute up to a constant, formula_18 is easily seen to be a projective representation. On the other hand, since formula_60 and formula_77 do not actually commute—and no nonzero multiples of them will commute—formula_18 cannot be lifted to an ordinary (linear) representation of formula_80.

Since the projective representation formula_18 is faithful, the central extension formula_19 of formula_80 obtained by the construction in the previous section is just the preimage in formula_23 of the image of formula_18. Explicitly, this means that formula_19 is the group of all operators of the form
:formula_98

for formula_99. This group is a discrete version of the Heisenberg group and is isomorphic to the group of matrices of the form
::formula_100

with formula_101.

==Projective representations of Lie groups==

Studying projective representations of Lie groups leads one to consider true representations of their central extensions (see ). In many cases of interest it suffices to consider representations of covering groups. Specifically, suppose formula_102 is a connected cover of a connected Lie group formula_2, so that formula_104 for a discrete central subgroup formula_105 of formula_102. (Note that formula_102 is a special sort of central extension of formula_2.) Suppose also that formula_109 is an irreducible unitary representation of formula_102 (possibly infinite dimensional). Then by Schur&#x27;s lemma, the central subgroup formula_105 will act by scalar multiples of the identity. Thus, at the projective level, formula_109 will descend to formula_2. That is to say, for each formula_15, we can choose a preimage formula_115 of formula_116 in formula_102, and define a projective representation formula_18 of formula_2 by setting
:formula_120,
where formula_82 denotes the image in formula_24 of an operator formula_83. Since formula_105 is contained in the center of formula_102 and the center of formula_102 acts as scalars, the value of formula_127 does not depend on the choice of formula_115.

The preceding construction is an important source of examples of projective representations. Bargmann&#x27;s theorem (discussed below) gives a criterion under which &quot;every&quot; irreducible projective unitary representation of formula_2 arises in this way.

===Projective representations of SO(3)===
A physically important example of the above construction comes from the case of the rotation group SO(3), whose universal cover is SU(2). According to the representation theory of SU(2), there is exactly one irreducible representation of SU(2) in each dimension. When the dimension is odd (the &quot;integer spin&quot; case), the representation descends to an ordinary representation of SO(3). When the dimension is even (the &quot;fractional spin&quot; case), the representation does not descend to an ordinary representation of SO(3) but does (by the result discussed above) descend to a projective representation of SO(3). Such projective representations of SO(3) (the ones that do not come from ordinary representations) are referred to as &quot;spinorial representations&quot;, whose elements (vectors) are called spinors.

By an argument discussed below, every finite-dimensional, irreducible &quot;projective&quot; representation of SO(3) comes from a finite-dimensional, irreducible &quot;ordinary&quot; representation of SU(2).

===Examples of covers, leading to projective representations===
Notable cases of covering groups giving interesting projective representations:

* The special orthogonal group SO(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) is doubly covered by the Spin group Spin(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;). 
*In particular, the group SO(3) (the rotation group in 3 dimensions) is doubly covered by SU(2). This has important applications in quantum mechanics, as the study of representations of SU(2) leads to a nonrelativistic (low-velocity) theory of spin.
* The group SO+(3;1), isomorphic to the Möbius group, is likewise doubly covered by SL2(C). Both are supergroups of aforementioned SO(3) and SU(2) respectively and form a relativistic spin theory.
*The universal cover of the Poincaré group is a double cover (the semidirect product of SL2(C) with R4). The irreducible unitary representations of this cover give rise to projective representations of the Poincaré group, as in Wigner&#x27;s classification. Passing to the cover is essential, in order to include the fractional spin case.
* The orthogonal group O(&quot;n&quot;) is double covered by the Pin group Pin±(&quot;n&quot;).
* The symplectic group Sp(2&quot;n&quot;)=Sp(2&quot;n&quot;, R) (not to be confused with the compact real form of the symplectic group, sometimes also denoted by Sp(&quot;m&quot;)) is double covered by the metaplectic group Mp(2&quot;n&quot;). An important projective representation of Sp(2&quot;n&quot;) comes from the metaplectic representation of Mp(2&quot;n&quot;).

===Finite-dimensional projective unitary representations===
In quantum physics, symmetry of a physical system is typically implemented by means of a projective unitary representation formula_18 of a Lie group formula_2 on the quantum Hilbert space, that is, a continuous homomorphism
:formula_132
where formula_133 is the quotient of the unitary group formula_134 by the operators of the form formula_135. The reason for taking the quotient is that physically, two vectors in the Hilbert space that are proportional represent the same physical state. [That is to say, the space of (pure) states is the set of equivalence classes of unit vectors, where two unit vectors are considered equivalent if they are proportional.] Thus, a unitary operator that is a multiple of the identity actually acts as the identity on the level of physical states.

A finite-dimensional projective representation of formula_2 then gives rise to a projective unitary representation formula_137 of the Lie algebra formula_138 of formula_2. In the finite-dimensional case, it is always possible to &quot;de-projectivize&quot; the Lie-algebra representation formula_137 simply by choosing a representative for each formula_141 having trace zero. In light of the homomorphisms theorem, it is then possible to de-projectivize formula_18 itself, but at the expense of passing to the universal cover formula_143 of formula_2. That is to say, every finite-dimensional projective unitary representation of formula_2 arises from an ordinary unitary representation of formula_143 by the procedure mentioned at the beginning of this section.

Specifically, since the Lie-algebra representation was de-projectivized by choosing a trace-zero representative, every finite-dimensional projective unitary representation of formula_2 arises from a &quot;determinant-one&quot; ordinary unitary representation of formula_143 (i.e., one in which each element of formula_143 acts as an operator with determinant one). If formula_138 is semisimple, then every element of formula_138 is a linear combination of commutators, in which case &quot;every&quot; representation of formula_138 is by operators with trace zero. In the semisimple case, then, the associated linear representation of formula_143 is unique.

Conversely, if formula_18 is an &quot;irreducible&quot; unitary representation of the universal cover formula_143 of formula_2, then by Schur&#x27;s lemma, the center of formula_143 acts as scalar multiples of the identity. Thus, at the projective level, formula_18 descends to a projective representation of the original group formula_2. Thus, there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between the irreducible projective representations of formula_2 and the irreducible, determinant-one ordinary representations of formula_143. (In the semisimple case, the qualifier &quot;determinant-one&quot; may be omitted, because in that case, every representation of formula_143 is automatically determinant one.)

An important example is the case of SO(3), whose universal cover is SU(2). Now, the Lie algebra formula_163 is semisimple. Furthermore, since SU(2) is a compact group, every finite-dimensional representation of it admits an inner product with respect to which the representation is unitary. Thus, the irreducible &quot;projective&quot; representations of SO(3) are in one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible &quot;ordinary&quot; representations of SU(2).

===Infinite-dimensional projective unitary representations: the Heisenberg case===
The results of the previous subsection do not hold in the infinite-dimensional case, simply because the trace of formula_141 is typically not well defined. Indeed, the result fails: Consider, for example, the translations in position space and in momentum space for a quantum particle moving in formula_165, acting on the Hilbert space formula_166. These operators are defined as follows:
:formula_167

for all formula_168. These operators are simply continuous versions of the operators formula_60 and formula_61 described in the &quot;First example&quot; section above. As in that section, we can then define a &quot;projective&quot; unitary representation formula_18 of formula_172:
:formula_173
because the operators commute up to a phase factor. But no choice of the phase factors will lead to an ordinary unitary representation, since translations in position do not commute with translations in momentum (and multiplying by a nonzero constant will not change this). These operators do, however, come from an ordinary unitary representation of the Heisenberg group, which is a one-dimensional central extension of formula_172. (See also the Stone–von Neumann theorem.)

===Infinite-dimensional projective unitary representations: Bargmann&#x27;s theorem===
On the other hand, Bargmann&#x27;s theorem states that if the second Lie algebra cohomology group formula_175 of formula_138 is trivial, then every projective unitary representation of formula_2 can be de-projectivized after passing to the universal cover. More precisely, suppose we begin with a projective unitary representation formula_18 of a Lie group formula_2. Then the theorem states that formula_18 can be lifted to an ordinary unitary representation formula_181 of the universal cover formula_102 of formula_2. This means that formula_181 maps each element of the kernel of the covering map to a scalar multiple of the identity—so that at the projective level, formula_181 descends to formula_2—and that the associated projective representation of formula_2 is equal to formula_18.

The theorem does not apply to the group formula_172—as the previous example shows—because the second cohomology group of the associated commutative Lie algebra is nontrivial. Examples where the result does apply include semisimple groups (e.g., SL(2,R)) and the Poincaré group. This last result is important for Wigner&#x27;s classification of the projective unitary representations of the Poincaré group.

The proof of Bargmann&#x27;s theorem goes by considering a central extension formula_19 of formula_2, constructed similarly to the section above on linear representations and projective representations, as a subgroup of the direct product group formula_192, where formula_193 is the Hilbert space on which formula_18 acts and formula_195 is the group of unitary operators on formula_193. The group formula_19 is defined as
:formula_198
As in the earlier section, the map formula_199 given by formula_200 is a surjective homomorphism whose kernel is formula_201 so that formula_19 is a central extension of formula_2. Again as in the earlier section, we can then define a linear representation formula_40 of formula_19 by setting formula_206. Then formula_40 is a lift of formula_18 in the sense that formula_209, where formula_22 is the quotient map from formula_195 to formula_212.

A key technical point is to show that formula_19 is a &quot;Lie&quot; group. (This claim is not so obvious, because if formula_193 is infinite dimensional, the group formula_192 is an infinite-dimensional topological group.) Once this result is established, we see that formula_19 is a one-dimensional Lie group central extension of formula_2, so that the Lie algebra formula_218 of formula_19 is also a one-dimensional central extension of formula_138 (note here that the adjective &quot;one-dimensional&quot; does not refer to formula_19 and formula_222, but rather to the kernel of the projection map from those objects onto formula_2 and formula_224 respectively). But the cohomology group formula_175 may be identified with the space of one-dimensional (again, in the aforementioned sense) central extensions of formula_138; if formula_175 is trivial then every one-dimensional central extension of formula_138 is trivial. In that case, formula_218 is just the direct sum of formula_138 with a copy of the real line. It follows that the universal cover formula_231 of formula_19 must be just a direct product of the universal cover of formula_2 with a copy of the real line. We can then lift formula_40 from formula_19 to formula_231 (by composing with the covering map) and finally restrict this lift to the universal cover formula_143 of formula_2.
