<text>Hinckley is a market town in south-west Leicestershire, England. It is administered by Hinckley and Bosworth Borough Council. Hinckley is the third largest settlement in Leicestershire, after Leicester and Loughborough. Hinckley is about halfway between Leicester and Coventry and borders Nuneaton in Warwickshire. Watling Street forms part of the Leicestershire/Warwickshire border. The town forms an urban area with the village of Burbage, directly to the south.

== History ==

In 2000, archaeologists from Northampton Archaeology discovered evidence of Iron Age and Romano-British settlement on land near Coventry Road and Watling Street.

Hinckley has a recorded history going back to Anglo-Saxon times; the name Hinckley is Anglo-Saxon: &quot;Hinck&quot; is a personal name and &quot;ley&quot; is a clearing in a wood. By the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, Hinckley was quite a large village, and it grew over the following 200 years into a small market town—a market was first recorded there in 1311. There is evidence of an Anglo-Saxon church – the remnants of an Anglo-Saxon sundial being visible on the diagonal buttress on the south-east corner of the chancel.

Hinckley is around to the south of what is believed to be the location of the Battle of Bosworth, the last significant battle of the Wars of the Roses, which occurred in 1485, and resulted in Henry Tudor&#x27;s forces defeating those of King Richard III.

=== 17th century ===

In the 17th century, the town developed a hosiery industry, producing stockings and similar items. Hinckley played a prominent part in the English Civil War. Its proximity to several rival strongholds—the royalist garrisons at Caldicote, Ashby de la Zouch and Leicester, and those of the Parliamentarians at Tamworth and Coventry—and the presence of parties of troops or brigands occupying several fortified houses in nearby Warwickshire, led to frequent visits by the warring parties. The local townsfolk were forced to decide whether to declare their allegiances openly or attempt to remain neutral—with the risk of having to pay levies, ransoms, and fines to both sides.

In March 1644, Hinckley was occupied by a group of Royalist troops, though they were soon driven out by a force of Parliamentarians, who took many prisoners.

The Civil War years were a particularly unsettled time for the clergy in and around Hinckley. Parsons with parliamentary leanings like Thomas Cleveland, the vicar of Hinckley, suffered sequestration by the Leicester County Committee, like some of his &quot;malignant&quot; neighbours accused of visiting royalist garrisons or preaching against Parliament.

The town was visited by both parliamentary and royalist troops from the rival garrisons, particularly parliamentary troops from Tamworth, Coventry and Astley Castle in Warwickshire. Troops from Coventry garrison were particularly active in the town, taking horses and &quot;free quarter&quot; and availing themselves of &#x27;dyett and Beere&#x27;, and taking some of the inhabitants hostage for ransom. Royalist troops raided the town to threaten those with parliamentary sympathies. The notorious Lord Hastings of Ashby de la Zouch is recorded to have &quot;coursed about the country as far as Dunton and Lutterworth and took near upon a hundred of the clergymen and others, and carried them prisoners … threatening to hang all them that should take the Parliament&#x27;s Covenant&quot;.

Parliamentary newssheets record that on the night of 4 March 1644, Hastings&#x27;s men brought in &quot;26 honest countrymen from several towns&quot; intending to take them to Ashby de la Zouch, along with a huge herd of cattle, oxen and horses from the country people and a minister named Warner. These prisoners were herded into Hinckley church and asked &quot;in a jeering manner, &#x27;Where are the Round-heads your brethren at Leicester? Why come they not to redeem you?&#x27;&quot;
The Parliamentarians responded in a memorable &quot;Skirmish or Great Victory for Parliament&quot;. Colonel Grey with 120 foot-soldiers and 30 troopers from Bagworth House rushed to Hinckley and retook the town, routed the Royalists, rescued the cattle and released their imprisoned countrymen. No doubt the inhabitants of the town were as relieved as any when Ashby finally surrendered, as Vicars records, &quot;a great mercy and mighty preservation of the peace and tranquility of all those adjacent parts about it.&quot;
=== 19th century ===

At the time of the first national census in 1801, Hinckley had a population of 5,158: twenty years later it had increased by about a thousand. The largest industry in the early 19th century was the making of hosiery and only Leicester had a larger output of stockings. In the district, it was estimated around 1830 that 6,000 persons were employed in this work.

Between 1816 and 1822, Ada Byron, the only legitimate daughter of the poet, Lord Byron, lived at Kirby House, Kirkby Mallory 6 miles from Hinckley. She was cared for by her Grandmother, while running their midland estates and necessitating frequent visits to the bank in Hinckley. Ada would go with her, and it is recorded, Ada &quot;loved Hinckley&quot;. If she misbehaved, her Grandmother would leave her at home! Ada was christened at K. Mallory Parish Church and a significant memorial stands in the churchyard to her. Hinckley is recognised as Ada&#x27;s childhood home town. She was known latterly as Ada Lovelace and when working with Charles Babbage, she foresaw computerisation, writing the first computer programme.

Joseph Hansom built the first Hansom cab in Hinckley in 1835.

In 1899 a cottage hospital was built to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria two years earlier. Money was raised by the local townspeople and factory owners, notably John and Thomas Atkins who also had a hand in building many of the key buildings of Hinckley. The cornerstone was laid by Sir John Fowke Lancelot Rolleston.

This hospital was central to the people of Hinckley and supported by local workers who donated one penny a week for its upkeep until it was adopted by the NHS in 1948. Over the years it expanded to align with the town. The hospital now appears dilapidated in some areas and is threatened with closure, sale and demolition by West Leicestershire Clinical Commissioning Group and NHS Properties Ltd.

===Recent===
On 16 May 1941 eleven people were killed, which was the worst attack in the county, outside Leicester. Nearby Nuneaton was heavily bombed that night. In Merevale Avenue, four men, six women and one child were killed. Numbers 5 and 7 had a direct hit.

The hosiery industry remained important for much of the 20th century, and by 1939 the Hinckley and District Hosiery Union alone had 6,000 members.

The area was subject to new housing developments in the 1950s, 1960s and 1990s.

== Geography ==
Hinckley&#x27;s suburban districts include Hollycroft, Middlefield, Stoneygate, Wykin, Forest View, West Hinckley, Saxon Paddock and Druid Quarter. The suburbs of Burbage, Sketchley and Lash Hill are separated from the rest of Hinckley by the railway line.

== Governance ==
Hinckley became an urban district under the Local Government Act 1894, covering the ancient parish of Hinckley. In 1934, under a County Review Order, Hinckley urban district expanded to include the ancient parishes of Barwell, Burbage and Earl Shilton and most of Stoke Golding. In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972 the Hinckley urban district was abolished, becoming an unparished area in the borough of Hinckley and Bosworth. Since then, the civil parishes of Barwell, Burbage, Earl Shilton and Stoke Golding have been re-established. The core urban area remained unparished.

Hinckley is a traditional centre of the hosiery industry. The first framework knitting machine was brought here by Joseph Iliffe in the 17th century and by the 19th century Hinckley was responsible for a large proportion of Britain&#x27;s hosiery production. Since the Second World War the hosiery industry has steadily shrunk although several textile firms remain in the area.

== Folklore ==
Hinckley was known to its residents for many years as &quot;Tin &#x27;At&quot; (tin hat). It is reputed that, many years ago, one of the itinerant sheep drovers bragged that he could drink a hat full of ale. The local landlord put this man to the test by getting the local blacksmith to make a tin hat, which he then filled with ale. Thereafter, the town became known as &quot;Tin &#x27;At&quot;. Another explanation is that the people of Hinckley used to place buckets on water pumps to keep them clean and prevent the spread of illness, the bucket obviously being the &quot;Tin &#x27;At&quot;. A tin hat can be seen on top of the flag pole which sits on the roof of the Coral branch at the corner of Castle Street and Market Place. There is also a pub called The Tin Hat, and an annual fair held each December in the town centre called The Tin Hat Fair.

== Twinning ==

Typically playing as a left winger, Ramzi Abid was selected by the Colorado Avalanche as the first choice in the second round (28th overall) of the 1998 NHL Entry Draft and was redrafted in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, 85th overall, by the Phoenix Coyotes, who on March 11, 2003, traded him to the Pittsburgh Penguins with Dan Focht and Guillaume Lefebvre for Jan Hrdina and François Leroux .

In March 2003, he successfully underwent surgery to repair a torn ACL and missed the remainder of the 2002–03 season. He played for the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, an affiliate team of the Pittsburgh Penguins, in the American Hockey League during the 2004–05 NHL lockout. Abid spent the 2005–06 season with the Atlanta Thrashers.

On July 21, 2006, Abid signed a one-year contract with the Nashville Predators. Abid had an impressive pre-season, in which he scored a hat-trick in an 8-1 win over the Blue Jackets on September 21, 2006. Abid was then sent to affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals, prior to the start of the 2006-07 season. Abid played 13 games with the Predators as an injury replacement during the season. On April 18, 2007, Ramzi was called up to the Predators and made his play-off debut against the San Jose Sharks in the Western Conference Quarterfinals.

Abid was a member of Team Canada in the 2007 Spengler Cup. In 2007, Abid signed with SC Bern to play through the 2009-10 season. He played two seasons for SC Bern before his contract was dissolved in April 2009.

In August 2009, he signed with Traktor Chelyabinsk of the Kontinental Hockey League for the 2009–10 season. After 33 games with Traktor he left the KHL on January 31, 2010. On February 1, 2010, Abid agreed to a contract with Rögle BK.

On June 11, 2010, Abid again a free agent, signed a one-year contract with EC Red Bull Salzburg that also included a one-year option, a team playing in the EBEL.

After a second season with Red Bull, Abid was again on the move within Europe, signing a one-year contract with JYP of the Finnish SM-liiga on July 23, 2012. In his first season with the Finnish club, Abid contributed with a team leading 22 goals and 42 points in 56 games and was signed to a one-year extension at the midpoint of the season.

Abid struggled in his return campaign in 2013–14 with JYP, posting 3 goals in 21 games before he was mutually released from his contract and signed in the German DEL with Grizzly Adams Wolfsburg on December 18, 2013.

<text>Tomás Luis de Victoria (sometimes Italianised as &quot;da Vittoria&quot;; ) was the most famous Spanish composer of the Renaissance. He stands with Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina and Orlande de Lassus as among the principal composers of the late Renaissance, and was &quot;admired above all for the intensity of some of his motets and of his Offices for the Dead and for Holy Week&quot;. His surviving &quot;oeuvre&quot;, unlike that of his colleagues, is almost exclusively sacred and polyphonic vocal music, set to Latin texts. As a Catholic priest, as well as an accomplished organist and singer, his career spanned both Spain and Italy. However, he preferred the life of a composer to that of a performer.

==Life and career==

Family background and early years

Tomás Luis de Victoria was born around 1548, most likely in Ávila, the main residence of his family at the time. Victoria’s birthplace has been the subject of debate, and remains unclear since his baptismal record has never been found. The town of Sanchidrián has been proposed as another possible birthplace, however it was only later that the Victorias would settle there, when Tomás’ eldest brother moved to Sanchidrián with his young family and widowed mother. In Tomás’ youth Sanchidrián was only the site of one of the family’s many rural landholdings.

The origins of the Luis de Victoria family on the paternal side can be traced only as far back as Tomás’ grandfather, Hernán Luis Dávila, who makes his first documented appearance in Avila during the opening years of the sixteenth century. It is important to note that the name Victoria comes from Hernán’s wife, Leonor de Vitoria. Following Spanish practice of the time, their children combined their surnames, in the order of their preference, or chose between them. The original spelling Vitoria (from the city of the same name) was to be used by all members of this family with the exception of Tomás himself, who adopted the Latinized “Victoria.” 

Hernán Luis Dávila was a prosperous cloth merchant who shrewdly invested his profits into building an expansive real estate portfolio throughout Ávila province. The Victorias lived on Calle de los Caballeros, which was then lined with wool and silk shops, across from San Juan Bautista, their parish church, and just steps away from the main market square of the city. Their house still stands, and the tombs of Tomás’ parents and grandparents are at San Juan. 

Victoria was the seventh of nine children born to Francisco Luis de Vitoria and Francisca Suárez de la Concha. His mother&#x27;s family were affluent wool merchants and bankers of Jewish origin, based in Segovia. Francisca&#x27;s great-grandfather, Jacob Galfón, briefly took his family to Portugal following the expulsion of the Jews, but returned to Segovia with royal authorization late in 1492, converting to Christianity and taking the name Pedro Suárez de la Concha. The Suárez de la Concha family were elevated to the aristocracy, eventually acquiring the title Marqués de Lozoya. 

Francisco, Tomás’ father, had a lucrative business as a notary in Ávila, and also derived substantial income from rents on the family landholdings and from moneylending; however, he was prone to gambling, which resulted in a decline in the family fortune. As a result of this, upon Francisco’s death his eldest son Hernán sold the family home in Ávila and moved to their estate in Sanchidrián. This was only a temporary setback, and the Victorias would soon regain their footing, becoming more involved in banking, in association with their Suárez de la Concha cousins and others based in Castile’s financial capital of the time, Medina del Campo. Significantly, during this time of financial insecurity Hernán would break with conventional practice and share his inheritance, ensuring that his siblings received educations and dowries. In Tomás’ case this made possible, along with the support of their uncle the priest Juan Luis de Vitoria, his early music training at Ávila’s cathedral school. 

Education and career

After his father&#x27;s death in 1557, his uncle, Juan Luis, became Tomás&#x27; guardian. He was a choirboy in Ávila Cathedral. Cathedral records state that his uncle, Juan Luis, presented Victoria&#x27;s Liber Primus to the Church while reminding them that Victoria had been brought up in the Ávila Cathedral. Because he was such an accomplished organist, many believe that he began studying the keyboard at an early age from a teacher in Ávila. Victoria most likely began studying &quot;the classics&quot; at St. Giles&#x27;s, a boys&#x27; school in Ávila. This school was praised by St.Teresa of Avila and some highly regarded people of music.

After receiving a grant from Philip II in 1565, Victoria went to Rome and became cantor at the German College founded by St. Ignatius Loyola. He may have studied with Palestrina around this time, though the evidence is circumstantial; certainly he was influenced by the Italian&#x27;s style. For some time, beginning in 1573, Victoria held two positions, one being at the German College and the other being at the Pontifical Roman Seminary. He held the positions of chapelmaster and instructor of plainsong. In 1571, he was hired at the German College as a teacher and began earning his first steady income. After Palestrina left the Seminary, Victoria took over the position of maestro. Victoria was ordained a priest in 1574 by bishop Thomas Goldwell. Before this he was made a deacon, but did not serve long in that capacity as typically deacons became priests soon after. In 1575, Victoria was appointed Maestro di Capella at S. Apollinare. Church officials would often ask Victoria for his opinion on appointments to cathedral positions because of his fame and knowledge. He was faithful to his position as convent organist even after his professional debut as an organist. He did not stay in Italy, however.

In 1587 Philip II honoured Victoria&#x27;s desire to return to his native Spain, naming him chaplain to his sister, the Dowager Empress María, daughter of Charles V, who had been living in retirement with her daughter Princess Margarita at the Monasterio de las Descalzas de St. Clara at Madrid from 1581. In 1591, Victoria became a godfather to his brother Juan Luis&#x27;s daughter, Isabel de Victoria. Victoria worked for 24 years at Descalzas Reales, serving for 17 years as chaplain to the Empress until her death, and then as convent organist. Victoria was also being paid much more at the Descalzas Reales than he would have earned as a cathedral chapelmaster, receiving an annual income from absentee benefices from 1587 to 1611. When the Empress Maria died in 1603, she willed three chaplaincies in the convent, with one going to Victoria. According to Victoria, he never accepted any extra pay for being a chapelmaster, and became the organist rather than the chapelmaster. Such was the esteem in which he was held that his contract allowed him frequent travel away from the convent. He was able to visit Rome in 1593 for two years, attending Palestrina&#x27;s funeral in 1594. He died in 1611 in the chaplain&#x27;s residence and was buried at the convent, although his tomb has yet to be identified.

==Music==

Victoria is the most significant composer of the Counter-Reformation in Spain, and one of the best-regarded composers of sacred music in the late Renaissance, a genre to which he devoted himself exclusively. Victoria&#x27;s music reflected his personality, expressing the passion of Spanish mysticism and religion. Victoria was praised by Padre Martini for his melodic phrases and his joyful inventions. His works have undergone a revival in the 20th century, with numerous recent recordings. Many commentators hear in his music a mystical intensity and direct emotional appeal, qualities considered by some to be lacking in the arguably more rhythmically and harmonically placid music of Palestrina. There are quite a few differences in their compositional styles, such as treatment of melody and quarter-note dissonances.

Victoria was a master at overlapping and dividing choirs with multiple parts with a gradual decreasing of rhythmic distance throughout. Not only does Victoria incorporate intricate parts for the voices, but the organ is almost treated like a soloist in many of his choral pieces. Victoria did not originate the development of psalm settings or antiphons for two choirs, but he continued and increased the popularity of such repertoire. Victoria republished works that had appeared previously, and incorporated revisions into each reissue.

Victoria published his first book of motets in 1572. In 1585 he wrote his &quot;Officium Hebdomadae Sanctae&quot;, a collection which included 37 pieces that are part of the Holy Week celebrations in the Catholic liturgy, including the eighteen motets of the &quot;Tenebrae Responsories&quot;.

Two influences in Victoria&#x27;s life were Giovanni Maria Nanino and Luca Marenzio, whom Victoria admired for their work in madrigals rather than church music. It has been speculated that Victoria took lessons from Escobedo at an early age before moving to Rome.

Victoria claimed that he composed his most creative works under his patron Otto, Cardinal von Truchsess. However, Stevenson does not believe that he learned everything about music under Cardinal Truchsess&#x27;s patronage. During the years that Victoria was devoted to Philip II of Spain, he expressed exhaustion from his compositional work. Most of the compositions that Victoria wrote that were dedicated to Cardinal Michele Bonelli, Philip II of Spain, or Pope Gregory XIII were not compensated properly.

Stylistically, his music shuns the elaborate counterpoint of many of his contemporaries, preferring simple line and homophonic textures, yet seeking rhythmic variety and sometimes including intense and surprising contrasts. His melodic writing and use of dissonance is more free than that of Palestrina; occasionally he uses intervals which are prohibited in the strict application of 16th century counterpoint, such as ascending major sixths, or even occasional diminished fourths (for example, a melodic diminished fourth occurs in a passage representing grief in his motet &quot;Sancta Maria, occurred&quot;). Victoria sometimes uses dramatic word-painting, of a kind usually found only in madrigals. Some of his sacred music uses instruments (a practice which is not uncommon in Spanish sacred music of the 16th century), and he also wrote polychoral works for more than one spatially separated group of singers, in the style of the composers of the Venetian school who were working at St. Mark&#x27;s in Venice.

His most famous work, and his masterpiece, &quot;Officium Defunctorum&quot;, is a Requiem Mass for the Empress Maria.

<text>Twycross Zoo is a medium to large zoo near Norton Juxta Twycross, Leicestershire. The zoo has the largest collection of monkeys and apes in the Western World, and in 2006 re-launched itself as &quot;Twycross Zoo – The World Primate Centre&quot;.

==History==

Twycross Zoo was established by Molly Badham and Nathalie Evans in 1963. The pair had been looking for a suitable site to expand their zoological collection, having outgrown their original site at Hints, Staffordshire where they had set up Hints Zoological Gardens in 1954. The zoo was initially based at the former rectory in the village of Norton Juxta Twycross. Having long since ceased functioning as a rectory, the house became a private residence known as Norton Grange. Badham and Evans converted the 12 acres of gardens, outbuildings, stables and farm buildings into a zoo.

The zoo first opened to the public on 26 May 1963. The opening ceremony was performed by Jean Morton, a local television personality, accompanied by her popular children&#x27;s TV puppet show characters Tingha and Tucker.

In 1972 the zoo became a charitable trust and is renowned as a specialist primate centre with a wide variety of primates including all four types of great ape, boasting the UK&#x27;s only group of bonobo. Twycross Zoo has become known for breeding primates and has recorded first UK births for thirteen species including the bonobo, siamang, agile gibbon and woolly monkey, contributing to numerous conservation breeding programmes.

In 2000, Badham and Evans co-wrote &quot;Molly&#x27;s Zoo&quot;, a book telling the story of the zoo&#x27;s history.

===Molly Badham===
Molly Badham was an expert in primates in captivity and highly regarded for her work with chimpanzees. Molly achieved many world firsts during her leadership, from breeding animals successfully through to being a founder member of the National Federation of Zoological Gardens of Great Britain and Ireland.

Badham provided chimpanzees for PG Tips tea commercials (notably Mr Shifter), and one of the zoo&#x27;s chimpanzees appeared in a Hammer Horror film with Peter Cushing. Chimpanzees were dressed up in clothes and trained to act like humans, even ride a bike. More recent management believed that the apes should not have been used in this way.

==Animal exhibits==
Twycross Zoo has around 500 animals of almost 150 species, including many endangered species. Renowned as a specialist primate zoo, it is the only zoo in the UK to exhibit all four types of great ape: gorilla, orangutan, chimpanzee and bonobo, the latter being the only bonobos in the country. The zoo currently houses 4 orangutans, 6 gorillas, 14 chimpanzees and 14 bonobos. 

Twycross Zoo has one of the largest collections of gibbons in Europe, and 37% of their animal collection is classed as near threatened, vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered by the IUCN. Many of the animals at Twycross Zoo are part of conservation breeding programmes which help ensure a future for species threatened with extinction.

The animal exhibits at Twycross Zoo are split into eight zones:

===Conservation Way=== 
Conservation Way is home to a family of critically endangered Amur leopards, the world&#x27;s rarest big cats. In June 2014, female Kristen gave birth to cubs Arina and Alexei after joining Twycross-born male Davidoff in 2013 as part of a European Association of Zoos and Aquariums breeding programme.

Endangered siamangs can also be found in Conservation Way, along with an enclosure for Chapman&#x27;s zebras and the world&#x27;s largest tortoise, the aldabra giant tortoise

In 2013, the zoo&#x27;s meerkat enclosure was renovated to give them almost double the space that they had previously. Their new enclosure boasts a tall artificial termite mound upon which the meerkats like to do &#x27;sentry duty&#x27;. Ground level windows also enable young children better views of the meerkats.

The area is also home to enclosures for several species of birds. These include silvery-cheeked hornbills and vasa parrots.

Next to this is Lorikeet landing, a large walkthrough enclosure where visitors are able to feed the Lorikeets

===Wet and Wild===
This zone is home to Humboldt penguins and Chilean flamingos. The area also used to house the Borneo longhouse aviary. The Borneo Longhouse walkthrough exhibit was opened in 2007 by actor Brian Blessed and the Malaysian High Commissioner, His Excellency Datuk Abd Aziz Mohammed. The exhibit, built to replicate a traditional longhouse, provides a naturalistic environment for the birds which live there, and enables visitors to walk inside the aviary and see first-hand the importance of wetland habitats throughout the world. There are also a number of non-avian species to be found in the Wet and Wild zone including lowland tapirs, Diana Monkeys, and the miniature monkey house, housing several breeds of Tamarins. This zone is also home to michies tufted deer, tortoises, giraffes, nyala, black rhinoceros and Sumatran tigers.

===Kingdom of the Apes===
Twycross Zoo is the only zoo in the UK that is home to all four types of great ape. Kingdom of the Apes exhibits three of these, bonobos, chimpanzees and western lowland gorillas.

===Life in the Trees===
Life in the Trees exhibits a number of species of both Old and New World monkeys, including black-headed spider monkeys, brown spider monkeys and De Brazza&#x27;s monkeys to name just a few.

Twycross Zoo has one of the largest range of gibbons in Europe and these small apes can be seen in Gibbon Forest. There are currently four species of gibbon living here, including northern white-cheeked gibbons, pileated gibbons, siamangs and agile gibbons. Gibbon Forest is also home to several smaller vivariums which house different reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates.

Life in the Trees houses Bornean orangutans. In 2014, a termite mound was built in the orangutan enclosure which is used as enrichment, as the holes in the mound can be filled with various items for the orangutans to extract using tools that they prepare from branches and twigs.

===Gruffalo Discovery Land===
In 2021, the Gruffalo Discovery Land was opened. The area tells the tale of the Gruffalo and houses some of the animals mentioned in the story, such as owls and snakes. The area is also home to Butterfly Paradise.

Butterfly Paradise is a 600 m2 walk-through exhibit and was designed by Twycross Zoo staff. Visitors follow a winding path through a heavily planted setting where they can see different butterflies and witness the life cycle, from chrysalis to butterfly in the dedicated hatching cabinets. Victoria crowned pigeons and other tropical birds can also be found inside.

===Himalaya===
The free to enter Himalaya Visitor Centre was opened in 2010 and is the entrance to the zoo. The zoo&#x27;s main gift shop and 300-seat restaurant is located here. The restaurant overlooks a Himalayan mountain scene which is the enclosure for a family of endangered snow leopards.

Twycross Zoo&#x27;s conference facilities are also found here, with the 100-capacity windows on the Wild Conference room. Windows on the Wild is used regularly for both corporate and social functions.

===Nature Reserve===
Twycross Zoo has its very own Nature Reserve which is free to enter. This large reserve provides a safe and secure home for native bats, birds, insects and small mammals.

==Education==
Twycross Zoo is home to an award-winning education department. Amongst others, the zoo holds the Learning Outside the Classroom Quality Badge, all sessions are curriculum linked and all are designed to best engage all age groups.

The zoo teaches over 15,000 school children per year in their Study Centre.

==Conservation and breeding==
In 2006 Twycross Zoo established the Conservation Welfare Fund to make a positive contribution to animal conservation and improve animal welfare worldwide.

Since its creation it has contributed to over 55 conservation and welfare projects from 27 countries around the world. As well as financial support Twycross Zoo provides expertise in animal and veterinary care, enclosure construction and design and behavioural welfare.

Twycross Zoo currently supports the following conservation projects: 
* Fauna and Flora International for their Cao Vit Gibbon Project 
* Ape Action Africa to support the work of the ape sanctuary in Cameroon
* Wildlife Vets International for work with Amur leopards in the Russian Far East
* Friends of Bonobos with continued support for the world&#x27;s only bonobo sanctuary: Lola ya Bonobo
* The Association Européenne pour l’Etude et la Conservation des Lémuriens (AEECL) for research, community and conservation work on Madagascar&#x27;s endangered lemur habitat
* Awely for their community education team the Greencaps working in bonobo territory in the Congo

In February 2014 Twycross Zoo partnered with the United Nations Great Ape Survival Partnership to assist them in their goal to ensure the long-term survival of great apes and their habitat in Africa and Asia.

Twycross Zoo is a member of BIAZA (British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums), EAZA (European Association of Zoos and Aquariums) and WAZA (World Association of Zoos and Aquariums) and members of staff chair, advise and are members of a number of specialist committees within the international zoo framework. 
In June 2014, two critically endangered Amur leopard cubs were born. The father, Davidoff, was one of two Amur cubs born at the zoo in 2006.

In October 2014, a baby vicuña (a member of the camel family) was born at the zoo.

In July 2024, a pair of critically endangered red-fronted macaws were moved to the zoo with the hope that they will breed.

==Allowing re-introduction of hybrid tiger controversy==
Tara, a hand-reared supposedly Bengal tigress acquired from Twycross Zoo in July 1976, was trained by Billy Arjan Singh and reintroduced to the wild in Dudhwa National Park, India with the permission of India&#x27;s then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, in an attempt to prove the experts wrong that zoo-bred hand-reared tigers could never be released in the wild with success. In the 1990s, some tigers from Dhudhwa were observed which had the typical appearance of Siberian tigers: white complexion, pale fur, large head and wide stripes. With recent advances in science it was subsequently found that Siberian tigers&#x27; genes had polluted the otherwise pure Bengal tiger gene pool of Dudhwa National Park. It was proved later that Twycross Zoo had been irresponsible and maintained no breeding records, and had given India a hybrid Siberian-Bengal tigress instead, although at the time, and taking into account information received regarding all of the tigers kept at Twycross Zoo, it was believed that Tara was a pure Bengal tiger at that time. Dudhwa tigers constitute about 1% of India&#x27;s total wild population, but the possibility exists of this genetic pollution spreading to other tiger groups; at its worst, this could jeopardize the Bengal tiger as a distinct subspecies.

With the advent of co-ordinated breeding programmes for numerous species help in captivity and standardised electronic animal record keeping systems (ARKS), it is now possible to track the different subspecies that are managed and ensure that these are managed as pure subspecies. Twycross Zoo is now recognised as having a database of the animals in its care, both current and historically, that is comparable to any major zoological garden worldwide.

<doc id="349645" wikidata="Q1501641" url="?curid=349645" title="Saga (band)">
<text>Saga is a Canadian rock band from Oakville, Ontario. Bassist and keyboardist Jim Crichton and Welsh-born vocalist and keyboardist Michael Sadler are the principal songwriters.

Saga has had numerous line-up changes over the years. Ian and Jim Crichton were the only two original members who appeared on every album. Sadler appeared on every release, apart from the 2009 album &quot;The Human Condition&quot;. Keyboardist Jim Gilmour was with the band from 1979, making his debut on the album &quot;Silent Knight&quot;. Drummer Steve Negus performed with Saga until 1986. The lineup was supplemented by many session musicians and live performers from the late 1980s to the late 2000s.

Saga has been awarded gold and platinum albums worldwide and have sold more than eight million albums.

==History==
Originally known as Pockets, Saga formed in 1977 from the nucleus of Canadian rock band Fludd. In April 1978, they released their self-titled debut album &quot;Saga&quot;. A modest success in Canada, it would eventually sell over 30,000 copies in Germany as an import.

Their 1979 follow-up album &quot;Images at Twilight&quot; gave them their first charting single in Canada, with the song &quot;It&#x27;s Time&quot; peaking at No. 84 in the Canadian Charts. From the album, the songs &quot;See Them Smile&quot; and &quot;Slow Motion&quot; became strong radio favourites elsewhere. Saga&#x27;s third album, &quot;Silent Knight,&quot; was released in 1980, and included the singles &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Late&quot; and &quot;Careful Where You Step,&quot; which continued and furthered the band&#x27;s international success.

In 1981, the band&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; was released. The lead single, &quot;On the Loose&quot;, finally broke them into the Top 40, peaking at No. 22 on the Canadian Charts in January 1982, and in December 1982, proved to be their breakthrough in America where it peaked at No. 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in February 1983. A second single, &quot;Wind Him Up&quot;, also fared well, with the help of its music video receiving heavy rotation on MTV, and became their next charting single in America, peaking at No. 64 on Billboard in May 1983. Eventually, &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; was certified Gold in the US in 1983. The band opened for Jethro Tull on their North American tour in 1982.

Following on the success of &quot;Worlds Apart&quot;, the band won the 1982 Juno Award for &quot;Most Promising Group of the Year.&quot;

A fifth album &quot;Heads or Tales&quot; was released in late 1983 and became another success. The lead single, &quot;The Flyer&quot;, fared well in Canada and also became their final U.S. charting single, peaking at No. 79 on Billboard in December 1983. The follow-up single entitled &quot;Scratching the Surface&quot; became popular in Canada, peaking at No. 45 in April 1984.

Their sixth album, &quot;Behaviour&quot;, was released in 1985 and included the singles, &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot; and &quot;What Do I Know?&quot; (charted No. 57 in Canada).

===Separation and reunion===
In 1986 Steve Negus and Jim Gilmour left the band over management concerns, soon deciding to form a new band project under the name &quot;Gilmour-Negus Project&quot; (GNP). In 1988, they released their one and only album, &quot;Safety Zone&quot; (featuring Robert Bevan on lead vocals). Meanwhile, Saga continued to record and tour, with Michael Sadler and the Crichton brothers augmented by session musicians.

Their 1987 release &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; enjoyed better distribution under new label, Atlantic Records, but it failed to match expectations in America. The lead single &quot;Only Time Will Tell&quot; became a popular chart favourite in Canada (No. 93), with a memorable video rotated on MTV for a brief period. However, the remainder of the album suffered from over-reliance on technology, with armies of sequencers and drum machines replacing much of the band&#x27;s earlier trademark sound with Gilmour and Negus.

For 1989&#x27;s &quot;The Beginner&#x27;s Guide to Throwing Shapes&quot;, Saga refocused on their earlier European popularity which marked a return to their earlier progressive style with a few sci-fi orientated pop elements to it. In 1992, Steve Negus and Jim Gilmour returned to Saga. The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Security of Illusion&quot;, released in 1993, was well received by Saga fans in Canada and Europe. The 1994 followup, &quot;Steel Umbrellas&quot;, was considered uneven when compared to their previous release, perhaps due to the material originally being produced for the short-lived television series &quot;Cobra&quot;. However, despite lackluster album sales, Saga&#x27;s 1993 and 1994 tours helped maintain some of the band&#x27;s early popularity; their reputation as live performers was not lost among the band&#x27;s long time fans.

===Comeback===
In 1995 Jim Crichton composed and produced the majority of Saga&#x27;s next album, the conceptual &quot;Generation 13&quot;. Inspired by a popular political treatise by the same name, the story follows main character Jeremy&#x27;s troubled search for his real father. The concept is somewhat reminiscent of the storyline in The Who&#x27;s &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;. The album&#x27;s heavier compositions have a sound similar to fellow Canadians, progressive rock band Rush, and even early Kansas.

Saga&#x27;s next release, &quot;Pleasure and the Pain&quot; was released on the eve of their 20th anniversary tour in 1997. The album failed to maintain the interest created by the previous release. On the same anniversary tour, the album &quot;Phase 1&quot; was released. &quot;Phase 1&quot; was an album containing demo songs from the 1979 album &quot;Images at Twilight&quot; — some of them were songs found not good enough for the album, some of them were different versions of songs released on &quot;Images&quot;. The album quickly sold out and a second issue was printed. The album was hard to get and it soon became a most wanted item for Saga collectors and fans.

Their 1998 tour was captured on the next album, &quot;Detours&quot;, a double-live album released worldwide. Saga&#x27;s next three albums, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Full Circle&quot;, 2001&#x27;s &quot;House of Cards&quot;, and 2003&#x27;s &quot;Marathon&quot; have all been popular with the band&#x27;s longtime and loyal fanbase. &quot;House of Cards&quot;, in particular enjoyed renewed interest. Its acoustic-flavoured single, &quot;Money Talks&quot;, received Top 5 video airplay in Canada. All three albums included new &quot;chapters&quot;, representing a return to the progressive rock of the band&#x27;s early days. Saga released a new studio album, &quot;Network&quot;, in the fall of 2004. Their next album, &quot;Trust&quot;, was released in 2006, featuring Brian Doerner as their new drummer. Doerner made his debut on a live Canadian television broadcast in late 2005.
Even though Jim Crichton and Michael Sadler both live in Los Angeles, they have not committed Saga to any full-length American tours since 1986. However, in late 2005, Michael Sadler announced a limited tour on the West Coast to promote his solo album, &quot;Clear&quot;. The trek featured Ian Crichton as touring guitarist. Saga also played one show in New York City during their summer 2006 tour in support of &quot;Trust&quot;.

===&quot;The Chapters&quot;===
&quot;The Chapters&quot; is the name given to a series of songs that the band revealed over a 28-year period in a mixed-up order, creating a conceptual puzzle. Each song in the sequence was subtitled &quot;Chapter One&quot;, &quot;Chapter Two&quot;, etc. In its final form, &quot;The Chapters&quot; tells a cohesive science fiction story concerning the preservation of Albert Einstein&#x27;s brain, aliens who are concerned with humanity&#x27;s self-destruction, and the resurrection of the dead through technology.

The first eight &quot;Chapters&quot; were issued, out of order, across the band&#x27;s first four albums, issued between 1978 and 1981. After a long layoff, Chapters 9 through 16 were issued, again out of order, across three album releases between 1999 and 2003. Songs from the cycle have been performed in concert throughout their career. The Chapters were finally released all together in a 2 CD live recording called &quot;The Chapters Live&quot; in 2005.

===Legacy and recent activity===
Despite the band&#x27;s fluctuating musical styles and limited commercial success in the United States, their fans have remained extremely loyal over the decades. Their musical style was defined by Ian Crichton&#x27;s staccato guitar riffs, often in harmony with a synthesizer, and complex keyboard arrangements, frequently featuring three players.

The band has been constantly successful in Germany since its inception. It is also very popular in Puerto Rico; Saga has visited the island twelve times. Saga&#x27;s second concert in Puerto Rico (1981) caused riots from fans trying to crash into a sold-out concert that sold over 10,000 tickets. Most of the inner cover photographs from the original vinyl release of &quot;In Transit&quot; (1982) were taken in Puerto Rico, including a live photograph from the 1981 concert. For a few years, a keyboard riff from their song &quot;No Regrets&quot; became the background music for station breaks at WCAD-FM in San Juan. The band received formal recognition as distinguished visitors from the Puerto Rican legislature in February 2005. Their concert on December 9, 2007 (at the Pier 10 Arena club in Old San Juan) was the last concert that Michael Sadler did with Saga until his announcement of returning to the band in January 2011.

On January 16, 2007 it was announced by InsideOut, the band&#x27;s current record label, that lead singer Michael Sadler would be leaving Saga for personal reasons at the end of 2007. Later that year on Michael&#x27;s personal site, michaelsadler.com, a note was posted by the singer revealing that his departure was due to a desire to focus on his family life and retire from the stress of being in an active travelling band. A farewell tour of sorts was in the works which also commemorated Saga&#x27;s 36th anniversary as a band. Saga announced on July 15, 2007 that they were recording a new album in Los Angeles. Titled &quot;10,000 Days&quot; the album was released on November 6, 2007 in conjunction with their planned European tour. (&quot;10,000 days&quot; equates to 27 years, 4.54 months, approximately the amount of time Sadler spent with the band). Sadler also recorded a forthcoming DVD commemorating his last European tour with Saga. Just prior to the release of &quot;10,000 Days&quot;, in October 2007 drummer Brian Doerner suffered a heart attack. He has since made a full recovery, but a stand-in drummer (Chris Sutherland) of the Kim Mitchell Band was required to fulfill touring commitments.

Saga announced they were auditioning lead vocalists to continue the band&#x27;s career. The musicians recorded instrumental versions of &quot;On the Loose&quot; and &quot;Wind Him Up&quot; for prospective singers to perform on YouTube, with the winning candidate to be announced at a later date. During the search, Ian Crichton remarked that hopeful candidates &quot;should have a set of pipes&quot; as well as personality. The guitarist also remarked that a Canadian would be preferable, presumably because of travel considerations and the band&#x27;s nationality. Over 20 candidates (including one woman) submitted demos from across the Atlantic and Caribbean.


On April 15, 2008 Saga announced that Rob Moratti of Toronto, former singer of Final Frontier, had joined the band as the new lead vocalist. Moratti&#x27;s background included more than a decade of experience in the Canadian rock music industry, recently working with the respected guitarist-producer Mladen Zaron. Throughout his tenure with the band, Moratti concentrated on lead vocals, leaving the band&#x27;s instrumental dynamics somewhat changed from the Sadler era, where the lead vocalist often doubled on bass guitar and keyboards. Saga&#x27;s first gig with Moratti took place in the summer of 2008. Also, 2008 saw the release of a book about the band&#x27;s history, &#x27;Saga: The Biography&#x27;, by renowned rock journalist (and long-time friend of Saga), Edwin Ammerlaan.

In 2009 Saga released their first CD with Rob Moratti. This CD was titled &quot;The Human Condition&quot; and was released in the spring 2009. The band toured in Europe and Canada.

On January 28, 2011 an official statement was made announcing Michael Sadler&#x27;s return as the lead singer of Saga.

On February 1, 2012 Saga announced that after 6 years of touring and recording together, Brian Doerner and Saga have parted ways. Following YouTube auditions, Mike Thorne (a native of Toronto ) was announced as the new drummer of Saga. On July 6, 2012, Saga&#x27;s twentieth studio album, &quot;20/20&quot;, was released. It marked the return of original vocalist Michael Sadler.

On June 27, 2014 Saga released their 21st album entitled &quot;Sagacity&quot;, which received mostly positive feedback from fans. The album quickly topped the iTunes rock lists around Europe (most notably in Germany).

A reissue campaign covering the later years (from 1989 to 2007) was announced in 2015, spanning twelve albums in twelve months. However, after five remastered albums the campaign was seemingly aborted without any official statement from the record company, the live recordings intended for the series instead appearing as a live album &quot;Live in Hamburg 2015&quot;, which is strictly limited to 5000 copies worldwide.

In January 2017 Michael Sadler announced Saga&#x27;s retirement following the completion of their farewell tour dubbed The Final Chapter Tour, which also marked their 40th anniversary. He also said that a &quot;very special one-off performance&quot; would take place on the 2018 edition of &quot;Cruise to the Edge&quot; in February 2018.

On August 5, 2018 bassist and co-founder Jim Crichton departed the band before the final two shows, and was replaced by new member Dusty Chesterfield. The tour spawned the live release &quot;So Good So Far – Live at Rock of Ages&quot;, which was released on September 28, 2018.

After reconsideration from the request by the fans, Saga opted to continue with their live performances.

In early 2020, the band performed in Germany and Scandinavia as part of their Out of the Shadows World Tour.

Following the completion of the tour, the band members entered their respective home studios during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns to record an acoustic album titled &quot;Symmetry&quot;, which was released on March 12, 2021. The first single &quot;Tired World&quot; was made available for streaming, followed by &quot;Wind Him Up&quot; and &quot;Always There&quot;. For the latter, the fans were asked to send in video material, which was then assembled into a video clip. Although Jim Crichton had quit touring with the band, he was strongly involved with &quot;Symmetry&quot;, playing bass and supervising the new arrangements.

<text>In chemistry, electro-osmotic flow (EOF, hyphen optional; synonymous with electro-osmosis or electro-endosmosis) is the motion of liquid induced by an applied potential across a porous material, capillary tube, membrane, microchannel, or any other fluid conduit. Because electro-osmotic velocities are independent of conduit size, as long as the electrical double layer is much smaller than the characteristic length scale of the channel, electro-osmotic flow will have little effect. Electro-osmotic flow is most significant when in small channels, and is an essential component in chemical separation techniques, notably capillary electrophoresis. Electro-osmotic flow can occur in natural unfiltered water, as well as buffered solutions.

==History==

Electro-osmotic flow was first reported in 1807 by Ferdinand Friedrich Reuss (18 February 1778 (Tübingen, Germany) – 14 April 1852 (Stuttgart, Germany)) in an unpublished lecture before the Physical-Medical Society of Moscow; Reuss first published an account of electro-osmotic flow in 1809 in the &quot;Memoirs of the Imperial Society of Naturalists of Moscow&quot;. He showed that water could be made to flow through a plug of clay by applying an electric voltage. Clay is composed of closely packed particles of silica and other minerals, and water flows through the narrow spaces between these particles just as it would through a narrow glass tube. Any combination of an electrolyte (a fluid containing dissolved ions) and an insulating solid would generate electro-osmotic flow, though for water/silica the effect is particularly large. Even so, flow speeds are typically only a few millimeters per second.

Electro-osmosis was discovered independently in 1814 by the English chemist Robert Porrett Jr. (1783–1868).

==Cause==

Electroosmotic flow is caused by the Coulomb force induced by an electric field on net mobile electric charge in a solution. Because the chemical equilibrium between a solid surface and an electrolyte solution typically leads to the interface acquiring a net fixed electrical charge, a layer of mobile ions, known as an electrical double layer or Debye layer, forms in the region near the interface. When an electric field is applied to the fluid (usually via electrodes placed at inlets and outlets), the net charge in the electrical double layer is induced to move by the resulting Coulomb force. The resulting flow is termed electroosmotic flow.

==Description==
The resulting flow from applying a voltage is a plug flow. Unlike a parabolic profile flow generated from a pressure differential, a plug flow’s velocity profile is approximately planar, with slight variation near the electric double layer. This offers significantly less deleterious dispersive effects and can be controlled without valves, offering a high-performance method for fluid separation, although many complex factors prove this control to be difficult. Because of difficulties measuring and monitoring flow in microfluidic channels, primarily disrupting the flow pattern, most analysis is done through numerical methods and simulation.

Electroosmotic flow through microchannels can be modeled after the Navier-Stokes equation with the driving force deriving from the electric field and the pressure differential. Thus it is governed by the continuity equation

:formula_1

and momentum

:formula_2

where is the velocity vector, is the density of the fluid, formula_3 is the material derivative, is the viscosity of the fluid, is the electric charge density, is the applied electric field, is the electric field due to the zeta potential at the walls and is the fluid pressure.

Laplace’s equation can describe the external electric field

:formula_4

while the potential within the electric double layer is governed by

:formula_5

where is the dielectric constant of the electrolyte solution and is the vacuum permittivity. This equation can be further simplified using the Debye-Hückel approximation

:formula_6

where is the Debye length, used to describe the characteristic thickness of the electric double layer. The equations for potential field within the double layer can be combined as

:formula_7

The transport of ions in space can be modeled using the Nernst–Planck equation:

:formula_8

Where formula_9 is the ion concentration, formula_10 is the magnetic vector potential, formula_11 is the diffusivity of the chemical species, formula_12 is the valence of ionic species, formula_13 is the elementary charge, formula_14 is the Boltzmann constant, and formula_15 is the absolute temperature.

==Applications==
Electro-osmotic flow is commonly used in microfluidic devices, soil analysis and processing, and chemical analysis, all of which routinely involve systems with highly charged surfaces, often of oxides. One example is capillary electrophoresis, in which electric fields are used to separate chemicals according to their electrophoretic mobility by applying an electric field to a narrow capillary, usually made of silica. In electrophoretic separations, the electroosmotic flow affects the elution time of the analytes.

Electro-osmotic flow is actuated in a FlowFET to electronically control fluid flow through a junction.

It is projected that micro fluidic devices utilizing electroosmotic flow will have applications in medical research. Once controlling this flow is better understood and implemented, the ability to separate fluids on the atomic level will be a vital component for drug dischargers. Mixing fluids at the micro scale is currently troublesome. It is believed that electrically controlling fluids will be the method in which small fluids are mixed.

A controversial use of electro-osmotic systems is the control rising damp in the walls of buildings. While there is little evidence to suggest that these systems can be useful in moving salts in walls, such systems are claimed to be especially effective in structures with very thick walls.
However some claim that there is no scientific base for those systems, and cite several examples for their failure.

Electro-osmosis can also be used for self-pumping pores powered by chemical reactions rather than electric fields. This approach, using , has been demonstrated and modeled with the Nernst-Planck-Stokes equations.

=== Physics ===
In fuel cells, electro-osmosis causes protons moving through a proton exchange membrane (PEM) to drag water molecules from one side (anode) to the other (cathode).

=== Vascular plant biology ===
In vascular plant biology, electro-osmosis is also used as an alternative or supplemental explanation for the movement of polar liquids via the phloem that differs from the cohesion-tension theory supplied in the mass flow hypothesis and others, such as cytoplasmic streaming. Companion cells are involved in the &quot;cyclic&quot; withdrawal of ions (K+) from sieve tubes, and their secretion parallel to their position of withdrawal between sieve plates, resulting in polarisation of sieve plate elements alongside potential difference in pressure, and results in polar water molecules and other solutes present moved upward through the phloem.

In 2003, St Petersburg University graduates applied direct electric current to 10 mm segments of mesocotyls of maize seedlings alongside one-year linden shoots; electrolyte solutions present in the tissues moved toward the cathode that was in place, suggesting that electro-osmosis might play a role in solution transport through conductive plant tissues.

==Disadvantages==
Maintaining an electric field in an electrolyte requires Faradaic reactions to occur at the anode and cathode. This is typically electrolysis of water, which generates hydrogen peroxide, hydrogen ions (acid) and hydroxide (base) as well as oxygen and hydrogen gas bubbles. The hydrogen peroxide and/or pH changes generated can adversely affect biological cells and biomolecules such as proteins, while gas bubbles tend to &quot;clog&quot; microfluidic systems. These problems can be alleviated by using alternative electrode materials such as conjugated polymers which can undergo the Faradaic reactions themselves, dramatically reducing electrolysis.

<text>Val-d&#x27;Isère (, literally &quot;Valley of Isère&quot;) is a commune of the Tarentaise Valley, in the Savoie department (Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region) in southeastern France. It lies from the border with Italy. It is on the border of the Vanoise National Park created in 1963, with good transport links in and out of Lyon, Geneva and Chambéry.

During the Albertville 1992 Winter Olympics, the &quot;Face de Bellevarde&quot; was the site of the men&#x27;s downhill race. Other alpine skiing events held during those games included men&#x27;s giant slalom and alpine combined. Val d&#x27;Isère regularly hosts World Cup alpine events, usually for the men in early December, and hosted the World Championships in 2009. The ski area of Val d&#x27;Isère and Tignes forms the Espace Killy, named after the triple Olympic champion Jean-Claude Killy who grew up in Val d&#x27;Isère. There are two mountain huts (called “refuges” in French) owned by the Vanoise National Park on the territory of Val d&#x27;Isère: le Refuge du Prariond and le Refuge du Fond des Fours.

==Skiing and snowsports==

The western and central areas of Val d&#x27;Isère are most recognizable by their &quot;chalet&quot; architecture, while in the eastern part of the town high-rise architecture dominates the landscape. Along with nearby Tignes the area forms part of the &quot;l&#x27; Espace Killy&quot;, the self-titled &quot;Most Beautiful Ski Area in the World&quot;.

The Pissaillas Glacier offers summer skiing, as well as the usual winter fare. Snow cannon are placed on certain slopes to accommodate heavy skiing. The ski slopes themselves are equipped with a high-volume gondola, able to transport standing skiers, the funicular &quot;Funival&quot; from La Daille via a tunnel to the top of Bellevarde, traditional chair lifts—some with windshields and many detachable, button/disc-pulls and tow-ropes. There are both groomed slopes and backcountry (off-piste) skiing. The slopes&#x27; difficulty levels are particularly high. However, as in Tignes, there are wide, easily navigable pistes for those of the beginner-intermediate level as well. Val d&#x27;Isère is renowned as having some of the world&#x27;s best lift-accessed off-piste and has many independent instructors and guides who specialise in off-piste tuition and guiding.

Tignes possesses more of the same, with a funicular shuttling skiers up through one of the mountains to the Grande Motte glacier. A free shuttle bus runs between the villages in the valley, providing free transport throughout the towns of Val d&#x27;Isère and La Daille.

==History==
Human habitation of the valley dates back to before Roman times with traces of Celtic tribes found in the area. The town received parish rights in 1637 and the parish church, which is still a landmark in the town centre, was built in 1664.
Val-d&#x27;Isere was part of the historical land of Savoy emerged as the feudal territory of the House of Savoy during the 11th to 14th centuries. The historical territory is shared between the modern countries of France, Italy, and Switzerland.
The House of Savoy became the longest surviving royal house in Europe. It ruled the County of Savoy to 1416 and then the Duchy of Savoy from 1416 to 1860.
Skiing in Val d&#x27;Isère has its roots in the 1930s when a drag lift was built on the slopes of the Solaise. This was followed by an aerial tramway (cable car). During WWII, the village secretly housed Jewish children; the former mayor of the village, Dr. Frederic Petri, sheltered a young woman in his chalet and nursed her broken leg.

==Geography==
===Climate===

Val-d&#x27;Isère has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;). The average annual temperature in Val-d&#x27;Isère is . The average annual rainfall is with December as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in July, at around , and lowest in January, at around . The highest temperature ever recorded in Val-d&#x27;Isère was on 27 June 2019; the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 31 December 2000.

==Tarentaise Valley skiing==
The Tarentaise Valley has the largest concentration of world-class ski resorts in the world. Most well known neighbour systems are Paradiski (Les Arcs, La Plagne) and Les Trois Vallées (Courchevel, Méribel, Val Thorens and more). There were once plans to interlink all systems and resorts to create what would have been by far the largest ski area in the world. However, that vision was ended with the creation of the Vanoise National Park.


== Olympic Games, World Cup and World Championships ==

The resort hosts every year a round of the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup for both men and women. The men&#x27;s downhill, super-G and giant slalom of the 1992 Albertville Olympic Winter Games were held on the &quot;Face de Bellevarde&quot; in Val d&#x27;Isère. The FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 2009 were also held in Val d&#x27;Isère.

==Tour de France==
The resort was the start of Stage 9 to Briançon in the 2007 Tour de France. The 2019 Tour de France passed through Val d&#x27;Isère on 26 July, on their way to Tignes, descending the Col de l&#x27;Iseran. Due to unexpected bad weather – a hailstorm resulting in landslides on the road along the ‘Lac du Chevril&#x27; – the organisation of the Tour had to cancel the stage passed the Col de l&#x27;Iseran. The cyclists stopped in the village of the Val d&#x27;Isère.

==GEM Altigliss Challenge==
Val d&#x27;Isère is the location of the annual winter sporting event GEM Altigliss Challenge which is organised by Grenoble School of Management. Each February over 1000 students from 30 Grandes écoles of France participate in the week-long skiing and snowboarding event which takes place in Val d&#x27;Isère.

==Popular culture==
When the characters Edina and Patsy in the British sitcom, &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; tried to go skiing, they chose Val d&#x27;Isère.

Although the movie &quot;Les Bronzés font du ski&quot; (&quot;French Fried Vacation 2&quot;) has been a great success in France, only a few people are aware that it was shot in Val d&#x27;Isère.

In 1994, a video game named after the resort, &quot;Val d&#x27;Isere Championship&quot; was released for the Super NES, after it was featured in an episode of &quot;GamesMaster&quot;. Another game called &quot;Val d&#x27;Isère Skiing and Snowboarding&quot; was released for the Atari Jaguar in 1995.

Val d&#x27;Isère has referenced in the film adaptation of &quot;Me Before You&quot;, having been changed from Courchevel.

<doc id="349657" wikidata="Q982263" url="?curid=349657" title="Craig Adams (ice hockey)">
<text>Craig Douglas Adams (born April 26, 1977) is a Bruneian-born Canadian former professional ice hockey player, who most recently played with the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League. Adams was born in Seria, Brunei, but was raised in Calgary, Alberta, residing and playing hockey in the community of Lake Bonavista. Adams is a two-time Stanley Cup winner, winning with the Carolina Hurricanes in 2006 and the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2009.

== Playing career ==

=== Amateur ===
Adams was selected in the 9th round, 223rd overall, in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft by the Hartford Whalers where he gained the distinction of being their last draft pick. Adams was drafted after his freshman season at Harvard University. He suffered a season-ending shoulder injury on December 27, 1997 in a game against the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

=== Carolina Hurricanes ===
During the 2000–01 season, Adams would make his NHL debut on October 24, 2000 in a 3-2 loss against the San Jose Sharks with the Carolina Hurricanes, who had relocated from Hartford since drafting him. On November 10, 2000, Adams would score his first NHL goal and point against goaltender Glenn Healy in a 3-1 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs. This goal would be the only point he would get the entire season, playing in a total of 44 games.

During the 2001-02 season, Adams would split time between the Carolina Hurricanes and their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate the Lowell Lock Monsters. In the NHL, Adams would, for the second season in a row, finish the season with a single point.

In the following two seasons however, Adams would find his footing, finishing the seasons with 18 and 17 points respectively. During the 2004-05 NHL lockout, Adams would sign with the Milano Vipers in Italy, where he would score 29 points in 30 games in the regular season before scoring 11 points in 15 games in the postseason, helping the Milano Vipers win the championship.

On August 25, 2005 he signed a contract with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, but was traded back to the Hurricanes on October 3, a few days before the 2005–06 NHL season began. Adams would once again split time between the Hurricanes and the Lowell Lock Monsters. The Carolina Hurricanes would make the playoffs, defeating the Montreal Canadiens, New Jersey Devils, and Buffalo Sabres to secure their spot in the Stanley Cup Finals. Carolina would face the Edmonton Oilers in a series that would go to a game 7, which the Hurricanes would win, giving Adams his first Stanley Cup victory. By winning the Stanley Cup, Adams became the first Bruneian-born player to have his name engraved on the trophy.

During the 2007-08 season, Adams would continue to struggle, only scoring 5 points in 40 games. On December 19, 2007, Adams was suspended for 2 games for high-sticking Toronto Maples Leafs player Alex Steen. Adams would play 40 games that season before being traded to the Chicago Blackhawks.

=== Chicago Blackhawks ===
On January 17, 2008 Adams was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks for a conditional pick in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. On March 4, 2008, Adams would score his first goal on the Chicago Blackhawks in a 4-2 victory over the Minnesota Wild. On March 4, 2009, the Pittsburgh Penguins claimed Adams off of waivers when the Blackhawks attempted to send him to the AHL.

=== Pittsburgh Penguins ===
After only playing 9 games in the regular season for the Penguins, Adams would play in 24 games in the playoffs, where he would help Pittsburgh win the Stanley Cup against the Detroit Red Wings, giving Adams his second Stanley Cup win. On June 29, 2009, Adams was re-signed by the Penguins to a two-year contract.

On June 9, 2011, Adams was re-signed by the Penguins to another two-year contract.

On July 5, 2013, Adams was re-signed again to a two-year contract. At the beginning of the 2013–14 season, on October 3, 2013, Adams scored the 50th goal of his career against Cory Schneider of the New Jersey Devils.

On April 29, 2015, after seven seasons within the organization, Adams was informed by the Pittsburgh Penguins that he would not be re-signed to another contract. On January 26, 2016, after a 14-year career, Adams announced his retirement.

==Personal==
Adams was the first NHL player to be born in Brunei. He was born in the country, as his father was an employee of Shell Oil at the time of his birth. The family settled in Calgary, Alberta shortly afterwards. He attended Strathcona Tweedsmuir School for high school.

Adams is married since 2003 to his wife Anne Cellucci, a daughter of the late Paul Cellucci, former Governor of Massachusetts and US Ambassador to Canada. They have three children.

Adams now works as a financial advisor for hockey players at Merrill Lynch in Boston. He has pledged his brain to research on the effects of CTE.

<text>The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to ants:

[[Ants]] – social insects with geniculate (elbowed) antennae and a distinctive node-like structure that forms a slender waist. Ants are of the family Formicidae and evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the mid-Cretaceous period between 110 and 130 million years ago, diversifying after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 out of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified.

<text>The Party of Democratic Action (; abbr. SDA) is a Bosniak nationalist, conservative political party in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==History==
The Party of Democratic Action (SDA) was founded on 26 May 1990 in Sarajevo, as a &quot;party of Muslim cultural-historic circle&quot;. It was a realisation of Alija Izetbegović&#x27;s idea of an Islamic religious and national party in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many members of the Islamic Community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including imams, took part in the party&#x27;s foundation. Alija, who was chosen as its chairman, tried to resolve disputes between the Muslim nationalist Islamists led by Omer Behmen and the left-wing Muslims led by Adil Zulfikarpašić. The party has its roots in the old Yugoslav Muslim Organization, a conservative Muslim party in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Yugoslav Muslim Organization was a successor of Muslimanska Narodna Organizacija (Muslim National Organization), a conservative Muslim party founded in 1906 during the Austro-Hungarian era. The Muslim National Organization was itself a successor of the conservative Muslim &quot;Movement for waqf and educational autonomy&quot; (Pokret za vakufsko-mearifsku autonomiju) that goes back to 1887.

The SDA achieved considerable success in elections after the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. It founded the newspaper &quot;Ljiljan&quot;. The party remains the strongest political party among the Bosniak population in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In November 2000, the party was defeated by the Social Democratic Party and other parties gathered into the &quot;Alliance for Change&quot;, and found itself in opposition for the first time since its creation. After the 2022 general election, the SDA became once again the largest party in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The party has branches in Slovenia, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Croatia and the Sandžak region of Serbia. One of the goals of the party, outside Bosnia and Herzegovina, is to represent and defend the interests of Bosniaks and other Muslim South Slavs in the entire Balkan region. In Montenegro, the SDA merged with smaller Bosniak and Slavic Muslim parties to create the Bosniak Party.

The party is an observer member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP).

==Ideology==
The Party of Democratic Action is the primary stronghold for right-orientated Bosniaks, especially for nationalists, and conservatives, and thus they have been described as national-conservative. The party has been also described as secularist by some researchers. Islamist and Pan-Islamist ideologies exist in the party but tends to represent itself mainly among the elite apparatus of the party. The party supports the centralization of the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On foreign stances they also tend to be atlanticist and supportive of the accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to NATO and the European Union.

<doc id="349675" wikidata="Q1068139" url="?curid=349675" title="White Revolution">
<text>The White Revolution () or the Shah and People Revolution () was a far-reaching series of reforms resulting in aggressive modernization in the Imperial State of Iran launched on 26 January 1963 by the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, which lasted until 1979. The reforms resulted in a great redistribution of wealth to Iran&#x27;s working class, explosive economic growth in subsequent decades, rapid urbanization, and deconstruction of Iran&#x27;s feudalist customs.

The reforms were characterized by high economic growth rates, major investments in infrastructure, substantial growth in per capita wealth and literacy of Iranians. The economic growth and education advancement arguably paved the way for the Shah&#x27;s military arms build-up and the establishment of Iran as a major geopolitical power in the Middle East. It consisted of several elements, including land reform, sale of some state-owned factories to finance the land reform, construction of an expanded road, rail, and air network, a number of dam and irrigation projects, the eradication of diseases such as malaria, the encouragement and support of industrial growth, enfranchisement of women, nationalization of forests and pastures, formation of literacy and health corps for rural isolated areas, and institution of profit-sharing schemes for workers in the industry. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Shah sought to develop a more independent foreign policy and established working relationships with the Soviet Union and Eastern European nations. In subsequent decades, per capita income for Iranians greatly increased, and oil revenue fueled an enormous increase in state funding for industrial development projects.

The White Revolution launched government-subsidized land grants to millions of working-class families and the creation of Iran&#x27;s Literacy corps who doubled the nation’s literacy rates. The Shah wanted all Iranian citizens to be able to live an educated and prosperous lifestyle. The bulk of the program was aimed at Iran&#x27;s peasantry while redistributing the aristocrat landlord class wealth down to working class Iranians. Thus the White Revolution in Iran represented a new attempt to introduce reform from above and preserve traditional power patterns. Through land reform, the essence of the White Revolution, the Shah hoped to ally himself with the peasantry in the countryside, and hoped to sever their ties with the aristocracy in the city.

In order to legitimize the White Revolution, the Shah called for a national referendum in early 1963 in which 5,598,711 people voted for the reforms, and 4,115 voted against the reforms, though the referendum was boycotted by the opposition to the Shah.

==Reforms==

Mohammad Reza Shah had intended it to be a non-violent regeneration of Iranian society through economic and social reforms, with the ultimate long-term aim of transforming Iran into a global economic and industrial power. The Shah introduced economic concepts such as profit-sharing for workers and initiated massive government-financed heavy industry projects, as well as the nationalization of forests and pastureland. Most important, however, were the land reform programs which saw the traditional landed elites of Iran lose much of their influence and power. Nearly 90% of Iranian sharecroppers became landowners as a result.

Socially, the platform granted women more rights and poured money into education, especially in the rural areas. A Literacy Corps was established, which allowed young men to fulfill their compulsory military service by working as village literacy teachers.

The White Revolution consisted of 19 elements that were introduced over a period of 16 years, with the first 6 introduced on January 9, 1963, and put to a national referendum on January 26, 1963:

# Land Reforms Program and Abolishing &quot;Feudalism&quot;: The government bought the land during the Iranian Land Reform from the feudal landlords at what was considered to be a fair price and sold it to the peasants at 30% below the market value, with the loan being payable over 25 years at very low interest rates. This made it possible for 1.5 million peasant families, who had once been little more than slaves, to own the lands that they had been cultivating all their lives. Given that the average size of a peasant family was 5, the land reforms program brought freedom to approximately 9 million people, or 40% of Iran&#x27;s population.
# Nationalization of Forests and Pasturelands: Many measures were introduced, not only to protect the national resources and stop the destruction of forests and pasturelands, but also to further develop and cultivate them. More than 9 million trees were planted in 26 regions, creating 70,000 acres (280 km2) of &quot;green belts&quot; around cities and on the borders of the major highways.
# Privatization of the Government Owned Enterprises, selling shares in manufacturing plants and factories to the public and the old feudal lords, thus creating a whole new class of factory owners who could now help to industrialize the country.
# Profit Sharing for industrial workers in private sector enterprises, giving the factory workers and employees 20% share of the net profits of the places where they worked and securing bonuses based on higher productivity or reductions in costs.
# Extending the Right to Vote to Women, who previously did not enjoy this right. This measure was criticized by some of the clergy.
# Formation of the Literacy Corps, so that those who had a high school diploma and were required to serve their country as soldiers could do so by fighting illiteracy in the villages. In 1963 approximately 2/3 of the population was illiterate, with 1/3 found mainly in the capital city of Tehran.
# Formation of the Health Corps to extend public health care throughout the villages and rural regions of Iran. In 3 years, almost 4,500 medical groups were trained; nearly 10 million cases were treated by the Corps.
# Formation of the Reconstruction and Development Corps to teach the villagers the modern methods and techniques of farming and keeping livestock. Agricultural production between 1964 and 1970 increased by 80% in tonnage and 67% in value.
# Formation of the Houses of Equity where 5 village elders would be elected by the villagers, for a period of 3 years, to act as arbitrators in order to help settle minor offences and disputes. By 1977 there were 10,358 Houses of Equity serving over 10 million people living in over 19,000 villages across the country.
# Nationalization of all Water Resources, introduction of projects and policies in order to conserve and benefit from Iran&#x27;s limited water resources. Many dams were constructed and five more were under construction in 1978. A result of these measures was the area of land under irrigation increased from 2 million acres (8,000 km2), in 1968, to 5.6 million in 1977.
# Urban and Rural Modernization and Reconstruction with the help of the Reconstruction and Development Corps. Building of public baths, schools and libraries; installing water pumps and power generators for running water and electricity. 
# Didactic Reforms that improved the quality of education by diversifying the curriculum in order to adapt to the necessities of life in the modern world.
# Workers&#x27; Right to Own Shares in the Industrial Complexes where they worked by turning industrial units, with 5 years history and over, into public companies, where up to 99% of the shares in the state-owned enterprises and 49% of the shares of the private companies would be offered for sale to the workers of the establishment at first and then to the general public.
# Price Stabilization and campaign against unreasonable profiteering (1975). Owners of factories and large chain stores were heavily fined, with some being imprisoned and other&#x27;s licenses being revoked. Sanctions were imposed on multi-national foreign companies and tons of merchandise stored for speculative purposes were confiscated and sold to consumers at fixed prices.
# Free and Compulsory Education and a daily free meal for all children from kindergarten to 14 years of age. Primary schools were built in hundreds of villages that previously did not have one. In 1978, 25% of Iranians were enrolled in public schools alone. In that same year there were 185,000 students of both sexes studying in Iran&#x27;s universities. In addition to the above there were over 100,000 students pursuing their studies abroad, of which 50,000 were enrolled in colleges and universities in the United States.
# Free Food for Needy Mothers and for all newborn babies up to the age of two.
# Introduction of Social Security and National Insurance for all Iranians. The National Insurance system provided for up to 100% of the wages during retirement.
# Stable and Reasonable Cost of Renting or Buying of Residential Properties (1977). Controls were placed on land prices and various forms of land speculation.
# Introduction of Measures to Fight against Corruption within the bureaucracy. The Imperial Inspection Commission was founded, consisting of representatives from administrative bodies and people of proven integrity.

==Results==
There was a minor industrial revolution during this period of reform. Port facilities were improved, the Trans-Iranian Railway was expanded, and the main roads connecting Tehran and provincial capitals were asphalted. Many small factories opened up specializing in clothing, food processing, cement, tiles, paper, and home appliances. Larger factories for textiles, machine tools, and car assembly were also opened. Educational institutions also grew after the launching of the White Revolution. Enrollment in kindergarten increased from 13,300 to 221,990, elementary schools from 1,640,000 to 4,080,000, secondary schools from 370,000 to 741,000 and colleges from 24,885 to 145,210. The new schools instituted educational policies designed to undercut clerical control over education and religious education. The Literacy Corps also helped raise the literacy rate from 26 to 42 percent. The White Revolution also included certain reforms of women&#x27;s rights. Women gained the right to vote, to run for elected office and to serve as lawyers and later judges. The marriageable age for women was also raised to fifteen.

Iran experienced explosive economic expansion with an annual economic growth rate averaging at 9.8%. There was a substantial rise in the Iranian middle class with over one million families becoming small business owners and an estimated 700,000 salaried professionals. The large economic growth was later used to fund arms built up by the Shah who spent billions on purchasing foreign weapons establishing Iran as a geopolitical power. The history of the Persian empire was taught as means to make people feel part of Iran. In the textbook for the third year of high school, for instance, the interference of the Zoroastrian clergy in politics caused the defeat of the Sasanian empire by the Muslim armies. Therefore, religious interference in political affairs was taught to be extremely dangerous.

Economically, the White Revolution was very successful. The White Revolution successfully redistributed land to approximately 2.5 million families, established literacy and health corps targeting Iran&#x27;s rural areas, and resulted in a slew of social and legal reform. In the decades following the revolution, per capita income for Iranians skyrocketed. The rapid rise in Iran&#x27;s revenues paved the way for increased state spending used to fund major industrial development projects in Iran.

== Problems and criticism ==
Land reform, which was the focus of the White Revolution, did what it was intended to do, weaken the nobles and landlords. In their place, though, emerged a new group of commercial farmers, and many previously large landowning families, such as the Pahlavi family, managed to renovate themselves into these commercial farmers. A rapid expansion of small landowners did occur, but the peasantry as a whole did not acquire land. Only roughly half of the rural population received any land, and many of the people who did receive land did not receive enough to sustain themselves. The result of the White Revolution was that the rural population could be separated into three groups: prosperous farmers, small landowners, and village laborers. The first group was the only group to really benefit from the land reforms, and this group consisted of former village headmen, bailiffs, and some former landlords. The second group consisted of sharecroppers who received no more than 10 hectares of land. Most of these people ended up trading their land in for shares in state cooperatives. The last group received no land at all, and survived as farm hands, laborers, or shepherds. Many of them migrated to urban centers for work.

In late 1978, there had been widespread dissatisfaction among Iranian farmers with regards to land reforms which were supposed to empower them. The Shah&#x27;s reforms overvalued grandiose inefficient industries over agriculture leading to a sense of negligence among the farmers. Mismanagement and corruption resulted in waste of many funds designated for agricultural development. Emigrations to cities resulted in more demand than could be met by production. Even though reforms turned many peasants into landowners it imposed on them taxes and other costs such as: purchase of seeds, water and equipment that they were not burdened with when they worked for landowners, while also eliminating services such as health and education that were provided for them by landlords under the traditional system. An influx of agricultural imports from US also reduced the farmers&#x27; market share.

In the beginning, the White Revolution received most of its criticism from two main groups: the clergy, and the landlords. The landlords were angry about the land reforms because their land was bought by the government and then sold in smaller plots to the citizenry at a lower price.

The powerful Shī&#x27;ah clergy were also angered at the reforms that removed much of their traditional powers in the realms of education and family law, as well as lessening their previously strong influence in the rural areas. A &quot;large percentage of the upper echelon of the clergy came from landowning families&quot; deeply affected by the reform and much absentee rent income went directly to the clergy and their institutions. The rents from an estimated 10,000 villages whose rents helped finance the clerical establishment were eligible for redistribution.

The group, or more appropriately, the man who most openly opposed the White Revolution and the Shah himself was Ruhollah Khomeini. Although the clergy in Iran were not happy about many aspects of the White Revolution, such as granting suffrage to women, and the secular local election bill as well as land reforms, the clergy as a whole were not actively protesting. Khomeini, on the other hand, seemed to undergo a serious change of thought from the traditional role and practices of Shi’ite clergy, and actively spoke out against the new reforms and the Shah. In a speech at Feyziyeh School in June 1963, Khomeini spoke out against the Shah&#x27;s brutality towards student protests, and for the first time, it was a speech attacking the Shah as a person. This speech did lead to Khomeini&#x27;s exile, but being outside of Iran did not stop Khomeini&#x27;s protests, nor did it weaken his influence inside Iran.

Khomeini also attacked provisions of the reforms that would allow members of Iran&#x27;s non-Muslim minority to be elected or appointed to local offices:

A couple of months later on Ashura, Khomeini gave an angry speech attacking the Shah as a &quot;wretched miserable man.&quot; Two days later, on June 5, Khomeini was arrested. This sparked three days of rioting and left several hundred dead. The riots were remembered in speeches and writings as the time when the army &quot;slaughtered no less than 15,000&quot; according to Khomeini.

==Aftermath==
===Immediate consequences===

The most important and relevant consequence of the White Revolution and the reforms it brought, was the rising popularity of Ruhollah Khomeini. With the growing perception of government corruption, and the implementation of reforms through the White Revolution, Khomeini grew to be an outspoken political enemy of the Shah. The White Revolution was the catalyst for Khomeini&#x27;s change in thought. Once Khomeini, as a respected member of the clergy, started to openly oppose the Shah and call for his overthrow, a favourable view of him emerged amongst the opposition to the reforms, seeing him as a figure they could rally for.

===Long-term consequences===

Though the White Revolution contributed towards the economic and technological advancement of Iran, the failures of some of the land reform programs and the partial lack of democratic reforms, as well as severe antagonism towards the White Revolution from the clergy and landed elites, would ultimately contribute to the Shah&#x27;s downfall and the Iranian Revolution in 1979.

<text>Electrophoresis is the motion of charged dispersed particles or dissolved charged molecules relative to a fluid under the influence of a spatially uniform electric field. As a rule, these are zwitterions with a positive or negative net charge.

Electrophoresis is used in laboratories to separate macromolecules based on their charges. The technique normally applies a negative charge called cathode so anionic protein molecules move towards a positive charge called anode. Therefore, electrophoresis of positively charged particles or molecules (cations) is sometimes called cataphoresis, while electrophoresis of negatively charged particles or molecules (anions) is sometimes called anaphoresis.

Electrophoresis is the basis for analytical techniques used in biochemistry and molecular biology to separate particles, molecules, or ions by size, charge, or binding affinity, either freely or through a supportive medium using a one-directional flow of electrical charge. It is used extensively in DNA, RNA and protein analysis.

Liquid &quot;droplet electrophoresis&quot; is significantly different from the classic &quot;particle electrophoresis&quot; because of droplet characteristics such as a mobile surface charge and the nonrigidity of the interface. Also, the liquid–liquid system, where there is an interplay between the hydrodynamic and electrokinetic forces in both phases, adds to the complexity of electrophoretic motion.

== History ==
== Theory ==

Suspended particles have an electric surface charge, strongly affected by surface adsorbed species, on which an external electric field exerts an electrostatic Coulomb force. According to the double layer theory, all surface charges in fluids are screened by a diffuse layer of ions, which has the same absolute charge but opposite sign with respect to that of the surface charge. The electric field also exerts a force on the ions in the diffuse layer which has direction opposite to that acting on the surface charge. This latter force is not actually applied to the particle, but to the ions in the diffuse layer located at some distance from the particle surface, and part of it is transferred all the way to the particle surface through viscous stress. This part of the force is also called electrophoretic retardation force, or ERF in short.
When the electric field is applied and the charged particle to be analyzed is at steady movement through the diffuse layer, the total resulting force is zero:
:formula_1

Considering the drag on the moving particles due to the viscosity of the dispersant, in the case of low Reynolds number and moderate electric field strength &quot;E&quot;, the drift velocity of a dispersed particle &quot;v&quot; is simply proportional to the applied field, which leaves the electrophoretic mobility μe defined as:

:formula_2

The most well known and widely used theory of electrophoresis was developed in 1903 by Marian Smoluchowski:

:formula_3,

where εr is the dielectric constant of the dispersion medium, ε0 is the permittivity of free space (C2 N−1 m−2), η is dynamic viscosity of the dispersion medium (Pa s), and ζ is zeta potential (i.e., the electrokinetic potential of the slipping plane in the double layer, units mV or V).

The Smoluchowski theory is very powerful because it works for dispersed particles of any shape at any concentration. It has limitations on its validity. For instance, it does not include Debye length κ−1 (units m). However, Debye length must be important for electrophoresis, as follows immediately from Figure 2,
&quot;Illustration of electrophoresis retardation&quot;.
Increasing thickness of the double layer (DL) leads to removing the point of retardation force further from the particle surface. The thicker the DL, the smaller the retardation force must be.

Detailed theoretical analysis proved that the Smoluchowski theory is valid only for sufficiently thin DL, when particle radius &quot;a&quot; is much greater than the Debye length:

:formula_4.

This model of &quot;thin double layer&quot; offers tremendous simplifications not only for electrophoresis theory but for many other electrokinetic theories. This model is valid for most aqueous systems, where the Debye length is usually only a few nanometers. It only breaks for nano-colloids in solution with ionic strength close to water.

The Smoluchowski theory also neglects the contributions from surface conductivity. This is expressed in modern theory as condition of small Dukhin number:

:formula_5

In the effort of expanding the range of validity of electrophoretic theories, the opposite asymptotic case was considered, when Debye length is larger than particle radius:

:formula_6.

Under this condition of a &quot;thick double layer&quot;, Erich Hückel predicted the following relation for electrophoretic mobility:

:formula_7.

This model can be useful for some nanoparticles and non-polar fluids, where Debye length is much larger than in the usual cases.

There are several analytical theories that incorporate surface conductivity and eliminate the restriction of a small Dukhin number, pioneered by Theodoor Overbeek and F. Booth. Modern, rigorous theories valid for any Zeta potential and often any &quot;aκ&quot; stem mostly from Dukhin–Semenikhin theory.

In the &quot;thin double layer&quot; limit, these theories confirm the numerical solution to the problem provided by Richard W. O&#x27;Brien and Lee R. White.

For modeling more complex scenarios, these simplifications become inaccurate, and the electric field must be modeled spatially, tracking its magnitude and direction. Poisson&#x27;s equation can be used to model this spatially-varying electric field. Its influence on fluid flow can be modeled with the Stokes law, while transport of different ions can be modeled using the Nernst–Planck equation. This combined approach is referred to as the Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Stokes equations. It has been validated for the electrophoresis of particles.

<text>The Technical University of Munich (TUM or TU Munich; ) is a public research university in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. It specializes in engineering, technology, medicine, and applied and natural sciences.

Established in 1868 by King Ludwig II of Bavaria, the university now has additional campuses in Garching, Freising, Heilbronn, Straubing, and Singapore, with the Garching campus being its largest. The university is organized into seven schools, and is supported by numerous research centers. It is one of the largest universities in Germany, with 52,580 students and an annual budget of €1,839.2 million including the university hospital.

A &quot;University of Excellence&quot; under the German Universities Excellence Initiative, TUM is among the leading universities in the European Union. Its researchers and alumni include 18 Nobel laureates and 24 Leibniz Prize winners.

== History ==
=== 19th century ===
In 1868, King Ludwig II of Bavaria founded the &quot;Polytechnische Schule München&quot; with Karl Maximilian von Bauernfeind as founding director. The new school had its premises at Arcisstraße, where it is still located today. At that time, around 350 students were supervised by 24 professors and 21 lecturers. The institution was divided into six departments: The &quot;General Department&quot; (mathematics, natural sciences, humanities, law and economics), the &quot;Engineering Department&quot; (civil engineering and surveying), the &quot;Building Construction Department&quot; (architecture), the &quot;Mechanical-Technical Department&quot; (mechanical engineering), the &quot;Chemical-Technical Department&quot; (chemistry), and the &quot;Agricultural Department&quot;.

In 1877, the &quot;Polytechnische Schule München&quot; became the &quot;Technische Hochschule München&quot; (TH München), and in 1901 it was granted the right to award doctorates. With an average of 2,600 to 2,800 students, the TH München was Germany&#x27;s largest technical university, ahead of the TH Berlin. In 1970 the institution was renamed &quot;Technische Universität München&quot;.

=== 20th century ===

In 1906, Anna Boyksen became the first female student to enroll in electrical engineering, after the Bavarian government had allowed women to study at technical universities in the German Empire. 
Martha Schneider-Bürger became the first German female civil engineer to graduate from the university in 1927.

In 1913, Jonathan Zenneck became director of the newly created Physics Institute.

During the Weimar Republic, the TH München faced the challenge of limited resources and was drawn into radical political conflicts during the November Revolution, the Great Depression, and the rise of Adolf Hitler. Two of the 16 Nazis killed in Hitler&#x27;s failed coup attempt in 1923 were students at the university. The National Socialist German Students&#x27; League became the strongest faction in the General Students&#x27; Committee in 1930, and Jewish and politically unpopular professors were terrorized by the young students.

After Hitler took power, the TH was soon aligned and a &quot;Führer rector&quot; was appointed, with the deans directly responsible to him. The Führerprinzip was also imposed on universities, resulting in a significant restriction of the autonomy of the TH München. In 1933, the newly enacted Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service led to the dismissal of staff deemed &quot;non-Aryan&quot; or married to &quot;non-Aryans,&quot; as well as politically &quot;undesirable&quot; professors. Jewish students lost their rights and were banned from enrolling after 1938.

The university was deeply involved in the crimes of the Nazi regime. For instance, Heinz Henseler, a professor in charge of animal breeding at the university, headed a new &quot;Colonial Science Seminar&quot; from 1940. The seminar focused on exploring how to &quot;Germanize&quot; the landscapes of Poland and Russia for future colonization and settlement during the war. The entire Faculty of Agriculture was influenced by the ideology of blood and soil, and agricultural scientists had no qualms about using forced laborers and prisoners of war on university experimental farms. Henseler repeatedly asked his former student and SS chief Heinrich Himmler for additional land and led several excursions to the SS herb garden on the grounds of the Dachau concentration camp with his students.

During World War II, the TH München conducted extensive research in armaments to support the war effort. Notable professors during this time included aircraft designer Willy Messerschmitt and physicist Walther Meissner. Despite the war, high-level basic research continued to be conducted in some institutes, as some professors, staff members, and students dared to disobey and resist. Nobel laureate Hans Fischer protected Jewish students from Nazi persecution. He committed suicide shortly before the end of the war.

=== Post World War II ===

During the war, 80 percent of the university&#x27;s facilities in Munich had been destroyed. Under these difficult conditions, teaching resumed in April 1946.

In 1956, the construction of a research reactor in Garching was the beginning of the Garching campus. In 1969, the physics department building was opened there, followed in 1977 by new buildings for the chemistry, biology and geoscience departments.

Between 1868 and 1870 the architect Arnold Zenetti oversaw the construction of several hospital buildings which are today attached to the Munich universities or form part of the TUM campus. In 1967, a TUM School of Medicine was founded with campuses in the buildings of &quot;Rechts der Isar Hospital&quot;. By 1968, the so called TH München comprised six faculties, 8,400 students, and 5,700 staff. In 1972, the Zentrale Hochschulsportanlage, a 45-hectare sports center, was built on the grounds of the 1972 Summer Olympics.

In 1970, the TH München was renamed to its present name &quot;Technische Universität München&quot;. When the Bavarian Higher Education Act came into force in 1974, the six faculties were replaced by eleven departments. In 1992, the field of computer science was established as an independent Department of Informatics, having previously been part of the Department of Mathematics since 1967.

=== 21st century ===
In 2002, TUM Asia was founded in Singapore, in cooperation with the Nanyang Technological University and the National University of Singapore. It was the first time that a German university had established a subsidiary abroad.

The Department of Sport and Health Sciences and the School of Management were established in 2002. The Weihenstephan departments were combined into the &quot;Weihenstephan Centre of Life and Food Sciences&quot; (WZW), which would later become the School of Life Sciences. With the establishment of the School of Education in 2009, the School of Governance in 2016, the Department of Aerospace and Geodesy in 2018, the School of Natural Sciences in 2023, the university comprises 7 schools and 29 research departments.

Since the inception of the German Universities Excellence Initiative in 2006, TUM has won every round of evaluation and the title &quot;University of Excellence&quot;.

As part of its &quot;Agenda 2030&quot;, the 15 schools and departments were consolidated into seven schools by 2023.

TUM&#x27;s academic faculties are divided amongst numerous campuses.

=== Munich ===

The historic Main Campus (&quot;Stammgelände&quot;) is located in Maxvorstadt, the central borough of Munich. Today, the departments of Architecture, Civil, Geo and Environmental Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Schools of Management, Governance, Education are located here.

The TUM School of Medicine is located at the site of its university hospital, the Rechts der Isar Hospital, in the district of Haidhausen.

The TUM Department of Sport and Health Sciences is located in the Olympiapark, the former site of the 1972 Summer Olympics.

=== Garching ===

The campus in Garching, located around 10 km north of Munich, has grown to become the largest TUM campus. In the last decades, the departments of Physics, Chemistry, Mechanical Engineering, Informatics and Mathematics have all relocated from their former buildings in the Main Campus. They have since been joined by numerous research institutes, including the Max Planck Institutes for Plasma Physics, Astrophysics, Extraterrestrial Physics and Quantum Optics, the Forschungsreaktor München II (FRM II), the headquarters of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), and the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre, one of the fastest supercomputers in Europe.

A landmark of the Garching campus is the Oskar von Miller Tower, a meteorological measurement tower with a height of 62 m. The Garching campus is connected to Munich by the Autobahn and the Munich U-Bahn. It has its own fire department.

=== Weihenstephan ===
The third TUM campus is located 35 km north of Munich in Weihenstephan, Freising. It hosts the School of Life Sciences.

=== Other locations ===
Additional TUM facilities are located in Ottobrunn (Department of Aerospace and Geodesy), Straubing, Heilbronn, and Singapore.

=== TUM Asia ===

TUM operates a subsidiary in Singapore. In 2001, the &quot;German Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) – TUM Asia&quot; was founded in partnership with the National University of Singapore and the Nanyang Technological University, offering a range of Master&#x27;s programs. In 2010, TUM Asia started offering bachelor&#x27;s degrees in collaboration with the Singapore Institute of Technology.

In 2010, TUM and the Nanyang Technological University founded &quot;TUMCREATE&quot;, a research platform for the improvement of Singapore&#x27;s public transportation.

== Academics ==

=== Schools and departments ===
As a technical university, the university specializes in engineering, technology, medicine, and the applied and natural sciences. Compared to a &quot;Volluniversität&quot; (a universal university), it lacks the &quot;Geisteswissenschaften&quot;, including law and many branches of the social sciences.

As of 2023, the Technical University of Munich is organized into seven schools and 29 departments:

Other institutions include the Rechts der Isar Hospital, the TUM Graduate School and the Munich School of Politics and Public Policy.

The TUM School of Management is triple accredited by the European Quality Improvement System (EQUIS), the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and the Association of MBAs (AMBA).

=== Research ===

The Technical University of Munich is one of the most research-focused universities in Europe. This claim is supported by relevant rankings, such as the funding ranking of the German Research Foundation and the research ranking of the Centre for Higher Education.

Under the German Universities Excellence Initiative, TUM has obtained funding for multiple research clusters, including &quot;e-conversion&quot; (energy technology), &quot;MCQST&quot; (quantum mechanics), &quot;ORIGINS&quot; (astrophysics, biophysics and particle physics), and &quot;SYNERGY&quot; (neurology).

In addition to the schools and departments, TUM has set up numerous research centers with external cooperation partners.

Integrative research centers (IRCs) combine research with teaching. They include the TUM Institute for Advanced Study (TUM-IAS), the Munich Center for Technology in Society (MCTS), the Munich Data Science Institute (MDSI), the Munich School of Engineering (MSE), the Munich School of BioEngineering (MSB), and the Munich School of Robotics and Machine Intelligence (MSRM).

Corporate research centers (CRCs) carry out research independently of the schools and departments, cooperating with industry partners for application-driven research. They include the research reactor FRM II, the Center for Functional Protein Assemblies (CPA), the Catalysis Research Center (CRC), the center for translational Cancer Research (TranslaTUM), the Walter Schottky Institute (WSI), the Hans Eisenmann-Zentrum for Agricultural Science, and the Institute for Food &amp; Health (ZIEL).

=== Partnerships ===
TUM has over 160 international partnerships, ranging from joint research activities to international study programs. Partners include:
* Europe: ETH Zurich, EPFL, ENSEA, École Centrale Paris, TU Eindhoven, Technical University of Denmark, Technical University of Vienna, NMBU
* United States: MIT, Stanford University, Northwestern University, University of Illinois, Cornell University, University of Texas at Austin, Georgia Tech
* Asia: National University of Singapore, Multimedia University, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, University of Tokyo, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Amrita University, Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology,

<text>Basingstoke and Deane is a local government district with borough status in Hampshire, England. The main town is Basingstoke, where the council is based. The district also includes the towns of Tadley and Whitchurch, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. The modern district was created in 1974, initially being called Basingstoke. It changed its name to &quot;Basingstoke and Deane&quot; in 1978 at the same time that it was made a borough; Deane was added to the name to represent the rural parts of the borough, being the area&#x27;s smallest village.

Parts of the borough lie within the North Wessex Downs, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The neighbouring districts are Hart, East Hampshire, Winchester, Test Valley, West Berkshire and Wokingham.

==History==
The town of Basingstoke was an ancient borough. It appears to have had a degree of self-government from at least the thirteenth century, was incorporated as a borough in 1392 and was given the right to appoint a mayor in 1641. It was reformed in 1836 to become a municipal borough.

The modern district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of three former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Basingstoke Municipal Borough
*Basingstoke Rural District
*Kingsclere and Whitchurch Rural District
The new district was initially named Basingstoke, after its largest town. Charter trustees were established for the area of the former borough of Basingstoke, allowing the district councillors representing that area to choose one of their number to take the title of mayor, continuing Basingstoke&#x27;s series of mayors dating back to 1641. On 20 January 1978 the district was renamed Basingstoke and Deane and granted borough status, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor instead, with the charter trustees being dissolved at the same time. The name Deane was chosen to represent the rural parts of the borough as it was said by the council to be the area&#x27;s smallest village.

==Governance==
Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Hampshire County Council. Much of the borough is covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government, although the main urban area of Basingstoke is an unparished area.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2022. Following the 2023 election a minority administration of the Liberal Democrats and the &quot;Independent Forum&quot; group (at the time, comprising local party the Basingstoke and Deane Independents, the Green councillor and the independent councillors) took control of the council. Paul Harvey of the Basingstoke and Deane Independents was appointed leader of the council and Liberal Democrat leader Gavin James was appointed deputy leader (but styled &quot;co-leader&quot;). Labour voted in favour of the new administration forming, but does not form part of the administration itself, with all positions on the council&#x27;s cabinet held by Liberal Democrats or members of the Independent Forum.

The first election to the modern council was held in 1973, initially acting as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Basingstoke and Deane. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2003 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election, the composition of the council was:
The Basingstoke and Deane Independents, the Green councillors, the Women&#x27;s Equality councillor and the independent councillors sit together as the &quot;Independent Forum&quot; group, which forms the council&#x27;s administration with the Liberal Democrats. The next election is due in 2026.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Civic Offices on London Road. The old Basingstoke Town Council had bought a large eighteenth century house called Goldings at 5 London Road in 1922 and converted it to become municipal offices. Following the creation of the new council in 1974 a new office building incorporating a council chamber was built west of Goldings, opening in 1976 and now being called Deanes. Additional offices to the east of Goldings were subsequently added called Parklands. Goldings is now used as a register office with the council being based at Deanes and Parklands, with the two buildings together being called the Civic Offices.

==Towns and parishes==

Much of the borough is covered by civil parishes, with the parish councils for Tadley and Whitchurch taking the style &quot;town council&quot;. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council. The town of Basingstoke itself (roughly corresponding to the pre-1974 borough) is an unparished area, directly administered by the borough council.

<text>King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk is a local government district with borough status in Norfolk, England. Its council is based in the town of King&#x27;s Lynn. The district also includes the towns of Downham Market and Hunstanton, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. The population of the district at the 2021 census was 154,325.

Part of the borough lies within the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The borough lies on the coast, facing both The Wash to the west and the North Sea to the north. The neighbouring districts are North Norfolk, Breckland, West Suffolk, East Cambridgeshire, Fenland and South Holland.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering seven former districts which were all abolished at the same time:
*Docking Rural District
*Downham Market Urban District
*Downham Rural District
*Freebridge Lynn Rural District
*Hunstanton Urban District
*King&#x27;s Lynn Municipal Borough
*Marshland Rural District
The new district was initially named &quot;West Norfolk&quot; reflecting its position in the wider county. The district was awarded borough status on 30 January 1981, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor. The name of the borough was changed later that year, becoming &quot;King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk&quot; with effect from 14 May 1981.

==Governance==
The Borough Council of King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Norfolk County Council. Much of the borough is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being run by a coalition of most of the independent councillors, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens with informal support from Labour.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk, with political leadership instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2007 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and subsequent changes of allegiance up to May 2024, the composition of the council was:

Of the 19 independent councillors, 16 sit together as the &#x27;Independent Partnership&#x27;, which forms the council&#x27;s administration with the Liberal Democrats and Greens. Another two form the &#x27;Progressive Group&#x27;, and the other does not belong to a group. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 55 councillors representing 35 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

;UK Youth Parliament

Although the UK Youth Parliament is an apolitical organisation, the elections are run in a way similar to that of the Local Elections. The votes come from 11 to 18 year olds and are combined to make the decision of the next, 2 year Member of Youth Parliament. The elections are run at different times across the country with King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk&#x27;s typically being in early Spring and bi-annually.

===Premises===
The council generally meets at the Town Hall on the Saturday Market Place in King&#x27;s Lynn, parts of which date back to the 1420s, having replaced an earlier guildhall on the site which burnt down in 1421. The council&#x27;s main offices are at King&#x27;s Court, on Chapel Street in King&#x27;s Lynn, which had been built as speculative offices in 1975, initially being called Aspen House. The council bought the building in 1981.

==Geography==
The district comprises the urban area of King&#x27;s Lynn itself, together with 102 surrounding parishes. At the time of the 2001 census, the district had an area of 1,473 km2, of which 28 km2 was in the urban area and 1,445 km2 in the surrounding parishes. The district had a population of 135,345 in 58,338 households, with 34,564 in 15,285 households living in the urban area, whilst 100,781 people in 43,053 households lived in the surrounding parishes.

==Towns and parishes==

The main part of the urban area of King&#x27;s Lynn (roughly corresponding to the pre-1974 borough of King&#x27;s Lynn) is an unparished area. The remainder of the district is covered by civil parishes. The parish councils for Downham Market and Hunstanton have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. The parishes are:

<doc id="349694" wikidata="Q1761365" url="?curid=349694" title="Shrewsbury and Atcham">
<text>Shrewsbury and Atcham was a local government district with borough status in Shropshire, England, between 1974 and 2009.

Shrewsbury was the only town in the borough; Atcham, although itself only a village, was included in the name as a reflection of the incorporation into the borough of the former Atcham Rural District. Other notable villages included Alberbury, Bayston Hill, Bomere Heath, Condover, Cressage, Cross Houses, Dorrington, Ford, Hanwood, Minsterley, Montford Bridge, Nesscliffe, Pontesbury, Uffington and Westbury.

The Borough of Shrewsbury and Atcham covered , which was 19% of the non-metropolitan county of Shropshire. To the north of the borough was the North Shropshire district and the Borough of Oswestry and to the south were the South Shropshire and Bridgnorth districts. The borough lay in the middle of Shropshire and on the border with Wales. A 2006 estimate put the population of the borough at 95,900 (this accounted for approx 40% of the total population for the non-metropolitan county).

The district and its council was abolished on 1 April 2009 when the new Shropshire unitary authority was established, as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England.

==History==
The borough was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972 covering the area of the two former districts of the municipal borough of Shrewsbury and the Atcham Rural District, to form a new non-metropolitan district. The new district was initially called &quot;Shrewsbury&quot;, but was renamed Shrewsbury and Atcham on 12 June 1974 by the new council. The district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chairman of the council to take the title of mayor.

The borough unsuccessfully applied for city status in the 2000 and 2002 competitions.

The borough and its council were abolished on 31 March 2009, with the area becoming part of the new Shropshire Council unitary authority from 1 April 2009, as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England. The Central area committee of the new Shropshire Council covers exactly the same area as the borough did. The population for this area was 102,383 in 2011.

==Population==
== Headquarters ==

In the 19th century the headquarters of the borough council were at the Old Guildhall in the Market Square in Shrewsbury. The council moved to Newport House in Dogpole in 1917 and then to modern building on Frankwell Quay in Frankwell in March 2004. After Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council was abolished in 2009, it became surplus to requirements and was converted for use by the University Centre Shrewsbury.

== Property ==

The borough council owned much land and property in the Shrewsbury and Atcham area. Shrewsbury Castle was owned by the borough council, as was the town museum and art gallery, which is located in the &#x27;Rowley&#x27;s House&#x27; building. The council also owned various car parks, offices, some public conveniences, large areas of parkland and a number of the town&#x27;s bridges. Ownersrship of two main entertainment venues was also held by the council: The Music Hall, which holds the town theatre, its tourist information centre and a cafe, and The Old Market Hall, which was recently renovated to house a small cinema and cafe. The Bear Steps buildings were also owned by the council, although they are occupied by the town&#x27;s civic society. The council once owned the Clive House Museum, but this was sold off and is now no longer a museum.

The borough council&#x27;s housing stock was sold off in 2001 to a private social housing company, Severnside. The council earned some £60 million from this sale and this money has been used in part to buy and build their new Guildhall, build the new sports facilities at Sundorne and other large projects around the town, which were either under way or proposed when the borough council ceased to exist.

== Parishes ==
The rural part of the borough (the pre-1974 Atcham Rural District) was always parished but the urban part of the borough (the pre-1974 municipal borough of Shrewsbury) was an unparished area. A town council for Shrewsbury was established on 1 April 2009, being the same day that the new Shropshire unitary authority took over from the old Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council.

== Mayors ==

There has been a continuous succession of Mayors of Shrewsbury since 1638. In 1974, after the local government re-organisation, the style changed to &quot;Mayor of Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough&quot;, and any Shrewsbury and Atcham borough councillor could be appointed to the post; they did not have to represent Shrewsbury itself. The last mayor of Shrewsbury and Atcham was Anne Chebsey. Since the abolition of the borough of Shrewsbury and Atcham in 2009, the mayor of Shrewsbury has been the chairman of the new Shrewsbury Town Council, a parish-level authority.

==Political control==
The first elections to the enlarged council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council from 1974 until its abolition in 2009 was held by the following parties:

===Leadership===
The last leader of the council was Peter Nutting, a Conservative.

==Council elections==
Elections were generally held three years out of every four, with a third of the council elected each time.

<text>Nuneaton and Bedworth is a local government district with borough status in Warwickshire, England. It includes the towns of Nuneaton (where the council is based) and Bedworth, as well as a modest rural hinterland including the village of Bulkington.

The neighbouring districts are Rugby, Coventry, North Warwickshire and Hinckley and Bosworth.
==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, by a merger of two former districts which were both abolished at the same time, these were:
*Bedworth Urban District
*Nuneaton Municipal Borough
The new district was initially named Nuneaton, after its largest town. Nuneaton&#x27;s borough status, which it had held since 1907, was transferred to the enlarged district, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor. Following a campaign from Bedworth residents the borough&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Nuneaton and Bedworth&quot; with effect from 1 October 1980.

==Governance==
Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Warwickshire County Council. There are no civil parishes in the borough, which is an unparished area.

===Political control===
The council was under Labour majority control since the 2024 election. On 11 December, after councillor Will Markham defected to the Conservatives at a Town Hall meeting, Labour lost control of the council, which seen it become no overall control.

Political control of the council since the 1974 reforms has been as follows:

===Leadership===

===Composition===

The next election is due in 2026.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2024 the council has comprised 38 councillors representing 19 wards, with each ward electing two councillors. Elections are held in alternate years, with half the council (one councillor for each ward) elected each time for a four-year term of office.

===Premises===
The council is based at Nuneaton Town Hall on Coton Road in Nuneaton. The building was purpose-built for the old Nuneaton Borough Council and opened in 1934.

==Subdivisions==


Nuneaton and Bedworth are divided into 19 wards, each represented by 2 councillors, giving a total of 38 councillors. The borough has no civil parishes.

<doc id="349699" wikidata="Q3610720" url="?curid=349699" title="Alex Sanchez (author)">
<text>Alex Sanchez (born 1957) is a Mexican American author of award-winning novels for teens and adults. His first novel, &quot;Rainbow Boys&quot; (2001), was selected by the American Library Association (ALA), as a Best Book for Young Adults. Subsequent books have won additional awards, including the Lambda Literary Award. Although Sanchez&#x27;s novels are widely accepted in thousands of school and public libraries in America, they have faced a handful of challenges and efforts to ban them. In Webster, New York, removal of &quot;Rainbow Boys&quot; from the 2006 summer reading list was met by a counter-protest from students, parents, librarians, and community members resulting in the book being placed on the 2007 summer reading list.

==Life and career==
Sanchez was born in 1957 in Mexico City, to parents of German and Cuban heritage; his family emigrated to the U.S. in 1962. He studied writing at the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, Massachusetts, under Michael Cunningham, Richard McCann, Allan Gurganus, Peter Ho Davies, Michael Klein, Elizabeth McCracken, and Jacqueline Woodson.

Sanchez&#x27;s works explore themes of love, friendship, coming of age, and LGBT questioning youth. His first novel, &quot;Rainbow Boys&quot; (2001), was selected by the American Library Association, as a Best Book for Young Adults. With the novel&#x27;s debut, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; magazine deemed Sanchez a &quot;Flying Start&quot;. Two sequels, &quot;Rainbow High&quot; (2003) and &quot;Rainbow Road&quot; (2005), complete the Rainbow trilogy, portraying the coming of age of three gay and bisexual teenage boys. Both novels were honored as &quot;Books for the Teen Age&quot; by the New York Public Library. 

Sanchez&#x27;s novel &quot;So Hard to Say&quot; (2004), about a group of 13-year-olds, won the Lambda Literary Award for Children&#x27;s and Young Adult literature. &quot;Getting It&quot; (2006) won the Myers Outstanding Book Award for Human Rights and also second place at the 2007 Latino Book Awards for Best Young Adult Fiction in English. &quot;The God Box&quot; (2007), focuses on the conflict and friendship between two Christian teenage boys, one openly gay and the other struggling to accept his sexuality. &quot;Bait&quot; (2009), about a teenage boy struggling with secrets from his past, won the 2009 Florida Book Award Gold Medal for YA fiction and the 2011 Tomás Rivera Mexican-American Children&#x27;s Book Award. &quot;Boyfriends with Girlfriends&quot; (2011) explores bisexuality in teens. In May 2011, the Lambda Literary Foundation awarded Sanchez the Outstanding Mid-Career Novelists&#x27; Prize. Additional works by Sanchez include his short story, &quot;If You Kiss a Boy&quot;, which appeared in the anthology &quot;13: Thirteen Stories about the Agony and Ecstasy of Being Thirteen&quot; (2003), edited by James Howe. 

Although Sanchez&#x27;s novels are widely accepted in thousands of school and public libraries in the U.S. and Canada, they have faced a handful of challenges and efforts to ban them. Linda P. Harvey of Mission America in Columbus, Ohio, targeted &quot;Rainbow Boys&quot; in her 2002 essay &quot;The World According to PFLAG: Why PFLAG and Children Don&#x27;t Mix Unless you happen to like child abuse&quot; . The book was also challenged by citizens in Owen, Wisconsin in 2005, but ultimately retained by the Owen-Withee Junior and Senior High School, although the superintendent suggested creating a policy of requiring guardian permission to check out the book (ABFFE). In addition to the Wisconsin challenge, the book was also challenged at the Montgomery County Memorial Library System in Montgomery County, Texas (Doyle 6). The ACLU of Texas also reports that &quot;Rainbow Boys&quot; was challenged in Texas during the 2004–05 school year (ACLUTX 30).

One of the most recent challenges occurred in 2006, when the Webster, New York Central School District removed &quot;Rainbow Boys&quot; from the summer reading list. After numerous protests from students, parents, librarians, and community members, the book was placed on the 2007 summer reading list. In Canada in 2008, the superintendent of schools for Charlotte County, New Brunswick canceled plans for Sanchez to speak to students in the high schools &quot;after a few parents objected&quot;. However, after hearing Sanchez speak at a presentation, he said he would recommend the gay author as a speaker. &quot;Oh absolutely. Definitely. Now that I&#x27;ve heard him, he&#x27;s wonderful. But I needed to hear that message.&quot;

In June 2020, DC Comics published &quot;You Brought Me the Ocean&quot;, a graphic novel based on the character Aqualad, authored by Sanchez and illustrated by Jul Maroh, author of &quot;Blue is the Warmest Color&quot;.

Sanchez&#x27;s novel &quot;The Greatest Superpower&quot; (2021) tells the story of twin thirteen-year-old boys whose beloved dad comes out as transgender. On August 11, 2021, &quot;Time&quot; magazine announced the selection of &quot;Rainbow Boys&quot; as one of &quot;The 100 Best YA Books of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="349704" wikidata="Q91345714" url="?curid=349704" title="Spherical circle">
<text>In spherical geometry, a spherical circle (often shortened to circle) is the locus of points on a sphere at constant spherical distance (the &quot;spherical radius&quot;) from a given point on the sphere (the &quot;pole&quot; or &quot;spherical center&quot;). It is a curve of constant geodesic curvature relative to the sphere, analogous to a line or circle in the Euclidean plane; the curves analogous to straight lines are called &quot;great circles&quot;, and the curves analogous to planar circles are called small circles or lesser circles. If the sphere is embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space, its circles are the intersections of the sphere with planes, and the great circles are intersections with planes passing through the center of the sphere.

== Fundamental concepts ==

=== Intrinsic characterization ===

A spherical circle with zero geodesic curvature is called a &quot;great circle&quot;, and is a geodesic analogous to a straight line in the plane. A great circle separates the sphere into two equal &quot;hemispheres&quot;, each with the great circle as its boundary. If a great circle passes through a point on the sphere, it also passes through the antipodal point (the unique furthest other point on the sphere). For any pair of distinct non-antipodal points, a unique great circle passes through both. Any two points on a great circle separate it into two &quot;arcs&quot; analogous to line segments in the plane; the shorter is called the &quot;minor arc&quot; and is the shortest path between the points, and the longer is called the &quot;major arc&quot;.

A circle with non-zero geodesic curvature is called a &quot;small circle&quot;, and is analogous to a circle in the plane. A small circle separates the sphere into two &quot;spherical disks&quot; or &quot;spherical caps&quot;, each with the circle as its boundary. For any triple of distinct non-antipodal points a unique small circle passes through all three. Any two points on the small circle separate it into two &quot;arcs&quot;, analogous to circular arcs in the plane.

Every circle has two antipodal poles (or centers) intrinsic to the sphere. A great circle is equidistant to its poles, while a small circle is closer to one pole than the other. Concentric circles are sometimes called &quot;parallels&quot;, because they each have constant distance to each-other, and in particular to their concentric great circle, and are in that sense analogous to parallel lines in the plane.

=== Extrinsic characterization ===
If the sphere is isometrically embedded in Euclidean space, the sphere&#x27;s intersection with a plane is a circle, which can be interpreted extrinsically to the sphere as a Euclidean circle: a locus of points in the plane at a constant Euclidean distance (the &quot;extrinsic radius&quot;) from a point in the plane (the &quot;extrinsic center&quot;). A great circle lies on a plane passing through the center of the sphere, so its extrinsic radius is equal to the radius of the sphere itself, and its extrinsic center is the sphere&#x27;s center. A small circle lies on a plane &quot;not&quot; passing through the sphere&#x27;s center, so its extrinsic radius is smaller than that of the sphere and its extrinsic center is an arbitrary point in the interior of the sphere. Parallel planes cut the sphere into parallel (concentric) small circles; the pair of parallel planes tangent to the sphere are tangent at the poles of these circles, and the diameter through these poles, passing through the sphere&#x27;s center and perpendicular to the parallel planes, is called the &quot;axis&quot; of the parallel circles.

The sphere&#x27;s intersection with a second sphere is also a circle, and the sphere&#x27;s intersection with a concentric right circular cylinder or right circular cone is a pair of antipodal circles.

== Applications ==
=== Geodesy ===
In the geographic coordinate system on a globe, the parallels of latitude are small circles, with the Equator the only great circle. By contrast, all meridians of longitude, paired with their opposite meridian in the other hemisphere, form great circles.

<text>The Great Central Railway (GCR) is a heritage railway in Leicestershire, England, named after the company that originally built this stretch of railway. It runs for between the town of Loughborough and a new terminus in the north of Leicester. It has period signalling, locomotives and rolling stock.

Four stations are in operation, each restored to a period in the railway&#x27;s commercial history: (the 1950s); Quorn &amp; Woodhouse (Second World War and the remainder of the 1940s); (Edwardian Era); Leicester North (the 1960s).

Between 2006 and 2023 there were four accidents involving injury to people, or investigation by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB).

== Background history ==
In 1897, the Great Central Railway itself was formed, becoming the last steam mainline in the United Kingdom. Two years later in 1899, &quot;The London Extension&quot; was officially opened to passenger and freight traffic, allowing more direct journeys from the capital to Nottingham, Leicester, Sheffield and Manchester. This construction scheme was devised by chairman Sir Edward Watkin, who had envisioned his railway one day running through a channel tunnel to France, linking Britain with the continent.

However, this never came to fruition; indeed, the Beeching report which led to cutback and closure was published in 1963, some 31 years before the tunnel was fully constructed. In the report, the line was described as a duplicate of the Midland Main Line. Apart from the most southerly section into London, the line was closed as a through route in 1966 as part of the Beeching Axe, although a section of the line between Nottingham and Rugby remained open until 1969. The closure became one of Doctor Beeching&#x27;s largest cutbacks.

==Preservation==
In the late 1960s, local groups who opposed the closure gathered together for a series of meetings at Leicester Central railway station and the Main Line Preservation Group (MLPG) was formed. There had been talk of restoring the entire closed line from to , but this was rationalised to a section from to Leicester and later, because British Rail retained the single track between Loughborough and Ruddington for British Gypsum freight and access to the now-closed Ministry of Defence base, the group&#x27;s plans focussed on the Loughborough to Leicester section. The published aim of MLPG was &quot;to acquire a suitable length of main line, for the operation of steam hauled passenger trains, at realistic speeds&quot;. Work began on salvaging as much reusable material as possible for the project from the recent demolitions.

===The early years (1969–1976)===
The MLPG received a lease on the station, buildings and most of the trackbed at in 1970; this would become its base of operations. By the following year, negotiations into purchasing the rest of the remaining railway had proven successful and the group was able to buy it for a mere £75,000 (£ in ). The rest of the Loughborough yard complex was secured in 1972. In the same year, the first coaching stock arrived on site. The first open day occurred in 1973, shortly after the arrival of working motive power. Passengers were offered simple wagon or coach rides run by small industrial locomotives. On 30 September 1973, LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 No. 5231 hauled the first passenger train since the railway&#x27;s commercial closure, to Quorn and back, but at the same time the down line was being lifted between Birstall and Quorn because of BR&#x27;s increasing demands.

To purchase what was left of the track, the MLPG was re-merged into a supporting charity, the Main Line Steam Trust (MLST). The entire value of the of up line was re-assessed by BR at £279,000 (£ in ) and the MLST was now paying £3,300 a month (£ in ) just to keep it. A deal was struck on 1 April 1976 that would see the remainder of the down line lifted if BR&#x27;s cash demand was not raised. At that time, passenger trains were still running as far as Rothley, but, without an adequate supply of working mainline locomotives, the trust had to resort to using industrial tank engines working single track – some way short of the original vision of the MLPG seven years previously.

===Great Central Railway PLC===
To purchase the land and track, Great Central Railway (1976) PLC issued shares, and the MLPG was transformed into the MLST, a charitable body, to support the company.

Charnwood Borough Council agreed to purchase the land from BR and lease it to the railway for 99 years. However, this still left GCR (1976) PLC the task of raising over £150,000 (£ in ) to purchase the track. Ultimately, the target was not met and only a single track between Loughborough and Quorn could be afforded (BR allowed more time to raise funds to purchase Quorn to Rothley). The double track from Rothley to Belgrave &amp; Birstall was lifted, along with the &#x27;down&#x27; line from Loughborough to Rothley.

In the late 1980s, the intention was announced to extend the line back to Belgrave &amp; Birstall. The former station had been vandalised and the Railway had no choice but to demolish the buildings. In 1990, a station called Leicester North was opened a hundred metres to the south of Belgrave &amp; Birstall. This shift in location placed the new station inside Leicester&#x27;s city boundary, allowing the &#x27;Leicester&#x27; tag to be included in the name, along with unlocking extra funds to assist in the construction.

===The double track project (1991-present day)===

In the 1990s David Clarke became president of the GCR and approached the railway about the possibility of double-tracking the line. As a signalling enthusiast, Clarke aspired to operate a signal box on a double track main line, and so the campaign to raise funds to double the section between Quorn and Rothley was launched, with Clarke himself providing a large amount of the capital.

After reaching Quorn, work moved ahead to extend the second track to Loughborough. The double track between Loughborough and Rothley opened on 1 June 2000. This gave additional capacity, which is especially useful at galas, where up to six trains may be in operation at any one time. This enables the running of non-passenger-carrying trains (freights, TPO set) during galas to a greater extent than any other heritage railway. It also means that the timetable can be generally adhered to, as delays do not cascade, as they do on single track lines.

Her Majesty&#x27;s Rail Inspectorate has granted powers to run private test trains at up to 60 mph. Other special trains at public events run at up to . Typically, UK heritage railways are limited to a maximum speed of .

In 2004, a new signal box at Quorn opened, at that time the only preserved box in the UK with a double track on either side. With this new signal box, a train can, in theory, be dispatched from Loughborough every 10 minutes. A further signal box at Swithland Sidings has been fitted with Great Western Railway style signals, in the style of the GCR/GWR joint line via High Wycombe, allowing for a further capacity increase on the preserved GCR. The full Swithland project was completed in May 2012.

On 5 December 2012, the GCR was awarded the NRHA Signalling Award for this long-running and complicated project.

In 2016 the BBC reported that GCR and GCRN claimed that it was &#x27;the only place in the world where full size steam engines can be seen passing each other&#x27;.
==Major engineering projects==

===The gap and Loughborough Midland (High Level)===

Approximately 500 metres (0.3 mi) separates the GCR to the south from another stretch of the former railway to the north, operated by the Great Central Railway (Nottingham), formerly known as the Nottingham Heritage Railway. &quot;The Gap&quot; from the GCR&#x27;s Loughborough locomotive shed to where the line crosses the A60 is a section of embankment and bridges (including a large single span over the Midland Main Line) that would need to be reinstated to join the two concerns together. If completed, the GCRN would merge with the GCR to create a single track (the Greater Great Central Railway (GGCR), as it is known almost universally by Great Central staff), which would also be rebuilt as a double-track line for most, if not the whole, of its length.

The project has been moving forward steadily since February 2009, when it was announced that it would receive £350,000 for a feasibility study, Charnwood Borough Council having won a grant from the East Midlands Development Agency, with the GCR to contribute £100,000 towards a combined cost of £450,000 for the study.

As of 2022:
* A new (single-track) bridge over the Midland Main Line was completed in 2017 at a cost of about £3 million. The new bridge has been built with increased clearances to accommodate proposed future electrification of the Midland Main Line.
* In 2020 work was completed on refurbishing the bridge over the Grand Union Canal, at a cost of £475,000.
* In October/November 2022 the existing bridge over the A60, which had been damaged by corrosion and by repeated vehicle impacts, was replaced by a new twin-track structure, at a cost in excess of £1 million.

Remaining stages include a bridge over Railway Terrace and a &#x27;flyover&#x27; over a factory car-park immediately to the north of it (together projected to cost £3 million), plus work to reinstate embankments to the north and south of the new bridges. It is proposed that work on the embankments will use current construction techniques to provide a higher but narrower structure than the original; while the Railway Terrace bridge is proposed to re-use one of two 17-metre road bridges removed as part of reconstruction work at Reading station in 2011 and made available by Network Rail to the project.

Earlier plans also suggested for the Nottingham side of the railway to build a new station, Loughborough High Level, immediately to the north of the Midland Main Line, which could be completed before the other works, and provide passengers with an easy walking connection to and from Loughborough main-line station. This has not so far been taken forward.

In March 2024, it was announced that Loughborough Central locomotive shed- which lies over the original rail track north of Loughborough- is to be relocated as part of the railways unification project.

The Mountsorrel Railway project was originally devised and financed by Railway Vehicle Preservations Limited and aimed to rebuild the Mountsorrel branch off the Great Central railway at Swithland sidings to the working Mountsorrel quarry.

In 2006, the branch was essentially intact but the track was lifted in the mid-1960s. The original purpose of the reinstatement was to provide a carriage shed to house the restored carriages of Railway Vehicle Preservations Ltd and shelter them from the elements. In 2006, RVP applied for planning permission for the shed, but this was rejected due to badger setts discovered on site. The reinstatement of the line went ahead, instead being carried out by a separate group, the Mountsorrel Railway Project, directed by Steve Cramp. Work commenced in 2008 with the aim of relaying of line up to the bridge at Bond Lane, where a platform was planned to be built. By 2012, the line had been fully ballasted for half of its length, passing through Wood Lane Bridge and across into Mountsorrel Parish.
RVP re-evaluated their plans for the shed at the end of the branch line, instead deciding upon putting an application in for a four road shed at the back of Swithland sidings. On 4 February 2013 the ambitious plans were given conditional approval.

After eight years and over 80,000 hours of volunteer time, the Mountsorrel Railway was opened to the public over the weekend of 24 and 25 October 2015 by Richard Faulkner, Baron Faulkner of Worcester, who is president of the Heritage Railway Association and vice chairman of the Science Museum.

Following the opening of the railway, the Mountsorrel Railway Project changed direction, evolving into the Mountsorrel and Rothley Community Heritage Centre, which now occupies the former site of Nunckley Quarry.

Recently Lafarge, (operators of the Mountsorrel Quarry) proposed a stone loading terminal at the end of the Mountsorrel Railway. This was in response to a planning submission to build 300+ Houses near to the proposed Bond Lane Station, and was clearly aimed at Lafarge protecting the mineral extraction rights. The proposal would be dependent on the GCR &#x27;Bridging the Gap&#x27; to GCRN. GCR then would build a north chord from the southern end of Swithland Viaduct to meet the existing track just at the end of the straight section of the Mountsorrel Railway. The proposal estimates that 3 loaded trains of 1000 tonnes would leave the proposed terminal every weekday and travel via the GCR to the Midland Main Line Connection.

==Stations of the heritage GCR==
**Loughborough Central is the largest of the working stations on the line, with a long overhead canopy, museum, gift shop, café and 1950s period detail. This has helped the station feature in numerous movies and TV shows.
**The signal box and traction maintenance depot north of the platform are both open for public viewing, allowing for an insight into the physical labour that is required to run a steam railway.
*Quorn &amp; Woodhouse 
**Serving the local villages of Quorn and Woodhouse, this station is built to the standards of Great Central, with an island platform and an overbridge. The station details were intended to make it reflect World War II and the remainder of the 1940s. This has allowed for several World War reenactments to be played out in recent years. This station would have served the nearby Beaumanor Hall which, during WWII, was a &#x27;Y&#x27; station receiving German signals and passing them on to &#x27;Station X&#x27; at Bletchley.
** The newly built (2011) Butler Henderson Bistro &amp; Tea Room provides food and refreshments.
**South of the platform is a small set of goods sidings which currently store the TPOs, mineral wagons and other stock when they are not in use.
**A turntable has been installed at Quorn &amp; Woodhouse Station and officially opened in the latter part of October 2011.
**Similar in appearance to Quorn &amp; Woodhouse, Rothley was rebuilt by the volunteers of the Great Central to look like the Edwardian era, when it is believed the GCR company was at its high-point. Today the recently extended Ellis tea room serves refreshments year-round and the Charnwood Forest Garden Railway run by a small group of enthusiasts runs various types of stock.
**A large 4-road carriage shed of corrugated metal owned by RVP Ltd is the major restoration facility for their historic collection of Gresley Teaks and Mk1s.
*Leicester North 
**Just south of Belgrave and Birstall station is the new Leicester North terminus, built because the original station was heavily vandalised. Currently little more than a small waiting room and canopy in 60s style.
**Adjacent to the station is the recently leased Greenacres Centre having the &#x27;Platform Tea Room&#x27; and Training Facilities.
**Railway museum. On 8 December 2012 it was announced that an annex to the National Railway Museum would be built close to Leicester North, these plans were cancelled in 2017 after funding arrangements were cancelled. 
**On 15 December 2017, the National Lottery announced that the Museum has £9.5m funding withdrawn.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 4 February 2006, LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 locomotive 45305 &quot;Alderman A. E. Draper&quot; collided with a rake of six carriages at , damaging the locomotive and one of the carriages. Two people were injured. An investigation by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) found that the driver was not wearing spectacles at the time of the accident, despite it being a requirement on his medical certificate to do so when driving. No testing was carried out by the GCR on the train crew for drug or alcohol use. There was no first aid kit carried on the locomotive, although this was recommended by Her Majesty&#x27;s Railway Inspectorate for all locomotives. The RAIB made four recommendations as a result of the accident.
*On 27 April 2013, LMS Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0 46521 was derailed on trap points at . The accident was filmed by a visitor to the railway whose film clearly shows the train departing from a loop against a danger signal. This had been authorised by the signalman as the signal was not working. However the signalman failed to close the trap point and the driver failed to check the trap point in accordance with the rules. The incident was not investigated by the RAIB.
*On 12 May 2014, Class 37 diesel electric locomotive 37198 ran away from Quorn &amp; Woodhouse pushing a TPO carriage . They collided with a rake of five carriages at Loughborough Central. The RAIB investigation into the accident, published on 21 May 2015, found that the accident was caused by the train being stabled in an ineffective manner to protect it from a runaway. Additional factors were that there was no brake van in the train, contrary to GCR rules, and that the train was left parked in a position where there was no runaway protection, such as catch points, available. The RAIB made four recommendations as a result of the accident.
*On 14 January 2023, a passenger sustained serious injuries alighting from a train at Loughborough Central. The RAIB opened an investigation into the accident. As a result of the accident, the RAIB issued urgent safety advice to heritage railways on 29 March.

==Film and television==
Many filmmakers have taken advantage of the atmosphere of the Great Central and it has had many notable appearances in film and television.

==Locomotives and rolling stock==
Some of Britain&#x27;s largest locomotives have been there. The steam fleet comprises several mainline classes, many of them either heavy freight, express passenger or shunting tank engines. Some are of types that were preserved in abundance elsewhere, but others have been leased from the National Collection. The railway also has a fleet of diesel locomotives, ranging from Class 08 shunters to Class 37 and Class 50&#x27;s. As of 7 October 2022 the railway had only a few diesel locos serviceable. These were D123 (45 125), 37 714, D6700 (37 119/37 350). Locos such as the 20,25,47,50 and others are all withdrawn for repairs.
As well as running stock the railway also has a collection of heritage rolling stock. Passenger stock is made up of uniform rakes of British Rail Mark 1 coaches originally built in the 1950s and 60s. They either carry Maroon, Carmine and Cream, Western Region Chocolate and Cream, or Great Central Pullman liveries.

==Supporting bodies==

Both the Great Central Railway PLC and the Great Central Railway (Nottingham) have a number of supporting bodies which are based at each individual line. The majority of these are locomotive or rolling stock groups, however there are a number of private owners who have based their stock or locomotives at the lines.

===Main Line Steam Trust===
Main Line Steam Trust was established in 1969 as the Main Line Preservation Group, with the intention of preserving one of two potential sections of the line, one based at Lutterworth, running from Leicester to Rugby Central, and one based at Loughborough, running between Leicester and Nottingham. The Loughborough base was chosen and work began on restoring the station, an office was rented at street level at Loughborough Central station, and in 1971 Charitable Status was granted to MLPG, who changed their name to Main Line Steam Trust Limited.

Substantial monthly payments were required to keep the formation intact between Loughborough and Belgrave &amp; Birstall, with steam hauled services operating from Loughborough Central to Quorn &amp; Woodhouse Station, and eventually Rothley station. The money required to purchase the line south of Rothley was not available and only the Loughborough to Rothley section of line was preserved, with the aid of Charnwood Borough Council.

The operation and the assets were transferred to the Great Central Railway (1976) Ltd. and MLST took on the role of the charitable volunteer-run support body for the railway. MLST has continued to support the Great Central Railway PLC (the 1976 was eventually dropped from the title), and the various organisations around the railway. It also supports the Great Central Railway (Nottingham).

MLST have funded at the Great Central Railway, including assistance in funding the double track, Leicester Station, Quorn &amp; Woodhouse Signalling, Swithland Signalling, Loughborough South Remodelling, and has assisted in bringing in visiting locomotives for gala events.

MLST has been incorporated into The Friends of the Great Central Main Line (FoGCML), this with the David Clarke Railway Trust (DCRT) provide the volunteers and the funding. Outside commercial interests and individuals are able to donate toward various projects.

<text>Sedgefield is a market town and civil parish in County Durham, England. It had a population of 4,986 in the 2021 census. It has the only operating racecourse in County Durham.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Sedgefield&quot; is of Old English origin. It is derived from the given-name &quot;Cedd&quot; + &quot;feld&quot; (&gt; &quot;field&quot;).

==History==
===Roman===
In 2003, a Roman &#x27;ladder settlement&#x27; was discovered in fields just to the west of Sedgefield, by Channel Four&#x27;s &quot;Time Team&quot; programme. It consisted of rows of parallel crofts and workshops on either side of a north–south trackway, creating a ladder-like layout, which could be securely dated by the many finds of Roman coins.

===Hunting===

During the 1800s, it was a hunting centre, dubbed &#x27;the Melton of the North&#x27;. Hunter Ralph Lambton had his headquarters at Sedgefield: the humorous writer, Robert Smith Surtees, who lived at Hamsterley Hall, was a friend of his. On 23 February 1815, Lord Darlington wrote: &#x27;Mr Ralph Lambton was out with some gentlemen from Sedgefield, and a most immense field.&#x27;

===Winterton===
The town was known in the area because of Winterton Hospital. This was an isolation hospital and an asylum. The site was like a village itself with its own fire station, bank and cricket team. Today, little trace is left of the hospital, apart from the church, which is now surrounded by the Winterton housing estate and the NETPark Science park.

=== Politics ===
The 19th-century South African politician and industrialist Henry Barrington was born in Sedgefield, and actions by his offspring indirectly led to the South African town of Sedgefield, Western Cape, being named in honour of his birthplace.

Sedgefield constituency&#x27;s Member of Parliament was Tony Blair; he was the area&#x27;s MP from 1983 to 2007, Leader of the Labour Party from 1994 to 2007 and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2007.

During November 2003, Sedgefield was visited by the American president George W. Bush during a state visit. He visited a local pub, as well as the local secondary school (Sedgefield Community College). This event was preceded by high-intensity security, which included fastening down manhole covers and drains, and closing the centre of the town to all traffic. An anti-war protest coincided with his visit.

==Landmarks==
===St Edmund&#x27;s===
The parish of St Edmund was founded by Bishop Cutheard of Lindisfarne, around AD 900. The Normans replaced the original wooden church with the present stone building with rounded arches, and the present church was built between 1246 and 1256, to replace the original wooden church, with later additions. The tower was added in the 15th century by Robert Rodes. Elaborate 17th-century woodwork was installed by John Cosin, bishop of Durham. The church also contains monumental brasses.

===Ceddesfeld Hall===
Ceddesfeld Hall was originally the rectory to the church, built after the first rectory burnt down; it is now occupied by the Sedgefield Community Association. A Latin inscription above the door states, &quot;By the generosity of Samuel and Shute Barrington, one an Admiral of the Fleet, the other Bishop of Durham, whose achievements are praised by everyone.&quot; The hall was rebuilt in 1793, by the Barringtons, for their nephew, the rector. The grounds, now a public area, were laid out in the mid-18th century to a design by Joseph Spence.

=== The Manor House ===

The Manor House occupies a prominent position at the head of the green. With three storeys it is a fine example of Queen Anne style architecture. Built in 1707 by Robert Wright Esq., as the sundial on the house proclaims. The house was at one time part of the Hardwick Estate (1756–1792), and from 1907 to 1974, the offices of Sedgefield Rural District Council and 1974-1990 Sedgefield Magistrate&#x27;s Court. The house has been carefully restored and is currently used as a venue for weddings and events as well as being a business hub.

===Hardwick Hall===

The 18th century saw the architect James Paine commissioned by John Burdon in 1754 to design and construct a Palladian estate at a historic coaching inn nearby Hardwick. The building work was never completed as Burdon went bankrupt, sufficient landscaping was done to form the basis of what came to be Hardwick Hall Country Park. The area is Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens, and the hall, presently the Hardwick Arms Hotel, is Grade II Listed

==Governance==
In the general election of December 2019 the constituency was won by Conservative MP, Paul Howell, as well as having a local mayor. An electoral ward of the same name exists. This ward includes surrounding areas and at the 2011 census had a population of 6,879.

===Parish Hall===
The Parish Hall was founded in 1849 as the Institute of Literature and Science, but later rebuilt as a Mechanics Institute. The hall was extensively refurbished in 2008, and continues to host a wide range of social events and entertainment.

== Education ==

There are two primary schools in Sedgefield, Sedgefield Hardwick and Sedgefield County Primaries, and the secondary school, Sedgefield Community College.

==Culture and customs==
The town is twinned with Hamminkeln, Germany. The 700th anniversary of the Sedgefield&#x27;s market charter granting took place in 2012. The market was held on Cross Hill from 1312 until 1918. The original market cross was removed during the 19th century, a new cross was placed during the anniversary year. The new cross was produced by a local designer. A farmers&#x27; market is held on the first Sunday of every month.

There is a city friendship with Duisburg-Rheinhausen, a district of Duisburg.

===Annual events===
A Shrove Tuesday Ball Game still takes place in Sedgefield and is an example of Mob Football. A recent statue was erected to commemorate the yearly event; it features a man catching the famous Shrove Tuesday ball.

A popular annual event is the Mediaeval Fair, which takes place in mid-May, and brings the local community and surrounding areas into the closed central streets of Sedgefield, to participate in fun fair rides, and medieval-themed activities.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees. Television signals are received from either the Pontop Pike or Bilsdale TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Tees, Capital North East, Heart North East, Smooth North East, Greatest Hits Radio North East, Nation Radio North East, Hits Radio Teesside and &#x27;Darlo Radio&#x27;, a community based station.

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;The Northern Echo&quot;.

==Transport==
Sedgefield railway station was opened by the Clarence Railway on 11 July 1835, and operated under several companies before the nationalisation of Britain&#x27;s railways. It closed on 31 March 1952.

Sedgefield continues to be served by public transport. Arriva North East route X22 operates hourly to Peterlee and Middlesbrough.

==Sport==
===Horse racing===
There are a number of sporting venues and organisations in Sedgefield, the most famous of which is probably Sedgefield Racecourse, a regional thoroughbred horse-racing venue. There have been horse races since as early as 1732, and in 1846 officially recognised meetings began.

===Cricket===
&quot;Sedgefield Cricket Club&quot; is situated on the outskirts of the town on Station Road. The ground was donated to the people of Sedgefield around the turn of the nineteenth century and is home to a number of senior and junior teams.

===Rugby===
Reformed in 2007, &quot;Sedgefield District RUFC&quot; are a small club, based at the cricket club, and with their own pitch on grounds overlooking Hardwick East. It is associated with Durham County Rugby Football Union, it was awarded the Whistler Trophy by the Durham County referee society for the most welcoming club for officials and opponents alike.

The first XV currently play in Durham/Northumberland 2 following several successful seasons in Durham/Northumberland Division 3. Notable achievements for the club are winning promotion to DN2 in the 2016/17 season and won the county plate in the 2017/18 Season. The team has had some notable successes and a tough reputation for taking scalps from many larger, more ‘established’ clubs in the area, Gosforth, Darlington and Redcar to name a few.

The club&#x27;s second XV “Sedgefield Saxons” play in the Tees Valley Friendly League, this team has an inclusive, and hard working reputation, with the aim of continuing to develop both playing, and the values of Rugby Union in the area. Reflecting this aim the club fielded a third XV, quaintly known as the &quot;T&#x27;urds&quot;, together with a Veteran team, Sedgefield Spartans in the 2019/20 season.

===Motocross===
At the end of the 1970s a group of friends started gathering to ride their motocross bikes at a farm in Low Hardwick. Today &quot;Quad Sport Leisure&quot; is one of very few sites in the North East of England where people can legally ride their quad bikes off-road. Occasionally, motocross tracks are available to the public for recreational use, and quads are available for hire suitable for all age groups from infants upwards. A &quot;Bring your own&quot; quad track, designed by a professional quad racer to include two large jumps, is also available.

===Squash===
&quot;Sedgefield Squash Club&quot; has two courts behind Ceddesfield Hall in the village with one being a glass wall. The club has 5 Men&#x27;s and 2 Ladies teams in the Durham and Cleveland Leagues and a considerable amount of junior members with the club constantly growing. The club boasts around 12 internal leagues where players are constantly changing their rankings. It has had a refurbishment in 2020 - 2021.

===Football===
&quot;Sedgefield Youth Football Club (SYFC)&quot; run an Under-12 team in the Teesside junior football alliance. They are based at the local community college.

===Tennis===
&quot;Sedgefield Tennis Club&quot; play on three courts at the Community College. The club enters one Ladies team, one Mixed Team, and two Men&#x27;s teams in the Cleveland Tennis League. &quot;Sedgefield ST Edmunds F.C&quot; play in the Swinburn Maddison Premier League.

===Golf===
&quot;Knotty Hill Golf Centre&quot; is a 45-hole golf course, opened in the mid-nineties. The Princes and the Bishops courses are both 18 holes and another nine holes is made up by the academy course.

===Running===
&quot;Sedgefield Harriers&quot; are a local running and athletics club based at Sedgefield Community College. They compete in road races, in fell races (mainly on the North York Moors), in cross country and on the track. There is a large junior section which competes in track and field competitions and cross country. The club hosts the Serpentine Trail Race each September, Summer and Winter open handicaps in January and July and the Neptune Relays in April.

In 2011, Sedgefield Harriers were recognised by England Athletics as National Development Club of the Year and by UK Athletics as Club of the Year. In 2012 the club was County Durham Sports Club of the Year. In December 2020 the club announced plans for an athletics track and associated facilities to the north of Sedgefield under the project name of EDCAT (East Durham Community Athletics Track).

<text>The disease mycobacterial cervical lymphadenitis, also known as scrofula and historically as king&#x27;s evil, involves a lymphadenitis of the cervical (neck) lymph nodes associated with tuberculosis as well as nontuberculous (atypical) mycobacteria.

==Disease==
Scrofula is the term used for lymphadenopathy of the neck, usually as a result of an infection in the lymph nodes known as lymphadenitis. It can be caused by tuberculous or nontuberculous mycobacteria. About 95% of the scrofula cases in adults are caused by &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, most often in immunocompromised patients (about 50% of cervical tuberculous lymphadenopathy). In immunocompetent children, scrofula is often caused by atypical mycobacteria (&quot;Mycobacterium scrofulaceum)&quot; and other nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Unlike the adult cases, only 8% of cases in children are tuberculous.
With the stark decrease of tuberculosis in the second half of the 20th century, scrofula became a less common disease in adults, but remained common in children. With the appearance of HIV/AIDS, however, it has shown a resurgence, and can affect patients at all stages of the disease.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most usual signs and symptoms are the appearance of a chronic, painless mass in the neck, which is persistent and usually grows with time. The mass is referred to as a &quot;cold abscess&quot;, because there is no accompanying local color or warmth and the overlying skin acquires a violaceous (bluish-purple) color. NTM infections do not show other notable constitutional symptoms, but scrofula caused by tuberculosis is usually accompanied by other symptoms of the disease, such as fever, chills, malaise and weight loss in about 43% of the patients. As the lesion progresses, skin becomes adhered to the mass and may rupture, forming a sinus and an open wound. The fatal outcome some patients experienced in earlier times was due to a cheese-like presentation of the lungs and the King&#x27;s Evil lesions. It was also associated with pulmonary tuberculosis.

Cervical lymphadenitis is commonly caused by an infection of mycobacteria in the head region. This disease is very inconsistent; cases can have different laboratory findings. Sometimes the disease can occur due to tuberculosis disease. However it is vital that, on a case-by-case basis, it is determined whether the cause is tuberculous or nontuberculous mycobacteria, as treatment often differs between the two forms.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is usually performed by needle aspiration biopsy or excisional biopsy of the mass and the histological demonstration of stainable acid-fast bacteria in the case of infection by &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; (Ziehl–Neelsen stain), or the culture of NTM using specific growth and staining techniques.

===Pathology===
The classical histologic pattern of scrofula features caseating granulomas with central acellular necrosis (caseous necrosis) surrounded by granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells. Although tuberculous and non tuberculosis lymphadenitis are morphologically identical, the pattern is somewhat distinct from other causes of bacterial lymphadenitis.

==Treatment==
===17th century===
King&#x27;s Evil, as the disease was historically called, was known as a frequent disorder in the 17th century, and was believed to be caused by bad blood coagulating in spongy organs such as the thyroid and the lymph nodes. Physicians also believed the disease could be inherited and could result from parents&#x27; untreated venereal infections. 

The treatment for mycobacterial cervical lymphadenitis consisted primarily of small incisions to remove the surrounding soft tissue and/or the abnormal mass. Until the 18th century, many doctors thought the only way to cure the disease was to be touched by a member of a royal family. In both France and England, the kings, who were thought to have inherited a miraculous power to cure the illness, touched crowds of infected people. The &#x27;touchings&#x27; began in France during the reign of King Philip I (1060–1108) and in England during the reign of King Henry I (1100–1135). This act of public healing by powerful kings and royal family members encouraged the nickname &quot;King&#x27;s Evil&quot;. After the touching, the sovereign presented the affected person with an angel on a gold-plated coin that was to be hung around the infected person by a ribbon. This was used as a way of warding off the disease. This coin could have weighed as much as 5 grams and was considered a touch piece of great value. At age three the English lexicographer Samuel Johnson, for example, was treated for scrofula in this way, touched by Queen Anne and presented with a piece of gold, unfortunately, to no effect.

The royal touch and surgical removal were not the only methods of healing employed: &quot;Scrophularia nodosa&quot; (common name: &quot;Figwort&quot;), which has nodular roots that resemble the swollen lymph nodes of the affected, was thought to be useful in treating the disease, according to the doctrine of signatures – the plant being hung around the neck of the affected. Figwort does, in fact, contain compounds that can help decrease inflammation, irritation and discomfort.

===20th century to present===
The choice of treatment is highly dependent on the specific type of infection, i.e. NTM or tuberculoid. Furthermore, although many different therapeutic options exist, especially with regards to non-tuberculosis mycobacterial infections – incision and drainage, aspiration biopsy and chemotherapy have all been proven to result in a complete cure of NTM-type infections – different treatments can cause different side-effects, including facial nerve injury and scarring. Therefore, the course of treatment must be tailored to each patient, taking into account their history as well as the severity of infection.

Surgical excision of the scrofula does not work well for &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; infections, and has a high rate of recurrence and formation of fistulae. Furthermore, surgery may spread the disease to other organs. The best approach is to use conventional treatment of tuberculosis with antibiotics. The cocktail-drug treatment of tuberculosis (and inactive meningitis) includes rifampicin along with pyrazinamide, isoniazid, ethambutol, and streptomycin (&quot;PIERS&quot;).

Scrofula caused by NTM, on the other hand, responds well to surgery, but is usually resistant to antibiotics. The affected nodes can be removed either by repeated aspiration, curettage or total excision (with the risk in the latter procedure, however, often causing unsightly scarring, damage to the facial nerve, or both).

==Prognosis==
With adequate treatment, clinical remission is practically 100%. In NTM infections, with adequate surgical treatment, clinical remission is greater than 95%. It is recommended that persons in close contact with the diseased person, such as family members, be tested for tuberculosis.

== History and etymology ==
The term &#x27;cervical&#x27; refers to the cervical lymph nodes in the neck; it is unrelated to the cervix. The alternative name scrofula comes from the medieval Latin &quot;scrōfula&quot;, diminutive of &quot;scrōfa&quot;, meaning &quot;brood sow&quot;, because swine were supposed to be subject to the complaint, or because the line of elevated lymph nodes was thought to resemble the belly of a breastfeeding sow.

In the beginning of the Modern Age some Western Europeans believed that royal touch, the touch of the sovereign of England or France, could cure diseases owing to the divine right of sovereigns. Henry VI of England is alleged to have cured a girl with it. Scrofula was therefore also known as &quot;the King&#x27;s evil&quot;. From 1633, the Book of Common Prayer of the Anglican Church contained a ceremony for this, and it was traditional for the monarch (king or queen) to present to the touched person a coin—usually an angel, a gold coin the value of which varied from about 6 shillings to about 10 shillings. In England this practice continued until the early 18th century, and was continued by the Jacobite pretenders until the extinction of the House of Stuart with the death of the pretender Henry IX. King Henry IV of France is reported as often touching and healing as many as 1,500 individuals at a time. Queen Anne touched the infant Samuel Johnson in 1712. The kings of France continued the custom until Louis XV stopped it in the 18th century, though it was briefly revived by Charles X in 1825.

Physicians, healers, and patent medicine sellers offered a wide range of cures for scrofula or the King&#x27;s Evil. Since ancient times, the highly toxic heavy metal mercury, referred to as cinnabar, quicksilver or calomel, was administered as an ointment or pill or inhaled as a vapor to treat skin diseases. Mercury taken internally induced vomiting and sweating, reactions believed to cure the disease. In 1830, the &quot;New-York Medical and Physical Journal&quot; continued to recommend mercury as the best cure for scrofula, stating it caused an irritation that would counteract the disease and increased the working of the glands. Alternative treatments were also offered. Many rejected the harsh side effects of mercury, claiming their cures were made of &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;vegetable&quot; ingredients. Patent medicines labeled as sarsaparilla were recommended for scrofula.

Examples of treatments recommended between the 17th and 19th century include the following:
* Herbalist Nicholas Culpepper (1616–1654) claimed to have treated his daughter for scrofula with lesser celandine, and cured her within a week. Ironically, Culpepper would himself later die of tuberculosis.
* In the 18th century, Elizabeth Pearson, an Irish herbalist, proposed a treatment for scrofula involving herbs and a poultice and extract of vegetable, and in 1815, Sir Gerard Noel presented a petition to the House of Commons advocating her treatment.
* In 1768, the Englishman John Morley produced a handbook entitled &quot;Essay on the Nature and Cure of Scrophulous Disorders, Commonly Called the King&#x27;s Evil&quot;. The book starts by listing the typical symptoms and indications of how far the disease had progressed. It then goes into detail with a number of case studies, describing the specific case of the patient, the various treatments used and their effectiveness. The forty-second edition was printed in 1824.
* Richard Carter, a frontier healer in Kentucky, recommended several treatments for the King&#x27;s Evil, or scrofula, in his 1815 home medical guide &quot;Valuable Vegetable Medical Prescriptions for the cure of all Nervous and Putrid Disorders&quot;.
* In the 19th century in the United States, the patent medicine Swaim&#x27;s Panacea was advertised to cure scrofula. Swaim&#x27;s Panacea contained mercury.

In 1924, French historian Marc Bloch wrote a book on the history of the royal touch: &quot;The Royal Touch: Sacred Monarchy and Scrofula in England and France&quot; (original in French).

== Case studies ==
A three-year-old healthy young female presented with a bilateral cervical lymph node enlarged. The patient was admitted to the hospital after tuberculosis skin test became positive and further examination showed several other enlarged lymph nodes near her neck. At the hospital, she underwent an exploration surgery where they excised part of her presented lymph node and drained her retropharynx. The drained retropharynx grew methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus mitis.&quot; After these findings, the patient received oral linezolid for ten days and had antimicrobial drug therapy for 14 days. Once the patient returned for a follow-up appointment, the lymph node had only slightly decreased in size. Due to this, it had to be completely removed from her neck. Bacterial cultivation of tissue from the excised lymph node resulted in the growth of &quot;atypical Mycobacteria&quot;, which were identified by 16S gene sequencing as &quot;Mycobacterium florentinum&quot;. After she recovered and went home, there were no repeat signs that the infection was back for over a year.

<text>Protect and Survive was a public information campaign on civil defence. Produced by the British government between 1974 and 1980, it intended to advise the public on how to protect themselves during a nuclear attack. The campaign comprised a pamphlet, newspaper advertisements, radio broadcasts, and public information films. The series had originally been intended for distribution only in the event of dire national emergency, but provoked such intense public interest that the pamphlet was published, in slightly amended form, in 1980. Due to its controversial subject, and the nature of its publication, the cultural impact of &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; was greater and longer-lasting than most public information campaigns.

==Origins==
&quot;Protect and Survive&quot; had its origins in civil defence leaflets dating back to 1938, titled &quot;The Protection of Your Home Against Air Raids&quot;. These advised the homeowner on what to do in the event of air attack. This evolved as the nature of warfare and geopolitics changed, with the pamphlets updated first into &quot;The Hydrogen Bomb&quot; in 1957, and later into &quot;Advising the Householder on Protection against Nuclear Attack&quot; in 1963. This document, of which 500,000 copies were made, garnered considerable public and government criticism when it was first released for its lack of explanations or conveyance of the reasoning behind the advice that was given. The Estimates Committee were similarly bemused by the advice, calling for its withdrawal. Civil defence personnel were summoned to House of Commons meetings in which they responded to all the points of criticism that were raised. The 1963 pamphlet was then accompanied by a series of public information films produced in 1964, called &quot;Civil Defence Information Bulletins&quot;. These films were intended to be broadcast in a state of emergency. Pamphlets similar to those prepared in 1963 briefly appeared in Peter Watkins&#x27; controversial 1965 BBC docudrama &quot;The War Game&quot;, in a scene where they were distributed to people&#x27;s homes. The 1964 bulletins were not depicted in the film.

The fallout radiation advice in &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; was based on 1960s fallout shelter experiments summarised by Daniel T. Jones of the Home Office Scientific Advisory Branch in his report, &quot;The Protection Against Fallout Radiation Afforded by Core Shelters in a Typical British House&quot; which was published in &quot;Protective Structures for Civilian Populations&quot;, Proceedings of the Symposium held at Washington, D.C., 19–23 April 1965, by the Subcommittee on Protective Structures, Advisory Committee on Civil Defense, US National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council. The fallout radiation was represented by measurements of the penetration of cobalt-60 gamma radiation, which has a high mean energy of 1.25 MeV (two gamma rays, 1.17 and 1.33 MeV). This is considerably more penetrating than the mean 0.7 MeV of fallout gamma rays. Therefore, the actual protection given against real nuclear weapon fallout would be far greater than that afforded in the peacetime cobalt-60 shielding measurements.

===Wartime Broadcasting Service===

During the early 1970s, the BBC and the Home Office produced a radio script advising the public of what to do in the event of nuclear attack. This was eventually published in October 2008 on the BBC&#x27;s website, with the full correspondence made available to the public via The National Archives. The script used very similar language and style to the later &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; series. In particular, it emphasised the need for citizens to remain in their homes, and not to try to evacuate elsewhere.

During the exchange of correspondence between the BBC and various government departments, several letters seem to suggest that a booklet for public consumption was already being discussed. In a letter from the Central Office of Information, dated 12 March 1974, a request for information from The Home Office about a proposed booklet read as follows:

This was replied to on 15 March 1974 by the Home Office, clearly stating that such a booklet was being produced, and that they were also targeting the same information at television:

==Publication of the pamphlet==

&quot;Protect and Survive&quot; was formally published in May 1980, but had come to the public&#x27;s attention before that via a series of articles in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in January 1980. This wave of interest had been preceded by numerous letters to &quot;The Times&quot; in December 1979 questioning what Civil Defence arrangements were in place in the UK.

This was then followed by a &quot;Times&quot; leader on 19 January 1980 which noted that: &quot;In Britain, a Home Office booklet &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; remains unavailable.&quot; Following this unexpected publicity for &quot;Protect and Survive&quot;, The Minister of State at the Home Office, Leon Brittan, responding on the subject in the House of Commons on 20 February 1980 said that:

The Minister then went on to say the Home Office had received over 200 letters from the public on civil defence. Following the press and parliamentary focus on &quot;Protect and Survive&quot;, as well as an episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme which focused on the campaign, the government chose to publish the &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; booklet in May 1980.

==Political reaction==
Organizations such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament protested that the pamphlet, by popularising the idea that a nuclear war could be survived, made such a war more likely. The protest organisations published and sold large numbers of copies of the pamphlet, considering that widespread reading of the pamphlet could only discredit the government&#x27;s policy. Counter-pamphlets such as &quot;Protest and Survive&quot; by E P Thompson and &quot;Civil Defence, whose Defence&quot; by the Disarmament Information Group replied to the pamphlet&#x27;s arguments.

==Media==
The purpose of the &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; scheme was to provide members of the British public with instructions, primarily via broadcast media, on how to protect themselves and survive a nuclear attack. The broadcasts were to be supplemented by a booklet, which was to act as an &quot;aide-memoire&quot; for householders; despite the booklet&#x27;s later prominence in British culture, the campaign was originally conceived as being broadcast-led, with the booklet confirmed later. The scheme was not intended to be made public during peacetime, and would only have been broadcast if a nuclear attack was deemed likely by the Government during an international crisis. The information detailed a series of steps recommended to be undertaken by British civilians to improve their chances of survival in the event of a nuclear strike on the United Kingdom.

===Print===
The &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; booklet was prepared in 1976, and some 2,000 copies were printed and secretly issued to chief executives of local authorities and senior police officers. Its existence having been brought to public attention by the &quot;Times&quot;, a slightly revised edition of the booklet was printed in 1980, and made available through Stationery Office bookshops. During peacetime, the booklet was priced at 50 pence, but would be widely distributed freely to all households in the United Kingdom if the threat of a nuclear attack increased. This was complemented in 1981 by two booklets regarding the construction of fallout shelters: &quot;Domestic Nuclear Shelters&quot;, with techniques for building a home shelter, and &quot;Domestic Nuclear Shelters – Technical Guidance&quot;, for the design and construction of long-term and permanent shelters, some of which involved elaborate designs.

The contents of the booklets would also be printed in national newspapers if the risk of nuclear attack increased.

In response to extensive criticism of &quot;Protect and Survive&quot;, &quot;Civil Defence: Why We Need It&quot; was also printed in November 1981 by the Home Office, which attempted to defend the reasons for civil defence.

===Television===
 &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; was adapted for television as a series of twenty short public information films. The films were classified, intended for transmission on all television channels if the government determined that nuclear attack was likely within 72 hours. However, recordings leaked to CND and the BBC, who broadcast excerpts from them on &quot;Panorama&quot; on 10 March 1980, shortly after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

The films were produced by Richard Taylor Cartoons, who also produced the &quot;Charley Says&quot; child safety films and children&#x27;s animation &quot;Crystal Tipps and Alistair&quot;, and were ready for use by at least 1975. They are similar in content to the booklets, detailing the same instructions using voice-over narration, sound effects, and a combination of simple stop-motion and illustrated animation. Patrick Allen was chosen to narrate. His voiceover was later described as &quot;the calm, clipped vowels of a male announcer, advising how to build shelters, avoid fallout, and wrap up your dead loved ones in polythene, bury them, and tag their bodies.&quot; He later parodied the recordings for Frankie Goes To Hollywood&#x27;s song &quot;Two Tribes&quot;, announcing &quot;Mine is the last voice you will ever hear. Do not be alarmed&quot;.

Each episode concluded with a distinctive electronic musical phrase composed by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop&#x27;s Roger Limb. It featured two high- and low-pitched melodies coming together &quot;like people&quot;. So great was the secrecy around production that Limb handed over his tapes to producer Bruce Allen in an alley.

===Radio===
A collection of recordings for radio transmission were produced as part of the programme. These differ slightly from the films in that the voice was provided not by Patrick Allen, but by both male and female voices. In addition, certain portions of the instructional copy are changed slightly. While it has been speculated that a small portion of these recordings is heard in &quot;Threads&quot;, during the scene where the character of Bill Kemp is discussing removing internal doors to use for their shelter, this is in fact re-recorded by an actor.

==Cultural impact==
The programme created a substantial impact upon the popular culture of the UK of the early 1980s, most notably in music. Rock band Jethro Tull recorded a song called &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; on their 1980 album &quot;A&quot;, while the hardcore punk/D-beat band Discharge recorded the track &quot;Protest and Survive&quot;, named after E. P. Thompson&#x27;s anti-nuclear manifesto, for their 1982 album &quot;Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing&quot;. Actor Patrick Allen, who narrated the associated public information films, recreated this narration for the 1984 number one single, &quot;Two Tribes&quot;, by Frankie Goes To Hollywood. Irish folk band The Dubliners recorded a song called “Protect and Survive” on their 1987 record, &quot;25 Years Celebration&quot;. Heavy metal band Wolfsbane&#x27;s self-titled 1994 album contains a song called &quot;Protect and Survive&quot;. More recently, the campaign&#x27;s logo and illustrations from the pamphlet can be seen on the cover of the 1997 &quot;Karma Police&quot; single by Radiohead. Also, London post-rock band Public Service Broadcasting recorded the track &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; using samples from the Roger Limb score set over a drum-heavy track with live performances incorporating visual elements taken from the government information film.

In print, Raymond Briggs&#x27; graphic novel &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot; (later adapted as an animated film, radio and stage play) obliquely mentions various aspects of the &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; programme. The leaflet series became the subject of detailed and scholarly criticism from anti-nuclear authors (such as E. P. Thompson), who produced a counterargument entitled &quot;Protest and Survive.&quot; Louise Lawrence&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel &quot;Children of the Dust&quot; refers to one of the inner refuge designs mentioned in the leaflets and to the public information films and radio tapes.

On television, &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; was lampooned in the television series &quot;The Young Ones&quot; episode &quot;Bomb.&quot; The &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; booklet appears on-screen during the episode as characters hide ineffectively under clothed tables and paint themselves white to deflect the blast, parodying its instructions on creating an &quot;inner refuge&quot; and whitewashing one&#x27;s windows, respectively. The BBC television film &quot;Threads&quot; featured four of the series&#x27; films: &quot;Stay at Home&quot;, &quot;Make Your Fall-out Room and Refuge Now&quot;, &quot;Action After Warnings&quot; and &quot;Casualties&quot;. Also, in the &quot;Spooks&quot; episode &quot;Nuclear Strike&quot;, the character Malcolm is seen viewing one of the information videos.

The full version of &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; is shown on a loop underground at the Hack Green Secret Nuclear Bunker in Cheshire and the Kelvedon Hatch Secret Nuclear Bunker in Essex. Other copies are shown on loops at the Imperial War Museums in London and Manchester.
&quot;&quot;, a highly-publicized mod for the video game &quot;Fallout 4&quot;, includes multiple references to the &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; material, including a themed overhaul of the Pip-Boy featuring similar animations in lieu of Vault Boy.

<text>Morbillivirus is a genus of viruses in the order &quot;Mononegavirales&quot;, in the family &quot;Paramyxoviridae&quot;. Humans, dogs, cats, cattle, seals, and cetaceans serve as natural hosts. This genus includes six species, with a seventh species being extinct. Diseases in humans associated with viruses classified in this genus include measles; in animals, they include acute febrile respiratory tract infection and Canine distemper. In 2013, a wave of increased death among the Common bottlenose dolphin population was attributed to morbillivirus.

==Genus==
== Structure ==

Morbillivirions are enveloped, with spherical geometries. Their diameter is around 150 nm. 
Genomes are linear, around 15–16 kb in length. The genome codes for eight proteins.


==Life cycle==
Viral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by virus attaching to host cell. Replication follows the negative-stranded RNA virus replication model. Negative-stranded RNA virus transcription, using polymerase stuttering, through co-transcriptional RNA editing is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by leaky scanning. The virus exits the host cell by budding.
Humans, cattle, dogs, cats, and cetaceans serve as the natural hosts. Infection from this virus takes place in five stages: incubation, prodromal, mucosal, diarrheic, and convalescent. Transmission routes are respiratory. Morbillivirus are sensitive to high temperatures, sunlight, extreme pH levels, and any chemical that can destroy its outer envelope.

<text>Brixton is a London Underground station on Brixton Road in Brixton in the London Borough of Lambeth, South London. It is the southern terminus of the Victoria line and the next station towards north is Stockwell. The station is known to have the largest London Underground roundel on the network. 

==History==
The City and Brixton Railway had planned to link Brixton with Central London by underground railway in 1897 but was unable to raise funds for construction.

Brixton station on the Victoria line was opened on 23 July 1971 by the London Transport Executive. It has high usage for an inner suburban station with 33.46 million entries and exits during 2016 making it the 19th busiest station by this measure.

In the 2000s, the station was extensively refurbished and upgraded, with a new external façade and entrance lobby, installation of step-free access, together with refurbishment of a number of smaller retail outlets and the ticket office. The refurbishment started in 2001, step-free access work was completed in 2005, and the station upgrade was completed in 2010. The station was briefly closed for asbestos removal in 2006. The refurbishment works were a long drawn out process. New panels and lighting have been installed in the escalator shaft.

==Design==
From the ticket hall, three escalators take passengers to and from the platforms. There are also passenger lifts between street level, the ticket hall and the platforms to provide step free access. The station is laid out as a two-track terminus with a scissors crossover north of the station, and the line continues for a short distance south of the station platforms to form a pair of sidings.

The &#x27;Underground&#x27; logo, or otherwise known &#x27;roundel&#x27; on the façade of the station building is the largest on the London Underground network

=== Artwork ===
As with all Victoria line stations, the platforms feature tiled murals in the seat recesses – the work at Brixton by Hans Unger is a pun on the station name, suggesting a &quot;ton of bricks&quot;. Since 2018, Art on the Underground has used the header wall above the main staircase to the ticket hall for temporary murals, by artists such as Njideka Akunyili Crosby, Shanti Panchal and Joy Labinjo. Artists are asked to consider the diverse local community, and as well as reflect the various Brixton murals painted in the local area in the 1980s.

==Location==

The station is in Brixton Road and is about 100 m from Brixton railway station (on the London Victoria to Orpington line, operated by South Eastern). Although the route of the London Overground South London line also runs close to Brixton tube station, there is no station in Brixton on this route because it passes overhead on high railway arches.
==Services and connections==
Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally every 3–5 minutes between 05:55 and 00:18.

London Bus routes 2, 3, 35, 37, 45, 59, 109, 133, 159, 196, 250, 333, 355, 415, 432, P4 and P5, and night routes N2, N3, N35, N109 and N133 serve the station.

<text>Vermicelli (, ; ), is a traditional type of pasta round in section similar to spaghetti. In English-speaking regions it is usually thinner than spaghetti, while in Italy it is thicker. It is typically made with semolina.

==Thickness comparison==
As defined in Italy, the diameters of spaghetti-like pasta are:

;vermicelli : between , with little variation between different producers.
;spaghetti : between .
; : () between .
; : between .
;capellini or : ( or ) between .

In the United States, the National Pasta Association (which has no links with its Italian counterpart, the ) lists vermicelli as a thinner type of spaghetti.

The Code of Federal Regulations of the United States of America defines spaghetti and vermicelli by diameter:

;vermicelli : less than .
;spaghetti : between .

==History==

In 14th-century Italy, long pasta shapes had varying local names. Barnabas de Reatinis of Reggio notes in his (1338) that the Tuscan vermicelli are called in Bologna, in Venice, in Reggio, and in Mantua.

The first mention of a vermicelli recipe is in the book (&quot;The Art of Cooking Sicilian Macaroni and Vermicelli&quot;), compiled by the famous Maestro Martino da Como, unequalled in his field at the time and perhaps the first celebrity chef, who was the chef at the Roman palazzo of the papal chamberlain (), the Patriarch of Aquileia. In Martino&#x27;s , there are several recipes for vermicelli, which can last two or three years () when dried in the sun.

==Vermicelli in other countries==

In Somalia, it is used in a sweet dish called , originating from the Yemeni (). The vermicelli is browned by frying with butter, then water, sugar, and cardamom are added until it has softened slightly. The dish is similar to the Indian sheer khurma; however, no milk or cream is added. Bananas can also be added on top. It is usually eaten as a dessert or as a side-dish with Somali spiced rice dishes.

 is also a common dessert in certain parts of Ethiopia, particularly in the Arab-influenced Harar-ghe region, where it is known as and is served cold, often with a thin layer of custard on top.

===Iberia===

Possibly due to the Umayyad influence, Spain and Portugal use a type of vermicelli called . It is mostly used for soups or desserts. In modern-day Portugal, usually refers to a dessert similar to a rice pudding, but replacing the rice with .

===The Americas===

The is a type of noodle, produced in Europe since medieval times, best known as or &quot;fidelis&quot;, which spread to Mexican and Latin American cuisine, and is often referred to by speakers of English as &quot;vermicelli&quot;. A short noodle, typically a few centimeters in length at most, it is commonly used in chicken soup and in , a type of side dish.

===South Asia===
In countries of the South Asia, vermicelli is available either as long strands or cut into about pieces. Vermicelli is known by various local names such as: in Sindhi; ( or ) in Telugu; when made with wheat, and when made with rice in Tamil; in Malayalam; in Kannada; in Assamese; in Bengali; in Hindi, Urdu and Punjabi; in Marathi; in Odia; in Gujarati; and in Tulu. The noodles are used in a number of dishes, including a variation of , called &quot;sevaya&quot; or &quot;seviyan&quot;, a sweet dessert similar to rice pudding. Vermicelli is also used in many parts of India to make a popular dish called . To prepare it, dry oil-roasted vermicelli and pre-sauteed vegetables such as onions, carrots, French beans, peas, etc. are cooked together with enough water that can be absorbed by the vermicelli. Roasted cashews or peanuts are used as garnish.
In Bangladesh, vermicelli is generally cooked with milk and consumed as a sweet dessert.

==Other noodles called &quot;vermicelli&quot;==
In English, the Italian loanword is used to indicate different sorts of long pasta shapes from different parts of the world, but mostly from South or East Asia.

Central Asian and Persian also resemble vermicelli. or is a Persian frozen dessert made with thin vermicelli noodles frozen with corn starch, rose water, lime juice, and often ground pistachios.

In East and Southeast Asia, the term &quot;vermicelli&quot; is used to translate four different types of noodles. Rice vermicelli can refer to a thin dried type of rice noodle (; Hokkien: ; ; ). A second type of vermicelli is made from rice that has been fermented (; ; Vietnamese: ). The latter are normally eaten fresh, rather than after drying. Thirdly, vermicelli sometimes indicates cellophane noodles made from mung bean or sweet potato flour (; ). Cellophane noodles turn translucent after cooking, whereas rice vermicelli remain opaque. The fourth type of vermicelli are made from wheat rather than rice flour, &quot;misua&quot; ().

<doc id="349723" wikidata="Q155063" url="?curid=349723" title="Mardonius (nephew of Darius I)">
<text>Mardonius ( ; ; died 479 BC) was a Persian military commander during the Greco-Persian Wars. Though he secured initial victories in the first Persian invasion of Greece, he was ultimately forced to retreat into Anatolia after suffering catastrophic losses in both men and material due to a storm off the coast of Mount Athos, following which he was relieved of his command by Darius the Great. He was later re-appointed by Xerxes I and took part in the second Persian invasion of Greece. In 480 and 479 BC, Mardonius spearheaded the Persian army&#x27;s destruction of Athens. Shortly thereafter, he was killed during the Battle of Plataea.

==Early and personal life==

Mardonius was the son of Gobryas, a Persian nobleman who had assisted the Achaemenid prince Darius when he claimed the throne. The alliance between the new king and his friend was cemented by diplomatic marriages: Darius married Gobryas&#x27; daughter, and Gobryas married Darius&#x27; sister. Furthermore, Mardonius married Darius&#x27; daughter Artozostra. Thus, Darius the Great was simultaneously Mardonius&#x27; uncle, father-in-law, and half-brother-in-law.

==Military career==
===First Persian invasion of Greece===

Darius appointed Mardonius as one of his generals and, after the Ionian Revolt, sent him in 492 BC to retaliate against the Greek city-state of Athens for assisting the Ionians. On his way to Athens, he used his army in the Ionian cities to depose the Greek tyrants and set up democratic governments, an action which surprised the Greeks at that time. Historians consider that he may have taken this action so that the Ionians would not revolt a second time after the Persian army had passed through. His fleet and army then passed across the Hellespont.

Mardonius first attacked Thasos, a Greek island which possessed gold mines. It became a tributary of the Achaemenid empire. The navy and the army continued onto Macedonia, which was soon added to the Persian Empire as a fully subordinate client kingdom, becoming also part of its administrative system.

However, after these victories, Mardonius’ fleet was destroyed in a storm off the coast near Mount Athos. According to Herodotus, the Persians lost 300 ships and 20,000 men. Around this time, Mardonius was commanding the army in a battle in Thrace. While Mardonius was wounded in the battle, he was victorious, re-subjugating Thrace into the empire. Nevertheless, the loss of the fleet meant that he had to retreat back into Asia Minor. He was relieved of his command by Darius, who appointed Datis and Artaphernes junior to lead the invasion of Greece in 490 BC, and though they were subsequently successful in capturing Naxos and destroying Eretria, they were later defeated at the Battle of Marathon.

===Second Persian invasion of Greece===

Mardonius came back into favour under Darius&#x27; successor Xerxes I, Mardonius&#x27; cousin and brother-in-law. Xerxes was at first not interested in renewing the war with Greece, but Mardonius, who had the most influence on Xerxes in all of Persia, repeatedly tried to convince him that he must avenge Darius&#x27; defeat. This view was opposed by another of Xerxes’ advisors, Artabanus, who urged more caution in the matter. Herodotus, who portrays Mardonius as a somewhat evil adviser (as opposed to a number of other good advisers whose arguments are never followed), says that Mardonius simply wanted to become satrap (governor) of Greece and had a love for &#x27;mischief and adventure&#x27;.

He was present at the Battle of Thermopylae, and after the Persian defeat at the Battle of Salamis, he attempted to convince Xerxes to stay and fight yet another campaign. This time Mardonius could not persuade Xerxes, but when Xerxes left he did become governor of those parts of Greece that had been conquered by the Persians. He subdued Macedon, ruled at that time by King Alexander I, but Alexander himself gave valuable information about Mardonius&#x27; plans to the Athenians, saying that, as a Greek, he could not bear to see Greece defeated. 

After the first part of the campaign directly under the orders Xerxes I, Mardonius remained in Greece with 300,000 elite troops, who fought in the last stages of the war, destroying Athens, but being finally vanquished at the Battle of Platea:

Mardonius captured and sacked Athens, which had been deserted before the Battle of Salamis. He offered to return Athens and help rebuild the city if the Athenians would accept a truce, but the Athenians rejected the truce and prepared for another battle.

====Battle of Plataea====
Mardonius prepared to meet them at Plataea, despite the opposition from another Persian commander, Artabazus, who, like Artabanus, did not think that the Persian army could automatically defeat the Greeks. Mardonius was killed in the ensuing battle by the Spartans (see Battle of Plataea). It is claimed by Herodotus and Plutarch a Spartan called Aeimnestus killed Mardonius. This led to his army breaking up.

Herodotus relates of the Spartan leader Pausanias’ response when an Aeginetan suggests mounting on a pole the head of the slain Persian general Mardonius, as Xerxes had wanted to do to Leonidas after the battle of Thermopylae—a suggestion taken by Pausanias to threaten the very root of civilization: &quot;Such doings befit barbarians rather than Greeks, and even in barbarians we detest them...Come not before me again with such a speech nor with such counsel, and thank my forbearance that you are not now punished&quot;.

<text>Bars (Latin: &quot;comitatus Barsiensis&quot;, Hungarian: &quot;Bars&quot;, Slovak: &quot;Tekov&quot;, German: &quot;Barsch&quot;) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in central and southern Slovakia. Today in Slovakia, Tekov is the informal designation of the corresponding territory.

==Geography==
Bars County shared borders with the Hungarian counties of , , , , and . It was situated along the Garam river between Hont in the east, Körmöcbánya and Felsőbesenyő in the north (which were part of the county), the Zsitva river in the west, and Zsitvabesenyő and Bény in the south (which was not part of the county). The rivers Garam and Zsitva ran through the county. The county was characterised by mining. Around 1910, its area was .

==Capitals==
The capital of the county was the Bars Castle, then the Léva Castle, then from the late 16th century Kistapolcsány and since the 18th century Aranyosmarót.

==History==
The county arose in the 11th century. The southern part of this county was occupied by Ottoman Empire between 1663 and 1685 and managed as Uyvar Eyalet by her. In the aftermath of World War I, the area became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia, as recognized by the concerned states in 1920 by the Treaty of Trianon.

Following the provisions of the First Vienna Award, the southern part of the area was returned to Hungary in November 1938. This was merged with the southern part of the former Hont county to form Bars-Hont county, with the capital Léva.

After World War II, the Trianon borders were restored and the area lay again completely in Czechoslovakia. In 1993, Czechoslovakia was split and Tekov became part of Slovakia.

<doc id="349726" wikidata="Q7833491" url="?curid=349726" title="Trans-Appalachia">
<text>Trans-Appalachia is an area in the United States bounded to the east by the Appalachian Mountains and extending west roughly to the Mississippi River. It spans from the Midwest to the Upper South. The term is used most frequently when referring to the area as a frontier in the 17th, 18th and 19th century. During this period, the region gained its own identity, defined by its isolation and separation from the rest of the United States to the east. It included much of Ohio Country and at least the northern and eastern parts of the Old Southwest. It was never an organized territory or other political unit. Most of what was referred to by this name became the states of western Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and western Virginia. It is still a vague and little used place name today.

Trans-Appalachia can be divided into four sub regions: 1) the Old Northwest Territory that encompasses the current states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota, 2) the Old Southwest Territory represented by the present states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, 3) Florida, and 4) the territory of upstate New York and southeast Canada.

A similar name, trans-Allegheny, has much the same usage (usually as an adjective) and refers to the Allegheny Mountains, the northern portion of the Appalachians.

== History ==
Beginning in the 18th century, as open land east of the Appalachian Mountains became increasingly scarce, the region started to receive significant numbers of migrants. The Appalachian mountains were bypassed for Trans-Appalachia&#x27;s better farmland and access to waterways.

Much of 18th century Trans-Appalachia, especially the Ohio River Valley, was defined by conflict over territory between the British, French, and Native Americans. Although the Proclamation of 1763 after the Seven Years War prohibited further settlement, significant migration to the region continued throughout the 1760s and 1770s. This caused further conflict with Native Americans, such as Pontiac&#x27;s War from 1763 to 1764. After the Revolutionary War, America formally acquired the land of Trans-Appalachia through peace treaties. This spurred a new wave of migration that would catapult the region to increasing prominence.

==Migration==

=== First Anglo-American Migrants ===
Starting in the mid-18th century, Americans who wanted to find a better life in the wilderness traveled several main roads over the Appalachians. Those from New England followed the Mohawk Trail into western New York. The travelers from Philadelphia took Forbes&#x27; Road to Pittsburgh, where they could travel west on the Ohio River. From Baltimore, they went to Pittsburgh on Braddock&#x27;s Road. Middle Atlantic settlers used Cumberland Road (the National Road). Southerners used either the Great Valley Road or the Richmond Road through the mountains to the Cumberland Gap. From there they could take the Wilderness Road northward into present day Kentucky and the Ohio Valley. Daniel Boone was hired by the Transylvania Company to cut the Wilderness Road.

=== Increasing trans-Appalachian populations ===

Between 1790 and 1810, around 98,000 slaves, along with their owners, moved west into the region south of the Ohio River (the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 had forbidden slavery in states north of the Ohio).
* By 1795, in Kentucky, 75,000
* By 1830, hundreds of thousands of settlers were in the region, which at that time consisted of Michigan Territory, and the new states of
** Ohio, with 1,000,000 inhabitants,
** Indiana, with almost 350,000 inhabitants, and
** Illinois, with more than 150,000 inhabitants.

<text>Turóc (Hungarian, historically also spelled &quot;Túrócz&quot;), , /&quot;comitatus Thurociensis&quot;, ) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in north-western Slovakia, where the corresponding Slovak name Turiec is only an informal designation of the corresponding territory.

==Geography==

Turóc county shared borders with the counties of Nyitra, Trencsén, Árva, Liptó, Zólyom and Bars, situated between the Lesser Fatra (Kis-Fátra) and Greater Fatra (Nagy-Fátra) Mountains. The river Turóc flowed through the county. Its area was 1123 km2 around 1910.

==Capitals==
The capitals of the Turóc county were the Szklabinya Castle and Turócszentmárton (present-day Martin; Slovak name until 1950: &quot;Turčiansky Svätý Martin&quot;); from 1772 only Turócszentmárton was the capital.

==History==
Turóc county as a Hungarian &quot;comitatus&quot; arose in the 14th century. In the aftermath of World War I, the area of the now defunct Turóc county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia, as recognized by the concerned states in 1920 by the Treaty of Trianon. The territory of the county is now part of Slovakia.

==Demographics==



==Subdivisions==

In the early 20th century, the subdivisions of Turóc county were:
*Lower Turóc – its center was Turócszentmárton and the subregion roughly corresponds to the present-day District of Martin
*Upper Turóc – its center was Stubnyafürdő and the subregion roughly corresponds to the present-day District of Turčianske Teplice

==Governors==

*Michael Reway de Rewa, &quot;comes&quot; ( 1569).
*Franciscus Revay ( 1638).
*Andrea Czeromanka de Tarno.
*Petrus de Reva, &quot;comes&quot; ( 1767).

<text>In computer networks, download means to &quot;receive&quot; data from a remote system, typically a server such as a web server, an FTP server, an email server, or other similar systems. This contrasts with uploading, where data is &quot;sent to&quot; a remote server.
A &quot;download&quot; is a file offered for downloading or that has been downloaded, or the process of receiving such a file.

==Definition==
Downloading generally transfers entire files for local storage and later use, as contrasted with streaming, where the data is used nearly immediately while the transmission is still in progress and may not be stored long-term. Websites that offer streaming media or media displayed in-browser, such as YouTube, increasingly place restrictions on the ability of users to save these materials to their computers after they have been received.

Downloading on computer networks involves retrieving data from a remote system, like a web server, FTP server, or email server, unlike uploading, where data is sent to a remote server. A download can refer to a file made available for retrieval or one that has been received, encompassing the entire process of obtaining such a file.

Downloading is not the same as data transfer; moving or copying data between two storage devices would be data transfer, but &quot;receiving&quot; data from the &quot;Internet&quot; or BBS is &quot;downloading&quot;.

==Copyright==
Downloading media files involves the use of linking and framing Internet material and relates to copyright law. Streaming and downloading can involve making copies of works that infringe on copyrights or other rights, and organizations running such websites may become vicariously liable for copyright infringement by causing others to do so.

Open hosting servers allow people to upload files to a central server, which incurs bandwidth and hard disk space costs due to the files generated with each download. Anonymous and open hosting servers make it difficult to hold hosts accountable. Taking legal action against the technologies behind unauthorized &quot;file sharing&quot; has proven successful for centralized networks like Napster, and untenable for decentralized networks like Gnutella or BitTorrent. The leading YouTube audio-ripping site agreed to shut down after being sued by a huge coalition of recording labels.

Downloading and streaming relates to the more general usage of the Internet to facilitate copyright infringement, also known as &quot;software piracy&quot;. As overt static hosting of unauthorized copies of works (i.e., centralized networks) is often quickly and uncontroversially rebuffed, legal issues have in recent years tended to deal with the usage of dynamic web technologies (decentralized networks, trackless BitTorrents) to circumvent the ability of copyright owners to directly engage particular distributors and consumers.

===Litigations in European Union===

In Europe, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has ruled that it is legal to create temporary or cached copies of works (copyrighted or otherwise) online. The ruling relates to the British Meltwater case settled on 5 June 2014.

The judgement of the court states that: &quot;Article 5 of Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society must be interpreted as meaning that the copies on the user&#x27;s computer screen and the copies in the internet &#x27;cache&#x27; of that computer&#x27;s hard disk, made by an end-user in the course of viewing a website, satisfy the conditions that those copies must be temporary, that they must be transient or incidental in nature and that they must constitute an integral and essential part of a technological process, as well as the conditions laid down in Article 5(5) of that directive, and that they may therefore be made without the authorisation of the copyright holders.&quot;

On April 17, 2009, a Swedish court convicted four men operating The Pirate Bay Internet site of criminal copyright infringement. The Pirate Bay was established in 2003 by the Swedish anti-copyright organization Piratbyrån to provide information needed to download film or music files from third parties, many of whom copied the files without permission. The Pirate Bay does not store copies of the files on its own servers but does provide peer-to-peer links to other servers on which infringing copies were stored. Apparently, the theory of the prosecution was that the defendants, by their conduct, actively induced infringement. Under U.S. copyright law, this would be a so-called &quot;Grokster&quot; theory of infringement liability.

The Swedish district court imposed damages of SEK 30 million ($3,600,000) and one-year prison sentences on the four defendants. &quot;The defendants have furthered the crimes that the file sharers have committed,&quot; said district court judge Tomas Norstöm. He added, &quot;They have been helpful to such an extent that they have entered into the field of criminal liability.&quot; &quot;We are, of course, going to appeal,&quot; defense lawyer Per Samuelsson said. The Pirate Bay has 25 million users and is considered one of the biggest file-sharing websites in the world. It is conceded that The Pirate Bay does not itself make copies or store files, but the court did not consider that fact dispositive. &quot;By providing a website with ... well-developed search functions, easy uploading and storage possibilities, and with a tracker linked to the website, the accused have incited the crimes that the filesharers have committed,&quot; the court said in a statement.

<doc id="349735" wikidata="Q110346" url="?curid=349735" title="Baryon number">
<text>In particle physics, the baryon number is a strictly conserved additive quantum number of a system. It is defined as
formula_1
where is the number of quarks, and is the number of antiquarks. Baryons (three quarks) have a baryon number of +1, mesons (one quark, one antiquark) have a baryon number of 0, and antibaryons (three antiquarks) have a baryon number of −1. Exotic hadrons like pentaquarks (four quarks, one antiquark) and tetraquarks (two quarks, two antiquarks) are also classified as baryons and mesons depending on their baryon number.

== Baryon number vs. quark number ==
Quarks carry not only electric charge, but also charges such as color charge and weak isospin. Because of a phenomenon known as &quot;color confinement&quot;, a hadron cannot have a net color charge; that is, the total color charge of a particle has to be zero (&quot;white&quot;). A quark can have one of three &quot;colors&quot;, dubbed &quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, and &quot;blue&quot;; while an antiquark may be either &quot;anti-red&quot;, &quot;anti-green&quot; or &quot;anti-blue&quot;.

For normal hadrons, a white color can thus be achieved in one of three ways: 
* A quark of one color with an antiquark of the corresponding anticolor, giving a meson with baryon number 0,
* Three quarks of different colors, giving a baryon with baryon number +1,
* Three antiquarks of different anticolors, giving an antibaryon with baryon number −1.

The baryon number was defined long before the quark model was established, so rather than changing the definitions, particle physicists simply gave quarks one third the baryon number. Nowadays it might be more accurate to speak of the conservation of quark number.

In theory, exotic hadrons can be formed by adding pairs of quarks and antiquarks, provided that each pair has a matching color/anticolor. For example, a pentaquark (four quarks, one antiquark) could have the individual quark colors: red, green, blue, blue, and antiblue. In 2015, the LHCb collaboration at CERN reported results consistent with pentaquark states in the decay of bottom Lambda baryons ().

== Particles not formed of quarks ==

Particles without any quarks have a baryon number of zero. Such particles are
* leptons – the electron, muon, tauon, and their corresponding neutrinos
* vector bosons – the photon, W and Z bosons, gluons
* scalar boson – the Higgs boson 
* second-order tensor boson – the hypothetical graviton

== Conservation ==
The baryon number is conserved in all the interactions of the Standard Model, with one possible exception. The conservation is due to formula_2 global symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian. &#x27;Conserved&#x27; means that the sum of the baryon number of all incoming particles is the same as the sum of the baryon numbers of all particles resulting from the reaction. The one exception is the hypothesized Adler–Bell–Jackiw anomaly in electroweak interactions; however, sphalerons are not all that common and could occur at high energy and temperature levels and can explain electroweak baryogenesis and leptogenesis. Electroweak sphalerons can only change the baryon and/or lepton number by 3 or multiples of 3 (collision of three baryons into three leptons/antileptons and vice versa). No experimental evidence of sphalerons has yet been observed.

The hypothetical concepts of grand unified theory (GUT) models and supersymmetry allows for the changing of a baryon into leptons and antiquarks (see &quot;B&quot; − &quot;L&quot;), thus violating the conservation of both baryon and lepton numbers. Proton decay would be an example of such a process taking place, but has never been observed.

The conservation of baryon number is not consistent with the physics of black hole evaporation via Hawking radiation. It is expected in general that quantum gravitational effects violate the conservation of all charges associated to global symmetries. The violation of conservation of baryon number led John Archibald Wheeler to speculate on a principle of mutability for all physical properties.

<text>William Payne Stewart (January 30, 1957 – October 25, 1999) was an American professional golfer who won 11 PGA Tour events, including three major championships, the last of which came just a few months before his death in an airplane accident at the age of 42.

Stewart gained his first major title at the 1989 PGA Championship. He won the 1991 U.S. Open after a playoff against Scott Simpson. At the 1999 U.S. Open Stewart captured his third major title after holing a par putt on the final hole for a one-stroke victory.

Stewart was a popular golfer with spectators, who responded enthusiastically to his distinctive clothing. He was reputed to have the biggest wardrobe of all professional golfers and was a favorite of photographers because of his flamboyant attire of ivy caps and patterned pants, which were a cross between plus fours and knickerbockers, a throwback to the once-commonplace golf &quot;uniform&quot;. Stewart was also admired for having one of the most gracefully fluid and stylish golf swings of the modern era.

==Early life==
Stewart was born and raised in Springfield, Missouri, and attended Greenwood Laboratory School, a K–12 school on the campus of Missouri State University. He played collegiate golf at Southern Methodist University in University Park, Texas, where he was a member of Phi Gamma Delta, and graduated in 1979.

==Professional career==
Stewart failed to earn a PGA Tour card at Qualifying School in his graduation year, so he played on the Asia Golf Circuit for a couple of years. He won two tournaments in 1981, including the Indonesia Open in a playoff over three players. Later that year, he earned his PGA Tour card for 1982 and won his first title on the tour at that year&#x27;s Quad Cities Open. This win was especially memorable to him because it was the only time his father, Bill, saw him win. Stewart&#x27;s father had played in the 1955 U.S. Open, and had introduced his son to the game.

In 1983, Stewart gained his second PGA Tour victory by winning the Walt Disney World Golf Classic by two strokes. At the 1985 Byron Nelson Golf Classic, Stewart came to the 72nd hole with a three-shot lead. Moments after Bob Eastwood birdied the final hole of regulation, Stewart took a double bogey to end the tournament tied for first. Stewart then made another double bogey on the first playoff hole, causing him to lose to Eastwood.

In 1985, Stewart came close to winning The Open Championship, when he finished one stroke behind the champion Sandy Lyle.

Stewart briefly led the U.S. Open in 1986 during the back nine of the final round at Shinnecock Hills. After birdieing the 11th and 12th, Stewart took a one-shot lead, but he then had bogeys at the 13th and 14th, finishing the tournament tied for sixth place, behind the winner Raymond Floyd.

Stewart had four runner-up finishes on the PGA Tour in 1986. Despite not winning a tournament that year, he had the most top-10 finishes of any player on the PGA Tour, finishing inside the top-10 sixteen times.

Another runner-up finish came in early 1987 at the AT&amp;T at Pebble Beach, after leading by two shots after 54 holes. Six weeks later, Stewart won the Hertz Bay Hill Classic in Orlando, Florida, shooting a third round of 63 and a final round of 65 to beat South African David Frost by three shots. It was a two-man duel in the final round, as Frost finished eight shots ahead of the third-place finisher Dan Pohl. Stewart&#x27;s victory was a memorable one to him as it came on his home course. His house was situated adjacent to the 12th tee of the Bay Hill Club course in Orlando, Florida. Stewart&#x27;s cumulative tournament score of 264 is, to date, still a record for the lowest aggregate score over 72 holes in the event, which later became known as the &quot;Arnold Palmer Invitational&quot; held at the same Bay Hill venue. Stewart donated his $108,000 winner&#x27;s share to a Florida hospital in memory of his father, who died of cancer in 1985.

Stewart had two runner-up finishes on the PGA Tour in 1988, at The Honda Classic and the Provident Classic.

In April 1989, Stewart won the MCI Heritage Golf Classic by five strokes, with a then tournament-record score of 268, 16-under-par. His victory at the Heritage Classic was his 18th top-10 finish on the PGA Tour since his previous win at the Bay Hill Classic in March 1987. Stewart was gaining a reputation for being one of the most consistent players on the PGA Tour and one of the best players in the world not yet to have won a major championship at that point.

At Kemper Lakes Golf Club, Stewart won the PGA Championship in 1989, his first major title. At the start of the final round, Stewart was six shots behind the leader Mike Reid. He made up five strokes in the final three holes to overtake Reid and win by a stroke. Stewart&#x27;s back-nine of 31 included birdies on four of his last five holes. He was able to gain the lead over Reid, who bogeyed the 16th, double-bogeyed the 17th, and missed a seven-foot (2 m) birdie putt on the 18th, which would have forced a playoff. After the tournament, Stewart said: &quot;This is a dream I&#x27;ve been trying to realize for a long time.&quot; Reid shed tears and said: &quot;As disappointed as I am, I&#x27;m happy for Payne.&quot;

The following year, Stewart became the first player to win back-to-back titles at the MCI Heritage Golf Classic at Harbour Town Golf Links, winning a playoff against Larry Mize and Steve Jones on the second extra hole with an birdie putt. This was his first playoff win on the PGA Tour, having lost all five of his playoffs in the 1980s. In May 1990, Stewart won his second tournament of the year at the GTE Byron Nelson Golf Classic. As a result of this victory and runner-up finishes at the Western Open and 1990 Open Championship Stewart reached his Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) peak of number 3 in the summer of 1990. At the end of 1990, Stewart was ranked as the fifth-best golfer in the world on the OWGR. Overall, Stewart spent nearly 250 weeks within the top 10 of the OWGR between 1986, the year the OWGR began, and 1999, the year of his death.

Stewart&#x27;s second major title came at the 1991 U.S. Open after an 18-hole Monday playoff with Scott Simpson on a windblown Hazeltine National Golf Club course in Minnesota. Stewart was two shots behind Simpson going into the final three holes of the playoff. After the 16th hole, the match was squared, as Stewart holed a birdie putt and Simpson missed a par putt. Stewart&#x27;s par on the 18th hole won the playoff by two strokes.

The following month, Stewart won the 1991 Heineken Dutch Open by nine shots, which included a course record of 62 in the third round. Stewart won the Hassan II Golf Trophy in Morocco in 1992 and 1993.

In 1993 at Royal St George&#x27;s Golf Club in England, Stewart&#x27;s fourth round of 63 tied the record for the lowest individual round in The Open Championship. He was one of 10 players, until Branden Grace shot a 62 in 2017, to hold the record for shooting a 63 at the British Open. In 1995, Stewart gained his first U.S. PGA Tour win in four years by winning the Shell Houston Open in a playoff over Scott Hoch, who lost a six-shot lead with seven holes to play. Hoch collapsed on the back-nine with three bogeys and a double-bogey on the 17th when his tee shot found water. Stewart won the playoff on the first extra hole.

In the 1998 U.S. Open at Olympic Club in San Francisco, Stewart had a four-shot lead going into the final round, but lost to Lee Janzen by a stroke. Stewart missed a 25-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole of his final round, which would have forced a playoff with Janzen.

The following year at the 1999 U.S. Open at Pinehurst Resort, Stewart won his last major title, memorably holing a 15-foot par putt that defeated Phil Mickelson by a stroke in the final round when Tiger Woods and Vijay Singh were also in contention for the trophy. Stewart credited his winning putt to being more at peace with himself after his strengthened religious belief. A statue of Stewart celebrates his winning putt behind the 18th green of the No. 2 course at Pinehurst Resort.

At the time of his death, Stewart was ranked third on the all-time money list and in the top 10 of the Official World Golf Ranking – he had been ranked in the top 10 for almost 250 weeks from 1986 to 1993, and again in 1999. At a time of international domination of the golf scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s, he was often the highest-ranked American player. At the time of his death, Stewart had won $12,673,193 in career earnings. He won over $2 million during the 1999 season and finished seventh on the year&#x27;s money list.

Stewart represented the United States on five Ryder Cup teams (1987, 1989, 1991, 1993, and 1999). He also played for the U.S. on three World Cup teams. His Ryder cup record was 8–9–2. Stewart was known for his patriotic passion for the Ryder Cup, once saying of his European opponents, &quot;On paper, they should be caddying for us.&quot; The United States team was 3–1–1 during the five times he played. He was disappointed to miss out in 1995 and 1997 when he failed to qualify automatically and was not chosen as a captain&#x27;s pick. In the 1999 Ryder Cup, Stewart criticized the heckling of European player Colin Montgomerie. With victory assured for the United States, Stewart conceded a putt (and his own singles match) to Montgomerie on the 18th hole. &quot;This game is about sportsmanship,&quot; Stewart said afterward.

Stewart was a golfing traditionalist, who once said: &quot;In the United States, all we do is play the ball in the air.&quot; He gained an affection for links golf, becoming a popular figure in Ireland after playing on Irish courses to warm up for The Open Championship. After he died in 1999, Waterville Golf Links in County Kerry, Ireland, commissioned a bronze statue of Stewart to pay tribute to him and his affiliation with Waterville. Stewart historically played well in The Open Championship, finishing runner-up in 1985 and 1990. In general, he was known to play well internationally, posting victories at the 1981 Indian Open, the 1981 Indonesia Open, and Japan Golf Tour&#x27;s 1985 Jun Classic. He also played in international tournaments that were less obscure for American golfers, posting runners-up at the 1982 Australian Open, 1989 German Masters, and the 1993 Scottish Open. He also won the 1991 Dutch Open.

For a large part of his career, Stewart was known for his National Football League (NFL) sponsorship, whereby he wore the team colors of the geographically closest NFL franchise; the sponsorship ended in May 1995.

== Personal life ==
Stewart met Tracey Ferguson, sister of Australian golfer Mike Ferguson, in Kuala Lumpur in 1980 while he was playing on the Asia Golf Circuit, and they were married by November 1982.

Stewart was also a musician, and played harmonica in the blues rock group Jake Trout and the Flounders, which also included fellow golfers Larry Rinker and Peter Jacobsen. The band released one album, &quot;I Love to Play&quot; in 1998. The music video for the title track, a golf-themed parody of Randy Newman&#x27;s &quot;I Love L.A.&quot;, earned rotation on VH-1.

Stewart appeared on an episode of the American television sitcom &quot;Home Improvement&quot; titled &quot;Futile Attraction&quot;, which aired on March 10, 1998, and featured Stewart as himself.

==Death==

On October 25, 1999, Stewart was killed in the crash of a Learjet flying from his home in Orlando, Florida, to Texas for the year-ending tournament, The Tour Championship, held at Champions Golf Club in Houston. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators concluded that the aircraft failed to pressurize and that all on board were incapacitated by hypoxia as the aircraft passed to the west of Gainesville, Florida. The aircraft continued flying on autopilot until it ran out of fuel and crashed into a field near Mina, South Dakota.

===Legacy===

At that week&#x27;s tournament, The Tour Championship, Stewart&#x27;s good friend, Stuart Appleby, organized a tribute to his friend. With Stewart&#x27;s wife&#x27;s permission, he wore one of Payne&#x27;s own signature outfits for the final round of the tournament on Sunday, and most of the rest of the golfers in the field wore &quot;short pants&quot; that day, as well.
The tournament had been delayed in order to allow those who would be competing in it to attend Stewart&#x27;s memorial service at the First Baptist Church of Orlando on October 30. Speakers included Tracey Stewart and Paul Azinger, both a fellow professional and one of Stewart&#x27;s close friends, while attendees included Woods, Mickelson, Jack Nicklaus, Greg Norman, Davis Love III, Hal Sutton, Justin Leonard and Fred Couples, along with MLB pitcher Orel Hershiser, another friend of Stewart&#x27;s.

One year after Stewart&#x27;s death, his widow Tracey and their two children, and the family of Stewart&#x27;s agent, Robert Fraley, who also died on that flight, brought a lawsuit against Learjet, flight operator SunJet Aviation, Inc., and aircraft owner JetShares One Inc. They alleged that a cracked adapter resulted in an airflow valve detaching from the frame, causing a fatal loss of cabin pressure. They also claimed that the aircraft was severely out of maintenance because of SunJet&#x27;s negligence. In April 2000 as part of a federal criminal investigation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided SunJet and seized its flight logbooks, effectively grounding all of its aircraft. The investigation was dropped in 2002, but it was too late to save SunJet; unable to legally operate, it had filed for bankruptcy protection in June 2000. The case against Learjet went forward in state court in Orlando. In June 2005, jurors found that the aircraft&#x27;s manufacturer had no liability in the deaths of Stewart and Fraley and that no negligence was found in the design or manufacture of the aircraft.

The segment of Interstate 44 passing through Springfield, Missouri, was designated the &quot;Payne Stewart Memorial Highway&quot; in his memory. Payne Stewart Drive in Fullerton, California, and Payne Stewart Drive in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, leading into Northview golf course designed by Arnold Palmer, were named after him. Finally, Payne Stewart Drive in Jacksonville, Florida, houses The First Tee along with a Job Corps center.

The communities of Mina and Aberdeen created their own memorial. Jon Hoffman, the owner of the property where the aircraft crashed, contacted Stewart&#x27;s widow and several family members of other crash victims. All agreed that the memorial would be a rock from the crash site, engraved with the victims&#x27; names and a Bible passage. Hoffman fenced in about an acre (4,000 m2) of the property surrounding the memorial.

In 2000, the PGA Tour established the Payne Stewart Award, given each year to a player who shows respect for the traditions of the game, commitment to uphold the game&#x27;s heritage of charitable support and professional and meticulous presentation of himself and the sport through his dress and conduct. At Pinehurst No. 2, a bronze statue of Stewart celebrating his winning putt in the 1999 U.S. Open there overlooks the 18th green. On the first day of the 2014 U.S. Open, the second time that Pinehurst No. 2 had hosted the tournament since 1999, Rickie Fowler wore plus fours and argyle socks in tribute to Stewart.

Also, at the 2000 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, where Stewart would have been the defending champion, further tributes were paid. Firstly, on the eve of the tournament, there was another memorial at the 18th hole where speakers again included Tracey Stewart and Azinger. This time, the attendees included Stewart&#x27;s old caddy Mike Hicks plus other professionals due to compete in the tournament such as Mickelson, Love, David Duval, Tom Lehman, Lee Janzen and Sergio García, and it concluded with shots being hit into Stillwater Cove in a golf version of a 21-gun salute. The next day, when Stewart&#x27;s defending champion spot in the traditional initial pairings alongside the Open Championship winner (Paul Lawrie) and U.S. Amateur winner (David Gossett) was given to Nicklaus playing in his 44th consecutive and final U.S. Open, Nicklaus asked for a moment of silence before his opening tee shot. García also wore Stewart&#x27;s trademark navy plus fours in his honor during his first round.

In tribute to Stewart, as well as his southwestern Missouri roots, the Payne Stewart Golf Club was opened in Branson, Missouri, in June 2009 with the approval of Stewart&#x27;s widow. Ground-breaking on the $31 million layout took place on July 24, 2006. The 7,319-yard, 18-hole course was designed by Bobby Clampett and Chuck Smith. Each hole on the course is named for some aspect or notable moment in Stewart&#x27;s life. The fifth hole, for example, named &quot;Road Hole&quot;, recounts the par Stewart made in the first round of the 1990 Open Championship at Old Course at St Andrews when he was forced to knock his third shot against the wall behind the green at the Old Course&#x27;s treacherous 17th. His ball finished just on the back fringe from where he chipped in. Later in 2020, Woods christened the first public course by him and his company TGR Design at Big Cedar Lodge near Branson as Payne&#x27;s Valley in Stewart&#x27;s honor.

On the 10th anniversary of Stewart&#x27;s death in 2009, Golf Channel presented a special program to remember his life. It included recorded interviews with family, friends, and archived videos of his golf career.

<text>The Minnesota Experimental City (MXC) was a proposed planned community to be located in northern Minnesota (near Swatara in Aitkin County). Proposed and studied beginning in the 1960s, it would have been constructed as a public–private partnership. In contrast with many of the model cities of the time, the MXC was to be experimental, trying new things rather than proposing to select from the best of the existing practice. The project was initiated and directed by scientist and University of Minnesota dean Athelstan Spilhaus, and reflected the confidence of that era in the ability of science and technology to solve the world&#x27;s problems -- &quot;If we could send a human into space, we could do anything&quot; -- and concern that existing cities were failing, blighted by crime, decay and exodus of the well-off to the suburbs.

Supporting MXC were Otto Silha, publisher of the two largest newspapers in the state, the Minneapolis Star and Minneapolis Tribune, a four-star general; the physician of president at the time Lyndon B. Johnson; civil rights leader Muriel S. Snowden; and Buckminster Fuller. MXC received approximately $250,000 in federal government funds thanks to the support of former Minnesota senator and vice-president Hubert Humphrey. The Boeing corporation, Ford Motor Company and Honeywell International Inc. &quot;pledged to invest&quot;.

The city was designed for 250,000 people over . In the plan, only 1/6 of the area would be paved, the remainder would be open space: parks, wilderness, and farms. Under the influence of Buckminster Fuller who sat on the MXC&#x27;s advisory board, the plan called for the MXC to be partially enclosed by a geodesic dome. It would contain a branch of the University of Minnesota and 3M Corporation.

Among other proposed features were: 
* a pedestrian zone, cars were to be parked on the edge with a people-mover connecting them to the center. An automated highway system would connect the town with the outside world.
* no schools. The city itself would foster lifelong learning, with everyone both a student and teacher.
* waterless toilets.

==Demise==
The end of MXC was &quot;abrupt&quot;. The Minnesota legislature created a Minnesota Experimental City Authority in 1971. It was given the job of finding a site for MXC by 1973. After some months it chose undeveloped land in Aitkin County, a little over 100 miles north of Minneapolis. Unfortunately for the proposed city, local residents became &quot;outspoken critics&quot;, claiming the city would bring urban pollution to their area.
In August 1973 the Minnesota state legislature eliminated the MXC authority&#x27;s funding.

In October 2017, roughly 50 years after talk of the city began, a documentary film about MXC, &quot;The Experimental City&quot;, directed by Chad Freidrichs, premiered at the Chicago International Film Festival.

<doc id="349755" wikidata="Q1202673" url="?curid=349755" title="Uniform norm">
<text>In mathematical analysis, the uniform norm (or ) assigns, to real- or complex-valued bounded functions defined on a set , the non-negative number
:formula_1

This norm is also called the , the , the , or, when the supremum is in fact the maximum, the . The name &quot;uniform norm&quot; derives from the fact that a sequence of functions converges to under the metric derived from the uniform norm if and only if converges to uniformly.

If is a continuous function on a closed and bounded interval, or more generally a compact set, then it is bounded and the supremum in the above definition is attained by the Weierstrass extreme value theorem, so we can replace the supremum by the maximum. In this case, the norm is also called the .
In particular, if is some vector such that formula_2 in finite dimensional coordinate space, it takes the form:
:formula_3
This is called the formula_4-norm.

== Definition ==
Uniform norms are defined, in general, for bounded functions valued in a normed space. Let formula_5 be a set and let formula_6 be a normed space. On the set formula_7 of functions from formula_5 to formula_9, there is an extended norm defined by
:formula_10
This is in general an extended norm since the function formula_11 may not be bounded. Restricting this extended norm to the bounded functions (i.e., the functions with finite above extended norm) yields a (finite-valued) norm, called the uniform norm on formula_7. Note that the definition of uniform norm does not rely on any additional structure on the set formula_5, although in practice formula_5 is often at least a topological space.

The convergence on formula_7 in the topology induced by the uniform extended norm is the uniform convergence, for sequences, and also for nets and filters on formula_7.

We can define closed sets and closures of sets with respect to this metric topology; closed sets in the uniform norm are sometimes called &quot;uniformly closed&quot; and closures &quot;uniform closures&quot;. The uniform closure of a set of functions A is the space of all functions that can be approximated by a sequence of uniformly-converging functions on formula_17 For instance, one restatement of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem is that the set of all continuous functions on formula_18 is the uniform closure of the set of polynomials on formula_19

For complex continuous functions over a compact space, this turns it into a C* algebra (cf. Gelfand representation).

== Weaker structures inducing the topology of uniform convergence ==
=== Uniform metric ===

The uniform metric between two bounded functions formula_20 from a set formula_5 to a metric space formula_22 is defined by
:formula_23
The uniform metric is also called the , after Pafnuty Chebyshev, who was first to systematically study it. In this case, formula_11 is bounded precisely if formula_25 is finite for some constant function formula_26. If we allow unbounded functions, this formula does not yield a norm or metric in a strict sense, although the obtained so-called extended metric still allows one to define a topology on the function space in question; the convergence is then still the uniform convergence. In particular, a sequence formula_27 converges uniformly to a function formula_11 if and only if
formula_29

If formula_6 is a normed space, then it is a metric space in a natural way. The extended metric on formula_7 induced by the uniform extended norm is the same as the uniform extended metric
:formula_32
on formula_7

=== Uniformity of uniform convergence ===

Let formula_5 be a set and let formula_35 be a uniform space. A sequence formula_36 of functions from formula_5 to formula_9 is said to converge uniformly to a function formula_11 if for each entourage formula_40 there is a natural number formula_41 such that, formula_42 belongs to formula_43 whenever formula_44 and formula_45. Similarly for a net. This is a convergence in a topology on formula_7. In fact, the sets
:formula_47
where formula_43 runs through entourages of formula_9 form a fundamental system of entourages of a uniformity on formula_7, called the uniformity of uniform convergence on formula_7. The uniform convergence is precisely the convergence under its uniform topology.

If formula_22 is a metric space, then it is by default equipped with the metric uniformity. The metric uniformity on formula_7 with respect to the uniform extended metric is then the uniformity of uniform convergence on formula_7.

==Properties==

The set of vectors whose infinity norm is a given constant, formula_55 forms the surface of a hypercube with edge length formula_56

The reason for the subscript “formula_57” is that whenever formula_11 is continuous and formula_59 for some formula_60, then
formula_61
where
formula_62
where formula_63 is the domain of formula_11; the integral amounts to a sum if formula_63 is a discrete set (see &quot;p&quot;-norm).

<text>This is a list of cities and towns in Slovakia, called &quot;mestá&quot; (singular &quot;mesto&quot;) in Slovak. Although &quot;mesto&quot; is variously translated into English as &quot;town&quot; or &quot;city&quot;, there is no such legal distinction in Slovak.

As of 25 September 2019, there were 141 cities (&quot;miest&quot;) in Slovakia. (For German and Hungarian names of these towns, which are used by the respective ethnic minorities, see articles list of German exonyms for places in Slovakia and list of Hungarian exonyms for places in Slovakia).

<text>The Kura, also known in Georgian as Mtkvari, is an east-flowing transboundary river south of the Greater Caucasus Mountains which drains the southern slopes of the Greater Caucasus east into the Caspian Sea. It also drains the north side of the Lesser Caucasus, while its main tributary, the Aras, drains the south side of those mountains. Starting in northeastern Turkey, the Kura flows through to Georgia, then into Azerbaijan, where it receives the Aras as a right tributary, and finally enters the Caspian Sea. The total length of the river is .

People have inhabited the Caucasus region for thousands of years and first established agriculture in the Kura Valley over 4,500 years ago. Large, complex civilizations eventually grew on the river, but by 1200 CE most were reduced to ruin by natural disasters and foreign invaders. The increasing human use, and eventual damage, of the watershed&#x27;s forests and grasslands, contributed to a rising intensity of floods through the 20th century. In the 1950s, the Soviet Union started building many dams and canals on the river. Previously navigable up to Tbilisi in Georgia, the Kura is now much slower and shallower, having been harnessed by irrigation projects and hydroelectric power stations. The river is now moderately polluted by major industrial centers like Tbilisi and Rustavi in Georgia.

==Etymology==
The name Kura is related either to Mingrelian &quot;kur&quot; &#x27;water, river&#x27; or to an ancient Caucasian Albanian language term for &#x27;reservoir&#x27;. The Georgian name of Kura is &quot;Mt&#x27;k&#x27;vari&quot; (in old Georgian &quot;Mt&#x27;k&#x27;uari&quot;), either from Georgian &quot;good water&quot; or a Georgianized form of Megrelian &quot;tkvar-ua&quot; &quot;gnaw&quot; (as in, &quot;river that eats its way through the mountains&quot;). The name Kura was adopted first by the Russians and later by European cartographers. In some definitions of Europe, the Kura defines the borderline between Europe and Asia.

In the various regional languages, the river is known as: , , &quot;Mt’k’vari&quot;, Persian: Korr, &quot;Kour&quot;, and . In Greek and Latin sources of antiquity, the river was known as the &quot;Cyrus&quot; river; ; , as attested by Strabo and Pliny respectively. Bundahishn, a Zoroastrian source written in Book Pahlavi, refers to the river as &quot;Tord&quot; in Persian.

The river should not be confused with the Kura river in Russia, a westward flowing tributary of the Malka in Stavropol Krai; the Kur near Kursk, Russia; Kur near Khabarovsk, also in Russia and Kor River, which is located in Fars province, Iran.

==Course==
It rises in northeastern Turkey in a small valley in the Kars Upland of the Lesser Caucasus. It flows west, then north and east past Ardahan, and crosses into Georgia. It arcs to the northwest, then into a canyon near Akhaltsikhe where it starts to run northeast in a gorge for about , spilling out of the mountains near Khashuri. It then arcs east before flowing east-southeast for about , past Gori, then near Mtskheta, flows south through a short canyon and along the west side of T&#x27;bilisi, the largest city in the region. The river flows steeply southeast past Rustavi and turns eastward at its confluence with the Khrami, crossing the Georgia-Azerbaijan border and flowing across grasslands into Shemkir reservoir and then Yenikend reservoir.

The Kura then empties into Mingachevir reservoir, the largest body of water in Azerbaijan, formed by a dam near its namesake town at the southeastern end. The rivers Iori (also known as Qabirri) and Alazani formerly joined the Kura, but their mouths are now submerged under the lake. After leaving the dam, the river meanders southeast where it meets its biggest tributary Tartarchay in Barda Rayon and continues across a broad irrigated plain for several hundred kilometers, turning east near Lake Sarysu, and shortly after, receives the Aras, the largest tributary, at the city of Sabirabad. At the Aras confluence it makes a large arc to the north and then flows almost due south for about , passing the west side of Shirvan National Park, before turning east and emptying into the Caspian Sea at Neftçala.

==Basin==
Most of the Kura runs in the broad and deep valley between the Greater Caucasus and Lesser Caucasus Mountains, and the major tributary, the Aras, drains most of the southern Caucasus and the mountain ranges of the extreme northern Middle East. The entirety of Armenia and most of Azerbaijan are drained by the river. Most of the elevation change in the river occurs within the first . While the river starts at above sea level, the elevation is by the time it reaches Khashuri in central Georgia, just out of the mountains, and only when it reaches Azerbaijan.

The lower part of the river flows through the Kura-Aras Lowland, which covers most of central Azerbaijan and abuts the Caspian Sea. The Kura is the third largest, after the Volga and Ural, of the rivers that flow into the Caspian. Its delta is the fourth largest among the rivers that flow into the Caspian Sea, and is divided into three main sections, or &quot;sleeves&quot;, composed of sediment the river deposited during different periods of time. Before 1998, the river flowed all the way to the tip of the delta, where it discharged into the Caspian. In that year, the river escaped its channel and started to flow off to the west, leaving the last few kilometers abandoned. The course change is believed to be the result of a rise in the level of the Caspian Sea coupled with a major flood of the Kura.

About of the river is in Turkey, in Georgia, and in Azerbaijan.
About of the catchment is in Turkey, in Armenia, in Georgia, in Azerbaijan, and about are in Iran. At the confluence with the Aras River, the drainage area of the tributary is actually larger than the Kura by about 4%, and it is also longer. However, because of the more arid conditions and equally intensive water use, the discharge of the Aras is much less than the Kura, so downstream of the confluence the river is still called the Kura. About 52% of the river&#x27;s flow comes from snowmelt and glaciers, 30% comes from groundwater seepage, and roughly 18% from precipitation. Because of high water use, many of the smaller tributaries of the Kura no longer reach the river, instead disappearing in the plain many kilometers from their original mouths.

==Ecology==

Steppe characterizes the arid reaches of the Kura catchment, while meadows are often found in the alpine areas. The Kura catchment area is considered as part of the Kura-South Caspian Sea Drainages ecoregion. Some portions of the river flow through a semi-desert environment. Forest cover is sparse. Almost 60 species of fish inhabit the Kura and its tributaries. Some common families include loach, bleak, trout and nase, and many of these fish are endemic to the region. Among rivers of the Caucasus, the Kura has the largest number of endemic species. The upper section of the river supports much more biodiversity than the lower half, which is typically more turbid and polluted. This pattern is also apparent in most of its tributaries, especially the larger ones that span more climate zones, such as the Aras and Alazani. There are many lakes and wetlands along the Kura&#x27;s lower course, most of which are formed by flooding, and some of which are formed by irrigation runoff water. Many lakes also form at the mouths of small tributaries that do not reach the ultimate destination in the Caspian most of the time. The local name for these lakes translate to &quot;dead lake&quot; or &quot;dead water&quot;, suggesting that these lakes do not support much biodiversity.

==Economy and human use==

Formerly navigable up to Tbilisi, the largest city on the river, the amount of water in the Kura has greatly diminished in the 20th century because of extensive use for irrigation, municipal water, and hydroelectricity generation. The Kura is regarded as one of the most stressed river basins in Asia. Most of the water comes from snowmelt and infrequent precipitation in the mountains, which leads to severe floods and an abundance of water for a short time of the year (generally in June and July), and a relatively low sustainable baseflow. Forest cover is sparse, especially in the Kura and Aras headwaters, and most of the water that falls on the highlands becomes runoff instead of supplying groundwater. Attempts at flood control include the constructions of levees, dikes and dams, the largest of which is at Mingachevir, an -high rockfill dam impounding over of water. However, because of the high sediment content of rivers in the Kura basin, the effectiveness of these floodworks is limited and decreases every year.

Irrigation agriculture has been one of the primary economic mainstays of the lower Kura valley since ancient times. Because of water taken out for irrigation use, up to 20% of the water that formerly flowed in the river no longer reaches the Caspian Sea. Over 70% of the water in the Iori (Gabirry) River, a major tributary of the Kura, is expended before it reaches Lake Mingachevir. Of the of agricultural land in the lower Kura catchment area, , about 31%, are irrigated. Much of the water diverted from the river for irrigation goes to waste because of leakage from the canals, evaporation, poor maintenance, and other causes. Leaking water causes groundwater to rise, in some areas so high that about of land are so waterlogged that they are no longer suitable for agriculture. About of the irrigated lands have a dangerously high salt content because of mineral deposits from irrigation. Of this, are extremely salinated. Irrigation returns water, returned to the river by an extensive but outdated drainage system, contributes to severe pollution. Some of this degradation also comes from industrial and municipal wastewater discharge.

==History==

The ancient inhabitants of the Kura-Aras lowland called the river &quot;Mother Kür&quot;, signifying the importance of the river to the region. The first irrigation agriculture began about 4,500 years ago in the eastern Azerbaijan lowlands. Trading centers were established in time, including one at Mingachevir in Azerbaijan and another at Mtskheta in Georgia.

The site at Mingachevir (probably Sudagylan), first discovered in the 1940s by archaeologist G. I. Ione, had &quot;seven rectangular kilns ... The fuel chamber was a trapezoid. The inner walls and floor were covered with a special coating. These kilns were attributed to the third century B.C. [2,300 years ago]. The number of kilns and the quantity of raw material indicate a trade center.&quot; The settlement was probably destroyed by a fire around A.D. 600, but its demise is uncertain. But perhaps the most famous of the ancient settlements on the Kura is the &quot;cave town&quot; at Uplistsikhe, Georgia, first settled as early as 3,500 years ago. The city, carved into a cliff on the bank of the Kura covering an area of , contains underground living quarters, communal chambers, places of worship, storerooms, connected by a network of passageways. It reached its peak about 1,100 years ago as the political, religious and cultural center of the region, but in the 13th century, it fell to Mongolian invaders.

Even though irrigation agriculture had been well established for thousands of years, until the 1920s, humans did not have a significant effect on the ecology or hydrology of the Kura catchment area. Since then, logging, grazing and especially agriculture began to have a severe outcome on the water availability of the basin. Many forested areas in the mountains have been replaced by thin grassland because of logging. These habitat changes have been detrimental to the ecology of the Kura basin. After the 1920s, wetlands were drained and reservoirs were created to facilitate development of irrigation in the lower Kura valley.

In the 1950s and 1960s, when the Caucasus region was part of the Soviet Union, construction of many of the reservoirs and waterworks in the Kura basin began. Of the major reservoirs in the Kura catchment, one of the earliest was at Varvara in 1952. Large-scale construction of dams continued until the 1970s.

<text>To be used efficiently, all computer software needs certain hardware components or other software resources to be present on a computer. These prerequisites are known as (computer) system requirements and are often used as a guideline as opposed to an absolute rule. Most software defines two sets of system requirements: minimum and recommended. With increasing demand for higher processing power and resources in newer versions of software, system requirements tend to increase over time. Industry analysts suggest that this trend plays a bigger part in driving upgrades to existing computer systems than technological advancements. A second meaning of the term system requirements, is a generalisation of this first definition, giving the requirements to be met in the design of a system or sub-system.

== Recommended system requirements ==

Often manufacturers of games will provide the consumer with a set of requirements that are different from those that are needed to run a software. These requirements are usually called the recommended requirements. These requirements are almost always of a significantly higher level than the minimum requirements, and represent the ideal situation in which to run the software. Generally speaking, this is a better guideline than minimum system requirements in order to have a fully usable and enjoyable experience with that software.

== Hardware requirements ==

The most common set of requirements defined by any operating system or software application is the physical computer resources, also known as hardware, A hardware requirements list is often accompanied by a hardware compatibility list (HCL), especially in case of operating systems. An HCL lists tested, compatible, and sometimes incompatible hardware devices for a particular operating system or application. The following sub-sections discuss the various aspects of hardware requirements.

=== Architecture ===

All computer operating systems are designed for a particular computer architecture. Most software applications are limited to particular operating systems running on particular architectures. Although architecture-independent operating systems and applications exist, most need to be recompiled to run on a new architecture. See also a list of common operating systems and their supporting architectures.

=== Processing power ===

The power of the central processing unit (CPU) is a fundamental system requirement for any software. Most software running on x86 architecture define processing power as the model and the clock speed of the CPU. Many other features of a CPU that influence its speed and power, like bus speed, cache, and MIPS are often ignored. This definition of power is often erroneous, as different makes and models of CPUs at similar clock speed often have different throughput speeds.

=== Memory ===

All software, when run, resides in the random access memory (RAM) of a computer. Memory requirements are defined after considering demands of the application, operating system, supporting software and files, and other running processes. Optimal performance of other unrelated software running on a multi-tasking computer system is also considered when defining this requirement.

=== Secondary storage ===

Data storage device requirements vary, depending on the size of software installation, temporary files created and maintained while installing or running the software, and possible use of swap space (if RAM is insufficient).

=== Display adapter ===

Software requiring a better than average computer graphics display, like graphics editors and high-end games, often define high-end display adapters in the system requirements.

=== Peripherals ===

Some software applications need to make extensive and/or special use of some peripherals, demanding the higher performance or functionality of such peripherals. Such peripherals include CD-ROM drives, keyboards, pointing devices, network devices, etc.

== Software requirements ==
Software requirements deal with defining software resource requirements and prerequisites that need to be installed on a computer to provide optimal functioning of an application. These requirements or prerequisites are generally not included in the software installation package and need to be installed separately before the software is installed.

=== Platform ===

A computing platform describes some sort of framework, either in hardware or software, which allows software to run. Typical platforms include a computer&#x27;s architecture, operating system, or programming languages and their runtime libraries.

Operating system is one of the requirements mentioned when defining system requirements (software). Software may not be compatible with different versions of same line of operating systems, although some measure of backward compatibility is often maintained. For example, most software designed for Microsoft Windows XP does not run on Microsoft Windows 98, although the converse is not always true. Similarly, software designed using newer features of Linux Kernel v2.6 generally does not run or compile properly (or at all) on Linux distributions using Kernel v2.2 or v2.4.

=== APIs and drivers ===

Software making extensive use of special hardware devices, like high-end display adapters, needs special API or newer device drivers. A good example is DirectX, which is a collection of APIs for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming, on Microsoft platforms.

=== Web browser ===

Most web applications and software depend heavily on web technologies to make use of the default browser installed on the system. Microsoft Edge is a frequent choice of software running on Microsoft Windows, which makes use of ActiveX controls, despite their vulnerabilities.

== Other requirements ==

Some software also has other requirements for proper performance. Internet connection (type and speed) and resolution of the display screen are notable examples.

== Examples ==

Following are a few examples of system requirement definitions for popular PC games and trend of ever-increasing resource needs:

For instance, while &quot;StarCraft&quot; (1998) requires:


&quot;Doom 3&quot; (2004) requires:


&quot;Star Wars: The Force Unleashed&quot; (2009) requires:


&quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; (2015) requires:

<doc id="349769" wikidata="Q232128" url="?curid=349769" title="Artemisia I of Caria">
<text>Artemisia I of Caria (; fl. 480 BC) was a queen of the ancient Greek city-state of Halicarnassus, which is now in Bodrum, present-day Turkey. She was also queen of the nearby islands of Kos, Nisyros and Kalymnos, within the Achaemenid satrapy of Caria, in about 480 BC. She was of Carian-Greek ethnicity by her father Lygdamis I, and half-Cretan by her mother. She fought as an ally of Xerxes I, King of Persia against the independent Greek city states during the second Persian invasion of Greece. She personally commanded ships at the naval battle of Artemisium and at the naval Battle of Salamis in 480 BC. She is mostly known through the writings of Herodotus, himself a native of Halicarnassus, who praises her courage and relates the respect in which she was held by Xerxes.

== Family ==
Artemisia&#x27;s father was the satrap of Halicarnassus, Lygdamis I () and her mother was from the island of Crete. She took the throne after the death of her husband, as she had a son, named Pisindelis (), who was still a youth. Artemisia&#x27;s grandson, Lygdamis II (), was the satrap of Halicarnassus when Herodotus was exiled from there and the poet Panyasis () was sentenced to death, after the unsuccessful uprising against him.

==Second Persian invasion of Greece ==

According to Thessalus, the King of Persia demanded earth and water from the Coans in 493 BC but they refused, and so he gave the island to Artemisia to be wasted. Artemisia led a fleet of ships to Cos to slaughter the Coans, but Thessalus claimed that Zeus intervened and Artemisia&#x27;s ships were destroyed by lightning, and she was forced to retreat. However, she later returned and conquered them.

=== Battle of Salamis ===
Xerxes was induced by the message of Themistocles to attack the Greek fleet under unfavourable conditions, rather than sending a part of his ships to the Peloponnesus and awaiting the dissolution of the Greek armies. Artemisia was the only one of Xerxes&#x27; naval commanders to advise against the action, then went on to earn her king&#x27;s praise for her leadership in action during his fleet&#x27;s defeat by the Greeks at the Battle of Salamis (September, 480 BC).

==== Preparations ====
Before the battle of Salamis, Xerxes gathered all his naval commanders and sent Mardonios to ask whether or not he should fight a naval battle.
All the commanders advised him to fight a naval battle except Artemisia.

As Herodotus tells it, she told Mardonios:

Tell the King to spare his ships and not do a naval battle because our enemies are much stronger than us in the sea, as men are to women. And why does he need to risk a naval battle? Athens for which he did undertake this expedition is his and the rest of Greece too. No man can stand against him and they who once resisted, were destroyed.

If Xerxes chose not to rush into a naval encounter, but instead kept his ships close to the shore and either stayed there or moved them towards the Peloponnese, victory would be his. The Greeks can&#x27;t hold out against him for very long. They will leave for their cities, because they don&#x27;t have food in store on this island, as I have learned, and when our army will march against the Peloponnese they who have come from there will become worried and they will not stay here to fight to defend Athens.

But if he hurries to engage I am afraid that the navy will be defeated and the land-forces will be weakened as well. In addition, he should also consider that he has certain untrustworthy allies, like the Egyptians, the Cyprians, the Kilikians and the Pamphylians, who are completely useless.

Xerxes was pleased with her advice and while he already held her in great esteem he now praised her further. Despite this, he gave orders to follow the advice of the rest of his commanders. Xerxes thought that at the naval battle of Artemisium his men acted like cowards because he was not there to watch them. But this time he would watch the battle himself to ensure they would act bravely.

Plutarch, in &quot;On the Malice of Herodotus&quot;, believe that Herodotus wrote that because he just wanted verses in order to make Artemisia look like a Sibyl, who was prophesying of things to come.

==== Engagement ====

Artemisia participated in the Battle of Salamis in September, 480 BC as a Persian ally. She led the forces of Halicarnassos, Cos, Nisyros and Calyndos () (Calyndos was on the southwest coast of Asia Minor across from Rhodes), and supplied five ships. The ships she brought had the second best reputation in the whole fleet, next to the ones from Sidon.

Her involvement in the campaign was described by Herodotus:

According to Herodotus, during the battle, and while the Persian fleet was facing defeat, an Athenian ship pursued Artemisia&#x27;s ship and she was not able to escape, because in front of her were friendly ships. She decided to charge against a friendly ship manned by people of Calyndos and on which the king of the Calyndians Damasithymos () was located. The Calyndian ship sank. Herodotus is uncertain but offers the possibility that Artemisia had previously had a disagreement with Damasithymos at the Hellespont.
According to Polyaenus, when Artemisia saw that she was near to falling into the hands of the Greeks, she ordered the Persian colours to be taken down, and the master of the ship to bear down upon and attack a Persian vessel of the Calyndian allies, which was commanded by Damasithymus, that was passing by her.

When the captain of the Athenian ship, Ameinias, saw her charge against a Persian ship, he turned his ship away and went after others, supposing that the ship of Artemisia was either a Greek ship or was deserting from the Persians and fighting for the Greeks.

Herodotus believed that Ameinias did not know that Artemisia was on the ship, because otherwise he would not have ceased his pursuit until either he had captured her or had been captured himself, because &quot;orders had been given to the Athenian captains, and moreover a prize was offered of ten thousand drachmas for the man who should take her alive; since they thought it intolerable that a woman should make an expedition against Athens.&quot;

Polyaenus in his work Stratagems () reports that Artemisia had in her ship two different standards. When she chased a Greek ship, she hoisted the Persian colours. But when she was chased by a Greek ship, she hoisted the Greek colours, so that the enemy might mistake her for a Greek and give up the pursuit.

While Xerxes was overseeing the battle from his throne, which was at the foot of Mount Aigaleo, he observed the incident and he and the others who were present thought that Artemisia had attacked and sunk a Greek ship. One of the men who was next to Xerxes said to him: &quot;Master, see Artemisia, how well she is fighting, and how she sank even now a ship of the enemy&quot; and Xerxes then responded: &quot;My men have become women; and my women, men.&quot; None of the crew of the Calyndian ship survived to be able to accuse her otherwise. According to Polyaenus, when Xerxes saw her sink the ship, he said: &quot;O Zeus, surely you have formed women out of man&#x27;s materials, and men out of woman&#x27;s.&quot;

Photius writes that a man called Draco (), who was the son of Eupompus () of Samos, was in the service of Xerxes for a thousand talents. He had very good eyesight and could easily see at twenty stades. He described to Xerxes what he saw from the battle and Artemisia&#x27;s bravery.

=== Aftermath ===
Plutarch, in his work &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; () at the part which mentions Themistocles, says that it was Artemisia who recognised the body of Ariamenes () (Herodotus says that his name was Ariabignes), brother of Xerxes and admiral of the Persian navy, floating amongst the shipwrecks, and brought the body back to Xerxes.
After the battle, according to Polyaenus, Xerxes acknowledged her to have excelled above all the officers in the fleet and sent her a complete suit of Greek armour; he also presented the captain of her ship with a distaff and spindle.

According to Herodotus, after the defeat, Xerxes presented Artemisia with two possible courses of action and asked her which she recommended. Either he would lead troops to the Peloponnese himself, or he would withdraw from Greece and leave his general Mardonius in charge. Artemisia suggested to him that he should retreat back to Asia Minor and she advocated the plan suggested by Mardonius, who requested 300,000 Persian soldiers with which he would defeat the Greeks in Xerxes&#x27; absence.

According to Herodotus she replied: I think that you should retire and leave Mardonius behind with those whom he desires to have. If he succeeds, the honour will be yours because your slaves performed it. If on the other hand, he fails, it would be no great matter as you would be safe and no danger threatens anything that concerns your house. And while you will be safe the Greeks will have to pass through many difficulties for their own existence. In addition, if Mardonius were to suffer a disaster who would care? He is just your slave and the Greeks will have but a poor triumph. As for yourself, you will be going home with the object for your campaign accomplished, for you have burnt Athens.

Xerxes followed her advice, leaving Mardonius to conduct the war in Greece. He sent her to Ephesus to take care of his illegitimate sons. On the other hand, Plutarch mocks Herodotus&#x27; writing, since he thinks that Xerxes would have brought women with him from Susa, in case his son needed female attendants.

== Death ==
A legend, quoted by Photius, some 13 centuries later, claims that Artemisia fell in love with a man from Abydos (), named Dardanus (), and when he ignored her, she blinded him while he was sleeping, but her love for him increased. An oracle told her to jump from the top of the rock of Leucas, as those who leapt from this rock were said to be cured from the passion of love. However, she was killed after she jumped from the rock and buried near the spot. According to a legend, Sappho killed herself jumping from these cliffs too, because she was in love with Phaon.

Artemisia was succeeded by her son Pisindelis, who became the new tyrant of Caria. He would himself later be succeeded by his son Lygdamis.

== Reception in the Greco-Roman world ==
Herodotus admired Artemisia, despite her support of Persia. He praised her decisiveness and intelligence, and emphasised her strategies under Xerxes&#x27; as his Grand Admiral.

Polyaenus says that Xerxes spoke highly of her gallantry. He also in the eighth book of his work &quot;Stratagems&quot;, mentions that when Artemisia (he may have referred to Artemisia I, but most probably he referred to Artemisia II) wanted to conquer Latmus, she placed soldiers in ambush near the city and she, with women, eunuchs and musicians, celebrated a sacrifice at the grove of the Mother of the Gods, which was about seven stades distant from the city. When the inhabitants of Latmus came out to see the magnificent procession, the soldiers entered the city and took possession of it.

Justin in the &quot;History of the World&quot; mentioned that she &quot;was fighting with the greatest gallantry among the foremost leaders; so that you might have seen womanish fear in a man, and manly boldness in a woman.&quot;

On the other hand, Thessalus, a son of Hippocrates, described her in a speech as a cowardly pirate.

Aristophanes mentioned Artemisia in his works &quot;Lysistrata&quot; and &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot;.

Pausanias, in the third book of his work &quot;Description of Greece&quot; (), entitled &quot;Laconia&quot; () mentioned that in the marketplace of Sparta the most striking monument was the portico which they called &quot;Persian&quot; (), because it was made from spoils taken in the Persian wars. Over time, the Spartans altered it until it became very large and splendid. On the pillars were white-marble figures of Persians, including Mardonius. There was also a figure of Artemisia.

Also, the encyclopedia called the &quot;Suda&quot; mentioned Artemisia.

==In popular culture==

Several modern ships were named after Artemisia. An Iranian destroyer (Persian: ناوشکن) purchased during the Pahlavi dynasty was named &quot;Artemis&quot; in her honour. This destroyer was the largest ship in the Iranian Navy. The previous name of the Greek ferryboat, &quot;Panagia Skiadeni&quot;, was &quot;Artemisia&quot; (ex-Star A, Orient Star and Ferry Tachibana).

The Artemisia Cultural Association of the municipality of Nea Alikarnassos in Crete, founded in 1979, is named after Queen Artemisia.

In the 1962 film, &quot;The 300 Spartans&quot;, Artemisia is portrayed by Anne Wakefield.

Artemisia appears in Gore Vidal&#x27;s 1981 (and 2002 release) historical novel &quot;Creation&quot;. In Vidal&#x27;s depiction, she had a long relationship with the Persian general Mardonius, who at some 
periods lived in Halicarnassus and acted unofficially as her consort – but that she refused to marry him, determined to preserve her independence.

In the 2014 film, &quot;300: Rise of an Empire&quot;, Artemisia is featured as commander of the invading navy that the Greeks must fight, and serves as the main antagonist. She is portrayed by Eva Green.

The historian Dr. Roy Casagranda wrote a historical fiction novel about Artemsia entitled The Blood Throne of Caria.

<text>Lost in the Stars is a musical with book and lyrics by Maxwell Anderson and music by Kurt Weill, based on the novel &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot; (1948) by Alan Paton. The musical premiered on Broadway in 1949; it was the composer&#x27;s last work for the stage before he died the following year.

==Productions==
&quot;Lost in the Stars&quot; opened on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre on October 30, 1949, and closed on July 1, 1950, after 281 performances. The production was supervised and directed by Rouben Mamoulian and choreographed by La Verne French. Mamoulian was such a strong influence on the production that Foster Hirsch calls him &quot;the show&#x27;s third author.&quot; Todd Duncan took the role of Stephen; Inez Matthews sang Irina.

New York City Opera presented the musical in April 1958. Directed by Jose Quintero, the cast featured Lawrence Winters (Stephen Kumalo) and Lee Charles (Leader). (The conductor of those performances, Julius Rudel, led a 1992 complete recording of the score with the Orchestra of St. Luke&#x27;s: Music Masters 01612-67100.)

A Broadway revival opened at the Imperial Theatre on April 18, 1972, and closed on May 20 after 39 performances and 8 previews. Directed by Gene Frankel with choreography by Louis Johnson, the cast featured Rod Perry as Leader, Brock Peters as Stephen Kumalo, Leslie Banks as James Jarvis, and Rosetta LeNoire as Grace Kumalo. Peters was nominated for the Tony Award Best Actor in a Musical and the Drama Desk Award Outstanding Performance; Gilbert Price was nominated for the Tony Award Best Featured Actor in a Musical.

&quot;Lost in the Stars&quot; was adapted for the screen in 1974, with Daniel Mann directing. The movie was released in the American Film Theatre series. Reviews were mixed.

Long Wharf Theatre, New Haven, Connecticut, presented a revival in April 1986, directed by Arvin Brown.

The York Theatre Company, New York City, New York, presented a revival that ran from March 25 - April 17, 1988, directed by Alex Dmitriev. Howard Kissel of the Daily News wrote: &quot;The York Theatre Company has provided an enormous service by reviving Kurt Weill&#x27;s &#x27;Lost In The Stars.&#x27; When you hear music of this power, questions about whether or not it&#x27;s &#x27;opera&#x27; are irrelevant...You know you&#x27;re in the presence of something great from the minute the show starts...&quot; This production received a Drama Desk Nomination for Best Musical Revival. Musical Direction was by Lawrence W. Hill. In the cast were George Merritt as Stephen Kumalo, Ken Prymus as Leader, April Armstrong as Irini, and as an interesting note, Rachel Lemanski (aka Rachel York) in the ensemble. Costumes by Holly Hynes, set by James Morgan and lighting by Mary Jo Dondlinger.

A semi-staged concert was presented by the New York City Center Encores! series from February 3 to February 6, 2011.

New Sussex Opera gave the British staged premiere at the Gardner Arts Centre, University of Sussex in 1991.

The Glimmerglass Festival, in Cooperstown, New York State, presented the &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot; starring Eric Owens, Wynn Harmon, and Sean Panikkar in a co-production with Cape Town Opera, South Africa, between 22 July and 25 August 2012.

In partnership with Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and Saratoga International Theater Institute, CAP UCLA presented &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot; in Royce Hall on January 28 and 29, 2017. The production was staged by Anne Bogart and music directed by Jeffrey Kahane.

==Plot==

In August 1949, in the South African village of Ndotsheni (The song &quot;The Hills of Ixopo&quot; is sung at this point.), the black Anglican priest of St. Mark&#x27;s Church, the Rev. Stephen Kumalo, learns from a letter from his brother (John Kumalo, who lives in Johannesburg) that their sister is in trouble. Stephen decides to travel to Johannesburg to help his sister; he will also seek his son, Absalom, who works in the mines (&quot;Thousands of Miles&quot;). In Johannesburg, Stephen learns that his sister will not leave but she asks him to take care of her young son, Alex.

He finally locates his son Absalom, who had been in jail. Absalom now plans with his friends to steal, so they can get enough money to avoid a life in the gold mines. Absalom&#x27;s pregnant girlfriend Irina tries to convince him not to take part, but he goes ahead with his plan (&quot;Trouble Man&quot;). During the robbery, Absalom kills Arthur Jarvis, a white friend of his father, Stephen. As Absalom is jailed, Stephen wonders how to tell his wife, Grace, and he realizes he is facing a crisis of faith (&quot;Lost in the Stars&quot;).

Stephen knows that his son could either tell a lie and live or tell the truth and die. He prays for guidance (&quot;O Tixo, Tixo, Help Me&quot;). At the trial, Absalom&#x27;s two friends lie to the court and are freed, but Absalom, truly repentant, tells the truth and is sentenced to hang (&quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot;). Stephen performs a wedding between Absalom and Irina in prison and then returns home to Ndotsheni with Irina and Alex. Alex and the child of Arthur Jarvis meet and start to become friends (&quot;Big Mole&quot;). Stephen tells his flock he can no longer be their minister, and their faith is now also shaken (&quot;A Bird of Passage&quot;).

On the still-dark morning of the execution, Stephen waits alone for the clock to strike (&quot;Four O&#x27;Clock&quot;). Unexpectedly, the father of the murdered man pays him a visit. He tells Stephen that he has realized that they have both lost sons. Out of recognition of their mutual sorrow, and despite their different races, he offers his friendship, and Stephen accepts.

== Musical analysis ==
Several of the songs, including the title song, had been reworked from an earlier, abortive Weill/Anderson play &quot;Ulysses Africanus&quot;. The title song had originally been written circa 1938 for that other play in African-American dialect, but had already been reworked to standard English by the time Weill&#x27;s wife Lotte Lenya became the first to record the song in 1943.

Weill wanted to use neither the &quot;tom-tom&quot; beat with which Americans were familiar nor the spirituals of the South, so he obtained recordings of Zulu music from Africa to study. In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; however, Weill noted that &quot;American spirituals are closer to African music than many people realize.&quot; In pointing out the set, he commented &quot;Notice that this is an Anglican church. That is another influence that appears in the music. In general, the whole play has a Biblical tone that we hope the public will like.&quot;

He was influenced by African American musical idioms through his use of spiritual melodies, blues and jazz.

The title song &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot; enjoyed a measure of popular success, and versions of it were recorded by Anita O&#x27;Day, Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Sarah Vaughan, Elvis Costello, Leonard Nimoy, William Shatner, Kurt Elling and many others. The words, which in the musical are those of the minister Stephen Kumalo at the depth of his desperation, tell how God once &quot;held all the stars in the palm of his hand... and they ran through his fingers like grains of sand, and one little star fell alone.&quot;

Kumalo says that God sought and found the little lost star and &quot;stated and promised he&#x27;d take special care so it wouldn&#x27;t get lost again.&quot; However, at times, he thinks that God has forgotten his promise and that &quot;we&#x27;re lost out here in the stars.&quot;

==Reactions==
Critic Brooks Atkinson, in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of the original 1949 Broadway production that Maxwell Anderson and Mr. Weill had encountered &quot;obvious difficulty&quot; in transforming &quot;so thoroughly a work of literary art&quot; into theatre, and was sometimes &quot;skimming and literal where the novel is rich and allusive.&quot; He suggested that people unfamiliar with the novel might not fully appreciate the &quot;multitudinous forces that are running headlong through this tragic story.&quot; He praised Anderson&#x27;s &quot;taste and integrity&quot; and described the last scene as &quot;profoundly moving.&quot; Robert Garland, writing in the &quot;Journal American&quot;, similarly commented that &quot;the beauty and simplicity of Paton&#x27;s book infrequently comes through.&quot;

In contrast, Atkinson felt that the music positively added to the experience of the novel: &quot;Here, the theatre has come bearing its most memorable gifts. In the past Mr. Weill has given the theatre some fine scores. But...it is difficult to remember anything out of his portfolio as eloquent as this richly orchestrated singing music...[It is] overflowing with the same compassion that Mr. Paton brought to his novel...The music is deep, dramatic, and beautiful.&quot;

However, Paton did not agree with Anderson&#x27;s ending. Paton desperately wanted the Christian aspect of his work to be a huge focus. Without it, it changed the meaning of the entire work. About &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot;, Paton thought that the opening lines were &quot;profoundly unchristian and tantamount to an invitation to despair, and therefore they [were] an expression of something directly opposed to what Paton intended his character to embody.&quot;

<text>An artificial neuron is a mathematical function conceived as a model of a biological neuron in a neural network. The artificial neuron is the elementary unit of an &quot;artificial neural network&quot;.

The design of the artificial neuron was inspired by biological neural circuitry. Its inputs are analogous to excitatory postsynaptic potentials and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials at neural dendrites, or . Its weights are analogous to synaptic weights, and its output is analogous to a neuron&#x27;s action potential which is transmitted along its axon.

Usually, each input is separately weighted, and the sum is often added to a term known as a &quot;bias&quot; (loosely corresponding to the threshold potential), before being passed through a nonlinear function known as an activation function. Depending on the task, these functions could have a sigmoid shape (e.g. for binary classification), but they may also take the form of other nonlinear functions, piecewise linear functions, or step functions. They are also often monotonically increasing, continuous, differentiable, and bounded. Non-monotonic, unbounded, and oscillating activation functions with multiple zeros that outperform sigmoidal and ReLU-like activation functions on many tasks have also been recently explored. The threshold function has inspired building logic gates referred to as threshold logic; applicable to building logic circuits resembling brain processing. For example, new devices such as memristors have been extensively used to develop such logic.

The artificial neuron activation function should not be confused with a linear system&#x27;s transfer function.

An artificial neuron may be referred to as a semi-linear unit, Nv neuron, binary neuron, linear threshold function, or McCulloch–Pitts (MCP) neuron, depending on the structure used.

Simple artificial neurons, such as the McCulloch–Pitts model, are sometimes described as &quot;caricature models&quot;, since they are intended to reflect one or more neurophysiological observations, but without regard to realism. Artificial neurons can also refer to artificial cells in neuromorphic engineering that are similar to natural physical neurons.

== Basic structure ==
For a given artificial neuron formula_1, let there be formula_2 inputs with signals formula_3 through formula_4 and weights formula_5 through formula_6. Usually, the input formula_3 is assigned the value +1, which makes it a bias input with formula_8. This leaves only formula_9 actual inputs to the neuron: formula_10 to formula_4.

The output of the formula_1-th neuron is:

: formula_13,

where formula_14 (phi) is the activation function.

The output is analogous to the axon of a biological neuron, and its value propagates to the input of the next layer, through a synapse. It may also exit the system, possibly as part of an output vector.

It has no learning process as such. Its activation function weights are calculated, and its threshold value is predetermined.

== McCulloch–Pitts (MCP) neuron ==

An MCP neuron is a kind of restricted artificial neuron which operates in discrete time-steps. Each has zero or more inputs, and are written as formula_15. It has one output, written as formula_16. Each input can be either &quot;excitatory&quot; or &quot;inhibitory&quot;. The output can either be &quot;quiet&quot; or &quot;firing&quot;. An MCP neuron also has a threshold formula_17.

In an MCP neural network, all the neurons operate in synchronous discrete time-steps of formula_18. At time formula_19, the output of the neuron is formula_20 if the number of firing excitatory inputs is at least equal to the threshold, and no inhibitory inputs are firing; formula_21 otherwise.

Each output can be the input to an arbitrary number of neurons, including itself (i.e., self-loops are possible). However, an output cannot connect more than once with a single neuron. Self-loops do not cause contradictions, since the network operates in synchronous discrete time-steps.

As a simple example, consider a single neuron with threshold 0, and a single inhibitory self-loop. Its output would oscillate between 0 and 1 at every step, acting as a &quot;clock&quot;.

Any finite state machine can be simulated by a MCP neural network. Furnished with an infinite tape, MCP neural networks can simulate any Turing machine.

==Biological models==

Artificial neurons are designed to mimic aspects of their biological counterparts. However a significant performance gap exists between biological and artificial neural networks. In particular single biological neurons in the human brain with oscillating activation function capable of learning the XOR function have been discovered.
* Dendrites – in biological neurons, dendrites act as the input vector. These dendrites allow the cell to receive signals from a large (&gt;1000) number of neighboring neurons. As in the above mathematical treatment, each dendrite is able to perform &quot;multiplication&quot; by that dendrite&#x27;s &quot;weight value.&quot; The multiplication is accomplished by increasing or decreasing the ratio of synaptic neurotransmitters to signal chemicals introduced into the dendrite in response to the synaptic neurotransmitter. A negative multiplication effect can be achieved by transmitting signal inhibitors (i.e. oppositely charged ions) along the dendrite in response to the reception of synaptic neurotransmitters.
* Soma – in biological neurons, the soma acts as the summation function, seen in the above mathematical description. As positive and negative signals (exciting and inhibiting, respectively) arrive in the soma from the dendrites, the positive and negative ions are effectively added in summation, by simple virtue of being mixed together in the solution inside the cell&#x27;s body.
* Axon – the axon gets its signal from the summation behavior which occurs inside the soma. The opening to the axon essentially samples the electrical potential of the solution inside the soma. Once the soma reaches a certain potential, the axon will transmit an all-in signal pulse down its length. In this regard, the axon behaves as the ability for us to connect our artificial neuron to other artificial neurons.

Unlike most artificial neurons, however, biological neurons fire in discrete pulses. Each time the electrical potential inside the soma reaches a certain threshold, a pulse is transmitted down the axon. This pulsing can be translated into continuous values. The rate (activations per second, etc.) at which an axon fires converts directly into the rate at which neighboring cells get signal ions introduced into them. The faster a biological neuron fires, the faster nearby neurons accumulate electrical potential (or lose electrical potential, depending on the &quot;weighting&quot; of the dendrite that connects to the neuron that fired). It is this conversion that allows computer scientists and mathematicians to simulate biological neural networks using artificial neurons which can output distinct values (often from −1 to 1).

===Encoding===
Research has shown that unary coding is used in the neural circuits responsible for birdsong production. The use of unary in biological networks is presumably due to the inherent simplicity of the coding. Another contributing factor could be that unary coding provides a certain degree of error correction.

==Physical artificial cells==
There is research and development into physical artificial neurons – organic and inorganic.

For example, some artificial neurons can receive and release dopamine (chemical signals rather than electrical signals) and communicate with natural rat muscle and brain cells, with potential for use in BCIs/prosthetics.

Low-power biocompatible memristors may enable construction of artificial neurons which function at voltages of biological action potentials and could be used to directly process biosensing signals, for neuromorphic computing and/or direct communication with biological neurons.

Organic neuromorphic circuits made out of polymers, coated with an ion-rich gel to enable a material to carry an electric charge like real neurons, have been built into a robot, enabling it to learn sensorimotorically within the real world, rather than via simulations or virtually. Moreover, artificial spiking neurons made of soft matter (polymers) can operate in biologically relevant environments and enable the synergetic communication between the artificial and biological domains.

==History==
The first artificial neuron was the Threshold Logic Unit (TLU), or Linear Threshold Unit, first proposed by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943 in &quot;A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity&quot;. The model was specifically targeted as a computational model of the &quot;nerve net&quot; in the brain. As an activation function, it employed a threshold, equivalent to using the Heaviside step function. Initially, only a simple model was considered, with binary inputs and outputs, some restrictions on the possible weights, and a more flexible threshold value. Since the beginning it was already noticed that any Boolean function could be implemented by networks of such devices, what is easily seen from the fact that one can implement the AND and OR functions, and use them in the disjunctive or the conjunctive normal form.
Researchers also soon realized that cyclic networks, with feedbacks through neurons, could define dynamical systems with memory, but most of the research concentrated (and still does) on strictly feed-forward networks because of the smaller difficulty they present.

One important and pioneering artificial neural network that used the linear threshold function was the perceptron, developed by Frank Rosenblatt. This model already considered more flexible weight values in the neurons, and was used in machines with adaptive capabilities. The representation of the threshold values as a bias term was introduced by Bernard Widrow in 1960 – see ADALINE.

In the late 1980s, when research on neural networks regained strength, neurons with more continuous shapes started to be considered. The possibility of differentiating the activation function allows the direct use of the gradient descent and other optimization algorithms for the adjustment of the weights. Neural networks also started to be used as a general function approximation model. The best known training algorithm called backpropagation has been rediscovered several times but its first development goes back to the work of Paul Werbos.

==Types of activation function==

The activation function of a neuron is chosen to have a number of properties which either enhance or simplify the network containing the neuron. Crucially, for instance, any multilayer perceptron using a linear activation function has an equivalent single-layer network; a &quot;non&quot;-linear function is therefore necessary to gain the advantages of a multi-layer network.

Below, formula_22 refers in all cases to the weighted sum of all the inputs to the neuron, i.e. for formula_23 inputs,

: formula_24

where formula_25 is a vector of synaptic weights and formula_26 is a vector of inputs.

===Step function===

The output formula_16 of this activation function is binary, depending on whether the input meets a specified threshold, formula_28 (theta). The &quot;signal&quot; is sent, i.e. the output is set to 1, if the activation meets or exceeds the threshold.

: formula_29

This function is used in perceptrons, and appears in many other models. It performs a division of the space of inputs by a hyperplane. It is specially useful in the last layer of a network, intended for example to perform binary classification of the inputs.

===Linear combination===

In this case, the output unit is simply the weighted sum of its inputs, plus a bias term. A number of such linear neurons perform a linear transformation of the input vector. This is usually more useful in the early layers of a network. A number of analysis tools exist based on linear models, such as harmonic analysis, and they can all be used in neural networks with this linear neuron. The bias term allows us to make affine transformations to the data.

===Sigmoid===

A fairly simple nonlinear function, the sigmoid function such as the logistic function also has an easily calculated derivative, which can be important when calculating the weight updates in the network. It thus makes the network more easily manipulable mathematically, and was attractive to early computer scientists who needed to minimize the computational load of their simulations. It was previously commonly seen in multilayer perceptrons. However, recent work has shown sigmoid neurons to be less effective than rectified linear neurons. The reason is that the gradients computed by the backpropagation algorithm tend to diminish towards zero as activations propagate through layers of sigmoidal neurons, making it difficult to optimize neural networks using multiple layers of sigmoidal neurons.

===Rectifier===

In the context of artificial neural networks, the rectifier or ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is an activation function defined as the positive part of its argument:

: formula_30

where formula_26 is the input to a neuron. This is also known as a ramp function and is analogous to half-wave rectification in electrical engineering. This activation function was first introduced to a dynamical network by Hahnloser et al. in a 2000 paper in &quot;Nature&quot; with strong biological motivations and mathematical justifications. It has been demonstrated for the first time in 2011 to enable better training of deeper networks, compared to the widely used activation functions prior to 2011, i.e., the logistic sigmoid (which is inspired by probability theory; see logistic regression) and its more practical counterpart, the hyperbolic tangent.

A commonly used variant of the ReLU activation function is the Leaky ReLU which allows a small, positive gradient when the unit is not active:

formula_32

where formula_26 is the input to the neuron and formula_34 is a small positive constant (set to 0.01 in the original paper).

==Pseudocode algorithm==
The following is a simple pseudocode implementation of a single Threshold Logic Unit (TLU) which takes Boolean inputs (true or false), and returns a single Boolean output when activated. An object-oriented model is used. No method of training is defined, since several exist. If a purely functional model were used, the class TLU below would be replaced with a function TLU with input parameters threshold, weights, and inputs that returned a Boolean value.

 class TLU defined as:
 data member threshold : number
 data member weights : list of numbers of size X
 function member fire(inputs : list of booleans of size X) : boolean defined as:
 variable T : number
 T ← 0
 for each i in 1 to X do
 if inputs(i) is true then
 T ← T + weights(i)
 end if
 end for each
 if T &gt; threshold then
 return true
 else:
 return false
 end if
 end function
 end class

<text>The German Grand Prix () was a motor race that took place most years since 1926, with 75 races having been held. The race has been held at only three venues throughout its history: the Nürburgring in Rhineland-Palatinate, Hockenheimring in Baden-Württemberg and occasionally AVUS in Berlin. The race continued to be known as the German Grand Prix, even through the era when the race was held in West Germany.

Because West Germany was prevented from taking part in international events in the immediate post-war period, the German Grand Prix only became part of the Formula One World Championship in 1951. It was designated the European Grand Prix four times between 1954 and 1974, when this title was an honorary designation given each year to one Grand Prix race in Europe. It has been organised by the Automobilclub von Deutschland (AvD) since 1926.

The German Grand Prix was held at Hockenheimring every year between 1977 and 2006 (except 1985). During this time, a separate F1 race was held in Germany at the Nürburgring most years from until 2007 under the title of the European Grand Prix. Originally intended to begin in 2007, Hockenheimring and the Nürburgring alternated hosting the German Grand Prix between 2008 and 2014, at which point Nürburgring pulled out of hosting the event in 2015, leaving Hockenheim the sole host of the race but only in alternating years until 2018. A further one-year deal placed the German Grand Prix on the 2019 calendar. , a race under the name of &#x27;German Grand Prix&#x27; has not been run again although Germany hosted the 2020 Eifel Grand Prix at the Nürburgring.

== History ==
===Origins===
In 1907, Germany staged the first of the &quot;Kaiserpreis&quot; () races at the 73-mile (118 km) Taunus public road circuit, just outside Frankfurt. The same circuit had been used three years earlier for the 1904 Gordon Bennett Cup race, which was won by Leon Thery in a Brasier, beating Belgian Camille Jenatzy in a Mercedes. Entries were limited to touring cars with engines of less than eight litres. The race itself was a tragedy; a driver and his co-driver were killed 19 miles into the lap and the Taunus circuit was never used again. There was a medical team there, but it took them two and a half hours to get to the site of the accident, of which driver Otto Göbel was badly injured and his co-driver Ludwig Faber, who was pinned under their &quot;Adler&quot; was already dead. Göbel died of his injuries in hospital later on. Italy&#x27;s Felice Nazzaro won the race in a Fiat. The Prinz-Heinrich-Fahrt was the biggest German international race which was held from 1908 to 1911 and was organized by Prince Albert Wilhelm Heinrich, These races were point-to-point races which would last a week, would start in Berlin and the competitors had to traverse varying terrains over multiple countries covering around 2,000 km (1,250 mi). Although this kind of racing had been banned in France because of multiple fatal accidents, these races were held with touring cars and the first rallies of any kind and had equal prestige of the &quot;Kaiserpreis&quot; races before them with drivers such as Nazzaro competing in them.

In the early 1920s, ADAC Eifelrennen races were held on the twisty 33.2 km (20.6 mi) Nideggen public road circuit near Cologne and Bonn. Sometime around 1925, the construction of a dedicated race track was proposed just south of the Nideggen circuit around the ancient castle of the town of Nürburg, following the examples of Italy&#x27;s Monza and Targa Florio courses, and Berlin&#x27;s AVUS, yet with a different character. The layout of the circuit in the mountains was similar to the Targa Florio event, one of the most important motor races at that time. The original Nürburgring was to be a showcase for German automotive engineering and racing talent. Construction of the track, designed by the &quot;Eichler Architekturbüro&quot; from Ravensburg (led by architect Gustav Eichler), began in September 1925.

===Pre-war===

====AVUS====

The first national event in German Grand Prix motor racing was held at the AVUS (Automobil Verkehrs und Übungs-Straße (Automobile Traffic and Practice Road)) race circuit in southwestern Berlin in 1926 as a sports car race. The AVUS circuit was made up of two 6-mile straights combined with two left-hand hairpins at each end. The first race at AVUS, in heavy rain, was won by Germany&#x27;s native son, Rudolf Caracciola in a Mercedes-Benz. The event was marred by Adolf Rosenberger&#x27;s crash into one of the marshals&#x27; huts, killing three people. The AVUS circuit was considered extremely dangerous even back then- so the event was moved. The German &quot;Grand Prix&quot; became an official event in 1929. Although it was raced on in the non-championship AVUS-Rennen in the 1930s which saw some of the fastest road races ever held, the Grand Prix would not return to AVUS until 1959 for a one-off appearance. It should have had another race in 1960 but this Grand Prix was run as a Formula Two race instead at the Nürburgring on the Südschleife layout.

====Nürburgring====
The &quot;Grand Prix&quot; moved to the new, 28.3 km (17.6 mi) Nürburgring, located in the Eifel Mountain region in western Germany about 70 miles (112 km) from Frankfurt and Cologne. It was inaugurated on 18 June 1927 with the annual race, the ADAC &quot;Eifelrennen&quot;. This was a huge, incredibly challenging racing circuit that sped and twisted through forests of the Eifel Mountains, and had over 1000 feet (300 m) of elevation change and many spots where the cars visibly left the ground, such as the Flugplatz, Brunnchen and Pflanzgarten sections. There were two more races on the &quot;Gesamtstrecke&quot; (Combined circuit) combined course, which were both sportscar races, where German pre-war great Rudolf Caracciola would win his second of six German Grands Prix.

The 1930 and 1933 races were cancelled due to economic reasons related to the Great Depression. In 1931, the event began to use only the 14.2-mile (22.8 km) &quot;Nordschleife&quot; (North Loop), and this would continue onwards throughout the century. Caracciola would win the 1931 and 1932 events in a Mercedes and an Alfa Romeo respectively. Starting in 1934, there were often several races each year with the so-called &quot;Silver Arrows&quot; &quot;Grand Prix&quot; cars in Germany, e.g. the &quot;Eifelrennen&quot;, the AVUS race and several hillclimbs. Yet it was only the Grand Prix at the Nürburgring that was the national &quot;Grande Epreuve&quot;, which counted toward the European Championship from 1935 to 1939. The 1935 event was considered to be one of the greatest motorsports victories of all time. Italian legend Tazio Nuvolari, driving a hopelessly outdated and underpowered Alfa Romeo against state-of-the-art Mercedes and Auto Unions drove a very hard race in appalling conditions. After a dreadful start, he was able to pass a number of cars, particularly while some of the German cars pitted. But after a botched pit stop that cost him six minutes, he drove on the limit, made up that time and was second by the start of the last lap; 35 seconds behind leader Manfred von Brauchitsch in a Mercedes. Von Brauchitsch had ruined his tyres by pushing very hard in the dreadful conditions and Nuvolari was able to catch the German and take victory in front of the stunned German High Command and 350,000 spectators. The small 42-year-old Italian ended up finishing in front of eight running Silver Arrows. Second placed Hans Stuck was two minutes behind Nuvolari.

The 1936 race was won by German driver Bernd Rosemeyer, driving an Auto Union, who also won the Eifelrennen event at the Nordschleife in spectacular style, earning the nickname &quot;Fog Master&quot;. The 1937 race saw Carraciola win again in a Mercedes and Auto Union driver Ernst Von Delius die after a crash near the Antonius Bridge on the main straight. Von Delius hit the back of Briton Richard Seaman&#x27;s Mercedes at 250 km/h (154 mph) and he went flying through a bush and into a field. The car then ended up as a wreck on the side of the road next to the main straight. Von Delius suffered a broken leg and other injuries. He was expected to make a full recovery; but died the following night of thrombosis and other complications. Seaman crashed into a kilometre post and suffered minor injuries; but he survived. The Briton would come back to the Nürburgring to win the 1938 race, also in a Mercedes, which was to be his only championship Grand Prix victory. In 1939 a new track was built near Dresden, called the &quot;Deutschlandring&quot;, which was intended to host the 1940 German Grand Prix. However, because of the outbreak of World War II, the race was never run and the circuit never utilised for competition. In the same year, Caracciola took his sixth German Grand Prix victory. Soon afterwards Germany was at war and the Grand Prix did not return to international status until 1951.

===Post-war===

====Nürburgring and the World Championship ====

After World War II, Germany had been separated into Eastern and Western territories, and West Germany was banned from international sporting events until 1951. A non-championship Formula 2 race was won by Alberto Ascari in 1950 at the Nürburgring. The German Grand Prix was included as part of the new Formula One championship in its second season. The Nordschleife was to be the mainstay of West Germany&#x27;s premier motor racing event for the next quarter of a century, and was to be known as the toughest and most technically challenging circuit on the F1 calendar. The expanse of the circuit allowed an average of 375,000 spectators each year to watch the very popular event. The 1951 race was one where Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio led for 14 laps; but he had to refuel his Alfa and he only had third and fourth gears left. While in the pits, he was overtaken by Ascari in a Ferrari and went on to finish second behind the Italian. Fangio won for the first time in 1954 in a Mercedes; the first time a factory Mercedes Grand Prix car had been taken part in 15 years. He won driving the new open-wheeled W196, built at Fangio&#x27;s request. This event also saw the death of Argentine driver Onofre Marimón in a Maserati 250F during practice. Due to lack of knowledge of the circuit, crucial to doing well at the Nürburgring, he failed to negotiate a tricky bend near the Adenauer Bridge. He went off the road, ploughed through a hedge and down a steep slope, and the car sheared off a tree and tumbled down the slope. Once it came to a stop, Marimón was pinned underneath the 670 kg (1,480 lb) 250F, cars in those days had no roll-over bars to prevent the car from pinning and crushing the driver in the event of an accident; this is what happened to Marimón. The hapless Argentine&#x27;s injuries were bad enough to kill him a few minutes after the incident. His compatriot and devastated friend Fangio went to check the wreckage of the Maserati; he found it in fourth gear of four; this corner was normally taken in an F1 car in third gear. This proved the accident to be unfortunately of driver error. The 1955 event was cancelled in the aftermath of the Le Mans disaster; all auto racing in Germany (and much of Europe) was banned until the tracks could be upgraded. Fangio would win the next two events.

The 1957 event saw a number of changes. It included a Formula 2 race which was run concurrently alongside the Formula One cars. The track had been resurfaced and the concrete road surface (which was in very bad shape) which made up the pit straight, the Sudkurve and the straight behind the pits was taken out and replaced with tarmac. The 1957 event is, like Nuvolari&#x27;s 1935 victory, one of the greatest motorsports victories of all time. Fangio led for the beginning of the race in front of two Ferraris driven by Britons Mike Hawthorn and Peter Collins. Fangio planned to refuel during mid-distance; and he did. The pit stop was expected to take 30 seconds. It was a botched one and it took 78 seconds. Fangio was now nearly a minute behind Hawthorn and Collins. He began a charge where he made up several seconds on each lap. He tore huge chunks out of the lap record, breaking it nine times. On the 21st lap (the second-to-last lap) he passed Collins behind the pits, then Hawthorn late into the same lap. The 46-year-old Argentine won the race (his 24th and final F1 victory) and his fifth and final championship. 1958 saw the distance shortened to 15 laps; Briton Tony Brooks won driving a Vanwall. Vanwall was the first British constructor to win a German Grand Prix. Collins crashed into a ditch next to the track at Pflanzgarten, and was thrown out of his car and hit a tree head first. He received severe head injuries and eventually died in a hospital near the circuit.

1959 saw the race go to the ultra-fast AVUS circuit in Berlin. This was the only Formula One race that took place there and was won by Brooks in a Ferrari. The AVUS circuit was now made up of two 2.5-mile straights, a tight left-handed hairpin at one end and a huge 43° brick banking constructed in 1937 on the other end, which was known as &quot;Die Mauer des Todes&quot; (English: &quot;The Wall of Death&quot;). Frenchman and prominent Formula One driver Jean Behra was killed during a support sportscar race driving a Porsche. He lost control and the Porsche went up and flew off the banking there, which had no safety wall or barrier of any kind. Behra was thrown 300 feet from his car and his head struck a flagpole; killing him instantly. Behra had been fired by Ferrari after an altercation in a restaurant in Reims with the Scuderia&#x27;s manager shortly before his death.

For 1960 the race was moved back to the Nürburgring, but this time on the smaller 4.7-mile (7.7 km) &quot;Südschleife&quot; (South Loop) section. The race was held for Formula 2 rather than Formula 1, causing the race to lose its championship status, but giving the German spectators what they had missed since 1954, as Porsche had strong new cars built to the 1.5 litre regulations which were to become Formula 1 from 1961. Running the shorter circuit, and lower class, had the benefit of lowering costs in policing and starting money for the organisers.

For the rest of the 1960s saw nine Formula One events take place at the Nordschleife. The 1961 event was won by Briton Stirling Moss driving a privately entered Lotus. Moss was able to hold off the two powerful and faster Ferraris of American Phil Hill and German Wolfgang von Trips. A clever tyre choice and skilful driving in wet weather conditions helped Moss to finish 16 seconds in front of von Trips. The 1964 event saw Dutch gentleman driver Carel Godin de Beaufort die during practice after he went off at Bergwerk corner. His orange Porsche went through bushes, down an embankment and then hit a tree. He died from his injuries in a hospital near the circuit. Briton John Surtees won for the second year in a row from Jim Clark. In 1965 Clark won, his seventh Formula One victory of that season and won his second Drivers&#x27; Championship in a Lotus. 1966 saw changeable weather conditions and a battle between Australian Jack Brabham and Surtees with Brabham taking victory. Briton John Taylor was killed after he hit the back of Belgian Jacky Ickx&#x27;s Formula 2 Matra MS5 near the bridge at Quddlebacher and Flugplatz. Taylor crashed and his Brabham BT11 caught fire. He received severe burns, from which he succumbed to a month later.

In 1967 a chicane was added before the pits but the cars were already matching 1965 lap times. The 1968 event was yet the scene of another great victory. This event took place in heavy rain and fog. Briton Jackie Stewart won the race by more than four minutes from Graham Hill; he was 30 seconds ahead of the second placed Hill by the end of the first lap. Stewart held the lead amid a driving rainstorm and thick fog.

Jacky Ickx won in 1969 driving a Brabham. The Belgian had made a bad start, clawed back through the field and after a long battle with Stewart, Ickx took the lead from Stewart on Lap 5. The Scot fell back with gearbox problems, leaving the Belgian in a dominant position. Stewart was able to hold on to second place, nearly a minute behind. German driver Gerhard Mitter was killed during practice driving a BMW 269 Formula 2 car after his rear suspension failed and the car went straight on at the downhill section near the very fast Schwedenkreuz bend. This was the fifth Formula One-related fatality at the 14.2-mile German circuit in 15 years, the most out of all the circuits yet used for the championship.

1970 however was to start the demise of the Nordschleife for international motor racing. After the death of Piers Courage at the Dutch Grand Prix a few months previously, the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association had a meeting at a hotel in London. Despite considerable pressure from outside parties they voted not to race at the notorious German circuit unless significant changes were made to the track safety conditions of the Nürburgring. Speeds of Formula One cars had increased dramatically as had the technology- the cars were lapping the &#x27;Ring more than 2 minutes faster than they had in 1951, and it had become clear that the Nürburgring, which was essentially a rough, unprotected road that went through forests and valleys situated in an expansive mountain range, was too dangerous and outdated for Grand Prix racing. The changes demanded by the drivers were refused by the circuit owners and organizers and could not possibly be made in time for the 1970 event, forcing a hasty switch to the fast Hockenheimring, which had already been upgraded with safety features. The race itself proved to be an exciting one, as it was won by Austrian Jochen Rindt, resisting a charging Ickx in a Ferrari.

1971 saw the race return to a modified Nürburgring. It was made smoother, straighter and was fitted with Armco barriers and run-off areas wherever possible. But with the layout being virtually the same as before, the circuit retained much of the character that led Stewart to call it &quot;The Green Hell.&quot; It was less dangerous than it had been before, but the &#x27;Ring was still by far the most technically challenging circuit on the F1 calendar. It was still dangerously rough and narrow in many areas, and even though some of the worst bumps, jumps and windy straights (particularly at Brunnchen and the Adenauer Bridge) had been smoothed over or made straight, there were still some big jumps on the track, particularly at Flugplatz and Pflanzgarten. Also, there were still some parts of the track that did not have Armco, but more of this was added through the years. The first event on the rebuilt Nordschleife saw Stewart win from his teammate François Cevert, who battled the Swiss Clay Regazzoni for 2nd with for nearly a quarter of the race. The 1972 event saw Jacky Ickx dominate in his Ferrari and Stewart crashed on the last lap after tangling with Regazzoni. The 1973 race was dominated by Tyrrell teammates Stewart and Cevert; and it was to be the 27th and last victory of Stewart&#x27;s illustrious career. 1974 saw New Zealander Howden Ganley crash heavily at Hatzenbach, seriously injuring the Kiwi. Ganley had already crashed heavily at the Nürburgring the year before and he decided to end his F1 career after his 1974 accident. The race saw Regazzoni win after Austrian Niki Lauda (who had crashed and had broken his wrist at the previous year&#x27;s German Grand Prix) and South African Jody Scheckter tangled on the first lap; Lauda was out but Scheckter went on to finish second. Briton and multiple motorcycle world champion Mike Hailwood crashed heavily in a McLaren at Pflanzgarten and broke his leg, his auto racing career was effectively ended by this crash. 1975 saw Lauda become the only driver ever to lap the old Nürburgring in under seven minutes; the Austrian lapped the monstrous circuit in his Ferrari in 6 minutes, 58.6 seconds at an average speed of 122 mph (196 km/h), which was good enough for pole position. But like so many years gone by, the weekend saw yet another serious accident. Briton Ian Ashley crashed his Williams FW during practice at Pflanzgarten and he was seriously injured; he did not race in Formula One again for at least two years. Argentine Carlos Reutemann took victory after keeping the lead for five remaining laps while Lauda had a puncture after leading for the first nine laps. Briton Tom Pryce ran as high as second after starting 17th in an under-funded Shadow, but he finished fourth after very hot fuel began to leak into his cockpit. Frenchman Jacques Laffite and Lauda passed Pryce. Laffite finished second which was a milestone for Briton Frank Williams&#x27;s struggling team; it was the English Williams&#x27;s first real taste of success in Formula One. Pryce received a medal for his efforts. The 1975 Grand Prix was the fastest race ever run on the old Nürburgring; Lauda&#x27;s teammate Clay Regazzoni posted the fastest lap at 7:06.4- which was to be the lap record of the old circuit.

However, the 1976 event was one that was to go down in history. Lauda, the reigning world champion, was dissatisfied with the safety arrangements of the mammoth circuit and attempted to organise a boycott the race during a meeting at the third race of the season in Long Beach, California in the United States. Formula One in the 1970s was the beginning towards a safer kind of motor racing and the Nürburgring was considered to be something of an anachronism at that time. However, by its very nature, the Nürburgring was almost impossible to be made safe in its old configuration. It did not have enough marshals and medical support to ensure the circuit&#x27;s safety- it needed five to six times the marshals and medical staff that a typical F1 race needed at the time, but Huschke von Hanstein and the German organizers were unwilling and possibly unable to provide them- it was extremely expensive; and the spectators viewing the race in the countryside would get into the track for free. In addition to the considerable expense of providing adequate support to the drivers, its geography made the modifications demanded by both the drivers and FIA also prohibitively expensive. There were several parts that were nearly inaccessible to the marshals- there were a number of places where run-off areas could not be built because they were not flat enough, there were parts that were too narrow because there was a cliff face on one side and a drop-off on another, etc. However, the Nürburgring&#x27;s organizers had a three-year contract with Formula One starting with the 1974 race which included making the track safer. Lauda was outvoted by other drivers because most of them felt that they should complete the contract so as to avoid any legal difficulties; the 1976 race was the last race on that contract. Although the contract included making the circuit safer over those years (and the organizers did that) it had already been decided that the 1976 race would be the last race at the Nordschleife. In addition to safety issues, the increasing commercialisation of Formula One was a factor as well. The extraordinary length of the Nordschleife made it all but impossible for any broadcasting organisation to effectively cover a race there.

As the 1976 race started parts of the circuit were wet and overcast, and other parts were dry and bathed in sunlight, another classic problem of the Nürburgring. After pitting to change from wet to dry tyres at the end of the first lap, Lauda came out again, far behind the leader, West German Jochen Mass. While pushing hard to make up time on the second lap, Lauda crashed at the fast left hand kink before Bergwerk corner over six miles (10.8 km) into the lap, one of the more inaccessible parts of the circuit. Going through the corner, Lauda lost control of his Ferrari when its rear suspension failed. The car crashed into a grass embankment and burst into flames. During the impact, Lauda&#x27;s helmet was wrenched from his head, and his burning Ferrari was hit by the cars of Brett Lunger, Arturo Merzario and Harald Ertl. Lunger, who had experience with fire during his time in the Vietnam War pulled Lauda out of the burning wreckage instead of the ill-equipped track marshals, who only arrived at the scene well after the impact. The resilient Austrian was standing and talking to other drivers right after the accident and his injuries were initially not expected to be serious. However, he had been severely burned and had been breathing in toxic fumes, which damaged his circulatory system. It took the only medical helicopter at the circuit 6 minutes to reach the accident scene from the pits area, as opposed to at most a minute at any other circuit on the Formula One calendar. Lauda later lapsed into a coma and nearly died, putting him out of action for six weeks. The event was red-flagged and restarted; long-time Grand Prix driver Chris Amon elected not to take the restart. This was the last Grand Prix the unlucky New Zealander drove in. Englishman James Hunt won this race, which turned out to be crucial for his championship chances that year. After 49 years of hosting the German Grand Prix the old Nürburgring never hosted a Grand Prix again, and the race returned to Hockenheim.

====Hockenheim====
The fast, flat Hockenheim circuit near Heidelberg almost played sole host to the German Grand Prix for the next 30 years. The 1977 event was won by Lauda, but was also notable when local driver Hans Heyer competed in the race despite failing to qualify. The 1979 event was one where Swiss Clay Regazzoni in his Williams attempted to chase down his teammate, Australian Alan Jones, but to no avail. 1980 was won by Frenchman Jacques Laffite in a Ligier after Jones dropped to 3rd due to time in the pits changing a punctured tyre, but it was overshadowed by Patrick Depailler&#x27;s fatal accident at the Ostkurve (which in those days, had no chicane and was flat-out) in testing for Alfa Romeo a few days before the race weekend. The 1981 event saw a tremendous battle between Jones and rising star Alain Prost in a Renault, with Jones passing Prost in the stadium due to interference by Prost&#x27;s backmarker teammate Rene Arnoux. The race was won by Brazilian Nelson Piquet after Jones pitted with problems with his Williams. The 1982 race saw changes to the circuit; most notably a chicane to the ultra-fast Ost-Kurve and a slower first chicane. It also saw the end of Frenchman Didier Pironi&#x27;s career; he had an appalling crash in the pouring rain during qualifying. After he hit the back of Prost&#x27;s Renault, Pironi was launched skyward and then rolled for some time until coming to a stop. Pironi, who was leading the championship at the time, had such serious leg injuries that FIA doctor Sid Watkins nearly had to amputate Pironi&#x27;s legs in order to get him out of the wrecked Ferrari. The way Formula One cars were designed at the time was in such a way that the drivers sat so far forward in the cockpit that their legs and feet were way in front of the front axle, leaving those human body parts dangerously exposed. They were only protected by only the chassis structure and the aluminium bodywork. During the race, Piquet physically attacked Chilean driver Eliseo Salazar after Salazar punted off the irate Brazilian at the Ostkurve chicane while leading the race. Patrick Tambay won his first race for Ferrari. The 1984 race saw Prost (now driving a McLaren) win and Toleman rookie Ayrton Senna drive very hard at the front of the field during the beginning of the race.

1985 saw a one-off return to the new 2.8-mile (4.5 km) Nürburgring Grand Prix circuit, which had been built next the site of the old Nordschleife and hosted the European Grand Prix the year before. It was a race where a number of drivers battled for the lead; it was won by Italian Michele Alboreto.

The international motorsports governing body at the time, FISA, had instituted a policy of long-term contracts for one circuit per Grand Prix. The choice for the German Grand Prix was between the new Nürburgring and Hockenheim. It was the latter that was chosen and it stayed there for the next 20 years. The 1986 event was one where a number of the leaders ran on fumes at the very end; top three drivers Piquet, Senna and Prost were all running out of fuel and although Brazilians Piquet and Senna finished 1–2, Prost finished sixth after his car was completely drained of fuel. The 1988 race was run in wet conditions; these conditions were particularly treacherous at Hockenheim because the circuit ran through a forest and the thick moisture from the rain tended to hang in the air because of the trees that surrounded the track. Even when it was not raining, the track still did not dry. Senna (now driving a McLaren) took advantage of his skill in the wet to win over his teammate Prost. The 1989 race was near the height Prost and Senna&#x27;s famous rivalry and this race was one where the two McLaren teammates drove on their absolute limits throughout the entire race. Prost&#x27;s gearbox malfunctioned and lost use of sixth gear on the second to last lap and Senna passed him to take the victory. Senna won the next year&#x27;s race as well from Italian Alessandro Nannini. The 1992 race saw further changes to the Ostkurve after a crash that Érik Comas had there in 1991; it was turned into a more complex chicane rather than simple left-right chicane with a tyre wall in the middle. 1994 saw a further change to the third chicane to make it slower in the aftermath of the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.

1995 saw German Michael Schumacher win, he was the first German to win his home race since Rudolf Caracciola in 1939. Formula One interest in Germany had peaked during the emergence of Schumacher. 1997 saw an exceptional win by Austrian Gerhard Berger. But the 2000 race was to play host to a number of problems. During the race, a disgruntled ex-Mercedes employee went onto the circuit during the race and disrupted the proceedings; and Jean Alesi had a huge accident at the third chicane and suffered dizziness for three days. And on the far side of the circuit (where the Ost-Kurve was) it was dry, but in the stadium section and the pits, it was pouring with rain. Rubens Barrichello won the race from 18th on the grid, which was his first Formula One victory. 2001 saw a huge accident at the start between Brazilian Luciano Burti in a Prost and Schumacher in a Ferrari; this race was won by Michael&#x27;s brother Ralf in a BMW-powered Williams.

====Threat to move the race from Hockenheim====
There was pressure from the FIA and the drivers for Hockenheim to be shortened from the 4.2 mile length circuit which was used as a one off in 1970 and from 1977 to 2001 after the death of Ayrton Senna at Imola in 1994 and later the events of 2000 and 2001. 3 new circuits which were built or rebuilt in the former East Germany after the 1990 reunification were seen as potential new venues for the race Oschersleben which was opened in 1997 which had a hotel built into the circuit and is 2.3 miles, Lausitzring with its combined oval/road course with a 2.8 mile length road course which opened in 2000 and Sachsenring which was/is also the present venue of the German motorcycle Grand Prix which re-opened in 1996 at 2.2 miles all 3 tracks were shorter than the 4.2 mile Hockenheim even the then European GP venue The Nurburgring with the 2.8 mile GP circuit was considered (if the German GP was moved to Nurburgring the European GP would have been deemed unnecessary) it was this threat which partly led to the length of Hockenheim being cut in 2002.

====The shortening of Hockenheim====
2002 saw the Hockenheimring dramatically shortened and the layout altered. The forest straights were removed and more corners were added to increase the technical challenge of the circuit. The circuit went from 4.2 to 2.7 miles long. Michael Schumacher won in that year. 2003 was the year Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya won for Williams-BMW, it was the second German GP victory in three years for engines of the Bavarian car maker. That year also saw the last appearance of the British Arrows team, who had been involved in Formula One since 1978. 2004 saw Schumacher continue his domination of that season by winning the German Grand Prix and Spaniard Fernando Alonso won the following year in a Renault after his main rival Kimi Räikkönen suffered a hydraulics failure and retired. 2006 saw Renault&#x27;s experimental mass damper system deemed legal by the race stewards but it was banned by the FIA. Renault did not use the system for the race and it proved to be their downfall as Schumacher won his home race in a Ferrari.

====Alternating venues====
In 2006 it was announced that from 2007 until 2010, the German Grand Prix would be shared between the Nürburgring GP circuit (former home of the European and Luxembourg Grands Prix) and the Hockenheimring. The former would hold the races in 2007 and 2009 and the latter in 2008 and 2010. However, the name for the 2007 Grand Prix was later changed. While it was originally intended to be the German Grand Prix, owing to a dispute with Hockenheim over the naming rights of the race, the race was eventually held under the title &quot;Großer Preis von Europa&quot; (European Grand Prix). By 2009, the circuits appeared to have resolved their disputes as the Nürburgring race was held under the German Grand Prix title.

The 2010 GP, held in Hockenheim, at one stage appeared to be in jeopardy as the track owners, the city and the state of Baden-Württemberg, were not willing any more to lose money due to the high licensing costs imposed by F1 management. In addition, talks with Bernie Ecclestone were hampered by his Hitler quotes. If the track had been relieved from being the venue, the owners were intending to returning the track back to its former layout. However, on 30 September 2009, it was announced that the circuit had agreed a deal which would keep it on the calendar until 2018, under a new deal which saw the circuit management and FOA sharing the financial burden of hosting the event. This alternating pattern continued, with Hockenheim hosting the race in even years, and the Nürburgring hosting the race in odd years until 2013.

====Biennial race at Hockenheim====
The Nürburgring went through a change of ownership during 2014, but the new owners were unable to sign an agreement to continue hosting the race in odd-numbered years. The Hockenheimring wasn&#x27;t able to host the 2015 or 2017 events either and the German Grand Prix was not run. Thus the race became a biennial event, returning to the calendar in 2016 and 2018 at Hockenheim.

====One more visit to Hockenheim====
The deal with Hockenheim to host the German Grand Prix concluded following the 2018 event. As a result, the future of the event was put in doubt. However, a deal was reached in August 2018 to hold one more event at Hockenheim in .

==== Absence ====
No new deal was made with Hockenheim following the 2019 edition and the German Grand Prix was not on the Formula One calendar in 2020 and subsequent years. Due to multiple Grands Prix being cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic a race, titled the Eifel Grand Prix, was held in Germany at the Nürburgring in October 2020 as a replacement event.

<text>Yeah Yeah Yeahs is the debut EP by American indie rock band Yeah Yeah Yeahs, released in 2001 by the band&#x27;s own label, Shifty. It is sometimes incorrectly called &quot;Master&quot; due to the prominence of a necklace bearing that word on the album&#x27;s cover. It reached number 1 on the UK Indie Chart. As of 2009, sales in the United States have exceeded 71,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The EP was named &quot;NME&quot;″s second best single of 2002.

==Track listing==
The track &quot;Our Time&quot; interpolates the Tommy James and the Shondells song &quot;Crimson and Clover&quot;; when Karen O sings &quot;&quot;It&#x27;s the year to be hated / So glad that we made it&quot;,&quot; the melody is taken from the hit song, which reached #1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1969.

<doc id="349787" wikidata="Q7434070" url="?curid=349787" title="Scissors (game)">
<text>Scissors is a party game in which the rules of game are hidden from some of the players. Players will sit in a circle and pass a pair of real or imaginary scissors to the player to the left of them. The scissors may be passed open or closed, depending on a rule which is known only to one or two players. As each player passes the scissors they will declare whether the scissors are open or closed as they attempt to deduce the rule. A player wins when they deduce the rule, so consistently pass the scissors in the correct form. Variants of this game have been recorded as early as the nineteenth century.

== Play ==

The players sit on chairs in a circle, preferably without a table in the way, and have an object such as an empty plastic drink bottle or even a genuine pair of scissors. In turn, each player passes the object to the player on their left stating whether they are &quot;passing the scissors open&quot; or &quot;passing the scissors closed&quot;. As each player does this the others say whether they have got it right — the players who already know the game judge whether the passing was correct or not. The objective of the game is to work out what is going on and consistently find the correct method of passing.

== Solution ==
The most common solution to this game is that scissors are passed closed if your legs (or even ankles) are crossed, or if the passer&#x27;s hands are closed, and the scissors are passed open if uncrossed or if the passer has their hands open. At the beginning of the game positions and movements should be natural. Towards the end, they will need to be heavily exaggerated.

== Other variations ==
Other variations of this game theme are common, where different objects work as the &quot;scissors&quot; with the same solution, or with slightly different solutions — for example, the legs may need to be uncrossed when not passing, or the pass may need to be done so that the passing arm crosses the body. There may also be a combination of actions, such as needing to pass a pair of scissors blade-first to the next player as well as crossing or uncrossing the legs; the player may realize that one part is necessary but not the other.

In Finland, a similar game is played under the name &quot;Näin räätäli sakset antaa&quot; (&quot;This Is How The Tailor Hands The Scissors&quot;). As in the version described above, the trick is also to cross one&#x27;s legs or ankles while passing the scissors to the next person, but the same phrase of &quot;this is how the tailor hands the scissors&quot; is repeated no matter if the scissors are open or closed. Players who know the trick may fool others with complicated hand gestures or by emphasizing one of the words. The clueless participants will then unsuccessfully try to mimic the previous person who did it correctly. There is a game judge who knows the trick from the start and will watch people when they pass the scissors, telling them &quot;that&#x27;s right&quot; or &quot;no, that&#x27;s wrong&quot;. After some time passes, people may incidentally have their legs crossed, and eventually most people will figure out that crossing legs is the trick.

The Dropout panel show Game Changer was loosely based on Scissors when it was first pitched by host and current Dropout CEO Sam Reich. Every episode features a different game, with the players usually unaware of the game or its rules before play begins. While the show has largely shifted away from trial and error game mechanics, the second season&#x27;s finale episode was a close variation of Scissors. Reich, and a rotation of guest performers, repeatedly asked the three players a single question: &quot;Yes or no?&quot; and each received one point per &quot;correct&quot; response. In this case, the game&#x27;s secret rule prohibited one of the players, Brennan Lee Mulligan, from scoring points. This was played for laughs, with the notoriously competitive Mulligan growing visibly frustrated and ultimately delivering an impassioned monologue about the unfairness of the premise.

==Origin==

The origin of the game is unknown, but a similar game was referred to in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1899: 

The version now played was included in a 1905 games book:

<text>The Khobar Towers bombing was an attack on part of a housing complex in the city of Khobar, Saudi Arabia, near the national oil company (Saudi Aramco) headquarters of Dhahran and nearby King Abdulaziz Air Base on 25 June 1996. At that time, Khobar Towers was being used as living quarters for coalition forces who were assigned to Operation Southern Watch, a no-fly zone operation in southern Iraq, as part of the Iraqi no-fly zones.

A truck bomb was detonated adjacent to Building #131, an eight-story structure housing members of the United States Air Force&#x27;s 4404th Wing (Provisional), primarily from a deployed rescue squadron and deployed fighter squadron. In all, 19 U.S. Air Force personnel were killed and 498 of many nationalities were wounded. The official 25 June 1996, statement by the United States named members of Hezbollah Al-Hejaz () as responsible.

==The attack==

On 13 November 1995, a car bombing in Riyadh outside the headquarters of the OPM-SANG killed six Americans and two Indian citizens and injured about 70 others. This attack led the U.S. forces stationed at Khobar Towers to raise the threat condition to THREATCON DELTA. Days after this car bombing, military commanders briefed soldiers and airmen at Khobar that the U.S. had received anonymous communications from an organization claiming to have carried out the Riyadh attack. The attackers claimed their goal was to get the United States Armed Forces to leave the country, and that Khobar Towers would be attacked next if troop withdrawal did not begin immediately. It was at this time that surveillance and other suspicious activity near the perimeter fences of Khobar Towers was noted by United States Air Force Security Forces; however, the forces were forbidden by the Saudi government to act in any capacity outside the perimeter of the compound, and the surveillance continued with near impunity.

The attackers were reported to have smuggled explosives into Saudi Arabia from Lebanon. Al-Mughassil, Al-Houri, Al-Sayegh, Al-Qassab, and the unidentified Lebanese man bought a large latrine service tanker truck in early June 1996 in Saudi Arabia. Over a two-week period they converted it into a truck bomb. The group now had about of plastic explosives, enough to produce a shaped charge that detonated with the force of at least of TNT, according to a later assessment of the Defense Special Weapons Agency. The power of the blast was magnified several ways. The truck itself shaped the charge by directing the blast toward the building. Moreover, the relatively high clearance between the truck and the ground gave it the more lethal characteristics of an air burst.

It was originally estimated by U.S. authorities to have contained of explosives. Later the General Downing report on the incident suggested that the explosion contained the equivalent of of TNT. The attackers prepared for the attack by hiding large amounts of explosive materials and timing devices in paint cans and bags underground in Qatif, a city near Khobar. The bomb was a mixture of petrol and explosive powder placed in the tank of a sewage tanker truck.

Initially, the attackers attempted to enter the compound at the main checkpoint. When they were denied access by U.S. military personnel, at around 9:43 p.m. local time, they drove a Datsun scout vehicle, another car and the bomb truck, to a parking lot adjacent to building #131. A chain link security fence and a line of small trees separated the car park, used for a local mosque and park, from the housing compound. The perimeter of Building #131 was approximately from the fence line, with a perimeter road between the fence and building which was often used by military personnel for jogging. The first car entered the car park and signaled the others by flashing headlights. The bomb truck and a getaway vehicle followed shortly after. The men parked the truck next to the fence and left in the third vehicle. The bomb exploded three to four minutes later at approximately 10:20 p.m. local time. The blast was so powerful that it was felt away in the Persian Gulf state of Bahrain.

A U.S. Air Force security policeman, Staff Sergeant Alfredo R. Guerrero, was stationed atop Building #131 when he witnessed the men, recognized the vehicles as a threat, reported it to security, and began a floor-by-floor evacuation of the building. His actions are credited with saving dozens of lives. Many of the evacuees were in the stairwell when the bomb went off. The stairwell was constructed of heavy marble and was located on the side of the building away from the truck bomb, perhaps the safest location in the building. For his actions, Guerrero was awarded the Airman&#x27;s Medal.

Another security measure is thought to have minimized damage; along the security fence were Jersey barriers, concrete barriers commonly used along roadways. These deflected the blast energy upward, and away from the lower floors of the building, perhaps even preventing a total collapse of the structure.
The force of the explosion was enormous. The size of the explosion created an intense dust storm as the forces of the high pressure blast wave and the subsequent vacuum forces caused considerable damage in their own right. Several military vehicles parked to the left side of building #131 suffered no direct impact from debris, but were heavily damaged by the sheer intensity of the shock wave.

The explosion heavily damaged or destroyed six high rise apartment buildings in the complex. Windows were shattered in virtually every other building in the compound and in surrounding buildings up to a mile (1.6 km) away. A very large crater, wide and deep, was left where the truck had been. Within a few hours of the blast, the crater began to fill with salt-water from the Persian Gulf. In the minutes following the blast, the residents of the complex evacuated severely injured U.S. military personnel from the area. With power out in many of the buildings near #131, the scene was chaotic and tense as little was known about the safety of the area from further attacks. Many residents later gathered in the local dining facility, set up as a triage center, and saw breaking news of the event on large projection televisions intended to bring news of events back home to the troops.

==Aftermath==
===Investigation===
After the blast, an assessment crew consisting of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), and United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) was sent to assess the risk to other security compounds in Saudi Arabia, and to offer suggestions for the Khobar Towers complex. It was suggested that Mylar tape be used to coat the windows for a barrier, but the cost, about US$4.5 million, was considered prohibitive. It was also suggested that the perimeter be expanded to at least 500 feet to protect servicemen from flying glass.

====Intelligence and security failures====
After the bombing of Khobar Towers, the U.S. military and intelligence community came under heavy criticism for their lack of preparation and foresight for what was considered an intelligence failure. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;significant shortcomings in planning, intelligence, and basic security left American forces in Saudi Arabia vulnerable.&quot;

Numerous warnings had been made available to the intelligence community and military command, and up to &quot;ten incidents [were] reported suggesting that the Khobar Towers are under surveillance&quot; from April to June 1996. These warnings came both before and after the beheadings of four Saudi nationals after their publicly confessed role in the November 1995 attacks in Riyadh. Clinton Administration officials admit that they &quot;received a wave of threats against Americans and American installations in Saudi Arabia&quot; in the weeks leading up to the attack, &quot;but failed to prepare adequately for a bomb of the power that killed 19 American military personnel.&quot; Threats were also downplayed by the Saudis when Defense Minister Prince Sultan bin Abd al-Aziz al-Saud characterized acts carried out by Saudi Islamic jihadists in 1995 as &quot;boyish&quot;, and stated that the Saudi &quot;Kingdom is not influenced by threats&quot;. Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA) commented during a Senate intelligence committee meeting by saying &quot;there was no intelligence failure ... there had been more than 100 intelligence reports on alerts of a general nature, and very specific reports&quot; of an extant and present threat to the Khobar Towers complex.

The CIA was blamed for misjudging the bomb-making capabilities of Saudi militants, arbitrarily deciding that no bomb could exceed the size of that used in the November 1995 bombings in Riyadh (200 lbs). According to official U.S. government estimates, the Khobar bomb weighed in at approximately 5,000 pounds. American commanders were also blamed, as they had not taken every precaution advised by the Pentagon; specifically, because &quot;the project was deemed too costly&quot;, they had failed to implement a recommendation to coat Khobar&#x27;s windows with plastic to prevent flying glass.

The main security concern at the Khobar Towers compound before the bombing had been the prevention of an attack similar to the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings, when a vehicle-bomb entered the compound itself. Yet the Pentagon&#x27;s report from that incident suggested, as did the Khobar report, that a Beirut-sized bomb would still have caused significant damage from as far as 300 feet away. Officials concluded with the observation that bomb size was less important to the production of catastrophic results than that same bomb&#x27;s effective proximity (blast radius).

=== Operational relocation ===
As a result of the terrorist attack, U.S. and coalition military operations at Khobar and Dhahran were subsequently relocated to Prince Sultan Air Base, a remote and highly secure Royal Saudi Air Force installation near Al-Kharj in central Saudi Arabia, approximately 70 miles from Riyadh. American, British, and French military operations would continue at Prince Sultan until late-2003, when French forces withdrew and American and British operations shifted to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.

==Culpability==
===Initial blame===
The bombing of Khobar Towers, according to the Saudi government, was carried out by &quot;Saudi Islamic militants, including many veterans of the Afghan War.&quot; One U.S. official claimed that &quot;it now seems it was not an isolated case. There is an organization of violent opponents whose members are loosely connected, organized in semi-independent cells like other violent fundamentalist movements in the Arab World.&quot;

===Indictment===
In April 1997, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John Shalikashvili, said that the Pentagon did not have sufficient evidence about the bombers to consider retaliation against foreign countries that may have played a role.

In June 2001, an indictment was issued in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in Alexandria, Virginia charging the following people with murder, conspiracy, and other charges related to the bombing:
* Ahmed Ibrahim Al-Mughassil
* Hani al-Sayegh who had been previously in U.S. custody but deported to Saudi Arabia, when charges against him were dropped due to a lack of evidence.
* Ali al-Houri
* Ibrahim al-Yaqoub
* Abdel Karim al-Nasser
* Mustafa al-Qassab
* Sa’ed al-Bahar
* Abdallah al-Jarash 
* Hussein al-Mughis
* Ali al-Marhoun
* Saleh Ramadan
* Mustafa al-Mu’alem
* Fadel al-Alawe
* John Doe (described as a Lebanese)

In July 2001, Saudi Arabia said that eleven of the people indicted in the US were in custody in Saudi prisons, and were to be tried in Saudi court, as the country refused to extradite any of them to the United States to stand trial. The government has not since made public the outcome of the trial or the whereabouts of the prisoners.

In August 2015, Arab newspaper &quot;Asharq Al-Awsat&quot; reported that Ahmed Ibrahim Al-Mughassil, a leader of the gulf shia group Hezbollah Al-Hejaz found to be responsible for the bombing, had been arrested in Beirut and transferred to Saudi Arabian custody; an anonymous American intelligence officer told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the Saudi government had not confirmed the arrest, but U.S. intelligence believed the report was accurate.

===Attribution to al-Qaeda===
Abdel Bari Atwan wrote:
In 2004, the 9/11 Commission noted that Osama bin Laden was seen being congratulated on the day of the Khobar attack, and stated there were reports in the months preceding the attack that Bin Laden was seeking to facilitate a shipment of explosives to Saudi Arabia. According to the United States, classified evidence suggests that the government of Iran was the key sponsor of the incident, and several high-ranking members of their military may have been involved. A U.S. federal court speculated that the Khobar Towers bombing was authorized by Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran.

William Perry, who was the United States Secretary of Defense at the time that this bombing happened, said in an interview in June 2007 that &quot;he now believes al-Qaida rather than Iran was behind a 1996 truck bombing at an American military base.&quot;

On 22 December 2006, high court judge Royce C. Lamberth ruled that Iran and Hezbollah were directly and personally responsible for the attack, stating that the leading experts on Hezbollah presented &quot;overwhelming&quot; evidence of the group&#x27;s involvement and that six captured Hezbollah agents detailed the role of Iranian intelligence and military officials in providing money, explosives, arms and weapons, plans, and maps. This decision was reached as a default judgment, however, in which the Iranian government was not represented in court, because they chose not to challenge the allegations in a U.S. courtroom.

=== Implications for U.S.–Iran relations ===
Within days of the blast, counterterrorism officials on Clinton’s National Security Council staff concluded that elements inside Iran, specifically the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), were the perpetrators. They put pressure on the president and his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, to take action. They were joined by others inside and outside the administration, notably FBI Director Louis J. Freeh and &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Thomas Friedman. Before taking action, President Clinton insisted on proof that could stand up in both a court of law and the court of public opinion. In the meantime, he ordered a review of military options in case of a decision to punish Iran.

By the time Saudi Arabia and the FBI concluded their investigations, Iranians had elected a new president, Mohammad Khatami, in May 1997. Khatami surprised the international community by urging a &quot;dialogue of civilizations&quot; with the West in order to overcome almost two decades of animosity and Iranian isolation. Clinton, who had initially taken a stand toward the Islamic Republic, including imposing major economic sanctions on the country, reversed his thinking in the hope that Khatami potentially represented a game-changing shift in Iran&#x27;s conduct.

The prospect of an opening with Tehran, which intrigued many U.S. allies and even domestic critics of administration policy, drove Clinton&#x27;s response to the Khobar attack. The White House and State Department sent various signals to the Iranians, some of which they reciprocated, but ultimately hopes for a significant improvement in relations remained unfulfilled.

In June 1999, Clinton authorized what he later called a &quot;Hail Mary,&quot; sending a direct message to Khatami. Delivered by Omani Foreign Minister Yousef bin Alawi in July, the letter attempted to achieve multiple purposes: to signal Tehran that Washington was open to a rapprochement but also to make clear that the United States held the IRGC responsible for the bombing. Clinton was under pressure from FBI Director Freeh and other domestic actors to press for accountability for the attack.

The attempt backfired. Although Khatami was reportedly happy with the American initiative, especially because it was accompanied by an oral message of strong personal support from Clinton delivered by the Omani envoy, the Iranian president&#x27;s colleagues in the leadership, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, reacted vehemently to the text of the letter. Two months later, the Iranians responded with a written denunciation of the allegation of culpability and a refusal to consider boosting bilateral ties under such circumstances.

Beyond the Clinton administration&#x27;s miscalculation of Iranian politics, the episode showed that the bombing would continue to cast a long shadow over U.S.–Iran relations in years to come.

<text>Fever to Tell is the debut studio album by American indie rock band Yeah Yeah Yeahs, released on April 29, 2003, by Interscope Records. It was produced by David Andrew Sitek and mixed by Alan Moulder. Four singles were issued, the first being &quot;Date with the Night&quot; followed by &quot;Pin&quot;, &quot;Maps&quot; and &quot;Y Control&quot;.

&quot;Fever to Tell&quot; was both a critical and commercial success; it has sold one million copies worldwide.

==Recording and production==
By 2002, Yeah Yeah Yeahs had achieved a respected reputation for their live performances and critical acclaim for their debut EP, leading to several overtures from major record labels. The band wanted to finance their debut album themselves and chose to record at the low-budget Headgear Studio in Brooklyn. &quot;It was really important for us to do it on our turf, on our terms&quot;, lead singer Karen O later told &quot;Spin&quot;. &quot;We were all living together, and all the money we used to fund it came out of our pocket.&quot;

&quot;Fever to Tell&quot; was produced by Yeah Yeah Yeahs with David Andrew Sitek, a multi-instrumentalist and producer from the band TV on the Radio. Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist Nick Zinner first met Sitek while working together at a Brooklyn clothing store, and he went on to drive and manage them for their first concert tour. In 2002, the band asked Sitek to produce their debut album. Karen O recalls the decision in an interview with Lizzy Goodman for her 2017 book &quot;Meet Me in the Bathroom&quot;. &quot;I remember him giving me a few burned CDs of stuff that he had worked on&quot;, Karen O said. &quot;I guess he was just a buddy, and we felt immediately like we were family with him. And we didn&#x27;t know anyone else. That was probably one of the biggest reasons we worked with him, because we didn&#x27;t know anyone else. Then, of course, he ended up being really fucking masterful.&quot;

Once the recording was finished, the album was mixed in London by Zinner and sound engineer Alan Moulder.

==Musical style==
According to &quot;Paste&quot;, &quot;Fever to Tell&quot; was representative of the early-2000s&#x27; garage rock revival, while Dan Epstein from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the record an &quot;NYC art-punk landmark&quot;. Its music was also described as &quot;ecstatic dance punk&quot;, by Alex Denney of &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Journalist Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the band &quot;are closer to Siouxsie and the Banshees (but with a grin) and Led Zeppelin (but with estrogen) than to the blues&quot;. The slow closing track &quot;Modern Romance&quot; was compared to a Velvet Underground drone. Music historian Nick Kent compared Karen O&#x27;s singing style to Lydia Lunch and PJ Harvey. Kent also described the record as musically &quot;Siouxsie Sioux jamming with Led Zeppelin&quot;. Journalist Alexis Petridis remarked that &quot;Y Control&quot; was based on a riff from art-rockers Big Black, then transformed into spacey new-wave pop.

==Marketing and sales==
&quot;Fever to Tell&quot; was released on May 3, 2003, by Interscope Records. It debuted at number 67 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the week of May 17. To promote the album, &quot;Date with the Night&quot; and &quot;Pin&quot; were released as the first two singles. Interscope wanted to release &quot;Maps&quot; earlier but the band&#x27;s resistance delayed it until February 2004, when the album had sold only 124,000 copies. The single became a hit on MTV and rock radio, charting at number nine on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Modern Rock Tracks, and its success helped triple sales of the album.

In March 2009, the album reached sales of more than one million copies worldwide. As of March 2013, &quot;Fever to Tell&quot; had sold 640,000 copies in United States.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Fever to Tell&quot; was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 85, based on 27 reviews. In a four star review, Andrew Perry of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;There are half a dozen songs under three minutes on &quot;Fever to Tell&quot;, and they sound absolutely complete&quot;. Andrew Perry from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called it an &quot;exhilarating dose of lo-fi garage-rock&quot;. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau observed &quot;a striking sound&quot; that is &quot;both big and punk, never a natural combo&quot;, and highlighted by Zinner&#x27;s &quot;dangerous riffs&quot;. He had reservations about the subject matter, however; while noting &quot;two human-scale songs toward the end&quot;, Christgau said &quot;to care about this band you have to find Karen O&#x27;s fuck-me persona provocative if not seductive, and since I&#x27;ve never been one for the sex-is-combat thing, I find it silly or obnoxious depending on who&#x27;s taking it seriously.&quot;

&quot;Fever to Tell&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album and was certified gold in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The video for &quot;Maps&quot; received nominations for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, and the MTV2 Award at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards. &quot;The New York Times&quot; chose &quot;Fever to Tell&quot; as the best album of 2003.

In June 2005, the album was ranked number 89 on &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005. Featuring in the 2010 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, &quot;Fever to Tell&quot; was hailed as &quot;the coolest and cleverest record of 2003&quot;. In 2009, the album was named by &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; the fifth, 24th, and 28th best album of the 2000s decade, respectively. In 2019, the album was ranked 38th on &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s 100 Best Albums of the 21st Century list. In 2020, it was ranked number 377 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s Top 500 Albums of All-Time.

===Impact and legacy===
&quot;Fever&quot;″s 2017 reissue garnered critical acclaim. &quot;The Line of Best Fit&quot;″s Joe Goggins wrote that it was &quot;still [the band&#x27;s] masterpiece&quot; and dubbed it &quot;a chaotic symphony in sex, debauchery and bottomless anxiety,&quot; positively comparing it to PJ Harvey&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Rid of Me&quot;. &quot;Uncut&quot;″s Michael Bonner praised that it stayed &quot;as visceral, as exciting, [and] as confounding as ever.&quot;

&quot;Fever to Tell&quot; has impacted several genres, especially within NYC&#x27;s early-&#x27;00s rock resurgence. In 2023, uDiscover Music&#x27;s Laura Stavropoulos wrote that dance-rock, NYC&#x27;s next wave, was put &quot;into motion&quot; through the &quot;groove-laden&quot; album. Within the era&#x27;s &quot;quickly calcifying&quot; garage rock revival, Stavropoulos wrote that it provided &quot;a sense of fun and urgency&quot; to the scene. In 2018, it was deemed &quot;one of [that scene&#x27;s] few enduring albums&quot; by Steve Foxe of &quot;Paste&quot;. The site rated it #15 out of the 50 all-time greatest garage rock albums. Within indie rock, &quot;Fever&quot; has left &quot;an indelible mark&quot;. In 2022, &quot;NME&quot;″s Erica Campbell wrote that it paved the way for the genre&#x27;s future &quot;devil may care frontwom[e]n and an abundance of rule-breaking by those seeking post-punk creativity.&quot;

<doc id="349798" wikidata="Q300182" url="?curid=349798" title="Frank Dobson">
<text>Frank Gordon Dobson (15 March 1940 – 11 November 2019) was a British Labour Party politician. As Member of Parliament (MP) for Holborn and St. Pancras from 1979 to 2015, he served in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Health from 1997 to 1999, and was the Labour Party nominee for Mayor of London in 2000, finishing third in the election behind Conservative Steven Norris and the winner, Labour-turned-Independent Ken Livingstone. Dobson stood down from his Parliament seat at the 2015 general election.

==Early life and career==
Dobson was born in 1940 in Dunnington, York, the son of Irene (&quot;née&quot; Shortland) and John William Dobson. His father, a railwayman, died when Dobson was sixteen years old. Dobson attended Dunnington County Church of England Primary School and the Archbishop Holgate Grammar School (now Archbishop Holgate&#x27;s School), where he was supported after the death of his father by a grant from the county council. He then studied economics at the London School of Economics, gaining a BSc in 1962. He worked at the headquarters of the Central Electricity Generating Board from 1962 to 1970 and for the Electricity Council from 1970 to 1975.

After contesting a seat on Camden London Borough Council in 1964, he was elected in 1971 and chosen virtually unopposed as Labour Group Leader, and therefore as leader of the council after the resignation of Millie Miller in 1973. Having a young family, Dobson stood down as leader and resigned from the council in 1975 in favour of a non-partisan job as assistant secretary of the office of the Local Government Ombudsman, which he held until 1979.

==Member of Parliament==
At the 1979 general election, Dobson was elected as MP for Holborn and St Pancras South (later Holborn and St. Pancras). He voted for Tony Benn for Labour Deputy Leader in 1981, but thereafter became disillusioned and chose to align with what he called the &quot;sane left&quot;.

Dobson&#x27;s naturally pugnacious style earned him rapid promotion to the front bench, where he served in several important posts from 1982. His liking for dirty jokes and conviviality won him many friends. He once remarked of Hazel Blears, who is 4&#x27;10&quot; in height, &quot;The good thing about global warming is that Hazel Blears will be the first to go when the water rises.&quot; After privatisation of the Rover Group in 1988 he quipped, &quot;The price charged for Rover was so low that there is some suspicion that Lord Young thought it was a dog.&quot; As Spokesman on Environment and London from 1994, he led the national Labour response to a series of scandals over City of Westminster council and its former leader Shirley Porter.

===In government===
Following Labour&#x27;s landslide victory at the 1997 general election, Dobson was appointed as Secretary of State for Health. This was a high-profile post, but Dobson found it hard to build an impact. He faced interference from civil servants, who would claim that prime minister Tony Blair raised the issue of further private sector involvement in meetings with Dobson, which Dobson said to them &quot;just wasn&#x27;t true&quot;. He also had his hands tied by the decision to stick within spending limits set by the previous Conservative government. Dobson wrote a memo to Blair saying, &quot;If you want a first-class service, you have to pay a first-class fare – and we&#x27;re not doing it.&quot; When money was finally diverted to the NHS, Blair credited Dobson for kickstarting it. Dobson&#x27;s abolition of the internal market in the NHS was reversed by his successor, Alan Milburn, who Dobson said was &quot;carried away with the idea that the private sector could make a big contribution&quot;. Dobson was also instrumental, working with Tessa Jowell, in establishing Sure Start, which aimed to improve childcare, early education and health care for families with children.

===Candidate for Mayor of London===

Dobson beat Ken Livingstone in the Labour Party&#x27;s internal selection process for the office of Mayor of London, helped by its electoral college system and the absence of any requirement for affiliated trade unions to ballot their members. In May 2000, Livingstone won the mayoral election as an independent candidate. Dobson finished in third place behind the Conservative candidate Steven Norris, and just ahead of the Liberal Democrat candidate Susan Kramer. Dobson was subsequently re-elected as an MP at the 2001 and 2005 general elections, albeit with reduced majorities.

==Political views==
In 2000, Dobson was named &quot;Beard 2000&quot; by the Beard Liberation Front, amid controversy over his claim that Labour spin doctors had told him to shave off his prize-winning beard for the upcoming elections for Mayor of London. Dobson said he had told them to &quot;Stick it up their wicket&quot;.

He was the subject of controversy for living in a council flat while receiving a six-figure minister&#x27;s salary. He continued to live there, despite owning a large property in Yorkshire. In an interview in July 2014, he responded to this criticism, saying: &quot;I first lived there when we were subtenants of a subtenant of a private landlord. We were then sold to Camden council. What should I have done? Exercised the right to buy, which I voted against?&quot;

In the Labour leadership controversy after Tony Blair&#x27;s declaration he would step down within a year of September 2006, Dobson called for Blair to step down right away and end uncertainty. He also attacked Alan Milburn for making a &quot;terrible mess&quot; of the NHS. Milburn had been mentioned by Charles Clarke as a potential future Labour leader several hours earlier.

Dobson was criticised for hypocrisy after he spoke against Post Office closures, then voted for such closures in Parliament.
In the expenses scandal, he supported the Speaker of the House in his attempts to block exposure of expenses, arguing he was merely being scapegoated (for example, on BBC Radio 4 on 16 May 2009). He also supported the Speaker in allowing a warrant-less search of the offices of Conservative MP Damian Green.

A survey of his constituents revealed that in 2008, Dobson responded to 69 letters out of 269 sent through WriteToThem.com, putting him in 605th place out of 638 MPs for which data was available.

==Personal life==
Dobson&#x27;s brother Geoff, a schoolteacher, died of liver cancer on the eve of Labour&#x27;s landslide general election victory in 1997. Dobson married Janet Mary Alker; they had three children.

With his &quot;portly frame, jovial expression and bright white beard&quot;, Dobson was sometimes compared jokingly to Father Christmas. He supported West Ham United.

Dobson died at Homerton University Hospital in London on 11 November 2019, at the age of 79. His death drew tributes from former Labour prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, the then Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, his constituency successor Keir Starmer, and Labour&#x27;s current London mayor, Sadiq Khan.

<doc id="349811" wikidata="Q1137323" url="?curid=349811" title="SPIM">
<text>SPIM is a MIPS processor simulator, designed to run assembly language code for this architecture. The program simulates R2000 and R3000 processors, and was written by James R. Larus while a professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The MIPS machine language is often taught in college-level assembly courses, especially those using the textbook &quot;Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface&quot; by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy ().

The name of the simulator is a reversal of the letters &quot;MIPS&quot;.

SPIM simulators are available for Windows (PCSpim), Mac OS X and Unix/Linux-based (xspim) operating systems. As of release 8.0 in January 2010, the simulator is licensed under the standard BSD license.

In January, 2011, a major release version 9.0 features QtSpim that has a new user interface built on the cross-platform Qt UI framework and runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS. From this version, the project has also been moved to SourceForge for better maintenance. Precompiled versions of QtSpim for Linux (32-bit), Windows, and Mac OS X, as well as PCSpim for Windows are provided.

== The SPIM operating system ==
The SPIM simulator comes with a rudimentary operating system, which allows the programmer usage of common used functions in a comfortable way. Such functions are invoked by the -instruction. Then the OS acts depending on the values of specific registers.

The SPIM OS expects a label named as a handover point from the OS-preamble.

== SPIM Alternatives/Competitors ==
MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) is a Java-based IDE for the MIPS Assembly Programming Language and an alternative to SPIM.
Its initial release was in 2005. However, as both of its maintainers have since retired, the project is no longer under active development.

Imperas is a suite of embedded software development tools for MIPS architecture which uses Just-in-time compilation emulation and simulation technology.
The simulator was initially released in 2008 and is under active development.
There are over 30 open source models of the MIPS 32 bit and 64 bit cores.

Other alternative to SPIM for educational purposes is The CREATOR simulator. CREATOR is portable (can be executed in current web browsers) and allow students to learn several assembly languages of different processors at the same time (CREATOR includes examples of MIPS32 and RISC-V instructions).

<doc id="349816" wikidata="Q1347698" url="?curid=349816" title="Linus Yale Jr.">
<text>Linus Yale Jr. (April 4, 1821 – December 25, 1868) was an American businessman, inventor, mechanical engineer, and metalsmith. He was a co-founder with millionaire Henry R. Towne of the Yale Lock Company, which became the premier manufacturer of locks in the United States. He was the country&#x27;s leading expert on bank locks and its most important maker. By the early 20th century, about three-quarter of all banks in America used his bank locks. He is best remembered for his inventions of locks, especially the cylinder lock, and his basic lock design is still widely distributed today, and constitutes a majority of personal locks and safes.

== Biography ==
=== Youth ===
Linus Yale Jr. was born in Salisbury, New York. His ancestors were of the same family as Elihu Yale, the benefactor to and namesake of the well known Yale University. The Yale family of America were all descended from the same ancestor, Thomas Yale, Elihu&#x27;s only uncle with the Yale name. Thomas Yale was the stepson of Governor Theophilus Eaton. 

Yale&#x27;s father, Linus Yale Sr., opened a lock shop in the 1840s in Newport, New York, specializing in bank locks; he was a successful inventor who specialized in expensive, handmade bank locks and mechanical engineering, and who held eight patents for locks and another half dozen for threshing machines, sawmill head blocks, and millstone dressers.

=== Career ===

After some regular education, Yale Jr. joined his father&#x27;s business and introduced some revolutionary locks that utilized permutations and cylinders. In 1857, he established the Yale &amp; Greenleaf Lock Co. with his future brother-in-law, Congressman Halbert S. Greenleaf, who also financed the venture. In 1858, Yale&#x27;s father died, and Linus Yale Jr. became more involved with his father&#x27;s lock company. Yale Jr. was joined in the family business by his cousin, Charles Oscar Yale, who was also a prolific lock inventor with several patents. 

Yale opened his own shop about 1860 in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts, specializing in bank locks. He later founded a company with millionaire Henry Robinson Towne in the South End section of Stamford, Connecticut, called the Yale Lock Manufacturing Company. Throughout his career in lock manufacturing, Yale acquired numerous patents for his inventions and received widespread acclaim from clients regarding his products.

=== Personal life ===
Linus was personal friends and frequent correspondent with the abolitionist Congressman William Morris Davis.

== Work ==
=== Portrait painting ===
Young Yale developed an early affinity for portrait painting, but about 1850 switched interests to assist his father with improving bank locks and studying mechanical problems. However, his artistic expertise later proved useful, sketching clear and accurate diagrams for his later lock designs.

=== Locks and mechanisms ===

In the 1860s, around the time he had opened his own shop in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts, Yale specialized in bank locks. He introduced some combination safe locks and key-operated cylinder locks that were improvements on previously used locks. Possessing admirable skills in mechanics and lock making, Yale created one of the first modern locks that used a pin-tumbler design.

The pin-tumbler design is also known as the cylinder design, and plays significant roles in today&#x27;s locks and safes. Yale had previously harbored the practical implementation of the tumbler lock for decades, and had sketched the idea in 1844. Yale was convinced that key holes in traditional locks made the locks susceptible to thieves who could use picks, gunpowder explosives, and heat to thwart the locks. This led him to employ permanent dial and shaft designs in his inventions, known as &quot;combination locks&quot; today. Yale&#x27;s best-known lock design, the cylinder pin-tumbler lock, utilized a key-operated lock concept first conceived in ancient Egypt over 4,000 years ago.

Yale&#x27;s inventions were so successful and received such critical acclaim that he exhibited several of his lock designs at world&#x27;s fairs in the United States and overseas, winning a number of awards at these exhibitions.

Throughout his career Yale acquired many patents, mostly related to his inventions of locks and safes, but also including mechanical problems. In 1858, he patented a device for adjusting at a right angle the joiners&#x27; square. In 1865 he patented a tool for reversing the motion of screw-taps. In 1868 he received two patents for improvements in mechanics&#x27; vises.

=== Inventions ===
Yale had many inventions to his name throughout his career, thoroughly revolutionizing the locks industry and improving the security of financial institutions. Drawing on the principles first put to use in large wooden locks built by ancient Egyptians, Yale patented a pin tumbler lock for use in banks in 1851; he patented his pin tumbler lock for use in doors in 1863; in 1865 he patented the pin tumbler padlock, which are still widely used today. Yale&#x27;s model of the padlock was smaller, sturdier, more reliable, and innovative, proving to be a distinction among locks of his day.

==== Yale Bank Lock ====

In 1851 Yale invented what he referred to as the &quot;Yale Magic Infallible Bank Lock&quot;, for safes and bank vaults. This design allowed the owner to change its combination and would also allow the key to secure the lock while being hidden away from the exterior of the door by a hardened steel plate, which covered the key-hole behind it.

Yale stated nine peculiarities for his Yale Magic Infallible Bank Lock that separated it from its peers: [1]
# Being without springs, there are none to fail; it is impossible to damage by fire, dampness, or neglect. The design rid itself of the vices of the springs that become rusty or softening by heat or moisture.
# The lock has a head that is detached from its key-bits, thus leaving a space between the head and the key-hole, making it virtually impossible to be picked.
# When the key is withdrawn, all print or record of its action is obliterated, and no tell-tale left for duplicate keys to be made
# Powder proof. No powder can possibly be introduced into the lock itself, which eliminates the threat of gunpowder explosions.
# Permutation lock has the ability to rearrange new key combinations.
# In the event of a lost key, a duplicate key can be set up to unlock the lock, and upon changing the arrangement of the lock, the lost key will be powerless to open the lock.
# The portability of the key conveys a vast advantage over traditional bank locks.
# Every motion of the lock is derived from movement of the hands rather than elements beyond the operator&#x27;s control, such as dirt, rust, or memory.
# The lock is not liable to get out of order, having been made by first class machinists.

==== Other locks ====
;Yale Safe Lock
Yale&#x27;s second great invention came around 1863, which he coined the name &quot;Yale&#x27;s Magic Infallible Safe/Door Lock&quot;. This lock has many of the scintillating qualities of the Yale Bank Lock, and is designed for fire-proof safes and cash doors, among other items. It does not utilize springs, and is powder, damp, fire, and thief proof. The lock is not, however, a permutation lock, but each lock is unique and two different locks can never be opened with the same key. In addition, the key must be withdrawn from the lock before the bolt can be unlocked, preventing the liability of carelessly leaving the key in the keyhole.

;Yale Chilled Iron Vaults and Safes
Yale&#x27;s other significant invention is the Chilled Iron Bank Doors and Vaults. Previous bank doors, vaults, and safes had plates of hard cast behind soft wrought iron, which can be easily broken using the right amount of leverage and skillful vault-picking. The hard casts are often rigid and fragile, and susceptible to heavy tinkering. Yale used a lattice screen, or basketwork of soft, tough wrought iron, instead of the hard cast, infused in the metal covering of the vaults, thus producing incomparably strong corners and surfaces that Yale presented to be unbreakable.

=== Yale Manufacturing Company ===
In 1868, Yale and Henry R. Towne founded the Yale Lock Manufacturing Company in Stamford, Connecticut, to produce cylinder locks.

Under Yale&#x27;s ingenuity and wide promotion of his inventions, Yale Locks quickly spread around major corporations in the United States and were widely adopted. Among some of Yale&#x27;s business tactics were exploiting the weaknesses in other locks and presenting how his were free of those vices; he did live demonstrations to corporate business executives and government officials that showed how he successfully picked the locks that were in operation. Due to these demonstrations and the sheer quality of Yale&#x27;s locks, Yale Lock Manufacturing quickly gained business ground. The company&#x27;s name was later changed to The Yale and Towne Manufacturing Company, which eventually became part of NACCO Industries.

; Cracking the Hobbs Lock
The prominent bank locks of Yale&#x27;s day were the Hobbs or Newell locks. In an effort to present his locks over the continued usage of the Hobbs Locks, Yale contacted notable bankers and set up a live demonstration in which he successfully picked a Hobbs Lock. As described by Samuel Hammond, one of the bankers present at Yale&#x27;s demonstration, &quot;[he] proved that the Hobbs lock is able to be picked and demonstrated it using a fake wooden key that he made&quot;. [1]

; Challenge to the World
As part of Yale&#x27;s business plan and effort to promote his Bank Locks, Yale presented a challenge to anyone who dared to pick his bank locks. He offered a $3000 (a hefty sum) reward to potential challengers, in the event that his locks were successfully picked.

== Reception ==

During the mid 1850s, bank robberies were a problem for many bankers and the U.S Government. Having proved their Yale Bank Lock was infallible, they obtained contracts with the leading banks. In 1856, after a commission appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury, the US Treasury Department selected Yale&#x27;s enterprise to become the sole supplier of bank locks, safe locks, burglar proof safes, and vault doors, for all the new Mint, Sub-Treasuries, and Custom-Houses in the United States, and received praised from U.S. Mint director, James Ross Snowden in correspondence letters. Customers included the Bank of New York, American Express, Knickerbocker bank, and dozens of other banks.

The utility of Yale Locks were soon widely approved and favored upon, and implemented by many firms and government agencies in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, among various CEOs and Presidents of major corporations. Leading banks and bankers of the era hired him as a consulting expert and engineer to design their safes and locks.

The clients&#x27; satisfaction in Yale&#x27;s inventions was echoed in their appreciation letters addressed to Yale: [1]

::&quot;Briggs Bank, Clyde, April 30, 1856
::Linus Yale Jr.,
::Dear Sir: *** About two months since, during a dark and stormy night, our bank was entered by burglars, through an adjoining cellar wall, and the vault, which was of brick, was pierced, which left us without any other protection than one of your highly approved chilled iron Burglar-Proof Safes, with your magic lock attached; these we deem sufficient, for they successfully resisted all the various devices and expedients known and practiced by burglars. We have the most implicit confidence in their strength and safety, and feel assured that when once locked, we are more secure than we should be with any other safe and lock ever yet invented.

::&quot;I am convinced to this knowledge of the true principles of locks has enabled [Yale], in his lock, to overcome not only this, but every other known method of picking; and, in fact, I consider it and all respects superior to any other lock in the market&quot;.

=== Death and legacy ===

On a business trip to New York City in 1868, the same year that the Yale Manufacturing Company was founded, Yale died suddenly of a heart attack while negotiating to have his locks installed in a skyscraper, the Equitable Building. By that time, his locks were already selling well, and under Towne&#x27;s management Yale Locks became the premier manufacturer of locks in the United States.

Yale&#x27;s Locks still play a major part in today&#x27;s security systems. In his later years, Yale perfected the mechanism known as the &quot;clock lock&quot; and invented the double lock, which placed two locks within one case to be operated by the same or different combinations. His improvements in locks and boxes for the post-offices are of recognized utility and worldwide adoption. The commonly used combination locks omnipresent today also owe their dues to Linus Yale Jr.

Following his death, his son John B. Yale joined Henry R. Towne, became Treasurer, and helped grow the enterprise into a global giant manufacturing business, employing 12 000 people with customers in 125 countries.

In 2006 Yale was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

== Family ==

Linus was married to Catherine Brooks, who was born into a prominent New England family, and was credited for her active work in the abolitionist cause in Philadelphia, where she worked as a teacher at the school of abolitionist architect Theodore Dwight Weld. She was the daughter of John Brooks, a doctor and member of the Legislature. His grandson was the Governor of Wyoming Bryant Butler Brooks, and his cousin was the Bishop of Massachusetts Phillips Brooks. Catherine&#x27;s favorite teacher was the famous Ralph Waldo Emerson, who was from Massachusetts as well. Her half-sister, Jean Brooks Greenleaf, was also married to Congressman Halbert S. Greenleaf, and was elected President of the New York State Women&#x27;s Suffrage Association. Together, they had three children.

* John B. Yale (1845−1904), who joined the Union League and married Marie Louise McCulloch, daughter of the U.S. Secretary of Treasury, Hugh McCulloch, who financed the American Civil War under Abraham Lincoln. He was also Treasurer of the Yale Lock Company, founded by his father, Representative of the Illinois Steel Company from N.Y. in the Empire Building, and scaled the Yale Lock Company with Henry R. Towne into a global company, with 12 000 workers and their products sold in more than 120 countries. The Illinois Steel Company was the largest steel producer in the United States and later acquired Carnegie Steel with J.P. Morgan.
* Madeline Yale (1847−1918), an artist and philanthropist who married Senator Henry Winn, son of Senator Reuben Winn.
* Julian L. Yale (1848−1909), the owner and President of Julian L. Yale &amp; Co., a Railway supply business from the Railway Exchange Building and the Rookery Building in Chicago. He introduced the Shelby Steel Tube to the railway market and was previously Vice-President of American Mckenna Process Company, a rail manufacturer with offices and plants in Illinois, Boston, and New Jersey. His customers were Carnegie Steel, Illinois Steel, Lackawanna Steel, etc. He also became a member of the Union League Club of New York, the Union League Club of Chicago, the Chicago Club, the Chicago Athletic Association, the Cliff Dwellers Club, the Union Club, and the St. Louis Club.

Another member of his family was William Henry Yale (born 1859), dry goods merchant, owner of Townsend &amp; Yale, one of the oldest and largest commission house in the U.S., with offices on Fifth Avenue, New York, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia. The firm was the sole agent of the Boston Manufacturing Company, one of the first factories in America. He was a Yale graduate, and a member of the Yale Club, Union League Club of New York, and Sons of the American Revolution. His father, Henry Clay Yale (1829–1897), was a member of the Union League Club of New York, and his great-grandfather, Broughton White, was Secretary of Founding Father Baron von Steuben, who also adopted Broughton after his father, Patriot Lt. White Jr., bankrupted himself financing the American War of Independence.

Linus was also a distant cousin of Gov. Elihu Yale of Yale University, media entrepreneur Moses Yale Beach, and Canadian fur trader James Murray Yale. His nephew was architect Merton Yale Cady.

<text>The pin tumbler lock, also known as the Yale lock after the inventor of the modern version, is a lock mechanism that uses pins of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key.

Pin tumblers are most commonly employed in cylinder locks, but may also be found in tubular pin tumbler locks (also known as radial locks or ace locks).

== History ==
The first known example of a tumbler lock was found in the ruins of the Palace of Khorsabad built by king Sargon II (721–705 BC.) in Iraq. Basic principles of the pin tumbler lock may date as far back as 2000 BC in Egypt; the lock consisted of a wooden post affixed to the door and a horizontal bolt that slid into the post. The bolt had vertical openings into which a set of pins fitted. These could be lifted, using a key, to a sufficient height to allow the bolt to move and unlock the door. This wooden lock was one of Egypt&#x27;s major developments in domestic architecture during classical times.

Such a lock, however, may be defeated by lifting the pins uniformly beyond the unlatching point. In 1805, the earliest patent for a double-acting pin tumbler lock one where lifting the pins too much or too little prevented opening was granted to American physician Abraham O. Stansbury in England. It was based on earlier Egyptian locks and Joseph Bramah&#x27;s tubular pin tumbler lock. Two years later, Stansbury was granted a patent in the United States for his lock.

In 1848, Linus Yale Sr. invented the modern pin-tumbler lock. In 1861, Linus Yale Jr., inspired by the original 1840s pin-tumbler lock designed by his father, invented and patented a smaller flat key with serrated edges, as well as pins of varying lengths within the lock itself, the same design of the pin-tumbler lock in use today.

== Design ==
The pin tumbler is commonly used in cylinder locks. In this type of lock, an outer casing has a cylindrical hole in which the &quot;plug&quot; is housed. To open the lock, the plug must rotate.

The plug has a straight-shaped slot known as the &quot;keyway&quot; at one end to allow the key to enter the plug; the other end may have a &quot;cam&quot; or lever, which activates a mechanism to retract a locking bolt. The keyway often has protruding ledges that serve to prevent the key pins from falling into the plug, and to make the lock more resistant to picking. A series of holes, typically five or six of them, are drilled vertically into the plug. These holes contain &quot;key pins&quot; of various lengths, which are rounded to permit the key to slide over them easily.

Above each key pin is one or more spring-loaded &quot;driver pins&quot;. Simple locks typically have only one driver pin for each key pin, but locks requiring multi-keyed entry, such as a group of locks having a &quot;master key&quot;, may have extra driver pins known as &quot;spacer pins&quot;. The outer casing has several vertical shafts, which hold the spring-loaded pins.

When the plug and outer casing are assembled, the pins are pushed down into the plug by the springs. The point where the plug and cylinder meet is called the &quot;shear point.&quot; With a key properly cut and inserted into the groove on the end of the plug, the pins will rise causing them to align exactly at the shear point. This allows the plug to rotate, thus opening the lock. When the key is not in the lock, the pins straddle the shear point, preventing the plug from rotating.

Commonly pin tumbler locks are found in a cylinder that can be easily unscrewed by a locksmith to facilitate rekeying. The first main advantage to a cylinder lock, also known as a profile cylinder lock or euro, is that the cylinder can be changed without altering the boltwork hardware. Removing the cylinder typically requires only loosening a set screw, then sliding the cylinder from the boltwork. The second is that it is usually possible to obtain, from various lock manufacturers, cylinders in different formats that can all be used with the same type of key. This allows the user to have keyed-alike, and master-keyed systems that incorporate a wide variety of different types of lock, such as nightlatches, deadbolts and roller door locks.

Typically, commercial padlocks can also be included, although these rarely have removable cylinders. Standardised types of cylinder include:

* Rim-mounted (also known as &quot;night latch&quot;) cylinders
* Euro cylinders
* Key-in-knobset cylinders
* Ingersoll-format cylinders
* American, and Scandinavian round mortise cylinders
* Scandinavian oval cylinders

There are also standardised cross-sectional profiles for lock cylinders that may vary in length - for example to suit different door thicknesses. These profiles include the europrofile (or DIN standard), the British oval profile and the Swiss profile.

== Other varieties ==

A tubular pin tumbler lock is a pin-tumbler lock with a round keyway.

A dimple lock is a pin tumbler lock where the bitting is located on the side of the key, rather than the top.

== Master keying ==

A &quot;master-keyed lock&quot; is a variation of the pin tumbler lock that allows the lock to be opened with two (or more) different keys. This type is often used for doorlocks in commercial buildings with multiple tenants, such as office buildings, hotels, student accommodation and storage facilities. Each tenant is given a key that only unlocks their own door, called the &quot;change key&quot;, but the second key is the &quot;master key&quot;, which unlocks all the doors, and is usually kept by the building manager, so they can enter any room in the building.

In a master-keyed lock, some or all of the pin chambers in the lock have three pins in them instead of two. Between the driver pin and the key pin is a third pin called the &quot;spacer pin&quot;, also known as a &quot;master wafer&quot;. Thus each pin line has two &quot;shear points&quot;, one where the driver and spacer pins meet, and one where the spacer and key pins meet. So the lock will open with two keys; one aligns the first set of shear points and the other aligns the second set of shear points. The locks are manufactured so one set of shear points is unique to each lock, while the second set is identical in all the locks. A downside of a lock configured in this way is that it may be easier to pick, because a pin stack with more shear points offers more chances for a picking attack to succeed. A more secure type of mechanism has two separate tumblers, each opened by one key.

More complicated master-key lock systems are also made, with two or more levels of master keying, so there can be subordinate master keys that open only certain subsets of the locks, and a top-level master key that opens all the locks.

== Vulnerabilities ==

The basic pin tumbler lock alone is vulnerable to several lock picking methods. The most straightforward include lock bumping and snap guns. To combat this, many higher security cylinders incorporate the use of a variety of specialised pins, collectively known as &quot;security pins&quot;, that are designed to catch in the lock cylinder if a snap gun or bump key is used. Some types of security pin are &quot;spool pins&quot; that have a narrow machined waist, so called because they resemble a cotton spool, and &quot;serrated pins&quot; which are driver and/or key pins that have one or more narrow grooves cut into them, known as &quot;serrations&quot;. Both these pin modifications can give an inexperienced or opportunist lock picker the illusion of progress by causing the lock core to partially rotate or emit extra clicks. These may make the pin appear to be set when in fact it is still blocking the shear line and preventing the lock from opening. These and other security pin designs can add delay (increasing the chance of being apprehended) and, by adding complexity, may deter an attacker who does not know how to defeat these countermeasures. Generally speaking, an attack by a sufficiently experienced picker may eventually succeed. Some security pins as well as different spring designs can also make a bumping attack less likely to succeed, though this may depend on factors such as the degree of variation in bitting height between adjacent cuts in the operating key.

Lock snapping is a method of forced entry that certain types of cylinder locks are vulnerable to. Lock snapping involves applying a strong torque force to the lock cylinder, usually with a pair of locking pliers, thereby breaking the mechanism and allowing access to the latch. It can take between 50 seconds and 2 minutes to snap the lock and gain entry. Police in the UK have estimated that around 22 million doors throughout the country could be at risk from lock snapping.

Lock snapping is possible when the lock has a weakness where the retaining bolt passes through a thinner part of the lock. A recent development is to build a lock with a front section that snaps off the main body, leaving enough of the mechanism behind to prevent access to the operating latch. Some designs feature more than one sacrificial section which can stop the door from being opened from the attacked side (even with the key) while allowing the door to be opened from the other side.

Criminals utilise a small blow torch to target the area of uPVC or composite material surrounding the euro lock and door handle. The reason for this is to create a hole deep enough to reach deep into the door concentrating on the euro lock area. The goal once having created the hole is to reach with mole grips deep past any sacrificial lines of an inferior euro cylinder lock. The weak point of any euro lock is the centre screw hole which essentially holds the lock in place but also above this centre screw hole is the euro locks cam switch which is the switch that locks and unlocks the door. Once past the initial sacrificial lines of the euro lock, the burglar applies pressure to the screw hole area located in the centre of the cylinder lock, which then breaks easily as per a standard lock snapping method.

Cylinders that meet either Sold Secure SS312 Diamond or TS007 3 Star standard will protect against drilling, picking, bumping, snapping, and plug extraction methods of attack. When fitting uprated cylinder door locks it is advisable to make sure they are paired with an effective security door furniture (handle).

<text>The War of the Eight Princes, Rebellion of the Eight Kings, or Rebellion of the Eight Princes () was a series of coups and civil wars among kings/princes (Chinese: &quot;wáng&quot; 王) of the Chinese Western Jin dynasty from 291 to 306 AD. The key point of contention in these conflicts was the paramountcy over the empire in light of the developmentally disabled Emperor Hui of Jin. The name of the conflict is derived from the biographies of the eight princes collected in Chapter 59 of the &quot;Book of Jin&quot;.

The &quot;War of the Eight Princes&quot; is somewhat of a misnomer: rather than one continuous conflict, the War of the Eight Princes saw intervals of peace interposed with short and intense periods of internecine conflict. At no point in the whole conflict were all of the eight princes on one side of the fighting (as opposed to, for example, the Rebellion of the Seven States). The initial conflicts prior to the coalition against Sima Lun in 301 also cannot be considered as wars, but rather a series of political intrigues and &quot;coups d&#x27;état&quot;. The literal Chinese translation, Disorder of the Eight Kings, may be more appropriate in this regard.

While initial conflicts were relatively minor and confined to the imperial capital of Luoyang and its surroundings, the scope of the war expanded with each new prince who entered the struggle. The civil wars opened the empire to rebellions, most notably by tribal subjects that had resettled into the Central Plains. At its conclusion, the war devastated the Jin heartlands in northern China, and ushered in the Sixteen Kingdoms era in northern China, causing more than a century of warfare between the numerous short-lived dynasties in the north and the Eastern Jin dynasty in the south.

==The Eight Princes==
While many princes participated in the conflict, the eight major players in this conflict were:

Other people of note included Emperor Hui of Jin, Emperor Hui&#x27;s first regent Yang Jun, Empress Dowager Yang, Empress Jia Nanfeng, and the senior minister Wei Guan. It is also important to note that the fiefdom titles of the princes do not reflect their base of operation. Although Sima Ying was the Prince of Chengdu, he mostly operated in Ye and was never near his fief, while Sima Yong, the Prince of Hejian, mainly stayed around Chang&#x27;an. Only Sima Yue made use of his fief in Donghai as a base during the course of the conflict. The rest of the princes were in Luoyang at their respective height of power.

The conflict can be divided into two parts. The initial period (290–291) mainly concerns the power struggle between the Yang and Jia clans as they fought for control for Emperor Hui in the wake of his ascension. Sima Liang and Sima Wei were the only two of the Eight Princes involved, and fighting was only limited to coups in the capital, Luoyang. The later period (300–306) began following the fall of the Jia clan, who held power over the imperial court behind Emperor Hui for a decade before they were deposed by Sima Lun in 300. This period, particularly after Sima Lun&#x27;s usurpation in February 301, escalated into a series of civil wars in northern China as Emperor Hui changed hands several times to the remaining six princes.

===Family Tree===








==Background==
Sima Yi, an official, general, and regent of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period, effectively seized control of Wei in early 249 after instigating a successful coup against his co-regent, Cao Shuang. Sima Yi and two of his sons, Sima Shi and Sima Zhao, came to serve as the &quot;de facto&quot; rulers of Wei. In February 266, Sima Zhao&#x27;s eldest son, Sima Yan, also known as Emperor Wu of Jin, forced the Wei emperor Cao Huan to abdicate the throne and established the Jin dynasty.

Sima Yan sought to learn from the mistakes that led to the Cao Wei&#x27;s downfall. Previously, the Wei regime had discouraged their princes from holding government and military offices, instead sending them away to live in their fiefs. Thus, Sima Yi, with the backing of the powerful gentry clans, was able to take control over the Wei government with minimal resistance. Identifying this issue, Sima Yan bolstered the power of the Sima clan by enfeoffing his uncles, cousins, and sons. Those with large enfeoffments were entitled to an army of five thousand, those with medium enfeoffments were entitled to an army of three thousand, and those with small enfeoffments were entitled to an army of one thousand five hundred. As time passed, these princes and dukes were given administrative powers over their lands and were granted the power to levy taxes and employ central officials; many were also given the right to command troops outside of their fiefdoms.

Emperor Wu&#x27;s reign was troubled by a succession crisis due to his heir, Sima Zhong, being developmentally disabled. Some ministers wanted Wu&#x27;s brother, the abled Sima You, to replace Zhong as the Crown Prince, but Wu was adamant in upholding the traditional succession law. Zhong was the son of Wu&#x27;s first empress, Yang Yan, and married to Jia Nanfeng, so he had the strong backing of the influential Yang and Jia clans. Another factor for choosing Zhong was that Wu saw great potential in his grandson, Sima Yu, should he succeed Zhong.

By empowering the princes, Emperor Wu intended for them to act as a safeguard for his successors against the gentry clans should they overstep their boundaries, even more so considering Sima Zhong&#x27;s disability. Wu had likely hoped that his family members, by virtue of their familial ties, would cooperate with each other to protect the interests of their dynasty. However, after Zhong took the throne and became a mere figurehead, the princes later proved themselves self-serving and willing to undermine one another for real control over the empire.

The War of the Eight Princes coincided with the upheaval of the so-called &quot;Five Barbarians&quot;; non-Chinese groups that had been resettling into the Chinese interior as far back as the Eastern Han dynasty. Through their civil wars and mismanagement of the empire, the Jin lost support from both the Chinese peasantry and the non-Chinese tribes, pushing them to join rebel groups in different parts of China. In 304, refugees from the Guanzhong led by the Ba-Di founded the Cheng-Han dynasty in Sichuan, while the Five Divisions (五部), descendants of the Southern Xiongnu, founded the Han-Zhao dynasty in Shanxi, thus beginning the Sixteen Kingdoms period. The princes also empowered the Xianbei by employing them as auxiliaries in the final years of the conflict. South of the Yangtze also saw the major rebellions of Zhang Chang and Chen Min, but these were eventually suppressed in the end.

== Prelude: Yang Jun (290-291) ==

=== Ascension of Emperor Hui ===
In late 289, Emperor Wu developed a deadly illness and considered appointing his father-in-law, Yang Jun, and his uncle, the Prince of Ru&#x27;nan, Sima Liang, as Sima Zhong&#x27;s regent. As the emperor&#x27;s health declined, Yang Jun sought to monopolize his control over Zhong as consort kin, first by sending away Sima Liang to Xuchang and then by forcing his court rival, Wei Guan, into retirement. Yang Jun also hid the emperor&#x27;s final decree appointing him and Sima Liang as co-regents while his daughter, the empress Yang Zhi, issued another edict making her father the sole regent. Emperor Wu was aware of Yang Jun&#x27;s manipulations, but was too ill to stop him.

On 16 May 290, Emperor Wu died, and Sima Zhong, posthumously known as Emperor Hui of Jin, ascended the throne. Yang Jun was instated as his regent while Yang Zhi was promoted to Empress Dowager. However, Yang Jun was not well received by his ministers due to his apparent attempts at consolidating power and refusal to take advice. He also tried to assassinate Sima Liang without success and rejected suggestions to cooperate with him. Meanwhile, the new empress, Jia Nanfeng, was unhappy with the little control she has over state affairs due to Yang Jun and the Empress Dowager.

=== Fall of the Yang clan ===
Empress Jia enlisted the help of Sima Liang and the Prince of Chu, Sima Wei to overthrow Yang Jun. Liang was reluctant to help her, but Wei agreed and left his fief for the capital, Luoyang with his troops. On the night of 23 April 291, Empress Jia and her allies sent out an imperial edict calling for the deposal of Yang Jun and occupied the gates leading to his residence. Yang Jun was caught by surprise and was unable to decide on his next move. Empress Dowager Yang Zhi tried to get the soldiers to turn on Empress Jia, but failed and implicated herself in the process.

Soon, the soldiers advanced and set fire to the residence. Yang Jun&#x27;s soldiers were routed, and he was killed while trying to escape. His families, supporters were all rounded up and executed as the extermination of all third degree relatives. Yang Zhi was spared but confined inside the palace, where she remained until her death in 292.

== Prince of Ru&#x27;nan, Sima Liang (291) ==
On 4 May 291, Sima Liang and Wei Guan were installed as the new regents of Emperor Hui. Now that he was in power, Liang asserted his authority by freely handing out new appointments and titles to around 1,081 people to garner support. At the same time, Empress Jia began placing her relatives and allies into positions of power.

Liang and Wei Guan were wary of Sima Wei. Despite his role in the Yang clan&#x27;s defeat, Sima Wei was notorious for his violent temperament. They attempted to strip him of his military power and send him back to his fief in Jing province, but Wei retaliated by conspiring with Empress Jia to depose them, claiming to her that the two were planning to overthrow her. Soon, Empress Jia produced an edict from the emperor calling for the removal of Liang and Wei Guan. However, Wei was unsatisfied with the content of the original edict, as he was not included among the princes who had to raise their troops. Without the empress&#x27;s knowledge, Wei forged an edict which made him Commander over all military forces and granted himself full control over the operation. On 26 July 291, he sent his subordinates and soldiers to arrest Liang and Wei Guan in Luoyang. Both men gave no resistance and were put to death.

==Prince of Chu, Sima Wei (291)==
The forged edict meant that Sima Wei held significant control over the military. Immediately following the deaths of Sima Liang and Wei Guan, he was advised to utilize his military authority to execute Empress Jia&#x27;s powerful relatives, Jia Mi and Guo Zhang. However, Wei was hesitant in accepting this plan. In Empress Jia&#x27;s camp, the minister, Zhang Hua urged her to punish Wei for killing the emperor&#x27;s regents. Just one day after Liang&#x27;s death, Empress Jia deployed her troops against Wei and spread doubt regarding the edict&#x27;s authenticity among his soldiers. Deserted by his followers, Wei was captured and executed. His full-brother Sima Ai the Prince of Changsha, who provided support, was demoted to the lesser title of Prince of Changshan as punishment.

== Interlude: Empress Jia (291–300) ==

=== Power behind the throne ===
For the next nine years, Empress Jia ruled Jin in the emperor&#x27;s name while entrusting power to her closest family members, most notably Jia Mi, and Guo Zhang. Despite the efforts of ministers like Zhang Hua and Pei Wei to uphold the government&#x27;s functionality, the imperial court under the Jia clan was beset with widespread corruption and bribery. Rumors began to spread of Empress Jia&#x27;s personal debauchery and tyrannical behavior, laying the seeds of discontent that would surface by the end of the decade.

Empress Jia also carried out a series of transfers that would influence the next stage of the War of the Eight Princes. In 296, a major tribal rebellion led by Qi Wannian broke out in Qin and Yong provinces under the watch of the Prince of Zhao, Sima Lun. Due to his failure to quell the uprising, Lun was recalled back to Luoyang. Later on, the Prince of Chengdu, Sima Ying was assigned away to Ye following a heated argument he had with Jia Mi over the latter&#x27;s treatment of the Crown Prince, Sima Yu. The Prince of Hejian, Sima Yong, was garrisoned in Guanzhong through the endorsement of the gentry families.

The rebellion in Qin and Yong coincided with famines and plagues, and although it was ultimately put down in 299, it sparked an influx of refugees fleeing south to Yi province. It also allowed a Di leader, Yang Maosou to set up the state of Chouchi south of Tianshui in 296.

=== Coup of Sima Lun ===
Empress Jia deemed the Crown Prince, Sima Yu as a threat to her power should he ascend the throne, since he was not her biological son. In early 300, she orchestrated his arrest by convincing him while drunk to copy a text that said, amongst other things, that Emperor Hui should abdicate in favor of him. Empress Jia then presented the copied text to Emperor Hui, who then decided to place him under house arrest.

Sima Lun was tutor to the prince at the time and had climbed his way into Empress Jia&#x27;s inner circle during his time in Luoyang. He also commanded some troops in the capital as general of the Right Army and was known to be &quot;avaricious and false&quot; as well as &quot;simple and stupid,&quot; heeding only the advice of Sun Xiu. Yu&#x27;s arrest sparked outrage among many officials, and a few of them approached Lun for his military strength to overthrow Empress Jia.

Lun had long wished to betray the empress, but Sun Xiu convinced him to wait until Yu was out of the way, arguing that because of Lun&#x27;s reputed loyalty to the empress, Lun&#x27;s actions would only lead to the accession of Yu, who would then exact revenge on Lun himself. With Lun&#x27;s encouragement, the empress had Yu assassinated. Lun then produced an edict allegedly from Emperor Hui calling for her removal. On 7 May 300, he arrested Empress Jia and put her under house arrest, and later forced her to commit suicide by drinking gold powered wine. He also executed many of her partisans, including Jia Mi, Zhang Hua and Pei Wei.

== Prince of Zhao, Sima Lun (300–301) ==
=== Usurping the throne ===
Sima Lun assumed regency over Emperor Hui, but delegated most of his power over to Sun Xiu. Lun and Sun Xiu plotted to take the throne by following the precedent of the Jin dynasty&#x27;s foundation. They awarded their family members and allies with high-ranking positions and noble titles, while also posthumously honoring Sima Yu and recruiting famed individuals into their administration to win the people&#x27;s support. Yang Xianrong, a distant relative of Sun Xiu, was installed as the new empress of Emperor Hui.

In autumn 300, after Lun attempted to take his military authority away, the Prince of Huainan, Sima Yun rebelled against Lun with only 700 men in Luoyang. Lun was nearly killed in the fighting, but one of his supporters pretended to defect to Yun and killed him, ending his rebellion. The rebellion provided Lun and Sun Xiu with pretext to purge their court rivals and oppositions. Meanwhile, the Prince of Qi, Sima Jiong, who played a vital part in Empress Jia&#x27;s arrest, was unhappy with the positions he received under Lun&#x27;s administration. Sensing his discontent, Lun had Jiong assigned away to Xuchang.

After Yun&#x27;s rebellion, Lun was granted the Nine Bestowments. The following year, he claimed in a report that the spirit of his father, Sima Yi, had ordered him to move into the Western Palace (西宮), the residence of Emperor Hui. He then forged an edict stating the self-abdication of Emperor Hui and usurped the throne on 3 February 301.

During Sima Lun&#x27;s regency, the Inspector of Yi Province, Zhao Xin, a relative of Empress Jia by marriage, rebelled in his province out of fear that he would be executed. Zhao Xin allied himself with the refugees from Qi Wannian&#x27;s rebellion. However, in early 301, these refugees, led by the Ba-Di leader, Li Te, ousted him from Chengdu and resubmitted to Jin.

=== Coalition of the Three Princes ===
Not long after his usurpation, Sima Jiong rebelled and sent out a proclamation to campaign against Sima Lun. The most important figure to accept his call was Sima Ying. Ying was described as beautiful but dull in the mind and did not read books, but he heeded his advisor Lu Zhi&#x27;s advice to rally the people to his cause. Some 200,000 troops, including the forces of the Prince of Changshan (later reappointed the Prince of Changsha), Sima Ai, were thus assembled near his base in Ye. In Chang&#x27;an, Sima Yong initially dispatched troops to support Lun but later sided with the coalition after learning that they were larger in size. Due to their strategic bases and command over vast armies, Jiong, Ying and Yong were collectively referred to as the &quot;Three Princes&quot; (三王) in records. Another notable participant of the coalition was the Duke of Xinye, Sima Xin, son of Sima Jun, a full brother of Sima Liang.

Lun sent Zhang Hong (張泓) and Sun Fu (孫輔) with 24,000 men to secure the passes and 30,000 under Sun Hui (孫會) to confront Ying. Zhang Hong fought Jiong at Yangdi (陽翟, modern Yuzhou, Henan) and defeated him several times before Jiong retreated and made camp at Yingyin (潁陰; in present-day Xuchang, Henan). However, one night, a disturbance occurred in Sun Fu&#x27;s camp, causing him to flee back to Luoyang and claim that Zhang Hong was defeated. Lun recalled a segment of his army to defend Luoyang, but when news of Zhang Hong&#x27;s recent victories reached him, he sent them out again to attack Sima Ying. However, by this time Jiong had reversed his early defeats and repelled Zhang Hong back to his camp.

Sun Hui led the main army against Ying at Huangqiao (黃橋, in present-day Wen County, Henan), defeating the prince&#x27;s vanguard and killing 10,000. Ying planned to retreat back to Zhaoge, but Lu Zhi advised him to carry out a surprise attack during the early morning. Sun Hui and his contemporaries were complacent by their recent victory and did not prepare any defense. Ying rallied his troops and returned with a counterattack, smashing Hui&#x27;s forces north of the Yellow River. Ying&#x27;s army was the first to make a breakthrough as they crossed the Yellow River to march on Luoyang.

As the coalition forces approached, officials and generals in the capital began to turn on Lun and Sun Xiu despite their attempts to suppress reports of their losses. The defeat at Huangqiao left Sun Xiu&#x27;s camp greatly alarmed as they struggled to devise a plan in response. On 30 May 301, the general of the Left Guard led troops into the palace and arrested Lun. Sun Xiu and many of Lun&#x27;s supporters were also captured and executed. Lun spent the next few days denouncing his own conduct before he was forced to commit suicide.

Emperor Hui was reinstated and celebrated the occasion with a five-day non-stop drinking binge. Ying was the first to reach the capital on 1 June, followed by Yong on 7 June. Jiong was still fighting Zhang Hong&#x27;s forces at Yangdi at the time, so Ying had to send his soldiers to assist him. After Zhang Hong and his peers surrendered, Jiong entered the capital with &quot;several hundred thousand armored soldiers, before whom the capital trembled in awe&quot; on 23 July.

== Prince of Qi, Sima Jiong (301–303) ==

=== Regency ===
On 11 August 301, Sima Jiong received the Nine Bestowments and was made regent of Emperor Hui. Jiong had intention to share his regency with Sima Ying, but through the advice of Lu Zhi, Ying withdrew to Ye to care for his ailing mother and handed over all major responsibility to Jiong. At Ye, Ying carried numerous popular policies to win over the people. He arranged for grain to be transported to the famine-stricken region of Yangdi, which had been devastated by war. He then had over 8,000 coffins constructed for high-ceremony funerals of those who had fallen in battle and over 14,000 of Sima Lun&#x27;s soldiers to be buried. These were all Lu Zhi&#x27;s ideas.

In May 302, the last of Sima Yu&#x27;s lineage died, throwing the line of succession into confusion. Sima Jiong designated the Emperor&#x27;s nephew, Sima Tan, as Crown Prince despite Sima Ying being a leading candidate. At the same time, Sima Yue, Prince of Donghai, was appointed to direct the Central Secretariat. Throughout his regency, Jiong alienated many of his ministers due to his arrogant and extravagant personality. He rarely visited the emperor and attended court meetings, and despite multiple attempts to get him to change his ways, he was reluctant to follow through his supporters&#x27; advices.

The minister, Wang Bao, was concerned about the various princes&#x27; military power, believing that they would one day use it against Jiong just as they did with his predecessors. In a letter to Jiong, Wang Bao urged him to send the princes back to their respective fiefs and to divide control over the state between him and Sima Ying. Jiong was initially convinced, but when the Prince of Changsha, Sima Ai, discovered the plan, he prompted Jiong to reject it and have Wang Bao executed.

Shortly after Lun&#x27;s defeat in May 301, the court issued an edict ordering refugees in Yi province to return north. However, many of them, including Li Te, refused to comply with the edict. In winter 301, the provincial inspector, Luo Shang declared war against Li Te.

=== Conspiracy against Jiong ===
Jiong wanted to appoint Li Han, one of Sima Yong&#x27;s chief of staff, to be colonel of the Army of Readiness. Li Han was afraid to accept the appointment due to enmity between himself and Huangfu Shang, one of Jiong&#x27;s advisers. Li Han fled back to Yong and conspired with him to rebel against Jiong. Yong was told to align himself with Sima Ying, offering him the role of Crown Prince due to his public support. He was also told to force Sima Ai, who was in Luoyang, into joining so that Jiong would execute him and provide justification to overthrow him.

In January 303, Yong rebelled while Ying, despite opposition from Lu Zhi, was tempted to join him. Yong sent Li Han and Zhang Fang to campaign against Jiong, and they sent a proclamation ordering Ai to attack Jiong. Believing that Ai was involved, Jiong sent troops to kill him, who fled to the imperial palace for protection. There, using both imperial guards and his own personal forces, Ai defended the palace against Jiong within Luoyang for three days, bringing Emperor Hui along with him. On 27 January, Jiong&#x27;s own officers betrayed him and he was captured and killed.

==Prince of Changsha, Sima Ai (303–304)==

=== Control over the imperial court ===
Sima Ai seized control of the capital but deferred authority to his half-brother, Sima Ying. The outcome of the conflict put a halt to Sima Yong and Ying&#x27;s plans, which frustrated the two princes. Ying in particular was unhappy with his restricted control over the state as he shared power with Ai, and the relationship between the brothers deteriorated over time.

Ai&#x27;s administration failed to deal with rebel movements in the empire. In the southwest, Li Te&#x27;s rebellion raged on despite his death. Along the Changjiang, rebels consisting of refugees and draft evaders led by the Man leader, Zhang Chang took up arms. When the court ordered Sima Yong to campaign against Zhang Chang, he refused to move his troops. Later, when the Prince of Xinye, Sima Xin, asked for permission to send his troops out, Ai rejected his request, believing that Xin was colluding with Ying, who he had good relations with, and plotting to rebel. Xin was killed in battle by the rebels, and Zhang Chang&#x27;s rebellion spread throughout the southern provinces.

Ai also employed Huangfu Shang as an advisor, putting Li Han at unease. Shang had a brother, Huangfu Zhong, who was the Inspector of Qin province, which placed him in a position to threaten Sima Yong&#x27;s rear in Guanzhong. Yong and Li Han conspired to have him arrested, but he saw through their plans and led his troops to attack Li Han. Ai tried to defuse the situation by recalling Li Han to Luoyang and ordering Zhong to disperse his troops, but Zhong refused. Finally, Yong secretly ordered Li Han to have Ai assassinated. Huangfu Shang discovered their plot and informed Ai, and so the prince had Li Han executed.

=== Siege of Luoyang ===
After the failed assassination attempt, Yong prepared his troops for war. At the time, Sima Ying was setting out to quell Zhang Chang&#x27;s rebellion, but hearing about the situation in Luoyang and Guanzhong, he took his troops to join Yong instead, once again ignoring Lu Zhi&#x27;s advice. In fall 303, Yong sent an army of 70,000 under Zhang Fang to attack the capital. Ying also sent an army 200,000 strong under Lu Ji against the capital.

Uncharacteristically, Emperor Hui commanded his own troops to help Sima Ai defend Luoyang. On 21 September 303, Ai sent 10,000 men under Huangfu Shang to oppose Zhang Fang, but he was defeated in a surprise attack. Zhang Fang momentarily broke through the city walls and carried out a mass plundering before withdrawing. Meanwhile, Emperor Hui was constantly on the move and shifting his base before he defeated Ying&#x27;s troops at Goushi (緱氏; in present-day Yanshi District, Henan) on 22 October. However, when Shi Chao threatened his position at Goushi, he returned to the palace a few days later.

On 2 November, Ai&#x27;s forces defeated Ying&#x27;s army again outside of Luoyang. The next day, Ai brought with him Emperor Hui and personally confronted Lu Ji&#x27;s army at the city gates. Ai&#x27;s officers had several thousand cavalry equipped with double-ended halberds charge Lu Ji&#x27;s forces, heavily defeating them. Many of Lu Ji&#x27;s officers were killed, and the dead on his side reportedly laid in piles and clogged the river. Lu Ji managed to escape but was arrested and executed on Ying&#x27;s orders. Meng Jiu (孟玖) replaced him as head of military operations.

Ai then moved west to face Zhang Fang. The emperor&#x27;s presence caused panic within Zhang Fang&#x27;s army, so he was badly defeated and lost 5,000 soldiers. Zhang Fang rejected his subordinates&#x27; advice to retreat and instead secretly constructed ramparts during the night. Ai thought that Zhang Fang had been dealt with, but after realizing that the ramparts had been completed, he attacked them unsuccessfully.

Ai&#x27;s officials attempted to negotiate peace with Ying, seeing that the two were brothers. However, when offered to split the empire between him and Ai, he rejected it. Ai personally wrote a letter to Ying to persuade him, but Ying would only accept it if Ai executed Huangfu Shang, which Ai refused to do.

Zhang Fang severed the Qianjin Dam (千金堨), effectively cutting off Luoyang&#x27;s water supply. In response, Ai convinced the Inspector of Yong province, Liu Chen, to defect from Yong&#x27;s side and attack Chang&#x27;an. He also sent Huangfu Shang out with an edict from the emperor to get the generals attacking Huangfu Zhong to disband, thus allowing him to send reinforcements to Luoyang. However, along the way, Huangfu Shang was captured and killed.

Ai held out in Luoyang until March 304, and by this point, Zhang Fang had given up hope of taking Luoyang and was planning to withdraw. Despite this fact, the Minister of Works, Sima Yue feared that Ai would not succeed in the long run. On March 17, he and a group of officials kidnapped and put Ai under house arrest. The next day, they opened the gates and surrendered to the enemy forces. However seeing how few of the opposing army remained, the capital troops regretted surrendering and secretly plotted to free Ai. Fearing the consequences should Ai escape, Yue sent Ai to Zhang Fang, who put Ai to the torch.

Although Ai was defeated, Yong was still threatened by Liu Chen, while Huangfu Zhong continued to resist in his city of Jicheng (冀城; in present-day Gangu County, Gansu). Yong recalled Zhang Fang to deal with Liu Chen, who had defeated a subordinate army on his way to Chang&#x27;an. On his way back, Zhang Fang seized over 10,000 slave women in Luoyang and cut them into mince meat to feed to his men. Liu Chen defeated Yong in succession, and 5,000 of his soldiers were able to break into Chang&#x27;an. However, he was slow to capitalize on his success, and the soldiers in Chang&#x27;an were eventually killed while Zhang Fang arrived just in time to defeat and capture him.

== Prince of Chengdu, Sima Ying (304–305) ==

=== Crown Prince ===
After Sima Ai&#x27;s death, Sima Ying appointed himself Prime Minister and promoted Sima Yue to President of State Secretariat. Despite his new position, Ying kept Emperor Hui at Luoyang, leaving behind an army of 50,000 under Shi Chao while he returned to his base in Ye. On April 304, he imprisoned the empress, Yang Xianrong, and depose his nephew, Sima Tan from the position of Crown Prince. On 1 May, Ying was installed as Crown Prince and his power was described as being equal to that of Cao Cao during the end of the Han dynasty. Sima Yong was also appointed the Grand Governor and Grand Commander. As Crown Prince, Ying was said to have become more brazen and extravagant in his actions and was inclined towards favoritism, which lost him some of the goodwill from his supporters.

=== Battle of Dangyin ===

On 17 August 304, Sima Yue rebelled in Luoyang, restoring Yang Xianrong and Sima Tan to their positions as Shi Chao and the others fled for Ye. He amassed an army of over 100,000 at Anyang and marched on Ying&#x27;s capital, bringing with him Emperor Hui. Along the way, Yue was errorneously informed that the soldiers in Ye had scattered, so he prepared very little defense against the enemy. Shi Chao confronted Yue on 9 September, and defeated him heavily at the Battle of Dangyin. The emperor was wounded in battle and captured by Shi Chao. Yue fled to Xiapi and then to his fief in Donghai, while Yue&#x27;s allies retreated back to Luoyang with Sima Tan.

=== Sack of Ye ===
With Yue defeated, Ying then planned to eliminate the Chief Controller of You province, Wang Jun, a former partisan of Empress Jia who refused to join the coalition against Sima Lun. Ying sent a general to assassinate him, but when the plot was uncovered, Wang Jun rebelled and allied himself with the Inspector of Bing province, Sima Teng, a brother of Sima Yue. Wang Jun&#x27;s army consisted of many Xianbei and Wuhuan soldiers due to his alliances with the neighbouring tribes, most prominently the Duan-Xianbei. In response, Ying sent generals out to oppose him.

Yong sent Zhang Fang to assist Sima Ying, but after learning Emperor Hui was in Ye, he ordered Zhang Fang to occupy Luoyang instead. Sima Tan was still holding the capital, although real power laid with his general, Shangguan Si (上官巳). Zhang Fang fought Shangguan Si and dealt him a great defeat, forcing them back into the city. One night, Tan led his troops to attack Shangguan Si and ousted him from Luoyang. He then welcomed Zhang Fang into Luoyang, but Zhang Fang soon deposed him and Yang Xianrong.

Ying had a general named, Liu Yuan, who was a noble of the Five Divisions (五部). The Five Divisions were descendants of the Southern Xiongnu in Bing province, and seeing that the princes were distracted by their civil war, they began plotting their rebellion. Liu Yuan convinced his prince to send him back to the Five Divisions so that he could rally and bring them as reinforcements against Wang Jun and Sima Teng. Instead, after arriving in Bing, the Five Divisions acclaimed Liu Yuan as their Grand Chanyu and later the King of Han. His forces swelled to over 50,000 and would continue to grow as both the Chinese peasants and non-Chinese tribes joined them in their resentment towards the Jin in light of the civil wars and famines.

Wang Jun and Sima Teng won a series of victory on their way to Ye. When their forces reached the outskirts of the city, the people of Ye were terrified and began fleeing. Lu Zhi urged Ying to use his remaining 15,000 armored troops to escort Emperor Hui of Jin back to Luoyang, but on the morning of their departure, the troops deserted. As there were no horses and porters, Ying and Emperor Hui had to flee on calf-drawn carts. Wang Jun&#x27;s forces entered Ye and sacked the city. His Xianbei troops partook in mass pillaging and abducted many women from the city.

In southwest China, Li Xiong, the son of Li Te, created the Ba-Di state of Cheng Han in 304. South of the Changjiang, despite his rebellion spilling over to multiple provinces, Jin forces were able defeat and capture Zhang Chang.

=== Captivity in Luoyang ===
Ying&#x27;s party managed to reach Luoyang, but with very little troops, Zhang Fang was able to dominate him and take possession of Emperor Hui. For a brief period, Zhang Fang was in charge of state affairs. He remained with the in Luoyang for a few more months, but his soldiers were becoming restless and were suggesting him to move the emperor to Chang&#x27;an. On 14 December 304, Zhang Fang forced Emperor Hui to stay at the ramparts he built during his war with Sima Ai. With the emperor away, Zhang Fang&#x27;s men looted the palaces in the capital. He also planned to burn them down as well, but was persuaded not to by Lu Zhi.

Three days later, Zhang Fang brought Emperor Hui, Ying and the others to Chang&#x27;an. Yong welcomed the emperor and placed him under his care. On 4 February 305, Yong issued an edict deposing Ying as Crown Prince and handed the position over to the Prince of Yuzhang, Sima Chi.

== Prince of Hejian, Sima Yong (305–306) ==

=== Western and Eastern Courts ===
Later, Sima Yong appointed Sima Yue as the Grand Tutor in hopes of resolving the conflict between their sides. Yong also granted Yue&#x27;s brothers, Sima Lue and Sima Mo military command in Luoyang and Ji province respectively. Yue declined his office, but for the time being, it appeared that the two sides had reached an agreement. Since Wang Jun had left Ye, Yue sent Mo to guard the city, while Lue remained in his position as Commander over Qing province. Seeing that many parts of the empire have been devastated by warfare and rebellion, Yong issued an edict encouraging everyone to settle for peace. In another edict, he made himself Commander of all imperial military forces.

Although Emperor Hui was now in Chang’an, the influential ministers, Xun Fan, Liu Tun, and Zhou Fu, were left behind in Luoyang to run a separate court. Thus, there were two courts governing the empire, and Chang’an was referred to as the “Western Court” (西臺) while Luoyang was referred to as the “Eastern Court” (東臺). The Eastern Court reinstated Yang Xianrong as the empress, but the following year, she was deposed by Zhang Fang.

Since 303, Huangfu Zhong had resisted Sima Yong from Jicheng, even well after Sima Ai was executed. Around this time, he sent his son Huangfu Chang (皇甫昌) to meet with Sima Yue and request reinforcements. Yue denied his request, as he had only just made peace with Yong, so Chang went to Luoyang with a forged edict from Yue to entice a campaign against Yong. After restoring Yang Xianrong as empress, he claimed that she had ordered the officials in Luoyang to attack Zhang Fang and return the emperor to the old capital. They were initially willing to participate, but after learning that the edict was fabricated, they had Chang killed. Soon, the people of Jicheng killed Huangfu Zhong before surrendering, and Yang Xianrong was deposed again.

=== Coalition of the eastern armies ===
In August 305, Sima Yue sent out a proclamation throughout the regions east of Luoyang calling for a campaign against Yong. He cited that Zhang Fang had forcibly moved Emperor Hui to Chang&#x27;an and aimed to bring him back to Luoyang. His brothers and several other prominent governors such as Wang Jun and Sima Xiao all joined him, and he also began handing out new appointments to his allies without the emperor&#x27;s assent. Among the forces in the east, only the Inspector of Yu province, Liu Qiao and the self-declared Inspector of Yan province, Sima Mao sided with Sima Yong after Yue attempted to remove them from their positions in September, with Liu Qiao accusing the prince of overstepping his authority.

In the Hebei region, where Sima Ying was still regarded as a revered figure, the people were upset by Yong&#x27;s decision to remove him from power. Ying&#x27;s general, Gongshi Fan took advantage of their resentment and rebelled. Among the people who joined him were a shepherd, Ji Sang and a former Jie slave, Shi Le. To quell his rebellion, Yong sent Sima Ying and Lu Zhi with 1,000 troops to Ye.

Liu Qiao sent his troops to block Yue from advancing west at Xiao County. On 20 November, Yong appointed Zhang Fang commander of 100,000 troops and sent him to assist Liu Qiao. Soon, Liu Qiao captured Xuchang from Sima Xiao, prompting him to flee to Ji province. Due to the early setbacks, a general of Yue, Chen Min, received permission to go east to recruit more soldiers. However, once there, Chen Min instead rebelled and took control of the Jiangnan region.

In Luoyang, another rebellion broke out which saw Yang Xianrong restored as empress, but it was quickly defeated and she was deposed once more. Seeing that she was being used as a political asset against him, Yong forged an edict from the emperor ordering the Eastern Court to execute her. However, he was opposed by Liu Tun and the others in Luoyang, and after failing to arrest Liu Tun, he changed his mind.

In Ji province, Sima Xiao received some elite Xianbei and Wuhuan cavalry forces from Wang Jun. With them, Xiao and his general, Liu Kun launched a successful counterattack on Yong and Liu Qiao&#x27;s forces in January 306, killing Shi Chao at Xingyang. Xiao&#x27;s forces then routed Sima Mao at Linqiu (廩丘, in present-day Puyang, Henan) and forced him to flee back to his fief in Dongping. Then, they won a great victory over Liu Qiao at Qiao Commandery, causing his army to collapse.

Early in 306, the administrator, Liu Bogen (劉柏根) declared himself the Duke of Jian and briefly took over Qing province. He was swiftly defeated, but one of his followers, Wang Mi, escaped to Mount Zhangguang (長廣山; in present-day Pingdu, Shandong) and became a bandit, quickly gaining followers under his wing.

Following Liu Qiao&#x27;s defeat, Yong was desperate settle for peace with Yue, but Zhang Fang advised him to keep fighting. In response, Yong had Zhang Fang executed and sent his head to Yue as part of a peace offer. Yue ignored it and used the head to convince Yong&#x27;s other generals to surrender. He then sent his generals with Wang Jun&#x27;s Xianbei troops towards Chang&#x27;an. Unable to stop them, Yong fled alone to Mount Taibai as the Xianbei soldiers sacked the city, killing around 20,000 people. On 11 June 306, Emperor Hui was sent back to Luoyang and arrived on 28 June. Yong soon returned and recaptured Chang&#x27;an, but at this point, the city was the only stronghold he had in control.

==Conclusion: Prince of Donghai, Sima Yue (306–311)==

=== Death of Emperor Hui ===
Sima Yue was the last of the so-called Eight Princes to take control over the imperial court. After receiving Emperor Hui, Yue was appointed Grand Tutor and Manager of the Affairs of the Masters of Writing. On 8 January 307, Emperor Hui died after consuming poisoned bread. It is not clear if Yue was involved in his death. Emperor Hui was succeeded by his half-brother, Sima Chi, posthumously known as Emperor Huai.

Emperor Huai was regarded as an intelligent man, and compared to Emperor Hui, he had more say and was more active in handling state affairs. Yue supported Huai being on the throne, rejecting calls to have him replaced with the child Sima Tan and going as far as to having Tan executed. Yet, Yue was also wary of the new emperor&#x27;s capabilities and was likely insecure about his own position due to the various coups and civil wars that led to the downfalls of his predecessors in recent years. In May 307, Yue left Emperor Huai at Luoyang for Xuchang, after which he assigned his own brothers, Sima Teng, Sima Mo and Sima Lue to guard strategic locations throughout the empire; Teng was transferred to Ye in Hebei, Mo was garrisoned at Chang&#x27;an in Guanzhong, and Lue was moved to Xiangyang in Jing province.

=== Death of Sima Ying ===
Previously, Sima Ying had been ordered to garrison at Ye to appease Gongshi Fan&#x27;s rebels. However, he was unable to get through Luoyang due to Yue&#x27;s forces and decided to return towards Chang&#x27;an. Following Yong&#x27;s defeat, Yue issued an edict calling for Ying&#x27;s arrest. Ying and Lu Zhi attempted to flee southward but were intercepted. They then planned to join Gongshi Fan, but Sima Xiao caught and apprehended the prince in Ye.

Around November or December 306, Sima Xiao died of natural causes. Xiao&#x27;s advisor Liu Yu was concerned that his death would encourage the people of Ye to rebel with Ying as their leader. Therefore, he forged a false edict ordering the execution of Ying and killed him during the night. Lu Zhi buried Ying and took up a staff position with Sima Yue. Gongshi Fan was also defeated and killed by Yue&#x27;s general, Gou Xi, but his subordinates, Ji Sang and Shi Le, escaped.

=== Death of Sima Yong ===
Sima Yong held out in Chang&#x27;an until around December 306 or January 307. Around this time, Yue sought for peace by issuing an edict to appoint Yong as Minister Over the Masses. Yong believed that Yue&#x27;s intentions were genuine, and so he left Chang&#x27;an for Luoyang. However, along the way, he was intercepted by a general of Sima Mo at Xin&#x27;an, who had him strangled in his carriage.

==Aftermath==

Sima Yue&#x27;s victory was short lived, as he now had to deal with the various rebellions going on throughout the empire. Chen Min was overthrown by the gentry clans of Jiangnan, who promptly surrendered the region back to Jin. Ji Sang and Shi Le sacked Ye in 307, killing Sima Teng in the process, while Wang Mi wreaked havoc on the North China Plain, going as far as occupying Xuchang and laying siege on Luoyang in 308. Although Yue eventually quelled their rebellions, both Shi Le and Wang Mi brought their remaining forces to join Liu Yuan&#x27;s state of Han. Together, they overran most of the lands north of the Yellow River. In Sichuan, Jin forces failed to extinguish Li Xiong&#x27;s state of Cheng.

Sima Yue returned to Luoyang in 309, during which he took measures to tighten his grip on the court. He sent 3,000 armoured soldiers to arrest and execute Emperor Huai of Jin&#x27;s favored courtiers. Then, he dismissed the palace guards, who had participated in many previous coups, and replaced them with soldiers from his own fief. Around this time, Luoyang was hit by a deadly famine and attacked twice by Han forces. In response, Yue decided to march out with the 40,000-strong imperial army to camp at Xiang county (項縣; in present-day Shenqiu County, Henan) to actively campaign against Han, leaving the capital with little defense and despite Emperor Huai&#x27;s objections. The emperor was also left behind in Luoyang under the watch of Yue&#x27;s hand-picked confidants.

This decision was the breaking point in their relationship, as Huai began plotting to depose Yue. He made contact with Yue&#x27;s second-in-command, Gou Xi, who also had a falling out with the prince, but their plans were eventually discovered. Yue wanted to attack Gou Xi, but was so overwhelmed by stress that he grew ill and soon died on 23 April 311. The imperial army, now at 100,000-strong, were unsure on how to proceed. They hastily chose Yue&#x27;s minister, Wang Yan as a temporary leader, and decided that they should hold the prince&#x27;s funeral first at his fief. However, the funeral procession was caught by Shi Le and defeated at the Battle of Ningping. The imperial army was annihilated, and the bodies of officials and soldiers were piled atop one another in a mound as not a single one had been able to escape. With the destruction of the main Jin force in the north, Han forces descended upon the poorly-defended and famine-stricken Luoyang, sacking the city and capturing Emperor Huai on 13 July 311; this came to be known as the Disaster of Yongjia. Gou Xi was also defeated and captured by Shi Le at Mengcheng County in October. 

The Western Jin dynasty would survive for another five years, as an imperial restoration headed by Emperor Min of Jin (Emperor Huai&#x27;s nephew) was founded in Chang&#x27;an soon after Huai&#x27;s capture. However, that too fell by the end of 316, and the Sima clan eventually re-established itself as the Eastern Jin dynasty at Jiankang in southern China. Within four years of his victory in the War of the Eight Princes, Sima Yue had been hounded to death by an assortment of rebellions and court politics. Five years after his death, both the capitals of Chang&#x27;an and Luoyang had been lost and most of northern China fell under the rule of an assortment of short-lived states known as the Sixteen Kingdoms.
