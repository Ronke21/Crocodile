<text>Kerikeri () is a town in the Bay of Islands, New Zealand. The town is located on the eponymous Kerikeri inlet. It is sometimes called the Cradle of the Nation, as it was the site of the first permanent mission station in the country, and it has some of the oldest buildings in the country.

A rapidly expanding centre of subtropical and allied horticulture, Kerikeri is part of the Far North District of the North Island and lies at the western extremity of the Kerikeri Inlet, a northwestern arm of the Bay of Islands, where fresh water of the Kerikeri River enters the Pacific Ocean.
==Etymology==
The missionaries who established the settlement of Kerikeri initially called it Gloucester Town, this name however did not see continued use. The etymology of &quot;Kerikeri&quot; is unknown with several origins proposed, one possible origin is from the Māori language verb meaning &#x27;to dig&#x27;.

==History==

In 1770 Ngapuhi conquered the area from another tribe.

In 1814, Samuel Marsden acquired land at Kerikeri from Hongi Hika for the use of the Church Missionary Society for a payment of forty-eight axes. In 1819, Samuel Marsden—the second Church Missionary Society mission in New Zealand—was established at the Kerikeri basin. The protector of the Kerikeri mission station was the chief, Ruatara, a nephew of Hongi Hika. Hongi Hika traded with the missionaries, typically trading kumara for arms and ammunition. Hika used these weapons to raid rival tribes. By 1827 Hika and his followers had left Kerikeri, leaving the missionaries with a much smaller native population to proselytise and educate.

The mission closed in 1848 due to a declining Mãori population and increasing obsolesce of the settlement in favour of Russell.

Following the departure of the Mãori populace many Europeans started obtaining land in the area in the 1840s. By the 1890s most of the land was part of a sheep and cattle station owned by Thomas Coldham Williams, a son of one the original missionaries — Henry Williams. In 1927, George Alderton purchased the station. Alderton owned the North Auckland Land Development Corporation and subdivided the station into both orchards and forestry land.Today, Kerikeri is one of the largest horticultural areas in Northland.

Kerikeri was the first place in New Zealand where grape vines were planted. Samuel Marsden planted 100 vines on 25 September 1819 and noted in his journal that New Zealand promised to be very favourable to the vine. In the same year Charlotte Kemp planted the first citrus. New Zealand&#x27;s first commercial plantings of passionfruit were established in 1927. The plough was first used in New Zealand at Kerikeri, by Rev. J. G. Butler, on 3 May 1820.

Since the 1990s Kerikeri has seen growth spurred by both domestic and international migration.

==Historic sites==
Kerikeri is home to many historic sites, most are located in the Kerikeri basin, which is registered as a historic area.
=== Kororipo pā ===
Kororipo pā is the remains of a Māori fortified settlement in the Kerikeri basin. Historically it is known Ngāi Tawake defended the pā in the 1770s; the pa was an important strategical asset as it provided access to the sea. The pā was also the launch place Hongi Hika used in the 1820s for raids on other tribes.

=== Mission House ===
Originally known as the &quot;Mission House&quot;, and then for more than 100 years &quot;Kemp House&quot;, but now known as &quot;Kerikeri Mission House&quot;, it is the oldest extant building in New Zealand.

The two-storey Georgian structure was constructed from 1821 to 1822 by the Church Missionary Society. It was built to house the Reverend John Gare Butler. James Kemp and his family occupied the building in 1832 and the Kemp family continued to live in the house long after the closure of the Kerikeri mission in 1848. The Kemp family continued to live in the building until Ernest Kemp donated the property to the New Zealand Historic Places Trust in 1974.

===St. James Church===

St James Church is a Gothic Revival Anglican church situated on a hillock overlooking the Kerikeri basin. The church was built in 1878 to replace an earlier chapel constructed in 1829. St James was opened by the Reverend Taua and Archdeacon of Waimate Edward Clarke. In the 1960s St James Church was expanded due to growth in the population of Kerikeri.
===Stone Store===
The Stone Store, a former storehouse, is the oldest stone building in New Zealand, construction having begun on 19 April 1832. The keystone above the door bearing the date 1833 is thought to have been carved by the stonemason William Parrott who cut the Sydney sandstone in situ, but construction of the building was not actually completed until mid-1836.

Stone was used because the missionaries needed a vermin-free, fireproof area for their supplies and provisions, and for improved security from inquisitive Māori. There was a plan to build a mill where the bridge exists now, and to protect the flour produced from locally grown wheat in the store. But the mill was never built, and the millstones brought out from England went inland to Waimate North instead.

Curiously enough, when work started on the building, Māori were already moving out of the district, and when it was finally completed there were very few Māori remaining at Kerikeri. Furthermore, there were rumblings within the missionary community that Kerikeri was becoming the backwater of missionary activity, eliminating the need to store goods and provisions there. It was considered a folly at the time, but one that blesses Kerikeri today.

Over the years, the Stone Store suffered the cumulative effects of adjacent traffic movements and the ravages of normal wear and tear. Costly remedial work was required and in the 21st century a bypass was constructed and opened on 23 June 2008, to divert traffic and protect the building for posterity. The old stone store bridge was completely removed in the second half of 2008. The reasons for removal of the original bridge are controversial, and there was a groundswell of protest from a number of local residents. The bridge was removed regardless and the debate over whether this was the correct course of action has yet to be resolved in the minds of many residents. The building has been restored to its original state, but does not include the tower on the roof containing the clock removed from the chapel further up the hill, which was removed as a safety measure a long time ago.

=== Te Ahurea ===
&quot;Rewa&#x27;s Village&quot; was built in the 1970s to fundraise for legal services to stop a housing subdivision in the Kerikeri basin area. The land was later bought and turned into a public reserve. Ngāti Rēhia took over the site in 2020 and renamed it &quot;Te Ahurea&quot; (lit. &#x27;culture&#x27;) following $1.25 million being granted from the Provincial Growth Fund. Rewa&#x27;s Village was a recreation of a fishing village but today &quot;Te Ahurea&quot; contains recreated &quot;whare&quot;, gardens for growing traditional medicine, waka tours, and cultural workshops. The attraction is based on the 1790–1835 period of Maori culture.

== Arts and culture ==
The KOAST (Kerikeri Open Art Studios Trail), which highlights Kerikeri local artists and art galleries, is an annual arts trail held over Labour Weekend since 2014. In 2019 the trail featured 40 artists at 21 studios. The Turner Centre, a performing arts and events venue, opened in 2005. It presents nationally touring events as well as locally produced performances.

It is served by Air New Zealand flights from Auckland and has a steadily increasing patronage, handling a record 110,000 passengers in financial 2017/2018. The existing terminal was not fit for purpose and did not meet Air New Zealand&#x27;s requirements, while growth in passenger numbers also put pressure on the existing facilities. A new $4.75 million terminal opened on 16 June 2019 with improved arrivals/departures, baggage screening and luggage collection facilities.

<text>St. Johnsbury (known locally as &quot;St. J&quot;) is the shire town (county seat) of Caledonia County, Vermont, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 7,364. St. Johnsbury is situated on the Passumpsic River and is located approximately six miles northwest of the Connecticut River and south of the Canada–U.S. border.

St. Johnsbury is the largest town by population in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont and has long served as a commercial center for the region. The more densely settled southern one-third of the town is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as the St. Johnsbury census-designated place, where over 81% of the population resides.

==History==

The town was originally granted in 1760 as part of the New Hampshire Grants and named Bessborough. It was regranted by Vermont in 1786 as Dunmore, and settled the same year. An early settler was Jonathan Arnold, a member of the Continental Congress and author of Rhode Island&#x27;s act of secession from the Kingdom of Great Britain in May 1776. Arnold left Rhode Island in 1787 and, with six other families, built homes at what is now the town center.
By 1790, the village had grown to 143 inhabitants, and the first town meeting took place in Arnold&#x27;s home that year, where the name St. Johnsbury was adopted. According to local lore, Vermont founder Ethan Allen himself proposed naming the town St. John in honor of his friend Jean de Crèvecœur, a French-born author and agriculturist and a friend of Benjamin Franklin. (He was known in the United States as J. Hector St. John.) According to this account, de Crèvecœur suggested instead the unusual St. Johnsbury to differentiate it from Saint John, New Brunswick.

In the mid-19th century, St. Johnsbury became a minor manufacturing center, with the main products being scales—the platform scale was invented there by Thaddeus Fairbanks in 1830—and maple syrup and related products. With the arrival of the railroad line from Boston to Montreal in the 1850s, St. Johnsbury grew quickly and was named the shire town (county seat) in 1856, replacing Danville. The oldest occupied residence in St. Johnsbury was built in 1798 and located on the corner of Summer and Central streets, attached to the J. J. Palmer house.

The former St. Johnsbury Fairground was located where Interstates 91 and 93 converge, south of the town. The Third Vermont Regiment drilled there prior to joining the Union Army during the Civil War. The first air flight in Vermont occurred at the fair on April 19, 1910.

In the 1940s the town contained three major industrial companies, each then the largest of its type in the world. One was Fairbanks Scales, another was a maple sugar candy company, while a third made candlepins for bowling. The rest of the economy was mostly rural.

==Geography==
St. Johnsbury is located at , elevation 212.4 m (697 ft). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.96%, is water. Situated at the confluence of the Passumpsic, Moose and Sleeper&#x27;s rivers, the town lies at the heart of the Passumpsic River basin, one of the largest of the upper Connecticut River watershed. St. Johnsbury is on the site of the northernmost boundary of Lake Hitchcock, the post-glacial predecessor to the Connecticut River.

The town includes the unincorporated villages of St. Johnsbury, East St. Johnsbury, Goss Hollow, and St. Johnsbury Center. The town center, which is defined as a census-designated place (CDP), encompasses the villages of St. Johnsbury and St. Johnsbury Center and covers an area of , about 36% of the area of the town.

The highest point in St. Johnsbury is an unnamed hill in the northwestern part of town east of Libby Road. The twin summits of the hill each rise above above sea level.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $26,702, and the median income for a family was $39,890. Males had a median income of $31,454 versus $21,283 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $16,561. About 12.8% of families and 15.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 24.3% of those under age 18 and 9.1% of those age 65 or over.

==Education==
* St. Johnsbury Academy is a private high school founded by the Fairbanks family, including Erastus Fairbanks, in 1842. The town of St. Johnsbury does not operate a public school for grades 9–12, but Vermont law requires towns not operating schools to pay tuition to other approved schools for students in the grades not provided, an amount up to the Average Announced Tuition for union schools. A majority of St. Johnsbury secondary school students choose to be educated at St. Johnsbury Academy at the town&#x27;s expense. 
* St. Johnsbury Trade School opened in September 1918, offering the only four year vocational education in the area. The school&#x27;s founders, Fairbanks, Morse and Company, wanted to provide young people with the opportunity to learn a trade while providing them a base for earning more money and high school courses. After serving the community for over 50 years, the Trade School was closed, and the building then became the junior high. In 1981, it became the St. Johnsbury Middle School. After consolidating the local school system, the old trade school became the site of the St. Johnsbury School serving students from K–8th grade.
* St. Johnsbury School now serves pre-kindergarten through 8th grade.
* Good Shepherd School is operated by St. John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church and serves pre-school through 8th grade.

His donated collections remain northern New England’s most extensive natural history display, and the National Register-listed building is a splendid example of the Richardsonian Romanesque style. The Fairbanks Museum is well known in Vermont for producing the &quot;Eye on the Sky&quot; weather forecast which is broadcast on Vermont Public Radio and Magic 97.7 FM.

There has been an annual First Night community celebration of the arts on New Year&#x27;s Eve since 1993.

<doc id="350611" wikidata="Q817206" url="?curid=350611" title="Cambodian Civil War">
<text>The Cambodian Civil War (, UNGEGN: ) was a civil war in Cambodia fought between the Communist Party of Kampuchea (known as the Khmer Rouge, supported by North Vietnam and China) against the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia and, after October 1970, the Khmer Republic, which had succeeded the kingdom after a coup (both supported by the United States and South Vietnam). The conflict was part of the Second Indochina War (1955–1975). 

The conflict was linked to the Vietnam War. The North Vietnamese People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) was involved to protect its bases in eastern Cambodia, which were crucial to its military effort in South Vietnam. This presence was initially tolerated by Prince Sihanouk, the Cambodian head of state, but domestic resistance combined with China and North Vietnam aiding the anti-government Khmer Rouge caused him to request help from the Soviet Union to stop this.

In March 1970, Sihanouk was deposed by the Cambodian National Assembly, following wide scale protests in the capital against the PAVN presence in the country. He was replaced by a pro-American government which demanded that the PAVN leave Cambodia. They refused and, at the request of the Khmer Rouge, invaded Cambodia, capturing most of the northeastern third of the country from the Khmer National Armed Forces (FANK) between March and June 1970. They handed over some of the territory to the Khmer Rouge and increased material assistance to the group, thus empowering what was at the time a small guerrilla movement. In response, FANK was expanded to fight the PAVN and growing Khmer Rouge. U.S. involvement was motivated by the desire to buy time for its withdrawal from Southeast Asia, to protect South Vietnam, and to prevent the spread of communism to Cambodia. The U.S. assisted the Khmer government with massive U.S. aerial bombing campaigns and direct material and financial aid, while the PAVN continued to occupy Cambodian territory and occasionally engage the FANK in combat.

On 17 April 1975, after five years of fighting, the Khmer Republic was ultimately defeated, with the victorious Khmer Rouge proclaiming the establishment of Democratic Kampuchea. The war caused a refugee crisis in Cambodia with two million people—more than 25 percent of the population—displaced from rural areas into the cities, with the capital Phnom Penh&#x27;s population growing from 600,000 in 1970 to nearly 2 million by 1975. Children were frequently persuaded or forced to commit atrocities during the war. The Cambodian government estimated that more than 20 percent of the property in the country had been destroyed during the war. In total, an estimated 275,000–310,000 people were killed as a result of the war, including 30,000 to 150,000 killed in U.S. bombing campaigns. Once in power, the Khmer Rouge carried out the Cambodian genocide, one of the deadliest in history.

== Setting the stage (1965–1970) ==
=== Background ===

During the early-to-mid-1960s, Prince Norodom Sihanouk&#x27;s policies had protected his nation from the turmoil that engulfed Laos and South Vietnam. Neither the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) nor North Vietnam disputed Sihanouk&#x27;s claim to represent &quot;progressive&quot; political policies and the leadership of the prince&#x27;s domestic leftist opposition, the &quot;Pracheachon&quot; Party, had been integrated into the government. On 3 May 1965, Sihanouk broke diplomatic relations with the U.S., ended the flow of American aid, and turned to the PRC and the Soviet Union for economic and military assistance.

By the late 1960s, Sihanouk&#x27;s delicate domestic and foreign policy balancing act was beginning to go awry. In 1966, an agreement was struck between the prince and the Chinese, allowing the presence of large-scale PAVN and Viet Cong troop deployments and logistical bases in the eastern border regions. He had also agreed to allow the use of the port of Sihanoukville by communist-flagged vessels delivering supplies and material to support the PAVN/Viet Cong military effort in South Vietnam. These concessions made questionable Cambodia&#x27;s neutrality, which had been guaranteed by the Geneva Conference of 1954.
Sihanouk was convinced that the PRC, not the U.S., would eventually control the Indochinese Peninsula and that &quot;our interests are best served by dealing with the camp that one day will dominate the whole of Asia – and coming to terms before its victory – in order to obtain the best terms possible.&quot;

During the same year, however, he allowed his pro-American minister of defense, General Lon Nol, to crack down on leftist activities, crushing the &quot;Pracheachon&quot; by accusing its members of subversion and subservience to Hanoi. Simultaneously, Sihanouk lost the support of Cambodia&#x27;s conservatives as a result of his failure to come to grips with the deteriorating economic situation (exacerbated by the loss of rice exports, most of which went to the PAVN/Viet Cong) and with the growing communist military presence.

On 11 September 1966, Cambodia held its first open election. Through manipulation and harassment the conservatives won 75 percent of the seats in the National Assembly to Sihanouk&#x27;s surprise. Lon Nol was chosen by the right as prime minister and, as his deputy, they named Prince Sirik Matak; an ultraconservative member of the Sisowath branch of the royal clan and long-time enemy of Sihanouk. In addition to these developments and the clash of interests among Phnom Penh&#x27;s politicized elite, social tensions created a favorable environment for the growth of a domestic communist insurgency in the rural areas.

=== Revolt in Battambang ===
The prince then found himself in a political dilemma. To maintain the balance against the rising tide of the conservatives, he named the leaders of the very group he had been oppressing as members of a &quot;counter-government&quot; that was meant to monitor and criticize Lon Nol&#x27;s administration. One of Lon Nol&#x27;s first priorities was to fix the ailing economy by halting the illegal sale of rice to the communists. Soldiers were dispatched to the rice-growing areas to forcibly collect the harvests at gunpoint, and they paid only the low government price. There was widespread unrest, especially in rice-rich Battambang Province, an area long-noted for the presence of large landowners, great disparity in wealth, and where the communists still had some influence.
On 11 March 1967, while Sihanouk was out of the country in France, a rebellion broke out in the area around Samlaut in Battambang, when enraged villagers attacked a tax collection brigade. With the probable encouragement of local communist cadres, the insurrection quickly spread throughout the whole region. Lon Nol, acting in the prince&#x27;s absence (but with his approval), responded by declaring martial law. Hundreds of peasants were killed and whole villages were laid waste during the repression. After returning home in March, Sihanouk abandoned his centrist position and personally ordered the arrest of Khieu Samphan, Hou Yuon, and Hu Nim, the leaders of the &quot;counter government&quot;, all of whom escaped into the northeast.

Simultaneously, Sihanouk ordered the arrest of Chinese middlemen involved in the illegal rice trade, thereby raising government revenues and placating the conservatives. Lon Nol was forced to resign, and, in a typical move, the prince named new leftists to the government to balance the conservatives. The immediate crisis had passed, but it engendered two consequences. First, it drove thousands of new recruits into the arms of the hard-line &quot;maquis&quot; of the Cambodian Communist Party (which Sihanouk labelled the &quot;Khmers rouges&quot; (&quot;Red Khmers&quot;)). Second, for the peasantry, the name of Lon Nol became associated with ruthless repression throughout Cambodia.

=== Communists regroup ===
While the 1967 insurgency had been unplanned, the Khmer Rouge tried, without much success, to organize a more serious revolt during the following year. The prince&#x27;s decimation of the Prachea Chon and the urban communists had, however, cleared the field of competition for Saloth Sar (also known as Pol Pot), Ieng Sary, and Son Sen—the Maoist leadership of the &quot;maquisards&quot;. They led their followers into the highlands of the northeast and into the lands of the Khmer Loeu, a tribal people who were hostile to both the lowland Khmers and the central government. For the Khmer Rouge, who still lacked assistance from the North Vietnamese, it was a period of regroupment, organization, and training. Hanoi basically ignored its Chinese-sponsored allies, and the indifference of their &quot;fraternal comrades&quot; to their insurgency between 1967 and 1969 would make an indelible impression on the Khmer Rouge leadership.

On 17 January 1968, the Khmer Rouge launched their first offensive. It was aimed more at gathering weapons and spreading propaganda than in seizing territory since, at that time, the adherents of the insurgency numbered no more than 4,000–5,000. During the same month, the communists established the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea as the military wing of the party. As early as the end of the Battambang revolt, Sihanouk had begun to reevaluate his relationship with the communists. His earlier agreement with the Chinese had availed him nothing. They had not only failed to restrain the North Vietnamese, but they had actually involved themselves (through the Khmer Rouge) in active subversion within his country.

At the suggestion of Lon Nol (who had returned to the cabinet as defense minister in November 1968) and other conservative politicians, on 11 May 1969, the prince welcomed the restoration of normal diplomatic relations with the U.S. and created a new Government of National Salvation with Lon Nol as his prime minister. He did so &quot;in order to play a new card, since the Asian communists are already attacking us before the end of the Vietnam War.&quot; Besides, PAVN and the Viet Cong would make very convenient scapegoats for Cambodia&#x27;s ills, much more so than the minuscule Khmer Rouge, and ridding Cambodia of their presence would solve many problems simultaneously.

=== Operation Menu and Operation Freedom Deal ===

Although the U.S. had been aware of the PAVN/Viet Cong sanctuaries in Cambodia since 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson had chosen not to attack them due to possible international repercussions and his belief that Sihanouk could be convinced to alter his policies. Johnson did, however, authorize the reconnaissance teams of the highly classified Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (SOG) to enter Cambodia and gather intelligence on the Base Areas in 1967. The election of Richard Nixon in 1968 and the introduction of his policies of gradual U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam and the Vietnamization of the conflict there, changed everything.

On 18 March 1969, on secret orders from Nixon and Henry Kissinger, the U.S. Air Force carried out the bombing of Base Area 353 (in the Fishhook region opposite South Vietnam&#x27;s Tây Ninh Province) by 59 B-52 Stratofortress bombers. This strike was the first in a series of attacks on the sanctuaries that lasted until May 1970. During Operation Menu, the Air Force conducted 3,875 sorties and dropped more than 108,000 tons of ordnance on the eastern border areas. Only five high-ranking congressional officials were informed of the bombing.

After the event, it was claimed by Nixon and Kissinger that Sihanouk had given his tacit approval for the raids. Sihanouk, however, told U.S. diplomat Chester Bowles on 10 January 1968, that he would not oppose American &quot;hot pursuit&quot; of retreating North Vietnamese troops &quot;in remote areas [of Cambodia],&quot; provided that Cambodians were unharmed. Kenton Clymer notes that this statement &quot;cannot reasonably be construed to mean that Sihanouk approved of the intensive, ongoing B-52 bombing raids ... In any event, no one asked him. ... Sihanouk was never asked to approve the B-52 bombings, and he never gave his approval.&quot; During the course of the Menu bombings, Sihanouk&#x27;s government formally protested &quot;American violation[s] of Cambodian territory and airspace&quot; at the United Nations on over 100 occasions, although it &quot;specifically protested the use of B-52s&quot; only once, following an attack on Bu Chric in November 1969.

Operation Freedom Deal followed Operation Menu. Under Freedom Deal, from 19 May 1970 to 15 August 1973, U.S. bombing of Cambodia extended over the entire eastern one-half of the country and was especially intense in the heavily populated southeastern one-quarter of the country, including a wide ring surrounding the largest city of Phnom Penh. In large areas, according to maps of U.S. bombing sites, it appears that nearly every square mile of land was hit by bombs.

The effectiveness of the U.S. bombing on the Khmer Rouge and the death toll of Cambodian civilians is disputed. With limited data, the range of Cambodian deaths caused by U.S. bombing may be between 30,000 and 150,000 Cambodian civilians and Khmer Rouge fighters. Another impact of the U.S. bombing and the Cambodian civil war was to destroy the homes and livelihood of many people. This was a heavy contributor to the refugee crisis in Cambodia.

It has been argued that the U.S. intervention in Cambodia contributed to the eventual seizure of power by the Khmer Rouge, that grew from 4,000 in number in 1970 to 70,000 in 1975. This view has been disputed, with documents uncovered from the Soviet archives revealing that the North Vietnamese offensive in Cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge following negotiations with Nuon Chea. It has also been argued that U.S. bombing was decisive in delaying a Khmer Rouge victory. &quot;Victory in Vietnam&quot;, the official war history of the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam, candidly states that the communist insurgency in Cambodia had already increased from &quot;ten guerrilla teams&quot; to several tens of thousands of fighters only two months after the North Vietnamese invasion in April 1970, as a direct result of the PAVN seizing 40% of the country, handing it over to the communist insurgents, and then actively supplying and training the insurgents.

==Overthrow of Sihanouk (1970)==

===Overthrow===

While Sihanouk was out of the country on a trip to France, anti-Vietnamese rioting (which was semi-sponsored by the government) took place in Phnom Penh, during which the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong embassies were sacked. In the prince&#x27;s absence, Lon Nol did nothing to halt these activities. On 12 March, the prime minister closed the port of Sihanoukville to the North Vietnamese and issued an impossible ultimatum to them. All PAVN/Viet Cong forces were to withdraw from Cambodian soil within 72 hours (on 15 March) or face military action.

Sihanouk, hearing of the turmoil, headed for Moscow and Beijing in order to demand that the patrons of PAVN and the Viet Cong exert more control over their clients. On 18 March 1970, Lon Nol requested that the National Assembly vote on the future of the prince&#x27;s leadership of the nation. Sihanouk was ousted from power by a vote of 86–3. Cheng Heng became president of the National Assembly, while Prime Minister Lon Nol was granted emergency powers. Sirik Matak retained his post as deputy prime minister. The new government emphasized that the transfer of power had been totally legal and constitutional and it received the recognition of most foreign governments. There have been, and continue to be, accusations that the U.S. government played some role in the overthrow of Sihanouk, but conclusive evidence has never been found to support them.

The majority of middle-class and educated Khmers had grown weary of the prince and welcomed the change of government. They were joined by the military, for whom the prospect of the return of American military and financial aid was a cause for celebration. Within days of his deposition, Sihanouk, now in Beijing, broadcast an appeal to the people to resist the usurpers. Demonstrations and riots occurred (mainly in areas contiguous to PAVN/Viet Cong controlled areas), but no nationwide groundswell threatened the government. In one incident at Kampong Cham on 29 March, however, an enraged crowd killed Lon Nol&#x27;s brother, Lon Nil, and was alleged to have torn out his liver, then cooked and ate it. An estimated 40,000 peasants then began to march on the capital to demand Sihanouk&#x27;s reinstatement. They were dispersed, with many casualties, by contingents of the armed forces.

===Massacre of the Vietnamese===
Most of the population, both urban and rural, took out their anger and frustrations on the nation&#x27;s Vietnamese population. Lon Nol&#x27;s call for 10,000 volunteers to boost the manpower of Cambodia&#x27;s poorly equipped, 30,000-man army, managed to swamp the military with over 70,000 recruits. Rumours abounded concerning a possible PAVN offensive aimed at Phnom Penh itself. Paranoia flourished and this set off a violent reaction against the nation&#x27;s 400,000 ethnic Vietnamese.

Lon Nol hoped to use the domestic Vietnamese population as hostages against PAVN/Viet Cong activities, and ordered the military to set about rounding them up into detention camps. In many instances, however, this did not occur. In towns and villages all over Cambodia, soldiers and civilians began seeking out their Vietnamese neighbors in order to murder them instead. On 15 April, the bodies of 800 Vietnamese floated down the Mekong River and into South Vietnam.

The South Vietnamese, North Vietnamese, and the Viet Cong all harshly denounced these actions. Significantly, no Cambodians—including the Buddhist community—condemned the killings. In his apology to the Saigon government, Lon Nol stated that &quot;it was difficult to distinguish between Vietnamese citizens who were Viet Cong and those who were not. So it is quite normal that the reaction of Cambodian troops, who feel themselves betrayed, is difficult to control.&quot;

===FUNK and GRUNK===
From Beijing, Sihanouk proclaimed that the government in Phnom Penh was dissolved and his intention to create the &quot;Front uni national du Kampuchéa&quot; (National United Front of Kampuchea) or FUNK. Sihanouk later said &quot;I had chosen not to be with either the Americans or the communists, because I considered that there were two dangers, American imperialism and Asian communism. It was Lon Nol who obliged me to choose between them.&quot;

The North Vietnamese reacted to the political changes in Cambodia by sending Premier Phạm Văn Đồng to meet Sihanouk in China and recruit him into an alliance with the Khmer Rouge. Pol Pot was also contacted by the Vietnamese who now offered him whatever resources he wanted for his insurgency against the Cambodian government. Pol Pot and Sihanouk were actually in Beijing at the same time, but the Vietnamese and Chinese leaders never informed Sihanouk of the presence of Pol Pot or allowed the two men to meet.

Shortly after, Sihanouk issued an appeal by radio to the people of Cambodia to rise up against the government and support the Khmer Rouge. In doing so, Sihanouk lent his name and popularity in the rural areas of Cambodia to a movement over which he had little control. In May 1970, Pol Pot finally returned to Cambodia and the pace of the insurgency greatly increased. After Sihanouk showed his support for the Khmer Rouge by visiting them in the field, their ranks swelled from 6,000 to 50,000 fighters.

The prince then allied himself with the Khmer Rouge, the North Vietnamese, the Laotian Pathet Lao and the Viet Cong, throwing his personal prestige behind the communists. On 5 May, the actual establishment of FUNK and of the &quot;Gouvernement royal d&#x27;union nationale du Kampuchéa&quot; or GRUNK (Royal Government of National Union of Kampuchea), was proclaimed. Sihanouk assumed the post of head of state, appointing Penn Nouth, one of his most loyal supporters, as prime minister.

Khieu Samphan was designated deputy prime minister, minister of defense, and commander in chief of the GRUNK armed forces (though actual military operations were directed by Pol Pot). Hu Nim became minister of information, and Hou Yuon assumed multiple responsibilities as minister of the interior, communal reforms, and cooperatives. GRUNK claimed that it was not a government-in-exile since Khieu Samphan and the insurgents remained inside Cambodia. Sihanouk and his loyalists remained in China, although the prince did make a visit to the &quot;liberated areas&quot; of Cambodia, including Angkor Wat, in March 1973. These visits were used mainly for propaganda purposes and had no real influence on political affairs.

For Sihanouk, this proved to be a marriage of convenience that was spurred on by his thirst for revenge against those who had betrayed him. For the Khmer Rouge, it was a means to greatly expand the appeal of their movement. Peasants, motivated by loyalty to the monarchy, gradually rallied to the GRUNK cause. The personal appeal of Sihanouk and widespread U.S. aerial bombardment helped recruitment. This task was made even easier for the communists after 9 October 1970, when Lon Nol abolished the loosely federalist monarchy and proclaimed the establishment of a centralized Khmer Republic.

The GRUNK was soon caught between the competing Communist powers: North Vietnam, China and the Soviet Union. During the visits that Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and Sihanouk paid to North Korea in April and June 1970, respectively, they called for the establishment of a &quot;united front of the five revolutionary Asian countries&quot; (China, North Korea, North Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, the last being represented by the GRUNK). While the North Korean leaders enthusiastically welcomed the plan, it soon foundered on Hanoi&#x27;s opposition. Having realized that such a front would exclude the Soviet Union and implicitly challenge the hegemonic role that the DRV had arrogated to itself in Indochina, the North Vietnamese leaders declared that all communist states should join forces against &quot;American imperialism.&quot;

Indeed, the issue of Vietnamese versus Chinese hegemony over Indochina greatly influenced the attitude Hanoi adopted towards Moscow in the early and mid-1970s. During the Cambodian civil war, the Soviet leaders, ready to acquiesce in Hanoi&#x27;s dominance over Laos and Cambodia, actually insisted on sending their aid shipments to the Khmer Rouge through the DRV, whereas China firmly rebuffed Hanoi&#x27;s proposal that Chinese aid to Cambodia be sent via North Vietnam. Facing Chinese competition and Soviet acquiescence, the North Vietnamese leaders found the Soviet option more advantageous to their interests, a calculation that played a major role in the gradual pro-Soviet shift in Hanoi&#x27;s foreign policies.

==Widening war (1970–1971)==

===North Vietnamese offensive in Cambodia===
In the wake of the coup, Lon Nol did not immediately launch Cambodia into war. He appealed to the international community and to the United Nations in an attempt to gain support for the new government and condemned violations of Cambodia&#x27;s neutrality &quot;by foreign forces, whatever camp they come from.&quot; His hope for continued neutralism availed him no more than it had Sihanouk.

On 29 March 1970, the North Vietnamese had taken matters into their own hands and launched an offensive against the now renamed &quot;Forces Armées Nationales Khmères&quot; or FANK (Khmer National Armed Forces) with documents uncovered from the Soviet archives revealing that the offensive was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge following negotiations with Nuon Chea. The North Vietnamese overran most of northeastern Cambodia by June 1970.

The North Vietnamese invasion completely changed the course of the civil war. Cambodia&#x27;s army was mauled, lands containing nearly half of the Cambodian population were conquered and handed over to the Khmer Rouge and North Vietnam now took an active role in supplying and training the Khmer Rouge. All of this resulted in the Cambodian government being greatly weakened and the insurgents multiplying several fold in size over the course of a few weeks. As noted in the official Vietnamese war history, &quot;our troops helped our Cambodian friends to completely liberate five provinces with a total population of three million people... our troops also helped our Cambodian friends train cadre and expand their armed forces. In just two months the armed forces of our Cambodian allies grew from ten guerrilla teams to nine battalions and 80 companies of full-time troops with a total strength of 20,000 soldiers, plus hundreds of guerrilla squads and platoons in the villages.&quot;

On 29 April 1970, South Vietnamese and U.S. units unleashed a limited, multi-pronged Cambodian Campaign that Washington hoped would solve three problems: First, it would provide a shield for the American withdrawal from Vietnam (by destroying the PAVN logistical system and killing enemy troops) in Cambodia; second, it would provide a test for the policy of Vietnamization; third, it would serve as a signal to Hanoi that Nixon meant business. Despite Nixon&#x27;s appreciation of Lon Nol&#x27;s position, the Cambodian leader was not even informed in advance of the decision to send troops into his country. He learned about it only after it had begun from the head of the U.S. mission, who had himself learned about it from a radio broadcast.

Extensive logistical installations and large amounts of supplies were found and destroyed, but as reporting from the American command in Saigon disclosed, still larger amounts of military material had already been moved further from the border to shelter it from the incursion into Cambodia by the U.S. and South Vietnam.

One month prior, the North Vietnamese had launched an offensive (Campaign &quot;X&quot;) of its own against FANK forces at the request of the Khmer Rouge and in order to protect and expand their Base Areas and logistical system. By June, three months after the removal of Sihanouk, they had swept government forces from the entire northeastern third of the country. After defeating those forces, the North Vietnamese turned the newly won territories over to the local insurgents. The Khmer Rouge also established &quot;liberated&quot; areas in the south and the southwestern parts of the country, where they operated independently of the North Vietnamese.

===Opposing sides===
As combat operations quickly revealed, the two sides were badly mismatched. FANK, whose ranks had been increased by thousands of young urban Cambodians who had flocked to join it in the months following the removal of Sihanouk, had expanded well beyond its capacity to absorb the new men. Later, given the press of tactical operations and the need to replace combat casualties, there was insufficient time to impart needed skills to individuals or to units, and lack of training remained the bane of FANK&#x27;s existence until its collapse.
During the period 1974–1975, FANK forces officially grew from 100,000 to approximately 250,000 men, but probably only numbered around 180,000 due to payroll padding by their officers and desertions.

U.S. military aid (ammunition, supplies, and equipment) was funneled to FANK through the Military Equipment Delivery Team, Cambodia (MEDTC). A total of 113 officers and men, the team arrived in Phnom Penh in 1971, under the overall command of CINCPAC Admiral John S. McCain Jr. The attitude of the Nixon administration could be summed up by the advice given by Henry Kissinger to the first head of the liaison team, Colonel Jonathan Ladd: &quot;Don&#x27;t think of victory; just keep it alive.&quot; Nevertheless, McCain constantly petitioned the Pentagon for more arms, equipment, and staff for what he proprietarily viewed as &quot;my war&quot;.

There were other problems as well. The officer corps of FANK was generally corrupt and greedy. The inclusion of &quot;ghost&quot; soldiers allowed massive payroll padding; ration allowances were often kept by the officers, while their men starved; and the sale of arms and ammunition on the black market (or to the enemy) was commonplace. Worse, tactical ineptitude among FANK officers was quite common too. Lon Nol frequently bypassed the general staff and directed operations down to battalion-level while also forbidding any real coordination between the army, navy and air force.

The common soldiers fought well at first, but were saddled with low pay (with which they had to purchase their own food and medical care), ammunition shortages, and insufficient/poor equipment. Due to the pay system, there were no allotments for their families, who were, therefore, frequently forced to follow their husbands/sons into the battle zones. These problems only increased over time and continued to damage morale.

At the beginning of 1974, the Cambodian army inventory included 241,630 rifles, 7,079 machine guns, 2,726 mortars, 20,481 grenade launchers, 304 recoilless rifles, 289 howitzers, 202 APCs, and 4,316 trucks. The Khmer Navy had 171 vessels; the Khmer Air Force had 211 aircraft, including 64 North American T-28s, 14 Douglas AC-47 gunships and 44 helicopters. American Embassy military personnel – who were only supposed to coordinate the arms aid program – sometimes found themselves involved in prohibited advisory and combat tasks.

When the PAVN forces were supplanted, it was by the tough, rigidly indoctrinated peasant army of the Khmer Rouge with its core of seasoned leaders, who were now receiving the full support of Hanoi. Khmer Rouge forces, which had been reorganized at an Indochinese summit held in Guangzhou, China in April 1970, would grow from 12 to 15,000 in 1970 to 35–40,000 by 1972, when the so-called &quot;Khmerization&quot; of the conflict took place and combat operations against the Republic were handed over completely to the insurgents.

The development of these forces took place in three stages. 1970 to 1972 was a period of organization and recruitment, during which Khmer Rouge units served as auxiliaries to the PAVN. From 1972 to mid-1974, the insurgents formed units of battalion and regimental size. It was during this period that the Khmer Rouge began to break away from Sihanouk and his supporters and the collectivization of agriculture was begun in the &quot;liberated&quot; areas. Division-sized units were being fielded by 1974–1975, when the party was on its own and began the radical transformation of the country.

With the fall of Sihanouk, Hanoi became alarmed at the prospect of a pro-Western regime that might allow the Americans to establish a military presence on their western flank. To prevent this from happening, they began transferring their military installations away from the border regions to locations deeper within Cambodian territory. A new command center was established at the city of Kratié. The timing of the move was propitious, as President Nixon was of the opinion that:

===&quot;Chenla II&quot;===
During the night of 21 January 1971, a force of 100 PAVN/Viet Cong commandos attacked Pochentong airfield, the main base of the Khmer Air Force. With this one action, the raiders destroyed almost the entire inventory of government aircraft, including all of its fighter planes. This may have been a blessing in disguise, however, as the air force was largely composed of old (even obsolete) Soviet aircraft. The Americans soon replaced the airplanes with more advanced models. The attack did, however, stall a proposed FANK offensive. Two weeks later, Lon Nol had a stroke and was evacuated to Hawaii for treatment. It was a mild stroke, however, and the general recovered quickly, returning to Cambodia after only two months.

It was not until 20 August that FANK launched Operation Chenla II, its first offensive of the year. The objective of the campaign was to clear Route 6 of enemy forces and thereby reopen communications with Kompong Thom, the Republic&#x27;s second largest city, which had been isolated from the capital for more than a year. The operation was initially successful, and the city was relieved. The PAVN and Khmer Rouge counterattacked in November and December, annihilating government forces in the process. There was never an accurate count of the losses, but the estimate was &quot;on the order of ten battalions of personnel and equipment lost plus the equipment of an additional ten battalions.&quot; The strategic result of the failure of &quot;Chenla II&quot; was that the offensive initiative passed completely into the hands of PAVN and the Khmer Rouge.

==Agony of the Khmer Republic (1972–1975)==

===Struggling to survive===

From 1972 through 1974, the war was conducted along FANK&#x27;s lines of communications, north and south of the capital. Limited offensives were launched to maintain contact with the rice-growing regions of the northwest and along the Mekong River and Route 5, the Republic&#x27;s overland connections to South Vietnam. The strategy of the Khmer Rouge was to gradually cut those lines of communication and squeeze Phnom Penh. As a result, FANK forces became fragmented, isolated, and unable to lend one another mutual support.

The main U.S. contribution to the FANK effort came in the form of the bombers and tactical aircraft of the U.S. Air Force. When President Nixon launched the incursion in 1970, American and South Vietnamese troops operated under an umbrella of air cover that was designated Operation Freedom Deal. When those troops were withdrawn, the air operation continued, ostensibly to interdict PAVN/Viet Cong troop movements and logistics. In reality (and unknown to the U.S. Congress and American public), they were utilized to provide tactical air support to FANK. As a former U.S. military officer in Phnom Penh reported, &quot;the areas around the Mekong River were so full of bomb craters from B-52 strikes that, by 1973, they looked like the valleys of the moon.&quot;

On 10 March 1972, just before the newly renamed Constituent Assembly was to approve a revised constitution, Lon Nol suspended the deliberations. He then forced Cheng Heng, the head of state since Sihanouk&#x27;s deposition, to surrender his authority to him. On the second anniversary of the coup, Lon Nol relinquished his authority as head of state, but retained his position as prime minister and defense minister.

On 4 June, Lon Nol was elected as the first president of the Khmer Republic in a blatantly rigged election. As per the new constitution (ratified on 30 April), political parties formed in the new nation, quickly becoming a source of political factionalism. General Sutsakhan stated: &quot;the seeds of democratization, which had been thrown into the wind with such goodwill by the Khmer leaders, returned for the Khmer Republic nothing but a poor harvest.&quot;

In January 1973, hope was renewed when the Paris Peace Accords were signed, ending the conflict (for the time being) in South Vietnam and Laos. On 29 January, Lon Nol proclaimed a unilateral cease-fire throughout the nation. All U.S. bombing operations were halted in hopes of securing a chance for peace. It was not to be. The Khmer Rouge simply ignored the proclamation and carried on fighting. By March, heavy casualties, desertions, and low recruitment had forced Lon Nol to introduce conscription, and in April insurgent forces launched an offensive that pushed into the suburbs of the capital. The U.S. Air Force responded by launching an intense bombing operation that forced the communists back into the countryside after being decimated by the air strikes. The U.S. Seventh Air Force argued that the bombing prevented the fall of Phnom Penh in 1973 by killing 16,000 of 25,500 Khmer Rouge fighters besieging the city.

By the last day of Operation Freedom Deal (15 August 1973), 250,000 tons of bombs had been dropped on the Khmer Republic, 82,000 tons of which had been released in the last 45 days of the operation. Since the inception of Operation Menu in 1969, the U.S. Air Force had dropped 539,129 tons of ordnance on Cambodia/Khmer Republic.

===Shape of things to come===
As late as 1972–1973, it was a commonly held belief, both within and outside Cambodia, that the war was essentially a foreign conflict that had not fundamentally altered the nature of the Khmer people. By late 1973, however, there was a growing awareness among the government and population of Cambodia that the extremism, total lack of concern over casualties, and complete rejection of any offer of peace talks &quot;began to suggest that Khmer Rouge fanaticism and capacity for violence were deeper than anyone had suspected.&quot;

Reports of the brutal policies of the organization soon made their way to Phnom Penh and into the population, foretelling the violence that was about to consume the nation. There were tales of the forced relocations of entire villages, of the summary execution of any who disobeyed or even asked questions, the forbidding of religious practices, of monks who were defrocked or murdered, and where traditional sexual and marital habits were foresworn. The offhand manner in which the Khmer Rouge began dealing out death, which was so contrary to the Khmer character, was shocking. Reports of these atrocities began to surface during the same period in which North Vietnamese troops were withdrawing from Cambodian battlefields. The concentration of the PAVN effort on South Vietnam allowed the Khmer Rouge to apply their doctrine and policies without restraint for the first time.

The Khmer Rouge leadership was almost completely unknown by the public. They were referred to by their fellow countrymen as &quot;peap prey&quot; – the forest army. Previously, the very existence of the communist party as a component of GRUNK had been hidden. Within the &quot;liberated zones&quot; it was simply referred to as &quot;Angka&quot; – the organization. During 1973, the communist party fell under the control of its most fanatical members. Specifically, Pol Pot and Son Sen, who believed that &quot;Cambodia was to go through a total social revolution and that everything that had preceded it was anathema and must be destroyed.&quot;

Also hidden from scrutiny was the growing antagonism between the Khmer Rouge and their North Vietnamese allies. The radical leadership of the party could never escape the suspicion that Hanoi had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as its master. The Khmer Rouge were ideologically tied to the Chinese, while North Vietnam&#x27;s chief supporters, the Soviet Union, still recognized the Lon Nol government as legitimate.

After the signing of the Paris Peace Accords, PAVN cut off the supply of arms to the Khmer Rouge, hoping to force them into a cease-fire. When the Americans were freed by the signing of the accords to turn their air power completely on the Khmer Rouge, this too was blamed on Hanoi. During the year, these suspicions and attitudes led the party leadership to carry out purges within their own ranks. Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of Pol Pot.

As time passed, the need of the Khmer Rouge for the support of Prince Sihanouk lessened. The organization demonstrated to the people of the &#x27;liberated&#x27; areas in no uncertain terms that open expressions of support for Sihanouk would result in their liquidation. Although the prince still enjoyed the protection of the Chinese, when he made public appearances overseas to publicize the GRUNK cause, he was treated with almost open contempt by Ministers Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan. In June, the prince told Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci that when &quot;they [the Khmer Rouge] have sucked me dry, they will spit me out like a cherry stone.&quot;

By the end of 1973, Sihanouk loyalists had been purged from all of GRUNK&#x27;s ministries, and all of the prince&#x27;s supporters within the insurgent ranks were also eliminated. Shortly after Christmas, as the insurgents were gearing up for their final offensive, Sihanouk spoke with the French diplomat Etienne Manac&#x27;h. He said that his hopes for a moderate socialism akin to Yugoslavia&#x27;s must now be totally dismissed. Hoxha&#x27;s Albania, he said, would be the model.

===Fall of Phnom Penh===


By the time the Khmer Rouge initiated their dry-season offensive to capture the beleaguered Cambodian capital on 1 January 1975, the Republic was in chaos. The economy had been gutted, the transportation network had been reduced to air and waterways, the rice harvest had fallen by one-quarter, and the supply of freshwater fish (the chief source of protein for the country) had declined drastically. The cost of food was 20 times greater than pre-war levels, while unemployment was not even measured anymore.

Phnom Penh, which had a pre-war population of around 600,000, was overwhelmed by refugees (who continued to flood in from the steadily collapsing defense perimeter), growing to a size of around two million. These helpless and desperate civilians had no jobs and little in the way of food, shelter, or medical care. Their condition (and the government&#x27;s) only worsened when Khmer Rouge forces gradually gained control of the banks of the Mekong. From the riverbanks, their mines and gunfire steadily reduced the river convoys through which 90 percent of the Republic&#x27;s supplies moved, bringing relief supplies of food, fuel, and ammunition to the slowly starving city from South Vietnam.

After the river was effectively blocked in early February, the U.S. began an airlift of supplies into Pochentong Airport. This became increasingly risky, however, due to communist rocket and artillery fire, which constantly rained down on the airfield and city. The Khmer Rouge cut off overland supplies to the city for more than a year before it fell on 17 April 1975. Reports from journalists stated that the Khmer Rouge shelling &quot;tortured the capital almost continuously,&quot; inflicting &quot;random death and mutilation&quot; on millions of trapped civilians.

Desperate but determined units of FANK soldiers, many of whom had run out of ammunition, dug in around the capital and fought until they were overrun as the Khmer Rouge advanced. By the last week of March 1975, approximately 40,000 communist troops had surrounded the capital and began preparing to deliver the &quot;coup de grace&quot; to about half as many FANK forces.

Lon Nol resigned and left the country on 1 April, hoping that a negotiated settlement might still be possible if he was absent from the political scene. Saukam Khoy became acting president of a government that had less than three weeks to live. Last-minute efforts on the part of the U.S. to arrange a peace agreement involving Sihanouk ended in failure. When a vote in the U.S. Congress for a resumption of American air support failed, panic and a sense of doom pervaded the capital. The situation was best described by General Sak Sutsakhan (now FANK chief of staff):

On 12 April, concluding that all was lost, the U.S. evacuated its embassy personnel by helicopter during Operation Eagle Pull. The 276 evacuees included U.S. Ambassador John Gunther Dean, other American diplomatic personnel, Acting President Saukam Khoy, senior Khmer Republic government officials and their families, and members of the news media. In all, 82 U.S., 159 Cambodian, and 35 third-country nationals were evacuated. Although invited by Ambassador Dean to join the evacuation (and much to the Americans&#x27; surprise), Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak, Long Boret, Lon Non (Lon Nol&#x27;s brother), and most members of Lon Nol&#x27;s cabinet declined the offer. All of them chose to share the fate of their people. Their names were not published on the death lists and many trusted the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s assertions that former government officials would not be murdered, but would be welcome in helping to rebuild a new Cambodia.

After the Americans (and Saukam Khoy) had departed, a seven-member Supreme Committee, headed by General Sak Sutsakhan, assumed authority over the collapsing Republic. By 15 April, the last solid defenses of the city were overcome by the communists. In the early morning hours of 17 April, the committee decided to move the seat of government to Oddar Meanchey Province in the northwest. Around 10:00, the voice of General Mey Si Chan of the FANK general staff broadcast on the radio, ordering all FANK forces to cease firing, since &quot;negotiations were in progress&quot; for the surrender of Phnom Penh.

The war had now ended, and the Khmer Rouge announced the establishment of the Democratic Kampuchea. Long Boret was captured and beheaded on the grounds of the Cercle Sportif, while a similar fate would await Sirik Matak and other senior officials. Captured FANK officers were taken to the Monoram Hotel to write their biographies and then taken to the Olympic Stadium, where they were executed. Khmer Rouge troops immediately began to forcibly empty the capital city, driving the population into the countryside and killing tens of thousands of civilians in the process. The Year Zero had begun.

==Causes of death==
Of 240,000 Khmer–Cambodian deaths during the war, French demographer Marek Sliwinski attributes 46.3% to firearms, 31.7% to assassinations (a tactic primarily used by the Khmer Rouge), 17.1% to (mainly U.S.) bombing, and 4.9% to accidents. An additional 70,000 Cambodians of Vietnamese descent were massacred with the complicity of Lon Nol&#x27;s government during the war.

==War crimes==

=== Atrocities ===
In the Cambodian Civil War, Khmer Rouge insurgents reportedly committed many atrocities. These included the murder of civilians and POWs by sawing off their heads over the course of days, the destruction of Buddhist wats and the killing of monks, attacks on refugee camps involving the deliberate murder of babies and bomb threats against foreign aid workers, the abduction and assassination of journalists, and the shelling of Phnom Penh for more than a year. Journalist accounts stated that the Khmer Rouge shelling &quot;tortured the capital almost continuously&quot;, inflicting &quot;random death and mutilation&quot; on 2 million trapped civilians.

The Khmer Rouge forcibly evacuated the entire city after taking it, in what has been described as a death march: François Ponchaud wrote: &quot;I shall never forget one cripple who had neither hands nor feet, writhing along the ground like a severed worm, or a weeping father carrying his ten-year-old daughter wrapped in a sheet tied around his neck like a sling, or the man with his foot dangling at the end of a leg to which it was attached by nothing but skin&quot;; John Swain recalled that the Khmer Rouge were &quot;tipping out patients from the hospitals like garbage into the streets ... In five years of war, this is the greatest caravan of human misery I have seen.&quot;

=== Use of child soldiers ===

The Khmer Rouge exploited thousands of desensitized, conscripted children in their early teens to commit mass murder and other atrocities during the genocide. The indoctrinated children were taught to follow any order without hesitation. During its guerrilla war after it had been deposed, the Khmer Rouge continued to use children widely until at least 1998. During this period, children were deployed mainly in unpaid support roles, such as ammunition-carriers, and also as combatants.

<text>Robert Marcel Charles Benoist (20 March 1895 – 11 September 1944) was a French Grand Prix motor racing driver. He won several Grand Prix racing events and the 24 Hours of Le Mans between 1924 and 1937.

During World War II, Benoist, resisted the German occupation of France and worked as an agent in France for the clandestine British Special Operations Executive (SOE) organization. SOE&#x27;s objectives were to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in countries occupied by the Axis powers, especially those occupied by Nazi Germany. SOE agents allied themselves with French resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment. In 1943, Benoist was captured by the Germans in Paris, but escaped and fled to Britain. Returning to France, he led a sabotage campaign around Nantes, but he was captured again in June 1944 and executed.

==Early life==
Benoist was born in Auffargis, near Rambouillet, Île-de-France, France on 20 March 1895. He was the son of Jeanne and Gaston Benoist. His father was the gamekeeper of Baron Henri de Rothschild&#x27;s estate. Benoist had a younger brother named Maurice. During World War I, Robert Benoist served in the French army but soon became a fighter pilot in the French Air Force. Benoist married Paule Ajustron when he was 27 years old and the couple had a child, Jacqueline. Benoist also had a mistress, Huguette Stocker.

==Grand Prix driver==
Looking for excitement in the post-war world, Benoist joined the &quot;de Marçay&quot; car company as a test driver. He then moved on to Salmson and was very successful in cyclecar races before being signed to drive for Delage in 1924. The next year, teamed with Albert Divo, he won the French Grand Prix in the race that claimed the life of Italian racing star Antonio Ascari.

In 1927, driving a Delage 15-S-8, he won the French, Spanish, Italian and British Grand Prix races, earning the season championship title for the French manufacturer.

When the Delage company dropped out of racing, Robert Benoist was without a job and was appointed manager of the Banville Garage in Paris. He did occasional races for the Bugatti team, finishing second in the 1928 San Sebastián Grand Prix in Spain.

The following year he teamed up with Attilio Marinoni to win the Spa 24 Hours race in Belgium, driving an Alfa Romeo. At the end of the season he retired until 1934, when he made a comeback with the Bugatti team. He was soon made head of the competition department and masterminded the company&#x27;s Le Mans programme. In 1937 he partnered with Jean-Pierre Wimille to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race. Following that victory, Benoist retired from driving, but continued to run Bugatti&#x27;s racing department.

==World War II==
France was defeated and occupied by Nazi Germany in 1940. The United Kingdom, headed by Winston Churchill, created the clandestine Special Operations Executive (SOE) to contest German occupation of France and other countries by encouraging French resistance to Germany and providing the resistance with arms and supplies. On 29 May 1942, SOE agent William Grover-Williams, a former race car driver and rival of Benoist, parachuted into France. Grover-Williams&#x27; job was to create a network, called &quot;Chestnut,&quot; to operate near Paris and assist the incipient French resistance. Beginning in mid-February 1943, Chestnut received from SOE headquarters six large parachute drops of weapons and other supplies for the French resistance. The arms and other supplies were stored at the Benoist chateau for future use. 

The downfall of the Chestnut network began on 31 July 1943 when a German direction-finding van pinpointed the location of Chestnut&#x27;s radio operator Roland Dowlen and captured him. On 1 August, Robert&#x27;s brother, Maurice, was captured. The next day Maurice Benoist led the German &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD) to the Benoist chateau at Auffargis. Grover-Williams was found hiding in a stable and arrested. The Germans recovered many containers of arms and equipment at the chateau. Dowlen and Grover-Williams were later executed by the Germans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grehan/Mace&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capture and escape===
Robert Benoist had not been at the chateau during the German raid. Hearing of the raid, he went into hiding, but attempted to find out what had happened. The German SD intercepted one of his phone calls and learned that he was at the Place Gambetta in Paris. On 4 August, Benoist was apprehended by three Germans as he was leaving a telephone booth. While he was being driven to SD headquarters, he managed to open a door on the moving automobile, push a German out the door, jump out of the auto, and disappear into the crowd on the busy street. Benoist took refuge in the apartment of a friend. With the Germans closing in on him, Benoist escaped over the roofs of neighboring buildings. Entering one building, a night watchman recognised him as the famous race car driver and said, &quot;You look as though you could use a drink.&quot; Benoist and the watchman shared a drink and then Benoist continued his flight. Benoist next took refuge for twelve days in the apartment of his secretary, Stella Tayssedre, who kept him informed of what she knew of the German search for him.

Benoist&#x27;s plight as a fugitive was not unique. The Germans were capturing many SOE agents and hundreds of their French supporters during the summer of 1943. Benoist got in touch with Henri Dericourt, SOE&#x27;s air movements officer in France (and later believed to be a double agent working also for the Germans). Dericourt arranged for a Royal Air Force Lockheed Hudson to land secretly on a farm field near Angers on the night of 19 August to pick up Benoist and nine SOE agents who were also on the run. Benoist took a train to the village of Briollay (near Angers), walked three miles to the farm field, waited in the darkness for the plane to arrive, and joined the other SOE agents in boarding the plane for the flight to England. They arrived safely.

===Back to France===
Benoist trained in explosives while in England. Because of his fame SOE was reluctant to send him back to France, but on the night of 19-20 October 1943, he flew back to France on a limited mission to create the Clergyman network. His code name was &quot;Lionel&quot;. His job was to organise a group to destroy the power pylons across the Loire River at Île Héron near Nantes. Benoist went beyond his mandate, visited Paris, and made plans (never realised) to assassinate senior German SD officials in France. Lacking explosives to carry out the destruction of the pylons he returned to Britain by clandestine flight on the night of 4-5 February 1944.

At SOE headquarters in London, Benoist argued that he should be allowed to return to France to carry out his plan to destroy the power pylons. SOE granted his wish but banned him from visiting Paris, where he was too well known, and added the additional task for him to destroy the telephone networks in Nantes when instructed to do so by SOE. To carry out the mission, Benoist was given 500,000 francs (about 50,000 British pounds in 2022 values) and told to request more money if necessary. To facilitate communication, Denise Bloch, a radio operator with previous SOE experience in France, accompanied him.

Benoist and Bloch returned to France the night of 2-3 March 1944 via airplane, landing in a farm field. In late April and early May, they received three large parachute drops of arms for the resistance and additional radios. On 16 May, Benoist&#x27;s saboteurs blew up the Île Héron power pylons supplying Nantes, leaving the city without power for a week. On 26 May they again destroyed the repaired pylons. On 28 May allied bombers bombed Nantes. This was all in preparation for the D-Day invasion of France which would occur on 6 June in Normandy, about north of Nantes. On 5 June, Benoist was told via radio that the invasion of France was imminent and he alerted the resistance which destroyed the telephone system of Nantes and sabotaged railroads. The allied plan was for the resistance to disrupt German communications and transport throughout France, prior to and after the invasion.

On 17 June, Benoist called a meeting of the key members of the network at his villa near Sermaise, a violation of SOE&#x27;s guidance that members of a network should have as little contact with each other as possible. During dinner, he announced that he had received news that his mother was dying in Paris and he was leaving to visit her. He warned that if he didn&#x27;t return by lunch the next day, 18 June, the members of the network should disperse. Benoist&#x27;s mother died before he arrived in Paris and he and his sister, Charlotte Perdrigé (a courier for Benoist), were captured by Germans waiting for Benoist in a safe house. They were interrogated and one of them may have told the Germans of the Sermaise meeting, assuming that the group there had dispersed. However, Benoist&#x27;s instruction to his associates to disperse had not been heeded and at 8 p.m. on 18 June the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) raided the villa and captured Bloch and the others.

===Imprisonment and execution===
Benoist attempted to escape shortly after his capture by climbing through a bathroom window, but was caught by the Germans. He was taken to SD headquarters at 84 Avenue Foch in Paris and interrogated by SD leader Josef Kieffer and his subordinates for nearly a month. Kieffer&#x27;s methods of interrogation were often apparent kindness combined with suggestions that prisoner had been betrayed by one of his own and that SD knew all there was to know about him and his network. Benoist was led to believe that Violette Szabo, a celebrated SOE agent, had betrayed him.

On 8 August, Benoist and 36 other SOE agents, including three women, were loaded onto buses, given Red Cross parcels containing food, and taken to the railroad station where they boarded a train for Germany. The allied armies were approaching Paris and would capture the city on 25 August. Benoist was chained to George Wilkinson during the trip. Wilkinson described him as &quot;charming&quot;, a person &quot;one could trust,&quot; and &quot;one who could have been the leader of the group if he had tried.&quot; During the trip, the train was attacked and disabled by allied fighter planes, although none of the prisoners were hurt. The prisoners were loaded onto trucks and continued their journey to Neue Bremm a concentration camp near the city of Saarbrücken. Some of the prisoners, led by F. F. E. Yeo-Thomas, supported by Benoist, wanted to attempt an escape, but others disagreed and forced the abandonment of the escape plan. The prisoners opposing the escape attempt harbored the thought that they would be treated as prisoners-of-war rather than spies. After a few days of brutal treatment, all 34 of the male prisoners were loaded into trucks and taken to Buchenwald concentration camp. The three women were sent to Ravensbrück, a camp for women.

On 9 September at Buchenwald, the camp commandant received an order to give 16 of the prisoners &quot;special treatment.&quot; At Buchenwald that meant execution by being choked to death while suspended above the floor on a meat hook. Benoist was among the 16 executed on 11 September 1944. Thirteen of 18 SOE agents remaining in Buchenwald were also executed or died of disease. Five survived. The Germans executed the three women SOE prisoners on 5 February 1945. Benoist&#x27;s radio operator, Denise Bloch, was one of them.

==Legacy==
Following Germany&#x27;s surrender, on 9 September 1945, the &quot;Coupe Robert Benoist&quot; automobile race was held in Paris in his memory. The race was won by his racing and resistance colleague Jean-Pierre Wimille. The village of Auffargis named a street after him and the Linas-Monthléry race track honored Benoist with a monument. Among the grandstands at the former Reims-Gueux circuit in France is one named &quot;Tribune Robert Benoist&quot;. 

Captain Robert Benoist is recorded on the Brookwood Memorial in Surrey, Britain as one of the SOE agents who died for the liberation of France. He is listed on the &quot;Roll of Honor&quot; on the Valençay SOE Memorial in the town of Valençay, in the Indre of France.

<text>Saarlouis (; , ; formerly Sarre-Libre and Saarlautern) is a town in Saarland, Germany, capital of the district of Saarlouis. In 2020, the town had a population of 34,409. Saarlouis is located on the river Saar. It was built as a fortress in 1680 and was named after Louis XIV of France.

==History==

With the Treaties of Peace of Nijmegen in 1678/79, Lorraine fell to France. In 1680, Louis XIV of France gave orders to build a fortification (to defend the new French eastern frontier) on the banks of the river Saar which was called &quot;Sarre-Louis&quot;. Notable French military engineer, Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, constructed the town, which would serve as the capital of the Province de la Sarre. The plans were made by Thomas de Choisy, the town&#x27;s first Gouvenour. In 1683, Louis XIV visited the fortress and granted arms. The coat of arms shows the rising sun and three Fleur-de-lis. The heraldic motto is &quot;Dissipat Atque Fovet&quot;: He (the Sun) dispels (the clouds) and heats (the earth).

In 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick made most parts of Lorraine independent again, but Saarlouis and the surrounding areas remained a French exclave. During the French Revolution, the town was renamed Sarre-Libre, but it returned to its original name in 1810. With the Treaty of Paris in 1815, Saarlouis (and the whole region later known as the Saargebiet) became Prussian.

Marshal Michel Ney, who was born in Saarlouis, was arrested and tried for treason after the failure of Napoleon I&#x27;s Waterloo Campaign. Ney&#x27;s attorney tried to use the Prussian annexation to save his client&#x27;s life, arguing that Ney was no longer a French citizen and therefore exempt from the court&#x27;s jurisdiction. Ney refused to cooperate, declaring himself to be French, and so was convicted and later executed.

After World War I, French troops occupied Saarlouis. The Saargebiet became a protectorate of the League of Nations for 15 years. In 1933, a considerable number of anti-Nazi Germans fled to the Saar, as it was the only part of Germany left outside the Third Reich&#x27;s control. As a result, anti-Nazi groups campaigned heavily for the Saarland to remain under control of League of Nations as long as Adolf Hitler ruled Germany. However, long-held sentiments against France remained entrenched, and very few sympathized openly with France. When the 15-year-term was over, a plebiscite was held in the territory on 13 January 1935: 90.3% of those voting wished to rejoin Germany.

From 1936 till 1945, Saarlouis was named as Saarlautern (&quot;-lautern&quot; being a common ending of town and village names in Germany) in an attempt by the Nazis to Germanise the town name.

After World War II, the region (then called the Saarland), was again occupied by France. In a plebiscite in 1955, most of the people in the Saarland opted for the reunification with the Federal Republic of Germany, and on 1 January 1957, it became the 10th federal state of West Germany.

In 1980, Saarlouis celebrated its 300th anniversary.

==Incorporated districts==
Over time, the following districts have been incorporated into Saarlouis:
* Beaumarais (1936)
* Fraulautern (1936)
* Lisdorf (1936)
* Neuforweiler (1970)
* Picard (1936)
* Roden (1907)
* Steinrausch (1972)

==Fortifications==
Even today, the fortress dominates the town&#x27;s hexagonal floor plan. Beside the buildings made by &quot;Vauban&quot;, there are also some constructions left from the 19th century when the Prussians got control over the town. After 1887, some parts of the fortress were slighted, but many buildings and places, e.g. the casemates, some barracks and the &quot;Great Market&quot; with the Commander&#x27;s Office and the &quot;Vauban island&quot;, a former ravelin with a memorial for Michel Ney can still be seen today.

==Economy and infrastructure==
Saarlouis was famous for its nearby steel and iron ore production and its nearby mining facilities. Today, the Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Saarlouis Body &amp; Assembly is the town&#x27;s largest employer, producing the Ford Focus. The plant in the Roederberg suburb opened in 1970, but in 2022 is threatened with closure when the Ford Focus production cycle runs out in 2025.

The industrial port in Saarlouis-Roden is Germany&#x27;s 13th largest inland port. Saarlouis is also a manufacturer of chocolate.

==Politics==
Saarlouis is part of the Saarlouis (electoral district) in the Bundestag, represented by Peter Altmaier.

==Transport==
Saarlouis has a station on the Saar railway that provides hourly connections to Saarbrücken and Trier.

It is connected to Saarbrücken by the A 620 and with Luxembourg by the A 8.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Saarlouis is twinned with:
* Saint-Nazaire, France (1969)
* Eisenhüttenstadt, Germany (1986; the first West and East German town twinning)
* Matiguás, Nicaragua (1986)

==Notable people==
*Michel Ney (1769–1815), Marshal of France
*Heinrich Marx (1777–1838), lawyer and father of Karl Marx
*Martin de Bervanger (1795–1865), priest
*Charles-Nicolas Peaucellier (1832–1913), general and inventor of the Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage
*Eduard von Knorr (1840–1920), admiral of the Imperial German Navy and chief of the East Asia Squadrons
*Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck (1870–1964), colonial general and politician

<text>Contacts is a computerized address book software included with the Apple operating systems iOS, iPadOS, watchOS and macOS. It includes various cloud synchronization capabilities and integrates with other Apple applications and features, including iMessage, FaceTime and the iCloud service (and previously its predecessor MobileMe).

==History==
An application known as Address Book was included with Mac OS X from its release in 2001 and in preceding beta versions. Address Book was rewritten for Mac OS X Jaguar (2002) and as of 2020 has remained in roughly the same form ever since. 

The iPhone also included contacts storage from its release, which starting from iPhone OS 2 (2008) was also broken out into a standalone application. In 2010, the iPad with iOS 3.2 introduced a new two-pane contacts app, featuring the skeuomorphic design style popular with Apple around this time under the leadership of Scott Forstall.

OS X Lion (2011) featured a redesigned Address Book application in the style of the iPad Contacts app, also in a two-pane design. In 2012 with OS X Mountain Lion it returned to a three-pane design and changed names to match iOS. 

The following year, both versions of Contacts switched with their parent operating systems to a more flat design style, a change attributed to Forstall&#x27;s departure from Apple in the autumn of 2012. In 2013 iOS Contacts switched to the new UI along with the whole of iOS 7, while with OS X Mavericks the skeuomorphic design was removed leaving a basic UI. With OS X Yosemite (2014) the OS X Contacts app switched along with the rest of the operating system to the iOS 7-style UI.

In 2021, Apple introduced Contacts to Apple Watch in watchOS 8.

==User interface==
Contacts has two viewing modes: View Card and Column and View Card Only. The user can switch between modes with a control in the upper-left portion of the window under the close box.

In releases prior to Lion, in View Card and Column, the Contacts window is divided into three panes. The first pane has the title Group. This pane lists All, Directories, and each user-made group. Users can add new groups by pulling the File menu down to New Group, or typing Command-Shift-N.

When selecting All or a user-made group, the second column has the title Name. It lists the names of the people with cards in that group, or all the names if the selected group is All, in alphabetical order by first or last name, depending on user preference.

The third pane has the card corresponding to the selected name. The card can include information, some of which the user can classify into customizable categories like Home and Work. Many of the fields can have duplicate entries, for example, if the person the card describes has several email addresses. The user can edit the fields by pressing the edit button below the bottom-left of the third pane. Default fields include:

*Picture
*Name pronunciation
*First name
*Last name
*Job title
*Company
*Phone number
*Email address
*Home page
*Birthday
*Instant messaging username
**AIM
**ICQ
**XMPP
**Windows Live Messenger
**Yahoo! Messenger
*Address
*Related Names
*Note

Contacts can search LDAP (network) directories. Users customize these in the LDAP tab of the preferences. Users search these by selecting Directories in the first pane, selecting a directory or All in the second pane, and typing their search in the search box above the top-left of the third pane. Results appear in the third pane.

<text>The northern rough-winged swallow (Stelgidopteryx serripennis) is a small, migratory swallow. It is very similar to the southern rough-winged swallow, &quot;Stelgidopteryx ruficollis&quot;.

==Taxonomy and etymology==

The genus name, &quot;Stelgidopteryx&quot;, is from Ancient Greek and means &quot;scraper wing&quot; and the species name, &quot;serripennis&quot;, is derived from Latin and means &quot;saw feather&quot;. In the common name, &quot;rough-winged&quot; refers to the serrated edge feathers on the wing of this bird; this feature would only be apparent when holding this bird.

===Subspecies===

Six subspecies of the northern rough-winged swallow are currently recognized.

*&quot;S. s. serripennis&quot; is the nominate subspecies and can be found to occur in southern Alaska and Canada to the southern United States. They are found to usually winter in southern Florida and from southwestern Mexico to Panama. It was described by Audubon in 1838.
*&quot;S. s. psammochrous&quot; was described by Ludlow Griscom in 1929. It breeds in the southwestern US and winters from central Mexico to Panama. It can be differentiated from the nominate race by being paler, especially on the crown and rump.
*&quot;S. s. fulvipennis&quot; is a resident of central Mexico to Costa Rica. It was the first subspecies to be differentiated from the nominate race, &quot;serripennis&quot;, and was differentiated by Philip Sclater in 1860. It is darker above; the crown darker more so. The shafts of the undertail coverts, the feathers under the tail, covering the base, have been observed to be darker near the end. The throat of these swallows seems to be slightly buff, unlike most of the other subspecies.
*&quot;S. s. stuarti&quot;, a very dark variant of the northern rough-winged swallow, was described by Pierce Brodkorb in 1942. It is resident to the southern Mexico lowlands and south to eastern Guatemala. Like the race &quot;fulvipennis&quot;, it has a slightly buff throat. The undertail coverts also have black tips.
*&quot;S. s. ridgwayi&quot;, described by Edward Nelson in 1901, is a subspecies resident to the northern Yucatán Peninsula. It is larger than the nominate race with a whitish spot above its lores and has blackish tips on the longest of its undertail coverts. In addition, it is darker above and has paler anterior underparts.
*&quot;S. s. burleighi&quot;, described by Allan Robert Phillips in 1986, is the most recent, widely accepted subspecies. It is resident to Belize and Guatemala, and is the darkest of the subspecies.

It has been proposed that another race &quot;aphracta&quot; be recognized, but this is debated. This race is apparently described as being darker above with a greyer throat compared to &quot;serripennis&quot;. It has been described as occurring in the western Great Basin region, in the United States.

==Description==

Adults are in length, brown above with white underparts, a small bill, and a forked tail. Their throat is white with a brownish-grey wash, and below the throat are white underparts. The adults have a wingspan of and a weight of . The males&#x27; undertail coverts are longer and broader than those of the females. The males also have hooked barbs on the outer web of their outer primary wings. The barbs on the females are shorter and straighter than those of the males. Juveniles can be distinguished from adults by their reddish-brown wing-bars.

They are similar in appearance to the bank swallow, but have a dusky throat and breast. They are closely related and very similar to the southern rough-winged swallow, &quot;Stelgidopteryx ruficollis&quot;, but that species has a more contrasting rump, and the ranges do not quite overlap.
===Call===

The call of this swallow is described as a short, harsh &quot;zeep&quot;. It has also been described as a rough, low &quot;bzzt&quot;. It is often doubled. This call is similar to the call of the bank swallow.

==Distribution==

 The northern rough-winged swallow is native to Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Cayman Islands, Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Puerto Rico, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Turks and Caicos Islands, and the United States. They are vagrant to Aruba, Barbados, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, Curaçao, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, and Sint Maarten. The populations in the US and Canada have been found to winter in the southernmost US and further south. While this is true, the populations in Mexico and further south seem to be non-migratory, although local post-breeding movements do occur. This swallow has been found to occur as high as in Costa Rica. 

==Behaviour==

===Nesting and Breeding===
The northern rough-winged swallow usually nests by itself, although sometimes it is found in loose groups, often at the edge of bank swallow colonies, of up to 25 pairs. The nests are found in burrows located in soil banks, very occasionally caves and trees, and in human-made cavities such as gutters and tubes. These burrows are usually built by other species, and measure anywhere from in length, although most fall between . They are at a height of around above ground-level. The nest itself is built by this species, and made with a variety of fibres, including grasses, leaves, rootlets, twigs, bark, and pine needles. Moss and dung are also used. The nest is then lined with grass. These materials are wholly or almost wholly collected by the female.

The breeding season generally extends from May to about mid-July, but this varies by region. In north-eastern North America, the breeding season starts about mid-May, while it starts in early June in the north-west, with both ending in August. In the southern parts of its range, this bird lays its eggs earlier; for example, from mid-April to mid-May in Costa Rica.

The northern rough-winged swallow lays a single clutch, although sometimes another clutch is laid if the first one fails, of four to eight glossy white eggs that measure about on average. It has been observed that the clutch size decreases with decreasing latitude. These eggs are incubated by the female for 16 to 18 days. Because the female starts incubating as soon as the first egg is laid, the eggs hatch asynchronously.

====Migration habits====

The northern rough-winged swallow migrates to the Gulf Coast of the United States and south to Central America for winter. They have also been recorded to winter in the Caribbean.

When the breeding season is finished, they usually form large flocks and roost together in marshes and similar environments. Sometimes, in adverse weather conditions, several of these swallows can be seen to share a burrow.

===Diet===

When foraging, their flight paths are low and direct. They fly with slow, deep wingbeats interspersed with periods of gliding. They usually feed over water and occasionally over land. They are insectivores, feeding almost exclusively on flying insects. Although this is true, there is a report of some feeding on cracked corn. To drink, they skim the surface of the water with their wing and then drink on their wing.

==Status==

The northern rough-winged swallow is classified as least concern by the IUCN. Although its population is declining, it is not declining fast enough nor is its range small enough to justify a classification of vulnerable. In addition, this species is estimated to be composed of about 15 million individual birds, so it is not vulnerable under the population size criterion. This swallow has been found to adapt well to humans and sometimes nests in artificial cavities created by them.

<text>DEFA (&quot;Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft&quot;) was the state-owned film studio of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) throughout the country&#x27;s existence. Since 2019, DEFA&#x27;s film heritage has been made accessible and licensable on the PROGRESS archive platform. The DEFA Foundation is a non-profit organisation that was established in order to preserve the films in the DEFA library as well as the film studios, and make them accessible to the public.

==History==

DEFA was founded in Spring 1946 in the Soviet Occupied Zone in eastern Germany; it was the first film production company in post-World War II Germany. While the other Allies, in their zones of occupation, viewed a rapid revival of a German film industry with suspicion, the Soviets valued the medium as a primary means of re-educating the German populace as it emerged from twelve years of Nazi rule.

Headquartered in Berlin, the company was formally authorized by the Soviet Military Administration to produce films on 13 May 1946, although Wolfgang Staudte had already begun work on DEFA&#x27;s first film, &quot;Die Mörder sind unter uns&quot; (&quot;The Murderers Are Among Us&quot;) nine days earlier. The original board of directors consisted of Alfred Lindemann, Karl Hans Bergmann, and Herbert Volkmann, with Hans Klering as administrative Secretary. Klering, a former graphic designer, also designed DEFA&#x27;s logo. On 13 August 1946, the company was officially registered as a joint-stock company (). By the end of the year, in addition to the Staudte film, it had completed two other feature films using the former Tobis studio facilities in Berlin and the Althoff Studios in Babelsberg. Subsequently, its principal studio was the Babelsberg Studio built by Ufa in the 1920s.

On 14 July 1947, the company officially moved its headquarters to the Babelsberg Studio, and on 13 November 1947, the company&#x27;s &quot;stock&quot; was taken over by the Socialist Unity Party or SED, which had originally capitalized DEFA, and pro-Soviet German individuals. Soviets Ilya Trauberg and Aleksandr Wolkenstein joined Lindemann, Bergmann and Volkmann on the board of directors, and a committee was established under the auspices of the Socialist Unity Party to review projects and screen rushes.

In July 1948, Lindemann was dismissed from the board of directors because of alleged &quot;financial irregularities&quot; and replaced briefly by Walter Janka. In October 1948, the SED was instrumental in replacing Janka, Volkmann and Bergmann as corporate directors with official party members Wilhelm Meissner, and Grete Keilson. In December, the death of Trauberg and the resignation of Wolkenstein resulted in two more Soviets in their stead, Aleksandr Andriyevsky and Leonid Antonov.

In 1948, the division of Germany into zones controlled by the Soviet Union and by the Western Allies came into effect. The SED eventually became openly Communist, with a strong Stalinist orientation. On 23 May 1949, the Allies&#x27; Germany officially became the Federal Republic of Germany (commonly known as West Germany), and on 7 October 1949, the Soviet zone officially became the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Ownership of DEFA as well as all DEFA assets were transferred to the newly created state. On 23 June 1950, , a hardline Communist, was appointed director-general of DEFA.

As socialist realism took hold at DEFA, the definition of desirable and acceptable themes for films became narrower. In June 1947, a film writer&#x27;s conference held in Potsdam produced general agreement that the &quot;new&quot; German cinema would disavow both subjects and stylistic elements reminiscent of those seen on German screens during, and prior to, the Nazi era. By 1949, expectations for scripts were codified around a small number of topics, such as &quot;[re-]distribution of land&quot; or &quot;the two-year plan&quot;. As in the Soviet Union, the excessive control placed by the state on authors of screenplays, as against other literary works, discouraged many competent writers from contributing to East German film. Screenwriters could find their efforts rejected for ideological reasons at any stage in script development, if not from the outset. As a result, between 1948 and 1953, when Stalin died, the entire film output for East Germany, excluding newsreels and non-theatrical educational films, amounted to fewer than 50 titles.In the 1960s, DEFA produced the popular Red Western &quot;The Sons of the Great Mother Bear&quot;, directed by Josef Mach and starring Gojko Mitić as the Sioux Tokei-itho. This spawned a number of sequels and was notable for inverting Western clichés by portraying the native Americans as the &quot;good guys&quot;, and the American army as the &quot;baddies&quot;.

In 1992, after German reunification, DEFA was officially dissolved and its combined studios sold to a French conglomerate, Compagnie Générale des Eaux, later Vivendi Universal. In 2004, a private consortium acquired the studios. The films produced at the DEFA studios after World War II included approximately 950 feature films, 820 animated films, more than 5,800 documentaries and newsreels, and 4,000 foreign language movies dubbed into German, which were acquired by the privatized successor to the former East German film distribution monopoly, PROGRESS.

In October 2005, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City hosted a two-week DEFA festival.

===Das Stacheltier===
Das Stacheltier is a satirical series of short films that was produced in East Germany by the DEFA Film Studios from 1953 to 1964. The short films were meant to be shown in film theatres preceding the newsreel and the main feature. The only feature film in the series was the silent film &quot;Der junge Engländer&quot; directed by Gottfried Kolditz in 1958.

Many well-known East German directors and actors contributed to the film series, including Frank Beyer, Erwin Geschonneck, Gisela May, Rudolf Wessely, Otto Tausig, Peter Sturm, Rolf Herricht and Heinz Schubert.

In 2019, Progress was acquired by LOOKSfilm. Since April 1, 2019, the entire film heritage of the GDR has been made internationally accessible and licensable on the Progress Film archive platform.

==DEFA Foundation==
The DEFA Foundation is a non-profit organisation established by the Federal Government of Germany on 15 December 1998. It was established in order to preserve the films in the DEFA library, as well as the former East German film studios, and oversee their use for the public good as part of the national cultural heritage of Germany. It holds around 700 feature films; 450 short fiction films; 950 animated films; 2,000 documentary films; 2,500 serial films; 6,700 German language dubbed foreign films; various other films made after 1990, and various ephemera such as film posters and manuscripts. The foundation has also been making digitised copies of its films since 2012.

In 2013, the foundation established the Heiner Carow Prize (for best German young film), which is awarded to films shown in the Panorama program of the Berlin International Film Festival.

<text>Altered States is a 1980 American science fiction horror film directed by Ken Russell, and adapted by playwright and screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky from his 1978 novel of the same name. The novel and the film are based in part on John C. Lilly&#x27;s sensory deprivation research conducted in isolation tanks under the influence of psychoactive drugs like mescaline, ketamine, and LSD. The film features elements of both psychological horror and body horror.

Chayefsky withdrew from the project after disputes with Russell and took his name off the credits, substituting &quot;Sidney Aaron&quot;, his actual first and middle names. The film stars William Hurt, Blair Brown, Bob Balaban, and Charles Haid. It marked the film debut of Hurt and Drew Barrymore (in a small role). The film score was composed by John Corigliano and conducted by Christopher Keene.

Warner Bros. gave the film a limited theatrical release in the United States on December 25, 1980, followed by a wide release in February 1981. The film garnered generally positive reviews from critics, and was nominated for Best Original Score and Best Sound at the 53rd Academy Awards.

==Plot==
In 1967, Edward Jessup is a Columbia University psychopathologist studying schizophrenia. He begins to think that &quot;our other states of consciousness are as real as our waking states.&quot; He begins experimenting with sensory deprivation using a flotation tank, aided by two like-minded researchers, Arthur Rosenberg and Mason Parrish. At a faculty party, he meets fellow &quot;whiz kid,&quot; and his future wife, Emily.

Over a decade later, Edward is a tenured professor at Harvard Medical School. He and Emily have two daughters, and are on the brink of divorce, when they reunitefor the first time in seven yearswith the couple who had first introduced them. When Edward hears about the Hinchi tribe, whose members experience shared hallucinatory states, he decides to travel to Mexico in order to participate in their ceremony. 

During the climb up into the Hinchi hill country (a plateau covered in spectacular mushroom-shaped ventifacts) Edward is told by his guide, Eduardo Echeverria, that the Hinchi use in their ceremonies a potion containing the sacred mushroom &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; and the shrub sinicuiche, which they are collecting for next year&#x27;s ceremonies. The tribe calls sinicuiche by a Hinchi name meaning &quot;first/primordial flower&quot; in recognition of the deep memory states which it can evoke. An indigenous elder (&quot;the brujo&quot;) is seen with a root in his hand, which he asks Edward to hold, before cutting Edward&#x27;s hand in order to add some drops of blood to the mixture he is preparing. Immediately after consuming the mixture, Edward experiences bizarre, intense hallucinations, including one of the petrifaction and subsequent erosion by blown sand of Emily and himself. 

The following morning, Edward leaves the Hinchi plateau under a cloud, having killed, while in his intoxicated state, a large specimen of the Hinchi&#x27;s sacred monitor lizard (which a petroglyph shown in the dream sequence shows that they believe to have given them the sacred mushroom in the mythic past). He returns to the U.S. with a sample of the Hinchi potion for analysis by his colleagues and further self-experimentation, and continues taking it in order to take his exploration of altered states of consciousness to a new and higher level.

When toxic concentrations of the substance make increased dosage dangerous, Edward returns to sensory deprivation, believing it will enhance the effects of the substance at his current dose. Repairing a disused tank in a medical school, Edward uses it to experience a series of increasingly drastic visions, including one of early Hominidae. Monitored by his colleagues, Edward insists that his visions have &quot;externalized&quot;. Emerging from the tank, his mouth bloody, frantically writing notes because he is unable to speak, Edward insists on being X-rayed before he &quot;reconstitutes.&quot; A radiologist inspecting the X-rays says they belong to a gorilla.

In later experiments, Edward experiences actual, physical biological devolution. At one stage he emerges from the isolation tank as a feral and curiously small-statured, light-skinned caveman, going on a rampage through some streets in town and breaking into a zoo before returning to his natural form. Despite his colleagues&#x27; concern, Edward stubbornly continues. In the final experiment, Edward experiences a more profound regression, transforming into an amorphous mass of conscious, primordial matter. An energy wave released from the experiment stuns Edward&#x27;s colleagues and destroys his tank. Emily recovers and finds a swirling maelstrom where the tank had been. She searches in the vortex for Edward, finding him as he is on the brink of becoming a non-corporeal energy being that will vanish from reality altogether if this transformation reaches its conclusion.

His friends bring Edward home, hoping that the transformations will end. Watched over by Emily, Edward begins to regress uncontrollably again, the transformations no longer requiring the intake of &quot;first flower&quot; or sensory deprivation. Urging Edward to fight the change, Emily grabs his hand, immediately being enveloped by the primordial energy emanating from Edward. The sight of Emily apparently being consumed by the energy stirs the human consciousness in Edward&#x27;s devolving form. He fights the transformation and returns to his human form. Edward embraces Emily, as she returns to normal.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
The film had its origins with a meeting Paddy Chayefsky had with his friends Bob Fosse and Herb Gardner at the Russian Tea Room in 1975. They were feeling &quot;disgruntled&quot; and as a joke conceived a movie they could make together. They wanted to pitch something to Dino De Laurentiis, who was making &quot;King Kong&quot;. After discussing a version of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; they decided to do a version of &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;. Chayefsky went home and wrote a three-page &quot;dramatic statement and I have never seen something come together so fast.&quot;

Chayefsky decided to write a serious film on the American scientific community and the archetypal man in his search for his true self. A producer at Columbia Pictures, Daniel Melnick, suggested that Chayefsky turn a treatment he had written into a novel first, and he agreed. He did extensive research with scientists and anthropologists. The novel was published in early 1978. As was the case with his previous films, Chayefsky was granted full creative control over the film version of &quot;Altered States&quot;.

Film rights were sold to Melnick, who had greenlit &quot;Network&quot; while the head of production at MGM, and who had a deal with Columbia.
In April 1978, Chayefsky turned in his script to Columbia. In June 1978, Melnick became the head of production at Columbia, but under his deal, he was still allowed to produce &quot;Altered States&quot;. Melnick wound up resigning in October, taking &quot;Altered States&quot; with him.

===Production===
For the final transformation sequence a computer-assisted rotoscope system was created, which produced smooth movements without jitter or objectionable outline. The glow and particles were made on a computer. The frames were first manually traced with an electronic pen and transferred to a tablet. For more complex scenes a high-resolution scanner was used. When finished, a digital plotter would draw the frames in black and white on frosted mylar animation cels. The cels were then photographed on a computer-controlled animation stand. An optical printer added the colors, requiring multiple passes with color filtration and separate mattes.

===Casting===
The film&#x27;s original director was Arthur Penn. He cast the movie, including the relatively unknown leads William Hurt (in his first movie) and Blair Brown. At one point, Scott Glenn was a contender for the male lead. Another key role went to Bob Balaban. Miguel Godreau, a dancer and teacher with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, was cast as Jessup&#x27;s caveman incarnation.

===Change of director===
Filming was to begin in November 1978. However, during rehearsals Penn resigned after a dispute with Chayefsky. Penn later recalled that the only way he could leave the project and get paid for his work was to be fired. But he and Chayefsky remained friends thereafter.

The eventual director was Ken Russell, who had struggled to find feature film work since the box office failure of &quot;Valentino&quot; (1977). Russell later recalled that &quot;they wanted a director who has a very visual imagination, and they knew I had that.&quot;

Russell later said his agent told him directors who had turned down the project included Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, Sydney Pollack, Robert Wise, and Orson Welles. He says his agent told him he was the twenty-seventh choice. Filming was then set to begin in March 1979 for Columbia with Howard Gottfried as producer. The film would eventually be done for Warner Bros, in part because the cost rose from an original budgeted $9 million to $12.5 million. It would eventually come in at just under $15 million, with $4 million of that going on special effects.

Russell later replaced special effects expert John Dykstra with Bran Ferren, who is credited for Special Visual Effects in the front titles, and created the VFX actually used in the film. Dick Smith worked on the groundbreaking special makeup effects, which made extensive use of his pioneering air bladder technique.

It was the first time Russell had made a film in Hollywood. He later said, &quot;I thought I would hate Hollywood, but I rather liked it. Everyone there is supposed to be terribly materialistic, but &quot;Altered States&quot; was the first movie I ever worked on where nobody—not Warner Bros., not Dan Melnick, the executive producer, or Howard Gottfried, the producer—ever mentioned money.&quot;

===Locations===
The film was shot at Sunset Gower Studios, Burbank Studios, Boston, and New York City. On-location filming locations included Harvard Medical School, Beacon Hill, Logan International Airport, Columbia University, the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic, and the Bronx Zoo. Additionally, scenes set in Mexico were filmed on location in Creel, Chihuahua, and included real-life footage of Tarahumara people collecting psychotropic mushrooms.

===Conflict between Russell and Chayefsky===
There were three weeks of rehearsals in March 1979, during which Chayefsky and Russell had a massive dispute. The writer left the project and did not appear on set during filming, contrary to his normal practice.

Dave Itzkoff&#x27;s book on Chayefsky, &quot;Mad as Hell: The Making of NETWORK and the Fateful Vision of the Angriest Man in Movies&quot;, chronicles the making of &quot;Altered States&quot; and claims that Russell, objecting to Chayefsky&#x27;s interference, had the writer banned from the set. Chayefsky reportedly tried to have Russell removed as director, but by then the film was already well under way, and the studio already had replaced one director (Penn). The film&#x27;s producer, Howard Gottfried, told Chayefsky&#x27;s biographer Shaun Considine that Russell was polite and deferential prior to production but after rehearsals began in 1979 &quot;began to treat Paddy as a nonentity&quot; and was &quot;mean and sarcastic.&quot; Chayefsky called Russell a &quot;duplicitous, mean man.&quot;

Russell said Chayefsky &quot;didn&#x27;t like the color of the paint on the isolation tank. Then it went on to other things. He didn&#x27;t like the lighting, then he didn&#x27;t like the machinery, then he thought I was making the actors appear drunk in a scene where they were written to be slightly tipsy in a bar ... There was a lot of embarrassing dialogue, and there was a hell of a lot more in the original script than there is now; it was a verbose script.&quot; &quot;I couldn&#x27;t work with someone else judging everything I did,&quot; said the director. &quot;Chayefsky told me, &#x27;I&#x27;ll just be on the set as a benign influence.&#x27; The producer said, &#x27;How do you spell benign, Paddy?&#x27; He answered, &#x27;W-I-C-K-E-D&#x27;. He was joking but he wasn&#x27;t joking.&quot; An unnamed source close to the film later opined that &quot;two strong artists were jockeying for control and, at a given point, a movie becomes a director&#x27;s movie. You can&#x27;t stand over his shoulder. You either support him or fire him.&quot;

&quot;Paddy&#x27;s hallucinations were impossible to film,&quot; said Russell in another interview. &quot;He&#x27;d write a direction, something like &#x27;Interstellar gas shot through 5 million miles of universe like a puff of cigarette smoke.&#x27; But when I read the script, I realized the picture would only succeed to the extent that it dramatized a certain experience common to all men. And that experience isn&#x27;t gas going through the universe.&quot; Russell added, &quot;there is a great deal of dialogue in &#x27;Altered States,&#x27; and as I saw it, my task was to make those scenes as visually interesting as possible so they wouldn&#x27;t be swallowed up by the special effects.&quot; Russell admitted he did not &quot;shoot scenes as he was used to having them shot in other movies he has been involved in. I try to avoid the covering shot, long shot, close-up technique. Instead, I try for long, fluid sequences.&quot; The director said he felt Chayefsky had never &quot;been involved with a director who wasn&#x27;t malleable. He would make suggestions, and I would listen courteously, and then disagree. &#x27;I can&#x27;t use your eyes,&#x27; I told him. &#x27;I&#x27;ve got to use my own. In any case, there can be only one director on a picture.&quot;

===Chayefsky disavowal of film===
Chayefsky later withdrew his name from the project, so the screenplay is credited to the pseudonymous Sidney Aaron. Film critic Janet Maslin, in her review of the film, thought it &quot;easy to guess why&quot;:

It&#x27;s easy to guess why [screenwriter Chayefsky] and [director Ken Russell] didn&#x27;t see eye to eye. The direction, without being mocking or campy, treats outlandish material so matter-of-factly that it often has a facetious ring. The screenplay, on the other hand, cries out to be taken seriously, as it addresses, with no particular sagacity, the death of God and the origins of man.

Film critic Richard Corliss attributed Chayefsky&#x27;s disavowal of the film to distress over &quot;the intensity of the performances and the headlong pace at which the actors read his dialogue.&quot;

Russell maintained that he changed almost nothing in Chayefsky&#x27;s script. &quot;We shot every word that Paddy wrote except for some trifling changes in the Mexican sequences,&quot; said Russell. &quot;In fact, I was more faithful to the script in &#x27;Altered States&#x27; than in any previous movie, and I think I did it great justice.&quot; &quot;We&#x27;re saying every word exactly as he wrote it,&quot; said Brown during filming. &quot;I suppose the truth is he [Chayefsky] and Ken are such different personalities they found it impossible to work together.&quot;

According to screenwriter Joe Eszterhas, Chayefsky had a clause in his contract stipulating that the words in the script could not be changed. Russell, &quot;at the height of his alcoholism&quot;, was rebuffed when attempting to change the words, and then &quot;began purposely trying to destroy Paddy&#x27;s dialogue by having the actors eat while they were delivering it, or having them deliver it in a staccato, machine-gun kind of style, so that you couldn&#x27;t make out what they were saying.&quot; Eszterhas considered the direction of Russell to have &quot;destroyed&quot; the script and film, which was ultimately &quot;a critical and commercial failure [...] a heartbreaking experience for Chayefsky, who had fought for decades against that, and for protecting his material. It was such a heartbreaking experience that he died shortly afterwards, some say from a broken heart.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Altered States&quot; began a limited theatrical release in New York and Los Angeles, California, on December 25, 1980. It received a nationwide theatrical release in the United States in February 1981 by Warner Bros.

==Reception and legacy==
===Box office===
&quot;Altered States&quot; grossed $19.9million in the United States and Canada, against a production budget of $15million.

===Critical response===
 
The initial reviews were generally strong. &quot;It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve gotten the acclaim I&#x27;ve gotten on &quot;Altered States&quot;,&quot; said Russell.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; termed the film a &quot;methodically paced fireworks display, exploding into delirious special-effects sequences at regular intervals, and maintaining an eerie calm the rest of the time. If it is not wholly visionary at every juncture, it is at least dependably—even exhilaratingly—bizarre. Its strangeness, which borders cheerfully on the ridiculous, is its most enjoyable feature.&quot; She also called it &quot;in fine shape as long as it revels in its own craziness, making no claims on the viewer&#x27;s reason. But when it asks you to believe that what you&#x27;re watching may really be happening, and to wonder what it means, it is asking far too much. By the time it begins straining for an ending both happy and hysterical, it has lost all of its mystery, and most of its magic.&quot;

Richard Corliss began his review of the film:

Corliss calls the film a &quot;dazzling piece of science fiction&quot;; he recognizes the film&#x27;s dialogue as clearly Chayefsky&#x27;s, with characters that are &quot;endlessly reflective and articulate, spitting out litanies of adjectives, geysers of abstract nouns, chemical chains of relative clauses&quot;, dialogue that&#x27;s a &quot;welcome antidote to all those recent...movies in which brutal characters speak only words of one syllable and four letters.&quot; But the film is ultimately Russell&#x27;s, who inherited a &quot;cast of unknowns&quot; chosen by its original director and &quot;gets an erotic, neurotic charge from the talking-heads scenes that recall Penn at his best.&quot;

Pauline Kael, on the other hand, wrote that the &quot;grotesquely inspired&quot; combination of &quot;Russell, with his show-biz-Catholic glitz mysticism, and Chayefsky, with his show-biz-Jewish ponderousness&quot; results in an &quot;aggressively silly picture&quot; that &quot;isn&#x27;t really enjoyable.&quot;

John C. Lilly liked the film, and noted the following in an &quot;Omni&quot; magazine interview published in January 1983:

The scene in which the scientist becomes cosmic energy and his wife grabs him and brings him back to human form is straight out of my &quot;Dyadic Cyclone&quot; (1976) ... As for the scientist&#x27;s regression into an ape-like being, the late Dr. Craig Enright, who started me on K (ketamine) while taking a trip with me here by the isolation tank, suddenly &quot;became&quot; a chimp, jumping up and down and hollering for twenty-five minutes. Watching him, I was frightened. I asked him later, &quot;Where the hell were you?&quot; He said, &quot;I became a pre-hominid, and I was in a tree. A leopard was trying to get me. So I was trying to scare him away.&quot; The manuscript of &quot;The Scientist&quot; (1978) was in the hands of Bantam, the publishers. The head of Bantam called and said, &quot;Paddy Chayefsky would like to read your manuscript. Will you give him your permission?&quot; I said, &quot;Only if he calls me and asks permission.&quot; He didn&#x27;t call. But he probably read the manuscript.

Christopher John reviewed &quot;Altered States&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #6 and commented that &quot;Simply put, &quot;Altered States&quot; is very good at what it proposes to do – luckily it proposed to do very little.&quot;

In &quot;Ready for My Close-Up!: Great Movie Speeches&quot; (2007), screenwriter Denny Martin Flinn called Chayefsky&#x27;s screenplay &quot;brilliant&quot; and selected Emily&#x27;s speech as &quot;Chayefsky&#x27;s last great take on life and love.&quot;

In 2023, Christian Zilko of &quot;IndieWire&quot; included the film in a list of &quot;the 20 best body horror movies&quot;, and wrote that, &quot;The film&#x27;s psychedelic scenes are visual marvels in and of themselves, and a strong early career performance by William Hurt (in his first film role) ensures that &quot;Altered States&quot; is still highly watchable four decades after its release&quot;.

According to &quot;TV Guide&quot;, Basil Dearden&#x27;s 1963 film &quot;The Mind Benders&quot; &quot;is the direct predecessor of &quot;Altered States&quot;.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for two Academy Awards:
* Academy Award for Best Original Score – John Corigliano
* Academy Award for Best Sound – Arthur Piantadosi, Les Fresholtz, Michael Minkler and Willie D. Burton

<doc id="350633" wikidata="Q1161258" url="?curid=350633" title="Mount Robson">
<text>Mount Robson is the most prominent mountain in North America&#x27;s Rocky Mountain range; it is also the highest point in the Canadian Rockies. 
The mountain is located entirely within Mount Robson Provincial Park of British Columbia, and is part of the Rainbow Range. 
Mount Robson is the second highest peak entirely in British Columbia, behind Mount Waddington in the Coast Range. 
The south face of Mount Robson is clearly visible from the Yellowhead Highway (Highway 16), and is commonly photographed along this route.

Mount Robson was likely named after Colin Robertson, who worked for both the North West Company and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company at various times in the early 19th century, though there was confusion over the name as many assumed it to have been named for John Robson, an early premier of British Columbia. 
The Texqa’kallt, a Secwepemc people and the earliest known inhabitants of the area, call it (striped rock), spelled in Dawson 1891 as , &quot;The Mountain of the Spiral Road&quot;.
Other unofficial names include Cloud Cap Mountain.
==Geography and climate==

Mount Robson boasts great vertical relief over the local terrain. From Kinney Lake, the south-west side of the mountain rises to the summit. 
The north face of Mount Robson is heavily glaciated and of ice extends from the summit to the Berg Glacier.

The north face can be seen from Berg Lake, and reached by a hike. The lake is approximately 2 km long and lies at elevation. There are backcountry campgrounds at each end of the lake and a log shelter on its banks, named Hargreaves Shelter in honor of the Hargreaves family who operated the Mount Robson Ranch across the Fraser River from the mountain and who outfitted most of the early trips into Berg Lake. The Berg Glacier calves directly into the lake. The Robson Glacier, which fills the cirque and valley between Mount Robson and Mount Resplendent, in the early 1900s fed directly into both Berg lake and Adolphus Lake, straddling the Continental Divide and draining thus to both the Arctic and Pacific oceans via the Smoky and Robson Rivers, respectively. 
It since has receded more than 2 kilometres and is the source of the Robson River only. 
The peak of Mount Robson has a tundra climate (ET).

== History ==

In 1893, 5 years after the expedition of A.P. Coleman to Athabasca Pass and the final settling of the mistaken elevations of Mount Hooker and Mount Brown, Mount Robson was first surveyed by James McEvoy and determined to be the highest peak in the Canadian Rockies. 
The first documented ascent of Mount Robson, led by the young guide Conrad Kain, at its time the hardest ice face to be climbed on the continent, was achieved during the 1913 annual expedition organized by a large party of Alpine Club of Canada members who made use of the newly completed Grand Trunk Pacific railway to access the area. 
Prior to 1913, it had been necessary to approach the mountain by pack train from Edmonton or Laggan via Jasper and Lucerne, so only a few intrepid explorers had made previous attempts at exploring the mountain. 
The most famous early ascensionist was George Kinney, a founding member of the Alpine Club, who on his twelfth attempt in August 1909 claimed to have reached the summit with local outfitter Donald &quot;Curly&quot; Phillips. 
A major controversy over this claim and over the implausible nature of his unlikely and dangerous route dominated the discourse within the Alpine Club elite, and he is now generally presumed to have reached the high summit ridge before being turned back at the final ice dome of the peak. Kinney Lake, below the south face, is named in his honour.

==Climbing==

The Emperor Face on the northwest side provides the most formidable challenge to elite climbers on the mountain, though the more popular routes are the Kain route and the southeast face. 
The Kain route follows the first ascent&#x27;s path up the entire length of the Robson Glacier from its terminus above Robson Pass to the upper northeast face and the summit ridge. 
Mount Robson has a high failure rate on climbing to the top, with only about 10% of attempts being successful. 
Although the mountain is under , there is no easy way to the summit and bad weather commonly rebuffs summit attempts. 

The main routes on Mount Robson include:
* South Face (Normal Route) IV
* Kain Face IV (named after Conrad Kain)
* Wishbone Arete IV 5.6
* Emperor Ridge V 5.6
* Emperor Face, Stump/Logan VI 5.9 A2
* Emperor Face, Cheesmond/Dick VI 5.9 A2
* Emperor Face, Infinite Patience VI WI5 M5 5.9
* Emperor Face, House-Haley M7
* North Face IV
* Fuhrer Ridge IV 5.4

<doc id="350635" wikidata="Q632874" url="?curid=350635" title="Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin">
<text>Count Alexey Petrovich Bestuzhev-Ryumin (; 1 June 1693 – 21 April 1766) was a Russian diplomat and chancellor. He was one of the most influential and successful diplomats in 18th-century Europe. As the chancellor of the Russian Empire was chiefly responsible for Russian foreign policy during the reign of Empress Elizaveta Petrovna.

==Early life and career==
Alexey was born at Moscow to an old noble family of Novgorod descent. His father, Pyotr Bestuzhev-Ryumin, was Novgorod governor and a confidant of Empress Anna Ioannova. Later, he became the Russian ambassador to the duchy of Courland. Educated abroad with his elder brother, Mikhail, at Copenhagen and Berlin, Alexey especially distinguished himself in languages and the applied sciences.

In 1712, Peter the Great attached Bestuzhev to Prince Kurakin at the Utrecht Congress, that he might learn diplomacy and, for the same reason, permitted him in 1713 to enter the service of the elector of Hanover. The elector, who became King George I of Great Britain, took him to London in 1714 and sent him to Saint Petersburg as his accredited minister with a notification of his accession. Bestuzhev then returned to England, where he remained four years. That period laid the necessary groundwork for his brilliant diplomatic career.

Bestuzhev curiously illustrated his passion for intrigue in a letter to Tsarevich Alexey Petrovich at Vienna, assuring his &quot;future sovereign&quot; of his devotion and representing his sojourn in England as the deliberate seclusion of a zealous but powerless well wisher. That extraordinary indiscretion might well have cost him his life, but the tsarevich destroyed the letter. (A copy of the letter, taken by way of precaution beforehand by the Austrian ministers, survived in the Vienna archives.)

On his return to Russia, Bestuzhev served for two years without any salary as chief gentleman of the Bedchamber at the court of Anne of Courland. In 1721, he succeeded Vasily Dolgorukov as Russian minister at Copenhagen. The city then formed a nexus of diplomatic intrigue, as George I of Great Britain had the aim of arming the northern powers against Peter the Great, and Bestuzhev received the commission to counteract that.

On the occasion of the Treaty of Nystad (1721), which terminated the Great Northern War&#x27;s 21 years of struggle between Russia and Sweden, Bestuzhev designed and had minted a commemorative medal with a panegyrical Latin inscription, which so delighted Peter, then at Derbent, that he sent a letter of thanks written in his own hand along with his portrait.

The sudden death of Peter the Great (8 February 1725) seriously injured Bestuzhev&#x27;s prospects. For more than ten years, he remained at Copenhagen, looking vainly towards Russia as a sort of promised land from which he was excluded by enemies or rivals. He rendered some important services, however, to Empress Anne (reigned 1730–1740), who decorated him and made him a privy councillor. He also won the favour of Ernst von Biren, and on the tragic fall of Artemy Petrovich Volynsky in 1739, Bestuzhev returned to Russia to take Volynsky&#x27;s place in the council. He assisted Biren to obtain the regency in the last days of Anne, but when his patron fell three weeks later (November 1740), his own position became precarious.

==Grand Chancellor of the Russian Empire==
Bestuzhev&#x27;s chance came when Empress Elizabeth, immediately after her accession (6 December 1741), summoned him back to court and appointed him vice-chancellor. For the next 20 years, during a period of exceptional difficulty, Bestuzhev practically controlled the foreign policy of Russia.

At the time, Bestuzhev judged France the natural enemy of Russia. The interests of the two states in the Ottoman Empire, Poland and Sweden were diametrically opposed, and Bestuzhev considered that Russia needed to fear the intrigues of France in all three countries, all of which bordered Russia. The enemies of France thus necessarily became the friends of Russia, and its friends were conversely viewed as Russia&#x27;s enemies. Consequently, Great Britain and Austria became Russia&#x27;s &quot;natural&quot; allies, and the aggressive and energetic King Frederick II of Prussia, then engaged in the Silesian Wars and allied with France in the War of the Austrian Succession, presented a danger to be guard. Bestuzhev therefore adopted the policy of bringing about a quadruple alliance of Russia, Austria, Britain and Saxony, to counteract the Franco-Prussian league. However, he stood on dangerous ground. Empress Elizabeth herself had an aversion to an alliance with Britain and with Austria, whose representatives had striven to prevent her accession. Many of her personal friends, in the pay of France and Prussia, took part in innumerable conspiracies to overthrow Bestuzhev. Despite those hindrances, Bestuzhev, aided by his elder brother, Mikhail, implemented his policy step by step.

Russia and Sweden had commenced hostilities in 1741. On 11 December 1742 Bestuzhev concluded a defensive alliance between Britain and Russia. He had previously rejected with scorn French proposals to mediate between Russia and Sweden on the basis of a territorial surrender on the part of the former. Bestuzhev conducted the war so vigorously that by the end of 1742, Sweden lay at the mercy of Russia. During the negotiations for the Treaty of Åbo (January to August 1743) Bestuzhev insisted for Sweden to cede the whole of Finland to Russia, thus completing the work of Peter the Great. However, the French contrived to get better terms for Sweden by artfully appealing to Empress Elizabeth&#x27;s fondness for the House of Holstein. The Swedes, with the encouragement of Elizabeth, accepted Adolphus Frederick, Duke of Holstein, as their future king, and, in return, received Finland again, with the exception of a small strip of land up to the Kymmene River.

Bestuzhev could not prevent the signing of a Russo-Prussian defensive alliance in March 1743 but deprived it of all political significance by excluding the proposed guarantee of Frederick&#x27;s conquests from the First Silesian War. Moreover Bestuzhev&#x27;s efforts made the standing of the Prussian king, whom he regarded as even more dangerous than France, at the Russian court fell steadily, and the vice-chancellor prepared the way for an alliance with Austria by agreeing on 1 November 1743 to the Treaty of Breslau of 11 June 1742.

The bogus Lopukhina Conspiracy, however, put in place by the Holstein faction and aided by France and Prussia, persuaded Elizabeth that the Austrian ambassador had intrigued to restore Ivan VI to the throne and alienated her from Austria for a time. Bestuzhev&#x27;s ruin appeared certain when, in 1743, a French agent, Jacques-Joachim Trotti, marquis de la Chétardie, arrived to reinforce his enemies. However, Bestuzhev found a friend in need in Mikhail Illarionovich Vorontsov, the empress&#x27;s confidant, who shared his political views. Still, his position remained most delicate, especially when the betrothal between Grand-Duke Peter and Sophia of Anhalt-Zerbst (later Catherine II) took place against his will, and Elizabeth of Holstein, the mother of the bride, arrived to promote Prussian interests. Frederick II, conscious of the instability of his French ally, now keenly wished to contract an offensive alliance with Russia. The first step to realizing that plan required the overthrow of Bestuzhev, &quot;upon whom&quot;, Frederick II wrote to his minister Axel von Mardefeld, &quot;the fate of Prussia and my own house depends&quot;. However, Bestuzhev succeeded, at last, in convincing the empress of Chétardie&#x27;s dangerous intrigues, and on 6 June 1744, Chétardie received orders to quit Russia within twenty-four hours. Five weeks later, Bestuzhev became grand chancellor (15 July 1744). Before the end of the year, Elizabeth of Holstein also was expelled from Russia, and Bestuzhev remained supreme.

==Anti-Prussian coalition==
European diplomacy then focused on the king of Prussia, whose apparently insatiable acquisitiveness disturbed all his neighbours. Bestuzhev&#x27;s offer, communicated to the British government at the end of 1745, to attack Prussia if Britain would guarantee subsidies to the amount of some £6,000,000, carried no weight now that Austria and Prussia had started coming to terms. Then, Bestuzhev turned to Austria and, on 22 May 1746, concluded an offensive and defensive alliance between both powers that was manifestly directed against Prussia. In 1747, he also signed alliances with Denmark and the Porte. At the same time, Bestuzhev resisted any rapprochement with France and severely rebuked the court of Saxony for its intrigues with the French court in Versailles.

He then felt hampered by the persistent opposition of the vice-chancellor Mikhail Vorontsov, formerly his friend but now his jealous rival, whom Frederick the Great secretly supported. In 1748, however, Bestuzhev was able to have Vorontsov removed by proving to the empress that Vorontsov had received money from Prussia.

The hour of Bestuzhev&#x27;s triumph coincided with the peace congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (April to October 1748), which altered the whole situation of European politics and introduced fresh combinations, the breaking away of Prussia from France and a rapprochement between Britain and Prussia, with the inevitable corollary of an alliance between France and the enemies of Prussia.

Bestuzhev&#x27;s strong political prejudices, at first, prevented him from properly recognising that change. Passion had always been too large an ingredient in his diplomacy. His Anglomania also misled him. His enemies, headed by his elder brother, Mikhail and the vice-chancellor Vorontsov, were powerless while his diplomacy seemed faultless but quickly took advantage of his mistakes. When the Anglo-Prussian and Franco-Austrian Alliances were formed in the first half of 1756, Vorontsov advocated the accession of Russia to the latter, but Bestuzhev insisted on a treaty with Britain. However, his influence had started to wane. The totally unexpected Anglo-Prussian alliance had justified the arguments of his enemies that Britain seemed impossible to deal with, while his hatred of France prevented him from adopting the only alternative of an alliance.

To counter the covert intrigues against him, Bestuzhev now proposed the erection of a council of ministers to settle all important affairs, and its first session (14–30 March 1756) proposed an alliance with Austria, France and Poland against Frederick II, but Bestuzhev opposed any arrangement with France. He endeavoured to counteract his failing influence by a secret alliance with Grand-Duchess Catherine, whom he proposed to raise to the throne instead of her Holstein husband, Peter, from whom Bestuzhev expected nothing good either for himself or for Russia. He conducted negotiations through Stanisław August Poniatowski and then the Russian ambassador of Saxony, later Stanisław II of Poland.

The inclusion of Russia in the anti-Prussian coalition (1756) in the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763) occurred over Bestuzhev&#x27;s head, and the cowardice and incapacity of his friend, the Russian commander-in-chief, Stepan Fyodorovich Apraksin, after winning the Battle of Gross-Jägersdorf (30 August 1757), became the pretext for overthrowing the chancellor. His unwillingness to agree to the coalition became magnified in opposition accounts into a determination to defeat it although his opponents never proved anything against him.

Nevertheless, he lost the chancellorship and suffered banishment to his estate at Goretovo (April 1759), where he remained until the accession of Catherine II (28 June 1762). Catherine recalled him to court and made him a field marshal. However, he took no leading part in affairs and died on 21 April 1766 in Saint Petersburg.

<text>Vladimír Menšík (9 October 1929 – 29 May 1988) was a Czech actor and entertainer. He is considered one of the greatest Czech comedians, storytellers and improvisers.

==Life==
Vladimír Menšík was born on 9 October 1929 in Ivančice, Czechoslovakia as Vladislav Menšík. The year 1924 was listed during his lifetime, after Menšík falsified his documents for fun. He also once stated that he did it so he could &quot;retire early&quot;. The fraud was discovered in 1988, shortly before his death.

Despite suffering from asthma, he was a keen athlete and played handball competitively. In 1949, he graduated from the secondary mechanical engineering school in Brno. In 1953, he graduated from the Janáček Academy of Performing Arts in Brno. He learned to sing and to play the clarinet, piano and mandolin. He then moved to Prague and started working in theaters there. In 1954–1958, he played in E. F. Burian Theatre and was a guest in other theatres. Because he did not enjoy performing on a daily basis, he then left the theatre and became a member of the acting ensemble of the Barrandov Film Studio.

Menšík was married twice. He had two children with each of his wives.

He died in a hospital in Brno on 29 May 1988, at the age of 58. The cause of his death was asthma combined with his lifestyle – he was a heavy smoker and had problems with alcoholism. He is buried in the Olšany Cemetery in Prague.

==Career==
Both comedian and serious actor, he created a wide range of lively characters. He starred in more than 150 roles in movies, TV films and TV series. He is considered one of the best Czech comedians and improvisers in history and a brilliant storyteller. In addition to acting in films, he became famous as a guest of entertainment shows and live performances.

<text>Hürrem Sultan (; , &quot;&quot;the joyful one&quot;; 1504 – 15 April 1558), also known as Roxelana (), was the chief consort, the first Haseki Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and the legal wife of the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, and the mother of Suleiman&#x27;s successor Selim II. She became one of the most powerful and influential women in Ottoman history, and as well a prominent figure during the period known as the Sultanate of Women. 

Born in Ruthenia (then an eastern region of the Kingdom of Poland, now Rohatyn, Ukraine) to a Ruthenian Orthodox family, she was captured by Crimean Tatars during a slave raid and eventually taken via the Crimean trade to Constantinople, the Ottoman capital.

She entered the Imperial Harem where her name was changed to Hürrem, rose through the ranks and became the favourite concubine of Sultan Suleiman. Breaking Ottoman tradition, he married Hürrem, making her his legal wife. Sultans had previously married only foreign freeborn noblewomen. She was the first imperial consort to receive the title, created for her, &quot;Haseki Sultan&quot;. Hürrem remained in the sultan&#x27;s court for the rest of her life, enjoying a close relationship with her husband, and having six children with him, including the future sultan, Selim II, which makes Hürrem an ancestor of all following sultans and currently living members of the Ottoman dynasty. Of Hürrem&#x27;s six children, five were male, breaking the Ottoman custom according to which each concubine could only give the Sultan one male child, to maintain a balance of power between the various consorts. However, not only did Hürrem bear more children to the sultan after the birth of her first son in 1521, but she was also the mother of all of Suleiman&#x27;s children born after her entry into the harem at the beginning of his reign.

Hürrem eventually achieved power, influencing the politics of the Ottoman Empire. Through her husband, she played an active role in affairs of the state. She probably acted as the sultan&#x27;s advisor, wrote diplomatic letters to Sigismund II Augustus King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania (). Hürrem patronized major public works (including the Haseki Sultan Complex and the Hurrem Sultan Bathhouse). She died in 1558, in Constantinople and was buried in a mausoleum within the Süleymaniye Mosque complex.

==Names==
Leslie P. Peirce has written that her birth name may have been either &quot;Aleksandra&quot; or &quot;Anastazja&quot; &quot;Lisowska&quot;. Among the Ottomans, she was known mainly as Haseki Hürrem Sultan or Hürrem Haseki Sultan. &quot;Hürrem&quot; or &quot;Khurrem&quot; () means &quot;the joyful one&quot;&quot; in Persian. The name &quot;Roxalane&quot; derives from &quot;Roksolanes&quot;, which was the generic term used by the Ottomans to describe girls from Podolia and Galicia who were taken in slave raids.

==Origin==
Sources are mostly in agreement to indicate that Hürrem was originally from Ruthenia, which was then part of the Polish Crown. She was born in the town of Rohatyn southeast of Lwów (Lviv), a major city of the Ruthenian Voivodeship of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, in what is now Ukraine. Her native language was Ruthenian, the precursor to modern Ukrainian. According to late 16th-century and early 17th-century sources, such as the Polish poet Samuel Twardowski (died 1661), who researched the subject in Turkey, Hürrem was seemingly born to a man named Hawrylo Lisovski, who was an Orthodox priest of Ruthenian origin, and his wife Leksandra.

During the reign of Selim I, which was some time between 1512 and 1520, Crimean Tatars kidnapped her during one of their Crimean–Nogai slave raids in Eastern Europe. The Tatars may have first taken her to the Crimean city of Kaffa, a major centre of the Ottoman slave trade, before she was taken to Constantinople. Shaykh Qutb al-Din al-Nahrawali, a Meccan religious figure, who visited Constantinople in 1558, noted in his memoirs that she had been a servant in the household of Hançerli Hanzade Fatma Zeynep Sultan, daughter of Şehzade Mahmud, one of the sons of Sultan Bayezid II, who gifted her to Suleiman when he rose to the throne.

In Constantinople, Hafsa Sultan, mother of Suleiman, selected Hürrem as a gift for her son. Other versions claim that it was Suleiman&#x27;s confidant and future Grand Vizier Ibrahim Pasha who introduced Hürrem into his harem. Hürrem later managed to become the first &quot;Haseki Sultan&quot; of the Ottoman imperial harem. Michalo Lituanus wrote in the 16th century that &quot;the most beloved wife of the present Turkish emperor – mother of his first [son] who will govern after him, was kidnapped from our land&quot;.

European ambassadors of that period called her Roxelana, meaning &quot;Ruthenian woman&quot; or &quot;the Ruthenian one&quot; for her alleged Ruthenian origins. She is the sultan&#x27;s consort with the most portraits in her name in the Ottoman Empire, though the portraits are imaginary depictions by painters.

==Relationship with Suleiman==
Hürrem Sultan probably entered the harem around sixteen years of age. The precise year that she entered the harem is unknown, but it&#x27;s believed that she became Suleiman&#x27;s concubine around the time he became sultan in 1520, because their first child was born in 1521.

Hürrem&#x27;s unprecedented rise from harem slave to Suleiman&#x27;s legal wife attracted jealousy and disfavor not only from her rivals in the harem, but also from the general populace. She soon became Suleiman&#x27;s most prominent consort beside Gülbahar Mahidevran Hatun and their relationship was monogamous. While the exact dates for the births of her children are disputed, there is academic consensus that the births of her first five children —Şehzade Mehmed, Mihrimah Sultan, Selim II, Şehzade Abdullah and Şehzade Bayezid – occurred quickly over the next five to six years. Suleiman and Hürrem&#x27;s last child, Şehzade Cihangir was born later, in 1531, but by that time Hürrem had given birth to enough healthy sons to secure the future of the Ottoman dynasty.

Hürrem was allowed to give birth to more than one son which was a stark violation of the old imperial harem principle, &quot;one concubine mother – one son,&quot; which was designed to prevent both the mother&#x27;s influence over the sultan and the feuds of the blood brothers for the throne. She was to bear the majority of Suleiman&#x27;s children. Hürrem gave birth to her first son Mehmed in 1521 (who died in 1543) and then to four more sons, destroying Mahidevran&#x27;s status as the mother of the sultan&#x27;s only surviving son.

Suleiman&#x27;s mother, Hafsa Sultan, partially suppressed the rivalry between the two women. According to Bernardo Navagero&#x27;s report, as a result of the bitter rivalry a fight between the two women broke out, with Mahidevran beating Hürrem, which angered Suleiman. According to Necdet Sakaoğlu, a Turkish historian, these accusations were not truthful. After the death of Suleiman&#x27;s mother Hafsa Sultan in 1534, Hürrem&#x27;s influence in the palace increased, and she took over the ruling of the harem. Hürrem became the only partner of the ruler and received the title of Haseki, which means the favorite. When Suleiman freed and married her, or in the years before, she became the Haseki Sultan (adding the word sultan to a woman&#x27;s name or title indicated that she was a part of the dynasty).

Around 1533, Suleiman married Hürrem in a magnificent formal ceremony. Never before had a former slave been elevated to the status of the sultan&#x27;s lawful spouse, a development which astonished observers in the palace and in the city. The wedding celebration took place in 1534.

Hürrem became the first consort to receive the title &quot;Haseki Sultan&quot;. This title, used for a century, reflected the great power of imperial consorts (most of them were former slaves) in the Ottoman court, elevating their status higher than Ottoman princesses. In this case, Suleiman not only broke the old custom, but began a new tradition for the future Ottoman sultans: to marry in a formal ceremony and to give their consorts significant influence on the court, especially in matters of succession. Hürrem&#x27;s salary was 2,000 akçe a day, making her one of the highest-paid Ottoman Imperial women. After the wedding, the idea circulated that the sultan had limited his autonomy and was dominated and controlled by his wife. Also, in Ottoman society, mothers played more influential roles in their sons&#x27; educations and in guiding their careers.

After the death of Suleiman&#x27;s mother, Hafsa Sultan, in 1534, Hürrem became Suleiman&#x27;s most trusted news source. In one of her letters to Suleiman, she informs him about the situation of the plague in the capital. She wrote, &quot;My dearest Sultan! If you ask about Istanbul, the city still suffers from the plague; however, it is not like the previous one. God willing, it will go away as soon as you return to the city. Our ancestors said that the plague goes away once the trees shed their leaves in autumn.&quot;
Later, Hürrem became the first woman to remain in the sultan&#x27;s court for the duration of her life. In the Ottoman imperial family tradition, a sultan&#x27;s consort was to remain in the harem only until her son came of age (around 16 or 17), after which he would be sent away from the capital to govern a faraway province, and his mother would follow him. This tradition was called &quot;Sancak Beyliği.&quot; The consorts were never to return to Constantinople unless their sons succeeded to the throne. In defiance of this age-old custom, Hürrem stayed behind in the harem, even after her sons went to govern the empire&#x27;s remote provinces.

Moreover, remaining in Constantinople, she moved out of the harem located in the Old Palace (&quot;Eski Saray&quot;) and permanently moved into the Topkapı Palace after a fire destroyed the old harem. Some sources say she moved to Topkapı, not because of the fire, but as a result of her marriage to Suleiman. Either way, this was another significant break from established customs, as Mehmed the Conqueror had specifically issued a decree to the effect that no women would be allowed to reside in the same building where government affairs were conducted. After Hürrem resided at Topkapı it became known as the New Palace (&quot;saray-ı jedid&quot;).

She wrote many love letters to Suleiman when he was away for campaigns. In one of her letters, she wrote:

:&quot;After I put my head on the ground and kiss the soil that your blessed feet step upon, my nation&#x27;s sun and wealth my sultan, if you ask about me, your servant who has caught fire from the zeal of missing you, I am like the one whose liver (in this case, meaning heart) has been broiled; whose chest has been ruined; whose eyes are filled with tears, who cannot distinguish anymore between night and day; who has fallen into the sea of yearning; desperate, mad with your love; in a worse situation than Ferhat and Majnun, this passionate love of yours, your slave, is burning because I have been separated from you. Like a nightingale, whose sighs and cries for help do not cease, I am in such a state due to being away from you. I would pray to Allah to not afflict this pain even upon your enemies. My dearest sultan! As it has been one-and-a-half months since I last heard from you, Allah knows that I have been crying night and day waiting for you to come back home. While I was crying without knowing what to do, the one and only Allah allowed me to receive good news from you. Once I heard the news, Allah knows, I came to life once more since I had died while waiting for you.

Under his pen name, Muhibbi, Sultan Suleiman composed this poem for Hürrem Sultan:
&quot;Throne of my lonely niche, my wealth, my love, my moonlight.
My most sincere friend, my confidant, my very existence, my Sultan, my one and only love.
The most beautiful among the beautiful...
My springtime, my merry faced love, my daytime, my sweetheart, laughing leaf...
My plants, my sweet, my rose, the one only who does not distress me in this world...
My Istanbul, my Karaman, the earth of my Anatolia
My Badakhshan, my Baghdad and Khorasan
My woman of the beautiful hair, my love of the slanted brow, my love of eyes full of mischief...
I&#x27;ll sing your praises always
I, lover of the tormented heart, Muhibbi of the eyes full of tears, I am happy.&quot;
==State affairs==

Historical scholars note that, in the early stages of his reign, Suleiman relied on correspondence, not with Haseki, but with his mother, as Hürrem did not know the language well enough. However, Hürrem corresponded regularly with her husband when he was away after her command of the language increased. 

In her letters to her husband, she conveyed the greetings of the statesmen and the Sheikh-ul-Islam of Istanbul, and talked about the problems in Istanbul. Hürrem was also interested in the statesmen and their problems, and discussed these with Suleiman in her letters and gave him ideas. Hürrem for the first time in Ottoman history, began using the title of &quot;Shah,&quot; which means queen, when she became a legitimate wife. In most reports, her signature appears as &quot;Hürrem Shah&quot;. This expression is seen in the records of the Haseki Hospital and in the inscription of the soup kitchen and hospital in Jerusalem. &quot;&quot;Devletlu İsmetlu Hürrem Shah Sultan Aliyyetü&#x27;ş-şân Hazretleri&quot;.&quot; These expressions are shown as evidence of this event.

Hürrem was one of the most educated women in the world at that time and she played an important role in the political life of the Ottoman Empire. Thanks to her intelligence, she acted as Suleiman&#x27;s chief adviser on matters of state, and seems to have had an influence upon foreign policy and international politics. She freely communicated with the ambassadors of European countries, corresponded with the rulers of Venice and Persia, and stood by Suleiman at receptions and banquets. She imprinted her seal and watched the council meetings through a wire mesh window. With many other revolutionary movements like these, she had started an era in the Ottoman Empire called the &quot;Sultanate of Women&quot;. Hürrem&#x27;s Influence over Suleiman was so significant that rumors circulated around the Ottoman court that the sultan had been bewitched.

Her influence with Suleiman made her one of the most powerful women in Ottoman history and in the world at that time. Even as a consort, her power was comparable with the most powerful woman of the Imperial Harem, who by tradition was the sultan&#x27;s mother or &quot;valide sultan&quot;. Hürrem Sultan was the most powerful Haseki Sultan, because she was the only one who obtained the role and power of a Valide Sultan when she legally married the Sultan. For this reason, she has become a controversial figure in Ottoman history – subject to allegations of plotting against and manipulating her political rivals.

===Controversial figure===

Hürrem&#x27;s influence in state affairs not only made her one of the most influential women, but also a controversial figure in Ottoman history, especially in her rivalry with Mahidevran and her son Şehzade Mustafa, and the grand viziers Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha and Kara Ahmed Pasha.

Hürrem and Mahidevran had given birth to Suleiman&#x27;s six &quot;şehzades&quot; (Ottoman princes): Mustafa, Mehmed, Selim, Abdüllah (died at three), Bayezid, and Cihangir. Of these, Mahidevran&#x27;s son Mustafa was the eldest and preceded Hürrem&#x27;s children in the order of succession. Traditionally, when a new sultan rose to power, he would order all of his brothers killed in order to ensure there was no power struggle. This practice was called &quot;kardeş katliamı&quot;, literally &quot;fraternal massacring&quot;.

Mustafa was supported by Ibrahim Pasha, who became Suleiman&#x27;s grand vizier in 1523. Hürrem has usually been held at least partly responsible for the intrigues in nominating a successor. Since the empire lacked, until the reign of Ahmed I (1603–1617), any formal means of nominating a successor, successions usually involved the death of competing princes in order to avert civil unrest and rebellions. In attempting to avoid the execution of her sons, Hürrem used her influence to eliminate those who supported Mustafa&#x27;s accession to the throne.

A skilled commander of Suleiman&#x27;s army, Ibrahim eventually fell from grace after an imprudence committed during a campaign against the Persian Safavid empire during the Ottoman–Safavid War (1532–55), when he awarded himself a title including the word &quot;Sultan&quot;. Another conflict occurred when Ibrahim and his former mentor, İskender Çelebi, repeatedly clashed over military leadership and positions during the Safavid war. These incidents launched a series of events which culminated in his execution in 1536 by Suleiman&#x27;s order. It is believed that Hürrem&#x27;s influence contributed to Suleiman&#x27;s decision. After three other grand viziers in eight years, Suleiman selected Hürrem&#x27;s son-in-law, Damat Rüstem Pasha, husband of Mihrimah, to become the grand vizier. Scholars have wondered if Hürrem&#x27;s alliance with Mihrimah Sultan and Rüstem Pasha helped secure the throne for one of Hürrem&#x27;s sons.

Many years later, towards the end of Suleiman&#x27;s long reign, the rivalry between his sons became evident. Mustafa was later accused of causing unrest. During the campaign against Safavid Persia in 1553, because of fear of rebellion, Suleiman ordered the execution of Mustafa. According to a source he was executed that very year on charges of planning to dethrone his father; his guilt for the treason of which he was accused remains neither proven nor disproven. It is also rumored that Hürrem Sultan conspired against Mustafa with the help of her daughter and son-in-law Rustem Pasha; they wanted to portray Mustafa as a traitor who secretly contacted the Shah of Iran. Acting on Hürrem Sultan&#x27;s orders, Rustem Pasha had engraved Mustafa&#x27;s seal and sent a letter seemingly written by him to Shah Tahmasb I, and then sent the shah&#x27;s response to Suleiman. After the death of Mustafa, Mahidevran lost her status in the palace as the mother of the heir apparent and moved to Bursa. She did not spend her last years in poverty, as Hürrem&#x27;s son, Selim II, the new sultan after 1566, put her on a lavish salary. Her rehabilitation had been possible after the death of Hürrem in 1558. Cihangir, Hürrem&#x27;s youngest child, allegedly died of grief a few months after of his half-brother&#x27;s murder.

Although the stories about Hürrem&#x27;s role in executions of Ibrahim, Mustafa, and Kara Ahmed are very popular, actually none of them are based on first-hand sources. All other depictions of Hürrem, starting with comments by sixteenth and seventeenth-century Ottoman historians as well as by European diplomats, observers, and travellers, are highly derivative and speculative in nature. Because none of these people – neither Ottomans nor foreign visitors – were permitted into the inner circle of the imperial harem, which was surrounded by multiple walls, they largely relied on the testimony of the servants or courtiers or on the popular gossip circulating around Constantinople.

Even the reports of the Venetian ambassadors (&quot;baili&quot;) at Suleiman&#x27;s court, the most extensive and objective first-hand Western source on Hürrem to date, were often filled with the authors&#x27; own interpretations of the harem rumours. Most other sixteenth-century Western sources on Hürrem, which are considered highly authoritative today – such as &quot;Turcicae epistolae&quot; (English: &quot;The Turkish Letters&quot;) of Ogier de Busbecq, the Emissary of the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I at the Porte between 1554 and 1562; the account of the murder of Şehzade Mustafa by Nicholas de Moffan; the historical chronicles on Turkey by Paolo Giovio; and the travel narrative by Luidgi Bassano – derived from hearsay.

===Foreign policy===
Hürrem acted as Suleiman&#x27;s advisor on matters of state, and seems to have had an influence upon foreign policy and on international politics. Two of her letters to Sigismund II Augustus King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania (reigned 1548–1572) have survived, and during her lifetime the Ottoman Empire generally had peaceful relations with the Polish state within a Polish–Ottoman alliance.

In her first short letter to Sigismund II, Hürrem expresses her highest joy and congratulations to the new king on the occasion of his ascension to the Polish throne after the death of his father Sigismund I the Old in 1548. There was a seal on the back of the letter. For the first and only time in the Ottoman Empire, a female sultan exchanged letters with a king. After that, although Hürrem&#x27;s successor Nurbanu Sultan and her successor Safiye Sultan exchanged letters with queens, there is no other example of a sultana who personally contacted a king other than Hürrem Sultan. She pleads with the King to trust her envoy Hassan Ağa, who verbally delivered another message from her. Some sentences of the letter sent to Warsaw by Haseki Sultan are as follows:

&quot;We learned that you became the king of Poland after your father passed away. Allah knows the truth of everything; we were very happy and pleased. Light came to our hearts, joy and happiness came to our hearts. We wish your reign to be auspicious, fruitful and long-lasting. The command belongs to Allah Almighty; we advise you to act in accordance with the decrees (orders) of Allah Almighty...&quot;

In her second letter to Sigismund Augustus, written in response to his letter, Hürrem expresses in superlative terms her joy at hearing that the king is in good health and that he sends assurances of his sincere friendliness and attachment towards Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. She quotes the sultan as saying, &quot;with the old king we were like brothers, and if it pleases the All-Merciful God, with this king we will be as father and son.&quot; With this letter, Hurrem sent Sigismund II the gift of two pairs of linen shirts and pants, some belts, six handkerchiefs, and a hand-towel, with a promise to send a special linen robe in the future.

There are reasons to believe that these two letters were more than just diplomatic gestures, and that Suleiman&#x27;s references to brotherly or fatherly feelings were not a mere tribute to political expediency. The letters also suggest Hürrem&#x27;s strong desire to establish personal contact with the king. In his 1551 letter to Sigismund II concerning the embassy of Piotr Opaliński, Suleiman wrote that the Ambassador had seen &quot;Your sister and my wife.&quot; Whether this phrase refers to a warm friendship between the Polish-Lithuanian monarch and Ottoman Haseki, or whether it suggests a closer relation, the degree of their intimacy definitely points to a special link between the two states at the time.

Some of her embroideries, or at least made under her supervision, have come down to us, such as those given in 1547 to Tahmasp I Shah of Iran and in 1549 to Sigismund II Augustus King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. Esther Handali acted as her secretary and intermediary on several occasions.

==Charities and Patronage==

Aside from her political concerns, Hürrem engaged in several major works of public buildings, from Makkah to Jerusalem (Al-Quds), perhaps modelling her charitable foundations in part after the caliph Harun al-Rashid&#x27;s consort Zubaida.

Among her first foundations were a mosque, two Quranic schools (&quot;madrassa&quot;), a fountain, and a women&#x27;s hospital near the women&#x27;s slave market (&quot;Avret Pazary&quot;) in Constantinople (Haseki Sultan Complex). It was the first complex constructed in Constantinople by Mimar Sinan in his new position as the chief imperial architect. The mosque was completed in 1538–39, the madrasa was completed a year later in 1539–40 and the soup-kitchen in 1540–41. The hospital was not completed until 1550–51. The fact that it was the third largest building in the capital at that time, only after the Fatih mosque and Suleymaniye Mosque, testifies to Hürrem&#x27;s high status.

She built mosque complexes in Adrianopole and Ankara. She commissioned a bath, the Hurrem Sultan Bathhouse, to serve the community of worshippers in the nearby Hagia Sophia. It was Constructed in 1556 and was designed by Mimar Sinan. The 75-meter-long structure is designed in the style of classical Ottoman baths having two separate symmetrical sections for men and women. The two sections, located in the north-south direction, are on the same axis, which was a novelty in Turkish bath architecture. The men&#x27;s section is to the north while the women&#x27;s section is to the south.

In Jerusalem she established the Haseki Sultan Imaret in 1552, a public soup kitchen to feed the poor, which was said to have fed at least 500 people twice a day. These assets included land in Palestine and Tripoli, as well as shops, public bath houses, soap factories, and flourmills. Haseki Hürrem Sultan&#x27;s endowment deed includes 195 topoynyms and 32 estates mainly along the road between Jaffa and Jerusalem. The Haseki Sultan Imaret not only fulfilled the religious requirement to give charity, but reinforced the social order and helped the Ottoman Empire project a political image of power and generosity. She built a public soup kitchen in Makkah. 

In a foundation charter &quot;(Vakfiye) signed by a judge (Qādī )&quot; and witnesses, not only were the buildings concerned listed, but their long-term maintenance was also ensured. Such documented maintenance could also refer to existing foundations of her own or those of other donors. Hürrem&#x27;s foundation charters from 1540 and 1551 record donations for the maintenance of long-established dervish convents in various Istanbul districts.

She had a &quot;Kira&quot; who acted as her secretary and intermediary on several occasions, although the identity of the kira is uncertain (it may have been Strongilah).

==Death==

Hürrem died on 15 April 1558 due to an unknown illness. In the last years of her life she was in very poor health. It is said that the Sultan, in order not to disturb the peace of his wife during the course of her illness, ordered all the musical instruments in the palace to be burned. He did not leave Hürrem&#x27;s bed until the last day, when she died. The farewell dedications written by the Sultan to Haseki after her death, which have been preserved to the present day, demonstrated Suleiman&#x27;s love for Hürrem.

She was buried in a domed mausoleum (&quot;türbe&quot;) decorated in exquisite Iznik tiles depicting the garden of paradise, perhaps in homage to her smiling and joyful nature. Her mausoleum is adjacent to Suleiman&#x27;s, a more somber, domed structure, at the courtyard of the Süleymaniye Mosque.

==Issue==

With Suleiman, she had five sons and one daughter:
* Şehzade Mehmed (1521, Old Palace, Constantinople – 7 November 1543, Manisa Palace, Manisa, buried in Şehzade Mosque, Constantinople). Hürrem&#x27;s firstborn. He became the sanjak-bey of Manisa and presumptive heir to the throne from 1541 until his death. 
* Mihrimah Sultan (1522, Old Palace, Constantinople – 25 January 1578, Constantinople, buried in Suleiman I Mausoleum, Süleymaniye Mosque). Hürrem&#x27;s only daughter. She was married to Rüstem Pasha, later Ottoman Grand Vizier, on 26 November 1539, and had a daughter and at least a son.
* Selim II (28 May 1524, Old Palace, Constantinople – 15 December 1574, Topkapı Palace, Constantinople, buried in Selim II Mausoleum, Hagia Sophia Mosque). He was sanjak-bey of Karaman, then of Manisa after Mehmed&#x27;s death and later governor of Konya and Kütahya. Suleiman&#x27;s only son that survived after him, he ascended to the throne on 7 September 1566 as Selim II. 
* Şehzade Abdullah (, Old Palace, Constantinople – , Old Palace, Constantinople, buried in Yavuz Selim Mosque).
* Şehzade Bayezid (1527, Old Palace, Constantinople – 25 September 1561, Qazvin, Safavid Empire, buried in Melik-i Acem Türbe, Sivas). He was governor of Karaman, Kütahya and later Amasya. He rebelled against his father for the throne and was, for this, executed by him, together with his sons.
* Şehzade Cihangir (1531, Old Palace, Constantinople – 27 November 1553, Aleppo, buried in Şehzade Mosque, Istanbul). Born with kyphosis and in poor health, for this he was judged unfit as an heir and was therefore not assigned any province to govern. For the same reason, he was not allowed to have concubines or father children.

==Personality==
Hürrem&#x27;s contemporaries describe her as a woman who was strikingly good-looking, and different from everybody else because of her red hair. Hürrem was also intelligent and had a pleasant personality. Her love of poetry is considered one of the reasons behind her being heavily favoured by Suleiman, who was a great admirer of poetry.

Hürrem is known to have been very generous to the poor. She built numerous mosques, madrasahs, hammams, and resting places for pilgrims travelling to the Islamic holy city of Makkah. Her greatest philanthropical work was the Great Waqf of AlQuds, a large soup kitchen in Jerusalem that fed the poor.

It is believed that Hürrem was a cunning, manipulative and stony-hearted woman who would execute anyone who stood in her way. However, her philanthropy is in contrast to this as she cared for the poor. Prominent Ukrainian writer Pavlo Zahrebelny describes Hürrem as &quot;an intelligent, kind, understanding, openhearted, candid, talented, generous, emotional and grateful woman who cares about the soul rather than the body; who is not carried away with ordinary glimmers such as money, prone to science and art; in short, a perfect woman.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Hürrem is well-known both in modern Turkey and in the West, and is the subject of many artistic works. In 1561, three years after her death, the French author Gabriel Bounin wrote a tragedy titled &quot;La Soltane&quot;. This tragedy marks the first time the Ottomans were introduced on stage in France. She has inspired paintings, musical works (including Joseph Haydn&#x27;s Symphony No. 63), an opera by Denys Sichynsky, a ballet, plays, and several novels written mainly in Russian and Ukrainian, but also in English, French, German and Polish.

In early modern Spain, she appears or is alluded to in works by Quevedo and other writers as well as in a number of plays by Lope de Vega. In a play entitled &quot;The Holy League&quot;, Titian appears on stage at the Venetian Senate, and stating that he has just come from visiting the Sultan, displays his painting of Sultana Rossa or Roxelana.

In 2007, Muslims in Mariupol, a port city in Ukraine opened a mosque to honour Roxelana.

In the 2003 TV miniseries, &quot;Hürrem Sultan&quot;, she was played by Turkish actress and singer Gülben Ergen. In the 2011–2014 TV series &quot;Muhteşem Yüzyıl&quot;, Hürrem Sultan is portrayed by Turkish-German actress Meryem Uzerli from seasons one to three. For the series&#x27; last season, she is portrayed by Turkish actress Vahide Perçin. Hürrem is portrayed by Megan Gale in the 2022 movie &quot;Three Thousand Years of Longing&quot;.

In 2013, Croatian singer Severina made a song &quot;Hurem&quot; after national success of TV series &quot;Muhteşem Yüzyıl&quot;, which was broadcast in Croatia. As of 2024 the song has 27 million views.

In 2019, a mention of a Russian origin for Hürrem was removed from the visitor panel near her tomb at the Süleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul at the request of the Ukrainian embassy in Turkey.

== Visual tradition ==

Although male European artists were denied access to Hürrem in the harem, there are many Renaissance paintings of the famous sultana. Scholars thus agree that European artists created a visual identity for Ottoman women that was largely imagined. The artists Titian, Melchior Lorich and Sebald Beham were all influential in creating a visual representation of Hürrem. Images of the chief consort emphasized her beauty and wealth, and she is almost always depicted with elaborate headwear.

The Venetian painter Titian is reputed to have painted Hürrem in 1550. Although he never visited Constantinople, he either imagined her appearance or had a sketch of her. In a letter to Philip II of Spain, the painter claims to have sent him a copy of this &quot;Queen of Persia&quot; in 1552. The Ringling Museum in Sarasota, Florida, purchased the original or a copy around 1930. Titian&#x27;s painting of Hürrem is very similar to his portrait of her daughter, Mihrimah Sultan.

<text>The Prime Minister of Singapore is the head of government of Singapore. The president appoints the prime minister on the advice and consent of the Cabinet of Singapore. The incumbent prime minister is Lawrence Wong, who took office on 15 May 2024.

Singapore is modelled after the Westminster system. The prime minister only governs with the confidence of the majority in Parliament; as such, the prime minister typically sits as a Member of Parliament (MP) and leads the largest party or a coalition of parties. In practice, the prime minister is the leader of the majority party in Parliament.

==History==
The office of prime minister succeeded the office of chief minister in 1959 after Singapore had attained self-governance from the United Kingdom, as the State of Singapore, with Lee Kuan Yew being sworn in as the first prime minister on 5 June 1959. 

Concerning Singapore&#x27;s autonomous status in the Malaysia Agreement, the title of prime minister remained unchanged after Singapore&#x27;s merger with Malaya, Sarawak and North Borneo to form Malaysia in 1963, despite the existence of the prime minister of Malaysia for the entire federation of which Singapore was briefly a part.

Following the independence of Singapore in 1965, the office of Prime Minister was retained, with the president of Singapore becoming a ceremonial head of state. In 1991, amendments to the Constitution of Singapore vested executive powers in the presidency, along with discretionary veto powers over the government. The Constitution also vests &quot;general direction and control of the government&quot; in the Cabinet, with the president almost always bound to act on the advice of the Cabinet or any minister acting under the Cabinet authority. Thus, in practice, most of the actual work of governing is done by the prime minister and Cabinet.

Under Article 26(4)(a) of the Constitution of Singapore, the prime minister may appoint a Cabinet minister, subject to presidential approval, as acting prime minister if the prime minister is on medical leave, away from Singapore or is granted a leave of absence under Article 32 of the Constitution. The deputy prime minister or senior minister will usually become the acting prime minister. Still, any Cabinet minister may be appointed to the role.

==Authority==
Under the Constitution, executive power is nominally vested in the president. However, the president can only exercise that authority on the advice of the Cabinet or a minister acting under general Cabinet authority. Hence, in practice, the prime minister, as the Cabinet&#x27;s leader, does most of the actual work of governing.

The prime minister is responsible for overseeing the government&#x27;s day-to-day affairs and executing government policy. As leader of the majority party in Parliament, the prime minister is also responsible for passing legislation through Parliament. 

The prime minister also nominates the speaker of Parliament and leader of the house, who are responsible for arranging government business and organising legislative programmes, usually under the directive of the prime minister and the Cabinet.

The prime minister chooses the other members of the Cabinet by advising the president; the president must exercise their powers in accordance with the advice of the prime minister. The prime minister may change, retain, or revoke any sitting minister&#x27;s appointment under their prerogative. The prime minister also advises the president on appointments, such as Attorney-General, and Permanent Secretary of a ministry.

The prime minister can advise the president to make a Proclamation of Emergency; the president issues the Proclamation if satisfied. 

The prime minister can declare a defence or security measure, and has executive authority over the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) through the Armed Forces Council, which consists of Minister for Defence, Permanent Secretaries of the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF), Chief of Defence Force, Chief of Army, Chief of Air Force and Chief of Navy; all of whom are appointed by the president under the prime minister&#x27;s advice.

==Privileges==

Sri Temasek is the prime minister&#x27;s official residence, though none of the prime ministers have ever lived there. The Istana is the working office of the prime minister. Since 2024 however, Sri Temasek has been the working office of the Prime Minister due to the ongoing renovations at The Istana, as confirmed by Lawrence Wong in his National Day Address.

The prime minister is protected by the Specialised Security Command of the Singapore Police Force (SPF), who also ensure the protection of the president, Cabinet ministers, and visiting foreign dignitaries.

The annual salary package the prime minister would receive, including the 13th-month bonus, Annual Variable Component, and National Bonus, which is twice the MR4 benchmark, stands at . 

As there is no one to decide on the annual performance bonus for the prime minister, the prime minister&#x27;s bonus will be based only on the National Bonus. The prime minister is also on the Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient (MSO) scheme—where an additional 2% of their gross monthly salary will be credited into their Medisave account. 

The prime minister&#x27;s annual salary was before a salary review in 2011. On 21 May 2011, a committee was set by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, to review the salaries of the prime minister as well as the president, ministers, members of Parliament and other political officeholders. After the recommended wage reductions by the committee were accepted in Parliament, the prime minister&#x27;s salary was reduced by 36%—including the removal of his pension to or approximately at that time. 

Nonetheless, Singapore&#x27;s prime minister remains the world&#x27;s highest-paid political leader.

<text>The Delmar Loop, often referred to by St. Louis residents simply as The Loop, is an entertainment, cultural and restaurant district in University City, Missouri and the adjoining western edge of St. Louis near Washington University in St. Louis and Forest Park.

Many of its attractions are located in the streetcar suburb of University City, but the area is expanding eastward into the Skinker DeBaliviere neighborhood of the City of St. Louis. In 2007, the American Planning Association named the Delmar Loop &quot;One of the 10 Great Streets in America.&quot;

==Origin and overview==
The area gets its name from a streetcar turnaround, or &quot;loop&quot;, formerly located in the area.

Delmar Boulevard was originally known as Morgan Street. According to Norbury L. Wayman in his &quot;circa&quot; 1980 series &quot;History of St. Louis Neighborhoods&quot;, the name Delmar was coined when two early landowners living on opposite sides of the road, one from Delaware and one from Maryland, combined the names of their home states. The town of Delmar, Delaware, on the border between the two states, derived its name in similar fashion.

The Delmar Loop station, a stop on the MetroLink Red Line, is located at the eastern end of the area.

The western demarcation of the Loop is generally considered to be the U. City Lions, sculptures of a male lion and a female lion on pedestals flanking Delmar immediately west of the University City City Hall. West of the lions, Delmar becomes largely residential. The eastern boundary of the Loop traditionally was the St. Louis City border, punctuated by The Delmar Lounge at the corner of Delmar and Eastgate, but the area began expanding into the city proper around 2000. This expansion has largely been due to the redevelopment efforts of Joe and Linda Edwards, owners of Blueberry Hill, The Pageant, and Pin-Up Bowl, Magic Mini Golf, the Moonrise Hotel, and Eclipse Restaurant. The St. Louis Regional Arts Commission completed its new headquarters on Delmar in 2003, creating performance and office spaces for theater groups. The Pageant, located across Delmar from the Arts Commission, has become one of St. Louis&#x27;s main venues for mid-size popular musical performances, featuring rap, rock, and country artists, including St. Louisans Chuck Berry and Nelly.

The Loop attracts an eclectic clientele and wide variety of street life, due in part to its proximity to Washington University and dating back to the late 1960s when Streetside Records and head shops dominated the retail landscape.

==Attractions and institutions==

Major Loop institutions include:
*The Pageant music venue
*&quot;Riverfront Times&quot; newspaper
*Tivoli Theater
*University City City Hall
*University City Public Library
*Blueberry Hill pub and restaurant
*Fitz&#x27;s Restaurant and Bottling Company

Companies such as Capacity and Integrity have their headquarters in the Delmar Loop.

Other establishments on the Loop include the 560 Music Center (owned by Washington University in St. Louis), COCA Center for Creative Arts, Craft Alliance Center of Art + Design, Moonrise Hotel, Subterranean Books, and Vintage Vinyl record store.

The Loop is also home to many local restaurants including Al-Tarboush deli, Peacock Loop Diner (closed on January 2025), Blueprint Coffee, Salt and Smoke, Katsuya STL, Up Late, Fork &amp; Stix, Nudo House, Paris Bahn Mi STL, Cicero&#x27;s Italian Restaurant (closed in 2017), Corner 17 Chinese Restaurant, Gokul Indian Restaurant, Gyro House, Meshuggah Cafe, Session Taco (formerly Mission Taco), Three Kings Public House (closed due to 2023 fire), Seoul Taco, Piccione Pastry (closed in 2019), Ranoush Mediterranean Cuisine, Snarf&#x27;s Sandwiches, T-N-T Wieners, Vegas Wok, and four Thai restaurants owned by Pat&#x27;s Thai Restaurants.

===St. Louis Walk of Fame===
The Loop is the home of the St. Louis Walk of Fame, a series of brass plaques embedded in the sidewalk along Delmar Boulevard commemorating famous St. Louisans, including musicians Chuck Berry, Miles Davis and Tina Turner, actor John Goodman, bridge-builder James Eads and sexologists Masters and Johnson.

===Trolley===
The Loop Trolley is a 2.2-mile fixed-track heritage trolley line in the Loop, that links the area with MetroLink and Forest Park attractions, a project that received a $24.9 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration. The trolley officially began service on November 16, 2018, in the city of St. Louis and one week later on its University City section in the Loop. The trolley was shut down in December 2019 amid financial problems, but reopened in August 2022.

==History==
During the 1950s, the Loop was the meeting place for U. City&#x27;s teenagers. The Varsity Theater and the Tivoli showed first-run movies. Ed&#x27;s Billiards which was located between the two theaters was always full of teenagers. There were restaurants up and down the Loop area. Enright Avenue, which was part of the streetcar turnaround, had a drug store and three restaurants plus a record store. There was another drug store on the corner of Delmar and Kingsland. Both drugstores had soda fountains. Delmar at Skinker wasn&#x27;t considered part of the Loop but had a Garaveli&#x27;s Restaurant and a well known nightclub Davy &quot;Nose&quot; Bold&#x27;s across from it.

The video for the song &quot;Air Force Ones&quot;, by rapper Nelly was filmed in the Delmar Loop. Nelly&#x27;s hit &quot;Country Grammar (Hot Shit)&quot;, references the Loop extensively.

<doc id="350660" wikidata="Q39021" url="?curid=350660" title="President of Singapore">
<text>The President of the Republic of Singapore is the head of state of Singapore. The president represents the country in official diplomatic functions and possesses certain executive powers over the Government of Singapore, including the control of the national reserves and the ability to revoke and appoint public service appointments. 
After Singapore achieved full internal self-governance from the British Empire in 1959, the ceremonial office of the &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Negara&quot; ( &quot;Lord of the State&quot;) was created. The office was later succeeded by the President of Singapore after Singapore&#x27;s independence in 1965. The initial role of the president was largely ceremonial and symbolic, carrying limited residual powers; prior to 1991, the president was solely appointed by Parliament. Singapore follows a non-executive model of the Westminster parliamentary system whereby the president is not the head of government but rather the head of state. These powers are instead vested in the Cabinet, led by the prime minister. 

A constitutional amendment was made in 1991 to allow for the president to be directly elected by a popular vote, which was subsequently first held in 1993. Since 1991, the elected President was vested with significant custodial powers, most notably the reserve power to veto any current government budget that in his or her determination (along with the mandatory consultation with the Council of Presidential Advisers), would likely draw on the country&#x27;s past financial reserves (derived from previous terms of government, as a check and balance process), along with the power to veto the removal or appointment of key office holders in the public service, statutory boards and government companies (listed within the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution), among other powers listed in the Constitution. Another constitutional amendment was made in 2016, that allows for a presidential election to be reserved for an ethnic community in Singapore if no one from that community had been president within the previous five presidential terms. There are no term limits for the Singapore presidency.

The president has far-reaching formal obligations and duty to act above party politics. Under the Constitution, the president must be a Singaporean citizen, non-partisan and elected by a popular vote. The incumbent president is Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who took office on 14 September 2023 after being duly elected in the 2023 presidential election with 70.41% of the vote.

==History==
The office of the President of the Republic of Singapore was created on 22 December 1965, retrospective to 9 August 1965, on which Singapore achieved independence from Malaysia. It succeeded the office of Yang di-Pertuan Negara ( &quot;Lord of the State&quot;) which was created when Singapore attained full internal self-government from the British Empire in 1959. The last Yang di-Pertuan Negara, Yusof Ishak, became the first President. After his death in 1971, he was succeeded by Benjamin Sheares who was appointed by Parliament and served until his death in 1981.

Sheares was succeeded by Devan Nair, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Anson SMC from 1979 to 1981, prior to his presidency, who then resigned in 1985. Whilst the apparent reason for Nair&#x27;s resignation was to seek recovery from his alcoholism, Nair disputes the account, claiming that he was forced out of office by former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. Nair was succeeded by Wee Kim Wee, who served as the Ambassador of South Korea and Japan from 1980 to 1984 prior to his presidency until 1993 and was the first president to exercise custodial powers pursuant to the constitutional amendments in 1991.

In the early 1980s, the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP), who at the time occupied all the parliamentary seats in Singapore, suffered their first parliamentary loss in 15 years to J. B. Jeyaretnam of the Worker&#x27;s Party (WP). As such, then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew became worried that there would one day be a &quot;freak election result&quot; where the PAP would no longer have control over the Parliament and opposition parties would have unfettered access to the government&#x27;s reserves. As such, in January 1991, a constitutional amendment was passed by Parliament to redefine the role of the president.

The amendment provided that the president would be elected by a popular vote, subject to strict eligibility requirements. The president was also empowered by the amendment to veto the use of the country&#x27;s reserves and revoke or appoint public service appointments. The president can also examine the government&#x27;s usage of the Internal Security Act and Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act, and concur with the director of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) to investigate persons for corrupt practices, even if the prime minister refuses consent.

The first elected president was Ong Teng Cheong, who served as Deputy Prime Minister from 1985 to 1993 prior to his presidency, won the 1993 presidential election. He served as president from 1993 to 1999. The Singapore Government officially regarded Ong&#x27;s predecessor Wee Kim Wee as the first elected president on the basis that he held and exercised the powers of the elected president. This was a result of transitional provisions in the Constitution of Singapore in 2017, which were affirmed by the High Court following a legal challenge by then-presidential candidate Tan Cheng Bock. Tan appealed against this decision, but the appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.

The sixth and the oldest to become president was S. R. Nathan, who served as the Ambassador of the United States from 1990 to 1996 prior to his presidency. He ran unopposed, and became president by virtue of being the sole candidate deemed qualified by the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC). He served his first term of office from 1999 to 2005 before being re-elected unopposed again for a second term, and he served until 2011.

After S. R. Nathan stepped down, Tony Tan, who served as Deputy Prime Minister from 1995 to 2005 prior to his presidency, won the 2011 presidential election by a narrow margin in a four-cornered fight. He was sworn in as the seventh president of Singapore on 1 September 2011. Ong Teng Cheong, Tony Tan, and Tharman Shanmugaratnam are the only Deputy Prime Ministers who became presidents.

In 2016, further amendments to the Constitution were passed providing for &quot;reserved elections&quot; for a particular ethnic community, if that community has not provided a president in the past five presidential terms.

The eighth president, Halimah Yacob, who served as Speaker of Parliament from 2013 to 2017, prior to her presidency, took office on 14 September 2017. She was the sole eligible candidate under the new reform terms which took effect earlier that year. Yacob was also the first Malay head of state in 47 years since the death of the first president of Singapore, Yusof Ishak, and the first female President of Singapore.

On 1 September 2023, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who served as Deputy Prime Minister from 2011 to 2019, and Senior Minister from 2019 to 2023, prior to his presidency, won the 2023 presidential election and was elected the ninth President of Singapore after receiving 70.41% of the votes cast.

In November 2023, the parliament of Singapore passed a bill to amend the constitution to allow the President of Singapore to hold international positions in their private capacity, only if the position is of national interest.

==Constitutional role==
The president is the head of state of Singapore. In addition to being the head of state, it is also the function of the president to safeguard the national reserves and the integrity of the public service of Singapore. The executive authority of Singapore is vested in the president and exercisable by them or by the Cabinet or any minister authorised by the Cabinet. However, the Constitution vests &quot;general direction and control of the Government&quot; in the Cabinet. In most cases, the president is bound to exercise their powers in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet.

However, the president is able to exercise some powers in their personal discretion such as preventing the government of the day from drawing on the reserves which were not accumulated during its current term of office, revoking or appointing any of the public offices under Article 22 of the Constitution such as Chief Justice, Attorney-General, Chief of Defence Force and Commissioner of Police, amongst others., exercising oversight over the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) and decisions of the Executive under the Internal Security Act and the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act.

As a component of the legislature together with Parliament, the president is also jointly vested with legislative authority. The president&#x27;s primary role in the exercise of legislative power to make laws is assenting to bills passed by Parliament.

As the president exercises this constitutional function in accordance with the Cabinet&#x27;s advice and not in their personal discretion except in certain circumstances, they may not refuse to assent to bills that Parliament has validly passed. The words of enactment in Singapore Statutes are: &quot;Be it enacted by the president with the advice and consent of the Parliament of Singapore, as follows:&quot;. The president usually opens each parliamentary session with an address drafted by the Cabinet setting out the government&#x27;s agenda for the session, and may address Parliament and send messages to it.

The president has been called &quot;Singapore&#x27;s No. 1 diplomat&quot;. Ambassadors and high commissioners accredited to Singapore present their credentials to the president, and the president is called upon by visiting foreign dignitaries. In addition, the president contributes to the nation&#x27;s external relations by undertaking overseas trips on Cabinet&#x27;s advice. The president also serves as the &quot;ex officio&quot; chancellor of both the National University of Singapore and the Nanyang Technological University.

Presidents have also used the office to champion charitable causes. Wee Kim Wee promoted sports and volunteerism; Ong Teng Cheong promoted culture and the arts, particularly music; and S. R. Nathan established the President&#x27;s Challenge with the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports and its statutory board, the National Council of Social Service. As of 2011, the endeavour had raised more than S$100 million for charities supporting disabled and needy people.
==Powers==

The powers of the president are divided into those which the president may exercise in their own discretion, and those which must be exercised in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet. In addition, the president is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA) when performing some of their functions. In other cases, they may consult the CPA if they wish to but is not bound to do so.

The Constitution confers on the president certain executive functions to block attempts by the government of the day to draw down reserves that it did not accumulate. Thus, a guarantee may only be given or a loan raised by the government if the president concurs, and their approval is also needed for budgets of specified statutory boards and state-owned companies that draw on their past reserves.

The president also possesses personal discretion to withhold assent to any bill in Parliament providing directly or indirectly for the direct or indirect variation, changing or increase in powers of the Central Provident Fund Board to invest moneys belonging to it; and the borrowing of money, the giving of any guarantee or the raising of any loan by the government if in the president&#x27;s opinion the bill is likely to draw on reserves not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office. In addition, the president may withhold assent to any Supply Bill, Supplementary Supply Bill or Final Supply Bill for any financial year if in their opinion the estimates of revenue and expenditure, supplementary estimates or statement of excess are likely to lead to a drawing on past reserves.

The president is also empowered to approve changes to key political appointments, such as the chief justice, attorney-general, chairman and members of the Public Service Commission, Chief of Defence Force and the Commissioner of Police. They also appoint the Prime Minister, a Member of Parliament (MP) who, in their opinion, is likely to command the confidence of a majority of MPs. The president has certain powers of oversight over the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau and decisions of the Executive under the Internal Security Act and the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act.

Under the Singapore Armed Forces Act, the president has the authority to raise and maintain the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). The president also has the power to form, disband or amalgamate units within the SAF.

The term of office of the first elected president, Ong Teng Cheong, was marked by the differences between the government and him, concerning the extent of his discretionary fiscal powers. Discussions culminated in the government issuing a non-binding white paper entitled &quot;The Principles for Determining and Safeguarding the Accumulated Reserves of the Government and the Fifth Schedule Statutory Boards and Government Companies&quot; (1999).

In 2009, the government had to request for the approval from President S. R. Nathan to draw $4.9 billion from past financial reserves to meet current budget expenditure, the first time it had done so. The sum was used to fund the government&#x27;s Resilience Package consisting of two schemes aimed at preserving jobs and businesses during the Great Recession.

==Election==
===Qualifications===
A person who wishes to run for the office of president has to fulfil stringent qualifications set out in the Constitution, which are as follows:
*The president must be a citizen of Singapore.
*The president must not be less than 45 years of age.
*The president&#x27;s name must appear in a current register of electors.
*The president must be resident in Singapore at the date of their nomination for election, and must have been so resident for periods amounting in the aggregate to not less than ten years prior to that date.
*The president must not be subject to any of the following disqualifications:
::(a) being and having been found or declared to be of unsound mind;
::(b) being an undischarged bankrupt;
::(c) holding an office of profit;
::(d) having been nominated for election to Parliament or the office of President or having acted as election agent to a person so nominated, failing to lodge any return of election expenses required by law within the time and in the manner so required;
::(e) having been convicted of an offence by a court of law (whether in Singapore or not) and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than one year or to a fine of not less than S$10,000 (or equivalent in foreign currency) and having not received a free pardon. The person if convicted by a foreign court of law shall not be disqualified unless the offence is also one which, had it been committed in Singapore, would have been punishable by a court of law in Singapore;
::(f) having voluntarily acquired the citizenship of, or exercised rights of citizenship in, a foreign country, or having made a declaration of allegiance to a foreign country;
::(g) being disqualified under any law relating to offences in connection with elections to Parliament or the office of President by reason of having been convicted of such an offence or having in proceedings relating to such an election been proved guilty of an act constituting such an offence.
*The president must be a person of integrity, good character and reputation.
*The president must not be a member of any political party on the date of their nomination for election.
*The president must have for a period of not less than three years held office —
**as Minister, Chief Justice, Speaker, Attorney-General, Chairman of the Public Service Commission, Auditor-General, Accountant-General or Permanent Secretary;
**as chief executive officer (CEO) of a key statutory board or government company: the Central Provident Fund Board, the Housing and Development Board, the Jurong Town Corporation, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Temasek Holdings, or GIC Private Limited (formerly known as the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation);
**as the most senior executive of a company incorporated in Singapore with an average of $500 million in shareholders&#x27; equity for the most recent three years in that office, and which is profitable after taxes; or
**in any other similar or comparable position of seniority and responsibility in any other organisation or department of equivalent size or complexity in the public or private sector which has given him such experience and ability in administering and managing financial affairs as to enable him to carry out effectively the functions and duties of the office of president.

The strictness of these qualifications led to the 1999, 2005, and 2017 elections being walkovers as only one candidate had qualified on nomination day.

In November 2016, further amendments provide for &quot;reserved elections&quot; for a particular racial group (Chinese, Malay and Indian/other minority) — if that community has not been represented for five presidential terms. Other amendments were made to expand the list of key government companies eligible for the candidacy, and, for candidates using their private sector experience, the use of $500 million of shareholder equity instead of $100 million in paid-up capital. The changes went into effect in April 2017. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong later explained that while he expected the &quot;reserved election&quot; policy to be unpopular among the population, he believed it was &quot;the right thing to do&quot;.

===Election procedure===
The president holds office for a term of six years from the date on which they assume office. The office falls vacant upon the expiry of the incumbent&#x27;s term or if the president is for some reason unable to complete their term; for example, due to death, resignation, or removal from office for misconduct or mental or physical infirmity. If the office of president becomes vacant before the incumbent&#x27;s term expires, a poll for an election must be held within six months. In other cases, an election can take place any time from three months before the expiry of the incumbent&#x27;s term of office.

The procedure for elections is laid out in the Presidential Elections Act. The process begins when the prime minister issues a writ of election to the returning officer specifying the date and place of nomination day. Potential candidates must obtain certificates of eligibility from the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC), the function of which is to ensure that such persons have the necessary qualifications to be nominated as a candidate for the election. In particular, the PEC must be satisfied that the potential candidates are persons of integrity, good character and reputation; and if they have not previously held certain key government offices or acted as chairman of the board of directors or CEO of a company incorporated or registered under the Companies Act with shareholders&#x27; equity of at least $500 million, that they held a position of comparable seniority and responsibility in the public or private sector that has given them experience and ability in administering and managing financial affairs. The PEC consists of the chairman of the Public Service Commission, who is also the chairman of the PEC, the chairman of the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, and a member of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights. For the 2017 presidential election, the members of the PEC are Eddie Teo (chairman), Lim Soo Hoon, Chan Heng Chee, Po&#x27;ad Shaik Abu Bakar Mattar, Tay Yong Kwang, and Peter Seah.

In addition, candidates must obtain political donation certificates from the registrar of political donations stating that they have complied with the Political Donations Act, and file their nomination papers with the returning officer on nomination day. A deposit must also be paid. The candidate is declared to have been elected president if only one candidate is nominated. Otherwise, the returning officer issues a notice of contested election specifying when polling day will be.

During the election period, a candidate may not spend more than $600,000 or 30 cents for each person on the electoral register, whichever is greater. Permits must be obtained to hold election meetings and display posters and banners, and a number of acts are unlawful, including bribery, dissuading electors from voting, making false statements about candidates, treating and undue influence. Legal changes introduced in 2010 made the eve of polling day a &quot;cooling-off day&quot; – campaigning must not take place on that day and on polling day itself.

Polling day is a public holiday, and voting is compulsory. Voters must go to the polling stations assigned to them. After the poll closes, the presiding officer of each polling station seals the ballot boxes without opening them. Candidates or their polling agents may also affix their own seals to the ballot boxes. The ballot boxes are then taken to counting centres to be opened and the ballots counted. A candidate or his or her counting agent may ask the returning officer for a recount of votes if the difference between the number of votes for the candidate with the most votes and any other candidate&#x27;s number of votes is 2% or less. After all counts, and recounts if any, have been completed, the returning officer ascertains whether the total number of electors registered to vote overseas is less than the difference between the number of votes for the two candidates with the highest number of votes. If so, the returning officer declares the candidate with the highest number of votes to be elected as president. If not, the overseas votes may be decisive. The returning officer then states the number of votes cast for each candidate and the date and location where the overseas votes will be counted.

===Last contested election===
The 2023 presidential election was the first election with a ballot since the 2011 election. The election was won by Tharman Shanmugaratnam with 1,746,427 (70.40%) of valid votes.

==Assumption of office and disabilities==
The person elected to the office of president assumes office on the day his predecessor ceases to hold office or, if the office is vacant, on the day following the election. Upon assumption of office, the president is required to take and subscribe in the presence of the chief justice or of another justice of the Supreme Court the Oath of Office, which states:

If the President is a Christian, He or She may utter the phrase in the last sentence, &quot;So help me God&quot;.

Once elected, the president shall:
* not hold any other office created or recognised by the Constitution;
* not actively engage in any commercial enterprise;
* not be a member of any political party; and
* not serve in Parliament.

==Succession==
In the case when the president is unable to perform their duties, their powers are temporarily transferred to the chairman of the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA). If the chairman of the Council of Presidential Advisers is not available, the speaker of the Parliament performs the duties of the president. If both are unavailable the presidential functions are performed by an individual appointed by the Parliament.

==Salary and entitlements==
The Parliament of Singapore is required to provide a civil list for the maintenance of the president, and it does so by way of the Civil List and Gratuity Act. With effect from 17 February 2012, the sum under Class I of the list, which includes the president&#x27;s personal pay ($1,568,900, known by the British term the &quot;privy purse&quot;), an entertainment allowance ($73,000) and an allowance for an acting president ($4,500), is $1,646,400. The privy purse was reduced from $4,267,500 after the president accepted the Ministerial Salaries Review Committee&#x27;s recommendations on the matter.

The salaries for the president&#x27;s personal staff (Class II) amount to $4,532,400. Speaking in Parliament on 10 March 2011, Minister for Finance Tharman Shanmugaratnam explained that this sum was to cater for the salaries of an additional staff officer to support the work of the Council of Presidential Advisers, and a butler manager; and to meet higher variable staff salary payments due to the nation&#x27;s strong economic growth. The allowance for the Istana&#x27;s household expenses (Class III) is $2,762,308, an increase from $694,000. This allowance is used to cover the maintenance of the Istana, vehicles, utilities and other supplies, as well as for ceremonies and celebrations. The increase was to cater for higher expenses for maintaining computer systems, buildings and land, and to account for inflation.

Class IV expenses for &quot;special services&quot; are $550,000. In previous years, this sum was used to cover various expenses such as the cost of replacing state cars and installing a new document repository. Overall, the current civil list of $9,491,100 represents a decrease of about 18% from the sum for the past fiscal year of $11,605,000.

<text>The Bay of Islands is an area on the east coast of the Far North District of the North Island of New Zealand. It is one of the most popular fishing, sailing and tourist destinations in the country, and has been renowned internationally for its big-game fishing since American author Zane Grey publicised it in the 1930s. It is north-west of the city of Whangārei. Cape Reinga, at the northern tip of the country, is about by road further to the north-west.

== Etymology ==

The bay is known in Māori as Tokerau, a name given by early Māori ancestors referencing a place in the Māori homeland. The wider Bay of Islands area, including the plain surrounding Waimate North, is traditionally known as Taiamai, a name shortened from the Ngāpuhi (proverb) (&quot;the pūriri trees are laughing with joy&quot;), a phrase used to express delight in the world, or to welcome an honoured guest. The bay&#x27;s English name was given on 27 November 1769 by Captain James Cook during his first voyage, when Cook and his crew landed on Motuarohia Island.

== Geography ==
The bay is an irregularly-shaped -wide, drowned valley system and a natural harbour. It contains 144 islands, of which the largest is Urupukapuka, and numerous peninsulas and inlets. The three largest inlets are Waikare Inlet in the south, and Kerikeri and Te Puna (Mangonui) inlets in the north-west. The Purerua Peninsula, north of Te Puna Inlet, separates the north-western part of the bay from the Pacific Ocean, and Cape Brett Peninsula extends into the ocean at the eastern end of the bay. The biggest town is Kerikeri, followed by Paihia. The small town of Russell is located at the end of a short peninsula that extends into the bay from the southeast.

== History ==

About 700 years ago, the Mātaatua, one of the large Māori migration canoes which journeyed to New Zealand from Hawaiki, was sailed to the Bay of Islands (from the Bay of Plenty) by Puhi, a progenitor of the Ngāpuhi iwi (tribe) which today is the largest in the country. Māori settled and multiplied throughout the bay and on several of its many islands to establish various tribes such as the Ngāti Miru at Kerikeri. Many notable Māori were born in the Bay of Islands, including Hōne Heke who several times cut down the flagpole at Kororāreka (Russell) to start the Flagstaff War.

Many of the Māori settlements later played important roles in the development of New Zealand, such as Okiato (the nation&#x27;s first capital), Waitangi (where the Treaty of Waitangi would later be signed) and Kerikeri, (which was an important departure point for inland Māori going to sea, and later site of the first permanent mission station in the country). Some of the islands became notable as well, such as Motu Apo (Te Pahi Island) where 60 of chief Te Pahi&#x27;s people were killed as revenge after he was wrongly accused of being responsible for the Boyd Massacre at Whangaroa.

The first European to visit the area was Captain Cook, who named the region in 1769. The Bay of Islands was the first area in New Zealand to be settled by Europeans. Whalers arrived towards the end of the 18th century, while the first missionaries settled in 1814. The first full-blooded European child recorded as being born in the country, Thomas King, was born in 1815 at Oihi Bay in the Bay of Islands (there have been unsubstantiated claims that a European girl was born earlier at the Dusky Sound settlement in the South Island).

The bay has many interesting historic towns including Paihia, Russell, Waitangi and Kerikeri. Russell, formerly known as Kororāreka, was the first permanent European settlement in New Zealand, and dates from the early 19th century. Kerikeri contains many historic sites from the earliest European colonial settlement in the country. These include the Mission House, also called Kemp House, which is the oldest wooden structure still standing in New Zealand. The Stone Store, a former storehouse, is the oldest stone building in New Zealand, construction having begun on 19 April 1832. These settlements also reared horses during this time to the fascination of local Māori who called them &quot;man-carrying dogs&quot; (&quot;kurī waha tangata&quot;).

The Bay of Islands was visited in the 19th century by sealing ships and whaling ships that hunted in the ocean around New Zealand, often bartering with local iwi to restock their food supplied with local potatoes and pork. In December 1835 Charles Darwin visited the Bay of Islands in . In February 1840, some members of the United States Exploring Expedition were present at the initial signing of the Treaty of Waitangi at Waitangi.

In a 2006 study, the Bay of Islands was found to have the second bluest sky in the world, after Rio de Janeiro.

A new fast boat manufactured by the Explore Group was introduced in the Bay of Islands in 2019 to take visitors to the Hole in the Rock at speed. The daily transport facility can seat up to 30 passengers and will ply several times during the day.

== &quot;Cream Trip&quot; ==
In 1886, Albert Ernest Fuller launched the sailing ship &quot;Undine&quot; in the Bay of Islands to deliver coal supplies to the islands within the bay. With the fitting of a motor in the early 20th century, Fuller was able to deliver the coal and essential supplies to communities as far out as Cape Brett.

In 1927 Fuller acquired &quot;Cream Trip&quot; from Eddie Lane – with the facilities on board to transport cream from the islands, and by the 1960s, the newly commissioned &quot;Bay Belle&quot; started this run.

Although a modern catamaran now takes this historical route of the original Cream Trip, &quot;Bay Belle&quot; continues to transport visitors and locals between Paihia and Russell throughout the day.

Born in 1896 in Blockton, Iowa, Hickenlooper&#x27;s college education at Iowa State College in Ames was interrupted by his service in the U.S. Army.

=== World War I ===
He served as an officer in France during World War I.

=== Higher education ===
After his military service Hickenlooper continued his education at Iowa State and then went on to the University of Iowa College of Law, where he received a law degree in 1922. He practiced law in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

=== Religion ===
Hickenlooper was a Methodist.

=== Governor of Iowa ===
in the 1942 election, governor George A. Wilson did not run for re-election, instead he successfully ran for a seat in the United States Senate. Hickenlooper was elected to succeed Wilson, defeating former governor Nelson Kraschel 63% to 37%, serving one term from 1943-1945. Hickenlooper did not seek re-election in 1944, instead he successfully ran for a seat in the United States Senate, narrowly defeating incumbent Democratic senator Guy Gillette.

=== Senate ===
In the Senate, Hickenlooper was known as one of the most conservative and isolationist members of the Republican Party, and perhaps one of the most conservative American congressmen. He became one of the most powerful Republicans in the Senate, serving as the Republican Policy Committee Chairman from 1962 to 1969. In this position, he had an intense rivalry with Everett Dirksen, the Senate Republican leader at the time. Hickenlooper voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, but along with fellow conservative Barry Goldwater, voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He also voted in favor of the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

===Legislation===
The 1962 Hickenlooper Amendment to the foreign aid bill cuts off aid to any country expropriating U.S. property. The amendment was aimed at Castro&#x27;s Cuba, which had expropriated U.S.-owned and U.S.-controlled sugar plantations and refineries.

===USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident=== 
Senator Hickenlooper was outraged by the 1967 USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident and was one of the few Congressmen to call for an investigation. He was openly skeptical of Israel&#x27;s mistaken identity explanation: &quot;From what I have read I can&#x27;t tolerate for one minute that this was an accident. I think it was a deliberate assault on this ship. I think they had ample opportunity to identify it as an American ship. … What have we done about the &quot;Liberty&quot;? Have we become so placid, so far as Israel is concerned or so far as that area is concerned, that we will take the killing of 37 [sic] American boys and the wounding of a lot more and the attack of an American ship in the open sea in good weather? We have seemed to say: &#x27;Oh, well, boys will be boys.&#x27; What are you going to do about it? It is most offensive to me…It is inconceivable to me that the ship could not have been identified. According to everything I saw, the American flag was flying on this ship. It had a particular configuration. Even a landlubber could look at it and see that it has no characteristic configuration comparable to the so-called Egyptian ship they now try to say they mistook it for. It just doesn’t add up to me. It is not at all satisfactory.&quot;

== Death ==
On September 4, 1971, Hickenlooper died at the age of 75 while visiting friends in Shelter Island, New York. He was buried at the Cedar Memorial Park cemetery in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

<doc id="350666" wikidata="Q188698" url="?curid=350666" title="Kīlauea">
<text>Kīlauea ( , ) is an active shield volcano in the Hawaiian Islands. It is located along the southeastern shore of Hawaii Island. The volcano is between 210,000 and 280,000 years old and grew above sea level about 100,000 years ago. Since the islands were settled, it has been the most active of the five volcanoes that together form the island and among the most active volcanoes on Earth. The most recent eruption began in December 2024.

Kīlauea is the second-youngest product of the Hawaiian hotspot and the current eruptive center of the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. Because it lacks topographic prominence and its activities historically coincided with those of Mauna Loa, Kīlauea was once thought to be a satellite of its much larger neighbor. Kīlauea has a large, fairly recently formed caldera at its summit and two active rift zones, one extending east and the other west. An active fault of unknown depth moves vertically an average of per year.

Between 2008 and 2018, Halemaʻumaʻu, a pit crater located within Kīlauea&#x27;s summit caldera, hosted an active lava lake. Kīlauea erupted nearly continuously from vents on its eastern rift zone between January 1983 and April 2018, causing major property damage, including the destruction in 1990 of the towns of Kalapana and Kaimū along with the community&#x27;s renowned black sand beach.

Beginning in May 2018, activity shifted further downrift from the summit to the lower Puna district, during which lava erupted from two dozen vents with eruptive fountains that sent rivers of lava into the ocean in three places. The eruption destroyed Hawaii&#x27;s largest natural freshwater lake, covered substantial portions of Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens, and destroyed the communities of Kapoho, Vacationland Hawaii, and most of the Kapoho Beach Lots. The County of Hawaii reported that 716 dwellings were destroyed. Concurrent with the activity downrift in lower Puna, the lava lake within Halemaumau drained and a series of explosive collapse events occurred at the volcano&#x27;s summit, with at least one explosion emitting ash into the air. This activity prompted a months-long closure of the Kīlauea section of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The eruption ended in September 2018. Since 2020, several eruptions have occurred within the enlarged caldera left by the 2018 collapse events as well as along the volcano&#x27;s southwest and east rift zones.

==Background==
Kīlauea is a Hawaiian word that means &quot;spewing&quot; or &quot;much spreading&quot;, referring to its frequent outpouring of lava. Its earliest lavas date back to its submarine preshield stage. Samples were recovered by remotely operated underwater vehicles; samples of other flows were recovered as core samples. Lavas younger than 1,000 years old cover 90 percent of the volcano&#x27;s surface. The oldest exposed lavas date back 2,800 years.

Radiocarbon and paleomagnetic dating identified a major eruption of Kīlauea around 1410, the first to be mentioned in Native Hawaiians&#x27; oral history. Western contact and written history began in 1778. The first documented eruption of Kīlauea came in 1823 with repeated eruptions thereafter. Most occurred at the volcano&#x27;s summit or its eastern rift zone, and were prolonged and effusive. The geological record shows that pre-contact explosive activity was common; in 1790 one such eruption killed more than 400 people, making it the deadliest volcanic eruption in what became the United States.

Kīlauea&#x27;s eruption from January 3, 1983, to 2018 was by far its longest-duration period of activity in modern times, as well as one of the longest-duration eruptions documented on Earth; as of January 2011, the eruption had produced of lava and resurfaced of land. Centuries prior to this event, the even larger ʻAilāʻau eruption of 1410 lasted about 60 years, ending in 1470 with an estimated volume of .

Kīlauea&#x27;s activity has a major impact on its mountainside ecology, where plant growth is often interrupted by fresh tephra and drifting volcanic sulfur dioxide, producing acid rains particularly in a barren area south of its southwestern rift zone known as the Kaʻū Desert. Nonetheless, wildlife flourishes left undisturbed elsewhere on the volcano and is highly endemic thanks to Kīlauea&#x27;s (and the island of Hawaii&#x27;s) isolation from the nearest continental landmass. Historically, the island&#x27;s five volcanoes were considered sacred by the Hawaiian people, and in Hawaiian mythology Halemaumau served as the body and home of Pele, goddess of fire, lightning, wind, and volcanoes.

English missionary William Ellis gave the first modern account of Kīlauea and spent two weeks exploring the volcano. Since its foundation by Thomas Jaggar in 1912, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, for many years located on the rim of Kīlauea&#x27;s summit caldera (Kaluapele), has served as the principal investigative and scientific body on the volcano and the island. In 1916, a bill forming Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson. The park is a World Heritage Site and a major tourist destination, attracting roughly 2.6 million visitors annually.

==Geology==
===Setting===
Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Kīlauea was formed as the Pacific tectonic plate moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth&#x27;s underlying mantle. Hawaii island volcanoes are the most recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has produced the -long Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. The prevailing view is that the hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet&#x27;s mantle for much of the Cenozoic Era. However, while the Hawaiian mantle plume is well understood and extensively studied, the nature of hotspots themselves remains uncertain.

Kīlauea is one of five subaerial (originating under water) volcanoes that make up the island of Hawaii, originated from the Hawaiian hotspot. The oldest volcano on the island, Kohala, is more than a million years old, while Kīlauea, the youngest, is between 300,000 and 600,000 years of age. Kamaʻehuakanaloa (the ruddy, reddish child of Kanaloa, formerly Lōʻihi), on the island&#x27;s flank, is younger and has yet to breach the surface. Thus Kilauea is the second youngest volcano in the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain, a chain of shield volcanoes and seamounts extending from Hawaii to the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench in Russia.

Kīlauea started as a submarine volcano, gradually growing larger and taller via underwater eruptions of alkali basalt lava before emerging from the sea with a series of explosive eruptions about 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. Since then, the volcano&#x27;s activity has produced a continual stream of effusive and explosive eruptions of roughly the same pattern as its activity since records began to be kept.

Hawaii island&#x27;s oldest volcano, Kohala, experienced almost 900,000 years of activity before going extinct. Eruptions and explosive activity will make Kīlauea taller, build up its rift zones, and fill and refill Kaluapele.

===Structure===
Kīlauea has been active throughout its history. Cinder cones, satellite shields, lava tubes, and other eruptive structures are present, evidence of its recent activity. Since 1918, Kīlauea&#x27;s longest pause lasted 18 years between 1934 and 1952. The bulk of Kīlauea consists of solidified lava flows, intermixed with volcanic ash and tephra produced by lower-volume explosive eruptions. Much of the volcano is covered in historical flows, while 90 percent of its surface is from the last 1,100 years. Much of its bulk remains underwater; its subaerial surface is a gently sloping, elongate, decentralized shield with a surface area of approximately , making up 13.7 percent of the island&#x27;s total surface area.

Kīlauea lacks topographical prominence, appearing only as a bulge on the southeastern flank of Mauna Loa. Native Hawaiians and early geologists considered it an active satellite of its host. However, lava analysis shows that the two have separate magma chambers. Nonetheless, high activity at one volcano roughly coincides with low activity at the other. When Kīlauea lay dormant between 1934 and 1952, Mauna Loa became active, and when the latter remained quiet from 1952 to 1974, the reverse was true. This is not always the case; the 1984 eruption of Mauna Loa started during an eruption at Kīlauea, but had no discernible effect on the Kīlauea eruption, and the ongoing inflation of Mauna Loa&#x27;s summit, indicative of a future eruption, began the same day as new lava flows at Kīlauea&#x27;s Puu Ōō crater. In 2002, Kilauea experienced a high-volume effusive episode at the same time that Mauna Loa began inflating. This unexpected communication is evidence of crustal-level interactions between them. Geologists suggested that &quot;pulses&quot; of magma entering Mauna Loa&#x27;s deeper magma system may have increased pressure inside Kīlauea and triggered the concurrent eruptions. Mauna Loa began erupting on November 27, 2022, during Kīlauea&#x27;s ongoing eruption, the first time since 1984 that both volcanoes were simultaneously erupting.

==== Kaluapele ====
Kīlauea has a large summit caldera named Kaluapele (the pit of Pele), measuring with walls up to high, breached by lava flows on the southwestern side. The age of Kaluapele is unknown, and it is possible that it has appeared and disappeared multiple times. Kaluapele likely formed over several centuries, beginning about 500 years ago, while its present form was finalized around 1470–1510 after a particularly powerful eruption from 1410 to 1470. A major feature within Kaluapele is Halemaumau, a large pit crater and one of Kīlauea&#x27;s most historically active eruption centers. The crater is approximately in diameter and deep, but its form has varied widely; its floor is mostly covered by flows from its 1974 eruption.

==== Rift zones ====
Kīlauea has two rift zones radiating from its summit, one leading out to the east, the other long and trending towards the southwest. A series of fault scarps connecting the rift zones form the Koae Fault Zone. Tectonic extension along them is causing Kīlauea&#x27;s bulk to slowly slide seaward off its southern flank at a rate of about per year, centered on a basal décollement fault beneath the volcano&#x27;s surface. The eastern rift zone is a dominant feature on the volcano; it is almost entirely covered in lava from the last 400 years, and at its crest near the summit is wide. Non-localized eruptions, typical of rift zone activity, have produced a series of low-lying ridges down the majority of the east rift zone&#x27;s length. Its upper segment is the most active section. It is the site of large pit craters. It reaches down Kīlauea&#x27;s submerged flank to a depth of more than . By contrast, the much smaller southwestern rift zone last had a rifting episode in 1974, and has not been active in the current eruptive cycle. The southwestern rift zone&#x27;s extremity is underwater, although its subaerial length is more limited. The southwestern rift zone lacks a well-defined ridge line and pit craters, evidence that it is less active than the eastern rift zone.

==== Hilina fault system ====
A prominent structure on Kīlauea&#x27;s southern flank is the Hilina fault system, an active fault slipping vertically an average of per year. Its physiographic province is deep, but it is unknown whether it is a shallow listric fault or penetrates deeply.

==Eruptive history==
All historical eruptions occurred at either Kaluapele, the eastern rift zone, or the southwestern rift zone. Half of Kīlauea&#x27;s historical eruptions have occurred at or near Kaluapele. Activity there was nearly continuous for much of the 19th century, capped by an explosive eruption in 1924, before petering out by 1934. Later activity mostly shifted to the eastern rift zone, the site of 24 historical eruptions, located mostly on its upper section. By contrast, the southwestern rift zone remained relatively quiet, hosting five events.

===Prehistoric eruptions===

Geologists dated and documented dozens of major eruptions over the volcano&#x27;s history, bridging the gap between Kīlauea&#x27;s oldest known rock and written records and historical observation. Lava flows are generally recovered by scientists in one of three ways. The oldest flows, 275,000 to 225,000 years ago, were recovered from Kīlauea&#x27;s submerged southern slope by remotely operated vehicles. These lavas exhibit forms characteristic of early, submerged preshield-stage eruptive episodes, from when the volcano was a rising seamount yet to breach the ocean surface, and their surface exposure is unusual, as in most other volcanoes such lavas would have since been buried by later flows.

The second method is by drilling core samples; however, the cores are difficult to date. Paleomagnetic dating, limited to rocks dating from after Kīlauea&#x27;s emergence from the sea, suggested ages of around 50,000 years. Exposed flows above sea level are younger. Some of the oldest reliably dated rock is 43,000 years old. It comes from charcoal sandwiched beneath an ash layer on a fault scarp known as Hilina Pali; however, samples dated from higher up the scarp indicate ash deposition at an average rate of per thousand years, indicating that the oldest exposed flows, from the base of the feature, could date back as far as 70,000 years. This date is similar to that of the oldest dated extant lava flow, a southwestern rift zone flow with uncorrected radiocarbon dating of approximately 4650 BC.

The oldest well-studied eruptive product from Kīlauea is the Uwēkahuna Ash Member, the product of explosive eruptions from 800 to 100 BC. Although it was mostly buried by younger flows, it remained exposed in some places, and was traced more than from Kaluapele, evidence of powerful eruptions. Evidence suggests the existence of an active eruptive center at this time, termed the Powers Caldera, whose fractures and faults lie outside Kaluapele. At least 1,200 years ago, lava from the Powers Caldera overtopped its rim and solidified the structure; this was followed by a period of voluminous tube-fed &quot;pāhoehoe&quot; flows from the summit. Following the end of activity around 1600 CE, eruptions moved to the eastern part of Kīlauea&#x27;s summit, and concurrently activity increased at the northern end of the eastern rift zone.

===1410 to 1790===
The longest-duration major eruption witnessed by Native Hawaiians took place from about 1410 to 1470. Lasting around 60 years, the Ailāau eruption&#x27;s effusive flow covered most of Kīlauea, north of the East Rift Zone in what became the Puna District. Most likely due to the duration of this flow, the summit collapsed around 1470–1510, creating Kaluapele. These discoveries and the collapse of the summit were supplemented by translations of Native Hawaiian chants on the mythology of Pele and Hiiaka; these events were interpreted from this story.

After arriving in Hawaii, Pele made Kīlauea her home. She sent her sister Hiiaka to retrieve Lohiau, an attractive man she met on Kauai, on the condition that Pele protect the forests of Puna if Hiiaka returned in 40 days. As the journey lasted longer than 40 days, Pele set fire to the forest. When Hiiaka finally returned with Lohiau and made the smoky discovery, she became angry and made love to Lohiau right in front of Pele. In retaliation, Pele then killed Lohiau before throwing him in a pit on the summit of Kīlauea. Hiiaka started digging ferociously to recover his body, letting rocks fly everywhere.

These events are interpreted to describe the Ailāau flow. In addition to Hawaiian oral history, geologists studied and confirmed them with radiocarbon and paleomagnetic dating.

Kīlauea then entered a 300-year period of explosive eruptions from around 1510 to 1790 as discovered by the radiocarbon dating of the Keanakākoʻi (the cave in which adzes were made) Tephra. This tephra was formed after lava erupted hundreds of meters into the sky and spread ash across the area.

===1790 to 1934===
The earliest reliable written records date to about 1820, and the first eruption well-documented by westerners occurred in 1823. One pre-contact eruption in particular, a phreatomagmatic event in 1790, was responsible for the death of a party of warriors, part of the army of Keōua Kuahuula, the last Hawaii island chief to resist Kamehameha I&#x27;s rule; their death is evidenced by footprints preserved within the Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park - it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Kīlauea was the site of 61 separate eruptions between 1823 and 2024, making it one of Earth&#x27;s most active volcanoes.

The volume of lava expelled by Kīlauea varied widely across eruptions. After 1823 Kaluapele gradually filled, filling up under nearly continuous summit eruption, with of lava released by 1840. The period between 1840 and 1920 saw approximately half that in lava volume. In the thirty years between then and about 1950, the volcano was unusually quiet and exhibited little activity; Kīlauea&#x27;s eruptive volume increased steadily thereafter, with activity comparable to that of the early 1800s.

The length and origin of these eruptions varied. Events lasted anywhere between days and years, and occurred at a number of different sites. Activity around Kaluapele was nearly continuous for much of the 19th century, and after a reprieve between 1894 and 1907, continued until 1924.

Effusive eruptions are of relatively recent vintage there. Prior to the arrival of Europeans, Kīlauea was the site of regular explosive activity, evidenced by tribal chants.

Kīlauea erupted in 1823 and 1832, but the first major eruption after 1790 occurred in 1840, when its eastern rift zone became the site of a large, effusive Hawaiian eruption over of its length, unusually long even for a rift eruption. The eruption lasted for 26 days and produced an estimated 205 to 265 million cubic meters of lava; the light generated by the event was so intense that one could reportedly read a newspaper in Hilo at night, away.

The volcano was active again in 1868, 1877, 1884, 1885, 1894, and 1918, before its next major eruption in 1918–1919. Halemaumau, then a small upwelling in Kaluapele floor, was topped by a lava lake that then drained and refilled, forming a lava lake and nearly reaching the top edge of Kaluapele before draining once more. This activity eventually gave way to the construction of Mauna Iki, building up the lava shield on the volcano&#x27;s southwest rift zone over eight months. The eruption featured concurrent rift activity and lava fountaining.Activity in 1921–1923 followed. The next major eruption occurred in 1924. Halemaumau first drained, then quickly began sinking, deepening to nearly beneath a thick cloud of volcanic ash. Explosive activity began on May 10, blowing out rock chunks weighing as much as , and smaller fragments weighing about as far as . After a brief reprieve, the eruption intensified through a major blast on May 18, when an enormous explosive event caused the eruption&#x27;s only fatality. The eruption continued and formed numerous eruption columns above in height, declining and ending by May 28. Volcanic activity was soon confined to the summit, and ended after 1934. From 1823 to 1924, the volcano erupted 15 times, with an additional 11 subsidence events occurring at the summit.
===1952 to 1982===
After the Halemaumau event, Kīlauea remained relatively quiet, and for a time, completely silent, with activity confined to the summit. The volcano came alive again in 1952, with a lava fountain high at Halemaumau. Multiple continuous lava fountains between persisted, and the eruption lasted 136 days. Eruptions followed in 1954, 1955, and 1959, capped by a large event in 1960, when fissure-based phreatic eruption and earthquake activity gave way to a massive &quot;aā&quot; flow overran evacuated communities and resorts; the resulting summit deflation eventually caused Halemaumau to collapse even further.

After 1960 eruptive events occurred frequently until August 2018. The period 1967–1968 saw a particularly large, 80-million-cubic-meter, 251-day event from Halemaumau. In 1969 the marathon Mauna Ulu eruption was an effusive eruption that lasted from May 24, 1969, to July 24, 1974, and added of land to the island. Afterwards a magnitude 7.2 earthquake caused a partial summit collapse, after which activity paused until 1977. At the time, Mauna Ulu was the longest flank recorded eruption of any Hawaiian volcano. The eruption formed a new vent, covered a large area of land with lava, and enlarged the island. The eruption started as a fissure between two pit craters, Āloi and Alae, where the Mauna Ulu shield eventually formed. Both &quot;pāhoehoe&quot; and &quot;aā&quot; lava erupted from the volcano. Fountains of lava surged as much as 540 meters (1772 ft) into the air. In early 1973, an earthquake occurred that caused Kīlauea to briefly stop erupting near Mauna Ulu and instead erupt near the craters Pauahi and Hiiaka.

===1983–2018===
Another eruption occurred from January 1983 to September 2018. It had the longest duration of any observed eruption at this volcano. , it was the twelfth-longest duration volcanic eruption on Earth since 1750. The eruption began on January 3, 1983, along the eastern rift zone. The vent produced lava fountains that quickly built up into the Puʻu ʻŌʻō cone, sending lava flows downslope.

In 1986, activity shifted down the rift to a new vent, named Kūpaianahā, where it took on a more effusive character. Kūpaianahā built up a low, broad volcanic shield, and lava tubes fed flows extending 11 to 12 km (about 7 mi) to the sea. Between 1986 and 1991, the connection between Chain of Craters Road and Hawaii Route 130 was cut, and the community of Kapa’ahu, the village of Kalapana, and the subdivisions of Kālapana Gardens and Royal Gardens were lost to the lava. A black sand beach at Kaimū was engulfed. In 1992, the eruption moved back to Puʻu ʻŌʻō, but continued in the same manner, covering nearly all of the 1983–86 lava flows and large areas of coastline.

As of the end of 2016, the east rift zone eruption had produced of lava, covered of land, added of land to the island, destroyed 215 structures, and buried of highway under lava as thick as .

In addition to the nearly continuous activity at Puu Oo and other vents on the east rift zone, a separate eruption began at Kilauea&#x27;s summit in March 2008. On March 19, 2008, following several months of increased sulfur dioxide emissions and seismic tremor, a new vent opened at Halemaumau. Following this event, a new crater formed in the explosion, informally named the &quot;Overlook Crater,&quot; emitting a thick gas plume that obscured views into the vent. Explosive events occurred at the vent throughout 2008.

On September 5, 2008, scientists observed a lava pond deep within the Overlook Crater for the first time. Beginning in February 2010, a lava pond was visible at the bottom of the crater almost continuously through the beginning of May 2018. Lava briefly overflowed the vent onto the floor of Halemaumau in April and May 2015, October 2016, and April 2018.

====2018 eruptive episodes====
Beginning in March 2018, Hawaiian Volcano Observatory began to detect rapid inflation at Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō, leading scientists to warn that the increased pressure could form a new vent at Kilauea.

Following weeks of increased pressure, the crater floor of the cone of Puʻu ʻŌʻō collapsed on April 30, 2018, as magma migrated underground into the lower Puna region of Kilauea&#x27;s lower east rift zone. Over the next few days, hundreds of small earthquakes were detected on Kīlauea&#x27;s East rift zone, leading officials to issue evacuation warnings. On May 3, 2018, new fissures formed, and lava began erupting in lower Puna after a 5.0 earthquake earlier in the day, causing evacuations of the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions.

A seemingly related 6.9 magnitude earthquake occurred on May 4. By May 9, 27 houses had been destroyed in Leilani Estates.
By May 21, two lava flows had reached the Pacific Ocean, creating thick clouds of laze (a toxic lava and haze cloud made up of hydrochloric acid and glass particles).

By May 31, lava had destroyed 87 houses in Leilani Estates and nearby areas, accompanied by additional evacuation orders, including for the town of Kapoho. By June 4, the lava had crossed through Kapoho and entered the ocean. The confirmed number of houses lost reached 159, then two weeks later, 533, and ultimately 657. The lava lake at Halemaumau began to drop on May 2. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory warned that this increased the potential for phreatic (steam) explosions at the summit caused by interaction of magma with the underground water table, similar to the explosions that occurred at Halemaumau in 1924. These concerns prompted the closure of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. On May 17, at approximately 4:15 a.m., an explosive eruption occurred at Halemaumau, creating a plume of ash 30,000 feet into the air. This marked the beginning of a series of vigorous explosions that produced significant ash plumes from Halemaumau. These explosions, accompanied by large earthquakes and inward slumping and collapse within and around Halemaumau, continued until early August.

===2019–20: Water lake appears at the summit===
In late July 2019, a water lake appeared on the bottom of Halemaumau for the first time in over 200 years, as water from the rebounding water table began to enter the crater. The crater lake gradually grew in size. On December 1, 2020, the lake was approximately deep. Meanwhile, the temperature of the lake&#x27;s surface, as measured by a thermal camera, generally measured between . Within a month, the water lake was replaced by a lava lake during the new eruption.

===December 2020 – May 2021 summit eruption===

On December 20, 2020, at 9:30 pm local time, an eruption broke out within Halemaumau. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory reported that three vents were feeding lava into the bottom of Halemaumau Crater, boiling off the water lake that had been growing since summer 2019 and replacing it with a lava lake. The eruption produced a plume that reached in the air. The eruption was preceded by earthquake swarms centered at Kaluapele on November 30, 2020, and December 2, 2020, the second of which was interpreted as a small intrusion of magma. By the following morning, the eruption had stabilized. Two of the three vents remained active and continued to fill the floor with lava. By 7:30 a.m. on December 25, 2020, the lava lake had filled in of the crater, On January 8, 2021, depth had increased to , and by February 24 to . A spatter cone had formed around the western vent.

The eruption continued for another few months, with decreasing activity. On May 26, 2021, it was no longer erupting. Lava supply appeared to have ceased between May 11 and May 13, and the lake had crusted over by May 20. The last surface activity in Halemaumau was observed on May 23. When activity ceased, the lava lake was deep.

On August 23, 2021, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory raised Kīlauea&#x27;s alert status from &quot;Yellow/Advisory&quot; to &quot;Orange/Watch&quot; due to an earthquake swarm and a concurrent increase in ground deformation at the summit. The observatory returned Kīlauea&#x27;s alert status to &quot;Yellow/Advisory&quot; two days later.

===September 2021 summit eruption===

The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory recorded increased earthquake activity and changes in ground deformation patterns at Kīlauea&#x27;s summit at about noon local time on September 29, 2021. An eruption began at 3:20 p.m. local time when several fissures opened within Halemaumau crater. During the initial stages of the eruption, lava erupted in fountains more than tall. The fountain heights declined as the level of lava in the crater rose, partially drowning the erupting vents.

Lava continued to erupt at Halemaumau throughout the fall. Overflight measurements from October 5, 2022, indicated that of lava had been effused, and that the floor of Halemaumau had risen , since the beginning of this eruption. The eruption paused on December 9, and the alert level was reduced accordingly on December 13, 2022, though seismic activity was still unsettled.

===2023 summit eruptions===
Eruptive activity within Halemaumau resumed on January 5, 2023. The eruption ended 61 days later on March 7, 2023.

On June 7, 2023, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory detected a glow in web camera images atop Kilauea, indicating that an eruption had begun in the Halemaumau crater, within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The eruptive episode ended after twelve days on June 19, 2023.

2023&#x27;s third Halemaumau eruption episode occurred from September 10 to September 16, 2023, when multiple vents opened.

=== 2024 – 2025 eruptions ===
Shortly after midnight on June 3, 2024, an eruption occurred from a series of fissures on Kīlauea&#x27;s upper southwest rift zone. The eruption lasted about 8.5 hours.

A second eruption took place between September 15 and September 20, 2024 near and within Nāpau Crater, a pit crater located in a remote and uninhabited part of the volcano&#x27;s middle east rift. The eruption had four eruptive phases between September 15 and September 20. The final eruptive activity from a small vent west of Nāpau Crater ended at about 10 AM HST on September 20.

On December 23, 2024, an eruption began within Halemaumau. The eruption carried on into January 2025. 

==Hazards==
In 2018, the USGS National Volcanic Threat Assessment gave Kīlauea an overall threat score of 263, and ranked it first among volcanoes in the United States most likely to threaten lives and infrastructure.

===Volcanic Explosivity Index===
The Global Volcanism Program assigned a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI; the higher the number, the more explosive) to 90 of Kīlauea&#x27;s 96 known eruptions of the last 11,700 years. The eruption of 1790 received a VEI of 4. The 1983–2018 eruption was marked 3. The eruptions of 1820, 1924, 1959 and 1960 received 2s. The eruptions of 680, 1050, 1490, 1500, 1610, 1868 and four eruptions in 1961 scored a 1. The other seventy-four stayed at 0.

=== Oral traditions ===
Native Hawaiians have passed down ancient oral traditions surrounding the volcanoes ever since they settled on the islands. These oral histories provide rich cultural and geologic knowledge. In the field of volcanology, the use of oral history emerged from obscurity to become a resource for understanding the eruption history of a given region. While oral history has been used to confirm previously known geologic data, it can be used to assess hazards surrounding an eruption, in addition to guiding the rehabilitation of affected communities.

Using the oral history of the &quot;Ailāau&quot; eruption, volcanologists learned that Kīlauea was much more explosive than previously thought. Given its eruption history, the tradition predicts a long period of explosive eruptions. Hawaiian chants provided clues that surface water had been found at the summit in earlier times. The story of Pele and Hiʻiaka recorded extensive lava flows, as well as a collapse of Kaluapele in about 1500.

==Ecology==
===Background===

Because of its position more than from the nearest continental landmass, the island of Hawaii is one of the most geographically isolated landmasses; this strongly influenced its ecology. The majority of the species present on the island are endemic, the result of its isolated lineage sheltered; its ecosystem is vulnerable to invasive species and to human development–an estimated one-third of the island&#x27;s natural flora and fauna is extinct.

Kīlauea&#x27;s ecological community is further threatened by the volcano itself; lava flows often overrun and incinerate forest sections, while ash smothers local plant life. Layers of carbonized organic material at the bottom of ash deposits are evidence of this destruction. Parts of the volcano&#x27;s slopes display the dichotomy between pristine montane forest and volcanic &quot;deserts&quot; yet to be recolonized.

Kīlauea&#x27;s bulk affects local climate through the influence of trade winds coming predominantly from the northeast, which, when squeezed upwards by the volcano&#x27;s height, result in a moister windward side and an arid leeward flank. The volcano&#x27;s ecology reflects its height, and by the distribution of volcanic products, making for varied soil conditions. The northern part of Kīlauea is mostly below and receives more than mean annual rainfall, and is mostly a lowland wet community; farther south, with precipitation less than mean annual rainfall, is considered mostly a lowland dry environment.

===Ecosystems===

Much of Kīlauea&#x27;s southern section lies within the national park. It offers &quot;ae&quot; ferns, &quot;ʻōhiʻa&quot; trees (&quot;Metrosideros polymorpha&quot;), and &quot;hapu’u&quot; of genus &quot;Cibotium&quot; are common. The park hosts many bird species, including the &quot;apapane&quot; (&quot;Himatione sanguinea&quot;); &quot;amakihi&quot; (&quot;Hemignathus virens&quot;); &quot;iiwi&quot; (&quot;Vestiaria coccinea&quot;); &quot;‘ōma’o&quot; (&quot;Myadestes obscurus&quot;), &quot;ʻelepaio&quot; (&quot;Chasiempis sp.&quot;); and the endangered &quot;akepa&quot; (&quot;Loxops coccineus&quot;), &quot;akiapolaau&quot; (&quot;Hemignathus munroi&quot;), &quot;nēnē&quot; (&quot;Branta sandvicensis&quot;), &quot;ʻuaʻu&quot; (&quot;Pterodroma sandwichensis&quot;), and &quot;ʻio&quot; (&quot;Buteo solitarius&quot;) species. The coast hosts three of the island&#x27;s nine known critically endangered hawksbill sea turtle (&quot;Eretmochelys imbricata&quot;) nesting sites.

Some of the area alongside the southwestern rift zone takes the form of the Kaʻū Desert. Although not a &quot;true&quot; desert (rainfall there exceeds the maximum a year), precipitation mixing with drifting volcanic sulfur dioxide forms acid rain with a pH as low as 3.4, greatly hampering plant growth. The deposited tephra particulates make the local soil very permeable. Plant life there is practically nonexistent.

Kīlauea&#x27;s northern lowland wet-forest ecosystem is partially protected by the Puna Forest Reserve and the Kahauale`a Natural Area Reserve. At , Wao Kele o Puna is Hawaii&#x27;s largest lowland wet forest reserve, and is home to rare plant species including &quot;hāpuu&quot; ferns (&quot;Cibotium&quot; spp.), &quot;ieie&quot; vines (&quot;Freycinetia arborea&quot;), and &quot;kōpiko&quot; (&quot;Psychotria mariniana&quot;), some of which play a role in limiting invasive species&#x27; spread. &quot;Opeapea&quot; (&quot;Lasiurus cinereus semotus&quot;) &quot;io&quot; (&quot;Buteo solitarius&quot;), common &quot;amakihi&quot; (&quot;Hemignathus virens&quot;), and &quot;nananana makakii&quot; (&quot;Theridion grallator&quot;) live in the trees. Many more as-yet-undocumented species are thought to lie within the forest. Wao Kele&#x27;s primary forest tree is &quot;ōhia lehua&quot; (&quot;Metrosideros polymorpha&quot;).
==Human history==
===Ancient Hawaiian===
The first Ancient Hawaiians to arrive on Hawaii island lived along the shores, where food and water were plentiful. Flightless birds that had previously known no predators became a staple food source. Early settlements had a major impact on the local ecosystem, and caused many extinctions, particularly bird species, while introducing foreign plants and animals and increasing erosion rates. The prevailing lowland forest ecosystem was transformed from forest to grassland; some caused by their use of fire, but the main cause appears to have been the Polynesian rat (&quot;Rattus exulans&quot;).

The summits of the island&#x27;s volcanoes are revered as sacred mountains. In one Hawaiian mythology, sky father Wākea marries earth mother Papa, giving birth to the islands. Kīlauea itself means &quot;spewing&quot; or &quot;much spreading&quot; in Hawaiian, and Kīlauea is the body of the deity Pele, goddess of fire, lightning, wind, and volcanoes. The conflict between Pele and the rain god Kamapuaa was centered there; Halemaumau, &quot;House of the amaumau fern&quot;, derives its name from the struggle between the two gods. Kamapuaa, hard-pressed by Pele&#x27;s ability to make lava spout from the ground at will, covered the feature, a favorite residence of the goddess, with fern fronds. Choked by trapped smoke, Pele emerged. Realizing that each could threaten the other with destruction, the other gods called a draw and divided the island between them, with Kamapuaa getting the moist windward northeastern side, and Pele directing the drier Kona (or leeward) side. The rusty singed appearance of the young fronds of the amaumau are said to be a product of the legendary struggle.

===Modern era===

The first foreigner to arrive at Hawaii was James Cook in 1778. The first non-native to observe Kīlauea in detail was William Ellis, an English missionary who in 1823 spent more than two weeks trekking across the volcano. He collated the first written account of the volcano and observed many of its features.

Another missionary, C. S. Stewart, U.S.N., wrote of it in his journal &quot;A Residence in the Sandwich Island&quot;, which Letitia Elizabeth Landon quoted from in the notes to her poetical illustration to an engraving of a painting by William Ellis after F Howard, &quot;The Volcano of Ki-Rau-E-A&quot; in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1832.

One of the earliest and most important surveyors of Kīlauea was James Dwight Dana, who studied and wrote about the island&#x27;s volcanoes for decades first-hand. Dana visited Kīlauea&#x27;s summit in 1840. After publishing a summary paper in 1852, he directed a detailed geological study of the island in 1880 and 1881. He did not consider Kīlauea a separate volcano, instead referring to it as a flank vent of Mauna Loa; geologist C. E. Dutton elaborated on Dana&#x27;s research during an 1884 expedition. His work led Kīlauea to be accepted as a separate entity.

=== Hawaiian Volcano Observatory ===

The next era of Kīlauea&#x27;s history began with the establishment of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory in 1912. The first permanent such installation in the United States, the observatory was the brainchild of Thomas Jaggar, head of geology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After witnessing the devastation of the 1908 Messina earthquake near Mount Etna in Italy, he declared that systematic volcanic and seismic study was required, and chose Kīlauea as the initial site. After securing funding from MIT and the University of Hawaiʻi, Jaggar served as director of the observatory between 1912 and 1940. He pioneered seismological and observational study and observation of the volcano. After initial funding ran out, the Observatory was funded by the National Weather Service, USGS, and the National Park Service in turn. USGS reclaimed the observatory and funded it after 1946. The main building moved twice since establishment, and today sits on the northwest rim of Kaluapele.

NASA used the area to train Apollo Astronauts in recognizing volcanic features, planning traverses, collecting samples and taking photographs. Training took place in April 1969, April 1970, December 1970, December 1971, and June 1972. Astronauts of Apollo 12, Apollo 14, Apollo 15, Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 used this training on the Moon. Notable geologist instructors included William R. Muehlberger.

==Research==
In October 2019, January 2020, and December 2020, USGFS volcanologists used a drone to study gases inside the water lake at the summit, as it was too dangerous for humans to approach. After the lake boiled away, they used the drone to study the resulting gas plumes.

In 2022, researchers reported that Kīlauea&#x27;s seismic waves could be used to predict future outbreaks. These waves can last for tens of seconds. After the 2007 eruption ended, they analyzed thousands of events from seismic sensors, GPS stations, and lake height observations, including variables such as temperature and gas bubble density. They reported that magma temperature was associated with seismic signal duration and bubble quantity and composition.

==Tourism==

Kīlauea became a tourist attraction in the 1840s, and businessmen such as Benjamin Pitman and George Lycurgus operated a series of hotels at the rim, including Volcano House, which is the only hotel or restaurant located within Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park.

In 1891, Lorrin A. Thurston, investor in hotels along the volcano&#x27;s rim, began campaigning for a park, boosting an idea proposed by William Richards Castle, Jr. in 1903. Thurston, who owned the Honolulu Advertiser newspaper, printed editorials in favor of the idea; by 1911 Governor Walter F. Frear had proposed a draft bill to create &quot;Kilauea National Park&quot;. Following endorsements from John Muir, Henry Cabot Lodge, and former President Theodore Roosevelt (in opposition to local ranchers) and several legislative attempts introduced by delegate Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, House Resolution 9525 was signed into law by Woodrow Wilson on August 1, 1916. It was the country&#x27;s 11th National Park, and the first in a Territory. Originally called &quot;Hawaii National Park&quot;, it was split from Haleakala National Park on September 22, 1960. Today, the park, renamed the Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park, is a major conservatory agency and tourist attraction, and, since 1987, a World Heritage Site.

Hawaii tourism grew slowly before exploding with the advent of jet airliner travel around 1959. Kīlauea, as one of the few chronically erupting volcanoes, was a major part of the island&#x27;s tourist draw. According to the National Park Service, Kīlauea is visited by roughly 2.6 million people annually. The Thomas A. Jaggar Museum was a popular tourist stop. Located at the edge of Kaluapele, the museum&#x27;s observation deck offered the best sheltered view on the volcano of the activity at Halemaumau; however, the museum closed indefinitely after the building housing sustaining structural damage from earthquakes associated with the 2018 eruptions.

Volcano House provides lodging within the park, while additional housing options are available in the Volcano Village. Visitors associated with the military can find lodging at the Kilauea Military Camp. The park provides hiking trails, points of interest, and guided ranger programs. The Crater Rim Trail around the volcano is designated as a National Recreation Trail.

<doc id="350668" wikidata="Q847163" url="?curid=350668" title="Cobb–Douglas production function">
<text>In economics and econometrics, the Cobb–Douglas production function is a particular functional form of the production function, widely used to represent the technological relationship between the amounts of two or more inputs (particularly physical capital and labor) and the amount of output that can be produced by those inputs. The Cobb–Douglas form was developed and tested against statistical evidence by Charles Cobb and Paul Douglas between 1927 and 1947; according to Douglas, the functional form itself was developed earlier by Philip Wicksteed.

== Formulation ==
In its most standard form for production of a single good with two factors, the function is given by:

: formula_1

where:
* &quot;Y&quot; = total production (the real value of all goods produced in a year or 365.25 days)
* &quot;L&quot; = labour input (person-hours worked in a year or 365.25 days)
* &quot;K&quot; = capital input (a measure of all machinery, equipment, and buildings; the value of capital input divided by the price of capital)
* &quot;A&quot; = total factor productivity
* formula_2 and formula_3 are the output elasticities of capital and labor, respectively. These values are constants determined by available technology.

Capital and labour are the two &quot;factors of production&quot; of the Cobb–Douglas production function.

== History ==
Paul Douglas explained that his first formulation of the Cobb–Douglas production function was developed in 1927; when seeking a functional form to relate estimates he had calculated for workers and capital, he spoke with mathematician and colleague Charles Cobb, who suggested a function of the form , previously used by Knut Wicksell, Philip Wicksteed, and Léon Walras, although Douglas only acknowledges Wicksteed and Walras for their contributions. Not long after Knut Wicksell&#x27;s death in 1926, Paul Douglas and Charles Cobb implemented the Cobb–Douglas function in their work covering the subject manner of producer theory for the first time. Estimating this using least squares, he obtained a result for the exponent of labour of 0.75—which was subsequently confirmed by the National Bureau of Economic Research to be 0.741. Later work in the 1940s prompted them to allow for the exponents on &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; to vary, resulting in estimates that subsequently proved to be very close to improved measure of productivity developed at that time.

A major criticism at the time was that estimates of the production function, although seemingly accurate, were based on such sparse data that it was hard to give them much credibility. Douglas remarked &quot;I must admit I was discouraged by this criticism and thought of giving up the effort, but there was something which told me I should hold on.&quot; The breakthrough came in using US census data, which was cross-sectional and provided a large number of observations. Douglas presented the results of these findings, along with those for other countries, at his 1947 address as president of the American Economic Association. Shortly afterwards, Douglas went into politics and was stricken by ill health—resulting in little further development on his side. However, two decades later, his production function was widely used, being adopted by economists such as Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow. The Cobb–Douglas production function is especially notable for being the first time an aggregate or economy-wide production function had been developed, estimated, and then presented to the profession for analysis; it marked a landmark change in how economists approached macroeconomics from a microeconomics perspective.

== Positivity of marginal products ==

The marginal product of a factor of production is the change in output when that factor of production changes, holding constant all the other factors of production as well as the total factor productivity.

The marginal product of capital, formula_4 corresponds to the first derivative of the production function with respect to capital:

: formula_5

Because formula_6 (and formula_7 as well), we find out that the marginal product of capital is always positive; that is, increasing capital leads to an increase in output.

We also find that increasing the total factor productivity formula_8 increases the marginal product of capital.

An analogous reasoning holds for labor.

== Law of diminishing returns ==

Taking the derivative of the marginal product of capital with respect to capital (i.e., taking the second derivative of the production function with respect to capital), we have:

: formula_9

Because formula_10, then formula_11 and so formula_12.

Thus, this function satisfies the law of &quot;diminishing returns&quot;; that is, the marginal product of capital, while always positive, is declining. As capital increases (holding labor and total factor productivity constant), the output increases but at a diminishing rate.

A similar reasoning holds for labor.

== Cross derivatives ==

We can study what happens to the marginal product of capital when labor increases by taking the partial derivative of the marginal product of capital with respect to labor, that is, the cross-derivative of output with respect to capital and labor:

formula_13

Since formula_14, an increase in labor raises the marginal product of capital.

== Returns to scale ==

Output elasticity measures the responsiveness of output to a change in levels of either labor or capital used in production, ceteris paribus. For example, if , a increase in capital usage would lead to approximately a increase in output.

Sometimes the term has a more restricted meaning, requiring that the function display constant returns to scale, meaning that increasing capital &quot;K&quot; and labor &quot;L&quot; by a factor &quot;k&quot; also increases output &quot;Y&quot; by the same factor, that is, formula_15. This holds if formula_16.

If formula_17, then returns to scale are decreasing, meaning that an increase of capital &quot;K&quot; and labor &quot;L&quot; by a factor &quot;k&quot; will produce an increase in output &quot;Y&quot; smaller than a factor &quot;k&quot;, that is formula_18.

If formula_19, then returns to scale are increasing, meaning that an increase in capital &quot;K&quot; and labor &quot;L&quot; by a factor &quot;k&quot; produce an increase in output &quot;Y&quot; greater than a factor &quot;k&quot;, that is, formula_20.

== Remuneration under perfect competition ==

Under perfect competition, the factors of production are remunerated at their total marginal product.

The marginal product of capital is given by: formula_21. This is the remuneration for each unit of capital. To find out the remuneration for the total capital, we multiply this quantity by formula_22:

formula_23.

So a share formula_24 of the output will remunerate capital.

By a similar reasoning, we can find out that a share formula_25 of the output will remunerate labor.

Those shares add up to 100% of the output only if formula_16.

== Generalized form ==

In its generalized form, the Cobb–Douglas function models more than two goods. The Cobb–Douglas function may be written as

:formula_27

where
* &quot;A&quot; is an efficiency parameter
* &quot;n&quot; is the total number of input variables (goods)
* are the (non-negative) quantities of good consumed, produced, etc.
* formula_28 is an elasticity parameter for good &quot;i&quot;

== Criticisms ==

The function has been criticised for its lack of foundation. Cobb and Douglas were influenced by statistical evidence that appeared to show that labor and capital shares of total output were constant over time in developed countries; they explained this by statistical fitting least-squares regression of their production function. It is now widely accepted that labor share is declining in industrialized economies. The production function contains a principal assumption that may not always provide the most accurate representation of a country&#x27;s productive capabilities and supply-side efficiencies. This assumption is a &quot;constant share of labor in output,&quot; which may not be effective when applied to cases of countries whose labor markets are growing at significant rates. Another issue within the fundamental composition the Cobb–Douglas production function is the presence of simultaneous equation bias. When competition is presumed, the simultaneous equation bias has impact on all function types involving firm decisions – including the Cobb–Douglas function. In some cases this simultaneous equation bias doesn&#x27;t appear. However, it is apparent when least squares asymptotic approximations are used.

The Cobb–Douglas production function was not developed on the basis of any knowledge of engineering, technology, or management of the production process. This rationale may be true given the definition of the Capital term. Labor hours and Capital need a better definition. If capital is defined as a building, labor is already included in the development of that building. A building is composed of commodities, labor and risks and general conditions. It was instead developed because it had attractive mathematical characteristics, such as diminishing marginal returns to either factor of production and the property that the optimal expenditure shares on any given input of a firm operating a Cobb–Douglas technology are constant. Initially, there were no utility foundations for it. In the modern era, some economists try to build models up from individual agents acting, rather than imposing a functional form on an entire economy. The Cobb–Douglas production function, if properly defined, can be applied at a micro-economic level, up to a macro- economic level.

However, many modern authors have developed models which give microeconomically based Cobb–Douglas production functions, including many New Keynesian models. It is nevertheless a mathematical mistake to assume that just because the Cobb–Douglas function applies at the microeconomic level, it also always applies at the macroeconomic level. Similarly, it is not necessarily the case that a macro Cobb–Douglas applies at the disaggregated level. An early microfoundation of the aggregate Cobb–Douglas technology based on linear activities is derived in Houthakker (1955). The Cobb–Douglas production function is inconsistent with modern empirical estimates of the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor, which suggest that capital and labor are gross complements. A 2021 meta-analysis of 3186 estimates concludes that &quot;the weight of evidence accumulated in the empirical literature emphatically rejects the Cobb–Douglas specification.&quot;

== Cobb–Douglas utilities ==
The Cobb–Douglas function is often used as a utility function. Utility formula_29 is a function of the quantities formula_30 of the formula_31 goods consumed:

:formula_32

Utility functions represent ordinal preferences and do not have natural units, unlike production functions. As the result, a monotonic transformation of a utility function represents the same preferences. Unlike with a Cobb–Douglas production function, where the sum of the exponents determines the degree of economies of scale, the sum can be normalized to one for a utility function because normalization is a monotonic transformation of the original utility function. Thus, let us define formula_33 and formula_34, so formula_35, and write the utility function as:
:formula_36

The consumer maximizes utility subject to the budget constraint that the cost of the goods is less than her wealth formula_37. Letting formula_38 denote the goods&#x27; prices, she solves:

:formula_39
:The Marginal Rate of Substitution between each two goods is 
:formula_40
:By inserting to the budget constrain we obtain
:formula_41
:formula_42
:formula_43

Note that formula_44, the consumer spends fraction formula_45 of her wealth on good . 

Also note that each good is affected solely by its own price. That is, any two goods are not substitute goods nor complementary goods. Namely, their cross elasticity equals to zero and the cross demand function of any good is described by a vertical line. 

Finally, note that when the income increase by some percent the demand for the good increase by the same percent. That is, the elasticity of the demand with respect to income equals 1 and therefore, the Engel curve is a straight line starting from the origin. 

Note that this is the solution for either formula_46 or formula_47 since the same preferences generate the same demand. 

The indirect utility function can be calculated by substituting the demands formula_30 into the utility function. Define the constant formula_49 and we get:

:formula_50

which is a special case of the Gorman polar form. The expenditure function is the inverse of the indirect utility function:

:formula_51
:The Marshallian demand function that Cobb-Douglas utility function 

== Various representations of the production function ==
The Cobb–Douglas function form can be estimated as a linear relationship using the following expression:

:formula_52
where
* formula_53
* formula_54
* formula_55

The model can also be written as
:formula_56

As noted, the common Cobb–Douglas function used in macroeconomic modeling is
:formula_57

where &quot;K&quot; is capital and &quot;L&quot; is labor. When the model exponents sum to one, the production function is first-order homogeneous, which implies constant returns to scale—that is, if all inputs are scaled by a common factor greater than zero, output will be scaled by the same factor.

== Relationship to the CES production function ==
The constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function (in the two-factor case) is

:formula_58

in which the limiting case corresponds to a Cobb–Douglas function, formula_59 with constant returns to scale.

To see this, the log of the CES function:

: formula_60

can be taken to the limit by applying L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule:

:formula_61

Therefore, formula_62.

=== Translog production function ===
The translog production function is an approximation of the CES function by a second-order Taylor polynomial in the variable formula_63 about formula_64, i.e. the Cobb–Douglas case. The name translog stands for &quot;transcendental logarithmic.&quot; It is often used in econometrics for the fact that it is linear in the parameters, which means ordinary least squares could be used if inputs could be assumed exogenous.

In the two-factor case above the translog production function is
: formula_65
where formula_66, formula_67, formula_68, formula_69, and formula_70 are defined appropriately. In the three factor case, the translog production function is:
:formula_71
where formula_8 = total factor productivity, formula_73 = labor, formula_22 = capital, formula_75 = materials and supplies, and formula_76 = output.

<doc id="350672" wikidata="Q845691" url="?curid=350672" title="Logicism">
<text>In the philosophy of mathematics, logicism is a programme comprising one or more of the theses that – for some coherent meaning of &#x27;logic&#x27; – mathematics is an extension of logic, some or all of mathematics is reducible to logic, or some or all of mathematics may be modelled in logic. Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead championed this programme, initiated by Gottlob Frege and subsequently developed by Richard Dedekind and Giuseppe Peano.

== Overview ==
Dedekind&#x27;s path to logicism had a turning point when he was able to construct a model satisfying the axioms characterizing the real numbers using certain sets of rational numbers. This and related ideas convinced him that arithmetic, algebra and analysis were reducible to the natural numbers plus a &quot;logic&quot; of classes. Furthermore by 1872 he had concluded that the naturals themselves were reducible to sets and mappings. It is likely that other logicists, most importantly Frege, were also guided by the new theories of the real numbers published in the year 1872. 

The philosophical impetus behind Frege&#x27;s logicist programme from the &quot;Grundlagen der Arithmetik&quot; onwards was in part his dissatisfaction with the epistemological and ontological commitments of then-extant accounts of the natural numbers, and his conviction that Kant&#x27;s use of truths about the natural numbers as examples of synthetic a priori truth was incorrect.

This started a period of expansion for logicism, with Dedekind and Frege as its main exponents. However, this initial phase of the logicist programme was brought into crisis with the discovery of the classical paradoxes of set theory (Cantor&#x27;s 1896, Zermelo and Russell&#x27;s 1900–1901). Frege gave up on the project after Russell recognized and communicated his paradox identifying an inconsistency in Frege&#x27;s system set out in the Grundgesetze der Arithmetik. Note that naive set theory also suffers from this difficulty. 

On the other hand, Russell wrote &quot;The Principles of Mathematics&quot; in 1903 using the paradox and developments of Giuseppe Peano&#x27;s school of geometry. Since he treated the subject of primitive notions in geometry and set theory
as well as the calculus of relations, this text is a watershed in the development of logicism. Evidence of the assertion of logicism was collected by Russell and Whitehead in their &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;.

Today, the bulk of extant mathematics is believed to be derivable logically from a small number of extralogical axioms, such as the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (or its extension ZFC), from which no inconsistencies have as yet been derived. Thus, elements of the logicist programmes have proved viable, but in the process theories of classes, sets and mappings, and higher-order logics other than with Henkin semantics have come to be regarded as extralogical in nature, in part under the influence of Quine&#x27;s later thought.

Kurt Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems show that no formal system from which the Peano axioms for the natural numbers may be derived – such as Russell&#x27;s systems in PM – can decide all the well-formed sentences of that system. This result damaged David Hilbert&#x27;s programme for foundations of mathematics whereby &#x27;infinitary&#x27; theories – such as that of PM – were to be proved consistent from finitary theories, with the aim that those uneasy about &#x27;infinitary methods&#x27; could be reassured that their use should provably not result in the derivation of a contradiction. Gödel&#x27;s result suggests that in order to maintain a logicist position, while still retaining as much as possible of classical mathematics, one must accept some axiom of infinity as part of logic. On the face of it, this damages the logicist programme also, albeit only for those already doubtful concerning &#x27;infinitary methods&#x27;. Nonetheless, positions deriving from both logicism and from Hilbertian finitism have continued to be propounded since the publication of Gödel&#x27;s result.

One argument that programmes derived from logicism remain valid might be that the incompleteness theorems are &#x27;proved with logic just like any other theorems&#x27;. However, that argument appears not to acknowledge the distinction between theorems of first-order logic and theorems of higher-order logic. The former can be proven using finistic methods, while the latter – in general – cannot. Tarski&#x27;s undefinability theorem shows that Gödel numbering can be used to prove syntactical constructs, but not semantic assertions. Therefore, the claim that logicism remains a valid programme may commit one to holding that a system of proof based on the existence and properties of the natural numbers is less convincing than one based on some particular formal system.

Logicism – especially through the influence of Frege on Russell and Wittgenstein and later Dummett – was a significant contributor to the development of analytic philosophy during the twentieth century.

== Origin of the name &#x27;logicism&#x27; ==
Ivor Grattan-Guinness states that the French word &#x27;Logistique&#x27; was &quot;introduced by Couturat and others at the 1904 International Congress of Philosophy, and was used by Russell and others from then on, in versions appropriate for various languages.&quot; (G-G 2000:501).

Apparently the first (and only) usage by Russell appeared in his 1919: &quot;Russell referred several time [sic] to Frege, introducing him as one &#x27;who first succeeded in &quot;logicising&quot; mathematics&#x27; (p. 7). Apart from the misrepresentation (which Russell partly rectified by explaining his own view of the role of arithmetic in mathematics), the passage is notable for the word which he put in quotation marks, but their presence suggests nervousness, and he never used the word again, so that &#x27;logicism&#x27; did not emerge until the later 1920s&quot; (G-G 2002:434).

About the same time as Rudolf Carnap (1929), but apparently independently, Fraenkel (1928) used the word: &quot;Without comment he used the name &#x27;logicism&#x27; to characterise the Whitehead/Russell position (in the title of the section on p. 244, explanation on p. 263)&quot; (G-G 2002:269). Carnap used a slightly different word &#x27;Logistik&#x27;; Behmann complained about its use in Carnap&#x27;s manuscript so Carnap proposed the word &#x27;Logizismus&#x27;, but he finally stuck to his word-choice &#x27;Logistik&#x27; (G-G 2002:501). Ultimately &quot;the spread was mainly due to Carnap, from 1930 onwards.&quot; (G-G 2000:502).

==Intent, or goal, of logicism==
The overt intent of logicism is to derive all of mathematics from symbolic logic (Frege, Dedekind, Peano, Russell.) As contrasted with algebraic logic (Boolean logic) that employs arithmetic concepts, symbolic logic begins with a very reduced set of marks (non-arithmetic symbols), a few &quot;logical&quot; axioms that embody the &quot;laws of thought&quot;, and rules of inference that dictate how the marks are to be assembled and manipulated – for instance substitution and &quot;modus ponens&quot; (i.e. from [1] &quot;A&quot; materially implies &quot;B&quot; and [2] &quot;A&quot;, one may derive &quot;B&quot;). Logicism also adopts from Frege&#x27;s groundwork the reduction of natural language statements from &quot;subject|predicate&quot; into either propositional &quot;atoms&quot; or the &quot;argument|function&quot; of &quot;generalization&quot;—the notions &quot;all&quot;, &quot;some&quot;, &quot;class&quot; (collection, aggregate) and &quot;relation&quot;.

In a logicist derivation of the natural numbers and their properties, no &quot;intuition&quot; of number should &quot;sneak in&quot; either as an axiom or by accident. The goal is to derive all of mathematics, starting with the counting numbers and then the real numbers, from some chosen &quot;laws of thought&quot; alone, without any tacit assumptions of &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; or &quot;less&quot; and &quot;more&quot; or to the point: &quot;successor&quot; and &quot;predecessor&quot;. Gödel 1944 summarized Russell&#x27;s logicistic &quot;constructions&quot;, when compared to &quot;constructions&quot; in the foundational systems of Intuitionism and Formalism (&quot;the Hilbert School&quot;) as follows: &quot;Both of these schools base their constructions on a mathematical intuition whose avoidance is exactly one of the principal aims of Russell&#x27;s constructivism&quot; (Gödel 1944 in &quot;Collected Works&quot; 1990:119).

=== History ===
Gödel 1944 summarized the historical background from Leibniz&#x27;s in &quot;Characteristica universalis&quot;, through Frege and Peano to Russell: &quot;Frege was chiefly interested in the analysis of thought and used his calculus in the first place for deriving arithmetic from pure logic&quot;, whereas Peano &quot;was more interested in its applications within mathematics&quot;. But &quot;It was only [Russell&#x27;s] &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; that full use was made of the new method for actually deriving large parts of mathematics from a very few logical concepts and axioms. In addition, the young science was enriched by a new instrument, the abstract theory of relations&quot; (p. 120-121).

Kleene 1952 states it this way: &quot;Leibniz (1666) first conceived of logic as a science containing the ideas and principles underlying all other sciences. Dedekind (1888) and Frege (1884, 1893, 1903) were engaged in defining mathematical notions in terms of logical ones, and Peano (1889, 1894–1908) in expressing mathematical theorems in a logical symbolism&quot; (p. 43); in the previous paragraph he includes Russell and Whitehead as exemplars of the &quot;logicistic school&quot;, the other two &quot;foundational&quot; schools being the intuitionistic and the &quot;formalistic or axiomatic school&quot; (p. 43).

Frege 1879 describes his intent in the Preface to his 1879 &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot;: He started with a consideration of arithmetic: did it derive from &quot;logic&quot; or from &quot;facts of experience&quot;?
:&quot;I first had to ascertain how far one could proceed in arithmetic by means of inferences alone, with the sole support of those laws of thought that transcend all particulars. My initial step was to attempt to reduce the concept of ordering in a sequence to that of &quot;logical&quot; consequence, so as to proceed from there to the concept of number. To prevent anything intuitive from penetrating here unnoticed I had to bend every effort to keep the chain of inferences free of gaps . . . I found the inadequacy of language to be an obstacle; no matter how unwieldy the expressions I was ready to accept, I was less and less able, as the relations became more and more complex, to attain the precision that my purpose required. This deficiency led me to the idea of the present ideography. Its first purpose, therefore, is to provide us with the most reliable test of the validity of a chain of inferences and to point out every presupposition that tries to sneak in unnoticed&quot; (Frege 1879 in van Heijenoort 1967:5).

Dedekind 1887 describes his intent in the 1887 Preface to the First Edition of his &quot;The Nature and Meaning of Numbers&quot;. He believed that in the &quot;foundations of the simplest science; viz., that part of logic which deals with the theory of numbers&quot; had not been properly argued – &quot;nothing capable of proof ought to be accepted without proof&quot;:
:In speaking of arithmetic (algebra, analysis) as a part of logic I mean to imply that I consider the number-concept entirely independent of the notions of intuitions of space and time, that I consider it an immediate result from the laws of thought . . . numbers are free creations of the human mind . . . [and] only through the purely logical process of building up the science of numbers . . . are we prepared accurately to investigate our notions of space and time by bringing them into relation with this number-domain created in our mind&quot; (Dedekind 1887 Dover republication 1963 :31).

Peano 1889 states his intent in his Preface to his 1889 &quot;Principles of Arithmetic&quot;:
:Questions that pertain to the foundations of mathematics, although treated by many in recent times, still lack a satisfactory solution. The difficulty has its main source in the ambiguity of language. ¶ That is why it is of the utmost importance to examine attentively the very words we use. My goal has been to undertake this examination&quot; (Peano 1889 in van Heijenoort 1967:85).

Russell 1903 describes his intent in the Preface to his 1903 &quot;Principles of Mathematics&quot;:
:&quot;THE present work has two main objects. One of these, the &quot;proof&quot; that all pure mathematics deals exclusively with concepts definable in terms of a very small number of fundamental logical concepts, and that all its propositions are deducible from a very small number of fundamental logical principles&quot; (Preface 1903:vi).

:&quot;A few words as to the origin of the present work may serve to show the importance of the questions discussed. About six years ago, I began an investigation into the philosophy of Dynamics. . . . [From two questions – acceleration and absolute motion in a &quot;relational theory of space&quot;] I was led to a re-examination of the principles of Geometry, thence to the philosophy of continuity and infinity, and then, with a view to discovering the meaning of the word &quot;any&quot;, to Symbolic Logic&quot; (Preface 1903:vi-vii).

==Epistemology, ontology and logicism==
The epistemologies of Dedekind and of Frege seem less well-defined than that of Russell, but both seem accepting as &quot;a priori&quot; the customary &quot;laws of thought&quot; concerning simple propositional statements (usually of belief); these laws would be sufficient in themselves if augmented with theory of classes and relations (e.g. &quot;x&quot; R &quot;y&quot;) between individuals &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; linked by the generalization R.

Dedekind&#x27;s argument begins with &quot;1. In what follows I understand by &quot;thing&quot; every object of our thought&quot;; we humans use symbols to discuss these &quot;things&quot; of our minds; &quot;A thing is completely determined by all that can be affirmed or thought concerning it&quot; (p. 44). In a subsequent paragraph Dedekind discusses what a &quot;system &quot;S&quot; is: it is an aggregate, a manifold, a totality of associated elements (things) &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;&quot;; he asserts that &quot;such a system &quot;S&quot; . . . &quot;as an object of our thought is likewise a thing&quot; (1); it is completely determined when with respect to every thing it is determined whether it is an element of &quot;S&quot; or not.*&quot; (p. 45, italics added). The * indicates a footnote where he states that:
:&quot;Kronecker not long ago (&quot;Crelle&#x27;s Journal&quot;, Vol. 99, pp. 334-336) has endeavored to impose certain limitations upon the free formation of concepts in mathematics which I do not believe to be justified&quot; (p. 45).
Indeed he awaits Kronecker&#x27;s &quot;publishing his reasons for the necessity or merely the expediency of these limitations&quot; (p. 45).

Kronecker, famous for his assertion that &quot;God made the integers, all else is the work of man&quot; had his foes, among them Hilbert. Hilbert called Kronecker a &quot;&quot;dogmatist&quot;, to the extent that he accepts the integer with its essential properties as a dogma and does not look back&quot; and equated his extreme constructivist stance with that of Brouwer&#x27;s intuitionism, accusing both of &quot;subjectivism&quot;: &quot;It is part of the task of science to liberate us from arbitrariness, sentiment and habit and to protect us from the subjectivism that already made itself felt in Kronecker&#x27;s views and, it seems to me, finds its culmination in intuitionism&quot;. Hilbert then states that &quot;mathematics is a presuppositionless science. To found it I do not need God, as does Kronecker . . .&quot; (p. 479).

Russell&#x27;s realism served him as an antidote to British idealism, with portions borrowed from European rationalism and British empiricism. To begin with, &quot;Russell was a realist about two key issues: universals and material objects&quot; (Russell 1912:xi). For Russell, tables are real things that exist independent of Russell the observer. Rationalism would contribute the notion of &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge, while empiricism would contribute the role of experiential knowledge (induction from experience). Russell would credit Kant with the idea of &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge, but he offers an objection to Kant he deems &quot;fatal&quot;: &quot;The facts [of the world] must always conform to logic and arithmetic. To say that logic and arithmetic are contributed by us does not account for this&quot; (1912:87); Russell concludes that the &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge that we possess is &quot;about things, and not merely about thoughts&quot; (1912:89). And in this Russell&#x27;s epistemology seems different from that of Dedekind&#x27;s belief that &quot;numbers are free creations of the human mind&quot; (Dedekind 1887:31)

But his epistemology about the innate (he prefers the word &quot;a priori&quot; when applied to logical principles, cf. 1912:74) is intricate. He would strongly, unambiguously express support for the Platonic &quot;universals&quot; (cf. 1912:91-118) and he would conclude that truth and falsity are &quot;out there&quot;; minds create &quot;beliefs&quot; and what makes a belief true is a fact, &quot;and this fact does not (except in exceptional cases) involve the mind of the person who has the belief&quot; (1912:130).

Where did Russell derive these epistemic notions? He tells us in the Preface to his 1903 &quot;Principles of Mathematics&quot;. Note that he asserts that the belief: &quot;Emily is a rabbit&quot; is non-existent, and yet the truth of this non-existent proposition is independent of any knowing mind; if Emily really is a rabbit, the fact of this truth exists whether or not Russell or any other mind is alive or dead, and the relation of Emily to rabbit-hood is &quot;ultimate&quot;:
:&quot;On fundamental questions of philosophy, my position, in all its chief features, is derived from Mr G. E. Moore. I have accepted from him the nature of propositions (except such as happen to assert existence) and their independence of any knowing mind; also the pluralism which regards the world, both that of existents and that of entities, as composed of an infinite number of mutually independent entities, with relations which are ultimate, and not reducible to adjectives of their terms or of the whole which these compose. . . . The doctrines just mentioned are, in my opinion, quite indispensable to any even tolerably satisfactory philosophy of mathematics, as I hope the following pages will show. . . . Formally, my premisses are simply assumed; but the fact that they allow mathematics to be true, which most current philosophies do not, is surely a powerful argument in their favour.&quot; (Preface 1903:viii)

In 1902 Russell discovered a &quot;vicious circle&quot; (Russell&#x27;s paradox) in Frege&#x27;s &quot;Grundgesetze der Arithmetik&quot;, derived from Frege&#x27;s Basic Law V and he was determined not to repeat it in his 1903 &quot;Principles of Mathematics&quot;. In two Appendices added at the last minute he devoted 28 pages to both a detailed analysis of Frege&#x27;s theory contrasted against his own, and a fix for the paradox. But he was not optimistic about the outcome:

:&quot;In the case of classes, I must confess, I have failed to perceive any concept fulfilling the conditions requisite for the notion of class. And the contradiction discussed in Chapter x. proves that something is amiss, but what this is I have hitherto failed to discover. (Preface to Russell 1903:vi)&quot;

Gödel in his 1944 would disagree with the young Russell of 1903 (&quot;[my premisses] allow mathematics to be true&quot;) but would probably agree with Russell&#x27;s statement quoted above (&quot;something is amiss&quot;); Russell&#x27;s theory had failed to arrive at a satisfactory foundation of mathematics: the result was &quot;essentially negative; i.e. the classes and concepts introduced this way do not have all the properties required for the use of mathematics&quot; (Gödel 1944:132).

How did Russell arrive in this situation? Gödel observes that Russell is a surprising &quot;realist&quot; with a twist: he cites Russell&#x27;s 1919:169 &quot;Logic is concerned with the real world just as truly as zoology&quot; (Gödel 1944:120). But he observes that &quot;when he started on a concrete problem, the objects to be analyzed (e.g. the classes or propositions) soon for the most part turned into &quot;logical fictions&quot; . . . [meaning] only that we have no direct perception of them.&quot; (Gödel 1944:120)

In an observation pertinent to Russell&#x27;s brand of logicism, Perry remarks that Russell went through three phases of realism: extreme, moderate and constructive (Perry 1997:xxv). In 1903 he was in his extreme phase; by 1905 he would be in his moderate phase. In a few years he would &quot;dispense with physical or material objects as basic bits of the furniture of the world. He would attempt to construct them out of sense-data&quot; in his next book &quot;Our knowledge of the External World&quot; [1914]&quot; (Perry 1997:xxvi).

These constructions in what Gödel 1944 would call &quot;nominalistic constructivism ... which might better be called fictionalism&quot; derived from Russell&#x27;s &quot;more radical idea, the no-class theory&quot; (p. 125):
:&quot;according to which classes or concepts &quot;never&quot; exist as real objects, and sentences containing these terms are meaningful only as they can be interpreted as ... a manner of speaking about other things&quot; (p. 125).

==An example of a logicist construction of the natural numbers: Russell&#x27;s construction in the &quot;Principia&quot;==

The logicism of Frege and Dedekind is similar to that of Russell, but with differences in the particulars (see Criticisms, below). Overall, the logicist derivations of the natural numbers are different from derivations from, for example, Zermelo&#x27;s axioms for set theory (&#x27;Z&#x27;). Whereas, in derivations from Z, one definition of &quot;number&quot; uses an axiom of that system – the axiom of pairing – that leads to the definition of &quot;ordered pair&quot; – no &quot;overt&quot; number axiom exists in the various logicist axiom systems allowing the derivation of the natural numbers. Note that the axioms needed to derive the definition of a number may differ between axiom systems for set theory in any case. For instance, in ZF and ZFC, the axiom of pairing, and hence ultimately the notion of an ordered pair is derivable from the Axiom of Infinity and the Axiom of Replacement and is required in the definition of the von Neumann numerals (but not the Zermelo numerals), whereas in NFU the Frege numerals may be derived in an analogous way to their derivation in the Grundgesetze.

The &quot;Principia&quot;, like its forerunner the &quot;Grundgesetze&quot;, begins its construction of the numbers from primitive propositions such as &quot;class&quot;, &quot;propositional function&quot;, and in particular, relations of &quot;similarity&quot; (&quot;equinumerosity&quot;: placing the elements of collections in one-to-one correspondence) and &quot;ordering&quot; (using &quot;the successor of&quot; relation to order the collections of the equinumerous classes)&quot;. The logicistic derivation equates the cardinal numbers &quot;constructed&quot; this way to the natural numbers, and these numbers end up all of the same &quot;type&quot; – as classes of classes – whereas in some set theoretical constructions – for instance the von Neumann and the Zermelo numerals – each number has its predecessor as a subset. Kleene observes the following. (Kleene&#x27;s assumptions (1) and (2) state that 0 has property &quot;P&quot; and &quot;n&quot;+1 has property &quot;P&quot; whenever &quot;n&quot; has property &quot;P&quot;.)
:&quot;The viewpoint here is very different from that of [Kronecker]&#x27;s maxim that &#x27;God made the integers&#x27; plus Peano&#x27;s axioms of number and mathematical induction], where we presupposed an intuitive conception of the natural number sequence, and elicited from it the principle that, whenever a particular property &quot;P&quot; of natural numbers is given such that (1) and (2), then any given natural number must have the property &quot;P&quot;.&quot; (Kleene 1952:44).

The importance to the logicist programme of the construction of the natural numbers derives from Russell&#x27;s contention &quot;That all traditional pure mathematics can be derived from the natural numbers is a fairly recent discovery, though it had long been suspected&quot; (1919:4). One derivation of the &quot;real&quot; numbers derives from the theory of Dedekind cuts on the rational numbers, rational numbers in turn being derived from the naturals. While an example of how this is done is useful, it relies first on the derivation of the natural numbers. So, if philosophical difficulties appear in a logicist derivation of the natural numbers, these problems should be sufficient to stop the program until these are resolved (see Criticisms, below).

One attempt to construct the natural numbers is summarized by Bernays 1930–1931. But rather than use Bernays&#x27; précis, which is incomplete in some details, an attempt at a paraphrase of Russell&#x27;s construction, incorporating some finite illustrations, is set out below:

===Preliminaries===
For Russell, collections (classes) are aggregates of &quot;things&quot; specified by proper names, that come about as the result of propositions (assertions of fact about a thing or things). Russell analysed this general notion. He begins with &quot;terms&quot; in sentences, which he analysed as follows:

For Russell, &quot;terms&quot; are either &quot;things&quot; or &quot;concepts&quot;: &quot;Whatever may be an object of thought, or may occur in any true or false proposition, or can be counted as one, I call a &quot;term&quot;. This, then, is the widest word in the philosophical vocabulary. I shall use as synonymous with it the words, unit, individual, and entity. The first two emphasize the fact that every term is one, while the third is derived from the fact that every term has being, i.e. is in some sense. A man, a moment, a number, a class, a relation, a chimaera, or anything else that can be mentioned, is sure to be a term; and to deny that such and such a thing is a term must always be false&quot; (Russell 1903:43)

&quot;Among terms, it is possible to distinguish two kinds, which I shall call respectively &quot;things&quot; and &quot;concepts&quot;; the former are the terms indicated by proper names, the latter those indicated by all other words . . . Among concepts, again, two kinds at least must be distinguished, namely those indicated by adjectives and those indicated by verbs&quot; (1903:44).

&quot;The former kind will often be called predicates or class-concepts; the latter are always or almost always relations.&quot; (1903:44)

&quot;I shall speak of the &quot;terms&quot; of a proposition as those terms, however numerous, which occur in a proposition and may be regarded as subjects about which the proposition is. It is a characteristic of the terms of a proposition that anyone of them may be replaced by any other entity without our ceasing to have a proposition. Thus we shall say that &quot;Socrates is human&quot; is a proposition having only one term; of the remaining component of the proposition, one is the verb, the other is a predicate.. . . Predicates, then, are concepts, other than verbs, which occur in propositions having only one term or subject.&quot; (1903:45)

Suppose one were to point to an object and say: &quot;This object in front of me named &#x27;Emily&#x27; is a woman.&quot; This is a proposition, an assertion of the speaker&#x27;s belief, which is to be tested against the &quot;facts&quot; of the outer world: &quot;Minds do not &quot;create&quot; truth or falsehood. They create beliefs . . . what makes a belief true is a &quot;fact&quot;, and this fact does not (except in exceptional cases) in any way involve the mind of the person who has the belief&quot; (1912:130). If by investigation of the utterance and correspondence with &quot;fact&quot;, Russell discovers that Emily is a rabbit, then his utterance is considered &quot;false&quot;; if Emily is a female human (a female &quot;featherless biped&quot; as Russell likes to call humans, following Diogenes Laërtius&#x27;s anecdote about Plato), then his utterance is considered &quot;true&quot;.

&quot;The class, as opposed to the class-concept, is the sum or conjunction of all the terms which have the given predicate&quot; (1903 p. 55). Classes can be specified by extension (listing their members) or by intension, i.e. by a &quot;propositional function&quot; such as &quot;&quot;x&quot; is a &quot;u&quot; or &quot;x&quot; is &quot;v&quot;&quot;. But &quot;if we take extension pure, our class is defined by enumeration of its terms, and this method will not allow us to deal, as Symbolic Logic does, with infinite classes. Thus our classes must in general be regarded as objects denoted by concepts, and to this extent the point of view of intension is essential.&quot; (1909 p. 66)

&quot;The characteristic of a class concept, as distinguished from terms in general, is that &quot;&quot;x&quot; is a &quot;u&quot;&quot; is a propositional function when, and only when, &quot;u&quot; is a class-concept.&quot; (1903:56)

&quot;71. Class may be defined either extensionally or intensionally. That is to say, we may define the kind of object which is a class, or the kind of concept which denotes a class: this is the precise meaning of the opposition of extension and intension in this connection. But although the general notion can be defined in this two-fold manner, particular classes, except when they happen to be finite, can only be defined intensionally, i.e. as the objects denoted by such and such concepts. . . logically; the extensional definition appears to be equally applicable to infinite classes, but practically, if we were to attempt it, Death would cut short our laudable endeavour before it had attained its goal.&quot;(1903:69)

===The definition of the natural numbers===
In the Prinicipia, the natural numbers derive from &quot;all&quot; propositions that can be asserted about &quot;any&quot; collection of entities. Russell makes this clear in the second (italicized) sentence below.

:&quot;In the first place, numbers themselves form an infinite collection, and cannot therefore be defined by enumeration. &quot;In the second place, the collections having a given number of terms themselves presumably form an infinite collection: it is to be presumed, for example, that there are an infinite collection of trios in the world&quot;, for if this were not the case the total number of things in the world would be finite, which, though possible, seems unlikely. In the third place, we wish to define &quot;number&quot; in such a way that infinite numbers may be possible; thus we must be able to speak of the number of terms in an infinite collection, and such a collection must be defined by intension, i.e. by a property common to all its members and peculiar to them.&quot; (1919:13)

To illustrate, consider the following finite example: Suppose there are 12 families on a street. Some have children, some do not. To discuss the names of the children in these households requires 12 propositions asserting &quot;&quot;childname&quot; is the name of a child in family F&quot;n&quot;&quot; applied to this collection of households on the particular street of families with names F1, F2, . . . F12. Each of the 12 propositions regards whether or not the &quot;argument&quot; &quot;childname&quot; applies to a child in a particular household. The children&#x27;s names (&quot;childname&quot;) can be thought of as the &quot;x&quot; in a propositional function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), where the function is &quot;name of a child in the family with name F&quot;n&quot;&quot;.

Whereas the preceding example is finite over the finite propositional function &quot;&quot;childnames&quot; of the children in family F&quot;n&quot;&#x27;&quot; on the finite street of a finite number of families, Russell apparently intended the following to extend to all propositional functions extending over an infinite domain so as to allow the creation of all the numbers. 

Kleene considers that Russell has set out an impredicative definition that he will have to resolve, or risk deriving something like the Russell paradox. &quot;Here instead we presuppose the totality of all properties of cardinal numbers, as existing in logic, prior to the definition of the natural number sequence&quot; (Kleene 1952:44). The problem will appear, even in the finite example presented here, when Russell deals with the unit class (cf. Russell 1903:517).

The question arises what precisely a &quot;class&quot; &quot;is&quot; or should be. For Dedekind and Frege, a class is a distinct entity in its own right, a &#x27;unity&#x27; that can be identified with all those entities &quot;x&quot; that satisfy some propositional function &quot;F&quot;. (This symbolism appears in Russell, attributed there to Frege: &quot;The essence of a function is what is left when the &quot;x&quot; is taken away, i.e in the above instance, 2( )3 + ( ). The argument &quot;x&quot; does not belong to the function, but the two together make a whole (ib. p. 6 [i.e. Frege&#x27;s 1891 &quot;Function und Begriff&quot;]&quot; (Russell 1903:505).) For example, a particular &quot;unity&quot; could be given a name; suppose a family Fα has the children with the names Annie, Barbie and Charles:
:{ a, b, c }Fα

This notion of collection or class as object, when used without restriction, results in Russell&#x27;s paradox; see more below about impredicative definitions. Russell&#x27;s solution was to define the notion of a class to be only those elements that satisfy the proposition, his argument being that, indeed, the arguments &quot;x&quot; do not belong to the propositional function aka &quot;class&quot; created by the function. The class itself is not to be regarded as a unitary object in its own right, it exists only as a kind of useful fiction: &quot;We have avoided the decision as to whether a class of things has in any sense an existence as one object. A decision of this question in either way is indifferent to our logic&quot; (First edition of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; 1927:24).

Russell continues to hold this opinion in his 1919; observe the words &quot;symbolic fictions&quot;: 
:&quot;When we have decided that classes cannot be things of the same sort as their members, that they cannot be just heaps or aggregates, and also that they cannot be identified with propositional functions, it becomes very difficult to see what they can be, if they are to be more than &quot;symbolic fictions&quot;. And if we can find any way of dealing with them as &quot;symbolic fictions&quot;, we increase the logical security of our position, since we avoid the need of assuming that there are classes without being compelled to make the opposite assumption that there are no classes. We merely abstain from both assumptions. . . . But when we refuse to assert that there are classes, we must not be supposed to be asserting dogmatically that there are none. We are merely agnostic as regards them . . ..&quot; (1919:184)

And in the second edition of &quot;PM&quot; (1927) Russell holds that &quot;functions occur only through their values, . . . all functions of functions are extensional, . . . [and] consequently there is no reason to distinguish between functions and classes . . . Thus classes, as distinct from functions, lose even that shadowy being which they retain in *20&quot; (p. xxxix). In other words, classes as a separate notion have vanished altogether.

Step 2: Collect &quot;similar&quot; classes into &#x27;bundles&#x27; : These above collections can be put into a &quot;binary relation&quot; (comparing for) similarity by &quot;equinumerosity&quot;, symbolized here by ≈, i.e. one-one correspondence of the elements, and thereby create Russellian classes of classes or what Russell called &quot;bundles&quot;. &quot;We can suppose all couples in one bundle, all trios in another, and so on. In this way we obtain various bundles of collections, each bundle consisting of all the collections that have a certain number of terms. Each bundle is a class whose members are collections, i.e. classes; thus each is a class of classes&quot; (Russell 1919:14).

Step 3: Define the null class: Notice that a certain class of classes is special because its classes contain no elements, i.e. no elements satisfy the predicates whose assertion defined this particular class/collection. 

The resulting entity may be called &quot;the null class&quot; or &quot;the empty class&quot;. Russell symbolized the null/empty class with Λ. So what exactly is the Russellian null class? In &quot;PM&quot; Russell says that &quot;A class is said to &quot;exist&quot; when it has at least one member . . . the class which has no members is called the &quot;null class&quot; . . . &quot;α is the null-class&quot; is equivalent to &quot;α does not exist&quot;. The question naturally arises whether the null class itself &#x27;exists&#x27;? Difficulties related to this question occur in Russell&#x27;s 1903 work. After he discovered the paradox in Frege&#x27;s &quot;Grundgesetze&quot; he added Appendix A to his 1903 where through the analysis of the nature of the null and unit classes, he discovered the need for a &quot;doctrine of types&quot;; see more about the unit class, the problem of impredicative definitions and Russell&#x27;s &quot;vicious circle principle&quot; below.

Step 4: Assign a &quot;numeral&quot; to each bundle: For purposes of abbreviation and identification, to each bundle assign a unique symbol (aka a &quot;numeral&quot;). These symbols are arbitrary. 

Step 5: Define &quot;0&quot; Following Frege, Russell picked the empty or &quot;null&quot; class of classes as the appropriate class to fill this role, this being the class of classes having no members. This null class of classes may be labelled &quot;0&quot;

Step 6: Define the notion of &quot;successor&quot;: Russell defined a new characteristic &quot;hereditary&quot; (cf Frege&#x27;s &#x27;ancestral&#x27;), a property of certain classes with the ability to &quot;inherit&quot; a characteristic from another class (which may be a class of classes) i.e. &quot;A property is said to be &quot;hereditary&quot; in the natural-number series if, whenever it belongs to a number &quot;n&quot;, it also belongs to &quot;n&quot;+1, the successor of &quot;n&quot;&quot;. (1903:21). He asserts that &quot;the natural numbers are the &quot;posterity&quot; – the &quot;children&quot;, the inheritors of the &quot;successor&quot; – of 0 with respect to the relation &quot;the immediate predecessor of (which is the converse of &quot;successor&quot;) (1919:23).

Note Russell has used a few words here without definition, in particular &quot;number series&quot;, &quot;number &quot;n&quot;&quot;, and &quot;successor&quot;. He will define these in due course. &quot;Observe in particular that Russell does not use the unit class of classes &quot;1&quot; to construct the successor&quot;. The reason is that, in Russell&#x27;s detailed analysis, if a unit class becomes an entity in its own right, then it too can be an element in its own proposition; this causes the proposition to become &quot;impredicative&quot; and result in a &quot;vicious circle&quot;. Rather, he states: &quot;We saw in Chapter II that a cardinal number is to be defined as a class of classes, and in Chapter III that the number 1 is to be defined as the class of all unit classes, of all that have just one member, as we should say but for the vicious circle. Of course, when the number 1 is defined as the class of all unit classes, &quot;unit classes&quot; must be defined so as not to assume that we know what is meant by &quot;one&quot; (1919:181).

For his definition of successor, Russell will use for his &quot;unit&quot; a single entity or &quot;term&quot; as follows:
: &quot;It remains to define &quot;successor&quot;. Given any number &quot;n&quot; let &quot;α&quot; be a class which has &quot;n&quot; members, and let &quot;x&quot; be a term which is not a member of &quot;α&quot;. Then the class consisting of &quot;α&quot; with &quot;x&quot; added on will have &quot;+1&quot; members. Thus we have the following definition:
:&quot;the successor of the number of terms in the class α is the number of terms in the class consisting of α together with x where x is not any term belonging to the class&quot;.&quot; (1919:23)

Russell&#x27;s definition requires a new &quot;term&quot; which is &quot;added into&quot; the collections inside the bundles.

Step 7: Construct the successor of the null class.

Step 8: For every class of equinumerous classes, create its successor.

Step 9: Order the numbers: The process of creating a successor requires the relation &quot; . . . is the successor of . . .&quot;, which may be denoted &quot;S&quot;, between the various &quot;numerals&quot;. &quot;We must now consider the &quot;serial&quot; character of the natural numbers in the order 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . We ordinarily think of the numbers as in this order, and it is an essential part of the work of analysing our data to seek a definition of &quot;order&quot; or &quot;series &quot; in logical terms. . . . The order lies, not in the &quot;class&quot; of terms, but in a relation among the members of the class, in respect of which some appear as earlier and some as later.&quot; (1919:31)

Russell applies to the notion of &quot;ordering relation&quot; three criteria: First, he defines the notion of asymmetry i.e. given the relation such as &quot;S&quot; (&quot; . . . is the successor of . . . &quot;) between two terms &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;: &quot;x S y&quot; ≠ &quot;y S x&quot;. Second, he defines the notion of transitivity for three numerals &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot;: if &quot;x S y&quot; and &quot;y S z&quot; then &quot;x S z&quot;. Third, he defines the notion of connected: &quot;Given any two terms of the class which is to be ordered, there must be one which precedes and the other which follows. . . . A relation is connected when, given any two different terms of its field [both domain and converse domain of a relation e.g. husbands versus wives in the relation of married] the relation holds between the first and the second or between the second and the first (not excluding the possibility that both may happen, though both cannot happen if the relation is asymmetrical).(1919:32)

He concludes: &quot;. . . [natural] number &quot;m&quot; is said to be less than another number &quot;n&quot; when &quot;n&quot; possesses every hereditary property possessed by the successor of &quot;m&quot;. It is easy to see, and not difficult to prove, that the relation &quot;less than&quot;, so defined, is asymmetrical, transitive, and connected, and has the [natural] numbers for its field [i.e. both domain and converse domain are the numbers].&quot; (1919:35)

===Criticism===
The presumption of an &#x27;extralogical&#x27; notion of iteration: Kleene notes that &quot;the logicistic thesis can be questioned finally on the ground that logic already presupposes mathematical ideas in its formulation. In the Intuitionistic view, an essential mathematical kernel is contained in the idea of iteration&quot; (Kleene 1952:46)

Bernays 1930–1931 observes that this notion &quot;two things&quot; already presupposes something, even without the claim of existence of two things, and also without reference to a predicate, which applies to the two things; it means, simply, &quot;a thing and one more thing. . . . With respect to this simple definition, the Number concept turns out to be an elementary &quot;structural concept&quot; . . . the claim of the logicists that mathematics is purely logical knowledge turns out to be blurred and misleading upon closer observation of theoretical logic. . . . [one can extend the definition of &quot;logical&quot;] however, through this definition what is epistemologically essential is concealed, and what is peculiar to mathematics is overlooked&quot; (in Mancosu 1998:243).

Hilbert 1931:266-7, like Bernays, considers there is &quot;something extra-logical&quot; in mathematics: &quot;Besides experience and thought, there is yet a third source of knowledge. Even if today we can no longer agree with Kant in the details, nevertheless the most general and fundamental idea of the Kantian epistemology retains its significance: to ascertain the intuitive &quot;a priori&quot; mode of thought, and thereby to investigate the condition of the possibility of all knowledge. In my opinion this is essentially what happens in my investigations of the principles of mathematics. The &quot;a priori&quot; is here nothing more and nothing less than a fundamental mode of thought, which I also call the finite mode of thought: something is already given to us in advance in our faculty of representation: certain &quot;extra-logical concrete objects&quot; that exist intuitively as an immediate experience before all thought. If logical inference is to be certain, then these objects must be completely surveyable in all their parts, and their presentation, their differences, their succeeding one another or their being arrayed next to one another is immediately and intuitively given to us, along with the objects, as something that neither can be reduced to anything else, nor needs such a reduction.&quot; (Hilbert 1931 in Mancosu 1998: 266, 267).

In brief, according to Hilbert and Bernays, the notion of &quot;sequence&quot; or &quot;successor&quot; is an &quot;a priori&quot; notion that lies outside symbolic logic.

Hilbert dismissed logicism as a &quot;false path&quot;: &quot;Some tried to define the numbers purely logically; others simply took the usual number-theoretic modes of inference to be self-evident. On both paths they encountered obstacles that proved to be insuperable.&quot; (Hilbert 1931 in Mancoso 1998:267). The incompleteness theorems arguably constitute a similar obstacle for Hilbertian finitism.

Mancosu states that Brouwer concluded that: &quot;the classical laws or principles of logic are part of [the] perceived regularity [in the symbolic representation]; they are derived from the post factum record of mathematical constructions . . . Theoretical logic . . . [is] an empirical science and an application of mathematics&quot; (Brouwer quoted by Mancosu 1998:9).

With respect to the &quot;technical&quot; aspects of Russellian logicism as it appears in &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; (either edition), Gödel in 1944 was disappointed:
:&quot;It is to be regretted that this first comprehensive and thorough-going presentation of a mathematical logic and the derivation of mathematics from it [is?] so greatly lacking in formal precision in the foundations (contained in *1–*21 of &quot;Principia&quot;) that it presents in this respect a considerable step backwards as compared with Frege. What is missing, above all, is a precise statement of the syntax of the formalism&quot; (cf. footnote 1 in Gödel 1944 &quot;Collected Works&quot; 1990:120).

In particular he pointed out that &quot;The matter is especially doubtful for the rule of substitution and of replacing defined symbols by their &quot;definiens&quot;&quot; (Russell 1944:120)

With respect to the philosophy that might underlie these foundations, Gödel considered Russell&#x27;s &quot;no-class theory&quot; as embodying a &quot;nominalistic kind of constructivism . . . which might better be called fictionalism&quot; (cf. footnote 1 in Gödel 1944:119) – to be faulty. See more in &quot;Gödel&#x27;s criticism and suggestions&quot; below.

A complicated theory of relations continued to strangle Russell&#x27;s explanatory 1919 &quot;Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy&quot; and his 1927 second edition of &quot;Principia&quot;. Set theory, meanwhile had moved on with its reduction of relation to the ordered pair of sets. Grattan-Guinness observes that in the second edition of &quot;Principia&quot; Russell ignored this reduction that had been achieved by his own student Norbert Wiener (1914). Perhaps because of &quot;residual annoyance, Russell did not react at all&quot;. By 1914 Hausdorff would provide another, equivalent definition, and Kuratowski in 1921 would provide the one in use today.

== The unit class, impredicativity, and the vicious circle principle ==
Suppose a librarian wants to index her collection into a single book (call it Ι for &quot;index&quot;). Her index will list all the books and their locations in the library. As it turns out, there are only three books, and these have titles Ά, β, and Γ. To form her index I, she goes out and buys a book of 200 blank pages and labels it &quot;I&quot;. Now she has four books: I, Ά, β, and Γ. Her task is not difficult. When completed, the contents of her index I are 4 pages, each with a unique title and unique location (each entry abbreviated as Title.LocationT):
: I = { I.LI, Ά.LΆ, β.Lβ, Γ.LΓ}.

This sort of definition of I was deemed by Poincaré to be &quot;impredicative&quot;. He seems to have considered that only predicative definitions can be allowed in mathematics:
:&quot;a definition is &#x27;predicative&#x27; and logically admissible only if it &quot;excludes&quot; all objects that are dependent upon the notion defined, that is, that can in any way be determined by it&quot;.

By Poincaré&#x27;s definition, the librarian&#x27;s index book is &quot;impredicative&quot; because the definition of I is dependent upon the definition of the totality I, Ά, β, and Γ. As noted below, some commentators insist that impredicativity in commonsense versions is harmless, but as the examples show below there are versions which are not harmless. In response to these difficulties, Russell advocated a strong prohibition, his &quot;vicious circle principle&quot;:
:&quot;No totality can contain members definable only in terms of this totality, or members involving or presupposing this totality&quot; (vicious circle principle)&quot; (Gödel 1944 appearing in &quot;Collected Works Vol. II&quot; 1990:125).
To illustrate what a pernicious instance of impredicativity might be, consider the consequence of inputting argument α into the function f with output ω = 1−α. This may be seen as the equivalent &#x27;algebraic-logic&#x27; expression to the &#x27;symbolic-logic&#x27; expression ω = NOT-α, with truth values 1 and 0. When input α = 0, output ω = 1; when input α = 1, output ω = 0.

To make the function &quot;impredicative&quot;, identify the input with the output, yielding α = 1−α

Within the algebra of, say, rational numbers the equation is satisfied when α = 0.5. But within, for instance, a Boolean algebra, where only &quot;truth values&quot; 0 and 1 are permitted, then the equality &quot;cannot&quot; be satisfied.

Some of the difficulties in the logicist programme may derive from the α = NOT-α paradox Russell discovered in Frege&#x27;s 1879 &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; that Frege had allowed a function to derive its input &quot;functional&quot; (value of its variable) not only from an object (thing, term), but also from the function&#x27;s own output.

As described above, Both Frege&#x27;s and Russell&#x27;s constructions of the natural numbers begin with the formation of equinumerous classes of classes (&quot;bundles&quot;), followed by an assignment of a unique &quot;numeral&quot; to each bundle, and then by the placing of the bundles into an order via a relation &quot;S&quot; that is asymmetric: &quot;x S y&quot; ≠ &quot;y S x&quot;. But Frege, unlike Russell, allowed the class of unit classes to be identified as a unit itself:

But, since the class with numeral 1 is a single object or unit in its own right, it too must be included in the class of unit classes. This inclusion results in an infinite regress of increasing type and increasing content.

Russell avoided this problem by declaring a class to be more or a &quot;fiction&quot;. By this he meant that a class could designate only those elements that satisfied its propositional function and nothing else. As a &quot;fiction&quot; a class cannot be considered to be a thing: an entity, a &quot;term&quot;, a singularity, a &quot;unit&quot;. It is an &quot;assemblage&quot; but is not in Russell&#x27;s view &quot;worthy of thing-hood&quot;:
:&quot;The class as many . . . is unobjectionable, but is many and not one. We may, if we choose, represent this by a single symbol: thus &quot;x&quot; ε &quot;u&quot; will mean &quot;&quot;x&quot; is one of the &quot;u&quot;″s.&quot; This must not be taken as a relation of two terms, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;u&quot;, because &quot;u&quot; as the numerical conjunction is not a single term . . . Thus a class of classes will be many many&#x27;s; its constituents will each be only many, and cannot therefore in any sense, one might suppose, be single constituents.[etc]&quot; (1903:516).

This supposes that &quot;at the bottom&quot; every single solitary &quot;term&quot; can be listed (specified by a &quot;predicative&quot; predicate) for any class, for any class of classes, for class of classes of classes, etc, but it introduces a new problem—a hierarchy of &quot;types&quot; of classes.

===A solution to impredicativity: a hierarchy of types===
Gödel 1944:131 observes that &quot;Russell adduces two reasons against the extensional view of classes, namely the existence of (1) the null class, which cannot very well be a collection, and (2) the unit classes, which would have to be identical with their single elements.&quot; He suggests that Russell should have regarded these as fictitious, but not derive the further conclusion that &quot;all&quot; classes (such as the class-of-classes that define the numbers 2, 3, etc) are fictions.

But Russell did not do this. After a detailed analysis in Appendix A: &quot;The Logical and Arithmetical Doctrines of Frege&quot; in his 1903, Russell concludes:
:&quot;The logical doctrine which is thus forced upon us is this: The subject of a proposition may be not a single term, but essentially many terms; this is the case with all propositions asserting numbers other than 0 and 1&quot; (1903:516).

In the following notice the wording &quot;the class as many&quot;—a class is an aggregate of those terms (things) that satisfy the propositional function, but a class is not a thing-in-itself:
:&quot;Thus the final conclusion is, that the correct theory of classes is even more extensional than that of Chapter VI; that the class as many is the only object always defined by a propositional function, and that this is adequate for formal purposes&quot; (1903:518).

It is as if a rancher were to round up all his livestock (sheep, cows and horses) into three fictitious corrals (one for the sheep, one for the cows, and one for the horses) that are located in his fictitious ranch. What actually exist are the sheep, the cows and the horses (the extensions), but not the fictitious &quot;concepts&quot; corrals and ranch.

When Russell proclaimed &quot;all&quot; classes are useful fictions he solved the problem of the &quot;unit&quot; class, but the &quot;overall&quot; problem did not go away; rather, it arrived in a new form: &quot;It will now be necessary to distinguish (1) terms, (2) classes, (3) classes of classes, and so on &quot;ad infinitum&quot;; we shall have to hold that no member of one set is a member of any other set, and that &quot;x&quot; ε &quot;u&quot; requires that &quot;x&quot; should be of a set of a degree lower by one than the set to which &quot;u&quot; belongs. Thus &quot;x&quot; ε &quot;x&quot; will become a meaningless proposition; and in this way the contradiction is avoided&quot; (1903:517).

This is Russell&#x27;s &quot;doctrine of types&quot;. To guarantee that impredicative expressions such as &quot;x&quot; ε &quot;x&quot; can be treated in his logic, Russell proposed, as a kind of working hypothesis, that all such impredicative definitions have predicative definitions. This supposition requires the notions of function-&quot;orders&quot; and argument-&quot;types&quot;. First, functions (and their classes-as-extensions, i.e. &quot;matrices&quot;) are to be classified by their &quot;order&quot;, where functions of individuals are of order 1, functions of functions (classes of classes) are of order 2, and so forth. Next, he defines the &quot;type&quot; of a function&#x27;s arguments (the function&#x27;s &quot;inputs&quot;) to be their &quot;range of significance&quot;, i.e. what are those inputs &quot;α&quot; (individuals? classes? classes-of-classes? etc.) that, when plugged into &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), yield a meaningful output ω. Note that this means that a &quot;type&quot; can be of mixed order, as the following example shows:
:&quot;Joe DiMaggio and the Yankees won the 1947 World Series&quot;.
This sentence can be decomposed into two clauses: &quot;&quot;x&quot; won the 1947 World Series&quot; + &quot;&quot;y&quot; won the 1947 World Series&quot;. The first sentence takes for &quot;x&quot; an individual &quot;Joe DiMaggio&quot; as its input, the other takes for &quot;y&quot; an aggregate &quot;Yankees&quot; as its input. Thus the composite-sentence has a (mixed) type of 2, mixed as to order (1 and 2).

By &quot;predicative&quot;, Russell meant that the function must be of an order higher than the &quot;type&quot; of its variable(s). Thus a function (of order 2) that creates a class of classes can only entertain arguments for its variable(s) that are classes (type 1) and individuals (type 0), as these are lower types. Type 3 can only entertain types 2, 1 or 0, and so forth. But these types can be mixed (for example, for this sentence to be (sort of) true: &quot;&quot;z&quot; won the 1947 World Series&quot; could accept the individual (type 0) &quot;Joe DiMaggio&quot; and/or the names of his other teammates, &quot;and&quot; it could accept the class (type 1) of individual players &quot;The Yankees&quot;.

The &quot;axiom of reducibility&quot; is the hypothesis that &quot;any&quot; function of &quot;any&quot; order can be reduced to (or replaced by) an equivalent &quot;predicative&quot; function of the appropriate order. A careful reading of the first edition indicates that an &quot;n&quot;th order predicative function need not be expressed &quot;all the way down&quot; as a huge &quot;matrix&quot; or aggregate of individual atomic propositions. &quot;For in practice only the &quot;relative&quot; types of variables are relevant; thus the lowest type occurring in a given context may be called that of individuals&quot; (p. 161). But the axiom of reducibility proposes that &quot;in theory&quot; a reduction &quot;all the way down&quot; is possible.

By the 2nd edition of &quot;PM&quot; of 1927, though, Russell had given up on the axiom of reducibility and concluded he would indeed force any order of function &quot;all the way down&quot; to its elementary propositions, linked together with logical operators:
:&quot;All propositions, of whatever order, are derived from a matrix composed of elementary propositions combined by means of the stroke&quot; (&quot;PM&quot; 1927 Appendix A, p. 385)
(The &quot;stroke&quot; is &quot;Sheffer&#x27;s stroke&quot; – adopted for the 2nd edition of PM – a single two argument logical function from which all other logical functions may be defined.)

The net result, though, was a collapse of his theory. Russell arrived at this disheartening conclusion: that &quot;the theory of ordinals and cardinals survives . . . but irrationals, and real numbers generally, can no longer be adequately dealt with. . . . Perhaps some further axiom, less objectionable than the axiom of reducibility, might give these results, but we have not succeeded in finding such an axiom&quot; (&quot;PM&quot; 1927:xiv).

Gödel 1944 agrees that Russell&#x27;s logicist project was stymied; he seems to disagree that even the integers survived:
:&quot;[In the second edition] The axiom of reducibility is dropped, and it is stated explicitly that all primitive predicates belong to the lowest type and that the only purpose of variables (and evidently also of constants) of higher orders and types is to make it possible to assert more complicated truth-functions of atomic propositions&quot; (Gödel 1944 in &quot;Collected Works&quot;:134).

Gödel asserts, however, that this procedure seems to presuppose arithmetic in some form or other (p. 134). He deduces that &quot;one obtains integers of different orders&quot; (p. 134-135); the proof in Russell 1927 &quot;PM&quot; Appendix B that &quot;the integers of any order higher than 5 are the same as those of order 5&quot; is &quot;not conclusive&quot; and &quot;the question whether (or to what extent) the theory of integers can be obtained on the basis of the ramified hierarchy [classes plus types] must be considered as unsolved at the present time&quot;. Gödel concluded that it wouldn&#x27;t matter anyway because propositional functions of order &quot;n&quot; (any &quot;n&quot;) must be described by finite combinations of symbols (all quotes and content derived from page 135).

===Gödel&#x27;s criticism and suggestions===
Gödel, in his 1944 work, identifies the place where he considers Russell&#x27;s logicism to fail and offers suggestions to rectify the problems. He submits the &quot;vicious circle principle&quot; to re-examination, splitting it into three parts &quot;definable only in terms of&quot;, &quot;involving&quot; and &quot;presupposing&quot;. It is the first part that &quot;makes impredicative definitions impossible and thereby destroys the derivation of mathematics from logic, effected by Dedekind and Frege, and a good deal of mathematics itself&quot;. Since, he argues, mathematics sees to rely on its inherent impredicativities (e.g. &quot;real numbers defined by reference to all real numbers&quot;), he concludes that what he has offered is &quot;a proof that the vicious circle principle is false [rather] than that classical mathematics is false&quot; (all quotes Gödel 1944:127).

Russell&#x27;s no-class theory is the root of the problem: Gödel believes that impredicativity is not &quot;absurd&quot;, as it appears throughout mathematics. Russell&#x27;s problem derives from his &quot;constructivistic (or nominalistic&quot;) standpoint toward the objects of logic and mathematics, in particular toward propositions, classes, and notions . . . a notion being a symbol . . . so that a separate object denoted by the symbol appears as a mere fiction&quot; (p. 128).

Indeed, Russell&#x27;s &quot;no class&quot; theory, Gödel concludes:
:&quot;is of great interest as one of the few examples, carried out in detail, of the tendency to eliminate assumptions about the existence of objects outside the &quot;data&quot; and to replace them by constructions on the basis of these data33. The &quot;data&quot; are to understand in a relative sense here; i.e. in our case as logic without the assumption of the existence of classes and concepts]. The result has been in this case essentially negative; i.e. the classes and concepts introduced in this way do not have all the properties required from their use in mathematics. . . . All this is only a verification of the view defended above that logic and mathematics (just as physics) are built up on axioms with a real content which cannot be explained away&quot; (p. 132)

He concludes his essay with the following suggestions and observations:
:&quot;One should take a more conservative course, such as would consist in trying to make the meaning of terms &quot;class&quot; and &quot;concept&quot; clearer, and to set up a consistent theory of classes and concepts as objectively existing entities. This is the course which the actual development of mathematical logic has been taking and which Russell himself has been forced to enter upon in the more constructive parts of his work. Major among the attempts in this direction . . . are the simple theory of types . . . and axiomatic set theory, both of which have been successful at least to this extent, that they permit the derivation of modern mathematics and at the same time avoid all known paradoxes . . . ¶ It seems reasonable to suspect that it is this incomplete understanding of the foundations which is responsible for the fact that mathematical logic has up to now remained so far behind the high expectations of Peano and others . . ..&quot; (p. 140)

== Neo-logicism ==
Neo-logicism describes a range of views considered by their proponents to be successors of the original logicist program. More narrowly, neo-logicism may be seen as the attempt to salvage some or all elements of Frege&#x27;s programme through the use of a modified version of Frege&#x27;s system in the &quot;Grundgesetze&quot; (which may be seen as a kind of second-order logic). 

For instance, one might replace Basic Law V (analogous to the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension in naive set theory) with some &#x27;safer&#x27; axiom so as to prevent the derivation of the known paradoxes. The most cited candidate to replace BLV is Hume&#x27;s principle, the contextual definition of &#x27;#&#x27; given by &#x27;#&quot;F&quot; = #&quot;G&quot; if and only if there is a bijection between &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G. This kind of neo-logicism is often referred to as neo-Fregeanism. Proponents of neo-Fregeanism include Crispin Wright and Bob Hale, sometimes also called the Scottish School or abstractionist Platonism, who espouse a form of epistemic foundationalism.

Other major proponents of neo-logicism include Bernard Linsky and Edward N. Zalta, sometimes called the Stanford–Edmonton School, abstract structuralism or modal neo-logicism, who espouse a form of axiomatic metaphysics. Modal neo-logicism derives the Peano axioms within second-order modal object theory.

Another quasi-neo-logicist approach has been suggested by M. Randall Holmes. In this kind of amendment to the &quot;Grundgesetze&quot;, BLV remains intact, save for a restriction to stratifiable formulae in the manner of Quine&#x27;s NF and related systems. Essentially all of the &quot;Grundgesetze&quot; then &#x27;goes through&#x27;. The resulting system has the same consistency strength as Jensen&#x27;s NFU + Rosser&#x27;s Axiom of Counting.

<text>Bonnie Blair Brown (born April 23, 1946) is an American theater, film and television actress. She has had a number of high-profile roles, including in the play &quot;Copenhagen&quot; on Broadway (for which she won a Tony Award in 2000), the leading actress in the films &quot;Altered States&quot; (1980), &quot;Continental Divide&quot; (1981) and &quot;Strapless&quot; (1989), as well as a run as the title character in the comedy-drama television series &quot;The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd&quot;, which ran from 1987 to 1991. Her later roles include Nina Sharp on the Fox television series &quot;Fringe&quot; and Judy King on the Netflix series &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;. 

==Early life==
Brown was born in Washington, D.C. Her mother was a teacher and her father worked for the Central Intelligence Agency. She graduated from The Madeira School in McLean, Virginia, and then pursued acting at the National Theatre School of Canada, graduating in 1969. She gained notice as a participating actor at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival and spent several years working on the stage.

==Career==

===Film===
Brown&#x27;s first feature role was in the Oscar-winning 1973 film &quot;The Paper Chase&quot;; her first major starring role was in &quot;The Choirboys&quot; in 1977. Among her other film credits were &quot;Altered States&quot; (opposite William Hurt), &quot;One Trick Pony&quot; (with Paul Simon), the film &quot;Stealing Home&quot; (opposite Mark Harmon) and &quot;A Flash of Green&quot; (1984). Her arguably highest profile film role to date was the romantic lead opposite John Belushi in &quot;Continental Divide&quot; (1981) for which she received her first Golden Globe Award nomination, in the category of Best Motion Picture Actress in a Comedy/Musical.

Other film roles include: &quot;And I Alone Survived&quot; (1978), &quot;Strapless&quot; (1989), &quot;The Astronaut&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1999), Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Space Cowboys&quot; (2000), Lars von Trier&#x27;s &quot;Dogville&quot;, the Kevin Bacon-directed &quot;Loverboy&quot; (2005) and &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (2006).

===Television===
Brown appeared in several television movies and miniseries, primarily during the 1980s. A high-profile role as Jacqueline Kennedy in the 1983 TV miniseries &quot;Kennedy&quot; earned her a second Golden Globe nomination, for Best Actress in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television, as well as a BAFTA nomination. She also appeared in several other programs about the Kennedys, including the 1996 miniseries &quot;A Season in Purgatory&quot;, which was a thinly veiled portrait of the family, as well as an appearance as Anna Roosevelt in a telefilm about Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt.

Brown&#x27;s visibility rose during her five-year run (1987–1991) on the comedy-drama series &quot;The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd&quot;. She played the title role, and she, and the show, earned a small but dedicated following. Brown received five consecutive Emmy Award nominations for each season, in the category of Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, but never won. The show spent two years on NBC, then moved to the Lifetime cable channel for the remainder of its run. 

Brown also appeared in other prime-time series including &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, and &quot;Ed&quot;. In 1975 she appeared in one episode of the television mini-series &quot;Wheels&quot; and the following year she appeared in the TV pilot for &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;. Beginning in 2008, Brown starred as Nina Sharp in the Fox television series &quot;Fringe&quot;. Brown also appeared in several seasons of the &quot;Netflix&quot; comedy-drama series &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot; as fictional television personality Judy King, an inmate loosely based on Martha Stewart.

===Stage===
Brown has been involved with theater since the beginning of her career. She appeared in the 1975 New York Shakespeare Festival production of &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot;. Among her earlier roles was a run as Lucy Brown in the 1976 production of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, produced by Joe Papp and directed by Richard Foreman. She left the production for film work, but after being away from the production for eight months, Ellen Greene, who was playing the part of Jenny, fell ill. Brown astounded the stage manager of the production by coming in and, with one hour of rehearsal, put on a &quot;brilliant&quot; performance as Jenny. Her first major appearance on Broadway came in 1989, in the play &quot;Secret Rapture&quot;, written by David Hare.

Once &quot;Molly Dodd&quot; concluded, Brown became a prolific Broadway actress, appearing in, among other productions, Tom Stoppard&#x27;s 1995 Lincoln Center Theater production of &quot;Arcadia&quot; and two separate runs as Frau Schneider in the revival of &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1998 and 2003). She played Margrethe, the wife of physicist Niels Bohr, in the play &quot;Copenhagen&quot;, a role for which she won a 2000 Tony Award in the category of Best Featured Actress in a Play. Brown played the lead role in Sarah Ruhl&#x27;s 2006 play &quot;The Clean House&quot; at Lincoln Center.

===Voice===
In the 1990s, Brown expanded her career into voiceover work, narrating both audiobooks and films and documentaries. Her audiobooks projects include John Grisham&#x27;s &quot;The Client&quot;, Lois Lowry&#x27;s &quot;Number the Stars&quot;, Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Rose Madder&quot;, Kevin Henkes&#x27; &quot;Olive&#x27;s Ocean&quot;, Sue Miller&#x27;s 2005 novel &quot;Lost in the Forest&quot;, and Isabel Allende&#x27;s &quot;Inés of My Soul&quot;.

Her voiceovers are heard on a number of documentaries, including PBS&#x27;s &quot;American Experience&quot; series and the 2007 PBS series &quot;The Mysterious Human Heart&quot;. Other documentary narrations include the scientific series &quot;The Secret Life of the Brain&quot;, a documentary on Aimee Semple McPherson, which aired in April 2007, and a 2006 PBS documentary about Marie Antoinette. In April, 2010, she co-narrated the PBS special &quot;The Buddha&quot; with Richard Gere.

==Personal life==
Brown had a relationship with actor Richard Jordan, whom she met while filming the miniseries &quot;Captains and the Kings&quot; in 1976. The couple lived together from 1976 to 1985; their son Robert Anson Jordan III was born in 1983. She dated playwright David Hare from 1985 to 1990; he referred to her as his muse.

<doc id="350674" wikidata="Q854921" url="?curid=350674" title="The Decline of the West">
<text>The Decline of the West (; more literally, The Downfall of the Occident) is a two-volume work by Oswald Spengler. The first volume, subtitled Form and Actuality, was published in the summer of 1918. The second volume, subtitled Perspectives of World History, was published in 1922. The definitive edition of both volumes was published in 1923.

Spengler introduced his book as a &quot;Copernican overturning&quot;—a specific metaphor of societal collapse—involving the rejection of the Eurocentric view of history, especially the division of history into the linear &quot;ancient-medieval-modern&quot; rubric. According to Spengler, the meaningful units for history are not epochs but whole cultures which evolve as organisms. In his framework, the terms &quot;culture&quot; and &quot;civilization&quot; were given non-standard definitions and cultures are described as having lifespans of about a thousand years of flourishing, and a thousand years of decline. To Spengler, the natural lifespan of these groupings was to start as a &quot;race&quot;; become a &quot;culture&quot; as it flourished and produced new insights; and then become a &quot;civilization&quot;. Spengler differed from others in not seeing the final civilization stage as necessarily &quot;better&quot; than the earlier stages; rather, the military expansion and self-assured confidence that accompanied the beginning of such a phase was a sign that the civilization had arrogantly decided it had already understood the world and would stop creating bold new ideas, which would eventually lead to a decline. For example, to Spengler, the Classical world&#x27;s culture stage was in Greek and early Roman thought; the expansion of the Roman Empire was its civilization phase; and the collapse of the Roman and Byzantine Empires their decline. He believed that the West was in its &quot;evening&quot;, similar to the late Roman Empire, and approaching its eventual decline despite its seeming power.

Spengler recognized at least eight high cultures: Babylonian, Egyptian, Chinese, Indian, Mesoamerican (Mayan/Aztec), Classical (Greek/Roman, &quot;Apollonian&quot;), the non-Babylonian Middle East (&quot;Magian&quot;), and Western or European (&quot;Faustian&quot;). Spengler combined a number of groups under the &quot;Magian&quot; label; &quot;Semitic&quot;, Arabian, Persian, and the Abrahamic religions in general as originating from them (Judaism, Christianity, Islam). Similarly, he combined various Mediterranean cultures of antiquity including both Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome as &quot;Apollonian&quot;, and modern Westerners as &quot;Faustian&quot;. According to Spengler, the Western world was ending and the final season, the &quot;winter&quot; of Faustian Civilization, was being witnessed. In Spengler&#x27;s depiction, Western Man was a proud but tragic figure because, while he strives and creates, he secretly knows the actual goal will never be reached.

== Creation ==
Spengler said that he conceived the book sometime in 1911 and spent three years to finish the first draft. At the start of World War I, he began revising it and completed the first volume in 1917. It was published the following year when Spengler was 38 and was his first work, apart from his doctoral thesis on Heraclitus. The second volume was published in 1922. The first volume is subtitled &quot;Form and Actuality&quot;; the second volume is &quot;Perspectives of World-history&quot;. Spengler&#x27;s own view of the aims and intentions of the work were described in the Prefaces and occasionally at other places such as in the preface to &quot;Man and Technics&quot;.

== Overview ==
Spengler&#x27;s world-historical outlook was informed by many philosophers, including Goethe and to some degree Nietzsche. He described the significance of these two German philosophers and their influence on his worldview in his lecture &quot;Nietzsche and His Century&quot;. He called his analytical approach &quot;Analogy&quot;. Using this approach, he proposed to &quot;distinguish and periodicity in the world.&quot;

Morphology was a key part of Spengler&#x27;s philosophy of history, using a methodology which approached history and historical comparisons on the basis of civilizational forms and structure, without regard to function.

In a footnote, Spengler described the essential core of his philosophical approach toward history, culture, and civilization:
Plato and Goethe stand for the philosophy of Becoming, Aristotle and Kant the philosophy of Being... Goethe&#x27;s notes and verse... must be regarded as the expression of a perfectly definite metaphysical doctrine. I would not have a single word changed of this: &quot;The Godhead is effective in the living and not in the dead, in the becoming and the changing, not in the become and the set-fast; and therefore, similarly, the reason is concerned only to strive towards the divine through the becoming and the living, and the understanding only to make use of the become and the set-fast. (Letter to Eckermann)&quot; This sentence comprises my entire philosophy.

Scholars now agree that the word &quot;decline&quot; more accurately renders the intended meaning of Spengler&#x27;s original German word &quot;Untergang&quot; (often translated as the more emphatic &quot;downfall&quot;; &quot;Unter&quot; being &quot;under&quot; and &quot;gang&quot; being &quot;going&quot;, it is also accurately rendered in English as the &quot;going under&quot; of the West). Spengler said that he did not mean to describe a catastrophic occurrence, but rather a protracted fall—a &quot;twilight&quot; or &quot;sunset&quot; (&quot;Sonnenuntergang&quot; is German for sunset, and &quot;Abendland&quot;, the German word for the West or the Occident, literally means the &quot;evening land&quot;). In 1921, Spengler wrote that he might have used in his title the word &quot;Vollendung&quot; (which means &#x27;fulfillment&#x27; or &#x27;consummation&#x27;) and saved a great deal of misunderstanding.

=== Spenglerian terms ===
Spengler invented certain terms with unusual meanings not commonly encountered in everyday discourse.

====Culture/Civilization====
Spengler used the two terms in a specific manner, loading them with particular values. For him, Civilization is what a Culture becomes once its creative impulses wane and become overwhelmed by critical impulses. Culture is the becoming, Civilization is the thing which a culture becomes. Rousseau, Socrates, and Buddha each mark the point where their Cultures transformed into Civilization. They each buried centuries of spiritual depth by presenting the world in rational terms—the intellect comes to rule once the soul has abdicated.

====Apollonian/Magian/Faustian====
These are Spengler&#x27;s terms for Classical, Arabian and Western Cultures respectively.

;Apollonian: Culture and Civilization is focused around Ancient Greece and Rome. Spengler saw its world view as being characterized by appreciation for the beauty of the human body, and a preference for the local and the present moment. The Apollonian world sense was described as ahistorical, citing Thucydides&#x27; claim in his Histories that nothing of importance had happened before him. Spengler said that the Classical Culture did not feel the same anxiety as the Faustian when confronted with an undocumented event.
;Magian: Culture and Civilization includes the Jews from about 400 BC, early Christians and various Arabian religions up to and including Islam. He described it as having a world feeling that revolved around the concept of world as cavern, epitomized by the domed Mosque, and a preoccupation with essence. Spengler saw the development of this Culture as being distorted by a too-influential presence of older Civilizations, the initial vigorous expansionary impulses of Islam being in part a reaction against this.
;Faustian: According to Spengler, the Faustian culture began in Western Europe around the 10th century, and had such expansionary power that by the 20th century it was covering the entire earth, with only a few regions where Islam provided an alternative world view. He described it as having a world feeling inspired by the concept of infinitely wide and profound space, the yearning towards distance and infinity. The term &quot;Faustian&quot; is a reference to Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; (Johann Wolfgang von Goethe had a massive effect on Spengler), in which a dissatisfied Intellectual is willing to make a pact with the Devil in return for unlimited knowledge. Spengler believed that this represented the Western Man&#x27;s limitless metaphysic, unrestricted thirst for knowledge, and constant confrontation with the Infinite.

====Pseudomorphosis====
The concept of &quot;pseudomorphosis&quot; is one that Spengler borrows from mineralogy and is introduced as a way of explaining what he calls half-developed or only partially manifested Cultures. Specifically, pseudomorphosis refers to an older Culture or Civilization being so deeply ingrained that a young Culture cannot find its own form and full expression of itself. In Spengler&#x27;s words, this leads to the young soul being cast in the old molds, young feelings then stiffen in senile practices, and instead of expanding creatively, it fosters hate toward the older Culture.

Spengler believed that a Magian pseudomorphosis began with the Battle of Actium, in which the gestating Arabian Culture was represented by Mark Antony and lost to the Classical Civilization. The battle was different from the conflict between Rome and Greece, which had been fought out at Cannae and Zama, with Hannibal being the representative of Hellenism. He said that Antony should have won at Actium, and his victory would have freed the Magian Culture, but his defeat imposed Roman Civilization on it.

In Russia, Spengler saw a young, undeveloped Culture in a pseudomorphosis under the Faustian (Petrine) form. He said that Peter the Great distorted the tsarism of Russia to the dynastic form of Western Europe. The burning of Moscow, as Napoleon was set to invade, he described as a primitive expression of hatred toward the foreigner. In the following entry of Alexander I into Paris, the Holy Alliance and the Concert of Europe, he said that Russia was forced into an artificial history before its culture was ready or capable of understanding its burden. This would result in a hatred toward Europe, which Spengler said poisoned the womb of an emerging new Culture in Russia. While he does not name the Culture, he said that Tolstoy is its past and Dostoevsky is its future.

====Becoming/Being====
For Spengler, &quot;becoming&quot; is the basic element and &quot;being&quot; is static and secondary, not the other way around. He said that his philosophy in a nutshell is contained in these lines from Goethe: &quot;the God-head is effective in the living and not in the dead, in the &quot;becoming&quot; and the changing, not in the &quot;become&quot; and the set-fast; and therefore, similarly the intuition is concerned only to strive towards the divine through the becoming and the living, and logic only to make use of the become and the set-fast&quot;.

====Blood/Race====
Spengler described blood as the only power which is strong enough to overthrow money, which he saw as the dominant power of his age. Blood is commonly understood to mean race-feeling, and this concept is partially true but it is misleading. Spengler&#x27;s concept of race had nothing to do with ethnic identity, so in that sense, he was hostile toward racists. The book states that a population becomes a race when it is united in outlook, regardless of its ethnic origins. Spengler also states that the final struggle with money will be a battle between capitalism and socialism, but again, it will be socialism with a specific definition: &quot;the will to call into life a mighty politico-economic order that transcends all class interests, a system of lofty thoughtfulness and duty sense.&quot; He also writes &quot;A power can be overthrown only by another power, not by a principle, and only one power that can confront money is left. Money is overthrown and abolished by blood. Life is alpha and omega ... It is the fact of facts ... Before the irresistible rhythm on the generation-sequence, everything built up by the waking–consciousness in its intellectual world vanishes at the last.&quot;

=== Spengler&#x27;s cultures ===
Spengler said that eight &quot;Hochkulturen&quot; or high cultures have existed: 
*Babylonian
*Egyptiac
*Indic
*Sinic
*Mesoamerican (Mayan/Aztec)
*Apollonian or Classical (Greek/Roman)
*Magian or Arabian
*Faustian or Western (European)

The &quot;Decline&quot; is largely concerned with the Classical and Western (and to some degree Magian) Cultures, but some examples are taken from the Chinese and Egyptian. He said that each Culture arises within a specific geographical area and is defined by its internal coherence of style in terms of art, religious behavior and psychological perspective. In addition, each Culture is described as having a conception of space which is expressed by an &quot;Ursymbol&quot;. Spengler said that his idea of Culture is justifiable through the existence of recurrent patterns of development and decline across the thousand years of each Culture&#x27;s active lifetime.

Spengler did not classify the Southeast Asian and Peruvian (Incan, etc.) cultures as &quot;Hochkulturen&quot;. He thought that Russia was still defining itself, but was bringing into being a &quot;Hochkultur&quot;. The Indus Valley civilization had not been discovered at the time he was writing, and its relationship with later Indian civilization remained unclear for some time.

== Themes ==

===Meaning of history===
Spengler distinguished between ahistorical peoples and peoples caught up in world history. While he recognized that all people are a part of history, he said that only certain Cultures have a wider sense of historical involvement, meaning that some people see themselves as part of a grand historical design or tradition, while others view themselves in a self-contained manner and have no world-historical consciousness.

For Spengler, a world-historical view is about the meaning of history itself, breaking the historian or observer out of a crude, culturally classification of history. By learning about different courses taken by other civilizations, people can better understand their own culture and identity. He said that those who still maintain a historical view of the world are the ones who continue to &quot;make&quot; history. Spengler said that life and humankind as a whole have an ultimate aim. However, he maintains a distinction between world-historical peoples, and ahistorical peoples—the former will have a historical destiny as part of a High Culture, while the latter will have a merely zoological fate. He said that world-historical man&#x27;s destiny is self-fulfillment as a part of his Culture. Further, Spengler said that not only is pre-cultural man without history, he loses his historical weight as his Culture becomes exhausted and becomes a more and more defined Civilization.

For example, Spengler classifies Classical and Indian civilizations as ahistorical, comparing them to the Egyptian and Western civilizations which developed conceptions of historical time. He sees all Cultures as equal in the study of world-historical development. This leads to a kind of historical relativism or dispensationalism. Historical data, in Spengler&#x27;s mind, are an expression of their historical time, contingent upon and relative to that context. Thus, the insights of one era are not unshakable or valid in another time or Culture—&quot;there are no eternal truths,&quot; and each individual has a duty to look beyond one&#x27;s own Culture to see what individuals of other Cultures have with equal certainty created for themselves. He said that what is significant is not whether the past thinkers&#x27; insights are relevant today, but whether they were exceptionally relevant to the great facts of their own time.

===Culture and civilization===

Spengler&#x27;s conception of Culture was organic: primitive Culture is simply the sum of its constituent and incoherent parts (individuals, tribes, clans, etc.). Higher Culture, in its maturity and coherence, becomes an organism in its own right, according to Spengler. A Culture is described as sublimating the various customs, myths, techniques, arts, peoples, and classes into a single strong undiffused historical tendency.

Spengler divided the concepts of Culture and Civilization, the former focused inward and growing, the latter outward and merely expanding. However, he sees Civilization as the destiny of every Culture. The transition is not a matter of choice—it is not the conscious will of individuals, classes, or peoples that decides. He said that while Cultures are &quot;things-becoming&quot;, Civilizations are the &quot;thing-become&quot;, with the distinction being that Civilizations are what Cultures become when they are no longer creative and growing. As the conclusion of a Culture&#x27;s arc of growth, Civilizations are described as outwardly focused, and in that sense artificial or insincere. As an example, Spengler used the Greeks and Romans, saying that the imaginative Greek Culture declined into wholly practical Roman Civilization.

Spengler also compared the &quot;world-city&quot; and -province (urban and rural) as concepts analogous to Civilization and Culture respectively, with the city drawing upon and collecting the life of broad surrounding regions. He said there is a &quot;true-type&quot; rural-born person, in contrast to city-dwellers who are allegedly nomadic, traditionless, irreligious, matter-of-fact, clever, unfruitful, and contemptuous of the countryman. In his view, the cities contain only a &quot;mob&quot;, not a people, and are hostile to the traditions that represent Culture (in Spengler&#x27;s view these traditions are: nobility, the Christian Church, privileges, dynasties, convention in art, and limits on scientific knowledge). He said that city-dwellers possess cold intelligence that confounds peasant wisdom, a naturalism in attitudes towards sex which are a return to primitive instincts, and a reduced inner religiousness. Further, Spengler saw urban wage disputes and large entertainment expenditures as the final aspects that signal the closing of Culture and the rise of the Civilization.

Spengler had a low opinion of Civilizations, even those that engaged in significant expansion, because he said that expansion was not actual growth. One of his principal examples was that of Roman &quot;world domination&quot;. In his view, the Romans faced no significant resistance to their expansion, meaning it was not an achievement as they did not so much conquer their empire, but rather simply took possession of that which lay open to everyone. Spengler said this is a contrast with Roman displays of Cultural energy during the Punic Wars. After the Battle of Zama, Spengler believes that the Romans never waged, or even were capable of waging, a war against a competing great military power.

===Races, peoples, and cultures===
According to Spengler, a race has &quot;roots&quot;, like a plant, which connect it to a landscape. &quot;If, in that home, the race cannot be found, this means the race has ceased to exist. A race does not migrate. Men migrate, and their successive generations are born in ever-changing landscapes; but the landscape exercises a secret force upon the extinction of the old and the appearance of the new one.&quot; In this instance, he uses the word &quot;race&quot; in the tribal and cultural rather than the biological sense, a 19th-century use of the word still common when Spengler wrote.

For this reason, he said a race is not exactly like a plant:

Spengler writes that, 

He distinguishes this from the sort of pseudo-anthropological notions commonly held when the book was written, and he dismisses the idea of &quot;an Aryan skull and a Semitic skull&quot;. He also does not believe language is itself sufficient to create races, and that &quot;the mother tongue&quot; signifies &quot;deep ethical forces&quot; in Late Civilizations rather than Early Cultures, when a race is still developing the language that fits its &quot;race-ideal&quot;.

Closely connected to race, Spengler defined a &quot;people&quot; as a unit of the soul, saying, &quot;The great events of history were not really achieved by peoples; &quot;they themselves created the peoples.&quot; Every act alters the soul of the doer.&quot; He described such events as including migrations and wars, saying that the American people did not migrate from Europe, but were formed by events such as the American Revolution and the American Civil War. &quot;Neither unity of speech nor physical descent is decisive.&quot; He said that what distinguishes a people from a population is &quot;the inwardly lived experience of &#x27;we&#x27;&quot;, and that this exists so long as a people&#x27;s soul lasts: &quot;The name Roman in Hannibal&#x27;s day meant a people, in Trajan&#x27;s time nothing more than a population.&quot; In Spengler&#x27;s view, &quot;Peoples are neither linguistic nor political nor zoological, but spiritual units.&quot;

Spengler disliked the contemporary trend of using a biological definition for race, saying, &quot;Of course, it is quite often justifiable to align peoples with races, but &#x27;race&#x27; in this connexion must not be interpreted in the present-day Darwinian sense of the word. It cannot be accepted, surely, that a people were ever held together by the mere unity of physical origin, or, if it were, could maintain that unity for ten generations. It cannot be too often reiterated that this physiological provenance has no existence except for science—never for folk-consciousness—and that no people was ever stirred to enthusiasm by &quot;this&quot; ideal of blood purity. In race (&quot;Rasse haben&quot;) there is nothing material but something cosmic and directional, the felt harmony of a Destiny, the single cadence of the march of historical Being. It is the incoordination of this (wholly metaphysical) beat which produces race hatred... and it is resonance on this beat that makes the true love—so akin to hate—between man and wife.&quot;

To Spengler, peoples are formed from early prototypes during the Early phase of a Culture. In his view, &quot;Out of the people-shapes of the Carolingian Empire—the Saxons, Swabians, Franks, Visigoths, Lombards—arise suddenly the Germans, the French, the Spaniards, the Italians.&quot; He describes these peoples as products of the spiritual &quot;race&quot; of the great Cultures, and &quot;people under a spell of a Culture are its products and not its authors. These shapes in which humanity is seized and moulded possess style and style-history no less than kinds of art or mode of thought. The people of Athens is a symbol not less than the Doric temple, the Englishman not less than modern physics. There are peoples of Apollonian, Magian, and Faustian cast ... World history is the history of the great Cultures, and peoples are but the symbolic forms and vessels in which the men of these Cultures fulfill their Destinies.&quot;

In saying that race and culture are tied together, Spengler echoes ideas similar to those of Friedrich Ratzel and Rudolf Kjellén. These ideas, which figure prominently in the second volume of the book, were common throughout German culture at the time.

In his later works, such as &quot;Man and Technics&quot; (1931) and &quot;The Hour of Decision&quot; (1933), Spengler expanded upon his &quot;spiritual&quot; theory of race and tied it to his metaphysical notion of eternal war and his belief that &quot;Man is a beast of prey&quot;. The authorities however banned the book.

===Religion and secularity===
Spengler differentiates between manifestations of religion that appear within a Civilization&#x27;s developmental cycle. He sees each Culture as having an initial religious identity, which arises out of the fundamental principle of the culture, and follows a trajectory correlating with that of the Culture. The Religion eventually results in a reformation-like period, after the Culture-Ideal has reached its peak and fulfillment. Spengler views a reformation as representative of decline: the reformation is followed by a period of rationalism, and then a period of second religiousness that correlates with decline. He said that the intellectual creativity of a Culture&#x27;s Late period begins after the reformation, usually ushering in new freedoms in science.

According to Spengler, the scientific stage associated with post-reformation Puritanism contains the fundamentals of Rationalism, and eventually rationalism spreads throughout the Culture and becomes the dominant school of thought. To Spengler, Culture is synonymous with religious creativeness, and every great Culture begins with a religious trend that arises in the countryside, is carried through to the cultural cities, and ends in materialism in the world-cities.

Spengler believed that Enlightenment rationalism undermines and destroys itself, and described a process that passes from unlimited optimism to unqualified skepticism. He said that Cartesian self-centered rationalism leads to schools of thought that do not cognize outside of their own constructed worlds, ignoring actual every-day life experience, and applies criticism to its own artificial world until it exhausts itself in meaninglessness. In his view, the masses give rise to the Second Religiousness in reaction to the educated elites, which manifests as deep suspicion of academia and science.

Spengler said that the Second Religiousness is a harbinger of the decline of mature Civilization into an ahistorical state and occurs concurrently with Caesarism, the final political constitution of Late Civilization. He describes Caesarism as the rise of an authoritarian ruler, a new &#x27;emperor&#x27; akin to Caesar or Augustus, taking the reins in reaction to a decline in creativity, ideology and energy after a Culture has reached its high point and become a Civilization. He said that the Second Religiousness and Caesarism demonstrate a lack of youthful strength or creativity, and the Second Religiousness is simply a rehashing of the original religious trend of the Culture.

Spengler states that Western civilisation would, by 2100AD, revert to its previous form, that of Orthodox Christianity, which was its form before the Great East-West Schism. This is cited by Archimandrite Justin Popovich of Serbia (†1979) as correct.

===Democracy, media, and money===
Spengler said that democracy is the political weapon of &quot;money&quot;, and the media are the means through which money operates a democratic political system. The penetration of money&#x27;s power throughout a society is described as another marker of the shift from Culture to Civilization.

Democracy and plutocracy are equivalent in Spengler&#x27;s argument, and he said the &quot;tragic comedy of the world-improvers and freedom-teachers&quot; is that they are simply assisting money to be more effective. He believed that the principles of equality, natural rights, universal suffrage, and freedom of the press are all disguises for class war of the bourgeois against the aristocracy. Freedom, to Spengler, is a negative concept, only entailing the repudiation of any tradition. He said that freedom of the press requires money, and entails ownership, meaning that it serves money. Similarly, since suffrage involves electoral campaigns, which involve donations, elections serve money as well. Spengler said that the ideologies espoused by candidates, whether Socialism or Liberalism, are set in motion by, and ultimately serve, only money.

Spengler said that in his era money has already won, in the form of democracy. However, he said that in destroying the old elements of the Culture, it prepares the way for the rise of a new and overpowering figure, who he calls the Caesar. Before such a leader, money collapses, and in the Imperial Age the &quot;politics of money&quot; fades away.

Spengler said that the use of one&#x27;s constitutional rights requires money, and that voting can only work as designed in the absence of organized leadership working on the election process. He said that if the election process is organized by political leaders, to the extent that money allows, the vote ceases to be truly significant. In his view, it is no more than a recorded opinion of the masses on the organizations of government over which they possess no positive influence. He said that the greater the concentration of wealth in individuals, the more the fight for political power revolves around questions of money. He believed that this was the necessary end of mature democratic systems, rather than being corruption or degeneracy.

On the subject of the press, Spengler said that instead of conversations between men, the press and the &quot;electrical news-service keep the waking-consciousness of whole people and continents under a deafening drum-fire of theses, catchwords, standpoints, scenes, feelings, day by day and year by year.&quot; He said that money uses the media to turn itself into force—the more spent, the more intense its influence. In addition, a functioning press requires universal education, and he said schooling leads to a demand for the shepherding of the masses, which then becomes an object of party politics. To Spengler, people who believe in the ideal of education prepare the way for the power of the press, and eventually for the rise of the Caesar. He also said there is no longer a need for leaders to impose military service, because the press will stir the public into a frenzy and force their leaders into a conflict.

Spengler believed that the only force which can counter money is blood. He said that Marx&#x27;s critique of capitalism was put forth in the same language and on the same assumptions as capitalism, meaning it is more a recognition of capitalism&#x27;s veracity, than a refutation. He said the only aim of Marxism is to &quot;confer upon objects the advantage of being subjects.&quot;

=== Future ===
The formation of the &quot;battling society of nations&quot; marks the beginning of every civilization. In the following phase, the size of armies and the scale of warfare increase. For us the time of Warring States began with Napoleon, who introduced the idea of military world domination different from the preceding European maritime empires. The trend continues with the American Civil War and the &quot;explosion&quot; of the First World War (the book was published before the Second World War). The next century will be one of actually Warring States. &quot;Within two generations&quot; (from 1922) will start the contest &quot;for the heritage of the whole world,&quot; with continents at stake. The destinies of small states are &quot;without importance to the great march of things.&quot; There are ages of &quot;gigantic conflicts,&quot; like the Warring States in China and wars in the contemporary Roman world. In one such age we find ourselves today and it is accelerated by modern military technology.

&quot;The way from Alexander to Caesar is unambiguous and unavoidable, and the strongest nation of any and every culture, consciously or unconsciously, willing or unwilling, has had to tread it. From the rigor of these facts there is no refuge.&quot; The Hague Conference of 1907 was the prelude of World War, the Washington Conference of 1921 will have been that of other wars. &quot;The alternatives now are to stand fast or go under—there is no middle course. It falls to us to live in the most trying times known to history of a great culture.&quot; The strongest race will win and seize the management of the world.

Synchronously with the acceleration of warfare and the rise of the strongest race to world management, there occurs an &quot;accelerating demolition of ancient forms that leaves the path clear to Caesarism.&quot; This phase began in China c. 600 BC, the Mediterranean c. 450 BC and the modern world c. 1700. Comparing these three ages, Spengler states that &quot;Caesarism&quot; is an inevitable product of such an age and it &quot;suddenly outlines itself on the horizon.&quot; In China the culmination occurred with the First Emperor, in the Mediterranean with Sulla and Pompey and in our world is forthcoming. Spengler selected the Chinese and Roman Empires as most relevant models for the future and argued that the modern world undergoes the same evolution towards &quot;Caesarism&quot; but now on world-wide scale. The present is the last century of the pre-Imperial age of world history to be followed by the &quot;Imperial Age&quot; with the rise of Caesar. The transition from &quot;Napoleonism to Caesarism&quot; is an evolutionary stage universal to every culture and takes two centuries. Hence, modern &quot;Caesarism&quot; is expected in &quot;one century&quot; [=2022].

Caesarism grows on the soil of democracy which is dictatorial money-economics. The mighty ones of the future may possess the Earth as their private property, but they would have a task of caring for this world and this task conflicts with the interests of democratic / money-power age. Hence, there now sets in the final battle in the struggle democracy vs &quot;Caesarism&quot; in which the latter is destined to prevail. &quot;The coming of Caesarism breaks the dictature of money and its political weapon democracy.&quot;

Despite Spengler&#x27;s negative view of democracy, he is neither positive about &quot;Caesarism.&quot; Once the &quot;Imperial Age&quot; of world history has arrived, there are no more great politics. People manage with the situation as it is. In the period of Warring States, &quot;torrents of blood had reddened the pavements of all world cities for the winning of rights without which life seemed not worth the living. A hundred years into the Imperial Age, and even the historians will no longer understand the old controversies.&quot; &quot;Caesarism&quot; means a &quot;kind of government which, irrespective of any constitutional formulation that it may have, is in its inward self a return to thorough formlessness.&quot; It does not matter that the Caesars in history disguised their position under antique forms (such as The Senate and the Roman People in the Roman Imperial Age). The spirit of these forms was dead, and so all institutions, however carefully maintained, were thenceforth destitute of all meaning and weight. Real importance centered in the wholly personal power exercised by the Caesar. A form-fulfilled world degenerates into primitivism and historical periods are replaced by biological stretches of time. Wars between states end to be replaced by private feuds between Caesars. With the accomplished state of &quot;Caesarism,&quot; &quot;high history lays itself down weary to sleep. Man becomes a plant again, dumb and enduring.&quot;

== Reception ==
&quot;The Decline of the West&quot; was widely read by German intellectuals. It has been suggested that it intensified a sense of crisis in Germany following the end of World War I. George Steiner suggested that the work can be seen as one of several books that resulted from the crisis of German culture following Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I, comparable in this respect to the philosopher Ernst Bloch&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit of Utopia&quot; (1918), the theologian Franz Rosenzweig&#x27;s &quot;The Star of Redemption&quot; (1921), the theologian Karl Barth&#x27;s &quot;The Epistle to the Romans&quot; (1922), Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; (1925), and the philosopher Martin Heidegger&#x27;s &quot;Being and Time&quot; (1927).

The book received unfavorable reviews from most scholars even before the release of the second volume, and the stream of criticisms continued for decades. Nevertheless, in Germany the book enjoyed popular success: by 1926 some 100,000 copies were sold.

A 1928 &quot;Time&quot; review of the second volume of &quot;Decline&quot; described the immense influence and controversy Spengler&#x27;s ideas enjoyed in the 1920s: &quot;When the first volume of &quot;The Decline of the West&quot; appeared in Germany a few years ago, thousands of copies were sold. Cultivated European discourse quickly became Spengler-saturated. Spenglerism spurted from the pens of countless disciples. It was imperative to read Spengler, to sympathize or revolt. It still remains so.&quot;

===Critique===
In 1950, the philosopher Theodor W. Adorno published an essay entitled &quot;Spengler after the Downfall&quot; (in ) to commemorate what would have been Spengler&#x27;s 70th birthday. Adorno reassessed Spengler&#x27;s thesis three decades after it had been put forth, in light of the catastrophic destruction of Nazi Germany (although Spengler had not meant &quot;Untergang&quot; in a cataclysmic sense, this was how most authors after World War II interpreted it). As a member of the Frankfurt School of Marxist critical theory, Adorno said he wanted to &quot;turn (Spengler&#x27;s) reactionary ideas toward progressive ends.&quot; He believed that Spengler&#x27;s insights were often more profound than those of his more liberal contemporaries, and his predictions more far-reaching. Adorno saw the rise of the Nazis as confirmation of Spengler&#x27;s ideas about &quot;Caesarism&quot; and the triumph of force-politics over the market. Adorno also drew parallels between Spengler&#x27;s description of the Enlightenment and his own analysis. However, Adorno also criticized Spengler for an overly deterministic view of history, which ignored the unpredictable role that human initiative plays at all times. He quoted the Austrian poet Georg Trakl (1887-1914): &quot;How sickly seem everything that grows&quot; (from the poem &quot;Heiterer Frühling&quot;) to illustrate that decay contains new opportunities for renewal. He also criticizes Spengler&#x27;s use of language, which he called overly reliant on fetishistic terms like &quot;Soul&quot;, &quot;Blood&quot; and &quot;Destiny.&quot; Pope Benedict XVI disagreed with Spengler&#x27;s &quot;biologistic&quot; thesis, citing the arguments of Arnold J. Toynbee, who distinguished between &quot;technological-material progress&quot; and spiritual progress in Western civilizations.

György Lukács criticized The Decline of the West in his book 1953 &quot;The Destruction of Reason&quot;, in a chapter focusing on Oswald Spengler. Outlining Spengler as “dilettantish amateur” on factual level - and being of lesser “philosophical level” compared to the German vitalist (Lebensphilosophie) and/or irrationalist thinkers before him - Lukács saw The Decline of the West as a “victory of extreme historical relativism”. Describing the work of being amateurish, pseudo-historical and exemplary of irrationalist thought, Lukács attacked Spengler for &quot;rejecting causality and laws, recognizing them as the only historical phenomena of given epochs and denying them any competence for scientific and philosophical methodology&quot; and &quot;substituting causality for analogy&quot;, making the &quot;(often shallow) similarities his canon of investigation&quot;. Lukács argued that the work was primarily Spengler’s attempt to turn “all fields of human knowledge subservient to his philosophy of history, no matter whether he personally had truly mastered them or whether they, in themselves, had already yielded unequivocal, philosophically applicable results”. 

German philosopher and sociologist Max Horkheimer also saw Decline of the West and Spengler in negative light, citing the work as an &quot;superficial synthesis of poorly understood material from a wide variety of fields&quot; and condemning Spengler of being a &quot;worst sort&quot; of Lebensphilosophie populist.

* Whittaker Chambers often refers to &quot;Crisis&quot;, a concept which was influenced by Spengler, in &quot;Witness&quot; (it is mentioned in more than 50 pages, including the first page, where it is mentioned in a dozen places), in &quot;Cold Friday&quot; (1964, more than 30 pages), and in other pre-Hiss Case writings. (&quot;His central feeling, repeated in hundreds of statements and similies, is that the West is going into its Spenglerian twilight, a breaking down in which Communism is more a symptom than an agent.&quot;)
* The title of Pat Buchanan book &quot;The Death of the West&quot;, is a reference to &quot;The Decline of the West&quot;
* Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s novel &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; is an allusion to both &quot;The Decline of the West&quot; and Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;
* H. P. Lovecraft was heavily influenced by the book.
* William Gaddis was heavily influenced by the book.

<text>HIV/AIDS originated in the early 20th century and remains a significant public health challenge, particularly in Africa. Although the continent constitutes about 17% of the world&#x27;s population, it bears a disproportionate burden of the epidemic. As of 2023, around 25.6 million people in sub-Saharan Africa were living with HIV, accounting for over two-thirds of the global total. The majority of new infections and AIDS-related deaths occur in Eastern and Southern Africa, which house approximately 55% of the global HIV-positive population.

In regions such as Southern Africa, the epidemic is particularly severe. Countries including Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, Zambia, and Zimbabwe exhibit adult prevalence rates exceeding 10%. This has significantly affected life expectancy, with reductions of up to 20 years in the most impacted areas. By contrast, North Africa, West Africa, and the Horn of Africa report significantly lower prevalence rates, attributed to differing cultural practices and reduced engagement in high-risk behaviors.
Efforts to combat the epidemic have focused on multiple strategies, including the widespread distribution of antiretroviral therapy (ART), which has substantially improved the quality of life and reduced mortality for those living with HIV. Between 2010 and 2020, AIDS-related deaths declined by 43% in sub-Saharan Africa due to increased access to ART and prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs. However, challenges persist, including stigma, insufficient healthcare infrastructure, and funding constraints.

Key regional and international organizations, such as UNAIDS, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the African Union, continue to coordinate responses, aiming to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030. Initiatives such as the PEPFAR program and the Global Fund have been instrumental in scaling up ART distribution and prevention campaigns.

Despite progress, gender inequalities exacerbate the epidemic&#x27;s impact, with young women in sub-Saharan Africa experiencing HIV infection rates three times higher than their male counterparts. Addressing socio-economic factors and enhancing HIV/AIDS education among at-risk populations remain vital components of comprehensive intervention strategies.


==Overview==

In a 2019 research article titled &quot;The Impact of HIV &amp; AIDS in Africa&quot;, the charitable organization AVERT wrote:


==Origins of HIV/AIDS in Africa ==

The earliest known cases of human HIV infection were in western equatorial Africa, probably in southeastern Cameroon where groups of the central common chimpanzee live. &quot;Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all HIV-1 strains known to infect humans, including HIV-1 groups M, N, and O, were closely related to just one of these SIV cpz lineages: that found in P. t. troglodytes [Pan troglodytes troglodytes i.e. the central chimpanzee].&quot; It is suspected that the disease jumped to humans from butchering of chimpanzees for human consumption.

Current hypotheses also include that, once the virus jumped from chimpanzees or other apes to humans, medical practices of the early 20th century helped HIV become established in human populations by 1930. The virus likely moved from primates to humans when hunters came into contact with the blood of infected primates. The hunters then became infected with HIV and passed on the disease to other humans through bodily fluid contamination. This theory is known as the &quot;Bushmeat theory&quot;.

HIV made the leap from rural isolation to rapid urban transmission as a result of urbanization that occurred during the 20th century. There are many reasons why there is such a high prevalence of AIDS in Africa. One of the most formative explanations is the poverty that dramatically impacts the daily lives of Africans. The book, &quot;Ethics and AIDS in Africa: A Challenge to Our Thinking&quot;, describes how &quot;Poverty has accompanying side-effects, such as prostitution (i.e. the need to sell sex for survival), poor living conditions, education, health and health care, that are major contributing factors to the current spread of HIV/AIDS.&quot;

Researchers believe HIV was gradually spread by river travel. All the rivers in Cameroon run into the Sangha River, which joins the Congo River running past Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Trade along the rivers could have spread the virus, which built up slowly in the human population. By the 1960s, about 2,000 people in Africa may have had HIV, including people in Kinshasa whose tissue samples from 1959 and 1960 have been preserved and studied retrospectively. The first epidemic of HIV/AIDS is believed to have occurred in Kinshasa in the 1970s, signaled by a surge in opportunistic infections such as cryptococcal meningitis, Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma, tuberculosis, and pneumonia.

==History ==
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a fatal disease caused by the slow-acting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The virus multiplies in the body until it causes immune system damage, leading to diseases of the AIDS syndrome. HIV emerged in Africa in the 1960s and spread to the United States and Europe the following decade. In the 1980s it spread across the globe until it became a pandemic. Some areas of the world were already significantly impacted by AIDS, while in others the epidemic was just beginning. The virus is transmitted by bodily fluid contact including the exchange of sexual fluids, by blood, from mother to child in the womb, and during delivery or breastfeeding. AIDS first was identified in the United States and France in 1981, principally among homosexual men. Then in 1982 and 1983, heterosexual Africans also were diagnosed.

In the late 1980s, international development agencies regarded AIDS control as a technical medical problem rather than one involving all areas of economic and social life. Because public health authorities perceived AIDS to be an urban phenomenon associated with prostitution, they believed that the majority of Africans who lived in &quot;traditional&quot; rural areas would be spared. They believed that the heterosexual epidemic could be contained by focusing prevention efforts on persuading the so-called core transmitters—people such as sex workers and truck drivers, known to have multiple sex partners—to use condoms. These factors hindered prevention campaigns in many countries for more than a decade.

Although many governments in Sub-Saharan Africa denied that there was a problem for years, they have now begun to work toward solutions.

AIDS was at first considered a disease of gay men and people suffering from drug addiction, but in Africa it took off among the general population. As a result, those involved in the fight against HIV began to emphasize aspects such as preventing transmission from mother to child, or the relationship between HIV and poverty, inequality of the sexes, and so on, rather than emphasizing the need to prevent transmission by unsafe sexual practices or drug injection. This change in emphasis resulted in more funding, but was not effective in preventing a drastic rise in HIV prevalence.

The global response to HIV and AIDS has improved considerably in recent years. Funding comes from many sources, the largest of which are the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the President&#x27;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.

According to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the number of HIV positive people in Africa receiving anti-retroviral treatment rose from 1 million to 7.1 million between 2005 and 2012, an 805% increase. Almost 1 million of those patients were treated in 2012. The number of HIV positive people in South Africa who received such treatment in 2011 was 75.2 percent higher than the number in 2009.

Additionally, the number of AIDS-related deaths in 2011 in both Africa as a whole and Sub-Saharan Africa alone was 32 percent less than the number in 2005. The number of new HIV infections in Africa in 2011 was also 33 percent less than the number in 2001, with a &quot;24% reduction in new infections among children from 2009 to 2011&quot;. In Sub-Saharan Africa, new HIV positive cases over the same period declined by 25%. According to UNAIDS, these successes have resulted from &quot;strong leadership and shared responsibility in Africa and among the global community&quot;.

==Prevention of HIV infections==
===Public education initiatives===

Numerous public education initiatives have been launched to curb the spread of HIV in Africa.

===The role of stigma===

Many activists have drawn attention to stigmatization of those testing as HIV positive. This is due to many factors such as a lack of understanding of the disease, lack of access to treatment, the media, knowing that AIDS is incurable, and prejudices brought on by a cultures beliefs. &quot;When HIV/AIDS became a global disease, Some African leaders played ostrich and said that it was a gay disease found only in the West and Africans did not have to worry because there were no gays and lesbians in Africa&quot;. Africans were blind to the already huge epidemic that was infesting their communities. The belief that only homosexuals could contract the diseases was later debunked as the number of heterosexual couples living with HIV increased. Unfortunately there were other rumors being spread by elders in Cameroon. These &quot;elders speculated that HIV/AIDS was a sexually transmitted disease passed on from Fulani women only to non-Fulani men who had sexual contact with them. They also claimed if a man was infected as a result of having sexual contact with a Fulani woman, only a Fulani healer could treat him&quot;. This communal belief is shared by many other African cultures who believe that HIV and AIDS originated from women. Because of this belief that men can only get HIV from women many &quot;women are not free to speak of their HIV status to their partners for fear of violence&quot;. In general HIV carries a negative stigma in Sub-Saharan Africa. Unfortunately This stigma makes it very challenging for Sub-Saharan Africans to share that they have HIV because they are afraid of being an outcast from their friends and family. In every Sub-Saharan community HIV is seen as the bringer of death. The common belief is that once you have HIV you are destined to die. People seclude themselves based on these beliefs. They do not tell their family and live with guilt and fear because of HIV. However, there is a way to treat HIV and AIDS the problem is that many are just not aware of how HIV is spread or what effects it has on the body. &quot;80.8% of participants would not sleep in the same room as someone who was HIV positive, while 94.5% would not talk to someone who was HIV positive&quot;.

Social stigma plays a significant role in the state of HIV and AIDS infection in Africa. &quot;In a normatively HIV/AIDS-stigmatizing Sub Saharan African communities, this suspicion of one&#x27;s status by others is also applicable to individuals who are not HIV positive, but who may wish to utilize healthcare services for preventive purposes. This group of individuals under fear of suspicion may avoid being mistakenly identified as stigmatized by simply avoiding HARHS utilization.&quot; (151)

&quot;At the individual level, persons living with HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa likely want to conceal their stigmatized identities whenever possible in order to gain these rewards associated with having a &#x27;normal&#x27; identity. The rewards of being considered normal&#x27; in the context of high-HIV-prevalence Sub-Saharan Africa are varied and great... such rewards for which there is empirical support in this context include perceived sexual freedom, avoidance of discrimination, avoidance of community or family rejection, avoidance of losing one&#x27;s job or residence, and avoidance of losing one&#x27;s sexual partners. Other potential rewards of being considered normal include avoidance of being associated with promiscuity or prostitution, avoidance of emotional, social and physical isolation and avoidance of being blamed for others&#x27; illness&quot; (150).

====Combination prevention programs====

The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS defines combination prevention programs as:
&quot;It is the consensus in the HIV scientific community that abstinence, be faithful, use a condom [(ABC)] principles are vital guides for public health intervention, but are better bundled with biomedical prevention approaches; lone behavioral change approaches are not likely to stop the global pandemic.&quot; Uganda has replaced its ABC strategy with a combination prevention program because of an increase in the annual HIV infection rate. Most new infections were coming from people in long-term relationships who had multiple sexual partners.

====Abstinence, be faithful, use a condom====

The abstinence, be faithful, use a condom (ABC) strategy to prevent HIV infection promotes safer sexual behavior and emphasizes the need for fidelity, fewer sexual partners, and a later age of sexual debut. The implementation of ABC differs among those who use it. For example, the President&#x27;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief has focused more on abstinence and fidelity than condoms while Uganda has had a more balanced approach to the three elements.

The effectiveness of ABC is controversial. At the 16th International AIDS Conference in 2006, African countries gave the strategy mixed reviews. In Botswana,
In Nigeria,

In Kenya,
In Ghana, 

An estimated value of about 300,000 people(All ages) have been infected with the HIV virus. This is prevalent and highest in the Eastern Region of Ghana and lowest in the Northern Regions of the country. As part of national efforts to control the wide spread of the HIV virus, the ABC approach is a popular strategy employed for HIV prevention in the country. The virus is higher among women than among men in all age groups with estimates of 56 percent among females and 44 percent among male. Sexual transmission remains the major mode of HIV transmission in Ghana but other approaches such as Information Education and Communication (IEC) and Behavior Change Communication (BCC) are all been used for the course of the virus prevention.

Eswatini in 2010 announced that it was abandoning the ABC strategy because it was a dismal failure in preventing the spread of HIV. &quot;If you look at the increase of HIV in the country while we&#x27;ve been applying the ABC concept all these years, then it is evident that ABC is not the answer,&quot; said Dr. Derek von Wissell, Director of the National Emergency Response Council on HIV/AIDS.

====Prevention efforts====
In 1999, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation provided major funding for the Love Life website, an online sexual health and relationship resource for teenagers.

In 2011, the Botswana Ministry of Education introduced new HIV/AIDS educational technology in local schools. The TeachAids prevention software, developed at Stanford University, was distributed to every primary, secondary, and tertiary educational institution in the country, reaching all learners from 6 to 24 years of age nationwide.

===African Union&#x27;s efforts===

====AIDS Watch Africa====

During the Abuja African Union Summit on HIV/AIDS in April 2001, the heads of state and heads of government of Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, and Uganda established the AIDS Watch Africa (AWA) advocacy platform. The initiative was formed to &quot;accelerate efforts by Heads of State and Government to implement their commitments for the fight against HIV/AIDS, and to mobilize the required national and international resources.&quot; In January 2012, AWA was revitalized to include all of Africa and its objectives were broadened to include malaria and tuberculosis.

====Roadmap on Shared Responsibility and Global Solidarity for AIDS, TB and Malaria Response in Africa====

In 2012, the African Union adopted a &quot;Roadmap on Shared Responsibility and Global Solidarity for AIDS, TB and Malaria Response in Africa&quot;.
This Roadmap outlines a set of African-developed strategies to strengthen shared responsibility and international cooperation for achieving sustainable AIDS solutions in Africa by 2015. The solutions are organized around three strategic pillars: diversified financing; access to medicines; and enhanced health governance. The Roadmap defines goals, results and roles and responsibilities to hold stakeholders accountable for the realization of these solutions between 2012 and 2015.

===Preventing HIV transmission from pregnant women to children===

The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS reported that the following sixteen African nations in 2012 &quot;ensure[d] that more than three-quarters of pregnant women living with HIV receive antiretroviral medicine to prevent transmission to their child&quot;: Botswana, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, São Tomé and Principe, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Eswatini, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

==Causes and spread==

===Behavioral factors===

High-risk behavioral patterns are largely responsible for the significantly greater spread of HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa than in other parts of the world. Chief among these are the traditionally liberal attitudes espoused by many communities inhabiting the subcontinent toward multiple sexual partners and pre-marital and outside marriage sexual activity. HIV transmission is most likely in the first few weeks after infection, and is therefore increased when people have more than one sexual partner in the same time period. In most of the developed world outside Africa, this means HIV transmission is high among prostitutes and other people who may have more than one sexual partner concurrently. Within the cultures of sub-Saharan Africa, it is relatively common for both men and women to be carrying on sexual relations with more than one person, which promotes HIV transmission. This practice is known as concurrency, which Helen Epstein describes in her book, &quot;The Invisible Cure: Africa, the West, and the Fight against AIDS&quot;, in which her research into the sexual mores of Uganda revealed the high frequency with which men and women engage in concurrent sexual relationships. In addition, in sub-Saharan Africa AIDS is the leading killer and a large reason for the high transmission rates is because of the lack of education provided to youth. When infected, most children die within one year because of the lack of treatment. All demographic populations in Sub-Saharan Africa have been infected with HIV, from men to women, and from pregnant women to children. Rather than having more of a specific group infected, male or female, the ratio of men and women infected with HIV are quite similar. With the HIV infection, 77% of men, women, and children, develop AIDS, and die in Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, &quot;more than 90% of AIDS orphans and children [were] infected with HIV&quot;.

Lack of money is an obvious challenge, although a great deal of aid is distributed throughout developing countries with high HIV/AIDS rates. For African countries with advanced medical facilities, patents on many drugs have hindered the ability to make low cost alternatives.

Natural disasters and conflict are also major challenges, as the resulting economic problems people face can drive many young women and girls into patterns of sex work in order to ensure their livelihood or that of their family, or else to obtain safe passage, food, shelter or other resources. Emergencies can also lead to greater exposure to HIV infection through new patterns of sex work. In Mozambique, an influx of humanitarian workers and transporters, such as truck drivers, attracted sex workers from outside the area. Similarly, in the Turkana District of northern Kenya, drought led to a decrease in clients for local sex workers, prompting the sex workers to relax their condom use demands and search for new truck driver clients on main highways and in peri-urban settlements.

===Health industry===
Sub-Saharan &quot;Africans have always appreciated the importance of health care because good health is seen as necessary for the continuation and growth of their lineage&quot;. Without proper health the culture will not be able to thrive and grow. Unfortunately, &quot;health services in many countries are swamped by the need to care for increasing numbers of infected and sick people. Ameliorative drugs are too expensive for most victims, except for a very small number who are affluent&quot;. The greatest number of sick people with the fewest doctors, Sub-Saharan Africa &quot;has 11 percent of the world&#x27;s population but carries 24 percent of the global disease burden. With less than 1 percent of global health expenditure and only 3 percent of the world&#x27;s health workers&quot;.
When family members get sick with HIV or other sicknesses, family members often end up selling most of their belongings in order to provide health care for the individual. Medical facilities in many African countries are lacking. Many health care workers are also not available, in part due to lack of training by governments and in part due to the wooing of these workers by foreign medical organizations where there is a need for medical professionals. Unfortunately, many individuals who get a medical degree end up leaving Sub-Saharan Africa to work abroad &quot;either to escape instability or to practice where they have better working conditions and a higher salary&quot;. Many low income communities are very far away from a hospital and they cannot afford to bus there or pay for medical attention once they arrive. &quot;Healthcare in Africa differs widely, depending on the country and also the region – those living in urban areas are more likely to receive better healthcare services than those in rural or remote regions&quot;. It is very common to just wait out a sickness or seek help from a neighbor or relative. Currently antiretroviral therapy is the closest to a cure. However, many hospitals lack enough antiretroviral drugs to treat everyone. This may be because most Sub-Saharan African countries invest &quot;as little as 1-4 dollars per capita, [so] overseas aid is a major source of funding for healthcare&quot;. Many overseas organizations are very hesitant to give antiretroviral drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa because they are expensive, which means that there is only so much they can give. Relying on other countries for help in general requires more paperwork and faith in another country very far away. Also, delivery of drugs and other aid takes many month and years to arrive in the hands of those that need help.

===Medical factors===

====Medical suspicion====
There are high levels of medical suspicion throughout Africa, and there is evidence that such distrust may have a significant impact on the use of medical services. The distrust of modern medicine is sometimes linked to theories of a &quot;Western Plot&quot; of mass sterilization or population reduction, perhaps a consequence of several high-profile incidents involving western medical practitioners.

===Pharmaceutical industry===

Africans are still fighting against unethical human experimentation and other practices of unfair treatment by the pharmaceutical industry. Medical experimentation occurs in Africa on many medications, but once approved, access to the drug is difficult.

South African scientists in a combined effort with American scientists from Gilead Sciences recently tested and found effective a tenofovir-based anti-retroviral vaginal gel that could be used as pre-exposure prophylaxis. Testing of this gel was conducted at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa. The FDA in the US is in the process of reviewing the drug for approval for US use. The AIDS/HIV epidemic has led to the rise in unethical medical experimentation in Africa.

Since the epidemic is widespread, African governments sometimes relax their laws in order to get research conducted in their countries which they would otherwise not afford. However, global organizations such as the Clinton Foundation, are working to reduce the cost of HIV/AIDS medications in Africa and elsewhere. For example, the philanthropist Inder Singh oversaw a program which reduced the cost of paediatric HIV/AIDS drugs by between 80 and 92 percent by working with manufacturers to reduce production and distribution costs. Manufacturers often cite distribution and production difficulties in developing markets, which create a substantial barrier to entry.

===Political factors===

Major African political leaders have denied the link between HIV and AIDS, favoring alternate theories. The scientific community considers the evidence that HIV causes AIDS to be conclusive and rejects AIDS-denialist claims as pseudoscience based on conspiracy theories, faulty reasoning, cherry picking, and misrepresentation of mainly outdated scientific data.

===Subtype factor===
Subtypes A and C are the most prevalent HIV subtypes in Africa, and subtype C is the most prominent in the world, accounting for about 50% of all HIV infections. Despite this, the majority of HIV research has historically been focused on subtype B, which constitutes only 12% of infections, mostly in Europe. Due to this lack of research, it is currently unclear whether or not subtype C has evolved factors for increased viral transmission compared to other HIV subtypes.

===Religious factors===

Pressure from both Christian and Muslim religious leaders has resulted in the banning of a number of safe-sex campaigns, including condom promoting advertisements.

==Health care delivery==
While there is currently no cure or vaccine for HIV/AIDS there are emerging treatments. It has been extensively discussed that antiretroviral drugs (ART) are crucial for preventing the acquiring of AIDS. AIDS is acquired at the final stage of the HIV virus, which can be completely averted. It is overwhelmingly possible to live with the virus and never acquire AIDS. The proper obedience to ART drugs can provide an infected person with a limitless future. ART drugs are key in preventing the diseases from progressing as well as ensuring the disease is well controlled, thus forbidding the disease from becoming resistant to the treatments. In countries like Nigeria and the Central African Republic, a mere less than 25% of the population has access to the ART drugs. Funds devoted to ART drug access were measured at $19.1 billion in 2013 in low and middle-income countries among the region, however the funds were short of the UNAIDS&#x27; previous resource needs estimates of $22–24 billion by 2015.

==Measurement==
Prevalence measures include everyone living with HIV and AIDS, and present a delayed representation of the epidemic by aggregating the HIV infections of many years. Incidence, in contrast, measures the number of new infections, usually over the previous year. There is no practical, reliable way to assess incidence in Sub-Saharan Africa. Prevalence in 15- to 24-year-old pregnant women attending antenatal clinics is sometimes used as an approximation. The test done to measure prevalence is a sero survey in which blood is tested for the presence of HIV.

Health units that conduct sero surveys rarely operate in remote rural communities, and the data collected also does not measure people who seek alternate healthcare. Extrapolating national data from antenatal surveys relies on assumptions which may not hold across all regions and at different stages in an epidemic.

Thus, there may be significant disparities between official figures and actual HIV prevalence in some countries.

A minority of scientists claim that as many as 40 percent of HIV infections in African adults may be caused by unsafe medical practices rather than by sexual activity. The World Health Organization states that about 2.5 percent of HIV infections in Sub-Saharan Africa are caused by unsafe medical injection practices and the &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; by unprotected sex.

==Regional prevalence==

In contrast to areas in North Africa and the Horn of Africa, traditional cultures and religions in Sub-Saharan Africa have generally exhibited a more liberal attitude to female out-of-marriage sexual activity. The latter includes practices such as multiple sexual partners and unprotected sex, high-risk cultural patterns that have been implicated in the much greater spread of HIV in the subcontinent.

===North Africa===

===Horn of Africa===

As with North Africa, the HIV infection rates in the Horn of Africa are quite low. This has been attributed to the Muslim nature of many of the local communities and adherence to Muslim norms regarding sexuality.

Ethiopia&#x27;s HIV prevalence rate has decreased from 3.6 percent in 2001 to 1.4 percent in 2011. The number of new infections per year also has decreased from 130,000 in 2001 to 24,000 in 2011.

===Central Africa===

HIV infection rates in central Africa are moderate to high.

===Eastern Africa===

HIV infection rates in eastern Africa are moderate to high.

====Kenya====
Kenya, according to a 2008 report from the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, had the third largest number of individuals in Sub-Saharan Africa living with HIV. It also had the highest prevalence rate of any country outside of Southern Africa. Kenya&#x27;s HIV infection rate dropped from around 14 percent in the mid-1990s to 5 percent in 2006, but rose again to 6.2 percent by 2011. The number of newly infected people per year, however, decreased by almost 30 percent, from 140,000 in 2001 to 100,000 in 2011.

As of 2012, Nyanza Province had the highest HIV prevalence rate at 13.9 percent, with the North Eastern Province having the lowest rate at 0.9 percent.

Christian men and women also had a higher infection rate than their Muslim counterparts. This discrepancy was especially visible among women, with Muslim women showing a rate of 2.8 percent versus 8.4 percent among Protestant women and 8 percent among Catholic women. HIV was also more common among the wealthiest than among the poorest (7.2 percent versus 4.6 percent).

Historically, HIV had been more prevalent in urban than rural areas, although the gap is closing rapidly. Men in rural areas are now more likely to be HIV-infected (at 4.5 percent) than those in urban areas (at 3.7 percent).

====Tanzania====
Between 2004 and 2008, the HIV incidence rate in Tanzania for ages 15–44 slowed to 3.37 per 1,000 person-years (4.42 for women and 2.36 for men). The number of newly infected people per year increased slightly, from 140,000 in 2001 to 150,000 in 2011. There were also significantly fewer HIV infections in Zanzibar, which in 2011 had a prevalence rate of 1.0 percent compared to 5.3 percent in mainland Tanzania.

====Uganda====
Uganda has registered a gradual decrease in its HIV rates from 10.6 percent in 1997, to a stabilized 6.5–7.2 percent since 2001. This has been attributed to changing local behavioral patterns, with more respondents reporting greater use of contraceptives and a two-year delay in first sexual activity as well as fewer people reporting casual sexual encounters and multiple partners.

The number of newly infected people per year, however, has increased by over 50 percent, from 99,000 in 2001 to 150,000 in 2011. More than 40 percent of new infections are among married couples, indicating widespread and increasing infidelity. This increase has caused alarm. The director of the Centre for Disease Control – Uganda, Wuhib Tadesse, said in 2011 that,


===Western Africa===

Western Africa has moderate levels of infection of both HIV-1 and HIV-2. The onset of the HIV epidemic in the region began in 1985 with reported cases in Senegal, Benin, and Nigeria. These were followed in 1986 by Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. The first identification of HIV-2 occurred in Senegal by microbiologist Souleymane Mboup and his collaborators.

HIV prevalence in western Africa is lowest in Senegal and highest in Nigeria, which has the second largest number of people living with HIV in Africa after South Africa. Nigeria&#x27;s infection rate (number of patients relative to the entire population), however, is much lower (3.7 percent) compared to South Africa&#x27;s (17.3 percent).

In Niger in 2011, the national HIV prevalence rate for ages 15–49 was 0.8 percent while for sex workers it was 36 percent.

===Southern Africa===
In the mid-1980s, HIV and AIDS were virtually unheard of in southern Africa. However, it is now the worst-affected region in the world. Currently, Eswatini and Lesotho have the highest and second highest HIV prevalence rates in the world, respectively. Of the nine southern African countries (Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, Zambia, and Zimbabwe), four are estimated to have an infection rate of over 15 percent.

In Botswana, the number of newly infected people per year has declined by 67 percent, from 27,000 in 2001 to 9,000 in 2011. In Malawi, the decrease has been 54 percent, from 100,000 in 2001 to 46,000 in 2011. All but two of the other countries in this region have also recorded major decreases (Namibia, 62 percent; Zambia, 54 percent; Zimbabwe, 47 percent; South Africa, 38 percent; Eswatini, 32 percent). The number has remained virtually the same in Lesotho and Mozambique.

Zimbabwe&#x27;s first reported case of HIV was in 1985.

There are widespread practices of sexual networking that involve multiple overlapping or concurrent sexual partners. Men&#x27;s sexual networks, in particular, tend to be quite extensive, a fact that is tacitly accepted or even encouraged by many communities. Along with having multiple sexual partners, unemployment and population displacements resulting from drought and conflict have contributed to the spread of HIV/AIDS. According to Susser and Stein (2000), men refuse to use condoms during intercourse with girls or women performing sex work (p. 1043–1044). The girls and women are in desperate need of money and do not have a choice. This leads to multiple sex partners, which increases the likelihood of their infection with HIV/AIDS.

A 2008 study in Botswana, Namibia, and Eswatini found that intimate partner violence, extreme poverty, education, and partner income disparity explained almost all of the differences in HIV status among adults aged 15–29 years. Among young women with any one of these factors, the HIV rate increased from 7.7 percent with no factors to 17.1 percent. Approximately 26 percent of young women with any two factors were HIV positive, with 36 percent of those with any three factors and 39.3 percent of those with all four factors being HIV-positive.

====Eswatini====
As of 2011, the HIV prevalence rate in Eswatini was the highest in the world at 26.0 percent of persons aged 15–49. The United Nations Development Program wrote in 2005,

The HIV epidemic in Eswatini has reduced its life expectancy at birth to 49 for men and 51 for women (based on 2009 data). Life expectancy at birth in 1990 was 59 for men and 62 for women.

Based on 2011 data, Eswatini&#x27;s crude death rate of 19.51 per 1,000 people per year was the third highest in the world, behind only Lesotho and Sierra Leone. HIV/AIDS in 2002 caused 64 percent of all deaths in the country.

==Tuberculosis coinfections==
Much of the deadliness of the epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa is caused by a deadly synergy between HIV and tuberculosis, termed a &quot;co-epidemic&quot;. The two diseases have been &quot;inextricably bound together&quot; since the beginning of the HIV epidemic. &quot;Tuberculosis and HIV co-infections are associated with special diagnostic and therapeutic challenges and constitute an immense burden on healthcare systems of heavily infected countries like Ethiopia.&quot; In many countries without adequate resources, the tuberculosis case rate has increased five to ten-fold since the identification of HIV. Without proper treatment, an estimated 90 percent of persons living with HIV die within months after contracting tuberculosis. The initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy in persons coinfected with tuberculosis can cause an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome with a worsening, in some cases severe worsening, of tuberculosis infection and symptoms.

An estimated 874,000 people in Sub-Saharan Africa were living with both HIV and tuberculosis in 2011, with 330,000 in South Africa, 83,000 in Mozambique, 50,000 in Nigeria, 47,000 in Kenya, and 46,000 in Zimbabwe. In terms of cases per 100,000 population, Eswatini&#x27;s rate of 1,010 per 100,000, or approximately 1%, was by far the highest in 2011. In the following 20 African countries, the cases-per-100,000 coinfection rate has increased at least 20 percent between 2000 and 2011: Algeria, Angola, Chad, Comoros, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, The Gambia, Lesotho, Liberia, Mauritania, Mauritius, Morocco, Mozambique, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Eswatini, Togo, and Tunisia.

Since 2004, however, tuberculosis-related deaths among people living with HIV have fallen by 28 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa, which is home to nearly 80 percent of the people worldwide who are living with both diseases.

<text>A multiplayer video game is a video game in which more than one person can play in the same game environment at the same time, either locally on the same computing system (couch co-op), on different computing systems via a local area network, or via a wide area network, most commonly the Internet (e.g. &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty&quot;, &quot;DayZ&quot;). Multiplayer games usually require players to share a single game system or use networking technology to play together over a greater distance; players may compete against one or more human contestants, work cooperatively with a human partner to achieve a common goal, or supervise other players&#x27; activity. Due to multiplayer games allowing players to interact with other individuals, they provide an element of social communication absent from single-player games.

The history of multiplayer video games extends over several decades, tracing back to the emergence of electronic gaming in the mid-20th century. One of the earliest instances of multiplayer interaction was witnessed with the development of &quot;Spacewar!&quot; in 1962 for the DEC PDP-1 computer by Steve Russell and colleagues at the MIT. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, multiplayer gaming gained momentum within the arcade scene with classics like &quot;Pong&quot; and &quot;Tank&quot;. The transition to home gaming consoles in the 1980s further popularized multiplayer gaming. Titles like &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; for the NES and &quot;Golden Axe&quot; for the Sega Genesis introduced cooperative and competitive gameplay. Additionally, LAN gaming emerged in the late 1980s, enabling players to connect multiple computers for multiplayer gameplay, popularized by titles like &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Players can also play together in the same room using splitscreen.

== Non-networked ==
Some of the earliest video games were two-player games, including early sports games (such as 1958&#x27;s &quot;Tennis For Two&quot; and 1972&#x27;s &quot;Pong&quot;), early shooter games such as &quot;Spacewar!&quot; (1962) and early racing video games such as &quot;Astro Race&quot; (1973). The first examples of multiplayer real-time games were developed on the PLATO system about 1973. Multi-user games developed on this system included 1973&#x27;s Empire and 1974&#x27;s Spasim; the latter was an early first-person shooter. Other early video games included turn-based multiplayer modes, popular in tabletop arcade machines. In such games, play is alternated at some point (often after the loss of a life). All players&#x27; scores are often displayed onscreen so players can see their relative standing. Danielle Bunten Berry created some of the first multiplayer video games, such as her debut, &quot;Wheeler Dealers&quot; (1978) and her most notable work, &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; (1983).

&quot;Gauntlet&quot; (1985) and &quot;Quartet&quot; (1986) introduced co-operative 4-player gaming to the arcades. The games had broader consoles to allow for four sets of controls.

===Networked===
Ken Wasserman and Tim Stryker identified three factors which make networked computer games appealing:

# Multiple humans competing with each other instead of a computer
# Incomplete information resulting in suspense and risk-taking
# Real-time play requiring quick reaction

John G. Kemeny wrote in 1972 that software running on the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS) had recently gained the ability to support multiple simultaneous users, and that games were the first use of the functionality. DTSS&#x27;s popular American football game, he said, now supported head-to-head play by two humans.

The first large-scale serial sessions using a single computer were STAR (based on &quot;Star Trek&quot;), OCEAN (a battle using ships, submarines and helicopters, with players divided between two combating cities) and 1975&#x27;s CAVE (based on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;), created by Christopher Caldwell (with artwork and suggestions by Roger Long and assembly coding by Robert Kenney) on the University of New Hampshire&#x27;s DECsystem-1090. The university&#x27;s computer system had hundreds of terminals, connected (via serial lines) through cluster PDP-11s for student, teacher, and staff access. The games had a program running on each terminal (for each player), sharing a segment of shared memory (known as the &quot;high segment&quot; in the OS TOPS-10). The games became popular, and the university often banned them because of their RAM use. STAR was based on 1974&#x27;s single-user, turn-oriented BASIC program STAR, written by Michael O&#x27;Shaughnessy at UNH.

Wasserman and Stryker in 1980 described in &quot;BYTE&quot; how to network two Commodore PET computers with a cable. Their article includes a type-in, two-player Hangman, and describes the authors&#x27; more-sophisticated &quot;Flash Attack&quot;. SuperSet Software&#x27;s &quot;Snipes&quot; (1981) uses networking technology that would become Novell NetWare. Digital Equipment Corporation distributed another multi-user version of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Decwar, without real-time screen updating; it was widely distributed to universities with DECsystem-10s. In 1981 Cliff Zimmerman wrote an homage to &quot;Star Trek&quot; in MACRO-10 for DECsystem-10s and -20s using VT100-series graphics. &quot;VTtrek&quot; pitted four Federation players against four Klingons in a three-dimensional universe.

&quot;Flight Simulator II&quot;, released in 1986 for the Atari ST and Commodore Amiga, allowed two players to connect via modem or serial cable and fly together in a shared environment.

&quot;MIDI Maze&quot;, an early first-person shooter released in 1987 for the Atari ST, featured network multiplay through a MIDI interface before Ethernet and Internet play became common. It is considered the first multiplayer 3D shooter on a mainstream system, and the first network multiplayer action-game (with support for up to 16 players). There followed ports to a number of platforms (including Game Boy and Super NES) in 1991 under the title &quot;Faceball 2000&quot;, making it one of the first handheld, multi-platform first-person shooters and an early console example of the genre.

Networked multiplayer gaming modes are known as &quot;netplay&quot;. The first popular video-game title with a Local Area Network(LAN) version, 1991&#x27;s Spectre for the Apple Macintosh, featured AppleTalk support for up to eight players. Spectre&#x27;s popularity was partially attributed to the display of a player&#x27;s name above their cybertank. There followed 1993&#x27;s Doom, whose first network version allowed four simultaneous players.

Play-by-email multiplayer games use email to communicate between computers. Other turn-based variations not requiring players to be online simultaneously are Play-by-post gaming and Play-by-Internet. Some online games are &quot;massively multiplayer&quot;, with many players participating simultaneously. Two massively multiplayer genres are MMORPG (such as &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; or &quot;EverQuest&quot;) and MMORTS.

First-person shooters have become popular multiplayer games; &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; and &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; have little (or no) single-player gameplay. Developer and gaming site OMGPOP&#x27;s library included multiplayer Flash games for the casual player until it was shut down in 2013. Some networked multiplayer games, including MUDs and massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) such as RuneScape, omit a single-player mode. The largest MMO in 2008 was &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, with over 10 million registered players worldwide. &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; would hit its peak at 12 million players two years later in 2010, and in 2023 earned the Guinness World Record for best selling MMO video game. This category of games requires multiple machines to connect via the Internet; before the Internet became popular, MUDs were played on time-sharing computer systems and games like &quot;Doom&quot; were played on a LAN.

Beginning with the Sega NetLink in 1996, Game.com in 1997 and Dreamcast in 2000, game consoles support network gaming over LANs and the Internet. Many mobile phones and handheld consoles also offer wireless gaming with Bluetooth (or similar) technology. By the early 2010s online gaming had become a mainstay of console platforms such as Xbox and PlayStation. During the 2010s, as the number of Internet users increased, two new video game genres rapidly gained worldwide popularitymultiplayer online battle arena and battle royale game, both designed exclusively for multiplayer gameplay over the Internet.

Over time the number of people playing video games has increased. In 2020, the majority of households in the United States have an occupant that plays video games, and 65% of gamers play multiplayer games with others either online or in person.

==Local multiplayer==

For some games, &quot;multiplayer&quot; implies that players are playing on the same gaming system or network. This applies to all arcade games, but also to a number of console, and personal computer games too. Local multiplayer games played on a singular system sometimes use split screen, so each player has an individual view of the action (important in first-person shooters and in racing video games) Nearly all multiplayer modes on beat &#x27;em up games have a single-system option, but racing games have started to abandon split-screen in favor of a multiple-system, multiplayer mode. Turn-based games such as chess also lend themselves to single system single screen and even to a single controller.
Multiple types of games allow players to use local multiplayer. The term &quot;local co-op&quot; or &quot;couch co-op&quot; refers to local multiplayer games played in a cooperative manner on the same system; these may use split-screen or some other display method. Another option is hot-seat games. Hot-seat games are typically turn-based games with only one controller or input setsuch as a single keyboard/mouse on the system. Players rotate using the input device to perform their turn such that each is taking a turn on the &quot;hot-seat&quot;.

Not all local multiplayer games are played on the same console or personal computer. Some local multiplayer games are played over a LAN. This involves multiple devices using one local network to play together. Networked multiplayer games on LAN eliminate common problems faced when playing online such as lag and anonymity. Games played on a LAN network are the focus of LAN parties. While local co-op and LAN parties still take place, there has been a decrease in both due to an increasing number of players and games utilizing online multiplayer gaming.

== Online multiplayer ==
Online multiplayer games connect players over a wide area network (a common example being the Internet). Unlike local multiplayer, players playing online multiplayer are not restricted to the same local network. This allows players to interact with others from a much greater distance.

Playing multiplayer online offers the benefits of distance, but it also comes with its own unique challenges. Gamers refer to latency using the term &quot;ping&quot;, after a utility which measures round-trip network communication delays (by the use of ICMP packets). A player on a DSL connection with a 50-ms ping can react faster than a modem user with a 350-ms average latency. Other problems include packet loss and choke, which can prevent a player from &quot;registering&quot; their actions with a server. In first-person shooters, this problem appears when bullets hit the enemy without damage. The player&#x27;s connection is not the only factor; some servers are slower than others.

A server that is geographically closer to the player&#x27;s connection will often provide a lower ping. Data packets travel faster to a location that is closer to them. How far the device is from an internet connection (router) can also affect latency.

==Asymmetrical gameplay==
Asymmetrical multiplayer is a type of gameplay in which players can have significantly different roles or abilities from each otherenough to provide a significantly different experience of the game. In games with light asymmetry, the players share some of the same basic mechanics (such as movement and death), yet have different roles in the game; this is a common feature of the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre such as &quot;League of Legends&quot; and &quot;Dota 2&quot;, and in hero shooters such as &quot;Overwatch&quot; and &quot;Apex Legends&quot;. A first-person shooter that adopts the asymmetrical multiplayer system is Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six Siege. Giving players their own special operator changes every player&#x27;s experience. This puts an emphasis on players improvising their own game plan given the abilities their character has. In games with stronger elements of asymmetry, one player/team may have one gameplay experience (or be in softly asymmetric roles) while the other player or team play in a drastically different way, with different mechanics, a different type of objective, or both. Examples of games with strong asymmetry include &quot;Dead by Daylight&quot;, &quot;Evolve&quot;, and &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot;.

==Asynchronous multiplayer==
Asynchronous multiplayer is a form of multiplayer gameplay where players do not have to be playing at the same time. This form of multiplayer game has its origins in play-by-mail games, where players would send their moves through postal mail to a game master, who then would compile and send out results for the next turn. Play-by-mail games transitioned to electronic form as play-by-email games. Similar games were developed for bulletin board systems, such as &quot;Trade Wars&quot;, where the turn structure may not be as rigorous and allow players to take actions at any time in a persistence space alongside all other players, a concept known as sporadic play.

These types of asynchronous multiplayer games waned with the widespread availability of the Internet which allowed players to play against each other simultaneously, but remains an option in many strategy-related games, such as the &quot;Civilization&quot; series. Coordination of turns are subsequently managed by one computer or a centralized server. Further, many mobile games are based on sporadic play and use social interactions with other players, lacking direct player versus player game modes but allowing players to influence other players&#x27; games, coordinated through central game servers, another facet of asynchronous play.

==Online cheating==

Online cheating (in gaming) usually refers to modifying the game experience to give one player an advantage over others, such as using an &quot;aimbot&quot;a program which automatically locks the player&#x27;s crosshairs onto a targetin shooting games. This is also known as &quot;hacking&quot; or &quot;glitching&quot; (&quot;glitching&quot; refers to using a glitch, or a mistake in the code of a game, whereas &quot;hacking&quot; is manipulating the code of a game). Cheating in video games is often done via a third-party program that modifies the game&#x27;s code at runtime to give one or more players an advantage. In other situations, it is frequently done by changing the game&#x27;s files to change the game&#x27;s mechanics.

<text>Reform refers to the improvement or amendment of what is wrong, corrupt, unsatisfactory, etc. The modern usage of the word emerged in the late 18th century and is believed to have originated from Christopher Wyvill&#x27;s Association movement, which identified “Parliamentary Reform” as its primary aim. Reform is generally considered antithetical to revolution.

Developing countries may implement a range of reforms to improve living standards, often with support from international financial institutions and aid agencies. This can involve reforms to macroeconomic policy, the civil service, and public financial management.

In the United States, rotation in office or term limits would, in contrast, be more revolutionary, by altering basic political connections between incumbents and constituents.
Reform capacity might be limited by the political system or state capacity.

==Re-form==
When used to describe something which is physically formed again, such as re-casting (moulding) or a band that gets back together, the proper term is &quot;re-form&quot; (with a hyphen), not &quot;reform&quot;.

<doc id="350699" wikidata="Q17084339" url="?curid=350699" title="One Big Union (concept)">
<text>The One Big Union is an idea originating in the late 19th and early 20th centuries amongst trade unionists to unite the interests of workers and offer solutions to all labour problems.

Unions initially organized as craft unions. Workers were organized by their skill: carpenters, plumbers, bricklayers, each into their respective unions. Capitalists could often divide craft unionists along these lines in demarcation disputes. As capitalist enterprises and state bureaucracies became more centralized and larger, some workers felt that their institutions needed to become similarly large. A simultaneous disenchantment with the perceived weakness of craft unions caused many unions to organize along industrial lines. The idea of the &quot;one big union&quot; is championed by anarchist syndicalists to organize effectively.

As envisioned by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), which for many years prior to 1919 had been associated with the concept, One Big Union was not just the idea that all workers should be organized into one big union. In the 1911 pamphlet &quot;One Big Union&quot;, IWW supporters Thomas J. Hagerty and William Trautmann enumerated two goals: One Big Union needed to &quot;combine the wage-workers in such a way that it can most successfully fight the battles and protect the interests of the workers of today in their struggles for fewer hours of toil, more wages and better conditions,&quot; and it also &quot;must offer a final solution of the labor problem – an emancipation from strikes, injunctions, bull-pens, and scabbing of one against the other.&quot;

One Big Union was the notional organizational concept, while the IWW&#x27;s revolutionary industrial unionism was the organizing method by which that concept could be realized. &quot;Organizing the One Big Union of all workers the world over&quot; was meant to achieve &quot;working class control&quot;. But the One Big Union organizations were resisted by government and industry, and subverted by existing trade unions. By 1925, only the slogan of One Big Union remained.

==One Big Union in practice==
The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) adopted and promoted the concept of the One Big Union after the publication of the &quot;One Big Union&quot; pamphlet in 1911; the IWW continues to use the phrase. Members of the IWW historically, and currently, signed and sign letters (and other communications) with the closing, &quot;Yours for the O.B.U.&quot; Many commentators regard One Big Union as synonymous with the Industrial Workers of the World. One of the popular IWW publications was called &quot;One Big Union Monthly&quot;.

The IWW promoted the One Big Union concept in various ways, including as an invitation to racial equality. One IWW leaflet proclaimed:
To Colored Workingmen and Women: If you are a wage worker you are welcome in the I.W.W. halls, no matter what your color. By this you may see that the I.W.W. is not a white man&#x27;s union, not a black man&#x27;s union, not a red or yellow man&#x27;s union, but a working man&#x27;s union. All of the working class in one big union.
The IWW used the same sort of arguments to welcome women into the workforce. The appeal subsequently proclaimed the intent to organize &quot;all wage workers ... into One Big Union, regardless of creed, color, or nationality ... An injury to one is an injury to all.&quot; The One Big Union idea had the immediate goals of better pay, shorter hours, and better surroundings. The IWW propagandized, &quot;Organize in one big union and fight for a chance to live as human beings should live. All together now and victory will be ours.&quot;

==History==

===North America===

====Founding organizations====
In North America, the most significant early impetus for the One Big Union concept came from the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) which was headquartered in Denver, Colorado. The WFM and its allies first launched the Western Labor Union (WLU). The Western Labor Union was initially intended to displace the conservative American Federation of Labor (AFL) in the West. The WLU&#x27;s rebranding in 1902 as the American Labor Union (ALU) was a direct response to actions by (AFL) President Samuel Gompers.

The WFM and the ALU then cooperated to found the IWW. The IWW was conceived as a global union with the goal of organizing the entire world. The concept of One Big Union, growing out of the IWW&#x27;s revolutionary program, evolved over a period of time:
[I]n moving toward revolutionary industrial unionism, Denver&#x27;s labor radicals were not building from scratch; rather, they drew upon and elaborated ideas and strategies generated by the previous twenty years of Denver&#x27;s labor history ... [A]lthough the labor wars of 1903–4 may have &quot;triggered&quot; the formation of the IWW, the ideological synthesis it would uphold had been worked out in the American Labor Union&#x27;s leadership by the summer of 1903 ...
The WFM had been founded as a conservative trade union after a bitter and violent strike in Coeur d&#x27;Alene in 1892. The WFM conducted a successful strike in Cripple Creek in 1894, notable for the exceedingly rare intervention of the state on the side of the striking miners. But the strike which some historians believe shaped the philosophy and tactics of the WFM, and which ultimately resulted in the WFM embracing revolutionary industrial unionism and the eventual promulgation of the One Big Union concept, occurred against mine owners in Leadville. Out of that struggle came the November 1897 proclamation of the State Trades and Labor Council of Montana, a document which broke with the past – declaring that &quot;the old form of organization is unable to cope with the recent aggressions of plutocracy&quot; – and called for a new type of labour organization.

The WFM wasn&#x27;t that organization. It had poured resources into the Leadville strike, and yet was defeated. Additional resources which had been promised by the AFL were not provided. The solution was organizing western labourers and western unions into a new umbrella-like federation (i.e., the WLU, the ALU, and eventually, the IWW). These conclusions represented &quot;an absolute rejection&quot; of the AFL, of its conservative philosophy and its complacent demeanour.

But the WFM did undergo substantial changes. In contrast to the AFL, the WFM,
... opened itself to all potential members and also to ideas and values in conflict with Capitalism. It accepted any member of a bona fide union without initiation fee upon presentation of a valid union card. It demanded neither a closed shop nor an exclusive employment contract. It sought jobs for all, not merely the organized and highly skilled few.
Members of the WFM &quot;... saw no advantage to huddling within their traditional crafts; they sought to mobilize all workers across a given industry to confront employers – and governments – with their aggregate clout. With little stake in the status quo, they invested their faith in sweeping political programs to remedy the grim conditions in which they worked and lived.&quot;

In 1905, WFM leaders initiated a meeting of thirty prominent socialists and labour radicals in Chicago. This group analysed industrial and social relations from the revolutionary viewpoint and drafted a manifesto. Enumerating labour&#x27;s grievances, it criticized craft unions for creating a skilled aristocracy, and suggested &quot;one big industrial union&quot; embracing all industries and &quot;founded on the class struggle&quot;. Printed in great quantities, this invitation to the first convention of the IWW was sent around the country.

====The One Big Union concept grows====
The IWW organized in the United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries, employed creative tactics, and advocated the general strike as a favourite method for workers to gain control of industries. But One Big Union spread far beyond the IWW. The revolutionary character of the OBU can be appreciated from a statement by the Brotherhood of Metal Workers&#x27; Industrial Union, a 1909 offshoot of the International Association of Machinists. In 1919, this organization published the following,
The workers, not only of America, but of all countries, are determined to get the full value of the price they paid and will yet pay. There can be no peace until the workers not only control, but also own, the means of life, liberty, and happiness. To accomplish this, it necessitates the ownership of all industries by a government of workers, for the workers, which can and will be accomplished by the One Big Union.
Also in 1919, the International Federation of Workers in the Hotel, Restaurant, Lunchroom, Club and Catering Industry (IFWHRLC) called upon its members to terminate any AFL memberships and was judged by investigators, on the basis of an explanation of industrial unionism in the &quot;Hotel Worker&quot;, one of its publications, to be a &quot;revolutionary organization based upon the One Big Union principle, having for its objective the establishment of a new social order and the seizure of industry.&quot; The &quot;Hotel Worker&quot; stated, in part:
Under industrial unionism, all the Workers in one industry form One Big Union of that industry.

Instead of being split up into a lot of separate units, with divided and often conflicting interests, they strengthen and unite their forces in one mighty and irresistible combination.
The Journeymen Bakers&#x27; and Confectioners&#x27; International Union of America (JBCIUA) came under suspicion for hosting a delegation of the IWW, and for forming a committee to explore a merger with the IFWHRLC. Investigators concluded that such events confirmed &quot;the organization of One Big Union along I. W. W. lines to control all the workers in the food industry in this state, as well as in the greater part of the country.&quot; Cognizant of repression of the period that came to be called the Red Scare, the JBCIUA passed a resolution which stated, in part, &quot;... that our best friends and are being by the capitalistic system, in the present period of worst reaction, and have been thrown into jail for long terms.&quot;

In 1919 in the United States the newly formed Communist Labor Party (CLP) sought to attach itself to the One Big Union movement, and to industrial unionism. The CLP urged all its members to join industrial unions. The IWW concluded that the Russian revolution and local communist activities had a divisive effect on the general anti-capitalist movement, but this effect was not immediately apparent.

====Canada====
In 1919 in Canada, unionists who were discontent with policies of the Trades and Labour Congress of the Dominion formed a union called &quot;One Big Union&quot; (OBU). The Canadian OBU movement had been inspired by the IWW, and like the IWW, it favoured the general strike. The concept of One Big Union in western Canada did not gain widespread acceptance until the &quot;Western Labor News&quot; reported that the idea had been adopted by the Australian Workers International Industrial Union in South Melbourne, Australia. That Australian workers&#x27; organization went beyond industrial unionism to advocate the abolition of private ownership of the means of production. Because of recent history in Western Canada, an increasing acceptance of industrial unionism accompanied a growing appreciation of the general strike, and the need for an OBU to call it. A mood of militancy had been growing in Western Canada for some time.

The OBU spread rapidly in Canada. Lodges, trades councils, and provincial federations withdrew from their international organizations, and joined the OBU, culminating in a membership of nearly fifty thousand the first year. The OBU also generated considerable support for dual affiliation. This incarnation of the OBU movement was also attacked by mainstream labour, in the person of John L. Lewis and other AFL officials.

The One Big Union organization in Canada differed structurally from the IWW. While the IWW organized on industrial lines, the OBU of Canada focused more on organizing workers geographically. The absence of an existing industrial union structure within the Canadian OBU resulted in the defection of 20,000 members of the Lumber Workers Industrial Union (LWIU). According to the 1922 publication &quot;Industrial Unionism in America&quot;, &quot;Their withdrawal was a staggering blow from which the O. B. U. [never] recovered.&quot;

When the IWW in the United States was suppressed during the Red Scare and the Palmer Raids, there was pressure to similarly attack Canada&#x27;s One Big Union movement:
The movement was got well under way with a basis of I.W.W. and Socialist support; Calgary was a centre of the movement as it had been in the Alberta mining unrest of these years. So obvious was the current of thought that the Calgary &quot;Herald&quot; of Sept. 6th struck a warning note: &quot;There is an element in Western Canada that is somewhat akin to the I.W.W. if not actually affiliated with and controlled by it. Let the I.W.W. of Canada or their imitators, beware lest the strong hand of the law does not stretch out and grasp them as it has their friends on the other side of the 49th parallel. There is a feeling throughout the country that it would be better for all concerned if a few of them were behind the bars.&quot;
The Canadian government imprisoned the most prominent members of the Canadian OBU.

===Australia===
The One Big Union movement was organized in Australia. The concept was initially considered in 1908, when the idea of adopting the preamble of the Industrial Workers of the World was voted upon by the New South Wales Trade Union Congress, and the first concrete step toward one big union was adopted in 1912. In 1917, George Beeby, the labour minister for the New South Wales government, said in a speech,
... an important conference of Trade Unionists was held in Sydney to further the idea of one big union. The men responsible for that gathering openly said that their object was to get the Unionists formed into a one big union organisation which, at any time, by the proclamation of a general strike, could stop all production and transport, and force from any government in office whatever concessions were demanded. ... The men at the head of this movement are in favour of direct action as against political action ... With consummate skill the men who initiated this idea have got possession of the whole Labour movement.
An organization called the One Big Union Propaganda League (OBUPL) was formed in Brisbane on 10 September 1918, growing out of former IWW strongholds in the north. With help from IWW members, the OBUPL gained considerable support from the rank and file of craft unions, emphasizing job control and bottom-up organizing.

Australian trade union officials, succeeded in changing the character of the OBU from that envisioned by the IWW, and also by the Workers&#x27; International Industrial Union (WIIU), a group that had split off from the IWW, and was active in Australia. The One Big Union movement ceased to challenge capitalism in Australia, but rather sought to function within capitalism; it evolved from an industrial to a craft basis; it developed into a top-down bureaucracy. By 1924 the Australian OBU ceased to be viable.

In 1927, the Australian Council of Trade Unions was established as an attempt to establish a One Big Union.

===Relationship with mainstream unions===
The goal of the IWW – as interpreted by government investigators in 1920 – was &quot;to break up the system of craft or trade unions, and to organize workers into One Big Union having subdivisions along the lines of industry, rather than those of trade.&quot; That interpretation appears to have been accepted by American Federation of Labor Gompers who in 1922 expressed his belief that the One Big Union idea was designed primarily to put the American Federation of Labor out of business. Gompers undermined any labour actions that he perceived might be related to the One Big Union movement; for example, the Winnipeg General Strike and the Seattle General Strike. A 1919 editorial in &quot;Revolutionary Age&quot;, the official organ of the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party, proclaimed:
The union bureaucrats are particularly against industrial unionism, since industrial unionism ends craft divisions and craft disputes, which constitute the power of the union bureaucracy. In Canada, the One Big Union – Industrial Unionism – has captured the imagination of the organized workers. The One Big Union directed the great general strike in Canada; but, says an observer, &quot;the International Brotherhoods have come out against the strikers, shrewdly foreseeing in the One Big Union the destruction of their organization.&quot; This is a damning indictment of the old unionism.
In June 1919, the American Federation of Labor (AFL), in session in Atlantic City, New Jersey, passed resolutions in general opposition to the general strike. The official report of these proceedings described the convention as the &quot;largest and in all probability the most important Convention ever held&quot; by the organization, in part for having engineered the &quot;overwhelming defeat of the so-called Radical element&quot; via crushing a &#x27;One Big Union&#x27; proposition and a proposal for a nationwide general strike, both by a vote of more than 20 to 1.&quot; The AFL amended its constitution to disallow any central labour union (i.e., regional labour councils) from &quot;taking a strike vote without prior authorization of the national officers of the union concerned.&quot; The change was intended to &quot;check the spread of general strike sentiment and prevent recurrences of what happened at Seattle and is now going on at Winnipeg.&quot; The penalty for any unauthorized strike vote was revocation of that body&#x27;s charter.

In 1919 the Lusk Committee, charged with exposing and stamping out radicalism of all types, issued a report that found the AFL to be &quot;free from the taint of revolutionary radicalism.&quot; It found one AFL affiliate, the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union (ILGWU), to have &quot;marked radical tendencies ... it is founded upon the principles of class struggle ... it adopts the One Big Union idea and seeks to bring about the overthrow of society.&quot;

One Big Union Canada also came under considerable pressure from the Canadian Trades and Labour Congress and the AFL. The United Mine Workers (UMW), in particular, came to an agreement with employers to freeze out the Canadian One Big Union.

In June 1919, the UMW revoked the charter of District 18, which included Alberta and British Columbia, for joining the OBU. The UMW International persuaded a number of locals to return to the parent organization. The UMW then came to an agreement with employers which would effectively lock out the OBU. With One Big Union seen as the greater threat, employers agreed to require UMW membership on the part of all employees in and around the mines. The companies implemented the dues checkoff to seal the new agreement.

OBU members refused to work under circumstances where they were assessed dues for an organization to which they no longer belonged, and a number of mines organized by the OBU were therefore closed down. The OBU sought relief from the courts, but the courts sided with the United Mine Workers and the employers. The employers and the UMW then together secured injunctions against any OBU members to prevent any interference with UMW miners. The &quot;O.B.U. Bulletin&quot; for 23 October 1920 reported that the UMW had thirteen such injunctions issued, and had set aside a million dollars to fight the OBU. The Canadian OBU concluded that &quot;Officials of the U.M.W. of A. are the same bunch of crooks who have so often betrayed the miners of the U.S. in their struggles and strikes at the instance of their government and the owners.&quot; The OBU felt particularly angry that the UMW invoked the aid of both the employers and a &quot;ruthless capitalist government&quot; in order to crush a rival union organization.

==Criticism==
The One Big Union organizations adopted some principles of One Big Union as initially promoted by the IWW. The OBU idea became popular in Australia at a time when some syndicalist-leaning labour leaders had started moving toward communism.

Although the One Big Union organizations frequently formed with the help of IWW members or members of IWW offshoot-organizations such as the WIIU, the OBU organizations frequently incurred criticism from the original industrial union organizations. The IWW advocated organizing bottom-up, the OBU in Australia operated increasingly top-down. The IWW advocated job control, the Australian OBU did not. Shop committees and rank and file participation which had been so important to IWW members were de-emphasized. The OBU in Australia was described as &quot;the plum extracted from the IWW cake to keep down discontent among the dupes&quot;.

The &quot;Industrial Union News&quot; of the WIIU criticized the structure of the Canadian One Big Union organization, declaring &quot;the O.B.U. seeks to masquerade under the guise of industrial unionism while organized on a territorial plane, without sound foundations and building from the top down&quot;.
The &quot;Industrial Union News&quot; also criticized the Canadian OBU for not providing for elections of officials by the entire membership. The OBU was described as &quot;not red but pale pink&quot;, and in league with the &quot;reactionary Socialist Party of Canada&quot;.

The IWW publication &quot;Solidarity&quot; of 10 July 1920 stated that labour fakirs had seized control of the OBU, and had organized new branches of the OBU in the United States in opposition to the IWW.

Marian Dutton Savage, who published a book on industrial unionism in 1922, saw problems with the organizational structure of the Canadian OBU:
In neglecting to give adequate recognition to the ties binding workers of the same industry together and in seeking to rely instead on the general feeling of solidarity in the working class, the O. B. U., like the Knights of Labor, has failed to understand the psychology of those it has sought to win and hold. If it is difficult to make skilled and unskilled workers in the same industry realize their community of interest, it is doubly difficult to make those in different industries feel a strong bond of union. The I. W. W. has faced this fact and, unlike the O. B. U., seeks to unite all who work in an industry in one international union having a large measure of control over its own affairs. Although it preaches the brotherhood of all workers as ardently as does the O. B. U., it recognizes that each industry has its own particular problems which can best be solved by workers in that industry, and considers that loyalty to one industry need in no way impair loyalty to the I. W. W. or to the working class as a whole. If the O. B. U. had adopted the same course it would not have lost the strongest group which had affiliated with it.

<doc id="350700" wikidata="Q333111" url="?curid=350700" title="George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon">
<text>George Frederick Samuel Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon, (24 October 1827 – 9 July 1909), styled Viscount Goderich from 1833 to 1859 and known as the Earl of Ripon in 1859 and as the Earl de Grey and Ripon from 1859 to 1871, was a British politician and Viceroy and Governor General of India who served in every Liberal cabinet between 1861 and 1908.

==Background and education==
Ripon was born at 10 Downing Street, London, the second son of Prime Minister F. J. Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich (who was created Earl of Ripon in 1833), by his wife Lady Sarah (née Hobart), daughter of the Earl of Buckinghamshire. He was educated privately, attending neither school nor college.

He was awarded the honorary degree of DCL by the University of Oxford in 1870.

==Diplomatic and political career, 1852–1880==
Ripon served on his uncle Sir Henry Ellis&#x27; British special mission to the Brussels Conference on the affairs of Italy in 1848–49. Although his father had been a Tory, Ripon was first a Whig and later a Liberal. He entered the House of Commons as one of the two members for Hull in 1852. Both he and his party colleague James Clay were unseated in 1853 by petition over claims of widespread corruption in their election, of which they were exonerated of any knowledge. He was returned for Huddersfield later in 1853 and for the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1857.

In 1859 he succeeded his father as second Earl of Ripon, taking his seat in the House of Lords, and later that year succeeded his uncle in the more senior title of Earl de Grey, becoming known as the Earl de Grey and Ripon. He was Under-Secretary of State for War under Lord Palmerston between 1859 and 1861 and again from 1861 to 1863, and briefly Under-Secretary of State for India in 1861. In 1863 he was made a Privy Counsellor and Secretary of State for War under Palmerston, with a seat in the Cabinet. He retained this office when Lord Russell became prime minister on Palmerston&#x27;s death in 1865, and then served under Russell as Secretary of State for India between February and June 1866. In Gladstone&#x27;s first administration he was Lord President of the Council (1868–1873). During this period he acted as chairman of the joint commission for drawing up the Treaty of Washington with the United States over the Alabama Claims. For this, in 1871 he was created Marquess of Ripon, in the County of York. He had already been made a Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1869. In 1878 he served as President of the first day of the Co-operative Congress.

==Viceroy of India, 1880–1884==

When Gladstone returned to power in 1880 he appointed Ripon Viceroy of India, an office he held until 1884. During his time in India, Ripon introduced legislation (the Ilbert Bill, named for the legal member of the Viceroy&#x27;s Executive Council, Courtenay Ilbert) that would have granted Indians more legal rights, including the right of Indian judges to judge Europeans in court. Though progressive in its intent, the legislation was scuppered by Europeans living in India who did not want to be tried by a native judge. In this Ripon was supported by Florence Nightingale, who also backed his efforts to obtain a Bengal land tenancy bill (eventually the Bengal Tenancy Act 1885) that would improve the situation of the peasants. In 1882 he repealed the controversial Vernacular Press Act of 1878 passed by Lytton. He also promoted the Indian Famine Codes.
He was also instrumental in supporting Dietrich Brandis to reorganize the Madras Forest Department and expand systematic forest conservancy in India. In 1883, Lord Ripon joined a shooting party organised by the Maharaja of Darbhanga which had a total bag of 1683, including 4 tigers, 47 buffaloes, 280 pigs and 467 deer. (The remainder was ″small game″.) There was some criticism at ″... such wholesale destruction, particularly as it happens to be the breeding season.″

He is still remembered in Chennai (formerly Madras), India with a Tamil saying in rhyme &quot;Lord Ripon engal appan&quot; meaning: Lord Ripon, our father. The Corporation of Chennai&#x27;s Ripon Building was named for him, as well as the town of Riponpet in the Shivamogga district in the state of Karnataka. In Calcutta, Ripon Street was named for him. The Ghanta Ghar Multan or Clock Tower of Multan in Pakistan was named Ripon Building and the hall of the same building was named Ripon Hall. The Ripon Club in Mumbai (formerly Bombay) founded in 1884 by the Parsis for their community members, was named after him.

==Political career, 1884–1908==
Lord Ripon also became a supporter of Home Rule for Ireland. In Gladstone&#x27;s 1886 government he was First Lord of the Admiralty, and in the government of 1892 to 1895 he was Secretary of State for the Colonies. When the Liberals again returned to power in 1905 under Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, he took office, aged 78, as Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords. In 1908, he declined to remain as Lords leader when H. H. Asquith became Prime Minister in April, and he resigned as Lord Privy Seal in October.

As noted by Neil Smith, Ripon&#x27;s liberalism had roots in the mid-nineteenth century, but his political views &quot;shifted with the times&quot;. According to Smith, &quot;he was greatly interested in labour questions, deeply sympathetic to labour aspirations and believed the state might interfere with wages and that the state had a duty to deal with unemployment&quot;.

==Other appointments==

Lord Ripon was President of the Royal Geographical Society during 1859–1860, and Trustee of the National Gallery. Lord Ripon also held many positions in public life in Yorkshire. In 1860, he was appointed honorary Colonel of the 1st Volunteer Battalion of the Prince of Wales&#x27; Own (West Yorkshire) Regiment, and was later awarded the Volunteer Decoration (VD); in 1863, he was High Steward of the borough of Hull, and from 1873 to 1906 he was Lord Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire. He was a deputy lieutenant and JP for the counties of Lincolnshire and the West Riding of Yorkshire, JP for the Liberty of Ripon, and served as Mayor of Ripon in 1895–1896.

Lord Ripon was a Freemason, who served as Provincial Grand Master of the West Riding and Deputy Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of England from 1861 to 1869, and ultimately as Grand Master from 1870 until his conversion to Catholicism in 1874. His conversion to Catholicism was met by astonishment in the political world and accusations of disloyalty.

Following his conversion he was generous in supporting Catholic educational and charitable works. He was president of the Society of St Vincent de Paul from 1899 until his death and a great supporter of St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Missionary Society and St Wilfrid&#x27;s Church in Ripon. 

Lord Ripon was Chancellor of the University of Leeds from its creation in 1904 until his death in 1909.

==Marriage and children==
Lord Ripon married his cousin Henrietta Anne Theodosia Vyner, daughter of Henry Vyner and his wife Lady Mary Gertrude Robinson, daughter of Thomas Robinson, 2nd Earl de Grey, on 8 April 1851. They had one son and one daughter:

* Frederick Oliver Robinson, 2nd Marquess of Ripon (29 January 1852 – 22 September 1923)
* Hon. Mary Sarah Robinson (16 July 1857 – 3 July 1858), died in infancy

==Death==
Lady Ripon died in February 1907, aged 73. Lord Ripon survived her by two years and died of heart failure at Studley Royal Park in July 1909, aged 81. He was buried at St Mary&#x27;s, Studley Royal and was succeeded in the marquessate and other titles by his only son, Frederick Oliver. His estate was assessed for probate with a value of £127,292. 15s. 8d. (equivalent to £ million in ).

It uses encryption (&#x27;hiding&#x27;) only for its own control messages (using an optional pre-shared secret), and does not provide any encryption or confidentiality of content by itself. Rather, it provides a tunnel for Layer 2 (which may be encrypted), and the tunnel itself may be passed over a Layer 3 encryption protocol such as IPsec.

==History==
Published in August 1999 as proposed standard RFC 2661, L2TP has its origins primarily in two older tunneling protocols for point-to-point communication: Cisco&#x27;s Layer 2 Forwarding Protocol (L2F) and Microsoft&#x27;s
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP). A new version of this protocol, L2TPv3, appeared as proposed standard RFC 3931 in 2005. L2TPv3 provides additional security features, improved encapsulation, and the ability to carry data links other than simply Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) over an IP network (for example: Frame Relay, Ethernet, ATM, etc.).

==Description==
The entire L2TP packet, including payload and L2TP header, is sent within a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) datagram. A virtue of transmission over UDP (rather than TCP) is that it avoids the TCP meltdown problem. It is common to carry PPP sessions within an L2TP tunnel. L2TP does not provide confidentiality or strong authentication by itself. IPsec is often used to secure L2TP packets by providing confidentiality, authentication and integrity. The combination of these two protocols is generally known as L2TP/IPsec (discussed below).

The two endpoints of an L2TP tunnel are called the L2TP access concentrator (LAC) and the L2TP network server (LNS). The LNS waits for new tunnels. Once a tunnel is established, the network traffic between the peers is bidirectional. To be useful for networking, higher-level protocols are then run through the L2TP tunnel. To facilitate this, an L2TP &quot;session&quot; is established within the tunnel for each higher-level protocol such as PPP. Either the LAC or LNS may initiate sessions. The traffic for each session is isolated by L2TP, so it is possible to set up multiple virtual networks across a single tunnel.

The packets exchanged within an L2TP tunnel are categorized as either &quot;control packets&quot; or &quot;data packets&quot;. L2TP provides reliability features for the control packets, but no reliability for data packets. Reliability, if desired, must be provided by the nested protocols running within each session of the L2TP tunnel.

L2TP allows the creation of a virtual private dialup network (VPDN) to connect a remote client to its corporate network by using a shared infrastructure, which could be the Internet or a service provider&#x27;s network.

==Tunneling models==
An L2TP tunnel can extend across an entire PPP session or only across one segment of a two-segment session. This can be represented by four different tunneling models, namely:
*voluntary tunnel
*compulsory tunnel — incoming call
*compulsory tunnel — remote dial
*L2TP multihop connection

==L2TP packet structure==
An L2TP packet consists of :
Field meanings:
; Flags and version: control flags indicating data/control packet and presence of length, sequence, and offset fields.
; Length (optional): Total length of the message in bytes, present only when length flag is set.
; Tunnel ID: Indicates the identifier for the control connection.
; Session ID: Indicates the identifier for a session within a tunnel.
; Ns (optional): sequence number for this data or control message, beginning at zero and incrementing by one (modulo 216) for each message sent. Present only when sequence flag set.
; Nr (optional): sequence number for expected message to be received. Nr is set to the Ns of the last in-order message received plus one (modulo 216). In data messages, Nr is reserved and, if present (as indicated by the S bit), MUST be ignored upon receipt..
;Offset Size (optional): Specifies where payload data is located past the L2TP header. If the offset field is present, the L2TP header ends after the last byte of the offset padding. This field exists if the offset flag is set.
;Offset Pad (optional): Variable length, as specified by the offset size. Contents of this field are undefined.
;Payload data: Variable length (Max payload size = Max size of UDP packet − size of L2TP header)

==L2TP packet exchange==
At the time of setup of L2TP connection, many control packets are exchanged between server and client to establish tunnel and session for each direction. One peer requests the other peer to assign a specific tunnel and session id through these control packets. Then using this tunnel and session id, data packets are exchanged with the compressed PPP frames as payload.

The list of L2TP Control messages exchanged between LAC and LNS, for handshaking before establishing a tunnel and session in voluntary tunneling method are

==L2TP/IPsec==
Because of the lack of confidentiality inherent in the L2TP, it is often implemented along with IPsec. This is referred to as L2TP/IPsec, and is standardized in IETF RFC 3193. The process of setting up an L2TP/IPsec VPN is as follows:

#Negotiation of IPsec security association (SA), typically through &quot;Internet key exchange&quot; (IKE). This is carried out over UDP port 500, and commonly uses either a shared password (so-called &quot;pre-shared keys&quot;), public keys, or X.509 certificates on both ends, although other keying methods exist.
#Establishment of Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) communication in transport mode. The IP protocol number for ESP is 50 (compare TCP&#x27;s 6 and UDP&#x27;s 17). At this point, a secure channel has been established, but no tunneling is taking place.
#Negotiation and establishment of L2TP tunnel between the SA endpoints. The actual negotiation of parameters takes place over the SA&#x27;s secure channel, within the IPsec encryption. L2TP uses UDP port 1701.

When the process is complete, L2TP packets between the endpoints are encapsulated by IPsec. Since the L2TP packet itself is wrapped and hidden within the IPsec packet, the original source and destination IP address is encrypted within the packet. Also, it is not necessary to open UDP port 1701 on firewalls between the endpoints, since the inner packets are not acted upon until after IPsec data has been decrypted and stripped, which only takes place at the endpoints.

A potential point of confusion in L2TP/IPsec is the use of the terms tunnel and secure channel. The term tunnel-mode refers to a channel which allows untouched packets of one network to be transported over another network. In the case of L2TP/PPP, it allows L2TP/PPP packets to be transported over IP. A secure channel refers to a connection within which the confidentiality of all data is guaranteed. In L2TP/IPsec, first IPsec provides a secure channel, then L2TP provides a tunnel. IPsec also specifies a tunnel protocol: this is not used when a L2TP tunnel is used.

==Windows implementation==
Windows has had native support (configurable in control panel) for L2TP since Windows 2000. Windows Vista added 2 alternative tools, an MMC snap-in called &quot;Windows Firewall with Advanced Security&quot; (WFwAS) and the &quot;netsh advfirewall&quot; command-line tool. One limitation with both of the WFwAS and netsh commands is that servers must be specified by IP address. Windows 10 added the &quot;Add-VpnConnection&quot; and &quot;Set-VpnConnectionIPsecConfiguration&quot; PowerShell commands. A registry key must be created on the client and server if the server is behind a NAT-T device. 

==L2TP in ISPs&#x27; networks==
L2TP is often used by ISPs when internet service over for example ADSL or cable is being &quot;resold&quot;. From the end user, packets travel over a wholesale network service provider&#x27;s network to a server called a Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS), a protocol converter and router combined. On legacy networks the path from end user customer premises&#x27; equipment to the BRAS may be over an ATM network. 
From there on, over an IP network, an L2TP tunnel runs from the BRAS (acting as LAC) to an LNS which is an edge router at the boundary of the ultimate destination ISP&#x27;s IP network.

<doc id="350708" wikidata="Q646104" url="?curid=350708" title="MultiMediaCard">
<text>MultiMediaCard, officially abbreviated as MMC, is a memory card standard used for solid-state storage. Unveiled in 1997 by SanDisk and Siemens, MMC is based on a surface-contact low-pin-count serial interface using a single memory stack substrate assembly, and is therefore much smaller than earlier systems based on high-pin-count parallel interfaces using traditional surface-mount assembly such as CompactFlash. Both products were initially introduced using SanDisk NOR-based flash technology.

MMC is about the size of a postage stamp: 32 mm × 24 mm × 1.4 mm. MMC originally used a 1-bit serial interface, but newer versions of the specification allow transfers of 4 or 8 bits at a time. MMC can be used in many devices that can use Secure Digital (SD) cards. MMCs may be available in sizes up to 16 gigabytes (GB).

They are used in almost every context in which memory cards are used, like cellular phones, digital audio players, digital cameras, and PDAs. Typically, an MMC operates as a storage medium for devices, in a form that can easily be removed for access by a PC via a connected MMC reader.

eMMC (embedded MMC) is a small MMC chip used as embedded non-volatile memory that is normally soldered on printed circuit boards, though pluggable eMMC modules are used on some devices (e.g. Orange Pi and ODROID).

== History ==
The latest version of the eMMC standard (JESD84-B51) by JEDEC is version 5.1A, released January 2019, with speeds (250 MB/s read, 125 MB/s write) rivaling discrete SATA-based SSDs (500 MB/s).
As of 23 September 2008, the MultimediaCard Association (MMCA) turned over all MMC specifications to the JEDEC organization including embedded MMC (eMMC), SecureMMC, and miCARD assets. JEDEC is an organization devoted to standards for the solid-state industry.

The latest eMMC specifications can be requested from JEDEC, free-of-charge for JEDEC members. Older versions of the standard are freely available, but some optional enhancements to the standard such as MiCard and SecureMMC specifications, must be purchased separately. 

While there is no royalty charged for devices to host an MMC or eMMC, a royalty may be necessary in order to manufacture the cards themselves.

A highly detailed datasheet that contains essential information for writing an MMC host driver is available online.

== Variants ==

=== RS-MMC ===

In 2004, the Reduced-Size MultiMediaCard (RS-MMC) was introduced as a smaller form factor of the MMC, with about half the size: 24 mm × 18 mm × 1.4 mm. The RS-MMC uses a simple mechanical adapter to elongate the card so it can be used in any MMC (or SD) slot. RS-MMCs are currently available in sizes up to and including 2 GB.

The modern continuation of an RS-MMC is commonly known as MiniDrive (MD-MMC). A MiniDrive is generally a microSD card adapter in the RS-MMC form factor. This allows a user to take advantage of the wider range of modern MMCs available to exceed the historic 2 GB limitations of older chip technology.

Implementations of RS-MMCs include Nokia and Siemens, who used RS-MMC in their Series 60 Symbian smartphones, the Nokia 770 Internet Tablet, and generations 65 and 75 (Siemens). However, since 2006, all of Nokia&#x27;s new devices with card slots have used miniSD or microSD cards, with the company dropping support for the MMC standard in its products. While Siemens exited the mobile phone business completely in 2006, the company continues to use MMC for some PLC storage leveraging MD-MMC advances.

=== DV-MMC ===

The Dual-Voltage MultimediaCard (DV-MMC) was one of the first changes in MMC. These cards can operate at 1.8 V in addition to 3.3 V. Running at lower voltages reduces the card&#x27;s energy consumption, which is important in mobile devices. However, simple dual-voltage parts quickly went out of production in favor of MMCplus and MMCmobile, which offer capabilities in addition to dual-voltage capability.

=== MMCplus and MMCmobile ===
The version 4.x of the MMC standard, introduced in 2005, introduced two significant changes to compete against SD cards: (1) the ability to run at higher speeds (26 MHz and 52 MHz) than the original MMC (20 MHz) or SD (25 MHz, 50 MHz), and (2) a four- or eight-bit-wide data bus.

Version 4.x full-size cards and reduced-size cards can be marketed as MMCplus and MMCmobile, respectively.

Version 4.x cards are fully backward compatible with existing readers but require updated hardware and software to use their new capabilities. Even though the four-bit-wide bus and high-speed modes of operation are deliberately electrically compatible with SD, the initialization protocol is different, so firmware and software updates are required to use these features in an SD reader.

=== MMCmicro ===
MMCmicro is a smaller version of MMC. With dimensions of 14 mm × 12 mm × 1.1 mm, it is smaller and thinner than RS-MMC. Like MMCmobile, MMCmicro allows dual voltage, is backward compatible with MMC, and can be used in full-size MMC and SD slots with a mechanical adapter. MMCmicro cards have the high-speed and four-bit-bus features of the 4.x spec, but not the eight-bit bus, due to the absence of the extra pins.

This variant was formerly known as &quot;S-card&quot; when introduced by Samsung on 13 December 2004. It was later adapted and introduced in 2005 by the MultiMediaCard Association (MMCA) as the third form factor memory card in the &quot;MultiMediaCard&quot; family.

MMCmicro appears very similar to microSD, but the two formats are not physically compatible and have incompatible pinouts.

=== MiCard ===

The MiCard is a backward-compatible extension of the MMC standard with a theoretical maximum size of 2048 GB (2 terabytes) announced on 2 June 2007. The card is composed of two detachable parts, much like a microSD card with an SD adapter. The small memory card fits directly in a USB port and has MMC-compatible electrical contacts. With an included electromechanical adapter, it can also fit in traditional MMC and SD card readers. To date, only one manufacturer (Pretec) has produced cards in this format.

The MiCard was developed by the Industrial Technology Research Institute in Taiwan. At the time of the announcement, twelve Taiwanese companies (including ADATA Technology, Asustek, BenQ, Carry Computer Eng. Co., C-One Technology, DBTel, Power Digital Card Co., and RiCHIP) had signed on to manufacture the new memory card. However, as of June 2011, none of the listed companies had released any such cards, nor had any further announcements been made about plans for the format.

The card was announced to be available starting in the third quarter of 2007. It was expected to save the 12 Taiwanese companies who planned to manufacture the product and related hardware up to US$40 million in licensing fees, which presumably would otherwise be paid to owners of competing flash memory formats. The initial card was to have a capacity of 8 GB, while the standard would allow sizes up to 2048 GB. It was stated to have data transfer speeds of 480 Mbit/s (60 Mbyte/s), with plans to increase data over time.

=== eMMC ===
The currently implemented embedded MMC (eMMC or ) architecture puts the MMC components (flash memory, buffer and controller) into a small ball grid array (BGA) IC package for use in circuit boards as an embedded non-volatile memory system. This is noticeably different from other versions of MMC as this is not a user-removable card, but rather a permanent attachment to the printed circuit board (PCB). Therefore, in the event of an issue with either the memory or its controller, the eMMC would need to be replaced or repaired. In eMMC, the host system simply reads and writes data to and from the logical block addresses. The eMMC controller hardware and firmware lifts the burden on the host system by performing error correction and data management. eMMC exists in 100, 153, and 169 ball packages and is based on an 8-bit parallel interface.

Almost all mobile phones and tablets used this form of flash for main storage until 2016, when Universal Flash Storage (UFS) started to take control of the market. However, as of 2023, eMMC is still used in many consumer applications, including lower-end smartphones, such that Kioxia has introduced new 64 GB and 128 GB eMMC 5.1 modules based on modern 3D NAND flash scheduled for mass production in 2024. 

eMMC does not support the SPI-bus protocol and uses NAND flash.

== Uses ==

Modern computers, both laptops and desktops, often have SD slots, which can additionally read MMCs if the operating system drivers can. Since the introduction of SD cards, few companies build MMC slots into their devices (an exception is some mobile devices like the Nokia 9300 communicator in 2004, where the smaller size of the MMC is a benefit), but the slightly thinner, pin-compatible MMCs can be used in almost any device that can use SD cards if the software/firmware on the device is capable.

While few companies build MMC slots into devices , due to SD cards dominating the memory card market, the embedded MMC () is still widely used in consumer electronics as a primary means of integrated storage and boot loader in portable devices. eMMC provides a low-cost flash-memory system with a built-in controller that can reside inside an Android or Windows phone or in a low-cost PC and can appear to its host as a bootable device, in lieu of a more expensive form of solid-state storage, such as a traditional solid-state drive.

== Similar formats ==

In 2004, a group of companies—including Seagate and Hitachi—introduced an interface called CE-ATA for small form factor hard disk drives. This interface was electrically and physically compatible with the MMC specification. However, support for further development of the standard ended in 2008.

The game card format used on the PlayStation Vita was found to be based on the MMC standard, but with a different pinout and support for custom initialization commands as well as copy protection.

<doc id="350709" wikidata="Q493798" url="?curid=350709" title="SS Andrea Doria">
<text>SS &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; () is a luxury transatlantic ocean liner of the Italian Line (Società di navigazione Italia), put into service in 1953. She is widely known from the extensive media coverage of her sinking in 1956, which included the remarkably successful rescue of 1,660 of her 1,706 passengers and crew.

Named after the 16th-century Genoese admiral Andrea Doria, the ship had a gross register tonnage of 29,100 and a capacity of about 1,200 passengers and 500 crew. Of all Italy&#x27;s ships at the time, &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; was the largest, fastest and supposedly safest. Launched on 16 June 1951, she was home-ported in Genoa, and began her maiden voyage on 14 January 1953.

On 25 July 1956, the New York City–bound vessel was approaching the coast of Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States. It was thick fog and when SS Andrea Doria finally noticed the eastbound passenger liner of the Swedish American Line, they were already too close to each other and on a collision course. Struck on her starboard side, the top-heavy &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; immediately started to list severely and take on water, which left half of her lifeboats unusable. The consequent shortage of lifeboats could have resulted in significant loss of life, but the ship stayed afloat for over 11 hours after the collision. The calm, appropriate behavior of the crew, together with improvements in communications, and the rapid response of other ships, averted a disaster similar in scale to that of in 1912. While 1,660 passengers and crew were rescued and survived, 46 people on the ship died as a direct consequence of the collision. The evacuated luxury liner capsized and sank the following morning. This accident remains the worst maritime disaster to occur in United States waters since the capsizing of the in Chicago in 1915.

While the rescue efforts for both ships were successful, the cause of the collision, culpability, and the loss of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; generated much continued interest in the media and many lawsuits.

No determination of cause was ever formally published largely due to a confidential out-of-court settlement agreement between the two shipping companies signed during hearings immediately after the disaster. However, M/S Stockholm&#x27;s commander, Captain Gunnar Nordenson, was absolved of all guilt because Andrea Doria&#x27;s captain Piero Calamai gave the order to turn to port at the meeting, when according to standard he should have turned to starboard.

==History==
===Features===
Designed by Italian architect Giulio Minoletti, &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; had a length of , a beam of , and a gross register tonnage of 29,100. The propulsion system consisted of steam turbines attached to twin screws, enabling the ship to achieve a service speed of , with a top speed of . She was neither the largest vessel nor the fastest of her day – those distinctions went to the 83,673 GRT and ; instead, her forte was luxury.

When fully booked, the ship was capable of accommodating 1,241 passengers; 218 in first class, 320 in cabin class, and 703 in tourist class. As was the rule aboard transatlantic passenger liners, each passenger class was strictly segregated to specific parts of the ship. First class accommodations were located amidships on the upper decks, cabin class accommodations were located just abaft of first class, and tourist class accommodations were divided between the forward and aft ends and were connected by corridors that ran the full length of the ship. Each class had its own separate dining room, lounges, and social halls, designated areas of open deck space and enclosed promenades, and even their own outdoor swimming pools with verandas. A crew of 563 was aboard. Over $1 million was spent on artwork and the decor of the cabins and public rooms, including a life-sized statue of Admiral Doria.

===Safety and seaworthiness===
&quot;Andrea Doria&quot; was built with a double hull divided into 11 watertight compartments. Any two of these could be filled with water without endangering the ship&#x27;s safety. She was equipped with the latest early-warning radar, and carried sixteen steel lifeboats, eight on each side, enough by regulation to accommodate all passengers and crew. These came in three designs; two 58-person launches for emergency use, two 70-person motorboats with inboard radio transmitters, and 12 146-person hand-propelled rowboats.

However, despite its technological advantages, the ship had serious flaws relating to its seaworthiness and safety. Model testing during the design phase predicted she would develop a huge list when hit by any significant force. This was proven during her maiden voyage, when the vessel listed 28° after being hit by a large rogue wave off Nantucket. Her tendency to list was aggravated when her fuel tanks were nearly empty, which was usually at the end of a voyage.

This stability issue became a focus of the investigation after the sinking, as it was a factor in both the capsizing and the crew&#x27;s inability to lower the port-side lifeboats. The bulkheads of the watertight compartments extended only up to the top of A Deck, and a list greater than 20° allowed water from a flooded watertight compartment to pass over its top into adjacent compartments. In addition, the design parameters allowed the lowering of the lifeboats at a maximum 15° list. Beyond this limit, up to half of the lifeboats could not be deployed.

===Construction===
At the end of World War II, Italy was struggling with a collapsed economy. It had lost half its merchant fleet through wartime destruction and reparations awarded to various Allied forces. The losses included the bombing and sinking of , a former Blue Riband holder for her record transatlantic crossing. To show the world that the country had recovered from the war, and to reestablish the nation&#x27;s pride, the Italian Line commissioned two new vessels of similar design in the early 1950s. The first was to be named &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;, after a famed 16th-century Genoese admiral Andrea Doria, the second after explorer Christopher Columbus.

These ships were intended to deliver express service on the Italian Line&#x27;s &quot;Sunny Southern Route&quot; between Genoa and New York, stopping only at Cannes, Naples and Gibraltar. Three slower prewar vessels, &quot;Saturnia&quot;, &quot;Vulcania&quot; and &quot;Conte Biancamano&quot;, among the handful of dowagers to survive the conflict, would follow a meandering route that included additional stops at Azores, Lisbon, Barcelona and Palermo.

Construction of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; started as Yard No. 918 at Ansaldo Shipyard in Genoa. On 9 February 1950, the ship&#x27;s keel was laid on the No. 1 slipway, and on 16 June 1951, &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; was launched. During the ceremony, the ship&#x27;s hull was blessed by Giuseppe Siri, Cardinal Archbishop of Genoa, and christened by Mrs. Giuseppina Saragat, wife of the former Minister of the Merchant Marine Giuseppe Saragat.

===Maiden voyage===
Initially, &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; had been scheduled to depart Genoa on her maiden voyage on 14 December 1952, but amid reports of machinery problems during sea trials, the departure was delayed to 14 January 1953. Following the Italian Line&#x27;s advertised route, she collected 794 passengers (152 First Class, 157 Cabin Class, 485 Tourist Class) before heading into the open Atlantic for New York. During the voyage she encountered heavy storms on the final approach to New York, listing a full 28° after being hit by a particularly large wave. She arrived on 23 January and received a welcoming delegation that included New York Mayor Vincent R. Impellitteri.

==Final voyage==
===Outbound===

The 51st westbound crossing of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; to New York began as a typical run on the North Atlantic. Her most recent eastbound crossing from New York had concluded on 14 July 1956, and after a three-day turnaround, she was scheduled to be outbound from Genoa on Tuesday, 17 July. On this run, she was booked to roughly 90% of her total passenger capacity, with 1,134 passengers travelling aboard: 190 in first class, 267 in cabin class and 677 in tourist class. Combined with a crew of 572, a total of 1,706 persons would sail aboard her to the U.S..

On the morning of 17 July, &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; began to take on her first passengers at 8 a.m. A total of 277 embarked there: 49 first class, 72 cabin class and 156 tourist class. Among those traveling in first class were Hungarian ballet dancers Istvan Rabovsky and Nora Kovach, who had defected from the Soviet bloc to the United States just three years earlier. The ship departed at 11 a.m. on the first leg of her journey.

She arrived at Cannes on the French Riviera mid-afternoon that same day. An additional 48 passengers boarded there: 30 first class, 15 cabin class, and 3 tourist class. Among them was a Hollywood actress who would become one of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;″s most famous passengers, Ruth Roman, travelling with her three-year-old son Richard. The famous songwriter Mike Stoller was aboard as well. From Cannes &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; sailed southeast to Naples, arriving the following morning. A total of 744 came aboard there: 85 in first class, 161 in cabin class, and 498 in tourist class. Most of the latter were emigrants from impoverished regions of southern Italy on their way to new lives in America. She departed just after 6 p.m., arriving two days later off Gibraltar. A total of 65 passengers boarded: 26 first class, 19 cabin class, 20 tourist class, before she set out for New York.

On Wednesday, 25 July, just before noon, the passenger liner &quot;Stockholm&quot; of the Swedish American Line departed New York Harbor on her 103rd eastbound crossing across the Atlantic, headed to her home port of Gothenburg, Sweden. At 12,165 tons and in length, roughly half the size of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;, &quot;Stockholm&quot; was the smallest passenger liner on the North Atlantic run during the 1950s. Completed in 1948, she was of a much more practical design than &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;. Originally built to accommodate only 395 passengers in two classes, &quot;Stockholm&quot; was designed without the opulence of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; because the Swedish-American Line was aware that the rapid growth of air travel would bring an end soon to the age of transatlantic passenger travel. However, they did not envision the massive surge in tourism fueled by the buoyant American economy that arose during the 1950s. As a result, the Swedish-American Line withdrew &quot;Stockholm&quot; from service in 1953 for an overhaul that included an addition to her superstructure to provide accommodations for an additional 153 passengers, increasing her capacity to 548. This proved successful, as by 1956 &quot;Stockholm&quot; had gained a worthy reputation on the North Atlantic. 

&quot;Stockholm&quot; left New York booked almost to capacity, with 534 passengers and a crew of 208. She was commanded by Captain Harry Gunnar Nordenson, though Third Officer Johan-Ernst Carstens-Johannsen was on duty on the bridge at the time of the accident. This was his first time alone on the bridge of a ship, and he had been up since 06:00 that morning supervising baggage-loading and passenger-boarding in New York.

===Collision course===
To save time, the &quot;Stockholm&quot; set a homeward course south of the Nantucket Lightship and twenty miles north of the recommended eastbound course for ships leaving the United States, placing the &quot;Stockholm&quot; directly in the path of inbound westward traffic, a violation of the 1953 North Atlantic Track Agreement to which the Swedish American Line was a signatory. Cruising under clear skies, the &quot;Stockholm&#x27;s&quot; speed was approximately in visibility Carstens-Johannsen estimated to be .

The waters of the North Atlantic south of Nantucket Island are frequently the site of intermittent fog, as the cold Labrador Current encounters the Gulf Stream. As &quot;Stockholm&quot; and &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; were approaching each other head-on in the heavily used shipping corridor, the westbound Italian liner had been traveling in a heavy bank for hours. The captain had reduced speed slightly from , activated the ship&#x27;s fog-warning whistle, and had closed the watertight doors, all customary precautions while sailing in such conditions. However, the eastbound &quot;Stockholm&quot; had yet to enter the bank&#x27;s western edge, and was seemingly unaware either of it or &quot;Andrea Doria&#x27;s&quot; movement within it.

As the two ships approached each other in failing light at a combined speed of , each was aware of the presence of another ship only through radar. Compounding this, they apparently misinterpreted each other&#x27;s course, and made no initial radio communication.

The original inquiry established that in the critical minutes before the collision, &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; gradually steered south, to her left, attempting a starboard-to-starboard passing, while &quot;Stockholm&quot; also turned about 20° southward, to its right, an action intended to widen the clearance of a port-to-port passing, but instead put the two vessels on a direct collision course. As a result of the extremely thick fog that enveloped &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; as the ships approached each other, the two were quite close by the time visual contact was established. By then, the crews realized that they were headed straight into one-another; in spite of their last-minute evasion maneuvers they could not avoid the ramming.

In the last moments before impact, &quot;Stockholm&quot; turned hard to starboard (right) and was in the process of reversing her propellers, attempting to stop. &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;, remaining at her cruising speed of almost engaged in a hard turn to port (left), her captain hoping to outrun the collision. Around 11:10 p.m., the two ships collided, &quot;Stockholm&quot; T-boning the starboard side of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;.

===Impact and penetration===
&quot;Andrea Doria&quot; and &quot;Stockholm&quot; collided at almost a 90° angle. &quot;Stockholm&quot;″s bow, heavily reinforced for operations in the icy North Atlantic, pierced &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;″s starboard side about one-third of her length from the bow, under the ship&#x27;s bridge. It penetrated the hull to a depth of nearly , and the keel. Below the waterline, five fuel tanks on &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;″s starboard side were torn open, and they filled with thousands of tons of seawater. Meanwhile, air was trapped in the five empty tanks on the port side, causing them to float more readily, contributing to a severe list.

&quot;Andrea Doria&quot; was designed with her hull divided into 11 watertight compartments, separated by steel bulkheads that ran across the width of her hull, rising from the bottom of the ship&#x27;s hull up to A Deck. The only openings in the bulkheads were on the bottom deck, where watertight doors were installed for use by the engine crew and could be easily closed in an emergency. Her design specified that if any two adjacent watertight compartments were breached, she could remain afloat. In addition, following the rules and guidelines set by the International Conference for Safety of Life at Sea of 1948, &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; was designed to handle a list, even under the worst imaginable circumstances, but not one greater than 15°. However, the combination of the five flooded tanks on one side and the five empty tanks on the other left her with a list that, within a few minutes of the collision, exceeded 20°. While the collision itself penetrated only one of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;″s watertight compartments, the severe list would gradually pull the tops of the bulkheads along the starboard side below the level of the water, allowing seawater to flow down corridors, down stairwells, and any other way it could find into the next compartment in line. The collision had also torn into an access tunnel running from the generator room, which was located in the compartment directly aft of where the collision had happened, to a small room at the forward end of the tank compartment containing the controls for the tank pumps. But a fatal flaw in &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;″s design existed, as at the point where the tunnel went through the bulkhead separating the two compartments, no watertight door was present. This allowed the generator room to flood rapidly, contributing to not only an increase in flooding, but a loss of electricity.

&quot;Andrea Doria&quot; sent this SOS call: SOS DE ICEH [this is &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;] SOS HERE AT 0320 GMT LAT. 40.30 N 69.53 W NEED IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE

It was only through the initial radio distress calls sent out by each ship that they learned one-another&#x27;s identity. Soon afterward, the messages were received by numerous radio and Coast Guard stations along the New England coast, and the world soon became aware that two large ocean liners had collided.

===Assessing damage and imminent danger===
Immediately after the collision, &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; began to take on water and started to list severely to starboard. Within minutes, the list was at least 18°. After the ships separated, Captain Calamai quickly brought the engine controls to &quot;all stop&quot;. One of the watertight doors to the engine room may have been missing, though this issue was later determined to be moot. Much more importantly, however, crucial stability was lost by the earlier failure during routine operations to ballast the mostly empty fuel tanks with seawater as they were emptied, as the builders had specified (which, however, makes refueling more costly). Owing to the immediate rush of seawater flooding the starboard tanks, and because the port tanks had emptied during the crossing, the list was greater than would otherwise have been the case.

In the engine room, engineers attempted to pump water out of the flooding starboard tanks, but to no avail. Only a small amount of fuel remained, and the intakes to pump seawater into the port tanks were now high out of the water, making any attempt to level the ship futile. As the list increased over the next few minutes to 20° or more, Calamai realized that his ship was doomed.

Aboard &quot;Stockholm&quot;, roughly of her bow had been crushed and torn away. Initially, the ship was dangerously down by the bow, but emptying the freshwater tanks soon raised the bow to within of normal. A quick survey determined that the major damage did not extend aft beyond the bulkhead between the first and second watertight compartments. In spite of her condition, the ship was soon determined to be stable and in no imminent danger of sinking.

===Rescue operations===
On &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;, the decision to abandon ship was made within 30 minutes of impact. A sufficient number of lifeboats for all of the passengers and crew was split evenly on each side of the Boat Deck. Procedures called for lowering the lifeboats until they could be secured alongside the glass-enclosed Promenade Deck one level below, allowing evacuees to climb out of windows directly into the boats. However, it was soon determined that the port side lifeboats were unlaunchable due to the severe list, which left them high in the air: lowering them would cause them to collide with the exposed hull, and cause them to tip. Compounding things, the list also complicated normal lifeboat procedures on the starboard side, making it necessary to lower the boats empty and somehow get evacuees to board them at water level. This was eventually accomplished through ropes and Jacob&#x27;s ladders. In fear of causing a panic and stampeding of the starboard lifeboats, Captain Calamai decided against giving the order to abandon ship until help arrived. In the meantime, Second Officer Guido Badano made announcements over the loudspeaker system instructing passengers to put on their lifebelts and go to their designated muster stations.

&quot;Andrea Doria&quot;″s radios had limited range, so her distress message making it clear that additional lifeboats were urgently needed was relayed to other ships that could receive it. The United States Coast Guard from New York City also coordinated on land.

In this case being in a busy shipping lane proved helpful to &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;. The first ship to respond to her distress call was the freighter &quot;Cape Ann&quot; of the United Fruit Company, which was returning to the United States after a trip to Bremerhaven, Germany. Upon receiving the message from the stricken &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;, Captain Joseph Boyd immediately set a course for her. With a crew of 44 aboard and only two 40-person lifeboats, the assistance &quot;Cape Ann&quot; could offer was limited, but within minutes, she was joined by other ships heeding the distress call. The US Navy transport , en route to New York from Livorno, Italy, with 214 troops and dependents also responded to the signal and made immediate progress towards the site. Her captain, John Shea, was placed in charge of the rescue operation by the US Navy and readily ordered his crew to prepare their eight usable lifeboats. Also joining the rescue was the US Navy destroyer escort .

 east of the collision site, the French Line&#x27;s was eastbound from New York en route to her home port of Le Havre, with 940 passengers and a crew of 826 aboard. At 44,500 tons and in length, the 30-year-old luxury liner was among the largest and fastest passenger liners on the North Atlantic run. On that voyage, having left New York the same day as &quot;Stockholm&quot;, she was under the command of Captain Raoul de Beaudéan, a well-respected veteran of the seas who had served the French Line for 35 years. Upon hearing of the collision and the distress call, de Beaudéan was at first skeptical of the thought of a modern ship like &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; actually foundering, and knew that if he did steer back to the collision site only to find that &quot;Île de France&quot; was not needed, it would mean having to return to New York to refuel and delay her passengers, which could have been a financial blow to the French Line. At the least he needed to contact the &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; to size up the situation. His attempt was unsuccessful, but after communicating with &quot;Stockholm&quot;, &quot;Cape Ann&quot;, and &quot;Thomas&quot;, he grasped that the lives of over 1,600 people were at risk, turned &quot;Île de France&quot; around, and set a direct course for the &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;.

Indeed, help was direly needed, as in spite of the efforts made aboard &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; to launch her starboard lifeboats many left only partially loaded, carrying in all only 200 panicked crewmen and very few passengers.

While other ships nearby were en route, Captain Nordenson of &quot;Stockholm&quot; determined that his ship was not in any imminent danger of sinking, and, after assuring his mostly sleeping passengers of their safety, sent some of his lifeboats to aid in the rescue. In the first hours many survivors transported by lifeboats from both ships were taken aboard &quot;Stockholm.&quot;

As he approached the accident scene less than three hours after the collision, Captain de Beaudéan of the &quot;Île de France&quot; became concerned about navigating his huge ship safely among the two damaged liners, other responding vessels, lifeboats, and possibly even people in the water. Then, just as she arrived, the fog lifted, and he was able to position his ship in such a way that the starboard side of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; was somewhat sheltered from wind and waves. He ordered all exterior lights of &quot;Île de France&quot; to be turned on. The sight of the illuminated &quot;Île de France&quot; was a great emotional relief to everyone involved.

&quot;Île de France&quot; managed to rescue the bulk of the remaining passengers by shuttling its 10 lifeboats back and forth to &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;, receiving lifeboat loads from those of the other ships already at the scene, and any of &quot;Andrea Doria&#x27;s&quot; starboard boats left. Some passengers on &quot;Île de France&quot; gave up their cabins to grateful survivors. Many other acts of kindness were reported.

In all, 1,663 passengers and crew had been rescued from &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;. The badly damaged &quot;Stockholm&quot;, through the use of both her own lifeboats and those from the stricken &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;, took on a total of 545 survivors, of whom 234 were crew members from &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; who had left the vessel ahead of the passengers; 129 survivors had been rescued by &quot;Cape Ann&quot;, 159 by &quot;Pvt. William H. Thomas&quot;, 77 by &quot;Edward H. Allen&quot;, including Captain Calamai and his officers. One American sailor, who slept through the entire collision and evacuation, was rescued from the abandoned, sinking liner by the tanker &quot;Robert E. Hopkins&quot;. &quot;Île de France&quot; played the largest role in the rescue, taking on 753 survivors.

Shortly after daybreak, a four-year-old Italian girl with head trauma and four seriously injured &quot;Stockholm&quot; crewmen were airlifted from that ship at the scene by helicopters sent by the Coast Guard and U.S. Air Force. A number of passengers and some crew from both vessels were hospitalized upon arrival in New York.

===&quot;Andrea Doria&quot; capsizes and sinks===

Once the evacuation was complete, Captain Calamai of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; shifted his attention to the possibility of towing the ship to shallow water. However, it was clear that it was doomed.

After all the survivors had been transferred onto various rescue ships bound for New York, &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;&#x27;s remaining crew began to disembark – forced to abandon the ship. By 6:00 am, even Captain Calamai was in a rescue boat. The sinking began at 9:45 am and by 10:00 that morning the Andrea Doria&#x27;s starboard side dipped into the ocean and the three swimming pools were seen refilling with water. As the bow slid under, the stern rose slightly, and the port propeller and shaft became visible. As the port side slipped below the waves, some of the unused lifeboats snapped free of their davits and floated upside-down in a row. It was recorded that &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; finally sank bow first 10 hours after the collision, at 10:09 am on 26 July 1956. The ship had drifted from the point of the collision. Aerial photography of the stricken ocean liner capsizing and sinking won a Pulitzer Prize in 1957 for Harry A. Trask of the &quot;Boston Traveler&quot; newspaper.

===Return to New York; families===
Because of the scattering of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; passengers and crew among the various rescue vessels, some families were separated during the collision and rescue. It was not clear who was where, and just who had survived, until after all the ships with survivors arrived in New York. In all, six different ships participated in the rescue of the passengers and crew of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;, including the heavily damaged &quot;Stockholm&quot;, which steamed back to New York under its own power with a United States Coast Guard escort after the others.

During the wait, New York City–based ABC Radio Network news commentator Edward P. Morgan broadcast a stirring account of the collision, not telling listeners that his 14-year-old daughter Linda Morgan had been aboard &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; and was feared dead. It was later revealed that she had been thrown from her bed when the two ships collided only to land on &quot;Stockholm&quot;&#x27;s deck, suffering moderate but not life-threatening injuries and earning the epithet &quot;miracle girl&quot;. The following night, after learning the good news, Edward P. Morgan&#x27;s emotional broadcast became one of the more memorable in radio news history.

Among &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;″s passengers were Hollywood actress Ruth Roman and her three-year-old son, Richard. In the 1950 film &quot;Three Secrets&quot;, Roman had portrayed a distraught mother waiting to learn whether or not her child had survived a plane crash. She and her son were separated from each other during the collision and evacuation. Rescued, Roman had to wait to learn her child&#x27;s fate, which resulted in a media frenzy for photos as she waited at the pier in New York City for her child&#x27;s safe arrival aboard one of the rescue ships. Actress Betsy Drake, who was married to movie star Cary Grant at the time, also escaped from the sinking liner, as did Philadelphia mayor Richardson Dilworth and songwriter Mike Stoller (of the team Leiber and Stoller).

Assisted by the American Red Cross and news photographers, the frantic parents of four-year-old Norma Di Sandro learned that their injured daughter had been airlifted from &quot;Stockholm&quot; to a hospital in Boston, where the previously unidentified little girl had undergone surgery for a fractured skull. They drove all night from New York to Boston, with police escorts provided to their convoy in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. When they arrived, the child was still unconscious and the doctors said all that could be done was wait to see if she woke up. The little girl never regained consciousness, and succumbed to her injuries.

Other families also had their hopes of seeing loved ones again dashed, especially those who were meeting members of several young families immigrating to the United States in hope of new lives.

The pier in New York where &quot;Stockholm&quot; was heading was packed with newsreel photographers and television crews. All the major department stores and shoe stores had booths set up to give the arriving survivors clothing and shoes. Not many of the newspeople spoke Italian, so confusion occurred when the survivors were asked to take off the clothing they were just given, to be photographed putting the clothes on. But after just a few minutes, everyone was clothed and had shoes to wear.

The sinking produced a footnote in automotive history, as it resulted in the loss of the Chrysler Norseman, an advanced &quot;one-off&quot; prototype car that had been built for Chrysler by Ghia in Italy. The Norseman had been announced as a major attraction of the 1957 auto show circuit. However, it had not been shown to the public prior to the disaster, and was lost, along with other cars in &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;″s 50-car garage.

===Casualties===
A total of 51 lives were lost in the collision and sinking, consisting of 46 passengers from the &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; and five members of the crew of the &quot;Stockholm&quot;. Of the 46 passengers lost aboard the &quot;Doria&quot;, 43 died as a result of the collision. No remains were ever recovered of these casualties, and they are believed to remain entombed within the wreck.

The area of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;″s hull where &quot;Stockholm&quot;″s bow penetrated encompassed five passenger decks. On the uppermost of these decks, the Upper Deck, at least eight first-class cabins were destroyed. In all, six first-class passengers lost their lives. In cabin 46, Colonel Walter Carlin had been in the bathroom brushing his teeth at the time of the collision and miraculously survived, while his wife Jeanette was killed. Later aboard &quot;Stockholm&quot;, crewmen searching the wreckage of the mangled bow sighted the remains of a woman matching Mrs. Carlin&#x27;s description lodged in the wreckage, but before they could recover it, debris became dislodged and the body fell into the sea. In direct line of &quot;Stockholm&quot;″s bow on the upper deck were cabins 52 and 54, which were occupied by Camille Cianfarra, a longtime foreign correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, his wife Jane, their 8-year-old daughter Joan and 14-year-old Linda Morgan, Jane&#x27;s daughter from her previous marriage to American journalist Edward P. Morgan. Joan was killed instantly, while Camille died from severe injuries moments after the collision. Jane was seriously injured, but was rescued by some other passengers, among them Dr. Thure Peterson, who had been next door in cabin 56. He sustained only minor injuries, while his wife Martha was gravely wounded and was trapped along with Jane Cianfarra. After a long struggle to free her, largely on the part of her husband, Martha succumbed to her injuries a few hours after the collision. One deck below on the Foyer Deck, near the first-class entrance, Ferdinand Melly Thieriot, circulation director of &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, along with his wife Frances (whose grandson is the actor Max Thieriot) were killed, as their suite was in direct line of &quot;Stockholm&quot;″s bow. Their 13-year-old son Peter, who occupied a cabin further down the corridor, survived.

On the decks below, titled A, B and C Decks, the loss of life was greater, as it was the location of several sections of tourist-class cabins. On A Deck, eleven passengers, consisting of ten women and one elderly clergyman, were all killed. In Cabin 230, three women, Margaret Carola, Christina Covino and Amelia Iazzetta, were killed instantly. Carola had been on board with her elderly mother Rosa Carola, who had also been assigned a berth in the cabin but because she suffered from a variety of health problems, she had been in the ship&#x27;s infirmary at the time of the collision and survived. Covino and Iazzetta were both sisters from New York who were returning from a visit to Italy. They were accompanied by Iazzetta&#x27;s husband Benvenuto, who had been berthed in another cabin and survived.

In the next cabin forward, Cabin 228, four more women lost their lives. Among them was Laura Bremermann, a young mother of two who was returning home to Fort Worth, Texas after visiting her native Italy. Two days before the disaster Bremermann sent a telegram to her husband Floyd asking him to meet her in New York. When he arrived to find her missing he inquired with the Italian line, who initially reported she was not on the passenger list, which Bremermann refuted using the telegram from his wife as proof. On B Deck, &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;″s 50-car garage was staved in by the bow of &quot;Stockholm&quot;, but on C Deck, the worst loss of life occurred. A total of 26 people were killed in the collision section there, mostly Italian immigrant families.

Among those killed in the collision on C Deck was opera singer Agnes Baratta, who at the time was a leading soprano of Milan&#x27;s La Scala Opera House. She and her elderly mother Margherita Baratta had been en route to Redwood City, California, to visit her sister, after which Agnes had intended to audition for the San Francisco Opera House. Maria Theresina Imberlone, like the Barattas, was also bound for the San Francisco Bay Area, and was also killed in the collision. Imberlone&#x27;s husband Giacomo and their 13-year-old son Giovanni, who shared another cabin, both survived.

Among the losses was that of Maria Sergio and her four children, 13-year-old Giuseppe, 10-year-old Anna Maria, 7-year-old Domenica, and 4-year-old Rocco, who occupied a cabin on the starboard side of C Deck that was in direct line of the collision. She was traveling aboard &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; with her children on her way to South Bend, Indiana, where her husband, Ross Sergio, and their 17-year-old son Anthony, were waiting for them. Anthony Sergio had in fact sailed to the United States from Italy aboard &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; the previous April. Also traveling with them were Maria&#x27;s sister Margaret and her husband Paul Sergio, who also happened to be Ross Sergio&#x27;s brother. Paul and Margaret had emigrated to the U.S. prior to the voyage and had returned to Italy for a visit and to accompany Maria and the children back to Indiana. Both Paul and Margaret survived the sinking, and for years after the disaster, Paul was haunted by the memory of his four-year-old nephew Rocco, the youngest of his brother&#x27;s children, who just hours prior to the collision had asked if he could spend the night with his uncle.

Also lost in the collision section of C deck were Angelina Diana and her two youngest children, eight-year-old Biaggio and six-year-old Victoria. They had been en route to Hartford, Connecticut, where Angelina&#x27;s husband Antonio and three of their older children were waiting. In a 2003 episode of the History Channel series &quot;Deep Sea Detectives&quot; featuring the story of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;, show host and wreck diver John Chatterton met with Angelina Diana&#x27;s son Gennaro and his daughter, whom he&#x27;d named Angelina, after her grandmother, and heard the story of how the disaster came to impact their family so profoundly. In speaking with Chatterton, Gennaro recalled excitedly waking up that morning and driving to New York with his father and two older sisters to meet the rest of their family, but as the survivors from &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; came ashore, they waited for five or six days until it was confirmed that Angelina, Biaggio and Victoria were among the 51 people who lost their lives in the disaster. Meanwhile, the younger Angelina explained how she grew up with a sense of great pride having been named after her grandmother, which was in turn mirrored with sadness in never having gotten to know her, or her aunt and uncle. She then gives Chatterton a green bottle containing a family jewel, asking him to place it on the wreck to honor their loved ones&#x27; memory, which Chatterton does later in the episode during a dive to the wrecksite.

In addition to the lives lost in the collision, three more of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;″s passengers died from injuries and ailments that occurred during and after the evacuation. Norma Di Sandro, a four-year-old Italian girl traveling in tourist class with her parents, Tullio and Filomena Di Sandro, was dropped on her head into a lifeboat by her panicked father. She was taken to &quot;Stockholm&quot; and subsequently airlifted to Brighton Marine Hospital in Boston, where she died from a fractured cranium without ever regaining consciousness. Carl Watres, a businessman from Manasquan, New Jersey, who was traveling in cabin class aboard &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; with his wife Lillian, died from a sudden heart attack while en route to New York aboard &quot;Stockholm&quot;. Angelina Grego, a 48-year-old, broke her back after falling into one of &quot;Ile de France&quot; lifeboats. She was taken to St. Claire&#x27;s Hospital in New York City, where she lingered in intense pain until her death six months later.

After the ships had separated, &quot;Stockholm&quot; crew members began to survey the damage. On the top deck of &quot;Stockholm&quot;, one of the crew came across Linda Morgan, who had been thrown from her bed on &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; as the two ships collided, and landed on &quot;Stockholm&quot;″s deck, suffering moderate but not life-threatening injuries. Others were not as fortunate, as five of &quot;Stockholm&quot;″s crew perished in the collision.

==Aftermath==
===Litigation and determination of fault: 1956–57===

Several months of hearings were held in New York City in the aftermath of the collision. Prominent maritime attorneys represented both the ships&#x27; owners. Dozens of attorneys represented victims and families of victims. Officers of both ship lines had testified, including the officers in charge of each ship at the time of the collision, with more scheduled to appear later until an out-of-court settlement was reached, and the hearings ended abruptly.

Both shipping lines contributed to a settlement fund for the victims. Each line absorbed its own damages. For the Swedish-American Line, damages were estimated at $2 million, half for repairs to &quot;Stockholm&quot;″s bow, and half for lost business during repairs. The Italian Line sustained the loss of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;″s full value, estimated to be $30 million.

A U.S. Congressional hearing was also held, and provided some determinations, notably about the lack of ballasting specified by the builders during the fatal voyage and the resulting lack of seaworthiness of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; after the collision. The Italian Line’s chief lawyer was Morgan J. Burke Jr., who was awarded the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic for his efforts.

While heavy fog was given as the primary cause of the accident, and it is not disputed that intermittent and heavy fog are both frequent and challenging conditions for mariners in that part of the ocean, these other factors have been cited:

# &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;″s officers had not followed proper radar procedures or used the plotting equipment available in the chartroom adjacent to the bridge of their ship to plot and then calculate the course, position and speed of the other (approaching) ship. Thus, they failed to realize &quot;Stockholm&quot;″s speed and course.
# &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; had not followed the long-established rule that vessels approaching head-to-head both turn towards the right (to starboard). As &quot;Stockholm&quot; turned to starboard, &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; turned to port, closing the circle instead of opening it. Beyond a certain point, it became impossible to avoid a collision.
# Captain Calamai of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; was deliberately speeding in heavy fog, an admittedly common practice on passenger liners. The navigation rules required speed to be reduced during periods of limited visibility to a stopping distance within half the distance of visibility. As a practical matter, this would have meant reducing the speed of the ship to virtually zero in the dense fog.
# &quot;Stockholm&quot; and &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; were experiencing different weather conditions immediately prior to the collision. The collision occurred in an area of the northern Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Massachusetts, where heavy and intermittent fog is common. Although &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; had been engulfed in the fog for several hours, &quot;Stockholm&quot; had only recently entered the bank and was still acclimating to atmospheric conditions. The officer in charge of &quot;Stockholm&quot; incorrectly assumed that his inability to see the other vessel was due to conditions other than fog, such as the other ship being a very small fishing vessel or a &#x27;blacked-out&#x27; warship on maneuvers. He testified that he had no idea it was another passenger liner speeding through fog.
# &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;″s fuel tanks were half empty and not pumped with seawater ballast to stabilize the ship, in accordance with the Italian Line&#x27;s procedures. This contributed to the pronounced list following the collision, the inability of the crew to pump water into the port fuel tanks to right the ship, and the inability to use the port lifeboats for the evacuation.
# Also, a watertight door may have been missing between bulkheads near the engine room, which was thought to have contributed to &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;″s problems.
# &quot;Stockholm&quot;″s navigating officer misread his radar thinking he was on a setting when in reality the radar was set for . Thus, he thought he was farther from &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; than he actually was. He also failed to consult his captain as was required by regulation.

Both lines had an incentive to limit the public discussion of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;″s structural and stability problems. &quot;Stockholm&quot;″s owners had another new ship, &quot;Gripsholm&quot;, under construction at Ansaldo Shipyard in Italy, the same yard that had built &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;. &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;″s designers and engineers had been scheduled to testify, but the hearings were abruptly concluded before their testimony could be heard due to the settlement agreement.

===Resulting reforms===
The &quot;Andrea Doria–Stockholm&quot; collision led to several rule changes in the immediate years following the incident to avoid a recurrence. Since this was essentially a radar-assisted collision event, in which over-use was made of poorly handled technology, shipping lines were required to improve training on the use of radar equipment. Also, approaching ships were required to make radio contact with one another. Both ships saw each other on their radar systems and attempted to turn. Unfortunately, one of the radar systems was poorly designed, resulting in the collision. Marine craft today are required to turn to starboard (right) in a head-on situation.

===Later investigations and study===
Unanswered questions about the tragedy, and questions of cause and blame, have intrigued observers and haunted survivors for over 50 years. The fact that &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; and &quot;Stockholm&quot; were speeding in heavy fog (21.8 knots and 18.5 knots, respectively, at the collision) and questions about their seaworthiness arose at the time. Captain Calamai never assumed another command because the Italian Line feared bad publicity. However, largely because the out-of-court settlement agreement between the two shipping companies ended the fact-finding that was taking place in the hearings immediately after the disaster, no resolution of the cause(s) was ever formally accomplished. This has led to continued development of information and a search for greater understanding, aided by newer technologies in over half a century since the disaster.

Recent discoveries using computer animation and newer undersea diving technology have shed additional light on some aspects.
* Many years later, scientific study of the actions of the two crews indicated a probability that the third mate on &quot;Stockholm&quot; misinterpreted his radar in the minutes prior to the impact. Recent studies and computer simulations carried out by Captain Robert J. Meurn of the United States Merchant Marine Academy and based on the findings of John C. Carrothers suggest &quot;Stockholm&quot; Third Officer Carstens-Johannsen misinterpreted radar data and badly overestimated the distance between the two ships. The poor design of the radar settings, coupled with unlighted range settings and a darkened bridge, makes this scenario possible. Some critics have suggested that a simple and available technology, a small light bulb on the radar set aboard &quot;Stockholm&quot;, might have averted the entire disaster. Instead, he may have unintentionally steered the Swedish ship into a collision with the Italian liner.
* Exploration of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;″s impact area revealed that &quot;Stockholm&quot;″s bow had ripped a much larger gash in the critical area of the large fuel tanks and watertight compartments of the Italian liner than had been thought in 1956. The question of the &quot;missing&quot; watertight door, although still unanswered, was probably moot: &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; was doomed immediately after the collision.
* &quot;...In maritime navigation, all collision avoidance manoeuvres are made based on the Collision Regulations COLREG. Although these rules have helped in managing the maritime traffic and also advised every vessel about the collision avoidance manoeuvres that need to be taken in every situation, they have not stopped accidents from happening (Demirel and Bayer, 2015; Lušić and Erceg, 2008). After a deep study of the COLREG a number of issues that can cause a hassle and confusion for the OOW (Officer On Watch) were identified (Belcher, 2002; Demirel and Bayer, 2015; Szlapczynski and Szlapczynska, 2015; Wylie, 1962)...&quot; Extracted from Distance Comparative Review of Collision Avoidance Systems in Maritime and Aviation - Hesham Abdushkour, Osman Turan, Evangelos Boulougouris, Rafet Emek Kurt (University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, United Kingdom), a paper addressed to the transfer of TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System) aerospace technology to maritime navigation.

==Wreck site==

Due to the luxurious appointments and initially good condition of the wreck, with the top of the wreck lying initially in 160 feet (50 m) of water, &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; has been a frequent target of treasure divers. It is commonly referred to as the &quot;Mount Everest of scuba diving.&quot; The comparison to Mt. Everest originated after a July 1983 dive on &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; by Capt. Alvin Golden during a CBS News-televised interview of the divers following their return from a dive expedition to the wreck aboard the R/V &quot;Wahoo&quot;. The depth, water temperature, and currents combine to put the wreck beyond the scope of recreational diving. The skills and equipment required to successfully execute this dive, such as use of mixed gases and staged decompression, put it in the realm of only the most experienced technical divers. The wreck is located near .

A week after &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; sank, divers Peter Gimbel and Joseph Fox managed to locate the wreck of the ship, and published pictures of the wreck in &quot;Life&quot;.

In 1968, film director Bruno Vailati, together with Stefano Carletti, Mimi Dies, Arnaldo Mattei, and Al Giddings (an experienced American diver), organized and directed the first Italian expedition to the wreck, producing the documentary titled &quot;Andrea Doria -74&quot;. The wreck was marked with a bronze plaque with the inscription: &quot;We came here to work to make the dream come true and return the &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; to the light&quot;.

Peter Gimbel later conducted a number of salvage operations on the ship, including salvaging the first-class bank safe in 1981. Despite speculation that passengers had deposited many valuables, the safe, opened on live television in 1984, yielded thousands of American silver certificates, Canadian bank notes, American Express travellers checks, and Italian bank notes, but no other valuables. This outcome apparently confirmed other speculation that most &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; passengers, in anticipation of the ship&#x27;s scheduled arrival in New York City the following morning, had already retrieved their valuables prior to the collision.

Evelyn Bartram Dudas (22) was the first woman to successfully dive onto &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;. Dudas reached the wreck in June 1967; she and her future husband, John Dudas, retrieved the ship&#x27;s compass. Other well-known divers to explore the &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; are Steve Belinda, John Chatterton, Gary Gentile, Gary Gilligan, Richie Kohler and John Mattera.

As of 2010, years of ocean submersion have taken their toll. The wreck has aged and deteriorated extensively, with the hull now fractured and collapsed. The upper decks have slowly slid off the wreck to the seabed below. As a result of this transformation, a large debris field flows out from the hull of the liner. Once-popular access points frequented by divers, such as Gimbel&#x27;s hole, no longer exist. Divers call &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; a &quot;noisy&quot; wreck, as it emits various noises due to continual deterioration and from the ocean currents moving broken metal around inside the hull. However, due to this decay, new access areas are constantly opening up for future divers on the ever-changing wreck.

A 2016 expedition to the wreck by OceanGate revealed that &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; was decaying rapidly. &quot;When you look at the shape of the hull, it appears a lot has come off,&quot; Stockton Rush, OceanGate&#x27;s CEO, said. One of the pieces now broken off the wreck is the ship&#x27;s bow. During dives using the &quot;Cyclops 1&quot; submersible, owned by OceanGate and piloted by Stockton Rush, damage was caused to the &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; after direct collision on the port side of the bow. 

After years of removal of artifacts by divers, little of value was thought to remain. Significant artifacts recovered include the statue of Genoese Admiral Andrea Doria, for whom the ship was named. It was removed from the first-class lounge, having been cut off at the ankles to accomplish this. Examples of the ship&#x27;s china have long been considered valuable mementos of diving the wreck. The ship&#x27;s bell is normally considered to be the prize of a wreck. This ship carried three bells: one bell located on the bridge, and two much larger ceremonial bells located on the fore and aft decks. The ship&#x27;s stern bell was retrieved in the late 1980s by a team of divers led by Bill Nagle. On 26 June 2010, a diver from New Jersey, Carl Bayer, diving from the Narragansett, Rhode Island–based dive boat EXPLORER, owned by Capt. Dave Sutton, discovered the bridge bell lying on the bottom at . He recovered it with assistance from Ernie Rookey, also from New Jersey. The bell, tall and weighing , was possibly used to signal fog on the night of the collision. The forward bell remains undiscovered. It has for years been thought to be in the ship&#x27;s paint locker where it was stored during ocean crossings, but recent reports indicate that this part of the ship has collapsed in on itself and the forward bell may never be found.

In 2017 a salvage team recovered one of the ship&#x27;s two foghorns. In July 2021 the restored foghorn was sounded at the New Jersey Maritime Museum to commemorate the 65th anniversary of the sinking.

===Deaths===
Artifact recovery on &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; has resulted in additional loss of life. At least 22 scuba divers have lost their lives diving on the wreck, and diving conditions at the wreck site are considered very treacherous. Strong currents and heavy sediment that can reduce visibility to zero pose serious hazards to diving this site. Dr. Robert Ballard (who found the wrecks of the ocean liner , the , and the American aircraft carrier and torpedo boat ) who visited the site in a US Navy submersible in 1995, reported that thick fishing nets draped the hull. An invisible web of thin fishing lines, which can snag scuba gear, increases danger. The wreck is slowly collapsing; the top of the wreck is now at , and many of the passageways have begun to collapse.

The wreck site is nicknamed &quot;The Everest of Wreck Diving&quot; because of the number of deaths exploring the site.

* 1956: William Edgerton, 23, part of an effort to photograph the recently sunk &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;, died shortly after one of the valves on his breathing apparatus became partially closed.
* 1981: John Barnett drowned while diving on &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;.
* 1984: Frank Kennedy surfaced unconscious after a dive on &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; and died on board RV &quot;Wahoo&quot; before help arrived.
* 1985: John Ormsby drowned after being caught in wires.
* 1988: Joe Drozd died during a dive on &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;.
* 1992: Mathew Lawrence and Mike Scofield drowned while diving on &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;.
* 1993: Robert Santuli died from oxygen poisoning while diving on &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;.
* 1998: Craig Sicola, Richard Roost, and Vincent Napoliello all died diving on &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;.
* 1999: Christopher Murley and Charles J. McGurr both died of apparent heart attacks preparing for a second dive.
* 2002: William Schmoldt died from decompression sickness.
* 2006: Researcher David Bright died from decompression sickness.
* 2008: Terry DeWolf of Houston, Texas, died during a dive on the wreck site; the cause of death was not determined.
* 2011: Michael LaPrade of Los Angeles died during a dive on the wreck.
* 2015: Tom Pritchard, 64, is presumed dead after diving on the wreck.
* 2017: Steven Slater, 46, of Gateshead, England, was pulled from the water unconscious and could not be revived.

==Legacy==
===MS &quot;Stockholm&quot;===
&quot;Stockholm&quot;″s bow was replaced in New York at a cost of $1 million. As of 2016, the former &quot;Stockholm&quot; sailed as and her current status is &#x27;to be scrapped&#x27; 

===Survivors===
Survivors went on with their lives with a wide range of experiences. Captain Calamai never accepted another command, and lived the rest of his life in sadness &quot;as a man who has lost a son&quot;, according to his daughter. Most of the other officers returned to the sea. Some survivors had mental problems for years after the incident, while others felt their experience had helped them value their lives more preciously.

===In culture===
====Artwork====
* Two bronze medallions, commissioned by survivors Pierette Domenica Simpson and Jerome Reinert and survivor&#x27;s daughter Angela Addario, are in the South Street Seaport Museum of New York, and in the Museo del Mare of Genova, Italy.
* California sculptor Daniel Oberti created the two works called &quot;The Greatest Sea Rescue in History&quot;.
* A large-scale painting, &quot;The Andrea Doria Crosses the World Trade Center&quot; by Ronald Mallory, was commissioned by Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for Windows on the World at the World Trade Center. The painting hung on the 107th floor since 1982, and was lost with the destruction of the towers on 11 September 2001.
* An oil painting, &quot;The Andrea Doria in Genoa Harbor&quot; by Michael E. Von Drak, commissioned June 1986 by Bruno P. Pella for his Ristorante Grifone, San Francisco, California.

====Music====
In 1969 Polish rock band Niebiesko-Czarni with singer Wojciech Korda recorded the song &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;

In 1973, German singer Udo Lindenberg published an album titled &quot;Alles klar auf der Andrea Doria&quot; (All&#x27;s Well on the &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;), containing a song of the same name.

The liner is also referenced in the Steely Dan song &quot;Things I Miss The Most&quot; from their 2003 album &quot;Everything Must Go&quot;.

In 1986 Brazilian rock band Legião Urbana recorded the song &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; in their second album &quot;Dois&quot;.

====Books====
The liner is mentioned in more than 500 of the many written biographies of Elvis Presley, because one of the survivors was Mike Stoller of the songwriting team Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. As Stoller reached the port of New York, Leiber informed him at the main dock that their 1952 composition &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, a number one R&amp;B record for Big Mama Thornton, was once more and right there and then, the number one record in the nation in all three charts: R&amp;B, Pop and C&amp;W, albeit this time &quot;by a young Mississippian by the name of Elvis Presley&quot;. Stoller, who had been in Europe for over 10 months, did not know who Presley was, so he asked Leiber the now famous &quot;Elvis who?&quot;. They would go on to write several more number one hits, including two written exclusively for Presley, &quot;Don&#x27;t&quot;, a number one in early 1958, as well as the title song and most of the soundtrack for Presley&#x27;s third movie, the 1957 MGM production of the mega hit &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;.

The liner is also mentioned often in the book Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson. This true story talks about many of the divers that dove on the Andrea Doria and about some of their dives.

=====Fiction=====
In the 1969 adventure novel &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, the &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;&#x27;s collision with &quot;Stockholm&quot; and resulting sinking are briefly mentioned by Hubert Miller, who compares the capsizing of SS Poseidon to that of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;.

In Tom Clancy&#x27;s &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, a stakes out a New York-to-Europe convoy intended to reinforce NATO against a Soviet attack by sitting next to the wreck of &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; – hoping to confuse magnetic anomaly detector readings. and , working in conjunction, use their helicopters to find and destroy the submarine.

In Clive Cussler&#x27;s &quot;Serpent&quot; (1999), the &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; was purposely sunk by the secret organization called the &quot;Brotherhood&quot; to hide the fact of pre-Columbian contact of Mayans and Europe made by Phoenicians. The liner was carrying a large stone tablet that was essential to find out the long lost Phoenician treasure.

&quot;I Was Shipwrecked on the Andrea Doria! The Titanic of the 1950s&quot; was written by survivor Pierette Domenica Simpson.

<doc id="350712" wikidata="Q1259759" url="?curid=350712" title="Miniseries">
<text>In the USA, a miniseries or mini-series is a television show or series that tells a story in a predetermined, limited number of episodes. Many miniseries can also be referred to, and shown, as a television film. &quot;Limited series&quot; is a more recent US term which is sometimes used interchangeably. , the popularity of miniseries format has increased in both streaming services and broadcast television.

The term &quot;serial&quot; is used in the United Kingdom and in other Commonwealth nations to describe a show that has an ongoing narrative plotline, while &quot;series&quot; is used for a set of episodes in a similar way that &quot;season&quot; is used in North America.

== Definitions==
A miniseries is distinguished from an ongoing television series; the latter does not usually have a predetermined number of episodes and may continue for several years. Before the term was coined in the US in the early 1970s, the ongoing episodic form was always called a &quot;serial&quot;, just as a novel appearing in episodes in successive editions of magazines or newspapers is called a serial. In Britain, miniseries are often still referred to as serials or series.

Several commentators have offered more precise definitions of the term. In &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Television Companion&quot; (1987), Leslie Halliwell and Philip Purser suggest that miniseries tend to &quot;appear in four to six episodes of various lengths&quot;, while Stuart Cunningham in &quot;Textual Innovation in the Australian Historical Mini-series&quot; (1989) defined a miniseries as &quot;a limited run program of more than two and less than the 13-part season or half season block associated with serial or series programming&quot;. With the proliferation of the format in the 1980s and 90s, television films broadcast over even two or three nights were commonly referred to as miniseries in the US.

In &quot;Television: A History&quot; (1985), Francis Wheen points out a difference in character development between the two: &quot;Both soap operas and primetime series cannot afford to allow their leading characters to develop, since the shows are made with the intention of running indefinitely. In a miniseries on the other hand, there is a clearly defined beginning, middle, and end (as in a conventional play or novel), enabling characters to change, mature, or die as the serial proceeds&quot;.

In 2015, the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences changed its guidelines on how Emmy nominees are classified, with shows with a limited run all referred to as &quot;limited series&quot; instead of &quot;miniseries&quot;. This was a reversion to 1974, when the category was named &quot;outstanding limited series&quot;. It had been changed to &quot;outstanding miniseries&quot; in 1986. Miniseries were put in the same category as made-for-television films from 2011 to 2014 before being given separate categories again.

===21st-century definitions===
The &quot;Collins English Dictionary&quot; (online, as of 2021, UK) defines a miniseries as &quot;a television programme in several parts that is shown on consecutive days or weeks for a short period; while &quot;Webster&#x27;s New World College Dictionary&quot;&#x27;s (4th ed., 2010, US) definition is &quot;a TV drama or docudrama broadcast serially in a limited number of episodes&quot;.

In popular usage, by around 2020, the boundaries between miniseries and limited series have become somewhat blurred; the format has been described as a series with &quot;a self-contained narrative – whether three or 12 episodes long&quot;.

==History==
=== United Kingdom ===
The British television &quot;serial&quot; is rooted in dramatic radio productions developed between the First and the Second World Wars. In the 1920s the BBC pioneered dramatic readings of books. In 1925 it broadcast &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, which became a holiday favourite. Later, John Reith, wanting to use radio waves to &quot;part the clouds of ignorance&quot;, came up with the idea of a &quot;Classic Serial&quot;, based on a &quot;classical&quot; literary text.

In 1939 the BBC adapted the romantic novel &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; for radio broadcast. Its adapter, Jack Inglis, compressed several characters into one and simplified the plotline. The production struck a chord with listeners and served as a prototype for serials that followed it.

Post-war BBC Television picked up the classic radio serial tradition by broadcasting &quot;The Warden&quot; by Anthony Trollope over six-episodes in 1951. &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was serialised in 1952, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; in 1955. In 1953 the BBC broadcast the first serial written specifically for television: the six-part &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;. Its success paved the way for two more six-part serials: &quot;Quatermass II&quot; in 1955 and &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; in 1958. In November 1960 the BBC televised a thirteen-episode adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot;. In December of that year it broadcast a four-episode dramatisation of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Persuasion&quot;.

To compete with commercial television, BBC launched BBC2 in 1964. It had a new time slot allocated for classic serial adaptations on Saturday evenings. The late-night broadcast allowed for more risky and sophisticated choices and for longer episodes. In 1967 &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; was broadcast in 26 50-minute episodes. Following its success in Britain, the series was shown in the United States on public television and broadcast all over the world, and became the first BBC television series to be sold to the Soviet Union.

=== North America ===
Anthology series dominated American dramatic programming during the Golden Age of Television, when &quot;every night was opening night; one never knew when a flick of the knob would spark the birth of great theatrical literature&quot;. A different story and a different set of characters were presented in each episode. Very rarely the stories were split into several episodes, like 1955 &quot;Mr. Lincoln&quot; from Omnibus series, which was presented in two parts, or 1959 adaptation of &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; from &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; series, which was initially planned by the director John Frankenheimer to consist of three parts, but ultimately was broadcast as two 90-minute installments. The high cost and technical difficulties of staging a new play every week, which would cost as much as—or more than—an episode of a filmed television series, led to the demise of anthology programming by the end of the 1950s. The void was filled with less expensive series like &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; or &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, which featured the same characters every week and had higher potential for lucrative rebroadcast and syndication rights. It was the American success in 1969–1970 of the British 26-episode serial &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; (1967) that made TV executives realize that finite multi-episode stories based on novels could be popular and could provide a boost to weekly viewing figures.

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the earliest known use of the word miniseries was in 1963, when it was employed (in hyphenated form) by the Connellsville &quot;Daily Courier&quot; to describe a limited five-week run of the CBS music show &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;.
&quot;The Blue Knight&quot;, a four-hour made-for-television movie broadcast in one-hour segments over four nights in November 1973, has elsewhere been credited as the first miniseries on American television. It starred William Holden as a Los Angeles beat cop about to retire. The miniseries form continued in earnest in the spring of 1974 with the CBC&#x27;s eight-part serial &quot;The National Dream&quot;, based on Pierre Berton&#x27;s nonfiction book of the same name about the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and ABC&#x27;s two-part &quot;QB VII&quot;, based on the novel by Leon Uris. Following these initial forays, broadcasters used miniseries to bring other books to the screen.

&quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot;, based on the novel by Irwin Shaw, was broadcast in 12 one-hour episodes in 1976 by ABC. It popularized the miniseries format and started a decade-long golden age of television miniseries versions of popular books featuring stars above television class. Alex Haley&#x27;s &quot;Roots&quot; in 1977 can fairly be called the first blockbuster success of the format. Its success in the USA was partly due to its schedule: the 12-hour duration was split into eight episodes broadcast on consecutive nights, resulting in a finale with a 71 percent share of the audience and 130 million viewers, which at the time was the highest rated TV program ever. &quot;TV Guide&quot; ( 11–17 April 1987) called 1977&#x27;s &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; &quot;the best miniseries of all time&quot; and &quot;unparalleled television&quot;. &quot;North and South&quot;, the 1985 adaptation of a 1982 novel by John Jakes, remains one of the 10 highest rated miniseries in TV history.

=== Japan ===
Japanese serialized television production can be traced back to the &quot;Sunday Diary of My Home&quot; (&quot;Waga Ya no Nichiyo Nikki&quot;), which was aired by NTV in 1953 and consisted of 25 half-hour episodes. This &quot;home drama&quot; focused on generational differences and the contradictions of being a loving family in a confined space, outlining a style of drama that lives on to this day. In the same year NHK tried its own variation of the home drama format in the &quot;Ups and Downs Toward Happiness&quot; (&quot;Kofuku e no Kifuku&quot;), which comprised thirteen episodes. Its protagonists, a formerly wealthy family fallen on hard times, is forced to struggle for its own existence. Since then, Japanese television drama, also called , became a staple of Japanese television.

Evening dramas air weekly and usually comprise ten to fourteen one-hour long episodes. Typically, instead of being episodic there is one story running throughout the episodes. Since they are of a fixed length, dramas have a definite ending, and since they are relatively long, they can explore character, situation, and interesting dialogue in a way not possible in movies. Doramas are never canceled mid-season, but they also do not continue into the next season even if extremely popular. Popular dramas do often give rise to &quot;specials&quot; made after the final episode, if the show has been a huge success.

=== South Korea ===
South Korea started to broadcast television series () in the 1960s. Since then, the shows became popular worldwide, partially due to the spread of the Korean Wave, with streaming services that offer multiple language subtitles.

Korean dramas are usually helmed by one director and written by one screenwriter, thus having a distinct directing style and language, unlike American television series, where often several directors and writers work together. Series set in contemporary times usually run for one season, for 12–24 episodes of 60 minutes each.

Historical series (&quot;Sageuk&quot;) may be longer, with 50 to 200 episodes, and are either based on historical figures, incorporate historical events, or use a historical backdrop. While technically the word &quot;sageuk&quot; literally translates to &quot;historical drama,&quot; the term is typically reserved for dramas taking place during Korean history. Popular subjects of sageuks have traditionally included famous battles, royalty, famous military leaders and political intrigues.

Korean dramas are usually shot within a very tight schedule, often a few hours before actual broadcast. Screenplays are flexible and may change anytime during production, depending on viewers&#x27; feedback.

=== Soviet Union/Russia ===
While the Soviet Union was among the first European countries to resume television broadcast after the Second World War, early Soviet television did not indulge its viewers with a variety of programming. News, sports, concerts and movies were the main staples during the 1950s. With state control over television production and broadcast, television was intended not merely for entertainment, but also as the means of education and propaganda. Soap operas, quiz shows and games were considered too lowbrow.

In the beginning of the 1960s television was expanding rapidly. The increase in the number of channels and the duration of daily broadcast caused shortage of content deemed suitable for broadcast. This led to production of television films, in particular &quot;multiple-episode television films&quot; (Russian: многосерийный телевизионный фильм &quot;mnogoseriyny televizionny film&quot;)—the official Soviet moniker for miniseries. Despite that the Soviet Union started broadcasting in color in 1967, color TV sets did not become widespread until the end of the 1980s. This justified shooting made-for-TV movies on black-and-white film.

The 1965 four-episode &quot;Calling for fire, danger close&quot; is considered the first Soviet miniseries. It is a period drama set in the Second World War depicting the Soviet guerrilla fighters infiltrating German compound and directing the fire of the regular Soviet Army to destroy the German airfield. During the 1970s the straightforward fervor gave way to a more nuanced interplay of patriotism, family and everyday life wrapped into traditional genres of crime drama, spy show or thriller. One of the most popular Soviet miniseries—&quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot; about a Soviet spy operating in Nazi Germany—was shot in 1972. This 12-episode miniseries incorporated features of political thriller and docudrama and included excerpts from period newsreels. Originally produced in black-and-white in 4:3 aspect ratio, it was colorized and re-formatted for wide-screen TVs in 2009.

Other popular miniseries of the Soviet era include &quot;The Shadows Disappear at Noon&quot; (1971, 7 episodes) about the fate of several generations of locals from a Siberian village; &quot;The Long Recess&quot; (1973, 4 episodes) about the students and teachers of a night school; &quot;The Ordeal&quot; (1977, 13 episodes)—an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Aleksey Tolstoy, which traces the development of the Russian society during the critical years of the First World War, the 1917 revolution and the civil war that followed; &quot;The Days of the Turbins&quot; (1976, 3 episodes)—an adaptation of the play of the same name by Mikhail Bulgakov, about the fate of intelligentsia during the October Revolution in Russia; &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; (1976, 4 episodes)—an adaptation of the satirical novel of the same name by Ilf and Petrov, where two partners in crime search for chairs from a former twelve-chair set, one of which has jewelry stashed in it; &quot;Open Book&quot; (1977, 9 episodes)—an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Veniamin Kaverin about a Soviet female microbiologist who obtained the first batches of penicillin in the Soviet Union and organized its production; &quot;The Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed&quot; (1979, 5 episodes) about the fight against criminals in the immediate post-war period; &quot;Little Tragedies&quot; (1979, 3 episodes)—a collection of short theatrical plays based on works by Alexander Pushkin; &quot;The Suicide Club, or the Adventures of a Titled Person&quot; (1981, 3 episodes) about the adventures of Prince Florizel, a character of &quot;The Suicide Club&quot; stories by Robert Louis Stevenson; &quot;Dead Souls&quot; (1984, 5 episodes)—an adaptation of the novel of that name by Nikolai Gogol chronicling travels and adventures of Pavel Chichikov and the people whom he encounters; and &quot;TASS Is Authorized to Declare...&quot; (1984, 10 episodes) about the tug-of-war of Soviet and American intelligence agencies.

Numerous miniseries were produced for children in the 1970s–1980s. Among them are: &quot;The Adventures of Buratino&quot; (1976, 2 episodes)—an adaptation of &quot;The Golden Key, or the Adventures of Buratino&quot; by Alexey Tolstoy, which in turn is a retelling of &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; by Carlo Collodi; &quot;The Two Captains&quot; (1976, 6 episodes)—an adaptation of &quot;The Two Captains&quot; by Veniamin Kaverin about a search for a lost Arctic expedition and the discovery of Severnaya Zemlya; &quot;The Adventures of Elektronic&quot; (1979, 3 episodes) about a humanoid robot meeting and befriending his prototype—a 6th grade schoolboy; &quot;Guest from the Future&quot; (1985, 5 episodes) about a girl travelling to contemporary time from the future.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 the Russian television saw a period of privatization and liberalization. The television programming of the 1990s–2000s included a great deal of crime dramas set both in contemporary times (&quot;The Criminal Saint Petersburg&quot;, 2000, 90 episodes) as well in the Tsarist Russia (&quot;The Mysteries of Sankt Petersburg&quot;, 1994, 60 episodes).

Starting from the 2000s, Russian TV saw a resurgence of book adaptations, such as &quot;The Idiot&quot; (2003, 10 episodes)—an adaptation of the novel by Fyodor Dostoyevsky; &quot;The Case of Kukotskiy&quot; (2005, 12 episodes)—an adaptation of the novel by Lyudmila Ulitskaya; &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; (2005, 10 episodes)—an adaptation of the novel by Mikhail Bulgakov; &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (2006, 11 episodes)—an adaptation of the novel by Boris Pasternak; &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; (2008, 4 episodes)—an adaptation of the novel by Ivan Turgenev; &quot;Life and Fate&quot; (2012, 12 episodes)—an adaptation of the novel by Vasily Grossman; &quot;Kuprin&quot; (2014, 13 episodes)—an adaptation of several novels by Aleksandr Kuprin.

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, the Rede Globo television network commenced the production of this type of television genre with the transmission of &quot;Lampião e Maria Bonita&quot;, written by Aguinaldo Silva and Doc Comparato and directed by Paulo Afonso Grisolli, and broadcast in 1982 in eight episodes; in Brazil these episodes are popularly known as &quot;chapters&quot;, because each episode is analogous to a book chapter, where the following chapter begins at the same point where the previous one has ended.

Rede Manchete, in the following year after its creation (1984), has produced and broadcast &quot;Marquesa de Santos&quot;.

The Brazilian miniseries usually consist of several dozen chapters, occasionally having longer duration, like Brazilian Aquarelle that consists of 60 chapters, making it almost a &quot;mini-telenovela&quot;.

Due to the fact that they are broadcast at a later time than telenovelas (usually after 22:00 or 10 pm), miniseries are more daring in terms of themes, scenes, dialogues and situations, a function previously played by the &quot;novelas das dez&quot;—a popular term referring to the telenovelas that were broadcast at 10 p.m. between 1969 and 1979.

Miniseries made by Rede Globo are released in the DVD format by the aforementioned television network, and a few of these miniseries are also released as a book, especially in the case of great successes such as &quot;Anos Rebeldes&quot; (&quot;Rebel Years&quot;) and &quot;A Casa das Sete Mulheres&quot; (&quot;The House of the Seven Women&quot;); the latter was based on the eponymous book written by Letícia Wierzchowski, which became known due to the miniseries.

=== Australia ===
The first locally produced miniseries in Australia was &quot;Against the Wind,&quot; which aired in 1978. Over one hundred miniseries were produced in Australia over the next decade. Historical dramas were particularly popular with Australian audiences during this period. Between 1984 and 1987, twenty-seven out of a total of thirty-four Australian-made miniseries had historical themes. Some notable examples included &quot;The Dismissal, Bodyline, Eureka Stockade, The Cowra Breakout, Vietnam,&quot; and &quot;Brides&quot; &quot;of Christ&quot;. The narratives of these miniseries often followed one or two fictionalized individuals in the context of actual historical events and situations. Literary adaptations were also popular, with notable examples including &quot;A&quot; &quot;Town like Alice&quot;&quot;, A Fortunate Life, The Harp in the South&quot;, and &quot;Come In Spinner&quot;.

Although most Australian miniseries during this period were historically focused, there were occasional variants into genres such as contemporary action/adventure and romantic melodrama. The 1983 miniseries &quot;Return to Eden&quot; was Australia&#x27;s most successful miniseries ever, with over 300 million viewers around the world, and has been described as &quot;the best Australian example of the melodramatic miniseries.&quot;

The number of Australian-made miniseries declined in the 1990s, and many of those that were made had more of an &quot;international&quot; focus, often starring American or British actors in the leading roles and/or being filmed outside of Australia. Some notable examples included &quot;The Last Frontier, Which Way Home, A Dangerous Life, Bangkok Hilton,&quot; and &quot;Dadah Is Death.&quot;

More recently, true crime docudrama miniseries have become popular, with notable examples including &quot;Blue Murder&quot; and the &quot;Underbelly&quot; anthology.

==Popularity==
The eighteen-hour 1983 miniseries &quot;The Winds of War&quot; was a ratings success, with 140 million viewers for all or part of the miniseries, making it the most-watched miniseries up to that time. Its 1988 sequel &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; won for best miniseries, special effects and single-camera production editing, and was considered by some critics the ultimate epic miniseries on the American television. However, it also signalled the start of the format&#x27;s decline, as the $105 million production was a major ratings flop; the advent of VCR and cable television options was responsible for the decrease of length and ratings of most miniseries that continued into the mid-1990s. By 1996, the highest-rated miniseries of the winter season garnered a 19 rating, less than the rating average of 22 of that same season&#x27;s top-rated regular series.

In Egypt, the 1980s and 1990s was the golden age of television miniseries attracting millions of Egyptians. For example, &quot;The Family of Mr Shalash&quot; miniseries starring Salah Zulfikar was the highest rated at the time.

The Emmy Award was taken three times by the British police procedural drama &quot;Prime Suspect&quot;. A highlight of the 1990s was an HBO production &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, telling the story of the landmark Apollo expeditions to the Moon during the 1960s and early 1970s.

In the 21st century, the format made a comeback on cable television and became popular on streaming services. History, for example, has had some of its greatest successes with miniseries such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Hatfields &amp; McCoys&quot; and &quot;The Bible&quot;, &quot;Political Animals&quot; by USA Network was honored with a Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Most Exciting New Series award, while HBO&#x27;s &quot;Big Little Lies&quot; (which was eventually renewed for a second season) won eight Emmy awards.

To designate one-season shows that are not intended for being renewed for additional seasons, the broadcast and television industry came up with terms like &quot;limited series&quot; or &quot;event series&quot;. These terms also apply to multi-season shows which feature rotating casts and storylines each season, such as &quot;American Horror Story&quot;, &quot;Fargo&quot; and &quot;True Detective&quot;. This makes the self-contained season longer than a miniseries, but shorter than the entire run of the multi-season series. This terminology became relevant for the purpose of categorization of programs for industry awards.

Several television executives interviewed by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; stated that the term &quot;miniseries&quot; has negative connotations to the public, having become associated with melodrama-heavy works that were commonly produced under the format, while &quot;limited series&quot; or &quot;event series&quot; demand higher respect. (Such was the cause of the parody miniseries &quot;The Spoils of Babylon&quot;, which lampooned many of the negative stereotypes of miniseries.)

In the 21st century, two miniseries have had significant impact on pop culture, and are often named the two best shows ever made: &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, released in 2001, and &quot;Chernobyl&quot;, released in 2019. When the final episode of Chernobyl aired, it was already the highest rated show in IMDb history.

The mini-series as a format has become more popular than ever before.

<doc id="350713" wikidata="Q1364087" url="?curid=350713" title="Tom Johnson (composer)">
<text>Thomas Floyd Johnson (November 18, 1939 – December 31, 2024) was an American composer and music critic associated with minimalism. After a religious upbringing in Colorado, he studied at Yale with Allen Forte and in New York City with Morton Feldman. There he covered the work of several noted composers, bringing them to wider attention in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. He was the first to apply the term minimal to music in his 1972 article &quot;The Slow-Motion Minimal Approach&quot;.

He found inspiration in the ideas of ancient and early modern mathematicians and philosophers, and collaborated with contemporary mathematicians, while incorporating theatrical and visual elements in his work. Johnson often sought to engage audiences by explaining or narrating the processes of his music in or as part of the musical experience. He relocated to Paris in 1983, where he remarried in 1986 and lived until his death. His works include &quot;An Hour for Piano&quot;, &quot;The Four-Note Opera&quot;, &quot;Riemannoper&quot;, and the &quot;Bonhoeffer Oratorio&quot;.

== Background and education ==
Thomas Floyd Johnson was born in Greeley, Colorado, on November 18, 1939, where he received a religious education at a Methodist church, which influenced his work. He earned two degrees from Yale, a B.A. (1961) and the M.Mus. (1967), His theory professor was Allen Forte who introduced him to American contemporary music. He also studied privately with Morton Feldman in New York City. He was influenced also by John Cage whom he met. 

==Career==
From 1971 to 1983, Johnson was a music critic for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, writing about new music. An anthology of these articles was published in 1989 by Het Apollohuis under the title &quot;The Voice of New Music&quot;. Through his work, he met composers Steve Reich and Philip Glass, among others. His writings were instrumental in the emergence of composers including Gavin Bryars, Cage, Brian Eno, Luc Ferrari, Glass, Phill Niblock, Éliane Radigue.

During this period he also composed four of his best known works: &quot;An Hour for Piano&quot; (1971), &quot;The Four-Note Opera&quot; (1972), &quot;Failing&quot; (1975) and &quot;Nine Bells&quot; (1979). In his humorous opera &quot;The Four-Note Opera&quot;, he uses only four notes. The singers play themselves, announcing what they and others do. The chorus proclaims &quot;There are three choruses in this opera. This is the first one. The second one will be almost like this one, but somewhat shorter [...]&quot;. The visual also plays a role in &quot;Nine Bells&quot; (1979), a piece written for nine bells suspended in a three by three square, with one bell in the center. The player moves around this square, hitting bells along the way, following paths that are quite varied but always systematic.

Johnson considered himself a minimalist composer, and was the first to apply this term to music in his article &quot;The Slow-Motion Minimal Approach&quot;, written for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 1972. His minimalism is of a formalist type, depending mostly on logical sequences, as in the 21 &quot;Rational Melodies&quot; (1982), where he explored procedures such as accumulation, counting, and isorhythm.

After 15 years in New York, he moved to Paris in 1983 where he lived with his wife, the artist Esther Ferrer. He composed the &quot;Riemannoper&quot; (&quot;Riemann Opera&quot;), deriving a humorous libretto from Hugo Riemann&#x27;s music dictionary. It was premiered in Bremen, and was staged more than 20 times afterwards.

He developed more complex techniques using mathematical notions. This began with the collection of &quot;Music for 88&quot; (1988), where he applied ideas of Eratosthenes, Euler, Mersenne, and Blaise Pascal. Later he collaborated with iving mathematicians, particularly Jean-Paul Allouche, Emmanuel Amiot, Jeff Dinitz, and Franck Jedrzejewski. With them he explored the notions of self-similar melodies (&quot;Loops for orchestra&quot;, 1998), tiling patterns (&quot;Tilework&quot;, 2003), and block designs (&quot;Block Design for Piano&quot;, 2005), along with homometric pairs (&quot;Intervals&quot;, 2013).

Johnson introduced text and visual images to produce a theatrical atmosphere close to performance art. The librettos for his operas, which he almost always wrote himself, describe what takes place in the music in an objective manner, somewhat reminiscent of Pirandello. Words intervene in many of his works, sometimes by a narrator who explains how the music is made, as in &quot;Eggs and Baskets&quot; (1987) and &quot;Narayana&#x27;s Cows&quot; (1989). From 1988 to 1992, Johnson worked on the &quot;Bonhoeffer Oratorio&quot; for two choruses, soloists and orchestra, using exclusively texts of the German pastor and theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, sermons and texts denouncing Nazism. He commented: &quot;I had a mission, a testimony to convey, a message, which my music doesn&#x27;t generally have&quot;.

The association of text and music led Johnson to write numerous radio pieces, most often for René Farabet (France Culture) and for (WDR). In &quot;Galileo&quot; (1999–2005), bells swing like pendulums in tempos determined by the length of their strings, permitting the composer to make music following the laws of the pendulum, as formulated by Galileo Galilei in the 17th century.

After 2000, the work of Johnson was less concerned with theatricality and turned more toward musical form and mathematics. From about 2004 to 2010 he worked with what he called &quot;rational harmonies&quot; in pieces like &quot;360 Chords for orchestra&quot; (2005) and &quot;Twelve&quot; (2008) for piano. Rhythm plays an important role in pieces such as &quot;Vermont Rhythms&quot; (2008), &quot;Munich Rhythms&quot; (2010), and &quot;Dutch Rhythms&quot; (2018). He also wrote pieces for jugglers (&quot;Three Notes for Three Jugglers&quot;, 2011; &quot;Dropping Balls&quot;, 2011), and completed several more ambitious projects (&quot;Seven Septets&quot;, 2007–2017; &quot;Counting to Seven&quot;, 2013; &quot;Plucking&quot;, 2015).

Johnson ran a series of broadcasts for the British FM Resonance called &quot;Music by my Friends&quot;. He founded two publishing companies for the publication of his works: &quot;Les Éditions 75&quot; in France and &quot;Two-Eighteen Press&quot; in the US.

==Personal life and death==
After a marriage to Kathy Duncan ended in divorce, Johnson married Esther Ferrer in 1986. They collaborated on artistic projects.

Johnson died from complications of a stroke and emphysema at his home in Paris on December 31, 2024, aged 85.

<text>A secretary desk or escritoire is made of a base of wide drawers topped by a desk with a hinged desktop surface, which is in turn topped by a bookcase usually closed with a pair of doors, often made of glass. The whole is usually a single, tall and heavy piece of furniture.
==History==

Like the slant-top desk, the main work surface is a hinged piece of wood that is flat when open and oblique when raised to enclose secondary work surfaces such as small shelves, small drawers and nooks stacked in front of the user. Thus, like the Wooton desk, the fall-front desk and others with a hinged desktop, and unlike closable desks with an unmovable desktop like the rolltop desk or the cylinder desk, all documents and various items must be removed from the work surface before closing up.

When closed, the secretary&#x27;s desk looks like a cross between a commode-dresser, a slant-top desk and a bookcase. The secretary is one of the most common antique desk forms and has been endlessly reproduced and copied for home use in the last hundred years. Among home desk forms, it is the tallest, biggest and heaviest, excluding wall units and modular desks, which typically can be disassembled for moving, or some of the biggest of the armoire desks, which are usually delivered unassembled.

The desk described here is most correctly termed a &quot;secretary and bookcase&quot;. There is no unanimity on this term, even among specialists. In Europe the same piece of furniture has been called &quot;bureau and bookcase&quot; and then desk and bookcase. Also, the general public usually calls this kind of desk a &quot;secretary&quot;, or &quot;secrétaire&quot;. In a taxonomic sense one could sometimes say that all desks which have the capacity to close off the working surface are secretaries, while all others are simply desks, but such a division would be too broad to be useful. To add to the confusion, certain forms of the secretary desk are called &quot;escritoire&quot;, usually when the bookcase section is covered with glazed panels instead of wooden doors, but the term &quot;escritoire&quot; is also sometimes used to define a very portable writing slope, which is it at the other extreme in terms of bulk and weight.
When a secretary desk is cut in half vertically, so to speak, to provide a secretary desk half as wide as usual on one side and a glassed door cabinet on the other, this big piece of furniture is called a &quot;side-by-side secretary&quot;. The term is also applied sometimes to very big pieces of furniture made up of three elements, one of them being a half-wide secretary desk.

On most antique secretaries and also on most reproductions the user has to pull out two small wooden planks called sliders (sometimes &quot;lopers&quot;) in order to support the desktop, before actually turning the desktop from its closed, angled, position to its normal horizontal working position. However, in quite a few of the antique versions a system of internal gears or levers connected both to the sliders and the hinged desktop automatically pushed the sliders out at the same time as the user pulled on the closed desktop to put it in its horizontal position. When the user closed it afterwards, the sliders would then retract automatically. In such a case, the secretary is also known as a mechanical desk like many other desk forms which have some sort of mechanism pushing out elements of the desk and then pulling them back in automatically.

A secretary desk is, despite its name, generally not used by a person with the title of secretary, since this kind of desk is an antique form which is now extremely rare in the modern office, where a secretary (frequently called an administrative assistant) normally works. Similar desks may be found in homes across Europe and North America used in backyards and patios to support modern remote work outdoors where weather permits.
