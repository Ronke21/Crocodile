<text>The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a weather phenomenon over the North Atlantic Ocean of fluctuations in the difference of atmospheric pressure at sea level (SLP) between the Icelandic Low and the Azores High. Through fluctuations in the strength of the Icelandic Low and the Azores High, it controls the strength and direction of westerly winds and location of storm tracks across the North Atlantic.

The NAO was discovered through several studies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Unlike the El Niño–Southern Oscillation phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean, the NAO is a largely atmospheric mode. It is one of the most important manifestations of climate fluctuations in the North Atlantic and surrounding humid climates.

The North Atlantic Oscillation is closely related to the Arctic oscillation (AO) (or Northern Annular Mode (NAM)), but should not be confused with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO).

== Definition ==

The NAO has multiple possible definitions. The easiest to understand are those based on measuring the seasonal average air pressure difference between stations, such as:
* Lisbon and Stykkishólmur/Reykjavík
* Ponta Delgada, Azores and Stykkishólmur/Reykjavík
* Azores (1865–2002), Gibraltar (1821–2007), and Reykjavík
These definitions all have in common the same northern point (because this is the only station in the region with a long record) in Iceland; and various southern points. All are attempting to capture the same pattern of variation, by choosing stations in the &quot;eye&quot; of the two stable pressure areas, the Azores High and the Icelandic Low (shown in the graphic).

A more complex definition, only possible with more complete modern records generated by numerical weather prediction, is based on the principal empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of surface pressure. This definition has a high degree of correlation with the station-based definition. This then leads onto a debate as to whether the NAO is distinct from the AO/NAM, and if not, which of the two is to be considered the most physically based expression of atmospheric structure (as opposed to the one that most clearly falls out of mathematical expression).

== Description ==
Westerly winds blowing across the Atlantic bring moist air into Europe. In years when westerlies are strong, summers are cool, winters are mild and rain is frequent. If westerlies are suppressed, the temperature is more extreme in summer and winter leading to heat waves, deep freezes and reduced rainfall.

A permanent low-pressure system over Iceland (the Icelandic Low) and a permanent high-pressure system over the Azores (the Azores High) control 
the direction and strength of westerly winds into Europe. The relative strengths and positions of these systems vary from year to year and this variation is known as the NAO. A large difference in the pressure at the two stations (a high index year, denoted NAO+) leads to increased westerlies and, consequently, cool summers and mild and wet winters in Central Europe and its Atlantic facade. In contrast, if the index is low (NAO-), westerlies are suppressed, northern European areas suffer cold dry winters and storms track southwards toward the Mediterranean Sea. This brings increased storm activity and rainfall to southern Europe and North Africa.

Especially during the months of November to April, the NAO is responsible for much of the variability of weather in the North Atlantic region, affecting wind speed and wind direction changes, changes in temperature and moisture distribution and the intensity, number and track of storms. Research now suggests that the NAO may be more predictable than previously assumed and skillful winter forecasts may be possible for the NAO.

There is some debate as to how much the NAO impacts short term weather over North America. While most agree that the impact of the NAO is much less over the United States than for Western Europe, the NAO is also believed to affect the weather over much of upper central and eastern areas of North America. During the winter, when the index is high (NAO+), the Azores High draws a stronger south-westerly circulation over the eastern half of the North American continent which prevents Arctic air from plunging southward (into the United States south of 40 latitude). In combination with the El Niño, this effect can produce significantly warmer winters over the upper Midwest and New England, but the impact to the south of these areas is debatable. Conversely, when the NAO index is low (NAO-), the upper central and northeastern portions of the United States can incur winter cold outbreaks more than the norm with associated heavy snowstorms. In summer, a strong NAO- is thought to contribute to a weakened jet stream that normally pulls zonal systems into the Atlantic Basin contributing significantly to excessively long-lasting heat waves over Europe, however, recent studies do not show the evidence of these associations.

More recent studies have shown that the components (pressure centers strength, and locations) of the NAO are more powerful to investigate the relationships to seasonal and sub-seasonal climate variability over Europe, North America and the Mediterranean region.

== Effects on North Atlantic sea level ==

Under a positive NAO index (NAO+), regional reduction in atmospheric pressure results in a regional rise in sea level due to the &#x27;inverse barometer effect&#x27;. This effect is important to both the interpretation of historic sea level records and predictions of future sea level trends, as mean pressure fluctuations of the order of millibars can lead to sea level fluctuations of the order of centimeters.

== North Atlantic hurricanes ==
By controlling the position of the Azores High, the NAO also influences the direction of general storm paths for major North Atlantic tropical cyclones: a position of the Azores High farther to the south tends to force storms into the Gulf of Mexico, whereas a northern position allows them to track up the North American Atlantic Coast.

As paleotempestological research has shown, few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000–1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium. These quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC – 1000 AD, when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3–5 times.

== Ecological effects ==

Until recently, the NAO had been in an overall more positive regime since the late 1970s, bringing colder conditions to the North-West Atlantic, which has been linked with the thriving populations of Labrador Sea snow crabs, which have a low temperature optimum.

The NAO+ warming of the North Sea reduces survival of cod larvae which are at the upper limits of their temperature tolerance, as does the cooling in the Labrador Sea, where the cod larvae are at their lower temperature limits. Though not the critical factor, the NAO+ peak in the early 1990s may have contributed to the collapse of the Newfoundland cod fishery.

In southwestern Europe, NAO- events are associated with increased aeolian activity.

On the East Coast of the United States an NAO+ causes warmer temperatures and increased rainfall, and thus warmer, less saline surface water. This prevents nutrient-rich upwelling which has reduced productivity. Georges Bank and the Gulf of Maine are affected by this reduced cod catch.

The strength of the NAO is also a determinant in the population fluctuations of the intensively studied Soay sheep.

Strangely enough, Jonas and Joern (2007) found a strong signal between NAO and grasshopper species composition in the tall grass prairies of the midwestern United States. They found that, even though NAO does not significantly affect the weather in the midwest, there was a significant increase in abundance of common grasshopper species (i.e. &quot;Hypochlora alba, Hesperotettix&quot; spp., &quot;Phoetaliotes nebrascensis, M. scudderi, M. keeleri, and Pseudopomala brachyptera&quot;) following winters during the positive phase of NAO and a significant increase in the abundance of less common species (i.e. &quot;Campylacantha olivacea, Melanoplus sanguinipes, Mermiria picta, Melanoplus packardii, and Boopedon gracile&quot;) following winters during a negative phase of the NAO. This is thought to be the first study showing a link between NAO and terrestrial insects in North America.

The NAO&#x27;s ecological effects extend as far as the Tibetan Plateau, where increases in aridity resulting in significant forest mortality and intensification of dust storms have been linked to NAO- events.

== Winter of 2009–10 in Europe ==
The winter of 2009–10 in Europe was unusually cold. It is hypothesized that this may be due to a combination of low solar activity, a warm phase of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and a strong easterly phase of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation all occurring simultaneously. The Met Office reported that the UK, for example, had experienced its coldest winter for 30 years. This coincided with an exceptionally negative phase of the NAO. Analysis published in mid-2010 confirmed that the concurrent &#x27;El Niño&#x27; event and the rare occurrence of an extremely negative NAO were involved.

However, during the winter of 2010–11 in Northern and Western Europe, the Icelandic Low, typically positioned west of Iceland and east of Greenland, appeared regularly to the east of Iceland and so allowed exceptionally cold air into Europe from the Arctic. A strong area of high pressure was initially situated over Greenland, reversing the normal wind pattern in the northwestern Atlantic, creating a blocking pattern driving warm air into northeastern Canada and cold air into Western Europe, as was the case during the previous winter. This occurred during a La Niña season, and is connected to the rare Arctic dipole anomaly.

In the north western part of the Atlantic, both of these winters were mild, especially 2009–2010, which was the warmest recorded in Canada. The winter of 2010-2011 was particularly above normal in the northern Arctic regions of that country.

The probability of cold winters with much snow in Central Europe rises when the Arctic is covered by less sea ice in summer. Scientists of the Potsdam Research Unit of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in the Helmholtz Association have decrypted a mechanism in which a shrinking summertime sea ice cover changes the air pressure zones in the Arctic atmosphere and effects on European winter weather.

If there is a particularly large-scale melt of Arctic sea ice in summer, as observed in recent years, two important effects are intensified. Firstly, the retreat of the light ice surface reveals the darker ocean, causing it to warm up more in summer from the solar radiation (ice–albedo feedback mechanism). Secondly, the diminished ice cover can no longer prevent the heat stored in the ocean being released into the atmosphere (lid effect). As a result of the decreased sea ice cover the air is warmed more greatly than it used to be particularly in autumn and winter because during this period the ocean is warmer than the atmosphere.

The warming of the air near to the ground leads to rising movements and the atmosphere becomes less stable. One of these patterns is the air pressure difference between the Arctic and mid-latitudes: the Arctic oscillation with the Azores highs and Iceland lows known from the weather reports. If this difference is high, a strong westerly wind will result which in winter carries warm and humid Atlantic air masses right down to Europe. In the negative phase when pressure differences are low, cold Arctic air can then easily penetrate southward through Europe without being interrupted by the usual westerlies. Model calculations show that the air pressure difference with decreased sea ice cover in the Arctic summer is weakened in the following winter, enabling Arctic cold to push down to mid-latitudes.

== Winter of 2015–16 in Europe ==
Despite one of the strongest El Niño events recorded in the Pacific Ocean, a largely positive North Atlantic Oscillation prevailed over Europe during the winter of 2015–2016. For example, Cumbria in England registered one of the wettest months on record. The Maltese Islands in the Mediterranean registered one of the driest years ever recorded up to beginning of March, with a national average of only 235 mm and some areas registering less than 200 mm.

<doc id="348879" wikidata="Q379816" url="?curid=348879" title="Oliver Lodge">
<text>Sir Oliver Joseph Lodge (12 June 1851 – 22 August 1940) was an English physicist whose investigations into electromagnetic radiation contributed to the development of radio communication. He identified electromagnetic radiation independent of Heinrich Hertz&#x27;s proof. At his 1894 Royal Institution lectures (&quot;The Work of Hertz and Some of His Successors&quot;), Lodge&#x27;s demonstrations on methods to transmit and detect radio waves included an improved early radio receiver he named the &quot;coherer&quot;. His work led to him holding key patents in early radio communication, his &quot;syntonic&quot; (or tuning) patents. 

Lodge was appointed the assistant professor of applied mathematics at Bedford College, London in 1879, became the chair of physics at the University College Liverpool in 1881, and was the principal of the University of Birmingham from 1900 to 1919.

Lodge was also pioneer of spiritualism. His pseudoscientific research into life after death was a topic on which he wrote many books, including the best-selling &quot;Raymond; or, Life and Death&quot; (1916), which detailed messages he received from a medium, which he believed came from his son who was killed in the First World War.

==Early life ==
Oliver Lodge was born in 1851 at &#x27;The Views&#x27;, Penkhull, a rural village near the Staffordshire Potteries in the northern part of Staffordshire in what is now Stoke-on-Trent, and educated at Adams&#x27; Grammar School, Newport, Shropshire. His parents were Oliver Lodge (1826–1884) – later a ball clay merchant at Wolstanton, Staffordshire – and his wife, Grace, née Heath (1826–1879). Lodge was their first child, and altogether they had eight sons and a daughter. Lodge&#x27;s siblings included Sir Richard Lodge (1855–1936), historian; Eleanor Constance Lodge (1869–1936), historian and principal of Westfield College, London; and Alfred Lodge (1854–1937), mathematician.

When Lodge was 12, the family moved house to Wolstanton. At Moreton House on the southern tip of Wolstanton Marsh, he took over a large outbuilding for his first scientific experiments during the long school holidays.

In 1865, the 14-year-old Lodge left his schooling and joined his father&#x27;s business (Oliver Lodge &amp; Son) as an agent for B. Fayle &amp; Co selling Purbeck blue clay to the pottery manufacturers. This work sometimes entailed him travelling as far as Scotland. He continued to assist his father until he reached the age of 22.

By the aged of 18, Lodge&#x27;s father&#x27;s growing wealth had enabled him to move his family to Chatterley House, Hanley. From there Lodge attended physics lectures in London, and also attended the Wedgwood Institute in nearby Burslem. At Chatterley House, just a mile south of Etruria Hall where Wedgwood had experimented, Lodge&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography&quot; recalled that &quot;something like real experimentation&quot; began for him around 1869. His family moved again in 1875 – this time to the nearby Watlands Hall at the top of Porthill Bank between Middleport and Wolstanton (demolished 1951).

==Academic research==

Lodge obtained a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of London in 1875 and gained the title of Doctor of Science in 1877. At Wolstanton he experimented with producing a wholly new &quot;electromagnetic light&quot; in 1879 and 1880, paving the way for later experimental success. During this time, he also lectured at Bedford College, London. Lodge left the Potteries in 1881 to up take the post of Professor of Physics and Mathematics at the newly founded University College, Liverpool. 
In 1900 Lodge moved from Liverpool back to the Midlands and became the first principal of the new Birmingham University, remaining there until his retirement in 1919. He oversaw the start of the move of the university from Edmund Street in the city centre to its present Edgbaston campus. Lodge was awarded the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society in 1898, and was knighted in the 1902 Coronation Honours, receiving the accolade from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October that year. In 1928 he was made Freeman of his native city, Stoke-on-Trent.

===Electromagnetism and radio===
In 1873 J. C. Maxwell published &quot;A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism&quot;, and by 1876 Lodge was studying it intently. But Lodge was fairly limited in mathematical physics both by aptitude and training, and his first two papers were a description of a mechanism (of beaded strings and pulleys) that could serve to illustrate electrical phenomena such as conduction and polarization. Indeed, Lodge is probably best known for his advocacy and elaboration of Maxwell&#x27;s aether theory – a later deprecated model postulating a wave-bearing medium filling all space. He explained his views on the aether in &quot;&quot;Modern Views of Electricity&quot; (1889) and continued to defend those ideas well into the twentieth century (&quot;Ether and Reality&quot;&quot;, 1925).

As early as 1879, Lodge became interested in generating (and detecting) electromagnetic waves, something Maxwell had never considered. This interest continued throughout the 1880s, but some obstacles slowed Lodge&#x27;s progress. First, he thought in terms of generating light waves with very high frequencies rather than radio waves with their much lower frequencies. Second, his good friend George FitzGerald (on whom Lodge depended for theoretical guidance) assured him (incorrectly) that &quot;ether waves could not be generated electromagnetically.&quot; FitzGerald later corrected his error, but, by 1881, Lodge had assumed a teaching position at University College, Liverpool the demands of which limited his time and his energy for research.

In 1887 the Royal Society of Arts asked Lodge to give a series of lectures on lightning, including why lightning rods and their conducting copper cable sometimes do not work, with lightning strikes following alternate paths, going through (and damaging) structures, instead of being conducted by the cables. Lodge took the opportunity to carry out a scientific investigation, simulating lightning by discharging Leyden jars into a long length of copper wire. Lodge found the charge would take a shorter high resistance route jumping a spark gap, instead of taking a longer low resistance route through a loop of copper wire. Lodge presented these first results, showing what he thought was the effect of inductance on the path lightning would take, in his May 1888 lecture.

In other experiments that spring and summer, Lodge put a series of spark gaps along two 29 meter (95&#x27;) long wires and noticed he was getting a very large spark in the gap near the end of the wires, which seemed to be consistent with the oscillation wavelength produced by the Leyden jar meeting with the wave being reflected at the end of the wire. In a darkened room, he also noted a glow at intervals along the wire at one half wavelength intervals. He took this as evidence that he was generating and detecting Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic waves. While traveling on a vacation to the Tyrolean Alps in July 1888, Lodge read in a copy of &quot;Annalen der Physik&quot; that Heinrich Hertz in Germany had been conducting his own electromagnetic research, and that he had published a series of papers proving the existence of electromagnetic waves and their propagation in free space. Lodge presented his own paper on electromagnetic waves along wires in September 1888 at the British Science Association meeting in Bath, England, adding a postscript acknowledging Hertz&#x27;s work and saying: &quot;The whole subject of electrical radiation seems working itself out splendidly.&quot;

On 1 June 1894, during a Friday Evening Discourse at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, Lodge gave a memorial lecture on the work of Hertz (recently deceased) and the German physicist&#x27;s proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves 6 years earlier. Lodge set up a demonstration on the quasi optical nature of &quot;Hertzian waves&quot; (radio waves) and demonstrated their similarity to light and vision including reflection and transmission. Later in June he repeated his lecture, and on 14 August 1894 at the meeting for the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Oxford University he was able to increase the distance of transmission up to 55 meters (180&#x27;). Lodge used a detector called a &quot;coherer&quot; (invented by Edouard Branly), a glass tube containing metal filings between two electrodes. When the small electrical charge from waves from an antenna were applied to the electrodes, the metal particles would cling together or &quot;&quot; causing the device to become conductive allowing the current from a battery to pass through it. In Lodge&#x27;s setup the slight impulses from the coherer were picked up by a mirror galvanometer which would deflect a beam of light being projected on it, giving a visual signal that the impulse was received. After receiving a signal the metal filings in the coherer were broken apart or &quot;decohered&quot; by a manually operated vibrator or by the vibrations of a bell placed on the table near by that rang every time a transmission was received. Since this was one year before Marconi&#x27;s 1895 demonstration of a system for radio wireless telegraphy and contained many of the basic elements that would be used in Marconi&#x27;s later wireless systems, Lodge&#x27;s lecture became the focus of priority disputes with the Marconi Company a little over a decade later over invention of wireless telegraphy (radio). At the time of the dispute some, including the physicist John Ambrose Fleming, pointed out that Lodge&#x27;s lecture was a physics experiment, not a demonstration of telegraphic signaling. Lodge would later work with Alexander Muirhead on the development of devices specifically for wireless telegraphy.

In January 1898 Lodge presented a paper on &quot;syntonic&quot; tuning which he received a patent for that same year. Syntonic tuning allowed specific frequencies to be used by the transmitter and receiver in a wireless communication system. The Marconi Company had a similar tuning system adding to the priority dispute over the invention of radio. When Lodge&#x27;s syntonic patent was extended in 1911 for another 7 years Marconi agreed to settle the patent dispute, purchasing the syntonic patent in 1912 and giving Lodge an (honorific) position as &quot;scientific adviser&quot;.

===Other works===

In 1886 Lodge developed the moving boundary method for the measurement in solution of an ion transport number, which is the fraction of electric current carried by a given ionic species.

Lodge carried out scientific investigations on the source of the electromotive force in the Voltaic cell, electrolysis, and the application of electricity to the dispersal of fog and smoke. He also made a major contribution to motoring when he patented a form of electric spark ignition for the internal combustion engine (the Lodge Igniter). Later, two of his sons developed his ideas and in 1903 founded Lodge Bros, which eventually became known as Lodge Plugs Ltd. He also made discoveries in the field of wireless transmission. In 1898, Lodge gained a patent on the moving-coil loudspeaker, utilizing a coil connected to a diaphragm, suspended in a strong magnetic field.

In political life, Lodge was an active member of the Fabian Society, and published two Fabian Tracts: &quot;Socialism &amp; Individualism&quot; (1905), and &quot;Public Service versus Private Expenditure&quot;, co-authored with Sidney Webb, George Bernard Shaw and Sidney Ball. They invited him several times to lecture at the London School of Economics.

In 1889 Lodge was appointed President of the Liverpool Physical Society, a position he held until 1893. The society still runs to this day, though under a student body. In 1901, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

Lodge was President of the British Association in 1912–1913. In his 1913 Presidential Address to the Association, he affirmed his belief in the persistence of the human personality after death, the possibility of communicating with disembodied intelligent beings, and the validity of the Aether theory.

==Paranormal investigations==

Lodge is remembered for his studies in psychical research and spiritualism. He began to study psychical phenomena (chiefly telepathy) in the late 1880s, was a member of The Ghost Club, and served as president of the London-based Society for Psychical Research from 1901 to 1903. After his son, Raymond, was killed in World War I in 1915, he visited several mediums and wrote about the experience in a number of books, including the best-selling &quot;Raymond; or, Life and Death&quot; (1916). Lodge was a friend of Arthur Conan Doyle, who also lost a son in World War I and was a Spiritualist.

Lodge was a Christian Spiritualist. In 1909, he published the book &quot;Survival of Man&quot; which expressed his belief that life after death had been demonstrated by mediumship. His most controversial book was &quot;Raymond or Life and Death&quot; (1916). The book documented the séances that he and his wife had attended with the medium Gladys Osborne Leonard. Lodge was convinced that his son Raymond had communicated with him and the book is a description of his son&#x27;s experiences in the spirit world. According to the book Raymond had reported that those who had died were still the same people that they had been on earth before they &quot;passed over&quot;. There were houses, trees and flowers in the Spirit world, which was similar to the earthly realm, although there was no disease. The book also claimed that when soldiers died in World War I they had smoked cigars and received whisky in the spirit world and because of such statements the book was criticised. Walter Cook wrote a rebuttal to Lodge, titled &quot;Reflections on Raymond&quot; (1917), that directly challenged Lodge&#x27;s beliefs in Spiritualism.

Although Lodge was convinced that Leonard&#x27;s spirit control &quot;Feda&quot; had communicated with his son, he admitted a good deal of the information was nonsense and suggested that Feda picked it up from a séance sitter. Philosopher Paul Carus wrote that the &quot;story of Raymond&#x27;s communications rather excels all prior tales of mediumistic lore in the silliness of its revelations. But the saddest part of it consists in the fact that a great scientist, no less a one than Sir Oliver Lodge, has published the book and so stands sponsor for it.&quot;

Scientific work on electromagnetic radiation convinced Lodge that an ether existed and that it filled the entire universe. Lodge came to believe that the spirit world existed in the ether. As a Christian Spiritualist, Lodge had written that the resurrection in the Bible referred to Christ&#x27;s etheric body becoming visible to his disciples after the Crucifixion. By the 1920s the physics of the ether had been undermined by the theory of relativity, however, Lodge still defended his ether theory arguing in &quot;Ether and Reality&quot; that it was not inconsistent with the theory of general relativity. Linked to his belief in Spiritualism, Lodge had also endorsed a theory of spiritual evolution which he promoted in &quot;Man and the Universe&quot; (1908) and &quot;Making of Man&quot; (1924). He lectured on theistic evolution at the Charing Cross Hospital and at Christ Church, Westminster. His lectures were published in a book &quot;Evolution and Creation&quot; (1926).

Historian Janet Oppenheim has noted that Lodge&#x27;s interest in spiritualism &quot;prompted some of his fellow scientists to wonder if his mind, too, had not been wrecked.&quot; In 1913 the biologist Ray Lankester criticized the Spiritualist views of Lodge as unscientific and misleading the public. 

Edward Clodd criticized Lodge as being an incompetent researcher to detect fraud and claimed his Spiritualist beliefs were based on magical thinking and primitive superstition. Charles Arthur Mercier (a leading British psychiatrist) wrote in his book &quot;Spiritualism and Sir Oliver Lodge&quot; (1917) that Lodge had been duped into believing mediumship by trickery and his Spiritualist views were based on assumptions and not scientific evidence. Francis Jones in the &quot;American Journal of Psychology&quot; in a review for Lodge&#x27;s &quot;The Survival of Man&quot; wrote that his psychical claims are not scientific and the book is one-sided as it does not contain research from experimental psychology.

Magician John Booth noted that the stage mentalist David Devant managed to fool a number of people into believing he had genuine psychic ability who did not realize that his feats were magic tricks. At St. George&#x27;s Hall, London he performed a fake &quot;clairvoyant&quot; act where he would read a message sealed inside an envelope. Lodge who was present in the audience was duped by the trick and claimed that Devant had used psychic powers. In 1936, Devant in his book &quot;Secrets of My Magic&quot; revealed the trick method he had used.

Lodge had endorsed a clairvoyant medium known as &quot;Annie Brittain&quot;. However, she made entirely incorrect guesses about a policeman who was disguised as a farmer. She was arrested and convicted for fraudulent fortune telling. Joseph McCabe wrote a skeptical book on the Spiritualist beliefs of Lodge entitled &quot;The Religion of Sir Oliver Lodge&quot; (1914).

==Personal life==

Lodge married Mary Fanny Alexander Marshall at St George&#x27;s Church, Newcastle-under-Lyme in 1877. They had twelve children, six boys and six girls, including Oliver William Foster, Alexander (Alec), Francis Brodie, Lionel and Noel. Four of his sons went into business using Lodge&#x27;s inventions. Brodie and Alec created the Lodge Plug Company, which manufactured spark plugs for cars and aeroplanes. Lionel and Noel founded a company that produced an electrostatic device for cleaning factory and smelter smoke in 1913, called the Lodge Fume Deposit Company Limited (changed in 1919 to Lodge Fume Company Limited and in 1922, through agreement with the International Precipitation Corporation of California, to Lodge Cottrell Ltd). Oliver, the eldest son, became a poet and author.

After his retirement in 1920, Lodge and his wife settled in Normanton House, near Lake in Wiltshire, a few miles from Stonehenge.

==Death==
Lodge died, aged 89, died on 22 August. His wife Mary predeceased him in 1929. They are buried together at the local parish church, St. Michael&#x27;s, Wilsford cum Lake in Wiltshire. Their eldest son Oliver and eldest daughter Violet are also buried at the church.

<doc id="348893" wikidata="Q2460147" url="?curid=348893" title="Tunnel vision">
<text>Tunnel vision is the loss of peripheral vision with retention of central vision, resulting in a constricted circular tunnel-like field of vision.

== Causes ==
Tunnel vision can be caused by:
==Eyeglass users==
Eyeglass users experience tunnel vision to varying degrees due to the corrective lens only providing a small area of proper focus, with the rest of the field of view beyond the lenses being unfocused and blurry. Where a naturally sighted person only needs to move their eyes to see an object far to the side or far down, the eyeglass wearer may need to move their whole head to point the eyeglasses towards the target object.

The eyeglass frame also blocks the view of the world with a thin opaque boundary separating the lens area from the rest of the field of view. The eyeglass frame is capable of obscuring small objects and details in the peripheral field.

==Mask, goggle, and helmet users==


Activities which require a protective mask, safety goggles, or fully enclosing protective helmet can also result in an experience approximating tunnel vision. Underwater diving masks using a single flat transparent lens usually have the lens surface several centimeters from the eyes. The lens is typically enclosed with an opaque black rubber sealing shell to keep out water. For this type of mask the peripheral field of the diver is extremely limited. Generally, the peripheral field of a diving mask is improved if the lenses are as close to the eye as possible, or if the lenses are large, multi-window, or is a curved wrap-around design.

== Optical instruments ==
Binoculars, telescopes, and microscopes induce an experience of extreme tunnel vision due to the design of the optical components.

A wide field microscope or telescope generally requires much larger diameter and thicker lenses, or complex parabolic mirror assemblies, either of which results in significantly greater cost for construction of the optical device.

Wide-field binoculars are possible, but require bulkier, heavier, and more complex eyepieces. The diameter of the objective lenses is unimportant for field of view. The widest-angle eyepieces used in telescopes are so large that two would not fit side-by-side for use in binoculars.

== Tunnel vision in glaucoma ==
Glaucoma is the leading cause for irreversible blindness globally. Glaucoma usually starts with no symptoms to start losing peripheral vision, and if untreated, it can leads to a complete loss of peripheral vision, which is tunnel vision, and eventually, central vision will be affected leading to complete blindness. Central vision refers to the range people see that&#x27;s straight ahead of them, and it&#x27;s characterized with fine details and better ability to detect color. And peripheral vision is the range outside of fixation. The mechanism underlying this procedure starts with an imbalance between aqueous humor secretion and aqueous humor drainage. In the eyes, the ciliary body secrets liquids in the eye, called aqueous humor, after the secretion, the liquid arrives at posterior chamber, which is the space between lens and iris. Then the liquid goes past the pupil to arrive at the anterior chamber, the space between iris and cornea, and eventually goes out of the eye through the connective tissue called trabecular meshwork. In healthy eyes, the drainage and the secretion of aqueous humor is balanced, but in glaucoma, the drainage is either partially or completely blocked, causing an increased pressure in the eye. The excess aqueous humor will eventually push on the optic nerves at the back of the eye. Peripheral vision loss is often the first symptom in the process since the nerves in the surroundings are the first to be damaged. If untreated, a complete loss of peripheral vision, tunnel vision, occurs.

== Daily activities in people with permanent tunnel vision ==

=== Driving ===
Because of constant motion, the visual field of a driver is usually not stable. To monitor changes in our environment, peripheral vision plays a big role in signalling us when it will be safe to change lanes, whether a pedestrian is crossing the street, which direction the car in front is turning, and how fast the car is running. Since drivers have expectations of these possible collisional cues to appear in their peripheral vision, they tend to drive safer when these cues are presented peripherally than at fixation. In patients with glaucoma, they have more difficulties in lane maintenance, scanning and vehicle control. In addition, compared to individuals without field defects, people with impaired peripheral visual require longer search time, more fixations with shorter durations, and more errors while driving, influencing their ability to maintain a steady lane and increasing their risks of collision.

=== Walking ===
Similar to driving, walking requires information from peripheral vision as well. When going up or down a staircase, people tend to use their central vision to mark the shift from a level surface to the stairs, but peripheral vision is usually used for filling in detail about the intermediate steps. When the staircase is following a predictable pattern, e.g., the staircase in school, people can walk up and down successfully with their central vision restricted, and when the staircase is less predictable, e.g., some steps on the trails in the mountain, people need to use their central vision to fixate on each step. For people with tunnel vision, fixating on each step and stairs climbing up or down stairs is necessary, no matter how predictable the staircase is, and this will result in slower speed climbing the stairs and increased risk to fall.

=== Reading ===
Although the fixation is a more important component in one&#x27;s ability to read with visual acuity, patients with tunnel vision loss are associated with impairment in reading performance, resulting in slower reading speed, more errors, and slower progression to the next line. In people with glaucoma, the size of their visual span is limited due to the loss of peripheral vision, and the number of words they can see is also less. When measuring a smaller visual span in the central 10° in the visual field, people with glaucoma on average identified 2.3 less words at one glance than people with healthy eye conditions around the same age. Given reading is a crucial skill to understand one&#x27;s surrounding, e.g., reading directions in the airport, about 60% of patients mentioned reading difficulty as the reason for their referral to the low vision care, and reading problem is a major source of anxiety for Glaucoma patients with slower reading speed, more errors, and slower progression to the next line of text.

=== Scene navigation ===
The parahippocampal place area in the brain is related to scene recognition, and in individuals with normal vision, the processes of recognizing scenes and navigating through them involve distinct cortical neural pathways. The peripheral visual field is associated with magnocellular pathways, processing low spatial frequency information, which encompasses broad details, and the central visual field is linked with parvocellular pathways, responsible for the high spatial frequency information, which captures finer details within a scene. In neuroimaging, peripheral vision is shown to be more important than central vision for categorizing different natural scenes, since the activation of the parahippocampal place area is more significant when scene categorization tasks are shown in the peripheral visual field. In addition, vision is an important part for balancing while interacting with different scenes. Patients with tunnel vision, peripheral vision loss, report implication in postural instability, increasing their chances of falling.

=== Face recognition ===
Occipital lobe is the area in mammal&#x27;s brains responsible for processing visual inputs. Specifically, the ventral occipital temporal cortex is responsible for face recognition. Although central vision loss is linked with impaired face recognition ability, and little research has focused on face recognition in peripheral vision, a review article mentioned increases in activity in the ventral occipital temporal cortex on fMRI when a facial image is presented in the ipsilateral peripheral visual field, indicating the peripheral vision may play a more important role in face recognition than previously believed. Furthermore, studies examined that Glaucoma patients, who have peripheral vision loss, need shorter distance to recognize faces and gender. Individuals with good central vision but peripheral vision loss performed worse in the Cambridge face memory test, which tests face recognition ability, than control, and they reported more problems in face recognition in a self-report.

<text>The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK; also commonly known, especially when referenced historically, as the Left Kuomintang or Left Guomindang), commonly abbreviated in Chinese as Minge (), is one of the eight minor political parties in the People&#x27;s Republic of China under the direction of the Chinese Communist Party.

It was founded in January 1948, during the height of the Chinese Civil War, by members of the left-wing of the Kuomintang (KMT), especially those who were against Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s policies. The first chairman of the party was General Li Jishen, a senior Nationalist military commander who had many disputes with Chiang over the years, while Soong Ching-ling (the widow of Sun Yat-sen) was named Honorary Chairwoman. Other early leading members were Wang Kunlun, Cheng Qian, He Xiangning and Tao Zhiyue. The party claims to be the true heir of Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s legacy and his Three Principles of the People. In December 2022, the party had around 158,000 members. Its membership mostly consists of people with historical ties to the KMT and Taiwan.

Among the official political parties of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Revolutionary Committee is officially ranked second after the CCP, being the first-ranking minor party. It also owns numerous assets, some formerly owned by the Kuomintang, throughout mainland China. The Revolutionary Committee operates a range of party-owned institutions, such as party schools. The RCCK currently has 41 seats in the National People&#x27;s Congress, 6 seats in the NPC Standing Committee and 65 seats in the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference. Its current chairman is Zheng Jianbang.

== History ==
After the end of World War II, the relationship between the Kuomintang and the CPC, who had allied to fight the Japanese, became increasingly tense; ultimately, both sides restarted the civil war, which World War II had interrupted. In 1945 and 1946, members of the Kuomintang&#x27;s left formed the Three Principles of the People Confederation of Comrades and the Kuomintang Democratic Promotion Association in Chongqing and Guangzhou, respectively.

In November 1947, the first joint representative meeting of the Kuomintang left was held in Hong Kong; on 1 January 1948, the meeting announced the official establishment of the &quot;Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee&quot;, and nominated Soong Ching-ling, the widow of Sun Yat-sen, as the Honorary Chairwoman of the Revolutionary Committee (despite Soong Ching-ling never formally joining the commission).

Chairman Li Jishen, He Xiangning, and Feng Yuxiang were selected as the central leadership of the organization. In 1949, Li Jishen and other representatives of the RCCK were invited by the CPC to participate in Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===

After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in October 1949, members of the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee maintained positions in the municipal and central governments.

In November 1949, the second congress of the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee was held in Beijing. At the second congress, the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, Chinese Nationalist Democratic Promotion Association, the Comrades of the Three Peoples Principles, and other members of the Kuomintang&#x27;s left wing agreed to merge and form the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.

Soong Ching-ling served as the Vice Chairwoman of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Honorary Chairwoman of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Li Jishen served as Vice Chairman of the Central People&#x27;s Government and Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission.

Today, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang focuses on improving relations with the Kuomintang on Taiwan, and its membership mainly consists of the descendants of Kuomintang revolutionaries. It recruits members with current ties to Taiwan who support Chinese unification.

== Organization ==

The RCCK is one of the eight minor parties under the leadership of the CCP. The highest body of the RCCK officially is the National Congress, which is held every five years. The 14th National Congress, held in December 2022, was the most recently held Party Congress. The National Congress elects the Central Committee of the RCCK.

According to its constitution, the RCCK is officially committed to socialism with Chinese characteristics and upholding the leadership of the CPC. Among the official political parties of the PRC, the Revolutionary Committee is officially ranked second after the CCP, being the first-ranking minor party.

=== Central Committee ===
The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is the highest body of the RCCK between National Congresses. It has six working departments:

* General Office
* Organization Department
* Propaganda Department
* Liaison Department
* Social Services Department
* Research Department.

The Central Committee additionally owns the newspapers &quot;Unity Daily&quot; () and &quot;Unity&quot; (). The Central Committee is headed by a chairperson, who is assisted by several vice chairpersons. The current leaders of the RCCK are:

==== RCCK Central Committee Chairman ====

* Zheng Jianbang, also a vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress

==== RCCK Central Committee Vice Chairpersons ====

* He Baoxiang (First-ranking)
* Liu Jiaqiang

<text>In materials science, fatigue is the initiation and propagation of cracks in a material due to cyclic loading. Once a fatigue crack has initiated, it grows a small amount with each loading cycle, typically producing striations on some parts of the fracture surface. The crack will continue to grow until it reaches a critical size, which occurs when the stress intensity factor of the crack exceeds the fracture toughness of the material, producing rapid propagation and typically complete fracture of the structure.

Fatigue has traditionally been associated with the failure of metal components which led to the term metal fatigue. In the nineteenth century, the sudden failing of metal railway axles was thought to be caused by the metal &quot;crystallising&quot; because of the brittle appearance of the fracture surface, but this has since been disproved. Most materials, such as composites, plastics and ceramics, seem to experience some sort of fatigue-related failure.

To aid in predicting the fatigue life of a component, fatigue tests are carried out using coupons to measure the rate of crack growth by applying constant amplitude cyclic loading and averaging the measured growth of a crack over thousands of cycles. However, there are also a number of special cases that need to be considered where the rate of crack growth is significantly different compared to that obtained from constant amplitude testing, such as the reduced rate of growth that occurs for small loads near the &quot;threshold&quot; or after the application of an &quot;overload&quot;, and the increased rate of crack growth associated with &quot;short cracks&quot; or after the application of an &quot;underload&quot;.

If the loads are above a certain threshold, microscopic cracks will begin to &quot;initiate&quot; at stress concentrations such as holes, persistent slip bands (PSBs), composite interfaces or grain boundaries in metals. The stress values that cause fatigue damage are typically much less than the yield strength of the material.

==Stages of fatigue==
Historically, fatigue has been separated into regions of &quot;high cycle fatigue&quot; that require more than 104 cycles to failure where stress is low and primarily elastic and low cycle fatigue where there is significant plasticity. Experiments have shown that low cycle fatigue is also crack growth.

Fatigue failures, both for high and low cycles, all follow the same basic steps: crack initiation, crack growth stages I and II, and finally ultimate failure. To begin the process, cracks must nucleate within a material. This process can occur either at stress risers in metallic samples or at areas with a high void density in polymer samples. These cracks propagate slowly at first during &quot;stage I&quot; crack growth along crystallographic planes, where shear stresses are highest. Once the cracks reach a critical size they propagate quickly during &quot;stage II&quot; crack growth in a direction perpendicular to the applied force. These cracks can eventually lead to the ultimate failure of the material, often in a brittle catastrophic fashion.

===Crack initiation===
The formation of initial cracks preceding fatigue failure is a separate process consisting of four discrete steps in metallic samples. The material will develop cell structures and harden in response to the applied load. This causes the amplitude of the applied stress to increase given the new restraints on strain. These newly formed cell structures will eventually break down with the formation of persistent slip bands (PSBs). Slip in the material is localized at these PSBs, and the exaggerated slip can now serve as a stress concentrator for a crack to form. Nucleation and growth of a crack to a detectable size accounts for most of the cracking process. It is for this reason that cyclic fatigue failures seem to occur so suddenly where the bulk of the changes in the material are not visible without destructive testing. Even in normally ductile materials, fatigue failures will resemble sudden brittle failures.

PSB-induced slip planes result in intrusions and extrusions along the surface of a material, often occurring in pairs. This slip is not a microstructural change within the material, but rather a propagation of dislocations within the material. Instead of a smooth interface, the intrusions and extrusions will cause the surface of the material to resemble the edge of a deck of cards, where not all cards are perfectly aligned. Slip-induced intrusions and extrusions create extremely fine surface structures on the material. With surface structure size inversely related to stress concentration factors, PSB-induced surface slip can cause fractures to initiate.

These steps can also be bypassed entirely if the cracks form at a pre-existing stress concentrator such as from an inclusion in the material or from a geometric stress concentrator caused by a sharp internal corner or fillet.

===Crack growth===

Most of the fatigue life is generally consumed in the crack growth phase. The rate of growth is primarily driven by the range of cyclic loading although additional factors such as mean stress, environment, overloads and underloads can also affect the rate of growth. Crack growth may stop if the loads are small enough to fall below a critical threshold.

Fatigue cracks can grow from material or manufacturing defects from as small as 10 μm.

When the rate of growth becomes large enough, fatigue striations can be seen on the fracture surface. Striations mark the position of the crack tip and the width of each striation represents the growth from one loading cycle. Striations are a result of plasticity at the crack tip.

When the stress intensity exceeds a critical value known as the fracture toughness, unsustainable &quot;fast fracture&quot; will occur, usually by a process of microvoid coalescence. Prior to final fracture, the fracture surface may contain a mixture of areas of fatigue and fast fracture.

==== Acceleration and retardation ====
The following effects change the rate of growth:
* Mean stress effect: Higher mean stress increases the rate of crack growth.
* Environment: Increased moisture increases the rate of crack growth. In the case of aluminium, cracks generally grow from the surface, where water vapour from the atmosphere is able to reach the tip of the crack and dissociate into atomic hydrogen which causes hydrogen embrittlement. Cracks growing internally are isolated from the atmosphere and grow in a vacuum where the rate of growth is typically an order of magnitude slower than a surface crack.
* Short crack effect: In 1975, Pearson observed that short cracks grow faster than expected. Possible reasons for the short crack effect include the presence of the T-stress, the tri-axial stress state at the crack tip, the lack of crack closure associated with short cracks and the large plastic zone in comparison to the crack length. In addition, long cracks typically experience a threshold which short cracks do not have. There are a number of criteria for short cracks:
** cracks are typically smaller than 1 mm,
** cracks are smaller than the material microstructure size such as the grain size, or
** crack length is small compared to the plastic zone.
* Underloads: Small numbers of underloads increase the rate of growth and may counteract the effect of overloads.
* Overloads: Initially overloads (&gt; 1.5 the maximum load in a sequence) lead to a small increase in the rate of growth followed by a long reduction in the rate of growth.

==Characteristics of fatigue==
* In metal alloys, and for the simplifying case when there are no macroscopic or microscopic discontinuities, the process starts with dislocation movements at the microscopic level, which eventually form persistent slip bands that become the nucleus of short cracks.
* Macroscopic and microscopic discontinuities (at the crystalline grain scale) as well as component design features which cause stress concentrations (holes, keyways, sharp changes of load direction etc.) are common locations at which the fatigue process begins.
* Fatigue is a process that has a degree of randomness (stochastic), often showing considerable scatter even in seemingly identical samples in well controlled environments.
* Fatigue is usually associated with tensile stresses but fatigue cracks have been reported due to compressive loads.
* The greater the applied stress range, the shorter the life.
* Fatigue life scatter tends to increase for longer fatigue lives.
* Damage is irreversible. Materials do not recover when rested.
* Fatigue life is influenced by a variety of factors, such as temperature, surface finish, metallurgical microstructure, presence of oxidizing or inert chemicals, residual stresses, scuffing contact (fretting), etc.
* Some materials (e.g., some steel and titanium alloys) exhibit a theoretical fatigue limit below which continued loading does not lead to fatigue failure.
* High cycle fatigue strength (about 104 to 108 cycles) can be described by stress-based parameters. A load-controlled servo-hydraulic test rig is commonly used in these tests, with frequencies of around 20–50 Hz. Other sorts of machines—like resonant magnetic machines—can also be used, to achieve frequencies up to 250 Hz.
* Low-cycle fatigue (loading that typically causes failure in less than 104 cycles) is associated with localized plastic behavior in metals; thus, a strain-based parameter should be used for fatigue life prediction in metals. Testing is conducted with constant strain amplitudes typically at 0.01–5 Hz.

==Timeline of research history==
* 1837: Wilhelm Albert publishes the first article on fatigue. He devised a test machine for conveyor chains used in the Clausthal mines.
* 1839: Jean-Victor Poncelet describes metals as being &#x27;tired&#x27; in his lectures at the military school at Metz.
* 1842: William John Macquorn Rankine recognises the importance of stress concentrations in his investigation of railroad axle failures. The Versailles train wreck was caused by fatigue failure of a locomotive axle.
* 1843: Joseph Glynn reports on the fatigue of an axle on a locomotive tender. He identifies the keyway as the crack origin.
* 1848: The Railway Inspectorate reports one of the first tyre failures, probably from a rivet hole in tread of railway carriage wheel. It was likely a fatigue failure.
* 1849: Eaton Hodgkinson is granted a &quot;small sum of money&quot; to report to the UK Parliament on his work in &quot;ascertaining by direct experiment, the effects of continued changes of load upon iron structures and to what extent they could be loaded without danger to their ultimate security&quot;.
* 1854: F. Braithwaite reports on common service fatigue failures and coins the term &quot;fatigue&quot;.
* 1860: Systematic fatigue testing undertaken by Sir William Fairbairn and August Wöhler.
* 1870: A. Wöhler summarises his work on railroad axles. He concludes that cyclic stress range is more important than peak stress and introduces the concept of &quot;endurance limit&quot;.
* 1903: Sir James Alfred Ewing demonstrates the origin of fatigue failure in microscopic cracks.
* 1910: O. H. Basquin proposes a log-log relationship for S-N curves, using Wöhler&#x27;s test data.
* 1940: Sidney M. Cadwell publishes first rigorous study of fatigue in rubber.
* 1945: A. M. Miner popularises Palmgren&#x27;s (1924) linear damage hypothesis as a practical design tool.
* 1952: W. Weibull An S-N curve model.
* 1954: The world&#x27;s first commercial jetliner, the de Havilland Comet, suffers disaster as three planes break up in mid-air, causing de Havilland and all other manufacturers to redesign high altitude aircraft and in particular replace square apertures like windows with oval ones.
* 1954: L. F. Coffin and S. S. Manson explain fatigue crack-growth in terms of plastic strain in the tip of cracks.
* 1961: P. C. Paris proposes methods for predicting the rate of growth of individual fatigue cracks in the face of initial scepticism and popular defence of Miner&#x27;s phenomenological approach.
* 1968: Tatsuo Endo and M. Matsuishi devise the rainflow-counting algorithm and enable the reliable application of Miner&#x27;s rule to random loadings.
* 1970: Smith, Watson, and Topper developed a mean stress correction model, where the fatigue damage in a cycle is determined by the product of the maximum stress and strain amplitude.
* 1970: W. Elber elucidates the mechanisms and importance of crack closure in slowing the growth of a fatigue crack due to the wedging effect of plastic deformation left behind the tip of the crack.
* 1973: M. W. Brown and K. J. Miller observe that fatigue life under multiaxial conditions is governed by the experience of the plane receiving the most damage, and that both tension and shear loads on the critical plane must be considered.

==Predicting fatigue life==
The American Society for Testing and Materials defines &quot;fatigue life&quot;, &quot;Nf&quot;, as the number of stress cycles of a specified character that a specimen sustains before failure of a specified nature occurs. For some materials, notably steel and titanium, there is a theoretical value for stress amplitude below which the material will not fail for any number of cycles, called a fatigue limit or endurance limit. However, in practice, several bodies of work done at greater numbers of cycles suggest that fatigue limits do not exist for any metals.

Engineers have used a number of methods to determine the fatigue life of a material:
# the stress-life method, 
# the strain-life method, 
# the crack growth method and 
# probabilistic methods, which can be based on either life or crack growth methods.

Whether using stress/strain-life approach or using crack growth approach, complex or variable amplitude loading is reduced to a series of fatigue equivalent simple cyclic loadings using a technique such as the rainflow-counting algorithm.

=== Stress-life and strain-life methods ===
A mechanical part is often exposed to a complex, often random, sequence of loads, large and small. In order to assess the safe life of such a part using the fatigue damage or stress/strain-life methods the following series of steps is usually performed:
# Complex loading is reduced to a series of simple cyclic loadings using a technique such as rainflow analysis;
# A histogram of cyclic stress is created from the rainflow analysis to form a fatigue damage spectrum;
# For each stress level, the degree of cumulative damage is calculated from the S-N curve; and
# The effect of the individual contributions are combined using an algorithm such as &quot;Miner&#x27;s rule&quot;.

Since S-N curves are typically generated for &quot;uniaxial&quot; loading, some equivalence rule is needed whenever the loading is multiaxial. For simple, proportional loading histories (lateral load in a constant ratio with the axial), Sines rule may be applied. For more complex situations, such as non-proportional loading, critical plane analysis must be applied.

==== Miner&#x27;s rule ====
In 1945, Milton A. Miner popularised a rule that had first been proposed by Arvid Palmgren in 1924. The rule, variously called &quot;Miner&#x27;s rule&quot; or the &quot;Palmgren–Miner linear damage hypothesis&quot;, states that where there are &quot;k&quot; different stress magnitudes in a spectrum, &quot;Si&quot; (1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;k&quot;), each contributing &quot;ni&quot;(&quot;Si&quot;) cycles, then if &quot;Ni&quot;(&quot;Si&quot;) is the number of cycles to failure of a constant stress reversal &quot;Si&quot; (determined by uni-axial fatigue tests), failure occurs when:
:formula_1

Usually, for design purposes, C is assumed to be 1. This can be thought of as assessing what proportion of life is consumed by a linear combination of stress reversals at varying magnitudes.

Although Miner&#x27;s rule may be a useful approximation in many circumstances, it has several major limitations:
#It fails to recognize the probabilistic nature of fatigue and there is no simple way to relate life predicted by the rule with the characteristics of a probability distribution. Industry analysts often use design curves, adjusted to account for scatter, to calculate &quot;Ni&quot;(&quot;Si&quot;).
#The sequence in which high vs. low stress cycles are applied to a sample in fact affect the fatigue life, for which Miner&#x27;s Rule does not account. In some circumstances, cycles of low stress followed by high stress cause more damage than would be predicted by the rule. It does not consider the effect of an overload or high stress which may result in a compressive residual stress that may retard crack growth. High stress followed by low stress may have less damage due to the presence of compressive residual stress (or localized plastic damages around crack tip).

==== Stress-life (S-N) method ====
Materials fatigue performance is commonly characterized by an &quot;S-N curve&quot;, also known as a &quot;Wöhler curve&quot;. This is often plotted with the cyclic stress (&quot;S&quot;) against the cycles to failure (&quot;N&quot;) on a logarithmic scale. S-N curves are derived from tests on samples of the material to be characterized (often called coupons or specimens) where a regular sinusoidal stress is applied by a testing machine which also counts the number of cycles to failure. This process is sometimes known as &quot;coupon testing&quot;. For greater accuracy but lower generality component testing is used. Each coupon or component test generates a point on the plot though in some cases there is a &quot;runout&quot; where the time to failure exceeds that available for the test (see censoring). Analysis of fatigue data requires techniques from statistics, especially survival analysis and linear regression.

The progression of the &quot;S-N curve&quot; can be influenced by many factors such as stress ratio (mean stress), loading frequency, temperature, corrosion, residual stresses, and the presence of notches. A constant fatigue life (CFL) diagram is useful for the study of stress ratio effect. The Goodman line is a method used to estimate the influence of the mean stress on the fatigue strength.

A Constant Fatigue Life (CFL) diagram is useful for stress ratio effect on S-N curve. Also, in the presence of a steady stress superimposed on the cyclic loading, the Goodman relation can be used to estimate a failure condition. It plots stress amplitude against mean stress with the fatigue limit and the ultimate tensile strength of the material as the two extremes. Alternative failure criteria include Soderberg and Gerber.

As coupons sampled from a homogeneous frame will display a variation in their number of cycles to failure, the S-N curve should more properly be a Stress-Cycle-Probability (S-N-P) curve to capture the probability of failure after a given number of cycles of a certain stress.

With body-centered cubic materials (bcc), the Wöhler curve often becomes a horizontal line with decreasing stress amplitude, i.e. there is a &quot;fatigue strength&quot; that can be assigned to these materials. With face-centered cubic metals (fcc), the Wöhler curve generally drops continuously, so that only a &quot;fatigue limit&quot; can be assigned to these materials.

==== Strain-life (ε-N) method ====
When strains are no longer elastic, such as in the presence of stress concentrations, the total strain can be used instead of stress as a similitude parameter. This is known as the strain-life method. The total strain amplitude formula_2 is the sum of the elastic strain amplitude formula_3 and the plastic strain amplitude formula_4 and is given by
:: formula_5.

Basquin&#x27;s equation for the elastic strain amplitude is
::formula_6
where formula_7 is Young&#x27;s modulus.

The relation for high cycle fatigue can be expressed using the elastic strain amplitude
:: formula_8
where formula_9 is a parameter that scales with tensile strength obtained by fitting experimental data, formula_10 is the number of cycles to failure and formula_11 is the slope of the log-log curve again determined by curve fitting.

In 1954, Coffin and Manson proposed that the fatigue life of a component was related to the plastic strain amplitude using
:: formula_12.

Combining the elastic and plastic portions gives the total strain amplitude accounting for both low and high cycle fatigue
:: formula_13.
where formula_14 is the fatigue strength coefficient, formula_11 is the fatigue strength exponent, formula_16 is the fatigue ductility coefficient, formula_17 is the fatigue ductility exponent, and formula_18 is the number of cycles to failure (formula_19 being the number of reversals to failure).

=== Crack growth methods ===
An estimate of the fatigue life of a component can be made using a crack growth equation by summing up the width of each increment of crack growth for each loading cycle. Safety or scatter factors are applied to the calculated life to account for any uncertainty and variability associated with fatigue. The rate of growth used in crack growth predictions is typically measured by applying thousands of constant amplitude cycles to a coupon and measuring the rate of growth from the change in compliance of the coupon or by measuring the growth of the crack on the surface of the coupon. Standard methods for measuring the rate of growth have been developed by ASTM International.

Crack growth equations such as the Paris–Erdoğan equation are used to predict the life of a component. They can be used to predict the growth of a crack from 10 um to failure. For normal manufacturing finishes this may cover most of the fatigue life of a component where growth can start from the first cycle. The conditions at the crack tip of a component are usually related to the conditions of test coupon using a characterising parameter such as the stress intensity, J-integral or crack tip opening displacement. All these techniques aim to match the crack tip conditions on the component to that of test coupons which give the rate of crack growth.

Additional models may be necessary to include retardation and acceleration effects associated with overloads or underloads in the loading sequence. In addition, small crack growth data may be needed to match the increased rate of growth seen with small cracks.

Typically, a cycle counting technique such as rainflow-cycle counting is used to extract the cycles from a complex sequence. This technique, along with others, has been shown to work with crack growth methods.

Crack growth methods have the advantage that they can predict the intermediate size of cracks. This information can be used to schedule inspections on a structure to ensure safety whereas strain/life methods only give a life until failure.

== Dealing with fatigue ==
=== Design ===
Dependable design against fatigue-failure requires thorough education and supervised experience in structural engineering, mechanical engineering, or materials science. There are at least five principal approaches to life assurance for mechanical parts that display increasing degrees of sophistication:
# Design to keep stress below threshold of fatigue limit (infinite lifetime concept);
# Fail-safe, graceful degradation, and fault-tolerant design: Instruct the user to replace parts when they fail. Design in such a way that there is no single point of failure, and so that when any one part completely fails, it does not lead to catastrophic failure of the entire system.
#Safe-life design: Design (conservatively) for a fixed life after which the user is instructed to replace the part with a new one (a so-called &quot;lifed&quot; part, finite lifetime concept, or &quot;safe-life&quot; design practice); planned obsolescence and disposable product are variants that design for a fixed life after which the user is instructed to replace the entire device;
# Damage tolerance: Is an approach that ensures aircraft safety by assuming the presence of cracks or defects even in new aircraft. Crack growth calculations, periodic inspections and component repair or replacement can be used to ensure critical components that may contain cracks, remain safe. Inspections usually use nondestructive testing to limit or monitor the size of possible cracks and require an accurate prediction of the rate of crack-growth between inspections. The designer sets some aircraft maintenance checks schedule frequent enough that parts are replaced while the crack is still in the &quot;slow growth&quot; phase. This is often referred to as damage tolerant design or &quot;retirement-for-cause&quot;.
# Risk Management: Ensures the probability of failure remains below an acceptable level. This approach is typically used for aircraft where acceptable levels may be based on probability of failure during a single flight or taken over the lifetime of an aircraft. A component is assumed to have a crack with a probability distribution of crack sizes. This approach can consider variability in values such as crack growth rates, usage and critical crack size. It is also useful for considering damage at multiple locations that may interact to produce &quot;multi-site&quot; or widespread fatigue damage. Probability distributions that are common in data analysis and in design against fatigue include the log-normal distribution, extreme value distribution, Birnbaum–Saunders distribution, and Weibull distribution.

=== Testing ===
Fatigue testing can be used for components such as a coupon or a &quot;full-scale test article&quot; to determine:
# the rate of crack growth and fatigue life of components such as a coupon or a full-scale test article.
# location of critical regions
# degree of fail-safety when part of the structure fails
# the origin and cause of the crack initiating defect from fractographic examination of the crack.

These tests may form part of the certification process such as for airworthiness certification.

=== Repair ===
# Stop drill Fatigue cracks that have begun to propagate can sometimes be stopped by drilling holes, called &quot;drill stops&quot;, at the tip of the crack. The possibility remains of a new crack starting in the side of the hole. 
# Blend. Small cracks can be blended away and the surface cold worked or shot peened.
# Oversize holes. Holes with cracks growing from them can be drilled out to a larger hole to remove cracking and bushed to restore the original hole. Bushes can be cold shrink Interference fit bushes to induce beneficial compressive residual stresses. The oversized hole can also be cold worked by drawing an oversized mandrel through the hole.
# Patch. Cracks may be repaired by installing a patch or repair fitting. Composite patches have been used to restore the strength of aircraft wings after cracks have been detected or to lower the stress prior to cracking in order to improve the fatigue life. Patches may restrict the ability to monitor fatigue cracks and may need to be removed and replaced for inspections.

=== Life improvement ===
# Change material. Changes in the materials used in parts can also improve fatigue life. For example, parts can be made from better fatigue rated metals. Complete replacement and redesign of parts can also reduce if not eliminate fatigue problems. Thus helicopter rotor blades and propellers in metal are being replaced by composite equivalents. They are not only lighter, but also much more resistant to fatigue. They are more expensive, but the extra cost is amply repaid by their greater integrity, since loss of a rotor blade usually leads to total loss of the aircraft. A similar argument has been made for replacement of metal fuselages, wings and tails of aircraft.
# Induce residual stresses Peening a surface can reduce such tensile stresses and create compressive residual stress, which prevents crack initiation. Forms of peening include: shot peening, using high-speed projectiles, high-frequency impact treatment (also called high-frequency mechanical impact) using a mechanical hammer, and laser peening which uses high-energy laser pulses. Low plasticity burnishing can also be used to induce compresses stress in fillets and cold work mandrels can be used for holes. Increases in fatigue life and strength are proportionally related to the depth of the compressive residual stresses imparted. Shot peening imparts compressive residual stresses approximately 0.005 inches (0.1 mm) deep, while laser peening can go 0.040 to 0.100 inches (1 to 2.5 mm) deep, or deeper.
# Deep cryogenic treatment. The use of Deep Cryogenic treatment has been shown to increase resistance to fatigue failure. Springs used in industry, auto racing and firearms have been shown to last up to six times longer when treated. Heat checking, which is a form of thermal cyclic fatigue has been greatly delayed.
# Re-profiling. Changing the shape of a stress concentration such as a hole or cutout may be used to extend the life of a component. Shape optimisation using numerical optimisation algorithms have been used to lower the stress concentration in wings and increase their life.

== Fatigue of composites ==
Composite materials can offer excellent resistance to fatigue loading. In general, composites exhibit good fracture toughness and, unlike metals, increase fracture toughness with increasing strength. The critical damage size in composites is also greater than that for metals.

The primary mode of damage in a metal structure is cracking. For metal, cracks propagate in a relatively well-defined manner with respect to the applied stress, and the critical crack size and rate of crack propagation can be related to specimen data through analytical fracture mechanics. However, with composite structures, there is no single damage mode which dominates. Matrix cracking, delamination, debonding, voids, fiber fracture, and composite cracking can all occur separately and in combination, and the predominance of one or more is highly dependent on the laminate orientations and loading conditions. In addition, the unique joints and attachments used for composite structures often introduce modes of failure different from those typified by the laminate itself.

The composite damage propagates in a less regular manner and damage modes can change. Experience with composites indicates that the rate of damage propagation in does not exhibit the two distinct regions of initiation and propagation like metals. The crack initiation range in metals is propagation, and there is a significant quantitative difference in rate while the difference appears to be less apparent with composites. Fatigue cracks of composites may form in the matrix and propagate slowly since the matrix carries such a small fraction of the applied stress. And the fibers in the wake of the crack experience fatigue damage. In many cases, the damage rate is accelerated by deleterious interactions with the environment like oxidation or corrosion of fibers.

==Notable fatigue failures==

===Versailles train crash===


Following the King Louis-Philippe I&#x27;s celebrations at the Palace of Versailles, a train returning to Paris crashed in May 1842 at Meudon after the leading locomotive broke an axle. The carriages behind piled into the wrecked engines and caught fire. At least 55 passengers were killed trapped in the locked carriages, including the explorer Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville. This accident is known in France as the . The accident was witnessed by the British locomotive engineer Joseph Locke and widely reported in Britain. It was discussed extensively by engineers, who sought an explanation.

The derailment had been the result of a broken locomotive axle. Rankine&#x27;s investigation of broken axles in Britain highlighted the importance of stress concentration, and the mechanism of crack growth with repeated loading. His and other papers suggesting a crack growth mechanism through repeated stressing, however, were ignored, and fatigue failures occurred at an ever-increasing rate on the expanding railway system. Other spurious theories seemed to be more acceptable, such as the idea that the metal had somehow &quot;crystallized&quot;. The notion was based on the crystalline appearance of the fast fracture region of the crack surface, but ignored the fact that the metal was already highly crystalline.

===de Havilland Comet===

Two de Havilland Comet passenger jets broke up in mid-air and crashed within a few months of each other in 1954. As a result, systematic tests were conducted on a fuselage immersed and pressurised in a water tank. After the equivalent of 3,000 flights, investigators at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) were able to conclude that the crash had been due to failure of the pressure cabin at the forward Automatic Direction Finder window in the roof. This &#x27;window&#x27; was in fact one of two apertures for the aerials of an electronic navigation system in which opaque fibreglass panels took the place of the window &#x27;glass&#x27;. The failure was a result of metal fatigue caused by the repeated pressurisation and de-pressurisation of the aircraft cabin. Also, the supports around the windows were riveted, not bonded, as the original specifications for the aircraft had called for. The problem was exacerbated by the punch rivet construction technique employed. Unlike drill riveting, the imperfect nature of the hole created by punch riveting caused manufacturing defect cracks which may have caused the start of fatigue cracks around the rivet.

The Comet&#x27;s pressure cabin had been designed to a safety factor comfortably in excess of that required by British Civil Airworthiness Requirements (2.5 times the cabin proof test pressure as opposed to the requirement of 1.33 times and an ultimate load of 2.0 times the cabin pressure) and the accident caused a revision in the estimates of the safe loading strength requirements of airliner pressure cabins.

In addition, it was discovered that the stresses around pressure cabin apertures were considerably higher than had been anticipated, especially around sharp-cornered cut-outs, such as windows. As a result, all future jet airliners would feature windows with rounded corners, greatly reducing the stress concentration. This was a noticeable distinguishing feature of all later models of the Comet. Investigators from the RAE told a public inquiry that the sharp corners near the Comets&#x27; window openings acted as initiation sites for cracks. The skin of the aircraft was also too thin, and cracks from manufacturing stresses were present at the corners.

===&quot;Alexander L. Kielland&quot; oil platform capsizing===
&quot;Alexander L. Kielland&quot; was a Norwegian semi-submersible drilling rig that capsized whilst working in the Ekofisk oil field in March 1980, killing 123 people. The capsizing was the worst disaster in Norwegian waters since World War II. The rig, located approximately 320 km east of Dundee, Scotland, was owned by the Stavanger Drilling Company of Norway and was on hire to the United States company Phillips Petroleum at the time of the disaster. In driving rain and mist, early in the evening of 27 March 1980 more than 200 men were off duty in the accommodation on &quot;Alexander L. Kielland&quot;. The wind was gusting to 40 knots with waves up to 12 m high. The rig had just been winched away from the &quot;Edda&quot; production platform. Minutes before 18:30 those on board felt a &#x27;sharp crack&#x27; followed by &#x27;some kind of trembling&#x27;. Suddenly the rig heeled over 30° and then stabilised. Five of the six anchor cables had broken, with one remaining cable preventing the rig from capsizing. The list continued to increase and at 18:53 the remaining anchor cable snapped and the rig turned upside down.

A year later in March 1981, the investigative report concluded that the rig collapsed owing to a fatigue crack in one of its six bracings (bracing D-6), which connected the collapsed D-leg to the rest of the rig. This was traced to a small 6 mm fillet weld which joined a non-load-bearing flange plate to this D-6 bracing. This flange plate held a sonar device used during drilling operations. The poor profile of the fillet weld contributed to a reduction in its fatigue strength. Further, the investigation found considerable amounts of lamellar tearing in the flange plate and cold cracks in the butt weld. Cold cracks in the welds, increased stress concentrations due to the weakened flange plate, the poor weld profile, and cyclical stresses (which would be common in the North Sea), seemed to collectively play a role in the rig&#x27;s collapse.

<text>The 2004 Tour de France was a multiple stage bicycle race held from 3 to 25 July, and the 91st edition of the Tour de France. It has no overall winner—although American cyclist Lance Armstrong originally won the event, the United States Anti-Doping Agency announced in August 2012 that they had disqualified Armstrong from all his results since 1998, including his seven Tour de France wins from 1999 to 2005; the Union Cycliste Internationale confirmed the result.

The event consisted of 20 stages over . Armstrong had been favored to win, his competitors seen as being German Jan Ullrich, Spaniards Roberto Heras and Iban Mayo, and fellow Americans Levi Leipheimer and Tyler Hamilton. A major surprise in the Tour was the performance of French newcomer Thomas Voeckler, who unexpectedly won the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification in the fifth stage and held onto it for ten stages before finally losing it to Armstrong.

This Tour saw the mistreatment of Filippo Simeoni by Armstrong on Stage 18.

The route of the 2004 Tour was remarkable. With two individual time trials scheduled in the last week, one of them the climb of Alpe d&#x27;Huez, the directors were hoping for a close race until the end. For the first time in years, the mountains of the Massif Central made an appearance.

==Teams==

The first 14 teams in the UCI Road World Rankings at 31 January 2004 were automatically invited. Initially the organisers had an option for a 22nd team, which would be Kelme, but after Jesús Manzano exposed doping use in that team, Kelme was not invited, and the race started with 21 teams of nine cyclists.

The teams entering the race were:

==Route and stages==

The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col de la Madeleine mountain pass on stage 17.

==Race overview==
During this Tour de France the men who were delivering the drugs to riders had names like Alibaba, Asterix, Obelix and Motoman.

Before the Tour started, British favourite David Millar was in Biarritz, France with David Brailsford, the head coach of Great Britain for the upcoming Athens Olympics, when French police entered the restaurant they were dining in and forced Millar back to his flat and then arrested him on suspicion of doping. He was left off the Olympic team because of the incident, would likely face termination from Team and was going to be brought before a French court to answer questions regarding doping in cycling. Team Cofidis had only begun riding again in May, after a self-imposed suspension to conduct an internal doping investigation of their own team.

===Grand Depart in Belgium and the first week===

The opening prologue was in Liège Belgium and was 6.1 kilometres long. Fabian Cancellara, riding the first stage of his first Tour, won the stage and therefore the first yellow jersey. Francesco Moser, Dietrich Thurau and Chris Boardman are among other riders to have done this to begin their career. Lance Armstrong finished in 2nd two seconds behind and was therefore the highest GC contender. The closest contenders to him were Levi Leipheimer and Jan Ullrich. The two riders who defeated Armstrong in the recently held 2004 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré were Iban Mayo and Tyler Hamilton, both of whom were considered potential challengers. Hamilton finished +0:16 behind Armstrong and Mayo was +0:19 slower. Gilberto Simoni of Team , who had won two of the previous four Giro&#x27;s and podiumed five of the previous six had a tough day and finished +0:42 behind Cancellara. This Tour would end up being the best finish of his career, but in part due to this tough start he would not be a threat to the elite riders for the remainder of the race.

Stage 1 was a flat stage that was run entirely in Belgium and not long into the stage it began to rain heavily which would eventually be responsible for many crashes. 37 year old elite sprinter Mario Cipollini went down and had a difficult time getting back to the main pack and was not among the riders fighting for the stage win. The final breakaway was caught with 4 km to go and the stage was won by Jaan Kirsipuu of ahead of Robbie McEwen of and Thor Hushovd of . During this stage Lance Armstrong wore the green jersey for the only time in his career, being placed 2nd in the points competition behind Cancellara. During stage 2 the weather wasn&#x27;t as severe but there were still several crashes which resulted in the abandonment of a few riders. Marco Velo crashed violently, broke his collarbone and when he hit the ground landed on a glass bottle which cut his other shoulder open. He would continue the race but only survived a few more stages before calling it quits. A breakaway of five riders eventually went clear and Team tried controlling the escape in a manner similar to what they had done during the Giro a few months earlier where they were able to get sprinter Alessandro Petacchi in position to win an astonishing nine stages. They also were intent on protecting the yellow jersey of Cancellara as long as they could, however they were not able to control the Tour as they had done at the Giro and even though they were in good position as the end of the stage neared Cancellara had lost his yellow jersey and Petacchi finished 8th in the sprint. McEwen had won the sprint, attacking with 250 meters to go as Hushovd took 2nd place, but also moved into the yellow jersey as a result of the bonus seconds he won. This made him the first rider from Norway to lead the Tour de France.

Stage 3 would begin in Waterloo, Belgium and end just over the border in Wasquehal in Hauts-de-France. For the first time since the 1985 Tour de France a stage which included sections traversed during Paris–Roubaix was included. There were some sections of cobbles, but it was limited to only about four kilometres in two segments. A two rider breakaway of Jens Voigt of Team and Bram de Groot of Team eventually got a gap of nearly seven minutes before it started coming down. The pavé did cause some flat tires and crashes, including GC favorite Iban Mayo of , who crashed hard, shredding some of his uniform and costing him so much time he likely lost any chance of competing for victory. Christophe Moreau, GC rider for Team Credit Agricole who had finished in the top ten twice in recent years also got caught out in the peloton split and lost nearly four minutes. Thor Hushovd was stuck back in this group meaning he would likely lose his yellow and green jerseys. Roberto Heras of Team , who was an instrumental Lieutenant of Armstrong in previous Tour victories and himself a multi-time champion of the Vuelta a España, also had a tough time through the cobbles but he was able to fight his way back to the elite group. The two man breakaway was eventually caught but Jens Voight was able to finish in the group containing the GC riders. The stage was won by Jean-Patrick Nazon of Team AG2R who bested Erik Zabel of in the sprint. Robbie McEwen finished 3rd but moved into both the yellow and green jerseys.

Stage 4 was a team time trial (TTT) but there were new rules written regarding how much time could be lost by riders. The most any team could lose to the winning team was +3:00. The most the 2nd place team could lose was +0:20 and 3rd place would only lose +0:30. Some riders complained that their teams had worked hard to master the TTT and felt that time losses should be just as severe as they can be during an ITT. The TTT was dominated by Team . George Hincapie rode at the front near the end and when the finish line approached and they knew the race had been won they pulled up and celebrated while crossing the line. Team of Tyler Hamilton finished 2nd +1:07 behind. Phonak, who was riding in their first Tour as a team had a tough start to the stage and had only five riders remaining, the amount required to finish, with 15 km still remaining. Despite this Hamilton rode a high pace at the front and the team still finished strongly having the best time when they crossed the line. Team finished 3rd at +1:15 and the T-Mobile team of Ullrich and Andreas Klöden finished 4th. Team CSC of Ivan Basso finished in 5th place, and even though Team started five minutes before Team CSC, they actually caught up to the FDJ riders, who finished in last place. As a result, the general classification shifted to Armstrong taking over the maillot jaune and the next places being taken by his teammates Hincapie, Landis, Azevedo and Chechu Rubiera making up the new top 5. The closest GC riders to Armstrong were Hamilton in 8th at +0:36 and Ullrich, Kloden and Bobby Julich of Team CSC about a minute behind. The green jersey was kept by McEwen, Paolo Bettini of Team kept the polka dot jersey and the white jersey of the best young rider was worn by Matthias Kessler of T-Mobile. Stage 5 was the 60th day Lance Armstrong had worn the yellow jersey, tying him with Miguel Induráin for the 3rd most all time. A five rider breakaway got a massive gap during this stage and the US Postal team of Armstrong did nothing to prevent or reduce their advantage during the escape. Stuart O&#x27;Grady of Team , Jakob Piil of Team CSC, Sandy Casar of Team FDJ, Thomas Voeckler of Team and Magnus Bäckstedt of Team eventually built a gap approaching +17:00. They would finish in that order about +12:30 ahead of the main field and all five of them would make up the new top 5 overall. Being as Voeckler was the highest placed among them he moved into the yellow jersey, +9:35 ahead of 6th place Armstrong.

33 drug tests were conducted following the stage. Every rider tested produced a negative result, meaning all 33 riders would be cleared to sign in and start stage 6. Earlier in the year the book &quot;L.A. Confidentiel&quot; was released which claimed there was doping going on at the highest levels. Emma O&#x27;Reilly was a primary source for this book. She was paid a reasonable fee and confessed to some of the relatively minor things she had seen while working for Team US Postal, because she was worried some younger riders elsewhere in the sport may have died as a result of doping gone wrong.

Prior to the start of stage 6 Alessandro Petacchi, Bradley McGee and Mario Cipollini abandoned the Tour. Crashes earlier in the tour hindered them and the flat stages were all but over in this year&#x27;s edition. 2004 was the eighth Tour de France Cipollini entered in his career and he abandoned every single one of them. He did however, win a total of twelve stages. During stage 6 riders formed a breakaway but never extended their gap much beyond +5:00 and weren&#x27;t expected to survive to the finish. Impressively with 10 km to go they still had a gap but Credit Agricole, Team Lotto and Team were pulling at the front to make sure it would be a sprint finish. With about 5 km to Antonio Flecha of Team Fassa Bortolo, who had been in the breakaway for nearly 170 km, attacked shortly before the peloton caught them and built a bit of a gap. 1 km before the line he too was caught, and he shot back through the ranks as the sprint trains came by. A crash inside the flamme rouge caused McEwen to miss the sprint as Tom Boonen of Team Quick Step defeated O&#x27;Grady, who would maintain his narrow lead over the four closest opponents in the points competition. Danilo Hondo of Gerolsteiner and Baden Cooke of FDJ rounded out the top 5. This would be the last stage without a categorized climb for the remainder of the Tour with the exception of stage 14 and the semi-neutralized stage on the Champs-Élysées. Throughout this Tour there would be many crashes and GC favorite Tyler Hamilton went down in stage 6. He didn&#x27;t lose time but he suffered a lower back injury that would likely cause pain in the coming days. Adding briefly to the psychological stress, he also found out his dog, Tugboat, died.

By stage 7 there had already been 100 riders who had gone down in crashes including most GC contenders. The stage saw a two rider breakaway remain out front until there were about 30 km to go. After that some elements of the peloton were trying to keep the race together while others tried breaking away for the stage win. Towards the end of the stage the powerful riding of Francisco Mancebo of Team Illes Balears was enough open a small gap ahead of the yellow jersey group. Filippo Pozzato of Fassa Bortolo, the youngest rider in the Tour at 22, and Iker Flores of Team Euskaltel were able to hold his wheel until the line where Pozzato pulled around an exhausted Mancebo for the win. In the GC Voekler&#x27;s lead of +9:35 over Armstrong had not yet begun to come down. Armstrong led by +0:36 over Hamilton, the next closest contender not riding for US Postal. Mancebo jumped ahead of Ullrich and Julich with his late attack and was +0:43 behind Armstrong with Ullrich and Julich being the only other elites within a minute as Basso and Heras were within +2:00.

===The second week and the Pyrenees ===

Stage 8 had four categorized climbs, all of which were Cat-3 or Cat-4 meaning the stage would likely be decided between a successful breakaway or a sprint finish if all escape attempts could be destroyed. Four riders eventually went away, but one of them Karsten Kroon got a flat and wasn&#x27;t able to get a new tire in time to re-acquire contact with the break. They would hold out until just under 10 km and around this same time a dog ran into the back half of the peloton and caused a crash. As the finish approached Bettini made a break for the line but was caught, and then Kim Kirchen made a break for it but Thor Hushovd was able to overpower everyone and take the decisive victory ahead of Kirchen, Zabel and McEwen. In the points competition McEwen reclaimed the Maillot Vert. Even though O&#x27;Grady, Zabel, Hushovd and Danilo Hondo were all within twenty points of the jersey, McEwen would not relinquish it for the rest of the race. The next day was the first rest day.

Stage 9, just as the day before, saw many escape attempts early in the stage but none materialized. Eventually Iñigo Landaluze of Team and Filippo Simeoni of Team Domina Vacanze got a gap higher than +1:00 and were considered broken away. It is not known if Lance Armstrong was planning to ambush and humiliate Simeoni during this breakaway attempt, or if Armstrong was considering it petty revenge against Simeoni that could only be attempted if the race was well in hand. In regards to comments Simeoni made about Michele Ferrari. Simeoni and Landaluze extended their advantage considerably as Karsten Kroon tried his luck again, hoping to have better luck than yesterday. Kroon rode on his own for much of the stage, staying a few minutes ahead of the peloton, but not able to bridge the gap and join the other two escapees. When it became clear he would not catch them he pulled off to the side of the road, went to the bathroom to kill time until the peloton arrived, and then rejoined the pack. Meanwhile, Simeoni pulled hard for much of the stage, with Landaluze on his wheel. The pair held out all day but Simeoni was not going to allow Landaluze to come around him and steal the victory after he just did all the work so he stopped working as hard and just before the line the pair got swooped up by the sprinters operating at maximum speed. Simeoni and Landaluze finished inside the top 20 as McEwen won the day with Hushovd and O&#x27;Grady rounding out the podium.

Stage 10 was Bastille Day and had eight categorized climbs with one of them being Cat-1 and a pair of Cat-2&#x27;s meaning the polka dot jersey would likely change hands. Richard Virenque was attempting to break the record he shared with Lucien Van Impe and Federico Bahamontes by winning his 7th King of the mountains competition and he was the first rider to launch an attack. He was joined by Sylvain Chavanel, teammates with Voeckler on as well as Axel Merckx of . Chavanel, like many riders before him was a young rider who was predicted to have a long and successful career. On this day he did not last long and it would end up being Virenque and Merckx who stayed away. Virenque eventually dropped Merckx and went on to win the stage by over +5:00 and take over the polka dot jersey from Paolo Bettini. The GC riders crossed together with no major changes among them, however with his successful attack Virenque moved into 4th some two and a half minutes ahead of Armstrong. At the end of the stage the always emotional Virenque dedicated the stage victory to two people very close to him who had died recently, his grandmother and Joel Chabiron, a team coach of many years who had also gone through the entire Festina affair with him. Stage 11 began much the same way as the previous stage with three riders eventually breaking free. David Moncoutié of Cofidis, Juan Antonio Flecha of Fassa Bortolo and Egoi Martínez of Euskaltel. This breakaway would stay away together all day and eventually be successful. Moucoutié was able to successfully attack Flecha and Martínez with just under 10 km to go. He soloed to victory just over two minutes ahead of the other two escapees. The peloton came across just under six minutes after Moucoutié with no major changes in the overall situation.

In stage 12 Voeckler was expected to lose considerable time if not lose the yellow jersey outright. His defense of the jersey had been admirable but this stage included the Col d&#x27;Aspin as well as a Cat-1 version of the Col du Tourmalet with a mountaintop finish at La Mongie. There were several breakaway attempts and going up the Aspin Virenque, Moreau, Simeoni and Michael Rasmussen of Team all attacked. On the final climb it was the GC favorites who would produce the winner. As expected Voeckler got dropped, but he did not come entirely unhinged and kept his losses to under four minutes. More surprising was that Ullrich and Julich lost some two and a half minutes and Tyler Hamilton lost three and a half. Carlos Sastre, Ivan Basso and Lance Armstrong were the final riders remaining, but Sastre got dropped leaving Armstrong and Basso to contest the stage win. As the finish line approached Basso jolted ahead to take the win over Armstrong, who had picked up time on all of his other rivals. Armstrong was now in 2nd place having cut Voeckler&#x27;s lead down to +5:24. Sandy Casar and Jakob Piil, who were part of the Voeckler breakaway, still remained in the top 10 but the closest rivals to Armstrong were Virenque, Klöden, Basso and Mancebo who were about a minute behind him as Julich, Ullrich, Leipheimer and Hamilton were about four minutes behind.

The previous night, Hamilton had a problem with bad blood being given to him while blood doping. He had a bad night, was urinating a colour close to black from all the dead red blood cells, had developed a fever and was nervous to the point he wondered if he might die in his sleep. He asked a team doctor to keep an eye on him while he tried to sleep that night. Luckily the fever broke and he woke up in the morning; and rode as hard as he could during the stage.

Stage 13 would be more high mountains with a Cat-HC mountaintop finish at Plateau de Beille. The race was making its closest approach to Basque Country so the fans were anticipated to be in the hundreds of thousands. 165 riders started the stage meaning 23 riders had abandoned so far. Tyler Hamilton would lose contact less than halfway through the stage and abandon the Tour citing lower back pain. This was his eighth Tour de France entry and the first time he abandoned. Following the stage Urs Freuler, the D.S. of commented to a Marblehead, Massachusetts magazine reporter, who was there to cover the hometown hero Tyler Hamilton, about Hamilton&#x27;s withdrawal and because of it, the now dire future for the team for the remainder of the Tour, &quot;Mentally he&#x27;s 100%.The team morale was not that bad yesterday. Clear we lost the leader and didn&#x27;t makethe podium, but I thinkthe guys here are goodguys and we change a little bit the strategy and we gonowto try to win a stage.&quot; Óscar Pereiro, a young domestique initially riding in support of Hamilton, now became the highest GC rider for Phonak and would end the Tour in 10th. Other abandons by this point in the Tour included Denis Menchov and last year&#x27;s 5th-place finisher Haimar Zubeldia. His teammate, Iban Mayo, would suffer tremendously during the stage to the point he got off his bike and told the team he was quitting. After a few moments he decided to fight on to and he went up the rest of the climb with two Fassa Bartalo riders. Late in the stage it was once again Basso proving himself to be the only one capable of staying with Armstrong in this second week of racing. José Azevedo of Team broke the majority of the competition before pulling up and turning Armstrong loose against Basso. Georg Totschnig of , finished 3rd about a minute behind climbing his way into the top 10 in the process. Near the end of the stage some rowdy and over enthusiastic fans could have caused Armstrong trouble but he managed to deal with the Americans until he was safely inside the barriers where the finish line was. Armstrong won the stage, charging forward with a surge at the end that Basso did not answer. Voeckler once again valiantly fought to stay in contact with the riders above his level. He managed to finish 11th, which was good enough to keep him in the yellow jersey for another day as he now had a +0:22 advantage over Armstrong. Stage 13 was Voeckler&#x27;s ninth day in yellow, the longest a French rider had worn the leader&#x27;s jersey since Laurent Fignon in 1989. Armstrong was ahead of Basso by +1:17, Kloden by +2:56, Mancebo by +3:06, then at nearly +6:00 or beyond was Totschnig, Armstrong&#x27;s lieutenant José Azevedo and Jan Ullrich.

Stage 14 was a return to the flatlands where a group of ten breakaway riders was able to finish some fourteen minutes ahead of the main field. Aitor González of broke free near the end to defeat Nicolas Jalabert, the Phonak rider Freuler sent to attack in their first stage without Hamilton, and Christophe Mengin who rounded out the stage podium. The GC saw no changes. The next day would be the second rest day, prior to going into three high mountain stages in the Alps including a mountain ITT.

====The third week and the Alps====

From stage 15 on the Directeur Sportif&#x27;s began their game of attacks and plans and employing strategies to either win a stage in the Alps, or try to challenge Armstrong. Walter Godefroot of T-Mobile and Bjarne Riis of Team CSC, who among the Omerta code of secrecy within the sport had the nickname of &quot;Mr. Sixty&quot;, were the leaders of the only two teams who had realistic hope of challenging Bruyneel and US Postal. Other team managers of note during the Tour included Marc Sergeant and Patrick Lefevere both of whom were in the 2nd year of their two decade runs at Lotto and Quickstep respectively, Eusebio Unzué of Illes Balears who directed Delgado, Induráin and would stay with the team through the Movistar era, &quot;The Iron Sergeant&quot; Giancarlo Ferretti and Jean-René Bernaudeau, who directed Voeckler in this Tour.

Stage 15 was the first of three in the high Alps. The flat start prompted several riders to break away, including those in search of points being as the top 4 riders were still within 20 points of McEwen and even Danilo Hondo in 5th place was within 20 points of 4th place Stuart O&#x27;Grady. As the heavy climbing began Floyd Landis did the heavy work at the front of the elite group. Voigt, Virenque, Rasmussen, Leipheimer and Jan Ullrich attacked. As they neared the finish of the final climb the final riders included Armstrong, Basso, Kloden, Ullrich and Leipheimer, who would enter the top 10 at the end of the day. As expected Voeckler finally lost the yellow jersey, but as expected he went down fighting as he did his best to stay in the top 10 overall. In the end Armstrong was the strongest with only Basso with him as he crossed the finish as the pair of Ullrich and Kloden crossed a few seconds later.

Later that night Armstrong received death threats targeting him during the time trial the following day when 750,000 fans were expected on and around Alp d&#x27;Huez and crowd control would be, for all intents and purposes, impossible.

During the 1986 Tour de France Greg LeMond, the only other American Tour winner, had to deal with similar threats during his first Tour victory. LeMond suffered from extreme paranoia because he also had to worry about his food being poisoned, his brakes being manipulated, his drug tests being altered, being attacked from within his own team and being pushed off his bike while riding through potentially hostile crowds; many of these warnings coming from the Tour Directeur himself confirming their validity. Armstrong did not have these additional food poisoning, bike manipulation, team rivalry or drug test concerns as severely, being as he had the complete support of US Postal and riders during this era had the protective base of the team bus.

The ITT of stage 16 was held on Alpe d&#x27;Huez and would decide whether Basso would set up a final battle with Armstrong on stage 17 or if Armstrong would end the Tour right then and there. There were expected to be 750,000 fans in attendance and each rider would have to ride through the masses of humanity. The bottom half of the standings took to the course and the early times were set but as the top ranked riders started taking to the course the crowds became more unruly, aggressive, angry and excited as the day wore on and more people showed up and crowded their way alongside the road. Despite the conditions, including many riders being spat on and screamed at violently, Armstrong all but ended the Tour when he caught and then dropped Basso, even though Basso had started two minutes before him. Armstrong&#x27;s time, at the time, was good enough for 2nd on the top 100 times at Alp d&#x27;Huez. Jan Ullrich finished 2nd on the stage, his time good enough for 7th all time. The previous year Armstrong defeated Ullrich by +1:01 in the closest of Armstrong&#x27;s victories. Armstrong defeated Ullrich by +1:01 in the time trial and finished +2:33 ahead of Basso, who in reality rode a decent time trial considering he finished 8th. Kloden finished 3rd +1:41 behind. Wearing the green jersey Robbie McEwen rode a slow race and there was briefly worry he might miss the time cut and be thrown out of the race. When he realized he made it inside the time cut, he did a wheelie across the finish line. Armstrong now led Basso by just under four minutes and led Kloden by just over five. Both Ullrich and Azevedo jumped over Mancebo as Totschnig remained in 7th.

Stage 17 was the final high mountain stage and finished at Le Grand-Bornand. The Col du Glandon and Col de la Madeleine were the most difficult climbs to be dealt with. Virenque and Moreau went off in search of KOM points, although Virenque was the only rider with a chance of beating the GC riders for the polka dot jersey. Filippo Simeoni attacked as did Gilberto Simoni, Rasmussen, Merckx and several others but in the end it would be the GC elites to fight it out for the win. As the end of the stage neared it was clear that neither Basso, Kloden nor Ullrich had a chance at even making Armstrong nervous let alone threaten him. Floyd Landis did much of the work yet again for US Postal, as did Azevedo and Ruberia. Landis was the last domestique standing and this time he attacked off the front of the final elite group in an attempt to win the stage. Kloden, Basso and Ullrich would not allow it and saw to it he was chased down. Kloden then went for the stage win but Armstrong pounced and hunted him down and bested him at the line to take the stage win, again. In the young rider classification Vladimir Karpets had closed within a minute of Thomas Voeckler. In the overall situation Armstrong had over a +4:00 advantage on Basso, +5:00 on Kloden and +8:00 on Ullrich.

In stage 18 the high mountains were gone and it was the type of stage that could produce a successful breakaway. Six riders went away but when Simeoni went clear Armstrong chased him down. With the Tour now won Armstrong decided to make an example of a rider who was suing him. Simeoni had testified of knowledge he personally had experienced in regards to doping, and Armstrong called him a liar. This was the incident when Armstrong made the &quot;zip your lips&quot; motion to the camera. Simeoni was aware of his situation and his word not counting for much against the fame of Armstrong in a public situation being broadcast on TV. José Vicente García asked Simeoni to back off because if Armstrong remained in the breakaway the peloton would certainly hunt them down. Simeoni fell back, as did Armstrong and the break ended up building a winning gap of over ten minutes. Two riders fought for the win in the sprint where Juan Miguel Mercado edged García at the line. Stage 19 was the final ITT, a typical flat route, although with the dominant lead Armstrong held there wasn&#x27;t expected to be much excitement. Just the same Armstrong vowed not to back off and to go for the stage win. Viatcheslav Ekimov of Team set the early time to be beat. Ekimov finished the race in 80th, right next to teammate Pavel Padrnos. Padrnos and Stefano Zanini nearly had to leave the Tour because a doping hearing concerning the 2001 Giro d&#x27;Italia was taking place in Italy, and they may have had to give testimony. They were allowed to continue the race and finish if they were able to. Americans Bobby Julich and Floyd Landis set the next best times and Landis&#x27; would be good enough for 4th, which in conjunction with his performance in the mountains made him a potential contender in future Tours. The podium was made up by Kloden, Ullrich and Armstrong with very similar time gaps as the mountain time trial on Alp d&#x27;Huez. Basso finished 5th and was jumped by Kloden in the standings. Vladimir Karpets was able to take the white jersey from Voeckler during the time trial, the polka dot jersey was secured by Virenque, but the green jersey was not yet won and would be fought over on stage 20 during the finale in Paris.

The final stage was intended to be ceremonial, as the final stage typically is, where Team US Postal would celebrate the record breaking sixth Tour victory of Armstrong. 147 riders survived to the finish and only two teams, Team and Team survived with every rider. From the time &#x27;the race is on&#x27; was declared Simeoni attacked, having become angry over the incident with Armstrong over the previous two days. US Postal increased the pace at the front of the peloton to bring him back in, but before long Simeoni attacked again. Other teams, perhaps might have empathized with what Simeoni was trying to do, but there were five teams who were taking this stage very seriously and weren&#x27;t going to allow any breakaway to work. Teams , , , and were either in contention of winning the green jersey or were intending to win the stage so they were going to make every effort to destroy any escape attempts. Once the race reached the Champs-Élysées a breakaway of ten riders went clear. There were several strong riders in this break, including Pereiro and Jalabert of Team as well as Merckx Bettini, Voeckler and Scott Sunderland of among a few others. If this breakaway stayed clear McEwen would win the green jersey. They stayed away for about 25 km, several laps around the circuit, but the peloton worked hard to contain this group, even to the point of Jan Ullrich coming to the front for T-Mobile to help chase them down because his teammate Erik Zabel had to win the stage and hope McEwen had a bad sprint in order for him to win yet another green jersey. On the final lap Fabian Cancellara took a shot, but wasn&#x27;t able to get a gap and fell back into the bunch as the leadout trains formed for the upcoming sprint. Tom Boonen of Team who finished 6th in the points competition won the stage, announcing his arrival as one of the strongest sprinters in the coming years. He had ridden for US Postal, but changed teams because he felt he could win in his own right and did not want to be a support rider for Armstrong, as US Postal did not pursue stage wins or other jersey competitions. Jean-Patrick Nazon of Team got 2nd place in the sprint and finished 7th in the points competition while Danilo Hondo took the final podium place. As a result of these results, in conjunction with McEwen finishing 4th, McEwen won the points competition. The best young rider was Vladimir Karpets, Richard Virenque won the king of the mountains and Lance Armstrong won the Tour.

===Aftermath===

Lance Armstrong: With this victory Lance Armstrong became the first rider to six Tour wins. This victory would be followed with his 7th Tour victory the following year. The 2005 Tour de France would also tie Armstrong for 2nd on the list of all time podium finishes with Bernard Hinault and Joop Zoetemelk. He would tie Raymond Poulidor for the most podiums all time when he finished 3rd in the 2009 Tour de France. Following the &#x27;Lance Armstrong Doping Case&#x27; the record of five tour victories reverted to a tie between Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, and Miguel Induráin, and the record for podium finishes reverted to Poulidor.

Jan Ullrich: was always the primary favorite thought to be able to challenge the Armstrong machine of US Postal. He was never able to defeat Armstrong and finished 2nd to him on multiple occasions. Armstrong himself said Ullrich was the only rider he feared. He would be caught up in a doping scandal, admit to doping, have results voided because of it and retired prior to the 2007 cycling season considered one of the strongest riders of his generation. He said he never once felt like he cheated other cyclists he was competing against. Like Marco Pantani, Ullrich would develop substance abuse problems. Fortunately they did not take his life and as of 2022 he has been in recovery for several years.

Filippo Simeoni: was not a stranger to controversy prior to the stage 18 incident with Armstrong. The September 11 attacks happened during the first week of the 2001 Vuelta a España. Two weeks later Simeoni won a stage, and prior to the finish line he got off his bike, hoisted it above his head like a trophy and walked across the line. It is against the rules to do this, and there was question as to whether or not this was a tribute to the victims of the terrorist attacks in America. He rode for a few more years, winning the national championship of Italy in 2008. Like Levi Leipheimer he would face ridicule and bullying for being forced to testify by court order.

Levi Leipheimer: rode for well over a decade and had top tier results in several grand tours putting him behind only LeMond and Armstrong among American riders in many respects. In 2010 he was forced, as a law abiding American citizen, to testify to a grand jury regarding what he knew of doping in cycling. He was received harshly in the cycling world, received threats from riders on opposing teams and even the team boss of his own team, Johan Bruyneel, saw to it that Team Radioshack did not re-sign him whether it was for personal reasons, or to protect Leipheimer from the impending backlash. He rode for Team Quickstep at the end of his career and retired with a six-month suspension in the aftermath of the USADA case against Lance Armstrong.

Tyler Hamilton: He went on to win a gold medal in the 2004 Summer Olympics. On September 11, 2004, he became the first American to win a stage in all three grand tours. He did not finish the race, and then got caught in a doping control. He appealed initially, and even though they were fierce rivals, Lance Armstrong came to his defense offering to pay his legal fees. He went on to ride a few more years, but never again attempted to compete at the highest level. In 2005 and 2006 his only wins were riding in his native New England where he would win the Mount Washington mountain climb. In 2012 his book, written along with Daniel Coyle, won the William Hill Sports Book of the Year.

Thomas Voeckler: Following this performance Voeckler had offers coming at him in all directions, including an offer to become the highest paid French rider. Voeckler turned down the offer to remain riding for his current coach, Jean-René Bernaudeau. The next time a French rider would wear the yellow jersey as long as Voeckler did in 2004, wasn&#x27;t until 2011, and it was once again Voeckler, while still riding for Bernaudeau, wearing the maillot jaune for half the Tour.

===Doping===

The 18th stage saw mistreatment of Filippo Simeoni by Lance Armstrong, after Simeoni had testified about doping and doctor Michele Ferrari.

The book&quot; L. A. Confidentiel&quot;, by David Walsh and Pierre Ballester, came out shortly before the 2004 Tour, accusing Lance Armstrong of doping. Lance Armstrong and his lawyers asked for an emergency hearing in French court to insert a denial into the book. The French judge denied this request. Armstrong also launched defamation suits against the publisher and the authors, as well as magazine &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; and UK newspaper &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; which both referenced it.

Subsequent to Armstrong&#x27;s statement to withdraw his fight against United States Anti-Doping Agency&#x27;s (USADA) charges, on 24 August 2012, the USADA said it would ban Armstrong for life and stripped him of his record seven Tour de France titles. Later that day it was confirmed in a USADA statement that Armstrong was banned for life and would be disqualified from any and all competitive results obtained on and subsequent to 1 August 1998, including forfeiture of any medals, titles, winnings, finishes, points and prizes. On 22 October 2012, the Union Cycliste Internationale endorsed the USADA sanctions, and decided not to award victories to any other rider or upgrade other placings in any of the affected events.

After Hamilton&#x27;s doping scare at the 2004 Tour he had several other incidents that were the result of improper medical procedures. At one point he was in Madrid getting blood drawn to be transfused in a future race. Upon leaving the &quot;medical facility&quot; he was out on the streets of Madrid wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses so he wouldn&#x27;t be identified by any fans, when he noticed that his arm was covered in blood, dripping all the way down his arm. The needle wasn&#x27;t withdrawn properly or bandaged properly and at that moment Hamilton came to the realization that he was bleeding all over himself on the side of the road from one arm, and in his other hand he was holding a primitive version of a &quot;burner phone&quot;, a secret phone he used that had the numbers of all of his doping contacts.

Hamilton was caught in a doping incident during the 2004 Vuelta. His &quot;doctor&quot; had accidentally mixed up the rider&#x27;s blood and transfused the blood of another rider into Hamilton. This was discovered during a doping control and Hamilton was suspended for doping. Having the blood of another human could have caused him serious health trouble, although luckily for Hamilton it did not. Hamilton paid in excess of $100,000 of his own money for this medical &#x27;treatment&#x27;. See Operación Puerto doping case.

==Classification leadership and minor prizes==

There were four main individual classifications contested in the 2004 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider&#x27;s finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses given at the end of each mass start stage. If a crash had happened within the final of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.

The second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing in the highest positions in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage&#x27;s type. The leader was identified by a green jersey.

The third classification was the mountains classification. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and &quot;hors catégorie&quot;, with the more difficult climbs rated lower. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.

The final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1979. The leader wore a white jersey.

The final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie.

In addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass start stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have &quot;made the most effort and who has demonstrated the best sportsmanship&quot;. The winner wore a blue number bib the following stage. At the conclusion of the Tour, Richard Virenque () was given the overall super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the highest climb in the Tour, the Col de la Madeleine on stage 17. This prize was won by Gilberto Simoni.

*In stage 1, Lance Armstrong wore the green jersey.
*In stages 1 and 2, Bernhard Eisel wore the white jersey.
*In stage 3, Jaan Kirsipuu wore the green jersey.
*In stage 4, Jean-Patrick Nazon wore the green jersey.
*In stages 6 through 15, Sandy Casar wore the white jersey.

<text>The IBM Personal Computer AT (model 5170, abbreviated as IBM AT or PC/AT) was released in 1984 as the fourth model in the IBM Personal Computer line, following the IBM PC/XT and its IBM Portable PC variant. It was designed around the Intel 80286 microprocessor.

== Name ==
IBM did not specify an expanded form of &quot;AT&quot; on the machine, press releases, brochures or documentation, but some sources expand the term as &quot;Advanced Technology&quot;, including at least one internal IBM document.

==History==
IBM&#x27;s 1984 introduction of the AT was seen as an unusual move for the company, which typically waited for competitors to release new products before producing its own models. At $4,000–6,000, it was only slightly more expensive than considerably slower IBM models. The announcement surprised rival executives, who admitted that matching IBM&#x27;s prices would be difficult. No major competitor showed a comparable computer at COMDEX Las Vegas that year.
== Features ==
The AT is IBM PC compatible, with the most significant difference being a move to the 80286 processor from the 8088 processor of prior models. Like the IBM PC, the AT supported an optional math co-processor chip, the Intel 80287, for faster execution of floating point operations.

In addition, it introduced the AT bus, later known as the ISA bus, a 16-bit bus with backward compatibility with 8-bit PC-compatible expansion cards. The bus also offered fifteen IRQs and seven DMA channels, expanded from eight IRQs and four DMA channels for the PC, achieved by adding another 8259A IRQ controller and another 8237A DMA controller. Some IRQ and DMA channels are used by the motherboard and not exposed on the expansion bus. Both dual IRQ and DMA chipsets are cascading which shares the primary pair. In addition to these chipsets, Intel 82284 Clock Driver and Ready Interface and Intel 82288 Bus Controller are to support the microprocessor.

The 24-bit address bus of the 286 expands RAM capacity to 16 MB.

PC DOS 3.0 was included with support for the new AT features, including preliminary kernel support for networking (which was fully supported in a later version 3.x release).

The motherboard includes a battery-backed real-time clock (RTC) using the Motorola MC146818. This was an improvement from the PC, which required setting the clock manually or installing an RTC expansion card. The RTC also included a 1024 Hz timer (on IRQ 8), a much finer resolution than the 18 Hz timer on the PC.

In addition to keeping the time, the RTC includes 50 bytes of CMOS memory which is used to store software-adjustable BIOS parameters. A disk-based BIOS setup program which saved to this memory took the place of the DIP switches used to set system settings on PCs. Most AT clones have the setup program in ROM rather than on disk.

=== Storage ===
The standard floppy drive was upgraded to a 1.2 MB  inch floppy disk drive (15 sectors of 512 bytes, 80 tracks, two sides), which stored over three times as much data as the 360 KB PC floppy disk, but had compatibility problems with 360k disks (see Problems below).  inch floppy drives became available in later ATs.

A 20 MB hard disk drive was included as standard. Early drives were manufactured by Computer Memories and were found to be very unreliable.

=== Peripherals ===
The AT included the AT keyboard, initially a new 84-key layout (the 84th key being SysRq). The numerical keypad was now clearly separated from the main key group, and indicator LEDs were added for Caps Lock, Scroll Lock and Num Lock. The AT keyboard uses the same 5-pin DIN connector as the PC keyboard, but a different, bidirectional electrical interface with different keyboard scan codes. The bidirectional interface allows the computer to set the LED indicators on the keyboard, reset the keyboard, set the typematic rate, and other features. Later ATs included 101-key keyboards, e.g. the Model M keyboard.

The AT is also equipped with a physical lock that prevents access to the computer by disabling the keyboard and holding the system unit&#x27;s cover in place.

ATs could be equipped with CGA, MDA, EGA, or PGA video cards.

The 8250 UART from the PC was upgraded to the 16450, but since both chips had single-byte buffers, high-speed serial communication was problematic as with the XT.

=== Models ===

=== Power supply ===
The IBM PC AT came with a 192-watt switching power supply, significantly higher than the 130-watt XT power supply.

According to IBM&#x27;s documentation, in order to function properly, the AT power supply needed a load of at least 7.0 amperes on the +5 V line and a minimum of 2.5 amperes on its +12 V line. The power supply would fail to start unless these minimum load requirements were met, but the AT motherboard did not provide much load on the +12 V line. To solve this problem, entry-level IBM AT models that did not have a hard drive were shipped with a 5-ohm, 50-watt resistor connected on the +12 V line of the hard disk power connector. In normal operation this resistor drew 2.4 amperes (dissipating 28.8 watts), getting fairly hot.

== Problems ==
In addition to the unreliable hard disk drive, the high-density floppy disk drives turned out to be problematic. Some ATs came with one high-density (HD) disk drive and one double-density (DD) 360 KB drive. High-density floppy diskette media were compatible only with high-density drives.

There was no way for the disk drive to detect what kind of floppy disk was inserted, and the drives were not distinguished except by an asterisk molded into the 360 KB disk drive faceplate. If the user accidentally used a high-density diskette in the 360 KB drive, it would sometimes work, for a while, but the high-coercivity oxide would take a very weak magnetization from the 360 KB write heads, so reading the diskette would be problematic.

Conversely, the high-density drive&#x27;s heads had a track width half that of the 360 KB drive, so they were incapable of fully erasing and overwriting tracks written by a 360 KB drive. Overwriting a DD disk that had been written in a DD drive with an HD drive would result in a disk that read on an HD drive, but produced read errors in a DD drive. Whereas a HD read head would only pick up the half track that drive had written, the wider DD read head would pick up the half-track written by the HD drive mixed with the unerased half-track remnant of the track written earlier by a DD drive. Thus, the DD drive would end up reading both new and old information together, causing it to see garbled data.

== Clones ==
Due to a US antitrust consent decree with IBM, the PC AT architecture was functionally an open design, and IBM&#x27;s efforts to trademark the AT name largely failed. Many 286-based PCs were modeled after it and marketed as &quot;AT-compatible&quot;. The label also became a standard term in reference to PCs that used the same type of power supply, case, and motherboard layout as the 5170. &quot;AT-class&quot; became a term describing any machine which supported the same BIOS functions, 80286 or greater processor, 16-bit expansion slots, keyboard interface, 1.2 MB inch floppy disk drives and other defining technical features of the IBM PC AT.

In the United States, popular brands of AT clones included the Tandy 3000, Compaq Deskpro 286, HP Vectra, Zenith Z-286, Epson Equity Models II+ and III, and Commodore PC-30 and PC-40. In Europe, on the other hand, most AT-clones sold were more or less anonymous.

The AT bus became the de facto ISA (Industry Standard Architecture), while PC XT slots were retroactively named &quot;8-bit ISA&quot;. The disk interface for the AT, originally a Seagate ST506 compatible interface on IBM&#x27;s disk controller card, was updated and standardized as ATA (&quot;AT Attachment&quot;) by Western Digital and Compaq in 1986, and later renamed PATA (Parallel AT Attachment). The ATA interface was also known as IDE, because the drive controller, instead of being on the interface card, was integrated into the drive (Integrated Drive Electronics).

==Reception==
By January 1985, AT sales were so strong that IBM and its suppliers could not keep up with demand.

&quot;Creative Computing&quot; in December 1984 said &quot;the folks at IBM have done it again&quot;. It approved of the &quot;refreshingly standard&quot; keyboard layout, but said that &quot;for most individuals, AT power represents overkill ... a state of the art machine at a top of the line price&quot;. That month the magazine&#x27;s David H. Ahl chose the AT as the best desktop computer when &quot;price is no object&quot; for 1984, describing it as &quot;an innovative, state-of-the-art computer that has the competition gasping for breath&quot;. An industry analyst wrote in &quot;Computerworld&quot; in 1985 that the AT&#x27;s power was evidence of IBM&#x27;s belief that personal computers were more important for the company than minicomputers.

==Successor==

On April 2, 1987, IBM announced the Personal System/2 (PS/2) line, which they marketed as the second-generation of IBM PC. The company promised to continue manufacturing certain models of the first-generation PC, including the AT, for the coming months. In June 1987, they announced the full withdrawal of the PC/XT and the imminent discontinuation of the PC/AT. The last units of PC/AT (model 339) rolled off the assembly line in July. While the PC/XT received a directly compatible replacement in the form of the PS/2 Model 30, the AT did not. Users either had to forgo all their 16-bit ISA expansion cards and switch to the proprietary Micro Channel architecture, or settle for a clone if they wanted to upgrade their machine while keeping their expansions. Eventually, in September 1988, IBM announced the PS/2 Model 30 286, which featured an Intel 80286 processor and 16-bit ISA expansion slots, serving as the direct replacement for the AT for customers who wanted to buy a true IBM system.

<text>Eli Biham () is an Israeli cryptographer and cryptanalyst who is a professor at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology Computer Science department. From 2008 to 2013, Biham was the dean of the Technion Computer Science department, after serving for two years as chief of CS graduate school.
Biham invented (publicly) differential cryptanalysis, for which he received his Ph.D., while working under Adi Shamir. It had been invented before by a team at IBM during their Data Encryption Standard work; the National Security Agency told IBM to keep the discovery secret.

==Contributions to cryptanalysis==
* Differential cryptanalysis - publicly invented during his Ph.D. studies under Adi Shamir
* Attacking all triple modes of operation.
* Impossible differential cryptanalysis - joint work with Adi Shamir and Alex Biryukov
* Breaking (together with Lars Knudsen) the ANSI X9.52 CBCM mode (few days before the final standardization)
* Breaking the GSM security mechanisms (with Elad Barkan and Nathan Keller)
* Co-invention of related-key attacks.
* Differential Fault Analysis - joint work with Adi Shamir
* Conditional Linear Cryptanalysis - joint work with Stav Perle
*Efficient slide attacks with reduced time complexity 

===New cryptographic primitives===
Biham has taken part in the design of several new cryptographic primitives:

* Serpent (with Ross Anderson and Lars Knudsen), a block cipher which was one of the final five contenders to become the Advanced Encryption Standard
* Tiger (with Ross Anderson), a hash function fast on 64-bit machines, and
* Py (with Jennifer Seberry), one of a family of fast stream ciphers (see article for more detail on their cryptanalytic status).
* SHAvite-3 (with Orr Dunkelman), a hash function which was one of the 14 semifinalists in the NIST hash function competition.

<doc id="348924" wikidata="Q1125196" url="?curid=348924" title="Confessional poetry">
<text>Confessional poetry or &quot;Confessionalism&quot; is a style of poetry that emerged in the United States during the late 1950s and early 1960s. It is sometimes classified as a form of Postmodernism. It has been described as poetry of the personal or &quot;I&quot;, focusing on extreme moments of individual experience, the psyche, and personal trauma, including previously and occasionally still taboo matters such as mental illness, sexuality, and suicide, often set in relation to broader social themes.

The confessional poet&#x27;s engagement with personal experience has been explained by literary critics as an effort to distance oneself from the horrifying social realities of the twentieth century. Events like the Holocaust, the Cold War, and existential threat brought by the proliferation of nuclear weapons had made public matters daunting for both confessional poets and their readers. The confessional poets also worked in opposition to the idealization of domesticity in the 1950s, by revealing unhappiness in their own homes.

The school of &quot;confessional poetry&quot; was associated with poets who redefined American poetry in the 1950s and 1960s, including Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, John Berryman, Anne Sexton, and W. D. Snodgrass.

==&quot;Life Studies&quot; and the emergence of Confessionalism==
In 1959 M. L. Rosenthal first used the term &quot;confessional&quot; in a review of Robert Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Life Studies&quot; entitled &quot;Poetry as Confession&quot;. Rosenthal differentiated the confessional approach from other modes of lyric poetry by way of its use of confidences that (Rosenthal said) went &quot;beyond customary bounds of reticence or personal embarrassment&quot;. Rosenthal notes that in earlier tendencies towards the confessional, there was typically a &quot;mask&quot; that hid the poet&#x27;s &quot;actual face&quot;, and states that &quot;Lowell removes the mask. His speaker is unequivocally himself, and it is hard not to think of &quot;Life Studies&quot; as a series of personal confidences, rather shameful, that one is honor-bound not to reveal&quot;. In a review of the book in &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot;, John Thompson wrote, &quot;For these poems, the question of propriety no longer exists. They have made a conquest: what they have won is a major expansion of the territory of poetry.&quot;

There were however clear moves towards the &quot;confessional&quot; mode before the publication of &quot;Life Studies&quot;. Delmore Schwartz&#x27;s confessional long poem &quot;Genesis&quot; had been published in 1943; and John Berryman had written a sonnet sequence in 1947 about an adulterous affair he&#x27;d had with a woman named Chris while he was married to his first wife, Eileen (but since publishing the sonnets would have revealed the affair to his wife, Berryman didn&#x27;t actually publish the sequence, titled &quot;Berryman&#x27;s Sonnets&quot;, until 1967, after he divorced from his first wife). Snodgrass&#x27; &quot;Heart&#x27;s Needle&quot;, in which he writes about the aftermath of his divorce, also preceded &quot;Life Studies&quot;.

&quot;Life Studies&quot; was nonetheless the first book in the confessional mode that captured the reading public&#x27;s attention and the first labeled &quot;confessional.&quot; Most notably &quot;confessional&quot; were the poems in the final section of &quot;Life Studies&quot; in which Lowell alludes to his struggles with mental illness and his hospitalization at McLean&#x27;s, a mental hospital in Massachusetts. Plath remarked upon the influence of these types of poems from &quot;Life Studies&quot; in an interview in which she stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve been very excited by what I feel is the new breakthrough that came with, say, Robert Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Life Studies&quot;, this intense breakthrough into very serious, very personal, emotional experience which I feel has been partly taboo. Robert Lowell&#x27;s poems about his experience in a mental hospital, for example, interested me very much.&quot; A. Alvarez however considered that some poems in &quot;Life Studies&quot; &quot;fail for appearing more compulsively concerned with the processes of psychoanalysis than with those of poetry&quot; while conversely Michael Hofmann saw the verbal merit of Lowell&#x27;s work only diminished by emphasis on &quot;what I would call the C-word, &#x27;Confessionalism&#x27;&quot;.

In a poetry class he taught at Boston University in the late 1950s, Lowell would go on to inspire confessional themes in the work of several prominent American poets. In 1955 Lowell requested a position at the university in part based on the suggestions of his psychiatrist, who advised Lowell to establish a routine in his life to help mitigate the effects of bipolar disorder. Lowell&#x27;s class drew in a number of talented poets, including Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath. Sexton joined the class in 1958, and working with Lowell proved pivotal in building her poetic voice. In 1958, Sylvia Plath would also join Lowell&#x27;s course. After exposure to the personal topics in Lowell&#x27;s and Sexton&#x27;s poems, Plath was drawn to confessional themes herself and began including them in her own work.

==Further developments==
Other key texts of the American &quot;confessional&quot; school of poetry include Plath&#x27;s &quot;Ariel&quot;, Berryman&#x27;s &quot;The Dream Songs&quot;, and Sexton&#x27;s &quot;To Bedlam and Part Way Back&quot;, though Berryman himself rejected the label &quot;with rage and contempt&quot;: &quot;The word doesn&#x27;t mean anything. I understand the confessional to be a place where you go and talk with a priest. I personally haven&#x27;t been to confession since I was twelve years old&quot;. Another significant, if transitional figure was Adrienne Rich; while one of the most prominent, consciously &quot;confessional&quot; poets to emerge in the 1980s was Sharon Olds whose focus on taboo sexual subject matter built on the work of Ginsberg.

But some contemporary modern poets produce plural bodies of work that combine the confessional mode with other core aspects of their output; this absorption of the confessional into a larger, more diverse oeuvre comes under the umbrella of &#x27;Poeclectics&#x27;, whereby confessionalism becomes, for certain poets, just one important strand in a writing approach that deploys &quot;all kinds of style, subject, voice, register and form&quot;.

==Influence ==
In the 1970s and 1980s many poets and writers, like Sharon Olds, Marie Howe, and Franz Wright, were strongly influenced by the precedent set by confessional poetry with its themes of taboo autobiographical experience, of the psyche and the self, and revelations of both childhood and adult traumas.

In an essay published in 1985 poet Stanley Kunitz wrote that Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Life Studies&quot; was &quot;perhaps the most influential book of modern verse since T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;.&quot;

Artists such as Peter Gabriel, Morrissey, and Madonna have all described Sexton as being influential to their work.

== Criticism ==
In a 1977 interview with &quot;Paris Review&quot;, Richard Wilbur criticized confessional poetry, saying, &quot;One of the jobs of poetry is to make the unbearable bearable, not by falsehood, but by clear, precise confrontation. Even the most cheerful poet has to cope with pain as part of the human lot; what he shouldn&#x27;t do is to complain, and dwell on his personal mischance.&quot; Deep image poet Robert Bly made a similar criticism.

Some literary critics of Confessional poets have noticed a shared ambition among many of these writers to become celebrities. In concurrence with the proliferation of popular culture during the 1950s, confessionalism offered readers a detailed view of the writer&#x27;s personal hardships, and in light of the considerable public attention which confessional poets received, the confessional movement is seen by some literary critics as a form of celebrity culture.

A literary movement called the language poets formed as a reaction against confessional poetry and took as their starting point the early modernist poetry composed by Gertrude Stein, William Carlos Williams, and Louis Zukofsky. Despite this, Language poetry has been called an example of postmodernism in American poetry.

By far the most controversial reaction against confessional poetry is known as New Formalism, which argues for the return to rhymed, metrical, and narrative poetry. New formalism began during the 1970s and early 80s when younger poets from the Baby Boom Generation began to fight against the dominance of both free verse and confessional poetry. In 1981, New Formalist poet R.S. Gwynn published &quot;The Narcissiad&quot;, which literary critic Robert McPhillips later dubbed, &quot;a Popean mock epic lambasting contemporary poets&quot;.

<doc id="348928" wikidata="Q716051" url="?curid=348928" title="T. V. Soong">
<text>Soong Tse-vung, more commonly romanized as Soong Tse-ven or Soong Tzu-wen (; 4 December 1894 – 25 April 1971), was a Chinese businessman, banker, and politician who served as Premier of the Republic of China in 1930 and between 1945 and 1947. 

==Early life and education==
T. V. Soong was born at St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in the Shanghai International Settlement. He was first educated in Shanghai at St. John&#x27;s University, and then graduated from Harvard University with a bachelor’s degree in economics in 1915. He worked at the International Banking Corporation in New York while pursuing graduate studies at Columbia University. His sisters, known collectively as the Soong sisters, married well: the first, Ai-ling, married H. H. Kung, an Oberlin College graduate from a leading family of Chinese bankers who went on to become Premier of the Republic of China; the second, Ching-ling, married Sun Yat-sen, the founder and leader of the Chinese nationalist movement; and the third, Mei-ling, was First Lady of the Republic of China as wife of Chiang Kai-shek.

==Career==
Upon returning to China, he worked for several industrial enterprises, and was then recruited by Sun Yat-sen to develop finances for his Canton government. After the success of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Northern Expedition in 1927, Soong served in a succession of offices in the Nationalist Government, including as Governor of the Central Bank of China (1928–1934) and as Minister of Finance (1928–1933).

He founded the China Development Finance Corporation (CDFC) in 1934, along with other prominent financial figures, such as Chang Kia-ngau, Chen Guangpu and H.H. Kung. CDFC provided China&#x27;s chief access to foreign investment for the next decade. Many CDFC financial packages benefitted companies that were related to Soong or his family members. 

In the summer of 1940, Chiang appointed Soong to Washington, D.C., as his personal representative. His task was to win support for China&#x27;s war with Japan. Soong successfully negotiated substantial loans for this purpose. After Pearl Harbor, Chiang appointed Soong Minister of Foreign Affairs, though Soong remained in Washington to manage the alliance with both the U.S. and the U.K.

During his tenure as Finance Minister, he managed to balance China&#x27;s budget, which was no small accomplishment. He resigned in 1933, displeased with Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s appeasement of Japan and attempts to placate Japanese aggression. He later returned to service as Minister of Foreign Affairs (1942–1945), and as President of the Executive Yuan (1945–1947). Soong left his legacy as head of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco, April 1945, which later became the United Nations.

During the German invasion of Russia, Soong was in charge of negotiating with the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin regarding Soviet interests in China, and travelled to Moscow to extract from Stalin a guarantee to oppose the Chinese Communist Party. Soong conceded to Stalin the Manchurian railways and Korean independence but refused to allow Soviet interference in Xinjiang or military bases in Manchuria. He also indicated that China and the Soviet Union could share dominion over Mongolia if a &quot;mutual assistance pact&quot; was agreed to. Soong was known for his tough negotiating style with Stalin in getting straight to the point and freely using the threat of American military backing to strengthen his demands. When the Sino-Soviet treaty was signed, China ceded to the Soviets parts of Mongolia, the use of a naval base at Port Arthur (with civilian rule remaining Chinese), and co-ownership of the Chinese Eastern Railway in Manchuria.

In return, Soong extracted from Stalin recognition of the Republic of China as the legitimate regime of China, aid from the Soviets, and an oral agreement to an eventual Soviet withdrawal from Manchuria. The treaty failed to end tension in China with the communists, which resulted in renewed fighting after Chinese communist revolution. Stalin had previously told the Americans that Franklin Roosevelt should inform Chiang Kai-shek of the Russian demands in Manchuria, at the Yalta Conference, before Stalin informed Soong.

During the war years, he financed the Flying Tigers, American mercenary group that was later incorporated into the United States Air Force. Gen. Claire Chennault was listed as an employee of the Bank of China. On this project Soong worked very closely with his sister, May-ling Soong. He once remarked to John Paton Davies, Jr., one of the China Hands, that there were no U.S. State Department memos sent from China to which he did not have access within a few days.

Criticism of Soong increased as the Nationalist government&#x27;s financial crisis increased during January and early February 1947. Rival Nationalist individuals and factions which criticized him included those associated with Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, CC Clique, and the Gexin movement. The Gexin movement criticized Soong for what the group described as his bureaucratic capitalism, a phrase likely adopted from the communists&#x27; criticisms of Soong. The Gexin movement influenced many newspaper&#x27;s criticisms of Soong. Its criticisms of Soong were also echoed in the Legislative Yuan.

On March 1, 1947, Soong resigned as president of the Executive Yuan. Nonetheless, Soong was active in the Nationalist government&#x27;s financial policy until he moved to the United States in January 1949. Soong moved to New York and remained an influential member of the China Lobby.

==Death==
On 25 April 1971, Soong choked to death in San Francisco at a dinner party hosted by the chairman of the San Francisco branch of the Bank of Canton, when a piece of chicken lodged in his windpipe. Soong was survived by his widow, (張樂怡; Chang¹ Lê⁴-I²; Zhāng Lèyí), who had taken on the English name of Laura Chang Soong.

<text>Erwin Ratz (22 December 1898, Graz – 12 December 1973, Vienna) was an Austrian musicologist and music theorist. He is known especially for his work as president of the &quot;Gustav Mahler Gesellschaft&quot; and for his book &quot;Einführung in die musikalische Formenlehre&quot;. During Nazi rule, he saved the lives of several Austrian Jews by sheltering them in his apartment for a number of years.

==Biography==

Between 1918 and 1922, Ratz studied musicology with Guido Adler at the Institute of Musicology of the University of Vienna. At the same time (between 1917 and 1920), he participated in Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s seminar for composition and was active in the Schoenberg circle. Schoenberg&#x27;s students included pianist Olga Novakovic and Hanns Eisler, with whom Ratz became friends. Ratz later did all but one of the piano reductions for Eisler&#x27;s &quot;Balladenbuch&quot; (1929–31). For Ratz, Schoenberg was the central personality and influence of his youth, their lessons creating the crucial foundations of Ratz&#x27;s thinking. In 1918, in an attempt to introduce Schönberg&#x27;s work to a broader public, Ratz organized &quot;ten public rehearsals for Schoenberg&#x27;s Chamber Symphony&quot;, a series of events from which the &quot;Association for Musical Private Performances&quot; emerged in November 1918.

In 1921–1922, due to straightened financial circumstances, he worked at the Bauhaus in Weimar as a secretary. Despite his relatively short time at the Bauhaus, this center of intense artistic life was also extremely influential on Ratz, through the variety and richness of its activities and its lively, comprehensive artistic events, which included the latest musical developments. Ratz returned to Vienna in 1922 or 1923.

During the period of Nazi rule, Ratz took in a number of Jews and hid them in his apartment, effectively saving their lives. He was supported in this by his former wife, Lonny (Leonie) Ratz. In 2016 both were posthumously recognised for their resistance, receiving the title of Righteous Among the Nations from Yad Vashem.

After World War II he became a lecturer in musical form and analysis at the Academy of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna (Akademie für Musik und darstellende Kunst; now the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna). He also worked as an editor for Universal Edition. In 1957 he received the title of professor. From 1949 to 1968 he was involved (from 1952 in a leading position) in the Austrian section of the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM).

Ratz gained international renown as President of the &quot;Gustav Mahler Gesellschaft&quot; in Vienna, and especially for his role in the publication of the complete edition of Mahler&#x27;s musical compositions. From 1960, however, Ratz fought against the efforts of Deryck Cooke and others to create performable editions of Mahler&#x27;s unfinished Tenth Symphony, insisting in articles and interviews that no such attempt could be legitimate given the state of Mahler&#x27;s draft.

==Introduction to Musical Form==

Ratz is also known for his work &quot;Einführung in die musikalische Formenlehre&quot; (&quot;Introduction to Musical Form&quot;), which is devoted primarily to the work of Bach and Beethoven and strives to find commonalities in their compositional principles. Ratz&#x27;s explanation and expansion of Schoenberg&#x27;s notions of the &quot;basic idea&quot; and the typology of themes (period and sentence) form the foundation of William Caplin&#x27;s theory of formal functions.

<doc id="348941" wikidata="Q237990" url="?curid=348941" title="Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz">
<text>Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (; 3 March 1778 – 29 June 1841) was Queen of Hanover from 20 June 1837 until her death in 1841 as the wife of King Ernest Augustus. She was a German princess who married successively Prince Louis Charles of Prussia, Prince Frederick William of Solms-Braunfels, and her first cousin Ernest Augustus. Through her 1815 marriage to Ernest, then Duke of Cumberland, Frederica became a British princess and Duchess of Cumberland. Ernest was the fifth son and eighth child of Queen Charlotte and King George III of the United Kingdom, Frederica&#x27;s paternal aunt and her husband.

Frederica was born in the &quot;Altes Palais&quot; of Hanover as the fifth daughter of Charles II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and Princess Friederike of Hesse-Darmstadt. Her father assumed the title of Grand Duke of Mecklenburg on 18 June 1815.

==Early life==
Frederica&#x27;s mother died on 22 May 1782 after giving birth to her tenth child. Two years later (28 September 1784), her father remarried the younger sister of his deceased wife, Princess Charlotte of Hesse-Darmstadt, but this union ended just one year later, when Charlotte died of complications resulting from childbirth on 12 December 1785.

The twice-widowed Duke Charles considered himself unable to give his daughters proper rearing and education, so he sent Frederica and her elder sisters Charlotte, Therese and Louise to their maternal grandmother, Princess Maria Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt. Maria Louise&#x27;s choice of a Swiss teacher for the girls, Salomé de Gélieu, proved to be a good one. Some time later, Duke Charles also sent his two surviving sons, George and Charles, to be raised by their grandmother.

==First marriage==
Frederica&#x27;s father was anxious to arrange advantageous marriages for all his daughters, and used family connections to bring this about. Queen Frederika Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt, wife of King Frederick William II, was a first cousin of Frederica&#x27;s mother. Frederica&#x27;s father broached with the Prussian royal family the idea of marriage between their children, and the Prussians were not averse. On 14 March 1793, the Mecklenburg-Strelitz duchesses &quot;coincidentally&quot; met King Frederick William II of Prussia at the Prussian Theatre in Frankfurt-am-Main. He was immediately captivated by the grace and charm of both sisters, Frederica and Louise. The pending marriage negotiations received traction, and within weeks, the matter was settled: Frederica&#x27;s elder sister Louise would marry Crown Prince Frederick William, and Frederica would marry his younger brother Prince Louis.

The double engagement was celebrated in Darmstadt on 24 April 1793, only a few weeks after the sisters fortuitously met their future father-in-law at the theatre. On 24 December Duchess Louise and Crown Prince Frederick William were married in the Royal Palace of Berlin; two days later, on 26 December, Duchess Frederica and Prince Louis were also married at the same venue.

Unlike her sister, Frederica did not enjoy a happy marriage. Although her husband died only three years after the wedding, Louis was said to have preferred the company of his mistresses and completely neglected his wife, or at least, that is her version; in response, she allegedly began an affair with her husband&#x27;s uncle Prince Louis Ferdinand. Despite her husband&#x27;s alleged neglect, Frederica did bear him three children in as many years: Frederick in 1794; a short-lived son, Charles, in 1795; and a daughter, Frederica, in 1796.

In 1795, King Frederick William II appointed Louis as Chief of the Dragoons Regiment No.1, which was stationed in Schwedt. One year later, on 23 December 1796, Prince Louis died of diphtheria. It was three years almost to the day since their wedding. At this time, his youngest child, Frederica, was less than three months old, and his eldest son was hardly two years old. After Louis&#x27;s death, his father provided Frederica with a suitable residence near Berlin, and a sufficient income, and she moved with her three children to Schönhausen Palace near Berlin.

In 1797, Frederica became unofficially engaged to her cousin Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, seventh son of King George III of Great Britain by his wife, Queen Charlotte (Frederica&#x27;s paternal aunt). The Duke of Cambridge asked the consent of his father to the marriage. The King did not refuse his consent but asked his son to wait until the ongoing war with France was over. The relationship eventually ended, with rumors circulating that either Adolphus had offered to release Frederica from the engagement, or – as Queen Charlotte believed – Frederica had jilted him for another man.

==Second marriage==
In 1798 Frederica became pregnant. The father was Prince Frederick William of Solms-Braunfels. The prince recognized his paternity and requested her hand in marriage, a proposal that was quickly granted in order to avoid scandal. On 10 December that year the couple was married in Berlin and immediately moved to Ansbach. Two months later, in February 1799, Frederica gave birth to a daughter who only lived eight months. Prince Frederick William, disappointed and embittered, resumed his old dissipated lifestyle and became an alcoholic. In 1805 he resigned his military posts for &quot;health reasons&quot;. Frederica had to maintain her family with her own resources after her former brother-in-law Frederick William III refused to restore her annual pension as a dowager princess of Prussia. William Christian, Prince of Solms-Braunfels, Frederica&#x27;s brother-in-law and head of the family, advised her to get a divorce, with his full approval. She and her husband nonetheless refused.

==Third marriage==
In May 1813, during a visit to his uncle Duke Charles in Neustrelitz, Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, the fifth son of King George III, met and fell in love with Frederica, who was his first cousin. Duke Charles made it clear to his daughter that her separation from the Prince of Solms-Braunfels was absolutely logical, and that he saw a marriage with an English prince as a great opportunity for her. During the next months Frederica considered the intentions of Ernest and the possible effects on her own situation. When, after the victory of the allies in the Battle of Leipzig, Ernest spent some days in Neustrelitz, he was greeted enthusiastically. Some time later Frederica asked the Prussian king for approval for her divorce from Prince Frederick William of Solms-Braunfels. All parties agreed, including the Prince of Solms-Braunfels, but Frederick William&#x27;s sudden death on 13 April 1814 precluded the need for a divorce. The prince&#x27;s demise was considered by some as a little too convenient, and some suspected that Frederica had poisoned him. In August, the engagement with Ernest was officially announced. After Ernest&#x27;s eldest brother, George, Prince Regent, gave his consent to the wedding, Frederica and Ernest were married on 29 May 1815 at the parish church of Neustrelitz. Some time later, the couple traveled to Great Britain and married again on 29 August 1815 at Carlton House, London.

Queen Charlotte bitterly opposed the marriage, even though her future daughter-in-law was also her niece. She refused to attend the wedding and advised her son to live outside England with his wife. Frederica never obtained the favour of the Queen, who died unreconciled with her in 1818. During her marriage to Ernest she gave birth three times, but only a son survived, who would eventually become King George V of Hanover.

==Queen of Hanover==

On 20 June 1837 King William IV of the United Kingdom and Hanover died without surviving legitimate issue. His heir was his niece Princess Victoria, but because Hanover had been ruled under semi-Salic Law since the times of the Holy Roman Empire, Victoria could not inherit the Hanoverian throne. The next male heir was Ernest Augustus, King William&#x27;s brother, who then became King of Hanover, with Frederica as his queen consort.

After a short illness, Queen Frederica died in 1841 at Hanover. The Court master builder Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves was instructed by the King to build a mausoleum for his wife and himself in the garden of the chapel at Herrenhausen Palace. He also gave royal orders for the transformation of a central square near the &quot;Leineschloss&quot; and renamed it &quot;Friederikenplatz&quot; in her honour.

<doc id="348942" wikidata="Q430675" url="?curid=348942" title="Psyllium">
<text>Psyllium (), or ispaghula (), is the common name used for several members of the plant genus &quot;Plantago&quot; whose seeds are used commercially for the production of mucilage. Psyllium is mainly used as a dietary fiber to relieve symptoms of both constipation and mild diarrhea, and occasionally as a food thickener. Allergy to psyllium is common in workers frequently exposed to the substance.

Use of psyllium in the diet for three weeks or longer may lower blood cholesterol levels in people with elevated cholesterol, and may lower blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Use of psyllium for a month or longer may produce a small reduction in systolic blood pressure.

The plants from which the seeds are extracted tolerate damp and cool climates, and are mainly cultivated in northern India.

==Uses==
===Preparation===
Psyllium is produced mainly for its mucilage content. The term &quot;mucilage&quot; describes a group of clear, colorless, gelling agents derived from plants. The mucilage obtained from psyllium comes from the seed coat. Mucilage is obtained by mechanical milling (i.e. grinding) of the outer layer of the seed. Mucilage yield amounts to about 25% (by weight) of the total seed yield. Plantago-seed mucilage is often referred to as husk, or psyllium husk. The milled seed mucilage is a white fibrous material that is hydrophilic, meaning that its molecular structure causes it to attract and bind to water.

===Food===
Psyllium has been used as a thickener in ice cream and other frozen desserts. A 1.5% weight/volume ratio of psyllium mucilage exhibits binding properties that are superior to a 10% weight/volume ratio of starch mucilage. The viscosity of psyllium mucilage dispersions are relatively unaffected between temperatures of , by pH from 2 to 10, and by salt (sodium chloride) concentrations up to 0.15&quot; &quot;M.
Psyllium seed husks can also be used to improve texture in gluten-free baked goods, to bind meatballs, and to thicken sauces. Some people use them to manage symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.

===Human health===

==== Weight loss ====
Dietary supplements containing psyllium are sold mainly to aid weight loss, although there is little scientific evidence for such effects.

A 2023 review concluded that psyllium supplementation for 12 weeks by people who were overweight or obese produced a minor amount of weight loss, although the studies assessed had only moderate to low evidence quality.

====Constipation====
Psyllium is mainly used as a viscous, soluble dietary fiber that is not absorbed by the small intestine. The mechanical action of psyllium mucilage is to absorb excess water while stimulating normal bowel elimination. Although its main use has been as a laxative, it is more accurately regarded as a dietary fiber to reduce the symptoms of both constipation and mild diarrhea. The laxative properties of psyllium are attributed to the fiber: it absorbs water and subsequently softens the stool. It increases flatulence (gas) to some degree. Psyllium reduces straining during defecation by increasing the bulk of stools, thereby facilitating the transit of stools in the colon. When used to treat constipation, psyllium is taken in doses of 3.5–11 grams per day twice daily.

A 2021 review of over-the-counter treatments for constipation concluded that psyllium has modest effect in treating constipation and is generally safe and well-tolerated. Psyllium may be less effective compared to other products, such as polyethylene glycol, lactulose or fruits like prunes. Psyllium is more effective than docusate.

A 2022 review found that psyllium, in doses of 10 grams per day for at least 4 weeks, was more effective than osmotic or stimulant laxatives for increasing the number of bowel movements per week.

====High blood cholesterol====
In 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a health claim on food labels for dietary psyllium as a soluble fiber – if consumed regularly – that would reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering blood cholesterol. Clinical research demonstrated that seven grams or more per day of soluble fiber from psyllium seed husk would sufficiently lower total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol in people with hypercholesterolemia, two accepted biomarkers for risk of coronary heart disease. The findings were later confirmed in a meta-analysis that incorporated more evidence. To be eligible for the FDA-allowed health claim, one serving of a manufactured food or dietary supplement must contain at least 1.7 g of psyllium as soluble fiber. Whole oats, barley and foods containing beta-glucan soluble fiber were included as eligible sources for the label claim.

====Type 2 diabetes====
In 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a qualified health claim for psyllium as a possible benefit for people with diabetes, requiring FDA-approved wording on a product label: &quot;Psyllium husk may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, although the FDA has concluded that there is very little scientific evidence for this claim.&quot; A meta-analysis published after the FDA decision reported that psyllium provided before meals improved fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin, but that the larger effect was seen in people diagnosed with and being treated for type 2 diabetes, and only a modest improvement for people classified as pre-diabetic.

==== Hypertension ====
A 2019 meta-analysis found that use of supplemental psyllium for 8 weeks or longer reduced blood pressure by 2 mmHg in people with hypertension.

===Lead content===
Some psyllium supplements sold in the USA have been found to contain lead, in some cases exceeding levels requiring a warning label by Proposition 65 of the U.S. state of California. In 2013, in California, a legal settlement required the manufacturer of psyllium supplements to pay US$110,000 and agree to place warning labels on products exceeding acceptable lead levels 

===Veterinary medicine===
Psyllium fiber dietary supplements are used in veterinary medicine to treat sand impaction in horses to aid in elimination of sand from the horse&#x27;s colon.

==Adverse effects==
Fiber generally has few side effects.

* Mild to moderate flatulence (gas).
* Mild to moderate abdominal distension (bloating) and abdominal pain.
* Choking is a hazard if psyllium is taken without adequate water as it thickens in the throat.
* Psyllium can cause bowel obstructions or bezoars, if taken without adequate amounts of water.

===Allergy===
Psyllium can cause allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Psyllium may act as a potent inhalant allergen capable of eliciting asthma symptoms. Health care professionals at geriatric care hospitals, who are frequently exposed to psyllium in the laxatives administered to people, are commonly IgE sensitized to psyllium (13.8%), and 8.6% have clinical allergy to psyllium. In order to protect sensitized workers, psyllium has an extremely low occupational exposure limit of 150 ng/m3.

==Cultivation==
The genus &quot;Plantago&quot; contains over 200 species. &quot;P. ovata&quot; and &quot;P. psyllium&quot; are produced commercially in several European countries, Russia and surrounding countries, and India. Plantago seed, known commercially as black, French, or Spanish psyllium, is obtained from &quot;P. psyllium&quot;, also known as &quot;P. arenaria&quot;. Seed produced from &quot;P. ovata&quot; is known in trading circles as white or blonde psyllium, Indian plantago, or isabgol. Isabgol is the common name in India for &quot;P. ovata&quot;. India dominates the world market in the production and export of psyllium.

&quot;Plantago ovata&quot; is an annual herb that grows to a height of . Leaves are opposite, linear or linear lanceolate . The root system has a well-developed tap root with few fibrous secondary roots. A large number of flowering shoots arise from the base of the plant. Flowers are numerous, small, and white. Plants flower about 60 days after planting. The seeds are enclosed in capsules that open at maturity.

The fields are generally irrigated prior to seeding to achieve ideal soil moisture, to enhance seed soil contact, and to avoid burying the seed too deeply as a result of later irrigations or rainfall. Maximum germination occurs at a seeding depth of 6 mm (1/4 in). Emerging seedlings are frost sensitive; therefore, planting should be delayed until conditions are expected to remain frost free. Seed is broadcast at 5.5 to 8.25 kg/hectare (5 to 7.5 lb/acre) in India. In Arizonan trials, seeding rates of 22 to 27.5 kg/ha (20 to 25 lb/acre) resulted in stands of 1 plant/25mm (1 inch) in 15 cm (6 inch) rows produced excellent yields. Weed control is normally achieved by one or two hand weedings early in the growing season. Control of weeds by pre-plant irrigation that germinates weed seeds followed by shallow tillage may be effective on fields with minimal weed pressure. Psyllium is a poor competitor with most weed species.

Plantago wilt (&quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot;) and downy mildew (&quot;Peronospora alta&quot;) are the major diseases of Isabgol. White grubs and aphids are the major insect pests.

The flower spikes turn reddish brown at ripening, the lower leaves dry and the upper leaves yellow. The crop is harvested in the morning after the dew is gone to minimize shattering and field losses. In India, mature plants are cut 15 cm above the ground and then bound, left for a few days to dry, thrashed, and winnowed.

Harvested seed must be dried to below 12% moisture to allow for cleaning, milling, and storage. Seed stored for future crops has shown a significant loss in viability after 2 years in storage.

==Commercial history==
===Metamucil===
Introduced in 1934 by G.D. Searle &amp; Company, Metamucil was acquired by Procter &amp; Gamble in 1985. The name is a combination of the Greek word for change (meta) and the class of fiber that it utilizes (mucilage). In its early years, Metamucil achieved sporadic drug-store distribution as a &quot;behind the counter&quot; product – sold in pharmacies but not on the shelf, so that the pharmacist may counsel the purchaser on correct usage. Since 1974, the brand was also marketed to consumers by print and TV advertising and became available in food outlets. Flavored versions were added in 1979.

The brand is sold as powdered drink mixes, capsules, gummies, and wafers in a variety of flavors. Metamucil contains psyllium seed husks as the active ingredient. It is manufactured in Phoenix, Arizona, by Procter &amp; Gamble. When first marketed to consumers in 1974, Metamucil was marketed as a laxative. The advertising slogan at that time was &quot;If not nature, then Metamucil&quot;. Procter &amp; Gamble sought to make Metamucil a household name by advertising in magazines and on television, using the claim &quot;All fiber is not created equal&quot;.

<text>British Birds is a monthly ornithology magazine that was established in 1907. It is now published by BB 2000 Ltd, which is wholly owned by The British Birds Charitable Trust (registered charity number 1089422), established for the benefit of British ornithology. Its circulation in 2000 was 5,250 copies; its circulation peaked at 11,000 in the late 1980s. The current editor is Stephen Menzie.

&quot;British Birds&quot; is aimed at serious birdwatchers and ornithologists, rather than the more casual birdwatchers catered for by some other magazines on the subject. It publishes the findings of the British Birds Rarities Committee.

Its mascot, and later logo, the red grouse, was chosen because at the time it was then considered an endemic British species; though subsequently long considered a subspecies of the willow grouse, further study resulted in it being returned to separate species status in 2024.

In 1916, &quot;British Birds&quot; magazine absorbed &quot;The Zoologist&quot;, due to the latter&#x27;s shortage of subscribers.

== Editors ==
The current editor of &quot;British Birds&quot; is Stephen Menzie.

* from volume 3 (1909), Witherby was further assisted by the Rev. F.C.R. Jourdain and Norman F. Ticehurst
* in volume 12 (1918), for one year, Jourdain was the editor, assisted by Ticehurst
* from volume 13 (1919) Witherby was back as the editor; this situation continued until volume 33 (1939), when Jourdain died.
* from volume 34 (1940) Bernard W. Tucker became assistant-editor

== Numbering ==
Before 1946, all volumes ran from June to May. Harry Witherby produced Vol.1 No.1 in June 1907 and produced 12 monthly issues per volume. It was finally decided to change with Volume 38, which ran from June 1944 to December 1945. Wartime paper restrictions meant that those issues were all pretty thin so it was possible to bind 19 into one volume.

== The digital era ==
In 2007 a DVD-ROM disk containing the first 100 years&#x27; worth of content (volumes 1–100) was released in conjunction with BirdGuides Ltd. Subsequent volumes are available as paid-for updates.

In 2010, the magazine launched a blog, Facebook group and a Twitter account.

From October 2011, the magazine&#x27;s first 100 years&#x27; of back issues are available on-line, free. More recent issues are available to subscribers to the print edition.

<doc id="348945" wikidata="Q2683571" url="?curid=348945" title="Battle of Lookout Mountain">
<text>The Battle of Lookout Mountain, also known as the Battle Above the Clouds, was fought November 24, 1863, as part of the Chattanooga Campaign of the American Civil War. Union forces under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker assaulted Lookout Mountain, Chattanooga, Tennessee, and defeated Confederate forces commanded by Maj. Gen. Carter L. Stevenson. Lookout Mountain was one engagement in the Chattanooga battles between Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Military Division of the Mississippi and the Confederate Army of Tennessee, commanded by Gen. Braxton Bragg. It drove in the Confederate left flank and allowed Hooker&#x27;s men to assist in the Battle of Missionary Ridge the following day, which routed Bragg&#x27;s army, lifting the siege of Union forces in Chattanooga, and opening the gateway into the Deep South.

==Background==
=== Military situation ===

After their disastrous defeat at the Battle of Chickamauga, the 40,000 men of the Union Army of the Cumberland under Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans retreated to Chattanooga, Tennessee. Bragg&#x27;s Army of Tennessee besieged the city, threatening to starve the Union forces into surrender. Bragg&#x27;s troops established themselves on Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain, both of which had excellent views of the city, the Tennessee River flowing through the city, and the Union&#x27;s supply lines. Lookout Mountain was actually a ridge or narrow plateau that extended southwest from the Tennessee River, culminating in a sharp point above the river. From the river the end of the mountain rose at a 45° angle and at about two thirds of the way to the summit it changed grade, forming a ledge, or &quot;bench&quot;, wide, extending for several miles around both sides of the mountain. Above the bench, the grade steepened into a face of rock called the &quot;palisades&quot;. Confederate artillery atop Lookout Mountain controlled access by the river, and Confederate cavalry launched raids on all supply wagons heading toward Chattanooga, which made it necessary for the Union to find another way to feed their men.

The Union government, alarmed by the potential for defeat, sent reinforcements. On October 17, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant received command of the Western armies, designated the Military Division of the Mississippi. He moved to reinforce Chattanooga and replaced Rosecrans with Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas.

Thomas launched a surprise amphibious landing at Brown&#x27;s Ferry on October 27 that opened the Tennessee River by linking up Thomas&#x27;s Army of the Cumberland with a relief column of 20,000 troops from the Eastern Theater&#x27;s Army of the Potomac, led by Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker. Supplies and reinforcements were thus able to flow into Chattanooga over the &quot;Cracker Line&quot;, greatly increasing the chances for Grant&#x27;s forces. In response, Bragg ordered Lt. Gen. James Longstreet to force the Federals out of Lookout Valley, directly to the west of Lookout Mountain. The ensuing Battle of Wauhatchie (October 28–29) was one of the war&#x27;s few battles fought exclusively at night. The Confederates were repulsed, and the Cracker Line was secured.

On November 12, Bragg placed Maj. Gen. Carter L. Stevenson in overall command for the defense of the mountain, with Stevenson&#x27;s own division positioned on the summit. The brigades of Brig. Gens. John K. Jackson, Edward C. Walthall, and John C. Moore were placed on the bench of the mountain. Jackson later wrote about the dissatisfaction of the commanders assigned to this area, &quot;Indeed, it was agreed on all hands that the position was one extremely difficult to defense against a strong force of the enemy advancing under cover of a heavy fire.&quot; Thomas L. Connelly, historian of the Army of Tennessee, wrote that despite the imposing appearance of Lookout Mountain, &quot;the mountain&#x27;s strength was a myth. ... It was impossible to hold [the bench, which] was commanded by Federal artillery at Moccasin Bend.&quot; Although Stevenson placed an artillery battery on the crest of the mountain, the guns could not be depressed enough to reach the bench, which was accessible from numerous trails on the west side of the mountain.

Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman arrived from Vicksburg, Mississippi, with his 20,000 men of the Army of the Tennessee in mid-November. Grant, Sherman, and Thomas planned a double envelopment of Bragg&#x27;s force, with the main attack by Sherman against the northern end of Missionary Ridge, supported by Thomas in the center and by Hooker, who would capture Lookout Mountain and then move across the Chattanooga Valley to Rossville, Georgia, and cut off the Confederate retreat route to the south. Grant subsequently withdrew his support for a major attack by Hooker on Lookout Mountain, intending the mass of his attack to be by Sherman.

On November 23, Sherman&#x27;s force was ready to cross the Tennessee River. Grant ordered Thomas to advance halfway to Missionary Ridge on a reconnaissance in force to determine the strength of the Confederate line, hoping to ensure that Bragg would not withdraw his forces and move in the direction of Knoxville, Tennessee, where Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside was being threatened by a Confederate force under Longstreet. Thomas sent over 14,000 men toward a minor hill named Orchard Knob and overran the Confederate defenders.

Surprised by Thomas&#x27;s move against Orchard Knob on November 23, and realizing that his center might be more vulnerable than he had thought, Bragg quickly readjusted his strategy. He recalled all units within a day&#x27;s march that he had recently ordered to Knoxville. He began to reduce the strength on his left by withdrawing Maj. Gen. William H.T. Walker&#x27;s division from the base of Lookout Mountain and placing them on the far right of Missionary Ridge. He assigned Hardee to command his now critical right flank, turning over the left flank to Carter Stevenson. Stevenson needed to fill the gap left by Walker&#x27;s division from the mountain to Chattanooga Creek, so he sent Jackson&#x27;s brigade of Cheatham&#x27;s Division and Cummings&#x27; brigade of his own division into that position. (Jackson himself continued as temporary division commander on the mountain.) Stevenson deployed Walthall&#x27;s brigade of 1,500 Mississippians as pickets near the base of the mountain, withholding enough for a reserve for Moore&#x27;s brigade, which would defend the main line on the bench near the Cravens house.

The Union side also changed plans. Sherman had three divisions ready to cross the Tennessee, but the pontoon bridge at Brown&#x27;s Ferry had torn apart and Brig. Gen. Peter J. Osterhaus&#x27;s division was stranded in Lookout Valley. After receiving assurances from Sherman that he could proceed with three divisions, Grant decided to revive the previously rejected plan for an attack on Lookout Mountain and reassigned Osterhaus to Hooker&#x27;s command.

==Opposing forces==
===Union===

Grant&#x27;s Military Division of the Mississippi assembled the following forces at Chattanooga:
* The Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas.
* The Army of the Tennessee, commanded by Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman.
* The command of Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, consisting of the XI Corps under Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard and the 2nd Division of the XII Corps under Brig. Gen. John W. Geary.

Hooker commanded the 10,000-man Union force engaged at the Battle of Lookout Mountain, which included three divisions, one from each of the Union armies, commanded by:
* Brig. Gen. John W. Geary from the XII Corps, Army of the Potomac. The brigade commanders were Cols. Charles Candy, George A. Cobham, and David Ireland (replacing Brig. Gen. George S. Greene, wounded at Wauhatchie).
* Brig. Gen. Charles Cruft from the IV Corps, Army of the Cumberland. The brigade commanders were Brig. Gen. Walter C. Whitaker and Col. William Grose.
* Brig. Gen. Peter J. Osterhaus from the XV corps, Army of the Tennessee. The brigade commanders were Brig. Gen. Charles R. Woods and Col. James A. Williamson.

===Confederate===

Bragg&#x27;s Army of Tennessee had the following forces available in Chattanooga:
* Hardee&#x27;s Corps, under Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee, consisting of the divisions under Brig. Gen. John K. Jackson (Cheatham&#x27;s Division), Brig. Gen. J. Patton Anderson (Hindman&#x27;s Division), Brig. Gen. States Rights Gist (Walker&#x27;s Division), and Maj. Gen. Simon B. Buckner (detached November 22 to Knoxville).
* Breckinridge&#x27;s Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge, consisting of the divisions of Maj. Gens. Patrick R. Cleburne, Alexander P. Stewart, Carter L. Stevenson, and Brig. Gen. William B. Bate (Breckinridge&#x27;s Division).

The 8,726 Confederate defenders at the Battle of Lookout Mountain were commanded by Maj. Gen. Carter L. Stevenson. Stevenson had two brigades from his own division of Breckinridge&#x27;s Corps, as well as Brig. Gen. John K. Jackson, temporarily commanding Cheatham&#x27;s division of Hardee&#x27;s Corps, with two of his brigades:
* Brig. Gen. Edward C. Walthall (Cheatham&#x27;s Division)
* Brig. Gen. John C. Moore (Cheatham&#x27;s Division)
* Brig. Gen. John C. Brown (Stevenson&#x27;s Division)
* Brig. Gen. Edmund Pettus (Stevenson&#x27;s Division)

==Battle==
On November 24, Hooker had about 10,000 men in three divisions to operate against Lookout Mountain. Acknowledging that this was too large a force for a simple diversion, &quot;Grant finally acceded to Thomas&#x27;s persistent demand that a more serious effort be made.&quot; Hooker was ordered to &quot;take the point only if his demonstration should develop its practicability.&quot; Hooker ignored this subtlety and at 3 a.m. on November 24 ordered Geary &quot;to cross Lookout Creek and to assault Lookout Mountain, marching down the valley and sweeping every rebel from it.&quot;

Hooker did not plan to attack Stevenson&#x27;s Division on the top of the mountain, assuming that capturing the bench would make Stevenson&#x27;s position untenable. His force would approach the bench from two directions: Whitaker&#x27;s brigade would link up with Geary at Wauhatchie, while Grose&#x27;s brigade and Osterhaus&#x27;s division would cross Lookout Creek to the southeast. Both forces would meet near the Cravens house. Osterhaus&#x27;s division was in support: Woods&#x27;s brigade was assigned to cover Grose and cross the creek after him; Williamson&#x27;s brigade was assigned to protect Hooker&#x27;s artillery near the mouth of Lookout Creek.

Hooker arranged an impressive array of artillery to scatter the Confederate pickets and cover his advance. He had nine batteries set up near the mouth of Lookout Creek, two batteries from the Army of the Cumberland on Moccasin Point, and two additional batteries near Chattanooga Creek.

Geary&#x27;s expected dawn crossing of Lookout Creek was delayed by high water until 8:30 a.m. First to cross the footbridge was Cobham&#x27;s brigade, followed by Ireland&#x27;s, which formed to Cobham&#x27;s left and became the center of Geary&#x27;s battle line. Candy&#x27;s brigade then extended the Union left down to the base of the mountain. Whitaker&#x27;s brigade followed in the rear. From 9:30 to 10:30 a.m, Geary&#x27;s skirmishers advanced through the fog and mist that obscured the mountain. Contact was made with Walthall&#x27;s pickets 1 mile southwest of Lookout Point. The Confederates were significantly outnumbered and could not resist the pressure, falling back but leaving a number behind to surrender. Hooker ordered an artillery bombardment to saturate the Confederate line of retreat, but the effect was minimized because of poor visibility and the fact that the two forces were almost on top of each other.
The Union pursuit of the skirmishers was halted around 11:30 a.m. 300 yards southwest the point when Ireland and Cobham encountered Walthall&#x27;s reserve southwest of the Cravens house. The two Confederate regiments repulsed Ireland&#x27;s first attempt at assaulting their fieldworks. A second assault succeeded, enveloping and outnumbering the Confederates 4 to 1. Despite Walthall&#x27;s attempt to rally his men, he could not prevent a disorderly retreat back toward the Cravens house. The Union brigades kept up their pursuit past the point and along the bench.

As Geary&#x27;s men appeared below the point around noon, Candy&#x27;s brigade advanced across the lower elevations of the mountain, clearing the enemy from the east bank of Lookout Creek. Hooker ordered Woods&#x27;s and Grose&#x27;s brigades to begin crossing the foot bridge over the creek. Woods moved east at the base of the mountain, Grose moved up the slope. These movements isolated part of Walthall&#x27;s Brigade and the entire 34th Mississippi was forced to surrender, along with 200 men from Moore&#x27;s picket line.
Moore was reluctant to take action. At 9:30 he had sent a message to Jackson asking where he should deploy his brigade and Jackson&#x27;s reply at 11 a.m. expressed his frustration that Moore had seemingly forgotten the plan to defend the line at the Cravens house. Peter Cozzens criticized Jackson&#x27;s poor performance in leading the defense:

When Stevenson heard the fighting between Walthall and Geary, he ordered Pettus to take three regiments from the summit to assist Jackson. By this time, Moore&#x27;s Alabamians were moving up amidst Walthall&#x27;s retreating men, and they fired on Ireland&#x27;s New Yorkers from 100 yards. Unable to see the size of the force resisting it through the fog, the Union men retreated beyond a stone wall. Moore&#x27;s 1,000 men took positions in the rifle pits facing the wall and waited for the inevitable counterattack. Ireland&#x27;s men were too exhausted to make an immediate move. As Whitaker&#x27;s brigade arrived after 1 p.m., they stepped over Ireland&#x27;s men and rushed into the attack. Candy&#x27;s brigade was moving up the mountain side on Whitaker&#x27;s left, followed by the brigades of Woods and Grose. Moore could see that he was being significantly outflanked on the right and chose to fall back rather than be surrounded.

All of the Union brigades, including Ireland&#x27;s tired men, began the pursuit. Hooker was concerned that his lines were becoming intermingled and confused by the fog and the rugged ground and they were tempting defeat if the Confederates brought up reinforcements in the right place. He ordered Geary to halt for the day, but Geary was too far behind his troops to stop them. Hooker wrote, &quot;Fired by success, with a flying, panic-stricken enemy before them, they pressed impetuously forward.&quot;

Moore&#x27;s brigade was able to escape in the fog and Walthall had adequate time to form a rough defensive line 3–400 yards south of the Cravens house. His 600 men took cover behind boulders and fallen trees and made enough of a racket to dissuade Whitaker&#x27;s men from moving against them. By this time Pettus&#x27;s brigade of three Alabama regiments had descended from the summit and came to Walthall&#x27;s assistance after 2 p.m.

Hooker sent to Grant alternating messages of panic and bluster. At 1:25 p.m., he wrote that the &quot;conduct of all the troops has been brilliant, and the success has far exceeded my expectations. Our loss has not been severe, and of prisoners I should judge that we had not less than 2,000.&quot; At around 3 p.m., he wrote &quot;Can hold the line I am now on; can&#x27;t advance. Some of my troops out of ammunition; can&#x27;t replenish.&quot; Responding to a plaintive message sent from Whitaker, General Thomas approved the transfer of Brig. Gen. William P. Carlin&#x27;s brigade (XIV Corps) to aid Hooker. (Carlin was delayed for hours attempting to cross the river and reported to Geary at 7 p.m., playing no role in the combat.) But by sunset, a confident Hooker informed Grant that he intended to move into Chattanooga Valley as soon as the fog lifted. He signaled &quot;In all probability the enemy will evacuate tonight. His line of retreat is seriously threatened by my troops.&quot;

Bragg responded to a request by Stevenson for reinforcements by sending Col. J.T. Holtzclaw&#x27;s brigade under the condition that it be used only to cover a Confederate withdrawal from Lookout Mountain, ordering Stevenson at 2:30 p.m. to withdraw to the east side of Chattanooga Creek. Stevenson was reluctant to break contact until his troops on the summit could escape on the Summertown Road into the Chattanooga Valley. The brigades of Walthall, Pettus, and Moore were ordered to hold on for the rest of the afternoon. For hours through the afternoon and into the night, the six Alabama regiments under Pettus and Moore fought sporadically with the Union troops through dense fog, neither side able to see more than a few dozen yards ahead nor make any progress in either direction.

==Aftermath==
By midnight, Lookout Mountain was quiet. Pettus and Holtzclaw received orders at 2 a.m. to march off the mountain. Postwar writings of both Union and Confederate veterans refer to a brilliant moon, which slipped into the blackness of a total lunar eclipse, screening the Confederate withdrawal. That night Bragg, stunned by the defeat on Lookout Mountain, asked his two corps commanders whether to retreat from Chattanooga or to stand and fight. Hardee counseled retreat, but Breckinridge convinced Bragg to fight it out on the strong position of Missionary Ridge. Accordingly, the troops withdrawn from Lookout Mountain were ordered to the left flank of Bragg&#x27;s army.

On November 25, Hooker&#x27;s men encountered difficulty rebuilding the burned bridges over Chattanooga Creek and were delayed in their movement toward the left flank of Bragg&#x27;s remaining forces on Missionary Ridge. They reached the Rossville Gap as Thomas&#x27;s men were sweeping over Missionary Ridge. Hooker faced his three divisions to the north and drove into Bragg&#x27;s flank, furthering the disruption of the Confederate line, sending the Army of Tennessee into full retreat. Hooker continued his role in the campaign with his unsuccessful pursuit of the Confederates that was beaten back at the Battle of Ringgold Gap.

Casualties for the Battle of Lookout Mountain were relatively light by the standards of the Civil War: 671 Union, 1,251 Confederate (including 1,064 captured or missing). Sylvanus Cadwallader, a war reporter accompanying Grant&#x27;s army, wrote that it was more like a &quot;magnificent skirmish&quot;, than a major battle. General Grant, whose focus was on the northern end of Missionary Ridge—and who was usually partial to the achievements of his key subordinates in the Western armies—later denigrated Hooker&#x27;s achievement, writing in his memoirs, &quot;The battle of Lookout Mountain is one of the romances of the war. There was no such battle and no action even worthy to be called the battle on Lookout Mountain. It is all poetry.&quot; Nevertheless, the action was important in assuring control of the Tennessee River and the railroad into Chattanooga and endangering the entire Confederate line on Missionary Ridge. Brig. Gen. Montgomery C. Meigs, quartermaster general of the Union Army, observing the fog-shrouded action from Orchard Knob, was the first writer to name it the &quot;Battle Above the Clouds&quot;.

Portions of the Lookout Mountain battlefield are preserved by the National Park Service as part of the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park.

<doc id="348946" wikidata="Q3140440" url="?curid=348946" title="Horace Alexander">
<text>Horace Gundry Alexander (18 April 1889 – 30 September 1989) was an English Quaker teacher, writer, pacifist and ornithologist. He was the youngest of four sons of Joseph Gundry Alexander (1848–1918), two other sons being the ornithologists Wilfred Backhouse Alexander and Christopher James Alexander (1887–1917). He was a friend of Mahatma Gandhi.

==Life and work==
Horace was born on 18 April 1889 in Croydon, Surrey. His father, Joseph Gundry Alexander (1848–1918), was an eminent lawyer, who had worked to suppress the opium trade between India and China. His mother was Josephine Crosfield Alexander. His early schooling was at Bootham School in York, after which he studied history at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge and graduated in 1912. When the First World War broke out in 1914, he served as secretary on various anti-war committees. In 1916, as a conscientious objector, he was initially exempted only from combatant military service, but after two levels of appeal he was exempted on condition of teaching, which he took up via General Service with the Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit, holding posts at Sibford School, Warwick School and Cranbrook School, Kent.

Alexander married Olive Graham (1892–1942) on 20 July 1918 and joined the staff of Woodbrooke, a Quaker college in Birmingham, teaching international relations, especially in relation to the League of Nations, from 1919 to 1944. His wife died in 1942, having used a wheelchair for several years. That year Alexander joined a section of the World War II Friends Ambulance Unit and went to parts of India that were threatened by Japan. In 1958, he married Rebecca Bradbeer (née Biddle, 1901–1991), an American Quaker. After ten years they moved to Pennsylvania, United States, where he spent the remaining twenty years of his life. He was also, for its first ten years, a governor of Leighton Park School, a leading Quaker school in England. He died of a gastrointestinal illness at Crosslands, a Quaker retirement community in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania.

==Ornithology==
Alexander was a lifelong, dedicated and gifted birdwatcher, keenly involved in the 20th-century movements for the protection and observation of birds. He and two of his older brothers, Wilfred and Christopher, he took a keen interest in nature. Growing up in a Quaker home devoid of any other forms of entertainment, his interest in birds began at the age of eight, when his older brother Gilbert gave him a book on natural history. In his autobiography he traced the beginnings of this interest in birds to 8.45 am on 25 March 1897, when an uncle pointed out a singing chiffchaff in their garden. It was not until he was 20 that he obtained his first pair of binoculars. He was one of a small group of amateur birdwatchers who developed skills and set new standards for combining the pleasures of birdwatching with the satisfaction of contributing to ornithological science. He made many significant observations, mainly in Britain, but also in India and the United States.

Alexander spent most of his time in India and became interested in its birds in 1927. Ornithology at that time was not popular among Indians in India, and when Horace informed Gandhi of an expedition, Gandhi commented, &quot;That is a good hobby, provided you don&#x27;t shoot them.&quot; Horace demonstrated the use of binoculars as an acceptable alternative to the gun and carried them at most times. Horace Alexander joined Sidney Dillon Ripley on an expedition to the Naga Hills in 1950. Ripley named a subspecies of the aberrant bush warbler after Alexander, although this is no longer recognised. In the same year he founded the Delhi Birdwatching Society, along with Lt. Gen. Harold Williams. One early member of the organisation was the young Indira Gandhi, and the group encouraged Indian ornithologists such as Usha Ganguli. Many of his notes were mislaid when one of his suitcases was lost in India in 1946. Through his influence on Jawaharlal Nehru, he was instrumental in the designation of the Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary near Delhi.

Alexander was also a founder member, in 1929, of the West Midland Bird Club (then the Birmingham Bird Club), and its president, during his long residence in Birmingham, England.

==Mohandas Gandhi==
Alexander&#x27;s father-in-law, John William Graham, believed that Gandhi was a subversive and that the Indians were unprepared for self-government. At the Quaker yearly meeting in 1930 the Nobel Prize-winning poet Rabindranath Tagore attacked colonial rule in India. The Quakers were disturbed by the address and John Graham was particularly outraged. Afterwards it was agreed that a representative would be sent to India to attempt a reconciliation between the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, and Gandhi. This task was assigned to Horace Alexander, who first met Gandhi in March 1928. He made it possible for Gandhi to attend the 1931 round-table conference in London. After the conference he founded the India Conciliation Group along with Agatha Harrison and Carl Heath. Becoming a close friend of Gandhi (who, in 1942, described Alexander as &quot;one of the best English friends India has&quot;), he wrote extensively about Gandhi&#x27;s philosophy. In 1947 he attempted to intervene to control the violence between Muslims and Hindus and was beside Gandhi in Calcutta on 15 August 1947.

He was consulted by Richard Attenborough in the making of the 1982 film &quot;Gandhi&quot;. However, he felt that the scripts did not do justice to the people around Gandhi.

In 1984 he was awarded the Padma Bhushan medal, the highest honour given to a non-Indian civilian.

Alexander made several appearances as a presenter on BBC Radio:

<doc id="348948" wikidata="Q241031" url="?curid=348948" title="James Bond (ornithologist)">
<text>James Bond (January 4, 1900 – February 14, 1989) was an American ornithologist and expert on the birds of the Caribbean, having written the definitive book on the subject: &quot;Birds of the West Indies&quot;, first published in 1936. He served as a curator of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. His name was appropriated by writer Ian Fleming for his fictional British spy of the same name; the real Bond enjoyed knowing his name was being used this way, and references to him permeate the resulting media franchise.

==Life and career==
Bond was born on January 4, 1900, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Margaret Reeves ( Tyson) and Francis Edward Bond. His interest in natural history was spurred by an expedition his father undertook in 1911 to the Orinoco Delta. Bond was educated at the Delancey School followed by St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire, but after the death of his mother he moved with his father to the United Kingdom in 1914. There, he studied at Harrow and later Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained a B.A. in 1922 and was the sole American member of the Pitt Club.

After graduating he moved back to the United States and worked for a banking firm for three years in Philadelphia. An interest in natural history prompted him to quit, and along with Rodolphe Meyer de Schauensee, took out a loan to set out on an expedition to the Amazon to collect specimens for the Academy of Natural Sciences.

Subsequently, he worked as an ornithologist at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, rising to become curator of ornithology there. He was an expert in Caribbean birds and wrote the definitive book on the subject: &quot;Birds of the West Indies&quot;, first published in 1936. From the 1920s to the 1960s, he took dozens of birding explorations to the West Indies.

Bond won the Institute of Jamaica&#x27;s Musgrave Medal in 1952; the Brewster Medal of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union in 1954; and the Leidy Award of the Academy of Natural Sciences in 1975. He died in the Chestnut Hill Hospital in Philadelphia at age 89. He is interred in the church yard at Church of the Messiah in Gwynedd Valley, Pennsylvania. Bond&#x27;s wife, the author Mary Fanning Wickham Bond née Porcher, who wrote several memoirs about her husband, died in 1997.

==Works==
One of Bond&#x27;s early works in ornithology was through his maternal uncle Carroll Sargent Tyson Jr. (1878–1956). After the death of his mother, Bond spent time with his uncle, out in the outdoors in Mount Desert Island, Maine. In 1916, Tyson was prompted, inspired by Audubon&#x27;s works, to produce large folios of the birds of Maine. Bond collected specimens of birds for his uncle to paint. This resulted in the production of 250 copies of the book &quot;The Birds of Mt. Desert Island&quot; (1941) with 20 chromolithographs.

Bond&#x27;s most enduring work was his guide to the &quot;Birds of the West Indies&quot; which was first published in 1936 and went into 11 editions during his lifetime. He published nearly 150 papers in various journals including descriptions of 63 new subspecies. 

James Bond noted that the distribution of hutias was limited by what he thought may have been a marine boundary. In 1973 David Lack proposed that this be called Bond&#x27;s Line, a biogeographical boundary between Tobago and the Lesser Antilles that also divided birds of North and South American origin. In 2015 a new subspecies of hutia was described as &quot;Plagiodontia aedium bondi&quot; and named after Bond for his recognition of the biogeographical divide.

==Fictional namesake==

Ian Fleming, who was a keen bird watcher living in Jamaica, was familiar with Bond&#x27;s book, and chose the name of its author for the hero of &quot;Casino Royale&quot; in 1953, apparently because he wanted a name that sounded &quot;as ordinary as possible&quot;. Fleming wrote to the real Bond&#x27;s wife, &quot;It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born.&quot; He did not contact the real James Bond about using his name in the books, and Bond did not learn of Fleming&#x27;s character until the early 1960s, when Fleming&#x27;s James Bond books became popular in the U.S. In 1964 during Fleming&#x27;s annual winter stay at Goldeneye in Jamaica, James Bond and his wife visited Fleming unexpectedly. In his novel &quot;Dr. No&quot; Fleming referenced Bond&#x27;s work by basing a large ornithological sanctuary on Dr. No&#x27;s island in the Bahamas. In 1964, Fleming gave Bond a first edition copy of &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; signed, &quot;To the real James Bond, from the thief of his identity&quot;. In December 2008 the book was put up for auction, eventually fetching $84,000 (£56,000).

James Bond&#x27;s wife told Fleming that her husband saw the use of his name for the character as a good joke, to which Fleming replied &quot;I can only offer your James Bond unlimited use of the name Ian Fleming...Perhaps one day he will discover some particularly horrible species of bird which he would like to christen in an insulting fashion.&quot;

In 1966, James Bond&#x27;s wife, Mary Fanning Wickham Bond, published a small book, &quot;How 007 Got His Name&quot;. It details her husband&#x27;s life and discovery of the appropriation of his name along with their meeting Ian Fleming and the Hilary Brays at Goldeneye on February 5, 1964. By happenstance, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was filming an interview that day.

The story of James Bond and his wife, Mary Fanning Wickham Bond, discovering Ian Fleming&#x27;s theft of the name, before contacting and meeting Fleming at Goldeneye is told in the 2022 documentary &quot;The Other Fellow&quot;. The film chronicles the lives of several men named James Bond and shows a film, not previously broadcast, of the Bonds meeting Fleming, as well as interviews with James and Mary that were discovered by the film&#x27;s director Matthew Bauer.

In the 2002 Bond film &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, the fictional Bond, played by Pierce Brosnan, can be seen examining &quot;Birds of the West Indies&quot; in an early scene that takes place in Havana, Cuba. The author&#x27;s name on the front cover is obscured. In the same film, when Bond first meets Jinx (Halle Berry), he introduces himself as an ornithologist. In the 2015 Bond film &quot;Spectre&quot;, the same book was seen in a promotional on-set photo, which is supposed to be appearing in an alternate take of a scene taking place in Bond&#x27;s Chelsea apartment, though this is not in the final film.

In the ITV Miss Marple murder mystery &quot;A Caribbean Mystery&quot;, broadcast on 16 June 2013, Miss Marple meets Ian Fleming at a talk on &quot;Birds of the West Indies&quot;, given by James Bond. Before the talk begins, Fleming tells Miss Marple that he&#x27;s working on a new book, but trying to come up with a name for the character. When the speaker introduced himself, Fleming has a moment of inspiration and reaches for his notebook, as the first few bars of the film theme play. The talk by the ornithologist James Bond is on guano which figures in the background and plot of the James Bond spy novel &quot;Dr. No&quot;. This instance of James Bond was played by Charlie Higson, who wrote the &quot;Young Bond&quot; novels.

<text>The , or , is an inland region on central Honshū in Japan. It forms the central part of the Chūbu region.
It comprises most of Nagano and Yamanashi Prefectures, as well as the Hida area of Gifu Prefecture. Sometimes Tōnō area of Gifu Prefecture is included.

The humid continental climate of the region gives large temperature differences between summers and winters, and between days and nights. Precipitation is light throughout the year. The more northern and western portions of this region tend to experience heavy snow during the winter with lower daytime temperatures resembling parts of Northern Japan and Hokkaido more so than its neighbor prefectures.

In the Edo period, the Nakasendō and Kōshū Kaidō ran through the Central Highland.

== Geography ==
The region is known for its various mountains and geological features, and is most well known for Mount Fuji, the tallest mountain in Japan.

* Mountain Ranges: Akaishi Mountains, Hida Mountains, Kiso Mountains, Yatsugatake Mountains
* Mountains: Mount Fuji, Mount Tateshina, Mount Yari, Mount Hotakadake, Mount Yake, Mount Norikura, Mount Ontake, Mount Akaishi, Mount Shirouma, Mount Asama
* Basins: Kiso Valley, Kofu Basin, Suwa Basin, Matsumoto Basin, Ina Basin, &quot;Ueda Basin, Saku Basin, Nagano Basin&quot;
* Plateau: Kirigamine, &quot;Sugadaira&quot; Plateau
* Lakes: Lake Suwa, Lake Aoki, Lake Shirakaba
* Rivers : Fuefuki River, Fuji River, Tenryū River, Kiso River, Shinano River
* Onsen: Kamisuwa Onsen, &quot;Bessho Onsen&quot;

<text>The of the Japanese language fall into two primary clades, Eastern (including modern capital Tokyo) and Western (including old capital Kyoto), with the dialects of Kyushu and Hachijō Island often distinguished as additional branches, the latter perhaps the most divergent of all. The Ryukyuan languages of Okinawa Prefecture and the southern islands of Kagoshima Prefecture form a separate branch of the Japonic family, and are not Japanese dialects, although they are sometimes referred to as such.

The setting of Japan with its numerous islands and mountains has the ideal setting for developing many dialects.

==History==
Regional variants of Japanese have been confirmed since the Old Japanese era. The &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, the oldest existing collection of Japanese poetry, includes poems written in dialects of the capital (Nara) and eastern Japan, but other dialects were not recorded. The compiler included &quot;azuma uta&quot; (&quot;eastern songs&quot;) that show that eastern dialect traits were distinct from the western dialect of Nara. It is not clear if the capital of Nara entertained the idea of a standard dialect, however, they had an understanding which dialect should be regarded as the standard one, the dialect of the capital.

The recorded features of eastern dialects were rarely inherited by modern dialects, except for a few language islands such as Hachijo Island. In the Early Middle Japanese era, there were only vague records such as &quot;rural dialects are crude&quot;. However, since the Late Middle Japanese era, features of regional dialects had been recorded in some books, for example &quot;Arte da Lingoa de Iapam&quot;, and the recorded features were fairly similar to modern dialects. In these works, recorded by the Christian missionaries in Japan, they regard the true colloquial Japanese as the one used by the court nobles in Kyōto. Other indications for the Kyōto dialect to be considered the standard dialect at that time are glossaries of local dialects that list the Kyōto equivalent for local expressions.

The variety of Japanese dialects developed markedly during the Early Modern Japanese era (Edo period) because many feudal lords restricted the movement of people to and from other fiefs. Some isoglosses agree with old borders of &quot;han&quot;, especially in Tohoku and Kyushu. Nevertheless, even with the political capital being moved to Edo (i.e. Tōkyō) the status of the Kyōto dialect was not threatened immediately as it was still the cultural and economic center that dominated Japan. This dominance waned as Edo began to assert more political and economic force and made investments in its cultural development. At the end of the eighteen century the Japanese that was spoken in Edo was regarded as standard as all glossaries from this period use the Edo dialect for local expressions.

In the Meiji period the Tōkyō dialect was assuming the role of a standard dialect that was used between different regions to communicate with each other. The Meiji government set policies in place to spread the concept of . One of the main goals was to be an equal to the western world and the unification of the language was a part to achieve this. For the &quot;hyōjun-go&quot; the speech of the Tōkyō middle class served as a model. The Ministry of Education at this time made text books in the new standard language and fostered an inferiority complex in the minds of those who spoke in dialects besides the Tōkyō dialect. One example is a student who was forced to wear a &quot;dialect tag&quot; around the neck. 
From the 1940s to the 1960s, the period of Shōwa nationalism and the post-war economic miracle, the push for the replacement of regional varieties with Standard Japanese reached its peak.

After World War II, the concept of was introduced that differed from the concept of the standard language in so far that it is heavily influenced by the standard language but it retains dialectical traits. So the spoken language can differ from region to region but it is still mutually intelligible.

Now Standard Japanese has spread throughout the nation, and traditional regional varieties are declining because of education, television, expansion of traffic, urban concentration etc. However, regional varieties have not been completely replaced with Standard Japanese. The spread of Standard Japanese means the regional varieties are now valued as &quot;nostalgic&quot;, &quot;heart-warming&quot; and markers of &quot;precious local identity&quot;, and many speakers of regional dialects have gradually overcome their sense of inferiority regarding their natural way of speaking. The contact between regional varieties and Standard Japanese creates new regional speech forms among young people, such as Okinawan Japanese.

==Mutual intelligibility==
In terms of mutual intelligibility, a survey in 1967 found the four most unintelligible dialects (excluding Ryūkyūan languages and Tohoku dialects) to students from Greater Tokyo are the Kiso dialect (in the deep mountains of Nagano Prefecture), the Himi dialect (in Toyama Prefecture), the Kagoshima dialect and the Maniwa dialect (in the mountains of Okayama Prefecture). The survey is based on recordings of 12- to 20- second long, of 135 to 244 phonemes, which 42 students listened and translated word-by-word. The listeners were all Keio University students who grew up in the Kanto region.

==Classification==

There are several generally similar approaches to classifying Japanese dialects. Misao Tōjō classified mainland Japanese dialects into three groups: Eastern, Western and Kyūshū dialects. Mitsuo Okumura classified Kyushu dialects as a subclass of Western Japanese. These theories are mainly based on grammatical differences between east and west, but Haruhiko Kindaichi classified mainland Japanese into concentric circular three groups: inside (Kansai, Shikoku, etc.), middle (Western Kantō, Chūbu, Chūgoku, etc.) and outside (Eastern Kantō, Tōhoku, Izumo, Kyushu, Hachijō, etc.) based on systems of accent, phoneme and conjugation.

===Eastern and Western Japanese===
A primary distinction exists between Eastern and Western Japanese. This is a long-standing divide that occurs in both language and culture. Tokugawa points out the distinct eating habits, shapes of tools and utensils. One example is the kind of fish eaten in both areas. While the Eastern region eats more salmon, the West consumes more seabream.

The map in the box at the top of this page divides the two along phonological lines. West of the dividing line, the more complex Kansai-type pitch accent is found; east of the line, the simpler Tokyo-type accent is found, though Tokyo-type accents also occur further west, on the other side of Kansai. However, this isogloss largely corresponds to several grammatical distinctions as well: West of the pitch-accent isogloss:

* The perfective form of &quot;-u&quot; verbs such as &quot;harau&quot; &#x27;to pay&#x27; is &quot;harōta&quot; (or minority &quot;haruta&quot;), showing u-onbin, rather than Eastern (and Standard) &quot;haratta&quot;
** The perfective form of &quot;-su&quot; verbs such as &quot;otosu&quot; &#x27;to drop&#x27; is also &quot;otoita&quot; in Western Japanese (largely apart from Kansai dialect) vs. &quot;otoshita&quot; in Eastern
* The imperative of &quot;-ru (ichidan)&quot; verbs such as &quot;miru&quot; &#x27;to look&#x27; is &quot;miyo&quot; or &quot;mii&quot; rather than Eastern &quot;miro&quot; (or minority &quot;mire&quot;, though Kyushu dialect also uses &quot;miro&quot; or &quot;mire&quot;)
* The adverbial form of &quot;-i&quot; adjectival verbs such as &quot;hiroi&quot; &#x27;wide&#x27; is &quot;hirō&quot; (or minority &quot;hirū&quot;), showing u-onbin, for example &quot;hirōnaru&quot; (to become wide), rather than Eastern &quot;hiroku&quot;, for example &quot;hirokunaru&quot; (to become wide)
* The negative form of verbs is &quot;-nu&quot; or &quot;-n&quot; rather than &quot;-nai&quot; or &quot;-nee&quot;, and uses a different verb stem; thus &quot;suru&quot; &#x27;to do&#x27; is &quot;senu&quot; or &quot;sen&quot; rather than &quot;shinai&quot; or &quot;shinee&quot; (apart from Sado Island, which uses &quot;shinai&quot;)
* The copula is &quot;da&quot; in Eastern and &quot;ja&quot; or &quot;ya&quot; in Western Japanese, though Sado as well as some dialects further west such as San&#x27;in use &quot;da&quot; [see map at right]
* The verb &quot;iru&quot; &#x27;to exist&#x27; in Eastern and &quot;oru&quot; in Western, though Wakayama dialect uses &quot;aru&quot; and some Kansai and Fukui subdialects use both
While these grammatical isoglosses are close to the pitch-accent line given in the map, they do not follow it exactly. Apart from Sado Island, which has Eastern &quot;shinai&quot; and &quot;da&quot;, all of the Western features are found west of the pitch-accent line, though a few Eastern features may crop up again further west (&quot;da&quot; in San&#x27;in, &quot;miro&quot; in Kyushu). East of the line, however, there is a zone of intermediate dialects which have a mixture of Eastern and Western features. Echigo dialect has &quot;harōta&quot;, though not &quot;miyo&quot;, and about half of it has &quot;hirōnaru&quot; as well. In Gifu, all Western features are found apart from pitch accent and &quot;harōta&quot;; Aichi has &quot;miyo&quot; and &quot;sen&quot;, and in the west (Nagoya dialect) &quot;hirōnaru&quot; as well: These features are substantial enough that Toshio Tsuzuku classifies Gifu–Aichi dialect as Western Japanese. Western Shizuoka (Enshū dialect) has &quot;miyo&quot; as its single Western Japanese feature.

The Western Japanese Kansai dialect was the prestige dialect when Kyoto was the capital, and Western forms are found in literary language as well as in honorific expressions of modern Tokyo dialect (and therefore Standard Japanese), such as adverbial &quot;ohayō gozaimasu&quot; (not &quot;*ohayaku&quot;), the humble existential verb &quot;oru&quot;, and the polite negative &quot;-masen&quot; (not &quot;*-mashinai&quot;), which uses the Kyoto-style negative ending -n. Because the imperial court, which put emphasis on correct polite speech, was located in Kyoto for a long time, there was greater development of honorific speech forms in Kyoto, which were borrowed into Tokyo speech. Another feature that the modern Tokyo dialect shares with Kyoto is the preservation of the vowel sequences , , and : in Eastern dialects, these tend to undergo coalescence and be replaced by , and respectively. Examples of words that originated in Kyoto and were adopted by Tokyo are &quot;yaru&quot; (&quot;to give&quot;), &quot;kaminari&quot; (&quot;thunder&quot;) and &quot;asatte&quot; (&quot;two days from today&quot;).

===Kyushu Japanese===
Kyushu dialects are classified into three groups, Hichiku dialect, Hōnichi dialect and Satsugu (Kagoshima) dialect, and have several distinctive features:

*as noted above, Eastern-style imperatives &quot;miro ~ mire&quot; rather than Western Japanese &quot;miyo&quot;
*&quot;ka&quot;-adjectives in Hichiku and Satsugu rather than Western and Eastern &quot;i&quot;-adjectives, as in &quot;samuka&quot; for &quot;samui&quot; &#x27;cold&#x27;, &quot;kuyaka&quot; for &quot;minikui&quot; &#x27;ugly&#x27; and &quot;nukka&quot; for &quot;atsui&quot; &#x27;warm&#x27;
*the nominalization and question particle &quot;to&quot; except for Kitakyushu and Oita, versus Western and Eastern &quot;no&quot;, as in &quot;tottō to?&quot; for &quot;totte iru no?&quot; &#x27;is this taken?&#x27; and &quot;iku to tai&quot; or &quot;ikuttai&quot; for &quot;iku no yo&quot; &#x27;I&#x27;ll go&#x27;
*the directional particle &quot;sai&quot; (Standard &quot;e&quot; and &quot;ni&quot;), though Eastern Tohoku dialect use a similar particle &quot;sa&quot;
*the emphatic sentence-final particles &quot;tai&quot; and &quot;bai&quot; in Hichiku and Satsugu (Standard &quot;yo&quot;)
*a concessive particle &quot;batten&quot; for &quot;dakedo&quot; &#x27;but, however&#x27; in Hichiku and Satsugu, though Eastern Tohoku Aomori dialect has a similar particle &quot;batte&quot;
* is pronounced and palatalizes &quot;s, z, t, d,&quot; as in &quot;mite&quot; and &quot;sode&quot; , though this is a conservative (Late Middle Japanese) pronunciation found with &quot;s, z&quot; (&quot;sensei&quot; ) in scattered areas throughout Japan like the Umpaku dialect.
*as some subdialects in Shikoku and Chugoku, but generally not elsewhere, the accusative particle &quot;o&quot; resyllabifies a noun: &quot;honno&quot; or &quot;honnu&quot; for &quot;hon-o&quot; &#x27;book&#x27;, &quot;kakyū&quot; for &quot;kaki-o&quot; &#x27;persimmon&#x27;.
* is often dropped, for &quot;koi&quot; &#x27;this&#x27; versus Western and Eastern Japanese &quot;kore&quot;
*vowel reduction is frequent especially in Satsugu and Gotō Islands, as in &quot;in&quot; for &quot;inu&quot; &#x27;dog&#x27; and &quot;kuQ&quot; for &quot;kubi&quot; &#x27;neck&#x27;
*Kyushu dialects share some lexical items with Ryukyuan languages, some of which appear to be innovations. Some scholars have proposed that Kyushu dialects and Ryukyuan languages are the same language group within the Japonic family.

Much of Kyushu either lacks pitch accent or has its own, distinctive accent. Kagoshima dialect is so distinctive that some have classified it as a fourth branch of Japanese, alongside Eastern, Western, and the rest of Kyushu.

===Hachijō Japanese===

A small group of dialects spoken in Hachijō-jima and Aogashima, islands south of Tokyo, as well as the Daitō Islands east of Okinawa. Hachijō dialect is quite divergent and sometimes thought to be a primary branch of Japanese. It retains an abundance of inherited ancient Eastern Japanese features.

===Cladogram===
The relationships between the dialects are approximated in the following cladogram:

== Theories ==

=== Theory of Peripheral Distribution of Dialectal Forms ===
West geographically separated areas seem to have been influenced by Eastern traits. The phonology of Tokyo has influenced Western areas like San-in, Shikoku and Kyushu. Eastern morpho-syntactic and lexical characteristics are also found in the West. These instances cannot be explained as borrowing from the Kyoto speech as Tokyo did because between the regions Eastern traits are not contiguous and there is no evidence that regions had contact with Tokyo. One theory argues that the Eastern type speech was spread all over Japan at the beginning and later Western characteristics developed. The eastward spread was prevented through the geography of Japan that divides East and West that separated the cultures in each of them socio-culturally until this day.

Kunio Yanagita began his discussion for this theory in analysing the local variants for the word &quot;snail&quot;. He discovered that the newest words for snail are used in the proximity of Kyoto, the old cultural center, and older forms are found in outer areas. Since the spreading of newer forms of words is slow, older forms are observable in the areas farthest away from the center, creating in effect a situation in which older forms are surrounded by newer forms. His theory in the case of Japan argues that the spread of newer forms happens in a circular pattern with its center being the cultural center. However, this theory can only be true if the characteristics located in peripheral areas are reflections of the historical ones.

=== Origin of Japanese ===
While it is generally accepted that languages in Western Japan are older than the Tokyo dialect, there are new studies that challenge this assumption. For example, there exists a distinction between five word classes in the Osaka-Kyoto dialect while there is no such distinction made in other parts of Japan in the past. Tokugawa argues that it is unlikely that the Osaka-Kyoto speech would be first established and other systems of speech would not be affected by it. Therefore, he states that the Osaka-Kyoto speech created the distinction afterwards. He concludes that either Western Japan accent or the Eastern variant &quot;could be taken the parent of Central Japan accent.&quot;

The Kyoto speech seems to rather have conserved its speech while peripheral dialects have made new innovations over time. However, peripheral dialects have features that are reminiscent of historical forms. The language of peripheral areas form linguistic areas of older forms that come from the central language while its phonetics are distinct from the central language. On the other hand, the central area has influenced other dialects by the propagation of innovative forms.

<text>In mathematical logic, the diagonal lemma (also known as diagonalization lemma, self-reference lemma or fixed point theorem) establishes the existence of self-referential sentences in certain formal theories of the natural numbers—specifically those theories that are strong enough to represent all computable functions. The sentences whose existence is secured by the diagonal lemma can then, in turn, be used to prove fundamental limitative results such as Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems and Tarski&#x27;s undefinability theorem.
It is named in reference to Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument in set and number theory.

== Background ==
Let formula_1 be the set of natural numbers. A first-order theory formula_2 in the language of arithmetic &quot;represents&quot; the computable function formula_3 if there exists a &quot;graph&quot; formula formula_4 in the language of formula_2 — that is, a formula such that for each formula_6
: formula_7.
Here formula_8 is the numeral corresponding to the natural number formula_9, which is defined to be the formula_9th successor of presumed first numeral formula_11 in formula_2.

The diagonal lemma also requires a systematic way of assigning to every formula formula_13 a natural number formula_14 (also written as formula_15) called its Gödel number. Formulas can then be represented within formula_2 by the numerals corresponding to their Gödel numbers. For example, formula_13 is represented by formula_18

The diagonal lemma applies to theories capable of representing all primitive recursive functions. Such theories include first-order Peano arithmetic and the weaker Robinson arithmetic, and even to a much weaker theory known as R. A common statement of the lemma (as given below) makes the stronger assumption that the theory can represent all computable functions, but all the theories mentioned have that capacity, as well.

== Statement of the lemma ==
)&lt;/math&gt;
| name = Lemma

Intuitively, formula_19 is a self-referential sentence: formula_19 says that formula_19 has the property formula_22. The sentence formula_19 can also be viewed as a fixed point of the operation that assigns, to the equivalence class of a given sentence formula_13, the equivalence class of the sentence formula_25 (a sentence&#x27;s equivalence class is the set of all sentences to which it is provably equivalent in the theory formula_2). The sentence formula_19 constructed in the proof is not literally the same as formula_28, but is provably equivalent to it in the theory formula_2.

==Proof==
Let formula_30 be the function defined by:
:formula_31
for each formula formula_32 with only one free variable formula_33 in theory formula_2, and formula_35 otherwise. Here formula_36 denotes the Gödel number of formula formula_32. The function formula_38 is computable (which is ultimately an assumption about the Gödel numbering scheme), so there is a formula formula_39 representing formula_38 in formula_2. Namely
:formula_42
which is to say
:formula_43
Now, given an arbitrary formula formula_44 with one free variable formula_45, define the formula formula_46 as:
:formula_47
Then, for all formulas formula_32 with one free variable: 
:formula_49
which is to say
:formula_50
Now substitute formula_13 with formula_52, and define the sentence formula_19 as:
:formula_54
Then the previous line can be rewritten as 
:formula_55
which is the desired result.

(The same argument in different terms is given in [Raatikainen (2015a)].)

==History==
The lemma is called &quot;diagonal&quot; because it bears some resemblance to Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument. The terms &quot;diagonal lemma&quot; or &quot;fixed point&quot; do not appear in Kurt Gödel&#x27;s 1931 article or in Alfred Tarski&#x27;s 1936 article.

Rudolf Carnap (1934) was the first to prove the general self-referential lemma, which says that for any formula &quot;F&quot; in a theory &quot;T&quot; satisfying certain conditions, there exists a formula &quot;ψ&quot; such that ψ ↔ &quot;F&quot;(°#(&quot;ψ&quot;)) is provable in &quot;T&quot;. Carnap&#x27;s work was phrased in alternate language, as the concept of computable functions was not yet developed in 1934. Mendelson (1997, p. 204) believes that Carnap was the first to state that something like the diagonal lemma was implicit in Gödel&#x27;s reasoning. Gödel was aware of Carnap&#x27;s work by 1937.

The diagonal lemma is closely related to Kleene&#x27;s recursion theorem in computability theory, and their respective proofs are similar.

<doc id="348970" wikidata="Q132677" url="?curid=348970" title="Tabernanthe iboga">
<text>Tabernanthe iboga (iboga) is an evergreen rainforest shrub native to Central Africa. A member of the Apocynaceae family indigenous to Gabon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Republic of Congo, it is cultivated across Central Africa for its medicinal and other effects.

In African traditional medicine and rituals, the yellowish root or bark is used to produce hallucinations and near-death outcomes, with some fatalities occurring. In high doses, ibogaine is considered to be toxic, and has caused serious comorbidities when used with opioids or prescription drugs. The United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) lists ibogaine as a controlled substance of the Controlled Substances Act.

==Description==

&quot;T. iboga&quot; is native to tropical forests, preferring moist soil in partial shade. It bears dark green, narrow leaves and clusters of tubular flowers on an erect and branching stem, with yellow-orange fruits resembling chili pepper.

Normally growing to a height of 2 m, &quot;T. iboga&quot; may eventually grow into a small tree up to 10 m tall, given the right conditions. The flowers are yellowish-white or pink and followed by a fruit, orange at maturity, that may be either globose or fusiform. Its yellow-fleshed roots contain a number of indole alkaloids, most notably ibogaine, which is found in the highest concentration in the bark of the roots. The root material, bitter in taste, causes a degree of anaesthesia in the mouth as well as systemic numbness of the skin.

==Taxonomy==
===Publication of binomial===
&quot;Tabernanthe iboga&quot; was described by Henri Ernest Baillon and published in &quot;Bulletin Mensuel de la Société Linnéenne de Paris&quot; 1: 783 in the year 1889.

===Etymology===
The genus name &quot;Tabernanthe&quot; is a compound of the Latin &quot;taberna&quot;, &quot;tavern&quot;/&quot;hut&quot;/&quot;(market) stall&quot; and Greek: (&quot;anthos&quot;) &quot;flower&quot; – giving a literal meaning of &quot;tavern flower&quot;. On the other hand, it may equally well have been intended (by way of a type of botanical shorthand) to mean &quot;having a flower resembling that of plants belonging to the genus &quot;Tabernaemontana&quot; &quot; (q.v.). If the first conjecture is the correct one, the name could also have been intended to suggest that the plant is cultivated near huts, sold at market stalls or even that – like the beverages sold at a tavern – the plant is intoxicating, all of which alternatives would constitute apt descriptions of an oft-cultivated and popular psychoactive plant. 
The specific name &quot;iboga&quot; comes from the Myene name for the plant, which was also borrowed into a number of other regional languages with mild variation.

==History==
The first (probable...and confused) reference to Iboga is that of Bowdich in chapter 13 of his &quot;Mission from Cape Coast Castle to Ashantee...&quot; of 1819The Eroga, a favourite but violent medicine, is no doubt a fungus, for they describe it as growing on a tree called the Ocamboo, when decaying; they burn it first, and take as much as would lay on a shilling.
If this is indeed a reference to the drug derived from &quot;Tabernanthe iboga&quot; (&quot;Eroga&quot; appears to be a variant form of the names &quot;iboga&quot; and &quot;eboka&quot;) it is, of course, grossly in error in its assumption that iboga is not a plant but a fungus. Notable however is the observation of the potency of the drug – effective in small quantities. The description of the plant as growing on a tree is puzzling: &quot;Tabernanthe iboga&quot; does not usually grow as an epiphyte – if at all.

The ritual use of iboga in Africa was first reported by French and Belgian explorers in the 19th century, beginning with the work of French naval surgeon and explorer of Gabon Griffon du Bellay, who identified it correctly as a shrub belonging to the Apocynaceae – as recorded in a short essay by Charles Eugène Aubry-Lecomte on the plant poisons of West Africa, published in the year 1864.

 Parmi les plantes rares ou nouvelles rapportées par le docteur Griffon du Bellay, la famille des apocynées contient encore deux poisons; l&#x27;un, nommé iboga, n&#x27;est toxique qu&#x27;à hautes doses et a l&#x27;état frais. Pris en petit quantité, il est aphrodisiaque et stimulante du systeme nerveux; les guerriers et chasseurs en font grand usage pour se tenir éveillés dans les affûts de nuit; de même que pour le &quot;M&#x27;boundou&quot;, le principe actif réside dans la racine qu&#x27;on mâche comme la coca. 
[ Translation: Among the rare or new plants brought back by Dr. Griffon du Bellay, the plant family Apocynaceae contains two further poisons; the first of these, called &quot;Iboga&quot;, is only toxic in high doses and in the fresh state. Taken in small quantities, it is an aphrodisiac and stimulant of the (central) nervous system; warriors and hunters make considerable use of it in order to stay awake during their night vigils; as with the (plant) &quot;M&#x27;boundou&quot;, the active principle (of Iboga) resides in the root which is chewed like coca (leaf) ].

==Chemistry==
Indole alkaloids make up about 6% of the root chemical composition of iboga. Alkaloids that are present in more than 1% in root bark are: (in descending order) 
*Ibogaine
*Iboxygaine
*Ibogaline
*Alloibogaine
*Catharanthine
*Ibogamine
*Noribogaine
*Voacangine
*Yohimbine
* Hydroxyibogamine

18-Methoxycoronaridine, a synthetic derivative of ibogaine, also occurs naturally in this plant.

==Traditional use==
The Iboga tree is central to the &quot;Bwiti&quot; spiritual practices in West-Central Africa, mainly Gabon, Cameroon, and the Republic of the Congo, where the alkaloid-containing roots or bark are used in various ceremonies, sometimes to create a near-death experience. Iboga is taken in massive doses by initiates of this spiritual practice, and on a more regular basis is eaten in smaller doses in connection with rituals and tribal dances performed at night.

While in lower doses iboga has a stimulant effect and is used to maintain alertness while hunting, in moderate or high doses, iboga induces dream-like states with vivid visions and hallucinations.

==Addiction treatment==
Anecdotal reports of self-treated opioid addicts indicated a reduced desire to sustain opiate abuse following iboga ingestion. Since 1970, iboga has been legally prohibited in the United States following several fatalities. Iboga extracts, as well as the purified alkaloid ibogaine, have attracted attention because of their purported ability to reverse addiction to drugs such as alcohol and opiates. Due to the cardiac safety risks of iboga, research is also considering iboga analogues.

Ibogaine is classified as a schedule 1 controlled substance in the United States, and is not approved there for addiction treatment (or any other therapeutic use) because of its hallucinogenic and cardiovascular side effects, as well as the absence of safety and efficacy data in human subjects. In most other countries, it remains unregulated and unlicensed.

Independent ibogaine treatment clinics have emerged in Mexico, Canada, the Netherlands, South Africa, and New Zealand, all operating in what has been described as a &quot;legal gray area&quot;. Covert, illegal neighborhood clinics are also known to exist in the United States, despite active DEA surveillance. Addiction specialists warn that the treatment of drug dependence with ibogaine in non-medical settings, without expert supervision and unaccompanied by appropriate psychosocial care, can be dangerous – and, in approximately one case in 300, potentially fatal.

==Adverse effects==
Ibogaine may induce nausea, vomiting, tremors, and headaches. When ibogaine is used chronically, manic episodes lasting for several days may occur, accompanied by insomnia, irritability, delusions, aggressive behavior, and thoughts of suicide, among other effects.

==Legal status==
Iboga is outlawed or restricted in Belgium, Poland, Denmark, Croatia, France, Sweden, and Switzerland. In the United States, ibogaine is classified by the Controlled Substances Act on the list of schedule I drugs, although the plant itself remains unscheduled.

Non-profit organization &quot;Föreningen för hollistisk missbruksvård&quot; is trying to convince the Swedish government to start up clinical investigations of its anti-addictive properties, loosen up the prohibition law against ibogaine, and allow the creation of treatment facilities in Sweden.

Exportation of iboga from Gabon is illegal since the passage of a 1994 cultural protection law.

==Conservation status==
While little data is available on the exploitation and existing habitat of the iboga plant, the destructive effects of harvesting and slow growth could have already severely damaged the wild iboga population.

==Documentary films about iboga==
;&quot;Iboga, les hommes du bois sacré&quot; (2002)
:In this French-language film, Gilbert Kelner documents modern Bwiti practices and Babongo perspectives on iboga. Odisea broadcast a Spanish-dubbed version titled &quot;Los Hombres de la Madera Sagrada&quot; (&quot;The Men of the Sacred Wood&quot;).
;&quot;Ibogaine: Rite of Passage&quot; (2004)
:Directed by Ben Deloenen. A 34-year-old heroin addict undergoes ibogaine treatment with Dr Martin Polanco at the Ibogaine Association, a clinic in Rosarito Mexico. Deloenen interviews people formerly addicted to heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine, who share their perspectives about ibogaine treatment. In Gabon, a Babongo woman receives iboga root for her depressive malaise. Deloenen visually contrasts this Western, clinical use of ibogaine with the Bwiti use of iboga root bark, but emphasizes the Western context.
;&quot;Babongo&quot; (2005)
:In this episode (series 1, episode 4) of the English documentary series &quot;Tribe&quot;, presenter Bruce Parry ingests iboga during his time with the Babongo. BBC 2 aired the episode on January 25, 2005.
;&quot;Dosed&quot; (2019) : This documentary depicts the battle of an opioid addict against her addiction through psychedelic and iboga treatments.
;&quot;Synthetic Ibogaine – Natural Tramadol&quot; (2021)
:In this episode (series 3, episode 4) of the American documentary series &quot;Hamilton&#x27;s Pharmacopeia&quot;, presenter Hamilton Morris joins an Iboga ceremony in Gabon and later interviews Chris Jenks who shows a method to produce ibogaine from &quot;Voacanga africana&quot;.

<doc id="348972" wikidata="Q2531955" url="?curid=348972" title="Melvin Van Peebles">
<text>Melvin Van Peebles (born Melvin Peebles; August 21, 1932 – September 21, 2021) was an American actor, filmmaker, writer, and composer. He worked as an active filmmaker into the early 2020s. His feature film debut, &quot;The Story of a Three-Day Pass&quot; (1967), was based on his own French-language novel &quot;&quot; and was shot in France, as it was difficult for a black American director to get work at the time. The film won an award at the San Francisco International Film Festival which gained him the interest of Hollywood studios, leading to his American feature debut &quot;Watermelon Man&quot;, in 1970. Eschewing further overtures from Hollywood, he used the successes he had so far to bankroll his work as an independent filmmaker.

In 1971, he released his best-known work, creating and starring in the film &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot;, considered one of the earliest and best-regarded examples of the blaxploitation genre. He followed this up with the musical, &quot;Don&#x27;t Play Us Cheap&quot;, based on his own stage play, and continued to make films, write novels and stage plays in English and in French through the next several decades; his final films include the French-language film &quot;&quot; (2000) and the absurdist film &quot;Confessionsofa Ex-Doofus-ItchyFooted Mutha&quot; (2008). His son, filmmaker and actor Mario Van Peebles, appeared in several of his works and portrayed him in the 2003 biographical film &quot;Baadasssss!&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born Melvin Peebles in Chicago, Illinois, he was the son of Edwin Griffin and Marion Peebles. In 1953 Peebles graduated with a B.A. in literature from Ohio Wesleyan University and, 13 days later, joined the Air Force, serving for three and a half years. He added &quot;Van&quot; to his name when he lived in the Netherlands in his late 20s.

==Career==

===Early years===
He worked as a cable car gripman in San Francisco, California. Later, he wrote about these experiences. His first book, &quot;The Big Heart&quot;, credited to Melvin Van, evolved from a small article and a series of photographs taken by Ruth Bernhard.

According to Van Peebles, a passenger suggested that he should become a filmmaker. Van Peebles shot his first short film, &quot;Pickup Men for Herrick&quot; in 1957 and made two more short films during the same period. About these films, Van Peebles said: &quot;I thought they were features. Each one turned out to be eleven minutes long. I was trying to do features. I knew nothing.&quot; As he learned more about the filmmaking process, he found out that &quot;I could make a feature for five hundred dollars. That was the cost of 90 minutes of film. I didn&#x27;t know a thing about shooting a film sixteen to one or ten to one or none of that shit. Then I forgot you had to develop film. And I didn&#x27;t know you needed a work print. All I can say is that after I did one thing he would say, &#x27;Well, aren&#x27;t you gonna put sound on it?&#x27; and I would go, &#x27;Oh shit!&#x27; That&#x27;s all I could say.&quot;

After Van Peebles completed his first short films, he took them with him to Hollywood to try to find work, but was unable to find anyone who wanted to hire him as a director. Van Peebles decided to move his family to the Netherlands where he planned to study astronomy. On the way to Europe, in New York City, he met Amos Vogel, founder of the avant-garde Cinema 16 who agreed to place two of Van Peebles&#x27;s shorts in his rental catalog. Vogel screened Van Peebles&#x27;s &quot;Three Pickup Men&quot; &quot;for Herrick&quot; at Cinema 16 on a program with &quot;City of Jazz&quot; in the spring of 1960 with Ralph Ellison leading a post-film discussion.

When Vogel went to Paris shortly after, he brought Van Peebles&#x27;s films to show Henri Langlois and Mary Meerson at the . Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, Van Peebles&#x27;s marriage dissolved and his wife and children went back to the United States. Shortly thereafter, Van Peebles was invited to Paris probably by Mary Meerson and/or Lotte Eisner, founders of the , on the strength of his short films. In France, Van Peebles created the short film &#x27; (&quot;500 Francs&quot;) (1961) and then established himself as a writer. He did investigative reporting for &quot;France Observateur&quot; during 1963–64, during which he profiled, and later became friends with, Chester Himes. Himes got him a job at the anti-authoritarian humor magazine &quot;Hara-kiri&quot;, where Van Peebles wrote a monthly column and eventually joined the editorial board.

===1965–1970===
During 1965–66, &quot;Mad&quot; magazine attempted a French edition and hired Van Peebles as editor-in-chief during its run of only five issues. He began to write plays in French, utilizing the sprechgesang form of songwriting, where the lyrics were spoken over the music. This style carried over to Van Peebles&#x27; debut album, &quot;Brer Soul&quot;.

Van Peebles was a prolific writer in France. He published four novels and a collection of short stories. He completed at least one play, &#x27; which was also released as a novel, and which he would later make into the musical &quot;Don&#x27;t Play Us Cheap&quot; (1970). Roger Blin directed &#x27; with the theatrical troupe for the in Liège, Belgium in September 1964. Van Peebles made his first feature-length film, &quot;The Story of a Three-Day Pass&quot; (&quot;&quot;) (1968) based on a novel by the same title. The film caught the attention of Hollywood producers who mistook him for a French auteur after it won an award at the San Francisco International Film Festival as the French entry. Van Peebles&#x27;s first Hollywood film was the 1970 Columbia Pictures comedy &quot;Watermelon Man&quot;, written by Herman Raucher. Starring Godfrey Cambridge, the movie tells the story of a casually racist white man who suddenly wakes up black and finds himself alienated from his friends, family, and job.

===1970–1995===
In 1970, Van Peebles directed filming of the Powder Ridge Rock Festival, which was banned by court injunction. After &quot;Watermelon Man&quot;, Van Peebles became determined to have complete control over his next production, which became the groundbreaking &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot; (1971), privately funded with his own money, and in part by a $50,000 loan from Bill Cosby. Van Peebles not only directed, scripted, and edited the film, but wrote the score and directed the marketing campaign. The film, which in the end grossed $15 million, was, among many others, acclaimed by the Black Panthers for its political resonance with the black struggle. His son Mario&#x27;s 2003 film &quot;BAADASSSSS!&quot; tells the story behind the making of &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot;; father and son presented the film together as the Closing Night selection for Maryland Film Festival 2004.

Van Peebles wrote the book, music, and lyrics for the stage musical &quot;Ain&#x27;t Supposed to Die a Natural Death&quot;, which opened off-Broadway and then moved to Broadway, running for 325 performances in 1971–72. The show was nominated for seven Tony Awards, including Best Musical, Best Book of a Musical, and Best Original Score. 

As his intended follow-up to &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot;, Van Peebles made the musical film &quot;Don&#x27;t Play Us Cheap&quot;. The film was an adaptation of an earlier stage musical of the same name which Van Peebles had created for performances at San Francisco State College in November 1970. At the time of the film&#x27;s creation in 1971, a Broadway production of the stage musical was not planned, but the failure to find a distributor for the completed film led to Van Peebles&#x27; decision to bring the musical to Broadway in 1972 for a production of the play at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre. Van Peebles performed the same duties as his previous stage musical, as well as producing and directing. The show ran for 164 performances in 1972, earning Van Peebles another Tony nomination for Best Book of a Musical. The previously shot film version was later released on January 1, 1973.

In 1977, Van Peebles was one of four credited screenwriters on the film &quot;Greased Lightning&quot;, about the life of pioneering Black NASCAR driver Wendell Scott. He was originally the director of the film as well, but was replaced by Michael Schultz.

Van Peebles was involved with two more Broadway musicals in the 1980s. He was a co-writer on the book for &quot;Reggae&quot;, which closed after 21 performances in 1980. For &quot;Waltz of the Stork&quot;, he wrote book, music, and lyrics, as well as producing the show and playing the lead role. It ran for 160 performances in 1982.

In the 1980s, Van Peebles became an options trader on the American Stock Exchange while continuing to work in theater and film.

In 1995, he co-starred in the American live-action version of Japanese manga &quot;Fist of the North Star,&quot; alongside Gary Daniels, Costas Mandylor, Chris Penn, Isako Washio, Malcolm McDowell, Downtown Julie Brown, Dante Basco, Tracey Walter, Clint Howard, Tony Halme, and Big Van Vader.

===2005–2009===

Also in 2005, Van Peebles was the subject of the documentary &quot;&quot;, which also featured Ossie Davis and Gordon Parks in the same room. It was moderated by Warrington Hudlin.

In 2005, it was announced that Van Peebles would collaborate with Madlib for a proposed double album titled &quot;Brer Soul Meets Quasimoto&quot;. However, nothing further was issued about this project from the time that it was first announced.

In 2008, Van Peebles completed the film &quot;Confessionsofa Ex-Doofus-ItchyFooted Mutha&quot;, which was the Closing Night selection for Maryland Film Festival 2008, and appeared on &quot;All My Children&quot; as Melvin Woods, the father of Samuel Woods, a character portrayed by his son, Mario.

In an interview, Van Peebles said :

In 2009, Van Peebles became involved with a project to adapt &quot;Sweet Sweetback&quot; into a musical. A preliminary version of this was staged at the Apollo Theater on April 25–26, 2009. As well, he wrote and performed in a stage musical, &quot;Unmitigated Truth: Life, a Lavatory, Loves, and Ladies&quot;, which featured some of his previous songs as well as some new material.

===2011–2019===
In 2011, Van Peebles started doing shows in NYC with members of Burnt Sugar, under the name Melvin Van Peebles wid Laxative. Van Peebles said that the band is called Laxative because they &quot;make shit happen&quot;. In November 2011, Melvin Van Peebles wid Laxative performed his song &quot;Love, That&#x27;s America&quot; at Zebulon Cafe Concert, two weeks after the venue showed the original video for this song involving Occupy Wall Street footage, which was uploaded to YouTube in October 2011.

On August 21, 2012, he distributed a new album, on vinyl only, called &quot;Nahh... Nahh Mofo&quot;. This album was distributed at his birthday celebration at Film Forum. On November 10, 2012, he released a video for the song &quot;Lilly Done the Zampoughi Every Time I Pulled Her Coattail&quot; to go with the album, which was announced on his Facebook page.

On May 5, 2013, he returned to the Film Forum for a screening of Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;The Kid&quot; (1921) and was a judge at the Charlie Chaplin Dress-Alike Contest which was held after the screening. He wore a bowler hat and baggy pants in honor of Chaplin.

In September 2013, Van Peebles made his public debut as a visual artist, as a part of a gallery featured called &quot;eMerge 2.0: Melvin Van Peebles &amp; Artists on the Cusp&quot;. It features &quot;Ex-Voto Monochrome (A Ghetto Mother&#x27;s Prayer)&quot;, one of many pieces of art he created to be on display in his home.

In 2017, &quot;Methane Momma&quot;, a short film directed by Alain Rimbert, featured Van Peebles and his narration of poetic work with accompaniment of music by The Heliocentrics.

<text>In mathematics, in the area of order theory, an antichain is a subset of a partially ordered set such that any two distinct elements in the subset are incomparable.

The size of the largest antichain in a partially ordered set is known as its [[Antichain|width]]. By Dilworth&#x27;s theorem, this also equals the minimum number of chains (totally ordered subsets) into which the set can be partitioned. Dually, the height of the partially ordered set (the length of its longest chain) equals by Mirsky&#x27;s theorem the minimum number of antichains into which the set can be partitioned.

The family of all antichains in a finite partially ordered set can be given join and meet operations, making them into a distributive lattice. For the partially ordered system of all subsets of a finite set, ordered by set inclusion, the antichains are called Sperner families
and their lattice is a free distributive lattice, with a Dedekind number of elements. More generally, counting the number of antichains of a finite partially ordered set is #P-complete.

==Definitions==

Let formula_1 be a partially ordered set. Two elements formula_2 and formula_3 of a partially ordered set are called comparable if formula_4 If two elements are not comparable, they are called incomparable; that is, formula_5 and formula_6 are incomparable if neither formula_7

A chain in formula_1 is a subset formula_9 in which each pair of elements is comparable; that is, formula_10 is totally ordered. An antichain in formula_1 is a subset formula_12 of formula_1 in which each pair of different elements is incomparable; that is, there is no order relation between any two different elements in formula_14 
(However, some authors use the term &quot;antichain&quot; to mean strong antichain, a subset such that there is no element of the poset smaller than two distinct elements of the antichain.)

==Height and width==

A maximal antichain is an antichain that is not a proper subset of any other antichain. A maximum antichain is an antichain that has cardinality at least as large as every other antichain. The of a partially ordered set is the cardinality of a maximum antichain. Any antichain can intersect any chain in at most one element, so, if we can partition the elements of an order into formula_15 chains then the width of the order must be at most formula_15 (if the antichain has more than formula_15 elements, by the pigeonhole principle, there would be 2 of its elements belonging to the same chain, a contradiction). Dilworth&#x27;s theorem states that this bound can always be reached: there always exists an antichain, and a partition of the elements into chains, such that the number of chains equals the number of elements in the antichain, which must therefore also equal the width. Similarly, one can define the of a partial order to be the maximum cardinality of a chain. Mirsky&#x27;s theorem states that in any partial order of finite height, the height equals the smallest number of antichains into which the order may be partitioned.

== Sperner families ==
An antichain in the inclusion ordering of subsets of an formula_18-element set is known as a Sperner family. The number of different Sperner families is counted by the Dedekind numbers, the first few of which numbers are
:2, 3, 6, 20, 168, 7581, 7828354, 2414682040998, 56130437228687557907788 .
Even the empty set has two antichains in its power set: one containing a single set (the empty set itself) and one containing no sets.

== Join and meet operations ==

Any antichain formula_12 corresponds to a lower set
formula_20
In a finite partial order (or more generally a partial order satisfying the ascending chain condition) all lower sets have this form. The union of any two lower sets is another lower set, and the union operation corresponds in this way to a join operation
on antichains:
formula_21
Similarly, we can define a meet operation on antichains, corresponding to the intersection of lower sets:
formula_22
The join and meet operations on all finite antichains of finite subsets of a set formula_23 define a distributive lattice, the free distributive lattice generated by formula_24 Birkhoff&#x27;s representation theorem for distributive lattices states that every finite distributive lattice can be represented via join and meet operations on antichains of a finite partial order, or equivalently as union and intersection operations on the lower sets of the partial order.

==Computational complexity==

A maximum antichain (and its size, the width of a given partially ordered set) can be found in polynomial time.
Counting the number of antichains in a given partially ordered set is #P-complete.

<text>In transcendental number theory, the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem is a result that is very useful in establishing the transcendence of numbers. It states the following: 
In other words, the extension field formula_1 has transcendence degree over formula_2.

An equivalent formulation from , is the following: This equivalence transforms a linear relation over the algebraic numbers into an algebraic relation over formula_2 by using the fact that a symmetric polynomial whose arguments are all conjugates of one another gives a rational number.

The theorem is named for Ferdinand von Lindemann and Karl Weierstrass. Lindemann proved in 1882 that is transcendental for every non-zero algebraic number thereby establishing that is transcendental (see below). Weierstrass proved the above more general statement in 1885.

The theorem, along with the Gelfond–Schneider theorem, is extended by Baker&#x27;s theorem, and all of these would be further generalized by Schanuel&#x27;s conjecture.

==Naming convention==
The theorem is also known variously as the Hermite–Lindemann theorem and the Hermite–Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem. Charles Hermite first proved the simpler theorem where the exponents are required to be rational integers and linear independence is only assured over the rational integers, a result sometimes referred to as Hermite&#x27;s theorem. Although that appears to be a special case of the above theorem, the general result can be reduced to this simpler case. Lindemann was the first to allow algebraic numbers into Hermite&#x27;s work in 1882. Shortly afterwards Weierstrass obtained the full result, and further simplifications have been made by several mathematicians, most notably by David Hilbert and Paul Gordan.

== Transcendence of and ==

The transcendence of and are direct corollaries of this theorem.

Suppose is a non-zero algebraic number; then is a linearly independent set over the rationals, and therefore by the first formulation of the theorem is an algebraically independent set; or in other words is transcendental. In particular, is transcendental. (A more elementary proof that is transcendental is outlined in the article on transcendental numbers.)

Alternatively, by the second formulation of the theorem, if is a non-zero algebraic number, then is a set of distinct algebraic numbers, and so the set is linearly independent over the algebraic numbers and in particular cannot be algebraic and so it is transcendental.

To prove that is transcendental, we prove that it is not algebraic. If were algebraic, &quot;i&quot; would be algebraic as well, and then by the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem (see Euler&#x27;s identity) would be transcendental, a contradiction. Therefore is not algebraic, which means that it is transcendental.

A slight variant on the same proof will show that if is a non-zero algebraic number then and their hyperbolic counterparts are also transcendental.

== -adic conjecture ==
==Modular conjecture==
An analogue of the theorem involving the modular function was conjectured by Daniel Bertrand in 1997, and remains an open problem. Writing for the square of the nome and the conjecture is as follows. 

==Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem ==
===Proof===
The proof relies on two preliminary lemmas. Notice that Lemma B itself is already sufficient to deduce the original statement of Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem.

====Preliminary lemmas====
 \right ) + \cdots + c(r) \left (e^{\gamma(r)_1}+\cdots+ e^{\gamma(r)_{m(r)}} \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

has only the trivial solution formula_4 for all formula_5}}

Proof of Lemma A. To simplify the notation set:
:formula_6

Then the statement becomes

:formula_7

Let be a prime number and define the following polynomials:

: formula_8

where is a non-zero integer such that formula_9 are all algebraic integers. Define

: formula_10

Using integration by parts we arrive at

: formula_11

where formula_12 is the degree of formula_13, and formula_14 is the &quot;j&quot;-th derivative of formula_13. This also holds for &quot;s&quot; complex (in this case the integral has to be intended as a contour integral, for example along the straight segment from 0 to &quot;s&quot;) because

:formula_16

is a primitive of formula_17.

Consider the following sum:

:formula_18

In the last line we assumed that the conclusion of the Lemma is false. In order to complete the proof we need to reach a contradiction. We will do so by estimating formula_19 in two different ways.

First formula_20 is an algebraic integer which is divisible by &quot;p&quot;! for formula_21 and vanishes for formula_22 and formula_23, in which case it equals

:formula_24

This is not divisible by &quot;p&quot; when &quot;p&quot; is large enough because otherwise, putting

:formula_25

(which is a non-zero algebraic integer) and calling formula_26 the product of its conjugates (which is still non-zero), we would get that &quot;p&quot; divides formula_27, which is false.

So formula_28 is a non-zero algebraic integer divisible by (&quot;p&quot; − 1)!. Now

:formula_29

Since each formula_30 is obtained by dividing a fixed polynomial with integer coefficients by formula_31, it is of the form

:formula_32

where formula_33 is a polynomial (with integer coefficients) independent of &quot;i&quot;. The same holds for the derivatives formula_34.

Hence, by the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials,

:formula_35

is a fixed polynomial with rational coefficients evaluated in formula_36 (this is seen by grouping the same powers of formula_37 appearing in the expansion and using the fact that these algebraic numbers are a complete set of conjugates). So the same is true of formula_28, i.e. it equals formula_39, where &quot;G&quot; is a polynomial with rational coefficients independent of &quot;i&quot;.

Finally formula_40 is rational (again by the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials) and is a non-zero algebraic integer divisible by formula_41 (since the formula_28&#x27;s are algebraic integers divisible by formula_43). Therefore

:formula_44

However one clearly has:

:formula_45

where is the polynomial whose coefficients are the absolute values of those of &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; (this follows directly from the definition of formula_46). Thus

:formula_47

and so by the construction of the formula_13&#x27;s we have formula_49 for a sufficiently large &quot;C&quot; independent of &quot;p&quot;, which contradicts the previous inequality. This proves Lemma A. ∎

Proof of Lemma B: Assuming

:formula_50

we will derive a contradiction, thus proving Lemma B.

Let us choose a polynomial with integer coefficients which vanishes on all the formula_51&#x27;s and let formula_52 be all its distinct roots. Let &quot;b&quot;(&quot;n&quot; + 1) = ... = &quot;b&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) = 0.

The polynomial

:formula_53

vanishes at formula_54 by assumption. Since the product is symmetric, for any formula_55 the monomials formula_56 and formula_57 have the same coefficient in the expansion of &quot;P&quot;.

Thus, expanding formula_58 accordingly and grouping the terms with the same exponent, we see that the resulting exponents formula_59 form a complete set of conjugates and, if two terms have conjugate exponents, they are multiplied by the same coefficient.

So we are in the situation of Lemma A. To reach a contradiction it suffices to see that at least one of the coefficients is non-zero. This is seen by equipping with the lexicographic order and by choosing for each factor in the product the term with non-zero coefficient which has maximum exponent according to this ordering: the product of these terms has non-zero coefficient in the expansion and does not get simplified by any other term. This proves Lemma B. ∎

====Final step====
We turn now to prove the theorem: Let &quot;a&quot;(1), ..., &quot;a&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) be non-zero algebraic numbers, and &quot;α&quot;(1), ..., &quot;α&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) distinct algebraic numbers. Then let us assume that:

: formula_60

We will show that this leads to contradiction and thus prove the theorem. The proof is very similar to that of Lemma B, except that this time the choices are made over the &quot;a&quot;(&quot;i&quot;)&#x27;s:

For every &quot;i&quot; ∈ {1, ..., &quot;n&quot;}, &quot;a&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) is algebraic, so it is a root of an irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients of degree &quot;d&quot;(&quot;i&quot;). Let us denote the distinct roots of this polynomial &quot;a&quot;(&quot;i&quot;)1, ..., &quot;a&quot;(&quot;i&quot;)&quot;d&quot;(&quot;i&quot;), with &quot;a&quot;(&quot;i&quot;)1 = &quot;a&quot;(&quot;i&quot;).

Let S be the functions σ which choose one element from each of the sequences (1, ..., &quot;d&quot;(1)), (1, ..., &quot;d&quot;(2)), ..., (1, ..., &quot;d&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)), so that for every 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;, σ(&quot;i&quot;) is an integer between 1 and &quot;d&quot;(&quot;i&quot;). We form the polynomial in the variables formula_61

: formula_62

Since the product is over all the possible choice functions σ, &quot;Q&quot; is symmetric in formula_63 for every &quot;i&quot;. Therefore &quot;Q&quot; is a polynomial with integer coefficients in elementary symmetric polynomials of the above variables, for every &quot;i&quot;, and in the variables &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot;. Each of the latter symmetric polynomials is a rational number when evaluated in formula_64.

The evaluated polynomial formula_65 vanishes because one of the choices is just σ(&quot;i&quot;) = 1 for all &quot;i&quot;, for which the corresponding factor vanishes according to our assumption above. Thus, the evaluated polynomial is a sum of the form

: formula_66

where we already grouped the terms with the same exponent. So in the left-hand side we have distinct values β(1), ..., β(&quot;N&quot;), each of which is still algebraic (being a sum of algebraic numbers) and coefficients formula_67.
The sum is nontrivial: if formula_68 is maximal in the lexicographic order, the coefficient of formula_69 is just a product of &quot;a&quot;(&quot;i&quot;)&quot;j&quot;&#x27;s (with possible repetitions), which is non-zero.

By multiplying the equation with an appropriate integer factor, we get an identical equation except that now &quot;b&quot;(1), ..., &quot;b&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) are all integers. Therefore, according to Lemma B, the equality cannot hold, and we are led to a contradiction which completes the proof. ∎

Note that Lemma A is sufficient to prove that &quot;e&quot; is irrational, since otherwise we may write &quot;e&quot; = &quot;p&quot; / &quot;q&quot;, where both &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are non-zero integers, but by Lemma A we would have &quot;qe&quot; − &quot;p&quot; ≠ 0, which is a contradiction. Lemma A also suffices to prove that is irrational, since otherwise we may write = &quot;k&quot; / &quot;n&quot;, where both &quot;k&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are integers) and then ±&quot;i&quot; are the roots of &quot;n&quot;2&quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;k&quot;2 = 0; thus 2 − 1 − 1 = 2&quot;e&quot;0 + &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot; + &quot;e&quot;−&quot;i&quot; ≠ 0; but this is false.

Similarly, Lemma B is sufficient to prove that &quot;e&quot; is transcendental, since Lemma B says that if &quot;a&quot;0, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; are integers not all of which are zero, then

: formula_70

Lemma B also suffices to prove that is transcendental, since otherwise we would have 1 + &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot; ≠ 0.

====Equivalence of the two statements====

Baker&#x27;s formulation of the theorem clearly implies the first formulation. Indeed, if formula_71 are algebraic numbers that are linearly independent over formula_72, and

:formula_73

is a polynomial with rational coefficients, then we have

:formula_74

and since formula_71 are algebraic numbers which are linearly independent over the rationals, the numbers formula_76 are algebraic and they are distinct for distinct &quot;n&quot;-tuples formula_77. So from Baker&#x27;s formulation of the theorem we get formula_78 for all &quot;n&quot;-tuples formula_77.

Now assume that the first formulation of the theorem holds. For formula_80 Baker&#x27;s formulation is trivial, so let us assume that formula_81, and let formula_82 be non-zero algebraic numbers, and formula_71 distinct algebraic numbers such that:

:formula_84

As seen in the previous section, and with the same notation used there, the value of the polynomial

:formula_85

at

:formula_86

has an expression of the form

: formula_87

where we have grouped the exponentials having the same exponent. Here, as proved above, formula_88 are rational numbers, not all equal to zero, and each exponent formula_89 is a linear combination of formula_68 with integer coefficients. Then, since formula_81 and formula_71 are pairwise distinct, the formula_72-vector subspace formula_94 of formula_95 generated by formula_71 is not trivial and we can pick formula_97 to form a basis for formula_98 For each formula_99, we have

:formula_100

For each formula_101 let formula_102 be the least common multiple of all the formula_103 for formula_104, and put formula_105. Then formula_106 are algebraic numbers, they form a basis of formula_94, and each formula_89 is a linear combination of the formula_109 with integer coefficients. By multiplying the relation

:formula_87

by formula_111, where formula_112 is a large enough positive integer, we get a non-trivial algebraic relation with rational coefficients connecting formula_113, against the first formulation of the theorem.

<text>The Norwegian Lundehund (Norwegian: &quot;Norsk lundehund&quot;) is a small dog breed of the Spitz type that originates from Norway. Its name is a compound noun composed of the elements &quot;lunde&quot;, meaning puffin (Norwegian &quot;lunde&quot;, &quot;puffin&quot;, or &quot;lundefugl&quot;, &quot;puffin bird&quot;), and &quot;hund&quot;, meaning dog. The breed was originally developed for the hunting of puffins and their eggs on inaccessible nesting places in caves and on cliffs. The breed was at the brink of extinction in the 1960s and preservation efforts have since been underway.

== History ==
The Lundehund was a valuable working animal for hunting puffin birds along the Norwegian coast as food for over 400 years. The first known written record of the breed dates to 1591, when a bailiff wrote of his visit to Værøy that, “one cannot easily retrieve [puffins] from the depth without having a small dog accustomed to crawling into the hole and pulling the birds out.” Its flexibility and extra toes were ideal for hunting the birds in their inaccessible nesting locations on cliffs and in caves. Interest for the breed declined when new methods of using nets for hunting puffins were incorporated and a dog tax was created. Around 1900, they were only found in the isolated village of Mostad (spelled &quot;Måstad&quot; in Norwegian), Lofoten. There have also been stories of Lundehund being used on Lovund, Lurøy by Petter Dass, as cited in his famous work, Nordlands Trompet. The breed was nearly extinct around World War II when canine distemper struck Værøy and the surrounding islands, reducing the population to just two dogs. In 1963, the population was further decimated by another outbreak of distemper. This time, only six dogs survived, one on Værøy and five in eastern Norway, Hamar, of which the latter five were from the same mother. This created a severe population bottleneck. Due to careful breeding with strict guidelines, there are now an estimated 1500 dogs in the world (2022), with around 900 of the population in Norway.

== Characteristics ==
The Norwegian Lundehund is a small, rectangular Spitz type dog with several unique phenotypical traits. They have a great range of motion in its joints, allowing it to fit into and extricate itself from narrow passages and tunnels. Dogs of this breed are able to bend their head backwards along their own spine, similar to the New Guinea singing dog, Bornean dingo and Australian dingo, and turn their forelegs to the side at a 90-degree horizontal angle to their body, much like human arms. Their pricked, upright ears can be folded shut to form a near-tight seal by folding forward or backward, protecting them from dirt and parasites.

The Norwegian Lundehund is a polydactyl: instead of the normal four toes per foot, the Lundehund normally has six toes, all fully formed, jointed and muscled. Some specimens may on occasion have more or fewer than six toes per foot, but this is then outside the breed standard. 

The outercoat is dense and rough with a soft undercoat. The Lundehund is adapted to climb narrow cliff paths on the island of Værøya where it originally would have hunted puffins. Some general information can be found on the Norwegian Lundehund Association webpages. 

The breed is being tested in Tromsø airport by the Norwegian Air Traffic and Airport Management as a solution to airplane bird strikes. The dog is used to search for bird eggs around the airport for disposal.

The Lundehund is an active breed that requires a fair amount of exercise. It is a good family dog, and tolerates children well if properly socialized.

== Health ==
The Norwegian Lundehund population shows signs of inbreeding depression including reduced fertility due to small litter size, inbreeding avoidance behaviors and low sperm quality. 

=== Lundehund syndrome ===
Norwegian Lundehund are predisposed to develop intestinal lymphangiectasia, commonly known as Lundehund Syndrome, a protein-wasting enteropathy that causes intermittent diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, and ascites. In addition, dogs with Lundehund Syndrome are predisposed to chronic atrophic gastritis and gastric neoplasms. A major issue with the Lundehund is the loss of ability to absorb nutrients from food and in extreme cases the dog can starve due to its inability to derive nutrients and protein from food, regardless of food intake. There is no cure, though the disease can be managed; however, many dogs experience repeated acute episodes of Lundehund Syndrome throughout their lives, resulting in extensive medical treatment and poor quality of life. There are indications that for the Lundehund to go on a low fat and higher protein diet has very positive effects on the health with respect to digestive problems. A study on mortality in the Lundehund population showed that 30% of deaths before 11 years of age occurred as a consequence of Lundehund Syndrome and another 10% of other gastrointestinal diseases. The genes responsible and pattern of inheritance for Lundehund Syndrome is not well understood and might, at least in part, be explained by polygenic inheritance and a high frequency—or fixation—of the responsible gene(s).

=== Cross-breeding program ===
Due to the severity of population bottlenecking, the Norwegian Lundehund is now undergoing a cross-breeding program spearheaded by the Norwegian Lundehund club with assistance from a group of geneticists. The program aims to employ a strategy of breeding the Norwegian Lundehund with select individuals from various other Nordic dog breeds including the Norwegian Buhund, Icelandic Sheepdog and Norrbottenspets in order to reduce deleterious recessive genetic disorders.

<doc id="348978" wikidata="Q777464" url="?curid=348978" title="Jackie Chan Adventures">
<text>Jackie Chan Adventures is an animated television series developed by John Rogers, Duane Capizzi and Jeff Kline, and produced by Columbia TriStar Television (now Sony Pictures Television), Adelaide Productions, The JC Group and Blue Train Entertainment. The cartoon series premiered on September 9, 2000, and ran for five seasons until its conclusion on July 8, 2005. The series focuses on a fictionalized version of Hong Kong action film star Jackie Chan, who operates in life as an archaeologist and special agent, combatting threats that are mainly magical and supernatural (based on real-life mythologies and supernatural stories from Asia and around the world) with the aid of his family and close friends.

Many of the episodes created for &quot;Jackie Chan Adventures&quot; featured references to Chan&#x27;s actual works, with the actor making live-action appearances in the form of an interview situation, answering questions about his life and work. The series was aired in the United States on Kids&#x27; WB, with re-runs and second run premieres aired on Toon Disney&#x27;s Jetix programming block, as well as Cartoon Network&#x27;s Toonami block as well as Canadian broadcasts on YTV&#x27;s Vortex. The series proved a success on children&#x27;s television, including abroad, leading to the creation of a toy franchise and two video games based on the series.

== Premise ==
&quot;Jackie Chan Adventures&quot; is set in a world which magic and supernatural forces exist but are unknown to much of humanity – these include demons, ghosts, spirits, spells, and various creatures and gods. Although the series focuses mostly on those from Asia, primarily Chinese mythology and folklore, it also includes those from other locations in the world, including Europe and Central America. In the animated series, the actor Jackie Chan exists in this setting as a professional archaeologist with a high degree of martial combat skill, who is forced to accept the fact that magic and the supernatural exists when he uncovers a talisman in an artifact that possess magical powers sought out by a criminal organization.

Throughout the series, Chan is aided by his close family, including his uncle and his niece Jade, and his close friend Captain Black – head of a secret law enforcement organization codenamed &quot;Section 13&quot; – alongside additional allies introduced over the course of the series. Each season of the program primarily contains an overarching storyline in which Chan and his allies must face off against a dangerous demonic figure, aided by human henchman, by preventing them finding a series of magical objects that can help them to conquer the world. Alongside the overarching plotline, some episodes also consist of standalone stories that focus on Chan and his friends combatting magical and supernatural forces that are either evil or not understanding of their situation. While storylines feature action sequences focused on magic and martial arts, they also include comedic situations akin to several of Chan&#x27;s works in action-comedy films.

While Chan does not provide the voice of his animated character, he appears regularly in live-action inserts at the end of the program to offer insights on Chinese history, culture and philosophy as well as answering fan questions read by Stacie Chan offscreen.

=== References to Jackie Chan&#x27;s career ===
The series often features references to Jackie Chan&#x27;s films and his own life throughout the series. In the episode &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, Uncle states that he was part of the stage group &quot;Seven Little Fortunes&quot;, which Jackie Chan was actually part of in real life. Another example is in the episode &quot;The Invisible Mom&quot; where Jackie is bitten by a Snake, and uses a kung fu style known as &quot;the drunken master&quot; from one of his earliest headlining films of the same name. According to Jackie during one of his question segments, the characters of the show are based on certain people in his life. Uncle is based on his agent and father, Jade is based on an assortment of his nieces, and Tohru is based on one of his stunt team members as well as himself. The episode &quot;And He Does His Own Stunts&quot; is a reference to the fact that Jackie Chan does his own stunts in his movies.

Some episodes&#x27; titles are based on actual film names. For example, &quot;Half a Mask of Kung Fu&quot; is based on &quot;Half a Loaf of Kung Fu&quot;, four episode titles (&quot;Enter the Viper&quot;, &quot;Enter the Cat&quot;, &quot;Re-Enter the J-Team&quot;, and &quot;Re-Enter the Dragon&quot;) are based on &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (in which Jackie Chan performs as a stuntman), &quot;Shanghai Moon&quot; is based on &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot;, &quot;Armor of the Gods&quot; is based on &quot;Armour of God&quot;, &quot;Project A, for Astral&quot; is based on &quot;Project A&quot; and &quot;Rumble in the Big House&quot; is based on &quot;Rumble in the Bronx&quot;.

=== Home media ===
In 2001, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released episodes from the first season on VHS and DVD. But one format differed from the other in that of the four DVDs released, three were select, individual episodes while the fourth contained the whole season of 13 episodes; the VHS series had only three, separate episodes. Also, there was a difference in the titles of said episodes released on VHS and DVD. The Day of The Dragon VHS box cover art was the same as that of the first season DVD case cover, which featured Jackie, Jade and Uncle with the villains behind them, dimmed in a yellowish background. On these, the episodes were presented without the teasers that originally appeared prior to the opening/intro sequence as they aired. They are currently unavailable and out-of-print, especially since they had limited pressings and no plans have been announced to follow up season one with DVD box sets of the remaining four seasons. However, the entire series can be ordered and seen via video-on-demand service at Amazon and iTunes. As of October 2010, the entire series was made available on the Netflix streaming service.

Sony Pictures Home Entertainment plans to release the second season on DVD through Amazon.com, and other online retailers. Mill Creek Entertainment announced all five seasons on DVD in Region 1.

<doc id="348979" wikidata="Q216929" url="?curid=348979" title="Oliver &amp; Company">
<text>Oliver &amp; Company is a 1988 American animated musical adventure film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is loosely based on the Charles Dickens novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. In the film, Oliver is a homeless kitten who joins a gang of dogs to survive in the streets. Among other changes, the setting of the film was relocated from 19th century London to 1980s New York City, Fagin&#x27;s gang is made up of dogs (one of which is Dodger), and Sykes is a loan shark.

In late 1984 or 1985, Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg held a pitch meeting with the animation staff, in which story artist Pete Young pitched the idea to adapt &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; with dogs. The pitch was quickly approved, and the film quickly went into production under the working title &quot;Oliver and the Dodger&quot;.

&quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; was released in the United States on November 18, 1988, the same day as &quot;The Land Before Time&quot;. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was a box office success, grossing $121 million against a $31 million budget. The film was re-released in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom on March 29, 1996. It was first released on home video on September 24 of the same year. It was also released in 2002 and 2009 on DVD. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc in 2013, commemorating its 25th anniversary.

==Plot==

On Fifth Avenue, several kittens are left in a box outside a shop. All but one, an orange tabby kitten, are adopted. Wandering the streets by himself in search of someone to adopt him, the kitten meets a laid-back Jack Russell Terrier named Dodger, who agrees to help him steal food from a hot dog vendor. Dodger then reneges on the deal and flees with the hot dogs.

The kitten pursues Dodger all over New York City. Dodger eventually arrives at a barge, where the kitten watches him share the hot dogs with a gang of poverty-stricken dogs (Tito the chihuahua, Einstein the Great Dane, Francis the bulldog, and Rita the Saluki). The kitten accidentally falls into the barge, startling the dogs; although they were miffed, none of them harm him after he explains himself. Fagin, the bargeman and petty thief who owns the dogs, is indebted to Sykes, a nefarious loan shark and criminal. Sykes arrives and gives Fagin an ultimatum; repay the money in three days, or suffer violence, possibly even death. Sykes&#x27; two Dobermans, Roscoe and DeSoto, harass Fagin&#x27;s dogs and threaten to eat the kitten, until he scratches DeSoto&#x27;s nose, earning the respect of the dogs and Fagin. Roscoe warns that they will try to exact revenge.

The next morning, Fagin goes to pawn some of his stolen goods, while the dogs and the kitten try to steal more money for him. Through a theatrical ruse, the animals stop a limousine belonging to the wealthy Foxworth family, but the attempt to rob the limo fails, and the kitten is taken by the child Jenny Foxworth, who is missing her vacationing parents and desires a companion. The kitten makes himself at home in Jenny&#x27;s house, much to the disgust of Georgette, the Foxworth family&#x27;s spoiled, prize-winning poodle. Jenny names the kitten Oliver, and becomes very attached to him.

The next day, Georgette helps Dodger and the dogs steal Oliver back from the Foxworth household, returning him to the barge. Fagin returns and recognizes from Oliver&#x27;s new collar and gold name tag that he had been adopted by a wealthy family, and desperately decides to hold Oliver for ransom. His anonymously written ransom note reaches Jenny, who sets out to get Oliver back at the pier.

Jenny meets with Fagin, who is shocked to be dealing with a little girl whose &quot;ransom money&quot; is a piggy bank. Bothered by his conscience and Jenny&#x27;s tears, Fagin gives Oliver back freely. Sykes, whom Fagin had informed of the deal beforehand, is watching from the shadows and kidnaps Jenny, intending to ransom her while declaring Fagin&#x27;s debt repaid. Dodger rallies Oliver and the other dogs to free Jenny from Sykes, but Sykes and his Dobermans confront them as they attempt to leave. Fagin saves the group with his motor scooter, and a chase ensues throughout the streets and into the subway tunnels. Jenny falls from the scooter onto Sykes&#x27; car; Oliver and Dodger go after her and battle Roscoe and DeSoto, who fall off the car and are electrocuted and killed on the third rail of the subway. Fagin leaves Tito to drive and saves Jenny, while Dodger and Oliver are thrown from Sykes&#x27; car onto the pavement of the Brooklyn Bridge just before an oncoming train strikes Sykes&#x27; car, killing him. Tito drives the scooter to safety, and Jenny and Oliver are reunited.

Later, Jenny celebrates her birthday with the animals, Fagin, and the family butler Winston. Oliver opts to stay with Jenny, but promises to remain in contact with Dodger and the gang.

==Voice cast==

* Joey Lawrence as Oliver, an orange orphaned tabby kitten who is looking for a home. He joins Fagin&#x27;s gang of dogs before being taken in by Jenny.
* Billy Joel as Dodger, a charismatic, laid-back Jack Russell Terrier. He displays considerable &quot;street savoir-faire.&quot; He is the leader of Fagin&#x27;s gang of dogs, and is Oliver&#x27;s first acquaintance, as well as his eventual best friend and surrogate big brother.
* Cheech Marin as Tito, a Mexican-accented Chihuahua in Fagin&#x27;s gang. He is fast-talking and rapidly develops a crush on Georgette, although she is initially repulsed by him and serves as the comic relief in the film. His full name is Ignacio Alonso Julio Federico de Tito.
* Richard Mulligan as Einstein, a gray Great Dane and a member of Fagin&#x27;s gang. He is named ironically as he is fairly dull-witted.
* Roscoe Lee Browne as Francis, a Bulldog with a British accent in Fagin&#x27;s gang. He appreciates art and theatre, particularly Shakespeare. He also detests anyone abbreviating his name as &quot;Frank&quot; or &quot;Frankie&quot; (which Tito frequently does).
* Sheryl Lee Ralph as Rita, a female Saluki in Fagin&#x27;s gang. She is street-wise and very protective of Oliver.
** Ruth Pointer provided the singing voice for Rita.
* Dom DeLuise as Fagin, a lowly but well-meaning thief who lives on a barge with his dogs. He desperately needs money to repay his debt to Sykes.
* Taurean Blacque and Carl Weintraub as Roscoe and DeSoto, respectively: Sykes&#x27;s violent Doberman Pinschers who bully Dodger and his friends. Roscoe is the apparent leader, while DeSoto seems to be the more vicious of the two.
* Robert Loggia as Sykes, a cold-hearted, immoral loan shark and shipyard agent who lent a considerable sum of money to Fagin and expects it paid back.
* Natalie Gregory as Jennifer &quot;Jenny&quot; Foxworth, a friendly, rich girl who adopts Oliver.
** Myhanh Tran provided the singing voice for Jenny.
* William Glover as Winston, the Foxworth family&#x27;s clumsy but warm-hearted butler.
* Bette Midler as Georgette, the Foxworth family&#x27;s prize-winning poodle. Vain and spoiled, she becomes jealous of Oliver but eventually accepts him and Fagin&#x27;s gang.
* Frank Welker (uncredited) as Louie the Sausage Vendor, an aggressive, bad-tempered hot dog vendor who appears early in the film when Oliver and Dodger steal his hot dogs. He is described by Dodger as &quot;a well-known enemy of the four-legged world,&quot; meaning that he hates both cats and dogs.

==Production==
=== Development ===
&quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; was the first animated film developed by Disney to begin production under the supervision of Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg; the duo, who had previously worked at Paramount Pictures as chairman and head of production, respectively, joined the company in 1984.

In late 1984 or 1985, Eisner and Katzenberg invited twenty film executives to pitch potential ideas for upcoming animated features, infamously called the &quot;Gong Show&quot;. After Ron Clements had pitched &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989) and &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; (2002) to Eisner and Katzenberg, story artist Pete Young suggested, &quot;&quot;Oliver Twist&quot; with dogs.&quot; The next day, Katzenberg, who had previously developed a live-action adaptation of the musical &quot;Oliver!&quot; at Paramount, approved the pitch for possible development, along with &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. Production started with a table reading of the novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; and watching the musical &quot;Oliver!&quot;. George Scribner and Richard Rich were announced as the directors of the project, while Pete Young was appointed as story supervisor. However, Young died unexpectedly in the fall of 1985, and Rich was fired from Disney about six months into production, leaving Scribner as the sole director. The film took six to nine months to be developed, and went through several rewrites during production. The first year of production was proved to be difficult. Some producers, directors, and male storyboard artists felt unhappy with the direction of the film, who thought that &quot;it had lost some of its contemporary edge.&quot; Because of negative feedback, Scribner tried to change the film to be &quot;less obvious with the material&quot; and include &quot;more sarcasm, more wit, [and] more bite.&quot; Scribner also desired the film to &quot;bring a more hip, contemporary sensibility&quot; of the period.

The film was named under the working title of &quot;Oliver and the Dodger&quot;, but it was later changed to &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;. Sharon Weltman once analyzed that it could be a homage to &quot;Oliver!&quot; due to some of the musical numbers being designated to be &quot;performed by Oliver and Company.&quot; Oliver and Dodger were originally two kittens, then two dogs, changing back and forth before it was decided that Oliver would be isolated if he was a &quot;different type of character.&quot; Due to considering Tina Turner to voice Rita, Rita&#x27;s first name was Tina, but it was changed to Nancy and later, in August 1986, Rita. Georgette was created by Scribner and its animators for the film. Sykes was the final character to be created for the film. The writers came up with the idea of Sykes&#x27;s breed being a Dobermann. Early drafts include Sykes developing a relationship between Oliver and Rita to establish the Dobermann&#x27;s attack. In the final adaptation, Scribner turned Oliver into a naïve kitten, Dodger and the gang into dogs, and Fagin into a human.

Some characters that were intended to appear in the film were also discarded. As work continued on &quot;Oliver&quot;, Roy E. Disney came up with an idea that Fagin would attempt to steal a rare panda from the Central Park Zoo, along with the gang, and that Oliver would have helped a panda return to the zoo. These concepts were seen in a Rough Working Copy, written as late as August 1986. The writers worked with the idea for approximately nine months before problems would occur with the story. According to Scribner, he explained that they were &quot;dissipating [their] focus of sympathy.&quot; The panda subplot was eventually dropped when he suggested to have Fagin hold Oliver for ransom because he was a valuable, rare Asian cat. The panda was also eventually replaced by Jenny. Jenny was originally intended to live with her mother, but the story crew changed her mother into a maid, and later, a butler. A policeman&#x27;s horse, Kaminski, who would always ask Dodger if he is staying out of trouble, was also intended to appear in the film.

=== Writing and script revisions ===
Throughout several scripts, some revision goals include giving Oliver &quot;more attitude&quot; and developing Oliver and his two relationships with Dodger and Rita in a draft dating September 24, 1985. In the novel and several adaptations, Oliver&#x27;s abandonment was in a workhouse. For the film, it was moved to the opening scene, depicting Oliver and the kittens in a box instead of a workhouse. The film&#x27;s opening was also intended to include Sykes&#x27;s two Dobermanns murdering Oliver&#x27;s parents, setting the story to focus on Oliver exacting his revenge as detailed in a draft. Dodger originally had a smaller role. Oliver&#x27;s most important relationship was intended to be with Rita (similar to Oliver and Nancy&#x27;s relationship in the novel and adaptations), but it was changed to Dodger. The writers intended for Fagin to visit Sykes&#x27; office with Einstein, who was attacked by the Dobermanns and &quot;carried out, bloodied and lifeless.&quot; During the film&#x27;s climax, Einstein was also intended to shake off Sykes&#x27; bandages, leap at the dogs, and then fling them back into the car. In the final film, Dodger took over Einstein&#x27;s &quot;two big scenes.&quot;

Rita originally had an implied relationship with one of the Sykes&#x27; Dobermanns, being referred as &quot;[her] ex&quot;. Their encounters include a sexual undertone during the alley scene and Rita turning on the television &quot;with a sexy bash of the hip&quot;, though both of the Dobermanns saw her romantically at that time. In the final film, the latter scene was cut, and Rita became a minor character. According to early story drafts, Rita was also going to be murdered like in the novel and adaptations. In a draft dating September 26, 1985, the writers were deciding whether to kill Rita or not. Later, in a draft dating October 21, 1985, they eventually decided to not kill her. However, Rita was planned to be injured with bandages, but it was revised. Tito&#x27;s romance with Georgette was not in the script, but it was developed later in the production during recording sessions. At the end of the film, the birthday party was originally for Georgette, but it was later changed for Jenny. Tito&#x27;s slap was also intended to appear during the film&#x27;s ending; it was later moved to an earlier scene.

===Casting and recording===

An open audition was held to find actors that suited the characters&#x27; personalities and designs. According to Disney&#x27;s former senior vice president for feature animation Peter Schneider, it was easy to cast pop music artists because they all had children on their own. Scribner and the executives wanted voices that believably represented a wide range of New Yorkers.

Billy Joel was one of the first actors in the film to be cast and the fifth person to audition for Dodger. Prior to his audition for Dodger, he turned down film roles for years because he was convinced that &quot;cameras would do terrible things for him.&quot; His former wife Christie Brinkley tried to convince Joel that that he should act because he might be a good actor, but Joel felt miserable. Joel also received several film scripts, but was never interested. A few years earlier, he was supposed to audition for Sergio Leone for the film &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; but felt &quot;too scared.&quot; During the film&#x27;s production, Scribner was told to pick someone who is &quot;New York street-smart&quot; with a &quot;savoir-faire attitude&quot;. Joel was recommended by a music director, but Scribner initially had mixed thoughts, questioning whether he could act. Because Joel was residing in New York at the time, Scribner had to choose whether he was right for the part before auditioning him. Joel auditioned for the role by telephone after being given dialogue, with Scribner as Oliver and Joel as Dodger. When Joel was hired, he was reluctant to perform an animated voice, but he confirmed he did it because it was a Disney movie, saying: &quot;I had just had a little girl. It&#x27;s a great way to do something that my little girl could see that she could relate to right away,&quot; referring to daughter Alexa, born in 1985. Joel also confirmed that he loved the &quot;old Disney movies&quot; and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, stating that his grandfather read all of Charles Dickens&#x27; novels. Joel started recording lines when his daughter was already born at the time. Many of his sessions were recorded at the Power Station, the Hit Factory, and East Hampton Studios in New York City. Others were being held during The Bridge Tour in the United States, Canada, the Soviet Union, and other countries. His sessions were recorded for over two years. Using &quot;method singing&quot;, Joel immediately used Leo Gorcey of the Dead End Kids as an inspiration for his character when he started reading the script, acting as the &quot;epitome of a tough kid who deep down was a nice guy.&quot; Scribner wanted Joel to &quot;sound like New York&quot;, but Joel responded, &quot;Nah, nah. We&#x27;re between Broadway and Eighth Avenue.&quot; Throughout his recording sessions, Joel felt that it was &quot;easier to get into character with each recording session.&quot; Joel has also stated that he was comfortable with recording his sessions and did not feel different from recording his songs. Despite script rewrites throughout the years, Joel suggested changes to his lines. Joel was finished with his sessions in December 1987.

34 actresses auditioned for the role of Georgette before it went to Bette Midler. Joey Lawrence auditioned for at least three or four times, had a callback, and was screen-tested before he was cast. Lawrence was assigned for ten sessions to record his lines for Oliver, but he has stated that he had done &quot;at least [twenty sessions].&quot; Lawrence recorded his dialogue for two-and-a-half years, starting his first session when he was the age of 10. Lawrence commented that his voice was &quot;extremely high&quot; when he started, but his voice &quot;dropped&quot; and &quot;struggled to [speak higher]&quot; as the months passed. Although Lawrence recorded his lines solely in most of his sessions, he once worked with Joel for approximately three hours. His final recording session was held in February 1988. Comedian Cheech Marin was the fifth person to audition for the chihuahua Tito. Because energy proved to be the key to Tito&#x27;s personality, Marin claimed, &quot;I was encouraged to ad-lib, but I&#x27;d say I just gave about 75% of the lines as they were written. The natural energy of a Chihuahua played right into that feeling. George [Scribner] was very encouraging as a director: He kept the energy level high at the recording sessions.&quot; Marin was assigned for four sessions, but it was estimated that he had done 15 sessions for the film. He recorded his dialogue for a course of one year. Marin overall felt enthusiastic about his role, stating he was in a film his child &quot;[could] watch everyday.&quot; William Glover was cast as the Foxworth&#x27;s family butler, Winston. In 1989, Scribner talked about Glover in an interview, stating &quot;He was great to work with; he was very professional, and he gave readings you&#x27;d never expect.&quot; Other cast members include Sheryl Lee Ralph for Rita and Roscoe Lee Browne for Francis. Ralph recorded her dialogue for 18 months.

In the recording studio, the actors read the lines to Scribner. Several recording sessions were done while the film went through several rewrites, causing Scribner to ask the voice cast to re-record different scenes that they already done. The cast recorded for two years, with each recording session lasting nearly two to three hours. According to Scribner, the actors enjoyed recording their lines, though some had to be shown early animation tests to know what the characters were doing.

=== Character designs ===
Andreas Deja and Mike Gabriel were the two main character designers that were involved in the film. Deja designed the basic look of the characters, while Gabriel added extra features to the characters. Tito was animated and designed by directing animator Hendel Butoy, and Fagin and Sykes were designed by character animator Glen Keane. An animal trainer brought each of the dogs&#x27; breeds in a small area of Walt Disney Feature Animation as a guide for the animators. After the characters were cast, the character models were redesigned to match the vocal performances. Dodger&#x27;s design was started to evolve to look like Joel after his lines were recorded. Dodger&#x27;s design was also thinner before getting &quot;beefed up&quot;. Winston was redesigned after William Glover had recorded his lines, in which the character was given a slightly heavier stature. His features were also revised, including his head being drawn slightly smaller, his &quot;rear end&quot; becoming slightly larger, and his hands and feet being slightly more delicate. Oliver&#x27;s character design was based on the kitten from the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; short &quot;Lend a Paw&quot; (1941).

=== Animation ===
When development began, Scribner initially ignored colloquialisms and references to the period at the time, which were done to avoid &quot;Oliver&quot; being topical and dated. Scribner reversed his decision when he thought that the &quot;feeling that [&quot;Oliver&quot;] is really occurring&quot; would decline if it was not true to the period, which included the art of New York City and several billboards, advertisements, and etcetera. Scribner borrowed a technique from &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; (1955) by blocking out the scenes on real streets, and then photographing them with cameras mounted off the ground. In this way, the animators would use the photos as templates to provide a real dog&#x27;s-eye view of the action. A lot of animators also shot references on videotape and printed them out with a Minolta printer.

As of April 20, 1988, &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; was already in the phase of animation, which is the final phase of production for the film. The traditional animation was handled by a younger generation of Disney animators, including supervising animators Glen Keane, Ruben A. Aquino, Mike Gabriel, Hendel Butoy, and Mark Henn, as the &quot;Nine Old Men&quot; had retired in the early 1980s. Throughout two and a half years of production, 300 artists and technicians were involved in the film, and a million of story sketches and 119,275 animation cels were produced. Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill was the database for the New York City skyline, which was recreated for the film. Backgrounds were made with &quot;very simple washes without an acetate line on the top&quot; to match the main setting and the characters. Backgrounds were also done using the xeroxgraphic process. The backgrounds of Jenny&#x27;s apartment were originally tended to include gray Xerox lines to balance a distinction between the environment of Fagin&#x27;s barge and the wharf, and Jenny&#x27;s apartment, but never happened. The characters&#x27; movements were based on their actors&#x27; movements, which were sketched by artists from videotape recordings of the movements of the actors, including Billy Joel, Cheech Marin, and Joey Lawrence. The walking and running movements of the animals were timed from the animated works of cats and dogs in &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; and &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; (1961), which included work from Ollie Johnston, Marc Davis, Frank Thomas, and Milt Kahl. According to the animation team&#x27;s experiences, Jenny was the most difficult character to animate. In an article of &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1988, Katzenberg explained that &quot;audiences are more critical of the realistic animation of humans than they are of the caricatured animation of humans and animals.&quot; Katzenberg also commented that they had to be prepared because most of the lead characters in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989) are humans.

Eleven minutes of the film used &quot;computer-assisted imagery&quot;, such as cityscapes, Sykes&#x27;s limo, the Brooklyn Bridge, Fagin&#x27;s trike, the interior of the tunnel, and the stairway scene during &quot;Perfect Isn&#x27;t Easy&quot;. Prior to its additions, the backgrounds would be lined over and painted. The computer animation would then be generated with small pieces and hooked together by a computer with &quot;time-consuming effects&quot;. Afterwards, the characters would be traditionally animated. The first object to be tested with computer animation was Fagin&#x27;s trike, which was being made up of 18 parts. According to Scribner on &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1988, he has stated that it helped &quot;generate the rhythm and action that goes with the [New York City setting].&quot;

=== Music ===
An attempt was made earlier on to involve the music with the film. Scribner wrote a &quot;mental note&quot; to not treat &quot;Oliver&quot; as a musical where the story would &quot;abruptly stop&quot; and &quot;go into a song.&quot; Each song of the film was instead written as an extension of a character. The soundtrack of &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; had multiple producers, with each song written with a different composer and producer, and a different arrangement date. Various songwriters submitted songs in a range of musical styles, but many of them did not fit with the film&#x27;s premise.

Dodger&#x27;s song &quot;Why Should I Worry?&quot; was the first song written for the film. It was originally written as dialogue, but Scribner suggested the songwriters, &quot;Forget where we&#x27;re going to take this music, or the fact that it will be on an album. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s released as a single or not. Write for the picture, write for character.&quot; Joel was initially approached to write a song, but he decided he would &quot;rather act in the movie.&quot; Joel agreed to sing the song despite the song not written by himself. It was the first song sung by Joel that he did not write. A gospel and blues musical number was intended to open the film, but it was considered &quot;too dark&quot;. At his suggestion of his friend David Geffen, Katzenberg brought in lyricist Howard Ashman, who composed the song &quot;Once Upon a Time in New York City&quot;. Tina Turner was also intended to sing the opening number. &quot;It&#x27;s a Jungle Out There&quot;, written by Herbie Hancock, had Jenny playing with Oliver while playing a record with a &quot;jungle rhythm&quot;, causing the setting to transition from Jenny&#x27;s bedroom to an imagination taking place in a jungle. The song was meant to be used in the film, but it was discarded after the story was revised.

Katzenberg wanted to recruit a team of singer-songwriters to provide a song, which included Billy Joel, Barry Manilow, and Huey Lewis. Schneider felt Katzenberg&#x27;s idea was a wrong way to approach a musical. According to Schneider, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, which was concurrently in development, was the right approach as the film needed &quot;a unifying score and lyrics.&quot; Billy Joel and Bette Midler, who voiced Dodger and Georgette respectively, also performed their characters&#x27; songs, &quot;Why Should I Worry?&quot; and &quot;Perfect Isn&#x27;t Easy&quot;. The soundtrack of &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; contains an instrumental score by J. A. C. Redford, under the supervision of Carole Childs. Redford was hired to compose the score because of his previous collaboration with Disney music executive Chris Montan on the television series &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;. The soundtrack was first released on November 11, 1988 by Walt Disney Records. It was the first soundtrack album release under the Walt Disney Records label. No songs were released as singles due to contractual agreements. However, &quot;Why Should I Worry?&quot; did receive radio airplay in Philadelphia. The soundtrack was re-released on February 29, 1996.

The songs of the film received acclaim from film critics, particularly &quot;Why Should I Worry?&quot; and &quot;Perfect Isn&#x27;t Easy&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave a positive review on the songs in his review, praising three songs, including &quot;Why Should I Worry?&quot; and &quot;Perfect Isn&#x27;t Easy&quot;. Beth Dunlop of &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; commented that &quot;the music has a wonderful range from sweetness to syncopation.&quot; Bob Ross of &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot; praised the soundtrack as &quot;sappy&quot;. Dave Jewett of &quot;The Columbian&quot; commented that &quot;Why Should I Worry?&quot; &quot;sounds like like it could be Joel&#x27;s next hit.&quot; Lin Connery of &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; praised &quot;Why Should I Worry?&quot; and &quot;Perfect Isn&#x27;t Easy&quot;, the latter being stated that Midler &quot;almost steals the show with her petulant performance.&quot; Joe Baltake of &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; stated that &quot;the few songs [there] are delightfully urbane in a childlike way.&quot; Glenn Lovell of Knight-Ridder picked &quot;Why Should I Worry?&quot; and &quot;Perfect Isn&#x27;t Easy&quot; as the most memorable songs in the film. Malcolm L. Johnson of &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; described &quot;Once Upon a Time in New York City&quot; and &quot;Why Should I Worry?&quot; as &quot;boffo opening numbers&quot; and &quot;Perfect Isn&#x27;t Easy&quot; as a &quot;show-stopper&quot;. Jeff Strickler of &quot;Star Tribune&quot; commented that &quot;Why Should I Worry?&quot; is the &quot;snappiest song&quot;, with the other songs that stood out being &quot;Streets of Gold&quot; and &quot;Perfect Isn&#x27;t Easy&quot;. Ben Yagoda of &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; stated that a few of them are &quot;so catchy that [he was] still humming them a week after seeing the film.&quot; Linda Cook of &quot;Quad-City Times&quot; had an enthusiastic response about the music, praising the songs as &quot;great, particularly &#x27;Why Should I Worry?&#x27;.&quot; Cook also commented: &quot;Other offerings from Bette Midler, Huey Lewis, and Ruth Pointer could a provide a best-selling soundtrack.&quot; Bruce R. Miller of &quot;The Sioux City Journal&quot; said that the &quot;Top 40 score&quot;, along with the choreography, &quot;both work beautifully&quot;. Miller described &quot;Once Upon a Time in New York City&quot; as &quot;Oscar-worthy&quot; and stated that &quot;by the time Billy Joel checks in with &#x27;Why Should I Worry?&#x27;, the film is rocking.&quot; Jack Daugherty of &quot;Record-Journal&quot; positively reviewed the soundtrack as &quot;one of the most contagious musical scores of any of Disney movie in recent memory.&quot; During the film&#x27;s theatrical re-release in 1996, Barry Walter of &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; praised &quot;Perfect Isn&#x27;t Easy&quot;, saying that it &quot;suggests the wit and panache of gay sensibility that Disney would embrace with great success in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.&quot;

Track list for 1996 re-release soundtrack

==Release==
&quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; premiered theatrically in North America on November 18, 1988―the same day on which Disney celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Mickey Mouse short, &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; (1928). It was also the first to be released as a part of a brand new schedule requested by Katzenberg, which called for a new animated Disney film to be released every single year, similar to Walt Disney&#x27;s intentions for his animated features during the 1940s.

===Marketing===
&quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; was the first Disney animated film to include real world advertised products. More than 30 company logos and brand names were shown in the film, including Kodak, Dr. Scholls, Sony, Diet Coke, Tab, McDonald&#x27;s, Yamaha, Ryder, and &quot;USA Today&quot;. Katzenberg urged the marketing campaign to focus on the classic Dickens novel and the pop score, and promotional tie-ins included Sears, which produced and manufactured products with themes inspired from the film, and McDonald&#x27;s which sold Christmas musical ornaments based on Oliver and Dodger, and small finger puppets based on the characters in a Happy Meal. For its theatrical re-release in 1996, the film was accompanied with a promotional campaign by Burger King and consumer rebate and refund offers up to $15 from Kodak, Con Agra Cuisine, and Walt Disney Home Video.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; was not distributed by Buena Vista International, but by Warner Bros. Buena Vista International did, however, release the film on home video.

===Home media===
Despite its successful box office performance, &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; was not released on home video, although it was one of the most requested Disney films. After its theatrical re-release, &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; was released on VHS and widescreen LaserDisc in the United States on September 24, 1996, for a limited time. The VHS release sold 10 million copies. The film was also released on home video in the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, France and other countries in 1997. It was later released on DVD on May 14, 2002. A 20th Anniversary Edition DVD was released on February 3, 2009, and a 25th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray was released on August 6, 2013. &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; became available for streaming on Disney+ since it launched on November 12, 2019.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; and Don Bluth&#x27;s &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; opened on the same weekend in the United States and Canada; the latter film debuted at number one grossing $7.5 million in 1,395 theaters while the former opened in fourth place, grossing $4 million in 952 theaters. Nevertheless, &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; out-grossed &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; with a total gross in the United States and Canada of $53 million compared to the latter&#x27;s $46 million. In the United States, the film surpassed Bluth&#x27;s &quot;An American Tail&quot; as the highest grossing animated film from its initial run. It was also the first animated film to gross $100 million worldwide in its initial release. Its success prompted then-Disney animation executive Peter Schneider, to announce the company&#x27;s plans to release animated features annually.

On March 29, 1996, Disney re-released the film in direct competition with &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven 2&quot;, grossing $4.5 million in its opening weekend. It went on to earn $21 million in total taking its lifetime domestic gross to $74 million and its worldwide total to over $121 million.

===Critical response===
&quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; was released to mixed reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that of critics gave the film positive reviews based on reviews, with an average rating of . Its consensus states, &quot;Predictable and stodgy, &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; isn&#x27;t one of Disney&#x27;s best, though its colorful cast of characters may be enough to entertain young viewers looking for a little adventure.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 58 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Some critics praised the film for its animation, characters, and songs. Animation historian Charles Solomon wrote a favorable review, stating the film &quot;offers virtually ideal family holiday fare. The cartoon action will delight young children, while older ones, who usually reject animation as &#x27;kid stuff,&#x27; will enjoy the rock songs and hip characters, especially the brash Tito.&quot; Writing for &quot;People&quot; magazine, Peter Travers opined in his review, &quot;Too slight to rank with such Disney groundbreakers as &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia&quot;, the film is more on the good-fun level of &quot;The Lady and the Tramp&quot; and &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot;. But why kick? With its captivating characters, sprightly songs and zap-happy animation, &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; adds up to a tip-top frolic.&quot; Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; felt that the film &quot;retrieves some of the old Disney charm with tail-wagging energy and five catchy songs.&quot; Likewise, fellow &quot;Washington Post&quot; film critic Rita Kempley praised the songs and animation, and called it a &quot;happy adaptation of the Victorian classic.&quot;

Other critics found the animation &quot;uninspired&quot;, the musical scores &quot;insipid&quot;, and the storytelling &quot;witless&quot;. On the television program &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;, Gene Siskel gave the film a thumbs down. Siskel stated, &quot;When you measure this film to the company&#x27;s legacy of classics, it doesn&#x27;t match up&quot; as he complained &quot;the story is too fragmented…because Oliver’s story gets too sidetracked from the story in the film that gets convoluted, too calculated for the Bette Midler, Billy Joel crowd as well as little kids.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film a &quot;marginal thumbs up&quot; as he described the film as &quot;harmless, inoffensive.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote the film &quot;looks cheesy and second-rate. The animation is somewhat better than the usual stuff seen on Saturday morning television, but not much. It is totally without distinctive visual style, suggesting only the sort of bland cartoon drawings one finds in a manual of first-aid instructions.&quot;

Retrospectively, it continued to receive mixed reviews. In 1991, film historian Bob Thomas wrote that some of the Disney animators he interviewed unfavorably viewed the film as &quot;another talking dog-and-cat movie.&quot; &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; creator John Kricfalusi suggested that the film was derivative of Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s works, and jokingly suggested its use as a form of punishment. During the film&#x27;s re-release, Barry Walters, reviewing for &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;, panned the film as &quot;a rather shabby transitional work, one that lacks the sophistication of today&#x27;s &#x27;toons and doesn&#x27;t hold up to the Disney classics of yesteryear.&quot; Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide called &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; an &quot;episodic film, short on charm, that only now and then provides glimpses of stylish animation.&quot; Writing for Common Sense Media, Nell Minow gave the film 3 stars out of 5, concluding that the film &quot;can&#x27;t compete with Disney classics, but [is] still fun.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Legacy==
Like other Disney animated characters, the characters of the film have recurring cameo appearances in the television series &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. In the episode &quot;Pluto Saves the Day&quot;, Dodger (voiced by Jess Harnell instead of Billy Joel) leads a musical group known as Pet Shop Dogs, formed by other dogs of Disney animated films, also including Tito, Francis and DeSoto, performing the song &quot;Everybody Wants to Be a Woof&quot; (a parody of the song &quot;Everybody Wants to Be a Cat&quot; from &quot;The Aristocats&quot;).

Along with other Walt Disney Animation Studios characters, the characters of the film have cameo appearances in the 2023 short film &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Artemisium or Artemision was a series of naval engagements over three days during the second Persian invasion of Greece. The battle took place simultaneously with the land battle at Thermopylae, in August or September 480 BC, off the coast of Euboea and was fought between an alliance of Greek city-states, including Sparta, Athens, Corinth and others, and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I.

The Persian invasion was a delayed response to the defeat of the first Persian invasion of Greece, which had been ended by the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon. King Xerxes had amassed a huge army and navy, and set out to conquer all of Greece. The Athenian general Themistocles proposed that the Allied Greeks block the advance of the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae and simultaneously block the Persian navy at the Straits of Artemisium. An Allied naval force of 271 triremes was thus dispatched to await the arrival of the Persians.

Approaching Artemisium towards the end of summer, the Persian navy was caught in a gale off the coast of Magnesia and lost around a third of their 1200 ships. After arriving at Artemisium, the Persians sent a detachment of 200 ships around the coast of Euboea in an attempt to trap the Greeks, but these were caught in another storm and shipwrecked. The main action of the battle took place after two days of smaller engagements. The two sides fought all day, with roughly equal losses; however, the smaller Allied fleet could not afford the losses.

After the engagement, the Allies received news of the defeat of the Allied army at Thermopylae. Since their strategy required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held, and given their losses, the Allies decided to withdraw to Salamis. The Persians overran and gained control over Phocis, then Boeotia, and finally entered Attica where they captured the now-evacuated Athens. However, seeking a decisive victory over the Allied fleet, the Persians were later defeated at the Battle of Salamis in late 480 BC. Fearing being trapped in Europe, Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia, leaving Mardonius to complete the conquest of Greece. The following year, however, saw an Allied army decisively defeat the Persians at the Battle of Plataea, thereby ending the Persian invasion.

== Background ==
The Persian emperor Xerxes I decided that the Hellespont had to be bridged for his army to cross to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos. By early 480 BC, the preparations were complete, and the army Xerxes had mustered at Sardis marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges.The Athenians had also been preparing for war with the Persians since the mid-480s BC, and in 482 BC the decision was taken, under the guidance of the Athenian politician Themistocles, to build a massive fleet of triremes that would be necessary for the Greeks to fight the Persians. However, the Athenians did not have the manpower to fight on land and sea; and therefore combating the Persians would require an alliance of Greek city states. In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water, but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta. Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed. It had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation. This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.

The &#x27;congress&#x27; met again in the spring of 480 BC. A Thessalian delegation suggested that the allies could muster in the narrow Vale of Tempe, on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes&#x27;s advance. A force of 10,000 hoplites was dispatched to the Vale of Tempe, through which they believed the Persian army would have to pass. However, once there, they were warned by Alexander I of Macedon that the vale could be bypassed through the Sarantoporo Pass, and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelming, the Greeks retreated. Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont.

Themistocles therefore suggested a second strategy to the allies. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) would require the army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. The pass could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of the Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual strategy was adopted by the congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made contingency plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should all else fail, whilst the women and children of Athens were evacuated &quot;en masse&quot; to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.

== Prelude ==

The Allied fleet sailed north to Cape Artemisium once it became known that the Persian army was advancing along the coast past Mount Olympus, probably around late July or the beginning of August. The Allies took up station at Artemisium, most likely beaching their ships at the headland, from which they could quickly launch them as needed. The Allies sent three ships to Skiathos as scouts to provide warning of the approach of the Persian fleet but two weeks passed without sight. Finally, ten Sidonian triremes arrived off Skiathos, sent on a scouting mission by the Persian fleet anchored at Therma in Macedonia. Three of these ships crashed into a reef called the Ant/Myrmex, located midway between Skiathos and Magnesia. The main Allied fleet was informed of their arrival by a fire-beacon lit on the island. However, the Allied patrol ships themselves were caught unaware and two were captured, whilst one ran aground. According to Herodotus, in the ensuing confusion, unsure whether or not the beacon heralded the arrival of the whole Persian fleet, as a precaution the whole Allied fleet launched into the straits of Artemisium. Once it became clear that the Persian fleet was not going to arrive that day, they decided to sail to Chalcis, halfway down on the western coast of Euboea, leaving men on the heights of Euboea to warn of the actual arrival of the Persian ships.

Historians suggest that the Allies may have misinterpreted the Persian movements and come to the mistaken conclusion that the Persians were sailing east around Skiathos, aiming to sail around the eastern side of Euboea. The signals sent by fire beacons must have been very simplistic, and potentially interpreted wrongly; alternatively, the signallers may have genuinely believed that the Persian fleet was sailing to the east of Skiathos. If the Persians sailed around the outer, eastern side of Euboea, they could head straight to Attica, and thereby cut off the Allied fleet&#x27;s line of retreat. Furthermore, the Persians had enough ships to attempt to both attack the Straits of Artemisium, and sail around Euboea. The withdrawal to Chalcis therefore gave the Allies the opportunity to escape from the Straits of Euboea if the Persians did travel around the outside of Euboea, but also allowed them to return to Artemisium if necessary. In this context, the watchers left on Euboea could inform the Allies if the Persian fleet did indeed sail east of Euboea. The Allied fleet thus continued to wait at Chalcis. Nevertheless, the Allies, undoubtedly anxious about facing a Persian fleet that so greatly outnumbered them, may have somewhat overreacted.

Around ten days later, the Persian army arrived at Thermopylae, and the Allies at Chalcis were informed by a ship, captained by Abronichus, which had been appointed to liaise between the army and the fleet. However, there was still no sign of the Persian fleet, and the first day the Persians spent at Thermopylae passed without them launching an attack. The next day, the Persian fleet finally drew near to Artemisium, heading for the Gap of Skiathos located between the coast of Magnesia and Skiathos, when a summer gale (a &#x27;Hellesponter&#x27; – probably a north-easterly storm) broke, driving the Persian fleet onto the mountainous coast. The storm lasted two days, wrecking approximately one third of the Persian ships. Meanwhile, at Thermopylae, the Persians had continued to wait for the Greeks to disperse, also choosing not to attack during the storm.

The day after the storm finished, the Allied fleet returned to Artemisium to protect the flank of the army at Thermopylae. The following day, (the fifth since the Persians had arrived at Thermopylae) the Persian army began their attacks on the Allied army at Thermopylae. The same day, the Persian fleet finally appeared through the Gap of Sciathos, and began mooring on the coast opposite Artemisium, at Aphetae. According to Herodotus, 15 Persian ships blundered into the Allied lines, and were captured. Although clearly storm damaged, the Persian fleet still probably outnumbered the Allies by nearly 3:1. As a result, the Allies contemplated withdrawing completely. The Euboeans, not wanting to be abandoned to the Persians, bribed Themistocles to try to ensure that the Allied fleet remained. Since the joint operation at Thermopylae and Artemisium was his strategy in the first place, it is likely this is exactly what Themistocles wanted, and this bribe allowed him in turn to bribe the Spartan and Corinthian admirals, Eurybiades and Adeimantus to remain at Artemisium.

Later on that day, a deserter from the Persian fleet, a Greek called Scyllias, swam into the Allied camp. He brought bad news for the Allies – whilst most of the Persian fleet was undergoing repairs, the Persians had detached 200 seaworthy ships to sail around the outer coast of Euboea, to block the escape route of the Allied fleet. The Persians did not want to attack the Allies yet, because they thought the Allies would simply flee, and so they sought to trap them. The Allies resolved to go and meet this detachment, to prevent being trapped, though they planned to leave by nightfall to prevent the Persians becoming aware of their plans.

The Allies most likely realised that this situation presented them with an opportunity to destroy an isolated part of the Persian fleet. Herodotus is not clear on where the Allies planned to meet this detachment, only that they resolved to do so. One possibility is that they planned to sail down the Straits of Euboea, and hope that the other Allied ships, patrolling the coast of Attica, followed the Persians as they entered the Straits of Euboea from the south; then the Persians might themselves be caught in a trap. Alternatively, the Allies may have planned to ambush the detachment as it passed by Artemisium, on its journey from Aphetae. Either way, they decided to make a demonstration towards the Persian lines during what remained of the day, to convince the Persians that they were planning to stay at Artemisium. Herodotus also suggests that this was an opportunity for them to assess Persian seamanship and tactics. The Allies probably waited until late afternoon so that there was little chance of being drawn into a full scale engagement; they did not want to suffer casualties before sailing to meet to the Persian detachment. These decisions finally led to the beginning of the battle.

=== Chronology ===
The exact chronology of the battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium, and their relation to each other is somewhat unclear. The chronology below represents an estimated reconstruction of the time-line, following Lazenby.

== Opposing forces ==

=== Persian fleet ===

Herodotus gives a detailed description of the Persian fleet that assembled at Doriskos in spring 480 BC (see table). However, after the fleet was struck the storm off the coast of Magnesia, approximately one third of the fleet was lost. Thus, by Herodotus&#x27;s reckoning, the Persian fleet would have had approximately 800 triremes at Artemisium.

Some modern scholars have accepted these numbers, especially since the ancient sources are unusually consistent on this point. Other authors reject this number, with 1,207 being seen as more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliad, and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.

=== Greek fleet ===
Herodotus claims there were 280 ships in the Greek fleet at the Battle of Artemisium, made up of the following contingents (numbers in parentheses refer to Penteconters, other ships are all Triremes):

The Athenians had been building up a large fleet since 483 BC, ostensibly for their ongoing conflict with Aegina. However, it is probable that this build up, initiated by Themistocles, was also made with a future conflict with the Persians in mind. The Athenians initially requested command of the Allied fleet, but let Eurybiades of Sparta command it to preserve unity.

== Strategic and tactical considerations ==
Strategically, the Allied mission was simple. The fleet needed to protect the flank of the army at Thermopylae, whilst not being cut off themselves. For the Persians, the strategic situation was equally simple, although with more options. They needed to force their way through either one of Thermopylae or Artemisium (since holding both was necessary for the Allied effort), or to outflank either position. Outflanking the Straits of Artemisium was theoretically much easier than outflanking Thermopylae, by sailing around the east coast of Euboea. The Greek position at Artemisium may have been chosen in order to watch for such attempts. If narrowness of the channel had been the only determinant, the Allies could have found a better position near the city of Histiaea.

The Persians were at a significant tactical advantage, outnumbering the Allies and having &quot;better sailing&quot; ships. The &quot;better sailing&quot; that Herodotus mentions was probably due to the superior seamanship of the crews; most of the Athenian ships (and therefore the majority of the fleet) were newly built, and had inexperienced crews. The most common naval tactics in the Mediterranean area at the time were ramming (triremes were equipped with a ram at the bows), or boarding by ship-borne marines (which essentially turned a sea battle into a land one). The Persians and Asiatic Greeks had by this time begun to use a manoeuver known as &quot;diekplous&quot;. It is not entirely clear what this was, but it probably involved sailing into gaps between enemy ships and then ramming them in the side. This maneuver would have required skilled sailing, and therefore the Persians would have been more likely to employ it. The Allies, however, developed tactics specifically to counter this.

Herodotus suggests that the Allied ships were heavier and, by implication, less maneuverable. Their weight would further reduce the likelihood of the Allied ships employing the &quot;diekplous&quot;. The source of this heaviness is uncertain; possibly the Allied ships were bulkier in construction. Another suggestion is that the heaviness was caused by the weight of fully armoured hoplite marines. The Allies may have had extra marines on board if their ships were less maneuverable, since boarding would then be the main tactic available to them (at the cost of making the ships even heavier). Indeed, Herodotus refers to the Greeks capturing ships, rather than sinking them.

== Battle ==

=== First day ===
When the Persians saw the Allied fleet rowing towards them, they decided to seize the opportunity to attack, even though it was late in the day, as they thought they would win an easy victory. They quickly advanced on the much smaller Allied fleet. However, the Allies had come up with a tactic for this situation, where they turned their &quot;bows on to the barbarians, [and] they drew their sterns together in the middle&quot;. This is usually taken to mean that they formed into a circle, with their rams pointing outwards; Thucydides reports that in the Peloponnesian War, Peloponnesian fleets twice adopted a circular formation, with their sterns together. However, Herodotus does not actually use the word circle, and Lazenby points out the difficulty of forming a circle of 250 ships (the Peloponnesian fleets had 30–40 ships). It is thus possible the Allies formed into more of a crescent formation, with the wings drawn back to prevent the Persian ships sailing around the Allied line. Whatever the case, it seems likely that this maneuver was intended to negate the superior Persian seamanship, and perhaps specifically the use of &quot;diekplous&quot;.
Having assumed this formation upon the giving of a prearranged signal, the Allied ships moved suddenly outwards from this position at a second signal, rowing into the Persian ships and catching them off guard. Their superior seamanship negated, the Persians came off worst from the encounter with 30 of their ships captured or sunk. During the battle a Persian ship, captained by Antidorus of Lemnos, defected to the Allies. Nightfall then ended the battle, with the Allies having fared better than they possibly expected to.

During the night, another storm broke (this time probably a thunder-storm, possibly with a south easterly wind), preventing the Allies from setting off southwards to counter the Persian detachment sent around the outside of Euboea. However, the storm also hit the Persian detachment of ships, driving them off course and onto the rocky coast of &#x27;the Hollows&#x27; of Euboea. This part of the Persian fleet was thus also shipwrecked, losing most of the ships.

=== Second day ===

The following day (which was also the second day of the battle of Thermopylae) the Persian fleet, now recovering from the two storms, declined to attack the Allies, and instead attempted to make their fleet seaworthy again. News of the shipwreck off Euboea reached the Allies that day, as well as a reinforcement of 53 ships from Athens.

Again waiting until late afternoon, the Allies took the opportunity to attack a patrol of Cilician ships, destroying them, before retreating as night fell. These ships were possibly survivors of the wrecked detachment sent around Euboea, or were perhaps anchored in an isolated harbour.

=== Third day ===
On the third day of the battle the Persian fleet was ready to attack the Allied lines in full force. Seeing the Persian fleet assemble, the Allies attempted to block the Straits of Artemisium as best they could, and waited for the Persians to attack. The Persians formed their ships into a semicircle and tried to enclose the Allied fleet, upon which the Allies rowed forward and joined battle. The battle raged all day long, with the Allies hard put to defend their line. When the fleets finally disengaged at nightfall, both sides had suffered roughly equal losses. However, the smaller Allied fleet could scarcely afford such losses; half the Athenian ships (the largest contingent in the fleet) were damaged or lost.
According to Herodotus, the Athenians were the best fighters on the Allied side. On the Achaemenid side, the best results had been achieved by the Egyptians, who wore a heavy individual equipment comparable to Greek hoplites, and were able to vanquish five Greek ships:
Returning to Artemisium, the Allies saw that they would probably not be able to hold the line for another day, such were their losses. They thus debated whether they should withdraw from Artemisium, whilst they awaited news from Thermopylae. Themistocles ordered the men to slaughter and barbecue the flocks of the Euboeans, so that they would not fall into Persian hands. Abronichus arrived on the liaison ship from Thermopylae and told the Allies of the destruction of the Allied rearguard at Thermopylae. Since holding the Straits of Artemisium now no longer held any strategic purpose, and given their losses, the Allies decided to evacuate immediately.

== Aftermath ==
The Persians were alerted to the withdrawal of the Greeks by a boat from Histiaea, but did not at first believe it. They sent some ships to see if this was the case, and finding that it was, the whole fleet set sail for Artemisium in the morning. The Persians then sailed on to Histiaea and sacked the surrounding region.

The Allied fleet sailed to Salamis, off the coast of Attica, to assist with the evacuation of the remaining Athenians. En route, Themistocles left inscriptions addressed to the Ionian Greek crews of the Persian fleet on all springs of water that they might stop at, asking them to defect to the Allied cause:

Following Thermopylae, the Persian army burned and sacked the Boeotian cities that had not submitted to them—Plataea and Thespiae—and then marched on the now evacuated city of Athens. 
Meanwhile, the Allies (for the most part Peloponnesian) prepared to defend the Isthmus of Corinth, demolishing the single road that led through it, and building a wall across it. As at Thermopylae, to make this an effective strategy required the Allied navy to stage a simultaneous blockade, barring the passage of the Persian navy across the Saronic Gulf, so that troops could not be landed directly on the Peloponnese. However, instead of a mere blockade, Themistocles persuaded the Allies to seek a decisive victory against the Persian fleet. Luring the Persian navy into the Straits of Salamis in September, the Allied fleet was able to destroy much of the Persian fleet, which essentially ended the threat to the Peloponnese.

Fearing that the Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes retreated with much of the army back to Asia. He left a hand picked force under Mardonius to complete the conquest the following year. However, under pressure from the Athenians, the Peloponnesian Allies eventually agreed to try to force Mardonius to battle, and marched on Attica. Mardonius withdrew to Boeotia to lure the Greeks into open terrain and the two sides eventually met near the city of Plataea. There, at the Battle of Plataea in August 479 BC, the Greek army won a decisive victory, destroying much of the Persian army, and ending the invasion of Greece. Meanwhile, at the near-simultaneous naval Battle of Mycale the Greeks destroyed much of the remaining Persian fleet, thereby reducing the threat of further invasions.

=== Spoils ===
The archaeologist had posited that loot was captured after the battle. The historian Jan van Rookhuijzen says that the capture of loot is not confirmed, but makes note of Herodotus listing multiple details about the Persian armor in his account. The people of Peparethus had captured two Carian warships, possibly during the aftermath of the battle. Gauer, however, argues that the seizure of these two ships took place at the time of the Persian retreat from Greece.

== Topography ==
The Myrmex reef mentioned by Herodotus has been identified with the modern Lefkari reef.

== Historiography ==
Considered by itself, Artemisium was a relatively insignificant battle. The Allies did not defeat the Persian navy, nor prevent it from advancing further along the coast of Greece. Conversely, neither did the Persians destroy the Greek fleet, nor irreparably weaken it. The battle was thus an indecisive one, which pleased neither side.

Nevertheless, in the wider context of the Greco-Persian wars, it was a very significant battle for the Allies. The Allies had demonstrated to themselves that they could stand up to the Persian navy, even having the better of some encounters. For many of the Allied crews, it was their first taste of battle, and the experience gained was invaluable at the forthcoming Battle of Salamis. Moreover, fighting the Persians at Artemisium allowed the Greek admirals to see how the Persian fleet performed, and gave them insights into how it might be beaten. In addition, the events before and during Artemisium were crucial in cutting down the size of the Persian fleet (even if this was not all due to military action), meaning that the odds faced by the Allies at the Battle of Salamis were not overwhelming. 

The Athenian poet Pindar had said that Artemisium was &quot;where the sons of the Athenians laid the shining foundation-stone of freedom&quot;. Plutarch would quote Pindar to say that Athenians took pride in the battle of Artemisium. In his work &quot;De Herodoti malignitate&quot; (the lies of Herodotus), Plutarch finds a fault with the account of Artemisium given by Herodotus: the latter had understated the achievements of the Athenians. The battle was mentioned by Aristophanes in his work &quot;Lysistrata&quot;, and by Isocrates in his work &quot;Panegyricus&quot;. Simonides of Ceos had written a poem on Artemisium, with allusions to the abduction of the Athenian princess Oreithyia by the wind god Boreas.

<text>Beethoven is a 1992 American family comedy film, directed by Brian Levant and written by John Hughes (under the pseudonym &quot;Edmond Dantès&quot;) and Amy Holden Jones. The film&#x27;s story centers on a St. Bernard dog named after a German composer who finds a home with a suburban family. The film received mixed reviews from critics and earned $147.2 million worldwide. The film spawned a franchise, including a short-lived animated TV series. A sequel, &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s 2nd&quot;, was released the following year.

==Plot==
Two thieves, Harvey and Vernon, steal a group of puppies from a pet store. A St. Bernard puppy escapes and sneaks into the nearby home of the Newton family. The patriarch George is a control freak and a workaholic; he does not want a dog, but his wife Alice and their children (Ryce, Ted, and Emily) convince him to take the dog in. The dog is named &quot;Beethoven&quot; when Emily plays a portion of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony on the piano and he barks along to it.

Beethoven quickly grows into a large dog, and George must clean up after the lovable but slobbery, mischievous animal. The dog becomes an important part of the family: he helps Ryce talk to her crush Mark, scares off some bullies harming Ted, and saves Emily&#x27;s life when she falls into an irresponsible babysitter&#x27;s swimming pool. George still maintains his dislike, which is further aggravated when the dog&#x27;s antics ruin a barbecue he is hosting for Brad and Brie Wilson, unpleasant venture capitalists looking to invest in and, unbeknownst to George, swindle him out of his car air freshener firm.

The Newtons take Beethoven to veterinarian Dr. Herman Varnick for a routine medical exam, unaware that Varnick is secretly involved in unethical animal experiments and is seeking large-skulled dogs to test ammunition on. Dr. Varnick tells George of a supposed mental instability among St. Bernards that makes them potentially dangerous and violent, advising him to watch Beethoven closely for any sign of viciousness. Later, under the pretense of doing a follow-up exam on Beethoven, Varnick visits the Newton home. After applying fake blood onto his arm and Beethoven&#x27;s nose, Varnick repeatedly hits Beethoven until the dog retaliates, unaware that Emily has seen him. When the rest of the family comes outside to rescue Varnick, he claims Beethoven attacked him without provocation and must be euthanized. Varnick also threatens to press charges if the Newtons refuse. Despite Emily&#x27;s protests that Varnick is lying, George reluctantly takes Beethoven to Varnick&#x27;s office. On the way there, George remembers that his own father took the family dog to be put down at the vet, something George never forgave him for. George worries that his family will similarly hate him; when he returns home, his fears are realized when his children refuse to eat dinner with him.

Alice convinces George that they should believe their own daughter, not a stranger. The Newtons all return to Varnick&#x27;s office to reclaim Beethoven, but Varnick says Beethoven is already dead. George then remembers that the receptionist told him that Beethoven would not be put down until the next day, before noticing that Varnick has no bite marks on his arm. Realizing that Emily was telling the truth, George punches Varnick and leaves.

Afterwards, the Newtons covertly follow Varnick to his warehouse, where Beethoven is being kept. Beethoven manages to escape from his cage but is recaptured by Harvey and Vernon, who are working for the doctor. As Alice tries to call the police, George goes to the top of the building and spies through the skylight. The skylight breaks, and George falls to the ground in front of Varnick, who prepares to shoot both him and Beethoven. Sparky, a captive Jack Russell Terrier that Beethoven had earlier befriended, bites Varnick in the crotch, causing him to fire a shot into the air. Ted hears the gunshot and drives the car through the warehouse entrance, crashing into a cart and launching numerous syringes into Varnick, sedating him. As the Newtons reunite with Beethoven and free all the captive dogs, they notice Harvey and Vernon trying to escape. Ted sends the dogs after them, but they escape into a junkyard, only to be attacked by several Doberman guard dogs.

Dr. Varnick, Harvey, and Vernon are all arrested for animal cruelty. The Newtons are praised as heroes in the news, and George takes a new liking to Beethoven. The Newtons go to sleep, saying good night to Beethoven and all the other dogs they rescued.

==Cast==
==Production==
John Hughes left the &quot;Beethoven&quot; script for Universal Pictures when he parted ways with the studio. Hughes allowed Universal to make the film on the condition that he be credited under his pseudonym, Edmond Dantès. It became an open secret in the industry that Hughes was behind the pseudonym.

The dogs featured in the film were owned and trained by Eleanor Keaton, the wife of Buster Keaton.. Beethoven is played by canine actor Chris, who had 12 doubles.

Principal photography began on May 1, 1991, in Los Angeles, California, under the direction of Steve Rash, but he left the production due to creative differences and was replaced with Brian Levant.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 31%, based on reviews from 29 critics, with an average score of 4.7/10. The critical consensus reads: &quot;Fluffy and incorrigible, &quot;Beethoven&quot; is a good boy who deserves a better movie.&quot; Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave &quot;Beethoven&quot; a grade of A.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Rita Kempley praised the film as a &quot;a waggish tale of canine chicanery, an uproarious if impawsible symphony of drool, doggy fidelity and chewed shoes.&quot; Johanna Steinmetz of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Beethoven&quot; charms its way through [its] highly formulaic premise with the help of some smart animal-handling, a few excellently realized visual stunts and narrative montages of life a la dog.&quot; The &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; said: &quot;The most important work comes from a hulking, brown-eyed, sad-faced big star named Chris, who makes Beethoven into a Benji for the &#x27;90s, a sort of canine Wallace Beery or Walter Matthau. Roll on, Beethoven.&quot;

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Caryn James wrote &quot;Beethoven&quot; is &quot;much more enjoyable than it has any right to be&quot; and &quot;tugs all the right strings, in a manner strangely reminiscent of &quot;Home Alone&quot;. It is savvy about kids&#x27; troubles...[and] is sentimental but not gooey. Most important, its cartoonish bad guys offer villainy without any true danger and are vanquished by a non-adult hero&quot;. James&#x27;s colleague Janet Maslin also gave a positive review, opining that while the film is &quot;no classic...it&#x27;s a sunny, energetic children&#x27;s film with a good notion of what young audiences like.&quot;

James added Charles Grodin &quot;provides much of the adult appeal of &quot;Beethoven&quot;. He underplays his comic scenes where another actor would have been mugging furiously, but he still lets on that George is a softy underneath it all.&quot; In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Michael Wilmington said: &quot;The movie is about the way pets humanize uptight suburbanites. And the suburbanite here, Charles Grodin as George Newton, is a good part of what makes &quot;Beethoven&quot; work. Grodin&#x27;s mastery of uptight types is always apparent.&quot; He concluded that &quot;despite [&quot;Beethoven&quot;″s] crudities, overstatement and predictable plot...there&#x27;s something a little goofy and sweet about it&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing in his review that &quot;this is not the sort of entertainment I scour the movie pages for, hoping desperately for a new film about a cute dog. Nor did I find anything particularly new in &quot;Beethoven&quot;, although I concede that the filmmakers secured an admirable dog for the title role, and that Charles Grodin, who is almost always amusing, has what fun can be had playing the grumpy dad.&quot; He concluded &quot;Beethoven&quot; is &quot;the kind of clever, innocuous family entertainment that&#x27;s always in short supply.&quot;

Negative reviews criticized the film&#x27;s plot, with some expressing it recycles cliches from other dog films like &quot;Turner &amp; Hooch&quot;. Others pointed out the film&#x27;s darker elements may be too scary for young kids. Chris Hicks of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; wrote that &quot;the first half brings to mind the best elements of &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot;, with its delightful portrayal of domestic bliss gone awry. But the second half is more like a failed kiddie version of a TV crime drama. And the film never quite recovers.&quot; Hal Lipper of the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; called the film an &quot;87-minute commercial&quot; for pet food company Iams, but praised Bonnie Hunt&#x27;s performance.

The plot line of Alice leaving the work force after an alarming experience with a babysitter was criticized in multiple reviews because of its perceived bias against working mothers. In &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Betsy Sherman wrote the film had &quot;a strange tone of desperateness in its depiction of a &#x27;perfect&#x27; suburban nuclear family. An assortment of grotesque supporting characters become threats to the family, and are dispatched by Beethoven.&quot; The American Veterinary Medical Association expressed disapproval for the film&#x27;s evil veterinarian plot and sent letters of protest to Ivan Reitman, the film&#x27;s executive producer, and to the Motion Picture Association of America.

===Box office===
Beethoven opened in 3rd place at the North American box office, with a total of $7,587,565. In its 4th week of release, it moved to the number 2 spot. The film ultimately grossed $57,114,049 in North America and $90,100,000 in other territories, for a total of $147.2 million worldwide.

===Accolades===
==Music==
The soundtrack to the film was released on December 15, 1992.

==Sequels and spin-offs==

The film was followed by four sequels and three standalone films that use the Beethoven name and the premise of a St. Bernard, but the plots are less and less connected as the series goes on. &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s 2nd&quot; was released to theaters in 1993. The remaining sequels were direct-to-video films: &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s 3rd&quot; (2000), &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s 4th&quot; (2001), &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s 5th&quot; (2003), &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Big Break&quot; (2008), &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Christmas Adventure&quot; (2011), and &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Treasure Tail&quot; (2014). An animated TV series was also created around the films that debuted in 1994. Dean Jones voiced George Newton in it after playing Dr. Herman Varnick in the film and Nicholle Tom reprised her role, voicing Ryce Newton. None of the sequels or related media featured the involvement of Hughes.

<doc id="348996" wikidata="Q749276" url="?curid=348996" title="Yamashiro Province">
<text>was a province of Japan, located in Kinai. It overlaps the southern part of modern Kyoto Prefecture on Honshū. Aliases include , the rare , and . It is classified as an upper province in the &quot;Engishiki&quot;.

Yamashiro Province included Kyoto itself, as in 794 AD Yamashiro became the seat of the imperial court, and, during the Muromachi period, was the seat of the Ashikaga shogunate as well. The capital remained in Yamashiro until its de facto move to Tokyo in the 1870s.

==History==
&quot;Yamashiro&quot; was formerly written with the characters meaning &quot;mountain&quot; () and &quot;era&quot; (); in the 7th century, there were things built listing the name of the province with the characters for &quot;mountain&quot; and &quot;ridge&quot;/&quot;back&quot; (). On 4 December 794 (8 Shimotsuki, 13th year of Enryaku), at the time of the establishment of Heian-kyō, because Emperor Kanmu made his new capital utilize the surroundings as natural fortification, the character for &quot;shiro&quot; was finally changed to &quot;castle&quot; (). Later &quot;shiro&quot; from the province name replaced the older &quot;ki&quot; as the Japanese reading for the character 城.

Just from Nara period writings, it is apparent that the &quot;area&quot; () and &quot;ridge&quot; () listings coexisted.

The provincial capital, according to the &quot;Wamyō Ruijushō&quot;, was .

In the &quot;Shūgaishō&quot;, Otokuni District is mentioned as the seat, as well as in the &quot;Setsuyōshū&quot;.

As for the &quot;shugo&quot;″s mansion, at first, Yamashiro Province shugo and Kyoto shugo were concurrent posts, so the Kyoto shugo&#x27;s &quot;kogenin&quot;″s mansion had to be allotted. Afterwards, the &quot;Rokuhara Tandai&quot; came to be an additional post, and that became the shugo as well. In the Muromachi period, Yamashiro Province was divided with the Uji River as the border into two districts, and each came to be assigned a shugo, so one shugo resided in Uji Makishima, whereas the other resided in various places around Yodo and such.

A European geographical dictionary published in 1697, well into the Tokugawa period, describes &quot;Yamaxiro&quot; as a &quot;kingdom in Japan,&quot; with &quot;Meaco&quot; (Miyako, i.e. Kyoto) as its &quot;capital.&quot;

==Temples==
The provincial temples included those where the resident chief priest was a man, and those where it was a woman in Sōraku District. Kuni no Miya&#x27;s Daigokuden was made a temple in 746. It was destroyed by fire in 882, and the rebuilding afterwards would decline. In the Kamakura period, it came to be a branch temple of Byōdō-in. The location is in modern Kizugawa city, coinciding with Kamo. In 1925, a large number of old tiles were excavated near the provincial temple, and it is thought that these once belonged to the convent.

The Kamo Shrines—the Kamigamo Shrine in the Kita ward of Kyoto and the Shimogamo Shrine in Sakyō ward—were designated as the two chief Shinto shrines (&quot;ichinomiya&quot;) of Yamashiro province.

Yamashiro&#x27;s &quot;ichinomiya&quot; designation differed from other provinces&#x27;, likely due to the Jingi-kan; from nearly the end of the 11th century, when the primary shrines were being established in each of the various provinces, it is thought that in Kinai, it was decided on after the turn on the 12th century. There were no &quot;ninomiya&quot; (secondary shrines). It is unknown whether there were any sōja.

<text>In promotion and advertising, a testimonial or show consists of a person&#x27;s written or spoken statement extolling the virtue of a product. The term &quot;testimonial&quot; most commonly applies to the sales-pitches attributed to ordinary citizens, whereas the word &quot;&quot; usually applies to pitches by celebrities. Testimonials can be part of communal marketing.

==Celebrity endorsements==


Advertisers have attempted to quantify and qualify the use of celebrities in their marketing campaigns by evaluating the awareness generated, appeal, and relevance to a brand&#x27;s image and the celebrity&#x27;s influence on consumer buying behavior.

Social media such as Twitter have become increasingly popular mediums for celebrities to endorse brands and to attempt to influence purchasing behavior. According to a study by Zenith, social media ad spending was $29 billion in 2016 and is expected to rise to $50 billion in 2019. Advertising and marketing companies sponsor celebrities to tweet and influence thousands (sometimes millions) of their followers to buy brand products. For example, Ryan Seacrest (an American broadcaster) gets paid to promote Ford products. Companies that pay celebs to tweet for them subscribe to the 

Celebrity endorsements have proven very successful in China, where increasing consumerism makes the purchase of an endorsed product into a status symbol. On 1 August 2007, laws were passed banning healthcare professionals and public figures such as movie stars or pop singers from appearing in advertisements for drugs or nutritional supplements. A spokesperson stated, &quot;A celebrity appearing in drug advertising is more likely to mislead consumers, therefore, the state must consider controlling medical advertisements and strengthen the management of national celebrities appearing in medical advertisements.&quot;

==Customer==
Testimonials from customers who are not famous have been effectively used in marketing for as long as marketing has existed. A past or current customer will present a formal &quot;word of mouth&quot; testimonial that a business can use in marketing and to build trust with future customers. Testimonials are incredibly effective when believed to be true, but a challenge is having the audience believe that testimonials presented by a business are given by real people, not fabricated by the business itself. Even so, testimonials, reviews, and case studies are still considered by most marketing experts to be the most effective means of marketing and gaining brand trust by small- and medium-sized businesses.

Testimonials have reached an all-time high in importance as the internet is now a plethora of reviews (synonymous with testimonials). Websites such as Yelp!, Google Maps, TripAdvisor, and many more have become &#x27;go to&#x27; places for individuals who are seeking other customers reviews/testimonials about a particular business. To put the growth of this industry into perspective, for example, Yelp.com&#x27;s growth alone can be noted: Yelp.com has more than 71 million monthly unique visitors as of January 2012.

Instagram especially has increasingly been useful in distributing testimonials on products and places. It is done by making use of the tagging feature that directly links to the original brand or the particular location that the picture was taken. Moreover, the description of the pictures are also used to write either the review or sentences that complements the product or place. Users with a large number of followers are commonly targeted for endorsement deal requests that aims to create these testimonial posts, where in return, the user receives commission for &#x27;advertising&#x27; the place or product. However, it can only be called an endorsement deal when the company or label contacts the user directly to create such testimonial post, and the user receives commission. This is becoming a trend in Indonesia, especially amongst users with at least one thousand followers, where some are now known for posting pictures with advertising purposes.

The downside to such explosive importance in this arena is the massive amount of fraud in the form of fake reviews or opinion spam, testimonials that are not authentic. Often, a business owner will open multiple email addresses and then corresponding Yelp! accounts and write a multitude of testimonials seemingly by many customers of said business. Similarly, the same owner may also write negative reviews of competitors. From a &quot;New York Times&quot; article about the same topic, &quot;On another forum, Digital Point, a poster wrote, &#x27;I will pay for positive feedback on TripAdvisor.&#x27; A Craigslist post proposed this: &#x27;If you have an active Yelp account and would like to make very easy money please respond.&#x27; There are tens-of-thousands of ads out there all over the internet of people requesting you to write bogus reviews for their business and people offering to do the same.&quot;. However, there are legitimate and legal ways for business owners to build their portfolio of reviews such as mentioning to customers that they value honest feedback and then providing them with the appropriate instructions for where they can review the business.

There have also been allegations that review sites themselves are prepared to manipulate reviews in return for companies buying advertising subscriptions, with a class action being filed against Yelp to this effect in February 2010.

==Research==
Research by Martin, Wentzel and Tomczak (2008) found that the effectiveness of testimonials depends on the degree to which consumers are influenced by normative pressure and the quality of the product features highlighted. Results showed that people influenced by peer pressure place a greater emphasis on the testimonial than on the attribute information. In contrast, people who ignore the opinions of others are more influenced by attribute information.

==Legality==
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that in US businesses, an alarming number of testimonials were in fact fictitious and misleading. In December 2009, they introduced a new set of rules governing testimonials. In essence, it is now illegal to use testimonials that &quot;...mislead consumers and affect consumers&#x27; behavior or decisions about the product or service.&quot; However, despite new regulations, online consumers often view testimonials with a high degree of skepticism. Companies from the private sector have begun to offer testimonial verification services to help consumers verify the authenticity of displayed testimonials.

Osaka and Osaka Castle were the main center of the province. Most of Settsu&#x27;s area comprises the modern day cities of Osaka and Kōbe.

==History==
During the Sengoku period, the Miyoshi clan ruled Settsu and its neighbors, Izumi and Kawachi, until they were conquered by Oda Nobunaga. The provinces were ruled subsequently by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The regents of Hideyoshi&#x27;s son soon quarreled, and when Ishida Mitsunari lost the Battle of Sekigahara, the area was given to relatives of Tokugawa Ieyasu. It was from then on divided into several domains, including the Asada Domain.

Sumiyoshi taisha was designated as the chief Shinto shrine (&quot;ichinomiya&quot;) for the province. 
During the Sengoku period Settsu became the main exporting centre of matchlock firearms to the rest of Japan.

The of sake brewing was practiced at the in the Amagasaki Domain of Settsu Province during the Edo period.

<text>In mathematics, specifically abstract algebra, a linearly ordered or totally ordered group is a group &quot;G&quot; equipped with a total order &quot;≤&quot; that is &quot;translation-invariant&quot;. This may have different meanings. We say that (&quot;G&quot;, ≤) is a:

* left-ordered group if ≤ is left-invariant, that is &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; implies &quot;ca&quot; ≤ &quot;cb&quot; for all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; in &quot;G&quot;,
* right-ordered group if ≤ is right-invariant, that is &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; implies &quot;ac&quot; ≤ &quot;bc&quot; for all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; in &quot;G&quot;,
* bi-ordered group if ≤ is bi-invariant, that is it is both left- and right-invariant. 

A group &quot;G&quot; is said to be left-orderable (or right-orderable, or bi-orderable) if there exists a left- (or right-, or bi-) invariant order on &quot;G&quot;. A simple necessary condition for a group to be left-orderable is to have no elements of finite order; however this is not a sufficient condition. It is equivalent for a group to be left- or right-orderable; however there exist left-orderable groups which are not bi-orderable. 

== Further definitions ==

In this section formula_1 is a left-invariant order on a group formula_2 with identity element formula_3. All that is said applies to right-invariant orders with the obvious modifications. Note that formula_1 being left-invariant is equivalent to the order formula_5 defined by formula_6 if and only if formula_7 being right-invariant. In particular a group being left-orderable is the same as it being right-orderable. 

In analogy with ordinary numbers we call an element formula_8 of an ordered group positive if formula_9. The set of positive elements in an ordered group is called the positive cone, it is often denoted with formula_10; the slightly different notation formula_11 is used for the positive cone together with the identity element. 

The positive cone formula_10 characterises the order formula_1; indeed, by left-invariance we see that formula_14 if and only if formula_15. In fact a left-ordered group can be defined as a group formula_2 together with a subset formula_17 satisfying the two conditions that:
#for formula_18 we have also formula_19;
#let formula_20, then formula_2 is the disjoint union of formula_22 and formula_23. 
The order formula_24 associated with formula_17 is defined by formula_26; the first condition amounts to left-invariance and the second to the order being well-defined and total. The positive cone of formula_24 is formula_17.

The left-invariant order formula_1 is bi-invariant if and only if it is conjugacy invariant, that is if formula_14 then for any formula_31 we have formula_32 as well. This is equivalent to the positive cone being stable under inner automorphisms. 
If formula_33, then the absolute value of formula_34, denoted by formula_35, is defined to be: formula_36
If in addition the group formula_2 is abelian, then for any formula_38 a triangle inequality is satisfied: formula_39.

==Examples==

Any left- or right-orderable group is torsion-free, that is it contains no elements of finite order besides the identity. Conversely, F. W. Levi showed that a torsion-free abelian group is bi-orderable; this is still true for nilpotent groups but there exist torsion-free, finitely presented groups which are not left-orderable. 

===Archimedean ordered groups===

Otto Hölder showed that every Archimedean group (a bi-ordered group satisfying an Archimedean property) is isomorphic to a subgroup of the additive group of real numbers, .
If we write the Archimedean l.o. group multiplicatively, this may be shown by considering the Dedekind completion, formula_40 of the closure of a l.o. group under formula_41th roots. We endow this space with the usual topology of a linear order, and then it can be shown that for each formula_42 the exponential maps formula_43 are well defined order preserving/reversing, topological group isomorphisms. Completing a l.o. group can be difficult in the non-Archimedean case. In these cases, one may classify a group by its rank: which is related to the order type of the largest sequence of convex subgroups.

===Other examples===

Free groups are left-orderable. More generally this is also the case for right-angled Artin groups. Braid groups are also left-orderable.

The group given by the presentation formula_44 is torsion-free but not left-orderable; note that it is a 3-dimensional crystallographic group (it can be realised as the group generated by two glided half-turns with orthogonal axes and the same translation length), and it is the same group that was proven to be a counterexample to the unit conjecture. More generally the topic of orderability of 3--manifold groups is interesting for its relation with various topological invariants. There exists a 3-manifold group which is left-orderable but not bi-orderable (in fact it does not satisfy the weaker property of being locally indicable). 

Left-orderable groups have also attracted interest from the perspective of dynamical systems as it is known that a countable group is left-orderable if and only if it acts on the real line by homeomorphisms. Non-examples related to this paradigm are lattices in higher rank Lie groups; it is known that (for example) finite-index subgroups in formula_45 are not left-orderable; a wide generalisation of this has been recently announced.

<doc id="349015" wikidata="Q1047150" url="?curid=349015" title="Kawachi Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the eastern part of modern Osaka Prefecture. It originally held the southwestern area that was split off into Izumi Province. It was also known as .

==Geography==
The area was radically different in the past, with Kawachi Bay and lake dominating the area over what is now land. That the became the plains in the west of the province was in part due to the sediment flowing from the Yodo and Yamato Rivers.

==&quot;Chiku&quot;==
Kawachi was divided into three : , , and .
* The northern county comprised the modern Hirakata, Neyagawa, Kadoma, Moriguchi, Shijōnawate, Daitō, and Katano, Osaka areas.
* The central county comprised the modern Higashiōsaka, Yao, and Kashiwara, Osaka areas.
* The southern county comprised the modern Sakai&#x27;s eastern part (all of Higashi-ku and Mihara-ku, and part of Kita-ku), Matsubara, Habikino, Fujiidera, Tondabayashi, Kawachinagano, Ōsakasayama, and Minamikawachi District areas.

==Development==
Kawachi province was established in the 7th century. On 11 May 716, the Ōtori, Izumi, and Hine districts were split off to form . In December 720, the and districts were combined to become . On 15 September 740, Izumi Province was merged back in. On 30 May 757, that area was again separated to form Izumi Province (this time with the normal &quot;kuni&quot; designation).

Under Dōkyō&#x27;s administration, was established, taking the name of ; moreover, in 769 the office of Kawachi &quot;kokushi&quot; was abolished, and the special administration structure of was established. With the downfall of Dōkyō, the prior system was restored the following year.

==Capital==
The provincial capital was in Shiki District, which is believed to have been at in Fujiidera, but this is not known for certain. It may have been moved during the Nara period (both locations would still be within modern Fujiidera). However, in the &quot;Shūgaishō&quot;, the capital was in Ōagata District. In the &quot;Setsuyōshū&quot;, Tanboku District was mentioned as the seat.

It seems that there was no office of shugo before the Jōkyū War. It is unknown where the original shugo&#x27;s residence was, but afterwards, it transferred to the Tannan, Furuichi, Wakae, and Takaya areas.

==Temples==
A provincial temple for monks was constructed in the Tenpyō era; they were at modern Kokubuhiganjō in Kashiwara, but they went out of use in sometime around the Nanboku-chō period. Similarly, one for nuns was also near the same place, but it seems that it was in ruin by the Heian period.

Hiraoka Shrine was designated as the chief Shinto shrine (&quot;ichinomiya&quot;) of Kawachi Province. The shrine is located in Higashiōsaka. In addition, Katano Shrine in Hirakata, is labelled the , but this may be a mixup where what was once the primary shrine for the Katano township was confused for the primary shrine of Kawachi.

The secondary shrine is said to have been . However, just having the second most influence in Kawachi Province does not necessarily mean it was a secondary shrine in the shrine system. That it is called the secondary shrine is also a recent innovation.

There were no lower-level shrines.

The sōja (Shinto) was Shiki-Agatanushi Shrine; there is a theory that this shrine was moved to where the sōja&#x27;s land was, and another theory that it came to be the sōja due to its proximity to the capital.

==History==

=== Ancient – Kamakura period ===
The province of Kawachi was once the power of the Mononobe clan; Kizuri in Higashiōsaka was, in ancient times, one of their strongholds.

Tsuboi in Habikino became a stronghold of the warrior family that was the Minamoto clan (i.e., the Kawachi Genji). The likes of Hachimantarō Yoshiie who made vassals out of the samurai of the eastern provinces, his father Minamoto no Yoriyoshi, and Yoshiyori&#x27;s father Minamoto no Yorinobu&#x27;s tomb of three generations is even now close to the Tsūhō-ji remains that was the Kawachi Genji&#x27;s family temple. Minamoto no Yoritomo (who founded the Kamakura shogunate) was a descendant of these Kawachi Genji.

Near the end of the Kamakura period, Kusunoki Masashige and his household, being a powerful clan of southern Kawachi, rose up in defiance of the shogunate; barricaded in the Shimo Akasaka, Kami Akasaka, and Chihaya castles, he baffled the Kamakura shogunal armies. With the direct imperial rule of Kenmu, Kusunoki was appointed as both &quot;kokushi&quot; and &quot;shugo&quot;.

===Muromachi period===
The Nanboku-chō period arrived as Ashikaga Takauji opposed Emperor Go-Daigo, and Kawachi became a hotspot for battles; Kusunoki Masashige&#x27;s eldest son Kusunoki Masatsura was killed in action at the battle of Shijō Nawate.

&quot;After the death of Chikafusa the Southern Court moved from Anau to Amano in the province of Kawachi, making the Kongoji its headquarters.&quot;

With the advent of the Muromachi period, the post of Kawachi &quot;shugo&quot; fell to one of the three &quot;kanrei&quot;, of the Hatakeyama clan; Hatakeyama Mitsuie and Hatakeyama Mochikuni continued this, making what should have been a dynasty of sorts, but in dispute over Mochikuni&#x27;s family headship, the adopted Hatakeyama Masanaga and the begotten Hatakeyama Yoshinari quarreled, and as Kawachi became the background for that feud, it fell to waste.

Masanaga was attacked at by Hosokawa Masamoto and Hatakeyama Yoshitoyo, but his son Hisayoshi was in Kishū attempting to recoup for another attack; finally, they succeeded in making a comeback as the shugo of Kawachi and Kishū, and Hisayoshi&#x27;s son Tanenaga ultimately managed to destroy Yoshihide of Yoshinari&#x27;s line, once again consolidating the house of Hatakeyama. However, through all this, Kawachi had been the battleground, and had essentially been reduced to scorched earth.

===Sengoku period===

By the Sengoku period, the consolidated Kawachi was the asset of Hatakeyama Tanenaga, but the real power was imbued in the shugodai, a title that passed into the hands of Yusa Naganori: the shugo came to be reduced to a mere figurehead. Moreover, the &quot;kanrei&quot; house of Hosokawa continued to face internal strife; in addition to the Hosokawa inheritance dispute between Takakuni, Sumimoto, and Sumiyuki, the son of Sumimoto (the victor of that conflict) Harumoto attacked and overthrew the shugodai in Sakai who played an active role in the Hosokawa clan&#x27;s internal strife, Miyoshi Motonaga.

The bakufu, which was an asset for Harumoto, had been preserved, but Miyoshi&#x27;s son Nagayoshi proceeded to the capital from Awa; while he accepting a wife from the shugodai of Kawachi who had the &quot;de facto&quot; power (Yusa Naganori) and received other such favors of power, in subordination to Harumoto, but not in subordination to the wishes of Harumoto, he played an active role in such things as attacking Kizawa Nagamasa in Takaida (in modern Kashiwara, Osaka).

However, being in opposition later on, Nagayoshi would fight his father&#x27;s cousin in Harumoto&#x27;s faction, Miyoshi Masanaga, in dispute over Kawachi Jū Nana Kasho at places like Enami Castle, going on to break down Harumoto&#x27;s controlled political power; the &quot;shōgun&quot; was reduced to a figurehead and along with seizing the real power of the bakufu, he transferred the stronghold from Akutagawa Mountain Castle in Settsu to Iimori Mountain Castle in Kawachi (Shijōnawate, Osaka).

But even Nagayoshi had to pass away at the age of 42, and afterwards retainers were in conflict (the Miyoshi triumvirate and Matsunaga Hisahide), making a battleground of Kawachi and Yamato. The event that finally closed the period and these conflicts was Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s procession to the capital.

===Azuchi-Momoyama period===
Upon his ascension to the capital, Oda Nobunaga gave the task of governing the northern half of Kawachi to Miyoshi Yoshitsugu, and that of the southern half to Hatakeyama Akitaka (his son-in-law). However, they both fell in the conflicts around the Genki era, and control of Kawachi fell to Oda&#x27;s chief vassal Sakuma Nobumori. But even Nobumori would later be shunned and banished by Nobunaga.

When Oda died in the Incident at Honnō-ji, Hashiba Hideyoshi, who attacked Akechi Mitsuhide at the battle of Yamazaki, as a result of the Kiyosu Conference, came to control the province.

Hideyoshi came to rule all Japan, and when Osaka Castle was built, Wakae Castle, which had once been an important spot in Kawachi, became derelict.

After the death of Hideyoshi, the Battle of Sekigahara ensued, and Tokugawa Ieyasu became ruler of all Japan: the &quot;Sei-i Taishōgun&quot;; he opened his &quot;bakufu&quot;, but as Kawachi was Toyotomi Hideyori&#x27;s fiefdom, it was not entered into the &quot;bakuhan taisei&quot;.

When Tokugawa Ieyasu and Toyotomi Hideyori had their showdown at the Siege of Osaka, Kawachi also became a battleground. This fight had a winter and a summer campaign, but since the winter campaign was a battle around Osaka Castle, Kawachi was not a war location then. The aspect of the summer campaign was completely turned about, and the outer moat of Osaka Castle was buried, leaving the castle exposed; the Osaka side judged a siege defense to be impossible, and intercepted Tokugawa&#x27;s side going from Kyoto to Osaka in the field. Therefore, fights occurred at various places in Kawachi, it being between Kyoto and Osaka. The primary battles that developed were the Battle of Dōmyōji (Gotō Matabee vs. Date Masamune, Matsudaira Tadateru, and Mizuno Katsunari; Sanada Yukimura, Kitagawa Nobukatsu, and Susukida Kanesuke vs. Date Masamune, Matsudaira Tadateru, and Mizuno Katsunari) and the battle of Yao and Wakae (Kimura Shigenari vs. Ii Naotaka; Chōsokabe Morichika vs. Tōdō Takatora).

===Edo period===
In the Edo period, Kawachi was dotted with &quot;tenryō&quot; as well as &quot;hatamotos&quot;. As for &quot;daimyōs&quot;, there were only two: the Hōjō of Sayama Domain and the Takagi of Tannan Domain. In addition, the Inaba of Yodo Domain had many territories.

<text>British popular music and popular music in general, can be defined in a number of ways, but is used here to describe music which is not part of the art/classical music or Church music traditions, including folk music, jazz, pop and rock music. These forms of music have particularly flourished in Britain, which, it has been argued, has influenced popular music disproportionately to its size, partly due to its linguistic and cultural links with many countries, particularly the former areas of British control such as United States, Canada, and Australia, but also a capacity for invention, innovation and fusion, which has led to the development of, or participation in, many of the major trends in popular music. This is particularly true since the early 1960s when the British Invasion led by The Beatles, helped to secure British performers a major place in development of pop and rock music, which has been revisited at various times, with genres originating in or being radically developed by British musicians, including: blues rock, heavy metal music, progressive rock, punk rock, British folk rock, folk punk, acid jazz, drum and bass, grime, afroswing, dubstep and Britpop.

==Early British popular music==
Commercial music enjoyed by the people can be seen to originate in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries with the arrival of the broadside ballad, which were sold cheaply and in great numbers until the nineteenth century. Further technological, economic and social changes led to new forms of music in the nineteenth century, including the brass band, which produced a popular and communal form of classical music. Similarly, the music hall sprang up to cater for the entertainment of new urban societies, adapting existing forms of music to produce popular songs and acts. In the 1930s the influence of US jazz led to the creation of British dance bands, who provided a social and popular music that began to dominate social occasions and the radio airwaves.

==1950s==

By 1950, indigenous forms of British popular music were already giving way to the influence of American forms of music including jazz, swing and traditional pop, mediated through film and records. The significant change of the mid-1950s was the impact of US rock and roll, which provided a new model for performance and recording, based on a youth market. Initially this was dominated by US acts, or re-creations of American forms of music, but soon distinctly British forms began to appear, first in the uniquely British take on US folk music in the Skiffle craze of the 1950s, in the beginnings of a folk revival that came to place an emphasis on national traditions and then in early attempts to produce British rock and roll. However it&#x27;s important to note that American folk music itself has its root in British and Irish folk music, and so was seen as more of a shared cultural tradition than a new form of music. Indeed, many of the later American genres such as Blues and Rock &amp; Roll share origins with earlier Folk and popular music that merged with predominantly African American forms of music to create what would become the aforementioned genres. A key feature in much American music being the Scotch Snap for example. This evidences a common theme of cyclical exportation and re-exportation of British and American music between the respective cultures.

==1960s==
By the early 1960s the British had developed a viable national music industry and began to produce adapted forms of American music in beat music and British blues which would be re-exported to America by bands such as The Beatles and Rolling Stones. This helped to make the dominant forms of popular music something of a shared Anglo-American project. The development of British blues rock helped revitalised rock music and led to the growing distinction between pop and rock music. In the mid-1960s, British bands were at the forefront in the creation of the hard rock genre. While pop music continued to dominate the singles charts, teen culture continued to dominate. Rock began to develop into diverse and creative subgenres that characterised the form throughout the rest of the twentieth century.

==1970s==

In the 1970s British musicians played a major part in developing the new forms of music that had emerged from blues rock towards the end of the 1960s, including folk rock and psychedelic rock. Several important and influential subgenres were created in Britain in this period, by pursuing the possibilities of rock music, including British folk rock and glam rock, a process that reached its apogee in the development of progressive rock and one of the most enduring subgenres in heavy metal music. While jazz began to suffer a decline in popularity in this period, Britain began to be increasingly influenced by aspects of World music, including Jamaican music, resulting in new music scenes and subgenres. In the middle years of the decade the influence of the pub rock led to the British intensification of punk, which swept away much of the existing landscape of popular music, replacing it with much more diverse new wave and post punk bands who mixed different forms of music and influences to dominate rock and pop music into the 1980s.

==1980s==
Rock and pop music in the 1980s built on the post-punk and new wave movements, incorporating different sources of inspiration from subgenres and what is now classed as World music in the shape of Jamaican and Indian music, as did British Jazz, as a series of black British musicians came to prominence, creating new fusions like Acid Jazz. It also explored the consequences of new technology and social change in the electronic music of synthpop.
In the early years of the decade, while subgenres like heavy metal music continued to develop separately, especially influenced by NWOBHM leaders, Iron Maiden among others. There was a considerable crossover between rock and more commercial popular music, with a large number of more &quot;serious&quot; bands, like The Police and UB40, enjoying considerable single chart success. The advent of MTV and cable video helped spur what has been seen as a Second British Invasion in the early years of the decade, with British bands enjoying more success in America than they had since the height of The Beatles&#x27; popularity in the 1960s. However, by the end of the decade there was a fragmentation, with many new forms of music and sub-cultures, including Hip Hop and House music, while the single charts were once again dominated by pop artists, now often associated with the Hi-NRG hit factory of Stock Aitken Waterman. The rise of the Indie rock scene was partly a response to this, and marked a shift away from the major music labels and towards the importance of local scenes like Madchester and subgenres, like gothic rock.

==1990s==
In the 1990s, while the singles charts were dominated by boy bands and girl groups like Take That, and Spice Girls, British soul and Indian-based music also enjoyed their greatest level of mainstream success to date, and the rise of World music helped revitalise the popularity of folk music. Electronic rock bands like The Prodigy and Chemical Brothers began to achieve a high profile. Alternative rock reached the mainstream, emerging from the Madchester scene to produce dream pop, shoegazing, post rock and indie pop, which led to the commercial success of Britpop bands like Blur and Oasis; followed by a stream of post-Britpop bands like Travis and Feeder, which led the way for the international success of bands including Snow Patrol and Coldplay.

==2000s==
At the beginning of the new millennium, while talent show contestants were one of the major forces in pop music, British soul maintained and even extended its high-profile with figures like Joss Stone, Amy Winehouse and Adele, while a new group of singer/songwriters, including KT Tunstall and James Blunt, achieved international success and to rock bands such as Arctic Monkeys, Coldplay and Bring Me the Horizon. New forms of dance music emerged, fusing hip hop with garage to form grime. There was also a revival of garage rock and post punk, which when mixed with electronic music produced new rave.

==2010s==
The success of UK artists in the US during the early 2010s led to some claiming a new British Invasion was taking place, as British musicians took their largest ever share of the US album charts year-on-year between 2011 (11.7% of US market), 2012 (13.7% of US market), 2013 and 2014. Notable British musicians achieving global success at the beginning of the 2010s include Dua Lipa, One Direction, Little Mix, Cher Lloyd, Rita Ora, Adele and Mumford &amp; Sons.

Adele&#x27;s album &quot;21&quot; sold over 6 million copies and became the UK&#x27;s best-selling album of the 21st century and its fourth best-selling album of all time, certified platinum 16 times. During the same year, &quot;Back To Black&quot; by Amy Winehouse became the UK&#x27;s second best selling album of the 21st century and its 13th best-selling album of all time following her death in 2011, certified platinum 11 times.

In 2013, despite the trend of declining album sales persisting, the British music industry saw a 9% growth in revenue which could be traced to &quot;individual revenues by musicians, singers, composers, songwriters and lyricists&quot;, adding £3.8bn to the UK economy. In 2014, the UK&#x27;s top 10 albums were all by British artists, including releases by Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith, George Ezra, Paolo Nutini, Coldplay and One Direction.

Sam Smith&#x27;s debut album &quot;In the Lonely Hour&quot;, released in 2014, peaked at number one in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Sweden, and number two in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Norway and the United States. In the same year, Ed Sheeran&#x27;s second album &quot;x&quot; charted at number one in twelve countries, topping both the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200, and reaching the top 5 in eleven other countries. Also in 2014, One Direction&#x27;s album &quot;Four&quot; reached number 1 in the UK, became the top charted album on iTunes in 67 countries and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart in the US. As a consequence, One Direction became the first band to reach number one on the US Billboard chart with each of their first four albums, British or otherwise. Adele&#x27;s 25 released in 2015 has gone on to sell over 3.5 million copies and broke records immediately after its release in the UK. Adele&#x27;s success was noted for reviving the music industry and saving the dwindling sales worldwide.

<text>Banská Bystrica (, also known by other alternative names) is a city in central Slovakia, located on the Hron River in a long and wide valley encircled by the mountain chains of the Low Tatras, the Veľká Fatra, and the Kremnica Mountains. With approximately 76,000 inhabitants, Banská Bystrica is the sixth most populous municipality in Slovakia. The present-day town was founded by German settlers, invited by the Hungarian Árpád-kings, during the Middle Ages (as part of the &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot;), however it was built upon a former Slavic/Slovakian/Avar settlement. A part of Zolyom county after the Hungarian conquest. During the reign of Béla IV of Hungary it obtained the municipal privileges of a free royal town of the Kingdom of Hungary in 1255 and resettled with Germans from Thüringen. The copper mining town acquired its present picturesque look in the late Middle Ages when the prosperous burghers built its central churches, mansions, and fortifications. It is the capital of the &quot;kraj&quot; (more specifically Banská Bystrica Region) and the &quot;okres&quot; (Banská Bystrica District). It is also the home of Matej Bel University. As a historical town with an easy access to the surrounding mountains, Banská Bystrica is a popular winter and summer tourist destination.

== Etymology ==

The Slovak name Banská Bystrica includes two roots: the adjective &quot;Banská&quot; from Slovak &quot;baňa&quot; – &quot;mine&quot;, and the name of the local river &quot;Bystrica&quot; (from Slavic &quot;bystrica&quot; – &quot;swift stream&quot;). The name of the town in also comes from the &quot;Beszterce&quot; stream (from the Slavic name of the stream, &quot;Bystrica&quot;), and the suffix &quot;bánya&quot; is connected to the mines of the town. The river lent its name to the town as early as 1255 when the Latin name &quot;Villa Nova Bystrice&quot; (meaning &quot;New Town of &quot;Bystrica&quot;&quot;) was recorded in the document in which King Béla IV of Hungary granted the town royal privileges.

Several variations of &quot;Bystrica&quot; (Byztherze, Bystrice, Bystrzice etc.) were then regularly used without the adjective identifying it as a mining town until the late 16th century. Although the first written record of the name &quot;Byzterchebana&quot; dates from 1263, it was rarely used afterwards. The Old German name &quot;Neusohl&quot; (&quot;New Zvolen&quot;) (first recorded in 1300) and later its Latin version (&quot;Neosolium&quot;) reflected the fact that some early settlers came from the nearby town of Zvolen (at the time known in German as &quot;Altsohl&quot;, literally &quot;Old Zvolen&quot;). The two names have been used in parallel and even complementary (as in &quot;Novizolii Bistriciensis&quot;) throughout the history of the town. In the late 16th century the use of the mining adjective became more frequent (as in &quot;Bystrzicze na baniech&quot; or &quot;Bystricze Banska&quot;, both from 1530). This evolution resulted in the current form of the name, first recorded in 1773 as &quot;Banska Bystrica&quot;. In the Austrian Empire, the German name &quot;Neusohl&quot; was used until the compromise of 1867, when the Hungarian name &quot;Besztercebánya&quot; became the official one. The parallel use of Slovak or German names in the written record did not, however, cease in this period. &quot;Banská Bystrica&quot; became the official name of the town in 1920.

== History ==


The earliest history of Banská Bystrica was connected to the exploitation of its abundant deposits of copper (and to a lesser extent of silver, gold, and iron). The tools used by prehistoric miners at the locality called Špania Dolina have been dated to 2000–1700 BC. People of the Lusatian culture built their settlements at Špania Dolina, Horné Pršany, Malachov, and Sásová. Ancient hill fort locations are still reflected in the local toponym &quot;Hrádok&quot;, meaning &quot;a small fort (later: castle)&quot;. The territory was inhabited by the Celtic tribe of the Cotini (Púchov culture) in the 3rd century BC. The Germanic tribe of the Quadi took over the place during the Roman Era, leaving for instance a hoard of silver artifacts in &quot;Netopierska jaskyňa&quot; (Bat Cave).

The present city was built upon a former Slavic settlement. After the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin it was incorporated in the Zólyom county of the Kingdom of Hungary. The first known stone church was built by Saxon immigrants in the then still independent settlement of Sásová in the first half of the 13th century, when the area belong to the king. According to Slovak archaeologists Banská Bystrica started as a permanent settlement in the 9th century. Other sources claim that due to the attack of Mongols, in 1243–44, the town ceased to exist. In 1255 King Béla IV granted Banská Bystrica extensive municipal privileges, in order to attract more skilled settlers. Descendants of the German immigrants to this and other counties became later known as the Carpathian Germans. The city flourished as a regional mining center. It built the Late Romanesque Church of the Virgin Mary in the second half of the 13th century. During the same period, Banská Bystrica obtained its own coat of arms inspired by the coat of arms of the ruling dynasty of the Árpáds, also used as the historical flag of the Kingdom of Hungary. The local craftsmen were organized in fifty guilds, with the butchers&#x27; guild being the oldest.

The affluent Fugger and Thurzo families founded the prosperous &quot;Ungarischer Handel&quot; company (German for &quot;Hungarian Trade&quot;) in 1494. Depending mainly on the mines around Banská Bystrica, the company had become a leading world producer of copper by the 16th century. With the most sophisticated mining technologies in Europe, an advanced accounting system, and benefits including medical care for its 1,000 employees, &quot;Ungarischer Handel&quot; was one of the largest and most modern early-capitalist firms. An early record of the miners&#x27; industrial action is from 1526 when the City Council needed to take refuge within the confines of City Castle. The Ottoman Empire&#x27;s thrust northwards led the magistrate to improve the city&#x27;s fortifications with modern stone walls in 1589, but the Turks never occupied the region. Banská Bystrica became one of the foremost centers of the Protestant Reformation in the Kingdom of Hungary in the 16th century. Later on, the city had to fight for its religious freedom guaranteed by the Royal Charter against the ruling dynasty of the Austrian Roman Catholic Habsburgs, for its physical independence against the Ottoman Turks and for its self-governance against the Kingdom of Hungary&#x27;s powerful magnates. In 1620, Prince Gabriel Bethlen of Transylvania, a Protestant, was elected King of Hungary by the Diet meeting at Banská Bystrica.

The village of Radvaň, now a borough of Banská Bystrica, was granted the economically important right to hold annual fairs (&quot;Radvanský jarmok&quot;) in 1655. The fair was transferred to Banská Bystrica&#x27;s main square in the 20th century. The copper deposits had been all but depleted by the 18th century, but new industries, such as timber, paper, and textiles, developed. In 1766 the city became the capital of Zólyom county when Banská Bystrica also became the seat of a Roman Catholic bishopric (1776) and of several institutions of higher education. Public services expanded in the 19th century with the foundation of a permanent municipal hospital (1820), a municipal theater (1841), and a municipal museum (1889). The railway reached the town from Zvolen in 1873.

After Austria-Hungary lost the First World War, Banská Bystrica along with the entire northern part of Hungary was given to Czechoslovakia by the peace treaty of Trianon in 1920.

During World War II, Banská Bystrica became the center of anti-Nazi opposition in Slovakia when the Slovak National Uprising, one of the largest anti-Nazi resistance events in Europe, was launched from the city on 29 August 1944. The insurgents were defeated on 27 October, and Banská Bystrica was briefly occupied by the German forces before it was liberated by Soviet and Romanian troops on 26 March 1945. After the war, Banská Bystrica became the administrative, economic, and cultural hub of central Slovakia. It has been a university town since the 1950s. Its largest Matej Bel University was founded in 1992.

== Geography ==
Banská Bystrica lies at an altitude of above sea level and covers an area of . It is about halfway between Slovakia&#x27;s two largest cities, north-east from Slovakia&#x27;s capital Bratislava and west of Košice. A chain of discrete suburbs and villages connects it with Zvolen, another major town to the south.

Banská Bystrica is situated in the Hron River valley (). The Hron River curves through the city from the east to the south. The city nests among three mountain chains: the Low Tatras to the north-east, the Veľká Fatra to the north-west, and the Kremnica Mountains to the west. All three are protected areas because of their environmental value. Banská Bystrica hosts the headquarters of the Low Tatra National Park. Despite the proximity of these mountain ranges, the local landscape is dominated by the much lower Urpín Mountain, , which is a popular place of recreation.

Banská Bystrica lies in the north temperate zone and has a continental climate with four distinct seasons. It is characterized by a significant variation between hot summers and cold, snowy winters.

== Demographics ==


In 2013, the city had a total population of 79,368, making it the 6th-largest municipality in Slovakia in 2005. The population density was 790 per square kilometer in 2005.

The population was spread out, with 13.2% under the age of 15, 68.2% in the so-called productive age (15–54 years for women and 15–59 years for men), and 18.6% in the so-called post-productive age (over 54 years for women and over 59 years for men). For every 100 women there were 89.5 men. The population was slightly decreasing (by 423) in 2005, with the number of deaths (727) higher than the number of live births (673) and a negative migration rate. The life expectancy at birth was 75.1 years (as of 2001), which is a figure close to the median life expectancy in the European Union.

According to the 2001 census, the religious composition was 46.6% Roman Catholics, 30.2% people with no religious affiliation, and 13.9% Lutherans. People&#x27;s ethnic self-identification was 94.7% Slovak and 1.4% Czech. Before World War II, the population of the city also included significant German, Hungarian, and Jewish minorities and many people were trilingual, mastering the Slovak, German, and Hungarian languages. The Jews resided for a long time in Radvaň because they used to be prohibited from entering the city. The synagogue in Banská Bystrica was built in 1867 and demolished in 1983.

== Economy ==
While Banská Bystrica&#x27;s prosperity used to be derived from copper mining in the distant past, the most important sectors of the local economy are now tourism, timber, and mechanical industry. Two of the largest employers in Slovakia, Slovenská pošta (the public postal service, ranked as the 3rd largest employer) and Lesy SR (the national forest service, ranked as 13th). have their headquarters in Banská Bystrica. In the period 2007–2013, the city intends to work with Zvolen and other municipalities in the vicinity in order to jointly develop one of Slovakia&#x27;s major metropolitan areas. The municipal strategy of economic development envisages Banská Bystrica as a regional center of tourism, services, administration, and entrepreneurship. The proclaimed three pillars of the future development are the natural and cultural heritage, information technologies, and infrastructure.

GDP per capita in 2001 was €3,643, which was below Slovakia&#x27;s average (€4,400). GDP per capita for the Banská Bystrica Region (&quot;Banskobystrický kraj&quot;) in 2004 was PPS €10,148.70 (current euros), which was below Slovakia&#x27;s average of PPS €12,196.20. More recent data disaggregated to the level of districts or municipalities are not available, but all of Slovakia&#x27;s regional seats have per-capita GDPs above their region averages.
The unemployment rate in Banská Bystrica was 6.2% in December 2006, below the country&#x27;s average of 9.4% at that time. The unemployment rate in the whole country has been decreasing since then, reaching 7.8% in November 2007.

The city has a balanced budget of more than one billion Slovak korunas (almost €33 million, ), with a small deficit of 37 million korunas. More than one fifth of the budget was used for investment. The highest revenue comes from the income tax of persons (437 million korunas in 2006).

== Places of interest ==

Most of the historical monuments are concentrated near its central, picturesque SNP Square (), which teems with flowers and street cafes in the summer. The square is named after the Slovak National Uprising. It is dominated by a clock tower built in 1552. Although less known than its famous counterpart in Pisa, it is a leaning tower with the top off the perpendicular. A plague column (Slovak: &quot;Morový stĺp&quot;) was erected in the square in the 18th century in gratitude to the Virgin Mary for ending a deadly plague. The column was temporarily removed before a visit of the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1964 because a religious symbol was considered too embarrassing a background for the Communist leader&#x27;s speech. The St. Francis Xavier Cathedral (Slovak: &quot;Kapitulský kostol&quot;, &quot;Chapter Church&quot;) is a copy of the Jesuit Church of the Gesu in Rome and is since 1776 the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Banská Bystrica. Other major monuments on the square include an Art Nouveau fountain from the beginning of the 20th century and a black obelisk raised to the honor of the Soviet soldiers killed during the liberation of the city in 1945.

Most buildings enclosing the square and in the nearby streets are well-preserved Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque noblemen&#x27;s mansions and wealthy burghers&#x27; residences. The most interesting among them are the Benicky House and the Thurzo House, the latter hosting a museum with a regional archaeological collection and remarkable Gothic frescos. Most of the buildings in the center have been transformed into luxury stores, restaurants, and cafes. SNP Square itself was completely reconstructed in 1994.

The museum located at the Memorial of the Slovak National Uprising contains a large military collection, including an open-air exhibition of World War II tanks, artillery, aircraft, and armored trains.

Banská Bystrica has also a large network of marked hiking trails all around the city. In wintertime, it attracts fans of cross-country skiing and downhill skiing, as there are a number of ski resorts close to the city, including the Donovaly resort famous for dogsled racing.

=== Town castle ===

The oldest part of Banská Bystrica is town castle at the edge of SNP Square. It is enclosed within what has remained of its original fortifications − a barbican protecting the main gate, three bastions, and part of the walls. The town castle served as the town&#x27;s administrative center and it also protected the king&#x27;s treasury. The Parish Church (Slovak: &quot;Farský kostol&quot;) of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary built in the Romanesque and Gothic styles contains precious Gothic altars and sculptures. One of the altars was carved by the famous Master Paul of Levoča. The church was built in the 13th century. It is still surrounded by remnants of its ancient cemetery. The neighboring Church of the Holy Cross was built in 1452 by the Slovak burghers as a counterpart to the Church of the Virgin Mary that then acquired the attribute &quot;German&quot;. The Matthias House (Slovak: Matejov dom) was built in 1479 as a five-story late-Gothic structure with a Gothic portal and stone console balcony. It served as a temporary residence of King Matthias Corvinus and his Queen Consort Beatrix. The Renaissance Old Town Hall, dated from 1500, has been transformed into an art museum.

== Culture ==
There are four theaters in Banská Bystrica. The State Opera () was founded in 1959. It has given the opera world several divas, Edita Gruberová being the most famous one. Every summer, the State Opera organizes a popular open-air festival at Zvolen Castle. &quot;Štúdio tanca&quot; is a professional contemporary dance theater established in 1998. A professional marionette theater, &quot;Bábkové divadlo na Rázcestí&quot; (Puppet Theater at the Fork in the Road) founded in 1960, organizes the only marionette festival in Slovakia. Theatre from the Passage (Slovak: &quot;Divadlo z Pasáže&quot;) is Slovakia&#x27;s only theater with a mentally disabled cast whose mission is to help integrate mentally disabled people in society.

The oldest museum in the city is the Museum of Central Slovakia (Slovak: &quot;Stredoslovenské múzeum&quot;), founded in 1889. Its historical exposition is located in the Thurzo House on SNP Square, while the natural history exposition is in the Tihányi Mansion in Radvaň. The Old Town Hall building at City Castle hosts the State Gallery (Slovak: &quot;Štátna Galéria&quot;) specialized in contemporary Slovak art. The Museum of the Slovak National Uprising (Slovak: &quot;Múzeum Slovenského národného povstania&quot;) features a collection of 203,000 militaria, including an open-air exhibition of World War II heavy weapons. Other noteworthy museums are the regional Literature and Music Museum (Slovak: &quot;Literárne a hudobné múzeum&quot;) and Slovakia&#x27;s only Postal Museum (Slovak: &quot;Poštové múzeum Slovenskej pošty&quot;).

The town is the setting for the book St Peter&#x27;s Umbrella by Kálmán Mikszáth, published in 1895. The book was part of a large increase in Hungarian writing at the time, which was symptomatic of the rise in Hungarian separatism against what was seen as the oppression of the German Habsburgs.

From 22 to 28 February 1959 the first festival of the Czechoslovak cinema was presented in Banská Bystrica. While it was planned by &quot;Český film&quot; as a showcase of the national film production it turned into a tribunal for those films that did not fit the ideological guidelines of the Communist Party. Several films were banned, among them: &quot;Tri prání&quot; directed by Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos, &quot;Zde jsou lvi&quot; by Václav Krška, &quot;Hvezda jede na jih&quot; by Oldrich Lipský and &quot;Konec jasnovidce&quot; by Vladimír Svitáček and Ján Roháč.

There are four folklore ensembles for adults and three for children. Their aim is to preserve and present Slovak folklore traditions, especially the traditional music. The oldest one is the award-winning Urpín Folklore Ensemble, founded in 1957. Mladosť Folklore Ensemble is affiliated with University of Matej Bel.

<text>Nitra (; also known by other alternative names) is a city in western Slovakia, situated at the foot of Zobor Mountain in the valley of the river Nitra. It is located 95 km east of Bratislava. With a population of about 78,353, it is the fifth largest city in Slovakia. Nitra is also one of the oldest cities in Slovakia; it was the political center of the Principality of Nitra. Today, it is a seat of a &quot;kraj&quot; (Nitra Region), and an &quot;okres&quot; (Nitra District).

==Etymology==
The first mention of Nitra dates back to the 9th century. The name of the city is derived from the Nitra River. The name is Indo-European, but the question of its pre-Slavic or Slavic origin has not been satisfactorily answered. Nitra might be derived from the old Indo-European root &quot;neit-&quot;, &quot;nit-&quot; &#x27;to cut&#x27; or &#x27;to burn&#x27; using the derivational element &quot;-r-&quot; (see also slash-and-burn agricultural technique). The same root is still present in the Slovak verb &quot;nietiť&quot; &#x27;to make a fire&#x27;, but also in other Indo-European languages like Latin &quot;nitere&quot; &#x27;to burn&#x27; or in German &quot;schneiden&quot; &#x27;to cut&#x27;. Another view to the origin of the name is related to Latin &quot;Novi-iter&quot; or &quot;Neui-iter&quot; &#x27;new territory behind the limes&#x27;. The hypothetical Latin name could have been adopted by the Quadi and later by the Slavs.

The first written records also contain the suffix &quot;-ava&quot; (&quot;Nitrava&quot;). Particularly in older literature, the suffix is interpreted as deriving from the Proto-Germanic root &quot;*ahwa&quot; &#x27;water&#x27;. However, the suffix &quot;-ava&quot; can be found also in numerous toponyms with a clearly Slavic origin and without any relationship to rivers. The existence of hydronym &quot;Nitrava&quot; remains hypothetical and all versions with the suffix are related to a location, not a river. Thus, the form &quot;Nitrava&quot; can refer to a larger property or territory around the Nitra River. Both forms were probably used concurrently and were already recorded in the 9th century (Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum: &quot;in loco vocata Nitraua&quot;, but in 880 &quot;ecclesie Nitrensis&quot;).

The name in different languages includes , (), and and .

==History==
===Before the 5th century===
The oldest archaeological findings in Nitra are dated to around 25,000-30,000 years ago. The locality has been inhabited in all historical periods in the last 5,000-7,000 years. Several European archaeological cultures and groups were named after important archaeological discoveries in Nitra or near surroundings - Nitra culture, Brodzany-Nitra group or Lužianky group of Lengyel culture.

The people of Madarovce culture had built the first fortification on Castle Hill by around 1,600 BCE. In the Iron Age, a large hillfort was built on Zobor Hill and additional smaller hillforts on the Lupka Hill and in Dražovce (700-500 BCE). Several Celtic settlements are known from the 5th-1st centuries. The Celts minted silver tetradrachms known as coins of Nitra type and probably also built a hillfort in the locality Na Vŕšku. In the Roman period (1st-4th centuries CE), the Germanic tribe of Quadi settled in the area, which is also mentioned as their possible capital (396 CE). The largest Germanic settlement from the migration period in the territory of modern-day Slovakia was unearthed in Nitra-Párovské Háje.

===5th to 10th centuries===
The first Slavs arrived in the territory of present Slovakia at the end of the 5th and early 6th centuries. The early Slavs settled mainly in the lowlands near the water flows, the highest density of their settlements is documented just in the area of Nitra. As the Avars expanded into the territory of modern-day Slovakia in the latter half of the 7th century and early 8th century, the border between Slavic and Slavo-Avaric territory shifted toward Nitra. A biritual cemetery in Nitra-Dolné Krškany lay on the northern border of mixed settlement area.

The importance of Nitra for the Slavs began to grow in the 8th century and thereafter it evolved to administrative centre of the wider region. Nitra became the center of the Principality of Nitra. Three of the eleven extant copies of the Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum contains a reference to a church consecrated for Pribina in his domain called Nitrava. The problem of Pribina&#x27;s church and the dating of this event was addressed by numerous scholars, most of them have no doubt about reliability of information and associates this event with Nitra. In 833, Pribina was ousted by the Moravian prince Mojmír I and both regions were united into the early medieval empire of Great Moravia.

In the 9th century, Nitra was one of the largest agglomeration in Central Europe. The agglomeration consisted of fortified centres and more than twenty non-fortified villages. It spread out on a territory exceeding the present town. The Slavs, Slovak ancestors, built a large castle (8.5 hectares) on Castle Hill, further important locations Na vŕšku and Martinský Vrch were probably also fortified. Other hills, some of them fortified already in prehistoric times, had guarding and refuge function. Surrounding villages were used as an agricultural hinterland for princely retinue and for specialised production (jewellery production, forges, pottery kilns, etc.). More than forty burial sites are documented on 20 km2. In all burial sites, exclusively inhumation rite (compliant with Christian belief) was practised, instead of cremation typical for earlier Slavs. The known necropolises with military equipment around the perimeter of the agglomeration probably belonged to the settlements guarding access roads to the centre.

The city reached its height during the reign of Svätopluk I. During his rule, the first known Christian bishopric in Slovakia was established in Nitra in 880 (with Wiching as the bishop). The question of origin of Monastery of St. Hippolytus (the oldest Benedictine Monastery in Kingdom of Hungary) has not been sufficiently answered yet. Even if findings of ceramics documented a settlement in the location, its character is unclear.

===10th to 13th centuries===
The development of Nitra was temporarily slowed down after the disintegration of Great Moravia. However, Nitra did not follow the fate of other prominent Great Moravian centres (Mikulčice-Valy, Pohansko, Staré Město-Uherské Hradište), and until the 13th century it preserved its status as a prestigious centre. According to older assumptions, Nitra should have been occupied by masses of Magyar (Hungarian) units, predictably followed by significant destruction of the previous settlements. However, later archaeological research does not support this theory. The extinction horizon (e.g. destruction by fire) is not documented for any known settlement, and the continuity between the graveyards from different periods remained high. In the 10th century, the settlement structure was not affected by any observable destruction process or significant change in the ethnic composition. The continuity of Slavic settlements and economic infrastructure was preserved. Archaeological evidence pointing to an early presence of Magyars directly in Nitra has not been found yet, except of the warrior grave in Nitra-Mlynárce. Paradoxically, their presence is documented north of Nitra (Čakajovce) and from peripheral areas with more rural character, where they joined the majority Slavic population. Here, their members were buried together with the Slavs in common graveyards. Later, both cultures merged into the common Bijelo Brdo culture, with ethnic-specific attributes fading away.

Political affiliation of the territory in the 10th and the early 11th century is unclearthe influence of Hungarian Árpáds, Czech Přemyslids and Polish Piasts is being considered. Finally, Nitra became an integral part of the Kingdom of Hungary and the seat of several Árpáds princes. The town survived the invasion of Mongols in 1241. In 1248, Béla IV gave Nitra the privileges of a free royal town. In 1271–1272, Nitra was heavily damaged by the Czech king Ottakar II. The raids also damaged the bishop&#x27;s property and therefore, as compensation, Nitra was put under his administration in 1288. The town lost its royal privileges and in the next centuries it was unable to recover mainly because of frequent military conflicts.

===14th to 19th centuries===
In the early 14th century, the town and the castle were damaged several times by Matthew III Csák. In the conflict between the king and oligarchy the bishop of Nitra remained loyal to the king. In 1313, the king confirmed bishopric privileges and extended them for the right to administer not only Nitra, but whole Nitra County.

The town became a target of Hussite attacks in the 15th century, at the time defended by Ispán of Nitra county, Stibor of Stiboricz and later his son Stibor de Beckov. After the Hungarian defeat at the Battle of Mohács in 1526 and subsequent Ottoman advances into the Hungarian territory, Nitra was under threat of Ottoman attacks. In 1563, the town became the seat of the Captaincy of Lower Hungary. The Turkish forces failed to capture the castle three times, before they conquered it in 1663. Habsburg troops under Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches recaptured it on 2 May 1664 prior to the Battle of Léva. The Turks returned at the start of the Great Turkish War and held the town until 1685. The town was also affected by anti-Habsburg uprisings, from Stephen Bocskay and Gabriel Bethlen uprisings in the 17th century to the Kuruc uprisings from 1703 to 1711, and the town burned down in 1708 as a result of fights. It was renovated in the 18th century in the Baroque style. As a consequence of the Revolutions of 1848, Nitra was awarded an independent self-government for the first time since 1288 and became independent from the Diocese of Nitra and its bishops. Still an agricultural and handicraft town, Nitra started to industrialize. Until World War I, distillery, agricultural machines factory, brewery, dairy and other works were established. The first indirect connection to a railway was a road built in 1850 to the closest station in Trnovec nad Váhom. The railway arrived to Nitra in 1876, when a connection from Šurany was built. Later, lines were built to Topoľčany, Hlohovec and Nové Zámky. As a part of Magyarization, from 1883 to 1919, Nitra was the seat of the Upper Hungarian Teaching Association (FEMKE), a government-sponsored association whose main goal was to apply Magyarization policies on Slovaks.

===20th to 21st centuries===

After World War I and in the atmosphere of postwar chaos and raising anarchy, the Hungarian National Council in Nitra decided to negotiate with the Czechoslovak Army, pushing out Hungarian military forces and police from the territory of present Slovakia. The Hungarian National Council and the Town Council needed the Czechoslovak Army to restore public order, but hoped that situation was only temporary and formally protested against the &quot;occupation&quot; on 10 December 1918. However, the town became a part of Czechoslovakia. Nitra continued to be the seat of the Nitra county, until it was dissolved in 1928. In 1933, Nitra played an important role in the Slovak autonomist movement when the Pribina&#x27;s Celebration (the anniversary of the consecration of the first Christian church) turned to the largest demonstration against Czechoslovakism.

After the break-up of Czechoslovakia in 1939, Nitra became a part of the First Slovak Republic and once again a seat of Nitra county until 1945. The period of the First Slovak Republic was tragic for the Jewish population of Nitra, which was first victimized by the anti-Jewish law and then mostly exterminated in German concentration camps (90% of Jewish citizens). The city was liberated by the Soviet Red Army in 1945, for only three years of restored democracy in Czechoslovakia.

Slovak historians believe that Nitra is the location of the oldest Slovakian Jewish community.

The Communist period from 1948 to 1989 was marked by the oppression of the Catholic church, which has traditionally had a strong presence in Nitra. Catholic seminaries, monasteries and other properties were nationalized and converted to museums, schools and offices. This period experienced extensive growth, building of housing projects and annexing of formerly independent villages. After the Velvet Revolution of 1989 and dissolution of Czechoslovakia, Nitra became part of newly established Slovakia and became a seat of the Nitra Region in 1996.

In 2008, the remains of Jozef Tiso—the controversial leader of the First Slovak Republic who collaborated with the Nazis and was executed in 1947 as a war criminal—were exhumed from a Bratislava cemetery and reburied in the canonical crypt of the Catholic Cathedral in Nitra.

==Geography==

===Topography===
Nitra lies at an altitude of above sea level and covers an area of . It is located in the Nitra River valley in the Danubian Lowland, where the bigger part of the city is located. A smaller part is located at the southernmost reaches of the Tribeč mountains, more precisely at the foothill of the Zobor mountain . It is around halfway between Slovak capital Bratislava, away and central Slovak city of Banská Bystrica, away. Other towns in the surroundings include Trnava to the west (53 km), Topoľčany to the north (35 km), Levice to the east (42 km), and Nové Zámky (37 km) and Komárno (71 km) to the south. A national natural reservation called &quot;Zoborská lesostep&quot; is located within the city&#x27;s boundaries.

===Climate===
Nitra lies in the humid continental climate with four distinct seasons. It is characterized by a significant variation between hot summers and cold, snowy winters. The city is located in the warmest and driest part of Slovakia.


==Main sights==

Points of interest in the area include the Nitra Castle, the old town and the adjacent hill, named Zobor, overlooking the city.

Notable religious structures located in Nitra are St. Emmeram&#x27;s Cathedral in Nitra castle, a Piarist church of St. Ladislaus and the adjacent monastery.
The oldest church of the city is the Saint Stephen church, which was built in the 11th-12th century, although the foundation of the building was constructed in the 9th century.

The monastery on Piaristicka street was founded in the 13th-14th century. Its dominant church of St. Ladislaus was later destroyed by a fire and remodelled in 1742–1748 in baroque style. Two towers were also added. The main altar has a statue ornamentation which the portraits of Saint Stephen and Ladislaus I of Hungary. The interior was renovated in 1940 and three modern frescos depicting themes from Slovak history of Nitra were created. 

The old town (Staré Mesto) is dominated by the castle (&quot;Hrad&quot;), which is one of the most interesting ancient structures in Slovakia. Archeological finding indicate that a large fortified castle had already stood here at the time of Samo&#x27;s Empire, in the seventh century. Archaeological findings prove the existence of a church from the ninth century beneath the more recent Gothic St. Emmeram&#x27;s Cathedral. The construction of the stone castle began during the 9th century during the reign of the Prince of Nitra Svätopluk. The castle currently serves as the seat of one of Roman Catholic bishoprics in Slovakia, which was founded in 880 as the first bishopric of western and eastern Slavs, which continued its existence since then, with the break from the 10th century until around 1110.

The Dražovce church is a remarkable example of the early Romanesque architecture.

The Nitra Synagogue was built in 1908-1911 for the Neolog Jewish community. It was designed by Lipót (Leopold) Baumhorn (1860–1932), the prolific Budapest-based synagogue architect. Located in a narrow lane, the building is typical of Baumhorn&#x27;s style. A mélange of Moorish, Byzantine and Art Nouveau elements, it faces the street with a two-tower façade. The sanctuary is a domed hall supported by four pillars that also support the women&#x27;s gallery. After more than a decade of restoration by the municipality of Nitra, the building is now used as a center for cultural activities. The women&#x27;s gallery houses &quot;The Fate of Slovak Jews&quot; – Slovakia&#x27;s national Holocaust memorial exhibition. The Nitra Synagogue serves as a permanent exhibition space for graphic works by the Nitra-born Israeli artist Shraga Weil.

The most powerful medium wave transmitter of Slovakia, running on 1098 kHz , was situated in Nitra at Velke Kostolany until recently. This transmitter could broadcast throughout all of Europe at night. Since 2003, however, it has operated on lower output to save energy cost, and has transmitted regional programming only. 

The Virgin Mary&#x27;s mission house at the Calvary hill was built in 1765 for Spanish order of Nazarens. They were taking care of the church and pilgrims. Later, the building served as an orphanage. In 1878-85 this building was rebuilt in the Novoromanesque style and in 1925 one new floor was added to the building. The building as we know it today is a work of Slovak architect M. M. Harminec. Nowadays the whole building is mission house of The Divine Word Society. The Mission museum of nations and cultures is located in this building.

(According to the Slovak Jewish Heritage Center the Jews made up a quarter of the total population and the vast majority of them spoke Hungarian and were for census purposes not counted as a separate ethnicity in order to inflate the number of Hungarians.) In 1940, Nitra was home to 4,358 Jews. In the 21st century, the population of Nitra begun declining from the peak of 87,690 in 2002 to 75,208 in 2025.

<text>Poprad (; ; ) is a city in northern Slovakia at the foot of the High Tatra Mountains, famous for its picturesque historic centre and as a holiday resort. The largest town of the Spiš region and the largest of all towns in the vicinity of the High Tatra Mountains in both Slovakia and Poland, Poprad is the tenth largest city in Slovakia, with a population of approximately 50,000.

The Poprad-Tatry Airport is an international airport located just outside the city. Poprad is also the starting point of the Tatra Electric Railway (known in Slovak as &quot;Tatranská elektrická železnica&quot;), a set of special narrow-gauge trains (trams) connecting the resorts in the High Tatras with each other and with Poprad. Main line trains link Poprad to other destinations in Slovakia and beyond; in particular, there are through trains running from Poprad to Prague in the Czech Republic.

==History==

The territory was since the Migration Period inhabited by Slavic settlers. The first written record dates from 16 March 1256 in the deed of donation of the Hungarian King Bela IV. After the Mongol invasions in the 13th century it was colonized by German settlers and became the largely German town &quot;Deutschendorf&quot; meaning &#x27;Germans&#x27; village&#x27;. From 1412 to 1770, as one of the Spis towns, Poprad was pawned by the Kingdom of Hungary to the Kingdom of Poland, resulting in a strong Polish influence on the city&#x27;s further development. In the 17th century, the number of Germans began to decline. Since 1918 this territory was placed under the control of Czechoslovakia.

Poprad itself was for 690 years (up until 1946) just one of several neighbouring settlements, which currently make up the modern city. The other parts of the current municipality are &quot;Matejovce&quot; (German: &quot;Matzdorf&quot;; Hungarian: &quot;Mateóc&quot;, first reference 1251), &quot;Spišská Sobota&quot; (German: &quot;Georgenberg&quot;; Hungarian: &quot;Szepesszombat&quot;, 1256), &quot;Veľká&quot; (German/Hungarian: &quot;Felka&quot;, 1268), and &quot;Stráže pod Tatrami&quot; (German: &quot;Michelsdorf&quot;; Hungarian: &quot;Strázsa&quot;, 1276). The most significant of these original towns was Georgenberg, now Spišská Sobota, which preserved its dominant position in the area until the late 19th century.

Poprad gained importance at the expense of Spišská Sobota after the construction of the Košice–Bohumín Railway in 1871. In the following years, further railway lines were built: Poprad - Kežmarok in 1892 and Tatra Electric Railway in 1908.

In 1942, during World War II, most of the transports of Jews to ghettos and concentration camps in German-occupied Poland were sent from the Poprad railway station. The first transport of about 1,000 Jewish girls and young women left Poprad on 25 March 1942 for Auschwitz-Birkenau. By the end of 1942, when the deportations stopped, over 58,000 Jews had been deported from Slovakia to German-occupied Poland via Poprad.

Poprad was liberated on 28 January 1945 by troops of the Soviet 18th Army. The German population was expelled afterwards.

After the war, the neighbouring settlements were incorporated into Poprad: Spišská Sobota and Veľká in 1945, Stráže pod Tatry in 1960 and Matejovce in 1974. At that time, with the development of winter sports, Poprad became the starting point for expeditions to the High Tatras.

<doc id="349031" wikidata="Q145002" url="?curid=349031" title="Trenčín">
<text>Trenčín (, also known by other alternative names) is a city in western Slovakia of the central Váh River valley near the Czech border, around from Bratislava. It has a population of more than 55,000, which makes it the eighth largest municipality of the country and is the seat of the Trenčín Region and the Trenčín District. It has a medieval castle, Trenčín Castle, on a rock above the city.
Trenčín is chosen as the European Capital of Culture in 2026.

==Names and etymology==

Trenčín was first mentioned under the Greek name &quot;Leukaristos&quot; (Λευκάριστος), depicted on the Ptolemy world map around 150 AD . During the course of the Marcomannic Wars between the Roman Empire and Germanic Quadi, the Romans carved an inscription on the rock under the present-day castle in 179 AD and the place was mentioned as &quot;Laugaricio&quot;. For a long time it was considered the northernmost known presence of the Romans in Central Europe.

The first written mentions in the Middle Ages are from 1111 (as &quot;Treinchen&quot;) and 1113 (adjective &quot;Trenciniensis&quot;). The name is probably derived from a personal name Trnka/Trenka (Slovak/Slavic - Blackthorn) with a possessive suffix &quot;-ín&quot;. The German, Hungarian, and Polish forms are &quot;Trentschin&quot;, &quot;Trencsén&quot;, and &quot;Trenczyn&quot;, respectively.

==History==

The site of Trenčín has been inhabited since time immemorial. Trenčín Castle, a typical medieval fortified castle is situated high on a rock above the city.
Trenčín is best known for a Roman inscription on the rock below the Trenčín Castle dating from 179 AD, the era of the Marcomannic Wars, a series of wars between the Roman Empire and the Germanic Quadi and Marcomanni. It denotes the site as &quot;Laugaricio&quot; and for long time it was the most northern known evidence of the presence of Roman soldiers in central Europe (until the Roman fort by Mušov and marching camps by Olomouc and Hulín were found).

Trenčín is one of the suggested locations for the capital of Samo&#x27;s Empire in the 7th century. Wogastisburg (Vogast castle) was probably located somewhere on the Vogas river and was also the site of a decisive battle between the Slavic and Frankish armies in 631.

It is plausible that Trenčín Castle was founded during the Great Moravian era. In the beginning of the 11th century, the region was controlled by king Bolesław I the Brave of Poland. In 1017, Stephen I of Hungary conquered the region which remained part of Hungary until 1918. By the end of the 11th century, the castle became the administrative centre of Trencsén county in the Kingdom. As one of the few stone castles in the country it resisted the disastrous invasion of Mongols in 1241. In 1263, Trenčín was in the possession of the royal Swordbearer Jakab Cseszneky, but in 1302 King Wenceslas I took it away from the Cseszneky brothers because they were supporting his rival Charles Robert, and donated it to Matúš Čák. Between 1302 and 1321 the castle was the seat of the powerful magnate Matthew Csák who controlled most of present-day Slovakia. Challenging the authority of King Charles Robert, Csák maintained a large court and pursued his own foreign policy. The Treaty of Trentschin between Bohemia, Hungary, and Poland was signed in the city in 1335.
Trenčín gained a number of privileges during the Middle Ages: In 1324 the inhabitants were freed from paying tolls and the city received free royal town privileges in 1412 from King Sigismund. However, during the following decades and centuries there were catastrophes and wars which lasted until the end of the 18th century. During the conflict between the Habsburgs and the supporters of the rival king, János Szapolyai, the town was captured in 1528 by imperial troops. In the 17th century the Ottomans were another threat from the south but they failed to conquer the city. The town then suffered from the Kuruc uprising against the Habsburgs and on 3 August 1708 the Battle of Trenčín took place close to the city. Two years later a plague killed 1,600 inhabitants of the city. Finally, in 1790 the town, along with the castle, was burned down and the castle has been in ruins ever since.

In the 19th century, Trenčín flourished as the railways to Žilina and Bratislava were built and many new enterprises were established, particularly in the textile, food and machine industries.

The town became the hub of the middle Považie region.

In 1867 Trenčín was downgraded from a &quot;free royal town&quot; to a &quot;town with municipal government&quot; and came under the direct control of the chief of Trenčín county.
Trenčín flourished again during the era of the first Czechoslovak republic and became the capital of the Trenčín county again between 1940 and 1945 when the Slovak Republic was in existence.

Shortly after the Slovak National Uprising began, Trenčín was occupied by Nazi Germany and it became the headquarters of the Sicherheitsdienst and the Gestapo.

Trenčín was captured by the Romanian and Soviet troops on 10 April 1945.

<text>Trnava (, , ; , also known by other alternative names) is a city in western Slovakia, to the northeast of Bratislava, on the Trnávka river. It is the capital of the Trnava Region and the Trnava District. It is the seat of a Roman Catholic archbishopric (1541–1820 and then again since 1977). The city has a historic center. Because of the many churches within its city walls, Trnava has often been called &quot;Little Rome&quot; (, ), or more recently, the &quot;Slovak Rome&quot;.

==Names and etymology==

The name of the city is derived from the name of the creek Trnava. It comes from the Old Slavic/Slovak word &quot;tŕň&quot; (&quot;thornbush&quot;) which characterized the river banks in the region. Many towns in Central Europe have a similar etymology including Trnovo in Slovakia as well as Tarnów (Poland), Tarnow (Germany), Veliko Tarnovo (Bulgaria), Trnava and Trnavac (Serbia); and Tyrnavos (Greece) among others. In Hungarian, the original name had gradually evolved into &quot;Tyrna&quot; which influenced also later German and Latin forms.

When it developed into an important market town, it received the Hungarian name of &quot;Nagyszombat&quot; (&quot;Sumbot&quot; 1211), literally &quot;Great Saturday&quot;, referring to the weekly market fairs held on Saturdays (). However, this name was only used by the royal chamber, as is indicated by the adoption of the Slovak name rather than the Hungarian name by German newcomers after the Mongol invasion.

The varieties of the name in different languages include ; (from the 14th century onward) and .

==History==
Permanent settlements on the city&#x27;s territory are known from the Neolithic period onwards.

===Middle Ages===
During the Middle Ages, an important market settlement arose here at the junction of two important roads – from Bohemia to Hungary and from the Mediterranean to Poland.

The first written reference to Trnava dates from 1211. In 1238, Trnava was the first town in (present-day) Slovakia to be granted a town charter (civic privileges) by the king. The former agricultural center gradually became a center of manufacture, trade, and crafts. By the early 13th century, the king of Hungary had invited numerous Germans to settle in Trnava; this settlement increased after the Tatar invasion in 1242. At the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, a part of Trnava was enclosed by very long city walls. The original Hungarian and Slovak market settlement and the Germans stayed behind this wall.

Trnava was also the place of many important negotiations: Charles I, the king of Hungary, signed here a currency agreement with the Czech King John of Luxemburg in 1327, and King Louis I (who often stayed in the town and died there in 1382) signed a friendship agreement with Emperor Charles IV there in 1360.

====Hussites and Slovak majority====
The temporary German majority in Trnava&#x27;s population yielded in favour of the Slovaks during the campaigns undertaken by the Czech Hussites in the 15th century. In April 1430, the Hussites penetrated close to the town and defeated the Hungarian army in the Battle of Trnava. However, they suffered heavy losses and withdrew to Moravia. On 24 Jun 1432 a small group of Hussites masked as tradesmen entered the town, overcame the guards in the night and captured the town without a fight. Then, they made Trnava the center of their campaigns in northwestern Kingdom of Hungary from 1432 to 1435.

===16th-18th centuries===
The town, along with the rest of the territory of present-day Slovakia, gained importance after the conquest of most of what is today Hungary by the Ottoman Empire in 1541, when Trnava became the see (1541–1820) of the Archbishopric of Esztergom (before 1541 and after 1820 the see was the town of Esztergom, which was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1543). The cathedrals of the archbishopric were the Saint John the Baptist Cathedral and the Saint Nicholas Cathedral in the town. Many ethnic Hungarians fleeing from the Turks moved to the town after 1541 also from present-day Hungary, which mainly remained under Ottoman rule until being gradually reconquered and the last enemy troops were defeated in 1699.

In the 16th and especially the 17th century, Trnava was an important center of the Counter-Reformation in the Kingdom of Hungary (at the time largely identical with the territory of present-day Slovakia and a strip of western Hungary). The Archbishop Nicolaus Olahus invited the Jesuits to Trnava in 1561 in order to develop the municipal school system. Subsequently, he had a seminary opened in 1566 and in 1577 Trnava&#x27;s priest Nicolas Telegdi founded a book-printing house in the town. The first Catholic Bible translation into Hungarian (based on the Latin Vulgate) was also completed in the town by the Jesuit György Káldi who was born there in 1573. The 17th century was also characterized by many anti-Habsburg uprisings in the country – these revolts of Stephen Bocskay, Gabriel Bethlen, George I Rákóczi, and Imre Thököly negatively affected Trnava&#x27;s life. On 26 December 1704 Francis II Rákóczi&#x27;s army suffered a decisive defeat against the Imperial Army, led by Sigbert Heister, near Trnava.

It was after establishment of archbishopric and canonry that Trnava acquired a nickname of &quot;A Little Rome&quot;. As the city of Rome was a center of universal Catholic Church, town of Trnava had been seen in popular view as center of Catholicism in Kingdom of Hungary. As contemporary scholar Matthias Bel had overstated: &quot;You could say it is a town which is appearing as Rome on a small scale, and this, as to temples and also sacred institutions which were infused within it. Truly thats why the people calls it a Little Rome, knowing that small things are compared with big ones&quot;.

The Jesuit Trnava University (1635–1777), the only university of the Kingdom of Hungary at that time, was founded by Archbishop Péter Pázmány.
Founded to support the Counter-Reformation, Trnava University soon became a center of Slovak education and literature also, since some of the teachers, half of the students were Slovaks.

Pázmány himself was instrumental in promoting the usage of Slovak instead of Czech and had his work &quot;Isteni igazságra vezető kalauz&quot; (Guide to the Truth of God) and several of his sermons translated into Slovak.

From the late 18th century Trnava became a center of the literary and artistic Slovak National Revival. The first standard codification of Slovak (by the priest Anton Bernolák in 1787) was based on the Slovak dialect used in the region of Trnava.

===19th century to Great War===
In 1820 the seat of archbishopric had been transferred back to Osztrihom and Trnava ceased to be religious center of historic Kingdom of Hungary.

Importance of town increased however again, when Trnava was connected with Bratislava through the horse-drawn railway.

In 1838 &quot;Pozsony-Nagyszombati Első Magyar Vasúttársaság&quot; (First Hungarian Bratislava-Trnava Railway Company) was founded in order to connect royal towns with railway system.
In 1840 horse-drawn railway starting to operate on the route Bratislava-Svätý Jur, as a first railway line in the Kingdom of Hungary ever. With connection to Trnava, the planned route was solemnly opened in June 1846 to be later prolonged to Sered in December 1846.

During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 Richard Guyon&#x27;s army had been repulsed out of Trnava after clash with an Austrian army under command of on 14 December, in 1848.

===In time after Austro-Hungarian Compromise===

In 1867 Austro-Hungarian compromise had come into force, becoming milestone in politics and administration of empire. For this period had been determined as self-governed urban district (&quot;rendezett tanácsú város/Stadt mit geordnete Magistrat&quot;) within Pozsony County, also being seat of Trnava rural district.

Slovak national foundations, like Matica slovenská were suppressed or banned in Kingdom of Hungary as a result of the Magyarization policy. In that time of national and linguistic oppression of Slovaks the (&quot;Spolok sv. Vojtecha&quot;) was founded in Trnava in 1870. Initially being tasked with publishing of catholic literature, the association with its headquarters in Trnava had been working as foremost Slovak language institution until Dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918.

In the 19th but mainly in the early 20th century the town grew behind its city walls and a part of the wall was demolished in the 19th century, but most of it is still well-preserved.

In 1873 a reconstructed railway route from Bratislava to Trnava, trafficking with steam engines, instead of previous horse-drawn, had been handed over to use. First steam train reached at Trnava railway station on May 1, 1873.

The renewed connection launched a modernization of the town, which started with the erection of a big sugar factory, a malt-house and of the Coburgh&#x27;s factory (later referred to as &quot;Trnavské automobilové závody&quot;, i.e. &quot;Trnava Car Factory&quot;).

===After 1918===
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, Trnava was one of the most industrialized towns of the country. During World War II, Trnava was occupied on 1 April 1945 by troops of the Soviet 2nd Ukrainian Front.

In 1977, by a decision of Pope Paul VI, Trnava became the see of a separate Slovak archbishopric (although the seat moved to Bratislava in 2008, the city still remains a seat of its own archbishopric). With the establishment of this archbishopric, Slovakia became independent of Hungary also in terms of church administration for the first time in centuries.

After the establishment of Slovakia (1993), Trnava became the capital of the newly created Trnava Region in 1996.

==Geography==

Trnava lies at an altitude of above sea level and covers an area of . It is located in the Danubian Lowland on the Trnávka river, around north-east of Bratislava, west of Nitra and around from the Czech border. The closest mountain ranges are the Little Carpathians to the west and the Považský Inovec to the north-east of the city.

===Climate===
Trnava lies in the north temperate zone and has a continental climate with four distinct seasons. It is characterized by a significant variation between warm summers and cold winters.

==Demographics==
===Historic===
The rise of Trnava is closely related to the &quot;Latin Guests&quot;, newcomers speaking a Romance language, probably arriving from present-day Belgium (Walloons). In 1238, the expansion of the town was supported by the decree about a free movement to Trnava. In the Middle Ages, &quot;German Guests&quot; played a main role in the social composition of the town and they dominated also in trade and town administration. The decline of the German population and a permanent change of the ethnic composition dates back to the occupation of the town by the Hussite army (1432-1435). Nevertheless, the continuity of the original Slovak population was not interrupted and the Slovaks have intensively tried to achieve representation in the town council. Repeated conflicts between Germans and Slovaks were resolved in 1486 by the king Matthias Corvinus. In this time, the dominant language in the town was already Slovak. The medieval Hungarian population was represented only by several families, but more Hungarians settled in town after the Battle of Mohács of 1526 and the subsequent dissolution of the Hungarian kingdom which was split into three parts. The ethnic new tensions had to be again resolved by the king. The Hungarians were made equal to the Slovaks and the Germans by Ferdinand I, who also ordered parity representation of all three nationalities in the administration (4 April 1551). The estimated size of the population in the 16th century was 2,000-3,000 citizens. At the end of the Middle Ages, the town was inhabited by cca 5,000 people including those living in suburbs behind the city walls. A presence of the Jewish community is well documented from the 14th century.

===Jews in Trnava===
Jews arrived into the area in the 11th century. A presence in Trnava is documented from the 14th century. In 1494, 14 Jews were brought to death by burning following a blood libel. A 1503 account of the 1494 ritual murder trial introduces for the first time in history the notion that Jews as a collectivity were of feminine gender and had monthly bleedings, a libel which would become part of the repertoire of Christian antisemitism from then on. After another blood libel, the Jews were expelled from the city in 1539 and only in 1783 were Jews allowed to return to the city. Until World War II, Trnava was home to a sizable Jewish minority. During the Holocaust, 82% of the Jews were sent to extermination camps in 1942.

==Municipal government==
The current municipal government structure has been in place since 1990, and is composed of a mayor (&quot;primátor&quot;) and of a city council (&quot;Mestské zastupiteľstvo&quot;), which in turn leads a city board (&quot;Mestská rada&quot;) and city commissions (&quot;Komisie mestského zastupiteľstva&quot;). The mayor is the city&#x27;s top executive officer, elected for a four-year term; the current mayor is Peter Brocka, who is serving his first term and was inaugurated to function on 12 December 2014. The city council is the highest legislative body of the city, represented by 31 councillors, elected to a concurrent term with the mayor&#x27;s. Since 2002, Trnava is divided into six urban districts, with area and further sub-units in parentheses:
*Trnava-centre (2.15 km2; &quot;Staré mesto&quot; [Old Town], &quot;Špiglsál&quot;)
*Trnava-west (20.60 km2; &quot;Prednádražie&quot;)
*Trnava-south (8.03 km2; &quot;Tulipán&quot;, &quot;Linčianska&quot;)
*Trnava-east (10.66 km2; &quot;Hlboká&quot;, &quot;Vozovka&quot;)
*Trnava-north (22.33 km2; &quot;Kopánka&quot;, &quot;Zátvor&quot;, &quot;Vodáreň&quot;)
*Modranka (7.76 km2)

However, compared to the present-day total area of 71.53 km2, the city used to have a larger area. Its height was in the 1970s, when it annexed villages of Modranka, Biely Kostol and Hrnčiarovce nad Parnou, reaching an area of almost 90 km2. The latter two separated in 1993 and 1994, respectively.

==Main sights==


As early as in the Middle Ages, Trnava was an important centre of Gothic religious and lay architecture – St. Nicolas&#x27;s Church, St. Helen&#x27;s Church and several church monastery complexes (Clarist, Franciscan and Dominican) were built in this period.

The Renaissance (16th century) added a town tower to Trnava&#x27;s silhouette. Nicolas Oláh ordered the erection of the Seminary and Archbishop&#x27;s Palace. Péter Bornemisza and , the leading personalities of the Reformation in the Kingdom of Hungary, were active in Trnava for a short time. The town ramparts were rebuilt to a Renaissance fortification as a reaction to the approaching Turkish danger from the south.

The 17th century was characterized by the construction of the Paulinian Church that bears badges of Silesian Renaissance. Trnava was gradually redesigned to Baroque. The erection of the St. John the Baptist Church and of the university campus launched a building rush that continued with the reconstruction of the Franciscan and Clarist&#x27;s complexes. Builders and artists called to build the university also participated in improvements of the burgher architecture. The Holy Trinity Statue and the group of statues of Saint Joseph, the Ursulinian and Trinitarian Church and Monastery are of recent construction.

The District hospital was built 1824. The building of the theatre started in May 1831 and the first performance was played at Christmas. Both of the Trnava synagogues, historical structures with oriental motifs, date back to the 19th century. The Synagogue Status Quo Ante currently houses the Jána Koniareka art gallery.

===Controversies===

Renovated in 2010, the 19th-century Orthodox Synagogue which was falling into disrepair, was turned into a chic, modern cafe named Synagoga Cafe in 2016.

Critics view the business as an example of exploitative cultural appropriation in the wake of the Holocaust, where the former occupants were sent to concentration camps. Whereas, advocates argue that it reflects respect and nostalgia for Jews in addition to providing a vehicle for at least some preservation of the heritage site.

<text>Zvolen (; ; ) is a city in central Slovakia, situated on the confluence of Hron and Slatina rivers. It is famous for several historical and cultural attractions. It is surrounded by Poľana mountain from the East, by Kremnické vrchy from the West and by Javorie and Štiavnické vrchy from the South.

The population numbers approximately 40,000, which makes it the twelfth-largest city in Slovakia by population, thirteenth by size. It is the center of the Podpoľanie historical region and the seat of a county (Zvolen District). It is also an important transportation hub in Slovakia, being one of the four central train stations in Slovakia (others are Bratislava, Košice and Žilina).

==Etymology==
The name is of Slovak (Slavic) origin meaning &quot;the chosen one, splendid, excellent&quot;. The Hungarian &#x27; and the German &#x27; were derived from the Latinized form &quot;&quot; (earliest mention 1135). An adjective &quot;Old&quot; (, , ) distinguish Zvolen from Banská Bystrica ().

==History==

Zvolen has been inhabited since the Paleolithic. In the ninth century, a Slavic settlement (today the Môťová neighborhood) became a regional center of what is now central Slovakia. Zvolen remained the capital of Zólyom County until the 1760s. In the 11th and 12th centuries, one of the largest medieval castles in Europe, Pustý hrad, was constructed. The town, originally built under the castle, lay on an important trade route (&quot;Via Magna&quot;) from Buda to Kraków. Zvolen was granted town privileges by King Béla IV in the 1230s - as one of the first towns in the Kingdom of Hungary. The privileges were confirmed on 28 December 1243, after the original document was destroyed in war. Later, King Louis I the Great built a new castle, which became a popular hunting resort of the Hungarian kings. The future queen regnant Mary of Hungary and emperor Sigismund celebrated their wedding there in 1385.

In the Rákóczi&#x27;s War of Independence the Kuruc army in the battle of Zvolen defeated the enemy forces from Austria, Denmark, Vojvodina and Hungary.

In 1848–49, Ľudovít Štúr was a member of the Diet, with Zvolen as his constituency. In 1871–1872, two new railways were built and Zvolen became an important railroad hub and important industrial center. Zvolen played an important role during the Slovak National Uprising. Two of its armored trains, which were made in the local railway manufactory, Hurban and Štefánik can be seen near the Zvolen castle.

Zvolen is an important railroad, an important road hub and has a large timber factory and a technical university, the Technická univerzita vo Zvolene. An airport in nearby Sliač used to offer direct flights to Prague, but has been used exclusively by the military since 2021.

The town square was modernized in 2002 and local businesses are popular with tourists. In wintertime an ice rink is constructed in the center and festive celebrations run throughout December.

==Demographics==
Zvolen currently has a population of 39 453. For comparison, in 2005, Zvoled had a population of 43,147. According to the 2001 census, 95.9% of inhabitants were Slovaks and 1.2% Czechs. The religious make-up was 52.5% Roman Catholics, 26.4% people with no religious affiliation, and 15% Lutherans.

==Culture==

===Castles===
Zvolen&#x27;s paramount landmark, the Zvolenský zámok Castle, stands as a significant symbol of the city&#x27;s historical and cultural heritage. Within its venerable walls, the Slovak National Gallery curates a distinguished collection spanning Gothic to modern art, offering visitors an immersive experience in artistic evolution. Notably, since its establishment in 1974, the castle&#x27;s courtyard has been the esteemed venue for the Zámocké hry zvolenské, an annual outdoor professional theatre festival of great renown. This cultural tradition underscores the castle&#x27;s pivotal role as a nexus of artistic expression and community engagement in the region.

The oldest castle in Zvolen is Pustý hrad Castle. Covering an area of over four hectares, it ranks among the most extensive castle ruins not only in Slovakia but also in Central Europe.
Due to the largely concealed state of the preserved ruins from the city of Zvolen, a portion of the hill of Horný hrad was cleared of trees. Currently, it is possible not only to observe the castle walls&#x27; remnants from Zvolen but also to enjoy the panoramic view of the Zvolenská kotlina basin and the surrounding mountain ranges from Pustý hrad.

=== Churches ===
The dominant feature of the main town square in the city center is the isolated building of Roman-Catholic parish Church of St. Elizabeth from the 14th century. The building was later modified in the late Gothic style around the year 1500, and subsequently in the 16th century and the 18th century in the Baroque style.

Another important church is the Lutheran St. Trinity Church. A single-nave originally late Baroque building with a polygonally terminated chancel and a protruding tower from the year 1784. In the years 1856-1857, a tower was built according to the project of František Mikša.

===Theatre===
The Professional Theatre in central Zvolen commenced operations in 1949 under the name Stredoslovenské divadlo. It was reportedly chosen as one of the region&#x27;s established institutions due to its contributions during the Slovak National Uprising and to bolster the cultural and industrial fabric of the city. Since 1954, the institution has been known as the Jozef Gregor Theatre.

===Trains===
The dominating feature of the eastern part of the town centre is the model of the Hurban armoured train as a memorial to the Slovak National Uprising which is situated in the park between the Castle and the main Zvolen osobná railway station. It was manufactured in 1944 in the railway workshops of Zvolen.

The Historic Technology Club at Zvolen&#x27;s Locomotive Depot is a non-profit organization founded in 1998. It&#x27;s dedicated to preserving railway history and showcasing historic vehicles through events like nostalgic rides and exhibitions. The club has restored various locomotives and expanded the museum vehicle park. It also co-organizes the annual Grand Prix steam locomotive races in Zvolen.

==Sport==

===Ice Hockey===
The ice hockey club HKM Zvolen is the third most successful hockey club in Slovakia. It plays in Slovakia&#x27;s highest league, the Slovak Extraliga, and has won three titles in 2001, 2012 and 2021. Another noteworthy achievement is winning the IIHF Continental Cup in 2005. Since 1965, their home is the Zvolen Ice Stadium which has a capacity of 5,345 spectators.

The Slovak Women&#x27;s Ice Hockey Extraliga is played by the local club ŽHKm Zvolen, which is a female alternative of the HKM Zvolen.

===Football===
The football club MFK Zvolen is a Slovak football team, based in the town of Zvolen. The club was established in 1902. The club plays home matches at MFK Zvolen Stadium in Zvolen which has a capacity of 1 870 spectators.

<doc id="349035" wikidata="Q210796" url="?curid=349035" title="Komárno">
<text>Komárno (, , ), colloquially also called &quot;Révkomárom&quot;, &quot;Öregkomárom&quot;, &quot;Észak-Komárom&quot; in Hungarian, is a town in Slovakia at the confluence of the Danube and the Váh rivers. Historically it was formed by the &quot;old town&quot; on the left bank of Danube, present day Komárno in Slovakia, and by a &quot;new town&quot; on the right bank, present day Komárom in Hungary, which were historically one administrative unit. Following World War I and the Treaty of Trianon, the border of the newly created Czechoslovakia cut the historical, unified town in half, creating two new independent towns in two countries. Komárno and Komárom are connected by the Elisabeth Bridge, which used to be an official border crossing between Slovakia and Hungary until border checks were lifted due to the Schengen Area rules. In 2020, a new road bridge was opened.

Komárno is Slovakia&#x27;s principal port on the Danube. It is also the center of the Hungarian community in Slovakia, which makes up 53.8% (2011 census) of the town&#x27;s population. The town is the historic seat of the Serbian national minority in Slovakia.

==Names and etymology==
The name is of Slavic or Latin origin. The first interpretation is straightforward – the name consists of two parts: &quot;komár&quot; (Slavic/Slovak: a mosquito) and an ending &quot;-no&quot; (a place name). Thus, Komárom means &quot;a place with many mosquitos&quot;, reflecting a location in a swampy area near the Danube. According to another theory, the name could be derived from Latin &quot;commercium&quot; (a trade center).

One disputed record of the name of the settlement can be dated back to 1075 as &quot;Camarum&quot;. Further documents mention the settlement as Kamarn(iensis) / Komarn(iense) (1218), Kamarum (1266), Camarum (1268), Kamar (1283) and many other, e.g. Camaron, Comaron (between 1372 and 1498). &quot;Villa Camarun&quot; was one of the 23 settlements belonging to the domain of the Komárom castle.

The Hungarian name for the town is historically &quot;Komárom&quot;. Since the town has been split, the more colloquial names &quot;Révkomárom&quot; (Komárom Port), &quot;Öregkomárom&quot; (Old Komárom) and &quot;Észak-Komárom&quot; (North Komárom) are used to distinguish it from the town on the Hungarian side, which is simply called Komárom.

==History==
Komárno, located at the confluence of the Danube (rom. Ister) and Váh rivers, 108 – 115 meters above sea level, is an old settlement. Findings stem from the Neolithic, Eneolithic period, the Bronze Age. Many archaeological remains found throughout the region surrounding Komárom indicate the area was settled by the Celts toward the end of the 1st Century BC.

During the 1st century AD the Roman Empire extended its frontiers over the region forming the province of Pannonia (present day Transdanubia). Here the Romans, on the southern shore of the Danube, established the military camp and the settlement Brigetio. A chain of fortifications built along the Danube shores protected the camp and town. On the northern shore of the Danube, the fortified bridgehead of Celemantia (near present-day Iža), was built at the beginning of the 2nd century. Some historians suppose that there was a similar Roman fortress on site of the Komárno (Brigetio) Castle because of the strategic importance of the place but excavations have not yet proved this theory. The Romans remained in Pannonia until the end of the 4th century when they were gradually pushed out by the strengthening attacks of barbarian tribes.

Gothic, Slavic and Avar findings have been excavated here from the 7th and 8th century AD. After the collapse of the Avar empire at the end of the 8th century, Komárno had remained one of the last resorts of the Avars. The most significant Avar findings are the so-called Shipyard-graves. They are one of the most significant Avar findings in the Carpathian Basin with 153 graves dated from the 7th–9th century.

In the early 10th century the territory came under the rule of the Magyar tribes. According to the medieval chronicle Gesta Hungarorum, one of the Magyar tribal chieftains, Ketel established his domain near the mouth of the Váh river, his son Alaptolma later built a castle there and named it Komárom. Two-thirds of their people settled around the castle. Both Ketel and Alaptolma were buried in Komárom according to the pagan fashion. Soon after, during the time of the formation of the Hungarian State in the age of Stephen I the fortified settlement with its castle became the center of the Komárom county. The factual accuracy of the Gesta Hungarorum is often disputed and according to excavations, the present-day Komárom Castle was built only in the 12th century.

King Béla IV, in his charter of 1 April 1265, granted the settlement town status and privileges. These privileges contributed to the development of medieval Komárom, helping it establish a flourishing trade market and craft industry. Medieval Komárom prospered, especially under the reign of Mathias Corvinus. He built a renaissance palace within the castle complex and frequented it for rest and pleasure. Mathias Corvinus also established the royal Danube flotilla, which used the town as its main base during the Ottoman wars. In the 16th century Komárom became one of centers of defense for the Habsburg Empire against the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. During the middle of the 16th century, under the reign of Ferdinand I, the medieval castle was rebuilt into a well-defensible fortification. However, it was occupied by Ottomans between 1594 and 1599. The rebuilt fortification became known as the Old Fortress when in the 17th century it was enlarged and expanded to form the New Fortress. In 1663, Komárom became the seat of the Captaincy of Lower Hungary. Both the Old and New Fortresses successfully resisted the attacks of the Turkish army during the course of the Turkish wars. In the 18th century, after the end of the Turkish wars and expulsion of the Turks from the region, Komárom, one of the biggest towns in the country, again began to flourish. Maria Theresa&#x27;s charter of 16 March 1745 granted Komárom the status and privilege of a free royal town. Komárom was soon influenced by the Baroque styles that represented and characterized the Habsburg Empire and its territories. The local nobles and burgers built palaces and the newly arrived Trinitarians, Franciscans and Jesuits built churches.
During the 18th century Komárom experienced many natural disasters including floods, fires, earthquakes, and cholera and plague epidemics. Most notable of these natural disasters were the two earthquakes that completely destroyed the town in 1763 and 1783. Despite these calamities, Komárom continued to be an important center for trade and crafts until the middle of the 19th century. Beginning in the early 19th century, the fortifications surrounding Komárom underwent extensive reconstruction. The reconstruction was interrupted by the Hungarian Revolution of 1848.
Komárom played a significant role in the revolution, remaining the last bastion of the Hungarian resistance against the Austrians until 1849, when the fortress and town were finally surrendered. Captain György Klapka handed over the fortress to the Austrians only after a statement that for every person in the fortress a free withdraw and passport is granted. The town was completely destroyed by the Austrian bombardment and left destitute. During the years of Austrian absolutism, Komárom quickly became a strategic military base. Various military buildings were constructed and in 1876 reconstruction of the fortification system was completed. The town itself only slowly recovered from the destruction during the revolutionary war. It lost its former economic importance and influence as a major town of the region.

===20th century===

Komárom&#x27;s recovery began at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, when construction of iron bridges across the Danube and Váh began as well as the first railway lines linking Komárom to the rest of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It soon became an important transport junction, attracting industry and trade. In 1896 the town of Újszőny on the south side of the Danube was combined with Komárom, allowing the town to expand its territory and development across the Danube.

With the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of the First World War, Komárno found itself under new rule. The forming of Czechoslovakia, whose natural border in the south became the River Danube, separated Komárno from its southern half. In 1919 (confirmed by the Treaty of Trianon in 1920), the territory to the north of the Danube was ceded to Czechoslovakia with the territory to the south of the Danube remaining in Hungary. The town on the northern shore was renamed to Komárno (today the Slovak name of the town), and in 1923 it was reduced from a county seat to a district seat. Although this resulted in a dramatic change in the national composition of Komárno, the majority remained Hungarian.

In fact, Komárno became the centre of cultural and social life of the Hungarians in Czechoslovakia. In 1938, under the First Vienna Award of that year, Komárno (now again as Komárom) was &#x27;returned&#x27; to the Kingdom of Hungary. Its former name and status of town and county seat of the Komárom county was restored. At the onset of the Second World War, Komárno/Komárom became a military centre for the Germans and eventually the frontline for the Germans defending the oil refineries to the south. Although there was no heavy fighting in the Komárom area, it was bombarded several times. The bridges connecting the two territories were destroyed and most of the territory lying on the south bank of the Danube lay in ruins. After the war, the territory on the north bank of the Danube became part of Czechoslovakia again and the town name was changed to Komárno. After the war, large-scale reconstruction of Komárno&#x27;s industries began. The reconstruction of the SLKB Komarno - Slovak Shipyard Komárno, the town&#x27;s largest industrial facility, was completed in 1950 and greatly promoted the economic development of the town. New factories were constructed in the west side of town near the shipyard creating a new industrial district. An urban development plan was implemented as well. Residential districts were created with new housing estates and wide roads were laid across the town.

The two towns used to be a border crossing between Czechoslovakia (today Slovakia) and Hungary, until both countries became part of the Schengen Area, resulting in all immigration and customs checks being lifted on 12 December 2007.

Komárno and Komárom are connected by two bridges: The older iron bridge, and a newer lifting bridge. A third bridge was completed in 2020.
