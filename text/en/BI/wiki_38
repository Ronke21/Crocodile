<text>The luna moth (Actias luna), also called the American moon moth, is a Nearctic moth in the family Saturniidae, subfamily Saturniinae, a group commonly named the giant silk moths.

The moth has lime-green wings and a white body. Its caterpillars are also green. Its typical wingspan is roughly , but wingspans can exceed , ranking the species as one of the larger moths in North America.

Across Canada, it has one generation per year, with the winged adults appearing in late May or early June, whereas farther south it will have two or even three generations per year, the first appearance as early as March in southern parts of the United States.

As defense mechanisms, larvae emit clicks as a warning and can also regurgitate intestinal contents, confirmed as having a deterrent effect on a variety of predators. The elongated tails of the hindwings are thought to confuse the echolocation detection used by predatory bats.

A parasitoid fly deliberately introduced to North America as a biological pest control for the invasive species spongy moth (also known as gypsy moth) appears to have had a negative impact on luna moths and other native moths.

== Description ==

Eggs, attached in small groups to undersides of leaves, are mottled white and brown, slightly oval, and roughly 1.5 millimeters in diameter. Larvae are primarily green, with sparse hairs. The first instar, emerging from the egg, reaches a length of , the second , the third and the fourth . The fifth (final) instar grows to approximately in length. Small, colorful dots – yellow or magenta – may line the sides of the fourth and fifth instars. The larvae may take on a reddish-brown color just prior to cocooning. Fifth-instar larvae descend to the ground and use silk to bind dead leaves around the cocoon.

The imagoes (winged, sexually mature), often referred to as &#x27;adult moths,&#x27; emerge from the pupae with the wings small, crumpled and held close to the body. Over several hours the wings will enlarge to full size. Wingspan is typically , and in rare instances as much as . Females and males are similar in size and appearance: green wings, eyespots on both forewings and hind wings, and long, sometimes somewhat twisted tails extending from the back edge of the hindwings. Bodies are white and hairy. Adults have vestigial mouthparts and do not feed. Energy is from fat stores created while a caterpillar. The forward edge of the forewing is dark-colored and thick, tapering in thickness from the thorax to the wing tip. Its color can range from maroon to brown. The eyespots, one per wing, are oval in shape on the forewings and round on the hindwings. Each eyespot can have arcs of black, blue, red, yellow, green or white. The eyespots are thought to confuse potential predators.

There are some sex-determined and regional differences in appearance. Females will have a larger abdomen compared to males because it contains 200–400 eggs. Both sexes have antennae, but on the male, much longer and wider. Wing color is blue-green in the north and for the overwintering generation in the central and southern states; second and third generation wing color has more of a yellow-green tint.

== Etymology ==

Described and named &quot;Phalena plumata caudata&quot; by James Petiver in 1700, this was the first North American saturniid to be reported in the insect literature. The initial Latin name, which roughly translates to &quot;brilliant, feather tail&quot;, was replaced when Carl Linnaeus described the species in 1758 in the tenth edition of Systema Naturae, and renamed it &quot;Phalaena luna&quot;, later &quot;Actias luna&quot;, with &quot;luna&quot; derived from Luna, the Roman moon goddess. The common name became &quot;Luna moth&quot;. Several other North American giant silk moths were also given species names after Roman or Greek mythology.

== Distribution ==

The Luna moth is found in North America, from east of the Great Plains in the United States – Florida to Maine, and from Saskatchewan eastward through central Quebec to Nova Scotia in Canada. Luna moths are also rarely found in Western Europe as vagrants.

== Life cycle ==

Based on the climate in which they live, Luna moths produce different numbers of generations per year. In Canada and northern regions of the United States, they are univoltine, meaning one generation per year. Life stages are approximately 10 days as eggs, 6–7 weeks as larvae, 2–3 weeks as pupae, finishing with one week as winged adults appearing in late May or early June. In the mid-Atlantic states, the species is bivoltine, characterized by two generations per year. In contrast, farther south, they are trivoltine, producing three generations within the same time frame. In the central states, the first generation appears in April, the second in July. Even farther south, the first generation appears as early as March, with the second and third spaced eight to ten weeks later.

=== Eggs ===

Females lay 200–400 eggs, singly or in small groups, on the underside of leaves of the tree species preferred by the larvae. Egg laying starts the evening after mating is completed and goes on for several days. Eggs hatch in about a week.

=== Larvae ===

Each instar – the period between molts – generally takes about 4–10 days. There are five instars before cocooning. At the end of each instar, a small amount of silk is placed on the major vein of a leaf and the larva undergoes apolysis, then ecdysis (molting), leaving the old exoskeleton behind. Sometimes the shed exoskeleton is eaten. Newly hatched, this caterpillar constantly munches on the leaves of walnut, hickory, sweetgum, and paper birch trees. Each instar is green, though the first two instars do have some variation in which some larvae will have black underlying splotches on their dorsal side. The final instar grows to approximately in length. All five instar stages possess green spines on the dorsal surface. These spines do not sting, but can still cause irritation upon contact. This is a tree-dwelling species. Larvae stay on the same tree where they hatched until it is time to descend to the ground to make a cocoon. When females emerge from cocoons, they fly to preferred tree species, emit pheromones, and wait there for males to find them. Although some larvae in the family Saturniidae are known to be poisonous, those of &quot;A. luna&quot; are not. The spines, or setae, located on the thoracic and abdominal segments have no chemical component to them.

=== Pupae ===

The Luna moth pupates after spinning a silk cocoon, which is thin and single layered. Shortly before pupation, the final, fifth-instar caterpillar will engage in a &quot;gut dump&quot; where any excess water and intestinal contents are expelled. As pupae, this species is more physically active than most moths. When disturbed, the moths will wiggle within their pupal cases, producing a noise. Pupation takes approximately two weeks unless the individual is in diapause over winter, in which case the pupal stage takes about nine months. The mechanisms triggering diapause are generally a mixture of genetic triggers, duration of sunlight and temperature. The pupae have chitinous spurs near the base of the forewings. By vigorously moving about within the cocoon, these spurs tear a circular opening from which the imago emerges, the silk of the cocoon having also been weakened by the secretion of cocoonase, a protein-digesting enzyme.

=== Imago (winged) ===

Pupae transition to winged state after receiving external signals in the form of temperature change. When the adult Luna moths emerge from their pupae, their abdomens are swollen and their wings are small, soft and wet. The first few hours of adult life will be spent pumping hemolymph (invertebrates&#x27; equivalent to blood) from the abdomen into the wings. The moths must wait for the wings to dry and harden before being able to fly. This process can take 2–3 hours to complete. Luna moths are not rare, but are rarely seen due to their very brief (7–10 day) adult lives and nocturnal flying time. As with all giant silk moths, the adults only have vestigial mouthparts and no digestive system and therefore do not eat in their adult form. Instead, they rely on energy stored during their caterpillar stage. In regions where there are two or three generations per year, the second and third may have wing coloration that is more of a yellow-green compared to the first generation of the year.

=== Mating ===

Giant silk moths have in common a mating process wherein the females, at night, release volatile sex pheromones, which the males, flying, detect via their large antennae. Males can detect these molecules at a distance of several miles, and then fly in the direction the wind is coming from until reaching the female. Luna moth females mate with the first males to find them, a process that typically starts after midnight and takes several hours. Researchers extracted three chemical compounds from the pheromone gland of unmated Luna moth females and identified one major and two minor aldehyde compounds designated &quot;E&quot;6,&quot;Z&quot;11-18:Ald, &quot;E&quot;6-18:Ald and &quot;Z&quot;11-18:Ald. The same compounds were also synthesized. Field experiments with both unmated females and the synthesized compounds confirmed that E6, Z11-18:Ald was the major sex pheromone, attraction augmented by the addition of E6-18:Ald but not by Z11-18:Ald. The authors mentioned that no other moth species were attracted to either the unmated females or the synthesized products, confirming that the pheromone is species-specific, at least for the sites and dates where it was tested.

== Predators and parasites ==

Some species of giant silk moth larvae are known to make clicking noises when attacked by rubbing their serrated mandibles together. These clicks are audible to humans and extend into ultrasound frequencies audible to predators. Clicks are thought to be a form of aposematic warning signaling, made prior to predator-deterring regurgitation of intestinal contents. Luna moth larvae click and regurgitate, with the regurgitated material confirmed as being a predator deterrent against several species.

Imagos (winged adults) of this and related night-flying &quot;Actias&quot; species, collectively referred to as &quot;moon moths&quot;, have long hindwing tails. A &quot;false target&quot; hypothesis holds that the tails evolved to reduce predation risk by bats which use echolocation to locate prey. The moths use the spinning hindwing tails to fool bats into attacking nonessential appendages, with success occurring over 55% of the time. Experiments were conducted with Luna moths with intact wings and with the tails removed. With intact wings, a majority of the attacking bats contacted the hindwing tails rather than the body of the moth; only 35% of intact moths were caught versus 81% for those with clipped tails. The results of this experiment support echolocation distortion as an effective countermeasure.

The parasitoid tachinid fly &quot;Compsilura concinnata&quot; native to Europe was deliberately introduced to the United States throughout much of the 20th century as a biological control for the gypsy moth (&quot;Lymantria dispar&quot;) (also known as the &quot;spongy moth&quot;). Researchers reported that when Luna moth larvae were placed outside for about a week and then collected and returned to the laboratory, four parasitic species emerged, the most common being &quot;C. concinnata.&quot; The researchers concluded that this parasitoid fly causes collateral damage to Luna moth populations. 

Luna moth larvae have displayed defenses against predators in late instars by developing spines once they reach about 3 cm in length. Unlike other species such as &quot;Automeris io&quot;, which have chemical defenses much earlier in the larval stage, the Luna moth larvae are left largely defenseless until it reaches this length. However, the absence of a chemical defense allows for the shortening of the larval stage. &quot;Automeris io&quot; has a larval stage at least twice as long on average as &quot;Actias luna&quot;, leaving it vulnerable to parasitism.

== Host plants ==
The larvae of Luna moths feed on several different species of broadleaf trees. The larvae do not reach population densities sufficient to cause significant damage to their host trees. Tuskes listed white birch (&quot;Betula papyrifera&quot;), American persimmon (&quot;Diospyros virginiana&quot;), American sweet gum (&quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot;), plus several species of hickory (&quot;Carya&quot;), walnut (&quot;Juglans&quot;) and sumac (&quot;Rhus&quot;) as host plants for the caterpillars. Other tree species have been identified as suitable for &quot;Actias luna&quot; larvae, but a feeding experiment that also included black cherry, eastern cottonwood, quaking aspen, white willow, red oak, white oak and tulip tree reported very poor survival on these seven tree species even though older literature had identified them as hosts. The author suggested that host plant utilization may differ regionally, so that larvae collected from one region may not tolerate host plants readily consumed in another region (northern populations often lose the ability to digest sweetgum, while southern ones may undergo the same with willows). Biochemical detoxification of host plant defensive chemicals by digestive system enzymes may be a factor in regional host plant specialization. Juglone is a chemical compound common to walnut and hickory which most insects find a deterrent or even toxic. Luna moth larvae have higher concentrations of juglone-neutralizing digestive system enzymes compared to other lepidoptera, and concentrations were even higher when larvae were fed walnut or hickory leaves versus white birch or American sweet gum. This suggests evolutionary and inducible adaptations to allow consumption of certain host plants.

== In popular culture ==
The Luna moth appeared on a first class United States postage stamp issued in June 1987. Although more than two dozen butterflies have been so honored, as of 2019 this is the only moth.

<doc id="345378" wikidata="Q352478" url="?curid=345378" title="Samuel Bellamy">
<text>Captain Samuel Bellamy ( 23 February 1689 – 26 April 1717), later known as &quot;Black Sam&quot; Bellamy, was an English sailor turned pirate during the early 18th century. He is best known as the wealthiest pirate in recorded history, and one of the faces of the Golden Age of Piracy. Though his known career as a pirate captain lasted little more than a year, he and his crew captured at least 53 ships.

Called &quot;Black Sam&quot; in Cape Cod folklore because he eschewed the fashionable powdered wig in favor of tying back his long black hair with a simple band, Bellamy became known for his mercy and generosity toward those he captured on his raids. This reputation earned him another nickname, the &quot;Prince of Pirates&quot;. He likened himself to Robin Hood, with his crew calling themselves &quot;Robin Hood&#x27;s Men&quot;.

Bellamy was born in Devon, England, in 1689, and began sailing for the British Royal Navy as a teenager. After traveling to Cape Cod around 1715, he then went south to the Florida coast in an effort to locate a sunken treasure fleet. From there he made his way to the Bahamas, sailing under Benjamin Hornigold and his second-in-command, Edward &quot;Blackbeard&quot; Teach. After Hornigold and Teach were voted out of command, Bellamy took a captured vessel as his own, before capturing a state-of-the-art slave trade ship, the &quot;Whydah Gally&quot;, in the early spring of 1717. Two months later, the vessel was caught in a nor&#x27;easter storm off the coast of Massachusetts and sank, taking Bellamy and most of his crew down with it. The remains of the &quot;Whydah Gally&quot; were discovered in 1984, making it the first fully authenticated Golden Age pirate ship discovered in North America.

==Early life==
Bellamy was born in 1689 in the parish of Hittisleigh on Dartmoor in Devon, Kingdom of England, the youngest of six known children of Stephen and Elizabeth Bellamy. Elizabeth died soon after, and was buried on 23 February 1689, three weeks before Samuel&#x27;s baptism on 18 March. The future pirate became a sailor at a young age; in his late teens, he joined the Royal Navy and fought in several battles. Though it has been speculated that he may have had a wife and child, there is no definite historical proof of this.

Bellamy traveled to Cape Cod around 1715, allegedly to seek some of his relatives there. According to an abundance of local lore on the subject, it is believed that he took up an affair with a local beauty, Goody Hallett — the &quot;Witch of Wellfleet&quot;. Professor Elizabeth Reynard, in her 1934 book &quot;The Narrow Land&quot;, gave her the name &quot;Maria&quot;, and though there is no evidence of her bearing that name, it has nevertheless become a popular name for her. Other modern authors have called her &quot;Mariah&quot; and &quot;Mary&quot;. Her age and marital status remain subjects of much debate. Some stories depict her as a young lady between 16 and 25, while others depict her as a very old woman. In some stories, her parents liked Bellamy, but did not think a poor self-confident sailor was husband material; circumstantial evidence indicates that she may have already been married, confirming some stories that it was Bellamy&#x27;s intent to seek his fortune and then return, not to marry her, but to take her away.

For whatever reason, he left Cape Cod in early 1716 with a group of men to seek the vast treasures of the 1715 Spanish Treasure Fleet, which had wrecked the previous summer in a hurricane off the east coast of Florida. Wealthy jeweler Palgraves Williams, son of Rhode Island Attorney General John Williams, joined Bellamy and funded their expedition. After Bellamy left the Cape, Hallett was found to be pregnant by Bellamy. It is said that she gave birth to a son and hid the child in a barn for warmth while she foraged for food, and when she returned she found that the child had choked to death on the straw. Some legends say that it was the barn of the notable Knowles family; others claim it was that of Justice Joseph Doane, who had banished Hallett. In either case, she was arrested for the child&#x27;s murder and imprisoned in the Old Jail of Barnstable, Massachusetts (the oldest wooden jail house in the United States; said to be haunted by her). Her sentence was relatively short, but she was exiled from the town. Afterwards, she waited for Bellamy in Eastham.

==Career==

The treasure hunters apparently met with little success, as they soon turned to piracy in the crew of pirate captain Benjamin Hornigold, who commanded the &quot;Marianne&quot; with his first mate, Edward Teach, who would soon gain fame as the pirate &quot;Blackbeard&quot;.

In the summer of 1716, the crew became irritated by Hornigold&#x27;s unwillingness to attack ships of England, his home country. By a majority vote of the crew, Hornigold was deposed as captain of the &quot;Marianne&quot; and left the vessel with his loyal followers, including Teach. The remaining 90-man crew then elected Bellamy as captain.

Upon capturing a second ship, the &quot;Sultana&quot;, it was made into a galley, and with approval of the crew, Bellamy took it as his own and assigned his friend Palsgrave Williams as commander of the &quot;Marianne&quot;. They sailed briefly alongside Olivier Levasseur, who left early in 1717 to raid South America.

Bellamy&#x27;s greatest capture came in the spring of 1717, when he spotted the &quot;Whydah Gally&quot; (pronounced ) sailing through the Windward Passage between Hispaniola and Cuba. Built in England in 1715 as a state-of-the-art, 300-ton, English slave ship with 18 guns, and with speeds of up to , the &quot;Whydah&quot; was on its maiden voyage in 1716 and had just finished the second (Africa to Caribbean) leg of the Atlantic slave trade, loaded with a fortune in gold, indigo, Jesuit&#x27;s bark, ivory and other precious trade goods from the sale of 312 slaves. Bellamy chased the &quot;Whydah&quot; for three days before getting close enough to fire. After a single shot, Captain Lawrence Prince surrendered the &quot;Whydah&quot; by lowering its flag. True to his reputation for generosity, Bellamy rewarded Prince&#x27;s lack of resistance by trading the &quot;Sultana&quot; for the &quot;Whydah&quot;. Removing the captain&#x27;s quarters and upgrading the ship to 28 guns, Bellamy turned his new flagship northwards along the eastern coast of the Carolinas and on to New England.

Captain Charles Johnson (possibly a pseudonym) wrote what became the first standard historical text on pirates, &quot;A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates&quot;. That source relates the story of the &quot;Whydah&quot; overtaking a sloop commanded by Captain Beer. Bellamy had wanted to let the captain keep his ship, but his crew had just voted to burn it, and the captain of the merchant vessel had just declined an invitation to join the pirates. Bellamy is attributed with making this now-famous speech:

Johnson attributes these speeches to &quot;Captain Bellamy&quot; without naming Samuel Bellamy specifically; other writers like Philip Gosse attribute the speeches to Charles Bellamy, a separate pirate unrelated to Samuel Bellamy. They operated at the same time in the same areas and their exploits are often conflated.

==Reputation==

Captain Samuel Bellamy, now known as Black Bellamy, was well known to his contemporaries and chroniclers as a distinctive figure, a tall, strong, well-mannered and very tidy man. He liked expensive clothes, especially black coats. His favorite weapons were four duelling pistols that he always carried in his sash:

As captain, his leadership style was almost democratic. His crew was very fond of him, sometimes even referring to him as &quot;Robin Hood of the Sea&quot; and themselves as &quot;Robin Hood&#x27;s Men&quot;. Captain Bellamy was also a good tactician. Usually, he had two ships under his control. His flagship was powerful with many cannons and the second one was light but fast, which made a good balance. With coordinated attacks, they managed to capture ships easily without harming them.

== Death ==
Just two months after acquiring the &quot;Whydah&quot;, as she and the &quot;Marianne&quot; approached Cape Cod, Williams told Bellamy that he wished to visit his family in Rhode Island, and the two agreed to meet up again near Maine. Bellamy and the &quot;Whydah&quot; captured several other small vessels in the area, including the &quot;Anne Galley&quot;, to which he appointed his quartermaster Richard Noland as captain.

If Bellamy intended to revisit his lover Maria Hallett, he failed. The &quot;Whydah&quot; was swept up in a violent nor&#x27;easter storm off Cape Cod at midnight, on 26 April 1717, and was driven onto the sand bar shoals in of water some from the coast of what is now Wellfleet, Massachusetts. At 15 minutes past midnight, the masts snapped and drew the heavily loaded ship into 30 feet of water, where she capsized and quickly sank, taking Bellamy and all but two of the &quot;Whydah&#x27;s&quot; 146-man crew with her.

104 bodies were known to have washed ashore and were buried by the town coroner, leaving 42 bodies unaccounted for. The &quot;Mary Anne&quot; was also wrecked that night several miles south of the &quot;Whydah&quot;, leaving seven more survivors. All nine survivors from the two ships were captured and prosecuted for piracy in Boston, and six were convicted on 22 October 1717 and hanged on 15 November 1717. (King George&#x27;s pardon of all pirates, issued on 5 September, supposedly arrived in Boston three weeks too late). Two were set free, the court believing their testimony that they had been forced into piracy. The last, a 16-year-old Miskito Indian from Central America, John Julian, was believed to have been sold into slavery to John Quincy, the great-grandfather of U.S. President John Quincy Adams.

Williams waited for Bellamy to rendezvous; when Bellamy never appeared, Williams realized what had happened, and sailed south to Nassau in the &quot;Marianne&quot;. Noland also searched for Bellamy off Maine; failing to find him, he took the &quot;Anne Galley&quot; south, raiding ships along the way before accepting a pardon in the Bahamas.

== Legacy ==
In July 1984, Bellamy became famous again when the discovery of the wreckage of his flagship &quot;Whydah&quot; was announced, and would soon become the first authenticated pirate shipwreck ever discovered in North America. At the time of its sinking, the &quot;Whydah&quot; was the largest pirate prize ever captured, and the treasure in its hold amassed roughly 4.5 to 5 tons, including huge quantities of indigo, ivory, gold, and 20,000 to 30,000 pounds sterling, divided into 180 sacks of each. The discovery of the wreck was made in 1982 by a diving crew led and funded by underwater explorer Barry Clifford.
The vessel was under just of water and of sand.

In 1985, Clifford recovered the ship&#x27;s bell, upon which were the words &quot;THE WHYDAH GALLY 1716&quot;, the first incontrovertible evidence of his find. He subsequently founded The Whydah Pirate Museum on MacMillan Wharf in Provincetown, Massachusetts, which was later moved to West Yarmouth, Massachusetts, dedicated to Bellamy and the &quot;Whydah&quot;. It houses many artifacts which were brought from the wreck, including a cannon found to be stuffed with precious stones, gold and artifacts. A portion of the some 200,000 artifacts so far recovered went on a six-year tour around the United States under the sponsorship of the National Geographic Society. From May 2017 through 30 July 2017, it was at the Portland Science Center in Portland, Maine. In 2022, Real Pirates opened in Salem, Massachusetts, also displaying information about Bellamy, the &quot;Whydah&quot;, and artifacts from the wreck.

Suspected remains of Bellamy were found near the wreck of his ship, in February 2018. The bones were near a pistol identified as his, and DNA tests were carried out with a living relative to confirm. In May 2018, tests confirmed that the bones were of an Eastern European man, though not Bellamy.

In February 2021, Clifford announced six more pirates&#x27; bones were discovered in concretements of debris, and will be tested for DNA matches once they are extracted.

<doc id="345383" wikidata="Q809325" url="?curid=345383" title="Bartholomew Gosnold">
<text>Bartholomew Gosnold ( – ) was an English barrister, explorer and privateer who was instrumental in founding the Virginia Company in London and Jamestown in colonial America. He led the first recorded European expedition to Cape Cod. He is considered by Preservation Virginia (formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities) to be the &quot;prime mover of the colonization of Virginia&quot;.

==Early life and family==
Gosnold was born in Grundisburgh in Suffolk, England, in 1571, and his family seat was at Otley Hall, Otley, Suffolk. His parents were Anthony Gosnold of Grundisburgh and Dorothy Bacon of Hessett. Henry Gosnold, the judge and friend of Francis Bacon, was his cousin. Bartholomew had a younger brother Anthony, born sometime between 1573 and 1578, who accompanied him to Virginia as well as a cousin also named Anthony Gosnold who was still living in Virginia in 1615. In 1578, the will of Bartholomew&#x27;s great-grandmother Ann Doggett (Bacon) Gosnold shows five sisters to Bartholomew and Anthony.

Gosnold graduated from Jesus College at the University of Cambridge and studied law at the Middle Temple. It was probably at Cambridge that he met John Brereton a friend who accompanied him on his 1602 voyage to New England, becoming the first Englishmen to land on that coastline. He was also a friend of Richard Hakluyt and sailed with Walter Raleigh. He married Mary Goldinge, daughter of Robert Goldinge of Bury St Edmunds and his wife Martha Judd, at Latton, Essex, in 1595. Mary&#x27;s mother, Martha, was daughter of Sir Andrew Judd a wealthy London merchant who, among other offices, was Lord Mayor of London, 1550–51. More importantly for Gosnold&#x27;s story, Sir Andrew Judd was also grandfather to Thomas Smith, one of the founders of the Virginia Company. &quot;Bartholomew&#x27;s marriage, which has the appearance of one arranged with foresight, brought together a young man of high standing among the landed gentry and a young lady whose antecedents were found chiefly among the wealthier merchants of the city of London.&quot; Together, Bartholomew and Mary Gosnold had seven children, six of whom were baptized at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, between 1597 and 1607:
* Martha (baptised 24 April 1597-1598)
* Mary (1599-1660) married Richard Pepys, great-uncle of the diarist Samuel Pepys.
* Robert Gosnold (baptised Oct 1600 - 1681) married Trephena Bateman in Kettlebaston, Suffolk in 1627
* Susan Gosnold (baptised 2 August, 1602)
* Bartholomew Gosnold (baptised 16 December, 1603)
* Francisca Gosnold (buried 17 July, 1604)
* Paul Gosnold (baptised 11 December, 1605) Royalist clergyman ejected from Church of St Clare, Bradfield in 1643
* Martha Gosnold (baptised 5 February 1607 -) married John Blemell 20 Aug 1633 in Horningsheath, Suffolk

==Early maritime career==

There is no record of Gosnold&#x27;s early maritime experiences. But, given that he was entrusted with a ship to attempt a colonizing project in southern New England in 1602, he must have had significant experience. His biographer has suggested, based on circumstantial evidence that in 1597–98 he served under the Earl of Essex on his Azores voyages. Many of those involved in that voyage afterwards became involved in the colonization of Virginia.

==Organizing a colonial enterprise==
Gosnold early became a principal proponent of English New World settlement.

In the Elizabethan (and later Stuart) ages, exploration and colonization was a private endeavor. While the crown did not defray any of the expenses of these enterprises, it granted monopolies to an individual or corporation to exploit a particular area that the crown claimed. This made the efforts profit-driven, much like privateering. So a would-be colonizer, like Gosnold, had to raise the capital for the expedition among private sources. As these ventures became more common great corporations would arise, much like the corporations which exploited the trading routes (which the crown also granted monopolies on). Substantial obstacles stood in the way of organizing a commercial colonizing venture to the New World. In the first place, Ireland beckoned as an alternate prospect for colonization, one that was less expensive, at least with respect to shipping expenses. Most of the venture capitalists who were considering New World ventures were also involved in Irish ventures. Thomas Smith&#x27;s son, for example, was involved in the first substantial effort to colonize Ulster (although he was killed early in the endeavour). There was also the substantial financial risk involved in colonizing projects. Sir Walter Raleigh had lost 40 thousand pounds in founding Roanoke colony, and he pledged still more to attempt to find and rescue the lost settlers.

There was, however, a new colonial plan that seemed to have garnered general acceptance since it was written in the mid-1590s. It was in the report written by Edward Hayes to Lord Burghley setting forth the rationale and procedure for settlement. The argument was that colonization efforts should begin in northern Virginia (New England) because compared with the locations tried in the lower latitudes the area&#x27;s climate better comported with English comfort and produced agriculture much like England&#x27;s. The coast of New England also produced a wealth of fish prized in Europe which could support a small foothold establishment and produce a profit with growth provided when more settlers were gradually added later.

==Expedition to Cape Cod and environs==

English plans to colonize New England began to take concrete form in the early to mid-1590s when Edward Hayes wrote a treatise to Lord Burghley setting forth the rationale and procedure for settlement. The first expedition to set out from England to southern New England was fully in accord with Hayes&#x27;s principles.

Captain Gosnold obtained backing to attempt to found an English colony in the New World and in 1602 he sailed from Falmouth, Cornwall, in a small Dartmouth bark, the &quot;Concord&quot;, with thirty-two on board. These included a friend of his John Brereton whom he possibly knew from his days at University of Cambridge as well as Bartholomew Gilbert, and Gabriel Archer. They intended to establish a colony in New England. Gosnold pioneered a direct sailing route due west from the Azores to what later became New England, arriving in May 1602 at Cape Elizabeth in Maine (Lat. 43 degrees).

On 14 May 1602, Gosnold made landfall off the southern coast of Maine. with the purpose of setting up a small fishing outpost of 20 of the crew who would stay the winter. They were there hailed by a &quot;Biscay shallop&quot; containing eight men, who the English discovered were not &quot;Christians&quot; as they had supposed but &quot;savages&quot; of &quot;swart&quot; colour who had many European accoutrements and acted boldly among the English.

The next day, on 15 May 1602, he sailed into Provincetown Harbor, where he is credited with naming Cape Cod, for the abundant fish. The captain explored the land and found a young Native boy, wearing copper ear decorations and an apparent willingness to help the Englishman. Continuing down the Atlantic coast of Cape Cod, pivoting on Gilbert&#x27;s Point, they coasted westward observing numerous Natives on shore, many running after them to gaze.

Following the coastline for several days, he discovered Martha&#x27;s Vineyard which they explored but found seemingly uninhabited. Gosnold named it after his deceased daughter, Martha, and the wild grapes that covered much of the land.

From there they sailed about the various islands now called Elizabeth until they came upon Cuttyhunk Island (which they called Elizabeth Island), where on 20 May they determined to establish the proposed settlement on the western part of the island. They selected the island in the middle of a large freshwater lake in the south of the island for which they made a flat-bottomed boat to transport from the island to larger island that encompassed it. Each time they encountered Natives, whether on their coasting expeditions or Gosnold&#x27;s separate explorations while the others were building the fort, such as his visit to the mainland on 31 May, the Natives showed themselves ready to trade. Indeed, their metal ornaments and their supply of furs to offer show that they had already become acculturated to European ways and they were willing to accommodate. It became, from the Natives&#x27; point of view, the ritual that bonded the two cultures. Gosnold&#x27;s men were interested, however, with the trade that would enrich them and their commercial underwriters in Europe so spent more time tending to the harvesting of sassafras root and cedar wood than daily encounters with the Natives. In fact, they made a conscious effort to prevent the Natives from finding out the location of their fort. It is unclear how the situation developed but by 11 June the relations had become so strained that a party of two Englishmen out hunting for shellfish for food were set upon by four Natives who shot one in the side with an arrow. Shortly thereafter, a dispute arose between those settlers who were supposed to remain and those who were returning to England, which resulted in the decision to end the settlement project. The post was abandoned when settlers decided to return on the ship to England since they feared they had insufficient provisions to carry them through the winter. All of the settlers embarked on the return voyage on 17 June.

Over the next decade settlers would involve themselves in a series of increasingly hostile encounters, and by the time of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; landing the amiable helpfulness that Gosnold first discovered among all the Ninnimissinuok had become open hostility.

==Virginia Company, Jamestown==
Gosnold spent several years after his return to England promoting a more ambitious attempt; he obtained from King James I an exclusive charter for a Virginia Company to settle Virginia. To form the core of what would become the Virginia Colony at Jamestown, he recruited his brother Anthony, a cousin, his cousin-by-marriage Edward Maria Wingfield, as well as John Smith, in addition to members of his 1602 expedition. Gosnold himself served as vice-admiral of the expedition, and captain of the &quot;Godspeed&quot; (one of the three ships of the expedition; the other two being the &quot;Susan Constant&quot;, under Captain Christopher Newport, and the &quot;Discovery&quot;, under Captain John Ratcliffe).

Gosnold also solicited the support of Matthew Scrivener, cousin of Edward Maria Wingfield. Scrivener became Acting Governor of the new Colony, but drowned in an accident in 1609 along with Anthony Gosnold, Bartholomew&#x27;s brother, while trying to cross to Hog Island in a storm. (Scrivener&#x27;s brother Nicholas had also drowned while a student at Eton College).

Gosnold was popular among the colonists and opposed the location of the colony at Jamestown Island due to what he perceived as its unhealthy location; he also helped design the fort that held the initial colony. He died only four months after they landed, on 22 August 1607. George Percy&#x27;s &#x27;Discourse&#x27; that was printed in the fourth volume of &quot;Purchas His Pilgrimes&quot; (1625) records Gosnold&#x27;s death &quot;... Captain Bartholomew Gosnold one of Councile, he was buryed thereupon having all the ordinance in the Fourt shote offwith manye vollyes of small shot ...&quot;

==Discovery of Gosnold&#x27;s possible grave==

In 2003 Preservation Virginia announced that its archaeological dig at Jamestown had discovered the likely location of Gosnold&#x27;s grave. It was also believed that he was buried outside the James day fort. A skeleton the dig found is currently on display at the Voorhees Archaearium at Historic Jamestown. Preservation Virginia began genetic fingerprinting, hoping to verify Gosnold&#x27;s identity in time for the Jamestown quadricentennial. By June 2005 researchers and The Discovery Channel sought permission to take DNA samples from the remains of his sister, Elizabeth Tilney, buried in the Church of All Saints, Shelley, Suffolk, and they were granted the first faculty for such a purpose by the English Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich. They found and removed some bone fragments from the church, but they could not identify Tilney&#x27;s remains and so they were not able to conclude anything from their analysis. In November 2005 Preservation Virginia announced that it had no reason to doubt that Tilney&#x27;s remains were somewhere under the church floor, but its DNA testing had not confirmed a relationship.

<doc id="345384" wikidata="Q471889" url="?curid=345384" title="Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers">
<text>The Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (), or SCAP, was the title held by General Douglas MacArthur during the United States-led Allied occupation of Japan following World War II. It issued SCAP Directives (alias SCAPIN, SCAP Index Number) to the Japanese government, aiming to suppress its &quot;militaristic nationalism&quot;. The position was created at the start of the occupation of Japan on August 14, 1945. It was originally styled the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers.

In Japan, the position was generally referred to as GHQ (General Headquarters), as SCAP also referred to the offices of the occupation (which was officially referred by SCAP itself as ), including a staff of several hundred US civil servants as well as military personnel. Some of these personnel effectively wrote a first draft of the Japanese Constitution, which the National Diet then ratified after a few amendments. Australian, British Empire, and New Zealand forces under SCAP were organized into a sub-command known as British Commonwealth Occupation Force.

These actions led MacArthur to be viewed as the new Imperial force in Japan by many Japanese political and civilian figures, even being considered to be the rebirth of the &quot;shōgun&quot;-style government which Japan was ruled under until the start of the Meiji Restoration. American biographer William Manchester argues that without MacArthur&#x27;s leadership, Japan would not have been able to make the move from an imperial, totalitarian state, to a democracy. At his appointment, MacArthur announced that he sought to &quot;restore security, dignity and self-respect&quot; to the Japanese people.

MacArthur was also in charge of southern Korea from 1945 to 1948 due to the lack of clear orders or initiative from Washington, D.C. There was no plan or guideline given to MacArthur from the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the State Department on how to rule Korea, resulting in a tumultuous 3 year military occupation that led to the creation of the U.S.-friendly Republic of Korea in 1948. He ordered Lieutenant General John R. Hodge, who accepted the surrender of Japanese forces in southern Korea in September 1945, to govern that area on SCAP&#x27;s behalf and report to him in Tokyo.

== General MacArthur ==
SCAP is oftentimes synonymous with its appointed post war leader, American General Douglas MacArthur.

As Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, MacArthur decided not to prosecute Shiro Ishii and all members of the bacteriological research units in exchange for germ warfare data based on human experimentation. On May 6, 1947, he wrote to Washington that &quot;additional data, possibly some statements from Ishii probably can be obtained by informing Japanese involved that information will be retained in intelligence channels and will not be employed as &#x27;War Crimes&#x27; evidence.&quot; The deal was concluded in 1948.

According to historian Herbert Bix in &quot;Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan&quot;, &quot;MacArthur&#x27;s truly extraordinary measures to save the Emperor from trial as a war criminal had a lasting and profoundly distorting impact on Japanese understanding of the lost war.&quot; MacArthur&#x27;s reasoning was that if the emperor were executed or sentenced to life imprisonment there would be a violent backlash and revolution from the Japanese of all social classes, and this would interfere with his primary goal of changing Japan from a militarist, feudal society to a pro-Western modern democracy. In a cable sent to General Dwight Eisenhower in February 1946, MacArthur stated that executing or imprisoning the emperor would require the use of one million occupation soldiers to keep the peace.

=== SCAP&#x27;s relationship with Japanese leadership ===

The relationship between Japanese leadership and SCAP was tense, as SCAP domineered the former on the path to post war reconstruction. MacArthur was focused on the task at hand, shown by his refusal to address the Japanese leadership or public directly, instead electing to go straight to and from his office every day, without stops. 

MacArthur and SCAP were adamant that the Emperor especially be shielded from responsibility for the war. MacArthur allowed the Emperor to issue statements that allowed for post war SCAP policy to be reframed as continued Meiji restoration, allowing the Emperor to cling to legitimacy. These views would be reflected in the first eight articles of the Constitution of Japan.

==Transforming Japan==
A major land reform was conducted, led by Wolf Ladejinsky of MacArthur&#x27;s SCAP staff; however, Ladejinsky himself stated that the true architect of the land reform was , then-Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries from the Japan Socialist Party. Between 1947 and 1949, approximately , or 38% of Japan&#x27;s cultivated land, was purchased from the landlords under the government&#x27;s reform program, and was resold to the farmers who worked them. By 1950, 89% of all agricultural land was owner-operated and only 11% was tenant-operated. MacArthur&#x27;s efforts to encourage trade union membership met with phenomenal success, and by 1947, 48% of the non-agricultural workforce was unionized. Some of MacArthur&#x27;s reforms were rescinded in 1948 when his unilateral control of Japan was ended by the increased involvement of the State Department. During the Occupation, SCAP successfully, if not entirely, abolished many of the financial coalitions known as the Zaibatsu, which had previously monopolized industry. Eventually, looser industrial groupings known as &quot;Keiretsu&quot; evolved. The reforms alarmed many in the U.S. Departments of Defense and State, who believed they conflicted with the prospect of Japan and its industrial capacity as a bulwark against the spread of communism in Asia.

Japan&#x27;s hereditary peerage, called kazoku, that lasted for over a millennium in different but essentially similar forms, was abolished by the new Japanese constitution that was heavily influenced by MacArthur. This was similar to the European peerage system involving princes, barons and counts that were not part of the royal family. Also, the extended royal family, called ōke and shinnōke, was abolished and stripped of all rights and privileges, transforming into commoners immediately. The only Japanese that were allowed to call themselves a part of royalty or nobility after the U.S. occupation were the emperor and about 20 of his direct family members. This action by MacArthur and the writers of the constitution helped transform Japan drastically by abolishing all of the old extended royal family class and the nobility class.

==Welfare programs==
One of the largest of the SCAP programs was Public Health and Welfare, headed by US Army Colonel Crawford F. Sams. Working with the SCAP staff of 150, Sams directed the welfare work of the American doctors, and organized entirely new Japanese medical welfare systems along American lines. The Japanese population was in a poor state: most people were badly worn down, doctors and medicines were very scarce, and sanitary systems had been bombed out in larger cities. Sams&#x27; earliest priorities were in distributing food supplies from the United States. Millions of refugees from the defunct overseas empire were pouring in, often in bad physical shape, with a high risk of introducing smallpox, typhus and cholera. The outbreaks that did occur were localized, as emergency immunization, quarantine, sanitation, and delousing prevented massive epidemics. Sams, who was promoted to Brigadier General in 1948, worked with Japanese officials to establish vaccine laboratories, reorganize hospitals along American lines, upgrade medical and nursing schools, and bring together Japanese, international, and US teams that dealt with disasters, child care, and health insurance. He set up an Institute of Public Health for educating public health workers and a National Institute of Health for research, and set up statistical divisions and data collection systems.

== Constitution ==
One of the most significant actions of SCAP during the occupation was the drafting of a new Japanese constitution. One of MacArthur&#x27;s top priorities was an overhaul of the existing Meiji Constitution, to bring the country in line with its new democratic government. He gave the task of drafting the constitution to his officers, frustrated by the slowness of legislators. They would finish the task within a week, and presenting the new constitution as a wholesale amendment to the Meiji Constitution. It provided protections to the Emperor, placing him at the head of the state. It was ratified in November 1946 and went into effect May 3, 1947.

=== Article 9 ===
The most polarizing aspect of the Japanese constitution, a part that still sees debate to this day, is the presence of Article 9, a clause covering the status of the Japanese military. The clause outlaws belligerency and prohibits the establishment of organized armed forces by the government. Despite this, Japan maintains a &quot;self defense force&quot; (a de facto defensive military) of around 250,000 active personnel. Article 9 and the JSDF are both hotly contested subjects of debates in modern Japanese politics, as pacifists see the JSDF and military involvement in foreign countries as unconstitutional, while nationalists seek Article 9&#x27;s removal and a wider rearmament of Japan.

==War crimes issues==
SCAP arrested 28 suspected war criminals on account of crimes against peace, but it did not conduct the Tokyo Trials; the International Military Tribunal for the Far East was responsible instead. President Harry Truman had negotiated Japanese surrender on the condition the Emperor would not be executed or put on trial. SCAP carried out that policy.

As soon as November 26, 1945, MacArthur confirmed to Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai that the emperor&#x27;s abdication would not be necessary. Before the war crimes trials actually convened, SCAP, the IPS and officials from Hirohito&#x27;s Shōwa government worked behind the scenes not only to prevent the imperial family being indicted, but also to slant the testimony of the defendants to ensure that no one implicated the Emperor. High officials in court circles and the Shōwa government collaborated with Allied GHQ in compiling lists of prospective war criminals, while the individuals arrested as &quot;Class A&quot; suspects and incarcerated in Sugamo Prison solemnly vowed to protect their sovereign against any possible taint of war responsibility.

As Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, MacArthur also decided not to prosecute Shiro Ishii and all members of the bacteriological research units in exchange for germ warfare data based on human experimentation. On May 6, 1947, he wrote to Washington that &quot;additional data, possibly some statements from Ishii probably can be obtained by informing Japanese involved that information will be retained in intelligence channels and will not be employed as &quot;War Crimes&quot; evidence.&quot; The deal was concluded in 1948.

According to historian Herbert Bix in &quot;Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan&quot;, &quot;MacArthur&#x27;s truly extraordinary measures to save the Emperor from trial as a war criminal had a lasting and profoundly distorting impact on Japanese understanding of the lost war.&quot; MacArthur&#x27;s reasoning was if the emperor were executed or sentenced to life imprisonment there would be a violent backlash and revolution from the Japanese from all social classes and this would interfere with his primary goal to change Japan from a militarist, feudal society to a pro-Western modern democracy. In a cable sent to General Dwight Eisenhower in February 1946 MacArthur said executing or imprisoning the emperor would require the use of one million occupation soldiers to keep the peace.

==Media censorship==
Above the political and economic control SCAP had for the seven years following Japan&#x27;s surrender, SCAP also had strict control over all of the Japanese media, under the formation of the Civil Censorship Detachment (CCD) of SCAP. The CCD eventually banned a total of 31 topics from all forms of media. These topics included:

* Criticism of SCAP (individuals and the organization).
* All Allied countries.
* Criticism of Allied policy pre- and post-war.
* Any form of imperial propaganda.
* Defense of war criminals.
* Praise of &quot;undemocratic&quot; forms of government, though praise of SCAP itself was permitted.
* The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
* Black market activities.
* Open discussion of allied diplomatic relations (Soviet Union–United States relations).

Although some of the CCD censorship laws considerably relaxed towards the end of SCAP, some topics, like the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, were taboo until 1952 at the end of the occupation.

== Approach to the Japanese Communist Party and Post-War Reforms ==

MacArthur legalized the Japanese Communist Party despite reservations from the United States government and invited them to take part in the 1946 election, which was also the first ever Japanese election to allow women to vote. He ordered the release of all political prisoners of the Imperial Japanese era, including communist prisoners. MacArthur approved the first May Day parade in 11 years in 1946. On the day before the May Day celebrations, which would involve 300,000 Japanese communists demonstrating with red flags and pro-Marxism chants in front of the Tokyo Imperial Palace and the Dai-Ichi Building, a group of would-be assassins led by Hideo Tokayama that planned to assassinate MacArthur with hand grenades and pistols on May Day was stopped and some of its members arrested. Despite this plot the May Day demonstrations went on. MacArthur stopped the Communist Party from gaining any popularity in Japan by releasing their members from prison, conducting landmark land reform for the rural Japanese farmers and peasants, and allowing the communists to freely participate in elections. In the 1946 election they won only 6 seats.

== Legacy ==
MacArthur handed over power to the Japanese government in 1949, but remained in Japan until relieved by President Harry S. Truman on 11 April 1951, after which he was succeeded as SCAP by General Matthew Ridgway. The San Francisco Peace Treaty, signed on 8 September 1951, marked the end of the Allied occupation, and when it went into effect on 28 April 1952, Japan was once again an independent state. The position of SCAP was effectively abolished on 1 July 1957 with the disbandment of the Far East Command. However, the United States continued to administer some Japanese islands after that with, for example, Okinawa being continually under US administration until 1972. 

=== Active US military presence ===

All branches of the United States military forces are still present in Japan today. They primarily function in a support role, providing defense for Japan and the surrounding region, per the agreements of the US-Japan Mutual Security Treaty. The United States Forces Japan consists of around 50,000 service members deployed all over Japan to protect Japanese and US interests alike. This has led to tension at times between Japanese citizens and American servicemen, with incidents frequently occurring between locals and servicemen and crimes frequently committed by servicemen against locals, such as the 1995 Okinawa rape incident. These incidents led to plans to relocate military bases in Okinawa, namely Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, as three quarters of all USFJ installations are located in the prefecture, despite its small size. However, the plan has been delayed due to protests at the site designated for its relocation on another part of the island.

<text>Sipoo (; ) is a municipality of Finland. It is part of the Helsinki metropolitan area. The municipality has a population of 
() and covers an area of of
which 
is water. The population density is
. The administrative center of the municipality is Nikkilä (), which is located northeast of the center of Helsinki. Another significant urban area is Söderkulla, located in the southern part of the municipality.

Sipoo is a bilingual municipality with Finnish and Swedish as its official languages. The population consists of Finnish speakers, Swedish speakers, and speakers of other languages.

The coat of arms of the municipality refers to the origin story of the settlement, according to which the ancestors of Sipoo are said to have arrived in the region on a viking ship, the bow of which was decorated with a head of wolf; accordingly, locals have even been called the “wolves of Sipoo”. The wave lined fess of the coat of arms refers to the Sipoo River.

== Geography ==

It is the eastern neighbour of Helsinki and western neighbour of Porvoo, located in the Uusimaa region. Other neighboring municipalities are Vantaa, Kerava, Tuusula, Järvenpää, Mäntsälä and Pornainen. There are two important road connections in the direction of Helsinki from Sipoo: Highway 7, known as the Porvoo Highway (part of E18), and Road 170, which is known as the Itäväylä on the Helsinki side.

The once almost completely Swedish-speaking municipality is bilingual since 1953, a majority being Finnish speakers, due to migration from other parts of Finland since 2003. Today the Finnish-speaking majority stands at and the Swedish-speaking minority comprises about of the population.

On June 26, 2006, the Sipoo town council decided on a strategy to triple the municipality&#x27;s population over the next 25 years. The decision was made after Helsinki announced plans to annex a part of the municipality in order to continue to build high-end urbanizations by the coastline (and thus high-tax revenue producing). The Finnish Council of State voted in favor of the annexation on June 28, 2007, with an 8 to 4 vote. Sipoo appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court, but the court upheld the decision of the Council of State and the annexation took place on January 1, 2009.
As Helsinki did not directly border Sipoo at any point, the city of Vantaa ceded the area lain between Helsinki and Sipoo to Helsinki in the process.

<text>The Grand Banks of Newfoundland are a series of underwater plateaus south-east of the island of Newfoundland on the North American continental shelf. The Grand Banks are one of the world&#x27;s richest fishing grounds, supporting Atlantic cod, swordfish, haddock and capelin, as well as shellfish, seabirds and sea mammals.

==Significance==
The Grand Banks of Newfoundland are a group of underwater plateaus south-east of Newfoundland on the North American continental shelf. These areas are relatively shallow, ranging from in depth. The cold Labrador Current mixes with the warm waters of the Gulf Stream here, often causing extreme foggy conditions.

The mixing of these waters and the shape of the ocean bottom lifts nutrients to the surface. These conditions helped to create one of the richest fishing grounds in the world. Fish species include Atlantic cod, swordfish, haddock and capelin; shellfish include scallop and lobster. The area also supports large colonies of seabirds such as northern gannets, shearwaters and sea ducks and various sea mammals such as seals, dolphins and whales.

Overfishing in the late 20th century caused the collapse of several species, particularly cod, leading to the closure of the Canadian Grand Banks fishery in 1992.

==History==
Extensive glaciation took place in the area of the Grand Banks during the last glacial maximum. By approximately 13,000 years ago the majority of the ice had melted, leaving the Grand Banks exposed as several islands extending for hundreds of kilometres. It is believed that rising sea levels submerged these around 8,000 years ago.
While no archaeological evidence for a European presence near the Grand Banks survives from the period between the short-lived Greenland Norse settlement at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows in 1000 CE and John Cabot&#x27;s transatlantic crossing in 1497, some evidence suggests that voyagers from the Basque Region and England (specifically from Bristol) and others preceded Cabot. In the 15th century some texts refer to a land called &quot;Bacalao&quot;, the land of the codfish, which is possibly Newfoundland. Within a few years of Cabot&#x27;s voyage the existence of fishing grounds on the Grand Banks became generally known in Europe. Ships from France and Portugal pioneered fishing there, followed by vessels from Spain, while ships from England were scarce in the early years. This soon changed, especially after Bernard Drake&#x27;s Newfoundland Expedition in 1585, which virtually wiped out the Spanish and Portuguese fishing-industries in this area. The fish stocks became important for the early European-settler economies of eastern Canada and New England.

On 18 November 1929, the 1929 Grand Banks earthquake struck the southwestern part of the Grand Banks bordering the Laurentian Channel, causing an underwater landslide which resulted in extensive damage to transatlantic cables and generated a rare Atlantic tsunami that struck the south coast of Newfoundland, claiming 29 lives on the Burin Peninsula.

Technological advances in fishing (such as using large factory-ships and sonar), as well as geopolitical disputes over territorial sea and exclusive economic zone (EEZ) boundaries, led to overfishing and a serious decline in the fish stocks of the Grand Banks from around 1990. The Canadian Grand Banks fishery was closed in 1993.

Canada&#x27;s EEZ covers the majority of the Grand Banks except for the lucrative &quot;nose&quot; (eastern extremity, near the Flemish Cap) and &quot;tail&quot; (southern extremity) of the fishing bank. The 1783 Treaty of Paris gave the United States shared rights to fish in these waters, but that section of the Treaty is no longer in force. The exclusive economic zone of the French territory Saint Pierre and Miquelon occupies a pin-shaped section at the west edge of the Grand Banks, with the radius head of the pin surrounding the islands and the needle heading south for .

==Geological research==
Canada is performing the hydrographic and geological surveys necessary for claiming the entire continental shelf off eastern Canada, as allowed by the terms of the latest United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

Petroleum reserves have also been discovered and a number of oil fields are under development in this region, most notably the Hibernia, Terra Nova, and White Rose projects. However, the harsh environment on the Grand Banks also led to the &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; disaster.

== Climate change ==
The Northwest Atlantic Ocean is undergoing long-term warming from climate change. The surface water temperatures of the Newfoundland Shelf have increased by 0.13 °C per decade from 1950 to 2016. Depth-averaged ocean temperatures (0–175 m) have not shown a warming trend during that same period.

==Culture==
Semi-fictional depictions of fishermen working on the Grand Banks can be found in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s novel &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; (1897) and in Sebastian Junger&#x27;s non-fiction book &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; (1997). The Grand Banks are also portrayed in the 1990 film &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;. Herman Melville described passing through the Banks as a young sailor on his first voyage in his autobiographical novel &quot;Redburn: His First Voyage&quot; (1849), where he saw whales and a haunting shipwreck with weeks-dead sailors still on board. It is also featured in &quot;The Grey Seas Under&quot;, a non-fiction book by Canadian author Farley Mowat about the ocean-going maritime salvage tug &quot;Foundation Franklin&quot;.

The Canadian patriotic song &quot;Something to Sing About&quot; opens with the line &quot;I have walked &#x27;cross the sand on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland.&quot; However, as the banks are underwater, it is impossible to walk across them in reality.

<doc id="345400" wikidata="Q1143206" url="?curid=345400" title="Dark Age of Camelot">
<text>Dark Age of Camelot is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game released in October 2001 in North America, and in January 2002 in Europe. The game combines Arthurian lore, Norse mythology, and Celtic mythology with high fantasy. It is set in the period after King Arthur&#x27;s death, when his kingdom has split into three realms, which are in a constant state of war with each other. &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot; includes both player versus environment (PvE) and realm versus realm (RvR) combat.

Developed by Mythic Entertainment, the game is in large part an adaptation of a previous text-based game &quot;Darkness Falls: The Crusade&quot; (1999). The development of &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot; was later transferred from Mythic Entertainment to Broadsword Online Games, a newly established studio, which also subsequently took over development of Mythic&#x27;s other MMO game, &quot;Ultima Online&quot;. Mythic was shut down in May 2014.

As of 2019, a new &quot;progression&quot; server was revealed to be in development, which is said to be limited to the content from the original release, the &quot;Shrouded Isles&quot; expansion, and the housing zone additions. With regard to &quot;Old Frontiers&quot; returning to the game, the development team plans to poll the community for their preference.

==Gameplay==

The character is controlled by either the mouse or keyboard. The player can customize up to three &quot;Quickbars&quot; of 10 slots each with spells, melee or ranged attacks (depending on the equipped weapon), or macros, which can be either clicked on or selected with the number keys to activate. &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot; class system is balanced at the RvR level instead of in direct comparison to the other realms&#x27; equivalent classes. &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot; classes are very rigid with specific roles, play styles, and specialization point allocations.

Guilds offer social, economic, and PvE/PvP advantages that contrast with or exceed those of soloing and &quot;pick-up groups&quot;. Each guild comes with its own chat channel, in-game ranking system, territory claiming ability, guild banking system, guild housing, emblem, and reward system in the form of guild bounty points and merit points. Guild leaders can define their own set of rules and goals, and can customize the privileges (such as inviting new members, speaking in alliance chat, and claiming captured towers for the guild) of each Rank within the guild. Furthermore, alliances can be formed between player guilds, permitting them to create a shared chat channel for all guilds within the alliance to communicate.

Realm versus Realm gameplay is the main focus of &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot;. The storyline revolves around what happens after the death of King Arthur and the fragmentation of his former kingdom. Albion, Hibernia, and Midgard are in a three-way war against each other and constantly war for control of powerful relics, keeps, and towers, as well as control of the entrance to Darkness Falls.

=== Realms ===
&quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot; has three realms, allowing a unique dynamic of RvRvR gameplay. Each of the three realms is inspired by historical folklore and mythology:

* Albion is the Realm of knights and damsels, based on Arthurian mythology. Notable classes include the Wizard, the Paladin, and the Infiltrator. Areas of interest in Albion include Avalon Marsh and Stonehenge, which is located in the Salisbury Plains. Camelot is Albion&#x27;s capital.
* Hibernia is the land of forest and magic, based on Celtic folklore. Notable classes include the Enchanter, the Champion, and the Ranger. Areas of interest include the Valley of Bri Leith, Lough Gur, and Connacht. Tir Na Nog is Hibernia&#x27;s capital. 
* Midgard is the land of the trolls and giants, based on Norse mythology. Notable classes include the Runemaster, the Berserker, and the Hunter. Areas of interest include Myrkwood Forest, the Vanern Swamp, and Muspelheim. Jordheim is Midgard&#x27;s capital.

== Storyline ==

Each realm has a unique but parallel storyline, which is expanded with retail expansions. In the original Realm zones, smaller cities need protection against monsters. Albion is menaced by undead raised by Morgana, Hibernia is torn apart by the Unseelie Court and Siabra, and Midgard by the treacherous Blodfelag.

* &quot;Shrouded Isles&quot; - each realm is called to assist a smaller allied realm against a large enemy. In Albion, the Drakoran have besieged the final strongholds of Lady Lile&#x27;s Avalonians. Hibernia has come to the aid of Hybrasil, where the Sylvans face extinction at the hands of the Fomorians. Midgard&#x27;s ancestral home at Aegir has seen the Last of the Troll Fathers hunted down by the Morvalt.
* &quot;Trials of Atlantis&quot; - the ruins of Atlantis have been discovered, as well as a portal to another Plane where the ancient Atlanteans underwent their trials. The Trials remain in a form twisted by the passage of time and the departure of the denizens of Atlantis. Ancient artifacts wait to be discovered and have their power and secrets revealed by learned scholars. Familiar figures from Greek and Egyptian mythology make their appearance in a new land waiting to be discovered.
* &quot;Catacombs&quot; - a nemesis has taken control of the power within the Darkspire, gaining control of most of the denizens of an underground realm&#x27;s race. Arawn, previously referenced as an ally of the Avalonians and patron of the Inconnu, has had his realm overrun by revolting dead and enslaved Inconnu. The Shar are only able to hold their ground at the gates of their Otherworld citadel. The Kobolds have been forced to open the secrets of the undercity to outsiders in a desperate bid for survival.
* &quot;Darkness Rising&quot; - the King of the realm has returned to fight back a growing rebellion. Further investigations reveal a conspiracy with a dark power behind the rebellion. To become a Champion of the Realm the player must defeat the demonic evil behind the unrest and return peace to the land.
* &quot;Labyrinth of the Minotaur&quot; - the ancient race of Minotaur has returned to the lands of Albion, Midgard, and Hibernia to reclaim powerful but corrupt relics hidden long ago by their ancestors. Lust for these relics once brought about the downfall of the powerful Minotaur kingdom and their evil influence now threatens the kingdoms of Man.

==Development==

The decision to develop &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot; was made in late 1999, with it originally being conceived of as a graphical MUD. Mythic Entertainment president Mark Jacobs proposed the idea of using Arthurian legend since it was on the public domain and thus the company would be free of any licensing issues. Total development costs excluding equipment leases was about US$2.5 million and took 18 months with a team of 25 full-time developers. 3DS Max and Character Studio were used to create all models and animations within the game.

Toward the end of development, Mythic found itself in a difficult financial situation: since it had never borrowed money, it lacked a credit rating sufficient to lease the Dell servers needed to run the game. After being denied the lease by Dell, Mythic had to purchase each server using its development funds. Securing a publisher was also a difficult task; every publisher that Mythic initially approached rejected the game except for one, Vivendi Games. In 2014, Jacobs still expressed gratitude to Vivendi for taking a chance on the studio.

During the game&#x27;s prime, Mythic operated 120 dual-processor Pentium servers running Linux. Out of those, groups of six servers were devoted to running one world, or as the player saw it, one server. The servers were designed to handle 20,000 players simultaneously logged in at any given time, but Mythic limited them to about 4,000 each in order to keep the world from feeling too cluttered. Much of the game&#x27;s code was also stored on the servers, with the user client more focused on graphics and texture loading based on a data stream limited to 10 kbit/s per player.

Broadsword Games later released &quot;Dark Age of Camelot: Endless Conquest&quot;, a non-subscription style game account allowing players to play the game for free, with some restrictions on how many characters the player can have, character classes, as well as some services within the game. Their timeline originally placed release in fall of 2018, but &quot;unforeseen issues and technological constraints&quot; with the v1.125 patch has forced them to delay the release until early 2019. The user&#x27;s prior accounts are eligible for Endless Conquest as well as new accounts.

===Expansions===
Mythic has produced seven expansions (which originally had to be bought separately, but are now free downloads) for &quot;DAoC&quot;. The expansions were not released on European servers (run by GOA), until typically months after the Mythic release.

:&quot;Note: A patch is mentioned in this list due to its impact on one of the expansions. Also, all expansions are now included free as part of the main client download&quot;.

* Shrouded Isles (&quot;SI&quot;) (November 12, 2002; February 21, 2003 in Europe) - added 6 new classes (Necromancer, Reaver; Savage, Bonedancer; Valewalker, Animist), 3 races (Inconnu, Valkyn, Sylvan) and a brand new land for each realm near the size of the old world (in addition to the old world), which also includes epic dungeons. This expansion pack is now a free download. &quot;GameSpot&quot; presented &quot;Shrouded Isles&quot; with its annual &quot;Best Expansion Pack on PC&quot; award.
* Foundations (&quot;Housing&quot;, June 18, 2003) - free expansion which added player housing and consignment merchants (the ability for players to set up a shop and sell in-game items, whether crafted or loot from monsters). Players are able to purchase four different sizes of houses (cottage, house, villa and mansion) and decorate them as they please. Houses also provided players with an easy way to store and transfer items between characters on the same account and realm.
* Trials of Atlantis (&quot;ToA&quot;, October 28, 2003; February 27, 2004 in Europe) - added 3 new races (Half-Ogre, Frostalf, Shar) and high level content and zones (which are the same for each realm), and new terrain graphics for all areas of the game (including trees). A notable general feature introduced with this expansion was the ability to actually dive and explore underwater as opposed to simply swimming across the surface. This expansion pack is now a free download. The expansion featured items known as artifacts, and extra abilities known as &quot;Master Levels&quot;. Artifacts, obtained through hidden encounters, only become useful when the player finds the three scrolls hoarded by Atlantean monsters. Furthermore, artifacts must gain experience in order to reach their full potential.
* New Frontiers (&quot;NF&quot;, June 22, 2004; November 11, 2004 in Europe) - remake of the game&#x27;s realm vs. realm warfare (free, required expansion). This included making the entire frontiers one zone (instead of each realm&#x27;s frontier being separated), redesigning keeps and adding towers, and adding numerous types of siege apparatus.
* Catacombs (&quot;Cata&quot;, December 7, 2004; April 1, 2005 in Europe) - added 5 new classes (Heretic; Vampiir, Bainshee; Warlock, Valkyrie), instanced dungeons (where players entering certain areas get their own private dungeon to hunt in), and new zones and quests with an emphasis on faster and easier leveling. It also includes new player model graphics and new graphics for all the games&#x27; dungeons (except Darkness Falls). The players may now download and venture into the depths of the Catacombs for free. This expansion can be downloaded via the website for no extra charge.
* Darkness Rising (&quot;DR&quot;, October 11, 2005; February 2006 in Europe) - the expansion introduced Champion weapons (much like epic armor), player mounts (horses), Champion Levels and subclassing (small abilities from another class), new dungeons and instanced zones for the new Champion Quests and new graphics for the game world&#x27;s models (such as barns, haystacks and forts, including the Darkness Falls dungeon and the capital cities) which are following the design ideas presented in Mythic&#x27;s new graphics for the starting cities. &quot;Darkness Rising&quot; was also the first paid expansion for &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot; able to be downloaded. A trailer has been created by GOA to showcase this expansion. Mythic also introduced a new island, called Agramon, which acts as a central island that connected the frontiers of the three realms. Unlike the rest of the Frontiers zones, there are no keeps and any player from any realm can open the gates that border the island.
* Labyrinth of the Minotaur (&quot;LotM&quot;, November 5, 2006; February 14, 2007 in Europe) - features include a new race (The Minotaur, 3 types, one for each realm), a new hybrid class (The Mauler), a new RvR dungeon, Mythrians, and additional Champion Levels (6-10). The pack introduced the largest RVR dungeon in Camelot history (Labyrinth) with access by all three realms located on Agramon Island. Labyrinth introduced mythrians a new item slot, and when equipped these myths will give small bonuses to character. This allowed players to increase the stat caps of the item&#x27;s respective attribute. Until this expansion, Mythic had never given each of the three realms the same class.
* &quot;New&quot; New Frontiers (&quot;NNF&quot;, September 5, 2007) - while officially a patch and not an expansion, there were significant changes to the layout of keeps and towers as well as a revamp of the Siegecraft line (including the addition of siege towers and tents) in patch 1.90. The playerbase refers to this patch as the &quot;New, New Frontiers&quot;.

==Reception==
===Sales===
Before the release of &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot;, Mythic Entertainment forecast &quot;30,000 players on launch in the United States&quot;, according to &quot;GameSpy&quot;. In that country, the title entered NPD Intelect&#x27;s weekly computer game sales rankings in first place for October 7–13, 2001. Its initial shipment sold out within one day. Its sales reached 51,000 units within four days of release. &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot; remained at #1 for the week ending on October 20, but fell to third and fifth in the following two weeks, respectively. The game claimed first place on NPD&#x27;s monthly chart for October 2001. After a ninth-place finish for the week ending on November 10, it was absent from NPD&#x27;s weekly top 10 and monthly top 20.

By the first week of November, &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot; had sold 115,894 units in the United States. Remarking on this performance, &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s writer Desslock explained that the game had &quot;sold extremely well during the first few weeks of its release&quot;, and considered to be larger success than the other massively multiplayer RPG released that year, &quot;Anarchy Online&quot;. He cited its performance as evidence that &quot;there&#x27;s probably never been a larger demand for RPGs&quot;. &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot;″s sales in the United States reached 300,000 copies, for revenues of $10.4 million, by August 2006. At the time, this led &quot;Edge&quot; to declare it the country&#x27;s 63rd-best-selling computer game released since January 2000. The &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot; franchise, including its expansion packs, totaled sales of 780,000 units in the United States by 2006.

The game was also a hit in Europe, where it sold above 100,000 units by March 2003.

===Reviews and awards===
During the 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences (AIAS) honored &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot; with the &quot;Massive Multiplayer/Persistent World&quot; award; it also received nominations for the &quot;Computer Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Innovation in Computer Gaming&quot;, and &quot;Game Design&quot; awards. At the following year&#x27;s awards ceremony, AIAS nominated the expansion &quot;Shrouded Isles&quot; for &quot;Massive Multiplayer/Persistent World Game of the Year&quot;, which was ultimately awarded to &quot;The Sims Online&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 2012, a Kickstarter campaign to develop &quot;Camelot Unchained&quot; came about, designed by Mark Jacobs.

=== Uthgard===
The longest living freeshard. Features:
* Old Frontier
* Old Realm abilities
* Patchlevel 1.65 (after SI release, before TOA release)

<doc id="345403" wikidata="Q2708134" url="?curid=345403" title="Texas Instruments SN76489">
<text>The Texas Instruments SN76489 is a programmable sound generator chip from the 1980s, used to create music and sound effects on computers and video game systems. Initially developed by Texas Instruments for its TI-99/4A home computer, it was later updated and widely adopted in systems like the BBC Micro, ColecoVision, IBM PCjr, Sega&#x27;s Master System and Game Gear, and the Tandy 1000. Competing with the General Instrument AY-3-8910, the SN76489 offered three tone generators for musical notes and a noise generator for sound effects like static and explosions, all with adjustable frequencies and volume levels.

==Overview==
The SN76489 was originally designed to be used in the TI-99/4 computer, where it was first called the TMS9919 and later SN94624, and had a 500 kHz max clock input rate. Later, when it was sold outside of TI, it was renamed the SN76489, and a divide-by-8 was added to its clock input, increasing the max clock input rate to , to facilitate sharing a crystal for both NTSC colorburst and clocking the sound chip. A version of the chip without the divide-by-8 input was also sold outside of TI as the SN76494, which has a max clock input rate.

It contains:
* 3 square wave tone generators
** A wide range of frequencies
** 16 different volume levels
* 1 noise generator
** 2 types (white noise and periodic)
** 3 different frequencies
** 16 different volume levels

===Tone Generators===
The frequency of the square waves produced by the tone generators on each channel is derived from two factors:

# The speed of the external clock
# A 10-bit value provided in a control register for that channel (called N)

Each channel&#x27;s frequency is arrived at by dividing the external clock by 4 (or 32 depending on the chip variant), and then dividing the result by N. Thus the overall divider range is from 4 to 4096 (or 32 to 32768). At maximum clock input rate, this gives a frequency range of 122 Hz to 125 kHz. Or typically 108 Hz to 111.6 kHz, with an NTSC colorburst (~3.58 MHz) clock input – a range from roughly A2 (two octaves below middle A) to 5–6 times the generally accepted limits of human audio perception.

===Noise Generator===
The pseudorandom noise feedback is generated from an XNOR of bits 12 and 13 for feedback, with bit 13 being the noise output. The pseudorandom generator is cleared to 0s (with the feedback bit set to 1) on writes to chip register 6, the noise mode register.

==Product family==

There are two versions of the SN76489: the SN76489 (Narrow DIP version labeled SN76489N) and the SN76489A (Narrow DIP version labeled SN76489AN). The former was made around 1980–1982 and the latter from 1983 onward. They differ in that the output of the SN76489 is the inverse of the expected waveform (the waveform &quot;grows&quot; towards 0 V from 2.5 V), while the SN76489A waveform is not inverted.

The SN76496 seems to be totally identical to the SN76489A in terms of the outputs produced, but features an &quot;AUDIO IN&quot; pin (on pin 9) for integrated audio mixing.

==Clones and successors==

Sega used real SN76489AN chips in their SG-1000 game console and SC-3000 computer, but used SN76489A clones in their Master System, Game Gear, and Sega Genesis game consoles. These modified sound chips were incorporated into the systems&#x27; video display processor (VDP). Although basic functionality is almost identical to that of the original SN76489A, a few small differences exist:
* The randomness for the noise channel is generated differently.
* The Game Gear&#x27;s version includes an additional flag register that designates which speaker(s) each audio channel are output (left, right, or both).
* The periodic noise is 16 stages long rather than 15; this makes a significant difference for music/programs which use periodic noise, as sounds will play at 6.25% lower pitch than on the TI-made chips.

Another clone is the NCR 8496, used in some models of the Tandy 1000 computer. Later Tandy 1000 machines (notably the SL, TL and RL series) integrated the SN76496&#x27;s functionality into the PSSJ ASIC.

==Usage==
===Arcade video games===
* These games share a common board design by Tehkan with three of the functionally identical SN76496:
** &quot;Baluba-Louk No Densetsu&quot;
** &quot;Senjyo&quot;
** &quot;Star Force&quot;
* These games share a common board design by Universal Entertainment Corporation:
** &quot;Lady Bug&quot; (uses 2)
** &quot;Mr. Do!&quot; (uses 2 of a functionally-identical part labeled U8106)
** &quot;Mr. Do&#x27;s Castle&quot; (uses 4)
** &quot;Mr. Do&#x27;s Wild Ride&quot; (uses 4)
** &quot;Do! Run Run&quot; (uses 4)
* From Konami:
**&quot;Mikie&quot;
**&quot;Road Fighter&quot;
**&quot;Rush&#x27;n Attack&quot;

<text>Federal elections were held in Switzerland on 19 October 2003. Although in Switzerland&#x27;s political system, in which all four major parties form a coalition, it is very difficult to achieve a change of government, this election produced an upset with the strong showing of the right-wing, anti-European Union and anti-immigration Swiss People&#x27;s Party. The left-wing parties, the Social Democrats and the Greens, also improved their positions. The losers were the parties of the centre and centre-right, the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party and the Free Democratic Party.

In the aftermath of the elections Ruth Metzler-Arnold, one of the two Christian Democrats in the Federal Council was replaced by Christoph Blocher, the most influential politician in the Swiss People&#x27;s Party.

==Electoral system==
Switzerland has a bicameral legislature, the Federal Assembly (Assemblée Fédérale / Bundesversammlung / Asamblea Federale / Assemblea Federala).
*The National Council (Conseil National / Nationalrat / Consiglio Nazionale / Cussegl Naziunal) has 200 members, elected for four-year terms by proportional representation in multi-member constituencies corresponding to the 26 Swiss cantons and half-cantons.
*The Council of States (Conseil des Etats / Ständerat / Consiglio degli Stati / Cussegl dals Stadis) has 46 members elected for four-year terms from multi-member and single-member constituencies.

These elections were to the National Council and for most of the members of the Council of States.

All parties in Switzerland have different names in French, German and Italian, and conduct separate campaigns in the different language areas.

<doc id="345407" wikidata="Q7437858" url="?curid=345407" title="Scottish Militant Labour">
<text>Scottish Militant Labour (SML) was a Trotskyist political party operating in Scotland for most of the 1990s and was part of the Committee for a Workers&#x27; International. It later became known as the International Socialist Movement, which has since dissolved.

It was formed when Militant (also known as the Militant tendency) split after abandoning entryist tactics in the Labour Party. Its best known member was Tommy Sheridan, although Alan McCombes played an important role behind the scenes. The party had six councillors in Glasgow between 1993 and 1995.

In 1998, the &quot;Scottish Socialist Voice&quot; announced that the SML executive had decided to support Scottish independence.

In 1996, it led the formation of the Scottish Socialist Alliance, the precursor of the modern Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) formed in 1998. As part of the SSA and SSP it changed its name to the International Socialist Movement. Many of its leading members were leading members of the SSP. A split occurred after years of debate centred on questions such as what the SSP should be, what the nature of a revolutionary party is and the relationship of the ISM to the CWI. The majority of ISM members broke with the CWI while a minority stayed part of the CWI and created the International Socialists (Scotland), which claimed to be the successor of SML.

Tommy Sheridan was co-convenor of Solidarity (Scotland), and the International Socialists were a platform within it.

<doc id="345410" wikidata="Q422873" url="?curid=345410" title="Fox sparrow">
<text>The fox sparrow (&quot;Passerella iliaca&quot;) is a large New World sparrow. It is the only member of the genus Passerella, although some authors split the species into four (see below).

==Taxonomy==

More specific information regarding plumage is available in the accounts for the various taxa.
*Red fox sparrow, &quot;P. i. iliaca&quot; – this taxon breeds in the taiga of Canada and Alaska and winters in central and eastern North America. This is the brightest colored group.
*Sooty fox sparrow, &quot;P. i. unalaschcensis&quot; – this taxon breeds along the Pacific coast of North America from the Aleutian Islands south to northwestern Washington, and winters from southeastern Alaska south to northern Baja California. It is browner and darker than the red fox sparrow.
*Slate-colored fox sparrow, &quot;P. i. schistacea&quot; – this taxon breeds in interior western North America and winters to the south and west. It has a gray head and mantle, brown wings, brown breast streaks, and a russet tail.
*Thick-billed fox sparrow, &quot;P. i. megarhyncha&quot; – this taxon is mostly restricted to California and Oregon. This group is similar in coloration to the slate-colored fox sparrow, but features a particularly thick bill, as its name suggests.

==Description==
Adults are among the largest sparrows, heavily spotted and streaked underneath. All feature a messy central breast spot though it is less noticeable on the thick billed and slate-colored varieties. Plumage varies markedly from one group to another.

Measurements:

* Length: 5.9–7.5 in (15–19 cm)
* Weight: 0.9–1.6 oz (26–44 g)
* Wingspan: 10.5–11.4 in (26.7–29 cm)

==Behavior==
Fox sparrows are a generally common bird within their range. They forage by scratching the ground which makes them vulnerable to cats and other predators. Most populations of Fox sparrows migrate north for breeding, however some stable populations exist along the west coast of North America.

===Diet===
They mainly eat seeds and insects, as well as some berries. Coastal fox sparrows may also eat crustaceans.

===Reproduction===
Fox sparrows nest in wooded areas across northern Canada and western North America from Alaska to California. They nest either in a sheltered location on the ground or low in trees or shrubs. A nest typically contains two to five pale green to greenish white eggs speckled with reddish brown.

==Systematics==

The review by Zink &amp; Weckstein (2003), which added mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot;, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 and 3, and D-loop sequence, confirmed the four &quot;subspecies groups&quot; of the fox sparrow that were outlined by the initial limited mtDNA haplotype comparison (Zink 1994). These should probably be recognized as separate species, but this was deferred for further analysis of hybridization. Particularly the contact zones between the slate-colored and thick-billed fox sparrows which are only weakly distinct morphologically were of interest; the other groups were found to be distinct far earlier. A further study of the nuclear genome, using microsatellites, showed similar separation between the four groups.

The combined molecular data is unable to resolve the interrelationship of the subspecies groups and of the subspecies in these, but aids in confirming the distinctness of the thick-billed group. Biogeography indicates that the coastal populations were probably isolated during an epoch of glaciation of the Rocky Mountains range, but this is also not very helpful in resolving the remaining problems of within-group diversity, and inter-group relationships.

Major taxonomic authorities currently differ in their treatment of the fox sparrow complex. The IOC World Bird List/&quot;Birds of the World: Recommended English Names&quot; and the &quot;HBW and BirdLife International Illustrated Checklist of the Birds of the World&quot; treat each of the four subspecies groups as a separate species, while eBird/&quot;The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World&quot; and &quot;The Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World&quot; currently treat the complex as a single species.

<text>The Index of Economic Freedom is an annual index and ranking created in 1995 by The Heritage Foundation and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; to measure the degree of economic freedom in the world&#x27;s nations. The creators of the index assert that they take an approach inspired by Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, that &quot;basic institutions that protect the liberty of individuals to pursue their own economic interests result in greater prosperity for the larger society&quot;.

==Purpose==

The Heritage Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot; states that, &quot;Economic freedom is the fundamental right of every human to control his or her own labor and property. In an economically free society, individuals are free to work, produce, consume, and invest in any way they please. In economically free societies, governments allow labor, capital, and goods to move freely, and refrain from coercion or constraint of liberty beyond the extent necessary to protect and maintain liberty itself.&quot; By publishing the &quot;Index&quot; annually, the foundation attempts to highlight where such freedoms do and do not exist.

The Heritage Foundation reports that the top 20% on the &quot;Index&quot; have twice the per capita income of those in the second quintile, and five times that of the bottom 20%. 

Carl Schramm, who wrote the first chapter of the 2008 &quot;Index&quot;, states that cities of Medieval Italy and those of the mid-19th century Midwestern United States both flourished proportionate to their possessed economic fluidity and institutional adaptiveness created by economic freedom.

According to Will Wilkinson of the libertarian think tank Cato Institute, studies show that higher economic freedom correlates strongly with higher self-reported happiness. According to economists Tomi Ovaska and Ryo Takashima, economic freedom research suggests &quot;that people unmistakably care about the degree to which the society where they live provides them opportunities and the freedom to undertake new projects, strongly with and make choices based on one&#x27;s personal preferences.&quot;

According to the Cato Institute, higher economic freedom promotes participation and collaboration. Also claimed is that higher economic freedom is extremely significant in preventing wars; according to their calculations, freedom is around 54 times more effective than democracy (as measured by &quot;Democracy Score&quot;) in diminishing violent conflict.

==Ratings==
Between 1995, the first edition of the &quot;Index&quot;, and 2008, the score for world economic freedom has increased, rising 2.6 points, according to the &quot;Index&quot;. 

Between 2008 and 2011, however, the score decreased 60.2 to 59.7, though the 2011 score represents an increase of 2.2 points since the first edition in 1995. The economic freedom score improved for 117 countries, the majority of countries included in the index, which were mainly developing and emerging market economies. In 2011, with the exception of Europe and North America, there were increased levels of freedom recorded in all regions, with the greatest improvement shown in Sub-Saharan Africa. The top five &quot;free&quot; economies identified by the 2011 index were Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and Switzerland, each scoring over 80 on the economic freedom grading scale.

Also in 2011, the United States dropped to 9th place in the &quot;Index&quot;, falling behind Denmark, Canada, and first-place Hong Kong, which ranked first in every issue of the &quot;Index&quot; from 1995 until 2019. The Heritage Foundation pointed to increases in government spending as a primary reason for the United States&#x27; decline in its ranking. According to data from the 2011 &quot;Index&quot;, the growth rates of countries with the highest levels of government spending were 4.5 points lower, on average, than countries where government spending was under control. In their &quot;Executive Highlights&quot; of index results in 2011, the Heritage Foundation wrote that, &quot;high levels of government spending in response to the global economic turmoil have not resulted in higher economic growth&quot;.

In 2012, results from the &quot;Index&quot; showed an overall decline in global economic freedom; according to The Heritage Foundation, the average score in its ranking was the second- lowest of the last ten years. The U.S. dropped to 10th place in the 2012 ranking, falling three places since 2008, when it was seventh. A report issued by the Heritage Foundation stated that government spending was the cause of many countries&#x27; declines, and that the spending had &quot;not only failed to arrest the economic crisis, but also – in many countries – seems to be prolonging it&quot;. According to the report, activity in the private sector is threatened by the greater government spending, which has increased public debt and led to more bureaucracy.

===Hong Kong===
For 25 consecutive years, from 1995 to 2019, Hong Kong was ranked the world&#x27;s most free economy by the &quot;Index&quot;. 

In 2019, however, after the Hong Kong national security law was implemented, the Heritage Foundation dropped Hong Kong and Macau as independent entities in the &quot;Index&quot;, writing that, &quot;developments in recent years have demonstrated unambiguously that those policies are ultimately controlled from Beijing&quot;. The 2019 &quot;Index&quot; ranked the level of economic freedom in China low, 107th among the 178 ranked in the report.

== Methodology ==
The &quot;Index&quot; evaluates 184 countries in four broad policy areas that affect the economic freedom, which are rule of law, government size, regulatory efficiency, and open markets. It also takes into consideration some specific categories like property rights, judicial effectiveness, government integrity and tax burden. The ranking scores aspects of economic freedom between 0 and 100, with 0 meaning &quot;no economic freedom&quot; and 100 meaning &quot;total economic freedom&quot;. There are twelve aspects divided into four categories.

==Reception==
In 2001, Freedom House, a human rights group, wrote that, &quot;there is a high and statistically significant correlation between the level of political freedom as measured by Freedom House and economic freedom as measured by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;/Heritage Foundation survey.&quot; 

In his 2005 book &quot;The End of Poverty&quot;, Jeffrey Sachs graphed countries&#x27; ratings on the &quot;Index&quot; against per capita GDP growth between 1995 and 2003, claiming to demonstrate that there was no correlation between a country&#x27;s rating and its rate of economic growth. As examples, Sachs cited countries with good ratings in the &quot;Index&quot;, such as Switzerland and Uruguay, which had sluggish economic performances while others, like China, with poorer ratings in the &quot;Index&quot; were experiencing strong economic growth.

In January 2005, Stefan Karlsson of the Ludwig von Mises Institute challenged the usefulness of the &quot;Index&quot; due to the fuzziness of many of the categories used to determine freedom. 

In March 2005, John Miller criticized the &quot;Index&quot;, writing in &quot;Dollars &amp; Sense&quot;, &quot;In the hands of the Wall Street Journal and the Heritage Foundation, Washington&#x27;s foremost right-wing think tank, however, an economic freedom index merely measures corporate and entrepreneurial freedom from accountability. Upon examination, the index turns out to be a poor barometer of either freedom more broadly construed or of prosperity.&quot; According to Left Business Observer, growth in Index accounts for 10% of the variation in the growth of GDP.

In September 2007, the Millennium Challenge Account, a U.S. government foreign aid program, used the &quot;Index&quot; in determining which countries will receive their performance-based compacts.

In January 2008, United Arab Emirates questioned its rating in the &quot;Index&quot;, comparing its average rating with the high rating they had received from other economic freedom indexes, such as Transparency International and Moody&#x27;s. UAE argued called the &quot;Index&quot; &quot;unreliable&quot;, arguing that its methodology changed twice over the prior two years.

===Rule of law===

# Trade-weighted average tariff rate
# Non-tariff barriers (NTBs)

==== Investment freedom ====
Analyzes how free or constrained is the flow of investment capital of individuals and firms.

==== Financial freedom ====
Indicates banking efficiency as well as how independent the government is from the financial sector. This aspect looks at five broad areas:
# Extent of government regulation of financial services
# Degree of state intervention in banks and other financial firms through direct and indirect ownership
# Government influence on the allocation of credit
# Extent of financial and capital market development
# Openness to foreign competition

=== Previous methodology ===
The &quot;Index&quot;″s 2008 definition of economic freedom is &quot;the highest form of economic freedom provides an absolute right of property ownership, fully realized freedoms of movement for labor, capital, and goods, and an absolute absence of coercion or constraint of economic liberty beyond the extent necessary for citizens to protect and maintain liberty itself.&quot;

The &quot;Index&quot; scores nations on ten factors of economic freedom, separated into four categories, using statistics from organizations like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, Economist Intelligence Unit and Transparency International. In each factor, countries are scored 0 to 100, with 0 being the least free and 100 the most free. A score of 100 signifies an economic environment or set of policies that is most conducive to economic freedom. The methodology has shifted and changed as new data and measurements have become available, especially in the area of Labor Freedom, which was given its own indicator spot in 2007. The following list explains what each factor currently assesses and groups them according to their respective category:

====Rule of law====
*Property Rights: Degree of a country&#x27;s legal protection of private property rights, degree of enforcement of those laws, independence of and corruption within the judiciary, and likelihood of expropriation.
*Freedom from corruption: The non-prevalence of political corruption within a country, according to the Corruption Perceptions Index.

====Limited government====
*Fiscal freedom: How free is a country from tax burden. It comprises three quantitative measures: top marginal tax rate of both individual (1) and corporate (2) income, and total tax burden as a percentage of GDP (3).
*Government size and spending: Governments&#x27; expenditures as a percentage of GDP, including consumption and transfers. The higher the percental spending, the lower the score.

====Regulatory efficiency====
*Business freedom: A country&#x27;s freedom from the burden of regulations on starting, operating, and closing business, given factors such as time, cost and number of procedures, as well as the efficiency of government in the regulatory process.
*Labor freedom: How free is a country from legal regulation on the labor market, including those relating to minimum wages, hiring and firing, hours of work and severance requirements.
*Monetary freedom: How free from microeconomic intervention and price instability is a country, basing on an equation considering the weighted average inflation rate in the last three years and price controls.

====Open markets====
*Trade freedom: Freedom from sizeable numbers and burdens of tariffs and non-tariff barriers to imports and exports of a country.
*Investment freedom: Freedom from restrictions on the movement and use of investment capital, regardless of activity, within and across the country&#x27;s borders.
*Financial freedom: A country&#x27;s independence from government control and interference in the financial sector, including banks. It considers government ownership of financial firms, extent of financial and capital market development, government influence on the allocation of credit and openness to foreign competition.

<text>Lucius Antonius () was the younger brother and a supporter of Mark Antony, a Roman politician. He was nicknamed Pietas as a young man.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Lucius was a son of Marcus Antonius Creticus and Julia, a third cousin of Julius Caesar. He was also grandson of the rhetorician Marcus Antonius Orator executed by Gaius Marius&#x27; supporters in 86 BC. Together with his older brothers Mark Antony and Gaius Antonius, he spent his early years roaming through Rome in bad company. Plutarch refers to the untamed life of the youths and their friends, frequenting gambling houses and drinking too much.

===Career===
Lucius was always a strong supporter of Mark Antony. In 44 BC, the year of Antony&#x27;s consulship and Julius Caesar&#x27;s assassination, Lucius, as tribune of the plebs, brought forward a law authorizing Caesar to nominate the chief magistrates during his absence from Rome. After the murder of Caesar, he supported his brother Marcus. He proposed an agrarian law in favor of the people and Caesar&#x27;s veterans and took part in the operations at Mutina (43 BC). 

In 41 BC, he was consul with Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus as his senior partner. In this year, he assisted Mark Antony&#x27;s wife, Fulvia, who was anxious to recall her husband from Cleopatra&#x27;s court, in the raising of an eight legion army to fight against Octavian&#x27;s unpopular policies. Later, observing the bitter feelings that had been evoked by the distribution of land among the veterans of Caesar, Antonius and Fulvia changed their attitude and stood forward as the defenders of those who had suffered from its operation. Antonius marched on Rome, drove out Lepidus, and promised the people that the triumvirate would be abolished. On the approach of Octavian, he retired to Perusia in Etruria, where he was besieged by three armies, and compelled to surrender in the winter of 41 BC. The city was destroyed but his life was spared, and he was sent by Octavian to Spain as governor. Nothing is known of the circumstances or date of his death. Cicero, in his &quot;Philippics&quot;, actuated in great measure by personal animosity, gives a highly unfavorable view of his character.

<text>Sextus Pompeius Magnus Pius ( 67 – 35 BC), also known in English as Sextus Pompey, was a Roman military leader who, throughout his life, upheld the cause of his father, Pompey the Great, against Julius Caesar and his supporters during the last civil wars of the Roman Republic. 

Sextus Pompey formed the last organized opposition to the Second Triumvirate, in defiance of which he succeeded in establishing an independent state in Sicily for several years.

==Biography==

Sextus Pompeius was the younger son of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Pompey the Great) by his third wife, Mucia Tertia. His sister was Pompeia and his elder brother was Gnaeus Pompeius. Both boys grew up in the shadow of their father, one of Rome&#x27;s greatest generals and an originally non-conservative politician who drifted to the more traditional faction when Julius Caesar became a threat.

When Caesar crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC, thus starting a civil war, Sextus&#x27; older brother Gnaeus followed their father in his escape to the East, as did most of the conservative senators. Sextus stayed in Rome in the care of his stepmother, Cornelia Metella. Pompey&#x27;s army lost the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC and Pompey himself had to run for his life. Cornelia and Sextus met him in the island of Lesbos and together they fled to Egypt. Upon arrival, Sextus watched his father being killed by treachery on 29 September of the same year. After the murder, Cornelia returned to Rome; in the following years, Sextus joined the resistance against Caesar in the African provinces. Together with Metellus Scipio, Cato the Younger, his brother Gnaeus and other senators, they prepared to oppose Caesar and his army to the end.

Caesar won the first battle at Thapsus in 46 BC against Metellus Scipio and Cato, who committed suicide. In 45 BC, Caesar managed to defeat the Pompeius brothers in the Battle of Munda, in Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula, comprising modern Spain and Portugal), after what he himself described as his hardest fought victory ever. Gnaeus Pompeius would soon die in a last stand at Lauro, but young Sextus escaped once more, this time to Sicily, and thereafter raised another dissident army in Spain.

Back in Rome, Julius Caesar was killed on the Ides of March (15 March) 44 BC by a group of senators led by Cassius and Brutus. This incident did not lead to a return to normality, but provoked yet another civil war between Caesar&#x27;s political heirs and his killers. One of the latter, Decimus Brutus, wrote to M. Brutus and to Cassius that March that &quot;we have nowhere to base ourselves, except for Sex. Pompeius&quot;. Early in 43, the Senate commended Marcus Aemelius Lepidus for forging an alliance with Sextus against the Caesarians; but thereafter Lepidus joined the Second Triumvirate formed by Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus and Marcus Antonius, with the intention of avenging Caesar and subduing all other parties. Sextus Pompeius in the Western Mediterranean certainly remained a focus of opposition, but the faction of Cassius and Brutus was the second triumvirate&#x27;s first priority. Thus Sextus had the time and resources to develop an army, with the whole island of Sicily as his base, and (even more importantly) to establish a strong navy operated by Sicilian marines.

Brutus and Cassius lost the twin battles of Philippi and committed suicide in 42 BC. After this, the triumvirs turned their attentions to Sicily and Sextus.
However, Sextus was by now prepared for strong resistance. In the following years, military confrontations failed to return a conclusive victory for either side, although in 40 BC Sextus&#x27; admiral, the freedman Menas, seized Sardinia from Octavian&#x27;s governor Marcus Lurius. In 39 BC, Sextus and the triumvirs signed for peace in the Pact of Misenum.
The reason for the peace treaty was to secure the West before the anticipated campaign against the Parthian Empire: Tacitus reports the view that &quot;he [Octavian] had cheated Sextus Pompeius by a spurious peace treaty&quot;. Antony, the leader of Rome&#x27;s eastern provinces, needed a large number of legions for the coming campaign, which would take his army (ostensibly) through Mesopotamia, Armenia and Parthia. Thus, an armistice with Sextus&#x27; large forces on Sicily proved useful.
The peace did not last for long. In Antony&#x27;s absence, Octavian renewed the conflict against Sextus. Sextus and Octavian accused each other of violating the terms of the Pact of Misenum, but the final straw was the betrayal of Sardinia to Octavian by Menas. Octavian was defeated in the naval battle of Messina (37 BC), so he now turned to his friends Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Titus Statilius Taurus, both very talented generals. In addition, the third triumvir, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, raised 14 legions in his African provinces to help defeat Pompey.

Agrippa spent the winter training a navy on land and building a fleet near Lake Avernus, from scratch. Agrippa fought Sextus at Mylae in August 36 BC, and again a month later, while Lepidus and Statilius Taurus invaded Sicily. In the Battle of Naulochus, Agrippa destroyed the remainder of Sextus&#x27; fleet. Sextus escaped to Asia Minor and, by abandoning Sicily, lost his only base of support.

Sextus Pompeius was finally captured in 35 BC, and executed without trial in Miletus by Marcus Titius, whom Sextus had once spared; either by his own initiative or possibly on the orders of Antony or Plancus. Although Octavian later pretended that the execution without a trial of Sextus was illegal because Sextus was a Roman citizen, Octavian himself had declared Sextus an outlaw without citizen rights.

==Family connections==
Sextus had married Scribonia, a distant relative. She was the daughter of Lucius Scribonius Libo, consul of 34 BC and the niece of another Scribonia, the second wife of Octavian. Sextus and Scribonia had a daughter, their only child, called Pompeia Magna. As an affine to both Sextus and Octavian, Scribonius Libo had played a role in brokering peace between Sextus and the Triumviri, and had very reluctantly abandoned Sextus in 36/35, in return for which he had received the consulship.

==Chronology==
*48 BC – in Egypt with his father, who is assassinated
*47/45 BC – resistance in Africa
*45 BC – his brother, Gnaeus, is defeated at Munda, Sextus continues resistance 
*42 BC – controls Sicily with a powerful navy
*39 BC – pact of Misenum with Octavianus and Antony
*37 BC – defeats Octavian off Messina
*36 BC
**August, defeats Octavian
**September, defeated by Agrippa off Naulochus (Sicily)
*35 BC – captured and executed in Asia Minor (Miletus)

==Historiographical readings==
Where Plutarch gives Sextus only a minor role in the confused events surrounding the fall of the Roman Republic, Appian sees him as a more central figure, who might even have emerged as the final victor, so as to establish a dynasty of Pompeys, not Caesars.

==Dramatic representations==
* Shakespeare had Sextus Pompey as a major character in his play &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (1606–07).
** British actor Donald Sumpter portrayed Sextus Pompey in the 1981 BBC Shakespeare television production of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;.
** American actor Walter Koenig portrayed Sextus Pompey in the 1983 Bard Productions television production of the play.
* Sesto (Italian for Sextus) appears as main character in 1682 opera titled &quot;Il Pompeo&quot; by Italian baroque composer Alessandro Scarlatti. 
* Sextus (&quot;Sesto&quot; in Italian) appears in George Frideric Handel&#x27;s 1724 opera &quot;Giulio Cesare in Egitto&quot; (&quot;Julius Caesar in Egypt&quot;). The opera attributes to Sextus the killing of the Egyptian King Ptolemy XIII, who had killed his father Pompey. This is not historically attested.
*Sextus appears as a minor character in 2 episodes of the MGM+ series &quot;Domina&quot;, portrayed by Tom Forbes.

<doc id="345419" wikidata="Q322996" url="?curid=345419" title="Economic freedom">
<text>Economic freedom, or economic liberty, is the agency of people to make economic decisions. This is a term used in economic and policy debates as well as in the philosophy of economics. One approach to economic freedom comes from the liberal tradition emphasizing free markets, free trade, and private property. Another approach to economic freedom extends the welfare economics study of individual choice, with greater economic freedom coming from a larger set of possible choices. Other conceptions of economic freedom include freedom from want and the freedom to engage in collective bargaining.

The liberal free-market viewpoint defines economic liberty as the freedom to produce, trade and consume any goods and services acquired without the use of force, fraud, theft or government regulation. This is embodied in the rule of law, property rights and freedom of contract, and characterized by external and internal openness of the markets, the protection of property rights and freedom of economic initiative. There are several indices of economic freedom that attempt to measure free market economic freedom. Based on these rankings, correlative studies have found higher economic growth to be correlated with higher scores on the country rankings. Critics of this approach, such as Fredrik Carlsson and Susanna Lundström, have argued that the economic freedom indices conflate unrelated policies and policy outcomes, for example counting lower corruption as an indicator of economic freedom, to conceal negative correlations between economic growth and free-market policies.

== Liberal viewpoint ==
=== Institutions of economic freedom ===
==== Private property rights ====

According to the liberal free-market view, a secure system of private property rights is a necessary part of economic freedom. Such systems include two main rights, namely the right to control and benefit from property and the right to transfer property by voluntary means. David A. Harper argues that a system of private property is required for entrepreneurship, because &quot;entrepreneurs would not be able to formulate or carry out their plans unless they were reasonably sure that the people with whom they trade have exclusive control over the relevant resources.&quot; Bernard H. Siegan holds that a secure system of property rights also reduces uncertainty and encourages investments, creating favorable conditions for an economy to be successful. According to Hernando de Soto, much of the poverty in Third World countries is caused by a lack of Western systems of laws and well-defined and universally recognized property rights. De Soto argues that because of legal barriers and because it is often unclear who owns what property, poor people in those countries cannot utilize their assets to produce more wealth. David L. Weimer, surveying a series of empirical studies about economic growth, reports that &quot;a number of economic historians have noted the importance of credible property rights, especially in terms of freedom from arbitrary seizures of property by governments, for understanding relative rates of growth in different time periods and regions,&quot; and concludes that countries with strong property rights systems have economic growth rates almost twice as high as those of countries with weak property rights systems. At the same time, he notes that the risk of unexpected seizure, and not state ownership in and of itself, is responsible for this outcome, saying: &quot;the degree of state ownership of property does not have a statistically significant effect on growth rates after controlling for the risk of seizure.&quot;

==== Freedom of contract ====
Freedom of contract is the right to choose one&#x27;s contracting parties and to trade with them on any terms and conditions one sees fit. Contracts permit individuals to create their own enforceable legal rules, adapted to their unique situations. Disputes arising from contracts are typically resolved by the judiciary branch of government, but not all contracts need to be enforced by the state. For example, in the United States there is a large number of third-party arbitration tribunals which resolve disputes under private commercial law. Negatively understood, freedom of contract is freedom from government interference and from imposed value judgments of fairness. The notion of &quot;freedom of contract&quot; was given one of its most famous legal expressions in 1875 by Sir George Jessel MR: 

The doctrine of freedom of contract received one of its strongest expressions in the US Supreme Court case of &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot; which struck down legal restrictions on the working hours of bakers.

Critics of the classical view of freedom of contract argue that this freedom is illusory when the bargaining power of the parties is highly unequal, most notably in the case of contracts between employers and workers. As in the case of restrictions on working hours, workers as a group may benefit from legal protections that prevent individuals agreeing to contracts that require long working hours. In its &quot;West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish&quot; decision in 1937, overturning &quot;Lochner&quot;, the Supreme Court cited an earlier decision: 

From this point on, the &quot;Lochner&quot; view of freedom of contract has been rejected by US courts.

=== Economic and political freedom ===
Some free market advocates argue that political and civil liberties have simultaneously expanded with market-based economies, and present empirical evidence to support the claim that economic and political freedoms are linked.

In &quot;Capitalism and Freedom&quot; (1962), Friedman further developed Friedrich Hayek&#x27;s argument that economic freedom, while itself an extremely important component of total freedom, is also a necessary condition for political freedom. He commented that centralized control of economic activities was always accompanied with political repression. In his view, voluntary character of all transactions in a free market economy and wide diversity that it permits are fundamental threats to repressive political leaders and greatly diminish power to coerce. Through elimination of centralized control of economic activities, economic power is separated from political power, and the one can serve as counterbalance to the other. Friedman feels that competitive capitalism is especially important to minority groups, since impersonal market forces protect people from discrimination in their economic activities for reasons unrelated to their productivity.

Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises argued that economic and political freedom were mutually dependent: &quot;The idea that political freedom can be preserved in the absence of economic freedom, and vice versa, is an illusion. Political freedom is the corollary of economic freedom. It is no accident that the age of capitalism became also the age of government by the people.&quot;

In &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;, Hayek argued that &quot;Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends.&quot; Hayek criticized socialist policies as the slippery slope that can lead to totalitarianism.

Gordon Tullock has argued that &quot;the Hayek-Friedman argument&quot; predicted totalitarian governments in much of Western Europe in the late 20th century – which did not occur. He uses the example of Sweden, in which the government at that time controlled 63 percent of GNP, as an example to support his argument that the basic problem with &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; is &quot;that it offered predictions which turned out to be false. The steady advance of government in places such as Sweden has not led to any loss of non-economic freedoms.&quot; While criticizing Hayek, Tullock still praises the classical liberal notion of economic freedom, saying, &quot;Arguments for political freedom are strong, as are the arguments for economic freedom. We needn&#x27;t make one set of arguments depend on the other.&quot;

=== Indices of economic freedom ===

The annual surveys &quot;Economic Freedom of the World&quot; (EFW) and &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot; (IEF) are two indices which attempt to measure the degree of economic freedom in the world&#x27;s nations. The EFW index, originally developed by Gwartney, Lawson and Block at the Fraser Institute was likely the most used in empirical studies as of 2000.

The &quot;Economic Freedom of the World&quot; score for the entire world has grown considerably in recent decades. The average score has increased from 5.17 in 1985 to 6.4 in 2005. Of the nations in 1985, 95 nations increased their score, seven saw a decline, and six were unchanged. Using the 2008 Index of Economic Freedom methodology world economic freedom has increased 2.6 points since 1995.

Members of the World Bank Group also use &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot; as the indicator of investment climate, because it covers more aspects relevant to the private sector in wide number of countries.

==== Criticism ====
The nature of economic freedom is often in dispute. Robert Lawson, the co-author of &quot;EFW&quot;, even acknowledges the potential shortcomings of freedom indices: &quot;The purpose of the EFW index is to measure, no doubt imprecisely, the degree of economic freedom that exists.&quot; He likens the recent attempts of economists to measure economic freedom to the initial attempts of economists to measure GDP: &quot;They [macroeconomists] were
scientists who sat down to design, as best they could with the tools at hand, a measure of the current economic activity of the nation. Economic activity exists and their job was to measure it. Likewise economic freedom exists. It is a thing. We can define and measure it.&quot; Thus, it follows that some economists, socialists and anarchists contend that the existing indicators of economic freedom are too narrowly defined and should take into account a broader conception of economic freedoms.

Critics of the indices (e.g. Thom Hartmann) also oppose the inclusion of business-related measures like corporate charters and intellectual property protection. John Miller in Dollars &amp; Sense has stated that the indices are &quot;a poor barometer of either freedom more broadly construed or of prosperity.&quot; He argues that the high correlation between living standards and economic freedom as measured by IEF is the result of choices made in the construction of the index that guarantee this result. For example, the treatment of a large informal sector (common in poor countries) as an indicator of restrictive government policy, and the use of the change in the ratio of government spending to national income, rather than the level of this ratio. Hartmann argues that these choices cause the social democratic European countries to rank higher than countries where the government share of the economy is small but growing.

Economists Dani Rodrik and Jeffrey Sachs have separately noted that there appears to be little correlation between measured economic freedom and economic growth when the least free countries are disregarded, as indicated by the strong growth of the Chinese economy in recent years. Morris Altman found that there is a relatively large correlation between economic freedom and both per capita income and per capita growth. He argues that this is especially true when it comes to sub-indices relating to property rights and sound money, while he calls into question the importance of sub-indices relating to labor regulation and government size once certain threshold values are passed. John Miller further observes that Hong Kong and Singapore, both only &quot;partially free&quot; according to Freedom House, are leading countries on both economic freedom indices and casts doubt on the claim that measured economic freedom is associated with political freedom. However, according to the Freedom House, &quot;there is a high and statistically significant correlation between the level of political freedom as measured by Freedom House and economic freedom as measured by the Wall Street Journal/Heritage Foundation survey.&quot;

== Choice sets and economic freedom ==

Amartya Sen and other economists consider economic freedom to be measured in terms of the set of economic choices available to individuals. Economic freedom is greater when individuals have more economic choices available – when, in some technical sense, the choice set of individuals expands.

=== Positive and negative freedom ===
The differences between alternative views of economic freedom have been expressed in terms of Isaiah Berlin&#x27;s distinction between positive freedom and negative freedom. Classical liberals favour a focus on negative freedom as did Berlin himself. By contrast Amartya Sen argues for an understanding of freedom in terms of capabilities to pursue a range of goals. One measure which attempts to assess freedom in the positive sense is Goodin, Rice, Parpo, and Eriksson&#x27;s measure of discretionary time, which is an estimate of how much time people have at their disposal during which they are free to choose the activities in which they participate, after taking into account the time they need to spend acquiring the necessities of life. In his book, &quot;Capitalism and Freedom&quot;, Milton Friedman explains the preservation of freedom is the reason for limited and decentralized governments. It creates positive freedom within the society allowing for freedom of choice for an individual in a free society.

== Freedom from want ==
Franklin D. Roosevelt included freedom from want in his Four Freedoms speech. Roosevelt stated that freedom from want &quot;translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants – everywhere in the world&quot;. In terms of US policy, Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal included economic freedoms such as freedom of trade union organisation, as well as a wide range of policies of government intervention and redistributive taxation aimed at promoting freedom from want. Internationally, Roosevelt favored the policies associated with the Bretton Woods Agreement which fixed exchange rates and established international economic institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

Herbert Hoover saw economic freedom as a fifth freedom, which secures survival of Roosevelt&#x27;s Four freedoms. He described economic freedom as freedom &quot;for men to choose their own calling, to accumulate property in protection of their children and old age, [and] freedom of enterprise that does not injure others.&quot;

== Freedom of association and unions ==
The Philadelphia Declaration (enshrined in the constitution of the International Labour Organization) states that &quot;all human beings, irrespective of race, creed or sex, have the right to pursue both their material well-being and their spiritual development in conditions of freedom and dignity, of economic security and equal opportunity.&quot; The ILO further states that &quot;The right of workers and employers to form and join organizations of their own choosing is an integral part of a free and open society.&quot;

== Socialist views ==
The socialist view of economic freedom conceives of freedom as a concrete situation as opposed to an abstract or moral concept. This view of freedom is closely related to the socialist view of human creativity and the importance ascribed to creative freedom. Socialists view creativity as an essential aspect of human nature, thus defining freedom as a situation or state of being where individuals are able to express their creativity unhindered by constraints of both material scarcity and coercive social institutions. Marxists stress the importance of freeing the individual from what they view as coercive, exploitative and alienating social relationships of production they are compelled to partake in, as well as the importance of economic development as providing the material basis for the existence of a state of society where there are enough resources to allow for each individual to pursue his or her genuine creative interests.

== Socioeconomic impact of economic freedom ==
One of the ways to measure economic competitiveness is by comparing an extent of economic freedom that countries have, which as surveys show can also largely explain differences in economic well-being across the world. Generally, countries with higher economic freedom have higher gross domestic product per capita and its growth rates, as well as better health care, education quality, environment protection, income equality, and happiness results. These trends of increasing prosperity are confirmed even when we compare these indicators within territories of countries. Nevertheless, despite these benefits societies have to be aware that with increasing economic freedom they will have to face going through a phase of increasing inequality, which basically is a result of decreased redistribution, as well as other negative effects from economic liberalization, i.e., running of local enterprises out of business, takeover of competitive firms, enforcing of interests of foreign companies, dependence on foreign capital, deteriorating work rights, harmful manufacturing for the environment, introducing of commercial practices that are not favorable for consumers, as well as endangerment for survival of national cultures. However, these negative effects from economic freedom tend to be felt in a shorter term, and if countries use the opportunities of economic freedom in our increasingly globalized economy in a right way, as research shows their socioeconomic conditions will be significantly better than in a case of less economic freedom.

<text>Lochranza () is a village located on the Isle of Arran in the Firth of Clyde, Scotland. The population, somewhat in decline, is around 200 people.

==Geography==

Lochranza is the northernmost of Arran&#x27;s villages and is located in the northwestern corner of the island. The village is set on the shore of Loch Ranza, a small sea loch. Ferries run from here to Claonaig on the mainland. The village is flanked to the northeast by the landmark hill Torr Meadhonach.

===Geology===
Lochranza has a field study centre, where schools from all over the UK come to study the locality&#x27;s interesting geology and the nearby Hutton&#x27;s Unconformity to the north of Newton Point, where the &quot;father of modern geology&quot; James Hutton found his first example of an angular unconformity during a visit in 1787.

===Climate===
Lochranza is reputed to have the fewest hours of sunshine of any village in the United Kingdom, and is the most shaded village in the entire world according to world climate experts , since it lies in a north-facing glen on an island with a particularly high level of rainfall. The streets do not have any street lights so it can be dark in the winter months.

===Wildlife===

The area around Lochranza Castle is a favoured spot to observe red deer, as the village is home to a healthy red deer population and, on the northern shore, grey seals are found year-round. Otters and golden eagles are also spotted in the area.

==Economy==
Formerly a herring fishing port, the village economy is now geared more towards tourism after the reopening of the pier in 2003. Lochranza Castle is a fine ruin of a 16th-century L-plan castle, across the road from the Lochranza youth hostel.

Lochranza is the site of the Arran Distillery, built in 1995 and producing the Arran Single Malt. The distillery is one of the major industries of the island. The bar of the Lochranza Hotel, to the north of the distillery, has one of the largest collections of Scotch whisky available by the measure in the country: over 350 different Scotch whiskies are available.

Lochranza has a golf course with eleven holes.

<text>Henry St. Claire Fredericks Jr. (born May 17, 1942), better known by his stage name Taj Mahal, is an American blues musician. He plays the guitar, piano, banjo, harmonica, and many other instruments, often incorporating elements of world music into his work. Mahal has done much to reshape the definition and scope of blues music over the course of his more than 50-year career by fusing it with nontraditional forms, including sounds from the Caribbean, Africa, India, Hawaii, and the South Pacific.

==Early life==
Mahal was born Henry St. Claire Fredericks Jr. on May 17, 1942, in New York City. Growing up in Springfield, Massachusetts, he was raised in a musical environment: his mother was a member of a local gospel choir and his father, Henry Saint Claire Fredericks Sr., was an Afro-Caribbean jazz arranger and piano player.

The family owned a shortwave radio which received music broadcasts from around the world, exposing him at an early age to world music. Early in childhood he recognized the stark differences between the popular music of his day and the music that was played in his home. He also became interested in jazz, enjoying the works of musicians such as Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk and Milt Jackson. His parents came of age during the Harlem Renaissance, instilling in their son a sense of pride in his Caribbean and African ancestry through their stories.
Because his father was a musician, his home frequently hosted other musicians from the Caribbean, Africa, and the US. His father was called &quot;The Genius&quot; by Ella Fitzgerald before starting his family. Early on, Henry Jr. developed an interest in African music, which he studied assiduously as a young man. His parents encouraged him to pursue music, starting him out with classical piano lessons. He also studied the clarinet, trombone and harmonica.

When Henry Jr. was eleven years old, his father was killed in an accident at his construction company, crushed by a tractor when it flipped. It was an extremely traumatic experience for the boy. Henry Jr&#x27;s mother remarried, and his stepfather owned a guitar which he began using at the age of 13 or 14. His first lessons were from a new neighbor from North Carolina of his own age who played acoustic blues guitar. This neighbor, Lynwood Perry, was the nephew of the famous bluesman Arthur &quot;Big Boy&quot; Crudup. In high school Henry Jr. sang in a doo-wop group.

For some time, Henry thought of pursuing farming over music. His passion began on a dairy farm in Palmer, Massachusetts, not far from Springfield, at the age of 16. By the time he was 19, he had become farm foreman. &quot;I milked anywhere between thirty-five and seventy cows a day. I clipped udders. I grew corn. I grew Tennessee redtop clover. Alfalfa.&quot; Mahal believes in growing one&#x27;s own food, saying, &quot;You have a whole generation of kids who think everything comes out of a box and a can, and they don&#x27;t know you can grow most of your food.&quot; Because of his personal support of the family farm, Mahal regularly performs at Farm Aid concerts.

Henry chose his stage name, Taj Mahal, from dreams he had about Mahatma Gandhi, India, and social tolerance. Henry started using the stage name in 1959 or 1961—around the same time he began attending the University of Massachusetts. Despite having attended a vocational agriculture school, becoming a member of the National FFA Organization, and majoring in animal husbandry and minoring in veterinary science and agronomy, Mahal decided to pursue music instead of farming. In college, he led a rhythm and blues band called Taj Mahal &amp; The Elektras. Before heading for the US West Coast, he was also part of a duo with Jessie Lee Kincaid.

==Career==
Mahal moved to Santa Monica, California, in 1964 and formed Rising Sons with fellow blues rock musicians Ry Cooder and Jessie Lee Kincaid, landing a record deal with Columbia Records soon after. After the Rising Sons disbanded, Jesse Ed Davis, a Kiowa native from Oklahoma, joined Taj Mahal and played guitar and piano on Mahal&#x27;s first four albums. The group was one of the first interracial bands of the period, which may have hampered their commercial viability. However, Rising Sons bassist Gary Marker later recalled the band&#x27;s members had come to a creative impasse and were unable to reconcile their musical and personal differences even with the guidance of veteran producer Terry Melcher. They recorded enough songs for a full-length album, but released only a single and the band soon broke up. Legacy Records did release &quot;The Rising Sons Featuring Taj Mahal and Ry Cooder&quot; in 1992 with material from that period. During this time Mahal was also working with other musicians like Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Buddy Guy, Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, and Muddy Waters.

Mahal stayed with Columbia for his solo career, releasing the self-titled &quot;Taj Mahal&quot; and &quot;The Natch&#x27;l Blues&quot; in 1968. His track &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot; was featured on side 2 of the very successful Columbia/CBS sampler album, &quot;The Rock Machine Turns You On&quot;, giving a huge early impetus to his career. &quot;Giant Step/De Old Folks at Home&quot; with session musician Jesse Ed Davis followed in 1969. During this time he and Cooder worked with the Rolling Stones, with whom he has performed at various times throughout his career. In 1968, he performed in the film &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot;. In 1969, he performed at the Gold Rush rock music festival in Amador County.

Mahal recorded a total of twelve albums for Columbia from the late 1960s into the 1970s. His work of the 1970s was especially important, in that his releases began incorporating West Indian and Caribbean music, jazz and reggae into the mix. In 1972, he acted in and wrote the film score for the movie &quot;Sounder&quot;, which starred Cicely Tyson. He reprised his role and returned as composer in the sequel, &quot;Part 2, Sounder&quot;.

In 1976 Mahal left Columbia and signed with Warner Bros. Records, recording three albums for them. One of these was another film score for 1977&#x27;s &quot;Brothers&quot;; the album shares the same name. After his time with Warner Bros., he struggled to find another record contract, this being the era of heavy metal and disco music.

Stalled in his career, he decided to move to Kauai, Hawaii in 1981 and soon formed the Hula Blues Band. Originally just a group of guys getting together for fishing and a good time, the band soon began performing regularly and touring. He maintained a low public profile in Hawaii throughout most of the 1980s before recording &quot;Taj&quot; in 1988 for Gramavision. This started a comeback of sorts for him, recording both for Gramavision and Hannibal Records during this time.

In the 1990s, Mahal became deeply involved in supporting the nonprofit Music Maker Relief Foundation. As of 2019, he was still on the Foundation&#x27;s advisory board.

In the 1990s, he was on the Private Music label, releasing albums full of blues, pop, R&amp;B and rock. He did collaborative works both with Eric Clapton and Etta James.

In 1995, he recorded a record fusing traditional American blues with Indian stringed instruments, &quot;Mumtaz Mahal&quot;, accompanied by Vishwa Mohan Bhatt on Mohan veena and N. Ravikiran on chitravina, a fretless lute.

In 1998, in collaboration with renowned songwriter David Forman, producer Rick Chertoff and musicians Cyndi Lauper, Willie Nile, Joan Osborne, Rob Hyman, Garth Hudson and Levon Helm of the Band, and the Chieftains, he performed on the Americana album &quot;Largo&quot; based on the music of Antonín Dvořák.

In 1997, he won Best Contemporary Blues Album for &quot;Señor Blues&quot; at the Grammy Awards, followed by another Grammy for &quot;Shoutin&#x27; in Key&quot; in 2000. He performed the theme song to the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Peep and the Big Wide World&quot;, which began broadcast in 2004.

In 2002, Mahal appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Red Hot and Riot&quot; in tribute to Nigerian afrobeat musician Fela Kuti. The Paul Heck produced album was widely acclaimed, and all proceeds from the record were donated to AIDS charities.

Taj Mahal contributed to Olmecha Supreme&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;hedfoneresonance&quot;. The Wellington-based group led by Mahal&#x27;s son Imon Starr (Ahmen Mahal) also featured Deva Mahal on vocals.

Mahal partnered up with Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; to release a joint album &quot;TajMo&quot; on May 5, 2017. The album has some guest appearances by Bonnie Raitt, Joe Walsh, Sheila E., and Lizz Wright, and has six original compositions and five covers, from artists and bands like John Mayer and The Who.

In 2013, Mahal appeared in the documentary film on Byrds founding member Gene Clark, &#x27;The Byrd Who Flew Alone&#x27;, produced by Four Suns Productions. Clark and Mahal had been friends for many years.

In June 2017, Mahal appeared in the award-winning documentary film &quot;The American Epic Sessions,&quot; directed by Bernard MacMahon, recording Charley Patton&#x27;s &quot;High Water Everywhere&quot; on the first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s. Mahal appeared throughout the accompanying documentary series &quot;American Epic,&quot; commenting on the 1920s rural recording artists who had a profound influence on American music and on him personally.

==Personal life==
Mahal&#x27;s first marriage was to Anna de Leon. He refers to Anna in the song &quot;Texas Woman Blues&quot; with the spoken words &quot;Señorita de Leon, escucha mi canción&quot;. That marriage produced one daughter, the novelist and professor Aya de Leon. Taj Mahal married Inshirah Geter on January 23, 1976, and together they have six children. His daughter Deva Mahal appeared on one episode of &quot;Dating Around&quot;.

==Musical style==

Mahal leads with his thumb and middle finger when fingerpicking, rather than with his index finger as the majority of guitar players do. &quot;I play with a flatpick,&quot; he says, &quot;when I do a lot of blues leads.&quot; Early in his musical career Mahal studied the various styles of his favorite blues singers, including musicians like Jimmy Reed, Son House, Sleepy John Estes, Big Mama Thornton, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Mississippi John Hurt, and Sonny Terry. He describes his hanging out at clubs like Club 47 in Massachusetts and Ash Grove in Los Angeles as &quot;basic building blocks in the development of his music.&quot; Considered to be a scholar of blues music, his studies of ethnomusicology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst would come to introduce him further to the folk music of the Caribbean and West Africa. Over time he incorporated more and more African roots music into his musical palette, embracing elements of reggae, calypso, jazz, zydeco, R&amp;B, gospel music, and the country blues—each of which having &quot;served as the foundation of his unique sound.&quot; According to &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot;, &quot;It has been said that Taj Mahal was one of the first major artists, if not the first, to pursue the possibilities of world music. Even the blues he was playing in the early 70s – &quot;Recycling The Blues &amp; Other Related Stuff&quot; (1972), &quot;Mo&#x27; Roots&quot; (1974) – showed an aptitude for spicing the mix with flavours that always kept him a yard or so distant from being an out-and-out blues performer.&quot; Concerning his voice, author David Evans writes that Mahal has &quot;an extraordinary voice that ranges from gruff and gritty to smooth and sultry.&quot;
Taj Mahal believes that his 1999 album &quot;Kulanjan&quot;, which features him playing with the kora master of Mali&#x27;s Griot tradition Toumani Diabaté, &quot;embodies his musical and cultural spirit arriving full circle.&quot; To him it was an experience that allowed him to reconnect with his African heritage, striking him with a sense of coming home. He even changed his name to Dadi Kouyate, the first jali name, to drive this point home. Speaking of the experience and demonstrating the breadth of his eclecticism, he has said:

Taj Mahal has said he prefers to do outdoor performances, saying: &quot;The music was designed for people to move, and it&#x27;s a bit difficult after a while to have people sitting like they&#x27;re watching television. That&#x27;s why I like to play outdoor festivals-because people will just dance. Theatre audiences need to ask themselves: &#x27;What the hell is going on? We&#x27;re asking these musicians to come and perform and then we sit there and draw all the energy out of the air.&#x27; That&#x27;s why after a while I need a rest. It&#x27;s too much of a drain. Often I don&#x27;t allow that. I just play to the goddess of music-and I know she&#x27;s dancing.&quot;

Mahal has been quoted as saying, &quot;Eighty-one percent of the kids listening to rap were not black kids. Once there was a tremendous amount of money involved in it ... they totally moved it over to a material side. It just went off to a terrible direction. ...You can listen to my music from front to back, and you don&#x27;t ever hear me moaning and crying about how bad you done treated me. I think that style of blues and that type of tone was something that happened as a result of many white people feeling very, very guilty about what went down.&quot;

<text>Whiting Bay (, &quot;between two headlands&quot;) is a village located on the Isle of Arran in the Firth of Clyde, Scotland south of Lamlash and south of Brodick. With more than 600 inhabitants it’s the third largest village on the island of Arran, behind Lamlash and Brodick.

It is called after the bay near the southern end of Arran&#x27;s east coast that the settlement sits on.

==History==
Originally Whiting Bay consisted of a group of small settlements situated on the coast or just inland from it. The names of these hamlets are still extant and are given to the separate &quot;districts&quot; which the small relatively small village of Whiting Bay is split up into. The most northerly is Kingscross, south of there is Auchencairn, then Kockenkelly, North Kiscadale, South Kiscadale and then the most southerly is Largymore. These settlements have an ancient origin, the hillside inland from Largymore there is a prehistoric burial site called the Giants Graves. At Kingscross Point, at the opposite end of the village, there is a dun or fortified farmstead dating back almost two thousand years. The Vikings settled at Kingscross and had a burial site there, and has led to suggestions that the Bay and the Village were named after them as &quot;Viking Bay&quot; and that this was later corrupted to Whiting Bay. Kingscross is also noted as the site where Robert the Bruce embarked for Ayrshire in February 1307, on his way to regaining control of his kingdom from the English. When these were excavated the archaeologist responsible discovered two settings of stones which were apart, and positioned approximately above the centre of the mound. Within the mound they found a pile of articles which consisted of human bones which had been affected by heat, fragments of whalebone which were decorated with a design of concentric circles, charcoal, lumps of iron, among which were Viking boat rivets, bronze pieces, two pieces of vitrified stone and a bronze coin, identified as a styca of Wigmund, the Archbishop of York between 831 and 854 C.E.

When a ferry was set up between the town of Saltcoats in Ayrshire and Arran in 1790 this led to the merging of the five settlements into the village of Whiting Bay. The steamers from Glasgow and elsewhere in the Clyde Estuary began to call in at Whiting Bay in the 1830s. When the inland crofting areas of Arran underwent clearances from the 1830s this led to an increased demand for accommodation on the coast. Of all of the villages on Arran, Whiting Bay appears to have been attractive to a more well-heeled clientele. These more genteel arrivals had a succession of fine villas built along the inland side of the road running along the bay. A golf course was constructed in 1895, along with tennis courts, a bowling club and a putting green. A new pier was finished in 1901 and this enabled steamers to disembark passengers directly into Whiting Bay rather than ferrying them to shore in &quot;flit boats&quot;, and this reinforced the village&#x27;s increase in size. The Whiting Bay village hall was added in 1926. There was a youth hostel in Whiting Bay but this closed in the early 21st century and sold off.

==Present==
In the late 1950s the steamer services to Arran from the mainland stopped calling in at Whiting Bay and the service changed to a car ferry calling only at Brodick from 1957. This led to the fortunes of Whiting Bay waning and the venerable steamer pier shut in the early 1960s. The village still has a modest pier situated on the shore close to the line of tiny shops in the centre of the village with their rears to the water. Many of the grander villas have been converted into tourist amenities such as hotels, guesthouses and restaurants and the village has a large proportion of such accommodation on the island. The Whiting Bay Golf Club continues to operate, as does the putting green. The village also has a primary school, a doctors&#x27; surgery and a number of businesses catering for visitors such as an art gallery. In the 2011 Census the population of Whiting Bay was 620.

<doc id="345426" wikidata="Q483659" url="?curid=345426" title="Flag of Singapore">
<text>The flag of Singapore was adopted in 1959, the year Singapore became self-governing within the British Empire. It remained the national flag upon the country&#x27;s independence from Malaysia on 9 August 1965. The design is a horizontal bicolour of red above white, overlaid in the canton (upper-left quadrant) by a white crescent moon facing a pentagon of five small white five-pointed stars. The elements of the flag denote a young nation on the ascendant, universal brotherhood and equality, and national ideals.

Vessels at sea do not use the national flag as an ensign. Merchant vessels and pleasure craft fly a civil ensign of red charged in white with a variant of the crescent and stars emblem in the centre. Non-military government vessels such as coast guard ships fly a state ensign of blue with the national flag in the canton, charged with an eight-pointed red and white compass rose in the lower fly. Naval ships patrol a naval ensign similar to the state ensign, but in white with a red compass rose emblem.

The usage and exhibition of the national flag in Singapore are regulated by the rules set forth in the National Symbols Act. Under the Act, which took effect on 1 August 2023 and superseded the former Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Act, private citizens may include the flag in designs for other objects, and the national flag or its image can be used on attire above the torso for non-commercial purposes year-round as long as it is not done in a disrespectful manner. Regulations are relaxed during National Day celebrations from 1 July to 30 September.

==History==
Singapore was under British rule in the 19th century, having been amalgamated into the Straits Settlements together with Malacca and Penang. The flag that was used to represent the Settlements was a British Blue Ensign defaced with a red diamond containing three gold crowns—one for each settlement—separated by a white inverted pall, which resembles an inverted Y.

The Settlement of Singapore had no separate flag, although the city was granted a coat of arms which featured a lion in 1911. During the occupation of Singapore by the Japanese during the Second World War, the Japanese national flag was used on land by the military and during public events. Soon after the Second World War, Singapore became an independent Crown colony and adopted its own flag. It was modified from the Straits Settlements flag to reduce the number of crowns from three to one. Upon Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s accession to the throne, the crown within the pall was changed to the crown of St. Edward.

Singapore became self-governing within the British Empire on 3 June 1959. Six months later, upon the installation of the new &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Negara&quot; (head of state) on 3 December 1959, the national flag was officially adopted, along with the state coat of arms and the national anthem &quot;Majulah Singapura&quot; (&quot;Onward Singapore&quot;). Then-deputy prime minister Toh Chin Chye discussed the creation of the national flag in a 1989 interview:

The design of the flag was completed in two months by a committee headed by Toh. He initially wanted the flag&#x27;s entire background to be red, but the Cabinet decided against this, as red was regarded as a rallying point for communism. Toh had opposed a red-and-white design as he considered it too similar to the flags of Indonesia and Poland, but the proposals for all-red, all-blue or blue-and-white designs were rejected. The flag, according to Toh, originally had only three stars (representing democracy, justice, and equality), but two more stars and a crescent were added later to distance it from the Malayan Communist Party emblem and to assure the Malay-Muslim community that Singapore was &quot;not a Chinese state&quot;. According to an account given by Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese majority wanted stars based on the flag of the People&#x27;s Republic of China while the Malay minority wanted a crescent moon to represent Islam. Both of these symbols were combined to create the national flag of Singapore.

On 30 November 1959, the Singapore State Arms and Flag and National Anthem Ordinance 1959 was passed to regulate the use and display of the State Arms and State Flag and the performance of the National Anthem. When presenting the motion to the Legislative Assembly of Singapore on 11 November 1959, Sinnathamby Rajaratnam, the Minister for Culture, stated: &quot;National flags, crest and anthem express symbolically the hopes and ideals of a people... The possession of a national flag and crest is, for a people, symbolic of self-respect.&quot;

In September 1962, the people of Singapore voted for merger with Malaya, Sarawak, and North Borneo to form Malaysia. The process was completed on 16 September 1963, when the Malaysian flag was hoisted on Singapore by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. The Singapore flag was reconfirmed as the national flag when Singapore became fully independent from Malaysia on 9 August 1965.

==Design==
The National Symbols Act defines the flag&#x27;s composition and the symbolism of its elements: red symbolises &quot;universal fellowship and equality&quot;, and white symbolises &quot;pervading and everlasting purity and virtue&quot;. The crescent moon represents a &quot;young nation on the ascendant&quot;. The five stars stand for the nation&#x27;s ideals of &quot;democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality&quot;. The crescent symbol is also seen by the nation&#x27;s Muslim activists to represent Islam. 

The ratio of the flag is two units high by three units wide. For the manufacturing of flags, the Government of Singapore stated that the shade of red used on the flag is Pantone 032. According to guidelines published by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MICA), the flag may be reproduced in any size and displayed at all times, but it must be in its specified proportions and colours. MICA recommends the sizes , and . The material that is recommended for the national flag is bunting wool.

==Regulations and guidelines==
The Singaporean government dictates that no person may treat the national flag with disrespect, such as allowing the flag to touch the ground. The flag must not be displayed below any other flag, emblem or object; dipped in salute to any person or thing; or displayed or carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free. The use and display of the flag is governed by the National Symbols Act (until 2023 governed by Part III of the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules made under the &quot;Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Act&quot;). It was an offence to knowingly contravene specified provisions of the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules; the penalty was a fine not exceeding S$1,000.

Within Singapore, the national flag takes precedence over all other flags, subject to international practice. As such, when it is displayed or flown with other flags, it must be in a position of honour; that is, it should be positioned, where practical, either above all other flags or, if displayed side by side with other flags on the same level, to the left of the other flags (as seen by a person facing the flags). When the flag is raised or carried in a procession with other flags, it must be done so in front of the other flags in a single file, or on the right as seen by the standard bearers if the flags are carried side by side (i.e., on the left as seen by the viewer). The standard bearer must carry the flag high on his or her right shoulder.

When the flag is displayed on a platform or stage, it must be above all decorations and be behind and above any person speaking from the platform or stage. If it is displayed from a staff standing on the platform or stage, it must be on the right side of the person speaking from the platform or stage. Finally, when the flag is hung, it must be hung against a vertical wall or other vertical flat surface, with the crescent and stars on the top left position as seen by any spectator facing the flag and the wall or surface.

When the flag is displayed outside a building, it shall be displayed on or in front of the building only from a flagpole. If the flag is flown at night, it should be properly illuminated. Permission must be sought for the flag to be displayed on any motor vehicle except on one in which the President of Singapore or any Government minister is travelling on official business, and for display on any private vessel or aircraft.

Permission must be sought for use or application of the flag or any image of it for any commercial purposes or as part of any furnishing, decoration, covering or receptacle, except in such circumstances as may be approved (by MICA) in which there is no disrespect for the flag. Further, it is not permitted to use the flag as part of any trademark, or to produce or display any flag which bears any graphics or word superimposed on the design of the national flag.

The government may ask for the flag to be lowered to half-mast in the event of the death of an important person or for national mourning. No person is permitted to use the flag at any private funeral ceremony. However, the national flag can be draped on a coffin during a military or state funeral. No person may display any flag that is damaged or dirty. Any worn out or damaged flag should be packed into a sealed black trash bag before being disposed of and not left visible in dustbins.

===Relaxations on its usage===
The flag was originally exclusively used on or in front of buildings owned by the government, ministries, statutory boards and educational institutions on a year-round basis. The flag could only be flown by individuals and non-governmental organisations during the month of August to mark the country&#x27;s national day on 9 August. 

These restrictions on individuals and non-governmental organisations were relaxed in 2004 to allow the flag to be flown year-round under certain conditions. No rationale was provided for the changes, although BBC News correspondents noted that the government had recently been trying to rally patriotic sentiment dampened by economic issues.

Following requests by Singaporeans, guidelines for the use of the flag were further broadened in 2006. MICA permitted the display of the flag on vehicles and on themselves or belongings with minimal restrictions, from the middle of July to the end of August for a trial period. The period was extended in 2007 to three months from July to September. Rules were further relaxed in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic to allow the flag to be flown from April to September, though this was not extended.

In 2022, the National Symbols Bill was passed, which replaces the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Act, and defines new national symbols while allowing greater flexibility in the use of the national symbols. Under the new Bill, the President can make regulations on the use of national and presidential symbols while a prescribed person such as the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth can permit or prohibit the use of national symbols in appropriate situations. The Act took effect 1 August 2023.

==Use of the national flag==


===National Day celebrations===
Singaporeans are encouraged to display the national flag outside their homes during National Day celebrations, and residents&#x27; committees, particularly those of public housing estates, often arrange co-ordinated displays. However, some Singaporeans decline to do so as they associate it with the ruling People&#x27;s Action Party, rather than with the nation. During the period beginning 1 July and ending on 30 September of each year, any person may, without the need for the approval of the Minister under paragraph (4), &quot;incorporate the Flag or an image thereof as part of any costume or attire except that he shall do so in a manner that does not give rise to any disrespect to the Flag&quot;.

On National Day in 2007 at the Padang, 8,667 volunteers holding up red and white umbrellas formed the largest-ever representation of Singapore&#x27;s flag at an event organised by Young NTUC, a youth movement associated with the National Trades Union Congress.

===At other times===

Outside the National Day celebrations period, the national flag of Singapore is flown from all buildings housing government and government-related departments, such as armed forces installations, court houses, offices, and educational institutions. A picture of the flag is commonly found in each classroom, and schools conduct ceremonies at the beginning of the school day at which the national flag is raised, the national anthem is sung and the national pledge is taken.

The national flag is sometimes flown by Singapore-registered vessels, although this is considered incorrect, as such vessels are required to hoist proper national colours either when entering or leaving port. The ensign is red and charged with a circle enclosing a crescent surmounted by five stars in a circle, all in white.

The Singapore Government makes announcements regarding the lowering of the flag to half-mast in the event of a death of an important personage or mourning affecting the nation. The flag has been flown at half-mast during the funerals of former presidents and senior politicians, on 9 January 2005 as a mark of respect for those who perished in the 2004 Asian tsunami disaster, and 19 September 2022 on the day of the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.

===In popular culture===
Singaporean composer Lim Su Chong composed a song in 1969 entitled &quot;Five Stars Arising&quot; which took the elements of the national flag as its theme. The lyrics of the song speak of a new moon, five stars and a new flag &quot;arising out of the stormy sea&quot;. The moon is &quot;youthful and bright and bearing hope, and tranquil as can be&quot;, each of the stars is &quot;a lamp to guide our way; a lamp for all to see&quot; and the flag is &quot;crimson as the blood of all mankind, yet white and pure and free&quot;. The song is one of Singapore&#x27;s patriotic songs and often sung during National Day celebrations. 

There have been several notable cases on the misuse of the flag. In January 2003, Singaporean artist Justin Lee Chee Kong was prevented by the Media Development Authority (MDA) from exhibiting a painting entitled &quot;Double Happiness— A Fantasy in Red&quot;, which consisted of the flag with red Chinese characters for double happiness on it. The MDA cited the move on the grounds that &quot;the National Flag is a national symbol and no words or graphics should be superimposed on it&quot;. Lee reported that the work was simply a display of one&#x27;s love for their country and an expression of joy at Singapore&#x27;s success, and in a press statement, he asked that the piece be &quot;treated as an artistic and complimentary interpretation of a national icon&quot;. When interviewed by &quot;The New Paper&quot;, he said &quot;I know as a citizen that we are not allowed to do it, but this is art and I am an artist.&quot; He also complained about double standards as a Chinese artist, Gu Wen Da, had recently exhibited a national flag made of hair at the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay. Lee felt the use of hair to create the nation&#x27;s flag meant that the flag was in the wrong colours, and was distasteful.

The Rolling Stones performed in Singapore as part of their 2002/2003 Licks World Tour. At the first performance, there were two inflatable dolls on stage. Both of the dolls had flags placed in their crotch area; one had the Rolling Stones logo and the other had a Singapore flag. The dolls and the flags were removed from the second concert by the organiser.

In August 2007, a Singaporean pub, Loof, sent an email to at least 1,500 members on its mailing list featuring a close-up shot of the crotch of a female model wearing a red swimsuit or pair of underpants bearing the crescent and five stars. This was done as part of the pub&#x27;s publicity campaign for its National Day events. According to Loof&#x27;s marketing manager, &quot;[T]he ad was definitely not meant as an insult to the country or anyone. I hope that the ad will be taken in the spirit of humour and fun.&quot; A majority of people polled by &quot;The New Paper&quot; felt the advertisement was disrespectful and in bad taste. MICA eventually stated that the advertisement did not breach the law as it did not fully incorporate the flag&#x27;s design, with the red and white background being left out. However, director of MICA&#x27;s National Resilience Division K.U. Menon said: &quot;MICA does not encourage such ads which treat the national flag with disrespect. [...] Symbols should be treated with some measure of dignity and we hope Loof will withdraw the ad on its own initiative.&quot;

During the 2010 Asian Games held in China, the Singaporean men&#x27;s water polo team&#x27;s swim trunks came under controversy for inappropriately displaying the crescent moon positioned in the centre of the brief, directly over the crotch area. Critics deemed the garment insulting and an embarrassment to the country. The team was unable to modify the design further as competition rules did not permit the changing of a uniform midway through the Games. The team was apologetic over the blunder and promised to tweak the design after the competition. The garment had been designed by the team without prior approval from the authorities.

==Variant flags==
In addition to the national flag and ensigns, there are other flags used for official purposes.

<text>The Holy Island or Holy Isle () is an island in the Firth of Clyde, off the west coast of central Scotland, inside Lamlash Bay on the larger Isle of Arran. The island is around long and around wide. Its highest point is the hill Mullach Mòr.

== History ==
The island has a long history as a sacred site, with a spring or holy well held to have healing properties, the hermit cave of 6th century monk St Molaise, and evidence of a 13th-century monastery. An old Gaelic name for the island was &quot;Eilean MoLaise&quot;, Molaise&#x27;s Island; this is the origin (via &quot;Elmolaise&quot; and &quot;Limolas&quot;) of &quot;Lamlash&quot;, the name of the village on Arran that faces Holy Island.

Some runic writing is to be found on the roof of St Molaise&#x27;s cave and a Viking fleet sheltered between Arran and Holy Isle before the Battle of Largs.

In 1549, Dean Monro wrote of the &quot;little ile callit the yle of Molass, quherin there was foundit by Johne, Lord of the iles, ane monastry of friars, which is decayit.&quot;

==Current ownership==
In 1992, the island was in the possession of Kay Morris, a devout Catholic who reportedly had a dream in which the Virgin Mary instructed her to give ownership of the island to the Samyé Ling Buddhist Community, who belong to the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. The settlements on the island include the &quot;Centre for World Peace and Health&quot;, founded by Lama Yeshe Losal Rinpoche, on the north of the island. This is an environmentally designed residential centre for courses and retreats which extends the former farm house. It has solar water heating and a reed-bed sewage treatment system. The approach from the ferry jetty is decorated with Tibetan flags and stupas. On the southern end of the island lives a community of nuns who are undertaking three-year retreats.

The remainder of the island is treated as a nature reserve with wild Eriskay ponies, Saanen goats, Soay sheep and the replanting of native trees. The rare Rock Whitebeam tree is found on the island, an essential link in the evolution of the Arran Whitebeam species, &quot;Sorbus arranensis&quot;, &quot;Sorbus pseudofennica&quot; and &quot;Sorbus pseudomeinichii&quot;. These are indigenous and unique to Arran.

There is a regular ferry service from Lamlash, and the island is popular with holiday makers staying on Arran. The usually resident population was recorded as 31 in 2011, an increase from 13 in 2001.

<doc id="345428" wikidata="Q296583" url="?curid=345428" title="Bryan Robson">
<text>Bryan Robson (born 11 January 1957) is an English football manager and former player. He began his career with West Bromwich Albion in 1972, where he amassed over 200 appearances and was club captain, before moving to Manchester United in 1981, where he became the longest-serving captain in the club&#x27;s history. He won two Premier Leagues, three FA Cups, one Football League Cup, two FA Charity Shields and a European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup during his time there. Nicknamed &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, Robson was voted in August 2011 as the greatest ever Manchester United player in a poll of the club&#x27;s former players as part of a book, &quot;19&quot;, released to celebrate the club&#x27;s record-breaking 19th league title.

Robson represented England on 90 occasions between 1980 and 1991, making him at the time the fifth-most capped England player. His goalscoring tally of 26 placed him eighth on the list at the time. He played for England at the 1982, 1986 and 1990 World Cups, and at Euro 1988. Robson captained his country 65 times; only Bobby Moore and Billy Wright have captained England on more occasions.

Robson began his management career as a player-manager with Middlesbrough in 1994, retiring from playing in 1997. In seven years as Middlesbrough manager, he guided them to three Wembley finals, which were all lost, and earned them promotion to the Premier League on two occasions. Between 1994 and 1996, he also served as assistant coach to England manager Terry Venables, which included Euro 96. He later returned to West Bromwich Albion for two years as manager, helping them become the first top division team in 14 years to avoid relegation after being bottom of the league table on Christmas Day. Less successful have been his short-lived spells as manager of Bradford City and Sheffield United, the former lasting barely six months and ending in relegation from what is now the EFL Championship, and the latter lasting less than a year and seeing his expensively-assembled side fail to challenge for promotion to the Premier League. On 23 September 2009, Robson was appointed manager of the Thailand national team. He resigned on 8 June 2011. On 1 July 2011, Robson was appointed &quot;Global Ambassador&quot; at Manchester United.

==Early life==
Robson was born in Northlands, Chester-le-Street, County Durham, to Brian, a long distance lorry-driver, and Maureen Robson. He was the second of four children, after sister Susan and ahead of younger brothers Justin and Gary (also footballers). Robson was brought up in Witton Gilbert until he was six, when the family moved to nearby Chester-le-Street, the town where he was born. As a boy, he supported Newcastle United; his childhood hero was Newcastle forward Wyn Davies. A keen footballer from a young age, he joined the local Cub Scout group purely so that he could play for their football team. Robson attended Birtley South Secondary Modern School, and later, Lord Lawson of Beamish comprehensive school, where he competed for the school in athletics and football. He was captain of both his school football team and the Washington and District team. As a teenager, he had trials with Burnley, Coventry City, Sheffield Wednesday, Newcastle United and West Bromwich Albion.

Robson was in the final academic year of pupils who still had the option of finishing education at the age of 15, and in the summer of 1972, he accepted Albion manager Don Howe&#x27;s offer of a two-year apprenticeship, worth a wage of £5 per week in the first year and £8 per week in the second year.

==Club career==

===West Bromwich Albion===
Towards the end of the 1973–74 season, his second as an apprentice, Robson made his reserve team debut, against Everton reserves at Goodison Park. He signed a professional contract in the summer of 1974, earning £28 per week plus a £250 signing on fee. During the 1974–75 season, he was a regular in Albion&#x27;s reserve team, but was not selected by Don Howe for the first team. Following Howe&#x27;s departure with three matches of the season remaining, Robson was called up to the senior team for the first time by caretaker manager Brian Whitehouse. He made his first team debut away at York City on 12 April 1975 at the age of 18, helping Albion to a 3–1 victory. In the following game, his home debut, he scored his first goal for the club, in a 2–0 win over Cardiff City, and also scored in the final match of the season away at Nottingham Forest.

During the following season, Robson played only sporadically. He faced stiff competition for midfield places, not least from player-manager Johnny Giles, and was utilised by Giles in various positions, including centre-half, left-back and midfield. Albion finished third in Division Two to win promotion back to the top-flight.

Robson experienced top-flight football for the first time during the 1976–77 season, and began to appear more regularly in the side, although he was still alternating between the positions of left back and his preferred central midfield role. His rapid progress was halted however, when he received the first serious injury of his career. Playing at left back, he broke his left leg in a tackle with Tottenham Hotspur striker Chris Jones. Two months later, Robson made his comeback in a reserve game at The Hawthorns, but the original break was refractured in a challenge with Stoke City&#x27;s Denis Smith. Again he recovered, and returned to the first team in late December. He went on to enjoy a run in the side and scored his first professional hat-trick, in a 4–0 win against Ipswich Town on 16 March 1977. One month later however, he broke his right ankle in a challenge with Manchester City&#x27;s Dennis Tueart, causing him to pull out of the England under-23 squad following his call-up.

Giles left Albion at the end of the 1976–77 eason. His successor, the club&#x27;s chief scout and former player Ronnie Allen, picked Robson to replace Giles in central midfield. However, Allen himself left midway through the season and defender John Wile was put in temporary charge. Results worsened and Robson was dropped from the team. He returned to the side under new boss Ron Atkinson, whom Robson described as &quot;a down-to-earth, fair-minded, regular bloke&quot;. Atkinson did leave Robson out of an FA Cup semi-final against Ipswich Town, but recalled him for the latter stages of the league campaign as Albion qualified for the UEFA Cup. In the 1978–79 season, Robson was a key player, starting 41 out of 42 league games and wearing the number 7 shirt on each occasion. He played a major part in Albion finishing third in Division One, their highest league placing for more than 20 years, and reaching the UEFA Cup quarter-finals. The following season was a disappointing one by comparison, with the club finishing only 10th in the league, but Robson&#x27;s performances in midfield helped to earn him his first full England cap in February 1980. In the 1980–81 season, he scored ten goals in 40 league games to help Albion to a 4th-place finish in the First Division.

Atkinson left to take over at Manchester United in June 1981, and speculation mounted that Robson would either follow him to United or join Bob Paisley&#x27;s Liverpool. Albion offered Robson a new contract worth £1,000 per week, but he turned it down and put in a transfer request. His teammate Remi Moses signed for United in September 1981 and Robson followed soon afterwards.

===Manchester United===
Robson moved to United for a British record transfer fee of £1.5 million on 1 October 1981 and signed the contract on the Old Trafford pitch two days later before a game against Wolverhampton Wanderers. The record fee set by Robson was not broken for six years, when Liverpool paid £1.9 million for Newcastle striker Peter Beardsley in the summer of 1987. Robson made his United debut on 7 October 1981 in a 1–0 defeat away at Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup. His league debut for his new club came three days later, in a goalless draw against Manchester City at Maine Road. This was his first appearance in the Manchester United number 7 shirt, which he wore for most of his appearances with United. Robson scored his first goal for United on 7 November 1981 in a 5–1 win over Sunderland at Roker Park. He ended his first season at United with 32 games and five goals for a United side who finished third in the league.

Robson tore his ankle ligaments during the 1983 League Cup semi-final victory over Arsenal, meaning that he missed the final, which United lost to Liverpool. He regained his fitness in time for the FA Cup semi-final, again against Arsenal, and scored in a 2–1 win. The final against Brighton ended in a 2–2 draw. Robson scored twice in the replay, but declined the chance to become the first player in 30 years to score an FA Cup final hat-trick, instead allowing regular penalty taker Arnold Muhren to convert a spot-kick to seal a 4–0 victory and enable Robson to lift his first trophy as United captain. Although this was United&#x27;s fifth FA Cup triumph, Robson was only the second English captain to lift the trophy for United, and their first since Charlie Roberts in the 1909 final; as United had been captained by an Irishman in their 1948 and 1963 triumphs and a Scotsman in 1977.

The following season, Robson helped the club enjoy a memorable run in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup – the club&#x27;s best European run for 15 years. Robson scored twice in the 3–0 quarter-final second leg victory over Barcelona at Old Trafford, overturning a 2–0 first leg deficit to progress 3–2 on aggregate. He missed both legs of the semi-final defeat by Juventus due to a hamstring injury, but while in Turin for the second leg was given permission by United to speak to Juve regarding a proposed transfer. The move never took place as neither Juventus nor any other club were prepared to meet United&#x27;s £3 million asking price. Robson&#x27;s injury also meant that he missed several crucial late season games as United&#x27;s title challenge slipped away and they finished fourth, with Liverpool becoming champions for the third successive season and 15th time overall. Robson instead extended his contract with United in 1984, signing a seven-year deal worth around £1 million which would keep him there until at least 1991. United emerged as title challengers again the following season, although the title was eventually won by Everton. He captained the club to another FA Cup triumph, this time over Everton, where a Norman Whiteside goal in extra time denied their opponents the chance of a unique treble, as they had already won the league title and the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

Robson and United began the following season in fine form with ten successive victories which suggested the championship could be on its way back to Old Trafford for the first time since 1967. But their form slipped after Christmas and they finished the season trophyless in fourth place 12 points behind champions Liverpool, 10 points behind runners-up Everton and eight points behind third-placed West Ham United. Injuries, notably a dislocated shoulder suffering in February 1986, restricted Robson to just 21 out of 42 league appearances for United in 1985–86, though he did manage seven goals.

United started the following season badly and Ron Atkinson was sacked as manager in November 1986 and replaced by Alex Ferguson. The new manager had almost completely overhauled the squad within three years, but Robson remained firmly part of his plans. United finished second in the league in 1988, nine points behind champions Liverpool, but a frustrating campaign in 1988–89 saw them finish 11th. Robson remained largely injury free during these seasons.

In 1990, Robson and United finally got their hands on another major trophy after five years of trying. After an injury-hit campaign where United had struggled in the league, Robson scored United&#x27;s first goal in the FA Cup final against Crystal Palace in the first match which ended in a 3–3 draw. United won the replay 1–0 and Robson thus became the first United captain to lift the cup three times. Robson had faced his familiar fight against injury once again in that 1989–90 season, restricted to 20 appearances out of 38 in the league, as United finished 13th – their lowest finish since relegation in 1974. Robson&#x27;s testimonial match took place on 20 November 1990 and saw United lose 3–1 to Celtic at Old Trafford. During the 1990–91 season, he was restricted to 17 league appearances due to an injury suffered at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, and didn&#x27;t make a first team appearance until just before Christmas. During his absence, United had been captained by fellow midfielder Neil Webb, but Robson regained the captain&#x27;s armband on his return.

Robson was fit for the European Cup Winners Cup final in which United beat Barcelona 2–1 in Rotterdam, with both goals coming from Mark Hughes.

Robson was still a regular choice for United during the 1991–92 season despite competition from much younger players including Webb, Paul Ince and Andrei Kanchelskis. During that season, he made his 90th and final appearance for the England team, who by this stage were being managed by Graham Taylor. But the season ended in disappointment for Robson as United were overhauled in the First Division championship race by Leeds United. He missed their League Cup final victory over Nottingham Forest through injury and his first-team chances were starting to look increasingly numbered as he faced competition from other players within the United squad and the press reported that Ferguson was hoping to sign a new, younger midfielder, although no such addition took place in 1992.

Robson still captained the club in most of his first-team appearances, but Steve Bruce was captaining the side when Robson was absent. Robson made just 14 league appearances during the 1992–93 season, which was the first season of the new Premier League. The club&#x27;s regular central midfielders for this season were Ince (who had been at United since 1989) and Brian McClair (who was shifted from the attacking positions following the late November arrival of Eric Cantona), while his other favoured position on the right side of midfield was either occupied by Mike Phelan or the younger, wider-lying Kanchelskis and Lee Sharpe. With the introduction of squad numbers for the 1993–94 Premier League, Robson was issued with the number 12 shirt, while the number 7 shirt that he had worn in virtually every game of his career went to Cantona instead.

Robson scored on the final day of the season against Wimbledon – it was his only goal of that campaign. By that point, United were Premier League champions and Robson finally won the league championship medal that he had been trying to gain since his days at West Bromwich Albion some 15 years earlier. It was not just injuries that were restricting the 36-year-old Robson&#x27;s first-team chances. Cantona had been signed during the 1992–93 season and played up front with Hughes, while Hughes&#x27; former strike-partner McClair had been converted into a midfielder. This counted against Robson and the biggest blow came in the summer of 1993 when United signed Forest&#x27;s Roy Keane, but even this did not quite signal the end for him at Manchester United.

Robson was still able to make enough appearances for another Premier League champions medal in the 1993–94 season (15 games, 10 of them as a substitute), and scored one of their four goals in the FA Cup semi-final replay victory over Oldham at Maine Road, which would turn out to be his final goal for the club. He had found the net on the opening day of the season in a 2–0 win at Norwich City. At the age of 36, he finally appeared in Europe&#x27;s top club tournament, the Champions League, with United reaching the second round. Robson scored a late equaliser in the second round first leg clash with Galatasaray, which ended in a 3–3 draw at Old Trafford.

Robson was dropped from the squad for the FA Cup final, a decision which manager Ferguson later admitted was one of the hardest of his career, opting to select the more flexible Sharpe and McClair as the outfield substitutes. His final appearance in a United shirt came on the last day of the league season, 8 May 1994, when United drew 0–0 at home with Coventry City. He had played 461 times for them in all competitions, scoring 99 goals, and was widely regarded as one of their greatest ever players.

===Middlesbrough===
Robson&#x27;s 13-year spell at Manchester United came to an end after nearly 500 appearances and 100 goals in May 1994 when he accepted the role of player-manager at Middlesbrough. From 1994 to 1996, he combined the role with that of England assistant manager (under Terry Venables), and was linked with the manager&#x27;s job when Venables announced his intention to quit after Euro 96, only to rule himself out of the running due to his limited experience. He was not included in new manager Glenn Hoddle&#x27;s coaching staff. In 2015, he expressed regret at turning down the opportunity to manage England.

Robson played his final game as a player on 1 January 1997, in a Premier League game against Arsenal at Highbury 10 days before his 40th birthday. He claimed in his autobiography that he knew it was the right time to retire as his whole body ached for two weeks afterwards trying to keep up with the livewires Dennis Bergkamp and Ian Wright.

==International career==

In the summer of 1975, Robson was called up to the England youth team for the &quot;mini World Cup&quot;. He played as a centre-half during the tournament, which England won, beating Finland 1–0 in the final. He was selected for the England under-21s for the first time in March 1977, but was withdrawn from the squad by his club West Bromwich Albion, who needed him for a league match against Manchester United at Old Trafford. Albion drew 2–2, with Robson scoring one of the goals. On 6 February 1979, he finally made his England under-21 debut, albeit as an overage player (he was 22 at the time) as England beat Wales 1–0 at Swansea&#x27;s Vetch Field. He made his England B debut on 12 June 1979, and scored after just five minutes to give England a 1–0 lead against Austria B in Klagenfurt, although the match was abandoned after 60 minutes. He appeared three times for England B in all, captaining the side on his third and final appearance as England drew 0–0 with Algeria&#x27;s A team in Algiers on 11 December 1990.

On 6 February 1980, Robson made his full international debut, and his first appearance at Wembley, as England beat the Republic of Ireland 2–0 in a UEFA Euro 1980 qualifier. His second cap came in the final preparation game for the finals—a 2–1 win over Australia in Sydney—but he didn&#x27;t feature in the tournament itself, from which England were eliminated in the first round. On 9 September 1981, he marked his 13th cap by scoring his first goal for England, in a 2–1 defeat to Norway in Oslo. The match is remembered mainly for Norwegian commentator Bjørge Lillelien&#x27;s taunting of England following the final whistle.

England coach Ron Greenwood started to feature Robson regularly in his midfield, selecting him for the first dozen internationals after the European Championships finished, including all eight of the qualifying games for the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain, through which England earned a place in the finals. His England career was flourishing as the World Cup neared; he scored in a 4–0 thrashing of Northern Ireland at Wembley and added a brace in the last warm-up game in Helsinki against Finland. Robson was in the record books for 20 years thanks to a goal scored against France in England&#x27;s opening game of the World Cup at Estadio San Mamés, home of Athletic Bilbao. It came after just 27 seconds of the match – the third fastest in World Cup finals history until 2002 when Hakan Şükür scored after ten seconds in the third-place match against South Korea. For his achievement, Robson received an inscribed gold watch, which he still occasionally wears.

Robson captained England for the first time on 17 November 1982, leading the side to a 3–0 win over Greece in Salonika. He scored a hat-trick in England&#x27;s 8–0 victory over Turkey in Istanbul on 14 November 1984. &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, as he was nicknamed, helped England qualify for the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico. By now, he was considered by England manager Bobby Robson to be the best player in England. His hopes of glory were crushed by re-aggravating an existing shoulder injury in England&#x27;s second game of the group stages, against Morocco, which prevented him participating further in the tournament. The enforced change to England&#x27;s formation benefited them, no longer having to protect an injured player, and – despite also losing vice-captain Ray Wilkins to a red card and subsequent ban – successive 3–0 victories resulted, until England&#x27;s run finally came to an end with a 2–1 defeat against Argentina in the quarter final. The same shoulder injury was to trouble him for several weeks after the competition.

Over the next two years, Robson returned to the side to lead them through qualifying for UEFA Euro 1988. He personally played well for England, particularly with a fine individual goal against eventual champions the Netherlands, but was unable to prevent them from going out in the first phase of the competition as England lost all three of their group games.

Robson continued his international career until 1991, also helping England to reach the 1990 FIFA World Cup. For the second World Cup in succession, his role was limited as he once again suffered an injury in the second match (against the Netherlands) that was to keep him out of the rest of the tournament. Likewise, England&#x27;s revamped formation played better without their captain, whose place in the team was taken by David Platt during the knock-out stages, as England finished fourth.

Robson was picked by both Bobby Robson and Tony Adams in their England dream teams, in their respective autobiographies of all the best players they had worked or played with. Adams said additionally that Robson had a &quot;terrific football brain&quot; and had exceptional awareness and anticipation; often intercepting or knowing where the ball would land ahead of other players. Adams said this separated outstanding players from good players, and Robson would fit into the category of &quot;the best&quot;. Paul Gascoigne stated in his 2004 book &quot;Gazza: My Story&quot; that Robson was the best footballer he had ever shared a pitch with and the best player of his generation. Additionally, Peter Beardsley named him in his &quot;Perfect XI&quot; selection, football magazine &quot;Four Four Two&quot;″s interviews with current and former players of their &quot;dream team&quot; selections. His final game for England was a European Championship qualifier played against Turkey in October 1991.

==Style of play==
A well-rounded box-to-box midfielder, Robson had a good goal-scoring record, and strong anticipation, movement, and timing on and off the ball. He was quick, fiercely competitive and brave, and possessed high levels of stamina. He tackled, passed well, and was also a good header of the ball.

==Managerial career==

===Middlesbrough===
Robson had accepted Middlesbrough&#x27;s offer to become player-manager at the end of the 1993–94 season, and made a dream start to his managerial career as the club won the Division One title and promotion to the Premier League. Robson oversaw Boro&#x27;s final season at Ayresome Park before relocation to the new 30,000-seat Riverside Stadium on the banks of the River Tees. He was assisted by Viv Anderson, another former Manchester United and England player.

Middlesbrough made an ambitious return to the Premier League and attracted expensively-signed big names like Nick Barmby and the Brazilians Juninho and Branco. They went fourth in the Premier League in October 1995, sparking hopes of UEFA Cup qualification, but an injury crisis sparked a slump in form and they slid down the table to finish 12th. In the summer of 1996, Robson paid £7 million to sign the Juventus and Italy striker Fabrizio Ravanelli, who became the highest-paid player in English football with a weekly wage of £50,000 as well as being one of the most expensively signed.

In the 1996–97 season, Robson led Boro to both domestic cup finals, but they were on the losing side both times, losing 1–0 in a replay to Leicester City in the League Cup final replay and 2–0 in the FA Cup final to Chelsea, while they suffered relegation in the Premier League. However, this relegation would have been avoided if they had not been deducted three points in mid-season for cancelling a fixture at late notice due to many players being unfit through illness or injury. However, at least Boro had the consolation of staying alive in the league up to the last day of the season. Boro were already bottom of the league at the turn of 1997, but when the points were deducted they found themselves seven points adrift of safety with the 17th placed team having a game in hand. However, results slowly improved over the next few weeks and by the end of March a succession of good results had seen Boro climb out of the relegation zone. This, coupled with the excellent cup runs, saw Robson voted Premier League Manager of the Month for March 1997. Robson made one playing appearance this season on New Years Day, starting in a 2–0 defeat away to Arsenal. This proved to be his last game as a professional footballer, though he did not announce his retirement from playing until later in the season.

Despite these setbacks the board kept faith in Robson and he repaid their loyalty with automatic promotion back to the Premier League in the 1997–98 season. Again, the club missed out on cup success at the final hurdle with a 2–0 defeat against Chelsea in the League Cup final. Boro would remain in the Premier League for the next 11 seasons, with Robson remaining as manager for three of those seasons. They finished ninth in 1999, 12th in 2000 and 14th in 2001.

In November 2000, he criticised his players following a string of poor results which had dragged them into a relegation battle. A month later Middlesbrough brought in former England coach Terry Venables as head coach to assist Robson, who remained as manager. The new managerial partnership saw Boro&#x27;s form improve and they avoided relegation. Robson left the club &quot;by mutual consent&quot; in June 2001, having failed to bring the club higher than ninth in the league, or to bring them any silverware. His successor was Steve McClaren, the Manchester United assistant manager. Despite being linked with a string of managerial vacancies, Robson would not return to management for more than two years.

===Bradford City===
Following the resignation of Mick McCarthy, Robson emerged in January 2003 as the bookmakers&#x27; favourite to become the new Republic of Ireland manager, but the job went instead to Brian Kerr. In November 2003 Robson was set to become Nigeria&#x27;s national coach, but the appointment was blocked by the Nigerian sports minister due to doubts that Robson&#x27;s wage demands could be met. Later that month, Robson did make his football comeback more than two years after leaving Middlesbrough. He accepted the offer to manage Division One strugglers Bradford City. Robson won his first game in charge as Bradford fought back from 2–0 down to beat Millwall 3–2. But he recorded just six more wins as Bradford took only 22 points from 27 games under Robson and were relegated, finishing second from bottom. Robson&#x27;s short-term contract was not renewed and he handed the reins over to his assistant Colin Todd.

===West Bromwich Albion===
Robson&#x27;s third management job began on 9 November 2004, when he agreed to return to his old club West Bromwich Albion as manager – 23 years after his departure as a player. His first match in charge ended in a 2–1 home defeat to his former club Middlesbrough. A 4–0 loss away to local rivals Birmingham City on 18 December meant that Albion were bottom of the Premier League on Christmas Day, a position from which no team had previously escaped relegation from the Premier League. Robson was the subject of derisory chants from Albion supporters during the game, a complete contrast to his status as a club hero when he had taken to the field as a player. The team were also bottom going into the last game of the season. However, Robson and his players defied all the odds to stay up thanks to a 2–0 home win over Portsmouth on the final day of the season, coupled with favourable results from elsewhere. Despite some significant new signings in the 2005 close season, his team failed to build on this achievement in 2005–06 though, and Albion were relegated with two matches left to play. They had failed to win any of their final 13 Premier League games. Robson left the club &quot;by mutual consent&quot; on 18 September 2006, following a disappointing start to the season with The Baggies in 9th place in the Championship with only three wins from their first eight games.

After his departure from West Brom, Robson spent eight months out of the game. He was interested in becoming the England under-21 team&#x27;s full-time manager, but the job went instead to Stuart Pearce on a part-time basis.

===Sheffield United===
On 22 May 2007, it was announced at a press conference that Robson would be the new manager of Sheffield United, following the resignation of Neil Warnock. He was assisted by Brian Kidd, who had been assistant manager at Manchester United during Robson&#x27;s final three seasons there.

His first match in charge was a home match against Colchester United on 11 August in a 2–2 draw. His first win was three days later in a 3–1 win against Chesterfield in the League Cup. United subsequently collected nine points in their first 10 league matches, leaving the Blades in 20th place in the Championship and prompting Robson to comment about the situation. After a string of inconsistent results and a 2–0 derby defeat to Sheffield Wednesday, Robson publicly stated that he had lost patience with his players. Following calls for Robson&#x27;s resignation, Sheffield United chairman Kevin McCabe gave Robson his public backing and called for patience and unity.
Robson has since expressed his disappointment at not having the funds he was expecting to help rebuild the team.

After a 0–0 draw at home to Scunthorpe United on 9 February 2008, Robson came under increasing pressure from fans urging the board to sack the manager. Consequently, Robson was summoned to a meeting in Brussels on 13 February with McCabe, as the club considered its response to the scenes which followed the goalless draw against Scunthorpe. In an interview with BBC Radio Sheffield, Robson stated that his team could have won the match with Scunthorpe if they had better support from the fans. After his meeting with McCabe, on 14 February he was &quot;relieved of his first-team duties&quot; before later in the day leaving Sheffield United after turning down another role with the club.

===Return to Manchester United===
In March 2008, 14 years after he had last played for them, Robson returned to Manchester United to work as an ambassador, for an initial period of 12 months. He worked alongside Sir Bobby Charlton to help United &#x27;promote its commercial and charitable aims&#x27;.

===Thailand national team===
On 23 September 2009, Robson agreed to become coach of the Thailand national team in his first foray into international football management. He was contracted to manage the team through to the 2014 World Cup. On 14 November, Robson celebrated his first competitive match in charge of the team with a 3–1 away victory against Singapore in a 2011 AFC Asian Cup qualifying group match. On 18 November, Robson then suffered his first loss – a 1–0 defeat against Singapore on home soil. In January 2010, this was followed by two goalless draws with Jordan and Iran during qualification. On 3 March 2010, Robson&#x27;s Thailand suffered a 1–0 defeat by the hands of Iran in Tehran in their final Group E game, effectively ending their hopes of qualifying for 2011 AFC Asian Cup.

On 11 August, Robson led Thailand to another victory against Singapore with a score of 1–0 on home soil. In September 2010, Robson overcame Bob Houghton&#x27;s India in a friendly with a score of 2–1 away from home. In December 2010, Robson failed to bring Thailand past the Group A of the 2010 AFF Championship after managing only two draws against Laos and Malaysia and losing to Indonesia. He resigned as manager on 8 June 2011, and has since returned to his role as an Official Club Ambassador for Manchester United.

==Life outside football==

===Personal life===
Robson has been married to his wife Denise since 2 June 1979. Denise is from the Great Barr area and met Robson early on in his playing career with West Bromwich Albion. The couple have three children: Claire (born 17 September 1980), Charlotte (born 17 June 1982), and Ben (born 2 September 1988). In 2000, Robson reportedly had an affair with Sky Sports reporter Clare Tomlinson.

===Illness===
On 16 March 2011, it was revealed that Robson had undergone surgery in Bangkok on 3 March 2011 for throat cancer.

===Other activities===
As a player, Robson endorsed products by adidas, and later New Balance football boots, as well as owning a stake in the Birthdays greeting card chain. He was the subject of the television programme &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in the edition aired on 23 January 1985, at just 12 days after his 28th birthday he was one of the show&#x27;s youngest ever special guests. Robson has appeared in a number of advertisements, including an appearance in Carlsberg&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Best Pub Side&quot; television advert, where he starred alongside other former England players. In 2007, he formed a specialist sports company, Robson Lloyd Consultancy Ltd, with an aim to build community sports academies with long-lasting benefits for small Football clubs. His autobiography, entitled &quot;Robbo: My Autobiography&quot; was released in May 2006.

In March 2010, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; published an article claiming that retired England footballer Steve McMahon and Robson had used their celebrity status to encourage investors to purchase Green belt land plots in Hounslow with a very limited chance of return.

On 18 July 2011, on an episode of the Channel 4 television programme &quot;Dispatches&quot; entitled &quot;How to Buy a Football Club&quot;, Robson was secretly filmed by reporters during an undercover investigation. In the film, Robson describes how the reporters – who posed as businessmen – could break the strict Football Association rules that prevent individuals and/or groups from owning multiple football clubs. He also lists a number of clubs he considers as prime targets for take over.

The borough was formed on 1 April 1974 by the merger of the County Borough of South Shields with the municipal borough of Jarrow and the urban districts of Boldon and Hebburn from County Durham.

Part of the Tyneside conurbation, the sixth largest in the United Kingdom, South Tyneside has a geographical area of and an estimated population of 153,700 (mid-year 2010), measured at the 2011 Census as 148,127. It is bordered to the east by the North Sea and to the north by the River Tyne. A Green Belt of is at its southern boundary.

The main administrative centre and largest town is South Shields. Other riverside towns are Jarrow and Hebburn, while the villages of Cleadon, Whitburn and The Boldons border the South Tyneside green belt, with Wearside to the south at Sunderland.

South Tyneside is represented by two Members of Parliament in two constituencies: South Shields (including Whitburn) and Jarrow and Gateshead East (which also serves Hebburn, the urban fringe villages, and the eastern parts of Gateshead).

==History==
Celts, Romans, Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Vikings, the early 20th century arrival of the Arabs and more recently the settling of people from the Commonwealth, notably the Indian sub-continent, and the European Union reflect the present-day culture of South Tyneside.

In South Shields (, Brythonic: &quot;Caer Urfa&quot;), excavations and a reconstructed fort are found at Arbeia (AD 160). This fort served as a garrison and an outpost of the Roman Empire, and is part of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall World Heritage Site. The hospitality strip at Ocean Road is famed throughout the region for its Indian, Italian, Middle Eastern and Chinese cuisine. Mill Dam, with former Customs House (now a theatre, cinema and arts complex), cobbled lanes and Mission to Seafarers centre, relate to the history of shipping in the town and the River Tyne.

Bede&#x27;s World in Jarrow () is dedicated to the life of the Venerable Bede, the &#x27;Father of English History&#x27;. The nominated World Heritage Site is straddled by two rivers – the Tyne and the Don. There is a medieval monastery (St. Paul&#x27;s Church, AD 681), an Anglo-Saxon farm with rare-breed animals and buildings constructed in original materials from that period, and the Georgian Jarrow Hall. The Jarrow Crusade of 1936 was a key event in the town&#x27;s history and the original banner carried by the marchers to London can be viewed at Jarrow Town Hall.

There has been a fairly sizeable Arab community in South Shields since the 1890s. This is also one hypothesised explanation of the term &quot;Sandancer&quot; (derived from &quot;sand dancer&quot;) for people born and brought up in South Shields.

==Council==
South Tyneside Council is formed of 54 members. As of June 2024 this consists of 28 Labour councillors, 11 Green councillors, and 15 independent councillors.

Jonathan Tew has been Chief Executive of the authority since 2021.

==Economy==
Shipbuilding and repairing, coal mining and exports, and the chemical industries declined from the latter half of the 20th century, resulting in mass unemployment. In more recent years, however, this trend has reversed and South Tyneside attracts new industries, most notably in the service sector. There is still a considerable manufacturing base of ship-repair and offshore services, engineering, electronics, clothing, furniture, paper products, timber and small precision engineering.

At one time, Tyneside built 25% of the world&#x27;s ships. South Tyneside College specialises in maritime training and attracts students from around the world.

Tourism is also an important and growing industry.

==Places of interest==
South Shields town centre and riverside are undergoing significant regeneration, with new housing, business, retail and leisure uses replacing old industrial sites. The town centre offers high street shopping, a regular market by the Grade I listed old town hall, a new library and exhibition space called The Word, the head post office, museum and art gallery, a new bus/Metro interchange opened in 2019, cross-river pedestrian ferry to North Shields, Harton Quays office development and promenade, the town hall and civic offices. The Customs House is located within the historic Mill Dam conservation area and hosts a theatre, cinema, art gallery and restaurant. Arbeia formed the easternmost extremity of the Roman Empire at Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and is located at the mouth of the River Tyne on the North Sea coast. Excavations, a reconstructed fort and museum are open to the public on the historic Lawe Top site (Old English: hill top).

The Great North Run is the world&#x27;s biggest half marathon and takes place every September/October, starting in Newcastle and finishing on The Leas at South Shields.

On the coast road to Whitburn is Marsden Rock – an impressive limestone sea stack colonised by sea birds and a longstanding tourist attraction. Further down the coast is Souter Lighthouse, the first in the world to be powered by electric current. Much of the coastal scenery in this area was, until two decades ago, dominated by the spoil heaps and pit head winding gear of Westoe and Whitburn collieries, but these are now gone and the area&#x27;s natural environment has been restored.

Jarrow is home to St. Paul&#x27;s Monastery, Bede&#x27;s World museum, Jarrow Hall, the Viking Shopping Centre and the J. Barbour and Sons headquarters and factory outlet.

Hebburn riverside has open views of the renewable and offshore-related industries across-river at Wallsend. The town centre has undergone redevelopment with new residential building and civic and leisure facilities.

The suburban villages of Cleadon, East and West Boldon, Harton, Monkton, Westoe and Whitburn have traditional pubs, historic buildings and independent boutiques. There is an athletics track at Monkton and cricket grounds at Westoe and Whitburn.

==Environment==
The physical environment of South Tyneside varies greatly in a small area: from the bustling riverside towns of South Shields, Jarrow and Hebburn to the urban fringe villages of Boldon, Cleadon and Whitburn; from established industrial areas at the Port of Tyne and Tyne Dock riverside to new business parks at Monkton, St Hilda&#x27;s and Boldon; from the highest point at Cleadon Hills down to the River Don estuary at St Paul&#x27;s and Bede&#x27;s World; from traditional Victorian terraces and impressive Edwardian mansions to typical inter- and post-war suburban housing; from the remains and reconstructed gatehouse of Arbeia Roman Fort to the UK&#x27;s first purpose built mosque at Laygate; from the great River Tyne to the expanse of Shields Harbour at Littlehaven; from the stunning natural coastline of The Leas and the sandy beaches, bays and limestone cliffs at Marsden Bay and Whitburn to the traditional seaside parks, amusements and funfair at South Shields seafront; and from Marsden Quarry to the Great North Forest.

The EcoCentre at Hebburn is a building constructed from recycled materials, self-reliant in power generation by means of its own wind turbine and is efficient in waste management. There is also a local authority-managed wind turbine at Middlefields.

The weather in South Tyneside as with the rest of the North East region is variable and typical of a Maritime Climate.

In 2019, South Tyneside Council declared a Climate Emergency. The motion was proposed by South Tyneside Green Party councillor David Francis, and amended by Labour, the amendment was successful and South Tyneside Council is expected to reach net-zero by 2030.

==Transport==
The A194(M), A19 and other trunk roads link South Tyneside to the national road network. The Tyne &amp; Wear Metro is a light rail system connecting the area with the rest of the Tyne &amp; Wear conurbation, including Sunderland and Newcastle station and Newcastle Airport. The Tyne Road and Pedestrian Tunnels traverse the river between Jarrow and Howdon. A pedestrian ferry also serves the towns of North and South Shields. The Port of Tyne situated at Tyne Dock is a growing terminal handling large volumes of freight, including exports from the Nissan car plant in Washington.

==People==
Well-known South Tynesiders include author Dame Catherine Cookson, former three times Prime Minister of New Zealand Sir William Fox, actress Dame Flora Robson, Monty Python actor Eric Idle, Hollywood director Ridley Scott, waxed jacket inventor J Barbour and athlete Steve Cram. Author Lewis Carroll was inspired to write &#x27;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&#x27; and &#x27;Through the Looking-Glass&#x27; by local residents he met when staying in Whitburn. Singer Joe McElderry who won the 2009 X Factor also comes from the area as well as two members of 2011 X Factor winners Little Mix, Jade Thirlwall and Perrie Edwards.

==Sister cities==
South Tyneside is twinned with Épinay-sur-Seine, France; Noisy-le-Sec, France; and Wuppertal, Germany

==Climate==
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).

<text>The Cingalee or Sunny Ceylon is an Edwardian musical comedy in two acts by James T. Tanner, with music by Lionel Monckton, lyrics by Adrian Ross and Percy Greenbank, and additional material by Paul Rubens. The story is set in the Edwardian era in the then-tranquil island of Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka) and follows the story of British colonial tea planters (one of the most popular songs in the score is called &quot;Tea, tea, tea&quot;).

The piece opened at Daly&#x27;s Theatre in London, managed by George Edwardes, on 5 March 1904 and ran until 11 March 1905 for a total of 365 performances. The setting in an exotic Asian locale followed the precedent set by &quot;The Mikado&quot; that was continued in &quot;The Geisha&quot;, &quot;San Toy&quot;, &quot;The Nautch Girl&quot;, &quot;A Chinese Honeymoon&quot; and others. There is little in the music to give &quot;The Cingalee&quot; an Eastern flavour. However, Monckton&#x27;s catchy sextet, &quot;The Island of Gay Ceylon&quot;, his &quot;Pearl of Sweet Ceylon&quot; and Ruben&#x27;s &quot;White and Brown Girl&quot;, &quot;Sloe Eyes&quot;, &quot;Monkeys&quot; and &quot;You and I&quot; are highlights of the musical score. The London cast included Hayden Coffin, Rutland Barrington, Huntley Wright and Isabel Jay. A young Lily Elsie also appeared in the show, as did Topsy Sinden.

The musical had a short Broadway run, opening at Daly&#x27;s Theatre in New York on 24 October 1904, and running for 33 performances. A production in Sydney, Australia, in May 1905 by J C Williamson&#x27;s Royal Comic Opera Company, opened on 6 May, starring Margaret Thomas as Nanoya.

==Plot==
A tea plantation in Ceylon has been purchased by a young Englishman, Harry Vereker, who falls in love with Nanoya, one of his Cingalese workers, and proposes marriage. Unbeknownst to him, however, she was married at the age of four to the potentate of Boobhamba, a noble of Kandy; she is also the former owner of the plantation. To escape from this marriage to the hated despot, she has disguised herself. An unethical lawyer, Chambuddy Ram, had persuaded Harry to buy the plantation.

Sir Peter Loftus, the High Commissioner of Ceylon, accuses Ram of hiding Nanoya and of stealing a famous black pearl belonging to Boobhamba, and he orders Ram to return both within 24 hours to avoid dire consequences. Ram had given the pearl to Lady Patricia Vane. Peggy Sabine, a governess, subsequently won the pearl from Patricia in London as a bridge stake. Harry has now purchased the pearl from Peggy as a gift for Nanoya, and Ram hands them both over to Sir Peter and Boobhamba.

At his moonlit palace, Boobhamba identifies the members of his harem by dressing each wife in a different colour. Because he has a nearly complete rainbow of wifely colours, he has room for only one more wife. At a lucky moment, he finds one that he prefers to Nanoya, so she is freed from her obligation to fulfill her childhood marriage and can marry Harry.

==Synopsis==
;Act I – Henry Vereker&#x27;s Tea Plantation, &quot;Karagama,&quot; Ceylon
Seventeen year old Nanoya is a Cingalese girl who had been betrothed at the age of four to the potentate of Boobhamba as one of his many wives, each dressed in a different colour to prevent mistakes and consequent jealousy. To avoid this fate, she had absconded and gone to work on a tea plantation belonging to Harry Vereker (but which has been fraudulently leased to him by a rascally lawyer, Chambuddy Ram). Harry falls in love with Nanoya and wishes to marry her. Chambuddy has also expropriated a famous black pearl that formerly sat in the forehead of a great idol. It has found its way to London and, after a convoluted set of adventures, Harry buys it to adorn his intended. Prince Boobhamba appeals to the British High Commissioner against Chambuddy, who is ordered to produce both Nanoya and the pearl within 24 hours. By chance he learns the true identity of Nanoya, and she is handed over, together with the pearl, to the Court.

;Act II – Boobhamba&#x27;s Palace by the Lake of Kandy
Harry, his mentor Lady Patricia Vane, Nanoya&#x27;s &quot;teacher of deportment&quot; Peggy Sabine and Chambuddy, to bolster his own position, all seek to rescue Nanoya from her fate, to inevitable failure. Boobhamba then capriciously decides to marry Peggy Sabine instead, but she has words to say about that, and Chambuddy, in love with Peggy himself, wordily backs her up. So Harry pairs off with Nanoya, Chambuddy pairs off with Peggy and Boobhamba is left with his existing harem.

==Critical reception==
Contemporary critics were overwhelmingly enamoured of the musical. &quot;&quot;The Cingalee&quot; has all the elements that make for long runs. It is elaborately set and staged, charmingly dressed; the music is in Mr. Monckton&#x27;s best vein, and the lyrics ... abound with graceful and well-turned lines&quot;, said &quot;The Stage&quot;. The &quot;St James&#x27;s Gazette&quot; noted that the first performance was &quot;received with rapture on Saturday night by an enthusiastic audience and played with the most admirable vivacity and smoothness by a brilliant company&quot;. In Lionel Monckton&#x27;s music, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; saw &quot;a distinct leaning towards the traditions of genuine comic opera, and in this connection it is pleasant to find that what may be called the Savoy manner has served its composer as a bright answer&quot;. &quot;The Standard&quot; agreed, judging that &quot;on the whole, this will be set down as decidedly the best of [Monckton&#x27;s] scores&quot;.

Several critics commented that the second act was dramatically, if not visually, less effective than the first, although they offered different reasons, and a few papers regarded the piece ripe for pruning. &quot;The Daily News&quot; stated that &quot;a rather long interval helped to prolong the performance until close on midnight&quot;. &quot;The Globe&quot; agreed that four hours was &quot;a little too much&quot; but thought &quot;the task of condensation will be easy&quot;.

&quot;The Cingalee&quot; toured the British provinces but then was only remounted on small scales and only up to the pre-war 1940&#x27;s. The condescending racial nature of the musical&#x27;s libretto would be unacceptable today, and so the work is unlikely to be revived.

==Litigation==
;The &quot;Cingalee&quot; Case – &quot;Fraser v. Edwardes&quot; [1905–10] Mac. C.C., 22–27 March 1905
Captain Frederick John Fraser of the Indian Army sued George Edwardes, as producer of &quot;The Cingalee&quot;, in 1905 in King&#x27;s Bench before Mr Justice Darling. Fraser had written a comic opera called &quot;Hanjiahn, or The Lotus Girl&quot;. He took this to Edwardes, who agreed to produce the opera within three years or pay a penalty of £300. Edwardes suggested that Fraser work with James T. Tanner to develop the work. Eventually, Edwardes returned the manuscript to Fraser unproduced. Tanner went on to write, and Edwardes produced, &quot;The Cingalee&quot;. Fraser sued on the basis of breach of copyright (although the matter was recorded in case law as a breach of confidence), claiming that his scenario had been used without his consent. The defence countered that the libretti were not similar, that all plays hold points in common and that, if anything, both works used &quot;The Geisha&quot; as their model. The jury found that an unfair use had indeed been made of Fraser&#x27;s piece by the appropriation therefrom of characters, plot and other ideas. They assessed the damages at £3,000 plus court costs. The case was noted in the press for the amount and quality of witty repartee among witnesses, counsel and Judge.

A 1930 memoir by one of Fraser&#x27;s legal team assessed that the prosecution had erred by attacking the character of an obviously honourable man and that the previously closely balanced case had been won by a legal ambush on one of the witnesses (his identity hidden in later accounts, but confirmed in contemporary newspaper accounts as the theatrical costume designer, Percy Anderson). Anderson had written a sympathetic letter in April 1904 to the plaintiff indicating that Fraser had been badly treated by Edwardes, but when called as a witness by the defence, Anderson testified in support of Edwardes. The plaintiff&#x27;s counsel produced the forgotten letter in Anderson&#x27;s handwriting and made the unfortunate witness read it to the court &quot;causing some sensation&quot;. The jury, swayed by this evidence, were viewed as too generous in the damages awarded, and the defence appealed, primarily on that basis, with £2,000 being paid into court. An out of court settlement was reached for damages of this £2,000, plus costs, with all imputations by both sides being withdrawn, before the appeal could be argued.

==Recordings==
The first modern recording of a group of numbers from &quot;The Cingalee&quot;, was made in 2003 by Theatre Bel-Etage chorus and orchestra, conductor Mart Sander.

<text>Antti Oskari Tokoi (15 April 1873 – 4 April 1963) was a Finnish socialist politician who served as a leader of the Social Democratic Party of Finland. Tokoi became Chairman of the Senate of Finland in 1917, and thus, he was the world&#x27;s first social democratic leader of the government. During the short-lived Revolution of 1918, Tokoi participated as a leading figure in the revolutionary government. Tokoi later emigrated to the United States, where he served as the long-time editor of &quot;Raivaaja&quot; (The Pioneer), the newspaper of the Finnish Socialist Federation.

==Life and Politics==
===Early years===

Oskari Tokoi was born as Antti Oskari Hirvi in Yliviirre parish, Kannus in the Central Ostrobothnia region of Finland on May 15, 1873. The family adopted the surname &quot;Tokoi,&quot; the name of a farm purchased by his paternal grandfather, in accordance with common local practice in this period. His father, Kalle, was a farmer and horse-trader.

With the economic situation grim, Tokoi&#x27;s uncle emigrated to the United States in 1878, inspiring Tokoi&#x27;s father to follow him in 1881. His father had been one of the few literate people in the area and saw the benefit of reading, so Oskari was enrolled to attend grammar school as a boarder in a neighboring village at the time his father departed for America. Tokoi would be a star pupil at the school, but his parents refused permission for him to attend school after the first four years were completed and literacy attained; Tokoi would never attend a formal educational institution again.

Oskari&#x27;s father returned to Finland in January 1887. As his brother, Oskari&#x27;s uncle, had already taken over the family farm, Oskari&#x27;s father resumed his career as a horse-trader, with mixed success. The interlude proved to be a short one, however, as his father died of an internal ailment at the age of 33, just three months after his return. Tokoi spent the next four years working as a farm laborer for others and for his uncle, with whom he clashed on a personal level.

After severely injuring another boy in a fight, resulting in medical costs, the relationship between Tokoi and his uncle further deteriorated and by mutual consent in January 1891 the 17-year old Oskari quit the family farm to emigrate to America. The next phase of his life had arrived.

===First American interlude===

Following a difficult winter journey across the sea beginning in January 1891, Tokoi arrived in the United States and made his way to the coal mines of the state of Wyoming, in which his father had worked before him. Tokoi worked in a series of coal and hard metal mines in Wyoming, Colorado, and the Dakota Territory, joining the radical Western Federation of Miners in connection with his employment.

Loss of employment in the mines later forced him to travel the Midwest in search of work, however.

Tokoi returned to Finland in 1900, where he worked as a farmer and a merchant.

===Finnish political career===

Tokoi became politically active in 1901, participating in the popular movement against the Russification of Finland. His activity led him to be elected as chairman of the workers&#x27; association of Kannus in 1905.

In 1907 Tokoi was elected to the parliament (Eduskunta) as a representative of the Social Democrats. From 1912 to 1917 he was the chairman of the Finnish Trade Union Federation. In 1913 Tokoi was elected as the speaker of the Eduskunta, and in 1917 as the head of the Senate of Finland. On 1 March 1918, a treaty between the socialist governments of Russia and Finland was signed in Saint Petersburg. The Treaty was signed by Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin from the Russian side and by Council of Peoples Representatives of Finland Edvard Gylling and Oskari Tokoi.

During the Finnish Civil War Tokoi sided with the Communists and worked as the &quot;commissar in charge of provisions&quot; (minister for supply) in the Finnish People&#x27;s Delegation. After the war, fearing punishment from the victorious Whites, he fled to Russia.

===Final emigration===

During 1919 and 1920, he worked as a political advisor to the Murmansk Legion, which was organized by the British against Finnish nationalists who were preparing military expeditions into British controlled parts of Russia. This effort was condemned by the Bolsheviks and Tokoi had to flee again.

Tokoi traveled first to England and from there to Canada, where he remained one year and farmed in the Timiskaming District. On November 21, 1921, Tokoi returned again to the United States via Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, on his passport issued in England.

He made his way to the Finnish-American colony at Fitchburg, Massachusetts, where he was briefly incarcerated as a suspected anarchist. Held for forced repatriation to Finland, the deportation warrant was ultimately cancelled by the Department of Labor in April 1922, thereby allowing Tokoi to remain in America.

Upon his release, Tokoi became an editor at the Finnish language newspaper &quot;Raivaaja&quot; (The Pioneer).

During the Winter War of 1939–1940, Tokoi was an active public voice for the cause of Finland.

In 1944, the Finnish Parliament passed the so-called &quot;Lex Tokoi&quot;, by which Tokoi was exonerated of all charges related to the Finnish Civil War. After World War II he organized help for Finland among the Finnish-Americans. He visited Finland several times in 1949, 1953, 1957 and 1958. In 1957 he attended the 50th anniversary of the Eduskunta.

===Death and legacy===

Oskari Tokoi died on April 4, 1963, and he was buried in Forest Hill Cemetery in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. Finland&#x27;s President Kekkonen visited Forest Hill Cemetery in July 1970, pausing at the grave of the late Oskari Tokoi.

<text>BBC Four is a British free-to-air public broadcast television channel owned and operated by the BBC. It was launched on 2 March 2002 and shows a wide variety of programmes including arts, documentaries, music, international film and drama, and current affairs. It is required by its licence to air at least 100 hours of new arts and music programmes, 110 hours of new factual programmes, and to premiere twenty foreign films each year. The channel broadcasts daily from 7:00 pm to 4:00 am, timesharing with CBeebies (which starts at 6:00 am).

==History==

BBC Four launched on 2 March 2002 at 7:00 pm GMT, having been delayed from the original planned 2001 launch. BBC Four began as a late schedule for BBC Two, before it received its own channel, along with BBC Three. BBC Four was launched before BBC Three as a result of the government delaying approval for the latter. The channel replaced BBC Knowledge, an educational and cultural channel that had undergone many changes throughout its lifetime; in its final format it carried a schedule of documentaries and art programming, essentially a test of the new BBC Four schedule. It was rebranded as part of BBC Four, aligning it with the existing BBC One and Two brands. Planning for the new channel, along with the new BBC Three, had been in progress since October 2000; however, the incumbent government delayed approving the new BBC digital plans. The BBC Four plans were approved earlier, and as a result launched before BBC Three.

BBC Four was different from the old BBC Knowledge: the channel would be more heavily promoted with more new and original programming and the channel would not be broadcast 24 hours a day. This was because on the Freeview digital terrestrial platform, BBC Four is broadcast in a statistically multiplexed stream in Multiplex B that timeshares with the CBeebies channel (which is on air from 06:00 until 19:00). As a result, BBC Four broadcasts from 19:00 to around 04:00 each night, with an hour&#x27;s down-time and promotions for CBeebies before the start of that channel&#x27;s schedule.

On 12 May 2011, BBC Four was added to the Sky EPG in the Republic of Ireland on channel 230. It later moved to EPG 211 to free up space for new channels. It later moved to channel 143 on 1 May 2018 to sit beside the Northern Irish versions of BBC One and BBC Two there, and the 200s being used for +1 channels.

On 17 August 2018, BBC Four announced BBC 4.1, a special two nights of programming which would revolve around artificial intelligence (AI) selecting the programmes broadcast on the channel, based on &quot;what BBC Four audiences might like, based on the channel&#x27;s previous schedules and programme attributes.&quot; It would then &quot;[rank] programmes it thought were most relevant [to what BBC Four viewers would like].&quot; The programming was aired on the nights of 4 and 5 September 2018. This included a few special programmes about AI, such as &quot;Made by Machine: When AI Met The Archive&quot;, which documented how the AI works, and &quot;The Joy of AI&quot;, where &quot;the emergence of machine learning&quot; is discussed, as well as &quot;why [AI] shouldn&#x27;t spook us&quot;.

On 19 February 2019, Virgin Media stopped providing BBC Four in standard definition.

Due to the launch of BBC Scotland on 24 February 2019, BBC Four has been on a higher Freeview EPG number in Scotland than elsewhere, moving to 82 to make room for BBC Scotland. Following eventual closures, it moved to channel 75 there, and later to channel 68, and eventually channel 55. On 4 November 2020, due to Ofcom proposals regarding certain PSB channels requiring greater prominence on each UK TV provider&#x27;s channel listing, BBC Four moved to channel 24 in Scotland, while every channel from that number (ITV4) to channel 54 (5Select) moved up one place.

In May 2020, the BBC submitted its annual general plan for 2020–21, which included a proposal for BBC Two to supplant BBC Four as its main outlet for specialist programmes. Under the plan, BBC Four would cease originating new programmes, and become a service showcasing the BBC&#x27;s &quot;rich archive&quot;. The plan also included the possibility of the BBC expanding BBC Four into a global brand, to &quot;[take] our strengths in specialist factual to the world stage.&quot;

On 26 May 2022, the BBC announced plans to discontinue BBC Four as a broadcast channel within &quot;the next few years&quot;, as part of plans to streamline and modify services to create a &quot;digital-first&quot; BBC. In March 2023, it was reported that the BBC was considering a reversal of the decision, citing its viewership and low cost of operation, and concerns that the relaunch of BBC Three as a linear channel had not been successful: the aforementioned cuts to original programming had reduced its budget by half in comparison to 2017, and the channel&#x27;s reach in February 2023 was 15.8 million—which was 50% higher than BBC Three in the same month.

==Organisation==
The channel direction is determined by the channel&#x27;s remit, set by royal charter and the corporation&#x27;s governing body (the BBC Board), and by the channel controller. In October 2013, following the departure of Richard Klein from the controllership, the management of the channel changed, with the role of Controller of BBC Four scrapped: from this point the Controller of BBC Two would have ultimate oversight of BBC Four as part of their role, absorbing some of the former duties of the Controller of BBC Four, but a new &#x27;Channel Editor&#x27; post, reporting up to this controller, would be created to take day-to-day charge of Four. The controllers of BBC Four from 2002 to 2016 have been:

*2002–2004: Roly Keating
*2004–2008: Janice Hadlow
*2008–2013: Richard Klein
*2013–2014: Janice Hadlow (as Controller of BBC Two and BBC Four) &quot;on an interim basis&quot; – Hadlow had been Controller of BBC Two since departing BBC Four in 2008
*Early 2014: Adam Barker (interim Controller of BBC Two and BBC Four following Janice Hadlow&#x27;s departure to a new post)
*2014–2016: Kim Shillinglaw (as Controller of BBC Two and BBC Four)

Channel Editors of BBC Four have been:

*2013–present: Cassian Harrison

, BBC Four had an annual budget of £54.3 million.

On 20 January 2016, Kim Shillinglaw announced that she had decided to leave the BBC as the Controller of BBC Two and BBC Four. As a result of the reorganisation, the post of BBC Two and Four control had closed after her departure later that year.

==BBC Four HD==

On 16 July 2013, the BBC announced that a high-definition (HD) simulcast of BBC Four would be launched by early 2014. The channel launched on 10 December 2013 at 18:58 GMT, and rolled out nationwide up to June 2014 (as did BBC News HD, CBBC HD and CBeebies HD). The channel shares its stream with CBeebies HD, as they both air at different times. In June 2022, BBC Four HD moved from the COM7 multiplex on Freeview to Multiplex B due to the closure of COM7 for spectrum reallocation; this move allows the service to reach nearly the entirety of the UK.

Prior to launch, the majority of BBC Four&#x27;s HD output was broadcast on the BBC HD channel, before its closure on 26 March 2013. In 2017, BBC Four HD, along with CBBC HD and CBeebies HD, launched in Ireland.

==Programming==


The first evening&#x27;s BBC Four programmes were simulcast on BBC Two, with the first programme being &quot;The Man Who Destroyed Everything&quot;, a documentary about conceptual artist Michael Landy and his installation Break Down. BBC Four was also notable for first showing Larry David&#x27;s &quot;Seinfeld&quot; follow-up, &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, Armando Iannucci&#x27;s cutting political satire, &quot;The Thick of It&quot;, &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot;, &quot;Flight of the Conchords&quot;, &quot;Mad Men&quot; and Danish thriller &quot;The Killing&quot;.

The channel broadcasts a mixture of art and science documentaries, vintage drama (including many rare black-and-white programmes), and non-English-language productions such as films from the Artificial Eye catalogue, the French thriller &quot;Spiral&quot; and the Swedish detective series &quot;Wallander&quot;. BBC Four further supports foreign-language films with its annual World Cinema Award which has been running since 2004.

From the channel&#x27;s launch in 2002 until the middle of 2020, BBC Four broadcast a global news bulletin on weeknights. Originally this was the &quot;BBC Four News&quot; presented initially by George Alagiah, which ran at 8pm. It was rebranded in January 2004 as &quot;The World&quot;, and was axed in May 2007, replaced the following week by &quot;World News Today&quot;, in a new 7pm timeslot. More recently BBC Four moved news programmes to 7pm with a simulcast of &quot;Beyond 100 Days&quot; Monday–Thursday and an edition of &quot;World News Today&quot; on Fridays which was produced by BBC World News. As of autumn 2020, BBC Four no longer broadcasts a news bulletin.

It screens a number of documentaries such as &quot;The Century of the Self&quot; and &quot;The Trials of Henry Kissinger&quot;. The channel is also home to many political travel shows such as &quot;Holidays in the Axis of Evil&quot; which features investigative journalism.

Drama has given the channel some of its most popular programmes, with &quot;The Alan Clark Diaries&quot; (2003) and &quot;Kenneth Williams: Fantabulosa!&quot; (2006) being among the highest rated, with over 800,000 viewers. The highly acclaimed &quot;Hattie&quot;, broadcast in 2011, holds the record for BBC Four&#x27;s best ever consolidated ratings, of 2m / 8%. Before that &quot;The Curse of Steptoe&quot; brought the channel its highest audience figures, estimated as 1.41 million viewers, a 7% share of multichannel audiences between 21:00 and 22:05, based on overnight returns. The official audience figures for the broadcast, including time-shifting, were later published as 1,625,000.

Another notable production was a live re-make of the 1953 science-fiction serial &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, adapted from the original scripts into a single, two-hour version (though on the night it underran considerably, lasting less than 1 hour 40 minutes), broadcast on the evening of Saturday 2 April 2005. Discounting BBC Four&#x27;s previous live relays of theatrical William Shakespeare productions, this was the first live made-for-television drama to be broadcast by the BBC for twenty years.

Another notable programme broadcast on BBC Four is &quot;Charlie Brooker&#x27;s Screenwipe&quot; which contains reviews of current shows, as well as stories and commentary on how television is produced. The show is presented by broadcaster Charlie Brooker. The show was very successful and spawned several spin-offs such as &quot;Newswipe with Charlie Brooker&quot;, &quot;Charlie Brooker&#x27;s Gameswipe&quot; and &quot;Charlie Brooker&#x27;s Weekly Wipe&quot;.

The channel is also curator and leader of the BBC Archive project whose aim is that the BBC&#x27;s television archive is re-broadcast as much as appropriate so that the Archive can be enjoyed again and not isolated.

Some output from BBC Four (documentaries rather than foreign films) was for a time repeated on BBC Two in a &#x27;BBC Four on Two&#x27; branded area, although this was often in a late night broadcast slot after &quot;Newsnight&quot; and has since been discontinued.

According to BARB the comedy panel game &quot;QI&quot; has the highest ratings of any show on BBC Four.

At the Edinburgh International Television Festival, BBC Four won the Non-Terrestrial Channel of the Year award in 2004, 2006 and 2012.

In 2012 &quot;Dirk Gently&quot; became the first continuing drama series produced for the channel.

During the period when BBC Three was not broadcasting as a linear TV channel, BBC Four was occasionally used to show live sports coverage. The channel aired games from the UEFA Euro 2016 and 2018 FIFA World Cup football tournaments when the final round of matches in the group stages took place (when matches in each group kick-off simultaneously). It has also been used to broadcast England women&#x27;s football matches, as well as some matches from the 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. It also temporarily extended its broadcast hours to show live action from the 2016 Summer Olympics.

As of 2023, BBC Four schedules still feature music programming (such as &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and Neil Brand&#x27;s documentaries) on a Friday night, with drama imports on a Saturday (but not always foreign-language productions like Italian crime drama &quot;Inspector Montalbano&quot;) and usually an hour of &#x27;archive&#x27; programmes (such as those by Bob Ross and Fred Dibnah) starting off the weekday schedule at 7pm. As well as programmes from the 1980s and 1990s, this early evening slot gives a chance for regional programmes to get a national airing with Cy Chadwick&#x27;s &quot;Walking with...&quot; productions and &quot;Gareth Edwards&#x27;s Great Welsh Adventure&quot; (from BBC Wales) getting a repeat here and then again late night. In addition to these programmes, many hour long regional documentaries such as BBC Scotland&#x27;s &quot;Rigs of Nigg&quot;, about the 1970s North Sea oil drilling platform construction industry based around the Cromarty Firth, also received their national debut on the channel.

On 9 April 2021, BBC Four was suspended due to the death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, in order to preserve bandwidth for the broadcast of news coverage and tribute programming on BBC One and Two. This was done for the same reasons after the death of Elizabeth II on 8 September 2022.

==Availability outside the UK==
BBC Four is widely available on cable, IPTV and digital satellite television in the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The channel is registered to broadcast within the European Union/EEA through the Luxembourg Broadcasting Regulator – ALIA.

==Presentation==

The channel&#x27;s initial series of idents were generated dynamically reflecting the frequencies of the continuity announcers&#x27; voice or of backing music and were designed by Lambie-Nairn. As a result, no two idents were ever the same. The first continuity announcer was Zeb Soanes.

When the channel first started airing, it used the slogan &quot;Everybody Needs A Place To Think&quot;, but the BBC stopped using this several months after the launch. However the BBC Four logo and above slogan can be found, engraved on benches along the South Bank in London, between the London Eye and Waterloo Bridge.

On 10 September 2005, the channel began showing new idents comprising a central BBC Four logo surrounded by four quadrants which show different stages of the same footage thus making for a sort of optical illusion; for example, a swimming pool where a person on an inflatable ring appears in the bottom-left corner, though ripples don&#x27;t enter the remaining quarters. Although the image appears as one at the start of the ident, by the end it is clearly four separate images. These were the longest-running idents ever used by the BBC - they lasted until the channel&#x27;s rebrand in 2021, however, the &quot;quadrants&quot; theme continues to this day.

In March 2019, BBC Four added several new idents inspired by &quot;oddly satisfying videos&quot; in tandem with the quadrants theme, originally premiering for a programme season honouring the 30th anniversary of the World Wide Web.

<doc id="345442" wikidata="Q2430685" url="?curid=345442" title="Bird's Custard">
<text>Bird&#x27;s Custard is the brand name for the original powdered, egg-free imitation custard powder, now owned by Premier Foods. Custard powder and instant custard powder are the generic product names for similar and competing products. The product is a powder, based on cornflour, which thickens to form a custard-like sauce when mixed with milk and heated.

==History==
Bird&#x27;s Custard was first formulated and cooked by Alfred Bird in 1837 at his chemist shop in Birmingham. He developed the recipe because his wife was allergic to eggs, the key ingredient used to thicken traditional custard. The Birds continued to serve egg-based custard to dinner guests, until one evening when the egg-free custard was served instead, either by accident or design. The dessert was so well received by the other diners that Alfred Bird put the recipe into wider production.

John Monkhouse (1862–1938) was a prosperous Methodist businessman who co-founded Monk and Glass, which made custard powder and jelly. Glass represented his business partner Frederick Thomas Glasscock. Monk and Glass custard was made in Clerkenwell and sold in the home market, and exported to the Empire and to America. Glasscock retired when the business was acquired by its rival Bird&#x27;s Custard in the early 20th century.

==Usage==
In some regions, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, the popularity of this type of dessert is such that it is simply known as &quot;custard&quot;. In such cases, general usage of the word may be more likely to refer to the &quot;Bird&#x27;s&quot; custard rather than to the traditional egg-based variety. 

&quot;Instant&quot; versions (containing powdered milk and sugar and requiring only hot water) and ready-made custard in tins, plastic pots and cartons have also become popular.

==Alfred Bird and Sons Ltd.==
After he discovered his custard was popular, Bird formed Alfred Bird and Sons Ltd. in Birmingham. By 1843, the company was also making the newly invented baking powder and, by 1844, was promoting custard powder nationally. By 1895, the company was producing blancmange powder, jelly powder and egg substitute. In World War I, Bird&#x27;s Custard was supplied to the British armed forces.

The company was one of the early users of promotional items and colourful advertising campaigns. The &#x27;three bird&#x27; logo was introduced 1929.

World War II saw rationing and serious production limits. Shortly after the war, Bird&#x27;s was purchased by the General Foods Corporation, which was itself taken over by Philip Morris in the 1980s and merged into Kraft Foods. The Bird&#x27;s Custard product remains as a brand. In late 2004, Kraft sold Bird&#x27;s Custard and some other Kraft brands to Premier Foods, the owners .

In 1958, the company acquired Monk and Glass, a rival custard powder manufacturer based in London.

The original custard factory has long ceased to exist, but the larger factory Bird&#x27;s opened in Gibb Street remains (production was relocated to Banbury in 1964, along with the factory gates, featuring the company logo), and has been adapted as the Custard Factory arts centre.

==Ingredients==
Until 2009, many Bird&#x27;s products, including the instant custard powder, contained partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, a product now banned in some countries due to health concerns relating to heart disease. Since then, all Bird&#x27;s custards have moved to unhydrogenated vegetable oil.

==Physical properties==
Cooked custard is a weak gel, viscous and thixotropic. A suspension of &quot;uncooked&quot; custard powder (starch) in water, with the proper proportions, has the opposite rheological property: it is negative thixotropic, or dilatant, which is to say that it becomes more viscous when under pressure. This suspension is sometimes termed oobleck and often used in science demonstrations of non-Newtonian fluids. The popular-science programme &quot;&quot; demonstrated dilatancy dramatically by filling a swimming pool with this mixture and having presenter Jon Tickle walk across it.

<doc id="345446" wikidata="Q584108" url="?curid=345446" title="South Downs">
<text>The South Downs are a range of chalk hills in the south-eastern coastal counties of England that extends for about across the south-eastern coastal counties of England from the Itchen valley of Hampshire in the west to Beachy Head, in the Eastbourne Downland Estate, East Sussex, in the east. The Downs are bounded on the northern side by a steep escarpment, from whose crest there are extensive views northwards across the Weald. The South Downs National Park forms a much larger area than the chalk range of the South Downs, and includes large parts of the Weald.

The South Downs are characterised by rolling chalk downland with close-cropped turf and dry valleys, and are recognised as one of the most important chalk landscapes in England. The range is one of the four main areas of chalk downland in southern England.

The South Downs are relatively less populated compared to South East England as a whole, although there has been large-scale urban encroachment onto the chalk downland by major seaside resorts, including most notably Brighton and Hove. The South Downs have been inhabited since ancient times and at periods the area has supported a large population, particularly during Romano-British times. There is a rich heritage of historical features and archaeological remains, including defensive sites, burial mounds and field boundaries. Within the South Downs Environmentally Sensitive Area there are thirty-seven Sites of Special Scientific Interest, including large areas of chalk grassland.

The grazing of sheep on the thin, well-drained chalk soils of the Downs over many centuries, and browsing by rabbits, resulted in the fine, short, springy turf, known as &quot;old chalk grassland&quot;, that has come to epitomise the South Downs today. Until the middle of the 20th century, an agricultural system operated by downland farmers known as &#x27;sheep-and-corn farming&#x27; underpinned this: the sheep (most famously the Southdown breed) of villagers would be systematically confined to certain corn fields to improve their fertility with their droppings and then they would be let out onto the downland to graze. However, starting in 1940 with government measures during the Second World War to increase domestic food production – which continued into the 1950s - much grassland was ploughed up for arable farming, fundamentally changing the landscape and ecology, with the loss of much biodiversity. As a result, while old chalk grassland accounted for 40-50% of the eastern Downs before the war, only 3-4% survives. This and development pressures from the surrounding population centres ultimately led to the decision to create the South Downs National Park, which came into full operation on 1 April 2011, to protect and restore the Downs.

The South Downs have also been designated as a National Character Area (NCA 125) by Natural England. It is bordered by the Hampshire Downs, the Wealden Greensand, the Low Weald and the Pevensey Levels to the north and the South Hampshire Lowlands and South Coast Plain to the south.

The downland is a highly popular recreational destination, particularly for walkers, horseriders and mountain bikers. A long distance footpath and bridleway, the South Downs Way, follows the entire length of the chalk ridge from Winchester to Eastbourne, complemented by many interconnecting public footpaths and bridleways.

==Toponymy==
The term &#x27;downs&#x27; is from Old English &quot;dūn&quot;, meaning &#x27;hill&#x27;. The word acquired the sense of &#x27;elevated rolling grassland&#x27; around the 14th century. These hills are prefixed &#x27;south&#x27; to distinguish them from another chalk escarpment, the North Downs, which runs roughly parallel to them about away on the northern edge of the Weald.

==Geology==


The South Downs are formed from a thick band of chalk which was deposited during the Cretaceous Period between 100 and 66 million years ago within a shallow sea which extended across much of northwest Europe. The rock is composed of the microscopic skeletons of plankton which lived in the sea, hence its colour. The chalk has many fossils, and bands of flint occur throughout the formation. The Chalk is divided into the Lower, Middle and Upper Chalk, a thin band of cream-coloured nodular chalk known as the Melbourn Rock marking the boundary between the Lower and Middle units.

The strata of southeast England, including the Chalk, were gently folded during a phase of the Alpine Orogeny to produce the Weald-Artois Anticline, a dome-like structure with a long east-west axis. Erosion has removed the central part of the dome, leaving the north-facing escarpment of the South Downs along its southern margin with the south-facing chalk escarpment of the North Downs as its counterpart on the northern side, as shown on the diagram. Between these two escarpments the anticline has been subject to differential erosion so that geologically distinct areas of hills and vales lie in roughly concentric circles towards the centre; these comprise the Greensand Ridge, most prominent on the north side of the Weald, where it includes Leith Hill, the highest hill in south-east England, the low-lying clay vales of the Low Weald, formed of less resistant Weald Clay, and finally the more highly resistant sandstones of the High Weald at the centre of the anticline, whose elevated forest ridge includes most notably Ashdown Forest.

The chalk, being porous, allows water to soak through; as a result, there are many winterbournes along the northern edge.

==Geography==
The South Downs are a long chalk escarpment that stretches for over , rising from the valley of the River Itchen near Winchester, Hampshire, in the west to Beachy Head near Eastbourne, East Sussex, in the east. Behind the steep north-facing scarp slope, the gently inclined dip slope of undulating chalk downland extends for a distance of up to southwards. Viewed from high points further north in the High Weald and on the North Downs, the scarp of the South Downs presents itself as a steep wall that bounds the horizon, with its grassland heights punctuated with clumps of trees (such as Chanctonbury Ring).

In the west, the chalk ridge of the South Downs merges with the North Downs to form the Hampshire Downs. In the east, the escarpment terminates at the English Channel coast between Seaford and Eastbourne, where it produces the spectacular white cliffs of Seaford Head, the cross-section of dry valleys known as the Seven Sisters and Beachy Head, the highest chalk sea cliff in Britain at above sea level.

The South Downs may be said to have three main component parts: the East Hampshire Downs, the Western Downs and the Eastern Downs, together with the river valleys that cut across them and the land immediately below them, the &quot;scarpfoot&quot;. The Western and Eastern Downs are often collectively referred to as the &quot;Sussex Downs&quot;. The Western Downs, lying west of the River Arun, are much more wooded, particularly on the scarp face, than the Eastern Downs. The bare Eastern Downs – the only part of the chalk escarpment to which, until the late 19th century, the term &quot;South Downs&quot; was usually applied – have come to epitomise, in literature and art, the South Downs as a whole and which have been the subject matter of such celebrated writers and artists as Rudyard Kipling (the &quot;blunt, bow-headed, whale-backed downs&quot;) and Eric Ravilious.

Four river valleys cut through the South Downs, namely those of the rivers Arun, Adur, Ouse and Cuckmere, providing a contrasting landscape. Chalk aquifers and to a lesser extent winterbourne streams supply much of the water required by the surrounding settlements. Dew ponds, artificial ponds for watering livestock, are a characteristic feature on the downland.

The highest point on the South Downs is Butser Hill, whose summit is above sea level. The plateau-like top of this irregularly shaped hill, which lies just south of Petersfield, Hampshire, was in regular use through prehistory. It has been designated as a national nature reserve.

Within the boundary of the South Downs National Park, which includes parts of the western Weald to the north of the South Downs, the highest point is Blackdown, West Sussex, which rises to above sea level. However, Blackdown geologically is not part of the South Downs but instead forms part of the Greensand Ridge on the Weald&#x27;s western margins.

A list of those points on the South Downs above , going from west to east, is given below.
==History==
Archaeological evidence has revealed that the Downs have been inhabited and utilised for thousands of years. Neolithic flint mines such as Cissbury, burial mounds such as the Devil&#x27;s Jumps and Devil&#x27;s Humps, and hill forts like Chanctonbury Ring are strong features in the landscape.

It has been estimated that the tree cover of the Downs was cleared over 3000 years ago, and the present closely grazed turf is the result of continual grazing by sheep.

==National park==

Proposals to create a national park for the South Downs date back to the 1940s. However, it was not until 1999 that the idea received firm government support. After a public enquiry that took place between 2003 and 2009, the government announced its decision to make the South Downs a national park on 31 March 2009. The South Downs National Park finally came into operation on 1 April 2011. Within its boundary are included not only the South Downs proper but also part of the western Weald, a geologically and ecologically quite different district.

The South Downs National Park has replaced two Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB)s: East Hampshire AONB and Sussex Downs AONB. During the enquiry process a number of boundary questions were considered, so that the National Park contains areas not in the former AONBs, and vice versa.

==National nature reserves==
The South Downs contain a number of national nature reserves (NNRs).

The NNRs on the Sussex Downs comprise Kingley Vale, near Chichester, said by Natural England to contain one of the finest yew forests in Europe, including a grove of ancient trees which are among the oldest living things in Britain (the reserve is also one of the most important archaeological sites in southern England, with 14 scheduled monuments); Castle Hill, between Brighton and Lewes, an important example of ancient, traditionally managed grassland; Lewes Downs (Mount Caburn), a traditionally managed chalk downland (and also an important archaeological site); and Lullington Heath, on the northern fringe of Friston Forest north-west of Eastbourne, one of the largest areas of chalk heath in Britain.

The NNRs on the East Hampshire Downs comprise Butser Hill, near Petersfield, a large area of chalk grassland on the highest point in the South Downs (a large area is also designated as a scheduled monument reflecting its historical significance, particularly in the Bronze and Iron Ages); Old Winchester Hill, a lowland grassland on the west and south facing scarp slopes of the Meon valley; and Beacon Hill, a high quality chalk grassland 5 km west of Old Winchester Hill.

==Tourism, leisure and sport==
In 1923 the Society of Sussex Downsmen (now the South Downs Society) was formed with the aim of protecting the area&#x27;s unique landscape.

The South Downs are a popular area for ramblers with a network of over of well-managed, well-signed and easily accessible trails. The principal bridleway, and longest of them, is the South Downs Way. The Monarch&#x27;s Way, having originated at Worcester, crosses the South Downs and ends at Shoreham-by-Sea.

Sports undertaken on the Downs include paragliding, mountain-biking, horse riding and walking. The popular &quot;Beachy Head Marathon&quot; (formerly &quot;Seven Sisters Marathon&quot;), a hilly cross-country marathon, takes place each autumn on the eastern Downs, starting and finishing in Eastbourne. The South Downs Trail Marathon starts in the village of Slindon (near Arundel) and ends at the Queen Elizabeth Country Park (to the south of Petersfield.)

Longer events that take place in the South Downs Way include a 100-mile running &#x27;ultramarathon&#x27; and a 75-mile mountain biking night time race from Beachy Head to Queen Elizabeth Country Park.

==Landmarks==
Three of the landmarks on the Downs are the Long Man of Wilmington and the Litlington White Horse being chalk carved hill figures, and Clayton Windmills. There is also a war memorial, The Chattri, dedicated to Indian soldiers who died in the Brighton area, having been brought there for treatment after being injured fighting on the Western Front in the First World War.
==South Downs in literature==
Rudyard Kipling who lived in Rottingdean described the South Downs as &quot;Our blunt, bow-headed whale-backed Downs&quot;. Writing in 1920 in his poem &quot;The South Country&quot;, poet Hilaire Belloc describes the South Downs as &quot;the great hills of the South Country&quot;. In &quot;On The South Coast&quot;, poet Algernon Charles Swinburne describes the South Downs as &quot;the green smooth-swelling unending downs&quot;.

The naturalist-writer William Henry Hudson wrote that &quot;during the whole fifty-three mile length from Beachy Head to Harting the ground never rises above a height of 850 feet, but we feel on top of the world&quot;.

Poet Francis William Bourdillon also wrote a poem &quot;On the South Downs&quot;. The South Downs have been home to several writers, including Jane Austen who lived at Chawton on the edge of the Downs in Hampshire. The Bloomsbury Group often visited Monk&#x27;s House in Rodmell, the home of Virginia Woolf in the Ouse valley. Alfred, Lord Tennyson, had a second home at Aldworth, on Blackdown; geologically part of the Weald, Blackdown lies north of the South Downs but is included in the South Downs National Park.

In the introduction to Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s short story collection &quot;His Last Bow&quot;, Dr. Watson states that Sherlock Holmes has retired to a small farm upon the Downs near Eastbourne. In the story &quot;His Last Bow&quot; itself, Holmes states that he &quot;lives and keeps bees upon the South Downs&quot;. Furthermore, the short story &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Mane&quot; is about a case that Holmes solves whilst living there.

The author Graham Greene&#x27;s first published novel, &quot;The Man Within&quot; (1929), is set largely on and around the South Downs. The book&#x27;s principal character, Andrews, travels by foot across the Downs to reach Lewes and attend the Assizes. Greene provides a detailed description of both the landscape and its &#x27;feel&#x27;.

The author H. G. Wells published a book called &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; in 1898, and in it says &quot;He fled to South Down&quot;.

<text>Alfred &quot;Tubby&quot; Hall (October 12, 1895 – May 13, 1945) was an American jazz drummer.

Hall was born in Sellers, Louisiana; his family moved to New Orleans in his childhood. His younger brother, Minor &quot;Ram&quot; Hall, also became a professional drummer. He played in many marching bands in New Orleans, including with Buddie Petit.

In March 1917, Tubby Hall moved to Chicago, where he played with Sugar Johnny Smith. After two years in the United States Army, he returned to playing in Chicago, mostly with New Orleans bands, joining Carroll Dickerson&#x27;s Orchestra (recording with it in 1927) and later with the groups of King Oliver, Jimmie Noone, Tiny Parham, Johnny Dodds. Noted swing and big-band drummer Gene Krupa said that Hall and Zutty Singleton &quot;were great! They knew every trick and just how to phrase the parts of the choruses behind the horns, how to lead a man in, what to do at the turn-arounds, when to use sticks and when to use brushes, when to go for the rims or the woodblocks, what cymbals are for.&quot;

He is seen in Armstrong&#x27;s movies of the early 1930s, including the live action and Betty Boop cartoon &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Glad When You&#x27;re Dead, You Rascal You&quot; (1932) and &quot;A Rhapsody in Black and Blue&quot; (1932), made by Paramount. Only Armstrong and Hall got closeups in the two films, and both got their faces transposed with those of racially stereotyped &quot;jungle natives&quot; in the cartoon. Hall morphs from a jazz drummer to a cannibal stirring a cooking pot with two wooden sticks.

His drumming style was forceful and sober, generally maintaining a constant tempo on the snare. Jazz critic Hugues Panassié considered him one of the three greatest jazz drummers of his generation, along with Zutty Singleton and Warren &quot;Baby&quot; Dodds.

Tubby Hall died in Chicago.

<text>The Kyffhäuserkreis is a district in the northern part of Thuringia, Germany. Neighboring districts are the districts Mansfeld-Südharz, Saalekreis and Burgenlandkreis in Saxony-Anhalt, and the districts Sömmerda, Unstrut-Hainich-Kreis and Eichsfeld.

==History==
In the 12th century there was a castle, the Kyffhausen Castle, on the Kyffhäuser mountains, which was built during the reign of emperor Frederick I. According to the local legend, the emperor did not die, but instead went to sleep in this castle.

From 1579 on the region belonged to Saxony, and after 1815 it was divided between the Prussian Province of Saxony and Schwarzburg-Sondershausen.

In 1952 the two districts of Artern (district) and Sondershausen were established. These districts were merged in 1994, with only a few municipalities joining other districts.

=== Historical Population ===
Values as of 31 December:

==Partnerships==
The district has a partnership with the district Ahrweiler in Rhineland-Palatinate, which was initially established with the district Artern in 1990.

==Geography==
The district is named after the &quot;Kyffhäuser&quot; mountains. The main river is the Unstrut, which flows through the east of the district.

==Coat of arms==
The main symbol of the coat of arms is the lion of the counts of Schwarzburg, who historically ruled most of the district. The lion holds a shield which contains the coat of arms of the Counts of Mansfeld, who owned the area around Artern in the 18th century. The three green hills in the bottom symbolize the mountainous landscape with many forests, the big wavy line stands for the river Unstrut, the small one for the Wipper river.

<text>Buddie Petit (born Joseph Crawford; most likely 1896 or 1897 — July 4, 1931), also spelled Buddy Petit, was an American early jazz cornetist.

His year of birth has been given in various sources as ranging from 1887 to 1897. He gave December 23, 1896 as his date of birth on his signed WWI Draft Card. He was born Joseph Crawford in White Castle, Iberville Parish, Louisiana but was adopted by the trombonist Joseph Petit, whose surname he took.

He took Freddie Keppard&#x27;s place in the Eagle Band (a place earlier held by Buddy Bolden) when Keppard left town. He was briefly lured to Los Angeles by Jelly Roll Morton and Bill Johnson in 1917, but he objected to being told to dress and behave differently from what he was accustomed to and returned to New Orleans. He spent the rest of his career in the area around greater New Orleans, and the towns north of Lake Pontchartrain, not venturing further from home than Baton Rouge and the Mississippi Gulf Coast.

Okeh Records offered him a chance to record on their 1925 field trip to New Orleans, but Petit held out for more money and was never recorded. Danny Barker and Louis Armstrong said that it was a great loss to jazz history that there are no recordings of Petit.

He died on July 4, 1931, reportedly after &quot;over-indulging&quot; in food and drink.

<doc id="345468" wikidata="Q1935947" url="?curid=345468" title="Battle of Eniwetok">
<text>The Battle of Eniwetok was a battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II, fought from 17 to 23 February 1944 on Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The invasion of Eniwetok followed the American success in the Battle of Kwajalein to the southeast. Capture of Eniwetok would provide an airfield and harbor to support attacks on the Mariana Islands to the northwest. The operation was officially known as &quot;Operation Catchpole&quot; and was a three-phase operation involving the invasion of the three main islands in the Enewetak Atoll.

==Background==
Eniwetok is a large coral atoll of 40 islands with a land area total less than . It has a mean elevation above sea level of and surrounds a deep central lagoon, in circumference.

Following World War I, the atoll became part of the Japanese South Seas Mandate. Japan had no military presence here until November 1942, when an airfield was constructed on Engebi Island. This was used for refueling planes between Truk and islands to the east, with no aviation personnel stationed there; and the island had only token defenses.

When the Gilbert Islands fell to the United States in late 1943, the Imperial Japanese Army assigned defense of Eniwetok to the 1st Amphibious Brigade, recently formed from reservists of the 3rd Independent Garrison in Manchukuo, 3,940 men under the command of Major General Yoshimi Nishida, first arriving on 4 January 1944. 

On 17-18 February 1944, Vice Admiral Raymond A. Spruance executed Operation Hailstone, an American carrier strike against the Japanese base at Truk in the Caroline Islands destroying 39 warships and more than 200 planes. Among the lost was the 1st Amphibious Brigade&#x27;s supply ship &quot;Aikoku Maru&quot;. 

Altogether, only 2,586 of General Nishida&#x27;s men arrived on Eniwetok. These were supplemented by aviation personnel, civilian employees, and labourers. Most were stationed on Parry Island (now Medren), where Nishida established his headquarters.

==Battle of Engebi==
Engebi Island is at the north tip of Enewetak Atoll. The island is triangular in shape, with a palm grove on its eastern side and an airfield across its north half. The island was lightly defended by a garrison of 60 men with a battery of two 12 cm guns and two twin mounted 13 mm machine guns. The island also had 500 non-combatants. On 4 January 1944, the 1st Amphibious Brigade arrived on Eniwetok. Engebi received 692 men from the brigade and 54 naval personnel, commanded by Colonel Toshio Yano. These reinforcements had two flame throwers, thirteen grenade launchers, twelve light machine guns, four heavy machine guns, two 37 mm anti-tank guns, eleven 81 mm mortars, one 20 mm automatic gun, two 20 mm cannons, two Type 94 75 mm mountain guns, and three Type 95 light tanks. They were deployed on the lagoon side, where Colonel Yano expected the Americans to land. They constructed a strong point half way along the shore and smaller strong points at the island&#x27;s three corners.

On 16 February United States Navy aircraft from Task Group 58.4 attacked Engebi. This took the airfield out of operation. It also destroyed up to 14 aircraft and one of the coastal defence guns, at the northeastern corner of the island. The main invasion fleet arrived off Eniwetok early on 17 February.

Naval bombardment of Eniwetok began on 17 February, and at 13:18 US forces landed on Canna and Camelia islets, near Engebi. No resistance was encountered. A blocking force was placed on the island chain to the south of Engebi to stop the defenders from escaping.

At 06:55 on 18 February the battleship and the cruiser began to bombard the northern and eastern ends of the island. The battleships and opened fire on the beach defences at dawn, and at 07:20 the destroyer began direct fire. At 08:00 a naval air attack began, and at 08:11 the naval bombardment resumed. Artillery from the islets captured on 17 February also added to the bombardment.

The main landings were carried out by two battalions from the 22nd Marine Regiment, commanded by Colonel John T. Walker, which landed on Engebi at 08:43 on 18 February, supported by medium tanks and two 105mm self propelled guns. There was very little resistance at the beach, except from the southern tip of the island. The airfield was quickly captured, and within an hour the tanks had reached the northern shore. The 3rd Battalion landed at 09:55 and began to mop up the few remaining defenders. The island was declared secure by 14:50, though mopping-up continued through the next day. US losses included 85 killed and missing plus 166 wounded. The Japanese lost 1,276 killed and 16 captured.

On 18–19 February the Americans cleared the smaller islands on the atoll&#x27;s east side. There they found evidence that Parry and Eniwetok Islands were more heavily defended than expected, so the battle plan was adjusted. Originally, the 106th Infantry Regiment was to invade Eniwetok and Parry simultaneously. Instead, they cleared Eniwetok first, then Parry.

==Battle of Eniwetok==
Eniwetok Island is a long, narrow island, widest at the southwestern end, and very narrow on the northeastern end. A road existed on the lagoon shore on the southwestern half of the island, where the settlement was located. This topography meant that defense in depth was impossible. On the island the Japanese had 779 Army troops, 24 civilians, and five naval personnel, all under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Hashida Masahiro. The defenders had two flame throwers, 13 grenade launchers, 12 light machine guns, two heavy machine guns, one 50mm mortar, eleven 81mm mortars, one 20mm automatic gun, three 20mm cannons, and three Type 95 light tanks. Most defenses were foxholes and trenches. Work had also begun on some concrete pillboxes, which were not completed.

At 07:10 on 18 February two cruisers and two destroyers opened fire on Japanese positions from the lagoon side of Eniwetok. At 07:40 a third destroyer opened fire to the east of the landing beaches, and at 08:10 a fourth destroyer also commenced bombardment. At 08:10 naval gunfire halted for 15 minutes to allow carrier aircraft to attack. The first troops landed at 09:17, but the initial landings immediately ran into problems. The short naval bombardment left many Japanese positions intact, and the American LVTs could not scale an sand dune just inland. These early problems were quickly overcome, and the Americans reached the island&#x27;s ocean shore by 11:45. A Japanese counter-attack, carried out by 300–400 men, hit the western part of the American line, which was supported by mortar fire. The attack was over by 12:45 and had failed to break the Americans.

At 14:25 the 3rd Battalion, 22nd Marines landed. They pushed towards the southwestern end of the island. By nightfall, they had reached the west corner of the island. The Marine commander, Colonel Ayers, ordered that the attack continue through the night to eliminate the Japanese pocket in the northwest corner. A Japanese counterattack at 09:10 on 19 February reached the Marine battalion command post but was repulsed. The 3rd Battalion continued to press the attack south, along the east coast. The Japanese spider hole defensive positions were intact, with heavy undergrowth providing good defensive cover. Progress was slow, as spider holes had to be eliminated one-by-one.

The fighting in the west came to an end on the morning of 20 February; however, the island was not declared secured until 21 February. 37 Americans were killed or missing and 94 wounded. The Japanese had 800 dead and 23 prisoners.

==Battle of Parry Island==
Parry Island is smaller than Eniwetok and was more heavily defended. When the invasion began the Japanese had 1,115 troops and 250 other personnel on Parry, equipped with 36 heavy grenade launchers, 36 light machine guns, six heavy machine guns, ten 81mm mortars, three 20mm automatic guns, two mountain guns, one 20mm cannon and three Type 95 light tanks. The island is tear-drop shaped with the larger end to the north, facing the lagoon. The Japanese defences consisted of a series of eight strong points along the beach, protected by trenches and a network of foxholes.

Based on experience at Eniwetok, the American naval bombardment of Parry Island was more thorough. On 22 February the battleships and and the heavy cruisers and and the destroyer delivered more than 900 tons of explosive onto the island, with the 104th Field Artillery on Eniwetok and the 2nd Separate Pack Howitzer Battalions on Japtan Island to the north providing additional fire support. The invasion force consisted of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 22nd Marines, who had just finished mopping up at Engebi. The 1st Battalion advance on the right, and the 2nd Battalion advanced on the east. The landing occurred at 09:00 with a combined force of Marines and tanks advancing rapidly past Japanese positions once machine-gun fire had been suppressed, followed by demolition and flame-thrower squads clearing out spider holes and Japanese defenders who had been bypassed, followed by three four-man squads mopping up any survivors.

At 10:00 remaining Japanese artillery was suppressed by naval bombardment, and by 11:55 the 1st Battalion reached the ocean shore, with the 2nd Battalion taking the northern tip of the island by 13:00. The 1st Battalion then turned to the southern tip of the island, reinforced by the 3rd Battalion along the lagoon shore. At 19:30 the regimental commander radioed &quot;I present you with the island of Parry&quot;, though operations continued through the next day. U.S. casualties included 73 killed and missing plus 261 wounded. The vast majority of Japanese soldiers were killed, including General Nishida, although 105 survivors were captured.

==Aftermath==
Eniwetok Atoll became Naval Base Eniwetok, providing a forward base for the United States Navy for its later operations.

<text>Timbro is a liberal think tank and publishing company located in Stockholm, Sweden. In its present form Timbro was founded in 1978 by Sture Eskilsson and the Swedish Employers’ Association, a precursor to the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise.  Since 2003, Timbro is being financed by the . In 2013, the foundation received a renewed financial commitment from the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise to ensure its long-term existence.

Timbro has economically liberal and free market leanings; its mission is to promote every individual&#x27;s right to self-empowerment, and the ideas that individual freedom precedes economic equality, and that political power of the government over individuals and businesses should be minimized. Timbro is a member of EPICENTER, a network of European free market think tanks.

==History==

Originally, Timbro was founded by business man Ernfrid Browaldh (1889–1982), later CEO of Svenska Handelsbanken, as a publishing company. It derives its name from his two children, Tore and Ing-Marie Browaldh. Later, Browaldh donated Timbro to the Foundation of Swedish Business.

In the 1970s Timbro was transformed into a think tank. Swedish politics was dominated by an increasingly left-leaning political climate, and within the Swedish Employers’ Association was a growing concern that a number of reforms under way threatened a free market economy. Sture Eskilsson, at the time working for Swedish Employers’ Association&#x27;s information and communication department, noted that the intellectual momentum belonged to the left which also dominated public discourse. In a PM from 1971 to the directors of the Swedish Employers’ Association, Eskilsson outlined an action plan to promote the values and ideas supporting a free market economy. Eskilsson argued that the Swedish Employers’ Association should allocate resources to influence the prevalent ideas, and described a way to maximize the results of such an effort. He especially pointed to the intellectual elite as a target group. Eskilsson wrote: “[the dominance of present-day leftish ideas] would hardly have been possible without the efforts made by Young Philosophers”. The Swedish Employers’ Association followed Eskilsson&#x27;s recommendations and increased its budget for its opinion-making branch.

The Swedish Employers’ Association effort to influence the public discourse didn&#x27;t go unnoticed and was widely reported in the media. Social Democratic daily Arbetet wrote about a “secret document” put together by the Swedish Employers’ Association: “[...] this is how the leftish tendency should be stopped.” A fierce debate ensued on how big business wanted to change the intellectual climate in Sweden. In the left-leaning journal FIB/Kulturfront, author Jan Guillou and journalist Peter Bratt wrote an article head-lined, “The secret document  of the board of Swedish Employers’ Association” about the alleged efforts by “buyer&#x27;s of labor to shape our opinions”, and that the document, “ ... outlines the experiences to date for influencing how opinions are formed in Sweden, as well as giving guidelines for the near future.”   

Eskilsson&#x27;s PM is today viewed as a major turning point for the public discourse in Sweden even though its effects during the 1970s were rather modest.

In 1978, Eskilsson&#x27;s plan led to the creation of Timbro as a think tank. It more or less assumed the opinion-making branch of the Swedish Employers’ Association. The purpose was to create a platform for an independent intellectual discussion to flourish. Participants and events should no longer be directly connected to the Swedish Employers’ Association. In conjunction with this, Eskilsson also persuaded the Foundation of Swedish Business to finance Timbro to increase its independence and further distance the new think tank from the Swedish Employers’ Association.

The initiative caused strong antipathy and suspicion among the Left. Social Democratic newspapers published a number of articles with personal attacks directed at Sture Eskilsson. Even in the parliament emotions ran high, and the chairman of the Communist Party demanded of Social Democratic minister Ingvar Carlsson, later Prime Minister, to “do something” about Sture Eskilsson.

The main focus of Timbro was to in different ways influence the politic language. It was done through the publishing of books, educational efforts for the younger generation of opinionmakers, and presenting reports in different central areas, including labor policy, the European Union, integration of immigrants, taxes, welfare, and general ideological issues.

In 1983, Timbro participated in arranging a demonstration in Stockholm to protest against the Social Democrats’ efforts to make into law that revenues of private companies should be shared with labor unions. The demonstration gathered 75,000 participants on 4 October, a date that since has become a symbol for free market proponents in Sweden. 

==Book publishing and education ==
However, the demonstration in 1983 was a unique event, as demonstrations have not been a focus for Timbro. Instead, developing and spreading ideas directed towards media and pundits have remained the main strategy. During the 1980s, book publishing became increasingly important, even extended into fiction. &quot;Operation Garbo&quot;, a literary effort to influence security policy, was a great success leading to media coverage that was instrumental to ideological debates.

During the 1980s Timbro was the owner of private City University, which developed programs in economics. Among its students was Anders Borg, later finance minister, who in the 1990s published two reports while studying at the City University.

Timbro also regularly publishes classic Swedish and international scholarly work. In later years it has also published books by major center-to-right thinkers as Fredrik Segerfeldt, Mattias Svensson, Johan Lundberg, Lena Andersson, Erik Hörstadius, and Katrine Marcal. In addition to Swedish writers Timbro publishes international books on current events by, for instance, Deirdre McCloskey, Friedrich Hayek, Milton and Rose Friedman, and Ayn Rand.

In 2017, Timbro published the Timbro Authoritarian Populism Index 2017, which measures the rise of electoral support for populist parties across Europe from 1980 to 2017. It found that support had slowly been rising, with 9 European countries having populist parties in government at the time of the report. A follow-up report was published in 2024, where support for populist parties has consolidated since 2019, but showed little signs of expanding past current support levels.

Timbro has also established several educational programs. Sture Academy (see website), named after Sture Eskilsson, is a one-year program. Since 2003 it has offered courses in ideology and politics.

The Reform Academy is a program where students delve into practical, economic issues as well research relevant for policy issues dominating the current economic-political debate.

The Digital Academy (website here) is aimed at young persons belonging to classical liberal and center-to-right factions, and has its focus on digital communication.

In addition, Timbro provides a hands-on six week summer program where students can try their hand at actual research and the writing of reports in different areas.

<text>The Confederation of Swedish Enterprise or Swedish Enterprise () is a major employers&#x27; organization for private sector and business sector companies in Sweden. It has 49 member associations representing 60,000 member companies with more than 1.6 million employees.

==History==
The current organisation is the result of a merger between the Swedish Employers Association (, abbreviated SAF) and the Swedish National Federation of Industry () that was completed in March 2001.

==Policy==
Like its predecessors, the organisation is actively lobbying for pro-business interests. Tax cuts, especially the abolition of property and inheritance taxes, is a main priority. The organisation also promotes letting private enterprises take over the production of a larger part of services today mainly performed by the Swedish public sector, such as education and health services.

The Confederation of Swedish Enterprise finances Timbro — a liberal and economically liberal think tank — via the Swedish Free Enterprise Foundation ().

==Organisation==
Approximately 200 employees work in the Stockholm main office, the 22 regional offices in Sweden and the EU Brussels office. The Confederation of Swedish Enterprise is a member federation of BusinessEurope, representing 41 member federations from 34 European nations. The organization alone covers 69 per cent of private sector workers in Sweden (2017). Together with other employers&#x27; associations, the organization cover about 82 per cent of all private sector workers.

===Leadership===
===List of member organisations===
The Confederation of Swedish Enterprise&#x27;s members are employers&#x27; associations, trade associations or other groups of companies. Individual companies are members of the member organizations and thereby members of the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise.

<doc id="345472" wikidata="Q7899199" url="?curid=345472" title="Upright Citizens Brigade">
<text>The Upright Citizens Brigade (UCB) is an improvisational and sketch comedy group that emerged from Chicago&#x27;s ImprovOlympic in 1990. The original incarnation of the group consisted of Amy Poehler, Matthew Walsh, Matt Besser, Ian Roberts, Adam McKay, Rick Roman, Horatio Sanz and Drew Franklin. Other early members included Neil Flynn, Armando Diaz, Ali Farahnakian and Rich Fulcher.

In 2013, Besser, Roberts and Walsh wrote &quot;The Upright Citizens Brigade Comedy Improvisation Manual&quot;.

==History==

The Upright Citizens Brigade began performing improv and sketch comedy at Kill the Poet in Chicago. Their first show was called &quot;Virtual Reality&quot;. The group followed with shows titled &quot;UCBTV&quot;, &quot;Conference on the Future of Happiness&quot;, &quot;Thunderball&quot;, &quot;Bucket of Truth&quot;, &quot;Big Dirty Hands&quot;, &quot;The Real Real World&quot;, and &quot;Punch Your Friend in the Face&quot;.

In 1993, the Upright Citizens Brigade (Matt Besser, Ian Roberts, Amy Poehler, Adam McKay, Rick Roman, and Horatio Sanz) were regular guests on stage at the New Variety produced and hosted by Richard O&#x27;Donnell at the Chicago Improv comedy club, 504 N. Wells.

In 1996, prior to opening their own theatre, the Upright Citizens Brigade relocated to New York performing their signature improv show, ASSSSCAT, first at KGB Bar, and then later at Solo Arts. Solo Arts was the first semi-permanent home to the Upright Citizens Brigade&#x27;s Harold Teams and is considered by some to be the group&#x27;s first theatre. The shows and classes at Solo Arts were so popular that the UCB were able to open their own theater, the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, at 161 W. 22nd Street in Chelsea on February 4, 1999. This was a 75-seat auditorium that used to be the Harmony Burlesque Theater, an all-nude lap-dancing club—essentially a storefront. The original theatre was closed on November 18, 2002, after a building inspector ordered the theater to be shut down due to fire code violations. In the months that followed, the theater found a temporary home at the Access Theater on lower Broadway, then moved to the Chelsea Playhouse for a short time before finding a permanent space.

On April 1, 2003, the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre moved to its second official space in Chelsea, a 150-seat theater at 307 West 26th Street in NYC in the former Maverick Theater. The new venue had several advantages over the previous theater on 22nd Street, such as double capacity, a more professional tech booth, larger green room with a greater separation from the stage area, two dressing rooms, storage rooms, twice the number of bathrooms, and a &quot;chill out room&quot;.

In July 2005, the UCB opened at the Tamarind Theatre in Los Angeles at 5919 Franklin Avenue (between Tamarind &amp; North Bronson Avenue).

In September 2011, UCB opened a second theater on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, at 153 E 3rd St. This theater featured 124 seats, two lobbies, and a full bar known as the &quot;Hot Chicks Room&quot; in reference to an episode of the &quot;Upright Citizens Brigade&quot; TV show. Often referred to as &quot;the Beast&quot; (a portmanteau shortening of &quot;UCB East&quot;), the theater was initially opened in hopes of showcasing more stand-up comedy. This venue ran smaller-scale shows for $10 or less. The UCB East permanently closed on February 9, 2019. In its stead, the group once (but no longer) offered three nights of programming per week in the nearby SubCulture theatre on Bleecker Street.

At the start of 2017, ticket prices increased (the first in ten years). In October 2017, it was announced that the UCB Chelsea location would close. The last show in Chelsea was Wednesday, November 28, 2017.

The next UCB space, from November 30, 2017, was at 555 42nd Street in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, the former home to the Pearl Theatre Company.

The Upright Citizens Brigade has performed in the Comedy Tent at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, UCB had locations in the New York City neighborhoods of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen and the East Village, and on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this location and the New York training center were closed on Tuesday, April 21, 2020, leaving no NYC locations of UCB, with no confirmed plans for revival. However, on June 29, 2023, UCB announced its return to New York at 242 E. 14th Street, which will house a 130-seat theater, a bar, and a lounge. The space was expected to open in early 2024.

===Los Angeles===
In 2005, the Los Angeles branch of the theater opened at 5919 Franklin Avenue in Hollywood, offering improv, sketch and stand-up comedy shows nightly with a 120-seat capacity. Soon after, &quot;Comedy Bang! Bang!&quot; (formerly Comedy Death-Ray), a Los Angeles alternative comedy show, moved from its former home at the M Bar to join the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, appearing on Tuesday nights.

An expansion in Los Angeles started in 2014. In 2014, UCB announced the opening of UCB Theatre Sunset located at 5419 Sunset Boulevard for November 1. The venue played home to Upright Citizens Brigade&#x27;s training center, an 85-seat theatre, cafe/performance space called Inner Sanctum, video production offices, and even retail stores on street level. This location was sold in December 2020, leaving the Franklin theater as the only space owned by UCB.

In March 2022, former owner and CEO of &quot;The Onion&quot;, Mike McAvoy, and co-founder of Mosaic talent management, Jimmy Miller, acquired UCB and its lone remaining theater with the backing of venture capitalist Elysian Park. They reopened the UCB comedy theater and Los Angeles training centers in September 2022.

==Theatre==
The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre (shorter UCB Theatre or just UCB) is an American improvisational and sketch comedy training center and theatre, originally founded by UCB troupe members Matt Besser, Amy Poehler, Ian Roberts and Matt Walsh.

===Philosophy===
The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre Training Center teaches long-form improv, sketch, writing, parts of directing, and various other comedy skills. The training center&#x27;s philosophy of improv is based largely on the teachings of Del Close, with a strong emphasis on the &quot;game&quot; of the scene. In 2013, they co-authored a manual titled &quot;The Upright Citizens Brigade Comedy Improvisation Manual&quot;. The primary improvisational form is &quot;The Harold&quot;, and the theater in all its incarnations has had a group of &quot;Harold Teams&quot;, house teams that perform regularly.

==Screen ventures==
The original group, Matt Besser, Matt Walsh, Ian Roberts, and Amy Poehler, have had two TV shows—&quot;Upright Citizens Brigade&quot; and &quot;The UCB Show&quot;—and their show &quot;ASSSSCAT&quot; has been televised twice. In addition, they had a TV movie called &quot;Escape From It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; and appeared weekly on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in the &#x27;90s.

In 2002 they created and starred in the film &quot;Martin &amp; Orloff&quot;, and made another movie in 2007 titled &quot;Wild Girls Gone&quot;. Neither film was particularly successful or well received.

The group has participated in web series including the ongoing series &quot;UCB Comedy Originals&quot;, created in 2008, which occasionally shows sketches, and &quot;I Hate Being Single&quot;, created in 2012.

In 2016, Universal Cable Productions announced signing Upright Citizens Brigade to a first-look production deal.

==Pop culture==
&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; has been known for seeking top talent from UCB&#x27;s pool of students.

TV shows like &quot;The Chris Gethard Show&quot; created by Chris Gethard, and &quot;Broad City&quot; created by Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer, started out as UCB experiments.

<text>Birmingham Town Hall is a concert hall and venue for popular assemblies opened in 1834 and situated in Victoria Square, Birmingham, England. It is a Grade I listed building.

The hall underwent a major renovation between 2002 and 2007. It now hosts a diverse programme of events including jazz, world, folk, rock, pop and classical concerts, organ recitals, spoken word, dance, family, educational and community performances, as well as annual general meetings, product launches, conferences, dinners, fashion shows, graduation ceremonies and broadcasts.

==History==

The building was created as a home for the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival established in 1784, the purpose of which was to raise funds for the General Hospital, after St Philip&#x27;s Church (later to become a cathedral) became too small to hold the festival, and for public meetings.

Two sites were considered by the Birmingham Street Commissioners for the construction of a concert hall in the city; Bennetts Hill and the more expensive Paradise Street site. The latter was chosen and a design competition was launched which resulted with the submission of 67 designs including one by Charles Barry, whose design for the King Edward&#x27;s School on New Street was then under construction.

Joseph Hansom, of Hansom cab fame, and Edward Welch were chosen as the architects and they expressed that they expected the construction cost to be £8,000 (equivalent to £ in ). The first of the monumental town halls that would come to characterise the cities of Victorian England, Birmingham Town Hall was also the first significant work of the 19th-century revival of Roman architecture, a style chosen here in the context of the highly charged radicalism of 1830s Birmingham for its republican associations. The design was based on the proportions of the Temple of Castor and Pollux in the Roman Forum. &quot;Perfect and aloof&quot; on a tall, rusticated podium, it marked an entirely new concept in English architecture.

Hill of London was hired to build the 6,000 pipe organ for £6,000. Construction began on 27 April 1832 with an expected completion date of 1833. However, Hansom went bankrupt during construction, having tendered too low. The contractors were also losing money. Three guarantors donated money for the building; W. P. Lloyd, John Welch and Edward Tench. With the injection of this money, the building was successfully opened for the delayed Music Festival on 7 October 1834.

During construction, on 26 January 1833, two workers were killed when a 70-foot crane constructed to install the roof trusses broke and the pulley block failed. John Heap died instantly and William Badger died a few days later from his injuries. They were buried in St Philip&#x27;s churchyard and a memorial, consisting of a pillar base made by one of the workmen for the Town Hall, was dedicated to them. Architect Charles Edge was commissioned in 1835 to repair weaknesses to the design of the building. He was also commissioned for the extension of the building in 1837 and again in 1850.

At Christmas 1853, Charles Dickens gave the first of his public readings of his own works in the building, repeating this to raise money for the Birmingham and Midland Institute; and Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot; (August 1846), Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; (October 1900) and Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Overture di Ballo&quot; (August 1870) received their premieres in the hall as part of the Triennial Musical Festival which commissioned new works for every season. The hall was the home venue for the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra from 1918 until 1991 when they moved to Symphony Hall.

In November 1880, the Hall was filled to capacity for a Birmingham public protest meeting in support of Revd. Richard Enraght, Vicar of Holy Trinity, Bordesley, who was imprisoned in Warwick Prison under the Disraeli Government&#x27;s Public Worship Regulation Act. In December 1901, it was the scene of rioting on the occasion of a visit by David Lloyd George.

On 9 August 1902, the town hall, along with the council house, was illuminated in celebration of the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra.

In 1937, as part of the celebrations for the Coronation of George VI, the Town Hall was bedecked with the various Arms of the Lord of the Manor of Birmingham since 1166 and each column festooned with garlands. The pediment also had images of Britannia, supported by mermaids, which were sculpted by William Bloye. This decorative scheme for the Town Hall and the whole of the city was devised by William Haywood, Secretary of The Birmingham Civic Society.

Popular music has also featured, and in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, headline acts such as Buddy Holly, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, The Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan appeared.

It featured prominently in the 1967 Peter Watkins film &quot;Privilege&quot; and doubled for the Royal Albert Hall in the 1996 film &quot;Brassed Off&quot;.

===Renovations===

The Hall closed in 1996 for a £35 million refurbishment, undertaken by Wates Construction, that saw the Town Hall brought back to its original glory with its 6,000-pipe organ still in place. The project was funded by £18.3 million from Birmingham City Council, £13.7 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund and £3 million from the European Regional Development Fund. The upper gallery, which had been added in 1926–27, was removed, restoring the interior of the hall to an approximation of its original condition.

The Birmingham City Organist, Thomas Trotter, performed a piece of music to a group of school children in 2005 after the majority of the organ had been cleaned. However, the organist and the children all had to wear hard hats as the risk of falling debris remained. He had played the organ each month from the hall&#x27;s closure to 2005, thus ensuring that it was maintained in playable condition. The hall is now managed alongside Symphony Hall, by the registered charity Performances Birmingham Limited.
At 1,100, the seating capacity is about half that of Symphony Hall.

It reopened for concerts on 4 October 2007, 
and was officially reopened on 22 April 2008 by TRH The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall.

During the years of refurbishment the side of the Town Hall facing Victoria Square was hidden by giant advertising sheets, a giant advent calendar, and during the 2002 FIFA World Cup a large outside television screen that was used to broadcast live matches from Korea and Japan. Although the television screen was only temporary, another &quot;Big Screen&quot; was erected on the corner of the building in Chamberlain Square facing Birmingham Central Library, which broadcast live from the television channel BBC One. The BBC Big Screen was removed after much controversy.

==Architecture==

The hall takes the form of a free-standing Corinthian temple, with 14 bays running north to south and 8 bays east to west. It is closely modelled on the Temple of Castor and Pollux in Rome and reproduces its predecessor&#x27;s most distinctive feature – its tall podium – in rusticated stone. The building&#x27;s columns are topped with capitals featuring Acanthus leaves in a distinctive interlocking spiral design, above which the simplified entablature features a plain architrave and dentil cornice. Behind the colonnade the cella containing the Great Hall features tall windows capped with eared architraves. At the south end of the podium there is an arcade two bays deep, glazed in to form a vestibule in 1995, that marks the main entrance to the building.

The building is constructed in brick made in Selly Oak and faced with Penmon Anglesey Marble presented to the town by Sir Richard Bulkeley, proprietor of the Penmon quarries.

==Pipe organ==
The town hall is famous for its concert pipe organ. Originally installed in 1834 by William Hill &amp; Sons with 6,000 pipes, it was once the largest and most technologically advanced in the world. In 1888, Charles William Perkins was appointed the first City Organist, based at the Town Hall. The organ was restored by Willis in 1932.

<text>Scherrie Ann Payne (born November 4, 1944) is an American singer. Payne is best known as a member and the co lead singer of the R&amp;B/Soul vocal group the Supremes from 1973 until 1977. Payne is the younger sister of singer Freda Payne. Payne continues to perform, both as a solo act and as a part of the &quot;Former Ladies of the Supremes&quot; (FLOS).

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Payne was born Scherrie Ann Payne on November 4, 1944, to Frederick Payne and Charcle Lee Farley (c. 1920-1977), in Detroit, Michigan. Payne is a graduate of Central High School, where she graduated in 1961, and Michigan State University, where she also graduated in 1966 with a Bachelor of Science degree. Before she began her career, she taught at the Grayling School of Observation. In 1964, she appeared on the Jet magazine as queen of the co-educational Cass Hall.

=== Glass House ===
Prior to her tenure with The Supremes, Payne was the lead singer for the group Glass House. Other members included Ty Hunter (later with The Originals), Pearl Jones, and Larry Mitchell. The group signed with Invictus Records, formed by longtime Motown songwriters Eddie and Brian Holland, and Lamont Dozier, in 1969, among other popular acts of the early 1970s, including Freda Payne (who had a #1 hit in 1970 with &quot;Band Of Gold&quot;), and Honey Cone, who had a #1 hit with &quot;Want Ads&quot;. In an ironic twist of fate, &quot;Want Ads&quot; was originally recorded by Glass House with Scherrie on lead vocals. The Payne sisters together made a new version, but did not like the song and when Honey Cone&#x27;s lead vocalist Edna Wright walked by in the studio they suggested she should sing it. Unfortunately, The Glass House did not meet this same success. The group saw their biggest hit in 1969 with the Payne-led track &quot;Crumbs Off The Table&quot; which managed the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 10. Between the years of 1970 and 1972, The Glass House released two albums and nine singles, including Scherrie&#x27;s solo track &quot;V.I.P.&quot;. &quot;Record World&quot; ranked The Glass House as the fifth &#x27;Top Vocal Combination Group&#x27; in their &quot;1970 R&amp;B Awards&quot;. However, they never really repeated the success of their first single release. They quietly disbanded in 1972, after the release of their album &quot;Thanks, I Needed That.&quot;

===The Supremes (1973–77)===

As a new member of the Supremes joining Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong, Payne often remained quiet during interviews with the group mainly because four years later, reporters were still asking about Diana Ross. Payne contributed as the lead singer to the group, with Birdsong and Wilson singing background. Payne sang lead on the single &quot;He&#x27;s My Man&quot; (which also featured vocals by Mary Wilson) and &quot;It&#x27;s All Been Said Before&quot;, both taken from the album &quot;The Supremes&quot;. An accomplished songwriter, Payne was never able to write any material for The Supremes, which reportedly disappointed her.

Payne began to realize that Motown did not really care as much about the Supremes as they had in the 1960s, due to the changing musical tastes of the era. Payne&#x27;s contributions did enable The Supremes to enter the disco era, however, with such dance hits as &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Let My Heart Do the Walking&quot; from the album &quot;High Energy&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re My Driving Wheel&quot;, &quot;Let Yourself Go&quot;, and &quot;Love I Never Knew You Could Feel So Good&quot;. While each of these disco songs landed in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Top Ten, they did not perform as well on the pop and R&amp;B charts. The single &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Let My Heart Do The Walking&quot; was a #3 hit on the Disco charts, rose in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 to #25 on the R&amp;B chart, and #40 on the Pop chart.

The final three Supremes (Payne, Wilson and Susaye Greene) officially disbanded in 1977 with a farewell concert in London, with Supremes founding member Mary Wilson announcing that she would embark on a solo career. Payne and Greene then tried to recruit a new third member, Joyce Vincent Wilson of Tony Orlando and Dawn, but Motown responded with that the Supremes would not continue with original members. Motown officially retired the Supremes in 1977, but offered Payne and Greene a contract to record as a duet. During this time, Payne released the solo single &quot;Fly&quot; b/w &quot;When I Look at Your Face&quot; in late 1977. As a duet, &quot;Partners&quot;, under the name &quot;Scherrie and Susaye&quot; was released in 1979. The album received mixed reviews and the two decided to part in order to embark on solo projects.

===Former Ladies of the Supremes===

In 1986, Payne joined former members of the Supremes, Jean Terrell and briefly, Cindy Birdsong, to form The Former Ladies Of The Supremes or by its abbreviation, &quot;FLOS&quot;. When Birdsong left to pursue a solo career, Lynda Laurence took her place and they renamed themselves &quot;Jean, Scherrie, &amp; Lynda of the Supremes&quot;, recording the single &quot;We&#x27;re Back&#x27;, featuring Ali-Ollie Woodson of the Temptations. Throughout the 1980s and the 1990s, they traveled worldwide to continue the Supremes&#x27; legacy. When Terrell departed, the group continued with Laurence&#x27;s sister Sundray Tucker, who was a former member of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s back-up group, Wonder Love, and this lineup worked prolifically with British record producer Steve Weaver, resulting in a catalogue of 40 new recordings, some of them re-recordings of the Supremes&#x27; original hits. Payne and Laurence continued to tour under the FLOS name with third new member Freddi Poole, who joined the group in 1996 replacing Sundray Tucker. In 2000, Payne and Laurence backed Ross on the &quot;Return To Love&quot; Supremes reunion tour, in which Diana allowed each of them to lead one of the classic Supremes songs. The group celebrated their 20th anniversary in 2006 (with Birdsong, Tucker and Greene in the audience), and around this time began using the group name &quot;Scherrie &amp; Lynda of the Supremes&quot;. In September 2009, Vincent joined Payne and Laurence in the group, replacing Freddi Poole, who departed to join the Three Degrees. In 2017, Laurence left the group after 31 years with her tenure in the group, and was replaced by Greene. In 2024, Greene departed, and Laurence returned. As of 2025, the FLO&#x27;s (Payne, Laurence, and Vincent), tour the world, keeping the Supremes legacy alive.

===Solo work===
As a solo artist, in addition to &quot;V.I.P.&quot;, which she recorded while a member of the group Glass House and was featured on their second album, Payne has had club hits, such as a cover version of 10cc&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Not In Love&quot; (featuring her sister [Freda], Edmund Sylvers, and Wilson on backing vocals) in 1982, followed two years later by &quot;One Night Only&quot;, a song from Act II of the musical &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, which is a musical based loosely on the history of the Supremes and the advancing of the Motown sound into the disco era. The 12&quot; Megatone Label Disco Single also featured Birdsong on background vocals. Both songs were produced by Rick Gianatos, whom Payne currently records with. Payne recorded a solo album for Superstar International Records which contained several duets with Phillip Ingram. The following year, Payne signed with British producer Ian Levine for his Motown reunion project, Motorcity Records. While with Ian, Payne released two solo singles &quot;Chasing Me Into Somebody Else&#x27;s Arms&quot; (which was originally recorded in 1979 with Levine and Gianatos) and &quot;Pure Energy&quot; (co-written by Payne and released on Nightmare Records), as well as covers of two of Ross&#x27; songs, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Still Waiting&quot;. Other product recorded for Motorcity included &quot;Who&#x27;s Wrong, Who&#x27;s Right&quot;; &quot;Hit &amp; Miss&quot;; and &quot;One More Time.&quot;

===Later career===
In August 2001, Payne was invited to perform at the annual prestigious open-air festival Sunset Junction Street Fair in Los Angeles. She performed Supremes&#x27; classics such as &quot;Stoned Love&quot; and &quot;My World Is Empty Without You&quot; in addition to a couple of her own solo hits, &quot;I&#x27;m Not In Love&quot; and &quot;Another Life From Now&quot;. She made a return to performing at Sunset Junction the following year, performing a similar set. On January 14, 2007, Payne was the special guest star at the &quot;If My Friends Could See Me Now&quot; fund-raiser in Los Angeles, California. She performed her previous hit &quot;One Night Only&quot;, from the musical &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;. Backing her were long-time friends Pam and Joyce Vincent. In 2012, Payne (along with longtime producer Rick Gianatos) recorded and released a version of the Supremes hit &quot;Let Yourself Go&quot; along with a music video. In late 2013, Payne lent her vocals to the Pattie Brooks single &quot;I Like The Way You Move&quot;; she can be seen in the accompanying video as one of the judges. On July 5, 2014, Payne along with Greene performed at the Sheraton in Los Angeles a concert program based on their album &quot;Partners&quot; which was released by Motown in 1979. They were subsequently featured in the magazine Daeida, with a photo shoot; the accompanying article chronicled career highlights with the Supremes and separately as well as the re-release of their &quot;Partners&quot; album on CD.

In 2023, Payne was inducted into the Women Songwriters Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==

From 1973 until 1977, Scherrie dated songwriter Lamont Dozier. She was also rumoured to be in a relationship with Lawrence McCutcheon. Later, she dated Ronnie Phillips (d. 2003). Phillips was the owner of the Dangerous Records label. Together they have one daughter, Shoshanna Payne-Phillips (b. 1985).

Investor AB was established in Stockholm when new Swedish legislation made it more difficult for banks to own stocks in industrial companies on a long-term basis. The shareholdings of the Wallenberg family bank, Stockholms Enskilda Bank, were transferred to Investor AB, a newly formed industrial holding company spun off from the bank, which would serve as the family&#x27;s investment arm henceforth.

<doc id="345491" wikidata="Q230512" url="?curid=345491" title="Phyllis Diller">
<text>Phyllis Ada Diller (née Driver; July 17, 1917 – August 20, 2012) was an American stand-up comedian, actress, author, musician, and visual artist, best known for her eccentric stage persona, self-deprecating humor, wild hair and clothes, and exaggerated, cackling laugh.

Diller was one of the first female comics to become a household name in the U.S., credited as an influence by Joan Rivers, Roseanne Barr, and Ellen DeGeneres, among others. She had a large gay following. She was also one of the first celebrities to openly champion plastic surgery, for which she was recognized by the cosmetic surgery industry.

Diller contributed to more than 40 films, beginning with 1961&#x27;s &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot;. She appeared in many television series, featuring in numerous cameos as well as her own short-lived sitcom and variety show. Some of her credits include &quot;Night Gallery, The Muppet Show, CHiPs, The Love Boat, Cybill&quot;, and &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, plus 11 seasons of &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. Her voice-acting roles included the monster&#x27;s wife in &quot;Mad Monster Party&quot;, the Queen in &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, Granny Neutron in &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;, and Thelma Griffin in &quot;Family Guy&quot;.

==Early life==
Diller was born Phyllis Ada Driver in Lima, Ohio on July 17, 1917, the only child of Perry Marcus Driver, an insurance agent, and Frances Ada (née Romshe). She had German and Irish ancestry (the surname &quot;Driver&quot; had been changed from &quot;Treiber&quot; several generations earlier).&lt;ref name=&quot;famousfolks/phyllisd&quot;&gt;
*famousfolks/phyllisd/nindex
*Perry Marcus Driver
&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised Methodist but was a lifelong atheist, even in childhood. Her father and mother were older than most when she was born (55 and 36, respectively) and Diller attended several funerals while growing up. The exposure to death at a young age led her to an early appreciation for life and she later realized that her comedy was a form of therapy.

Diller attended Lima&#x27;s Central High School, discovering early on she had comic gifts. Later, Diller observed, &quot;I was always a pro— even as a little tiny kid. I was an absolutely perfect, quiet, dedicated student in class. But outside of class, I got my laughs.&quot; Diller studied piano for three&lt;ref name=&quot;interviews.televisionacademy/diller-95&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; years at the Sherwood Music Conservatory of Columbia College Chicago, but decided against a career in music after hearing her teachers and mentors play with much more skill than she thought that she would be able to achieve, and transferred to Bluffton College where she studied literature, history, psychology, and philosophy.

==Career==
===1930s–1950s===

In 1939, she met Sherwood Diller, the brother of a classmate at Bluffton, and they eloped, marrying in Bluffton on November 4, 1939. Diller did not finish college and was primarily a homemaker, taking care of their five children (a sixth child died in infancy).

During World War II, Sherwood worked at the Willow Run B-24 Bomber Plant, in Ypsilanti Charter Township, Michigan.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes/2012-aug-21-la-me-diller&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, Sherwood Diller was transferred to Naval Air Station Alameda&lt;ref name=&quot;vpnavy/nats_history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Alameda, California,&lt;ref name=&quot;mercurynews/alameda-hello-new&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; where he was an inspector.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nachman/Comedians-1950s-1960s&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Diller began working as the women&#x27;s editor at a small newspaper, and as an advertising copywriter for an Oakland department store.

In 1952, Diller began working in broadcasting at KROW radio in Oakland, California. In November of that year, she filmed several 15-minute episodes of &quot;Phyllis Dillis, the Homely Friendmaker&quot;—dressed in a housecoat to offer absurd &quot;advice&quot; to homemakers.&lt;ref name=&quot;tralfaz/mrs-fang&quot;&gt;
*
&lt;/ref&gt; The 15-minute series was a &quot;Bay Area Radio-Television&quot; production, directed for television by ABC&#x27;s Jim Baker.&lt;ref name=&quot;nypl/research/b15454072&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Diller also worked as a copywriter, later, director of promotion and marketing, at KSFO radio in San Francisco and a vocalist for a music-review TV show called &quot;Pop Club&quot;, hosted by Don Sherwood.

At age 37, on March 7, 1955, at the North Beach, San Francisco basement club,&lt;ref name=&quot;alexhaley/phyllis-diller&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Purple Onion, she made her professional stand-up debut.&lt;ref name=&quot;smh.au/20120821-24kew&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Up until then, she had only tried out her jokes for fellow PTA members at nearby Edison Elementary School. Maya Angelou, who was already performing at the club, wrote that Diller &quot;would not change her name because when she became successful she wanted everyone to know it was, indeed, her herself&quot;. Her first professional show was a success and the two-week booking stretched out to a record 89 consecutive weeks. Diller had found her calling and eventual financial success while her husband&#x27;s business career failed. She explained, &quot;I became a stand-up comedian because I had a sit-down husband.&quot;

In a 1986 NPR interview, Diller said she had no idea what she was doing when she started playing clubs and in the beginning, she never saw another woman on the comedy circuit. With no female role models in a male-dominated industry, she initially used props and drew from her educational and work background as a basis for satire, spoofing classical music concerts and advice columns. She wrote her own material and kept a file cabinet full of her gags, honing her nightclub act. Sid Caesar, Milton Berle, and Jonathan Winters were early influences, but Diller developed a singular comedic persona — a surreal version of femininity. This absurd caricature with garish baggy dresses and gigantic, clownish hair made fun of her lack of sex appeal while brandishing a cigarette holder (with a wooden cigarette because she didn&#x27;t smoke), punctuating the humor with a hearty cackle to show she was in on the joke. At the time, Diller said, &quot;They had no idea what I was. It was like—&#x27;Get a stick and kill it before it multiplies!&#x27;&quot;

Her first national television appearance was as a contestant on Groucho Marx&#x27;s quiz show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; in 1958. Multiple bookings on the Jack Paar &quot;Tonight Show&quot; led to an appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, which brought her national prominence as she continued to perform stand-up throughout the U.S.

Starting in 1959 and throughout the 1960s, she released multiple comedy albums, including the titles &quot;Wet Toe in a Hot Socket!&quot;, &quot;Laughs&quot;, &quot;Are You Ready for Phyllis Diller?&quot;, and &quot;The Beautiful Phyllis Diller&quot;.

===1960s===
From 1961 to 1965, Phyllis Diller lived in Webster Groves, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis.&lt;ref name=&quot;stlmag/St-Louis-Homes-Phyllis-Diller&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stltoday/obituaries/the-webster-groves-housewife&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stltoday/1966-phyllis-diller-carries-on&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;timesnewspapers/diller-1917-2012&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Several of her children had stayed with Sherwood&#x27;s relatives in St. Louis, and the oldest, Peter, attended Washington University.

In the early &#x27;60s, Diller performed at the Bon Soir in Greenwich Village, where an up-and-coming Barbra Streisand was her opening act. She was offered film work and became famous after co-starring with her mentor Bob Hope, who described her as &quot;a Warhol mobile of spare parts picked up along a freeway.&quot; They worked together in films such as &quot;Boy, Did I Get a Wrong Number!&quot;, &quot;Eight on the Lam&quot;, and &quot;The Private Navy of Sgt. O&#x27;Farrell&quot;, all critically panned, but &quot;Boy...&quot; did well at the box office. Diller accompanied Hope to Vietnam in 1966 with his USO troupe near the height of the Vietnam War.

She appeared regularly as a special guest on many television programs including &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;. She was a Mystery Guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; but the blindfolded panel (including Sammy Davis Jr.) were able to discern Diller&#x27;s identity in three guesses. Diller made regular cameo appearances, making her trademark wisecracks on &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;. Self-deprecating to a fault, a typical Diller joke had her running after a garbage truck pulling away from her curb. &quot;Am I too late for the trash?&quot; she&#x27;d yell. The driver&#x27;s reply: &quot;No, jump right in!&quot; She became a semi-regular on &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot;, starting in 1967, appearing in 28 episodes until 1980.

Diller continued to work in film, making an appearance as Texas Guinan, the wisecracking nightclub hostess in &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot;. Throughout the 1960s, she appeared in more than a dozen, usually low-budget, films. She also began a career in voice work, providing the voice of the Monster&#x27;s Mate in &quot;Mad Monster Party&quot; (1967).

Diller also starred in the short-lived TV series &quot;The Pruitts of Southampton&quot; (1966–1967); later retitled &quot;The Phyllis Diller Show&quot;, a half-hour sitcom on ABC. She received a Golden Globe nomination in 1967 for her role in &quot;Pruitts&quot;. Diller hosted a variety show in 1968 titled &quot;The Beautiful Phyllis Diller Show&quot;.

Beginning December 26, 1969, she had a three-month run in &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; (opposite Richard Deacon), as the second to last in a succession of replacements for Carol Channing in the title role, which included Ginger Rogers, Martha Raye, Betty Grable, and Pearl Bailey. After Diller&#x27;s stint, Ethel Merman took over the role until the end of the show&#x27;s run in December 1970.

===1970–2012===

Diller continued working in television throughout the 1970s and 80s, appearing as a judge on premiere and subsequent episodes of &quot;The Gong Show&quot; and as a panelist on the &quot;Match Game PM&quot; show. She also guest-starred in &quot;The Mouse Factory&quot;, &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, &quot;Love American Style&quot;, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, &quot;CHiPs&quot; and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. In 1978, she hosted a Showtime comedy special which featured Robin Tyler, who became the first out lesbian on U.S. national television. Between 1999 and 2003 she played roles in &quot;7th Heaven&quot; and &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;.

Her successful career as a voice actor continued when Diller guested as herself in &quot;A Good Medium is Rare,&quot; a 1972 episode of &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;. In 1998, Diller provided the voice of the Queen in &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;. Among her other animated films are &quot;The Nutcracker Prince&quot; (1990, as Mousequeen), &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; (1990, as Mother Nature), and &quot;Casper&#x27;s Scare School&quot; (2006, as Aunt Spitzy).

She voiced characters in several television series, including &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Wait Till Your Father Gets Home&quot;, &quot;Captain Planet&quot;, &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot;, &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; as Arnold&#x27;s grandpa&#x27;s sister Mitzi, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Neutron&quot; as Jimmy&#x27;s grandmother, &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;, and &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. She also played Peter Griffin&#x27;s mother, Thelma, on &quot;Family Guy&quot; in 2006.

===Retirement===
Citing advanced age and a lack of &quot;lasting energy,&quot; Diller retired from stand-up in 2002. Her final performance was at the Suncoast that year in Las Vegas, Nevada. At the time she stated, &quot;If you can&#x27;t dance to comedy, forget it. It&#x27;s music.&quot; The 2004 documentary &quot;Goodnight, We Love You: The Life and Legend of Phyllis Diller&quot;, directed by Gregg Barson, was shot on the night of her last performance. It follows Diller to a press conference, backstage, and into her home, to cover the story of her career. Rip Taylor, Don Rickles, Roseanne Barr, Red Buttons, Jo Anne Worley and Lily Tomlin are featured, discussing Diller&#x27;s comedy legacy.

Although retired from the stand-up circuit, Diller never fully left the entertainment industry. In 2005, she was featured as one of many contemporary comics in &quot;The Aristocrats&quot;. Diller, who avoided blue comedy, did a version of an old, risqué vaudeville routine, in which she describes herself passing out when she first heard the joke, forgetting the actual content of the joke.

On January 24, 2007, Diller appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and performed stand-up before chatting with Jay Leno. Leno has stated that Diller would infrequently call him to contribute jokes during his time as the host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. The same year she had a cameo appearance portraying herself in an episode of &quot;Boston Legal&quot;. In 2011, she appeared in an episode of her friend Roseanne Barr&#x27;s reality show &quot;Roseanne&#x27;s Nuts&quot;.

In January 2012, she recorded a version of Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s song &quot;Smile&quot; with Pink Martini&#x27;s Thomas Lauderdale for the album &quot;Get Happy&quot;.

===Author===

Publishing her first best seller in 1966 and releasing more throughout the decade, Diller&#x27;s books on domestic life featured her self-deprecating humor. The titles include &quot;Phyllis Diller&#x27;s Housekeeping Hints&quot;, &quot;Phyllis Diller&#x27;s Marriage Manual&quot;, and &quot;The Complete Mother&quot;. In 1981 she published &quot;The Joys of Aging &amp; How to Avoid Them&quot;.

Her autobiography, &quot;Like a Lampshade in a Whorehouse – My Life in Comedy&quot;, co-written with Richard Buskin, was published in 2006. In it, Diller told of an unhappy childhood with undemonstrative, emotionally withholding parents, and an equally unhappy first marriage. From these beginnings, her performing style—telling rapid-fire jokes—emerged, which she compared to music: &quot;One joke followed the other with a flow and a rhythm. ... Everything had a natural feel to it.&quot;

In the early 1990s, Diller had many short, humorous pieces published in &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;.

===Musician===
Diller had studied the piano for many years and was an accomplished player but decided against a career in music after hearing her teachers and mentors play with much more skill than she thought that she would be able to achieve. She still played in her private life, however, and owned a custom-made harpsichord.

Between 1971 and 1981, Diller appeared as a piano soloist with symphony orchestras across the country under the stage name Dame Illya Dillya. Her performances were spiced with humor, but she took the music seriously. A review of one of her concerts in &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; called her &quot;a fine concert pianist with a firm touch.&quot;

===Artist===
Diller, a self-taught artist, began painting in 1963. She worked in acrylics, watercolors, and oils throughout the 1970s and filled her Brentwood, California home with her portraits and still lifes. In 2003, at age 86, she held the first of several &quot;art parties,&quot; selling her artwork along with her stage clothes and costume jewelry.

==Personal life==
Diller credited much of her success to a motivational book, &quot;The Magic of Believing&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=V6hKpG7efVQC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (1948) by Claude M. Bristol, which gave her confidence at the start of her career.&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy/159314611&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She was married and divorced twice. She had six children from her marriage with her first husband Sherwood Anderson Diller, and she outlived two of her grown children.

Diller&#x27;s second husband was actor Warde Donovan, whom she married on October 7, 1965. She filed for divorce three months later, after discovering Donovan was bisexual and an alcoholic, but they reconciled on the day before the divorce was to become final. The couple divorced in 1975. Robert P. Hastings was her partner from 1985 until his death on May 23, 1996. In a 2000 interview, she called him the love of her life, saying that he admired her for being an independent person. The character of &quot;Fang,&quot; the husband whom she frequently mentioned in her act, sprang from an appropriation of elements of the comic strip The Lockhorns.

Diller portrayed herself as a horrible cook in her stand-up routines, but she was reputed to be an excellent cook. She licensed her recipe for chili and sold it nationally as &quot;Phyllis Diller Chili&quot;.

Diller candidly discussed her plastic surgery, a series of procedures first undertaken when she was 55, and she wrote that she had undergone 15 procedures. Her numerous surgeries were the subject of a &quot;20/20&quot; segment on February 12, 1993.

==Illness and death==
By 1997, as she passed her 80th birthday, Diller began to suffer from various ailments. In 1999, her heart stopped during a hospital stay. She was fitted with a pacemaker but had a bad drug reaction and became paralyzed. Through physical therapy, she was able to walk again. Approaching age 90, Diller retired from stand-up comedy appearances.

On July 11, 2007, &quot;USA Today&quot; reported that she had fractured her back and had to cancel an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, during which she had planned to celebrate her 90th birthday. On May 15, 2012, Diller conducted her final interview accepting the &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot; award from her hometown of Lima, Ohio, as part of a panel of comedians.

Diller died at home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles on August 20, 2012, at age 95, from heart failure. She was cremated, and her ashes were scattered at sea.

==Influence and legacy==

Diller was one of the first solo female comedians in the U.S. to become a household name. She stated that making people laugh is a powerful art form. As a pioneering woman in the stand-up field, she inspired many female comedians including Joan Rivers, Lily Tomlin, Ellen DeGeneres, Margaret Cho and Roseanne Barr. Diller herself was influenced by comedy books and appropriated from sources like &quot;The Lockhorns&quot;.

Barr, who listened to Diller&#x27;s records as a child, called her a true artist and revolutionary, saying, &quot;It was timeless, that wacky, tacky character she created; the cigarette holder was genius, paradoxically regal. She was a victorious loser hero, the female iteration of Chaplin&#x27;s Little Tramp.&quot;

Fellow comic Joan Rivers paid tribute to Diller&#x27;s early-career woman&#x27;s point of view, saying, &quot;She was the first one that there was such rage and such anger in her comedy. She had the anger that is now in all of us. And that&#x27;s what made it so funny because she spoke for all these women that were sitting home with five children and a husband that didn&#x27;t work.&quot;

Diller had a large gay following from the beginning of her career, once saying, &quot;My first audience were gay people because they have a great sense of humor.&quot; An obituary in Queerty noted her popularity with gay audiences calling her a &quot;strong-willed entertainer who challenged the status quo regarding gender and sexuality.&quot; She enjoyed the company of gay men, writing in her memoir, &quot;Like a Lampshade in a Whorehouse: My Life in Comedy&quot;: &quot;Gay men have the most wonderful sense of humor. And they are willing to laugh. They appeal to me and I appeal to them.&quot; In 2021, Ginger Minj portrayed Diller in the Snatch Game of Love on the sixth season of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race All Stars&quot;.

A &quot;New York Times&quot; remembrance noted that Diller&#x27;s flamboyant look is echoed in Lady Gaga&#x27;s concert attire and that Eddie Murphy also punctuated jokes with a loud laugh, in a style reminiscent of Diller&#x27;s persona.

Diller was an outspoken proponent of plastic surgery at a time when cosmetic procedures were secretive. Her public admission to having several facelifts, nose jobs and other procedures added promotional and comedic value to her act. She told Bob Hope in 1971 that she had had a facelift because &quot;I got sick and tired of having the dog drag me out to the yard and bury me.&quot; The American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery gave her an award for bringing plastic surgery &quot;out of the closet.&quot;

In 2003, after hearing of the donation of Archie Bunker&#x27;s chair to the Smithsonian Institution, Diller opened her doors to the National Museum of American History. She offered them some of her most iconic costume pieces, as well as her gag file, a steel cabinet with 48 file drawers with more than 50,000 jokes she had written on index cards during her career. In 2011, the Albert H. Small Documents Gallery at the National Museum of American History displayed Diller&#x27;s file and some of the objects that became synonymous with her comedic persona—an unkempt wig, wrist-length gloves, cloth-covered ankle boots, and a bejeweled cigarette holder.

<text>The Baltimore Development Corporation (BDC) is a nonprofit corporation and public-private agency contracted by the City of Baltimore to promote economic development.

==History/Mergers==
The City of Baltimore Development Corporation (BDC) traces its origins to 1991 when it was established under the Mayor Kurt Schmoke administration. BDC resulted from the consolidation of three predecessor organizations: City Center - Inner Harbor Development Inc., Baltimore Economic Development Corporation (BEDCO), and the Market Center Redevelopment Authority. Established as a non-profit corporation, BDC received its 501c3 status in 1992. Over the last three decades, BDC has continuously evolved and currently operates as the city&#x27;s principal economic development agency. 

In its developmental journey, BDC made significant strides. In 1994, it founded the Emerging Technology Centers (ETC), aiming to foster innovation. Later, in 2018, the establishment of Made in Baltimore (MIB) as a BDC program further expanded its initiatives. Both ETC and MIB operate as separate non-profit entities, primarily funded by BDC. 

BDC’s mission is to is to grow the city’s economy in an inclusive manner by retaining, expanding, and attracting businesses and promoting investment, thereby increasing career opportunities for residents. 

The merger came in the wake of an expansion of the Open Meetings Act provoked by the City Council&#x27;s frustration with the opacity of CC-IH.

==Structure==
The BDC is not directly accountable to the municipal government of Baltimore. However, its board is appointed by the Mayor, and many of its economic programs require approval from the Baltimore City Council.

===&quot;City of Baltimore Development Corporation v. Carmel Realty Associates&quot;===
The BDC has a complicated legal status because it is a public-private status agency, also a non-profit organization, but also closely involved in City business. Criticisms of the BDC&#x27;s secrecy and its predecessors since the early 1980s amid infamous charges then of a &quot;shadow government&quot; against the administration of then Mayor William Donald Schaefer, (1921-2011), [served 1971-1986], by the then Baltimore City Council President Walter S. Orlinsky and long-time financial/political &quot;gadfly&quot; Comptroller of the City, Hyman A. Pressman, (1914-1996), which circulated in the Baltimore media, including especially The Baltimore Sun, resulted in a 2006 Maryland Court of Appeals case titled &quot;City of Baltimore Development Corporation v. Carmel Realty Associates&quot;.

In this case, the court ruled that the BDC &quot;was&quot; subject to the Maryland &quot;Public Information Act&quot; and the Maryland &quot;Open Meetings Act&quot;, rules that, like the federal &quot;Freedom of Information Act&quot;, require government bodies to disclose information to citizens. The main rationale for this decision was the mayor&#x27;s control over the appointment of the board.

The updated version of the Maryland &quot;Public Information Act Manual&quot; now reads: &quot;A nonprofit entity incorporated under the State’s general corporation law may also be considered a unit or instrumentality of a political subdivision for purposes of the PIA, if there is a sufficient nexus linking the entity to the local government. See Baltimore Development Corp. v. Carmel Realty Associates, 395 Md. 299, 910 A.2d 406 (2006) (nonprofit corporation formed to plan and implement long range development strategies in city was subject to substantial control by city and thus was instrumentality of city subject to PIA)&quot;.

==Tax credits==
One of the BDC&#x27;s major functions is to help businesses receive tax credits. The official rule for these credits is a &quot;but for&quot; test: they are only to be used when the project would not go into effect without them.

The BDC mediates several types of credits:

===Payment in lieu of taxes===
Payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) is an agreement under which a company can pay the city an agreed-upon amount instead of the property taxes they would normally be assessed.

The BDC controlled 12 PILOTs as of October 2011. These represented $12.8 million in tax exemptions; the properties corresponding generated $15.4 million in other taxes (e.g., parking, energy, telephone).

===Tax increment financing===

Tax increment financing (TIF) is a way of subsidizing current development based on the expectation of future tax gains. To pay for a TIF subsidy, the city issues a bond, which it expect to pay back based later from taxes.

The state of Maryland authorized Baltimore to use TIFs in 1994; however, the city was required to secure voter approval through referendum and none were issued. In 2000, new legislation allowed the city to implement TIFs without voter approval.

As of October 2011, the BDC had issued 10 TIFs in Baltimore. (With one TIF issued to East Baltimore Development Inc. under direct city control.) These already represent a debt for the city of $135 million, with $315 million worth of additional bonds still to be issued.

===Enterprise Zone===
The BDC is responsible for Baltimore City&#x27;s Enterprise Zones (EZs); businesses inside these zones are eligible for special tax credits. EZ &quot;Focus Areas&quot; offer extra benefits.

==Projects==
The BDC oversees development of major downtown projects, as well as development of Baltimore city-owned business and industrial parks.

The corporation and the City are under public criticism for the planning, financing and construction of the Hilton Baltimore Convention Center Hotel. The $301 million, 750-room hotel near the city baseball and football stadiums is an almost entirely publicly funded project (through city bonds), expected to open in August 2008. Hilton Hotels Corporation is expected to contribute around $7.1 million to the project.

===Emerging Technologies Center===
The Emerging Technologies Center (ETC) is business incubator intended to support growing technology and biotechnology companies. The ETC had facilities in Canton and at Johns Hopkins Eastern. Its former President and Executive Director since April 2012 was Deborah A. Tillett.

The ETC ran a program called &quot;AcclerateBaltimore&quot; that gave $25,000 to emerging companies trying to bring a product to market. Of the four companies receiving this funding in 2012, three are developing web applications and one concerns machine learning. The program required these companies to stay in Baltimore for five years.

==Current proposals==
From the BDC press room:
* The Cordish Company is requesting a PILOT subsidy for a $65 million mixed-use development at 701 E. Baltimore St.
* Two companies have submitted competing proposals for a new carousel at the Inner Harbor between the Maryland Science Center and Rash Field (which has existed at that site for decades).
* The BDC is considering changes to the area eligible for Enterprise Zone status; these changes would subsidize a development at Harbor Point (near Harbor East).
*Mayfair Theatre precinct

==Legal status==
The BDC was the subject of a 2006 Maryland court ruling declaring that its board of directors meetings and all internal documents were subject to Freedom of Information Act requests under the Maryland state sunshine law.

<doc id="345495" wikidata="Q1996477" url="?curid=345495" title="Noongar">
<text>The Noongar (, also spelt Noongah, Nyungar , Nyoongar, Nyoongah, Nyungah, Nyugah, and Yunga ) are Aboriginal Australian people who live in the south-west corner of Western Australia, from Geraldton on the west coast to Esperance on the south coast. There are 14 different groups in the Noongar cultural bloc: Amangu, Ballardong, Yued, Kaneang, Koreng, Mineng, Njakinjaki, Njunga, Pibelmen, Pindjarup, Wadandi, Whadjuk, Wiilman and Wudjari. The Noongar people refer to their land as .

The members of the collective Noongar cultural bloc descend from people who spoke several languages and dialects that were often mutually intelligible. What is now classified as the Noongar language is a member of the large Pama–Nyungan language family. Contemporary Noongar speak Australian Aboriginal English (a dialect of the English language) laced with Noongar words and occasionally inflected by its grammar. Most contemporary Noongar trace their ancestry to one or more of these groups. In the 2011 Australian census, 10,549 people identified as indigenous in the south-west of Western Australia. By 2021, this number had increased to 14,355. 

==Name==
The endonym of the Noongar comes from a word originally meaning &quot;man&quot; or &quot;person&quot;.

==Language==

At the time of European settlement, it is believed that the peoples of what became the Noongar community spoke thirteen dialects, of which five still have speakers with some knowledge of their respective versions of the language. No speakers use it over the complete range of everyday speaking situations, and the full resources of the language are available only to a few individuals.

==Ecological context==
The Noongar peoples have six seasons whose time frame is defined by specific observable changes to the environment, with a dry period varying from as few as three to as many as eleven months. Tribes are spread over three different geological systems: the coastal plains, the plateau, and the plateau margins; all areas are characterized by relatively infertile soil. The north is characterized by casuarina, acacia, and melaleuca thickets, and the south by mulga scrubland, but it also supports dense forest stands. Several rivers run to the coast, and lakes and wetlands provided the Noongar people with their distinctive food and vegetation resources.

Generally, Noongar made a living by hunting and trapping a variety of game, including kangaroos, possums and wallabies; for people close to the coastal zone or riverine systems, spear-fishing or culling fish in traps was customary. An extensive range of edible wild plants were also available, including yams and wattle seeds. Nuts of the zamia palm, eaten during the &quot;Djeran&quot; season (April–May) required extensive treatment to remove their toxicity. While there has been some speculation that women may have used them as a form of contraception, there is no direct evidence to support this claim. As early as 10,000 BP local people utilised quartz, replacing chert flint for spear and knife edges when the chert deposits were submerged by sea level rise during the Flandrian transgression.

==History of contact==
Before the arrival of Europeans, the Noongar population has been variously estimated at between 6,000 and some tens of thousands. Colonisation by the British brought both violence and new diseases, taking a heavy toll on the population. The Noongar, like many other Aboriginal peoples, saw the arrival of Europeans as the returning of deceased people, often imagining them as relatives who deserved accommodation. As they approached from the west, the newcomers were called (or ), meaning &quot;white spirits&quot;.
Initially, relations were generally cordial. Matthew Flinders recognised the success of his three-week sojourn as due in good part to Noongar diplomacy, and Noongar rituals celebrated their reception of the newcomers in a ceremonial form. When settlement became more firmly established, however, misunderstandings over the obligations of reciprocity—some of the most productive land was being taken, especially on the Upper Swan—led to sporadic clashes. An example of such misunderstandings was the Noongar land-management practice of setting fires in early summer, mistakenly seen as an act of hostility by the settlers. Conversely, the Noongar saw the settlers&#x27; livestock as fair game to replace the dwindling stocks of native animals shot indiscriminately by settlers. The only area that successfully resisted the usurpation of native land for any time was the area around the Murray River, which effectively blocked expansion of the tiny settlement at Mandurah for almost half a decade.

In June 1832, a Whadjuk leader, Yagan, formerly of good standing among the settler authorities and known in the colony for his handsome bearing, &quot;tall, slender, well-fashioned..of pleasing countenance&quot;, was, together with his father Midgegooroo and brother Monday, declared an outlaw after undertaking a series of food raids and a retaliatory murder. Caught and imprisoned, he escaped and was let alone, as though informally reprieved as a native version of William Wallace. His father was caught and killed without trial by a military firing squad. Yagan himself, with a bounty on his head, was ambushed soon afterwards by an 18-year-old settler youth, after he had stopped two settlers and asked for flour. His corpse was decapitated, and the head was sent to England for display in fairgrounds. Yagan is now considered a Noongar hero, by many to have been one of the first indigenous resistance fighters. Matters escalated with conflicts between the settlement of Thomas Peel and the Pindjarup people, resulting in the Pinjarra massacre. Similarly, struggles with Ballardong people in the Avon Valley continued until violently suppressed by Lieutenant Henry William St Pierre Bunbury. Notwithstanding this violence, extraordinary acts of goodwill existed. In the same year, 1834, the Swan River Noongar couple, Migo and Molly Dobbin, alerted to the fact a European child had gone missing, covered in 10 hours tracking his spoors, and saved him, at the point of death.

From August 1838, ten Aboriginal prisoners were sent to Rottnest Island (, possibly meaning &quot;place across the water&quot;). After a short period when both settlers and prisoners occupied the island, the Colonial Secretary announced in June 1839 that the island would become a penal establishment for Aboriginal people and was officially designated as such in 1841. From that time until 1903, when the indigenous section was closed, Rottnest Island was used as a prison to transfer Aboriginal prisoners &quot;overseas&quot;. To &quot;pacify&quot; the Aboriginal population, men were rounded up and chained for offences ranging from spearing livestock, burning the bush, or digging vegetables on what had been their own land. It quickly became a &quot;place of torment, deprivation and death&quot;, and it has been estimated that there may be as many as 369 Aboriginal graves on the island, of which five were for prisoners who had been hanged. Except for a short period between 1849 and 1855, during which the prison was closed, some 3,700 Aboriginal men and boys, many of them Noongars, but also many others from all parts of the state, were imprisoned.

A notable incident for the Noongar people in the Western Australian Colony was the arrival of Rosendo Salvado in 1846. Salvado was an advocate for the humane treatment of the Australian Aboriginals at the mission he created at New Norcia, in the territory of the Yued. He provided refuge for the Njunga and he defended many on charges of theft, arguing from church doctrine that theft was not criminal if dictated by dire necessity. While intent on converting, he encouraged the Noongars to maintain their traditional culture.

From 1890 to 1958, the lives and lifestyles of Noongar people were subject to the Native Welfare Act.
By 1915, 15% of Perth&#x27;s Noongar had been thrust north and interned at the Moore River Native Settlement. Carrolup (later known as Marribank) became the home of up to one-third of the population. It is estimated that 10 to 25% of Noongar children were forcibly &quot;adopted&quot; during these years, in part of what has become known as the Stolen Generations.

==Culture==

Noongar people live in many country towns throughout the south-west as well as in the major population centres of Perth, Mandurah, Bunbury, Geraldton, Albany and Esperance. Many country Noongar people have developed long-standing relationships with non-Noongar farmers and continue to hunt kangaroo and gather bush tucker (food) as well as teach their children stories about the land. In a few areas in the south-west, visitors can go on bush tucker walks, trying foods such as kangaroo, emu, quandong jam or relish, bush tomatoes, witchetty grub pâté and bush honey.

The buka is a traditional cloak of the Noongar people made of kangaroo skin.

The kodj (&quot;to be hit on the head&quot;) or kodja&lt;ref name=&quot;au-archaeo-assoc/2014/10/Akerman&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is a Noongar hafted axe.&lt;ref name=&quot;museum.wa.gov.au/kodj-axe&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;abc.net.au/102397920&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;calendar-australia/weapon-aborigines&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Kojonup, Western Australia and &quot;The Kodja Place&quot; visitor centre,&lt;ref name=&quot;wa/kodja-place&quot;&gt;
*
&lt;/ref&gt; in Kojonup, are named after the kodj.

In Perth, the Noongar believe that the Darling Scarp is said to represent the body of a Wagyl, a snakelike Dreamtime creature that is a common deity in Noongar culture, that meandered over the land creating rivers, waterways, and lakes. It is thought that the Wagyl created the Swan River. The Wagyl has been associated with &quot;Wonambi naracoutensis&quot;, part of the extinct megafauna of Australia that disappeared between 15 and 50,000 years ago.

Also in Perth, Mount Eliza was an important site for the Noongar. It was a hunting site where kangaroos were herded and driven over the edge to provide meat for gathering clans. In this context, the &quot;clan&quot; is a local descent group – larger than a family but based on family links through common ancestry. At the base of Mount Eliza is a sacred site where the Wagyl is said to have rested during its journeys. This site is also the location of the former Swan Brewery which has been a source of contention between local Noongar groups (who would like to see the land, which was reclaimed from the river in the late 19th century, &quot;restored&quot; to them) and the title-holders who wished to develop the site. A Noongar protest camp existed here for several years in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Noongar culture is particularly strong with the written word. The plays of Jack Davis are on the school syllabus in several Australian states. Davis&#x27; first full-length play &quot;Kullark&quot;, a documentary on the history of Aboriginals in WA, was first produced in 1979. Other plays include: &quot;No Sugar, The Dreamers, Barungin: Smell the Wind, In Our Town&quot; and for younger audiences, &quot;Honey Spot&quot; and &quot;Moorli and the Leprechaun&quot;. Kim Scott won the 2000 Miles Franklin Award for his novel &quot;&quot; and the 2011 award for &quot;That Deadman Dance&quot;.

Yirra Yaakin
describes itself as the response to the Aboriginal community&#x27;s need for positive self-enhancement through artistic expression. It is a theatre company that strives for community development and which also has the drive to create &quot;exciting, authentic and culturally appropriate indigenous theatre&quot;.

Many local governments in the southwest have developed &quot;compacts&quot; or &quot;commitments&quot; with their local Noongar communities to ensure that sites of significance are protected and that the culture is respected. At the same time, the Western Australian Barnett government, also from November 2014, had been forcing the Aboriginal Cultural Material Committee to deregister 300 Aboriginal sacred sites in Western Australia. Although falling most heavily upon Pilbara and Kimberley sites this government policy also was having an impact on Noongar lands according to Ira Hayward-Jackson, Chairman of the Rottnest Island Deaths Group. The changes also removed rights of notification and appeal for traditional owners seeking to protect their heritage. A legal ruling on 1 April 2015 overturned the government&#x27;s actions on some of the sites deregistered which were found to be truly sacred.

Elders are increasingly asked on formal occasions to provide a &quot;Welcome to Country&quot;, and the first steps of teaching the Noongar language in the general curriculum have been made.

In recent years there has been considerable interest in Noongar visual arts. In 2006, Noongar culture was showcased as part of the Perth International Arts Festival. A highlight of the Festival was the unveiling of the monumental &quot;Ngallak Koort Boodja – Our Heart Land Canvas&quot;. The canvas was commissioned for the festival by representatives of the united elders and families from across the Noongar nation. It was painted by leading Noongar artists Shane Pickett, Tjyllyungoo, Yvonne Kickett, Alice Warrell and Sharyn Egan. 

October 2021 saw the opening of the first Noongar opera &quot;Koolbardi wer Wardong&quot;. Written by Gina Williams and Guy Ghouse, the opera was performed at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre by members of West Australian Opera, West Australian Young Voices, Noongar Children&#x27;s Choir and the Western Australian Youth Orchestra.

==Noongar ecology==
===Regions ===
The Noongar people occupied and maintained the Mediterranean climate lands of the south-west ecoregion of Western Australia, and made sustainable use of seven biogeographic regions of their territory, namely: 

* Geraldton Sandplains – Amangu and Yued
* Swan Coastal Plain – Yued, Whadjuk, Binjareb and Wardandi
* Avon Wheatbelt – Balardong, Nyakinyaki, Wilman
* Jarrah Forest – Whadjuk, Binjareb, Balardong, Wilman, Ganeang
* Warren – Bibbulmun/Bibulmun, Mineng
* Mallee – Wilmen, Goreng and Wudjari
* Esperance Plains – Njunga

These seven regions have been acknowledged as a biodiversity hot-spot, having a generally greater number of endemic species than most other regions in Australia. The ecological damage done to this region through clearing, introduced species, by feral animals and non-endemic plants is also severe, and has resulted in a high proportion of plants and animals being included in the categories of rare, threatened and endangered species. In modern times many Aboriginal men were employed intermittently as rabbiters, and rabbit became an important part of Noongar diet in the early 20th century. The Noongar territory also happens to conform closely with the south-west Indian Ocean Drainage Region, and the use of these water resources played a very important seasonal part in their culture. 

===Seasons ===
The Noongar thus have a close connection with the earth and, as a consequence, they divided the year into six distinct seasons that corresponded with moving to different habitats and feeding patterns based on seasonal foods. They are:

* &quot;Birak&quot; (December/January)Dry and hot. Noongar burned sections of scrubland to force animals into the open for easier hunting.
* &quot;Bunuru&quot; (February/March)Hottest part of the year, with sparse rainfall throughout.
* &quot;Djeran&quot; (April/May)Cooler weather begins. Fishing continued and bulbs and seeds were collected for food.
* &quot;Makuru&quot; (June/July)Cold fronts that have until now brushed the lower south-west coast begin to cross further north. This is usually the wettest part of the year.
* &quot;Djilba&quot; (August/September)Often the coldest part of the year, with clear, cold nights and days, or warmer, rainy and windy periods.
* &quot;Kambarang&quot; (October/November)A definite warming trend is accompanied by longer dry periods and fewer cold fronts crossing the coast. The height of the wildflower season.

==Native title==
On 19 September 2006 the Federal Court of Australia brought down a judgment which recognised native title in an area over the city of Perth and its surrounds, known as &quot;Bennell v State of Western Australia&quot; [2006] FCA 1243. An appeal was subsequently lodged and was heard in April 2007. The remainder of the larger &quot;Single Noongar Claim&quot; area, covering of the south-west of Western Australia, remains outstanding, and will hinge on the outcome of this appeal process. In the interim, the Noongar people together will continue to be involved in native title negotiations with the Government of Western Australia, and are represented by the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council.

Justice Wilcox&#x27;s judgment is noteworthy for several reasons. It highlights Perth&#x27;s wealth of post-European settlement writings which provide an insight into Aboriginal life, including laws and customs, around the time of settlement in 1829 and also into the beginning of the last century. These documents enabled Justice Wilcox to find that laws and customs governing land throughout the whole Single Noongar Claim (taking in Perth, and many other towns in the greater South West) were those of a single community. The claimants shared a language and had extensive interaction with others in the claim area.

Importantly, Justice Wilcox found the Noongar community constituted a united society which had continued to exist despite the disruption resulting from mixed marriage and people being forced off their land and dispersed to other areas as a result of white settlement and later Government policies.

In April 2008 the Full Bench of the Federal Court upheld parts of the appeal by the Western Australian and Commonwealth governments against Justice Wilcox&#x27;s judgment.

Other native title claims on Noongar lands include:
* Gnaala Karla Booja: the headwaters of the Murray and Harvey Rivers to the Indian Ocean
* The Harris Family: The coasts of the area from Busselton to Augusta
* The South West Boojarah: Lower course of the Blackwood and adjacent coastal areas
* Southern Noongar Wagyl Kaip: The South Coast to the Blackwood Tributaries
* The Ballardong Lands: The interior Wheatbelt.

==Economics==
Since the Noongar are largely urbanised or concentrated in major regional towns, studies have shown that the direct economic impact of the Noongar community on the WA economy was estimated to range between five and seven hundred million dollars per year. Exit polls of tourists leaving Western Australia have consistently shown that &quot;lack of contact with indigenous culture&quot; has been their greatest regret. It has been estimated that this results in the loss of many millions of dollars worth of foregone tourist revenue.

==Current issues==
As a consequence of the Stolen Generations and problems integrating with modern westernised society, many difficult issues face the present day Noongar. For example, the &quot;Noongar Men of the SouthWest&quot; gathering in 1996 identified major community problems associated with cultural dispossession such as:
* Alcohol and drugs (chemical dependencies, comorbidities or dual diagnoses, self medicating without medical supervision, solvent sniffing)
* Diet and nutrition
* Language and culture
* Domestic violence
* Father-and-son relationships

Many of these issues are not unique to the Noongar but in many cases they are unable to receive appropriate government-agency care. The report that was produced after this gathering also stated that Noongar men have a life expectancy of 20 years less than non-Aboriginal men, and go to hospital three times more often.

The Noongar still have large extended families and many families have difficulty accessing available structures of sheltered housing in Western Australia. The Western Australian government has dedicated several areas for the purpose of building communities specifically for the Noongar people, such as the (now closed) Swan Valley Noongar Community.

The Noongar themselves are tackling their own issues; for example, the Noongar Patrol, which is an Aboriginal Advancement Council initiative. It was set up to deter Aboriginal young people from offending behaviour and reduce the likelihood of their contact with the criminal justice system. The patrol uses mediation and negotiation with indigenous youth in an attempt to curb anti-social and offending behaviour of young people who come into the city at night.

<text>Myleene Angela Klass MBE (born 6 April 1978) is a British musician, singer, television presenter and model. She was a member of the pop group Hear&#x27;Say, and later released two solo classical crossover albums in 2003 and 2007. More recently, Klass has been a television and radio presenter. She has hosted television series including &quot;Popstar to Operastar&quot; (2010–2011) and &quot;BBQ Champ&quot; (2015) on ITV and &quot;The One Show&quot; (2007) on BBC One. She was a regular panellist on the ITV lunchtime chat show &quot;Loose Women&quot; in 2014 and again from 2024 onwards. In 2006, Klass was runner-up on the sixth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, and returned in 2023 for the &quot;all-stars&quot; series &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... South Africa&quot;, which she won.

==Early life==
Klass was born in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, to an Austrian father and a Filipino mother. She attended Notre Dame High School, Norwich, but transferred to the closer Cliff Park Ormiston Academy in the Gorleston-on-Sea area of Great Yarmouth, to complete her secondary education. Klass learned to play violin and piano as a child, and at the age of 15 she went to weekend studies at the Junior Department of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where she studied voice and harp. She gained A grades at A-Level, including music. She subsequently took a course at the Royal Academy of Music, University of London. At the age of 11, she won a school engineering contest, with a prize presented by Carol Vorderman.

After graduating, Klass spent a short period as part of a reality show for Bravo, called &quot;The Dolls&#x27; House&quot;. She sang backing vocals for Sir Cliff Richard, with whom she had previously worked at age 10 when she sang in a choir featured in his 1988 single &quot;Mistletoe and Wine&quot;, which was that year&#x27;s Christmas number one on the UK Singles Chart, and made her West End theatre debut in &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;.

==Music career==
Early television work came in 1998, when Klass sang soprano for the music of the Channel 4 film &quot;Alice through the Looking Glass&quot;.

===Hear&#x27;Say===

In 2001, Klass auditioned for the ITV reality show &quot;Popstars&quot;, which offered contestants an opportunity to become part of a newly formed pop band. Klass was chosen as one of the ten finalists and became a member of Hear&#x27;Say, with Kym Marsh, Suzanne Shaw, Danny Foster and Noel Sullivan. Following the success of their first album, the band was given its own TV show entitled &quot;Hear&#x27;Say It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;. During the show&#x27;s run, the band had a chance to perform with such established artists as Lionel Richie, Celine Dion, Bradley Walsh, Blue and Atomic Kitten. At the end of 2001, Hear&#x27;Say appeared on the Royal Variety Performance.

Subsequently, the group achieved a 37-date sold-out arena tour and performed numerous television guest appearances. Klass made many appearances with Hear&#x27;Say on TV and in live performances during 2002. The pop act&#x27;s many promotional appearances during the year were also broadcast as part of their own TV shows, entitled &quot;Hear&#x27;Say: A New Chapter in Full&quot; and &quot;The Hear&#x27;Say Story&quot;. In total, Hear&#x27;Say had four Top 10 singles including two number-ones in the British charts, before splitting up after a reported long-term feud between Klass and Marsh. The feud resulted in Marsh leaving the band in December 2001, to be replaced by Johnny Shentall in 2002. The band split up in October of that year.

===Solo artist===
On 13 May 2003, Klass signed a five-album deal with &quot;Classics and Jazz&quot;. Promotion started with the release of the main promotional single &quot;Toccata and Fugue&quot; to TV channels. She also appeared in the video for &quot;Da Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot; with The Girls of FHM, which went to No. 10 in the UK Singles Chart.

Klass&#x27;s album, &quot;Moving On&quot;, was launched on 20 October 2003 at Harrods, London. The album included reworked versions of popular classical pieces such as Fauré&#x27;s &quot;Pavane&quot;, Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; and Satie&#x27;s &quot;Gymnopedie No.2&quot;. &quot;Moving On&quot; also included music from the Oscar-winning films &quot;Gladiator&quot; and &quot;The Piano&quot;. New arrangements for piano of more contemporary works were also included on the album, namely Linkin Park&#x27;s &quot;Crawling&quot; and Daniel Bedingfield&#x27;s &quot;If You&#x27;re Not the One&quot;. In its first week of release. &quot;Moving On&quot; peaked at No. 2 in the UK Classical Chart, behind Hayley Westenra. It peaked at No. 32 in the UK Albums Chart. By mid-December 2003, the album had been certified gold. In April 2004, &quot;Moving On&quot; was nominated as &quot;Album of the Year&quot; at the Classical BRIT Awards, but lost to Bryn Terfel&#x27;s platinum-selling record &quot;Bryn&quot;.

Klass confirmed there would be a re-release of the album with five new tracks, but its release was pushed back. Ultimately, the release was cancelled, the only remnant being the Asian release of &quot;Moving On&quot;, which includes three new tracks: &quot;Trouble&quot; (a Coldplay cover version with Klass&#x27;s vocals), &quot;Sahara&quot; and &quot;Le Onde&quot;.

On 28 March 2007, Klass signed a record contract with EMI Classics as both a recording artist and an ambassador for the EMI Classics UK roster of artists. These include Alfie Boe, Natasha Marsh and Natalie Clein. The deal included the release of a series of albums on which Klass performed two exclusive tracks and chose a number of her favourite classical pieces from the EMI Classics back catalogue.

Klass&#x27;s second album in the EMI series, &quot;Myleene&#x27;s Music for Mothers&quot;, was released on 18 February 2008, and has two tracks played by Klass. These two tracks are the popular &quot;America&quot; from &quot;West Side Story&quot;, written by Leonard Bernstein, and Ennio Morricone&#x27;s &quot;Chi Mai&quot;, known best as the theme to the 1981 BBC TV drama serial &quot;The Life and Times of Lloyd George&quot;. In March 2013, she helped to celebrate Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s 40-year work with her rendition of &quot;Shakalaka- Baby&quot; from the musical &quot;Bombay Dreams&quot;.

==Television career==
===Presenting===
In August 2005, Klass was signed as a presenter for the ITV music show &quot;&quot; with Lauren Laverne and Johny P, with her first appearance shown on 17 September 2005. In 2005, Klass appeared as a guest panellist on the topical discussion show &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot; on a number of occasions. At Christmas 2005, Klass appeared on a celebrity version of the BBC&#x27;s quiz show &quot;Mastermind&quot;.

On 6 August 2006, Klass was a guest reporter on BBC One&#x27;s Sunday morning religion and ethics show, &quot;Heaven &amp; Earth, with Gloria Hunniford&quot;. Klass&#x27;s report, billed as the feature of the week, was on the Pope&#x27;s astronomer. From 10 October 2006, Klass co-presented Living&#x27;s &quot;Ghost Towns&quot; with the medium and ex-&quot;Most Haunted&quot; star Derek Acorah. In May 2007, Klass appeared on Sky HD&#x27;s Test Card.

From July to August 2007, Klass co-presented the daily BBC One programme &quot;The One Show&quot; with Adrian Chiles, before leaving to concentrate on looking after her baby. On 31 December 2007, Klass presented the BBC One programme, &quot;New Year Live&quot;, for the countdown to the year 2008 at midnight.

Klass was announced as the new presenter of the Channel 4 series &quot;10 Years Younger&quot;, on November 5, 2008, and first hosted on February 5 of the following year. The programme was broadcast every Thursday evening, from 9.00 pm to 10.00 pm. Klass replaced Nicky Hambleton-Jones as presenter. She also co-hosted the American version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me out of Here!&quot; in 2009 on NBC.

On 31 July 2015, Klass began presenting the new ITV series &quot;BBQ Champ&quot;.

===Reality television===
Klass took part in the sixth series of ITV&#x27;s reality television series &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, which began on 13 November 2006 and ended on 1 December 2006. She finished in second place, behind Matt Willis. Klass&#x27;s brother Don, noticing his sister&#x27;s popularity with the male audience, suggested she auction off her bikinis from the show on eBay. Within a week of leaving the jungle, Klass took his advice and put her white bikini from the show on auction on eBay until 7 December 2006. Klass pledged that all the money raised from the auction would go to charity to help victims of the Farepak savings scandal. The auction raised £7,500.

Klass&#x27;s newly found sex symbol status was cemented further after &quot;Playboy&quot; offered her a six-figure deal to pose nude for the magazine. The offer was sent to Klass&#x27;s agent while she was still on the show, with many offers from other magazines, chat shows and TV work. The demand for Klass increased so much that it is estimated she received offers amounting to several million pounds.

Returning to the UK, Klass did several TV and press interviews about her time on the show. Commenting on her famous showers, she said she never expected it to be such a focus of attention and that the reason for her frequent cold showers was to help cope with her sexual frustration, saying, &quot;Forget snakes and spiders – going without sex was the hardest thing.&quot; She revealed that so great was her frustration and sexual urges after nearly three weeks without sex, that on her release from the jungle, she spent the first hours having unprotected sex with her boyfriend which resulted in her pregnancy with her first child. She also tried to end the widespread debate about whether or not her breasts are real, saying, &quot;They&#x27;re absolutely real and natural, I can assure you.&quot; About her new offers, she said she had been approached by several companies about doing bikini ranges with them.

After only one week on &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...&quot;, Klass became the most searched for celebrity from the show on the Internet search engine MSN/Live Search and the third most searched for celebrity in the UK.

On 20 September 2020, it was announced that Klass would be a contestant on the thirteenth series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;. She was paired with Łukasz Różycki. She became the first celebrity to be eliminated following a skate-off against Lady Leshurr and Brendyn Hatfield.

On 26 March 2023, it was announced that she would appear in &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... South Africa&quot;. During the final episode aired on 12 May, Klass beat runner-up Jordan Banjo and was crowned the first &quot;&quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity&quot; Legend&quot;.

On 13 October 2023, Klass appeared as a guest panellist on the ITV talk show Loose Women before returning once again as a regular panellist from 19 January 2024.

=== Political intervention ===
In November 2014, Klass caused controversy by engaging in a heated debate with then-leader of the Labour Party, Ed Miliband, on the ITV show &quot;The Agenda&quot;. Discussing his proposals for a so-called &quot;mansion tax&quot; on larger homes, Klass expressed the view that this would hit &quot;little grannies&quot;. In the course of discussion, she pointed to a glass of water, saying, &quot;You can&#x27;t just point at things and tax them.&quot; The row later featured in an attack on Miliband by the prime minister, David Cameron, at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions.

==Radio==
In February 2006, Klass began presenting the &quot;Sunday Breakfast&quot; programme on Classic FM, taking over from Aled Jones (who returned to this slot in 2016). She worked for several years on the station&#x27;s early morning show on Saturdays and Sundays and since 2006 presents the Saturday and Sunday evening &quot;Smooth Classics&quot; programme (10pm1am). While working on the weekend morning show for Classic FM, she was also heard on London&#x27;s Capital Radio on Sunday evenings from 8 to 10 pm. This show was also broadcast on GCap Media&#x27;s One Network local commercial radio stations around the UK.

On 27 May 2008, Klass presented the BBC Radio 2 show &quot;Friday Night is Music Night&quot; in front of a live audience at the Watford Colosseum in Watford, Hertfordshire. The recording of this show was broadcast on 18 July 2008. Klass presented various shows on TalkRADIO, filling in for James Whale and Jon Gaunt.

Klass began presenting a Saturday drive-time show on Smooth Radio in 2014. Klass presented the weekday 10 am – 1 pm show covering for Kate Garraway while she was looking after her husband who had Coronavirus. Garraway returned to the mid-morning show on 14 September and Klass returned to her usual Saturday drive-time show.

==Modelling==
She appeared in a shoot for &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine in February 2006. Klass was chosen as the new face of Ortak Jewellery. In January 2007, it was announced that Klass had signed a multimillion-pound deal with Marks &amp; Spencer to model clothes and swimwear for the new season. From 2012, Klass modelled for the catalogue store Littlewoods.

==Miscellaneous work==
In early 2006, Klass was cast as one of the three women starring in the long-running play &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; and performed in Bromley, Richmond and Brighton. Her run was then extended to include all dates in Nottingham. Olympic champions joined Klass on 13 December 2006 to launch &quot;Lucky Dog&quot;, a new London 2012 National Lottery scratchcard. In 2008, Klass began designing a range of baby clothes for Mothercare called Baby K. Klass also writes a regular blog for the pregnancy and parenting website &quot;Gurgle&quot;, which is owned by Mothercare. Klass is the official godmother of the cruise ship &quot;Carnival Splendor&quot;. Klass is an EDF Energy / Team Green Britain Ambassador and took part in the launch of the EDF London Eye on 27 January 2011. In 2011, Klass began working with the children&#x27;s shoe brand Start-rite, helping the company to design and promote a range of fitted footwear.

==Personal life==
Klass has been an amateur astronomer for most of her life, having been taught the basics by her father. She was one of a handful of celebrities, engineers and scientists who were at the UK National Space Centre control centre for the touchdown of the UK Mars probe Beagle 2 in the early morning of Christmas Day 2003. Since then, she has been a keen supporter of the UK&#x27;s work in the European space programme. In March 2006, Klass publicly criticised the proposed closure of the London Planetarium and explained on television how to view Venus in the early morning. She also appeared on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot; to discuss the book &quot;Moondust&quot;, which follows the lives of the first men on the moon, and in 2007 attended the televised party on BBC One, held at the home of Patrick Moore in Selsey to mark the 50th anniversary of Moore&#x27;s monthly programme, &quot;The Sky at Night&quot;. Klass once studied astronomy with the Open University.

In December 2005, Klass was attacked by a group of teenagers in a newsagent in Bermondsey. She had a bag of chips dropped on her head and was pushed to the ground. The teenagers attempted to take photos of Klass on their mobile phones.

In May 2006, Klass was involved in a go-karting crash at a charity race in Cardiff, South Wales, sustaining an injury to her leg.

On 1 April 2007, she announced she was expecting her first child on 7 September. As a result, she delayed her wedding to Graham Quinn until 2008. Their daughter Ava was born on 16 August 2007. Klass&#x27;s spokesman said, &quot;Myleene presented &quot;The One Show&quot; and felt a bit weird on the way home. She went to the hospital to get checked out and they told her she was in labour.&quot; Klass published a book about her experiences of being pregnant, entitled &quot;My Bump and Me: From Morning Sickness to Motherhood – An Honest Diary of My Pregnancy&quot;. She gave birth to a second daughter on 25 March 2011, called Hero.

In May 2009, Klass had an accumulated wealth of £7.5 million.

In January 2010, Klass claimed she received a warning from Hertfordshire Police for brandishing a kitchen knife (through a window) at a group of teenagers who entered her garden while she and her daughter were alone in the house. She said that she was &quot;utterly terrified&quot; and &quot;aghast&quot; at the response by the police. Hertfordshire Police denied making any such warning and stated that the law allows householders the proportionate use of force to protect themselves. It has subsequently been reported that it was Klass&#x27;s agent or publicist who notified the police of the incident and who then passed on the story to &quot;The Sun&quot;.

On 21 October 2011, Klass and Quinn married, with sixteen people in attendance. On 23 April 2013, she was granted a divorce from Quinn.

On 1 August 2019, she gave birth to her third child, a boy named Apollo. This was Klass&#x27;s first child with her partner Simon Motson, who also has two children from a previous relationship. On 13 September 2020, Klass announced that she had become engaged to Motson.

==Charity work==
As part of World Vision&#x27;s 24-hour famine appeal, Klass visited Sierra Leone to see how World Vision was working to help villagers build up their lives. She has also been the face of various charity campaigns such as stop text bully and ChildLine, and helped aid the Niger famine appeal by manning the telephone lines.

At the Cathedral Church of St John the Baptist, Norwich on 24 June 2005, Klass performed a selection of tracks from her &quot;Moving On&quot; album, as well as accompanying some local schoolchildren in a concert of classical standards. The cathedral summer concert was organised to raise funds for an extension of the church building. Part of this performance was recorded by MTV, which was following Klass at the time for a show called &quot;The Price of Fame&quot;. The programme was later broadcast by VH1 and also by ITV, where it was only shown in the London region. The recording by the music channel was acknowledged by Klass during the evening.

On 15 July 2006, as part of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Sport Relief&quot; charity spectacular, Klass appeared as a special guest in the &quot;Question of Sport Relief&quot; segment. Klass&#x27;s appearance involved her playing a variety of TV sport theme tunes on a grand piano. This part of the fundraiser was based on the BBC&#x27;s popular &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; quiz show and was hosted by Sue Barker. Guest panellists on the show included Nancy Dell&#x27;Olio and Zara Phillips, who played alongside the regular team captains Ally McCoist and Matt Dawson.

During December 2006, Klass also appeared on &quot;The Big Finish with Graham Norton&quot;, in which she competed alongside Bill Oddie and &quot;Big Brother&quot; star Nikki Grahame for the &quot;Showbiz&quot; team (against &quot;Soap&quot;, &quot;Sport&quot;, &quot;News&quot; and &quot;Judges&quot; teams) to compete to win £10,000 for the winning team&#x27;s chosen charities. The Showbiz team, represented by Graham in the final round, was beaten by the Soap team represented by the former &quot;EastEnders&quot; actress Wendy Richard. In November 2007, Klass guest-presented BBC Children in Need and performed &quot;Your Song&quot; with John Barrowman. She also collaborates with Norwood, a Jewish charity for children.

In July 2022, Klass received an honorary degree from the University of East Anglia.

In 2023, she backed changes to the Women&#x27;s Health Strategy for women who have experienced miscarriage with MP Olivia Blake.

Klass is an ambassador for the National Foundation for Youth Music, a children&#x27;s music charity.

Klass was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2025 New Year Honours for her work on women&#x27;s health, in particular in raising awareness of miscarriage.

<doc id="345502" wikidata="Q5764494" url="?curid=345502" title="Hilton Baltimore">
<text>The Hilton Baltimore, also known as &quot;Hilton Baltimore Inner Harbor&quot;, is a 757–room hotel located on West Pratt Street in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. Initially proposed in 2003, actual construction of the city-owned venture took place between 2006 and 2008 as part of the Baltimore Convention Center. A month before the hotel&#x27;s scheduled opening in August 2008, Baltimore Mayor Sheila Dixon said that an 18% increase in room night bookings through 2017, as of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008, compared to the previous year&#x27;s, confirmed the city&#x27;s decision to move forward with the hotel development project as a means of bolstering Baltimore&#x27;s convention business. The massive hotel has been criticized for blocking the once-celebrated views of Baltimore&#x27;s skyline from the Oriole Park at Camden Yards grandstand, however. The hotel has underperformed projections, losing money in its first three years of operation.

On September 2, 2024, The Hilton Baltimore was the site of the first hotel worker strike in 54 years. Members of the Unite Here Local 7 went on a one-day Labor Day strike for better pay and better working conditions. A new four year labor contract calling for significant wage increases and increased funding for the pension and health care plans of Hilton Baltimore employees would later be ratified on October 22, 2024. Collective bargaining for a new contract would then end on October 27, 2024 when Hilton Baltimore employees would again approve the now ratified contract. Despite baring the Hilton name, the Hilton Baltimore remains owned by the city of Baltimore. It has also been reported that in spite of the October 2024 labor contract, issues plaguing the Hilton Baltimore would remain ongoing.

The &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; reported on April 10, 2003, that three proposals were submitted to the Baltimore Development Corporation:

* A 755-room Westin hotel with 600 parking spaces and 54,457 sq ft (5,000 sq meters) of meeting and ballroom space. The proposal was submitted by Garfield Traub Development LLC, a Dallas-based real estate developer that has built convention hotels, and Baltimore-based development firm Otis Warren &amp; Co.

The group also proposed developing the hotel along with a new 19,000-seat arena, offices and the headquarters for Catholic Relief Services, which has asked the city to use the parcel for its new offices.

The proposal would be paid for with tax-exempt bonds that require public ownership of the hotel.

* An 869-room hotel with 592 parking spaces, 55,000 sq ft (5,100 sq meters) of meeting and ballroom space, a 36,000 square foot (3,300 m²) soundstage and recording studio, as well as a wellness clinic and spa.

The plan was presented by Atlanta-based Portman Holdings LP, one of the nation&#x27;s largest developers of convention hotels. The team also includes Treyball Development Inc., a company based in Beverly Hills, Calif., that is owned by the actor Will Smith and his brother, Harry. No brand name was included in the proposal.

The project would be paid for with private financing, tax-increment financing, which dedicates future tax receipts to the development, or through sale of tax-exempt bonds, depending on the city&#x27;s preference.

* The Hilton proposal by Johnson&#x27;s firm, the Bethesda-based RLJ Development LLC, and Quadrangle. The developers also would build the 200,000 square foot (19,000 m²) headquarters for Catholic Relief Services on the grounds. No financing method was identified.

The RLJ proposal also included 1,000 parking spaces and 75,000 sq ft (7,000 sq meters) of meeting and ballroom space. A second phase would add 400 hotel rooms and a 200,000 sq ft (19,000 m2) hotel-office-residential building.

On October 24, 2003, the Baltimore Development Corporation chose the 750-room Hilton Hotel RLJ proposal, announcing that the hotel will have 1,000 underground parking spaces and will have a 20,000 sq ft (2,000 sq meters) grand ballroom and nearly 62,000 sq ft (6,000 sq meters) of meeting space that can be utilized by the Baltimore Convention Center. The hotel is going to be about 24 stories high and cost approximately $200 million to build and will have shops and restaurants that will be designed to function with Oriole Park at Camden Yards during the Baltimore Orioles&#x27; home games. The hotel will be built on two vacant blocks that are north of Oriole Park at Camden Yards and west of the Baltimore Convention Center where currently a parking lot is located and the hotel will have an all-weather walkway connected to the Baltimore Convention Center.

Critics at the time questioned whether the property would be better suited for possible future expansion of the Baltimore Convention Center. Also debated was whether 750 rooms is sufficient to help attract more business to the Baltimore Convention Center.

On November 13, the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; said that Mayor Martin O&#x27; Malley approved the 750-room Hilton Hotel RLJ proposal, granting RLJ Development a six-month exclusive negotiating priority to build the $200 million hotel, subject to negotiation of financing and room blocking for convention business. The city was reported to be desirous of minimizing the project&#x27;s financial impact on Baltimore taxpayers. The Baltimore Area Convention and Visitors Association (BACVA) was said to want 60% of the 750 rooms would be available to BACVA at any given time. The proposal offered 600 rooms available to BACVA, with a final decision to be made between the Hilton and the city when the hotel nears opening. O&#x27;Malley projected the hotel to bring in $4.4 million yearly with taxes and other revenue and provide 461 jobs by the fourth year of operation.

On November 24, the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; said that development officials of Baltimore City will be requesting an estimated $290 million for the hotel project, making it one of Baltimore City&#x27;s most costliest public works project in its history, and that City of Baltimore will also set up a non-profit organization to develop, own, and operate the hotel.

===2005===
Legislation was introduced in the Baltimore City Council for insurance of $305 million in city revenue bonds for the project. On May 6, 2005, the Baltimore Planning Commission unanimously approved bills to create a property tax district for the hotel project, along with authorization of the revenue bond sales for the hotel project, and approval of street closures for the hotel&#x27;s construction. The &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; said that the hotel will be connected to the Baltimore Convention Center via a second-story skywalk and that the Baltimore Area Convention &amp; Visitors Association&#x27;s statistics showed that the lack of a convention center hotel caused Baltimore to lose approximately 120,000 room bookings, approximating $100 million in lost revenue, in the past three years.

On June 23, the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; reported that the hotel project was met with skepticism by the Baltimore City Council, with many Council members questioning the need for the hotel project and the necessity for it to be publicly financed. On July 11, the Baltimore City Council delayed a vote on the hotel project because only three out of the fifteen city council members supported the project, eight members were either opposing it or leaning towards opposing it, and three were undecided. The &quot;Sun&quot; said the two major objections voiced by city council members is that development officials had not tried hard enough to find a private developer and whether Baltimore needed a convention center hotel. The Baltimore Development Corporation and Baltimore Mayor Martin J. O&#x27;Malley said the city needed the 752 room Hilton to remain competitive in the convention industry and that the Baltimore Development Corporation could not secure a private investor on terms more favorable than the proposal for the publicly financed project submitted to the city council for approval. Some on the city council said that public financing would enable Baltimore to share in the profits that the hotel would generate and if it was privately funded, the city would not receive anything.

The City Council also considered amendments regarding minimum wages for hotel workers and also subject the hotel&#x27;s board to Maryland&#x27;s &quot;open meetings&quot; law.

On August 15 the Baltimore City Council approved the Convention Center Hotel bill by a 9 to 6 vote, supported by then-City Council President Sheila Dixon, Vice President Stephanie C. Rawlings Blake, Paula Johnson Branch, Robert W. Curran, Kenneth N. Harris Sr., Helen L. Holton, Edward L. Reisinger, Rochelle &quot;Rikki&quot; Spector and Agnes Welch. Opponents of the measure were Mary Pat Clarke, Belinda Conaway, Nicholas C. D&#x27;Adamo Jr., James B. Kraft, Keiffer J. Mitchell, Jr. and Bernard C. &quot;Jack&quot; Young. A second, largely formal 9-5 final vote approving the hotel project occurred on September 19.

===2006===
Ground was broken for the hotel&#x27;s construction on February 17, 2006. The targeted completion date was June 30, 2008.

===2008===
With substantial completion of construction in 2008, there were complaints that views of the city&#x27;s skyline are now blocked from most sections of Oriole Park at Camden Yard&#x27;s grandstand. The &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; said on April 21, 2008, &quot;There&#x27;s just a glimpse of the Bromo Seltzer Tower&#x27;s crenellated top just to the right of the new Hilton Baltimore Convention Center hotel ... something&#x27;s drastically different at Oriole Park this year ... the sweeping view of downtown Baltimore that fans have enjoyed for the past 16 seasons has changed considerably...&quot; Sportswriter Peter Schmuck complained, &quot;the big, antiseptic convention hotel ... looms over Camden Yards ... [and] has blocked out the best part of the Baltimore skyline&quot;. A &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist called it a &quot;cruel cubist joke on a previously perfect ballpark&quot;, although others said they were pleased with new construction downtown as indicative of urban revitalization.

Baltimore Mayor Sheila Dixon said at a July 18 news conference that an 18% increase in room night bookings in Baltimore&#x27;s hotels through 2017, as of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008, compared to the previous year&#x27;s, confirmed the city&#x27;s decision to move forward with the hotel development project as a means of bolstering Baltimore&#x27;s convention business.

===2010===

The hotel lost money for the third consecutive year.

===2011===

Due to continued difficulty in attracting conventions to Baltimore, the Greater Baltimore Committee proposed spending approximately $450 million more for a convention center expansion.

<doc id="345505" wikidata="Q200239" url="?curid=345505" title="Lake Biwa">
<text>is the largest freshwater lake in Japan. It is located entirely within Shiga Prefecture (west-central Honshu), northeast of the former capital city of Kyoto. Lake Biwa is an ancient lake, over 4 million years old. It is estimated to be the 13th oldest lake in the world. Because of its proximity to the country&#x27;s historical capital Kyoto, references to Lake Biwa appear frequently in Japanese literature, particularly in poetry and in historical accounts of battles.

==Name==
The name &quot;Biwako&quot; was established in the Edo period. There are various theories about the origin of the name &quot;Biwako&quot;, but it is generally believed to be so named because of the resemblance of its shape to that of a stringed instrument called the &quot;biwa&quot;. Kōsō, a learned monk of Enryaku-ji in the 14th century, gave a clue to the origin of the name &quot;Biwako&quot; in his writing: &quot;The lake is the Pure land of the goddess Benzaiten because she lives on Chikubu Island and the shape of the lake is similar to that of the &quot;biwa&quot;, her favorite instrument.&quot;

The lake was formerly known as the or the . Later the pronunciation &quot;Awaumi&quot; changed to the modern &quot;Ōmi&quot; as in the name of Ōmi Province. The lake is also called in literature.

==Area and use==
The area of this lake is about . Small rivers drain from the surrounding mountains into Lake Biwa, and its main outlet is the Seta River, which later becomes the Uji River, combining with the Katsura and Kizu to become the Yodo River and flows into the Seto Inland Sea at Osaka Bay.

It serves as a reservoir for the cities of Kyoto and Ōtsu and is a valuable resource for nearby textile industries. It provides drinking water for about 15 million people in the Kansai region. Lake Biwa is a breeding ground for freshwater fish, including trout, and for the pearl culture industry.

The Lake Biwa Canal, built in the late 1890s and later expanded during the Taishō period, played a role of great importance in the rekindling of Kyoto&#x27;s industrial life, after a steep decline following the transfer of the capital to Tokyo.

Lake Biwa is home to many popular beaches along the north-western shore, in particular Shiga Beach and Omi-Maiko. The Mizunomori Water Botanical Garden and the Lake Biwa Museum in Kusatsu are also of interest.

The Lake Biwa Marathon took place annually in Ōtsu, the city at the southern end of the lake, from 1962 until 2021.

==Natural history==
Lake Biwa is of tectonic origin and is one of the world&#x27;s oldest lakes, dating to at least 4 million years ago. This long uninterrupted age has allowed for a notably diverse ecosystem to evolve in the lake. Naturalists have documented more than 1000 species and subspecies in the lake, including about 60 endemics. Lake Biwa is an important place for water birds. About 5,000 water birds visit Lake Biwa every year.

There are 46 native fish species and subspecies in the lake, including 11 species and 5 subspecies that are endemic or near-endemic. The endemic species are five cyprinids (&quot;Carassius cuvieri&quot;, &quot;Gnathopogon caerulescens&quot;, &quot;Ischikauia steenackeri&quot;, &quot;Opsariichthys uncirostris&quot; and &quot;Sarcocheilichthys biwaensis&quot;), a true loach (&quot;Cobitis magnostriata&quot;), two gobies (&quot;Gymnogobius isaza&quot; and &quot;Rhinogobius biwaensis&quot;), two silurid catfish (&quot;Silurus biwaensis&quot; and &quot;S. lithophilus&quot;) and a cottid (&quot;Cottus reinii&quot;). The Biwa trout is also endemic to the lake, but some maintain that it is a subspecies of the widespread masu salmon rather than a separate species. The remaining endemic fish are subspecies of &quot;Carassius auratus&quot;, &quot;Cobitis minamorii&quot;, &quot;Sarcocheilichthys variegatus&quot; and &quot;Squalidus (chankaensis) biwae&quot;.

Lake Biwa is also the home of a large number of molluscs, including 38 freshwater snails (19 endemic) and 16 bivalves (9 endemic).

Recently the biodiversity of the lake has suffered greatly due to the invasion of foreign fish, the black bass and the bluegill. Bluegill were presented to the Emperor and later freed in the lake as a food source for other fish. Black bass were introduced as a sport fish. In July 2009, a largemouth bass weighing was caught from the lake by Manabu Kurita. It has been officially certified by the International Game Fish Association (IGFA) to tie the largemouth bass world record held solely by George Perry for 77 years.

==Archaeology==
The Awazu site, a submerged Shell midden, is an important archaeological site of the Jōmon period. It goes back to the beginning of the Initial Jōmon period (ca. 9300 BP). It lies near the southern end of Lake Biwa, close to Otsu City, at a depth of 2 to 3 meters from the bottom.

The site shows the use of plant and animal food resources by the Jōmon people. It also demonstrates the importance of nut consumption in this period.

Shell Midden No. 3 is dated to the Middle Jōmon period. An abundance of horse chestnuts were uncovered here (about 40% of their total estimated diet). This indicates that, by this later period, a sophisticated processing technology was mastered in order to remove the harmful tannic acid, and make this food safe for consumption.

Ishiyama is another such site of the Early Jōmon period on Lake Biwa.

==Environmental legislation==
Various environmental laws cover Lake Biwa:

===Eutrophication prevention===
At the prefectural level, Eutrophication Control Ordinance was enacted in 1979. It was intended to control the use of synthetic detergents by companies and residents alike and followed a successful citizens&#x27; campaign known as the Soap Movement, which had emerged from women&#x27;s consumer groups earlier in the 1970s.

Legislation to prevent eutrophication was enacted in 1981 and first enforced on July 1, 1982; therefore, this day is called &quot;&quot;. The legislation established standards for the nitrogen and phosphorus levels for agricultural, industrial, and household water sources emptying into the lake. They also banned people from using and selling synthetic detergents which contain phosphorus.

===Wetlands protection===
The lake was designated as a UNESCO Ramsar Wetland (1993) in accordance with the Ramsar Convention. The object of this treaty is to protect and sensibly use internationally valuable wetlands. The Kushiro marsh (釧路湿原, Kushiro Shitsugen) in Japan is under this treaty now.

===Conservation of Reed Vegetation Zones===
Reed colonies on the shore give Lake Biwa its characteristic scenery. The reeds play an important role in purifying water as well as providing habitat for birds and fish. At one time there were large areas of reeds along the shores of Lake Biwa, which local government surveys recently found to have halved in size due to encroaching development. This Shiga Ordinance for the Conservation of Reed Vegetation Zones to protect, grow, and utilize the reed beds has been in force since 1992.

<text>In the area of modern algebra known as group theory, the Conway groups are the three sporadic simple groups Co1, Co2 and Co3 along with the related finite group Co0 introduced by .

The largest of the Conway groups, Co0, is the group of automorphisms of the Leech lattice Λ with respect to addition and inner product. It has order

but it is not a simple group. The simple group [[Conway group Co1|Co1]] of order

: =  221395472111323

is defined as the quotient of Co0 by its center, which consists of the scalar matrices ±1. The groups [[Conway group Co2|Co2]] of order

: =  218365371123

and [[Conway group Co3|Co3]] of order

: =  210375371123
consist of the automorphisms of Λ fixing a lattice vector of type 2 and type 3, respectively. As the scalar −1 fixes no non-zero vector, these two groups are isomorphic to subgroups of Co1.

The inner product on the Leech lattice is defined as 1/8 the sum of the products of respective co-ordinates of the two multiplicand vectors; it is an integer. The square norm of a vector is its inner product with itself, always an even integer. It is common to speak of the type of a Leech lattice vector: half the square norm. Subgroups are often named in reference to the &quot;types&quot; of relevant fixed points. This lattice has no vectors of type 1.

==History==

 relates how, in about 1964, John Leech investigated close packings of spheres in Euclidean spaces of large dimension. One of Leech&#x27;s discoveries was a lattice packing in 24-space, based on what came to be called the Leech lattice Λ. He wondered whether his lattice&#x27;s symmetry group contained an interesting simple group, but felt he needed the help of someone better acquainted with group theory. He had to do much asking around because the mathematicians were pre-occupied with agendas of their own. John Conway agreed to look at the problem. John G. Thompson said he would be interested if he were given the order of the group. Conway expected to spend months or years on the problem, but found results in just a few sessions.

 stated that he found the Leech lattice in 1940 and hinted that he calculated the order of its automorphism group Co0.

==Monomial subgroup N of Co0==
Conway started his investigation of Co0 with a subgroup he called N, a holomorph of the (extended) binary Golay code (as diagonal matrices with 1 or −1 as diagonal elements) by the Mathieu group M24 (as permutation matrices). .

A standard representation, used throughout this article, of the binary Golay code arranges the 24 co-ordinates so that 6 consecutive blocks (tetrads) of 4 constitute a sextet.

The matrices of Co0 are orthogonal; i. e., they leave the inner product invariant. The inverse is the transpose. Co0 has no matrices of determinant −1.

The Leech lattice can easily be defined as the Z-module generated by the set Λ2 of all vectors of type 2, consisting of
: (4, 4, 022)
: (28, 016)
: (−3, 123)

and their images under N. Λ2 under N falls into 3 orbits of sizes 1104, 97152, and 98304. Then . Conway strongly suspected that Co0 was transitive on Λ2, and indeed he found a new matrix, not monomial and not an integer matrix.

Let &quot;η&quot; be the 4-by-4 matrix
:formula_1

Now let ζ be a block sum of 6 matrices: odd numbers each of &quot;η&quot; and −&quot;η&quot;. &quot;ζ&quot; is a symmetric and orthogonal matrix, thus an involution. Some experimenting shows that it interchanges vectors between different orbits of N.

To compute |Co0| it is best to consider Λ4, the set of vectors of type 4. Any type 4 vector is one of exactly 48 type 4 vectors congruent to each other modulo 2Λ, falling into 24 orthogonal pairs A set of 48 such vectors is called a frame or cross. N has as an orbit a standard frame of 48 vectors of form (±8, 023). The subgroup fixing a given frame is a conjugate of N. The group 212, isomorphic to the Golay code, acts as sign changes on vectors of the frame, while M24 permutes the 24 pairs of the frame. Co0 can be shown to be transitive on Λ4. Conway multiplied the order 212|M24| of N by the number of frames, the latter being equal to the quotient . That product is the order of &quot;any&quot; subgroup of Co0 that properly contains N; hence N is a maximal subgroup of Co0 and contains 2-Sylow subgroups of Co0. N also is the subgroup in Co0 of all matrices with integer components.

Since Λ includes vectors of the shape , Co0 consists of rational matrices whose denominators are all divisors of 8.

The smallest non-trivial representation of Co0 over any field is the 24-dimensional one coming from the Leech lattice, and this is faithful over fields of characteristic other than 2.

==Involutions in Co0==
Any involution in Co0 can be shown to be conjugate to an element of the Golay code. Co0 has 4 conjugacy classes of involutions.

A permutation matrix of shape 212 can be shown to be conjugate to a dodecad. Its centralizer has the form 212:M12 and has conjugates inside the monomial subgroup. Any matrix in this conjugacy class has trace 0.

A permutation matrix of shape 2818 can be shown to be conjugate to an octad; it has trace 8. This and its negative (trace −8) have a common centralizer of the form , a subgroup maximal in Co0.

==Sublattice groups==
Conway and Thompson found that four recently discovered sporadic simple groups, described in conference proceedings , were isomorphic to subgroups or quotients of subgroups of Co0.

Conway himself employed a notation for stabilizers of points and subspaces where he prefixed a dot. Exceptional were .0 and .1, being Co0 and Co1. For integer let .n denote the stabilizer of a point of type n (see above) in the Leech lattice.

Conway then named stabilizers of planes defined by triangles having the origin as a vertex. Let .hkl be the pointwise stabilizer of a triangle with edges (differences of vertices) of types h, k and l. The triangle is commonly called an h-k-l triangle. In the simplest cases Co0 is transitive on the points or triangles in question and stabilizer groups are defined up to conjugacy.

Conway identified .322 with the McLaughlin group McL (order ) and .332 with the Higman–Sims group HS (order ); both of these had recently been discovered.

Here is a table of some sublattice groups:

==Two other sporadic groups==
Two sporadic subgroups can be defined as quotients of stabilizers of structures on the Leech lattice. Identifying R24 with C12 and Λ with

: formula_2

the resulting automorphism group (i.e., the group of Leech lattice automorphisms preserving the complex structure) when divided by the six-element group of complex scalar matrices, gives the Suzuki group Suz (order ). This group was discovered by Michio Suzuki in 1968.

A similar construction gives the Hall–Janko group J2 (order ) as the quotient of the group of quaternionic automorphisms of Λ by the group ±1 of scalars.

The seven simple groups described above comprise what Robert Griess calls the &quot;second generation of the Happy Family&quot;, which consists of the 20 sporadic simple groups found within the Monster group. Several of the seven groups contain at least some of the five Mathieu groups, which comprise the &quot;first generation&quot;.

==Suzuki chain of product groups==
Co0 has 4 conjugacy classes of elements of order 3. In M24 an element of shape 38 generates a group normal in a copy of S3, which commutes with a simple subgroup of order 168. A direct product in M24 permutes the octads of a trio and permutes 14 dodecad diagonal matrices in the monomial subgroup. In Co0 this monomial normalizer is expanded to a maximal subgroup of the form , where 2.A9 is the double cover of the alternating group A9.

John Thompson pointed out it would be fruitful to investigate the normalizers of smaller subgroups of the form 2.An . Several other maximal subgroups of Co0 are found in this way. Moreover, two sporadic groups appear in the resulting chain.

There is a subgroup , the only one of this chain not maximal in Co0. Next there is the subgroup . Next comes . The unitary group SU3(3) (order ) possesses a graph of 36 vertices, in anticipation of the next subgroup. That subgroup is , in which the Hall–Janko group HJ makes its appearance. The aforementioned graph expands to the Hall–Janko graph, with 100 vertices. Next comes , G2(4) being an exceptional group of Lie type.

The chain ends with 6.Suz:2 (Suz=Suzuki sporadic group), which, as mentioned above, respects a complex representation of the Leech Lattice.

==Generalized Monstrous Moonshine==

Conway and Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that monstrous moonshine is not limited to the monster. Larissa Queen and others subsequently found that one can construct the expansions of many Hauptmoduln from simple combinations of dimensions of sporadic groups. For the Conway groups, the relevant McKay–Thompson series is formula_3 = {1, 0, 276, , , , ...} () and formula_4 = {1, 0, 276, , , , ...} () where one can set the constant term ,

:formula_5

and &quot;η&quot;(&quot;τ&quot;) is the Dedekind eta function.

<text>The Kwun Tong line () is a rapid transit line of the MTR network in Hong Kong, coloured green on the MTR map. Starting at Whampoa in Hung Hom and ending at Tiu Keng Leng in Tseung Kwan O, Sai Kung, the route has 17 stations and takes 35 minutes to complete. The Kwun Tong line is one of the busiest railway lines on the network connecting the central and the eastern portions of Kowloon via Wong Tai Sin. The line is mostly underground, but includes a lengthy elevated section, and runs generally in an east-west direction. During the morning rush hour, the Kwun Tong line utilises 33 trains running at 29tph (trains per hour) to achieve a route capacity of 85,000 pphpd (passengers per hour per direction).

Opened on 1 October 1979 as the first urban railway line in Hong Kong and the first operated by the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC), the Kwun Tong line operates over much of the original section of the &quot;Modified Initial System&quot;, from Shek Kip Mei to Kwun Tong station, which it is named after. The line has seen the most changes in alignment of all the MTR lines, the most recent in 2016. It has crossed Victoria Harbour to serve Hong Kong Island using two separate routes in its history, though other lines have since taken over the harbour crossings; as such, the current route lies entirely within Kowloon except for Tiu Keng Leng in the New Territories. It has interchanges with four other lines: the Tsuen Wan line at Yau Ma Tei- Prince Edward station, the East Rail line at Kowloon Tong station, the Tuen Ma line at Ho Man Tin and Diamond Hill station, and the Tseung Kwan O line at Yau Tong and Tiu Keng Leng station.

==Route map==
== History ==
=== Initial section ===
The Kwun Tong line operates over the majority of the track used by the &quot;Modified Initial System&quot;, and can so be said to be the first MTR line to enter service. It was predated only by the suburban East Rail line, which at the time was in the process of being electrified and upgraded to a commuter service as part of the Kowloon–Canton Railway. Construction was approved in November 1975 under the administration of Governor Murray MacLehose, and service commenced on 1 October 1979. The line initially ran between Shek Kip Mei station and Kwun Tong station, and each train consisted of four cars. The trains were expanded to consist of 6 cars and 8 cars later respectively. It was extended to the south twice: firstly to Tsim Sha Tsui on 31 December 1979, and secondly to Central station on 12 February 1980 (named &quot;Chater&quot; at the time), crossing Victoria Harbour through the first underwater rail tunnel in Hong Kong and completing the original Modified Initial System plan.

When the Tsuen Wan line started service in May 1982, it took over the section of the Modified Initial System south of Argyle (present-day Mong Kok). At that point, Waterloo (present-day Yau Ma Tei) station became the terminus of the newly christened Kwun Tong line (until then, the line had no official name), and both Argyle and Prince Edward stations became cross-platform interchange stations with the new line.

=== Eastern extension ===
When the Hong Kong government decided to build a second harbour crossing in 1984, it awarded a franchise for the construction of a mixed rail and road tunnel under the harbour. Consequentially, the Kwun Tong line was extended through the new tunnel on 6 August 1989 to a new terminus at Quarry Bay, a transfer station with the newly built Island line. An intermediate station, Lam Tin, was opened on 1 October of the same year.

The first derailment in MTR history (excluding ex-KCR lines) took place at Kowloon Bay station in 1994. The seventh carriage of a train pulling into the station at about jumped the tracks on 28 January 1994, on a section of track adjacent to the MTR headquarters building. Nobody was injured, though train services were disrupted. The incident was blamed on a bolt in the train&#x27;s suspension system which had worked itself loose, causing the weight load to be concentrated on the rear wheels of the carriage.

As part of a project to reduce congestion at Quarry Bay, the Kwun Tong line was briefly extended to North Point on 27 September 2001. This station did not last as the terminus for long, as the newly built Tseung Kwan O line would take over the cross-harbour portion of the route in 2002. On 18 August 2002, The Kwun Tong line was extended to Tiu Keng Leng, its present eastern terminus, coinciding with the opening of the Tseung Kwan O line.

Although not in regular service, the original tunnel linking the Kwun Tong line to the Eastern Harbour Crossing continues to be maintained and can be utilised in the event of a disruption on the Tseung Kwan O line. Such an incident occurred on 16 December 2013, when a train on the Tseung Kwan O line broke down, halting train services on the entire line for several hours. To prevent cross-harbour train service from being disrupted, all Kwun Tong line trains temporarily used the old tracks from Lam Tin to Quarry Bay and terminated at North Point, as they did before the opening of the Tseung Kwan O line. This was the first time since 2002 that the Lam Tin to Quarry Bay tracks were utilised for regular service.

=== Western extension ===

As part of its bid for Sha Tin to Central Link (SCL) in the early 2000s, the MTR Corporation proposed an extension of the Kwun Tong line to serve the Whampoa Garden area, with an interchange at Ho Man Tin to an extended Ma On Shan line, which would provide an alternate route to the Tsuen Wan line across Victoria Harbour to Central South station. Its competitor, the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, suggested constructing an Automated People Mover between Hung Hom and Whampoa instead.

After the MTR–KCR merger in 2007, the Hong Kong government appointed the MTRC to construct the SCL between Tai Wai and Hung Hom according to the KCRC&#x27;s modified proposal, which would see the Ma On Shan and West Rail lines merged to form the Tuen Ma line, while also extending the Kwun Tong line to Whampoa as per the MTRC&#x27;s own proposal. The benefits would be a better transfer arrangement at Ho Man Tin and other SCL interchange stations for services to the northeastern and northwestern New Territories. Passengers would be able to change to the North-South corridor at Hung Hom for cross-harbour services, which would terminate at Admiralty after Central South station was removed from the final plan.

The Kwun Tong line extension (abbreviated KTE; ) from Yau Ma Tei to Whampoa via Ho Man Tin began construction on 25 July 2011 and opened for service on 23 October 2016. Because of capacity limitations due to the single platform at Whampoa, half of all Whampoa-bound trains terminate at Ho Man Tin during peak hours; all trains terminate at Whampoa during off-peak hours.

A further extension of the Kwun Tong line to Hong Kong Island was also proposed in RDS-2000 to constitute the fifth harbour crossing.

==Rolling stock==

== Route description ==
The Kwun Tong line is mostly underground and runs generally east-west. It starts at Whampoa station and heads northwest, with an interchange to the Tuen Ma line at Ho Man Tin. It curves to the southwest and then north to meet the Tsuen Wan line at Yau Ma Tei, with the Tsuen Wan line platforms above the Kwun Tong Line platforms. At this point, the line runs underneath Nathan Road alongside the Tsuen Wan line, with stations at Mong Kok and Prince Edward providing cross-platform interchanges.

The Kwun Tong line then splits from the Tsuen Wan line and turns to the east after Shek Kip Mei. At Kowloon Tong, there is an important, widely used interchange with the suburban East Rail line. Continuing eastwards through Wong Tai Sin, the line interchanges with the Tuen Ma line again at Diamond Hill, after which it turns south and emerges above ground after Choi Hung station. It then runs southeast on a viaduct above Kwun Tong Road between Kowloon Bay and Lam Tin stations.

After Lam Tin station, the line travels through a tunnel in a hill and emerges above ground level at Yau Tong (although the line is completely covered at this point), where it meets with the Tseung Kwan O line. Both the Kwun Tong and Tseung Kwan O lines pass beneath the Tseung Kwan O cemetery in tunnel before entering Tseung Kwan O in an northeasterly direction and eventually terminating at Tiu Keng Leng station. Yau Tong and Tiu Keng Leng stations provide cross-platform interchanges in the same manner as Mong Kok and Prince Edward. Expansions for the Kwun Tong line to the east have been made impossible due to the building structure of Tseung Kwan O station, just mere meters ahead from the end of the Kwun Tong line tunnels.

<text>DeHavilland Information Services Ltd is a British media company that provides political monitoring services for public affairs professionals. The company was founded in 1998 by Conservative MP Adam Afriyie.

==History==

DeHavilland Global Knowledge Distribution PLC was set up in 1998 by Adam Afriyie and William Bracken. The business was initially funded using profits from Mr Afriyie&#x27;s previous successful business venture, IT solutions firm Connect Support Services Ltd.

Based in a small office in Victoria, London, the service was set up to offer a tailored stream of information and analysis covering the latest developments in UK politics, designed to assist public affairs professionals in achieving their campaigning objectives.

Later moving to Canary Wharf in December 1998, the company initially provided both a news service entitled DirectNews and a core monitoring product entitled Public Affairs Briefing. 

Mr Afriyie sold his 72 per cent stake in DeHavilland to publishing, information and events business EMAP in July 2005 for a reported £13m, two months after he became Conservative MP for Windsor.

Immediately prior to the sale the news division was separated out to become a standalone company, Adfero Ltd. Adfero was later rebranded as content marketing agency Axonn Media.

Having previously been listed on the FTSE 100 Index, EMAP was bought by Apax and Guardian Media Group in 2008.

In 2010, a London-and-Brussels-based sister service, DeHavilland EU, was created.

EMAP was rebranded to Top Right Group in 2012, and DeHavilland became part of the company&#x27;s 4C information services division.

In 2012, it was widely reported that DeHavilland would be sold to rival political monitoring provider Dods (Group) PLC. However, the planned deal was dropped after being referred to the Competition Commission by the Office of Fair Trading, which ruled that if combined, the two companies would command a market share of more than 25 per cent.

The OFT concluded: &quot;The evidence suggests that the parties are by far, the largest suppliers in the market. The OFT has found that the parties are also close competitors, indeed each other’s closest competitor, the estimated diversion ratios between them are high. Internal documents suggest that this acquisition could aid Dods to maintain and increase its yields rather have them reduced by competition&quot;.

DeHavilland therefore remained a subsidiary of Top Right Group, which was again renamed in late 2015, becoming known as Ascential Group. Following rumours of a sale, the company floated on the stock exchange at £800m in early 2016.

On the 12th February 2021 it was announced that DeHavilland and had been sold for £13 million to international alternative asset fund management group Bridgepoint. On 4th August 2023, Bowmark Capital, a mid-market private equity firm, has invested in DeHavilland too.

==People==

A successful businessman at the time he created the company, founder Adam Afriyie stepped back from day-to-day operations in his latter years of financial involvement in DeHavilland, ultimately selling his two-thirds stake in 2005, the same year he entered Parliament as the Conservative MP for Windsor.

Former employees of DeHavilland include Conservative MP Conor Burns and Liberal Democrat MP Edward Morello.

<text>&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-Diethyl-&quot;meta&quot;-toluamide, also called diethyltoluamide or DEET (, from DET, the initials of di- + ethyl + toluamide), is the oldest, one of the most effective, and most common active ingredients in commercial insect repellents. It is a slightly yellow oil intended to be applied to the skin or to clothing and provides protection against mosquitoes, flies, ticks, fleas, chiggers, leeches, and many other biting insects.

==Effectiveness==
DEET is effective against a variety of invertebrates, including ticks, flies, mosquitos, and some parasitic worms.

A 2018 systematic review found no consistent performance difference between DEET and icaridin in field studies and concluded that they are equally preferred mosquito repellents, noting that 50% DEET offers longer protection but is not available in some countries.

===Concentrations===
The concentration of DEET in products may range from less than 10% to nearly 100%, but concentrations greater than 50% do not increase the duration of protection. Higher concentrations can be safely applied to clothing, although it may damage some types of synthetic fibers. In the United Kingdom, the publicly-funded healthcare system, the National Health Service (NHS), recommends that UK citizens should use a concentration of 50% when visiting areas of the world with malaria. A lower concentration of 10% is recommended for infants and children. Health Canada decided to limit DEET concentration to 30% in the country since 2002 due to an increased long-term risk observed with repeated applications.

DEET is often sold and used in spray or lotion in concentrations up to 100%. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; found a correlation between DEET concentration and hours of protection against insect bites. 100% DEET was found to offer up to 12 hours of protection while several lower concentration DEET formulations (20–34%) offered 3–6 hours of protection. Other research has corroborated the effectiveness of DEET. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends 30–50% DEET to prevent the spread of pathogens carried by insects.

A 2008 study found that higher concentrations of DEET have an improved ability to repel insects through fabric.

==Contraindications==
DEET should not be used on children younger than 2 months of age.

==Adverse effects==
When used as directed, products containing between 10% and 30% DEET have been found by the American Academy of Pediatrics to be safe to use on children as well as adults.

As a precaution, manufacturers advise that DEET products should not be used under clothing or on damaged skin, and that preparations be washed off after they are no longer needed or between applications. DEET can irritate the eyes and, unlike icaridin, it can cause breathing difficulty, headaches, or, in rare cases, it may cause severe epidermal reactions.

The authors of a 2002 study published in &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; wrote:
... this repellent has been subjected to more scientific and toxicologic scrutiny than any other repellent substance. ... DEET has a remarkable safety profile after 40 years of use and nearly 8 billion human applications. Fewer than 50 cases of serious toxic effects have been documented in ... medical literature since 1960 ... Many of these cases of toxic effects involved long-term, heavy, frequent, or whole-body application of DEET. No correlation has been found between the concentration of DEET used and the risk of toxic effects. ... When applied with common sense, DEET-based repellents can be expected to provide a safe as well as a long-lasting repellent effect ... under circumstances in which it is crucial to be protected against arthropod bites that might transmit disease.

In the DEET Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) in 1998, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported 14 to 46 cases of potential DEET-associated seizures, including four deaths. The EPA states: &quot;... it does appear that some cases are likely related to DEET toxicity,&quot; which may underreport the risk as physicians may fail to check for history of DEET use or fail to report cases of seizure subsequent to DEET use.

In 1997, the Pesticide Information Project of Cooperative Extension Offices of Cornell University stated that &quot;Everglades National Park employees having extensive DEET exposure were more likely to have insomnia, mood disturbances and impaired cognitive function than lesser exposed co-workers&quot;.

Citing human health reasons, Health Canada barred the sale of insect repellents for human use that contained more than 30% DEET in a 2002 re-evaluation &quot;based on a human health risk assessment that considered daily application of DEET over a prolonged period of time&quot;. The agency recommended that DEET-based products be used on children between the ages of 2 and 12 only if the concentration of DEET is 10% or less and that repellents be applied no more than 3 times a day, children under 2 should not receive more than 1 application of repellent in a day and DEET-based products of any concentration should not be used on infants under 6 months.

A 2020 study performed by students within the University of Florida&#x27;s College of Public Health and Health Professions analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and identified 1,205 participants who had &quot;DEET metabolic levels recorded at or above detection limits&quot;. They analyzed biomarkers related to systemic inflammation, immune, liver, and kidney functions, and found no &quot;evidence that DEET exposure has any impact on the biomarkers identified.&quot;

=== Detection in body fluids ===
DEET may be measured in blood, plasma, or urine by gas or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma DEET concentrations are expected to be in a range of 0.3–3.0 mg/L during the first 8 hours after dermal application in persons using the chemical appropriately, &gt;6 mg/L in intoxicated patients and &gt;100 mg/L in victims of acute intentional oral overdose.

==Overdose==
Applying DEET to the skin is safe if done as directed. Adverse reactions are very rare, about 1 in 100 million people. However, repeated use of DEET in very high concentrations can lead to toxic encephalopathy with severe neurological symptoms including seizures, tremors and slurred speech. The risk is higher for children since they have a greater surface area to body weight ratio.

==Interactions==
Limited data indicates that combining insect repellents with DEET and sunscreen decreases the sun protection factor of the sunscreen by about a third. Unlike icaridin, the combination also increases the absorption of both significantly. When the two need to be used together, the repellent should be applied after the sunscreen has been absorbed, about 30 or more minutes later.

When DEET is used in combination with insecticides for cockroaches it can strengthen the toxicity of carbamate, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. These 1996 findings indicate that DEET has neurological effects on insects in addition to known olfactory effects, and that its toxicity is strengthened in combination with other insecticides.

==Damage to materials==
Unlike icaridin, DEET is an effective solvent and may dissolve some watch crystals, plastics, rayon, spandex, other synthetic fabrics, and painted or varnished surfaces including nail polish. It also may act as a plasticizer by remaining inside some formerly hard plastics, leaving them softened and more flexible. DEET is incompatible with rayon, acetate, or dynel clothing.

==Environmental impact==
Though DEET is not expected to bioaccumulate, it has been found to have a slight toxicity for fresh-water fish such as rainbow trout and tilapia, and it also has been shown to be toxic for some species of freshwater zooplankton. DEET has been detected at low concentrations in water bodies as a result of production and use, such as in the Mississippi River and its tributaries, where a 1991 study detected levels varying from 5 to 201 ng/L.

A 1975 study analyzed the effects of DEET on communities of freshwater organisms native to Chinese waterways and found that DEET was moderately toxic to aquatic organisms compared to other commercial insect repellants. The most-at-risk organisms were algae colonies which often experienced &quot;significant biomass decline and community composition shift[s]&quot; when exposed to DEET at 500 ng/L.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmidhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109881&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;

DEET is biodegraded by fungi into products less toxic to zooplankton. It degrades well under aerobic conditions, but poorly and slowly under anaerobic conditions.

==Mechanism of action==
DEET is thought to provide protection from mosquitos via two pathways, both by negatively impacting mosquito odorant receptors at a distance, and by negatively impacting mosquito chemoreceptors upon contact. The exact mechanisms are still being researched, but the two most likely hypotheses are the &quot;smell and avoid hypothesis&quot; (that DEET has an unpleasant odor to insects), and the &quot;bewilderment hypothesis&quot; (that smelling DEET confuses insects). An alternative hypothesis is that DEET &quot;masks&quot; humans by reducing the volatility of skin odorants that are attractive to insects.

==Synthesis==
A slightly yellow liquid at room temperature, it can be prepared by converting &quot;m&quot;-toluic acid (3-methylbenzoic acid) to the corresponding acyl chloride using thionyl chloride (SOCl2), and then allowing that product to react with diethylamine:

==History==
DEET was developed in 1944 by Samuel Gertler of the United States Department of Agriculture for use by the United States Army, following its experience of jungle warfare during World War II. It was originally tested as a pesticide on farm fields, and entered military use in 1946 and civilian use in 1957. It was used in Vietnam and Southeast Asia.

In its original form, known as &quot;bug juice&quot;, the application solution was composed of 75% DEET and 25% ethanol. Later, a new version of the repellent was developed by the U.S. Army and the USDA. This formulation consisted of DEET and a mixture of polymers that extended its release and reduced its evaporation rate. This extended-release application was registered by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1991.

<text>Sheffield station (formerly Pond Street and later Sheffield Midland) is a combined railway station and tram stop in Sheffield, England; it is the busiest station in South Yorkshire, and the second busiest in Yorkshire &amp; the Humber, after Leeds. Adjacent is the Sheffield Supertram stop.

==History==
===1870 – 1960===

The station was opened in 1870 by the Midland Railway to the designs of the company architect John Holloway Sanders. It was the fifth and last station to be built in Sheffield city centre.

The station was built on the &#x27;New Line&#x27;, which ran between Grimesthorpe Junction, on the former Sheffield and Rotherham Railway, and Tapton Junction, just north of Chesterfield. This line replaced the Midland Railway&#x27;s previous route, the &#x27;old road&#x27;, to London, which ran from Sheffield Wicker via Rotherham.

The new line and station were built despite some controversy and opposition locally. The Duke of Norfolk, who owned land in the area, insisted that the southern approach be in a tunnel and the land known as The Farm landscaped to prevent the line being seen. Some years later the tunnel was opened out into a cutting. Sheffield Corporation was so concerned about the eastern side of the city being cut off from the city centre that it insisted that public access be preserved across the railway site.

The station and Pond Street Goods Depot opened on a damp and cold day without any celebrations. There were originally different passenger entrances for each class. The original station buildings have been preserved and are between island platforms 2 to 5.

The station was given two extra platforms and a new frontage in 1905 at a cost of £215,000 (). The enlargements consisted of creating an island platform out of the old platform 1 and building a new platform 1 and a new entrance. These works were overseen by the Chief Architect to the Midland Railway Charles Trubshaw.

Offices were built at the north end of the long carriageway rooftop. A large parcels office was built to the south of the main buildings. Two footbridges connected the platforms, the one to the north for passengers, the one to the south for station staff and parcels. The tracks were covered by two overall roofs. The older and larger spanned platforms 5 and 6, and an identical structure can still be viewed today at Bath Green Park railway station; the other platforms 1 and 2. Wartime damage put the roofs beyond economic repair; hence, they were removed in the autumn of 1956 and replaced by low-level awnings.

===1960 – 2002===
The 1960s saw the introduction of the Class 45 and Class 46 diesel-electric engines, known as &quot;Peaks&quot;. Sheaf House was built in 1965 adjacent to the station to house British Rail&#x27;s Sheffield Division headquarters. As part of the reconstruction of the area as the &quot;Gateway to Sheffield&quot;, it was demolished in early 2006. In 1970, Sheffield&#x27;s other main station, Sheffield Victoria, was closed and its remaining services, from Penistone, were diverted until 1981 via a cumbersome reversal. The Pullman service between Sheffield Victoria and London King&#x27;s Cross, including the morning and evening &quot;Master Cutler&quot; now ran onto the East Coast Main Line via Retford from Sheffield Midland instead. This was the third route used by the train of that name; originally it had run to London Marylebone. The station was resignalled in 1972, and its track layout remodelled. British Rail introduced the High Speed Train (HST) to Sheffield on the Midland Main Line in 1984. The cross-country services had seen the introduction of the HSTs in 1982. On 21 December 1991, the station was flooded by the River Sheaf, which flows under it. A log that was part of the debris commemorates the event on platform 5. In 1991. construction of the new Supertram network began and by late 1994 Sheffield Midland was connected to the network, after the opening of the line between Fitzalan Square in the city centre and Spring Lane, to the east of the station.

===2002 – present===
In 2002, Midland Mainline, as the main train operating company of the station, instigated a major regeneration of Sheffield station. Before this, a taxi rank was located inside what is now the main concourse and the new entrance hall. The stone façade of the station was sandblasted and its archways filled with unobstructed windows to improve views both from inside and out. Other changes included the improvement of platform surfaces and the addition of a pedestrian bridge connecting the station concourse with the Sheffield Supertram stop at the far side of the station.

To coincide with the regeneration of the station, Sheaf Square was rebuilt as part of a project designed to create the Gateway to Sheffield. The station and the square form part of a route that leads passengers through the square past the Cutting Edge water feature, up Howard Street and into the Heart of the City. This Gateway to Sheffield won the Project of the Year Award in the 2006 National Rail Awards.

On 11 November 2007, East Midlands Trains, an amalgamation of Midland Mainline and part of Central Trains, took over the management of the station.

In December 2009, following the restoration of the station, a new pub, the Sheffield Tap, opened next to platform 1B. The room, located within the main station building, had been used as a store room for 35 years but was used for much longer as a bar and restaurant, catering for first class passengers since 1904. The bar has a restored early 20th century interior and offers a selection of quality cask ales and beers from around the world. Since opening, the bar has won the National Railway Heritage Award and the Cask Ale pub of the year award.

In October 2010, East Midland Trains initiated £10 million worth of improvements to its stations. Sheffield received renovated waiting rooms, toilet facilities and upgraded security systems amongst its improvements.
A new first class lounge on platform 5, part of these improvements, opened on 18 January 2011. The lounge was opened by the Master Cutler Professor Bill Speirs who was joined by 50 top business leaders from Sheffield and the surrounding area.

In 2008, East Midlands Trains revealed its intention to restrict access to parts of the station by installing ticket barriers to try to prevent passengers from travelling without a ticket. This proposal met with widespread opposition from residents and Council members because the footbridge would be closed off to non-ticket holders, severing a popular thoroughfare from the Norfolk Park residential area and the Supertram stop on one side, to the station travel centre, the bus interchange, the city centre and the city centre campus of Sheffield Hallam University on the other. On 6 May 2009, East Midlands Trains implemented its proposal, using temporary barriers and ticket inspectors to bar access to the footbridge to non-ticket holders, and local residents and Supertram passengers were forced to use longer routes around the station.

In November 2009, East Midlands Trains were refused planning permission for the barriers by the council, but in February 2010 announced it would apply again. Transport Secretary Lord Adonis announced in April 2010 that barriers would not be installed until a second bridge was built to maintain a thoroughfare for non-ticket holders.

From September 2010, East Midlands Trains used uniformed staff to prevent local residents using the footbridge. At the same time, Sheffield City Council explored the possibility of turning the bridge into a public right-of-way to resolve the matter. In late 2010, it was reported that the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, MP for Sheffield Hallam, might intervene to resolve the impasse.

In March 2012, Transport Minister Justine Greening offered £3 million to build a new footbridge to resolve the problem.

Tickets are not currently required to enter the station or to use the footbridge, which gives access to the Sheffield Station tram stop to the east.

===Future===
Ian Yeowart, former managing director of Grand Central, put forward in 2009 a bid for new open access Alliance Rail Holdings services operating on the East Coast Main Line. As part of the scheme, four services a day would operate between Sheffield and London King&#x27;s Cross via Alfreton, Nottingham and Grantham, meaning Sheffield would be connected to the capital by both the Midland Main Line and the East Coast Main Line routes once again. Yeowart has proposed the resurrection of the name GNER for the service, which has been unused since the last franchise of that name ended in 2007. However, in 2010 these proposed Sheffield to London Kings Cross services via the East Coast Main Line were rejected. In the 2010 Rail Utilisation Strategy, it quoted that the Midland Main Line north of Bedford will be electrified in 2020. The line is currently one of the few major main lines that is not electrified and the plan found that the project would provide significantly enhanced services and significant financial savings.
In July 2017 Transport Secretary, Chris Grayling, announced the electrification plan for the whole of the Midland Main Line would not go ahead as previously planned. Instead the section from Clay Cross in Derbyshire to Sheffield will be electrified by 2033 as part of the planned HS2. As an interim measure bi-mode trains, claimed to offer benefits similar to high speed electric trains were to be used. A National Audit Office report said: &quot;In the case of Midland Main Line, bi-mode trains with the required speed and acceleration did not exist when the Secretary of State made his decision.&quot; The MP for Loughborough (another area to have been served by the proposed electrification scheme) and Chair of the Treasury Select Committee, Nicky Morgan said of the revised plans, &quot;Now we see the decision to cancel it was based on fantasy trains that didn&#x27;t even exist and the Midlands being a guinea pig for an untested technology&quot;.

CrossCountry, aspiring to improve their overall network and services, aims to increase services between Sheffield and Leeds. East Midlands Railway also plans to make service improvements to its services between Liverpool and Norwich via Sheffield with two-car Class 158 trains doubling in capacity to four cars. Coupled with newly acquired Class 156 trains, this will lead to an extra 1,500 seats being available each day on this service. Northern, responsible for operating most local services in the Sheffield area, announced in August 2011 that extra services between Sheffield and Manchester Piccadilly would begin in December that year. The Hope Valley Line, which will see an extra service in each direction during the peak evening period, is a key commuter route and currently has a two-hour gap in its evening schedule, which will be filled by the new services.

As part of the HS2 plans, a new platform would need to be constructed which would provide additional capacity for HS2, which approved the new route via Sheffield in July 2017. Two trains per hour are to serve Sheffield on the new high speed line. The work for HS2 will see the footprint of the station expand and major reconfiguration of the tram and roads surrounding the station to accommodate the extra services.

==Facilities==
The main station entrance, facing Sheaf Square, is the location of the main concourse and most of the station&#x27;s facilities. The ticket office, ticket machines, information desk and a number of retail units are located there, and public toilets and facilities such as cash machines. There are further shops and facilities on the island platforms and in the Supertram entrance hall at the far side of the station. There are waiting rooms on the island platforms and the East Midlands Railway first class lounge is within the station buildings, on platform 5.

There is a 678-space car park situated next to the main station building (Q Park) and there is a reserved parking area for blue badge holders in the main station building. There is also a taxi rank (Sheffield Taxi Group) outside the station building, next to the disabled car park. Bicycle storage is provided on platforms 1a and 3a. The whole station, including platforms, concourse and Supertram stop, is accessible to disabled passengers.

==Layout==
The station is divided into four parts: the main building/concourse and platforms 1a/1b; the first island with platforms 2a-5b; the second island with platforms 6a-8b; and the adjoining Supertram stop. All sections are connected by a large footbridge.

Sheffield station is designed to accommodate both through and terminating trains.

The National Rail station has 9 platforms, numbered 1 to 8 and 2C. 2C, 3, 4 and 7 can be used by terminating trains only. 1, 3 and 4 are divided into &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; sections to allow a brief stabling of terminating services before they are scheduled to depart. The station has four through roads which are used for through running or more commonly for stabling stock. Between platforms 5 and 6 these are known as &quot;1-Up&quot; and &quot;2-Up&quot; (they are on the &quot;Up&quot; or London-bound side of the station) whilst between platforms 1 and 2 are the &quot;through road&quot; with a direct path through the station or by a central crossover to the north end of platform 1 (1b), and &quot;down station siding&quot;.

Prior to the 1972, multiple-aspect signalling (MAS) scheme, the southern half of the current platform 8 was called platform 9. Trains from the north from platform 9 could avoid trains stood at platform 8 via an additional through road.

The Sheffield Station tram stop on the South Yorkshire Supertram network was built on top of a walled high above platform 8 on the eastern side of the station. It was connected to platform 6 of the main station by a simple staircase. 

It was rebuilt and refurbished in 2002. A new footbridge connected the tram stop with the railway station. Following the opening of the new stop and platforms, the old platforms were left in situ and are only used in times of engineering works where additional platform space is needed.

HS2 Services

HS2 will see a spur south of Chesterfield branch off the Main Route, which will go via the M18, allowing trains to head into a stop at Chesterfield and also head to Sheffield via the Sheffield to Leeds Line.












== Sheffield Supertram stop ==
Sheffield Station tram stop has direct interchange with the railway station. It was built on top of a walled that formerly carried Granville Street past the station, which was downgraded to a lineside public footpath when the embankment was repurposed to carry the Supertram line. The stop also serves the City Campus of Sheffield Hallam University and the Park Hill estate above the railway station.

The stop opened on 22 August 1994, and originally had three platforms – two on the northbound (inbound to the city centre) track, to allow for terminating Purple Route services prior to their extension to Cathedral in the city centre – and was connected to platform 6 of the main station by a simple staircase.

In line with the refurbishment of the rest of the station in the early 2000s, the tram stop was rebuilt in 2002 around to the south of the existing platforms. As well as two new platforms, a ticket hall was constructed at the end of the main station footbridge over the top of platform 8, providing a direct connection from the tram stop to the station footbridge and the rest of the mainline station.

The Blue route has a peak frequency of 5 trams per hour (every 12 minutes), and the Purple route runs hourly Monday−Saturday and every 30 minutes (peak frequency) on Sundays.

<text>Kinlochleven () () is a coastal village located in Lochaber, in the Scottish Highlands and lies at the eastern end of Loch Leven. To the north lie the Mamores ridge; to the south lie the mountains flanking Glen Coe.

The village was formed from two previously separate small communities – Kinlochmore to the north of the River Leven in Inverness-shire and Kinlochbeg to the south of the Leven in Argyll – following the construction of an aluminium smelter and associated housing for its employees. The processing plant was powered by a hydroelectric scheme situated in the mountains above, and made Kinlochleven the first village in the world to have every house connected to electricity, coining the phrase &quot;The Electric Village&quot;. In 1991, the village (according to annual census returns) had just over 1000 inhabitants in some 420 households. Today it is a notable tourist destination and centre for mountain pursuits.

==Smelter==

Work on the dam and water supply system began in 1905 and was completed in 1907. The hydro-electric scheme was constructed for the British Aluminium Company and was designed by engineer brothers Patrick and Charles Meik. The chief assistant resident engineer on the project was a young William Halcrow. The scheme involved the construction of a gravity dam over 914 m long (the longest in the Highlands) and 27 m high, creating the Blackwater Reservoir. It was built at an elevation of over 305 m in rugged and almost inaccessible terrain, and involved the construction of some 6 km of concrete aqueduct and nearly 13 km of steel pipe. It has been described as the last major creation of the traditional &#x27;navvy&#x27; whose activities in the construction of canals and railways left an indelible mark on the British countryside.

The construction of the Blackwater Dam and the associated aluminium smelter featured in the novel &quot;Children of the Dead End&quot; by Patrick MacGill who worked on the project as a navvie. Some incidents in the book were based on actual characters and events on the Blackwater site; for example, one morning a worker drove his pick into a rock, inadvertently hitting a buried explosive charge which drove his pick into his neck and killed him. This incident was recorded as happening to an Inverness man in April 1908.

The British Aluminium Company was merged in 1982 with the Canadian company Alcan to form British Alcan. In November 2007, British Alcan was acquired by Rio Tinto and became Rio Tinto Alcan.

In its early days the aluminium reduction plant employed some 700 people. Although producing some of the highest grade aluminium, its small size in comparison to modern US smelters led to its closure in June 2000. The associated hydro-electric plant was converted into a general purpose power station connected to the National Grid.

==Tourism==
Kinlochleven is the penultimate stop on the West Highland Way and an important tourism destination in the Scottish Highlands. The village lies at the head of the fjord-like Loch Leven and is surrounded on three sides by steep mountains. There are 10 Munro mountains (mountains over ) in the Mamores above Kinlochleven with Binnein Mòr the highest. Indeed, the area around and above Kinlochleven contains more wild mountain land than all of the mountain national parks in England and Wales combined. There is a significant network of mountain biking and hiking trails, and the Ice Factor National Ice Climbing Centre, one of the top five visitor attractions in the highlands.

The West Highland Way attracts over 85,000 walkers each year and plays a vital role in the Kinlochleven economy. An economic impact assessment of Mountaineering confirms the value to the highlands to be £163.7m each year, and because of this there has been continued support to expand the existing long-distance hiking and biking trails. This has seen new developments, such as the Great Glen Way and the Stevenson Way, which follows the route of Alan Breck Stewart and Jamie Balfour as they flee pursuing redcoats in the &quot;Kidnapped&quot; novel.

There are various accommodation options including hotels, guest houses, bed and breakfast, bunkhouses and campsites in the village, which also has a store, banking and post office facilities. A visitor centre, &quot;The Aluminium Story&quot;, tells the story of the creation of the village to serve the aluminium smelting facility.

There is a hostel, microlodge facility and campsite close to the river. It has eight microlodges comprising a mixture of two and four berth accommodation. There are toilets, showers and dishwashing facilities. The refurbished hostel building, located on Lab Road, was previously used as the research and testing facility for British Aluminium.

The Tailrace Inn opened in 1995 and provides accommodation, food and beverages for walkers, visitors and locals alike. It is located centrally in the village and is named after the fast flowing water outlet that enters the River Leven from the power house of the old aluminium factory. The Tailrace can be viewed from the bridge across the river.

===Ice Factor: The National Ice Climbing Centre===
A major mountain activity centre, the Ice Factor, opened to the public in 2003. It was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip on 5 June 2005. It includes the biggest indoor ice climbing wall in the world, the UK&#x27;s highest indoor articulated rock climbing wall and a competition bouldering wall voted the best in the UK.

Ice Factor catered for climbers and adventure seekers of all ages and abilities, from beginner to expert. In 2010 a new Giant Outdoor Aerial Adventure Course was added. Throughout the year Ice Factor also offers bespoke guided days on the local mountains of Glen Coe and Ben Nevis; each winter it ran specialist winter skills and mountaineering courses. The centre was also an important staging post on the West Highland Way, providing facilities for walkers, including a bar, sauna and steam room. It also had a mountaineers&#x27; cafe and a shop stocking gifts and mountaineering and camping equipment. Due to its contribution to the local economy it secured several awards, including Visit Scotland Thistle Awards for Tourism Excellence and a Green Apple Award as Best Environmental Business Europe.

Ice Factor was the base for the Skyline Scotland races in 2016.

Ice Factor closed in March 2023 following an unpaid rent dispute, but was reported to be set to reopen in September 2023.

===Micro-brewery===

A smaller part of the former coke bunker – for carbon production – for the aluminium reduction works, was transformed in 2002 into Atlas Brewery which, together with Orkney Brewery, was taken over in 2006 to form Sinclair Brewery Ltd. Atlas was closed in July 2010 and its production transferred to Orkney. The micro-brewery was re-opened in 2011 by Harry Heskey (former head brewer for Atlas) and now provides River Leven Ales.

==Recent regeneration==
The Kinlochleven Community Trust, a partnership consisting of the local community, (Rio Tinto) Alcan, Lochaber Enterprise, Highland Council and Scottish Natural Heritage, supported by other agencies in Scotland and the European Union and chaired by Highland Councillor Drew McFarlane-Slack led the economic revival of the village. To date environmental improvements, new business pavilions, extensive path works and decontamination works have contributed to growth in the village and surrounding area.

The biggest recent development was a new campus, consisting of Kinlochleven High School, Primary School and Nursery which opened in August 2008. A local library is shared with the school. It has books, local information and computer internet access.

== Infrastructure ==
The B863 road runs round the head of Loch Leven through Kinlochleven, connecting to Glencoe to the south-west and North Ballachulish to the north-west. There was no road along the south side of Loch Leven until .

Kinlochleven was never connected to the railway network, however the station in nearby South Ballachulish was renamed in 1908 as Ballachulish (Glencoe) for Kinlochleven.

A pier was constructed on the southern shore of Loch Leven for the construction of the hydroelectric scheme and aluminium smelter. A narrow-gauge railway approximately long linked the pier and the smelter.

==Wildlife==
The Kinlochleven area is home to many protected species, including tawny owls, barn owls, European pine martens, pipistrelle bats and otters. A hybrid wildcat was captured on film in 2018. White-tailed eagles are regularly seen, while stags regularly walk through the village. Golden eagles have been seen in the mountains surrounding the village.

<text>Revelation Records is an independent record label focusing originally and primarily on hardcore punk. The label is known for releases by bands such as Youth of Today, Warzone, Sick of It All, Quicksand, Side By Side, Chain of Strength, Shelter, Judge, No for an Answer, Gorilla Biscuits, and End of a Year.

Revelation, along with the bands it put out in the late 1980s, is usually credited with creating and cementing the &quot;youth crew&quot; sound as well as New York hardcore, which bridged the gap from the earlier bands of almost a decade before and helped carry the music through the early 1990s. Some of the label&#x27;s best selling releases have been Gorilla Biscuits&#x27; &quot;Start Today&quot;, Inside Out&#x27;s &quot;No Spiritual Surrender&quot;, and the &quot;In-Flight Program&quot; compilation.

== History ==
Formerly of New Haven, Connecticut, it is now based in Huntington Beach, California. It was founded in 1987 by owner Jordan Cooper, along with Ray Cappo of Youth of Today, with the sole intent of producing the Warzone &quot;Lower East Side Crew&quot; 7-inch. Within the year, they put out two more releases and a limited 4th pressing of Youth of Today&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Close My Eyes 7-inch&quot;, which had been originally released on Positive Force Records, just for the two of them to trade for vintage G.I.Joes and other action figures. In the first three years, the label put out 23 releases and pressed approximately 50,000 records, and it has continued to release an average of 7–8 albums a year.

Cappo left the business in 1988, to focus on his band Shelter. He also started his own label Equal Vision Records (which he later sold to Youth of Today roadie, former Revelation employee and friend, Steve Reddy), though his albums were still released by Revelation after that, and he also operated Supersoul Records.

The label put out several definitive hardcore and metalcore records in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with notable releases coming from Damnation A.D., Will Haven, Shai Hulud, Curl Up and Die, and Himsa. However, by the mid-2000s, Revelation Records had seemingly fallen by the wayside, with very few releases between 2004 and 2006. However, the label is returning to its former stature as a premier old-school hardcore label with strong releases from newer bands like Down to Nothing, Shook Ones, and Sinking Ships.
