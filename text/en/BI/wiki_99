<text>Arsenio Rodríguez (born Ignacio Arsenio Travieso Scull; August 31, 1911 – December 30, 1970) was a Cuban musician, composer and bandleader. He played the tres, as well as the tumbadora, and he specialized in son, rumba and other Afro-Cuban music styles. In the 1940s and 1950s Rodríguez established the &quot;conjunto&quot; format and contributed to the development of the son montuno, the basic template of modern-day salsa. He claimed to be the true creator of the mambo and was an important as well as a prolific composer who wrote nearly two hundred songs.

Despite being blind since the age of seven, Rodríguez quickly managed to become one of Cuba&#x27;s foremost &quot;treseros&quot;. His first hit, &quot;Bruca maniguá&quot; by Orquesta Casino de la Playa, came as a songwriter in 1937. For the following two years Rodríguez worked as composer and guest guitarist for the Casino de la Playa. In 1940 he formed his &quot;conjunto&quot;, one of the first of its kind. After recording over a hundred songs for RCA Victor over the course of twelve years, Rodríguez moved to New York in 1952, where he remained active, releasing several albums. In 1970, Rodríguez moved to Los Angeles, where he died of pneumonia.

== Life and career ==

===Early life===
Ignacio Arsenio Travieso Scull was born on August 31, 1911, in Güira de Macurijes in Bolondrón (Pedro Betancourt), Matanzas Province. He was the third of fifteen children, fourteen boys and one girl, to Bonifacio Travieso, a farmer and veteran of the Cuban War of Independence, and Dorotea Rodríguez Scull. His family had Kongo origins, and both his grandfather and great-grandfather were practitioners of Palo Monte. By the time Arsenio was four, in 1915, his family moved to the town of Güines, where his three younger siblings (Estela, Israel &quot;Kike&quot; and Raúl) were born. In 1918, at around seven years of age, Arsenio was blinded when a horse kicked him in the head after he accidentally hit the animal with a broom. This tragic event prompted Arsenio to become very close with his brother Kike, and to become interested in writing and performing songs.

The young brothers began playing the &quot;tumbadora&quot; at rumba performances in Matanzas and Güines, and became also immersed in the traditions of Palo Monte and its secular counterpart, yuka. Furthermore, their neighbour in the neighbourhood of Leguina, Güines, was a Santería practitioner who hosted celebrations for Changó, exposing Arsenio and Kike to West African drumming and chanting. In rural parties such as &quot;guateques&quot;, they also learned the son, a genre of music that originated in the eastern region of the island. Arsenio learned how to play the marímbula and the botija, two rudimentary instruments used in the rhythm section, and more importantly he took up the tres, a small guitar, now considered Cuba&#x27;s national instrument. He received classes from Víctor González, a renowned &quot;tresero&quot; from Güines.

Following the destruction of their home by a Category 4 hurricane in 1926, Arsenio and his family moved from Güines to Havana, where he started playing in local groups around Marianao (his older brother Julio had already been living and working there). By 1928 he had formed the Septeto Boston which often performed in third-tier, working-class cabarets in the area. His father died in 1933 and sometime in the early 1930s, Arsenio changed his stage name from Travieso (which means &quot;mischievous&quot; or &quot;naughty&quot;) to his mother&#x27;s maiden name, Rodríguez, a fairly common Spanish surname. After dissolving the unsuccessful Septeto Boston in 1934, Rodríguez joined the Septeto Bellamar, directed by his uncle-in-law José Interián and featuring his cousin Elizardo Scull on vocals. The group often played at dance academies such as Sport Antillano.

===Rise to fame===
By 1938, Rodríguez was the &quot;de facto&quot; musical director of the Septeto Bellamar and his name had become familiar to important figures such as Antonio Arcaño and Miguelito Valdés. His acquaintance with the latter made it possible for one of his songs, &quot;Bruca maniguá&quot;, to be recorded by the famous Orquesta Casino de la Playa in June 1937. The song, featuring Valdés on vocals, became an international hit and Rodríguez&#x27;s breakthrough composition. The band also recorded Rodríguez&#x27;s &quot;Ben acá Tomá&quot; in the same recording session, becoming their next A-side. In 1938 they recorded &quot;Yo son macuá&quot;, &quot;Funfuñando&quot; (also a hit) and &quot;Se va el caramelero&quot;, which included Rodríguez&#x27;s first recorded performance, a remarkable solo on the tres.

In 1940, on the wave of his success with Casino de la Playa, Rodríguez formed his own &quot;conjunto&quot;, which featured three singers (playing claves, maracas and guitar), two trumpets, tres, piano, bass, tumbadora and bongo. At the time, only two other &quot;conjuntos&quot; existed: Conjunto Casino and Alberto Ruiz&#x27;s Conjunto Kubavana. This type of ensemble would replace the former &quot;septetos&quot;, although some such as the Septeto Nacional would perform on and off for years. Of all the conjuntos, Arsenio Rodríguez&#x27;s became the most successful and critically acclaimed one during the 1940s. His popularity earned him the nickname &quot;El Ciego Maravilloso&quot; (The Blind Marvel). The first single by his conjunto was &quot;El pirulero no vuelve más&quot;, a pregón which tried to capitalize on the success of &quot;Se va el caramelero&quot;.

In 1947, Rodríguez went to New York for the first time. There, he hoped to get cured of his blindness but eye specialist Ramón Castroviejo was told that his optic nerves had been completely destroyed. This experience led him to compose the bolero &quot;La vida es un sueño&quot; (Life is a dream). He returned to New York in 1948 and 1950 before establishing himself in the city in 1952. He played with influential artists such as Chano Pozo, Machito, Dizzy Gillespie and Mario Bauzá. On March 18, 1952, Rodríguez made his final recordings with his band for RCA Victor in Cuba. He finally left Havana on March 22, 1952, having handed the direction of the conjunto to trumpeter Félix Chappottín. Chappottín and the other remaining members, including pianist Lilí Martínez and singer Miguelito Cuní, formed Conjunto Chappottín. He would return to Havana for the last time in 1956.

=== Later life and death ===
During the 1960s, the mambo craze petered out, and Rodríguez continued to play in his typical style, although he did record some boogaloo numbers, without much success. As times changed, the popularity of his group declined. He tried a new start in Los Angeles. He invited his friend Alfonso Joseph to fly out to Los Angeles with him but died there only a week later, on December 30, 1970, from pneumonia. His body was returned for burial to New York. There is much speculation about his financial status during his last years, but Mario Bauzá denied that he died in poverty, arguing that Rodríguez had a modest income from royalties.

== Innovations ==
Rodríguez&#x27;s chief innovation, his interpretation of the son montuno, established the basic template for Cuban popular dance music and salsa that continues to this day. &quot;It took fifty years for Latin music to catch up with what Arsenio was doing in the 1940s&quot;—Kevin Moore (2007: web).

===Clave-based structure and offbeat emphasis===
The decades of the 1920s and 1930s were a period which produced some of the most beautiful and memorable melodies of the son genre. At the same time, the rhythmic component had become increasingly deemphasized, or in the opinion of some, &quot;watered-down&quot;. Rodríguez brought a strong rhythmic emphasis back into the son. His compositions are clearly based on the key pattern known in Cuba as &quot;clave&quot;, a Spanish word for &#x27;key&#x27;, or &#x27;code&#x27;. 
When clave is written in two measures, as shown above, the measure with three strokes is referred to as the &quot;three-side,&quot; and the measure with two strokes—the &quot;two-side.&quot; When the chord progression begins on the three-side, the song, or phrase is said to be in 3-2 clave. When it begins on the two-side, it&#x27;s in 2-3 clave. The 2-3 bass line of &quot;Dame un cachito pa&#x27; huele&quot; (1946) coincides with the three-side of the clave&#x27;s five-note pattern.
David García identifies the accents of &quot;and-of-two&quot; (in cut-time) on the three-side, and the &quot;and-of-four&quot; (in cut-time) on the two-side of the clave, as crucial contributions of Rodríguez&#x27;s music. The two offbeats are present in the following 2-3 bass line from Rodríguez&#x27;s &quot;Mi chinita me botó&quot; (1944).

Moore points out that Rodríguez&#x27;s conjunto introduced the two-celled bass tumbaos, that moved beyond the simpler, single-cell tresillo structure. This type of bass line has a specific alignment to clave, and contributes melodically to the composition. Rodríguez&#x27;s brother Raúl Travieso recounted, Rodríguez insisted that his bass players make the bass &quot;sing.&quot; Moore states: &quot;This idea of a bass tumbao with a melodic identity unique to a specific arrangement was critical not only to timba, but also to Motown, rock, funk, and other important genres.&quot; In other words, Rodríguez is a creator of the bass riff.

Breaks (&#x27;cierres&#x27;)

Rodríguez&#x27;s &quot;Juventud amaliana&quot; (1946) contains an example of one of his rhythmically dynamic unison breaks, strongly rooted in clave.

Moore is referring to the second and third measures of the break in the previous example. Here is that figure in relation to 2-3 clave. When the pattern is used as a type of block chord guajeo, as in &quot;Oye Como Va&quot;, it&#x27;s referred to as &quot;ponchando&quot;.
===Layered guajeos===
Rodríguez introduced the idea of layered guajeos (typical Cuban ostinato melodies)—an interlocking structure consisting of multiple contrapuntal parts. This aspect of the son&#x27;s modernization can be thought of as a matter of &quot;re-Africanizing&quot; the music. Helio Orovio recalls: &quot;Arsenio once said his trumpets played figurations the &#x27;Oriente&#x27; tres-guitarists played during the improvisational part of el son&quot; (1992: 11). Oriente is the easternmost province of Cuba, where the son was born. It is common practice for treseros to play a series of guajeo variations during their solos. Perhaps it was only natural then that it was Rodríguez, the tres master, who conceived of the idea of layering these variations on top of each other. The following example is from the &quot;diablo&quot; section of Rodríguez&#x27;s &quot;Kila, Quique y Chocolate&quot; (1950). The excerpt consists of four interlocking guajeos: piano (bottom line), tres (second line), 2nd and 3rd trumpets (third line), and 1st trumpet (fourth line). 2-3 Clave is shown for reference (top line). Notice that the piano plays a single celled (single measure) guajeo, while the other guajeos are two-celled. It&#x27;s common practice to combine single and double-celled ostinatos in Afro-Cuban music.

===Expansion of the son conjunto===
The denser rhythmic weave of Rodríguez&#x27;s music required the addition of more instruments. Rodríguez added a second, and then, third trumpet—the birth of the Latin horn section. He made the bold move of adding the conga drum, the quintessential Afro-Cuban instrument. Today, we are so used to seeing conga drums in Latin bands, and that practice began with Rodríguez. His bongo player used a large, hand-held cencerro (&#x27;cowbell&#x27;) during montunos (call-and-response chorus sections). Rodríguez also added a variety of rhythms and harmonic concepts to enrich the son, the bolero, the guaracha and some fusions, such as the bolero-son. Similar changes had been made somewhat earlier by the Lecuona Cuban Boys, who (because they were mainly a touring band) had less influence in Cuba. The overall &#x27;feel&#x27; of the Rodríguez conjunto was more African than other Cuban conjuntos.

===Piano guajeos===
Rodríguez took the pivotal step of replacing the guitar with the piano, which greatly expanded the contrapuntal and harmonic possibilities of Cuban popular music.

The piano guajeo for &quot;Dame un cachito pa&#x27; huele&quot; (1946) completely departs from both the generic son guajeo and the song&#x27;s melody. The pattern marks the clave by accenting the backbeat on the two-side. Moore observes: &quot;Like so many aspects of Arsenio&#x27;s music, this miniature composition is decades ahead of its time. It would be forty years before groups began to consistently apply this much creative variation at the guajeo level of the arranging process&quot; (2009: 41).

The piano guajeo for &quot;Jumba&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Zumba&quot;) (1951) is firmly aligned with clave, but also has a very strong nengón flavor — something which had rarely, or never, been used in Havana popular music. While Rodríguez was not from Oriente province (where nengón and changüí are played), he had a thorough knowledge of many folkloric styles and his creative partner, the pianist/composer Luis &quot;Lilí&quot; Martínez Griñán, in fact came from that part of the island.

===Diablo, the proto-mambo?===
Leonardo Acosta is not convinced by Rodríguez&#x27;s claim to have invented the mambo, if by &quot;mambo&quot; Rodríguez meant the big-band arrangements of Dámaso Pérez Prado. Rodríguez was not an arranger: his lyrics and musical ideas were worked over by the group&#x27;s arranger. The compositions were published with just the minimal bass and treble piano lines. To achieve the big-band mambo such as by Pérez Prado, Machito, Tito Puente or Tito Rodríguez requires a full orchestration where the trumpets play counterpoint to the rhythm of the saxophones. This, a fusion of Cuban with big-band jazz ideas, is not found in Rodríguez, whose musical forms are set in the traditional categories of Cuban music.

While it is true that the mambo of the 1940s, and 1950s contains elements not present in Rodríguez&#x27;s music, there is considerable evidence that the contrapuntal structure of the mambo began in the conjunto of Arsenio Rodríguez. While working in the charanga Arcaño y Sus Maravillas, Orestes López &quot;Macho&quot; and his brother Israel López &quot;Cachao&quot; composed &quot;Mambo&quot; (1938), the first piece to use the term. A prevalent theory is that the López brothers were influenced by Rodríguez&#x27;s use of layered guajeos (called &quot;diablo&quot;), and introduced the concept into the charanga&#x27;s string section with their historical composition.

As Ned Sublette observes: &quot;Arsenio maintained till the end of his life that the mambo — the big band style that exploded in 1949 — came out of his diablo, the repeating figures that the trumpets in the band played. Arsenio claimed to have already been doing that in the late 1930s&quot; (2004: 508). As Rodríguez himself asserts: &quot;In 1934, I was experimenting with a new sound which I fully developed in 1938.&quot; Max Salazar concurs: &quot;It was Arsenio Rodríguez&#x27;s band that used for the first time the rhythms which today are typical for every mambo&quot; (1992: 10). In an early article on mambo, published in 1948, the writer Manuel Cuéllar Vizcaíno suggests that Rodríguez and Arcaño&#x27;s styles emerged concurrently, which might account for the decades-long argument concerning the identity of the &quot;true&quot; inventor of the mambo. In the late 1940s Pérez Prado codified the contrapuntal structure of the mambo within a horn-based big band format.

== Style ==
Rodríguez&#x27;s style was characterized by a strong Afro-Cuban basis, his son compositions being much more &quot;africanized&quot; than those by his contemporaries. This emphasis is observed in the high number of rumba and afro numbers in his catalogue, most notably his first famous composition, &quot;Bruca maniguá&quot;. This is also exemplified by the inclusion of musical and linguistic elements from Abakuá, Lucumí (Santería), and Palo Monte traditions into his music.

On &quot;Palo Congo&quot; by Sabú Martínez (1957) Rodríguez sings and plays a traditional palo song and rhythm, a Lucumí song for Eleggua, and a rumba and a conga de comparsa accompanied by tres. Rodríguez&#x27;s 1963 landmark album &quot;Quindembo&quot; features an abakuá tune, a , and several band adaptations of traditional palo songs, accompanied by the bona fide rhythms.

Rodríguez was an authentic rumbero; he both played the tumbadora and composed songs within the rumba genre, especially guaguancós. Rodríguez recorded folkloric rumbas and also fused rumba with son montuno. His &quot;Timbilla&quot; (1945) and &quot;Anabacoa&quot; (1950) are examples of the guaguancó rhythm used by a son conjunto. On &quot;Timbilla&quot;, the bongós fulfill the role of the quinto (lead drum). In &quot;Yambú en serenata&quot; (1964) a yambú using a quinto is augmented by a tres, bass, and horns.

In 1956, Rodríguez released the folkloric rumbas &quot;Con flores del matadero&quot; and &quot;Adiós Roncona&quot; in Havana. The tracks consist of voice and percussion only. One of the last recordings Rodríguez performed on was the rumba album &quot;Patato y Totico&quot; by the conguero Carlos &quot;Patato&quot; Valdés and vocalist Eugenio &quot;Totico&quot; Arango (1967). The tracks are purely folkloric, except for the unconventional addition of Rodríguez on tres and Israel López &quot;Cachao&quot; on bass. Additional personnel included Papaíto and Virgilio Martí. Also released in the 1960s, the album &quot;Primitivo&quot;, featuring Monguito el Único and Baby González alternating on lead vocals, is an evocation of the music played in the &quot;solares&quot;.

== Tributes ==
There have been numerous tributes to Arsenio Rodríguez, especially in the form of LPs. In 1972, Larry Harlow recorded &quot;Tribute to Arsenio Rodríguez&quot; (Fania 404) with his band Orchestra Harlow. On this LP, five of the numbers had been recorded earlier by Rodríguez&#x27; conjunto. In 1994, the Cuban revivalist band Sierra Maestra recorded &quot;Dundunbanza!&quot; (World Circuit WCD 041), an album containing four Rodríguez numbers, including the title track.

Arsenio Rodríguez is mentioned in a national television production called &quot;La época&quot;, about the Palladium era in New York, and Afro-Cuban music. The film discusses Arsenio&#x27;s contributions, and features some of the musicians he recorded with. Others interviewed in the movie include the daughter of legendary Cuban percussionist Mongo Santamaría – Ileana Santamaría, bongocero Luis Mangual and others.

Rodríguez&#x27;s close friend and bassist for eight years Alfonso &quot;El Panameño&quot; Joseph, as well as other members of Rodríguez&#x27;s band, such as Julián Lianos, who performed with Rodríguez at the Palladium Ballroom in New York during the 1960s, have had their legacies documented in a national television production called &quot;La Época&quot;, released in theaters in the US in September 2008, and in Latin America in 2009. He had much success in the US and migrated there in 1952, one of the reasons being the better pay of musicians.

Starting in the late 1990s, jazz guitarist Marc Ribot recorded two albums mostly of Rodríguez&#x27; compositions or songs in his repertoire:&quot;Marc Ribot y los Cubanos Postizos&quot; (or &quot;Marc Ribot and the Prosthetic/Fake Cubans&quot;) and &quot;Muy Divertido!&quot;. In 1999, Rodríguez was posthumously inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame.

Belatedly, the borough of the Bronx officially had the intersection of Intervale Ave. and Dawson St. in the area known as Longwood renamed &quot;Arsenio Rodríguez Way&quot; in a dedication and unveiling ceremony on Thursday, June 6, 2013.

&quot;That intersection was the center of his universe,&quot; said José Rafael Méndez, a community historian. &quot;He lived in that area. And all the clubs he played, like the Hunts Point Palace, were practically a stone&#x27;s throw away.&quot;

The street designation serves as the crowning jewel after an arduous series of collaborative efforts and events produced last year that rendered tribute to the band leader and resident performer of the Longwood community.

<doc id="355977" wikidata="Q160103" url="?curid=355977" title="Travis (band)">
<text>Travis are a Scottish rock band formed in Glasgow in 1990, and composed of Fran Healy (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Dougie Payne (bass guitar, backing vocals), Andy Dunlop (lead guitar, banjo, backing vocals), and Neil Primrose (drums, percussion). The band&#x27;s name comes from the character Travis Henderson (played by Harry Dean Stanton) from the film &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; (1984). The band released their debut album, &quot;Good Feeling&quot; (1997), to moderate success where it debuted at number nine on the UK Albums Chart and was later awarded a silver certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in January 2000.

The band gained greater success with their second album, &quot;The Man Who&quot; (1999), which spent nine weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart, totalling 134 weeks in the top 100 of the chart. In 2003, &quot;The Man Who&quot; was certified 9× platinum by the BPI, which represented sales of over 2.68 million in the UK alone. Following this success, the band released their third album, &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; (2001). It matched the success of &quot;The Man Who&quot;, debuting atop the UK Albums Chart as well as peaking at thirty-nine on the US &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. A year following the release of &quot;The Invisible Band&quot;, the BPI awarded Travis with a 4× platinum certification for the album. Subsequent releases, &quot;12 Memories&quot; (2003), &quot;The Boy with No Name&quot; (2007), &quot;Ode to J. Smith&quot; (2008), &quot;Where You Stand&quot; (2013), &quot;Everything at Once&quot; (2016), &quot;10 Songs&quot; (2020), and &quot;L.A. Times&quot; (2024), also achieved commercial success. In 2004, the band released their first greatest hits album, &quot;Singles&quot;.

Travis have twice been awarded best band at the Brit Awards and were awarded the NME Artist of the Year award at that website&#x27;s 2000 ceremony, and in 2016 were honoured at the Scottish Music Awards for their outstanding contribution to music.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1989–1993)===
Both Fran Healy and Andy Dunlop went to the Glasgow School of Art from 1989 to 1991. A 16 year old Healy played in front of a crowd for the first time in 1989 at Holyrood Secondary School when he was in 5th year. The band that would become Travis was formed by brothers Chris Martyn (bass) and Geoff Martyn (keyboards) along with Simon Jarvis (drums). Andy Dunlop, a school friend at Lenzie Academy, was drafted in on guitar. The line-up was completed by a female vocalist, Catherine Maxwell, and the band&#x27;s name became &quot;Glass Onion&quot;, after the Beatles&#x27; song of the same name. Neil Primrose then joined to replace drummer Jarvis. Parting company with their singer in the spring of 1991, they auditioned for a new vocalist. Having met each other through Primrose pouring him a pint, an untrained art student, Fran Healy, joined after being invited to audition by Primrose. Healy joined the band on the day he enrolled at the Glasgow School of Art in the autumn of 1991. Two years later, with the option of playing music holding more appeal, Healy dropped out of art school and, inspired by songwriters such as Joni Mitchell, assumed songwriting responsibilities. With brothers Chris and Geoff Martyn on bass and keyboards, in 1993, the five-some released a privately made CD, &quot;The Glass Onion EP&quot;, featuring the tracks &quot;Dream On&quot;, &quot;The Day Before&quot;, &quot;Free Soul&quot;, and &quot;Whenever She Comes Round&quot;. 500 copies of the EP were made and were recently valued at £1000 each. Other songs they recorded, but were left off the CD, are &quot;She&#x27;s So Strange&quot; and &quot;Not About to Change&quot;.

The band won a talent contest organised by the Music in Scotland Trust, which promised £2,000 so that Travis could deal-hunt at a new music seminar in New York. Two weeks before they were due to leave, however, the prize was instead given to the Music in Scotland Trust Directory. According to their publisher, Charlie Pinder: &quot;They were a band that everyone in the A&amp;R community knew about and would go and see every now and then. But they weren&#x27;t very good. They had quite good songs; Fran always did write good songs.&quot; While on a visit to Scotland, American engineer and producer Niko Bolas, a long-time Neil Young and Rolling Stones associate, tuned into a Travis session on Radio Scotland, and heard something in the band&#x27;s music which instantly made him travel to Perth to see them. Healy said: &quot;He told us we were shit, took us in the studio for four days, and taught us how to play properly, like a band. He was ballsy, rude, and New York pushy. He didn&#x27;t believe my lyrics and told me to write what I believed in and not tell lies. He was Mary Poppins, he sorted us out.&quot; The band recorded a five-song demo, which included the song &quot;All I Want to Do Is Rock&quot;.

===Changes and debut album (1994–1997)===
Having failed to achieve breakthrough success in the United Kingdom, the band relocated to New York, as they believed that the American music market might be more suited to their style of music. Before heading to New York, Healy suggested that the band should send a demo to Charlie Pinder of Sony Music Publishing, whom they had known for a few years and regularly sent songs to, saying: &quot;If he&#x27;s not into it, then we&#x27;ll [leave].&quot; Pinder was immediately impressed by the song &quot;All I Want to Do is Rock&quot;, which he felt was a dramatic change for the band: &quot;It was harder, more exciting, sexy; all things that they never really were. They [had] turned a corner.&quot; After performing a secret gig for Pinder and his boss at Sony, Blair McDonald, they were signed to Sony Music Publishing. The immediate impact was that the founding member and keyboard player Geoff Martyn was removed while the bassist, his brother Chris, was replaced with Healy&#x27;s best friend Dougie Payne. The band was moved to London where they were given a rehearsal room and a house.

Payne, who had not played bass guitar before, joined the band in 1994 after having completed a crash course of a couple of weeks. Payne played with the new line-up for the first time in a free space above The Horse Shoe Bar in Glasgow.

Once set up in London, the band spent between nine months and a year recording new songs. They played their first London show at the Dublin Castle in Camden. With around twenty good songs ready, they then approached managers Colin Lester and Ian McAndrew of Wildlife Entertainment who then introduced the band to Andy MacDonald, owner of Go! Discs Records and founder of Independiente Records.

===Mainstream success (1998–2001)===
Travis&#x27;s second album, 1999&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who&quot;, was produced by Nigel Godrich and partially recorded at producer Mike Hedges&#x27;s chateau in France. The band continued recording at, among other studios, Abbey Road Studios in London. The title &quot;The Man Who&quot; is derived from the book &quot;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&quot; (1985) by neurologist Oliver Sacks. The album&#x27;s sleeve notes include a dedication to film director Stanley Kubrick, who had died a few months prior to the album&#x27;s release.

Shortly after release, &quot;The Man Who&quot; initially looked as though it would mirror the release of &quot;Good Feeling&quot;. Although it entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 7, with little radio play of its singles, it quickly slipped down. Worse, many critics who had raved about the rocky &quot;Good Feeling&quot; criticised the album for the band&#x27;s move into more melodic, melancholic material. &quot;NME&quot; commented on the release of the album: &quot;Travis will be best when they stop trying to make sad, classic records&quot;.

Increased radio airplay of the single &quot;Why Does It Always Rain on Me?&quot; raised awareness of the band and resulted in &quot;The Man Who&quot; gaining in the charts. &quot;Why Does It Always Rain on Me?&quot; became a commercial success for the band, reaching number one on the UK Rock &amp; Metal Singles Charts, number four in their native Scotland, number ten in the United Kingdom, and the top twenty in Australia, Finland, and New Zealand. , according to Concord Music, &quot;The Man Who&quot; has sold over 3.5 million copies worldwide. It was among ten albums nominated for the best British album of the previous 30 years by the Brit Awards in 2010, losing to &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; by Oasis. Travis followed the release of &quot;The Man Who&quot; with an extensive 237-concert world tour, including headlining the 2000 Glastonbury, T in the Park, and V festivals, and a US tour leg with Oasis.

The title of Travis&#x27;s following album, 2001&#x27;s &quot;The Invisible Band&quot;, again produced by Nigel Godrich, reflects the band&#x27;s genuine belief that their music is more important than the group behind it. Recorded at Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles, and featuring such songs as &quot;Sing&quot; (the most played song on British radio that summer), &quot;Side&quot;, the McCartneyesque &quot;Flowers in the Window&quot;, &quot;Indefinitely&quot;, &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot;, and &quot;The Cage&quot;, the album made No. 1 on the UK chart and generally received widespread critical acclaim, with the band again taking Best British Band at the annual Brit Awards. It also received &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;″ Album of the Year. The album also had an impact across the Atlantic, the popularity in the US of the single &quot;Coming Around&quot;, a non-album track with Byrdsesque harmonies and 12-string guitar, enhancing this.

===Primrose&#x27;s accident and change in direction (2002–2006)===
In 2002, drummer Neil Primrose suffered a serious injury after he dived head-first into a shallow swimming pool while on tour in France, just after a concert at the Eurockéennes festival. Breaking his neck, he almost died due to spinal damage. If not for his road crew, he also would have drowned. Despite the severity of the accident, Primrose has since made a full recovery.

With Primrose having recovered, Travis regrouped and re-evaluated. Moving into a cottage in Crear, Argyll and Bute, they set up a small studio, and over two weeks came up with nine new songs that would form the basis of their fourth studio album, 2003&#x27;s &quot;12 Memories&quot;. Produced by Travis themselves, Tchad Blake, and Steve Orchard, the album marked a move into more organic, moody, and political territory for the band. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Re-Offender&quot; was a commercial success for the band, reaching number seven in both Scotland and the United Kingdom. &quot;12 Memories&quot; was also a commercial success, reaching number three in the United Kingdom and forty one in the United States.

In 2004, Travis embarked on a highly successful tour of Canada, the US, and Europe (supported by Keane in the UK), and in November 2004 the band released a successful compilation of their singles, &quot;Singles&quot;, as well as the new tracks, &quot;Walking in the Sun&quot; and &quot;The Distance&quot; (written by Dougie Payne).

On 2 July 2005, Travis performed at Live 8&#x27;s London concert, and four days later at the Edinburgh 50,000 – The Final Push concert. Travis also participated in Band Aid 20&#x27;s re-recording of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;—Healy and friend Nigel Godrich playing leading roles in its organisation.

===Artistic re-evaluation (2007–2009)===
Travis released a fifth studio album, &quot;The Boy with No Name&quot;, on 7 May 2007. Nigel Godrich was the album&#x27;s executive producer, while Mike Hedges and Brian Eno were also involved. The album is named after Healy&#x27;s son, Clay, whom Healy and his partner Nora were unable to name until four weeks after his birth. Healy has described the process of making the album as &quot;like coming out of the forest&quot;. Travis played at Coachella on 28 April 2007. At the Virgin Megastore tent in the festival, &quot;The Boy With No Name&quot; was available to purchase over a week early. Reviews of the album were mixed. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Closer&quot;, was released on 23 April 2007 and peaked at No. 10 on the UK singles chart. Two further singles were released from &quot;The Boy with No Name&quot; – &quot;Selfish Jean&quot; and &quot;My Eyes&quot;.

Following a brief tour of the United Kingdom, during which the band tested new material, they recorded their sixth album, in two weeks between February–March 2008, having been inspired by the speed and simplicity of their recent recording session with Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick while participating in a BBC programme celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album. It was announced around this time that the band and their long-term record label Independiente had split amicably.
In early June 2008, a vinyl EP of the song &quot;J. Smith&quot; was announced online as the first release from &quot;Ode to J. Smith&quot;, for 30 June. It was an EP limited to 1000 copies and not an &#x27;official&#x27; single; instead more of a taster of the album for fans. Fran Healy said, &quot;The album is called &quot;Ode to J. Smith&quot; partly giving a heads up to the key song and partly because all the songs are written about nameless characters or to nameless characters.&quot; He has also described the album as a novel with 12 chapters, with each chapter being a song.

The album would be released through their own record label, Red Telephone Box, with the lead single &quot;Something Anything&quot; being released on 15 September. Two weeks later, on 29 September, &quot;Ode to J. Smith&quot; was released. The band also headlined a 12-concert UK tour to coincide with the releases between 22 September and 8 October. Early reviews were very positive, with some calling it Travis&#x27;s best record ever.
 The second single released from &quot;Ode To J. Smith&quot; was &quot;Song to Self&quot;, on 5 January 2009.
===&quot;Where You Stand&quot; (2010–2013)===
A live acoustic album featuring Healy and Dunlop was released on 19 January 2010. In 2011, Travis returned to live performances. They played at the Maxidrom Festival in Moscow, in May; at G! festival, Faroe Island, and the Rock&#x27;n Coke Festival in Istanbul, Turkey, in July. On 31 October, Fran Healy performed a concert in Berlin along with Keane&#x27;s Tim Rice-Oxley. Travis recorded songs for their next album at the end of September 2011, and they continued writing new songs in February 2012 with Tim Rice–Oxley of Keane, in both Berlin and London.

A pre single teaser track called &quot;Another Guy&quot;, from the band&#x27;s forthcoming seventh album, was released as a free download from the band&#x27;s official website on 20 March 2013. On 25 April 2013, they revealed that the new album &quot;Where You Stand&quot; would be released on 19 August 2013 via Kobalt Label Services, and that the first eponymous single &quot;Where You Stand&quot; would be released on 30 April.

===&quot;Everything at Once&quot; and &quot;Almost Fashionable&quot; (2013–2016)===
A post from Travis on their Instagram page confirmed that recording had commenced on the band&#x27;s eighth album at Hansa Tonstudio in Berlin in January 2015. On 25 November 2015, Travis shared a free-download single &quot;Everything at Once&quot; and announced two UK live shows for January 2016. A new album, also titled &quot;Everything at Once&quot;, was released on 29 April 2016. In 2016, at the 18th annual Scottish Music Awards, Travis were presented with an award for their outstanding contribution to music.

Travis&#x27;s June 2016 tour of Mexico formed the backdrop for &quot;Almost Fashionable: A Film About Travis&quot;, a documentary directed by Healy. The film stars Wyndham Wallace, a music journalist and acquaintance of Healy&#x27;s in Berlin, who was invited to travel with Travis to Mexico because he had previously expressed his distaste for the band. The film had its premiere in 2018 at the 72nd Edinburgh International Film Festival, where it won the Audience Award.

===&quot;10 Songs&quot; (2017–2024)===
In 2017, Travis celebrated the 20th anniversary of their debut 1997 album &quot;Good Feeling&quot; and the 18th anniversary of their seminal 1999 album &quot;The Man Who&quot;. As part of the occasion, the band re-released the album &quot;The Man Who&quot; as a limited edition box set. In September 2017, the band also performed the album in full at two shows in Manchester and London, followed by more full-album UK shows in June and December of the following year.

For the 20th anniversary of &quot;The Man Who&quot;, the band re-released the album reissue box set, along with the live album &quot;Live at Glastonbury &#x27;99&quot;, a recording of the set that is credited to be &quot;a pivotal moment in kickstarting Travis&#x27;s commercial success&quot;, this being despite the band members feeling that they had performed poorly when they originally performed at Glastonbury in 1999.

On 10 December 2019, Travis released &quot;Kissing in the Wind&quot;, a song from their upcoming new album, a song that had previously been included in their 2018 documentary &quot;Almost Fashionable: A Film About Travis&quot;. Another single, &quot;A Ghost&quot;, was released on 3 June 2020, along with details of the band&#x27;s upcoming ninth studio album &quot;10 Songs&quot;, released on 9 October of the same year. As a result of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the band were unable to schedule a tour to promote the release of &quot;10 Songs&quot;; however, when restrictions were lifted, they rarely played any of the tracks from the album live.

On 17 July 2022, the group supported Gerry Cinnamon at his concert at Hampden Park in Glasgow.

===&quot;L.A. Times&quot; (2024–present)===
On 20 March 2024, Travis debuted the singles &quot;Gaslight&quot; and &quot;Bus&quot;, and announced their tenth studio album, &quot;L.A. Times&quot;, which was released on 12 July 2024. The album was produced by Tony Hoffer and written by Fran Healy in his studio on the edge of Skid Row, Los Angeles. The cover of the album is a photograph of the band in Los Angeles taken by Stefan Ruiz, who also took photographs for the covers of the previous albums &quot;The Man Who&quot;, &quot;The Invisible Band&quot;, and &quot;The Boy with No Name&quot;.

The band also announced they would be supporting the Killers on their seventeen-concert Ireland and UK tour in mid-2024.

The band have played with a number of other artists, including Paul McCartney, Graham Nash, Noel Gallagher, and Jason Falkner. Travis guest-starred on Feeder&#x27;s &quot;Tumble and Fall&quot;, performing backing vocals at the end of the song. This, because Feeder were recording their album &quot;Pushing the Senses&quot; and Travis were in the next studio.

An adaptation of the Oasis song &quot;Half the World Away&quot;, as performed by Healy, was used as the intro music for a sketch in &quot;The Adam and Joe Show&quot; entitled &quot;The Imperial Family&quot;. The sketch itself was a parody of &quot;The Royle Family&quot; (to which the Oasis song lends itself as the theme music).

In June 2007, Travis participated in BBC Radio 2&#x27;s project to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. All the album&#x27;s tracks were re-recorded by contemporary artists, supervised by the original engineer, Geoff Emerick, using the same four-track studio equipment. Travis contributed a rendition of &quot;Lovely Rita&quot;. The band wanted to be as faithful to the original as possible, even to the extent of recording the guitars in the stairwell of Abbey Road Studios to recreate the acoustics.

In 2010, Travis contributed a live version of their song &quot;Before You Were Young&quot; to the Enough Project and Downtown Records&#x27; &quot;Raise Hope for Congo&quot; compilation. Proceeds from the compilation fund efforts to make the protection and empowerment of Congo&#x27;s women a priority, as well as inspire individuals around the world to raise their voice for peace in the Congo.

Healy released his first solo album, entitled &quot;Wreckorder&quot;, in October 2010. Recorded in Berlin, New York, and Vermont, and produced by Emery Dobyns (Patti Smith, Noah and the Whale), the album features Paul McCartney, Neko Case, and Noah and the Whale&#x27;s Tom Hobden.

<doc id="355981" wikidata="Q5021603" url="?curid=355981" title="Call and response">
<text>Call and response is a form of interaction between a speaker and an audience in which the speaker&#x27;s statements (&quot;calls&quot;) are punctuated by responses from the listeners. This form is also used in music, where it falls under the general category of antiphony.

==African cultures==
In some African cultures, call-and-response is a widespread pattern of democratic participation—in public gatherings, in the discussion of civic affairs, in religious rituals, as well as in vocal and instrumental musical expression (see call and response in music). African bondsmen and bondswomen in the Americas continued this practice over the centuries in various forms of expression—in religious observance; public gatherings; even in children&#x27;s rhymes; and, most notably, in music in its multiple forms: blues, gospel, rhythm and blues, soul, jazz, hip-hop and go-go. Many work songs sung on plantations by enslaved men and women also incorporate the call and response format. African-American women work songs incorporate the call and response format, a format that fosters dialogue. In contemporary African-American worship services, where call and response is pervasive, a pastor will call out to his congregants to engage an enthusiastic response. For example &quot;Can I get an Amen?&quot; or &quot;Raise your hands and give Him praise!&quot; 

Call and response is derived from the historical African roots that served as the foundation for African American cultural traditions. The call and response format became a diasporic tradition, and it was part of Africans and African Americans creating a new, unique tradition in the United States. 

While slave masters encouraged conversion of slaves to Christianity, African slaves still practiced their own form of religious celebration, which was called Slave Christianity. But antiphony, a kind of call and response in Anglican worship, was also part of formal services in the South for centuries. African Americans put that tradition to their own use, as well as picking themes from Christianity that meant the most to them. It can be used throughout life.

== Exploring call and response in Black Girls Game Song ==
Black Girls Game Song is a form of musical expression and cultural tradition that emerged from the African diaspora and continues to evolve in modern society. 

Rooted in the experiences of Black girls and women, their game songs encompass a diverse range of practices, including hand clapping, cheers, double-dutch jump rope chants, and other forms of music making. In their playful pursuits, African-American girls demonstrate a fundamental complement of Black music-making: syncopated rhythms and intricate percussion ignite hand-clapping and foot stomping; call-and-response patterns that define the interplay of linguistic and musical doing between their voices and bodies during group play; and a strong emphasis on percussive elements permeates their singing or chanting. Through their playful activities, girls engage in a form of embodied storytelling. This play acts as a practice and performance, akin to mnemonic rituals, that contribute to the ongoing development of African American and Black musical identities. 

Furthermore, the characteristics of Black Girls Play can broaden the definition of how call-and-response can be expressed. This includes its manifestation across various mediums, such as linguistic, musical, verbal, nonverbal, and dance. This diverse range of expressions, empowered by Black Girls Play, provides the Black community with a potent avenue for voicing frustrations and embodies the enduring spirit of resistance and resilience in the face of historical and ongoing racial injustices.

<doc id="355985" wikidata="Q1713509" url="?curid=355985" title="June Movement">
<text>The June Movement () was a Danish left Eurosceptic political organisation founded 23 August 1992. It took its name from the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty that took place in Denmark in June of that year. The movement was a member of the European political party EUDemocrats - Alliance for a Europe of Democracies.

The June Movement acknowledged Denmark&#x27;s membership of the European Union, but opposed the process of tighter European integration including the Lisbon Treaty, and in general the movement wanted the EU to deal with only cross-border issues such as environmental and trade policies. The movement participated in elections for the European Parliament, but neither in local elections nor in elections for the Parliament of Denmark.

In 2009, the movement lost its representation in the European Parliament and disbanded on 5 September 2009.

==History==
The June Movement was founded at a conference at Christiansborg on 23 August 1992. Its immediate predecessors were Danmark 92 and a group of members of People&#x27;s Movement against the EU. The three original spokespersons were Drude Dahlerup and Niels I. Meyer (originally from the initiative Danmark 92) and Jens-Peter Bonde (originally from the People&#x27;s Movement against the EU).

===MEPs split from the People&#x27;s Movement===
At the end of 1992, three of the four representatives of the People&#x27;s Movement in the European Parliament (Jens-Peter Bonde, Birgit Bjørnvig og Ulla Sandbæk) decided to represent the June Movement for the rest of the election term. Besides members of Danmark 92 and the People&#x27;s Movement, the June Movement also attracted a significant number of members who previously had not been politically active and among established parties across the spectrum. The movement attracted activists from the now-defunct youth organization Unge Mod Unionen, including former candidates for the European Parliament and board members.

The movement recommended a &#x27;no&#x27; vote at the EU referendums in 1993, 1998 and 2000.

===1999–2008 representation===
Between 1999 and 2004, they held three of the sixteen Danish seats in the European Parliament. By the 2004 elections only one MEP, Jens-Peter Bonde, was re-elected.

The movement recommended rejecting the European constitution as it considered it to be undemocratic and as introducing too much central control. However, the European constitution was passed in the Danish Parliament without a referendum.

In May 2008, Jens-Peter Bonde resigned from the European Parliament, succeeded by Hanne Dahl. Bonde later stopped being a leading member of the June Movement, instead working as an adviser for the cross-European Libertas Party.

===2009 electoral defeat and dissolution===
On 7 June 2009, the June Movement was convincingly defeated in the Danish elections for the European Parliament, and the movement lost its seat. To run again, the movement needed to collect signatures from 80,000 voters, which it considered an impossible task. On the evening of the election, movement leader Keld Albrecthsen announced that the movement would disband, which it did on 5 September 2009.

==Policies==
The organisation claimed to be cross-spectrum and had active members from all political affiliations, however with emphasis on the centre-left. Its self-description notwithstanding, it was considered a left-wing party.

The June Movements did not want Denmark to leave the EU, but proposed a &quot;slimmer and better EU&quot;. In general the movement wanted the EU to deal with only cross-border issues such as environmental and trade policies. Nature sustainability, human and animal health should have higher priority than capital movements and free market issues. The movement demanded transparency and control of the EU&#x27;s use of money. It proposed a reversed form of the EU&#x27;s principle of subsidiarity, meaning that it wanted the EU to handle issues only when ordered to do so by the member countries. The movement also wanted the EU to skip interference into areas which were covered by other international organisations, such as human rights, defence and security politics.

One proposal for democratic reform of the EU was to let the European commissioners be elected nationally, by the electorate. This was meant to offer more debate on EU legislation as well as to bring in more democracy to the EU.

The movement was strongly against the Lisbon Treaty, and former MEP Jens-Peter Bonde was known as an outspoken 
critic of the treaty in the European Parliament.

==Organisation==
The organisation was run by a board, elected by participants of the annual general meeting. The board had to have a certain minimum membership of both genders. The last board included MEP Hanne Dahl as well as chairman Keld Albrechtsen among others.

===Symbol===
The symbol of the movement was the strawberry, which in Denmark is typically associated with summer and the month of June.

===European relations===
Traditionally, the June Movement had relations with political organisations proposing democratisation of the EU in most EU countries, as well as in non-member states. It had a Swedish sister party, the Junilistan, which also lost its seats in the European Parliament in 2009. Slovenia is the third EU country home to a June Movement; although this party did not run in the 2004 elections, it planned to do so in 2009. The Slovenians use the same symbols as the Danish movement. The June Movements of these various countries are all members of the EUDemocrats.

In the European Parliament, the June Movement participated in the Independence/Democracy group. In 2005, some prominent members of the June Movement decided to leave the organisation because they disagreed with certain conservative or traditionalist parties which participated in the Independence and Democracy group. Since then, the Lega Nord and most MEPs of the League of Polish Families also left the Independence/Democracy group. The group did not survive the 2009 elections.

<text>Nudibranchs () belong to the order Nudibranchia, a group of soft-bodied marine gastropod molluscs that shed their shells after their larval stage. They are noted for their often extraordinary colours and striking forms, and they have been given colourful nicknames to match, such as &quot;clown&quot;, &quot;marigold&quot;, &quot;splendid&quot;, &quot;dancer&quot;, &quot;dragon&quot;, and &quot;sea rabbit&quot;. Currently, about 3,000 valid species of nudibranchs are known.

The word &quot;nudibranch&quot; comes from the Latin &#x27;naked&#x27; and the Ancient Greek () &#x27;gills&#x27;.

Nudibranchs are often casually called sea slugs, as they are a family of opisthobranchs (sea slugs), within the phylum Mollusca (molluscs), but many sea slugs belong to several taxonomic groups that are not closely related to nudibranchs. A number of these other sea slugs, such as the photosynthetic &quot;Sacoglossa&quot; and the colourful Aglajidae, are often confused with nudibranchs.

==Distribution and habitat==

Nudibranchs occur in seas worldwide, ranging from the Arctic, through temperate and tropical regions, to the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. They are almost entirely restricted to salt water, although a few species are known to inhabit lower salinities in brackish water.

Nudibranchs live at virtually all depths, from the intertidal zone to depths well over . The greatest diversity of nudibranchs is seen in warm, shallow reefs, although one nudibranch species was discovered at a depth near . This nudibranch, described in 2024 as &quot;Bathydevius&quot;, is the only known nudibranch with a bathypelagic lifestyle and is one of the very few to be bioluminescent.

Nudibranchs are benthic animals, found crawling over the substrate. The only exceptions to this are the neustonic &quot;Glaucus&quot; nudibranchs, which float upside down just under the ocean&#x27;s surface; the pelagic nudibranchs &quot;Cephalopyge trematoides&quot;, which swim in the water column; the two pelagic species of &quot;Phylliroe&quot;, and the evolutionarily distinct, bathypelagic &quot;Bathydevius.&quot;

==Anatomical description==
The body forms of nudibranchs vary greatly. Because they are opisthobranchs, unlike most other gastropods, they are apparently bilaterally symmetrical externally (but not internally) because they have undergone secondary detorsion. In all nudibranchs, the male and female sexual openings are on the right side of the body, reflecting their asymmetrical origins. They lack a mantle cavity. Some species have venomous appendages (cerata) on their sides, which deter predators. Many also have a simple gut and a mouth with a radula.

The eyes in nudibranchs are simple and able to discern little more than light and dark. The eyes are set into the body, are about a quarter of a millimeter in diameter, and consist of a lens and five photoreceptors.

Nudibranchs vary in adult size from .

The adult form is without a shell or operculum (in shelled gastropods, the operculum is a bony or horny plate that can cover the opening of the shell when the body is withdrawn). In most species, there is a swimming veliger larva with a coiled shell, but the shell is shed at metamorphosis when the larva transforms into the adult form. Some species have direct development, and the shell is shed before the animal emerges from the egg mass.

The name &quot;nudibranch&quot; is appropriate, since the dorids (infraclass Anthobranchia) breathe through a &quot;naked gill&quot; shaped into branchial plumes in a rosette on their backs. By contrast, on the back of the aeolids in the clade Cladobranchia, brightly coloured sets of protruding organs called cerata are present.

Nudibranchs have cephalic (head) tentacles, which are sensitive to touch, taste, and smell. Club-shaped rhinophores detect odors.

==Defence mechanisms==
In the course of their evolution, nudibranchs have lost their shells, while developing alternative defence mechanisms. Some species evolved an external anatomy with textures and colours that mimicked surrounding sessile invertebrate animals (often their prey sponges or soft corals) to avoid predators with camouflage. Other nudibranchs, as seen especially well on &quot;Chromodoris&quot; &quot;quadricolor&quot;, have an intensely bright and contrasting colour pattern that makes them especially conspicuous in their surroundings. Nudibranch molluscs are the most commonly cited examples of aposematism in marine ecosystems, but the evidence for this has been contested, mostly because few examples of mimicry are seen among species, many species are nocturnal or cryptic, and bright colours at the red end of the spectrum are rapidly attenuated as a function of water depth. For example, the Spanish dancer nudibranch (genus &quot;Hexabranchus&quot;), among the largest of tropical marine slugs, potently chemically defended, and brilliantly red and white, is nocturnal and has no known mimics. Other studies of nudibranch molluscs have concluded they are aposematically coloured, for example, the slugs of the family Phylidiidae from Indo-Pacific coral reefs.

Nudibranchs that feed on hydrozoids can store the hydrozoids&#x27; nematocysts (stinging cells) in the dorsal body wall, the cerata. These stolen nematocysts, called kleptocnidae, wander through the alimentary tract without harming the nudibranch. Once further into the organ, the cells are assimilated by intestinal protuberances and brought to specific placements on the creature&#x27;s hind body. The specific mechanism by which nudibranchs protect themselves from the hydrozoids and their nematocysts is yet unknown, but special cells with large vacuoles probably play an important role. Similarly, some nudibranchs can also take in plant cells (symbiotic algae from soft corals) and reuse these to make food for themselves. The related group of sacoglossan sea slugs feed on algae and retain just the chloroplasts for their own photosynthetic use, a process known as kleptoplasty. Some of these species have been observed practising autotomy, severing portions of their body to remove parasites, and have been observed to regrow their head if decapitated.

Nudibranchs use a variety of chemical defences to aid in protection, but the strategy need not be lethal to be effective; in fact, good arguments exist that chemical defences should evolve to be distasteful rather than toxic. Some sponge-eating nudibranchs concentrate the chemical defences from their prey sponge in their bodies, rendering themselves distasteful to predators. One method of chemical defense used by nudibranchs are secondary metabolites, which play an important role in mediating relationships among marine communities. The evidence that suggests the chemical compounds used by dorid nudibranchs do in fact come from dietary sponges lies in the similarities between the metabolites of prey and nudibranchs, respectively. Furthermore, nudibranchs contain a mixture of sponge chemicals when they are in the presence of multiple food sources, as well as change defence chemicals with a concurrent change in diet. This, however, is not the only way for nudibranchs to develop chemical defences. Certain Antarctic marine species defense mechanisms are believed to be controlled by biological factors like predation, competition, and selective pressures. Certain species can produce their own chemicals &quot;de novo&quot; without dietary influence. Evidence for the different chemical production methods comes with the characteristic uniformity of chemical composition across drastically different environments and geographic locations found throughout &quot;de novo&quot; production species compared to the wide variety of dietary and environmentally dependent chemical composition in sequestering species.

Another protection method is releasing the ugdon acid from the skin. Once the specimen is physically irritated or touched by another creature, it will release the mucus automatically, eating the animal from the inside out.

===Apparent production of sound===
In 1884, Philip Henry Gosse reported observations by &quot;Professor Grant&quot; (possibly Robert Edmond Grant) that two species of nudibranchs emit sounds that are audible to humans.

Two very elegant species of Sea-slug, viz., &quot;Eolis punctata&quot; [i.e. &quot;Facelina annulicornis&quot;], and &quot;Tritonia arborescens&quot; [i.e. &quot;Dendronotus frondosus&quot;], certainly produce audible sounds. Professor Grant, who first observed the interesting fact in some specimens of the latter, which he was keeping in an aquarium, says of the sounds that &#x27;they resemble very much the clink of a steel wire on the side of the jar, one stroke only been given at a time, and repeated at intervals of a minute or two; when placed in a large basin of water, the sound is much obscured and is like that of a watch, one stroke being repeated, as before, at intervals. The sound is longest and most often repeated when the &quot;Tritonia&quot; are lively and moving about and is not heard when they are cold and without any motion; in the dark, I have not observed any light emitted at the time of the stroke; no globule of air escapes to the surface of the water, nor is any ripple produced on the surface at the instant of the stroke; the sound, when in a glass vessel, is mellow and distinct.&#x27; The Professor has kept these &quot;Tritonia&quot; alive in his room for a month. During the whole period of their confinement, they have continued to produce the sounds with very little diminution of their original intensity. In a small apartment, they are audible at a distance of twelve feet. The sounds obviously proceed from the mouth of the animal, and at the instant of the stroke, we observe the lips suddenly separate as if to allow the water to rush into a small vacuum formed within. As these animals are hermaphrodites, requiring mutual impregnation, the sounds may possibly be a means of communication between them, or, if they are of an electric nature, they may be the means of defending from foreign enemies, one of the most delicate, defenceless, and beautiful Gasteropods that inhabit the deep.

==Life cycle==


Nudibranchs are hermaphroditic, thus having a set of reproductive organs for both sexes, but they cannot fertilize themselves. Mating usually takes a few minutes and involves a dance-like courtship. Nudibranchs typically deposit their eggs within a gelatinous spiral, which is often described as looking like a ribbon. The number of eggs varies; it can be as few as just 1 or 2 eggs (&quot;Vayssierea felis&quot;) or as many as an estimated 25 million (&quot;Aplysia fasciata&quot;). The eggs contain toxins from sea sponges as a means of deterring predators. After hatching, the infants look almost identical to their adult counterparts, albeit smaller. Infants may also have fewer cerata. The lifespan of nudibranchs can range from a few weeks to a year, depending on the species.

==Feeding and ecological role==
All known nudibranchs are carnivorous. Some feed on sponges, others on hydroids (e.g. &quot;Cuthona&quot;), others on bryozoans (phanerobranchs such as &quot;Tambja&quot;, &quot;Limacia, Plocamopherus&quot; and &quot;Triopha&quot;), and some eat other sea slugs or their eggs (e.g. &quot;Favorinus&quot;) or, on some occasions, are cannibals and prey on members of their own species. Other groups feed on tunicates (e.g. &quot;Nembrotha&quot;, &quot;Goniodoris&quot;), other nudibranchs (&quot;Roboastra&quot;, which are descended from tunicate-feeding species), barnacles (e.g. &quot;Onchidoris bilamellata&quot;), and anemones (e.g. the Aeolidiidae and other Cladobranchia).

The surface-dwelling nudibranch, &quot;Glaucus atlanticus&quot;, is a specialist predator of siphonophores, such as the Portuguese man o&#x27; war. This predatory mollusc sucks air into its stomach to keep it afloat, and using its muscular foot, it clings to the surface film. If it finds a small victim, &quot;Glaucus&quot; simply envelops it with its capacious mouth, but if the prey is a larger siphonophore, the mollusc nibbles off its fishing tentacles, the ones carrying the most potent nematocysts. Like some others of its kind, &quot;Glaucus&quot; does not digest the nematocysts; instead, it uses them to defend itself by passing them from its gut to the surface of its skin.

==Taxonomy==

Nudibranchs are commonly divided into two main kinds, dorid and aeolid (also spelled eolid) nudibranchs:
* Dorids (clade Anthobranchia, Doridacea, or Doridoidea) are recognised by having an intact digestive gland and the feather-like branchial (gill) plume, which forms a cluster on the posterior part of the body, around the anus. Fringes on the mantle do not contain any intestines. Additionally, dorid nudibranchs commonly have distinct pockets, bumps, and/or mantle dermal formations, which are distortions on their skin, used to store bioactive defense chemicals.
* Aeolids (clade Cladobranchia) have cerata (spread across the back) instead of the branchial plume. The cerata function in place of gills and facilitate gas exchange through the epidermis. Additionally, aeolids possess a branched digestive gland, which may extend into the cerate and often has tips that contain cnidosacs (stinging cells absorbed from prey species and then used by the nudibranch). They lack a mantle. Some are hosts to zooxanthellae.

The exact systematics of nudibranchs are a topic of recent revision. Traditionally, nudibranchs have been treated as the order Nudibranchia, located in the gastropod mollusc subclass Opisthobranchia (the marine slugs: which consisted of nudibranchs, sidegill slugs, bubble snails, algae sap-sucking sea slugs, and sea hares). Since 2005, pleurobranchs (which had previously been grouped among sidegill slugs) have been placed alongside nudibranchs in the clade Nudipleura (recognising them as more closely related to each other than to other opisthobranchs). Since 2010, Opisthobranchia has been recognised as not a valid clade (it is paraphyletic) and instead Nudipleura has been placed as the first offshoot of Euthyneura (which is the dominant clade of gastropods).

In 2024, a brand new family of deep-sea pelagic nudibranch, Bathydeviidae, was described as containing a single genus, &quot;Bathydevius&quot;. This family does not appear to be closely related to any other extant nudibranch and is the only known bathypelagic nudibranch taxon.

===Traditional hierarchy===
This classification was based on the work of Johannes Thiele (1931), built on the concepts of Henri Milne-Edwards (1848).

Order Nudibranchia:
* Infraorder Anthobranchia (dorids)
** Superfamily Doridoidea 
** Superfamily Doridoxoidea 
** Superfamily Onchidoridoidea 
** Superfamily Polyceroidea 
* Infraorder Cladobranchia (aeolids)
** Superfamily Aeolidioidea 
** Superfamily Arminoidea 
** Superfamily Dendronotoidea 
** Superfamily Metarminoidea 

===Early revisions===
Newer insights derived from morphological data and gene-sequence research seemed to confirm those ideas. On the basis of investigation of 18S rDNA sequence data, strong evidence supports the monophyly of the Nudibranchia and its two major groups, the Anthobranchia/Doridoidea and Cladobranchia. A study published in May 2001, again revised the taxonomy of the Nudibranchia. They were thus divided into two major clades:
* Anthobranchia (= Bathydoridoidea + Doridoidea)
* Dexiarchia nom. nov. (= Doridoxoidea + Dendronotoidea + Aeolidoidea + &quot;Arminoidea&quot;).

However, according to the taxonomy by Bouchet &amp; Rocroi (2005), currently the most up-to-date system of classifying the gastropods, the Nudibranchia are a subclade within the clade of the Nudipleura. The Nudibranchia are then divided into two clades, with a third described in 2024:
* Bathydeviidae
* Euctenidiacea (= Holohepatica)
** Gnathodoridacea (contains only Bathydorididae)
** Doridacea
*** Doridoidea
*** Phyllidioidea
*** Onchidoridoidea
*** Polyceroidea (= Phanerobranchiata Non Suctoria)
* Dexiarchia (= Actenidiacea)
** Pseudoeuctenidiacea ( = Doridoxida)
** Cladobranchia ( = Cladohepatica)
*** Euarminida
*** Dendronotida
*** Aeolidida
*** Unassigned Cladobranchia (previously Metarminoidea)
**** Charcotiidae
**** Dironidae
**** Goniaeolididae
**** Heroidae
**** Proctonotidae
**** Madrellidae
**** Pinufiidae
**** Embletoniidae

<text>Graham Colin Swift FRSL (born 4 May 1949) is a British writer. Born in London, UK, he was educated at Dulwich College, Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, and later the University of York.

== Career ==
Some of Swift&#x27;s books have been filmed, including &quot;Waterland&quot; (1992), &quot;Shuttlecock&quot; (1993), &quot;Last Orders&quot; (1996) and &quot;Mothering Sunday&quot; (2021). His novel &quot;Last Orders&quot; was joint-winner of the 1996 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction and a controversial winner of the 1996 Booker Prize, owing to the many similarities in plot and structure to William Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot;.

The prize-winning &quot;Waterland&quot; (1983) is set in The Fens. A novel of landscape, history and family, it is often cited as one of the outstanding post-war British novels and has been a set text on the English literature syllabus in British schools. Writer Patrick McGrath asked Swift about the &quot;feeling for magic&quot; in &quot;Waterland&quot; during an interview. Swift responded that &quot;The phrase everybody comes up with is &quot;magic realism&quot;, which I think has now become a little tired. But on the other hand there’s no doubt that English writers of my generation have been very much influenced by writers from outside who in one way or another have got this magical, surreal quality, such as Borges, Márquez, Grass, and that that has been stimulating. I think in general it’s been a good thing. Because we are, as ever, terribly parochial, self-absorbed and isolated, culturally, in this country. It’s about time we began to absorb things from outside.&quot;

Swift was acquainted with Ted Hughes and has himself published poetry, some of which is included in &quot;Making an Elephant: Writing from Within&quot; (2009).

<text>The Rurality Movement ( ; LMR ), formerly Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Traditions ( ; CPNT ) is an agrarianist political party in France that aims to defend the traditional values of rural France. Its leader is Eddie Puyjalon. The party states it is neither right nor left but represents rural people on the whole in their diversity.

The party was a member of the presidential majority of Nicolas Sarkozy.

==History==

Formed in 1985, it contested both the European elections of 1989 and 1994 without success. In 1999, it obtained six seats, led by Jean Saint-Josse who was at the top of the list. It lost all representation at the following election to the European Parliament in 2004, when it obtained less than the minimum 3% of votes that allow a party to be reimbursed for campaign expenses. Consequently, it faced a deficit of 300,000 euros. At one stage, it had 32 regional councillors, but lost all of them in that same year. After these problems, most members of the CPNT have joined the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) or the Movement for France, but the party is still in existence, and nominated Frédéric Nihous, a hunter from Northern France, as a candidate in the Presidential election of 2007. Nihous won 1.15% of votes only, much lower than Jean Saint-Josse in 2002.

In the 2009 European Parliament election, the party ran as the junior partner of the Movement for France under the etiquette of the Libertas political movement led by Irish businessman Declan Ganley. They won 4.8% of the vote, but only one seat, that of MPF leader Philippe de Villiers.

In August 2009, CPNT President Frédéric Nihous announced interest in joining the Liaison Committee for the Presidential Majority, which co-ordinates the parties which support the policies of President Nicolas Sarkozy.

After the standing down of Frédéric Nihous in March 2016, Eddie Puyjalon assumed the leadership of the party.

==Presidents==
*André Goustat (1989–1998)
*Jean Saint-Josse (1998–2008)
*Frédéric Nihous (2008–2016)
*Eddie Puyjalon (2016– )

==Popular support and electoral record==

CPNT is strong in certain rural areas of France with an important community of hunters. It is strong in the Somme River estuary to the west of Abbeville, in the Manche department and the Gironde department. In the 1999 European election, CPNT won 25% of the vote in the Somme, 15.4% in the Manche, 15.2% in the Landes department and 11.9% in Gironde. In stark contrast, the party barely won 1% of the vote that year in the Alsatian department of Bas-Rhin and did poorly in the east of France, much more industrialized and much less agrarian.

CPNT has three general councillors: one in the Somme, one in Gironde and one in the Hérault department.

<text>Close-quarters battle (CQB), also called close-quarters combat (CQC), is a close combat situation between multiple combatants involving ranged (typically firearm-based) or melee combat. It can occur between military units, law enforcement and criminal elements, and in other similar situations. CQB is typically defined as a short duration, high intensity conflict characterized by sudden violence at close range.

==History==
Close-quarters battle has occurred since the beginning of warfare, in the form of melee combat, the use of ranged weaponry (such as slings, bows, and muskets) at close range, and the necessity of bayonets. During World War I, CQB was a significant part of trench warfare, where enemy soldiers would fight in close and narrow quarters in attempts to capture trenches.

The origins of modern close-quarters battle lie in the combat methods pioneered by Assistant Commissioner William E. Fairbairn of the Shanghai Municipal Police, the police force of the Shanghai International Settlement (1854–1943). After the 1925 May Thirtieth Movement, Fairbairn was tasked with developing a dedicated auxiliary squad for riot control and aggressive policing. After absorbing the most appropriate elements from a variety of martial arts experts, Fairbairn condensed these arts into a martial art he called &quot;defendu&quot;. The aim of defendu was to be as brutally effective as possible, while also being relatively easy for recruits and trainees to learn compared to other martial arts. The method incorporated both less-lethal and lethal fighting tactics, such as point shooting, firearm combat techniques, and the use of more ad hoc weapons such as chairs or table legs.

During World War II, Fairbairn was recruited to train Allied special forces in defendu. During this period, he expanded defendu&#x27;s lethality for military purposes, calling it the &quot;Silent Killing Close Quarters Combat method&quot;; this became standard combat training for British special forces. He also published a textbook for CQB training called &quot;Get Tough&quot;. U.S. Army officers Rex Applegate and Anthony Biddle were taught Fairbairn&#x27;s methods at a training facility in Scotland, and adopted the program for the training of Allied operatives at Camp X in Ontario, Canada. Applegate published his work in 1943, called &quot;Kill or Get Killed&quot;. During the war, training was provided to British Commandos, the First Special Service Force, OSS operatives, U.S. Army Rangers, and Marine Raiders. Other military martial arts were later introduced elsewhere, including European Unifight, Chinese sanshou, Soviet sambo, and the Israeli kapap and Krav Maga.

For a lengthy period following World War II, urban warfare and CQB had barely changed in infantry tactics. Modern firearm CQB tactics were developed in the 1970s as &quot;close-quarters battle&quot; by Western counterterrorist special forces units following the 1972 Munich massacre. The units trained in the aftermath of the massacre, such as the Special Air Service, Delta Force, GSG 9, GIGN, and Joint Task Force 2, developed CQB tactics involving firearms to quickly and precisely assault structures while minimizing friendly and hostage casualties; these CQB tactics were shared between these special forces units, who were closely-knit and frequently trained together. The Special Air Service used CQB tactics during the 1980 Iranian Embassy siege. CQB tactics soon reached police tactical units and similar paramilitaries, such as American SWAT teams, by the 1980s and 1990s.

However, CQB was still not widely taught to regular infantry, as it was considered a hostage rescue tactic. As late as the 1990s, some infantry manuals on urban combat described close-quarters room clearing essentially the same basic way it was described 60 years prior: a grenade being thrown into an enclosed area, followed by an infantry assault with automatic fire. The special forces &quot;monopoly&quot; on CQB was broken following the experiences of urban warfare and close-quarters battles in the 1990s, during the Battle of Mogadishu, the Bosnian War, and the First Chechen War.

The First and Second Battles of Fallujah during the Iraq War were the watershed moments for infantry CQB, when U.S. Marines, under pressure to capture the city of Fallujah, Iraq from insurgents, used conventional combined arms and fire support against the city, and lacked proper CQB training and equipment to effectively clear buildings, causing numerous civilian and allied casualties and severely damaging the city. With similar struggles in towns and cities among ABCA Armies during the War in Afghanistan, a proper approach to infantry in urban warfare became crucial, and CQB tactics began to be more widely taught to infantry.

According to scholar Anthony King, some special forces units express disdain at regular infantry being taught CQB, especially in organizational politics and internal matters such as securing budgets; a unit with CQB training requires expensive equipment and training facilities, using up funding that could be used for other units or purposes.

==Examples==
* The Battle of Spotsylvania Court House took place between 9 and 21 May 1864 during the American Civil War. The men of the Northern and Southern armies were periodically forced into a bloody hand-to-hand struggle reminiscent of ancient battles, with the men using swords, knives, bayonets, and even with sticks and bare hands.
* The Battle of Isandlwana on 22 January 1879, the first battle in the Anglo-Zulu War, turned into close combat when the British exhausted their ammunition. It resulted in a decisive victory for Zulus over the modern British army.
* On 22 October 1986, during the Pudu Prison siege, the Special Actions Unit (special ops unit of the Royal Malaysia Police) turned to hand-to-hand combat, using batons and rattan canes, after the Malaysian Prime Minister ordered the resolution of the hostage crisis without the use of firearms. The result was a victory for the police, and the five prisoners holding hostages in Pudu Prison were arrested.
* The Battle of Danny Boy took place close to the city of Amarah in southern Iraq on 14 May 2004, between British soldiers and about 100 Iraqi insurgents of the Mahdi Army. The insurgents ambushed a patrol of Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders close to a checkpoint known as Danny Boy near Majar al-Kabir. The Argylls called in reinforcements from the 1st Battalion of the Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment; the latter were also ambushed, and due to an electronic communications failure, it was some time before further British relief arrived. While waiting for reinforcements, the British were involved in one of the fiercest engagements they fought in Iraq. The fighting involved close-quarter rifle fire and bayonets. The battle lasted for about three hours, during which 28 Mahdi Army insurgents were killed; the British suffered some wounded, but none were killed in the action.

== Use ==

=== Military ===
Military uses of close-quarters battle vary by unit type, branch, and mission. Military operations other than war (MOOTW) may involve peacekeeping or riot control. Specialized forces may adapt MOUT tactics to their own needs, such as marine naval boarding teams being trained specifically to search ships and fight CQB within them. Hostage rescue or extraction units may involve even more esoteric adaptations or variations, depending on environments, weapons technology, political considerations, or personnel.

Armies that often engage in urban warfare operations may train most of their infantry in basic CQB doctrine as it relates to common tasks such as building entry, clearing a room, and using different types of grenades.

=== Police and law enforcement ===
Police tactical units (PTU) are the primary units that engage in CQB domestically. Situations involving the potential for CQB generally involve threats outside of conventional police capabilities, and thus PTUs are trained, equipped, and organized to handle these situations. Additionally, police action is often within what can be considered &quot;close quarters&quot;, so members of PTUs are often well-trained in or already experienced with CQB, to the point that some PTUs may train military service members in CQB principles such as breaching and room clearing.

Police CQB doctrine is often specialized by unit type and mission. Depending on the unit or agency&#x27;s jurisdiction or scope, PTUs may have different goals with different tactics and technology; for example, prison guards may maintain a unit trained in CQB in compact indoors areas such as cells without using lethal force, while a police anti-gang unit may be trained in CQB against multiple enemies that may be difficult to identify.

Unlike their military counterparts, PTUs, as law enforcement officers, are tasked with ideally apprehending suspects alive; for this reason, they are often trained in arrest procedures, non-lethal takedowns, and standoff negotiation instead of solely combat. They may be equipped with less-lethal weaponry such as tasers, pepper spray, and riot guns to fire tear gas, rubber bullets, plastic bullets, or beanbag rounds.

=== Private industry ===
Private security and private military companies may maintain units that are trained in CQB. These teams may be responsible for responding to an incident at a facility operated by a government agency that has hired their security services, or to provide protection for VIPs in combat zones. For instance, the U.S. Department of State employed such security teams in Iraq.

Private military and security companies known to maintain units that are trained in, or are capable of training other units in, CQB include Blackwater and SCG International Risk.

<text>The Little Entente was an alliance formed in 1920 and 1921 by Czechoslovakia, Romania and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslavia from 1929 on) with the purpose of common defense against Hungarian revisionism and the prospect of a Habsburg restoration in Austria or Hungary. France supported the alliance by signing treaties with each member country. The rapid growth of German power caused its collapse in 1938, and it never went into wartime operation.

== Origins ==
The first attempts seeking a mutual defense of the successor states of Austria-Hungary took place during the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. The most remarkable and ardent proponent of the certain alliance binding the successor states was Edvard Beneš, the foreign minister of Czechoslovakia from 1918 to 1935. Beneš played such a crucial role in establishing the Little Entente that he was regarded as its real founder.

It also clearly reflected his belief in the necessity to develop democracy in not only Czechoslovakia but also other European states.

The obvious aim of his proposed alliance was to prevent the resurgence of Hungarian power and the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy, but its real purpose followed a much broader pattern. The alliance was designed to stop any encroachments on the independence of the member states committed by any European power. Beneš, therefore, intended to gain the respect of Hungary and other powers such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom. In addition, the Little Entente was to strengthen the influence of its member states in international deliberations.

Hungarian historian Ádám Magda wrote in her study &quot;Versailles System and Central Europe&quot; (2006): &quot;Today we know that the bane of Central Europe was the Little Entente, military alliance of Czechoslovakia, Romania and Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), created in 1921 not for Central Europe&#x27;s cooperation nor to fight German expansion, but in a wrong perceived notion that a completely powerless Hungary must be kept down&quot;.

Another interpretation is based on considerations of the new balance of power in Europe after World War I. France planned to contain possible German aggression by forming an arrangement with Germany&#x27;s neighbours. Before World War I, Russia had served that purpose, but after the war, France was reluctant to establish normal diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union, Russia&#x27;s successor. Therefore, France sought alternative states near Germany with close ties to France. As the Little Entente fulfilled those conditions, France strongly supported its formation.

== Formation ==
A collective defense arrangement was signed in Belgrade on August 14, 1920, during a convention of Czechoslovakia and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The treaty guaranteed mutual assistance in the event of an unprovoked attack launched by Hungary against any stipulator. Ratifications were exchanged in Belgrade on February 10, 1921. Subsequently, Beneš suggested participation in the emerging alliance to Romania on August 17, 1920, but his offer was rejected by the Romanian government. Although the mentioned treaty was signed, it did not serve as a regular allied convention.

The allied conventions that formed the Little Entente were signed as follows:

* The treaty between Czechoslovakia and Romania signed on April 23, 1921, in Bucharest. Ratifications were exchanged in Bucharest on May 27, 1921. The treaty was prolonged by a supplementary protocols signed on May 7, 1923, June 13, 1926, and May 21, 1929.
* The treaty between the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and Romania signed on June 7, 1921 in Belgrade. The treaty was prolonged by supplementary protocol on May 21, 1929.
* The treaty between Czechoslovakia and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes signed on August 31, 1922, in Belgrade. Ratifications were exchanged in Belgrade on October 3, 1922. The treaty was prolonged by additional protocols signed on September 19, 1928 and May 21, 1929.

The mentioned conventions encompassed almost identical terms as the treaty of August 14, 1920. Again, it was stated that in the event of an unprovoked attack employed by Hungary against a certain stipulator, other parties should provide mutual assistance. In addition, the treaties defined the mutual assistance via a special military convention that was to be signed. Until such a convention came into force, interim measures were to be taken. The member states of the Little Entente also pledged themselves to co-operation the foreign policy towards Hungary.

* All of those conventions were replaced by a comprehensive treaty of alliance between the governments of Romania, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, signed in Štrbské Pleso (now Slovakia) on June 27, 1930, and entered into effect &quot;immediately&quot;, according to Article 6. The treaty created a regular consultative structure for the Little Entente and required the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the parties to meet at least once a year. It was registered in &quot;League of Nations Treaty Series&quot; on October 3, 1930. Ratifications were exchanged in Prague on November 25, 1930.

During its formation, the Little Entente had to prove its determination of being a safeguard against any restoration sponsored by the Habsburgs.

Firstly, Charles I of Austria returned to Hungary from Switzerland on March 26, 1921. He reclaimed the Hungarian throne, but his action earned neither the support of Miklós Horthy nor the consent of the Little Entente. Thus, Charles was forced to leave the country on April 1, 1921. On October 20, 1921, however, he returned to Hungary and renewed his claims. The situation was complicated by the fact that Charles had managed to gain the support of a certain part of the army.

The Little Entente reacted promptly, under the guidance of Beneš. Its member states began to mobilize their armies, and the threat of direct involvement from them was imminent. Moreover, other European powers expressed their opposition to Charles&#x27;s attempts at restoration. The Hungarian government defeated Charles&#x27;s followers and arrested him on October 24, 1921. That was followed by the Hungarian reluctance to deprive Charles of his titles and the increasing danger of a military incursion of the Little Entente into Hungary. Finally, the Hungarian government passed an act abrogating Charles&#x27;s sovereign rights on November 10, 1921.

== Consolidation ==
Although the thwarted restoration of the Habsburgs was an unambiguous success, subsequent events revealed increasing tensions within the alliance. The Genoa Conference (April 10 to May 19, 1922) highlighted the different opinions among the member states. The problem arose from the possible recognition of the Soviet Union by its European counterparts. Czechoslovakia was mainly an industrial state and so it was disposed to normalise its relations with the Soviet Union and to recognize the newly-formed state. The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and Romania, however, were both agrarian countries that were uninterested in economic co-operation with the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, all member states participating in the Little Entente considered the Soviet Union as a threat.

In the 1920s, France, as the main supporter of the Little Entente, pursued its policy towards the tightening of the alliance by launching a series of friendship treaties aimed at forging the relations between France; Czechoslovakia; the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes; and Romania. The mentioned treaties were signed as follows:

* The Treaty of Alliance and Friendship between France and Czechoslovakia, signed on January 25, 1924, in Paris, which was concluded for an unlimited time.
* The Treaty of Friendship between France and Romania, signed on June 10, 1926 in Paris, which was originally concluded for 10 years, but it was extended for another 10 years on November 8, 1936.
* The Treaty of Friendship between France and Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, signed on November 11, 1927 in Paris, which was originally concluded for five years, but it was extended on November 10, 1932 and December 2, 1937.

The treaties obliged the parties to consult their foreign policies, particularly the security matters of the involved states.

The successful performance of the Little Entente resulted in its institutionalisation. Guided by this purpose, the Pact of Organisation, also called &quot;The Little Entente System&quot; or &quot;The Reorganisation Pact&quot;, was signed in Geneva on February 16, 1933. Ratifications were exchanged in Prague on May 30, 1933, and the treaty became effective on the same day. It was registered in &quot;League of Nations Treaty Series&quot; on July 4, 1933. The treaty was delivered by Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the member states: Bogoljub Jevtić for Yugoslavia, Nicolae Titulescu for Romania, and Edvard Beneš for Czechoslovakia. The aim of the Pact of Organisation was to provide a legal framework for a permanent collaboration among the member states. The objective was to be reached by an establishing of new institutions operating on behalf of the member states within the Little Entente. The main instruments of collaboration were:

* The Permanent Council was to consist of the ministers of foreign affairs of the three respective countries or of the special delegates appointed for that purpose. Decisions of the council were to be brought unanimously. The council was designed to meet at least three times per year. The mentioned meetings were to be held in each of the member states and in Geneva during the session of the League of Nations.
* The Secretariat of the Permanent Council was to perform the day-to-day routine operations of the Little Entente. In addition, a certain section of the secretariat was aimed to function permanently in the seat of the League of Nations.
* The Economic Council was implemented by which the member states declared their will to co-ordinate its economic interests as well.

== Disbandment ==
The resurgence of German power after 1933 had gradually undermined French influence in the Little Entente countries.

In 1938, the harsh opposition to any concessions from the three countries&#x27; new territories began to receive less French support. In 22 August, France signed the Bled agreement, revoking certain restrictions placed on Hungary by the Treaty of Trianon. In 30 September, the Munich Agreement was signed, granting Germany parts of Czechoslovakia.

France had seen the Little Entente as an opportunity, in the interests of French security, to revitalize the threat of a two-front war against Germany. To relieve that threat in 1934, Croatian Ustaše and possibly Italy, Hungary and Bulgaria backed revolutionary Vlado Chernozemski, who assassinated King Alexander I of Yugoslavia and the French minister of foreign affairs, two leading proponents of the Little Entente. That was a prelude to World War II.

== Croatian–Romanian–Slovak friendship proclamation ==
During World War II, Romania, the Independent State of Croatia and the Slovak State formed an alliance similar to the Little Entente with the purpose of stopping any further Hungarian expansion. The alliance was formed by Romanian Marshal Ion Antonescu.

<doc id="356007" wikidata="Q1421440" url="?curid=356007" title="Fitzwilliam Museum">
<text>The Fitzwilliam Museum is the art and antiquities museum of the University of Cambridge. It is located on Trumpington Street opposite Fitzwilliam Street in central Cambridge. It was founded in 1816 under the will of Richard FitzWilliam, 7th Viscount FitzWilliam (1745–1816), and comprises one of the best collections of antiquities and modern art in western Europe. With over half a million objects and artworks in its collections, the displays in the museum explore world history and art from antiquity to the present. The treasures of the museum include artworks by Monet, Picasso, Rubens, Vincent van Gogh, Renoir, Rembrandt, Cézanne, Van Dyck, and Canaletto, as well as a winged bas-relief from Nimrud. Admission to the public is always free.

The museum is a partner in the University of Cambridge Museums consortium, one of 16 Major Partner Museum services funded by Arts Council England to lead the development of the museums sector.

==Foundation and buildings==

The museum was founded in 1816 with the legacy of the library and art collection of Richard FitzWilliam, 7th Viscount FitzWilliam. The bequest included £100,000 &quot;to cause to be erected a good substantial museum repository&quot;. The Fitzwilliam now contains over 500,000 items and is one of the best museums in the United Kingdom. The collection was initially placed in the Perse School building in Free School Lane. It was moved in 1842 to the Old Schools in central Cambridge, which housed the Cambridge University Library.

The &quot;Founder&#x27;s Building&quot; was built during the period 1837–1843 to the designs of George Basevi, completed by C. R. Cockerell. The decorative carving, pediment and four lions were by William Grinsell Nicholl. The foundation stone of the new building was laid by Gilbert Ainslie in 1837. The museum opened in 1848. The Palladian Entrance Hall, by Edward Middleton Barry, was completed in 1875. A further large bequest was made to the university in 1912 by Charles Brinsley Marlay, including £80,000 and 84 paintings from his private collection. A two-storey extension to the south-east, paid for partly by the Courtauld family, was added in 1931, greatly expanding the space of the museum and allowing research teams to work on site.

The museum buildings and, separately, the boundary along the street frontage, are Grade I listed.

==Collection==
The museum has five departments: Antiquities; Applied Arts; Coins and Medals; Rare Manuscripts and Printed Books; and Paintings, Drawings and Prints. Together these cover antiquities from ancient Egypt, Nubia, Greece and Rome, Romano-Egyptian art, Western Asiatic displays, and a new gallery of Cypriot art; applied arts, including English and European pottery and glass, furniture, clocks, fans, armour, Chinese, Japanese and Korean art, rugs and samplers; coins and medals; illuminated, literary and music manuscripts and rare printed books; paintings, including masterpieces by Simone Martini, Domenico Veneziano, Titian, Veronese, Rubens, Van Dyck, van Goyen, Frans Hals, Canaletto, Hogarth, Gainsborough, Constable, Monet, Degas, Renoir, Cézanne and Picasso and a fine collection of 20th-century art; miniatures, drawings, watercolours and prints. Among the notable works in the antiquities collection is a bas-relief from Persepolis, and a colossal caryatid from Eleusis known as the Saint Demetra.

===Music manuscripts===
There is also the largest collection of 16th-century Elizabethan virginal manuscript music written by some of the most notable composers of the time, such as William Byrd, Doctor John Bull, Orlando Gibbons and Thomas Tallis.

===Egyptian collection===
The Egyptian Galleries at the Fitzwilliam Museum reopened in 2006 after a two-year, £1.5 million programme of refurbishment, conservation and research. The redevelopment also allowed for the public display of more antiquities which had previously been confined to the Fitzwilliam&#x27;s underground storage facility. The Egyptian Galleries are among the museum&#x27;s most popular exhibits. They feature an immersive public display which allows families and young visitors to understand the context and landscape of ancient Egyptian through participatory exhibitions. Today, the Fitzwilliam&#x27;s Egyptian Galleries contain some of the best displays on Egyptian antiquities outside the British Museum.

===Paintings===

The museum has a wide collection of paintings and sketches, including works by Monet, Picasso, Rubens, Vincent van Gogh, Cézanne, Degas, Rembrandt, Van Dyck, Canaletto, Constable, Murillo (&quot;The Vision of Fray Lauterio&quot;), and Renoir. It also has extensive works by J. M. W. Turner, which has its origins in a set of 25 watercolour drawings donated to the university by John Ruskin in 1861. Sir Sydney Cockerell, who was serving as director of the museum at the time, acquired a further eight Turner watercolours and some of his writings.

The museum&#x27;s collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings includes a version of Ford Madox Brown&#x27;s 1855 &quot;The Last of England&quot;, voted eighth-greatest painting in Britain in 2005&#x27;s Radio 4 poll, the Greatest Painting in Britain Vote.

Many items in the museum are on loan from colleges of the University of Cambridge, for example an important group of impressionist paintings owned by King&#x27;s College, which includes Cézanne&#x27;s &quot;The Abduction&quot; and a study for &quot;Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte&quot; by Seurat. Many of the Fitzwilliam&#x27;s paintings were donated by alumni and donors of the University of Cambridge, for instance, the economist Maynard Keynes donated his personal collection, including Cezanne&#x27;s &quot;Still Life With Apples&quot; which he bought in 1918.

===Michelangelo bronzes===

In 2015, the museum displayed the Rothschild Bronzes, two bronze statues that it believed to be the work of Italian Renaissance artist Michelangelo. If true, they would be the only known surviving bronze sculptures by the artist. The pair of statues depict naked, apparently drunk, men riding panthers. Art historian Paul Joannides connected the statues to a drawing in the Musée Fabre by an apprentice of Michelangelo depicting the same subject in the same pose.

===Incidents===
On 25 January 2006, a visitor tripped and shattered three massive Qing Dynasty vases which had been on public display since 1948. In April 2006, the man was arrested but charges of causing criminal damage were dropped. Scholars and restoration experts from the Fitzwilliam Museum were able to reconstruct the damaged porcelain vases and largely restore them to their former splendour. The vases have been put back on display and are now protected by security glass.

On 13 April 2012, 18 pieces of Chinese jade were stolen by a gang nicknamed the Rathkeale Rovers. The burglars were eventually caught and sentenced to a combined 18 years in jail, but several of the most valuable pieces were not recovered and are speculated to have been sold to China. Estimates of the lost artifacts&#x27; value range up to £57 million, making the heist one of the most significant by value in UK history.

==Friends of the Fitzwilliam Museum==

Founded in 1909, the Friends of the Fitzwilliam Museum is the oldest society in Britain specifically dedicated to the long-term support and development of a museum. The Friends of the Fitzwilliam Museum have raised funds to acquire major artworks and provide for the expansion and refurbishment of the museum site. The current priorities of the Friends of the Fitzwilliam Museum include acquisition of major contemporary works and development of a significant endowment to secure the museum for posterity.

Princess Alexandra of Kent is president of the Fitzwilliam Museum Development Trust.

<text>Rasul Gamzatovich Gamzatov (, ; ; 8 September 19233 November 2003) was a Soviet and Russian poet who wrote in Avar. Among his poems was &quot;Zhuravli&quot;, which became a well-known Soviet song.

==Life==
Gamzatov was born on 8 September 1923 in the Avar village of Tsada in the north-east Caucasus. His father, Gamzat Tsadasa, was a well-known bard, heir to the ancient tradition of minstrelsy still thriving in the mountains. He was eleven when he wrote his first verse about a group of local boys who ran down to the clearing where an airplane had landed for the first time. A number of different poems by him also became songs, such as &quot;Gone Sunny Days&quot;.

In 1939 he graduated from Pedagogical College. He had various jobs serving as a school teacher, an assistant director in the theater, a journalist in newspapers and a radio host. From 1945 to 1950 he studied at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute.

Gamzatov was awarded the State Stalin Prize in 1952, The Lenin Prize in 1963, and Laureate Of The International Botev Prize in 1981.

Gamzatov died on 3 November 2003 at the age of 80 in the Moscow Central Clinical Hospital. He was buried in the old Muslim cemetery in Tarki, next to the grave of his wife.

A monument to Gamzatov was unveiled on 5 July 2013 on Yauzsky Boulevard in central Moscow.

<text>Elias George Basevi FRS (1 April 1794 – 16 October 1845) was a British architect who worked in both Neoclassical and Gothic Revival styles. A pupil of Sir John Soane, his designs included Belgrave Square in London, and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. He was surveyor to the Guardian Assurance Company, to the Trustees of Smith&#x27;s Charity and to the Thurloe estate. 

==Life==
He was the youngest son of a City of London merchant, also named George Basevi. The family were of Sephardic Jewish origin, and Basevi&#x27;s father remained a member of the congregation of the Bevis Marks Synagogue until 1817. Basevi was educated at the Reverend Dr Burney&#x27;s school at Greenwich, and then trained professionally with John Soane, after which he spent three years studying in Greece and Rome. In 1821 he became the first surveyor of the Guardian Assurance Company, a post he held until his death. His work for the company involved personally inspecting and reporting on buildings where there was a great risk, or which were insured for large amounts. He also remodelled their premises in Lombard Street.

In 1822 he designed St Thomas&#x27; Church, Stockport and the next year, St Mary&#x27;s, Greenwich. Both were for the Commissioners of the Church Building Act, and were in the neo-classical style. Basevi was unhappy with the modifications to the designs of the steeples imposed by the Commissioners, and he did no further work for them. St Mary&#x27;s was demolished in 1936 after 17 years of closure.

He designed Belgrave Square for the developers William and George Haldimand; it was built between 1825 and 1841. Success there led to his appointment as Surveyor to the Trustees of Smith&#x27;s Charity at Brompton, and to the adjoining Thurloe estate. At first his duties for the Smith&#x27;s Charity estate were utilitarian, but in 1832 the bankruptcy of some tenant nurserymen freed eight acres for development, and between 1833 and 1845 he worked with the builder James Bonnin to develop Pelham Crescent, Pelham Place, part of Pelham Street and Egerton Crescent. He also designed the houses in Thurloe Square, off the Brompton Road, for the Thurloe estate.
In 1835 he won the competition to design a museum for Cambridge University, funded by a bequest from Viscount Fitzwilliam, with an imposing design in the Corinthian style. Work on the Fitzwilliam Museum was continued after Basevi&#x27;s death by C. R. Cockerell.

Basevi built two Gothic churches in Chelsea, St Jude and St Saviour, and another, Holy Trinity at Twickenham Green. In 1834–6, he largely rebuilt the church of St Andrew, Hove, which had been in ruins since the collapse of its tower some years earlier. The church at Eye in Northamptonshire was also rebuilt to Basevi&#x27;s designs; it was opened in 1847, two years after his death; a steeple was added in 1857. He also used the Gothic style at almshouses in Stamford and Ely, and at Coulsdon rectory, Surrey. He carried out some work for Balliol College, Oxford including a Gothic ceiling for the chapel, and was invited to design a whole new frontage for the college, but the plans were never carried out, due to the intervention of a faction amongst the fellows who commissioned an alternative set of plans from Pugin.

Other work included the stables at Bretton Hall in Yorkshire, Bywell Bridge in Northumberland, the Entrance Hall and Dining Room at Painswick House for his brother-in-law William Henry Hyett, and the remodelling of Gatcombe Park for the economist David Ricardo. In 1834 he made extensive alterations and additions to the Middlesex Hospital and later built a new medical school and operating theatre there. In 1834 he designed Beechwood House in Hampstead for his brother, Nathanial. He enlarged the prison at Ely and built a new one at Wisbech, In collaboration with Sidney Smirke he designed premises for the Conservative Club (1842–45), and the two architects were chosen to design a new building for the Carlton Club, but the scheme was delayed due to financial considerations.

Basevi became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1843.

He died on 15 October 1845, aged 51, after falling through an opening in the floor of the old bell chamber of the west tower of Ely Cathedral while inspecting repairs. He was buried in the North Choir Aisle towards the east end of the cathedral under a monumental brass.
A London County Council blue plaque commemorates Basevi at 17 Savile Row in Mayfair.

Basevi&#x27;s sons became army engineers. The older son George Henry became a colonel and later took an interest in microscopy. The younger, James Palladio Basevi became an army engineer who died in the Himalayas while conducting gravitational surveys.

<text>An &quot;officer-elect&quot; is a person who has been elected to a position but has not yet been installed. Notably, a president who has been elected but not yet installed would be referred to as a &quot;president-elect&quot; (e.g. president-elect of the United States).

Analogously, the term &quot;-designate&quot; (e.g. prime minister-designate) is used for the same purpose, especially when someone is appointed rather than elected (e.g., justice-designate).

== History ==
This usage of the term &quot;-elect&quot; originated in the Catholic Church, where bishops were elected but would not take office until ordained. In addition, the winner of a papal election would be known as the &quot;pope-elect&quot; until he was confirmed and became pope.

The term entered politics with the practice of elective monarchy. For example, the Holy Roman emperor was elected by a college of prince-electors, but the winning candidate would not become emperor until he was crowned by the pope. Between election and coronation, he was known as the &quot;imperator electus&quot;, or emperor-elect.

By the 19th century, the term had expanded to describe any position in which a substantial period elapses between election and installation. For example, it was common in the 19th century to refer to a fiancée as a &quot;bride-elect&quot;.

== Official positions in organizations ==
The bylaws of some clubs and other organizations may define an official position of president-elect similar to a vice president position. The members of the organization elect the president-elect, rather than directly electing the organization&#x27;s president. The president-elect may be given limited duties, similar to a vice president. At the end of the term, the president-elect is promoted to the position of president, and a new president-elect is elected. The advantage of this schema is a clear continuity of succession, as well as the opportunity to familiarize the president-elect with the operations of the organization before becoming president. A possible drawback is that once a president-elect has been elected, another person cannot be elected president unless the president-elect resigns or is removed from office.

The position of president-elect is different from someone who was elected president and is called &quot;president-elect&quot; between the time of election and the start of the term. For example, if an election for president was held in January, but the term of office does not begin until March, the person who was elected president may be called &quot;president-elect&quot; but does not hold any power until the term begins in March. On the other hand, someone in the position of president-elect has all the powers of that position that the bylaws provide.

Similarly, organizations may have other official positions such as vice president-elect, secretary-treasurer-elect, director-elect, and chair-elect.

<doc id="356028" wikidata="Q1403472" url="?curid=356028" title="Felix Frankfurter">
<text>Felix Frankfurter (November 15, 1882 – February 22, 1965) was an Austrian-born American jurist who served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1939 until 1962, during which he was an advocate of judicial restraint.

Frankfurter was born in Vienna, immigrating to New York City at the age of 12. After graduating from Harvard Law School, Frankfurter worked for Henry L. Stimson, the U.S. Secretary of War. During World War I, Frankfurter served as Judge Advocate General. After the war, he helped found the American Civil Liberties Union and returned to his position as a professor at Harvard Law School. He became a friend and adviser of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who appointed him to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by the death of Benjamin N. Cardozo. His adherence to judicial restraint during an era where conservative justices wielded the judicial power through the derogation canon and the &quot;plain meaning rule&quot; to strike down progressive laws has been described as liberal by some commentators.

Frankfurter served on the Court until his retirement in 1962, and was succeeded by Arthur Goldberg. Frankfurter wrote the Court&#x27;s majority opinions in cases such as &quot;Minersville School District v. Gobitis&quot;, &quot;Gomillion v. Lightfoot&quot;, and &quot;Beauharnais v. Illinois&quot;. He wrote dissenting opinions in notable cases such as &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot;, &quot;West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette&quot;, &quot;Glasser v. United States&quot;, and &quot;Trop v. Dulles&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Frankfurter was born into an Ashkenazi Jewish family on November 15, 1882, in Vienna (then part of Austria-Hungary). He was the third of six children of Leopold Frankfurter, a merchant, and Emma (Winter) Frankfurter. His father died in 1916. His mother died in January 1928 after a prolonged illness. His uncle, Solomon Frankfurter, was head librarian at the Vienna University Library. Frankfurter&#x27;s forebears had been rabbis for generations. In 1894, twelve-year-old Frankfurter and his family immigrated to the United States, settling in New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side, a dense center of immigrants. Frankfurter attended P.S. 25 and Townsend Harris High School, where he excelled at his studies and enjoyed playing chess and shooting craps on the street. He spent many hours reading at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art and attending political lectures, usually on subjects such as trade unionism, socialism, and communism.

After graduating in 1902 from City College of New York, where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa, Frankfurter worked for the Tenement House Department of New York City to raise money for law school. He applied successfully to Harvard Law School, where he excelled academically and socially. He became lifelong friends with Walter Lippmann and Horace Kallen, became an editor of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;, and graduated first in his class with one of the best academic records since Louis Brandeis.

==Early career==
Frankfurter&#x27;s legal career began when he joined the New York law firm of Hornblower, Byrne, Miller &amp; Potter in 1906. In the same year, he was hired as the assistant to Henry Stimson, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. During this period, Frankfurter read Herbert Croly&#x27;s book &quot;The Promise of American Life&quot;, and became a supporter of the New Nationalism and of Theodore Roosevelt. In 1911, President William Howard Taft appointed Stimson as his Secretary of War, and Stimson appointed Frankfurter as law officer of the Bureau of Insular Affairs. Frankfurter worked directly for Stimson as his assistant and confidant. His government position restricted his ability to publicly voice his Progressive views, though he expressed his opinions privately to friends such as Judge Learned Hand. In 1912 Frankfurter supported the Bull Moose campaign to return Roosevelt to the presidency, and was bitterly disappointed when Woodrow Wilson was elected. He became increasingly disillusioned with the established parties, and described himself as &quot;politically homeless&quot;.

==First World War==
Frankfurter&#x27;s work in Washington had impressed the faculty at Harvard Law School, who used a donation from the financier Jacob Schiff to create a position for him there after Louis Brandeis suggested that Schiff do this. He taught mainly administrative law and occasionally criminal law. With fellow professor James M. Landis, he advocated judicial restraint in dealing with government misdeeds, including greater freedom for administrative agencies from judicial oversight. He also served as counsel for the National Consumers League, arguing for Progressive causes such as minimum wage and restricted work hours. He was involved in the early years of &quot;The New Republic&quot; magazine after its founding by Herbert Croly.
When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Frankfurter and took a special leave from Harvard to be commissioned a major in the United States Army Reserve, where he supervised military courts-martial as a Judge Advocate General in 1917 and served as special assistant to the Secretary of War Newton D. Baker until 1918.

In September 1917, he was appointed counsel to a commission, the President&#x27;s Mediation Committee, established by President Wilson to resolve major strikes threatening war production. Among the disturbances he investigated were the 1916 Preparedness Day Bombing in San Francisco, where he argued strongly that the radical leader Thomas Mooney had been framed and required a new trial. He also examined the copper industry in Arizona, where industry bosses solved industrial relations problems by having more than 1,000 strikers forcibly deported to New Mexico. He also represented the Labor Department on the priorities board of the War Industries Board. Overall, Frankfurter&#x27;s work gave him an opportunity to learn firsthand about labor politics and extremism, including anarchism, communism and revolutionary socialism. He came to sympathize with labor issues, arguing that &quot;unsatisfactory, remediable social conditions, if unattended, give rise to radical movements far transcending the original impulse.&quot; His activities led the public to view him as a radical lawyer and supporter of radical principles. Former President Theodore Roosevelt accused him of being &quot;engaged in excusing men precisely like the Bolsheviki in Russia&quot;.

==Post First World War==
As the war drew to a close, Frankfurter was among the nearly one hundred intellectuals who signed a statement of principles for the formation of the League of Free Nations Associations, intended to increase United States participation in international affairs.

Frankfurter was encouraged by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis to become more involved in Zionism. With Brandeis, he lobbied President Wilson to support the Balfour Declaration, a British government statement supporting the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. In 1918, he participated in the founding conference of the American Jewish Congress in Philadelphia, creating a national democratic organization of Jewish leaders from all over the US. In 1919, Frankfurter served as a Zionist delegate to the Paris Peace Conference.

===Marriage and family===
In 1919, Frankfurter married Marion Denman, a Smith College graduate and the daughter of a Congregational minister. They married after a long and difficult courtship, and against the wishes of his mother, who was disturbed by the prospect of her son marrying outside the Jewish faith. Frankfurter was a non-practicing Jew, and regarded religion as &quot;an accident of birth&quot;. Frankfurter was a domineering husband and Denman suffered from frail health. She suffered frequent mental breakdowns. The couple had no children.

===Founding ACLU===
Frankfurter&#x27;s activities continued to attract attention for their alleged radicalism. In November 1919, he chaired a meeting in support of American recognition of the newly created Soviet Union. In 1920, Frankfurter helped to found the American Civil Liberties Union. Following the arrest of suspected communist radicals in 1919 and 1920 during the Palmer raids, Frankfurter, together with other prominent lawyers including Zechariah Chafee, signed an ACLU report which condemned the &quot;utterly illegal acts committed by those charged with the highest duty of enforcing the laws&quot; and noted they had committed entrapment, police brutality, prolonged incommunicado detention, and violations of due process in court. Frankfurter and Chafee also submitted briefs to a habeas corpus application to the Massachusetts Federal District Court. Judge George W. Anderson ordered the discharge of twenty aliens, and his denunciation of the raids effectively ended them. It was during this time that J. Edgar Hoover followed Frankfurter, referring to him as &quot;the most dangerous man in the United States&quot;, and describing him in a report as a &quot;disseminator of Bolshevik propaganda&quot;.

In 1921, Frankfurter was given a chair at Harvard Law School, where he continued progressive work on behalf of socialists and oppressed and religious minorities. When A. Lawrence Lowell, the President of Harvard University, proposed to limit the enrollment of Jewish students, Frankfurter worked with others to defeat the plan.

In the late 1920s, he attracted public attention when he supported calls for a new trial for Sacco and Vanzetti, two Italian immigrant anarchists who had been sentenced to death on robbery and murder charges. Frankfurter wrote an influential article for &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; and subsequently a book, &quot;The Case of Sacco and Vanzetti: A Critical Analysis for Lawyers and Laymen&quot;. He critiqued the prosecution&#x27;s case and the judge&#x27;s handling of the trial; he asserted that the convictions were the result of anti-immigrant prejudice and enduring anti-radical hysteria of the Red Scare of 1919–20. His activities further isolated him from his Harvard colleagues and from Boston society.

==Advisor to President Roosevelt==

Following the inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, Frankfurter quickly became a trusted and loyal adviser to the new president. Frankfurter was considered to be liberal and advocated progressive legislation. He argued against the economic plans of Raymond Moley, Adolf Berle and Rexford Tugwell, while recognizing the need for major changes to deal with the inequalities of wealth distribution that had led to the devastating nature of the Great Depression.

Frankfurter successfully recommended many bright young lawyers toward public service with the New Deal administration; they became known as &quot;Felix&#x27;s Happy Hot Dogs&quot;. Among the most notable of these were Thomas Corcoran, Donald Hiss and Alger Hiss, and Benjamin Cohen. He moved to Washington, D.C., commuting back to Harvard for classes, but felt that he was never fully accepted within government circles. He worked closely with Louis Brandeis, lobbying for political activities suggested by Brandeis. He declined a seat on the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts and, in 1933, the position of Solicitor General of the United States.
Long an anglophile, Frankfurter had studied at Oxford University in 1920. In 1933–34 he returned to act as visiting Eastman professor in the faculty of Law.

A 1935 newspaper article describes the Happy Hot Dogs as:
* Dean Acheson, Undersecretary of the Treasury
* Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, legal staff member of the Public Works Administration
* James M. Landis, head of the Securities and Exchange Commission
* Alger Hiss, &quot;right hand man&quot; of Solicitor General Stanley Forman Reed, U.S. Department of Justice
* Paul Freund, also legal staff member of the U.S. Department of Justice

Other &quot;Frankfurter men&quot; in the New Deal included:
* Benjamin V. Cohen, legal staff member of the Public Works Administration
* Jerome Frank, counsel to Reconstruction Finance Corporation, former general counsel of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration
* Charles Wyzanski, solicitor of the U.S. Department of Labor
* Thomas Elliott, general counsel for the new social security organization (Social Security Administration)
* Gardner Jackson, formerly assistant consumers&#x27; counsel of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration

Even after his appointment to the Supreme Court, Frankfurter remained close to Roosevelt. In July 1943, on behalf of the President, Frankfurter interviewed Jan Karski, a member of the Polish resistance who had been smuggled into the Warsaw ghetto and a camp near the Belzec death camp in 1942, in order to report back on what is now known as the Holocaust. Frankfurter greeted Karski&#x27;s report with skepticism, later explaining: &quot;I did not say that he was lying, I said that I could not believe him. There is a difference.&quot;

==Supreme Court justice==

Following the death of Supreme Court associate justice Benjamin N. Cardozo in July 1938, President Roosevelt turned to Frankfurter for recommendations of prospective candidates to fill the vacancy. Finding none on the list to suit his criteria, Roosevelt nominated Frankfurter. Frankfurter&#x27;s nomination quickly became highly controversial, and a number of witnesses gave testimony in opposing the nomination during the confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. In addition to the objection that he was considered to be the president&#x27;s unofficial advisor, that he was affiliated with special interest groups, that there were now no justices from west of the Mississippi, opponents pointed to Frankfurter as foreign-born and deemed to be affiliated with an anti-Christian movement viewed as part of a broader Communist infiltration into the country. As a result, the Judiciary Committee requested that Frankfurter appear before it and answer questions from the committee. He agreed, but only to address what he considered to be slanderous allegations against him. He was only the second Supreme Court nominee ever to testify during hearings on their nomination (the first was Harlan F. Stone in 1924), and the first to be requested to do so. Even so, he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by voice vote on January 17, 1939.

Frankfurter served from January 30, 1939, to August 28, 1962. He wrote 247 opinions for the Court, 132 concurring opinions, and 251 dissents. He became the court&#x27;s most outspoken advocate of judicial restraint, the view that courts should not interpret the Constitution in such a way as to impose sharp limits upon the authority of the legislative and executive branches. He also usually refused to apply the federal Constitution to the states. In the case of &quot;Irvin v. Dowd,&quot; Frankfurter stated what was for him a frequent theme: &quot;The federal judiciary has no power to sit in judgment upon a determination of a state court... Something that thus goes to the very structure of our federal system in its distribution of power between the United States and the state is not a mere bit of red tape to be cut, on the assumption that this Court has general discretion to see justice done&quot;.

In his judicial restraint philosophy, Frankfurter was strongly influenced by his close friend and mentor Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who had taken a firm stand during his tenure on the bench against the doctrine of &quot;economic due process&quot;. Frankfurter revered Justice Holmes, often citing Holmes in his opinions. In practice, this meant Frankfurter was generally willing to uphold the actions of those branches against constitutional challenges so long as they did not &quot;shock the conscience&quot;. Frankfurter was particularly well known as a scholar of civil procedure.

Frankfurter&#x27;s adherence to the judicial restraint philosophy was shown in the 1940 opinion he wrote for the court in &quot;Minersville School District v. Gobitis,&quot; a case involving Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses students who had been expelled from school due to their refusal to salute the flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. He rejected claims that First Amendment rights should be protected by law, and urged deference to the decisions of the elected school board officials. He stated that religious belief &quot;does not relieve the citizen from the discharge of political responsibilities&quot; and that exempting the children from the flag-saluting ceremony &quot;might cast doubts in the minds of other children&quot; and reduce their loyalty to the nation. Justice Harlan Fiske Stone issued a lone dissent. The court&#x27;s decision was followed by hundreds of violent attacks on Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses throughout the country. It was overturned in March 1943 by the Supreme Court decision in &quot;West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette&quot;. A frequent ally, Justice Robert H. Jackson, wrote the majority opinion in this case, which reversed the decision only three years prior in poetic passionate terms as a fundamental constitutional principle, that no government authority has the right to define official dogma and require its affirmation by citizens. Frankfurter&#x27;s extensive dissent began by raising and then rejecting the notion that as a Jew, he ought &quot;to particularly protect minorities,&quot; although he did say that his personal political sympathies were with the majority opinion. He reiterated his view that the role of the Court was not to give an opinion of the &quot;wisdom or evil of a law&quot; but only to determine &quot;whether legislators could in reason have enacted such a law&quot;.

In &quot;Baker v. Carr,&quot; Frankfurter&#x27;s position was that the federal courts did not have the right to tell sovereign state governments how to apportion their legislatures; he thought the Supreme Court should not get involved in political questions, whether federal or local. Frankfurter&#x27;s view had won out in the 1946 case preceding &quot;Baker&quot;, &quot;Colegrove v. Green&quot; – there, a 4–3 majority decided that the case was non-justiciable, and the federal courts had no right to become involved in state politics, no matter how unequal district populations had become. But, in the &quot;Baker&quot; case, the majority of justices ruled to settle the matter – saying that the drawing of state legislative districts was within the purview of federal judges, despite Frankfurter&#x27;s warnings that the Court should avoid entering &quot;the political thicket&quot;.

Frankfurter had previously articulated a similar view in a concurring opinion written for &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot; (1951). The decision affirmed, by a 6–2 margin, the conviction of eleven Communist leaders for conspiring to overthrow the US Government under the Smith Act. In it, he again argued that judges &quot;are not legislators, that direct policy-making is not our province.&quot; He recognized that curtailing the free speech of those who advocate the overthrow of government by force also risked stifling criticism by those who did not, writing that &quot;[it] is a sobering fact that in sustaining the convictions before us we can hardly escape restriction on the interchange of ideas.&quot;

A pivotal school desegregation case came before the court in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. The case was scheduled for re-argument when Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, whose crucial vote appeared to be opposed to overruling the pro-segregation precedent in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, died before the court&#x27;s decision was made. Frankfurter reportedly remarked that Vinson&#x27;s death was the first solid piece of evidence he had seen to prove the existence of God, though some believe the story to be &quot;possibly apocryphal&quot;.

Frankfurter demanded that the opinion in &quot;Brown II&quot; (1955) order schools to desegregate with &quot;all deliberate speed&quot;. Some school boards used this phrase as an excuse to defy the demands of the first &quot;Brown&quot; decision. For fifteen years, schools in many states of the South remained segregated; in some cases systems closed their schools, and new private schools were opened by white parents for their children. In &quot;Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education&quot;, the Court wrote, &quot;The obligation of every school district is to terminate dual school systems at once and to operate now and hereafter only unitary schools.&quot; Frankfurter&#x27;s &quot;all deliberate speed&quot; formula was intended to constrain the federal judiciary toward a gradualist approach to school integration, but his formula backfired. By divorcing the plaintiff&#x27;s injury from the remedy afforded, &quot;Brown II&quot; gave birth to modern Public Law Litigation, which today affords federal courts broad power to reform state institutions.

Frankfurter was hands-off in the area of business. In the 1956 government case against DuPont, started because DuPont seemed to have maneuvered its way into a preferential relationship with GM, Frankfurter refused to find a conspiracy, and said the Court had no right to interfere with the progress of business. Here again, Frankfurter opposedand lost out tothe views of the court majority made up of Justices Warren, Black, Douglas and Brennan. Later in his career, Frankfurter&#x27;s judicial restraint philosophy frequently put him on the dissenting side of ground-breaking decisions taken by the Warren Court to end discrimination.

Frankfurter believed that the authority of the Supreme Court would be reduced if it went too strongly against public opinion: he sometimes went to great lengths to avoid unpopular decisions, including fighting to delay court decisions against laws prohibiting racial intermarriage.

For the October 1948 court term, Frankfurter hired William Thaddeus Coleman Jr., the first African American to serve as a Supreme Court law clerk.

In 1960, despite a recommendation from the dean of Harvard Law School, Frankfurter turned down Ruth Bader Ginsburg for a clerkship position because of her gender. She later became an associate justice of the Supreme Court herself, and was the first Jewish woman to do so.

Frankfurter&#x27;s specific seat later came to be informally known as the &quot;Jewish seat,&quot; as between 1932 and 1969 it was occupied by four consecutive Jewish justices: Cardozo, Frankfurter, Goldberg, and Abe Fortas. From 1994 to 2022, the seat was occupied by Stephen G. Breyer, who is also Jewish.

==Relationships with fellow justices==
Throughout his career on the court, Frankfurter was a large influence on many justices, such as Tom C. Clark, Harold Hitz Burton, Charles Evans Whittaker, and Sherman Minton. He generally attempted to influence any new justice coming in, though he managed to repel William J. Brennan Jr. – who had voted with Frankfurter half the time in his first year, but then opposed him after Frankfurter&#x27;s attempts at inculcation. Frankfurter turned against Brennan completely after the case of &quot;Irvin v. Dowd&quot;. Other justices who received the Frankfurter treatment of flattery and instruction were Burton, Fred M. Vinson, and John Marshall Harlan II. With Vinson, who became Chief Justice, Frankfurter feigned deference, though he sought influence. Some, possibly apocryphal, reports have Frankfurter remarking that Vinson&#x27;s death in 1953 was the first solid piece of evidence he had seen to prove the existence of God.

Frankfurter was in his time the leader of the conservative faction of the Supreme Court; he would for many years feud with liberals such as justices Hugo Black and William O. Douglas. He often complained that they &quot;started with a result&quot; and that their work was &quot;shoddy,&quot; &quot;result-oriented,&quot; and &quot;demagogic&quot;. Similarly, Frankfurter panned the work of Chief Justice Earl Warren as &quot;dishonest nonsense&quot;.

Frankfurter saw justices with ideas different from his own as part of a more liberal &quot;Axis&quot; – these opponents were chiefly Black and Douglas, but would also include Frank Murphy and Wiley Blount Rutledge; the group would for years oppose Frankfurter&#x27;s judicially restrained ideology. Douglas, Murphy, and then Rutledge were the first justices to agree with Hugo Black&#x27;s notion that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated the Bill of Rights protection into it; this view would later mostly become law, during the period of the Warren Court. For his part, Frankfurter would assert that Black&#x27;s incorporation theory would usurp state control over criminal justice by limiting states&#x27; development of new interpretations of criminal due process.

Frankfurter&#x27;s argumentative style was not popular among his Supreme Court colleagues. &quot;All Frankfurter does is talk, talk, talk,&quot; Chief Justice Earl Warren complained. &quot;He drives you crazy.&quot; Hugo Black reported that &quot;I thought Felix was going to hit me today, he got so mad.&quot; In the Court&#x27;s biweekly conference sessions, traditionally a period for vote-counting, Frankfurter had the habit of lecturing his colleagues for forty-five minutes at a time or more with his book resting on a podium. Frankfurter&#x27;s ideological opponents would leave the room or read their mail while he lectured.

Frankfurter was close friends with Justice Robert H. Jackson. The two exchanged much correspondence over their mutual dislike for Justice William O. Douglas. Frankfurter also had a strong influence over Jackson&#x27;s opinions.

Frankfurter was universally praised for his work before coming to the Supreme Court, and was expected to influence it for decades past the death of FDR. However, Frankfurter&#x27;s influence over other justices was limited by his failure to adapt to new surroundings, his style of personal relations (relying heavily on the use of flattery and ingratiation, which ultimately proved divisive), and his strict adherence to the ideology of judicial restraint. Michael E. Parrish, professor at UCSD, said of Frankfurter: &quot;History has not been kind to [him]... there is now almost a universal consensus that Frankfurter the justice was a failure, a judge who... became &#x27;uncoupled from the locomotive of history&#x27; during the Second World War, and who thereafter left little in the way of an enduring jurisprudential legacy.&quot;

==Retirement and death==
Frankfurter retired in 1962 after suffering a stroke and was succeeded by Arthur Goldberg. The former justice was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President John F. Kennedy in 1963. Frankfurter died from congestive heart failure in 1965 at the age of 82. His remains are interred in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Legacy==

There are two extensive collections of Frankfurter&#x27;s papers: one at the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress and the other at Harvard University. Both are fully open for research and have been distributed to other libraries on microfilm. However, in 1972 it was discovered that more than a thousand pages of his archives, including his correspondence with Lyndon B. Johnson and others, had been stolen from the Library of Congress; the crime remains unsolved and the perpetrator and motive are unknown.

Frankfurter was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1932 and the American Philosophical Society in 1939.

==Works==
Frankfurter published several books including &quot;Cases Under the Interstate Commerce Act&quot;; &quot;The Business of the Supreme Court&quot; (1927); &quot;Mr. Justice Holmes and the Supreme Court&quot; (1938); &quot;The Case of Sacco and Vanzetti&quot; (1927) and &quot;Felix Frankfurter Reminisces&quot; (1960).

<doc id="356029" wikidata="Q4809126" url="?curid=356029" title="Associate justice">
<text>An associate justice or associate judge (or simply associate) is a judicial panel member who is not the chief justice in some jurisdictions. The title &quot;Associate Justice&quot; is used for members of the Supreme Court of the United States and some state supreme courts, and for some other courts in Commonwealth of Nations countries, as well as for members of the Supreme Court of the Federated States of Micronesia, a former United States Trust Territory. In other common law jurisdictions, the equivalent position is called &quot;Puisne Justice&quot;.

==Commonwealth==
The function of associate justices vary depending on the Court they preside in. In the Australian state of New South Wales, associate justices of the New South Wales Supreme Court hear civil trials and appeals from lower courts amongst other matters. Associate justices can sit either as a single judge or may sit on the New South Wales Court of Appeal. In New Zealand, associate judges of the High Court of New Zealand supervise preliminary processes in most civil proceedings. associate judges have jurisdiction to deal with such matters as: summary judgment applications, company liquidations, bankruptcy proceedings, and some other types of civil proceedings. In the New Zealand legal system, associate judges were formerly known as masters.

==Micronesia==
Under the Constitution of Micronesia, the Supreme Court &quot;consists of the Chief Justice and not more than 5 associate justices&quot;. However, as of October 2020 there are only two associate justices in office: Beauleen Carl-Worswick and Larry Wentworth.

==United States==
In the United States, judicial panels are non-hierarchical, so an associate judge has the same responsibilities with respect to cases as the chief judge but usually has fewer or different administrative responsibilities than the chief.

===Supreme Court===
Under the Judiciary Act of 1869, there are eight Associate Justices on the Supreme Court of the United States. The most junior associate justice (currently Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson) has additional responsibilities to the other associate justices: taking notes of decisions and answering the door in private conference and serving on the Supreme Court&#x27;s cafeteria committee.

<doc id="356035" wikidata="Q3188089" url="?curid=356035" title="Chief justice">
<text>The chief justice is the presiding member of a supreme court in many countries with a justice system based on English common law, such as the Supreme Court of Nepal the High Court of Australia, the Supreme Court of Canada, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, the Supreme Court of Ghana, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal, the Supreme Court of India, the Supreme Court of Ireland, the Supreme Court of Japan, the Supreme Court of Nepal, the Supreme Court of New Zealand, the Supreme Court of Nigeria, the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the Supreme Court of the Philippines, the Supreme Court of Singapore, the Supreme Court of the United States, and provincial or state supreme courts/high courts.

The situation is slightly different in the three legal jurisdictions within the United Kingdom. The courts of England and Wales are headed by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales; in Northern Ireland&#x27;s courts, the equivalent position is the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, and in the courts of Scotland the head of the judiciary of Scotland is the Lord President of the Court of Session, who is also Lord Justice General of Scotland. These three judges are not, though, part of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, which operates across all three jurisdictions and is headed by the President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.
The chief justice can be selected in many ways, but, in many nations, the position is given to the most senior justice of the court, while, in the United States, the chief justice is appointed by the President, subject to approval by the United States Senate. Although the title of this top American jurist is, by statute, Chief Justice of the United States, the term &quot;Chief Justice of the Supreme Court&quot; is often used unofficially.

In some courts, the chief justice has a different title, e.g. &quot;President&quot; of the supreme court. In other courts, the title of chief justice is used, but the court has a different name, e.g. the Supreme Court of Judicature in colonial (British) Ceylon, the Constitutional Court of South Africa, and the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia (in the US state of West Virginia).

==Competence==
The chief justice&#x27;s personal ruling is equal in weight to the rulings of any associate judges on the court.

In several countries, the chief justice is second in line to the office of president or governor general (or third in line, if there is a vice president or lieutenant governor general), should the incumbent die or resign. For example, if the Governor General of Canada is unable to perform the duties of the office, the Chief Justice of Canada performs the duties of the governor general. In India, in the event the President and the Vice- President are unable to discharge the functions due to death, resignation or removal, the Chief Justice of India acts as Officiating President of India.

Apart from their intrinsic role in litigation, they may have additional responsibilities, such as swearing in high officers of state; for instance, the Chief Justice of the United States traditionally administers the oath of office at the inauguration ceremony of the President of the United States, as does the Chief Justice of South Africa at the inauguration of the President of South Africa. In some countries, such as the United States, the chief justice is also responsible for presiding over certain legislative matters, such as during the impeachment trial of a president.

<doc id="356036" wikidata="Q3435746" url="?curid=356036" title="CU–SGP">
<text>Christian Union–SGP () is a collaboration between the Dutch political parties Christian Union (CU) and Reformed Political Party (SGP). In some municipal elections and Provincial Council elections, the parties submit a joint list. Before the merger of the Reformed Political Alliance (GPV) and the Reformatory Political Federation (RPF) into Christian Union in 2000, these parties also participated in various combinations, including SGP/RPF/GPV. From 1984 to 2019, the parties (or the predecessors of Christian Union) participated jointly in the European Parliament elections.

==General==

The RPF, GPV, and SGP differed in their attitudes towards electoral cooperation. Since its founding in 1975, the RPF aimed for &quot;cooperation with other [...] political groups that, like the RPF, advocate policies based on God&#x27;s Word.&quot; The SGP was traditionally committed to independence but collaborated locally with ARP and CHU in the 1950s until they merged into the CDA. The GPV had long-standing principled objections to list combinations but became increasingly open to them from the 1980s. For the 1984 European Parliament elections, the GPV – after much internal controversy – agreed to a list combination for the first time.

In the following years, the GPV began to take a more flexible stance towards cooperation. In 1994, objections arose from the SGP after the RPF proposed a female candidate for the joint list for the European Parliament elections. Ultimately, the candidate withdrew, allowing for joint participation. The SGP board then declared that participation in a joint list with a woman remained unacceptable in principle. Only if a joint seat could yield an extra seat or a better position in the composition of the executive board were negotiations possible, but women were still not allowed in an electable position. The RPF and GPV responded by setting rules ensuring they would not be forced to exclude women from joint lists.

== European Parliament ==
In the first European Parliament elections in 1979, the SGP and GPV participated independently. Both parties did not win a seat. Starting in 1984, the parties, together with the RPF, formed a joint list, which did win a seat.

After the first two successful elections, Leen van der Waal was not part of a faction (Non-Inscrits). In 1994, Van der Waal joined the faction Europe of Nations and in 1996 its successor, Independents for a Europe of Nations. Hans Blokland and Van der Waal joined Europe of Democracies and Diversities (EDD) in 1999 when the previous faction reorganized.

In 2004, GPV and RPF merged to form the Christian Union. That year, EDD reorganized again into the Independence/Democracy (IND/DEM).

In 2009, the MEPs from the shared list split into two different factionsy. Peter van Dalen (CU) joined the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR). The SGP, due to its stance on women, was not allowed in the ECR. Bas Belder therefore joined the successor of IND/DEM, Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD). In 2014, the SGP softened its stance on female candidacy, and the party was subsequently admitted into the ECR.

In 2019, however, there was another split when Christian Union left the ECR for the European People&#x27;s Party Group, because radical-right parties like Forum for Democracy (FvD) had joined the ECR. Due to growing disagreements, Christian Union decided in 2022 not to form a joint list in the European Parliament elections on 6 June 2024. SGP managed to get enough votes for a seat, while Christian Union fell just below the threshold.

== House of Representatives ==
In 1973, electoral alliances became possible, and in 1977 the parties formed an electoral alliance at the initiative of the RPF, despite the GPV wanting to ally only with the SGP and not with the RPF. Due to poor results, the GPV chose not to participate in an electoral alliance with the RPF in 1981, leading to an alliance only between the SGP and the RPF. This was so successful for the RPF that the GPV decided to participate again the following year. Since then, there was always an electoral alliance between the three parties (or two parties, after the RPF and GPV merged into the Christian Union) until the abolition of electoral alliances after the 2017 general election.

<text>Giulio Cesare in Egitto (; ; HWV 17), commonly known as , is a dramma per musica (&quot;opera seria&quot;) in three acts composed by George Frideric Handel for the Royal Academy of Music in 1724. The libretto was written by Nicola Francesco Haym who used an earlier libretto by Giacomo Francesco Bussani, which had been set to music by Antonio Sartorio (1676). The opera was a success at its first performances, was frequently revived by Handel in his subsequent opera seasons and is now one of the most often performed Baroque operas.

The opera&#x27;s plot is loosely based on historical events during the Roman Civil War of 49–45 BC.

==Composition history==
&quot;Giulio Cesare in Egitto&quot; was first performed at the King&#x27;s Theatre in the Haymarket, London on 20 February 1724. The opera was an immediate success. A contemporary wrote in a letter on 10 March 1724: ...the opera is in full swing also, since Hendell&#x27;s new one, called Jules César – in which Cenesino and Cozzuna shine beyond all criticism – has been put on. The house was just as full at the seventh performance as at the first.

Handel revived the opera (with various changes) three times during his lifetime: in 1725, 1730, and 1732.

The roles of Cesare and Cleopatra were originally sung by the castrato Senesino and the famous soprano Francesca Cuzzoni respectively. Handel composed eight arias and two recitatives &quot;accompagnati&quot; for each singer, thus making full use of their vocal capabilities. Curio and Nireno were not allotted any arias in the original version, only singing in recitatives, although they take part in the first and final choruses. However, Handel composed an aria for Nireno for a later revival in 1730.

Although a caricature, the contemporary engraving of Senesino on the left, Francesca Cuzzoni and castrato Gaetano Berenstadt on the right, provides valuable information about the visual aspect of the original performances of Handel operas. The illustration is probably of a scene from Handel&#x27;s &quot;Flavio&quot;, presented by the Royal Academy of Music in 1723, although it has sometimes been identified as a scene from &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;. The elongated bodies of the castrati tower over Cuzzoni, who was described by Horace Walpole as &quot;short and squat&quot;. The set is architectural and generic, not a specific locale, and the costumes for the men are also generic, with some inspiration from ancient Roman military attire; breastplates, armoured skirts and leg armour, combined with plumes on the headdresses. Such costumes were worn by the leading men in Handel operas whether the setting was ancient Rome or Gothic Europe. Cuzzoni, in contrast, wears a contemporary gown such as might have been suitable for presentation at court, with a dwarf to serve as her train-bearer.

==Roles==
For the first performances in 1724 Giulio Cesare was scored for 4 horns, 2 oboes, 2 alto recorders, 2 bassoons, transverse flute, first, second and third violins, violas, cello, viola da gamba, harp, theorbo and basso continuo.

==Synopsis==
:Place: Egypt
:Time: 48–47 B.C.

As with most of his other operas, Handel made several revisions to the score of Giulio Cesare for revivals, adding new arias and cutting others. The listing of arias in this synopsis applies to the original 1724 version.

===Abridged plot===
Cesare, in pursuit of his enemy Pompeo, follows him to Egypt. Pompeo&#x27;s wife Cornelia pleads with Cesare to spare her husband. He is about to grant her plea, when the Egyptians led by their boy king Tolomeo bring him the head of Pompeo. Cornelia and Pompeo&#x27;s son Sesto vows to avenge his death. Tolomeo&#x27;s sister Cleopatra desires to depose her brother in order to become the sole ruler of Egypt. She joins Cornelia and Sesto in their plans for vengeance and entreats Cesare to aid her. Following her overtures, Cesare falls in love with Cleopatra. Her brother attempts to assassinate Cesare, but he escapes. It is reported to Cleopatra that Cesare has drowned while in flight. She is taken captive by her brother. Cesare, who has escaped drowning, enters to free his beloved. Tolomeo is slain by Sesto, because he forced himself upon Cornelia against her will. Cesare makes Cleopatra Queen of Egypt and returns to Rome.

===Act 1===

After the overture, the entire cast, except Giulio Cesare, gathers on stage for the opening chorus, a victory song which compares Cesare to Hercules. (Chorus: &quot;Viva, viva il nostro Alcide&quot;). Giulio Cesare and his victorious troops arrive on the banks of the River Nile after defeating Pompeo&#x27;s forces. (Aria: &quot;Presti omai l&#x27;Egizia terra&quot;). Pompeo&#x27;s second wife, Cornelia, begs for mercy for her husband&#x27;s life. Cesare agrees, but on the condition that Pompeo must see him in person. Achilla, the leader of the Egyptian army, presents Cesare with a casket containing Pompeo&#x27;s head. It is a token of support from Tolomeo, the co-ruler of Egypt (together with Cleopatra, his sister). Cornelia faints, and Cesare is furious about Tolomeo&#x27;s cruelty. (Aria: &quot;Empio, dirò, tu sei&quot;). Cesare&#x27;s assistant, Curio, offers to avenge Cornelia, hoping that she will fall for him and marry him. Cornelia rejects the offer in grief, saying that another death would not relieve her pain. (Aria: &quot;Priva, son d&#x27;ogni conforto&quot;). Sesto, son of Cornelia and Pompeo, swears to take revenge for his father&#x27;s death. (Aria: &quot;Svegliatevi nel core&quot;). Cleopatra decides to use her charm to seduce Cesare. (Aria: &quot;Non disperar, chi sà?&quot;) Achilla brings the news to Tolomeo that Cesare was furious over the murder of Pompeo. Tolomeo swears to kill Cesare to protect his rule of the kingdom. (Aria: &quot;L&#x27;empio, sleale, indegno&quot;). Cleopatra (in disguise) goes to meet Cesare in his camp hoping that he will support her as the queen of Egypt. Cesare is amazed by her beauty. (Aria: &quot;Non è si vago e bello&quot;). Nireno notes that the seduction was successful. (Aria: &quot;Tutto può donna vezzosa&quot;). Meanwhile, Cornelia continues to mourn the loss of her husband. (Arioso: &quot;Nel tuo seno, amico sasso&quot;). Cornelia prepares to kill Tolomeo to avenge Pompeo&#x27;s death, but is stopped by Sesto, who promises to do it instead. Cesare, Cornelia and Sesto go to the Egyptian palace to meet Tolomeo. (Aria: &quot;Cara speme, questo core&quot;). Cleopatra now believes that as she has turned Cesare, Cornelia and Sesto against Tolomeo successfully, the scales are tipped in her favour. (Aria: &quot;Tu la mia stella sei&quot;). Cesare meets Tolomeo, who offers him a room in the royal apartments, though Cesare tells Curio that he expects Tolomeo to betray him. (Aria: &quot;Va tacito e nascosto&quot;). Tolomeo is fascinated by Cornelia&#x27;s beauty but has promised Achilla that he could have her. (Aria: &quot;Tu sei il cor di questo core&quot;). Sesto attempts to challenge Tolomeo, but is unsuccessful. When Cornelia rejects Achilla, he orders the soldiers to arrest Sesto. (Duet: &quot;Son nata a lagrimar&quot;).

===Act 2===
In Cleopatra&#x27;s palace, while in disguise as &quot;Lidia&quot;, she uses her charms to seduce Cesare. (Aria: &quot;V&#x27;adoro, pupille&quot;). She sings praises of Cupid&#x27;s darts and Cesare is delighted. Cesare is smitten with Cleopatra, and Nireno tells Cesare that &quot;Lidia&quot; is waiting for him. (Aria: &quot;Se in fiorito ameno prato&quot;). In Tolomeo&#x27;s palace, Cornelia laments her fate. (Arioso: &quot;Deh piangete, oh mesti lumi&quot;). Achilla pleads with Cornelia to accept him, but she rejects him. (Aria: &quot;Se a me non sei crudele&quot;) When he leaves, Tolomeo also tries to win her, but is also rejected. (Aria: &quot;Sì spietata, il tuo rigore&quot;). Thinking that there is no hope, Cornelia tries to take her own life, but is stopped by Sesto, who is escorted by Nireno. Nireno reveals the bad news that Tolomeo has given orders for Cornelia to be sent to his harem. However, Nireno also comes up with a plan to sneak Sesto into the harem together with Cornelia, so Sesto can kill Tolomeo when he is alone and unarmed. (Aria: &quot;Cessa omai di sospirare&quot;). Sesto enters the garden of the palace, wishing to fight Tolomeo for killing his father. (Aria: &quot;L&#x27;angue offeso mai riposa&quot;). Meanwhile, Cleopatra waits for Cesare to arrive in her palace. (Aria: &quot;Venere bella&quot;). Still smitten with her, Cesare arrives in Cleopatra&#x27;s palace. However, Curio suddenly bursts in and warns Cesare that he has been betrayed, and enemies are approaching Cesare&#x27;s chambers and chanting &quot;Death to Cesare&quot;. Cleopatra reveals her identity and after hearing the enemies heading for them, asks Cesare to flee, but he decides to fight. (Aria: &quot;Al lampo dell&#x27;armi&quot;). (Chorus: &quot;Morà, Cesare morà&quot;). Cleopatra, having fallen in love with Cesare, begs the gods to bless him. (Aria: &quot;Se pietà di me non senti&quot;). In Tolomeo&#x27;s palace, Tolomeo prepares to enter his harem. (Arioso: &quot;Belle dee di questo core&quot;). As Tolomeo tries to seduce Cornelia, Sesto rushes in to kill Tolomeo, but is stopped by Achilla. Achilla announces that Cesare (in the attempt to run from soldiers) has jumped from the palace window and died. Achilla asks again for Cornelia&#x27;s hand in marriage but is turned down by Tolomeo. Furious, Achilla leaves. Sesto feels devastated and attempts to kill himself but is prevented from doing so by his mother; he repeats his vow to kill Tolomeo. (Aria: &quot;L&#x27;aure che spira&quot;).

===Act 3===
Furious at Tolomeo for being ungrateful to him despite his loyalty, Achilla plans to defect to Cleopatra&#x27;s side (Aria: &quot;Dal fulgor di questa spada&quot;), but Tolomeo stabs him before he does. As battle rings out between Tolomeo&#x27;s and Cleopatra&#x27;s armies, Tolomeo celebrates his apparent victory against Cleopatra (Aria: &quot;Domerò la tua fierezza&quot;). Cleopatra laments losing both the battle and Cesare (Aria: &quot;Piangerò la sorte mia&quot;). However, Cesare is not dead: he survived his leap and is roaming the desert in search of his troops (Aria: &quot;Aure, deh, per pietà&quot;). While looking for Tolomeo, Sesto finds the wounded, nearly dead Achilla, who hands Sesto a seal authorizing him to command his armies. Cesare appears and demands the seal, promising that he will either save both Cornelia and Cleopatra or die (Aria: &quot;Quel torrente, che cade dal monte&quot;). With Cesare alive and Achilla dead, Sesto&#x27;s spirits lift, and he vows to fight on (Aria: &quot;La giustizia ha già sull&#x27;arco&quot;). Cesare continues on to Cleopatra&#x27;s camp, where a lamenting Cleopatra is overjoyed to see him. (Aria: &quot;Da tempeste il legno infranto&quot;).

In the palace, Sesto finds Tolomeo trying to rape Cornelia and kills him. Having successfully avenged Pompeo, Cornelia and Sesto celebrate Tolomeo&#x27;s death. (Aria: &quot;Non ha più che temere&quot;). The victorious Cesare and Cleopatra enter Alexandria, and Cesare proclaims Cleopatra to be queen of Egypt and promises his support to her and her country. They declare their love for each other (Duet: &quot;Caro! Bella! Più amabile beltà&quot;). Cesare then proclaims Egypt&#x27;s liberation from tyranny, and wishes for the glory of Rome to spread far and wide. For the final chorus, the entire cast (including the dead Achilla and Tolomeo) gathers on stage to celebrate the power of love and the triumph of good over evil (Chorus: &quot;Ritorni omai nel nostro core&quot;).

===Characterisation of roles===

The roles of Cesare and Cleopatra, sung by the castrato Senesino and famous soprano Francesca Cuzzoni respectively, and which encompass eight arias and two recitatives &quot;accompagnati&quot; each, make full use of the vocal capabilities of the singers. Cornelia and Sesto are more static characters because they are completely taken by their primary emotions, she with pain because of her husband&#x27;s death and constantly constrained to defend herself from the advances of Achilla and Tolomeo, and he consumed by vengeance for his father&#x27;s death.

Cleopatra, on the other hand, is a multifaceted character: she uses at first her womanly wiles to seduce Cesare and gain the throne of Egypt, and then becomes totally engaged in the love affair with Cesare. She has great arias of immense dramatic intensity &quot;Se pietà di me non senti&quot; (II, 8) and &quot;Piangerò la sorte mia&quot; (III, 3). Her sensual character is described magnificently in the aria &quot;V&#x27;adoro, pupille&quot;, in which Cleopatra, in the guise of Lidia, appears to Cesare surrounded by the Muses of Parnassus (II, 2). This number calls for two orchestras: one is a small group to play behind the scene with strings with &quot;sordino&quot;, oboe, tiorba, harp, bassoons and viola da gamba concertante.

Curio and Nireno do not get any arias in the original version, only singing recitatives, though they take part in the first and final choruses. However, Handel composed an aria for Nireno for a later revival in 1730.
===Instrumentation===
The opera is scored for transverse flute, two alto recorders, two oboes, two bassoons, four horns, viola da gamba, harp, theorbo, strings and continuo. The basic orchestra consists of oboes, strings and continuo. The horns, divided into four parts, are used in the opening and closing choruses. Other obbligato instruments are used to add orchestral colour to individual arias: a hunting horn for Cesare&#x27;s aria &quot;Va tacito&quot;; divided alto recorders for the central &quot;largo&quot; section of Sesto&#x27;s &quot;Svegliativi nel core&quot;; solo concertato violin and divided bassoons in Cesare&#x27;s aria &quot;Se in fierto&quot;; alto recorders in unison for Cornelia&#x27;s aria &quot;Cesa omai&quot;; a solo violin for Cleopatra&#x27;s aria &quot;Venere bella&quot;; sustained bassoons in unison for Cleopatra&#x27;s aria &quot;Se pieta&quot;; transverse flute, first violins and obbligato cello for Cleopatra&#x27;s aria &quot;Piangero&quot;; divided strings for Cesare&#x27;s arioso-aria &quot;Aure de per pieta&quot;. The final chorus for full orchestra with divided horns has a central interlude in the minor key with a duet for Cesare and Cleopatra accompanied only by oboes and continuo. It is preceded by another duet for Cesare and Cleopatra and an orchestral march with obbligato trumpet (not in the autograph manuscript and not always performed).

The most elaborate and ravishing orchestration occurs at the beginning of act 2 in Cleopatra&#x27;s aria &quot;V&#x27;adoro, pupille&quot; sung in the guise of Lidia to seduce Cesare. On stage there is a tableau of the Temple of Virtue, below Mount Parnassus with a second orchestra or &quot;symphony&quot; of nine instruments played by the muses, with muted strings in the pit. The celestial instruments—oboes, bassoons, viola da gamba, harp, theorbo and strings—are first heard off-stage in a &quot;sinfonia&quot; behind the scene in what Cesare takes to be the &quot;music of the spheres&quot;, before the tableau is revealed on-stage as the music burgeons, with rich arpeggios in the harp, double stopping on the viola da gamba and strumming on the theorbo.

==Performance history and reception==

===Eighteenth century===

====England====

For Handel&#x27;s previous London operas, the scores and selected arias had been made available to the public by the printer and publisher John Walsh. These had proven to be popular and were an extra source of income. Even when printed copies of Handel&#x27;s works were unavailable, Handel—through the offices of his assistant Christopher Smith on Dean Street—would authorise copies to be made in answer to requests from musical societies that wished to mount performances. In the case of &quot;Giulio Cesare,&quot; following the positive public response to the performances, Handel decided to use the printers Cluer and Creake in order to produce pocket-sized vocal scores and songbooks in high quality copper engravings, a time-consuming process. Cluer and Creake produced a first official edition of the vocal score in July 1724. In May 1724, however, an unauthorised edition had appeared printed by Daniel Wright, advertised as being available in &quot;Musick Shops&quot;: Wright, probably acting on behalf of Walsh, had printed the score using a quicker but inferior stamping process on pewter: as a softer metal than copper, pewter could be stamped without raising its temperature.

Later in 1724, several arias or &quot;favourite songs&quot; from the opera were included in the second of two pocket songbooks, &quot;A Pocket Companion for Gentlemen and Ladies&quot;, printed by Cluer and Creake and edited by Richard Neale. The texts were provided in Italian mostly with English translations by Carey, so that the arias could be sung, played on the harpsichord or, in a transposed version, on the transverse flute. The arias included were: &quot;Non e si bello e vago&quot; (&quot;With thee is ev&#x27;ry pleasure beyond expressing&quot;);&quot;Non ha piu che temere&quot; (&quot;My life my only treasure&quot;); &quot;Cara speme&quot; (&quot;Cruel creature&quot;); &quot;Spera ne ingannai&quot;; &quot;La speranza all alma mia&quot; (&quot;Hopes beguiling, pleasures smiling&quot;); &quot;Chi perde un momento&quot; (&quot;While Celia is flying&quot;); &quot;Venere bella&quot; (&quot;Gazing on my idol&quot;); &quot;Se pieta di me non senti&quot; (&quot;Welcome death, oh end my sorrow&quot;); &quot;V&#x27;adoro pupille&quot; (&quot;Lamenting, complaining&quot;); and &quot;Non disperar&quot; (&quot;Oh what a fool was I&quot;). Again the rival publisher and printer produced &quot;The favourite songs in the opera of Julius Caesar&quot; and a sequel in 1724. Some of these songs in the Pocket Companion reappeared in Peter Prelleur&#x27;s &quot;The Modern Musick-Master&quot;, an instructional manual published in 1730 for those learning singing, harpsichord, oboe, flute or violin.

In 1784, during the centenary commemoration of Handel in Westminster Abbey and the London Pantheon, the second of five concerts, held on 27 May in the Pantheon, contained two numbers for Cesare sung by the castrato Pacchierotti—the hunting aria &quot;Va tacito&quot; and the accompanied recitative &quot;Alma del gran Pompeo&quot;. In his account of the performance, attended by George III, Charles Burney wrote of the aria:

Burney described the audience in the Pantheon as restless during the recitative (sung in Italian), remarking that the original opera house audience had been captivated by the dramatic music. He described it as &quot;the finest piece of accompanied recitative, without symphonies, with which I am acquainted. The modulation is learned, and so uncommon, that there is hardly a chord that the ear expects; and yet the words are well expressed, and the phrases pathetic and pleasing.&quot;

This commemoration, mounted on a giant scale, proved so popular that it was repeated in succeeding years.

The dissemination of Handel&#x27;s music from &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; for domestic music-making continued when one of Handel&#x27;s two arrangements of the overture for harpsichord–the less ornamented and polished of the two–was included in Walsh&#x27;s second collection of Handel overtures published in 1727; the chorus with horns was included as a dance. The overture itself was performed separately in concerts, including in London in 1729 and Manchester in 1745. There were also a few concerts in the 1720s where some of the more popular arias were performed. In 1789, following the culmination of Handel Commemoration concerts, a further volume of songs was published in London entitled &quot;Handel&#x27;s songs selected from his most celebrated operas: for the harpsichord, voice, hoboy, or German flute&quot;. Printed by H. Wright in Catherine Street off the Strand and without English translations, it contained the arias &quot;Va tacito&quot;, &quot;Da tempeste&quot;, &quot;Non desperar&quot; and &quot;Venere bella&quot; as well as the duet &quot;Caro, bella, piu amabile belta&quot;. Despite the popularity and dissemination of Handel&#x27;s music, changes in taste resulted in Samuel Arnold staging a revival of &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; in 1787 as a &quot;pasticcio&quot; constructed from the original opera and other operas by Handel. In the accompanying libretto Arnold stated, &quot;The original, however, offering a great number of incongruities, both in the language and the conduct, several material alterations have been thought absolutely necessary, to give the piece a dramatic consistency, and to suit it to the refinement of a modern audience.&quot;

====France====
In the summer of 1724, after the first run of &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; had finished, the London cast gave a private concert performance in Paris at the residence of Pierre Crozat, retired royal treasurer and patron of the arts. Prior to the performance the &quot;Mercure de France&quot; had reported that Italians in the audience in London had rated the opera as a masterpiece. The trip, which lasted from July to September, had initially been planned for the previous year when, following similar favourable newspaper reports, fully staged performances of &quot;Ottone&quot; at the Paris Opera had been envisaged, with financial support from Louis XV. In the event, these plans were abandoned, and Ottone was also performed as a private concert. Senesino had fallen out with the company and Anastasia Robinson could not participate because of the complications in her private life, so a new female singer was brought in to fill the gaps they created, with Durastanti doubling some parts.

====Germany====
Within Handel&#x27;s lifetime, the opera was also performed in Germany. In Braunschweig it was first performed in 1725 with revivals in 1727 and 1733. The opera was sung wholly in Italian using the 1724 London edition, but with some of Cornelia&#x27;s arias altered. Ballets were also inserted for Egyptians at the end of act 1 and for eunuchs and concubines at the end of act 2.

In Hamburg, where Handel had himself been a violinist in the opera orchestra, the arias were sung in Italian but the recitatives were translated into German by the Englishman Thomas Lediard. He also designed the stage set. The score was modified and augmented by the musician J. G. Linike: he added orchestral accompaniments in some of the recitatives and introduced six ballet scenes, with one for Cleopatra&#x27;s attendants during the Parnassus scene and a grand ballet before the final chorus. Unlike the Braunschweig performance and perhaps because Linike had recently been to London, not all the male roles were sung by tenors and basses: Cesare was sung by a castrato and Sesto by a soprano. The opera remained in the Hamburg repertoire until 1737, shortly before the demise of the failing company, although one performance in 1726 had an audience of only three and one performance in 1735 was cancelled for lack of an audience.

On 9 June 1727 Lediard devised a special performance in honour of the 68th birthday of George I which was repeated three times; the king unfortunately died two weeks after the event. The spectacle, entitled &quot;The Joy and Happiness of the British Nation,&quot; involved a lengthy sung prologue with illuminations and an epilogue with fireworks ignited within the opera theatre. The entertainments were set to music by Georg Philipp Telemann with trumpets, horns and drums played from the galleries which contrasted with the flutes and violins that accompanied the Roman gods and nymphs on stage for the prologue. At the base of a large sculpture of George I, suitably attired singers portrayed Britain, Ireland, France, America and the House of Hanover. In the epilogue gods of water and wind were joined by personifications of the rivers Thames and Isis, with the backdrop changing from the dreaming spires of Oxford to the night sky over London with ships on the river. A &quot;Martial Symphony&quot; ended with the firing of 45 cannons heralding the firework display, after which all the windows and skylights in the theatre had to be opened to release the smoke.

===Nineteenth century===

The nineteenth century saw the publication by Breitkopf &amp; Härtel of the complete works of Handel for the &quot;Händel-Gesellschaft&quot; with Friedrich Chrysander as editor. He produced a comprehensive full score in 1875, using all the available sources in London including those in the Royal Collection; Chrysander&#x27;s volume gave all the variants in the different revivals. Like Handel&#x27;s other works in the opera seria genre, however, there were no public performances of &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; in the 19th century; opera seria had been supplanted by oratorios in the English language with large scale choral writing. By the early nineteenth century operas with librettos by Bussani or music by Handel had become obsolete; the opera &quot;Giulio Cesare in Egitto&quot; performed in the Teatro Argentina in Rome in 1821 was by Giovanni Pacini.

Of the fifty two songs from operas and oratorios in the &quot;Royal Edition&quot; selected by William Thomas Best in 1880, with English translations of the Italian texts by Maria X. Hayes, only three came from &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;, all for Cleopatra: &quot;Piangerò la sorte mia&quot; (&quot;Hope, no more this heart sustaining&quot;); &quot;V&#x27;adoro, pupille, saette d&#x27;amore&quot; (&quot;Ye dear eyes so tender&quot;); and &quot;Da tempeste&quot; (&quot;When by storms&quot;). Chrysander&#x27;s faithful rendition of Handel&#x27;s original score was accompanied in 1878 by a seven volume compendium of opera and oratorio songs prepared for Breitkopf &amp; Hārtel by Victorie Gervinus, widow of the Handel scholar Georg Gottfried Gervinus. The possible voice types—soprano, mezzo-soprano, alto, tenor, bass—are given for each aria or recitative. All the texts were in German with no reference to Italian or English; and in all the seven volumes there are only six numbers from &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;: &quot;Alma del gran Pompeo&quot; (Vol. 1), &quot;Priva son d&#x27;ogni conforta&quot; (Vol.2), &quot;V&#x27;adoro pupille&quot; (Vol. 3), &quot;Svegliatevi nel core&quot; (Vol. 4), &quot;Nel tuo seno, amico sasso&quot; and &quot;Tutto può donna vezzosa&quot; (Vol. 5).

===Twentieth century===
Handel&#x27;s operas were revived in the twentieth century by Oskar Hagen and other Handel enthusiasts in Göttingen, starting with &quot;Rodelinda&quot; in 1920 and &quot;Ottone&quot; in 1921. The first performance of &quot;Giulo Cesare&quot; was on 5 July 1922, with designs reminiscent of expressionist art, Bauhaus and silent film. Hagen&#x27;s performing edition was significantly altered from Handel&#x27;s score: it was translated into German, heavily edited and reorchestrated, with the male castrato roles transposed down for baritone, tenor or bass. As well as local singers for the chorus, the cast included Wilhelm Guttmann as Cesare, Thyra Hagen-Leisner as Cleopatra, Bruno Bergmann as Tolomeo, Eleanor Reynolds as Cornelia and G. A. Walter as Sesto. Hagen&#x27;s vocal score was published by C. F. Peters and the version became popular throughout Germany, with performances in over 38 different localities within 5 years: Hans Knappertsbusch and Karl Böhm both conducted it in Munich in 1923; and it was also performed in neighbouring countries such as Austria (Vienna), Switzerland (Basel, Zürich, Bern), Denmark (Copenhagen) and Poland (Poznań).

The first American performance took place at the Smith College of Music in Northampton, Massachusetts, on 14 May 1927. The first British revival of a Handel opera was the staging of &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; at the Scala Theatre in London in 1930, by the London Festival Opera Company, singing in English.

In 1966, the New York City Opera revived the then virtually unknown opera seria with Norman Treigle as Cesare and Beverly Sills as Cleopatra. Sills&#x27; performance in the production, and on the cast recording that followed, made her an international opera star.

&quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; is now regularly performed.

The first uncut performance of modern times with the voices at correct pitch did not take place until 1977 at the Barber Institute of Fine Arts in Birmingham, England. It has subsequently proven to be by far the most popular of Handel&#x27;s operas, with more than two hundred productions in many countries.

Glyndebourne&#x27;s 2005 production of Giulio Cesare by David McVicar has been described as &quot;the audience&#x27;s touchstone&quot; for the work, in part through its Bollywood-inspired choreography. Danielle de Niese, starring as Cleopatra, was widely praised and would later marry Gus Christie, the owner of Glyndebourne. The production has been repeated at Glyndebourne in 2006, 2009, 2018 and 2024. The 2005 production was received negatively by Michael Tanner in The Spectator, who described as the &quot;slaughter of a masterpiece&quot;, but in 2024, Richard Bratby praised the production in The Spectator, claiming it had aged &quot;like wine&quot;.

In modern productions, the title role, written for a castrato, is sung by a contralto, mezzo-soprano, or, more frequently in recent years, a countertenor. The roles of Tolomeo and Nireno are normally sung by countertenors. The role of Sesto, written for a soprano, is now usually sung by a mezzo-soprano.

The work is considered by many to be one of Handel&#x27;s finest Italian operas, possibly even the best in the history of opera seria. It is admired for its superb vocal writing, its dramatic impact, and its deft orchestral arrangements.

<doc id="356041" wikidata="Q2921172" url="?curid=356041" title="Left–right political spectrum">
<text>The left–right political spectrum is a system of classifying political positions, ideologies and parties, with emphasis placed upon issues of social equality and social hierarchy. In addition to positions on the left and on the right, there are centrist and moderate positions, which are not strongly aligned with either end of the spectrum. It originated during the French Revolution based on the seating in the French National Assembly.

On this type of political spectrum, left-wing politics and right-wing politics are often presented as opposed, although a particular individual or group may take a left-wing stance on one matter and a right-wing stance on another; and some stances may overlap and be considered either left-wing or right-wing depending on the ideology. In France, where the terms originated, the left has been called &quot;the party of movement&quot; or &quot;liberal&quot;, and the right &quot;the party of order&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot;.

== History ==
=== Origins in the French Revolution ===

The terms &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; first appeared during the French Revolution of 1789 when members of the National Assembly divided into supporters of the Ancien Régime to the president&#x27;s right and supporters of the revolution to his left. One deputy, the Baron de Gauville, explained: &quot;We began to recognize each other: those who were loyal to religion and the king took up positions to the right of the chair so as to avoid the shouts, oaths, and indecencies that enjoyed free rein in the opposing camp&quot;.

When the National Assembly was replaced in 1791 by a Legislative Assembly composed of entirely new members, the divisions continued. &quot;Innovators&quot; sat on the left, &quot;moderates&quot; gathered in the centre, while the &quot;conscientious defenders of the constitution&quot; found themselves sitting on the right, where the defenders of the Ancien Régime had previously gathered. When the succeeding National Convention met in 1792, the seating arrangement continued, but following the coup d&#x27;état of 2 June 1793 and the arrest of the Girondins, the right side of the assembly was deserted and any remaining members who had sat there moved to the centre. Following the Thermidorian Reaction of 1794, the members of the far left were excluded and the method of seating was abolished. The new constitution included rules for the assembly that would &quot;break up the party groups&quot;. Following the Restoration in 1814–1815, political clubs were again formed. The majority ultra-royalists chose to sit on the right. The &quot;constitutionals&quot; sat in the centre while independents sat on the left. The terms extreme right and extreme left, as well as centre-right and centre-left, came to be used to describe the nuances of ideology of different sections of the assembly.

The terms &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; were not used to refer to political ideology per se, but, strictly speaking, to seating in the legislature. After 1848, the main opposing camps were the &quot;democratic socialists&quot; and the &quot;reactionaries&quot; who used red and white flags to identify their party affiliation. With the establishment of the Third Republic in 1871, the terms were adopted by political parties: the Republican Left, the Centre Right and the Centre Left (1871), the Extreme Left (1876) and the Radical Left (1881). The beliefs of the group called the Radical Left were actually closer to the Centre Left than the beliefs of those called the Extreme Left.

Beginning in the early twentieth century, the terms &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; came to be associated with specific political ideologies and were used to describe citizens&#x27; political beliefs, gradually replacing the terms &quot;reds&quot; and &quot;the reaction&quot;. The words Left and Right were at first used by their opponents as slurs. Those on the Left often called themselves &quot;republicans&quot;, which at the time meant favoring a republic over a monarchy, while those on the Right often called themselves &quot;conservatives&quot; By 1914, the Left half of the legislature in France was composed of Unified Socialists, Republican Socialists and Socialist Radicals, while the parties that were called &quot;Right&quot; now sat on the right side. The use of the words Left and Right spread from France to other countries and came to be applied to a large number of political parties worldwide, which often differed in their political beliefs. 

There was asymmetry in the use of the terms Left and Right by the opposing sides. The Right mostly denied that the left–right spectrum was meaningful because they saw it as artificial and damaging to unity. However, the Left, seeking to change society, promoted the distinction. As Alain observed in 1931: &quot;When people ask me if the division between parties of the Right and parties of the Left, men of the Right and men of the Left, still makes sense, the first thing that comes to mind is that the person asking the question is certainly not a man of the Left.&quot; In British politics, the terms &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; came into common use for the first time in the late 1930s in debates over the Spanish Civil War. The Scottish sociologist Robert M. MacIver noted in &quot;The Web of Government&quot; (1947):

The right is always the party sector associated with the interests of the upper or dominant classes, the left the sector expressive of the lower economic or social classes, and the centre that of the middle classes. Historically this criterion seems acceptable. The conservative right has defended entrenched prerogatives, privileges and powers; the left has attacked them. The right has been more favorable to the aristocratic position, to the hierarchy of birth or of wealth; the left has fought for the equalization of advantage or of opportunity, for the claims of the less advantaged. Defence and attack have met, under democratic conditions, not in the name of class but in the name of principle; but the opposing principles have broadly corresponded to the interests of the different classes.

=== Ideological groupings ===
Generally, the left wing is characterized by an emphasis on &quot;ideas such as freedom, equality, fraternity, rights, progress, reform and internationalism&quot; while the right wing is characterized by an emphasis on &quot;notions such as authority, hierarchy, order, duty, tradition, reaction and nationalism&quot;.

Political scientists and other analysts usually regard the left as including anarchists, communists, socialists, democratic socialists, social democrats, left-libertarians, progressives, and social liberals. Movements for racial equality, as well as trade unionism, have also been associated with the left.

Political scientists and other analysts usually regard the right as including conservatives (among whom there are many strains, including traditionalist conservatism, libertarian conservatism, neoconservatism, and ultraconservatism); right-libertarians, anarcho-capitalists, monarchists, fascists, and reactionaries.

Various political ideologies, such as Christian democracy, some forms of liberalism, and radical centrism, can be classified as centrist.

A number of significant political movements do not fit precisely into the left–right spectrum, including Christian democracy, and regionalism. Though nationalism is generally regarded as a right-wing doctrine, some nationalists favor egalitarian distributions of resources. There are also civic nationalists, as well as left-wing nationalists. Populism is regarded as having both left-wing and right-wing manifestations in the form of left-wing populism and right-wing populism, respectively. Green politics is generally regarded as a movement of the left, although there are also green conservatives. Andrew Dobson suggests that green politics contains an inherent conservatism as it is &quot;adverse to anything but the most timid engineering of the social and natural world by human beings&quot;.

=== Political parties ===

Political scientists have made models in which the ideologies of political parties are mapped along a single left–right axis. Klaus von Beyme categorized European parties into nine families, which described most parties. Beyme was able to arrange seven of them from left to right: communist, socialist, green, liberal, Christian democratic, conservative and right-wing extremist. The position of agrarian and regional/ethnic parties varied. A study conducted in the late 1980s on two bases, positions on ownership of the means of production and positions on social issues, confirmed this arrangement.

There has been a tendency for party ideologies to persist and values and views that were present at a party&#x27;s founding have survived. However, they have also adapted for pragmatic reasons, making them appear more similar. Seymour Martin Lipset and Stein Rokkan observed that modern party systems are the product of social conflicts played out in the last few centuries. They said that lines of cleavage had become &quot;frozen&quot;.

The first modern political parties were liberals, organized by the middle class in the 19th century to protect them against the aristocracy. They were major political parties in that century, but declined in the twentieth century as first the working class came to support socialist parties and economic and social change eroded their middle class base. Conservative parties arose in opposition to liberals to defend aristocratic privilege, but to attract voters they became less doctrinaire than liberals. However, they were unsuccessful in most countries and generally have been able to achieve power only through cooperation with other parties.

Socialist parties were organized to achieve political rights for workers and were originally allied with liberals. However, they broke with the liberals when they sought worker control of the means of production. Christian democratic parties were organized by Catholics who saw liberalism as a threat to traditional values. Although established in the 19th century, they became a major political force following the Second World War. Communist parties emerged following a division within socialism first on support of the First World War and then support of the Bolshevik Revolution. Right-wing extremist parties are harder to define other than being more right-wing than other parties, but include fascists and some extreme conservative and nationalist parties. Green parties were the most recent of the major party groups to develop. They have mostly rejected socialism and are very liberal on social issues.

These categories can be applied to many parties outside of Europe. Ware (1996) asserted that in the United States both major parties were liberal, even though there are left–right policy differences between them.

== Contemporary terminology ==

=== Worldwide ===
The left-right political spectrum can change over time in a process that affects the views on politicians from more than one country. In most countries, classical liberalism is thought of as a right-wing ideology, but when classical liberal ideas made their debut, they were thought of as leftist.

=== Western Europe ===
In the 2001 book &quot;The Government and Politics of France&quot;, Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright say that the main factor dividing the left and right wings in Western Europe is class. The left seeks social justice through redistributive social and economic policies, while the right defends private property and capitalism. The nature of the conflict depends on existing social and political cleavages and on the level of economic development.

Left-wing values include the belief in the power of human reason to achieve progress for the benefit of the human race, secularism, sovereignty exercised through the legislature and social justice for all people. To the right, this is regularly seen as anti-clericalism, unrealistic social reform, doctrinaire socialism, class hatred and a way to authoritarianism through the gradual lessening of individual rights in favour for the collective.

The right wing believes in the established church both in itself and as an instrument of social cohesion, and they believe in the need for strong political leadership to minimize social and political divisions. To the left, this is seen as a selfish and reactionary opposition to social justice, a wish to impose doctrinaire religion on the population and a tendency to authoritarianism and repression.

The differences between left and right have altered over time. The initial cleavage at the time of the French Revolution was between supporters of absolute monarchy (the right) and those who wished to limit the king&#x27;s authority (the left). During the 19th century, the cleavage was between monarchists and republicans. Following the establishment of the Third Republic in 1871, the cleavage was between supporters of a strong executive on the right and supporters of the primacy of the legislature on the left.

=== United States ===
A 2005 Harris Poll of American adults showed that the terms &quot;left wing&quot; and &quot;right wing&quot; were less familiar to Americans than the terms &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot;. Peter Berkowitz writes that in the U.S., the term &quot;liberal&quot; &quot;commonly denotes the left wing of the Democratic Party&quot; and has become synonymous with the word &quot;progressive,&quot; a fact that is usefully contextualized for non-Americans by Ware&#x27;s observation that at the turn of the 21st century, both mainstream political parties in the United States, generally speaking, were liberal in the classical sense of the word.

Michael Kazin writes that the left is traditionally defined as the social movement or movements &quot;that are dedicated to a radically egalitarian transformation of society&quot; and suggests that many in the left in the United States who met that definition called themselves by various other terms. Kazin writes that American leftists &quot;married the ideal of social equality to the principle of personal freedom&quot; and that contributed to the development of important features of modern American society, including &quot;the advocacy of equal opportunity and equal treatment for women, ethnic and racial minorities, and homosexuals; the celebration of sexual pleasure unconnected to reproduction; a media and educational system sensitive to racial and gender oppression and which celebrates what we now call multiculturalism; and the popularity of novels and films with a strongly altruistic and anti-authoritarian point of view.&quot; A variety of distinct left-wing movements existed in American history, including labor movements, the Farmer-Labor movement, various democratic socialist and socialist movements, pacifist movements, and the New Left.

== Criticism ==
Political scientists have frequently argued that a single left–right axis is too simplistic and insufficient for describing the existing variation in political beliefs and include other axes to compensate for this problem.

American libertarian writer David Boaz argued that the political terms &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; are used to spin a particular point of view rather than as simple descriptors, with those on the left typically emphasizing their support for working people and accusing the right of supporting the interests of the upper class; and those on the right usually emphasizing their support for individualism and accusing the left of supporting collectivism. Boaz asserts that arguments about the way these terms should be used often displace arguments about policy by raising emotional prejudice against a preconceived notion of what the terms mean.

In 2006, British Prime Minister Tony Blair described the main cleavage in politics as not left versus right, but open versus closed. According to Blair, attitudes towards social issues and globalisation are more important than the conventional economic left–right issues. In this model, &quot;open&quot; voters tend to be culturally liberal, multicultural and in favour of globalisation while &quot;closed&quot; voters are culturally conservative, opposed to immigration and in favour of protectionism. The open–closed political spectrum has seen increased support following the rise of populist and centrist parties in the 2010s.

Norberto Bobbio saw the polarization of the Italian Chamber of Deputies in the 1990s as evidence that the linear left–right axis remained valid. Bobbio thought that the argument that the spectrum had disappeared occurred when either the left or right were weak. The dominant side would claim that its ideology was the only possible one, while the weaker side would minimize its differences. He saw the left and right not in absolute terms, but as relative concepts that would vary over time. In his view, the left–right axis could be applied to any time period.

A survey of Canadian legislative caucuses conducted between 1983 and 1994 by Bob Altemeyer showed an 82% correlation between party affiliation and score on a scale for right-wing authoritarianism when comparing right-wing and social democratic caucuses. There was a wide gap between the scores of the two groups, which was filled by liberal caucuses. His survey of American legislative caucuses showed scores by American Republicans and Democrats were similar to the Canadian right and liberals, with a 44% correlation between party affiliation and score.

While in many Western European democracies, traditionally the left is associated with socially liberal and economically left values, while the right is traditionally associated with socially conservative and economically right values, Eastern European, post-communist parties are frequently juxtaposed, with economically left parties holding nationalist positions more frequently and economically right parties being liberal and internationalist.

<text>Yolande Elsa Maria Beekman (7 January 1911 – 13 September 1944) was a British spy in World War II who served in the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) and the Special Operations Executive. She was a member of SOE&#x27;s Musician circuit in occupied France during World War II where she operated as a wireless operator until arrested by the Gestapo. She was subsequently executed at the Dachau concentration camp.

==Early life==
Beekman was born Yolande Elsa Maria Unternährer to a Swiss father and an English mother in Paris. As a child, she moved to London and grew up fluent in English, German, and French. Young Yolande had a gentle disposition and liked to draw, so her family expected that she would become a designer or illustrator. After schooling in England she was sent to a Swiss finishing school.

==Wartime service==
===WAAF and SOE===
When World War II broke out, Beekman joined the WAAF where she trained as a W/T operator. Because of her language skills and wireless expertise, Beekman was recruited by the SOE for work in occupied France, officially joining the SOE on 15 February 1943. She trained with Noor Inayat Khan and Yvonne Cormeau.

In 1943, Beekman married Sergeant Jaap Beekman of the Netherlands Army, whom she had met on the W/T operator&#x27;s course, but a short time after her marriage she said goodbye to her husband and was flown behind enemy lines in France. Beekman was landed in France on the night of 17/18 September 1943, having been flown in a Double Lysander aircraft in operation Millner.

===Lands in France===
In France, Beekman operated the wireless for Gustave Biéler, the Canadian in charge of the Musician circuit at Saint-Quentin in the département of Aisne, using the codenames &quot;Mariette&quot; and &quot;Kilt&quot; (wireless codename), and the alias &quot;Yvonne&quot;. She also transmitted messages for the adjacent Farmer network, headed by Michael Trotobas. Beekman became an efficient and valued agent who, in addition to her all important radio transmissions to London, took charge of the distribution of materials dropped by Allied planes.

Beekman&#x27;s first lodgings were with a long serving résistant and schoolmistress, Mlle Lefevre, but this could only be a temporary stay. At the beginning of October, she moved to the house of Camille Boury, who worked at the Pharmacie Corteel, and lived on the corner of Rue Baudelaire. Odette Gobeaux, who worked with Boury at the pharmacy, offered Beekman the draughty attic of her house from which to transmit.

Beekman began quietly visiting Gobeaux&#x27;s house in Rue de la Fère, letting herself in with her own key during the day, placing her set on a small table and passing the long aerial out through the window above. Interviewed after the war, Gobeaux remembered Beekman often waiting for the next transmission, lying on a divan with her head in a book, apparently unruffled by the possibility of arrest. Eugène Cordelette, one of MUSICIAN&#x27;s lieutenants, later described Bieler and Beekman as being &quot;both of the finest stuff imaginable&quot;, but her training should have left her more mindful of security.

Following her instructions from London, Beekman transmitted using a pre‐arranged schedule (or &quot;sked&quot;), sending messages at specific times and frequencies three times a week. This was standard practice for SOE wireless operators in France, though most would try and set up several sets at different safe houses, switching between them to avoid detection (some safety improvements such as more flexible transmission skeds were introduced only after Beekman was sent to France). Operating from a single static radio post greatly increased the chances of being hunted down by German direction finding (D/F) teams, which were known to prowl the streets of major towns and cities across the country, and it is not clear why Beekman apparently did not use additional hideouts – perhaps it was too difficult to find suitable locations in such a densely populated area, or she might have had technical problems with the wireless sets available.

Beekman&#x27;s steadfast and fearless approach had proved invaluable to the circuit, but her work was becoming riskier every day. German interception of radio signals had become very efficient by this time, and the regular times of her transmissions was helping her pursuers to gradually narrow down the area of the source. Beekman and Bieler spent Christmas Eve at the Bourys&#x27; house; they listened to the BBC and did their best to be festive. On Christmas Day she made contact with London as usual, but the following week a direction finding van was seen passing the house, an ominous sign that the net was closing in. Beekman moved her set to the Boury house, where she was still living, but on 12 January Camille Boury noticed a man walking along the street, with his collar turned up and apparently listening to earphones. Beekman&#x27;s radio signal had been traced to their block.

Beekman immediately packed up her set and moved again, this time to the Café Moulin Brulé, a lonely safe house on the north eastern edge of the city, on the northern bank of the canal. Shaken by her narrow escape, she could rely on the café owners sheltering her for the night.

==Arrest and execution==
===Arrest===
The next day, on the morning of 14 January 1944, Biéler arrived at the café to discuss where she should go next, but the Gestapo were now ready to make their haul. Two men walked in and drew revolvers, arresting all those inside.

===Prison===
Separated from Biéler, who was later executed, Beekman was transported to Fresnes Prison several kilometres outside Paris. Again she was interrogated and brutalized repeatedly. In May 1944, Beekman was moved with several other captured SOE agents to the civilian prison for women at Karlsruhe in Germany, where she encountered a prisoner named Hedwig Müller (a nurse arrested by the Gestapo in 1944). Müller said after the war that Beekman &quot;didn&#x27;t leave her cell much as she suffered badly with her legs.&quot; She was confined there until September 1944, sharing a cell with Elise Johe (a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness), Annie Hagen (arrested for working as a black marketeer) and Clara Frank (jailed for slaughtering a cow on her family farm without permission). While imprisoned, Beekman drew and embroidered. She would take a needle and prick her finger to use the blood as ink and draw on toilet paper as there was no paper and pencils.

===Execution at Dachau===

Beekman was abruptly transferred to Dachau concentration camp with fellow agents Madeleine Damerment, Noor Inayat Khan, and Eliane Plewman. At dawn on the following morning, 13 September, the four women were executed by Wilhelm Ruppert.

A Gestapo man named Max Wassmer was in charge of prisoner transports at Karlsruhe and accompanied the women to Dachau. Another Gestapo man named Christian Ott gave a statement to American investigators after the war as to the fate of Beekman and her three companions. Ott was stationed at Karlsruhe and volunteered to accompany the four women to Dachau as he wanted to visit his family in Stuttgart on the return journey. Though not present at the execution, Ott told investigators what Wassmer had told him.

==Awards and honours==
Beekman&#x27;s actions were recognized by the government of France with the posthumous awarding of the Croix de Guerre. In addition, she is recorded on the Runnymede Memorial in Surrey, England and as one of the SOE agents who died for the liberation of France, she is listed on the &quot;Roll of Honour&quot; on the Valençay SOE Memorial in the town of Valençay, in the Indre département of France. A later memorial, the SOE Agents Memorial in Lambeth Palace Road (Westminster, London), is dedicated to all SOE agents.

<doc id="356046" wikidata="Q932818" url="?curid=356046" title="Ghost crab">
<text>Ghost crabs are semiterrestrial crabs of the subfamily Ocypodinae. They are common shore crabs in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world, inhabiting deep burrows in the intertidal zone. They are generalist scavengers and predators of small animals. The name &quot;ghost crab&quot; derives from their nocturnality and their generally pale coloration. They are also sometimes called sand crabs, though the name refers to various other crabs that do not belong to the subfamily.

Characteristics of the subfamily include one claw being larger than the other, thick and elongated eyestalks, and a box-like body. The differences in claw sizes, however, are not as marked as in male fiddler crabs. The subfamily includes 22 species in two genera.

==Taxonomy==
Ocypodinae is one of two subfamilies in the family Ocypodidae, the other being the fiddler crab subfamily, Ucinae. Both subfamilies have members in which one of the claw-bearing legs (the chelipeds) is much larger than the other. However, only male fiddler crabs exhibit this, while both male and female ghost crabs have unequally sized claws. The difference is also much more pronounced among fiddler crab males. The fiddler crabs&#x27; carapaces are broadened at the front, while the carapaces of ghost crabs are more or less box-like. Lastly, the eyes of ghost crabs have large and elongated eyestalks, with the corneas occupying the entire lower part, while in fiddler crabs the eyestalks are long and thin, with the corneas small and located at the tip.

Ocypodinae was previously regarded as monotypic, with only one genus, &quot;Ocypode&quot;, classified under it. In 2013, though, Katsushi Sakai and Michael Türkay reclassified the gulf ghost crab into a separate genus, &quot;Hoplocypode&quot; based on the differences of their gonopods (appendages modified into copulatory organs) from that of the rest of the members of the genus &quot;Ocypode&quot;.

===Genera===
The subfamily Ocypodinae currently contains 22 species in these two genera:
*&quot;Ocypode&quot; 
*&quot;Hoplocypode&quot; 

==Description==

Most ghost crabs have pale-colored bodies that blend in well with the sand, though they are capable of gradually changing body coloration to match their environments and the time of day. Some species are brightly colored, such as &quot;Ocypode gaudichaudii&quot; and &quot;Ocypode ryderi&quot;.

Ghost crabs have elongated and swollen eyestalks with very large corneas on the bottom half. Their carapaces are deep and box-like, squarish when viewed from the top with straight or slightly curving sides. The regions of the carapace are usually not clearly defined. The &quot;whip&quot; of their antennules (antennular flagella) are small or rudimentary. They fold back into the body diagonally or almost vertically. The plate between them (the interantennular septum) is broad. The third pair of mouth appendages (maxillipeds) completely cover the mouth opening. A small orifice with edges thickly fringed with hair is found between the bases of the second and third pairs of walking legs. 

Ghost crab species can be most reliably identified by means of the area where they were recovered, the presence of &quot;horns&quot; (styles) on their eyestalks (exophthalmy), the pattern of stridulating (sound-producing) ridges on the inside surface of the palms of their larger claws, and the shape of the gonopods in males.

Exophthalmy is exhibited by seven species in the subfamily: &quot;Ocypode brevicornis&quot;, &quot;Ocypode ceratophthalma&quot;, &quot;Ocypode gaudichaudii&quot;, &quot;Ocypode macrocera&quot;, &quot;Ocypode mortoni&quot;, &quot;Ocypode rotundata&quot;, and &quot;Ocypode saratan&quot;. All of them are found in the Indo-Pacific region with more or less limited ranges, with the exception of &quot;Ocypode ceratophthalma&quot;, which is found widely. &quot;Ocypode cursor&quot;, found in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, also possesses a tuft of bristles at the end of its eyestalks.

Stridulating ridges also differ from species to species, with some displaying rows of tubercles, others displaying rows of smaller ridges (striae), or a combination of both. These are very important in identifying species as they are displayed by both adults and juveniles (though they may be absent in newly regenerated claws). They are used by ghost crabs for communication.

Both exophthalmy and stridulating ridges, however, can not be reliably used to determine phylogenetic relationships between different species of ghost crabs. Sakai &amp; Türkay (2013) regarded the shape of the gonopods as more suited for this. As gonopods are important in sexual reproduction, they are less likely to evolve randomly in response to the environment. Ghost crabs of the genus &quot;Hoplocypode&quot; can be distinguished from those in &quot;Ocypode&quot; by examining their gonopods. In the former, the first gonopod has a complex, hoof-shaped tip, while in the latter they are simple and curved.

==Ecology==

Ghost crabs dig deep burrows near the intertidal zone of open sandy beaches. The burrows are usually composed of a long shaft with a chamber at the end, occasionally with a second entrance shaft. They are semi-terrestrial and breathe oxygen from the air through moistened gills. They must periodically wet their gills with seawater, usually by taking water from moist sand or by running into the surf and letting the waves wash over them. However, they can only remain under water for a limited amount of time, as they will drown.

Ghost crabs are generalists, scavenging carrion and debris, as well as preying on small animals, including sea turtle eggs and hatchlings, clams, and other crabs. They are predominantly nocturnal. They remain in their burrows during the hottest part of the day, and throughout the coldest part of the winter.

Ghost crabs are swift runners, darting away at the slightest sign of danger. They either head back to their burrows or into the sea to escape intruders. The gaits of ghost crabs alter as their speed increases. Observations on &quot;O. ceratophthalma&quot; show it can walk indefinitely using all four pairs of walking legs, occasionally alternating which side leads. At higher speeds, the fourth pair of legs is raised off the ground, and at the highest speeds, the crab runs, using only the first and second pairs of walking legs.

Ghost crabs utilize a varied animal acoustic communication system. They can create different sounds by striking the ground with their claws, rubbing their claws together to make a rasping sound, rubbing their legs to make a bubbly noise, and rubbing the teeth inside their stomachs to make a growling sound. The lateral teeth of the gastric mill possess a series of comb-like structures that rub against the median tooth to produce stimulation with dominant frequencies below 2 kHz.

Ghost crabs also have the ability to change colors to match their surroundings by adjusting the concentration and dispersal of pigments within their chromatophores. They can even match the specific colors of the grains of sand in their habitats. However, unlike metachrosis (which is a rapid change of colors), ghost crabs are only capable of morphological color change, which occurs over a longer span of time.

In a study in 1964, individuals of &quot;O. ceratophthalma&quot; in Hawaii from two populations (one from a black-sand beach and the other from a white-sand beach) were observed to markedly differ in pigmentation although they remain morphologically indistinguishable. Specimens taken from the black-sand beach were much darker than the specimens taken from the white-sand beach, exhibiting nearly 12 times as many black chromatophores. When the black-sand specimens were subsequently exposed to a white background, they were observed to gradually become lighter over the course of about a month. The opposite happened to white-sand specimens when placed in black backgrounds.

In a 2013 study in Singapore, &quot;Ocypode ceratophthalma&quot; was also discovered to change color in response to the time of day. In a span of 24 hours, they were observed to alternate between lighter and darker coloration, being lightest at midday and darkest at night. However, when placed in a dark background, the crabs showed no significant changes in coloration. This suggests, at least for short-term color changes, they follow a day-night cycle to determine body coloration; basing it on their biological clocks rather than on the brightness or darkness of their environments. The researchers believe relying on the time of day rather than ambient light is more advantageous for survival in ghost crabs. It lets ghost crabs avoid changing color when in temporary shadow (for example within their burrows) and thus still remain inconspicuous when they are once again illuminated by daylight. However, this behavior is only exhibited by juveniles.

Ghost crabs lay their eggs in the sea, which develop into planktonic marine larvae.

==Distribution==
Ghost crabs dominate sandy shores in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, replacing the sandhoppers that predominate in cooler areas. Three species are found in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, and two occur in the eastern Pacific coast of the Americas. The rest of the species are found in the western Pacific and the Indian Ocean to the tip of southern Africa.

==Conservation==
Ghost crabs are negatively affected by human activity on sandy beaches, such as sand trampling by foot traffic, the building of seawalls, or the presence of inorganic pollutants. Due to their worldwide distribution and the ease by which their burrows can be surveyed, ghost crab burrows are regarded as valuable ecological indicators for quickly assessing the impact of human disturbance on beach habitats.

<doc id="356049" wikidata="Q1238790" url="?curid=356049" title="River Exe">
<text>The River Exe ( ) is a river in England that rises at Exe Head, near the village of Simonsbath, on Exmoor in Somerset, from the Bristol Channel coast, but flows more or less directly due south, so that most of its length lies in Devon. It flows for 60 miles (96 km) and reaches the sea at a substantial ria, the Exe Estuary, on the south (English Channel) coast of Devon. Historically, its lowest bridging point was the Old Exe Bridge in Exeter, the largest settlement on the river, but there is now a viaduct for the M5 motorway about south of the city centre.

==Topography==
The river&#x27;s name derives from *uɨsk, a Common Brittonic root meaning &quot;abounding in fish&quot;, and a cognate of both the Irish &quot;iasc&quot;, meaning &quot;fish&quot;, and &quot;pysg&quot;, the plural word for &quot;fish&quot; in Welsh. The same root separately developed into the English Axe and Esk, the Welsh Usk, though not, as some have claimed, the word &quot;whisky&quot;, this latter being from the Classical Irish/Gaelic &quot;water&quot; (the fuller phrase being ; ; ; &quot;&quot; (&quot;water of life&quot;)).

The river&#x27;s name occurs in Exeter (&quot;fortress on the Exe&quot;) and many other settlements along its course, including Exford, Up Exe, Nether Exe, Exwick, Exton, Exminster, and Exebridge, where it is joined by the River Barle. The seaside town of Exmouth is at the east side of the estuary mouth, and Dawlish Warren is at the west, with its long sand spit extending across the mouth.

The river fuelled Exeter&#x27;s growth and relative importance in medieval times. The city&#x27;s first industrial area was developed at Exe Island, which was created in the 10th century by digging a series of leats into the sandy and marshy land bordering the river. The island became home to numerous watermills producing paper and textiles.

Tides on the river are limited at Trews Weir in Exeter, two kilometres upstream of Countess Wear, the site of a former weir commissioned by the Countess of Devon in the 13th century. The Exeter Canal bypassed this weir to enable ships to reach Exeter Quay. At high tide, the estuary forms a large body of water that is heavily used for water sports, especially sailing, windsurfing and water skiing.

Railways run along both sides of the estuary. The Avocet Line from Exeter to Exmouth on the eastern side, and the South Devon main line on the western. The latter is on a causeway, the South Devon Railway sea wall from Powderham to Dawlish Warren. The Exmouth to Starcross Ferry carries passengers across the mouth of the estuary during the summer months, linking the harbour at Exmouth with a pier adjacent to Starcross railway station on the South Devon main line.

At low tide, extensive mud flats are exposed, and these are an important feeding source for wading birds. Along with other rias in South West England, the Exe estuary is an important site for wintering waders. Dawlish Warren is a favoured site for birdwatching. The river has a low pH but does not suffer from a serious acid rain problem. It is populated with wild brown trout, and in the lower reaches coarse fish including dace, chub, perch, roach, pike and bream and some grayling, the average size being . There is a run of Atlantic salmon and a sparse run of sea trout. Just below the union of the River Barle is Black Pool, which is one of the best, and highest salmon pools on the river. The smaller fish species present include stone loach and there are good reasons to assume others are present.

==2008 clearing operation==
In 2008 the Environment Agency embarked on a project to clear vegetation from the river in Exeter as well as make way for flood defence work. In order to do the former the water level was lowered further than during the worst droughts that Exeter had seen.

<doc id="356050" wikidata="Q410346" url="?curid=356050" title="Lamotrigine">
<text>Lamotrigine, sold under the brand name Lamictal among others, is a medication used to treat epilepsy and stabilize mood in bipolar disorder. For epilepsy, this includes focal seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, and seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In bipolar disorder, lamotrigine has not been shown to reliably treat acute depression in any groups except for the severely depressed; but for patients with bipolar disorder who are not currently symptomatic, it appears to reduce the risk of future episodes of depression. Lamotrigine is also used off label for unipolar depression (major depressive disorder) and depersonalization-derealization disorder.
Common side effects include nausea, sleepiness, headache, vomiting, trouble with coordination, and rash. Serious side effects include excessive breakdown of red blood cells, increased risk of suicide, severe skin reaction (Stevens–Johnson syndrome), and allergic reactions, which can be fatal. Lamotrigine is a phenyltriazine, making it chemically different from other anticonvulsants. Its mechanism of action is not clear, but it appears to inhibit release of excitatory neurotransmitters via voltage-sensitive sodium channels and voltage-gated calcium channels in neurons.
Lamotrigine was first marketed in Ireland in 1991, and approved for use in the United States in 1994. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the most commonly prescribed mood stabilizer and 58th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 11million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
===Epilepsy===
Lamotrigine is considered a first-line drug for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (includes simple partial, complex partial, and secondarily generalized seizures such as focal-onset tonic-clonic seizures). It is also used as an alternative or adjuvant medication for partial seizures, such as absence seizure, myoclonic seizure, and atonic seizures. The evidence supporting the use of lamotrigine as an add-on therapy for drug-resistant generalized tonic-clonic seizures is not clear enough to inform clinical practice. Although low-certainty evidence suggests that it reduces generalized tonic-clonic seizures by 50% the level of uncertainty indicates that the actual findings could be significantly different. Evidence supporting the use of lamotrigine as an add-on therapy for drug-resistant focal epilepsy found that it is likely effective for reducing seizure frequency and is generally well tolerated. Lamotrigine has some side effects including a risk of dizziness, nausea, ataxia, or visual disturbances such as diplopia. The long-term effects of lamotrigine have not been investigated.

====Lennox–Gastaut syndrome====
Lamotrigine is one of a small number of FDA-approved therapies for the form of epilepsy known as Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. It reduces the frequency of LGS seizures, and is one of two medications known to decrease the severity of drop attacks. Combination with valproate is common, but this increases the risk of lamotrigine-induced severe skin reaction Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and necessitates reduced dosing due to the interaction of these drugs.

===Bipolar disorder===
Lamotrigine is approved in the US for maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder. While the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproate are predominantly antimanics, lamotrigine has demonstrated efficacy only in preventing or reducing the risk of recurrent depressive episodes of bipolar disorder. The drug seems ineffective in the treatment of current rapid-cycling, acute mania, or acute depression in bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine has been shown to be as effective as lithium, the standard treatment for bipolar disorder.

Lamotrigine has not demonstrated clear efficacy in treating acute mood episodes, either mania or depression. It has not demonstrated effectiveness in treating acute mania, and there is controversy regarding the drug&#x27;s effectiveness in treating acute bipolar depression. A paper written in 2008 by Nassir et al. reviewed evidence from trials that were unpublished and not referenced in the 2002 APA guidelines, and it concludes that lamotrigine has &quot;very limited, if any, efficacy in the treatment of acute bipolar depression&quot;. A 2008 paper by Calabrese et al. examined much of the same data, and found that in five placebo-controlled studies, lamotrigine did not significantly differ from placebo in the treatment of bipolar depression. However, in a meta-analysis of these studies conducted in 2008, Geddes, Calabrese, and Goodwin found that lamotrigine was effective in individuals with bipolar depression, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 11, or 7 in severe depression.

A 2013 review concluded that lamotrigine is recommended in bipolar maintenance when depression is prominent and that more research is needed regarding its role in the treatment of acute bipolar depression and unipolar depression. No information to recommend its use in other psychiatric disorders was found.

===Schizophrenia===
Lamotrigine, as a monotherapy, is not substantially effective against schizophrenia. However, various publications and textbooks have expressed that lamotrigine could be added to clozapine as augmentation therapy against partial or non-responding patients with schizophrenia. Patients had statistically significant improvements in positive, negative and affective symptoms. Lamotrigine does not have a statistically significant effect with antipsychotics other than clozapine, such as: olanzapine, risperidone, haloperidol, zuclopenthixol, etc.

===Other uses===
Off-label uses include the treatment of major depressive disorder, peripheral neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, cluster headaches, migraines, visual snow, and reducing neuropathic pain from any cause, although a systematic review conducted in 2013 concluded that well-designed clinical trials have shown no benefit for lamotrigine in neuropathic pain. Off-label psychiatric usage includes the treatment of treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder, depersonalization derealization disorder, hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and borderline personality disorder. It has not been shown to be useful in post-traumatic stress disorder.

GlaxoSmithKline investigated lamotrigine for the treatment of ADHD with inconclusive results. No detrimental effects on cognitive function were observed; however, the only statistical improvement in core ADHD symptoms was an improvement on a Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test that measures auditory processing speed and calculation ability. Another study reported that lamotrigine might be a safe and effective treatment option for adult ADHD comorbid with &quot;bipolar&quot; and recurrent depression.

==Side effects==
Side effects such as rash, fever, and fatigue are very serious, as they may indicate incipient SJS, TEN, DRESS syndrome, or aseptic meningitis.

Lamotrigine prescribing information has a black box warning about life-threatening skin reactions, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS), DRESS syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The manufacturer states that nearly all cases appear in the first two to eight weeks of therapy. Patients should seek medical attention for any unexpected skin rash, as its presence is an indication of a possible serious or even deadly side effect of the drug. Not all rashes that occur while taking lamotrigine progress to SJS or TEN. Between 5 and 10% of patients will develop a rash, but only one in a thousand patients will develop a serious rash. Rash and other skin reactions are more common in children, so this medication is often reserved for adults. For patients whose lamotrigine has been stopped after the development of a rash, rechallenge with lamotrigine is also a viable option. Usually, rechallenge is done by reinstating lamotrigine at a smaller dose (5mg/day). However, it does not apply to very serious cases. The incidence of these eruptions increases in patients who are currently on, or recently discontinued a valproate-type anticonvulsant drug, as these medications interact in such a way that the clearance of both is decreased and the effective dose of lamotrigine is increased.

In 2018, the FDA required a new warning for the risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. This serious reaction can occur between days to weeks after starting the treatment.

Other side effects include alopecia (hair loss), loss of balance or coordination, double vision, crossed eyes, pupil constriction, blurred vision, dizziness and lack of coordination, drowsiness, insomnia, anxiety, vivid dreams or nightmares, dry mouth, mouth ulcers, memory problems, mood changes, itchiness, runny nose, cough, nausea, indigestion, abdominal pain, weight loss, missed or painful menstrual periods, and vaginitis. The side-effects profile varies for different patient populations. Overall adverse effects in treatment are similar between men, women, geriatric, pediatric, and racial groups.

Lamotrigine has been associated with a decrease in white blood cell count (leukopenia). Lamotrigine does not prolong QT/QTc in TQT studies in healthy subjects.

In people taking antipsychotics, cases of lamotrigine-precipitated neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported.

===Women===
Women are more likely than men to have side effects.

Some evidence shows interactions between lamotrigine and female hormones, which can be of particular concern for women on estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives. Ethinylestradiol, an ingredient of such contraceptives, has been shown to decrease serum levels of lamotrigine. Women starting an estrogen-containing oral contraceptive may need to increase the dosage of lamotrigine to maintain its level of efficacy. Likewise, women may experience an increase in lamotrigine side effects upon discontinuation of birth control pills. This may include the &quot;pill-free&quot; week where lamotrigine serum levels have been shown to increase twofold.
Many studies have found no association between lamotrigine exposure &quot;in utero&quot; and birth defects, while those that have found an association have found only slight associations with minor malformations such as cleft palates. Review studies have found that overall rates of congenital malformations in infants exposed to lamotrigine &quot;in utero&quot; are relatively low (1–4%), which is similar to the rate of malformations in the general population. It is known that lamotrigine is a weak inhibitor of human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and other, more powerful, human DHFR inhibitors such as methotrexate are known to be teratogenic.

Lamotrigine is expressed in breast milk; the manufacturer recommends carefully weighing the benefits and risks of taking lamotrigine while breastfeeding. However, some studies suggest that lamotrigine is safe to use while breastfeeding. A frequently updated review of scientific literature rates lamotrigine as L3: moderately safe.

===Other types of effects===
Lamotrigine binds to melanin-containing tissues such as the iris of the eye or melanin-rich skin. The long-term consequences of this are unknown.

Lamotrigine is known to affect sleep. Studies with small numbers of patients (10–15) reported that lamotrigine increases the duration of REM sleep, decreases the number of phase shifts, and decreases the duration of slow-wave sleep, and that there was no effect on vigilance, daytime somnolence and cognitive function. However, a retrospective study of 109 patients&#x27; medical records found that 6.7% of patients experienced an &quot;alerting effect&quot; resulting in intolerable insomnia, for which the treatment had to be discontinued.

Lamotrigine can induce a type of seizure known as a myoclonic jerk, which tends to happen soon after the use of the medication. When used in the treatment of myoclonic epilepsies such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, lower doses (and lower plasma levels) are usually needed, as even moderate doses of this drug can induce seizures, including tonic-clonic seizures, which can develop into status epilepticus, which is a medical emergency. It can also cause myoclonic status epilepticus.

In overdose, lamotrigine can cause uncontrolled seizures in most people. Reported results in overdoses involving up to 15 g include increased seizures, coma, and death.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Lamotrigine is a member of the sodium channel blocking class of antiepileptic drugs. This may suppress the release of glutamate and aspartate, two dominant excitatory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. It is generally accepted to be a member of the sodium channel blocking class of antiepileptic drugs, but it could have additional actions, since it has a broader spectrum of action than other sodium channel antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin and is effective in the treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder, whereas other sodium channel-blocking antiepileptic drugs are not, possibly on account of its sigma receptor activity. In addition, lamotrigine shares few side effects with other, unrelated anticonvulsants known to inhibit sodium channels, which further emphasizes its unique properties.

It is a triazine derivate that inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium channels, leading to stabilization of neuronal membranes. It also blocks L-, N-, and P-type calcium channels and weakly inhibits the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor. These actions are thought to inhibit release of glutamate at cortical projections in the ventral striatum limbic areas, and its neuroprotective and antiglutamatergic effects have been pointed out as promising contributors to its mood stabilizing activity. Observations that lamotrigine reduced GABAA receptor-mediated neurotransmission in rat amygdala suggest that a GABAergic mechanism may also be involved. It appears that lamotrigine does not increase GABA blood levels in humans.

Lamotrigine does not have pronounced effects on any of the usual neurotransmitter receptors that anticonvulsants affect (adrenergic, dopamine D1 and D2, muscarinic, GABA, histaminergic H1, serotonin 5-HT2, and N-methyl-D-aspartate). Inhibitory effects on 5-HT, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters are weak. Lamotrigine is a weak inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, but whether this effect is sufficient to contribute to a mechanism of action or increases risk to the fetus during pregnancy is not known. Early studies of lamotrigine&#x27;s mechanism of action examined its effects on the release of endogenous amino acids from rat cerebral cortex slices &quot;in vitro&quot;. As is the case for antiepileptic drugs that act on voltage-dependent sodium channels, lamotrigine thereby inhibits the release of glutamate and aspartate, which is evoked by the sodium-channel activator veratrine and was less effective in the inhibition of acetylcholine or GABA release. At high concentrations, it did not affect spontaneous or potassium-evoked amino acid release.

These studies suggested that lamotrigine acts presynaptically on voltage-gated sodium channels to decrease glutamate release. Several electrophysiological studies have investigated the effects of lamotrigine on voltage-gated sodium channels. For example, lamotrigine blocked sustained repetitive firing in cultured mouse spinal cord neurons in a concentration-dependent manner, at concentrations that are therapeutically relevant in the treatment of human seizures. In cultured hippocampal neurons, lamotrigine reduced sodium currents in a voltage-dependent manner, and at depolarised potentials showed a small frequency-dependent inhibition. These and a variety of other results indicate that the antiepileptic effect of lamotrigine, like those of phenytoin and carbamazepine, is at least in part due to use- and voltage-dependent modulation of fast voltage-dependent sodium currents. However, lamotrigine has a broader clinical spectrum of activity than phenytoin and carbamazepine and is recognized to be protective against generalized absence epilepsy and other generalized epilepsy syndromes, including primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

The basis for this broader spectrum of activity of lamotrigine is unknown but could relate to actions of the drug on voltage-gated calcium channels. Lamotrigine blocks T-type calcium channels weakly, if at all. However, it does inhibit native and recombinant high voltage-gated calcium channels (N- and P/Q/R-types) at therapeutic concentrations. Whether this activity on calcium channels accounts for lamotrigine&#x27;s broader clinical spectrum of activity in comparison with phenytoin and carbamazepine remains to be determined.

It antagonizes these receptors with the following IC50 values:
* 5-HT3, IC50 = 18μM
* σ receptors, IC50 = 145μM

===Pharmacokinetics===
The pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine follow first-order kinetics, with a half-life of 29 hours and volume of distribution of 1.36L/kg. Lamotrigine is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. Its absolute bioavailability is 98% and its plasma Cmax occurs from 1.4 to 4.8 hours. Available data indicate that its bioavailability is not affected by food. Estimate of the mean apparent volume of distribution of lamotrigine following oral administration ranges from 0.9 to 1.3L/kg. This is independent of dose and is similar to following single and multiple doses in both patients with epilepsy and in healthy volunteers.

Lamotrigine is inactivated by glucuronidation in the liver. Lamotrigine is metabolized predominantly by glucuronic acid conjugation. Its major metabolite is an inactive 2-n-glucuronide conjugate.

Lamotrigine has fewer drug interactions than many anticonvulsant drugs, although pharmacokinetic interactions with carbamazepine, phenytoin and other hepatic enzyme-inducing medications may shorten half-life. Dose adjustments should be made on clinical response, but monitoring may be of benefit in assessing compliance.

The capacity of available tests to detect potentially adverse consequences of melanin binding is unknown. Clinical trials excluded subtle effects and optimal duration of treatment. There are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmological monitoring. Lamotrigine binds to the eye and melanin-containing tissues which can accumulate over time and may cause toxicity. Prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects and base treatment on clinical response. Patient compliance should be periodically reassessed with lab and medical testing of liver and kidney function to monitor progress or side effects.

==Chemistry==
The first synthesis of lamotrigine was disclosed in a patent file by the Wellcome Foundation in 1980.
2,3-Dichlorobenzoyl chloride is treated with cuprous cyanide to form an acyl cyanide. This is then reacted with the nitrate salt of aminoguanidine to give an intermediate which is cyclised to the diamino triazine of the drug product.

===Brand names===
Lamotrigine is sold under the original brand name Lamictal and it is available in generic form under many brand names worldwide.

== Regulatory advisory in 2021 ==
In March 2021, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning regarding the potential for cardiac arrhythmias in people with pre-existing structural or conduction heart defects. The warning provoked consternation and controversy within the professional community. An in-vitro study conducted in 2011 predicted Class IB antiarrhythmic activity at therapeutic concentrations of lamotrigine, due to its sodium channel-blocking activity. Thus, lamotrigine use in at-risk populations could prolong the QRS interval on the electrocardiogram, and increase the risk of arrhythmias and sudden death. No references to human studies or postmarket data in at-risk populations (i.e., people with structural heart disease) were cited to support the warning. A study in dogs is mentioned in the prescribing information brochure by the manufacturer. A rapid systematic review concluded that &quot;there is insufficient evidence to support or refute that lamotrigine is associated with sudden death or electrocardiogram changes...&quot; The FDA has recommended that further studies are conducted with lamotrigine and other sodium-channel blocking antiseizure medications.

In March 2023, an FDA Adverse Event Reporting System analysis demonstrated signals of cardiac arrest, but not of tachyarrhythmia or bradyarrhythmia nor their clinical manifestation as fainting in lamotrigine. The study stratified the epileptic and psychiatric indications, explaining that the nature of the signal for cardiac arrest seems to be confounded by the psychiatric indication, which included 2.5 times more concomitant medications with cardiac adverse events, such as QT-prolonging drugs. Additionally, a 1.5-fold greater reports on overdose and suicide attempts was recorded in the psychiatric reports. Although lamotrigine blocks the cardiac sodium channels at therapeutically relevant concentrations, owing to its short-fast kinetics at the channel level, this blockage did not translate into a disproportional signal in this study.

== Research ==
Though lamotrigine has been used to treat seizures in infants, as of 2023, its effectiveness in this age group has been evaluated in only one study. Adverse effects were rarely severe enough for the medication to be discontinued in this age group, however, its effectiveness in reducing seizures was inconclusive.

<text>Madeleine Zoe Damerment (11 November 1917 – 13 September 1944) was a French agent of the United Kingdom&#x27;s clandestine Special Operations Executive (SOE) organization during World War II. The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in countries occupied by the Axis powers, especially Nazi Germany. SOE agents allied themselves with resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England. Damerment was first involved in escape lines helping downed allied airmen escape occupied France. She fled France in March 1942 to avoid arrest. After arriving in Britain, she was recruited by the SOE. Damerment was to be a courier for SOE&#x27;s Bricklayer circuit but was captured by the Gestapo on 29 February 1944 upon arrival in France. The Gestapo knew she was coming because they had captured SOE radios and were reading SOE radio messages. She was subsequently executed at the Dachau concentration camp on 13 September 1944 along with three other female SOE agents.

== Early life ==
Damerment was born in Tortefontaine, Pas-de-Calais Department, France on 11 November 1917. She was the second daughter of Charles Damerment, an official in the French Postal and Telegraph Service. Her father was appointed Postmaster in Lille of the city&#x27;s postmaster. Her father got her a job as a clerk in the Post Office. She was living in Lille when the Germans defeated and occupied France in summer 1940.

== Wartime service ==
=== Escape line ===
Following the occupation of France by the Germans, Damerment&#x27;s family became actively involved with the French resistance. Damerment worked as a courier on the clandestine Pat O&#x27;Leary escape line (Pat Line) set up by Albert Guérisse. She helped downed British airmen and others to escape France to neutral Spain and hence to British Gibraltar or neutral Lisbon, Portugal from where they would be flown to Britain. She helped an estimated 75 British airmen escape. Damerment became engaged to Roland Lepers, a young man who guided escaping Allied airmen and French soldiers from Lille to Marseille, where the Pat Line was headquartered. In May 1941, her parents were arrested by the Germans. Although they were released, Damerment went underground. An escape line worker, a former British soldier named Harold Cole, betrayed the Pat Line and many were arrested by the Germans. Avoiding arrest, Damerment crossed the border illegally into Spain, reaching Barcelona along with Lepers on 10 March 1942. She initially stayed in the home of Michael Cresswell, a British diplomat who was helping escapees from the Germans. Spain was attempting to quell the influx of people fleeing the German occupation of most of Europe and Damerment was arrested on 24 April and incarcerated until 30 May, when the British Embassy secured her release. She was then driven to Lisbon in a British Embassy automobile and flown to Britain by the British on 27 June 1942. Lepers also reached Britain, but he broke off his engagement with Damerment. She recuperated from an illness at a Catholic convent and became a French teacher.

=== Special Operations Executive ===
Damerment&#x27;s undercover experience with the escape lines and her knowledge of France made her attractive to SOE, which was in search of qualified personnel to serve as agents in France. She was recruited and volunteered to work with the SOE. She was given the cover name Martine Dussautoy and commissioned as an ensign in the FANY. Sent to Scotland for paramilitary training, Captain Dixon-Robertson, her signals instructor at Inverie (STS 24), determined that, only being considered fair for sending and receiving messages, she was unsuitable for work as a wireless operator. However, Captain Smith reported that, for physical training, Damerment was a &quot;keen and hard worker with good stamina.&quot; Damerment had a good grasp of the principles of close combat, worked well and was aggressive. For rope work, she was reported to have fair muscular strength and good co-ordination, but required more practice. She worked well and showed keenness in fieldcraft, although she found the theoretical side difficult.

For weapons training, Damerment was reported to have improved and was &quot;now a fair shot with pistol and carbine, but is lacking in aggressiveness.&quot; She was very good at explosives and demolitions, both in theoretical and practical work, as she was reportedly &quot;extremely keen&quot; and made up &quot;splendid charges&quot;, and was very good at writing route reports, being &quot;accurate and painstaking&quot;. For schemes and tactics, Damerment was considered to have been a &quot;very hard-working member of a band on all schemes and has a good knowledge of tactics as well as a fund of common sense.&quot; She was not very interested in boat work but &quot;worked well and acquired a fair knowledge for elementary small boat handling and of knots.&quot;

Captain Parson, the Commandant, reported the following:

After celebrating Christmas (1943) and New Year in England, Damerment was sent to Beaulieu for a clandestine warfare course. Major Wedgewood, an instructor at the House on the Shore (STS 33), reported the following in the beginning of February.

==Captured==

The Prosper Network, based in Paris, was SOE&#x27;s largest and most important network in France. Since June 1943, SOE headquarters in London had indications that the Prosper and other networks had been penetrated by the Germans, their radios compromised, and many of their operatives captured. Nevertheless, SOE decided to send a trio of agents into France. Damerment was assigned as courier with the Bricklayer network, and she and agents France Antelme, an experienced leader and organiser, and Lionel Lee (wireless operator) parachuted from a RAF special duties 161 Squadron Halifax into a field near the city of Chartres on the night of 29 February 1944. Agents of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), the intelligence agency of the SS in Paris headed by Major Josef Kieffer were waiting on the ground for them. Damerment was transported to SD headquarters at Avenue Foch in Paris where she was interrogated. On 12 May 1944, Damerment was sent with several other captured female SOE agents to Karlsruhe prison, a civilian prison for women in Germany, where they were held for four months. At Karlsruhe, she was in a cell next to another captured SOE agent, Eliane Plewman, and the two were able to communicate with each other.

== Execution ==
On 12 September, Damerment was abruptly transferred to Dachau concentration camp with fellow agents Yolande Beekman, Noor Inayat Khan and Eliane Plewman, and at dawn on the following morning, 13 September, the four women were executed by Wilhelm Ruppert.

A Gestapo man named Max Wassmer was in charge of prisoner transports at Karlsruhe and accompanied the women to Dachau. Another Gestapo man named Christian Ott gave a statement to American investigators after the war as to the fate of Damerment and her three companions. Ott was stationed at Karlsruhe and volunteered to accompany the four women to Dachau as he wanted to visit his family in Stuttgart on the return journey. Though not present at the execution, Ott told investigators what Wassmer had told him.


This cannot be considered a reliable account as Ott told the investigator he had asked Wassmer the following question after being told what had happed to the women: &quot;But tell me, what really happened&quot;, to which Wassmer replied: &quot;So you want to know how it really happened?&quot;

Damerment&#x27;s colleagues France Antelme and Lionel Lee were also executed while captives of the Germans
== Honours and awards ==

Following the war, Damerment&#x27;s contribution was recognised by her government with the posthumous awarding of the Legion of Honor, Croix de Guerre, the Médaille de la Résistance, and by the British King&#x27;s Commendation for Brave Conduct. She is recorded on the FANY memorial at St Paul&#x27;s Church, Knightsbridge, London and also in column 3 of panel 26 of the Brookwood Memorial as one of 3,500 &quot;to whom war denied a known and honoured grave&quot;.

Damerment is also listed on the &quot;Roll of Honor&quot; on the Valençay SOE Memorial in the town of Valençay, in the Indre Département of France. There is also a plaque on the south wall of the crematorium at the former Dachau concentration camp, where the four SOE agents are remembered.

<text>Johan Marius Nicolaas Heesters (5 December 1903 – 24 December 2011), known professionally as Johannes Heesters, was a Dutch-German actor of stage, television and film, as well as a vocalist of numerous recordings and performer on the concert stage with a career dating back to the 1920s. He worked as an actor until his death and is one of the oldest performing entertainers in history, performing shortly before his death at the age of 108. Heesters was almost exclusively active in the German-speaking world from the mid-1930s and became a film star in Nazi Germany, which later led to controversy in his native country. He was able to maintain his popularity in Germany in the decades until his death.

==Early life==

Heesters was born in Amersfoort, Netherlands, the youngest of four sons. His father Jacobus Heesters (1865–1946) was a salesman and his mother Geertruida Jacoba van den Heuvel (1866–1951), a homemaker.

Heesters was fluent in German from an early age, having lived for several years in the household of a German great uncle from Bavaria. Heesters decided to become an actor and a singer at the age of 16 and began vocal training. He specialized in Viennese operetta very early in his career, and made his Viennese stage debut in 1934 in Carl Millöcker&#x27;s &quot;Der Bettelstudent&quot; (&quot;The Beggar Student&quot;).

==Nazi Germany==
Aged 31, Heesters permanently moved to Germany with his wife and daughters in 1935. His signature role was Count Danilo Danilovich in Franz Lehár&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Merry Widow&quot;). His version of Count Danilo&#x27;s entrance song, &quot;&quot;, was well known. During his time in Germany, he performed for Adolf Hitler and visited the Dachau concentration camp, which made him a controversial figure for many Dutch. Joseph Goebbels placed Heesters on the &quot;Gottbegnadeten&quot; list as an artist considered crucial to Nazi culture; he was the only non-German included.

Heesters funded the German war machine by donating money to the weapons industry. This helped to make him a very controversial figure in the late 1970s. Heesters always denied these accusations despite reliable evidence.

He befriended several high-ranking Nazi-officials and SS-officers. Hitler is known to have been an avid admirer of his acting skills.

At the same time, Heesters was idolized by the Swingboy subculture, who admired his pale face and combed long black hair and tried to copy his attire. His style contrasted that promoted by the Hitlerjugend.

Heesters met Hitler several times, especially in the role of Count Danilo. Throughout the war, Heesters continued to perform for German soldiers in camps and barracks. According to German author Volker Kühn, Heesters performed for the SS at the Dachau concentration camp. Kühn cites as evidence the testimony of a Dachau inmate, Viktor Matejka, who worked for the SS and told Kühn he pulled the curtain when Heesters performed in 1941. According to German writer Jürgen Trimborn however, the interview with Matejka may not be reliable as it occurred some 50 years after the performance was said to have taken place.

In December 2009, Heesters lost his libel suit against Kühn. While acknowledging having visited the camp, he denied having performed as entertainment for the SS troops. In its ruling, the German court did not find whether Kühn&#x27;s allegations were true, but rather that too much time had passed for an accurate determination of fact to be made.

==After the war==
Heesters worked extensively for UFA until almost the end of the Second World War (his last wartime movie being &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;, produced in 1945) and easily made the transition from the Nazi-controlled cultural scene to post-war Germany and Austria, appearing again in a number of films. These included &#x27; and the 1957 version of &#x27;. He stopped making movies around 1960 to concentrate on stage and television appearances and on producing records.

In later years, Heesters spoke fondly of Hitler as a person, but condemned his political stance. In the 1990s, he and his wife toured Germany and Austria with Curth Flatow&#x27;s play &#x27; (&quot;A Blessed Age&quot;), which was also televised in 1996. On 5 December 2003, he celebrated his 100th birthday with a television special &#x27; (&quot;A legend turns 100&quot;) on the ARD television channel. He received the title &quot;. In December 2004, at the age of 101, Heesters appeared in Stuttgart at the theatre in a show commissioned on the occasion of his 100th birthday, &quot;. In 2005, at the age of 102, he was featured as a soloist in a major concert tour with the under the direction of Scott Lawton. On 5 December 2006, Heesters celebrated his 103rd birthday with a concert at the . On 5 December 2007, he celebrated his 104th birthday with a concert at the Admiralspalast, Berlin. Then in February 2008, he performed in his home country for the first time in four decades amidst protests against his Nazi associations.

On 13 December 2008, at the age of 105, Heesters apologised for calling Adolf Hitler a &quot;good chap&quot; on the popular German TV show &quot;&quot;. He stated that he had said something stupid and horrible and asked for forgiveness. German media suggested that he had failed to understand the show&#x27;s satirical nature.

Heesters played smaller roles in his last years, as he began to lose his eyesight due to macular degeneration and could not perform on stage for long periods of times. Unable to read a teleprompter, he had to memorize his lines before a show. He played in the 2011 short film &quot;Ten&quot; as Simon Petrus and made his last stage appearance on 31 October 2011 in Munich.

==Personal life==

Heesters had two daughters by his first wife Louisa Ghijs, whom he married in 1930. After her death in 1985, he remarried in 1992. His second wife, Simone Rethel (born 1949), is a German actress, painter, and photographer. His younger daughter Nicole Heesters is a well-known actress in the German-speaking world, as is his granddaughter Saskia Fischer.

On 1 January 2008, he fell down some stairs in his holiday home in Tyrol and broke two ribs.

In December 2010, 107-year-old Heesters announced that he had quit smoking for his then 61-year-old wife: &quot;She should have me as long as possible.&quot;

On 31 October 2011, Heesters gave his last public performance at the Bayrischer Hof in Munich. Four weeks later, on 29 November 2011, he developed a fever, and was rushed into the hospital. He was fitted with a heart pacemaker and following a good recovery was allowed to go home less than a week later on 4th December 2011 just in time to spend his 108th birthday the next day with family. He did not feel strong enough to make the planned stage appearance to sing in celebration of his birthday and also had missed the premiere of his last film, &quot;Ten&quot;. Due to a relapse in his condition, on 17 December he was readmitted to the hospital where he subsequently suffered a stroke, dying on Christmas Eve in 2011. He was survived by two daughters, five grandchildren, eleven great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.

<doc id="356069" wikidata="Q30319" url="?curid=356069" title="Silesian language">
<text>Silesian, occasionally called Upper Silesian, is an ethnolect of the Lechitic group spoken by part of people in Upper Silesia. Its vocabulary was significantly influenced by Central German due to the existence of numerous Silesian German speakers in the area prior to World War II and after. The first mentions of Silesian as a distinct lect date back to the 16th century, and the first literature with Silesian characteristics to the 17th century.

Linguistic distinctiveness of Silesian has long been a topic of discussion among Poland&#x27;s linguists, especially after all of Upper Silesia was included within the Polish borders, following World War II. Some regard it as one of the four major dialects of Polish, while others classify it as a separate regional language, distinct from Polish. According to the official data from the 2021 Polish census, about 500 thousand people consider Silesian as their native language. Internationally, Silesian has been fully recognized as a language since 2007, when it was accorded the ISO 639-3 registration code &quot;szl&quot;.

Several efforts have been made to gain recognition for Silesian as an official regional language in Poland. Shortly before the 2007 Polish parliamentary election, the MPs of Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland, League of Polish Families, People&#x27;s National Movement and the Polish People&#x27;s Party submitted a bill recognizing Silesian as a regional language in Poland, but the Sejm was dissolved before the bill could have been passed. In April 2024, the Polish Sejm took a significant step by passing a bill recognizing it as such, however, the bill was vetoed by President Andrzej Duda on 29 May 2024.

== Distribution ==
Silesian speakers currently live in the region of Upper Silesia, which is split between southwestern Poland and the northeastern Czech Republic. At present Silesian is commonly spoken in the area between the historical border of Silesia on the east and a line from Syców to Prudnik on the west as well as in the Rawicz area.

Until 1945, Silesian was also spoken in enclaves in Lower Silesia, where the majority spoke Lower Silesian, a variety of Central German. The German-speaking population was either evacuated en masse by German forces towards the end of the war or deported by the new administration upon the Polish annexation of the Silesian Recovered Territories after its end. Before World War II, most Slavic-language speakers also knew German and, at least in eastern Upper Silesia, many German speakers were acquainted with Slavic Silesian.

According to the last official census in Poland in 2021, about 460,000 people declared Silesian as their native language, whereas in the country&#x27;s census of 2011, the figure was about 510,000. In the censuses in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, nearly 900,000 people declared Silesian nationality; Upper Silesia has almost five million inhabitants, with the vast majority speaking Polish in the Polish part and declaring themselves to be Poles and the vast majority speaking Czech in the Czech part and declaring themselves to be Czechs.

== Grammar ==

Although the morphological differences between Silesian and Polish have been researched extensively, other grammatical differences have not been studied in depth.

A notable difference is in question-forming. In standard Polish, questions which do not contain interrogative words are formed either by using intonation or the interrogative particle . In Silesian, questions which do not contain interrogative words are formed by using intonation (with a markedly different intonation pattern than in Polish) or inversion (e.g. ); there is no interrogative particle.

== Example ==
According to Jan Miodek, standard Polish has always been used by Upper Silesians as a language of prayers.

== Dialects of Silesian ==

Silesian has many dialects:
* Dialects spoken in areas which are now part of Poland, former Prussian Silesia:
** Kluczbork Silesian dialect (1)
** Opole Silesian dialect (2)
** Niemodlin Silesian dialect (3)
** Prudnik Silesian dialect (4)
** Gliwice Silesian dialect (5)
** Sulkovian Silesian dialect
** Borderland Silesian-Lesser Polish dialect (6a &amp; 6b)
** Borderland Silesian-Lach dialect (9)
* Dialects spoken on both sides of the Czech–Polish border, former Austrian Silesia:
** Cieszyn Silesian dialect (7)
** Jabłonków Silesian dialect (8)
* Lower Silesian dialect group
** Chwalim dialect
* Lach dialects spoken in areas which are now part of the Czech Republic, often considered linguistically apart from the ones mentioned above:
** Opava subdialect
** Ostrava subdialect
** Frenštát subdialect

== Dialect vs. language ==

===Politicization===
Opinions are divided among linguists regarding whether Silesian is a distinct language, a dialect of Polish, or, in the case of Lach, a variety of Czech. The issue can be contentious, because some Silesians consider themselves to be a distinct nationality within Poland. When Czechs, Poles, and Germans each made claims to substantial parts of Silesia as constituting an integral part of their respective nation-states in the 19th and 20th centuries, the language of Slavic-speaking Silesians became politicized.

Slavicist of Upper Silesian extraction, :de:Rudolf Abicht, who worked at the University of Breslau and proposed an early standardization of the Belarusian language, clearly recognized that standardizing and making Silesian into a language is a socio-political process. In 1920, he expressed his opinion on the subject in an extensive essay on the &#x27;Upper Silesian language question.&#x27;

Some, like Óndra Łysohorsky (a poet and author in Czechoslovakia), saw the Silesians as being their own distinct people, which culminated in his effort to create a literary standard which he called the &quot;Lachian language&quot;. Silesian inhabitants supporting the cause of each of these ethnic groups had their own robust network of supporters across Silesia&#x27;s political borders which shifted over the course of the 20th century prior to the large-scale ethnic cleansing in the aftermath of World War II.

In 2011, Tomasz Kamusella and :pl:Andrzej Roczniok published a Silesian-language article on the standardization of the Silesian language.

===Views===
Some linguists from Poland, such as Jolanta Tambor, Juan Lajo, Tomasz Wicherkiewicz, philosopher Jerzy Dadaczyński, sociologist Elżbieta Anna Sekuła, and sociolinguist Tomasz Kamusella, support its status as a language. According to Stanisław Rospond, it is impossible to classify Silesian as a dialect of the contemporary Polish language because he considers it to be descended from Old Polish. According to Kamusella, &quot;between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s, several popular Silesian-Polish dictionaries were published, some of which were quite extensive. Initially, they referred to Silesian as a gwara (dialect) but then increasingly termed it a language.&quot;

Other Polish linguists, such as Jan Miodek and Edward Polański, do not support its status as a language. Jan Miodek and Dorota Simonides, both of Silesian origin, prefer to see the preservation of the entire range of Silesian dialects rather than standardization.
The German linguist Reinhold Olesch was greatly interested in the &quot;Polish vernaculars&quot; of Upper Silesia and other Slavic varieties such as Kashubian and Polabian. Miodek argues that &quot;there is no major grammatical feature within Silesian, which would not function simultaneously in the dialects of Lesser Poland or Greater Poland, Mazovian or Kashubian&quot;.

The United States Immigration Commission in 1911 classified it as one of the dialects of Polish. In their respective surveys of Slavic languages, most linguists writing in English, such as Alexander M. Schenker, Robert A. Rothstein, and Roland Sussex and Paul Cubberley list Silesian as a dialect of Polish, as does &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. On the question of whether Silesian is a separate Slavic language, Gerd Hentschel wrote that &quot;Silesian ... can thus ... without doubt be described as a dialect of Polish&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

In contrast, Silesian linguist Henryk Jaroszewicz who codified Silesian, argues that Silesian constitutes a separate language, and bases his view on the need to prioritize extralinguistic factors of the intralinguistic ones:
Polish linguist Kazimierz Polański wrote: &quot;The problem of distinguishing languages from dialects is not a purely linguistic problem, it is rather a sociological, psychological problem. To a certain extent, it is also political. It is not possible to establish linguistic criteria to distinguish between a language and a dialect. The main issue here is linguistic awareness, which causes a linguistic community to mature at a certain point and decide to become independent: it develops a dictionary of its language, codifies the rules of its use, its spelling, choice of alphabet, etc. From this point onwards, it is possible to speak of a separate language. From this point onwards, it is possible to speak of a distinct language.&quot; 

Among the linguists who argue that Silesian is a language, Witold Mańczak wrote that &quot;the defining feature between ethnolects is lexical, not grammatical, convergence&quot;. In this context, Silesian has a lexical similarity of 53% with Polish; similarly, English language was evaluated to have a lexical similarity of 60% with the German language. Percentages higher than 85% usually indicate that the two languages being compared are likely to be related dialects.

In Czechia, disagreement exists concerning the Lach dialects which rose to prominence thanks to Óndra Łysohorsky and his translator Ewald Osers. While some have considered it a separate language, most now view Lach as a dialect of Czech.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
== Writing system ==
There have been a number of attempts at codifying the language spoken by Slavophones in Silesia. Probably the most well-known was undertaken by Óndra Łysohorsky when codifying the Lachian dialects in creating the Lachian literary language in the early 20th century.

Ślabikŏrzowy szrajbōnek is the relatively new alphabet created by the Pro Loquela Silesiana organization to reflect the sounds of all Silesian dialects. It was approved by Silesian organizations affiliated in Rada Górnośląska. Ubuntu translation is in this alphabet as is some of the Silesian Wikipedia, although some of it is in Steuer&#x27;s alphabet. It is used in a few books, including the Silesian alphabet book.

: Letters: A, Ã, B, C, Ć, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, Ł, M, N, Ń, O, Ŏ, Ō, Ô, Õ, P, R, S, Ś, T, U, W, Y, Z, Ź, Ż.

One of the first alphabets created specifically for Silesian was &quot;Steuer&#x27;s Silesian alphabet&quot;, created in the Interwar period and used by Feliks Steuer for his poems in Silesian. The alphabet consists of 30 graphemes and eight digraphs:

: Letters: A, B, C, Ć, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, Ł, M, N, Ń, O, P, R, S, Ś, T, U, Ů, W, Y, Z, Ź, Ż
: Digraphs: Au, Ch, Cz, Dz, Dź, Dż, Rz, Sz

Based on the Steuer alphabet, in 2006 the was proposed:

: Letters: A, B, C, Ć, Č, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Ń, O, P, R, Ř, S, Ś, Š, T, U, Ů, W, Y, Z, Ź, Ž.

Silesian&#x27;s phonetic alphabet replaces the digraphs with single letters (Sz with Š, etc.) and does not include the letter Ł, whose sound can be represented phonetically with U. It is therefore the alphabet that contains the fewest letters. Although it is the most phonetically logical, it did not become popular with Silesian organizations, with the argument that it contains too many caron diacritics and hence resembles the Czech alphabet. Large parts of the Silesian Wikipedia, however, are written in Silesian&#x27;s phonetic alphabet.

Sometimes other alphabets are also used, such as the &quot;Tadzikowy muster&quot; (for the &quot;National Dictation Contest of the Silesian language&quot;) or the Polish alphabet, but writing in this alphabet is problematic as it does not allow for the differentiation and representation of all Silesian sounds.

== Culture ==

Silesian has recently seen an increased use in culture, for example:
* , online news and information platform (founded in January 2018)
* YouTube personalities such as Niklaus Pieron
* TV and radio stations (for example: TV Silesia, Sfera TV, TVP3 Katowice, Slonsky Radio, Radio Piekary, Radio Silesia, Radio Fest);
* Music groups (for example: , Krzysztof Hanke, Hasiok, , FEET);
* Theatre (for example: &quot;Polterabend&quot; in Silesian Theatre);
* Plays
* Film (for example: &quot; (&quot;Grzeszny żywot Franciszka Buły&quot;&quot;)
* Books (for example, the so-called ; poetry: &quot;Myśli ukryte&quot; by Karol Gwóźdź)
* Teaching aides (for example, a Silesian basal reader)

== Recognition ==
In 2003, the National Publishing Company of Silesia () commenced operations. This publisher was founded by the Alliance of the People of the Silesian Nation () and it prints books about Silesia and books in Silesian language.

In July 2007, the Slavic Silesian language was given the ISO 639-3 code codice_1.

On 6 September 2007, 23 politicians of the Polish parliament made a statement about a new law to give Silesian the official status of a regional language.

On 7 September 2007, the MPs of Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland, League of Polish Families, People&#x27;s National Movement and the Polish People&#x27;s Party submitted a bill recognizing Silesian as a regional language in Poland. The bill did not pass because the Sejm was dissolved before it could be voted on, triggering a snap election.

The first official National Dictation Contest of the Silesian language () took place in August 2007. In dictation as many as 10 forms of writing systems and orthography have been accepted.

On 30 January 2008 and in June 2008, two organizations promoting Silesian language were established: Pro Loquela Silesiana and .

On 26 May 2008, the Silesian Wikipedia was founded.

On 30 June 2008 in the edifice of the Silesian Parliament in Katowice, a conference took place on the status of the Silesian language. This conference was a forum for politicians, linguists, representatives of interested organizations and persons who deal with the Silesian language. The conference was titled &quot;Silesian – Still a Dialect or Already a Language?&quot; ().

In 2012, the Ministry of Administration and Digitization registered the Silesian language in Annex 1 to the Regulation on the state register of geographical names; however, in a November 2013 amendment to the regulation, Silesian is not included.

On 26 April 2024, the Sejm voted 236-186 with five abstentions to recognise Silesian as a regional language. On 29 May 2024, President Andrzej Duda vetoed the bill. 
On 26 June 2024, Silesian was added to the languages offered in the Google Translate service.

<doc id="356071" wikidata="Q636399" url="?curid=356071" title="Smoke on the Water">
<text>&quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; is a song by English rock band Deep Purple, released on their 1972 studio album &quot;Machine Head&quot;. The song&#x27;s lyrics are based on true events, chronicling the 1971 fire at Montreux Casino in Montreux, Switzerland. It is considered the band&#x27;s signature song and its guitar riff is considered to be one of the most iconic in rock history. 

In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine placed &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; number 434 on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. &quot;Total Guitar&quot; magazine ranked the song&#x27;s riff number 4 on its &quot;Greatest Guitar Riffs Ever&quot; list, and in March 2005, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed it at number 12 in its list of the 100 greatest guitar tracks.

In 2017, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Composition==

&quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; is easily identified by its central theme, developed by guitarist Ritchie Blackmore. It is a four-note blues scale melody in G minor, harmonised in parallel fourths. The riff, played on a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar by Blackmore, is later joined by hi-hat and distorted organ, then the rest of the drums, then electric bass parts before the start of Ian Gillan&#x27;s vocal.

Blackmore later claimed that the main riff is an interpretation of inversion of Symphony No. 5 by Ludwig van Beethoven, and that &quot;I owe him a lot of money&quot;.

Jon Lord doubles the guitar part on a Hammond C3 organ played through a distorted Marshall amp, creating a tone very similar to that of the guitar. Blackmore usually plays the main riff using a finger pluck.

==History==
On the eve of the recording session, a concert with Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention was held in the Montreux casino&#x27;s theatre. This was the theatre&#x27;s final concert before the casino complex closed down for its annual winter renovations, which would allow Deep Purple to record there. At the beginning of Don Preston&#x27;s synthesiser solo on &quot;King Kong&quot;, the place suddenly caught fire when somebody in the audience fired a flare gun towards the rattan-covered ceiling, as mentioned in the &quot;some stupid with a flare gun&quot; line. Although there were no major injuries, the resulting fire destroyed the entire casino complex, along with all the Mothers&#x27; equipment. The &quot;smoke on the water&quot; that became the title of the song (credited to bassist Roger Glover, who related how the title occurred to him when he woke from a dream a few days later) referred to the smoke from the fire spreading over Lake Geneva from the burning casino as the members of Deep Purple watched from their hotel. Glover said that, &quot;It was probably the biggest fire I&#x27;d ever seen up to that point and probably ever seen in my life. It was a huge building. I remember there was very little panic getting out, because it didn&#x27;t seem like much of a fire at first. But, when it caught, it went up like a fireworks display.&quot; The &quot;Funky Claude&quot; running in and out is referring to Claude Nobs, the director of the Montreux Jazz Festival who helped some of the audience escape the fire. Swiss police named Zdeněk Špička, a Czechoslovak refugee living in Épalinges, as a suspect in the case, but he fled Switzerland shortly after.
Left with an expensive mobile recording unit and no place to record, the band was forced to scout the town for another place to set up. One promising venue (found by Nobs) was a local theatre, the Pavilion, but soon after the band loaded in and started working/recording, neighbours took offence at the noise. The band was only able to lay down backing tracks for one song (based on Blackmore&#x27;s riff and temporarily named &quot;Title No.1&quot;), before local police shut them down.

After about a week of searching, the band rented the nearly-empty Grand Hôtel de Territet and converted its hallways and stairwells into a makeshift studio, where they laid down most of the tracks for what would become their most commercially successful album, &quot;Machine Head&quot; (which is dedicated to Claude Nobs).

The only song from &quot;Machine Head&quot; not recorded entirely in the Grand Hotel was &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; itself, which had been partly recorded during the abortive Pavilion session. Its lyrics were composed later, primarily by Gillan and based around Glover&#x27;s title, and the vocals were recorded in the Grand Hotel.

Because of the incident and the exposure Montreux received when &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; became an international hit, Deep Purple formed a lasting bond with the town. The song was honoured in Montreux by a sculpture along the lake shore (right next to the statue of Queen frontman Freddie Mercury on the concrete wall right below the Marché couvert) with the band&#x27;s name, the song title, and the riff in musical notes. However, this monument has been removed and has not been there since at least 2017. The new casino in Montreux displays notes from the riff as decoration on its balustrade facing the gambling hall. The only other memorial in Montreux dedicated to the band&#x27;s song is a small plaque placed outside the back entrance of the former Grand Hôtel de Territet, the building in whose hallways the album &quot;Machine Head&quot; was partially recorded.
On the &quot;Classic Albums&quot; episode about &quot;Machine Head&quot;, Blackmore claimed that friends of the band were not fans of the &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; riff, which they thought too simplistic. Blackmore retorted by making comparisons to the first movement of Beethoven&#x27;s 5th Symphony, which revolves around a similar four-note arrangement.

&quot;The amazing thing with that song, and Ritchie&#x27;s riff in particular,&quot; observed Ian Paice, &quot;is that somebody hadn&#x27;t done it before, because it&#x27;s so gloriously simple and wonderfully satisfying.&quot;

The intro riff has been described as very similar to the intro of the bossa nova song &quot;Maria Moita&quot; composed by Carlos Lyra and Vinicius de Moraes in 1964, appearing in Lyra&#x27;s album &quot;Pobre Menina Rica&quot;, and also recorded the same year by Nara Leão for her first album, &quot;Nara&quot;.

On March 3, 2024, to celebrate the Super Deluxe Edition of &quot;Machine Head&quot;, Deep Purple released its first official music video to &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; after 52 years. The song was remixed by Dweezil Zappa, son of musician Frank Zappa, and the animated music video was directed by Dan Gibling and Luke McDonnell of Chiba Film.

==Impact==

&quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; was included on &quot;Machine Head&quot;, which was released in early 1972, but was not released as a single until a year later, in May 1973. (&quot;Never Before&quot; and &quot;Highway Star&quot; were the first singles issued from the album.) The band members have said that they did not expect the song to be a hit, but the single reached number 4 on the Billboard pop singles chart in the United States during the summer of 1973, reached number 2 on the Canadian RPM charts, and propelled the album to the top 10 more than a year after its release. Live performances of the tune, featuring extended interplay between Blackmore&#x27;s guitar and Jon Lord&#x27;s Hammond organ, would become a centrepiece of Deep Purple&#x27;s concerts, as in the live version found on the album &quot;Made in Japan&quot;. Warner Brothers included the live version of &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; from &quot;Made in Japan&quot; as the B-side of the &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; studio single.

&quot;Record World&quot; called it a &quot;heavy thumper that never gives up.&quot;

The principal songwriters included the song within their subsequent solo ventures after Deep Purple had split up. Ian Gillan in particular performed a jazz-influenced version in early solo concerts. The band Gillan adopted a feedback-soaked approach, courtesy of Gillan guitarist Bernie Torme. The song was also featured live by Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s post-Deep Purple band Rainbow during their tours 1981–83, and again after Rainbow were resurrected briefly in the mid-1990s and for three European concerts in June 2016.

During Ian Gillan&#x27;s stint with Black Sabbath in 1983, they performed &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; as a regular repertoire number on encores during their only tour together. It remains one of the few cover songs that Black Sabbath have ever played live.

==In world records==
In 1994, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, 1,322 guitarists gathered to play the world-famous riff all at the same time for a place in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. On Sunday 3 June 2007, in Kansas City this record was topped with 1,721 guitarists, and again just 20 days later, in the German city of Leinfelden-Echterdingen by the group &#x27;Party Blues in Bb&#x27; with over 1,800 other people involved. 
The record was again topped on 1 May 2009, in Wrocław, Poland, when 6,346 guitar players, joined by current Deep Purple guitarist Steve Morse, performed the song during the Thanks Jimi Festival.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; serves as a key plot element in the &quot;Hey, I Can Pee Outside in the Dark&quot; episode of &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;. In the episode, Jake Harper keeps playing the song&#x27;s iconic opening guitar riffs over and over.

<text>The Green Left (SF), since March 2022 the English name for Socialistisk Folkeparti (), is a democratic socialist political party in Denmark.

Socialistisk Folkeparti (SF) was founded on 15 February 1959 by Aksel Larsen, a former leader of the Communist Party of Denmark (DKP), who was removed for criticizing the Soviet intervention in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Larsen aimed to create a third way between Denmark&#x27;s U.S.-oriented social democracy and Soviet-oriented communism, combining democracy with socialism. SF entered the Folketing in the 1960 Danish general election, while the DKP lost its seats. SF became involved in peace, anti-nuclear, and grassroots movements, advocating for independence from the Soviet Union.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, SF experienced fluctuating electoral success, gaining significant influence in the peace and environmental movements. Under Gert Petersen&#x27;s leadership from 1974, SF broadened its appeal, focusing on environmental and gender politics. The party opposed Denmark&#x27;s entry into the European Economic Community in the 1972 referendum, which boosted its membership and support. In the 1980s, SF reached its peak with 27 seats in the Folketing, but faced internal conflicts over EU policies, resulting in fluctuating support.

In the 1990s and 2000s, SF continued to influence Danish politics, supporting the Poul Nyrup Rasmussen government from 1993 to 2001. Under Holger Nielsen&#x27;s leadership, SF opposed the 1992 Danish Maastricht Treaty referendum, but supported the Edinburgh Agreement. The party saw mixed electoral results, gaining seats in some elections and losing in others. Villy Søvndal became party chair in 2005, shifting SF further left and emphasizing professionalism, focus groups, and media strategies. In the 2007 election, SF doubled its seats, becoming the fourth-largest party.

SF joined the coalition government led by Helle Thorning-Schmidt in 2011, marking its first participation in the cabinet. However, internal conflicts and controversies led to SF leaving the coalition in 2014. Under Pia Olsen Dyhr&#x27;s leadership since 2014, SF supported the Mette Frederiksen-led Social Democrat minority government after the 2019 election. Despite the &quot;red bloc&quot; winning a narrow majority in the 2022 election, SF became the largest opposition party when Frederiksen formed a centrist government with the Liberal Party and Moderates.

==History==

===1959–1969===
The SF was founded on 15 February 1959 by Aksel Larsen, a former leader of the Communist Party of Denmark (DKP). Larsen was removed from the ranks of the DKP for his criticism over the Soviet intervention in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Larsen and the new SF sought to form a third way between Denmark&#x27;s United States-oriented social democracy and Soviet Union–oriented communism, which sought to combine democracy with socialism. He was joined by a large share of the members of the DKP. They all supported the idea of independence from the Soviet Union.

In the 1960 elections, the party entered the Folketing with eleven seats. The DKP lost all six of its seats. In the 1964 elections, the party lost one seat. During the 1960s, the SF became involved in the peace movement and the movements which opposed nuclear weapons and nuclear power. It sought to &quot;walk on two legs&quot;, by combining its parliamentary work with involvement in grass roots movements.

In the 1966 elections, the Social Democrats and the SF won a combined majority in parliament, in which the SF doubled its number of seats from 10 to 20. A Social Democrat minority government was formed, which was supported by the SF. The cooperation lasted only one year, but led to considerable conflict within the SF: in 1967, the Left Socialists (VS) broke away from the SF. In the subsequent 1968 elections, the SF lost nine seats and the VS entered parliament with four. In 1969, the party chairperson Larsen stood down; he was replaced by Sigurd Ømann.

===1969–1991===
In the 1971 elections, the party regained ground on the VS, gaining six seats, while the VS left the Folketing. In 1972, the party participated in the referendum campaign against Denmark&#x27;s entry into the European Economic Community. The Danish voters voted in favour of the European by a narrow margin. Because of its opposition to the EEC however boosted the SF&#x27;s membership and support. In the subsequent 1973 &quot;landslide&quot; elections, the SF lost six seats (reducing the party&#x27;s share to 11), and the DKP re-entered the Folketing with six seats. In 1974, Ømann stood down as party chairperson in favour of Gert Petersen. In the 1975 elections, the SF lost two seats and the VS re-entered the Folketing as well. In 1977 the party reached an all-time low with only seven seats. During the 1970s, the SF began to change its program and electoral appeal. Where it had been a male-domined workers&#x27; party it became broader left-wing political party that was oriented towards new voters and new social movements. It became more focused on the environment and gender politics.

In 1979, the party won four seats as the DKP lost its six seats. In the 1981 elections, the party almost doubled from eleven to twenty-one. In the 1984 elections it remained stable. In the 1986 referendum on the Single European Act, the SF campaigned together with the Social Democrats and the Social Liberal Party against the European Community. The SEA was adopted by a narrow margin. In the subsequent 1987, it reached its all-time peak with twenty seven seats. In 1988, it lost three seats, and in 1990, it lost another nine, leaving only fifteen. In 1991, the party chairman Petersen stood down in favour of Holger K. Nielsen. Between 1982 and 1993, a centre-right government led by Poul Schlüter formed by the Conservatives, the Liberals, and allies was in power, even though the Social Democrats, SF, and the Social Liberals formed a majority in parliament. This, combined with its links with the peace and environmental movement, gave the SF the power to force alternative security and environmental policies.

===1991–2001===
In 1991, Petersen stood down as party chairman; he was replaced by Holger K. Nielsen, who was – compared to the other candidate Steen Gade – closer to the party&#x27;s socialist past.

In the 1992 referendum on the treaty of Maastricht, the SF campaigned for the &quot;no&quot;-vote. The Danish people voted against the referendum. In 1993, the SF formed a historic compromise with the other parties in the Folketing. It accepted the concessions made to the Danes in the Edinburgh Agreement and to the SF in the National Compromise. Therefore, it campaigned to vote &quot;yes&quot; in the second referendum. Just before the referendum in 1991, the SF&#x27;s party congress had adopted a new program of action and principles, &quot;Mod Nye Tider (Towards New Times)&quot;, which departed from the old anti-EU line. As a group in the SF became more positive of the EU, the SF became increasingly divided on the issue.

In 1994, it lost another two seats and the Red-Green Alliance an alliance which included the DKP and the VS entered parliament with six seats. In the 1998 elections the party remained stable. During the 1998 referendum on the Treaty of Amsterdam, it led the No-camp again, unsuccessfully. Between 1993 and 2001, the SF supported a Social Democrat/Social Liberal minority government led by Poul Nyrup Rasmussen.

In the 2000 referendum on the euro, the SF was part of the successful &quot;no&quot; campaign.

===In opposition, 2001–2011===
In the 2001 elections, the party lost one seat and after Liberal Party, the Conservative People&#x27;s Party and the Danish People&#x27;s Party gained a majority SF lost almost all political influence in parliament. There were some local bright spots with great support to SF mayors in Vejle, Them, Nakskov, Kalundborg, and Maribo caused by charismatic candidates.

In 2004, the party&#x27;s sole MEP again decided to sit with The Greens–European Free Alliance group, instead of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, leading to considerable internal conflict. The party has since then come around to her point of view, and in 2008, it was decided that future SF MEPs should sit in the Green Group, although at the time SF was still only an observer in the European Green Party and not a full member.

In the 2005 elections, SF gained the worst election result since 1979, and lost yet another seat in parliament. On election night Holger K. Nielsen stepped down as party chairman in favour of a new chair. When Holger K. Nielsen announced that he would step down as chairman, three candidates for the post came forth: Pia Olsen Dyhr, Meta Fuglsang, and Villy Søvndal. At an at times chaotic process on the party congress resulted in the decision to hold a ballot among the party members to decide who should be chairman. Søvndal, running on a platform of moving the party further to the political left won the ballot with 60% of the vote.

The election of Søvndal brought major changes to the party. Greater emphasis was placed on professionalism, the use of focus groups and a change in electoral strategy. The number of key issues was reduced to three to better penetrate in the media with fewer slogans.

In a 2006 internal referendum, 66% of the SF-members declared that the party should participate in the &quot;yes&quot;-camp in a referendum on the European Constitution, a historic break from its Eurosceptic past.

In the 2007 election, SF more than doubled its seats in parliament and became the fourth-largest party with increased support across the country. In itself this did not bring about any major change in political influence since the centre-right was able to maintain its majority. However the increase in votes and members of parliament brought optimism and new resources to the party. The media had also discovered Søvndal&#x27;s ability to make an impact and gave him the opportunity to use that in many cases. The number of party members also greatly increased during this period.

At the 2006 party congress, Søvndal took exception to anti-democratic groups, mostly Hizb-ut-Tahrir using unusually harsh language. He repeated these statements on his blog in 2008 which led to great attention to the party and some internal criticism. Right-wing politicians praised Søvndal&#x27;s statements and rhetoric which caused insecurity in some parts of the party who felt they were being embraced by some of SF&#x27;s main political opponents on the right wing. The polls during these months showed a constant rise in support for the party which combined with a decline in support for the Social Democrats showed an almost equal support to the two parties. For the first time ever some polls showed greater support for SF than for the Social Democrats. In the spring of 2008 this however changed so that SF got 16% in the polls and the Social Democrats 23%.

In 2008, SF voted in favour for the national budget for 2009. This was the first time the SF had voted in favour of a national budget by the Fogh cabinet. This was widely regarded as an attempt to disprove the frequent accusations of SF not being &quot;economically responsible&quot;.

===In government, 2011–2014===
Before the 2011 election, SF announced that its goal was to be part of a cabinet consisting of SF, the Social Democrats, and the Social Liberal Party. While the Social Democrats were positive to the idea the Social Liberals were initially more sceptical, due to differences in economic policies. This became a reality with the formation cabinet of Helle Thorning-Schmidt: For the first time, SF was part of a cabinet, with six cabinet ministers. In September 2012 Villy Søvndal announced that he was stepping down as chairman of the party. After a protracted election for the party chair Annette Vilhelmsen was elected chairwoman with 66% of the constituency, against the 34% achieved by her competitor Astrid Krag. Since Krag had the backing of most of the party leadership, Vilhelmsen&#x27;s election was widely interpreted as a display of dissatisfaction with the leadership&#x27;s approach to participating in government.

Vilhelmsen never managed to provide stable leadership for the party however. In January 2014, the party left the coalition government over a dispute involving the sale of shares in the state-owned energy company DONG Energy to Goldman Sachs, stating that they would instead provide confidence and supply. Vilhelmsen and a considerable part of the party leadership subsequently resigned. Pia Olsen Dyhr was subsequently elected new chairman of the party.

In the 2015 general election SF lost more than half of its votes and achieved its worst result since 1977 with 4.2%.

===Supporting the government, 2019–2022===
The 2019 general election saw a victory for the &#x27;red bloc&#x27; consisting of the Social Democrats, Social Liberals, SF, the Red-Green Alliance, the Faroese Social Democratic Party, and Siumut. SF received 7.7% of the vote, a 3.5% increase from 2015, netting them 14 seats. Following the results, Vice President Signe Munk stepped down to serve in the Folketing and Serdal Benli was elected to take Munk&#x27;s place.

Prior to the election, SF spoke with leader of the Social Democrats Mette Frederiksen and brought a list of policy demands. These included strong climate action and the abolishment of the cash assistance ceiling, though the latter was abandoned during negotiations. Ultimately it was decided that the Social Democrats would form a one-party minority government supported by SF and the rest of the red bloc.

===Return to opposition, 2022–present===
The incumbent red bloc government won a narrow majority in the 2022 general election. However, both before and after the election, Prime Minister Frederiksen instead called for the formation of a unity government with the centre-right Liberal Party as well as the newly formed centrist Moderates. The formation of this grand coalition would make SF the largest party in the opposition with 15 seats, an increase of one compared to the 2019 election. 

On 20 March 2022, the party congress voted for the official English name of the party to be &quot;Green Left&quot;, as the previous English name, &quot;Socialist People&#x27;s Party&quot; (a literal translation of the Danish name) sounded like Eastern Europe&#x27;s former communist parties. &quot;It&#x27;s reminiscent of the communist parties in Russia and China. And we have no interest in that. We are far from them. We actually arose as a reaction to them,&quot; party leader Pia Olsen Dyhr said after the vote. However, the party abbreviation, &quot;SF&quot;, continues to be used by the party in all English language texts.

In the 2024 European parliament election, SF won the most votes of any party, winning a national election in Denmark for the first time. The party elected 3 MEPs: Kira Marie Peter-Hansen, Rasmus Nordqvist and Villy Søvndal.

==Ideology and issues==

SF&#x27;s ideological base is socialism, inspired by green politics and democratic socialism. The party sees a democratic-socialist Denmark as the end goal of its politics. The party is a strong supporter of feminism, human rights, the rights of minorities, and democracy. Other important issues for the SF are a globalization based on . To that extent, it seeks to reform the World Trade Organization, as well as environmental protection, and support feminism. The party is also critical of capitalism, with its principle program (adopted in 2012) arguing that &quot;Danish society is characterized by a capitalist structure. Capitalism has created increased prosperity and productivity, but it has also created great inequality and social injustice, where a wealthy minority has the decisive control over the economy and production, and where many people are excluded and have no influence over their own lives. The main driving force in capitalist society is the private pursuit of profit, which entails a continuous risk of crises and puts constant pressure on society&#x27;s social cohesion and natural foundations. The crises are further exacerbated by a wildly growing, detached financial sector, which becomes a drag on the productive sector. Globalization contains enormous opportunities, but also an unregulated capitalism that creates a casino economy where large banks and finance houses create financial instability. SF works for a regulation of international capital flows and multinational companies.&quot;

=== The European Union ===
Historically, the European Union has divided the party. The party was highly Eurosceptic during the 1990s, when SF was the main architect of the four Danish &quot;opt-outs&quot; of the European Union. When the EU began to implement policies oriented at regional development, environmental protection and social protection, the SF became more positive about the EU. In 2004 the party shifted towards a more pro-European stance. This EU-positive stance was emphasized in 2022, where a broad coalition of Danish parties made a historic Defence-agreement that included a referendum of the Danish EU-defense opt-out. Here, SF recommended to abolish the very same opt-out they had been an architect of in the 1990s.

===International comparison===
The SF is a Nordic Green Left party like the Swedish Left Party, the Norwegian Socialist Left Party, the Finnish Left Alliance, and the Icelandic Left-Green Movement. These were also influenced by feminism and green politics in the 1970s and 1980s. Similar parties in Western Europe were the French Unified Socialist Party and the Dutch Pacifist Socialist Party.

The party is part of the European Green Party, along with other environmentalist and eco-socialist parties such as Alliance 90/The Greens and Europe Ecology – The Greens.

===Relationships to other parties===
The SF has good relationships with the Social Liberal Party and the Social Democrats who, in the past, have cooperated in minority governments supported from the outside by the SF, although now the party is in opposition to a centrist government. The party does not explicitly rule out co-operation with the Enhedslisten.

== Organization ==

Since 2004, the elected candidate was Margrete Auken. Without the approval of the party&#x27;s board, she joined The Greens–European Free Alliance parliamentary group, instead of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left in 2004. Since then, the party has come around to her point of view, and at the national congress in 2008, it was decided that future SF MEPs will stay in the Greens–EFA group in the European Parliament, but SF will only join the European Green Party as an observer, and not as a member. In the 2009 European elections, the party increased its share of votes to 15,6%, and got an additional seat which went to Emilie Turunen, who became a member of the Social Democrats in March 2013.
For the 2019 European Election, SF won back the 2nd seat and is now also represented by Kira Marie Peter-Hansen, who is the youngest parliamentarian ever elected for the European Parliament.

<text>St Helier (; Jèrriais: ; ) is the capital of Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands in the English Channel. It is the most populous of the twelve parishes of Jersey, with a population of 35,822, over one-third of the island&#x27;s total population. The town of St Helier is the largest settlement and only town of Jersey. The town consists of the built-up areas of St Helier, including First Tower, and parts of the parishes of St Saviour and St Clement, with further suburbs in surrounding parishes. 

The greater part of the parish of St Helier is rural. It covers a surface area of , being 9% of the total land area of the island (this includes reclaimed land area of or 200 ha). 

The town sits by the coast in the southeastern corner of the parish. Within it lies the main commercial district and the principal harbour of the island. As the capital, it also hosts the island&#x27;s government, parliament and courts. Evidence of settlement exists as far back as the 13th century, and the growth of the town since has been described as &quot;spasmodic&quot;, its expansion reflecting the waves of migration to the island.

The parish arms are two crossed gold axes on a blue background, the blue symbolising the sea, and the axes symbolising the martyrdom of Helier at the hands of Saxon pirates in 555 AD.

==History==

===Saint===
St Helier is named after Helier (or Helerius), a 6th-century ascetic hermit from Belgium. The traditional date of his martyrdom is AD 555. His feast day, marked by an annual municipal and ecumenical pilgrimage to the Hermitage, is on 16 July.

The medieval hagiographies of Helier, the patron saint martyred in Jersey and after whom the parish and town are named, suggest a picture of a small fishing village on the dunes between the marshy land behind and the high-water mark.

An Abbey of Saint Helier was founded in 1155 on L&#x27;Islet, a tidal island adjacent to the Hermitage. Closed at the Reformation, the site of the abbey was fortified to create the castle that replaced Mont Orgueil as the island&#x27;s major fortress. The new Elizabeth Castle was named after the Queen by the Governor of Jersey 1600–1603, Sir Walter Raleigh.

===Early St Helier===
The land now known as the town of St Helier was once not much more than a low-lying basin consisting of marshy lands and sand dunes (to the west), surrounded by low hills on other sides. There is very little evidence of prehistorical settlement in the St Helier basin; the archaeological site in the parish is an Iron Age dolmen, which used to sit atop Mont de la Ville (the present site of Fort Regent), but which was moved to the house of a former Governor in Henley-on-Thames in the 1780s. It is thought that the site of St Helier was settled at the time of the Roman control of Gaul.

By 540 AD, the monk Helerius (for whom the parish is named) had settled on the islet in the bay of St Aubin, now part of the parish and the modern-day site of Elizabeth Castle. From this hermitage, the monk converted the island&#x27;s population to Christianity, but he was killed in 555 AD by seagoing raiders, attempting to defend the island. Therefore, his hermitage took on great spiritual significance. This establishment of Christianity as the principal religion of the islanders brought with it new governmental structures by the end of the 10th century, including the parochial system. It is believed the boundaries of the parish have not much changed since that time.

The first evidence for the existence of a settlement in St Helier is in the Assize Roll of 1229. However, the parish church, the Town Church, is known to contain features that date to at least the 11th century. Although it is now some considerable distance from the sea, at the time of its original construction it was on the edge of the dunes at the closest practical point to St Helier&#x27;s Hermitage. Before land reclamation and port construction started, boats could be tied up to the churchyard wall on the seaward side.

It is believed the first residences in St Helier were along modern-day Hill Street, opposite the church. These would have been simple fishermen&#x27;s huts, probably constructed from local granite with roofs of thatch. There is some archaeological evidence of 12th-century habitation around Old Street, outside the medieval town area. Another site of settlement was around the Town Mills at the base of Mont Nerou. Despite not having access to the site, the location of the Abbey and the Town Church led to the village developing into the main town for the insular community. Regular markets were held in the town from at least the 15th century and the Royal Court is recorded to have sat in St Helier from ancient times. The town gained formal recognition by the Privy Council by the mid-16th century.

The street layout of the medieval town is difficult to determine, as there are no detailed street maps. A 1563 map shows a group of buildings huddled behind the town church, with an axis - likely either King Street or the Royal Square - through the centre. It is believed that the Royal Square (&quot;place du Marché&quot;), which was initially the town&#x27;s market square, became entirely encircled with buildings by 1550. At this time, the line of King Street (&quot;rue de Derrière&quot;) and Queen Street (&quot;rue du Milieu&quot;) were established, extending from Charing Cross (&quot;la Pompe du bas&quot;, the outlet of Le Grand Douet) and Snow Hill (&quot;Pompe de haut&quot;).

St Helier&#x27;s growth has been marked by waves aligning with waves of migration to the island. The earliest such period of growth for the town seems to be between the Reformation and the Civil War as many French Protestants sought refuge in Jersey, Jersey being a Francophone Protestant state, especially following the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. The first expansion of the old town was to the west. Jurat Helier Hue&#x27;s lands to the north of Charing Cross were sold and developed as Hue Street and Dumaresq Street. John Seale bought lands near Charing Cross and developed Seale Street. The Vingtaine de la Ville officials confirmed their ownership of Mont de la Ville, so developed a new road La Rue des Trois Pigeons (Hill Street) to the south of the Royal Court.

By the start of the 17th century, the town consisted of the modern Royal Square, Hill Street, Regent Road, Church Street, King Street, Queen Street and little else. The eastern gateway to the town was Snow Hill, where the roads from the eastern parishes met, and the western gateway Charing Cross (which led to the market square down Broad Street), where King Street met the sandy plains over which Westerners would travel to come to town. Therefore, King Street and Queen Street formed the core axis for St Helier at this time. Approaches to the town included La Motte Street (for St Saviour), Val Plaisant onto Old Street (for the northern parishes and the Town Mill), and St John&#x27;s Road. The land to the north and southeast of the old town were of considerable value, cultivated as market gardens or planted as orchards.

Improvements to take place during the 17th century included the walling of the Town Church cemetery, the construction of a prison (which arched over Charing Cross) and the paving of important streets. An order of the Royal Court in 1610 led to the improvement of the streets, proprietors being compelled to pave the space before his house to a width of , leading to a non-uniform pattern of paving.

===18th century===
In 1700, the cattle market was moved from Broad Street to a site on the beach, around 60 to 100 yards to the southwest of the churchyard (roughly the site of the Royal Yacht Hotel). It remained here until being relocated to the modern site of Minden Place Car Park in 1841.

&quot;La Cohue&quot; (a Norman word for courthouse) stood on one side of the Royal Square, now rebuilt as the Royal Court and States Chamber (called collectively the States Building). The market cross in the centre of the square was pulled down at the Reformation, and the iron cage for holding prisoners was replaced by a prison gatehouse at the western edge of town. The road now known as Broad Street served as the coast road for the town and may have also been referred to as being exposed to wind-blown sand. The Richmond Map of 1795 shows that the town at this period was only a small stub at the foot of Mont de la Ville, consisting of the main thoroughfare ( from Charing Cross through to La Colomberie) to the north of the Royal Square, at the time the town market. and Old St John&#x27;s Hill were the primary connections up to the north, with connecting the town to its mill at Grands Vaux. In 1718, John Durell bought a number of St Helier fiefs and constructed a new gated street from King Street to Rue du Val. Maps show that the town experienced a steady increase in densification between 1700 and 1756.

Falle gives an account in the early 18th century of the state of the town

George II gave £200 towards the construction of a new harbour – previously boats would be beached on a falling tide and unloaded by cart across the sands. A statue of the king by John Cheere was erected in the square in 1751 in gratitude, and the marketplace was renamed Royal Square, although the name has remained &quot;Lé Vièr Marchi&quot; (the old market) to this day in Jèrriais. Many of St Helier&#x27;s road names and street names are bilingual English/French or English/Jèrriais, but some have only one name. The names in the various languages are not usually translations: distinct naming traditions survive alongside each other.

The Royal Square was also the scene of the Battle of Jersey on 6 January 1781, the last attempt by French forces to seize Jersey. John Singleton Copley&#x27;s epic painting &quot;The Death of Major Peirson&quot; captures an imaginative version of the scene. Following the 1789 French Revolution, many thousands of French refugees settled in Jersey, many aristocratic and most settling in St Helier. This doubled the number of houses in town and its vicinity; many of the tree-lined lanes leading from the town became built up with new houses and streets.

As harbour construction moved development seaward, a population growth meant that marshland and pasture north of the ribbon of urban activity was built on speculatively. Settlement by English immigrants added quarters of colonial-style town houses to the traditional building stock.

Continuing military threats from France spurred the construction of a citadel fortress, Fort Regent, on the Mont de la Ville, the crag dominating the shallow basin of St Helier.

===19th century===
Around 1800, the market was moved from the Royal Square to a new purpose-built and enlarged premises at its current site. This shifted the cultural core of the town out of its old medieval heart, but did not diminish the importance of the old centre, which also saw new works to the waterfront, such as the building of Commercial Buildings. Military roads linking coastal defences around the island with St Helier harbour allowed farmers to exploit Jersey&#x27;s temperate micro-climate and use new fast sailing ships and then steamships to get their produce to the markets of London and Paris before the competition. This was the start of Jersey&#x27;s agricultural prosperity in the 19th century.

The Napoleonic Wars brought the threat of war to Jersey&#x27;s shores, and the island was fortified against French invasion. Martello towers were constructed around the coast (including First Tower in St Helier) and in 1805, the States agreed to sell to the British government Mont de la Ville to site a major fort. The construction of the fort buildings led to a major influx of both people and capital, many of whom came from Ireland and England. The States used the proceeds of the sale of Mont de la Ville to fund improvements to town pavements.

The early 19th century was a period of growth of trade for Jersey. An English Custom House was established in the island in 1810. A key turning point in St Helier history was the introduction of steamships. Previous to that, travel to the island was long and unpredictable. In the mid-1820s, the post office switched to steam as well. The first paddle steamer to visit Jersey was the Medina on 11 June 1823. In 1824, two shipping companies were established, each operating weekly steamship services to England.

This brought thousands of passengers to the town. By 1840, there were 5,000 English residents in Jersey, who some say did not mix well or interact deeply with the native Jèrriais. The number of English-speaking soldiers stationed on the island and the number of retired officers and English-speaking labourers who came to the islands in the 1820s led to the island gradually moving towards an English-speaking culture in St Helier. This new immigration had a large impact on local architecture, with a number of mainland Georgian-style houses and terraces erected on the main roads out of the town. It also expanded with many new streets, such as Burrard Street, first developed in 1812. In 1831, gas street lighting was first introduced on town roads.

The rapid growth of St Helier was one of the most significant changes in the landscape of Jersey during the 19th century. The town developed from a small settlement by the coast to encompassing most of the parish and spreading out into St Clement and St Saviour. The town&#x27;s expansion mainly happened in the semi-saucer of flat land between Westmount and Mount Pleasant, so there remained a significant rural part of the parish. In 1776, both St Aubin and St Helier had had roughly the same size; however, by the end of the 19th century, St Helier was far larger. It is estimated that the number of houses by the mid-19th century was 2,600, 2,000 higher than just sixty years prior.

An important growth for St Helier in the early 19th century was the construction of the harbour. Previously, ships coming into the town had only a small jetty at the site now called the English Harbour and the French Harbour. The Chamber of Commerce urged the States to build a new harbour, but the States refused, so the Chamber took it into their own hands and paid to upgrade the harbour in 1790. A new breakwater was constructed to shelter the jetty and harbours. In 1814, the merchants constructed the roads now known as Commercial Buildings and Le Quai des Marchands to connect the harbours to the town and in 1832 construction was finished on the Esplanade and its sea wall. A rapid expansion in shipping led the States in 1837 to order the construction of two new piers: the Victoria and Albert Piers.

Pierre Le Sueur, reforming Constable of St Helier, was responsible for installing sewerage and provision of clean water in St Helier following outbreaks of cholera in the 1830s. An obelisk with a fountain in the town centre was raised to his memory following his premature death in office from overwork.

In the second half of the 19th century, hundreds of trucks laden with potatoes and other export produce needed access to the harbour. This prompted a programme of road-widening which swept away many of the ancient buildings of the town centre. Pressure for redevelopment has meant that very few buildings remain in urban St Helier which date to before the 19th century, giving the town primarily a Regency or Victorian character.

Towards the end of the century, in the 1870s, the new Jersey Railway opened, connecting the town to the West, with its terminus at the Weighbridge, and a few years later the Eastern Railway, with its terminus at Snow Hill. By this time, the town had two parks: the Parade Gardens, and West Park (now commonly known as People&#x27;s Park). Until the opening of the Waterfront and Millenium Parks in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, these parks would be the only three to exist in the town basin.

The expansion of the town during the 19th century also caused an expansion of social facilities, particularly of churches, due to the importance of religion. These 19th-century churches include St James&#x27; Church (1829), St Mark&#x27;s Church (1843), Wesley Street Methodist Chapel (1827, rebuilt in 1876) and St Thomas&#x27; Catholic Church (1887).

===20th century===
By the turn of the century, all the large open spaces around St Helier were mostly developed. Most new buildings involved maximising the density of a plot, joining smaller plots to form larger premises (especially in order to retailize the heart of town). After the First World War, the need for new homes could not be met in the confines of the basin, and with the growth of the motorcar, the roads leading out into the country allowed ribbon development in all directions, along the coast, up over the hills and into neighbouring parishes. In the 1930s, the States constructed the first-ever public housing estate in Jersey at Wellington Park.

After the German occupation of the Channel Islands, St Helier continued to change as a result of renewed tourism industry and Jersey&#x27;s role as a financial centre. A large change was the unprecedented movement of people around the island thanks to the motor car, which required higher capacity on the old road network and more parking. In the 1960s, income from the Jersey States Lottery was used to excavate a two-lane road tunnel under Fort Regent, enabling traffic from the harbour to the east coast towns to avoid a tortuous route around the fort.

A number of architecturally and historically significant buildings have been destroyed since the Second World War, including the demolishing of one of the oldest townhouses the &quot;Manoir de la Motte&quot;, located on the corner of Grosvenor Street and St James Street, the site where Lt-Governor Corbet surrendered to the French during the Battle of Jersey. A heritage architecture preservation movement grew, partly due to the destruction of a number of historic buildings in the Hue/Dumaresq Street area. This led to increased planning restrictions aimed to preserve the town&#x27;s architectural heritage and preservation of the town&#x27;s character has become a key part of Jersey&#x27;s national planning policy. About the same time, Fort Regent was converted into a major leisure facility and was linked to the town centre by a gondola cableway, which was closed and demolished in the 1990s. In the 1970s, a programme of pedestrianisation of the central streets was undertaken.

===21st century===
In 2006, it was reported that the Connétable, with the backing of the Chief Minister of Jersey, was to seek city status for St Helier.

An explosion at a block of flats in Pier Road on 10 December 2022 killed at least eight people. The initial assumption is that it was caused by a gas leak.

== Politics and government ==

=== Municipality ===
The parish has its own responsibilities, and elections to the municipality of St Helier take place to elect honorary officials who fulfill a variety of roles for parishioners under the overall control of the constable, two Procureurs du Bien Public and the Parish Assembly. Elected officials are supported by a paid administration within the parish.

Five members of the Roads Committee and ten Roads Inspectors are also elected by parishioners and ensure that the roads of the parish are kept in good repair. The members of the Assessment Committee are elected to agree to the rate chargeable to each property in the parish. The Accounts Committee are elected to ensure that the accounts of the Parish represent a &#x27;true and fair view&#x27; of the state of the parish finances in order that the Parish Assembly may rely upon the information to set the parish rate. As with the other parishes, St Helier has an honorary police force.

The parish is divided into vingtaines for administrative purposes:

* La Vingtaine de la Ville
** Canton de Bas de la Vingtaine de la Ville
** Canton de Haut de la Vingtaine de la Ville

==== Conseil Municipal ====
The &quot;Conseil Municipal&quot; is a new municipal council for St Helier. The idea of creating a council was first floated in 1892; however, the idea was not put into place until November 2019, when it was agreed to establish a Shadow Conseil to trial the idea in 2020. The idea is to help the Parish to deliver the parish objectives.

It is composed of:

* The Constable
* The Procureurs du Bien Public
* Roads Committee members
* One elected youth member
* Four other members to be elected
===States representation===

At present, the parish forms three electoral districts for States Assembly elections and elects 13 Deputies and the parish&#x27;s , who sits in the States . The current Deputies for St Helier are listed below. 
=== Capital city ===
St Helier is the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Jersey as the main town and seat of both the civil government and legal system, though the seat of the Crown is Government House, St Saviour. The States Assembly – the legislative body – meets at the States Chamber, next to the Royal Court – the highest court of the island&#x27;s judicial system. Both are based in the Royal Square. The executive is based temporarily at offices in Broad Street. New offices are being constructed at Cyril Le Marquand House on the Parade. As foreign relations are the responsibility of the UK, St Helier does not host any foreign embassies, though there are a number of honorary consulates for foreign governments with links to the Island (e.g. France and Portugal) based in the town.

== Geography ==
St Helier is one of the twelve parishes of Jersey and is the most populated of them. It is located on the island&#x27;s south coast, on the eastern end of St Aubin&#x27;s Bay. It covers the majority, and the principal part of, the island&#x27;s principal settlement (henceforth referred to as &quot;the town&quot;). A large part of the parish is rural.

The town has no clearly defined boundary and does not directly match any parish boundaries. The 2011 Island Plan defines the built-up area as including a large part of the Southern part of the parish (the contiguous built-up area within the parish, notably excluding parts of Mont à l&#x27;Abbé, Le Mont au Prêtre, Grands Vaux, and St Andrews), a part of St Saviour (however not the Five Oaks area, despite being part of the contiguous urban area) and the Georgetown-Plat Douet area of St Saviour and St Clement. Most of the town is located on low-lying land, consisting of escarpment and flood plain.

The town&#x27;s centre is located entirely within the Parish of St Helier, and mostly consists of the area surrounding the town&#x27;s high street, King Street, and Queen Street. It also contains the Parade Cenotaph, Town Church, Town Hall, Royal Square, Victorian Market, the States Chamber and Liberation Square. The town centre is the central business district for the island, containing the principal retail and finance companies.

The parish has a population of 33,522 and a land area of 10.6 km2, making it the densest parish on the island.

The topography of the parish is one of the most varied. The marshland on which the town is situated is encircled by highlands which protect the town from the worst winds. In the southeast of the parish, rising from the plains in the centre of town is Mont de Ville and Mount Bingham which divide the Havre des Pas district from the Harbour.

Le Grand Douet runs underneath the parish from the north near Grands Vaux, out near the Underpass (pictured below).

Since the 1980s, a significant reclamation project has extended the southern area of St Helier – the area now known as the Waterfront. The A1 dual carriageway was upgraded and extended, with a new grade-separated roundabout junction, the first in the Channel Islands.

=== Architecture ===
The town is not particularly visible from the island&#x27;s countryside due to the town&#x27;s position in a sheltering landscape. The parish has a number of character areas:

* West Esplanade and Elizabeth Castle is defined by extensive panoramic views of St Aubin&#x27;s Bay and the sea and architecturally dominated by Elizabeth Castle.
* La Collette consists of mostly reclaimed ground surrounded on three sides by the sea. Its primary usage is industrial and it holds the iconic landmark of La Collette power station chimney, visible across St Helier.
* Havre des Pas is one of the most distinctive and pleasant areas of the town. Predominantly historical architecture with a seaside town flavour.
* Fort Regent – its silhouette is one of the most recognisable images of St Helier. It is an iconic landmark, significant historic site, and major leisure facility.
* Old Harbours has a distinctive identity as a historic harbour area, with open public spaces such as Liberation Square. The piers and harbour structures originate from the early 19th century.
* New Waterfront – on mostly reclaimed land. Distinguishable from the rest of town, consisting of contemporary architecture and a lack of traditional street layout. Home to a leisure centre, modern apartments and office spaces, and several green spaces.
* The Parade and Esplanade is the historic built edge of the town. A mix of historic, post-war and modern buildings. It hosts the General Hospital and the Parade Gardens.
* Town Centre Core, the civic heart of St Helier, has a network of pedestrianised streets and public spaces, as well as a number of significant landmarks.
* Town Centre North is predominantly residential, home to St Thomas&#x27; Church, Springfield Stadium, and the Millenium Town Park.
* Town Centre Edges and Slopes hosts predominantly suburban low-density residential, with a notable landmark being Victoria College.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, St Helier has an Oceanic climate, with mild, rainy winters and mild to warm, quite sunny summers. Winters on the island tend to be milder than in both mainland Britain and Continental Europe, being greatly influenced by the surrounding ocean and the Gulf stream. Snow and frosts are rare and happen only when a severe cold snap reaches Western Europe. Summers on the island does not see the hot temperatures that England and mainland Europe can experience in occasional heatwaves, but the weather is often better than on the mainland with more sunshine and less rain. As the island is more subject to influence from the azores high, and the ocean prevents convectional percipitaion, rainfall is plentiful in autumn-winter but modest in late spring and summer with July being the driest month. Sunshine hours are noticeably higher than in mainland UK and northern France averaging nearly 2100 pr year compared to 1650 in London or Paris . January is the coldest month with an average high of , and a low of . July is the warmest month, with an average high of , and a low of . St Helier also set the record for the most sunshine ever reported in one calendar year in the British Isles.

==Demography==
St Helier is the most populated of Jersey&#x27;s parishes, with 33,522 residents according to the 2011 census.
== Culture ==
St Helier contains cultural facilities at the Jersey Museum, the Maritime Museum, the Jersey Opera House, the Jersey Arts Centre, the performance venue of St James, the sports and entertainment facilities at Fort Regent, the Jersey Library, the library of La Société Jersiaise and the Jersey Archive.

The parish has hosted the Jersey Battle of Flowers carnival since 1902.

==Media==
The BBC has its regional centre in the city. It is the base of BBC Radio Jersey and for BBC Channel Islands regional programmes, the complex contains studios and offices. ITV Channel Television is also based in St Helier and broadcasts the regional programme, &quot;ITV News Channel TV&quot; on ITV1. Channel 103 is an Independent Local Radio station. The local newspaper is the &quot;Jersey Evening Post&quot;, which is printed six days a week, and has been in publication since 1890.

== Public squares and parks ==

===The Weighbridge===

The Weighbridge is a public space in the south of town. The modern space consists of three squares, trisected by La Route de la Libération and the Esplanade. The Weighbridge is notable for being the site of the Liberation of Jersey, when British soldiers raised the Union Flag at the Pomme d&#x27;Or Hotel, bringing a return to British rule in the island after five years under Nazi occupation.

In 1995, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jersey&#x27;s liberation from Nazi occupation, and thus 50 years of peace, a sculpture was erected in the focal point for the celebrations when the island was liberated.

The sculpture was originally to depict islanders releasing doves of peace, but this came under fierce criticism, with some islanders remarking that had any doves been on the island during the occupation, they would have been eaten by starving German soldiers. Therefore, the sculpture was revised to show islanders raising the British flag, as they had done on the day of liberation 50 years previous.

The site is on reclaimed land and has served many purposes over the years. The initial weighbridge was constructed in 1825. The town terminus of the Jersey Railway was opened here in 1870. A statue of Queen Victoria was initially located in what is now Weighbridge Place (it has been relocated to Victoria Park at West Park). This area also served as the island&#x27;s bus terminus until the opening of Liberation Station in 2005.

In the 1990s, Liberation Square was built in front of the Pomme D&#x27;Or for the 50th anniversary of Liberation. It features a statue of islanders holding up a Union Flag. The circular forms of the square represent free thought and liberation. There is a moat around the statue representing the sea and twelve representing the parishes of the island.

=== The Parade ===
The Parade is a wide area in the west of St Helier, incorporating a park in the centre and roads around most of the edges. The area is home to the Cenotaph and General Hospital. It is known as &quot;Les Mielles&quot; in Jèrriais, meaning sand dunes.

It was initially a drilling ground for the island&#x27;s troops. The original hospital building was completed in 1768, but was originally used as barracks. The Cenotaph was constructed in 1923 to commemorate those islanders who lost their lives in the First World War (however has also been expanded to the Second World War), designed by Charles de Gruchy. It is the focal site for Rememebrance Day celebrations on the island.

=== Millennium Town Park ===
This is the newest park in St Helier, opened on a former car park site in 2011. Its creation was initially agreed in 2000; however, plans stalled due to a lack of funds. The park has water features, sculptures, a playground and an area to play ball games. It also has a cycle path through the centre of it.

The site has contributed to local regeneration, with new developments nearby such as Merchant&#x27;s Square and the Gas Place development.

=== Charing Cross ===
Formerly the site of the prison in the 17th century, Charing Cross is a square at the western end of King Street. There is a monument of a Toad (&quot;Le Crapaud&quot;). It was erected in 2004 as part of the commemoration of 800 years of allegiance to the English Crown. On the side, there are inscribed extracts from the Code Le Geyt. Across the road, there is &quot;La Croix de la Reine&quot;, a cross erected to commemorate the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee in 1977. Recently, the Co-operative building on the square was redeveloped, with a new food store and the island&#x27;s first Premier Inn.

=== St Andrew&#x27;s Park ===
St Andrew&#x27;s Park is located around St Andrew&#x27;s Church in First Tower. It was donated by the Seigneur of Mélèches in 1911. Two neolithic dolmens can be found at St Andrew&#x27;s Park near the main road which date to 2800 and 2300 BCE.

==Landmarks==
Many places in St Helier have been formally listed as Sites of Special Interest by the Planning and Environment department of Jersey.

===Elizabeth Castle===
Elizabeth Castle is a 16th-century castle located on a tidal island off the coast of the town. It was constructed to supplement the defence provided by Mont Orgeuil in St Martin. It is now a museum and tourist attraction, administered by Jersey Heritage. It can be accessed by a causeway at low tide, which becomes inundated at high tide, and a duck ferry, which runs on land at low tide and by sea at high tide.

===Fort Regent===


Fort Regent is located at the top of the Mont de la Ville. It was initially constructed as a barracks at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. It was decided to develop it into a leisure complex in 1967. There was a cable car that gave access to Fort Regent from Snow Hill. However, it was closed in 1991. There also used to be a swimming pool that opened in 1971, but it was knocked down in 2020.

A tunnel (A17) was opened under the Fort on 25 February 1970 after seven years of construction. The tunnel links traffic from the east to the west of the island, and allowed for the pedestrianisation of the town centre.

===Central Market and Beresford Market===
Central Market, in Beresford Street, St Helier, is an indoor market that was opened in 1882. It is an official Site of Special Interest, and is popular with tourists and locals. It features Victorian architecture including cast iron structures, and an ornamental fountain in the centre. The market was designed by Thomas Helliwell of Brighouse, Yorkshire, working with Bellamy and Hardy of Lincoln.
The market comprises stalls selling flowers, fruit and vegetables, as well as small shops and cafés.

Beresford Market is a separate building next to the Central Market and specialises in fishmongery.

===16 New Street===
This is an 18th-century Georgian townhouse, with some 19th century additions, which has been renovated by the National Trust for Jersey, and is now operated as a museum.

== Transport ==

The primary road network in the parish consists of the St Helier Ring Road (part of which is located in St Saviour) and a series of A roads branching from there to the surrounding parishes, such as Victoria Avenue. Under Fort Regent, a road tunnel connects the West and the East of the island together.

The parish is responsible for the upkeep of by-roads (&quot;chemins vicinaux&quot;) within its boundaries, managed by the Roads Committee. The Government is responsible for main roads.

The parish contains Liberation Station, the bus terminus for the island&#x27;s public transport network. Every bus route on the island terminates in St Helier and the parish has bus connections to every settlement on the island. A number of bus services provide a direct connection to Jersey Airport in St Peter. In 2022, the TownLink service was introduced which provides a local service within St Helier.

The parish contains the island&#x27;s main port, with ferry services to Saint-Malo, Poole and Portsmouth.

== Religious sites ==
The parish church is known as the Town Church and is the oldest building in St Helier, located on Church Street, across from the Royal Court. It predates the Battle of Hastings and has been altered and enlarged a number of times since. After the Reformation, the church became a Huguenot temple and eight successive Rectors were French Huguenot ministers. In 1842, due to the rising population of St Helier, the Dean of Jersey raised money to replace the church with a larger building; however, it was never built. The Rector of the Town Church is normally co-officially the Dean of Jersey. Charles II attended service in the Town Church a number of times before and during his reign.

As the town expanded in the 19th century, more Anglican churches were needed, especially for English services. The Church of St Mark on David Place, was opened in 1844, with a large two-storey congregation. The church was constructed on a shareholder system, whereby parishioners could purchase pews. The church&#x27;s bells are the most southerly in the British Isles. St Andrew&#x27;s Church at First Tower was originally opened in 1850 as a seamen&#x27;s mission on Castle Street. It then moved to the Esplanade in a dedicated building in 1854. As the town spread west, the church&#x27;s curate moved his church to a new park on a site donated by the Seigneur of Mélèches and opened in 1930.

The St Helier Methodist Centre on Halkett Place was originally part of the French Methodist circuit. The centre was built in 1847 for a congregation of 1,450. There were several other Methodist churches. In 1956, the French and English Methodist Churches combined into a single circuit; the congregations of Wesley Street and Grove Place combined into the Wesley Grove Methodist Church. In 2000, all the Methodist congregations in St Helier moved to the Halkett Place Chapel. St Thomas&#x27;, commonly known as the French Church, is the largest Catholic congregation in the island. Its 1887 building is the finest example of French Gothic architecture in Jersey. There is also a Polish shrine and a Portuguese chapel, to serve the island&#x27;s Catholic immigrant populations, the latter dedicated to Our Lady of Fatima.

== Future plans ==
The Waterfront () district of St Helier sits on land reclaimed during the 1980s. Since then, there have been numerous plans aimed at developing the area. The current planning framework covering the area is the &quot;Southwest St Helier Planning Framework&quot;, published in 2019. The plan aims to improve safety and convenience for pedestrians across La Route de la Libération (which is a road that runs through the area and is grade separated and at some points six lanes wide), including the possibility of an &#x27;iconic bridge&#x27;; require major development proposals to have detailed landscaping schemes to enhance open space and secure a mix of uses in the area, including community facilities.

The state-owned Jersey Development Company, which owns much of the land in the area, is managing the redevelopment and has contracted Gillespies, a landscape architecture firm, after a concept design competition. As of June 2021, the proposals include demolishing the existing Waterfront Centre buildings, redesigning the existing Jardins de la Mer and Waterfront Gardens parks, creating new public squares and new single-phase signalised crossings across Route de la Libération.

== Twin towns and sister cities ==
St Helier is twinned with:

* Funchal, Madeira, Portugal
* Avranches, France
* Bad Wurzach, Germany
* Trenton, New Jersey, United States

== Sport ==
The parish has a number of sports facilities, including Springfield Stadium (incorporating the island&#x27;s football pitch), Aquasplash (swimming pool), pétanque pitches, badminton and the Fort Regent leisure centre. Motorsports events take place on roads in the Parish as well as an annual Town Criterium, and the start and finish of the Jersey Marathon.

In 2021, the Government of Jersey published a report &quot;Inspiring Active Places Strategy&quot;. The strategy will have a total cost of circa £100 million. The plan proposes the removal of sports facilities from Fort Regent by early 2022, which is &quot;beyond the end of its useful life&quot;. The report states it is not the best location for health and fitness facilities for St Helier residents. Therefore, by the end of 2021, there will be the need to create temporary or alternative facilities to enable sport relocation from Fort Regent.

Springfield will be refurbished to provide better public active facilities and a new town community park, with the single stadium pitch replaced with two smaller 5-a-side pitches by 2026/27. However, in the interim, parts of Springfield will be redeveloped to provide more parking.

The plan includes the reprovision of facilities from Fort Regent. By 2030, a new leisure centre will be constructed in the town centre, on the site of the Waterfront centre. The leases on the current Waterfront development terminate in 2027. It will include a large swimming pool, with minimal spectator provision, and of health and fitness space. This will re-accommodate the Aquasplash facility, which will be demolished, and the current fitness facilities at the Fort. Due to the high-density town centre location, there is the opportunity to construct a three-story residential site above the facility.

<text>La vestale (&quot;The Vestal Virgin&quot;) is an opera composed by Gaspare Spontini to a French libretto by Étienne de Jouy. It takes the form of a &quot;tragédie lyrique&quot; in three acts. It was first performed on 15 December 1807 by the Académie Impériale de Musique (Paris Opera) at the Salle Montansier and is regarded as Spontini&#x27;s masterpiece. The musical style shows the influence of Gluck and anticipates the works of Berlioz, Wagner, and French Grand opera.

==Composition history==
Spontini had finished &quot;La vestale&quot; by the summer of 1805 but had faced opposition from leading members of the Opéra and rivalry from fellow composers. The premiere was made possible with the help of Spontini&#x27;s patron, the Empress Joséphine, but only after being rearranged by Jean-Baptiste Rey and Louis-Luc Loiseau de Persuis. &quot;La vestale&quot; was an enormous success, enjoying over two hundred performances by 1830.

==Performance history==
Its fame soon spread abroad; it appeared in Naples and in Vienna in 1811. The full piano score with lyrics in French and German was sold in Germany in 1812, as well as the score for an aria and a duet. In 1814 the opera was performed in Budapest. followed by Stockholm in 1823. It was premiered in the United States in French at Théâtre d&#x27;Orléans in New Orleans on 17 February 1828. Wagner conducted the work in Dresden in 1844 with Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient.

Important 20th-century revivals include those for Rosa Ponselle at the Met in 1925-26 and the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in 1933, for Maria Caniglia in Rome, 1942, and the 1954 production at La Scala with Maria Callas in the title role, which was the first opera staging by the film director Luchino Visconti. There followed other revivals for leading sopranos; Leyla Gencer in Palermo, 1969 and Rome, 1973; Renata Scotto in Florence, 1970; Montserrat Caballé in Barcelona in 1982; and Raina Kabaivanska in Genoa in 1984. Muti reproduced the original version at La Scala in 1993, and English National Opera mounted the opera in London in 2002.

A very memorable performance, on a slippery stage, on the last night of the Wexford Opera Festival in 1979 is described by Bernard Levin.

&quot;La vestale&quot; is famous in historical terms but is only very infrequently performed. Two of its arias (translated to Italian and recorded by Maria Callas and Rosa Ponselle), &quot;Tu che invoco&quot; and &quot;O nume tutelar&quot;, are better known than the work as a whole. In recognition of its role in the development of Richard Wagner&#x27;s third opera, &quot;Rienzi&quot;, it was performed in concert form in Dresden&#x27;s Semperoper in the Summer of 2013, conducted by Gabriele Ferro and starring Francisco Araiza as Cinna, Maria Agresta as Julia, and baritone Christopher Magiera as Licinius.

A parody was staged in Paris in 1808, set in a hatmaker&#x27;s shop.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==

:Place: Rome
:About 269 BC

===Act 1===
Returning to Rome after a victorious campaign, Licinius finds his beloved Julia has become a priestess of Vesta. Although Julia attempts to avoid going to Licinius&#x27;s triumph, she is delegated to present him with a wreath. He tells her that he intends to kidnap and reclaim her.

===Act 2===
In the temple of Vesta, Julia guards the eternal flame and prays to be freed of temptation. Licinius arrives; during their rapturous reconciliation, the flame expires. Licinius is advised by Cinna to flee. Julia is interrogated by the high priest but refuses to name Licinius. She is sentenced to death for licentiousness.

===Act 3===

Despite the pleas of Licinius, Julia is to be buried alive; even when he admits his intrusion to the Temple, Julia claims not to recognise him. A thunderstorm ensues, during which lightning reignites the sacred flame. Recognising this as a sign from the Gods, the High Priest and Vestal Priestess release Julia who is then married to Licinius.

<doc id="356087" wikidata="Q215838" url="?curid=356087" title="John Peter Zenger">
<text>John Peter Zenger(October 26, 1697 – July 28, 1746) was a German printer and journalist in New York City. Zenger printed &quot;The New York Weekly Journal&quot;. He was accused of libel in 1734 by William Cosby, the royal governor of New York, but the jury acquitted Zenger, who became a symbol for freedom of the press.

In 1733, Zenger began printing &quot;The New York Weekly Journal&quot;, which voiced opinions critical of the colonial governor, William Cosby. On November 17, 1734, on Cosby&#x27;s orders, the sheriff arrested Zenger. After a grand jury refused to indict him, the Attorney General Richard Bradley charged him with libel in August 1735. Zenger&#x27;s lawyers, Andrew Hamilton and William Smith, Sr., successfully argued that truth is a defense against charges of libel.

==Early life==
Peter Zenger was born in 1697 in the German Palatinate. Most of the details of his early life are obscure. He was the son of Nicolaus Eberhard Zenger and his wife Johanna. His father was a school teacher in Impflingen in 1701. The Zenger family had other children baptized in Rumbach in 1697 and in 1703 and in Waldfischbach in 1706. The Zenger family immigrated to New York in 1710 as part of a large group of German Palatines, and Nicolaus Zenger was one of those who died before settlement. The governor of New York had agreed to provide apprenticeships for all the children of immigrants from the Palatinate, and John Peter was bound for eight years as an apprentice to William Bradford, the first printer in New York. By 1720, he was taking on printing work in Maryland, though he returned to New York permanently by 1722. After a brief partnership with Bradford in 1725, Zenger set up as a commercial printer on Smith Street in New York City.

On 28 May 1719, Zenger married Mary White in the First Presbyterian Church, Philadelphia. On 24 August 1722, widower Zenger married Anna Catharina Maul in the Collegiate Church, New York. He was the father of many children by his second wife, six of whom survived.

==Libel case ==
In 1733, Zenger printed copies of newspapers in New York to voice his disagreement with the actions of the newly appointed colonial governor William Cosby. On his arrival in New York City, Cosby had plunged into a rancorous quarrel with the colony council over his salary, trying to recoup half of the salary of the previous acting governor Rip Van Dam. Unable to control the colony&#x27;s supreme court, which had ruled against Cosby in the dispute, Cosby removed Chief Justice Lewis Morris, replacing him with the royalist justice James DeLancey. Supported by members of the Popular Party, Zenger&#x27;s &quot;New-York Weekly Journal&quot; continued to publish articles critical of the royal governor. Finally, Cosby issued a proclamation condemning the newspaper&#x27;s &quot;divers scandalous, virulent, false and seditious reflections.&quot;

Zenger was charged with libel. James Alexander was Zenger&#x27;s first counsel, but the court found him in contempt and disbarred him, removing him from the case. After more than eight months in prison, Zenger went to trial, defended by the Philadelphia lawyer Andrew Hamilton and the New York lawyer William Smith, Sr. The case was now a &quot;cause célèbre&quot;, with the public interest at fever-pitch. Rebuffed repeatedly by chief justice James DeLancey during the trial, Hamilton decided to plead his client&#x27;s case directly to the jury. After the lawyers for both sides finished their arguments on August 5, 1735, the jury retired only to return in ten minutes with a verdict of not guilty, a famous example of jury nullification.

In defending Zenger in this landmark case, Hamilton and Smith attempted to establish the precedent that a statement, even if defamatory, is not libelous if it can be proved, thus affirming freedom of the press in America; however, succeeding royal governors clamped down on freedom of the press until the American Revolution. This case is the groundwork of freedom of the press, not its legal precedent. As late as 1804, the journalist Harry Croswell lost a series of prosecutions and appeals because truth was &quot;not&quot; a defense against libel, as decided by the New York Supreme Court in &quot;People v. Croswell&quot;. It was only the following year that the assembly, reacting to this verdict, passed a law that allowed truth as a defense against a charge of libel.

===&quot;Cato&quot; article===
In the February 25, 1733 issue of &quot;The New York Weekly Journal&quot; is an opinion piece written under the pseudonym &quot;Cato.&quot; This was a pen-name used by British writers John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon, whose essays were published as &quot;Cato&#x27;s Letters&quot; (1723). Jeffery A. Smith writes that &quot;Cato&quot; was &quot;The leading luminary of the 18th century libertarian press theory...Editions of &quot;Cato&#x27;s Letters&quot; were published and republished for decades in Britain and were immensely popular in America.&quot; This article gave its readers a preview of the same argument attorneys Hamilton and Smith presented 18 months later in the government&#x27;s libel case against Zenger – that truth is an absolute defense against libel. The words are reprinted from Cato&#x27;s essay &quot;Reflections Upon Libelling&quot;:

==Death==
Zenger died in New York on July 28, 1746, at the age of 48 years old with his wife continuing his printing business.

==Legacy and honors==
During World War II, the Liberty ship was named in his honor.

&quot;Zenger&quot; was a Madison, Wisconsin based underground newspaper that operated during the late 20th century.

Zenger News is a wire service owned and operated by journalists.

A ten foot high limestone statue of John Peter Zenger is mounted on the brick wall of P.S. 18 in the Bronx in New York City. The sculpture was created by sculptor Joseph Kiselewski.

<doc id="356095" wikidata="Q17081219" url="?curid=356095" title="Longest English sentence">
<text>There have been several claims for the &#x27;longest sentence in the English language&#x27; revolving around the longest printed sentence.

Sentences can be made arbitrarily long in various ways. One method is successive iterations, such as 
&quot;Someone thinks that someone thinks that someone thinks that nobody thinks that...,&quot; while another method is combining shorter clauses. Sentences can also be extended by recursively embedding clauses one into another, such as
:&quot;The mouse ran away.&quot;
:&quot;The mouse that the cat hit ran away.&quot;
This also highlights the difference between linguistic performance and linguistic competence, because the language can support more variation than can reasonably be created or recorded. As a result, one linguistics textbook concludes that, in theory, &quot;there is no longest English sentence.&quot;

==Exceptionally long sentences in print==

* &quot;An Accommodating Advertisement and an Awkward Accident&quot;, the 427-word winning entry in &quot;Tit-Bits&quot; Magazine&#x27;s Christmas 1884 competition for &quot;the longest sensible sentence, every word of which begins with the same letter&quot;. 
*Molly Bloom&#x27;s soliloquy in the James Joyce novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1922) contains a sentence of 3,687 words 
*William Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; (1936) contains a sentence composed of 1,288 words (in the 1951 Random House version)
*Jonathan Coe&#x27;s 2001 novel &quot;The Rotters&#x27; Club&quot; has a sentence with 13,955 words. It was inspired by Bohumil Hrabal&#x27;s &quot;Dancing Lessons for the Advanced in Age&quot;: a Czech language novel written in one long sentence.
* &quot;Solar Bones&quot; by Mike McCormack is written as one sentence It won the 2016 Goldsmith&#x27;s prize for experimental fiction, was longlisted for the Booker in 2017 and won the 2018 International Dublin Literary Award. 
*&quot;Ducks, Newburyport&quot; by Lucy Ellmann, a finalist for the 2019 Booker Prize, runs more than a thousand pages, mostly consisting of a single sentence that is 426,100 words long
* &quot;This Book Is the Longest Sentence Ever Written and Then Published&quot; (2020), by humor writer Dave Cowen, consists of one sentence that runs for 111,111 words, and is a stream of consciousness memoir

<text>Manaslu (; , also known as Kutang) is the eighth-highest mountain in the world at above sea level. It is in the Mansiri Himal, part of the Nepalese Himalayas, in west-central Nepal. Manaslu means &quot;mountain of the spirit&quot; and the word is derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;manasa&quot;, meaning &quot;intellect&quot; or &quot;soul&quot;. Manaslu was first climbed on May 9, 1956, by Toshio Imanishi and Gyalzen Norbu, members of a Japanese expedition. It is said that, given the many unsuccessful attempts by the British to climb Everest before Nepali Tenzing Norgay and New Zealander Edmund Hillary, &quot;just as the British consider Everest their mountain, Manaslu has always been a Japanese mountain&quot;.
Manaslu is the highest peak in the Gorkha District and is about east of Annapurna, the tenth highest mountain in the world at 8,091 metres (26,545 ft) above sea level. Manaslu&#x27;s long ridges and valley glaciers offer feasible approaches from all directions and culminate in a peak that towers steeply above its surrounding landscape and is a dominant feature when viewed from afar.

The Manaslu region offers a variety of trekking options. The popular Manaslu trekking route of skirts the Manaslu massif over the pass down to Annapurna. The Nepalese Government only permitted trekking on this circuit in 1991. The trekking trail follows an ancient salt-trading route along the Budhi Gandaki River. En route, 10 peaks over are visible, including a few over . The highest point reached along the trek route is Larkya La at an elevation of . As of May 2008, the mountain has been climbed 297 times with 53 fatalities.

The Manaslu Conservation Area Project (MCAP) was established in 1997 with the primary objective of achieving conservation and sustainable management of the delimited area, which also 
includes Manaslu.

==General==
Set in the northern Himalayan range in the Gorkha District of Nepal, Manaslu is a serrated &quot;wall of snow and ice hanging in the sky&quot;. The three sides of the mountain fall in steps to terraces down below, which are sparsely inhabited with agricultural operations practiced on the land. Apart from climbing Manaslu, trekking is popular in this mountain region, as part of the Manaslu Circuit, a notable path for trekkers in Nepal.

The Manaslu Conservation Area, declared as such in December 1998 under the National Parks and Wild Life Conservation Act, subsumes Manaslu within it. The area covered under the conservation zone is and is managed by the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC) of Nepal. The status of &quot;conservation area&quot; applied to the Manaslu area or region was with the basic objective of &quot;To conserve and sustainable management of the natural resources and rich cultural heritage and to promote ecotourism to improve the livelihood of the local people in the MCA region.&quot;

Manaslu Himal, as it is popularly known among trekkers, provides views of the snow-covered mountains of the Himalayas and allows close interaction with the different ethnic groups who live in hill villages scattered along the trek route.

The trekking route is through mountainous terrain prone to the consequences of monsoon rainfall, landslides, and landfalls. Hypothermia and altitude sickness, as well as encounters with passing yaks, are common. Trekking to Manaslu is thus a test of endurance.

==Geography==
The region, which is also termed the Manaslu Conservation Area, comprises sub-tropical Himalayan foothills to arid Trans-Himalayan high pastures bordering Tibet. Starting from Arughat and extending into the Larkhe La pass, the area covers six climatic zones: the tropical and sub-tropical zone, elevation varies from ; the temperate zone (within elevation range of ; the sub-alpine zone elevation range of ; the alpine zone, a range of ) meadows; and the arctic zone (lying above ). The zones coalesce with the variation of the altitude from about in the tropical zone to the summit of Manaslu in the arctic zone.
Manaslu is known in the Tibetan language as &quot;Kutan l&quot;, in which &quot;tang&quot; means the Tibetan word for a flat place. It is a very large peak with an elevation of (the world&#x27;s eighth-highest mountain). In view of its favorable topography of long ridges and glacial valleys, Manaslu offers several routes to mountaineers. Important peaks surrounding Manaslu include Ngadi Chuli, Himalchuli and Baudha. A glacial saddle known as Larkya La, with an elevation of , lies north of Manaslu. The peak is bounded on the east by the Ganesh Himal and the Buri Gandaki River gorge, on the west by the deep fissures of the Marysyangdi Khola with its Annapurna range of hills, and to the south is the Gorkha town at the foot of the hill (from where trekking operates during the season), which is an aerial distance of to the peak. There are six established trek routes to the peak, and the south face is reportedly the most difficult for climbing.

===Climate===

The permanent snow line is reckoned above elevation. Precipitation in the area is both from snowfall and rainfall; the average annual rainfall is about , mostly during the monsoon period, which extends from June to September. The temperatures in the area also vary widely with the climatic zone: in the subtropical zone, the average summer and winter temperatures vary in the range of and respectively; in the temperate climatic zone, the summer temperatures are and winter temperatures are when snow and frost are also experienced; in the subalpine zone, during December to May snowfall generally occurs and the mean annual temperature is . The Arctic zone is distinct and falls within the permanent snow line; there, the temperatures lie much below freezing.

====Major peaks====
There are other major peaks in the region, namely Himalchuli (), Ngadi Chuli (), Shringi (), Langpo () and Saula ().

== Ecosystem ==
===Fauna===
Unlike many other regions, this valley is a sanctuary to many highly endangered animals, including snow leopards and red pandas. Other mammals include lynx, Asian black bear, grey wolf, dhole, Assam macaque, Himalayan musk deer, blue sheep, Himalayan tahr, mainland serow, Himalayan goral, woolly hare, horseshoe bat, Himalayan mouse-hare, and black-lipped pika. Over 110 species of birds, 33 mammals, 11 butterflies, and 3 reptiles have been recorded. Conservation of wildlife in the area has been achieved by monks of the monasteries in the area by putting a hunting ban in place. This action has helped wildlife to prosper. The area is now an important habitat for the snow leopard, grey wolf, musk deer, blue sheep, and the Himalayan tahr.

Some 110 species of birds have been identified in the area, including golden eagle, Eurasian griffon, Himalayan griffon, blood, impeyan, kalij and koklass pheasants, Himalayan and Tibetan snow cocks, and the crimson horned pheasant.

===Vegetation===
Three main categories of vegetation have been identified in the area. These are categorized on the basis of altitude as low hill, middle mountain, and high mountain types with exclusive types of dominant forests and other associated species. The types of vegetation, however, tend to overlap the adjoining ones at places. Depending on the microclimate and other aspects, an overlap of vegetation is noticed in adjacent areas. However, the forest types are fairly well-defined. The flora in different forest types also does not show much variation. The valley basin has a rich ecotone diversity and includes nineteen different types of forests, most prominently rhododendron, and also Himalayan blue pine, which is flanked by Ganesh Himal and the Sringi ranges. Medicinal herbs and aromatic plants have also been recorded in different forest types and adjoining vegetation. Overall, the presence of 19 types of forests and other forms of dominant vegetation have been recorded from the area. An estimated 1,500–2,000 plant species grow here.

==Ethnic groups==
There are two ethnicities mainly inhabiting this region; Nubri and Tsum. The branching off of the river at Chhikur divides these two ethnic domains. While Nubri has been frequently visited since Nepal opened itself for tourism in 1950, Tsum still retains much of its traditional culture, art, and tradition. In the central hills of the region, Gurungs are the main ethnic group who have joined the Brigade of Gurkhas in large numbers. Closer to Tibet, the Bhutias (also spelled Bhotias), akin to the Sherpa group, of Tibetan ethnicity dominate the scene as can be discerned from their flat-roofed houses, and they are distinctly Buddhists. The region is dotted with austere monasteries, mani walls, chortens and other Buddhist religious landmarks.

==Climbing history==

In 1950, H. W. Tilman was the first European to lead an expedition to the Annapurna Range with a small party of five compatriots. They walked on foot from the Kathmandu valley (six days of trekking from the valley), and using Manang as their base camp they started exploring the mountain ranges, peaks, and valleys of the Annapurna massif. During this exploration, while making a reconnaissance of the higher reaches of the Dudh Khola, they clearly saw Manaslu from Bumtang. Three months later, after their aborted trip to Annapurna IV, Tilman, accompanied by Major J. O. M. Roberts, trekked to Larkya La pass and from there saw Manaslu and its plateau and concluded that there was a direct route to the summit, although they did not make an attempt on it.

After the reconnaissance visit by Tilman, there were four Japanese expeditions between 1950 and 1955 that explored the possibility of climbing Manaslu by the north and east faces.

In 1952, a Japanese reconnaissance party visited the area after the monsoon season. In the following year (1953), a team of 15 climbers led by Y. Mita, after setting up base camp at Samagaon, attempted to climb via the east side but failed to reach the summit. In this first attempt by a Japanese team to summit via the northeast face, three climbers reached a height of , before turning back.

In 1954, a Japanese team approaching the Buri Gandaki route to the peak faced a hostile group of villagers at Samagaon camp. The villagers thought that the previous expeditions had displeased the gods, causing the avalanches that destroyed the Pung-gyen Monastery and the death of 18 people. As a result of this hostility, the team made a hasty retreat to Ganesh Himal. To appease local sentiments, a large donation was made to rebuild the monastery. However, this philanthropic act did not ease the atmosphere of distrust and hostility towards Japanese expeditions. Even the expedition in 1956 which successfully climbed the mountain faced this situation and as a result the next Japanese expedition only took place in 1971.

In 1956, Toshio Imanishi (Japan) and Gyaltsen Norbu (Sherpa) made the first ascent of Manaslu on May 9, 1956. The Japanese expedition was led by Maki Yūkō, also known as Aritsune Maki.

In 1956, David Snellgrove, a noted scholar in Tibetan culture and religion, undertook a seven-month sojourn of mid-west and central Nepal. The route that he followed, accompanied by three Nepalese people, was via Bumtang and Buri Gandaki river and crossing over to the Larkya La.

===1970s===
The next successful climb to the summit of Manaslu was in 1971. On May 17, 1971, Kazuharu Kohara and Motoki, part of an 11-man Japanese team, reached the summit via the north-west spur. Also in 1971, Kim Ho-sup led a Korean expedition attempt via the north-east face. Kim Ki-sup fell to his death on May 4. In 1972, the south-west face was climbed for the first time by Reinhold Messner as part of an Austrian expedition. In 1972, the Koreans attempted the north-east face. On April 10, an avalanche buried their camp at , killing fifteen climbers including ten Sherpas and the Korean expedition leader Kim Ho-sup, and Kazunari Yasuhisa from Japan. On April 22, 1973, Gerhard Schmatz, Sigi Hupfauer and a Sherpa climber reached the summit via the north-east face. In the same year, a Spanish expedition led by Jaume Garcia Orts could reach only to . The first Japanese women expedition led by Kyoko Sato was successful on May 4, 1974, when all members reached the summit after a failed attempt from the east ridge. They thus became the first women to climb a peak higher than. However, one climber died on May 5 when she fell between camps 4 and 5.
===1980s===
In the pre-monsoon period of 1980, a South Korean team led by Li In-jung reached the summit via the normal route, which was the eighth ascent to the peak. The year 1981 marked several expeditions: the largest contingent of 13 climbers of a team organized by the Sport-Eiselin of Zurich led by H. V. Kaenel, made it to the summit along the normal route; in autumn, French mountaineers opened a new route, a variation of the west face route; and a Japanese team, led by Y. Kato, made an ascent via the normal route. In 1983, two climbers from Yugoslavia, trying to climb the peak from the south face, were buried under an avalanche. One of them was Nejc Zaplotnik, a notable climber of Slovenian origin. A Korean team reached the summit in the autumn of the same year. A German team led by G. Harter was successful in climbing the peak via the south face, which followed the &quot;1972 Tyrolean Route&quot;.

On May 10, 1983, four men from the Joint Services East Nepal Expedition made the first British ascent of Manaslu North using a totally new route, special permission from the Nepalese Government having been granted to access an area normally denied to Europeans; the team was led by Major Douglas Keelan of the Royal Marines and included members from the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and Royal Marines.

During the winter of 1983–84, a Polish team led by L. Korniszewski successfully followed the Tyrolean Route. On January 12, 1984, Maciej Berbeka and Ryszard Gajewski of that expedition made the first winter ascent via the normal route.

In the spring season of 1984, a Yugoslav team led by A. Kunaver climbed the peak via the south face. During the same year, in autumn, Polish teams climbed the south ridge and south-east face.

On November 9, 1986, Jerzy Kukuczka, Artur Hajzer, and Carlos Carsolio made the first climb of the east summit (7894 m) of Manaslu. The next day, Kukuczka and Hajzer reached the summit via a new route, ascending the east ridge and descending the north-east face.

===1990s===
On May 2, 1993, Sepp Brunner, Gerhard Floßmann, Sepp Hinding and Dr. Michael Leuprecht reached the summit via the normal route and descended on skis from to the basecamp. The Austrian expedition was led by Arthur Haid. On December 8, 1995, Anatoli Boukreev summited Manaslu with the Second Kazakhstan Himalaya Expedition. On May 12, 1996, Carlos Carsolio and his younger brother Alfredo, reached the summit of Manaslu. For Carsolio it was his fourteenth and final eight-thousander, becoming the fourth person in history and the youngest to achieve the feat. In 1997, Charlie Mace made the first American ascent.

===2000s===
During the spring of 2000, there were four expeditions to Manaslu. One climb was on the east face by the &#x27;Japan 2000 Expedition&#x27; led by Yoshio Maruyama. The other three were on the north-east ridge: the ETB 2000 Expedition of Spain led by Felix Maria I. Iriate; the 2000 Korean Manaslu Expedition of Korea led by Han Wang Yong; and the Manaslu 2000 Expedition from Italy led by Franco Brunello. On May 22, 2001, a three-member team of Ukraine Himalaya 2001 Expedition comprising Serguiy Kovalov, Vadim Leontiev and Vladislav Terzyul successfully summited Manaslu via the challenging south-east face; all climbed without oxygen support. During the autumn of 2001, three members and a sherpa of the Japan Workers Alpine Federation climbed the peak via the north-east face on October 9, 2001.

On May 13, 2002, five Americans, Tom Fitzsimmons, Jerome Delvin, Michael McGuffin, Dan Percival and Brian Sato and two Sherpas reached the summit.

Piotr Pustelnik and Krzysztof Tarasewicz climbed Manaslu on May 17, 2003. However, Dariusz Zaluski, Anna Czerwinska and Barbara Drousek, who started the climb after Piotr and Krzysztof, had to turn back due to strong winds and bad weather. With this ascent Pustelnik had summited 12 on his way to summiting the world&#x27;s 14 highest peaks.

On May 29, 2006, Australian mountaineer Sue Fear died after falling into a crevasse on her descent after summiting.

On December 1, 2006, former Formula 1 driver Ukyo Katayama achieved his lifetime ambition of climbing Manaslu, after a prior unsuccessful attempt in 2004.

In 2008, Valerie Parkinson was the first British woman to climb Manaslu.

===2010s===
In 2011 Arjun Vajpai, an Indian mountaineer, summitted Manaslu on October 5 and became the youngest climber in the world to have summitted Manaslu at the age of 18.

Eleven climbers were killed in an avalanche on September 23, 2012. American free skier Glen Plake, who had planned to ski down Manaslu without supplemental oxygen, was a survivor.

On September 25, 2014, Polish ski-mountaineer Andrzej Bargiel set a record time from base camp to summit at 14 hours 5 minutes and also record time for base-peak-base of 21 hours 14 minutes.

=== 2020s ===

In 2021 Qatari mountaineer, Asma Al Thani, summited and became the first Arab to do so without oxygen.

On the morning of September 26, 2022, an avalanche struck the route 24,000 ft., just below Camp IV at Mount Manaslu, enveloping 13 climbers which also killed Nepali guide Anup Rai. The climbers were ferrying logistics to the high camps before their summit push. On the same day, American ski mountaineer Hilaree Nelson fell down more than 1,800 metres (6,000 ft) from the summit of Mount Manaslu while skiing with her partner, Jim Morrison. On September 28 her body was located above the Thulagi glacier on the south-west face of Mount Manaslu and was flown to Kathmandu by rescuers.

On January 6, 2023, Spanish alpinist Alex Txikon, along with six sherpa climbers, made a successful winter ascent of Mount Manaslu, which had not been summited in winter in over 20 years.

On September 23, 2023, Nawal Sfendla became the first Moroccan to summit Manaslu.

===Risk===
Traditionally, the &quot;spring&quot; or &quot; pre-monsoon&quot; season is the least hazardous for bad weather, snowfall, and avalanches. Manaslu is one of the more risky 8000ers to climb: as of May 2008, there have been 297 ascents of Manaslu and 53 deaths on the mountain, making it &quot;the 4th most dangerous 8000m peak, behind Annapurna, Nanga Parbat, and K2.&quot;

====Avalanches====
*2012 September: Nine people were killed and several went missing. The dead included Nepali, a Spanish and four French nationals. Five climbers were rescued after the avalanche.
*2022 September 26: Anup Rai, a Nepali mountain guide, died in the avalanche while ferrying loads to Camp IV.
*2022 October 1: An avalanche on the lower flanks of the mountain killed Nepali guide Dawa Chhiring Sherpa, who had been descending from Camp 2 to Camp 1.

===Verification issues===
Manaslu has been identified as being one of the most problematic eight-thousanders for summit verification. Like Shishapangma, Manaslu has a false summit that is separated from the true summit by a long and dangerous sharp corniced ridge. In 2021, an investigation by a team of international experts reported in the &quot;American Alpine Journal&quot; that the vast majority of climbers who claimed to have summited Manaslu had not in fact stood on the true peak.

==Trekking in the region==

The Manaslu region offers a variety of trekking options. The Manaslu Circuit Trek now usually starts in Arughat Bazaar and ends two to three weeks later in Besisahar, the starting point of the Annapurna Circuit Trek. Until recently the trek required camping, but building of tea-houses means the trek can be completed using local accommodation. The trek requires a Manaslu Restricted Area Permit and Manaslu Conservation Area Permit. The restricted area permit costs $100 US per week in autumn and $70 US per week in other seasons, whereas the conservation area permit costs a straight $30 US. Trekkers are required to travel in a group of at least two persons with a registered guide. The trek lies on the newly developed Great Himalaya Trail.

The best season to hike the circuit is spring (March, April, or May), just before the monsoon season begins. During this period, you can expect dry trails, stable weather, excellent visibility, and long trekking days. Similarly, autumn (September, October, and November) is another good season for the circuit, following the monsoon season.

The trek follows an ancient salt-trading route along the steep sided Budhi Gandaki river. From Deng, the slopes of ravines ease and views of snow peaks start appearing from Ligaon (Lhi). Further from Lhogaon (Lho), an impressive view of Manaslu, with its double peak, appears described as &quot;a soaring monarch with a double-edged summit towering above fields of barley.&quot;
The route follows the pine-forested Syala village, which has the backdrop of many horseshoe-shaped peaks, and reaches the village of Samagaon (Sama) at the foot of Manaslu. There is a Buddhist monastery at Samagaon, where monks and nuns reside. After half a day&#x27;s trek from Samagaon, the village of Samdo is reached. Samdo is the highest village in the Budhi Gandaki valley and is inhabited by Bhotias. This village commands a view of the valley and Pang Phuchi village with a backdrop of the Tibetan border. Further trekking leads along a major secondary valley to the Larkha La (Larkja La). Along this route, Cheo Himal, Himlung Himal (Nemjung) and Kang Guru are seen, along with occasional views of the Annapurna Massif. From here, the meadowland of Bimtang (Bimdakhoti) at elevation is reached, from where Manaslu is clearly visible. From Manaslu, the circuit passes through Dudh Khola (a tributary of Marshyangdi river), criss-crosses Marsyangdi River before reaching Bhulbule, Tarukha Ghat, crosses the Chepe Khola and Dorandi Khola before returning to Gorkha.

Two alternative routes are also popular. One is on the Annapurna Circuit trail but leaves it at Dharapani to reach Manang, crossing Thorong La and Jomsom (Kali Gandaki valley). From Jomsom flights depart to Pokhara. The other alternative route is from Bhulbule, crossing Marsyangdi to Khudi, divert from Annapurna trail and trek cross country through valleys and ridges to Sisuwa town on the bank of Begnas Tal. From here a road approach is available to Pokhara.

When trekking through the Manaslu region, ten peaks of over in height are visible, including peaks of over elevation. People add Tsum Valley and the Ganesh Himal Base Camp as acclimatization trips before going on expeditions through the high passes. The Tsum region, which was restricted for tourists for a long time, is now the centre of attraction for trekkers, with the government of Nepal recently opening it for group tourists. In order to retain its pristine culture and sustain its fragile ecosystem, the Tsum Welfare Committee is involved in the promotion of responsible tourism in Tsum. However, local participation for sustainable tourism is still a challenging task with a long road ahead.

==Area development project==
Under loan funds provided by the Asian Development Bank, the government of Nepal has an infrastructure project titled &quot;Manaslu Eco-tourism Development Project&quot; under implementation. The objective is to improve the capacity of the Manaslu area to support tourism in an environmentally benign manner.

<text>Salamone Rossi or Salomone Rossi () (Salamon, Schlomo; de&#x27; Rossi) (ca. 1570 – 1630) was an Italian Jewish violinist and composer. He was a transitional figure between the late Italian Renaissance period and early Baroque.

==Life==
As a young man, Rossi acquired a reputation as a talented violinist. He was then hired (in 1587) as a court musician in Mantua, where records of his activities as a violinist survive.

Rossi served at the court of Mantua from 1587 to 1628 as concertmaster where he entertained the ducal family and their highly esteemed guests. The composers Rossi, Monteverdi, Gastoldi, Wert and Viadana provided fashionable music for banquets, wedding feasts, theatre productions and chapel services amongst others. Rossi was so well-thought of at this court that he was excused from wearing the yellow badge that was required of other Jews in Mantua.

Rossi died during the War of the Mantuan Succession, probably either in the invasion of Austrian troops, who defeated the Gonzagas and destroyed the Jewish ghetto in Mantua, or in the subsequent episode of plague which ravaged the area.

Rossi&#x27;s sister, Madama Europa, was an opera singer, and possibly the first Jewish woman to be professionally engaged in that area. Like her brother, she was employed at the court in Mantua; she is thought to have performed in the &quot;intermedio&quot; &quot;Il Ratto di Europa,&quot; by Gabriello Chiabrera and Gastoldi, during the wedding festivities for Francesco Gonzaga in 1608. She also disappeared after the end of the Gonzaga court and subsequent sack of the ghetto.

==Works==

===Italian===
His first published work (released in 1589) was a collection of 19 canzonettes, short, dance-like compositions for a trio of voices with lighthearted, amorous lyrics. Rossi also flourished in his composition of more serious madrigals, combining the poetry of the greatest poets of the day (e.g. Guarini, Marino, Rinaldi, and Celiano) with his melodies. In 1600, in the first two of his five madrigal books, Rossi published the earliest continuo madrigals, an innovation which partially defined the beginning of the Baroque era in music; these particular compositions included tablature for chitarrone.

Rossi published 150 secular works in Italian, including:

Canzonette a 3, Libro primo
* I bei ligustri, for 3 voices
* Correte amanti, for 3 voices
* S&#x27;el Leoncorno, for 3 voices

Madrigali a 5, Libro primo
* Cor Mio, madrigal for 5 voices
* Dir mi che piu non ardo, madrigal for 5 voices

===Instrumental===
In the field of instrumental music Rossi was a bold innovator. He was one of the first composers to apply to instrumental music the principles of monodic song, in which one melody dominates over secondary accompanying parts. His trio sonatas, among the first in the literature, provided for the development of an idiomatic and virtuoso violin technique. They stand midway between the homogeneous textures of the instrumental canzona of the late Renaissance and the trio sonata of the mature Baroque.

Works published, and preserved today include:
* Il primo libro delle sinfonie e gagliarde a 3–5 voci (1607)
* Il secondo libro delle sinfonie e gagliarde a 3–5 voci (1608)
* Il terzo libro de varie sonate, sinfonie (1613)
* Il quarto libro de varie sonate, sinfonie (1622)

===Hebrew===
Rossi also published a collection of Jewish liturgical music, השירים אשר לשלמה &quot;(Ha-shirim asher li-Shlomo, The Songs of Solomon)&quot; in 1623. This was written in the Baroque tradition and (almost) entirely unconnected to traditional Jewish cantorial music. This was an unprecedented development in synagogal music. The biblical &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; does not appear within &quot;The Songs of Solomon&quot;, hence the name is probably a pun on Rossi&#x27;s first name (Rikko 1969). It is the earliest known published collection of liturgical music in Hebrew; there would not be another for two hundred years.

The publication begins with an introductory essay by the rabbi and scholar Leon of Modena. It praises Rossi&#x27;s works and makes a case for the halachic suitability of composed music in Jewish liturgy, based on biblical precedents. 

Rossi set many Biblical Hebrew texts to music in their original Hebrew language, which makes him unique among Baroque composers. His vocal music resembles that of Claudio Monteverdi and Luigi Rossi, but its lyrics are in Hebrew.

<doc id="356100" wikidata="Q1648033" url="?curid=356100" title="F. A. Mitchell-Hedges">
<text>Frederick Albert Mitchell-Hedges (sometimes known as Mike; 22 October 1882 – 12 June 1959) was an English adventurer, traveller and writer. 

Mitchell-Hedges was known for his connection to the Mitchell-Hedges crystal skull, claimed to have been found with his adopted daughter Anna Mitchell-Hedges in Lubaantun, British Honduras (now Belize) in 1924. Archival evidence shows that the elder Mitchell-Hedges bought the skull at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction in 1943, and other of his finds are also in question.

==Personal life==
Born in London in 1882, Mitchell-Hedges attended school until he was 16. During his younger years, he worked for his father, John Hedges, in his stockbroking company. While Frederick expressed interest in exploring at a young age, John was against the idea of his son travelling, making their relationship a difficult one. After a trip to Canada, Frederick married Lillian Clarke in 1906. The two mostly lived apart from each other and whilst they had no children of their own they adopted Canadian orphan Anne Marie Le Guillon, today known as Anna Mitchell-Hedges. Mitchell-Hedges continued to travel well into his latter years until he died in 1959.

==Travels==
Shortly following his 16th birthday, Mitchell-Hedges took his first trip with Brooke Mee on an expedition to Norway. The trip lasted three weeks and upon returning to London Mitchell-Hedges had high hopes of becoming an explorer.

After marrying Lillian, Mitchell-Hedges took a trip to Canada where he met and eventually adopted Anne Marie Le Guillon. He continued to travel through Northern and Central America. He found himself in Mexico where he was captured by Pancho Villa and worked as a spy, then in New York and back to Central America. Mitchell-Hedges also had a growing interest in the lost city of Atlantis which continued to influence his curiosity for travel.

While on his many excursions, Mitchell-Hedges repeatedly made claims of having &quot;discovered&quot; Indian tribes and &quot;lost cities&quot; that had already been documented years, sometimes centuries, before. In addition, Mitchell-Hedges made claims of finding &quot;the cradle of civilisation&quot; in the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua, and stated that the Bay Islands of Honduras were remnants of the lost civilisation of Atlantis.

For a time in the 1930s the adventurist had a weekly radio show out of New York City on Sunday evenings. Talking over a background of &quot;jungle drums&quot;, Mitchell-Hedges would tell dramatic tales of his trips, usually including narrow escapes from death at the hands of &quot;savages&quot; or from jungle animals ranging from a jaguar to a vicious attacking iguana.

==Findings==

Among other findings, Mitchell-Hedges&#x27; claim to fame was his &quot;discovery&quot; of a &quot;crystal skull&quot;. He claimed to have found it with his daughter Anna at the Maya ruin of Lubaantun while on an expedition to British Honduras (present-day Belize) in the 1920s. However, he made no record of the skull until the late 1940s, after a crystal skull was auctioned off by Sydney Burney at Sotheby&#x27;s in October 1943. Moreover in December 1943, F.A. Mitchell-Hedges disclosed in a letter to his brother that he had recently acquired the skull in an auction from Burney, paying £400. Controversies continued when identical measurements were found between Sotheby&#x27;s skull and Mitchell-Hedges&#x27; skull, leaving the authenticity of this artifact questionable at best.

Mitchell-Hedges&#x27; crystal skull was retained in the possession of his adopted daughter until her death on 11 April 2007. Prior to her death, the skull was only shown to the public periodically, making it hard for the skull to be accessed and tested for authenticity.

Since Anna&#x27;s death the skull has been examined thoroughly and despite many previous claims, the skull has been dated as post-Columbus era. Based on microscopic evidence, the skull&#x27;s tool markings are a result of modern equipment and not of tools found in ancient Maya sites.

==Legacy==
Mitchell-Hedges is said to have inspired the character Indiana Jones. However, neither George Lucas nor Steven Spielberg—co-creators of the successful concept and franchise—have indicated that any specific individual inspired their character, other than the generic stock heroes popularised in the series and pulp magazines of the 1930s and 1940s.

==Published works==
Books and other titles written by Mitchell-Hedges include:
*&quot;Battles With Giant Fish&quot;
*&quot;Danger, My Ally&quot;
*&quot;Land of Wonder and Fear&quot;

Concerning &quot;Land of Wonder and Fear&quot;, prominent British archaeologist J. Eric S. Thompson commented that &quot;to me the wonder was how he could write such nonsense and the fear how much taller the next yarn would be&quot;.

<doc id="356113" wikidata="Q1436903" url="?curid=356113" title="1932 Ford">
<text>The term 1932 Ford may refer to three models of automobile produced by Ford Motors between 1932 and 1934: the Model B, the Model 18, and the Model 40. These succeeded the Model A. The Model B had an updated four-cylinder engine and was available from 1932 to 1934. The V8 was available in the Model 18 in 1932, and in the Model 40 in 1933 &amp; 1934. The 18 was the first Ford fitted with the flathead V-8. The company also replaced the Model AA truck with the Model BB, available with either the four- or eight-cylinder engine.

The three car models were replaced by the streamlined Model 48 in 1935 which used the same chassis as its predecessor. The 1937 Ford would be the last to use the old 1932 chassis until 1940 when the car line of Ford was completely redesigned.

== Technical ==
Rather than just updating the Model A, Ford launched a completely new vehicle for 1932. The V8 was marketed as the Model 18 in its initial year, but was commonly known as the Ford V‑8. It had the new flathead V8 engine. The Model 18 was the first low-priced, mass-marketed car to have a V8 engine -- an important milestone in the American automotive industry. The V8 was rated at , but power increased significantly with improvements to the carburetor and ignition in succeeding years. The V8 was more popular than the four-cylinder, which was essentially a variant of the Model A engine with improvements to balancing and lubrication.

The Model B was derived with as few technical changes as possible to keep cost low. It was virtually indistinguishable from the V-8, aside from the engine and the badging on the hub caps and headlamp support bar (later: grille). Its intention was to be a price leader, and, as it offered more than the popular Model A, this should have been a winning formula. In fact, the newer and only slightly more expensive V-8 stole the show, and made the Model B obsolete. The V8 engine was previously exclusive to Lincoln products, which, in 1932, switched to V12 engines only.

Although there was a certain visual similarity with the predecessor Model A, the car was of new design. While the Model A had a simple frame with two straight longitudinal members, the new car received a longer wheelbase, along with an outward curved, double-dropped chassis. In both models, the fuel tank was relocated from the cowl, as it was in the Model A and late Model T (where the back of the tank formed the dashboard), to the lower rear of the car, as is typical in modern vehicles. This required Ford to include an engine-driven fuel pump, rather than rely on gravity feed. While the V8 was developed from scratch, the B had an improved four-cylinder Model A engine of displacement producing .

==1932==
When Ford introduced the Model A in late 1927, there were several competitors also offering four-cylinder cars, among them Chevrolet, Dodge, Durant, and Willys. That changed within a few years, soon leaving the new Plymouth the sole major make in the Ford&#x27;s price class with a four.

Although sharing a common platform, Model Bs and Model 18s came not only in Standard and Deluxe trim, they were available in a large variety of body styles. Some of them, such as the commercial cars described below, were only available as Standards, and a few other came only in Deluxe trim. There were two-door roadster, two-door cabriolet, four-door phaeton, two and four-door sedans, four-door &quot;woodie&quot; station wagon, two-door convertible sedan, panel and sedan deliveries, five-window coupe, a sport coupe (stationary softtop), the three-window Deluxe Coupe, and pickup. The wooden panels were manufactured at the Ford Iron Mountain Plant in the Michigan Upper Peninsula from Ford owned lumber. One of the more well known and popular models was the two-door Victoria, which was largely designed by Edsel Ford. It was a smaller version of the Lincoln Victoria coupe, built on the Lincoln K-series chassis with a V8 engine; by 1933 Lincoln no longer used a V8 and only offered the V12, with the V8 now exclusive to Ford branded vehicles.

Prices ranged from US$495 for the roadster, $490 for the coupés, and $650 for the convertible sedan. Production totals numbered from 12,597 for the roadster to 124,101 for the two-door sedan. Ford sold 298,647 V8-powered 18s in 1932, and except for the fact Ford could not keep up with V8 demand, the essentially identical four-cylinder B would have been a sales disaster: dealers switched customers to them from the V8, and even then sold only 133,539, in part because the V8 cost just US$10 more.

The B was discontinued because buyers disliked four-cylinder models in general, and because of the huge success of the V8, not for being an inferior car. In fact, it persisted a little longer in Europe, where in many countries the tax system heavily favored smaller-displacement engines.

All 1932 Fords—V8-8s and Model Bs—came with black fenders, wire wheels, and a rear-mounted spare wheel (side mounted on cars equipped with a tail gate). Options included single or twin side mounts, luggage rack, clock, interior and exterior mirrors, and choice of leather or (for closed cars) broadcloth interior material. Paints were Pyroxylin (nitrocellulose) lacquer.
One special type was the flathead V8-engined B400, of which only 842 were made. This was a two-door cabrio coach, a convertible coupe with fixed side window frames. Most of them were exported for overseas markets or ambassador use. Since sales were poor, it was soon discontinued, becoming the rarest of 1932 Fords. The B400 bodystyle was replaced by a more expensive full convertible.

===Standard and Deluxe trim===
The B shared frame, bodies, and even most of the trim with the eight-cylinder car. The only technical difference was the use of the slightly reworked Model A engine, thus the designation B. Most body styles were available as Standard or Deluxe variants with either engine as an option. Customers could get a Deluxe 1932 Model B as a roadster, phaeton, Tudor, or Fordor, as well as the Deluxe-only three-window coupé.

Standard trim meant black front window frame, black wire wheels (color optional), black horn (chrome-plated optional), single tail light (second optional), painted dash, position lights integrated in the head lamps (Deluxe cowl lamps optional), and less expensive interiors.

==1933==
When the Model 40 and the new B were introduced February 9, 1933, revisions of the car were substantial, especially considering how important the 1932 change had been. For its second year, the wheelbase was stretched, from 106 in (2692 mm) to 112 in (2845 mm) on a new crossmember frame. The grille was revised, gaining a pointed forward slope at the bottom which resembled either a spade, a Medieval shield, or possibly the 1932 Packard Light Eight in general outline anyway. Both the grille and hood louvers curved down and forward. The overall design and grille were inspired by the English Ford Model Y. Streamlining was further accentuated by the new hood which now covered the cowl, giving an impression of more length. In addition, there were more rounded and skirted fenders and new, elegantly bowed bumpers. Headlamp support bars were no longer in use, and there were new wire wheels. The cars got a new dashboard with instruments set in an oval insert in front of the driver. There was a glove box on the passenger side. Closed Deluxe models received heavy DI-NOC (PVC) woodgraining on dash and window frames, and there were deeper seat cushions.

There were 10 body styles (14 if standard and Deluxe trim levels are counted separately). Now, all were available for V-8s and the Model B, which thus got Deluxe models, too. Convertible Coupes and Victoria came in Deluxe trim only, and the most expensive car in the line, the &quot;woody&quot;, as a Standard only. It cost US$590 with the four-cylinder engine.

The cars gained about 3 percent in weight, compensated for with more powerful engines, as on the V-8 with its 15 percent increase in power.

===&quot;Model C&quot;===
Power from the V8 rose to 75 hp (56 kW) with a revised ignition system. The four-cylinder engine continued unchanged, but was referred to (by some) as the Model C, though Ford never referred to its &quot;Improved Four-Cylinder engine&quot; as a &quot;Model C&quot; engine. There is some dispute over this; some sources say it was a common misconception due to the introduction of a larger counterbalanced crankshaft during the Model B engine production, and the letter &quot;C&quot; casting mark on most, but not all, of the Model B heads. On the other side, this integrally counterweighted crankshaft was first introduced for truck engines only. When they proved superior concerning smoothness and longevity, they were introduced for worldwide four cylinder production. Together with the fact that there were huge quantities of &quot;B&quot; code engines in stock that needed to be used up, this explains why there are &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; coded engines in some model years. As Canadian-built cars used the prefix &quot;C&quot; on their identification plates, there is another source for errors. Model Bs start with prefix &quot;AB&quot;, V-8s with &quot;18-1&quot;. (Model A part number suffix was ‑A, Police Special High Compression head part number suffix was ‑b, and there was a fairly large letter &quot;B&quot; casting mark about the center of the head.)

==1934==

The 1934 Ford (the Model 40B) was not as substantial a model year change as the previous two years had been. Noticeable changes included a flatter grille with a wider surround and fewer bars, straight hood louvers, two handles on each side of the hood, smaller head lights and cowl lamps, and a reworked logo. The bare metal dash insert was replaced by painted steel.

V‑8 output was again increased, this time to 85 hp (63 kW), and the four-cylinder Model B engine was in its last year, as was the Victoria body style; nevertheless, there were fourteen body options, the Tudor being top-seller. The standard three-window coupe was deleted.

Deluxes had pinstriping, again twin (chromed) horns, and twin back lights. Inside, they got more elaborate wood graining.

The 1934 Ford V-8 is well-known for having been the vehicle in which the notorious Depression-era bandits Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow were ambushed and killed. Barrow preferred to steal the powerful Ford V-8, and was driving a 1934 sedan on May 23, 1934, when a heavily armed law enforcement posse opened fire and riddled the pair with bullets and buckshot in Bienville Parish, Louisiana.
===1934 Model 40 Special Speedster===
Edsel Ford commissioned Ford&#x27;s chief designer, E.T. &quot;Bob&quot; Gregorie to design and supervise the construction of a personal sports car based on a style of period sports car Mr. Ford had seen in Europe. A special two seat roadster was built from aluminum and installed with a flathead V8 engine. Only one was built and is currently at the Ford House museum.

==Hot-rod variants==
The 1932–1934 Fords are extremely popular with hot rodders. During the period after WWII, Model Bs and 18s were favored. This continued into the 1960s on a large scale. Today, the roadster and coupe are the most sought-after body styles, making unmodified examples rare. Since the 1970s, 1932 bodies and frames have been reproduced either in fiberglass or lately in steel, which has increased the number of cars being created or restored, typically as hot rods. These are often very expensive, and a typical show-quality car may sell for $60,000 or more.



===Deuce coupe===

A deuce coupe (&quot;deuce&quot; indicating the year &quot;2&quot; in 1932) is a 1932 Ford coupe. The Model 18 coupe with its more powerful V8 engine was more popular than the four-cylinder Model B coupe. In the 1940s, the Model 18 was plentiful and cheap enough for young men to buy, becoming the basis for an ideal hot rod. Customizers would strip surplus weight off and &quot;hop up&quot; the engine for power - a metaphor drawing from one&#x27;s behavior becoming more raucous when &quot;hopped up&quot; on beer. These &quot;hot rods&quot; came in two body styles, the more common 5-window and the rarer suicide door 3-window. The iconic stature of the 1932-vintage Ford in hot rodding inspired The Beach Boys to write their hit 1963 song &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot;, which also was the name of the album it appeared on. The deuce coupe was also featured prominently in the 1973 hit film &quot;American Graffiti&quot;. The car is also famously referenced in the 1973 Bruce Springsteen song, Blinded by the Light, made popular by Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band in 1977.

Typical of builds from before World War Two were &#x27;35 Ford wire-spoke wheels. Immediately postwar, most hot rods changed from mechanical to hydraulic (&quot;juice&quot;) brakes and from bulb to sealed-beam headlights. The &quot;gow job&quot; morphed into the &quot;hot rod&quot; in the early to middle 1950s. The mid-1950s and early 1960s custom deuce was typically fenderless and steeply chopped, and almost all Ford (or Mercury, with the flathead, introduced in 1939). A Halibrand quick-change rearend was also typical, and an Edelbrock intake manifold or Harman and Collins ignition magneto would not be uncommon. Reproduction spindles, brake drums, and backing based on the 1937s remain available today. Aftermarket &quot;flatty&quot; (flathead) cylinder heads were available from Barney Navarro, Vic Edelbrock, and Offenhauser. The first intake manifold Edelbrock sold was a &quot;slingshot&quot; design for the flathead V8. Front suspension hairpins were adapted from sprint cars, such as the Kurtis Krafts. The first Jimmy supercharger on a V8 may have been by Navarro in 1950.

Brookville Roadster was one of the first companies to reproduce car bodies in steel.

====&quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot;====
The picture featured on the front cover of the Beach Boys&#x27; 1963 album &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot; was supplied by &quot;Hot Rod&quot; magazine, and features the body (with his head cropped in the photo) of the car&#x27;s owner Clarence &#x27;Chili&#x27; Catallo and his own customized three-window 1932 Ford coupe.

Catallo had bought the car in 1956 for $75 in Michigan when he was 15 years old. He chopped and channelled the car to lower the top by , then replaced the stock Ford flathead V8 (as in the song) with a newer, more powerful OHV Oldsmobile Rocket V8. Much of the original customizing work, including the stacked headlights (from a later 1960 Chrysler 300H), side trim, and grille, was done by Mike and Larry Alexander in the Detroit suburb of Southfield.

After Catallo moved to Southern California, additional work, including the chopped top, was done in 1960–61 at Kustom City, George Barris&#x27; North Hollywood auto customizing shop. This led to the magazine cover and two years later, the shot was featured as the cover for The Beach Boys&#x27; fourth album. Catallo sold the coupe a few years later but, urged by his son Curt, was able to buy it back in the late 1990s for $40,000. The car had since been additionally modified but was restored by Catallo with many of the original parts, so it is again nearly identical to the famous photo. In 2000, the hot rod won the &quot;People&#x27;s Choice&quot; award at the Meadow Brook Concours d&#x27;Elegance.

===Modern hot rods===
Most newly built hot rods use fiberglass or more expensive, newly minted, steel bodies. The classic 1932 Ford lines are closely reproduced with new bodies. Because the 1932 Ford is extremely popular with hot rodders, unmodified versions are becoming rare. Although distinctly different in appearance, 1933 and &#x27;34 Fords are also popular starting points for hot rod construction, and are also available as reproductions.

==Production==

There were no specific plants for the Model B. It rolled side by side with the V-8 off the line. In 1932, Ford Motor Company had 32 plants in the US, one in Canada, seven in Europe (one for Fordson tractor production only), four in Central and South America, and one each in Turkey, Japan and Australia. Vehicles were manufactured at the Ford River Rouge Plant, then sent to the various assembly locations in &quot;knock-down kits&quot; by railroad, where they were locally assembled and sold.

Like the previous GAZ A (Ford A based), a heavily modified version of the 1934 Ford Model B 40A was also produced by GAZ in Gorky as the M1 model. Available only to high-ranking officials, the military, and various institutions, it served as the basis for the BA-20 military vehicle. In Germany a four-cylinder variation of the Model B with a somewhat more streamlined back end was produced called the Rheinland. The Ford V8 was also made by Ford in Britain in the 1930s. It was conservatively re-styled and relaunched as the post-war Ford Pilot which came with two V8 engine options.

== Model BB trucks==

As with the previous model A, there were heavier commercial vehicles. They were available with either the venerable four or the more powerful V-8. The four cylinder truck got the designation &quot;BB&quot;, following a practice started with the &quot;TT&quot; and &quot;AA&quot; trucks.

The BB had longer wheelbases of 131.5 or 157 in. (3340 or 3988 mm), a reinforced frame, heavy duty transmissions and axles, and bigger wheels. Wire wheels were standard on the light duty cars, the heavier got steel wheels (some of them dual on the rear axle). There was a separate catalogue offering popular body styles, rolling chassis or chassis and cab. Many local coachbuilders offered their coachwork to customers in need of more specific solutions. During the Depression, also ambulances, hearses, or fire trucks found their way to budget-minded communities and organizations.

Other than with the Model B automobiles, BB designated four as well as eight cylinder trucks. V-8 was strictly an option, even for heavy trucks. The bulk of these vehicles came with four cylinder engines.

These trucks are easily mistaken for B or V-8 commercial cars built on the passenger car chassis. Sedan deliveries, pickups, and station wagons were the best remembered of these. They had elongated bodies and stiffer springs, and were generally shown in the commercial car catalogue, even if the wagon was the most expensive body style available on the passenger car chassis.

<doc id="356118" wikidata="Q12339705" url="?curid=356118" title="Transatlantic Records">
<text>Transatlantic Records was a British independent record label. The company was established in 1961, primarily as an importer of American folk, blues and jazz records by many of the artists who influenced the burgeoning British folk and blues boom. Within a few years, the company had started recording British and Irish artists. The company&#x27;s philosophy was intentionally eclectic.

== History ==
The label was founded by Englishman Nat Joseph who started the company at the age of 21 after visiting the US and realizing that there was a wealth of recorded music that was unavailable in the UK. Transatlantic licensed recordings from the US, such as the jazz labels Prestige and Riverside and the Tradition folk music label. From the outset, many of the covers included photography and design by Brian Shuel. Transatlantic were also instrumental in the importation of MK Records (a Russian classical label), which were then issued with the original Russian labels, but with an English printed sleeve.

The company&#x27;s first commercial success came not from music but from three sex education albums. The controversy over these records led to sales approaching 100,000 and the resulting financial lift gave the company money to develop its musical base.

Some of their early records included artists such as The Dubliners, actress Sheila Hancock, jazz singer Annie Ross, actresses Jean Hart and Isla Cameron, and Shakespearean actor Tony Britton. They managed to mix the folk music interest with the money making capacity of the sex education records by issuing &quot;When Dalliance was in Flower&quot; – a series of bawdy songs performed by Ed McCurdy and licensed from the American Elektra label. As often happened, these were issued first on the Transatlantic label in the UK and then on the subsidiary label XTRA. The catalogue numbers often contained &quot;TRA&quot; within the prefix, thus MTRA, XTRA, and LTRA were all used. The latter prefix was used with a series of LPs produced by Bill Leader (who worked with Nat Joseph from the outset as an engineer). Amongst these &quot;Leader&quot; records were recordings by Nic Jones, Martin Simpson, Mick Ryan, Bandoggs (another Nic Jones group), Andrew Cronshaw, and Al O&#x27;Donnell. The XTRA imprint was launched as a discount label to release recordings licensed from the American Folkways label and elsewhere.

With the advent of psychedelia and flower power the Transatlantic stable of artists achieved greater success, culminating in the formation of the supergroup Pentangle. Meanwhile, Transatlantic had been extending its eclecticism, recording such as the audio collageist Ron Geesin, and The Purple Gang, whose &quot;Granny Takes A Trip&quot; was banned by the BBC in 1967. CBS had released the extremely successful contemporary music budget sampler with &quot;The Rock Machine Turns You On&quot; in 1967. Before CBS could follow up, Transatlantic released &quot;Listen Here!&quot; early in 1968. Like &quot;Rock Machine&quot; the record was priced at 14/11d (£0.75) – but Transatlantic took promotion one stage further by printing not only the track listing on the front, but also the price. The record was designed to preview not only the forthcoming Pentangle double album, but solo records by members Bert Jansch and John Renbourn. &quot;Listen Here!&quot; also served to introduce a new group The Sallyangie, with siblings Mike and Sally Oldfield.

In 1975, Joseph sold a 75% share of his company to Sidney Bernstein&#x27;s Granada Group and the company became part of Granada. There was a culture clash between the independent-spirited Transatlantic and the corporate sensibilities of Granada and two years later Granada sold its share in Transatlantic to the Marshall Cavendish publishing company, which also acquired Joseph&#x27;s 25% share. The new company was renamed Logo Records. In the 1990s, Logo Records and the Transatlantic catalogue were sold to Castle Communications (now Sanctuary Records).

<doc id="356122" wikidata="Q912304" url="?curid=356122" title="Brian Harvey">
<text>Brian Lee Harvey (born 8 August 1974) is an English singer from London. He was the lead singer of pop group East 17. The later incarnation of the band, E-17, had two top 20 singles on the UK Singles Chart between 1998 and 1999, with the album &quot;Resurrection&quot; peaking within the top 50 of the UK Albums Chart. After leaving E-17, Harvey signed a record deal with Edel Records and had two singles released in 2001, &quot;Straight Up (No Bends)&quot; and &quot;Loving You (Ole Ole Ole)&quot;.

==Career==
In 1997, Harvey was sacked from East 17 after making comments in a radio interview that appeared to condone the use of the drug ecstasy, in which he claimed to have taken 12 pills in one night, causing an uproar in the press and the matter being raised by Member of Parliament Barry Legg during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions. Harvey eventually rejoined the group under the rebranded name of E-17. Harvey&#x27;s first solo single, &quot;True Step Tonight&quot;, featuring True Steppers and Donell Jones, went to number 25 in 2000, and his follow up song, &quot;Loving You (Ole Ole Ole)&quot;, with Wyclef Jean&#x27;s The Refugee Crew, went to number 20.

In 2004, Harvey appeared in the fourth series of &quot;I&#x27;m A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!&quot;. Harvey walked out of the jungle after 6 days due to the passing of his grandmother. Harvey&#x27;s song &quot;I Can&quot; was the entry song for Making Your Mind Up in 2007. The song was written by singer Conner Reeves. Harvey was eliminated after the first round of voting and the eventual winners were Scooch. Harvey returned to East 17 in 2006, but left again in 2010. In 2019, he was making music with rapper Cryptik Soul. He was featured in the song &quot;A Ghetto Luv Story&quot; on Cryptik Soul&#x27;s album &quot;Killer&#x27;s Blood&quot;. The album was supported by the singles &quot;Come &amp; Save Me&quot; and &quot;Bang &#x27;Em Up&quot; which also featured Harvey.

==Personal life==
Born in Walthamstow, Harvey dated actress and television presenter Danniella Westbrook from 1991 to 1995. In 2024, Westbrook said she was convinced by East 17 manager Tom Watkins to break up with him. The two met again in 2015 to deliver a petition to parliament on child abuse. Harvey was married to dancer Natasha Carnegie with whom he has a daughter.

On 12 December 2001, Harvey was attacked with a knife in a club car park in Nottingham. In May 2005, after being diagnosed with clinical depression, Harvey was hospitalised after an alleged suicide attempt. On 31 May 2005, he was re-admitted to hospital in a critical condition after falling under the wheels of his own car. In an interview with GMTV, Harvey described reversing his Mercedes-Benz and suddenly feeling sick as the result of eating too many jacket potatoes, and after opening the door to vomit he accidentally stepped on the accelerator pedal instead of the brake, which resulted in him being thrown under the moving car.

<doc id="356124" wikidata="Q144022" url="?curid=356124" title="Sushen">
<text>Sushen is the historical Chinese name for an ancient ethnic group of people who lived in the northeastern part of China (in the area of modern Jilin and Heilongjiang) and what is in modern times the Russian Maritime Province and some other Siberian provinces. They were active during the Zhou dynasty period. Archeological relics in the area are attributed to the Xituanshan Culture. Chinese Bronze Age archaeologist Zou Heng of Peking University believed that the Sushen were also related to the Lower Xiajiadian culture. The Sushen are thought to have been Tungusic speakers.

According to the &quot;Guoyu&quot; and the &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot; published in the Warring States period (476–221 BCE), Sushen was the name of the tribe who lived in Shandong and border of Liaoxi Province.

The name&#x27;s characters appeared as early as the 6th century BC in Chinese documents. They are almost unknown with the exception of the fact that they lived to the north of China and used flint-headed wooden arrows, farmed, hunted, and fished, and lived in caves and trees. Ancient Chinese believed that the Sushen paid arrows as tribute to an ideal Chinese ruler. In other words, an arrival of Sushen delegates was, for the Chinese, an auspicious sign of the Chinese ruler&#x27;s virtue.

From the 3rd century to the 6th century, the name Sushen was used as an alias for the Yilou, who were in eastern Manchuria. However, the connection between the Yilou and the ancient Sushen is unclear. Some historians think that Chinese, having heard that the Yilou paid arrows as tribute, linked them with the Sushen based on knowledge of ancient documents. They paid tribute several times and pleased rulers of Northern China. The Yilou disappeared from documents in the 6th century. The Mohe rose into power there instead.

The Chinese characters of the name can also be found in Japanese documents, in which the characters are annotated and read as &quot;Mishihase&quot; or &quot;Ashihase&quot;. According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, the Mishihase first arrived to Sado Province during the reign of Emperor Kimmei. In 660, Japanese General Abe no Hirafu defeated the Mishihase in Hokkaidō in response to requests from the native inhabitants.

Some historians consider that the Mishihase were identical with the Sushen of Chinese records, and others think that Japanese named the indigenous people in the northeast based on the knowledge of Chinese documents, just as the Chinese did during the Three Kingdoms period. They are generally believed to be ethnic Nivkh people and have influenced several later peoples in the region such as the Wuji, Yilou and Mohe, and subsequently of the Jurchen, Manchu, Nanai and many other Tungusic peoples.

<doc id="356128" wikidata="Q130736" url="?curid=356128" title="Nanga Parbat">
<text>Nanga Parbat () (; ), known locally as Diamer (), is the ninth-highest mountain on Earth and its summit is at above sea level. Lying immediately southeast of the northernmost bend of the Indus River in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, Nanga Parbat is the westernmost major peak of the Himalayas, and thus in the traditional view of the Himalayas as bounded by the Indus and Yarlung Tsangpo/Brahmaputra rivers, it is the western anchor of the entire mountain range.

Nanga Parbat is one of the 14 eight-thousanders. An immense, dramatic peak rising far above its surrounding terrain, it has the second-highest prominence among the 100 tallest mountains on Earth only behind Mount Everest. Nanga Parbat is notorious for being an extremely difficult climb, and has earned the nickname &quot;Killer Mountain&quot; for its high number of climber fatalities and pushing climbers to the test of their limits. According to Guinness World Records, Nanga Parbat is the fastest growing mountain in the world, growing taller at a rate of 7 mm (0.27 in) per year.

==Etymology==
The name Nanga Parbat is derived from the Sanskrit words &quot;nagna&quot; and &quot;parvata&quot;, which, when combined, translate to &quot;Naked Mountain&quot;. The name refers to the south face, which is usually snowless. The mountain is known locally by its Tibetan name &quot;Diamer&quot; or &quot;Deo Mir&quot;, meaning &quot;huge mountain&quot;.

==Location==

Nanga Parbat forms the western anchor of the Himalayan Range and is the westernmost eight-thousander. It lies just south of the Indus River in the Diamer District of Gilgit–Baltistan in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. In some places, the river flows more than below the high-point of the massif. To the north is the western end of the Karakoram range.

==Notable features==

Nanga Parbat has tremendous vertical relief over local terrain in all directions.

To the south, Nanga Parbat has what is often referred to as the highest mountain face in the world: the Rupal Face rises above its base. To the north, the complex, somewhat more gently-sloped Rakhiot Flank rises from the Indus River valley to the summit in just , one of the ten greatest elevation gains in such a short distance on Earth.

Nanga Parbat is one of only two peaks on Earth that rank in the top twenty of both the highest mountains in the world, and the most prominent peaks in the world, ranking ninth and fourteenth respectively. The other mountain is the famous Mount Everest, which ranks first on both lists. Nanga Parbat is also the second most prominent peak of the Himalayas, after Mount Everest. The key col for Nanga Parbat is Zoji La in Kashmir Valley, which connects it to higher peaks in the remaining Himalaya-Karakoram range.

On the Tibetan Plateau, Nanga Parbat is the westernmost peak of the Himalayas, whereas Namcha Barwa marks the east end.

==Layout of the mountain==

The core of Nanga Parbat is a long ridge trending southwest-to-northeast. The ridge is composed of an enormous bulk of ice and rock. It has three faces: the Diamir, Rakhiot, and Rupal faces. The southwestern portion of this main ridge is known as the Mazeno Ridge, and has a number of subsidiary peaks. In the other direction, the main ridge arcs northeast at Rakhiot Peak (). The south/southeast side of the mountain is dominated by the Rupal Face. The north/northwest side of the mountain, leading to the Indus, is more complex. It is split into the Diamir (west) face and the Rakhiot (north) face by a long ridge. There are a number of subsidiary summits, including North Peak () some north of the main summit. Near the base of the Rupal Face is a glacial lake called Latbo, above a seasonal shepherds&#x27; village of the same name.

==Climbing history==
===Early attempts===
As a result of its accessibility, attempts to reach the summit of Nanga Parbat began very soon after it was discovered by Europeans. In 1895, Albert F. Mummery led an expedition to the peak, accompanied by Geoffrey Hastings, and reached almost 6,100 m (20,000 ft) on the Diamir (West) Face, but Mummery and two Gurkha companions later died reconnoitering the Rakhiot Face.

In the 1930s, Nanga Parbat became the focus of German interest in the Himalayas. The German mountaineers were unable to attempt Mount Everest, since only the British had access to Tibet. Initially German efforts focused on Kangchenjunga, to which Paul Bauer led two expeditions in 1930 and 1931, but with its long ridges and steep faces, Kangchenjunga was more difficult than Everest and neither expedition made much progress. K2 was known to be harder still, and its remoteness meant that even reaching its base would be a major undertaking. Nanga Parbat was therefore the highest mountain accessible to Germans and was also deemed reasonably possible by climbers at the time.

The first German expedition to Nanga Parbat was led by Willy Merkl in 1932. It is sometimes referred to as a German-American expedition, as the eight climbers included Rand Herron, an American, and Fritz Wiessner, who would become an American citizen the following year. While the team were all strong climbers, none had Himalayan experience, and poor planning (particularly an inadequate number of porters), coupled with bad weather, prevented the team from progressing far beyond the Rakhiot Peak northeast of the Nanga Parbat summit, reached by and Herbert Kunigk, but they did establish the feasibility of a route via Rakhiot Peak and the main ridge.

Merkl led another expedition in 1934, which was better prepared and financed with full support from the new Nazi government. Early in the expedition Alfred Drexel died, likely due to high altitude pulmonary edema. The Tyrolean climbers, Peter Aschenbrenner and , reached an estimated height of on July 6, but were forced to return because of worsening weather. On July 7, they and 14 others were trapped by a storm at . During the desperate retreat that followed, three famous German mountaineers, , and Merkl himself, as well as six Sherpas, died of exhaustion, exposure, and altitude sickness, and several others suffered severe frostbite. The last survivor to reach safety, Ang Tsering, did so having spent seven days battling through the storm. It has been said that the disaster, &quot;for sheer protracted agony, has no parallel in climbing annals.&quot;

In 1937, Karl Wien led another expedition to the mountain, following the same route as Merkl&#x27;s expeditions had done. Progress was made, but more slowly than before due to heavy snowfall. About 14 June, seven Germans and nine Sherpas, almost the entire team, were at Camp IV below Rakhiot Peak when it was overrun by an avalanche. All sixteen men died. The search team found that the tents had been buried by ice and snow rather than swept away. One of the victim&#x27;s diaries read &quot;our situation here is not quite safe from avalanches&quot;.

The Germans returned in 1938 led by Paul Bauer, but the expedition was plagued by bad weather, and Bauer, mindful of the previous disasters, ordered the party down before the Silver Saddle, halfway between Rakhiot Peak and Nanga Parbat summit, was reached.

=== Aufschnaiter expedition ===
Heinrich Harrer, an expert mountaineer, was a member of the SS Alpine unit. The unit practiced on the Eiger in Switzerland in 1938. When the group returned to Germany, Adolf Hitler met with them.

In May 1939, Harrer was selected by the German Himalayan Foundation to take part in a new expedition to Nanga Parbat, under the leadership of Peter Aufschnaiter. Their goal was to scout new ways to ascend the north-western face. They explored the Diamir Face with the aim of finding an easier route. They concluded that the face was a viable route, but World War II intervened and the four men were interned by the British in Dehradun, India. Harrer&#x27;s and Aufschnaiter&#x27;s escape and subsequent wanderings across the Tibetan Plateau became the subject of Harrer&#x27;s book &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;. Some evidence of this expedition is kept in the National Archives of Washington, D.C.

===First ascent===


Nanga Parbat was first climbed, via the Rakhiot Flank (East Ridge), on July 3, 1953, by Austrian climber Hermann Buhl on the German–Austrian Nanga Parbat expedition, a member of a German-Austrian team. The expedition was organized by the half-brother of Willy Merkl, Karl Herrligkoffer from Munich, while the expedition leader was Peter Aschenbrenner from Kufstein, who had participated in the 1932 and 1934 attempts. By the time of this expedition, 31 people had already died on the mountain.

The final push for the summit was dramatic: Buhl continued alone for the final , after his companions had turned back. Under the influence of the drug pervitin (based on the stimulant methamphetamine used by soldiers during World War II), padutin, and tea from coca leaves, he reached the summit dangerously late, at 7:00 p.m., the climbing harder and more time-consuming than he had anticipated. His descent was slowed when he lost a crampon. Caught by darkness, he was forced to bivouac standing upright on a narrow ledge, holding a small handhold with one hand. Exhausted, he dozed occasionally, but managed to maintain his balance. He was also very fortunate to have a calm night, so he was not subjected to wind chill. He finally reached his high camp at 7:00 p.m. the next day, 40 hours after setting out. The ascent was made without oxygen, and Buhl is the only man to have made the first ascent of an peak alone.

The 1953 documentary film &quot;Nanga Parbat 1953&quot; was filmed and directed by Hans Ertl, who participated in the expedition. Buhl&#x27;s climb was also later dramatized by Canadian film director Donald Shebib in the 1986 film &quot;The Climb&quot;.

===Subsequent attempts and ascents===
The second ascent of Nanga Parbat was via the Diamir Face, in 1962, by Germans Toni Kinshofer, Siegfried Löw, and A. Mannhardt. This route has become the &quot;standard route&quot; on the mountain. The Kinshofer route does not ascend the middle of the Diamir Face, which is threatened by avalanches from large hanging glaciers. Instead it climbs a buttress on the left side of the Diamir Face. In 1970, brothers Günther and Reinhold Messner made the third ascent of the mountain and the first ascent of the Rupal Face. They were unable to descend by their original route, and instead descended by the Diamir Face, making the first traverse of the mountain. Günther was killed in an avalanche on the Diamir Face, where his remains were found in 2005.

In 1971, Slovak mountaineers Ivan Fiala and Michal Orolin summited Nanga Parbat via Buhl&#x27;s 1953 route while other expedition members climbed the southeast peak () above the Silbersattel and the foresummit () above the Bazhin Gap. In 1976 a team of four made the sixth summit via a new route on the Rupal Face (second ascent on this face), then named the Schell route after the Austrian team leader. The line had been plotted by Karl Herrligkoffer on a previous unsuccessful attempt. In 1978, Reinhold Messner returned to the Diamir Face and achieved the first completely solo ascent of an peak.

In 1984, the French climber Lilliane Barrard became the first woman to climb Nanga Parbat, along with her husband Maurice Barrard. In 1985, Jerzy Kukuczka, Zygmunt Heinrich, Slawomir Lobodzinski (all Polish), and Carlos Carsolio (Mexico) climbed up the Southeast Pillar (or Polish Spur) on the right-hand side of the Rupal Face, reaching the summit July 13. It was Kukuczka&#x27;s ninth summit. Also in 1985, a Polish women&#x27;s team climbed the peak via the 1962 German Diamir Face route. Wanda Rutkiewicz, Krystyna Palmowska, and Anna Czerwinska reached the summit on July 15.

&quot;Modern&quot; superalpinism was brought to Nanga Parbat in 1988 with an unsuccessful attempt or two on the Rupal Face by Barry Blanchard, Mark Twight, Ward Robinson, and Kevin Doyle. 2005 saw a resurgence of lightweight, alpine-style attempts on the Rupal Face.

* In August 2005, Pakistani military helicopters rescued Slovenian mountaineer Tomaž Humar, who was stuck under a narrow ice ledge at for six days. It is believed to be one of the few successful rescues carried out at such high altitude.
* In September 2005, Vince Anderson and Steve House did an extremely lightweight, fast ascent of a new, direct route on the face, earning high praise from the climbing community.
* On July 17 or 18, 2006, José Antonio Delgado from Venezuela died a few days after reaching the summit, where he was caught by bad weather for six days and was unable to make his way down. He is the only Venezuelan climber, and one of few Latin Americans, to have reached the summit of five eight-thousanders. Part of the expedition and the rescue efforts at base camp were captured on video, as Delgado was the subject of a pilot for a mountaineering television series. Explorart Films, the production company, later developed the project into a feature documentary film called &quot;Beyond the Summit&quot;, which was scheduled to be released in South America in January 2008.
* On July 15, 2008, Italian alpinist Karl Unterkircher fell into a crevasse during an attempt to open a new route to the top with Walter Nones and Simon Kehrer. Unterkircher died, but Kehrer and Nones were rescued by the Pakistani Army.
* On July 12, 2009, after reaching the summit, South Korean climber Go Mi-Young fell off a cliff on the descent in bad weather in her race to be the first woman to climb all 14 eight-thousanders.
* On July 15, 2012, Scottish mountaineers Sandy Allan and Rick Allen made the first ascent of Nanga Parbat via the Mazeno Ridge. They reached the base camp on the Diamir flank of the mountain after an 18 day period of continuous climbing. In April 2013 were awarded the Piolet d&#x27;Or for their achievement.
* On July 10, 2024, Vadim Druelle set a record speed ascent of Nanga Parbat from base camp to summit in 15 hours and 18 minutes without the use of supplemental oxygen.

==Appearances in literature and film==
In the first chapter of &quot;Mistress of Mistresses&quot;, by E.R. Eddison, the narrator compares his then-deceased compatriot, Lessingham, to Nanga Parbat in a descriptive passage:
:&quot;I remember, years later, his describing to me the effect of the sudden view you get of Nanga Parbat from one of those Kashmir valleys; you have been riding for hours among quiet richly wooded scenery, winding up along the side of some kind of gorge, with nothing very big to look at, just lush, leafy, pussy-cat country of steep hillsides and waterfalls; then suddenly you come round a corner where the view opens up the valley, and you are almost struck senseless by the blinding splendour of that vast face of ice-hung precipices and soaring ridges, sixteen thousand feet from top to toe, filling a whole quarter of the heavens at a distance of, I suppose, only a dozen miles. And now, whenever I call to mind my first sight of Lessingham in that little daleside church so many years ago, I think of Nanga Parbat.&quot; (&quot;Mistress of Mistresses&quot;, 1935, p.2-3)

Jonathan Neale wrote a book about the 1934 climbing season on Nanga Parbat called &quot;Tigers of the Snow&quot;. He interviewed many old Sherpas, including Ang Tsering, the last man off Nanga Parbat alive in 1934. The book attempts to narrate what went wrong on the expedition, set against the mountaineering history of the early twentieth century, the background of German politics in the 1930s, and the hardship and passion of life in the Sherpa valleys.

The 1953 documentary &quot;Nanga Parbat 1953&quot; was filmed and directed by cinematographer Hans Ertl, who participated in the expedition and climbed to camp 5 (6500m). &quot;Nanga Parbat&quot; is a movie by Joseph Vilsmaier about the 1970 expedition of brothers Günther Messner and Reinhold Messner. Donald Shebib&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;The Climb&quot; covers the story of Hermann Buhl making the first ascent. A 2021 documentary records the background for the 2019 Nardi/Ballard attempt.

Jean-Jacques Annaud&#x27;s 1997 film Seven Years in Tibet opens with Heinrich Harrer&#x27;s obsession to climb Nanga Parbat at the beginning of World War II.

A song &quot;Brothers on Diamir&quot; by Austrian band Edenbridge is based on the Messner brothers&#x27; ascent of Nanga Parbat.

Nanda Parbat, a fictional city in the DC Universe, is named after the mountain.

In the 2017 TV series &quot;Dark&quot;, a German character mentions that &quot;Nanga Parbat has been conquered&quot; when explaining that the current year is 1953.

<text>The Voice of the Martyrs (VOM) is an international nonprofit organization whose mission is to defend the human rights of persecuted Christians.

==History==
The organization was founded in 1967 by Richard Wurmbrand, a Lutheran priest, and Romanian of Jewish descent who spent fourteen years in a Communist prison for his Christian faith in the Socialist Republic of Romania, which held a policy of state atheism. The US organization today is a $50 million ministry providing practical and spiritual assistance to persecuted Christians in 68 countries. In 2016, VOM-USA completed more than 1,500 ministry projects, providing help to more than 5 million people.

There are a number of Voice of the Martyrs organizations around the world. Each mission is autonomous (and not all use the &quot;Voice of the Martyrs&quot; name), but they cooperate through the International Christian Association (ICA). While each country&#x27;s mission has its own focus and management, they also cooperate through the ICA by sharing information and jointly funding international projects. Each office is funded through donations. There is no world headquarters or main office for Voice of the Martyrs, as each organization is an independent, self-supporting entity.

==Early history==
&quot;The Voice of the Martyrs&quot; was founded in 1967 under the name &quot;Jesus to the Communist World&quot; by Richard Wurmbrand, a Romanian Lutheran priest of Jewish descent, who had worked with the underground church in Romania after it was taken over in 1944 by the USSR, which held a policy of state atheism and implemented antireligious legislation. As a consequence, he was imprisoned for 14 years for preaching Christianity. His wife, Sabina, was imprisoned for three years, including being held in a labor camp and forced to work on building the Donaukanal. The Wurmbrand family was eventually freed to the West after a ransom was paid for Richard&#x27;s release.

In 1966, Wurmbrand testified before the Internal Security Subcommittee of the U.S. Senate about the treatment that Christians received under communist governments, raising worldwide interest in Christian persecution, and through his influence several missions were founded around the world to help support Christians who suffered under Communist persecution. After the fall of Communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, these missions expanded their focus to include those suffering religious persecution in Islamic, Hindu, and Buddhist societies.

== Financial accountability ==
The US office of The Voice of the Martyrs is organized as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation and reports 95% of revenue is derived from public support. In 2016, 81.8% of donated funds were used towards ministry purposes, which break into the following categories: Persecution Response, Bibles to Captive Nations, Front-Line Ministry, and Fellowship &amp; Inspiration. Of VOM-USA&#x27;s income, 12 percent was spent on administration and 6.2 percent on fundraising. The ministry is now registered as a religious order, and as such it no longer annually files form 990 with the IRS. VOM-USA is accredited by the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA), and financial information about VOM can be found on ECFA&#x27;s web site. Audited financial statements for the past three years are also available at VOM-USA&#x27;s website.

==Publications==
Each individual mission office publishes a regular newsletter for distribution in their own country. Each issue focuses on stories of the persecution of Christians, and offers testimonies as well as outlets for readers to get involved with persecuted Christians. Subscription to the 12-16 page newsletter is free.

Each mission also has other efforts to communicate the testimonies of persecuted Christians and stories of God&#x27;s faithfulness to them. VOM-USA produces a weekly radio program, which is currently heard on more than 700 radio stations across the United States and has reached the top spot on iTunes &quot;Religion and Spirituality&quot; podcast chart. Missions also produce video content, including videos to promote “The International Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church”every first Sunday in November.

==Controversy==
In 2012, VOM-USA executive director Tom White committed suicide after allegations of child abuse were made against him. Within two weeks of his death, VOM-USA mailed a letter to every name on the ministry mailing list to inform readers of his suicide and the allegations that had been made.

In 2014, Michael Wurmbrand, son of founder Richard Wurmbrand, was fired from his position at VOM-USA&#x27;s office after calling for an independent investigation into White’s overseas activities. He did so out of concern more children might have been molested, and in response to his firing he released a statement which criticized the unwillingness of the Board to do an investigation, the $28 million new headquarters, the criminal record background of a VOM-USA vice presidents, and related concerns.

In 2017, allegations were made public by dismissed employees against the leader of Voice of the Christian Martyrs - Nigeria. The allegations have been supported by former students at the school run by VOCM-Nigeria, including alleged victims. As of May 2018, Nigerian authorities have charged and released on bail the director, Isaac Oluwole Newton-Wusu, a defamation case has been filed against the accusers in court, a defamation case has been filed against the director by the accusers, and a civil suit has been filed by several of the alleged victims for threats made by the director. Prior to these allegations becoming public, VOM-USA had cut off funding to VOCM-Nigeria after the mission refused to address overcrowding in a children&#x27;s home operated by VOCM.

In 2020, Eric Foley, with Voice of the Martyrs Korea, was accused of violating the inter-Korean exchange law for launching Bible balloons from South Korea into North Korea.

Voice of the Martyrs closely guards the salaries of its leaders. In 2013, however, the salary of its then-president James Dau was revealed to be $158,416, equivalent to $183,059 in 2021. According to an audited financial statement published in 2023, Voice of the Martyrs stated that its current president and CEO, Cole Richards received $211,363 in compensation.

<doc id="356138" wikidata="Q707554" url="?curid=356138" title="Emanuel Ringelblum">
<text>Emanuel Ringelblum (November 21, 1900 – March 10 (most likely), 1944) was a Polish historian, politician and social worker, known for his &quot;Notes from the Warsaw Ghetto&quot;, &quot;Notes on the Refugees in Zbąszyn&quot; chronicling the deportation of Jews from the town of Zbąszyń, and the so-called Ringelblum Archive of the Warsaw Ghetto.

==Before the war==
He was born in Buchach, an eastern Galician town, then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now in Ukraine. Due to the strong presence of Yiddish culture in his hometown, Ringelblum developed a strong devotion to the Yiddish language, as well as his political beliefs. In 1914, Ringelblum moved to Nowy Sącz and then proceeded to move to Warsaw in 1920. Ringelblum graduated from Warsaw University, where he completed his doctoral thesis in 1927 on the history of the Jews of Warsaw during the Middle Ages. Thereafter he taught history in Jewish schools and became a member of a political movement known as the “Left Po’alei Zion”. He was known as a historian and a specialist in the field of the history of Polish Jews from the late Middle Ages to the 18th century.
Ringelblum worked for a variety of social organizations prior to the onset of World War II. Most notably, he helped Polish Jews expelled from Germany in 1938 and 1939.

==Pre-war activities==
Prior to World War II, Ringelblum took part in many organizations that helped to shape his passion for Jewish history, as well as his activity during the war. Ringelblum was a member of Po&#x27;ale Tsiyon (Workers of Zion), which sparked his devotion to both the Yiddish language and the history of Judaism and its people. When the party split in 1920, he aligned with the left half of the organization (LPZ), in which he played a large role in cultural work. In 1923, Ringelblum became one of the founding fathers of the Young Historians Circle. With help from co-founder Raphael Mahler, Ringelblum was able to gather more than 40 Jewish history students, as well as a generation of Jewish historians that worked to serve their people. The group was widely recognized for its publication of two journals and its work to defend the right to live in Poland. He proceeded to join YIVO in 1925 as a result of his firm belief in &quot;for the people by the people,&quot; and worked in the historical section of the organization. He worked as an editor for the group, and by 1939, Ringelblum had 126 scholarly articles published under his name. Ringelblum was also an active member of the Landkentenish movement, in which he stressed the need to preserve the Jewish link to Eastern Europe. In 1932, Ringelblum began working for the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC), where he learned how self-help could provide both moral and economic assistance to Jews in Poland facing discrimination as a result of pogroms. Due to his success, the organization sent him to help Polish refugees in 1938. Following his work with JDC, Ringelblum served as the leader of Aleynhilf, which later became a key relief organization in the Warsaw Ghetto by working against the Warsaw Judenrat and the Jewish police. The group provided job opportunities for the Jewish elite, and this served as the basis for Oyneg Shabes. He also founded a Yiddish culture organization entitled Yidishe Kultur Organizatsiye.

==World War II==
During the war, Ringelblum and his family were resettled to the Warsaw Ghetto. There he led a secret operation code-named Oyneg Shabbos (Yiddish for &quot;Sabbath delight&quot;). The activities of the group were kept so secretive that not even the inhabitants of the ghetto were aware of the operation. He spent his days collecting information, and wrote notes at night. Together with numerous other Jewish writers, scientists and ordinary people, Ringelblum collected diaries, documents, commissioned papers, and preserved the posters and decrees that comprised the memory of the doomed community. Among approximately 25,000 sheets preserved there are also detailed descriptions of destruction of ghettos in other parts of occupied Poland, the Treblinka extermination camp, Chełmno extermination camp and a number of reports made by scientists conducting research on the effects of famine in the ghettos. The operation used the Jewish Social Self-Help (ZSS), an organization tolerated by the Nazi Party, as a cover for its activities. The office of this social service is now the storage site of the archives.

He was also one of the most active members of &quot;Żydowska Samopomoc Społeczna&quot; (Polish for &quot;Jewish Social Aid&quot;), an organisation established to help the starving people of the Warsaw Ghetto. On the eve of the ghetto&#x27;s destruction in the spring of 1943, when all seemed lost, the archive was placed in three milk cans and metal boxes. Parts were buried in the cellars of Warsaw buildings.

Shortly before the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, Ringelblum and his family escaped from the Ghetto and found refuge on the Polish side of Warsaw. However, on 7 March 1944 their hiding place (prewar address 81 Grójecka Street) was discovered by the Gestapo after a Polish collaborator betrayed them. Soon after, Ringelblum and his family were executed, along with the Polish rescuers Mieczysław Wolski and Janusz Wysocki, in Pawiak Prison.

==Ringelblum archives==
The fate of Ringelblum&#x27;s archives is only partially known. In September 1946, ten clay-covered tin boxes were found in the ruins of Warsaw. Although they were damaged by water, the contents of the boxes were able to be salvaged by conservators. In December 1950, two additional milk cans were found in a cellar of a ruined house at 68 Nowolipki Street. The second archive was not only found in much better condition than the first, but also contained a larger variety of artifacts. Among them were copies of several underground newspapers, a narrative of deportations from the Warsaw Ghetto, and public notices by the Judenrat (the council of Jewish leaders), but also documents of ordinary life, concert invitations, milk coupons, and chocolate wrappers. The archival treasure provides insight on the daily lives, struggles, and sufferings of Polish Jews living in a pivotal area during the Holocaust.

Despite repeated searches, the rest of the archive, including the third milk can, has yet to be found. It is rumoured to be located beneath what is now the Chinese Embassy in Warsaw.

The Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw is named for him.

<doc id="356152" wikidata="Q4931333" url="?curid=356152" title="Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service">
<text>The Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service is the governing body of the United States Postal Service (USPS). The board oversees the activities of the Postal Service, while the postmaster general actively manages its day-to-day operations.

The board directs &quot;the exercise of the power&quot; of the Postal Service, controls its expenditures, and reviews its practices and policies. It consists of 11 members; 6 are requisite to achieve an ordinary quorum. Of the 11 board members, 9 are the presidentially appointed governors, 1 is the postmaster general, and 1 is the deputy postmaster general. The 9 governors elect the postmaster general, the chairman of the board as well as the USPS inspector general; the governors and the postmaster general elect the deputy postmaster general. No more than five governors may belong to the same political party. The board also has the power to remove all of these officers.

The Board of Governors is comparable with the board of directors of most private corporations.

==History==
Until 2007, each governor was appointed to a nine-year term or to the remainder of the unexpired term of a vacant seat. The terms of the nine appointed governors are staggered, commence after Senate confirmation and expire on December 8 of the year that the term would have ended had the terms been properly synchronized. The board can extend the term of a governor whose term is to expire by one year or until a successor has been confirmed, without Senate confirmation. Governors may be appointed for a second term, with Senate confirmation. No more than five of the nine governors may be of the same political party. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, signed by President George W. Bush on December 20, 2006, besides other things, changed the terms of governors appointed after that date from nine to seven years.

On November 14, 2014 (with effect on February 1, 2015), the board appointed Megan Brennan postmaster general, to succeed Patrick R. Donahoe. In December 2014, the extended term of Mickey D. Barnett was to expire, while the Senate had still not confirmed five nominees submitted by then-president Obama. Just before the loss of its quorum, the board delegated its authority to a “Temporary Emergency Committee“ (TEC) comprising the board members for the time being, with the same authority as the board had with 9 appointed members, but without the quorum requirement. After December 2014, there were three appointed board members (James Bilbray, Ellen Williams and Louis J. Giuliano) as well as the postmaster general, Patrick R. Donahoe, and the deputy PMG, Ron Stroman, a total of five of the 11 members, and not enough to constitute a quorum. Megan Brennan became an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the board on February 1, 2015. The extended terms of Ellen Williams and Louis J. Giuliano both expired in December 2015, and James Bilbray became the sole remaining appointed member. His nine-year term was extended by one year and he ceased to be a member in December 2016. At that point there were no appointed members on the board, and the PMG (Megan Brennan) and deputy PMG (Ron Stroman) made up the TEC.

In October 2017, then-president Donald Trump nominated three individuals to the board: Robert (Mike) Duncan, a former White House official during the George W. Bush administration, Calvin Tucker, and David Williams, former USPS inspector general. On August 28, 2018, the Senate confirmed Mike Duncan as chairman, and David Williams, as vice-chairman. On November 29, 2018, the governors appointed Tammy L. Whitcomb the USPS inspector general.

On August 1, 2019, the Senate confirmed three more nominations, allowing the board to reach a quorum for the first time since 2014. The new members are Ron Bloom and Roman Martinez IV, both former investment bankers, and John Barger, former director of the Investment and Retirement Boards of the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association, the country&#x27;s largest pension fund.

In March 2020, Trump nominated Donald L. Moak to replace Alan C. Kessler (who had resigned in July 2011) and nominated William D. Zollars to replace James Bilbray (who had ceased being a member in December 2016). David C. Williams resigned from the board on April 30, 2020, and Ron Stroman resigned on June 1, 2020, as deputy PMG. On June 15, 2020, the TEC, comprising five members, selected Louis DeJoy to succeed Megan Brennan as Postmaster General (PMG). The Senate confirmed both nominations on June 18, 2020. , the board had six appointed members plus the postmaster general, sufficient to constitute a quorum on the board. Five of the board members are Republicans.

There were calls in January 2021 for President Joe Biden to quickly fill the vacant seats on the USPS Board of Governors. Critics including union members note the politicization of the USPS, the mishandling of absentee ballots during the 2020 elections, and ongoing delivery delays. Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union also noted the lack of diversity on the current board: all members are men, there are no African Americans, and there is no one from a rural area. Philip F. Rubio, a history professor at North Carolina A&amp;T State University, notes that the board is accountable to no one and the postmaster general is accountable only to the Board. Rubio has described Louis DeJoy&#x27;s changes as &quot;sabotage&quot;, and Congressman Bill Pascrell, (D-NJ) said, &quot;Fire everybody at the top. They&#x27;ve done a lousy job.&quot; Dimondstein has suggested improving services by including financial services such as paycheck cashing, installing ATMs, and handling bill paying and overseas remittances.

On May 12, 2022, the United States Senate confirmed Dan Tangherlini (former head of the General Services Administration) to serve through December 2027 and Derek Kan (former deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget) through December 2028. They replace members Ron Bloom and John Barger.

==Responsibilities==
The board directs the exercise of the powers of the Postal Service, directs and controls its expenditures, reviews its practices, conducts long-range planning, and sets policies on all postal matters. The board takes up matters such as service standards, capital investments, and facilities projects exceeding $25 million. It also approves officer compensation. The board generally meets once a month. Each January, the governors elect a chairman and a vice-chairman. Each governor receives $300 per day for not more than 42 days of meetings each year and travel expenses, in addition to an annual salary of $30,000. The governors employ a full-time corporate secretary who serves as the primary staff assistant to the board.

==Membership==

Members may serve for one year beyond the expiration of their term or until a successor is confirmed. President Joe Biden nominated former general counsel of the American Postal Workers Union Anton Hajjar and voting rights activist Amber McReynolds on February 25, 2021. On March 15, 2021, the nomination of former deputy postmaster general Ron Stroman was sent to the Senate. President Biden nominated Stroman to the seat vacated by Ellen Williams.

On May 12, 2021, Stroman was confirmed to a term as governor expiring December 8, 2021 in a 69–30 vote. The Senate later confirmed a separate nomination for him to serve a term as governor expiring December 8, 2028. The U.S. Senate invoked cloture for McReynolds May 12, 2021 and confirmed her on May 13, 2021. Hajjar was confirmed on May 28, 2021.

On November 19, 2021, President Biden announced his intention to nominate Derek Kan and Dan Tangherlini to replace John M. Barger and Ron A. Bloom, respectively. Both Bloom and Barger were key allies of Louis DeJoy and had their terms expire on December 8, 2021. Bloom was replaced as chairman of the board by Roman Martinez IV on January 12, 2022. Biden&#x27;s nominees Kan and Tangherlini received Senate confirmation on May 12, 2022, and took office shortly thereafter.

President Biden had announced the nominations of Val Demings, Gordon Hartogensis, Anton Hajjar, and the reappointment of William D. Zollars. Their nominations expired at the sine die adjournment of the 118th United States Congress.

<doc id="356155" wikidata="Q2743836" url="?curid=356155" title="List of American Civil War battles">
<text>Battles of the American Civil War were fought between April 12, 1861, and May 12–13, 1865 in 19 states, mostly Confederate (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia), the District of Columbia, and six territories (Arizona Territory (also Confederate Arizona), Colorado Territory, Dakota Territory, Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma), New Mexico Territory, and Washington Territory), as well as naval engagements. Virginia in particular was the site of many major and decisive battles. These battles would change the standing and historical memory of the United States.

For lists of battles organized by campaign and theater, see:
* Eastern Theater of the American Civil War
* Western Theater of the American Civil War
* Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War
* Pacific Coast Theater of the American Civil War
* Lower Seaboard Theater of the American Civil War
* :Category:Battles of the American Civil War

Some battles have more than one name. For instance, the battles known in the North as Battle of Antietam and Second Battle of Bull Run were referred to as the Battle of Sharpsburg and the Battle of Manassas, respectively, by the South. This was because the North tended to name battles after landmarks (often rivers or bodies of water), whereas the South named battles after nearby towns.


==Battles rated by CWSAC==
The American Battlefield Protection Program (ABPP) was established within the United States National Park Service to classify the preservation status of historic battlefield land. In 1993, the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission (CWSAC) reported to Congress and the ABPP on their extensive analysis of significant battles and battlefields. Of the estimated 8,000 occasions in which hostilities occurred in the American Civil War, this table and related articles describe the 384 battles that were classified in CWSAC&#x27;s &quot;Report on the Nation&#x27;s Civil War Battlefields&quot;. In addition to the status of battlefield land preservation (not included in this table) CWSAC rated the military significance of the battles into four classes, as follows:

==Other USA/CSA battles==
Other non-Indian wars battles and skirmishes not rated by CWSAC.
==Other battles in the American Indian Wars==
Other battles and skirmishes, not rated by CWSAC, of the American Indian Wars between either USA or CSA forces and the Apache, Arapaho, Cheyenne, Comanche, Dakota, Kiowa, Navajo, and Shoshone which occurred during the American Civil War – including: the Apache Wars, Colorado War, Dakota War of 1862, Navajo Wars, and Texas–Indian wars.

<text>Your Independent Grocer (YIG), known colloquially as &quot;Independent&quot; or &quot;Yours&quot; is a supermarket chain in Canada with more than 100 locations. It has stores in every province and territory except Manitoba, Nunavut, and Quebec. It is a unit of National Grocers, itself a unit of Loblaw Companies Limited. Stores are typically operated by a franchise owner. Many of the stores were originally Ottawa-area outlets of the defunct Quebec-based Steinberg&#x27;s grocery chain. When Steinberg&#x27;s was bought out by Metro Richelieu in 1992, the Ottawa-area franchises were spun off into the separate Your Independent Grocer chain. Many SaveEasy locations in Atlantic Canada became Your Independent Grocer locations between 2014 and 2016. In May 2018, select locations began delivery through Instacart.

<doc id="356158" wikidata="Q45926" url="?curid=356158" title="Annulus (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, an annulus (: annuli or annuluses) is the region between two concentric circles. Informally, it is shaped like a ring or a hardware washer. The word &quot;annulus&quot; is borrowed from the Latin word &quot;anulus&quot; or &quot;annulus&quot; meaning &#x27;little ring&#x27;. The adjectival form is annular (as in annular eclipse).

The open annulus is topologically equivalent to both the open cylinder and the punctured plane.

== Area ==
The area of an annulus is the difference in the areas of the larger circle of radius and the smaller one of radius :
:formula_1

The area of an annulus is determined by the length of the longest line segment within the annulus, which is the chord tangent to the inner circle, in the accompanying diagram. That can be shown using the Pythagorean theorem since this line is tangent to the smaller circle and perpendicular to its radius at that point, so and are sides of a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse , and the area of the annulus is given by
:formula_2

The area can also be obtained via calculus by dividing the annulus up into an infinite number of annuli of infinitesimal width and area and then integrating from to :
:formula_3

The area of an &quot;annulus sector&quot; (the region between two circular sectors with overlapping radii) of angle , with measured in radians, is given by
:formula_4

== Complex structure ==
In complex analysis an annulus in the complex plane is an open region defined as

:formula_5

If formula_6, the region is known as the punctured disk (a disk with a point hole in the center) of radius around the point .

As a subset of the complex plane, an annulus can be considered as a Riemann surface. The complex structure of an annulus depends only on the ratio . Each annulus can be holomorphically mapped to a standard one centered at the origin and with outer radius 1 by the map
:formula_7

The inner radius is then .

The Hadamard three-circle theorem is a statement about the maximum value a holomorphic function may take inside an annulus.

The Joukowsky transform conformally maps an annulus onto an ellipse with a slit cut between foci.

<doc id="356161" wikidata="Q154356" url="?curid=356161" title="Émile Borel">
<text>Félix Édouard Justin Émile Borel (; 7 January 1871 – 3 February 1956) was a French mathematician and politician. As a mathematician, he was known for his founding work in the areas of measure theory and probability.

== Biography ==
Borel was born in Saint-Affrique, Aveyron, the son of a Protestant pastor. He studied at the Collège Sainte-Barbe and Lycée Louis-le-Grand before applying to both the École normale supérieure and the École Polytechnique. He qualified in the first position for both and chose to attend the former institution in 1889. That year he also won the concours général, an annual national mathematics competition. After graduating in 1892, he placed first in the agrégation, a competitive civil service examination leading to the position of professeur agrégé. His thesis, published in 1893, was titled &quot;Sur quelques points de la théorie des fonctions&quot; (&quot;On some points in the theory of functions&quot;). That year, Borel started a four-year stint as a lecturer at the University of Lille, during which time he published 22 research papers. He returned to the École normale supérieure in 1897, and was appointed to the chair of theory of functions, which he held until 1941.

In 1901, Borel married 17-year-old Marguerite, the daughter of colleague Paul Émile Appel; she later wrote more than 30 novels under the pseudonym Camille Marbo. Émile Borel died in Paris on 3 February 1956.

== Work ==
Along with René-Louis Baire and Henri Lebesgue, Émile Borel was among the pioneers of measure theory and its application to probability theory. The concept of a Borel set is named in his honor. One of his books on probability introduced the amusing thought experiment that entered popular culture under the name infinite monkey theorem or the like. He also published a series of papers (1921–1927) that first defined games of strategy. John von Neumann objected to this assignment of priority in a letter to &quot;Econometrica&quot; published in 1953 where he asserted that Borel could not have defined games of strategy because he rejected the minimax theorem. 

With the development of statistical hypothesis testing in the early 1900s various tests for randomness were proposed. Sometimes these were claimed to have some kind of general significance, but mostly they were just viewed as simple practical methods. In 1909, Borel formulated the notion that numbers picked randomly on the basis of their value are almost always normal, and with explicit constructions in terms of digits, it is quite straightforward to get numbers that are normal.

In 1913 and 1914 he bridged the gap between hyperbolic geometry and special relativity with expository work. For instance, his book &quot;Introduction Géométrique à quelques Théories Physiques&quot; described hyperbolic rotations as transformations that leave a hyperbola stable just as a circle around a rotational center is stable.

In 1915 he was appointed head of the technical cabinet for the newly formed Directorate of Inventions for National Defense which aimed to coordinate French laboratories for the war effort in the First World War.

In 1922, he founded the Paris Institute of Statistics, the oldest French school for statistics; then in 1928 he co-founded the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris.

== Political career ==
In the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, he was active in politics. From 1924 to 1936, he was a member of the Chamber of Deputies. In 1925, he was Minister of the Navy in the cabinet of fellow mathematician Paul Painlevé. During the Second World War, he was a member of the French Resistance.
== Honors ==

Besides the &quot;Centre Émile Borel&quot; at the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris
and a crater on the Moon, the following mathematical notions are named after him:

*Borel algebra
*Borel&#x27;s lemma
*Borel&#x27;s law of large numbers
*Borel measure
*Borel–Kolmogorov paradox
*Borel–Cantelli lemma
*Borel–Carathéodory theorem
*Heine–Borel theorem
*Borel determinacy theorem
*Borel right process
*Borel set
*Borel summation
*Borel distribution
*Borel&#x27;s conjecture about strong measure zero sets (not to be confused with Borel conjecture, named for Armand Borel).
Borel also described a poker model that he coins &quot;La Relance&quot; in his 1938 book &quot;Applications de la théorie des probabilités aux Jeux de Hasard&quot;.

Borel was awarded the Resistance Medal in 1950.

<text>The Rebellion of the Seven States or Revolt of the Seven Kingdoms () took place in 154 BC against the rule of Emperor Jing of Han dynasty by its regional semi-autonomous kings, to resist the emperor&#x27;s attempt to centralize the government further. The rebellion was crushed by the Han Imperial forces within three months, and the powers of the Imperial Court grew exponentially afterward.

==Background==
At the beginning of the Han dynasty, Liu Bang—Emperor Gaozu of Han—created princely titles for many of his relatives in certain territories that accounted for between approximately one-third to one-half of the empire. This was an attempt to consolidate Liu family rule over the parts of China that were not ruled directly from the capital under the commandery () system.

During the reign of Emperor Wen, these princes were still setting their own laws, but in addition they were minting their own coins (albeit with Emperor Wen&#x27;s approval) and collecting their own taxes. Many princes were effectively ignoring the imperial government&#x27;s authority within their own principalities. When Emperor Jing became emperor in 157 BC, the rich principality of Wu was especially domineering.

==Prelude==

Emperor Jing already had an inimical relationship with his cousin-once-removed Liu Pi, Prince of Wu, the nephew of his grandfather, Han founder Emperor Gaozu. The principality of Wu enjoyed, among other natural resources, abundant copper and salt supplies.

Around 179-175 BC, when Emperor Jing was still Crown Prince Qi, Liu Pi&#x27;s heir apparent Liu Xian () had been on an official visit to the capital Chang&#x27;an and they competed in a &quot;liubo&quot; board game. During arguments over the game, Liu Xian offended Crown Prince Qi, who beat him to death with the board. Liu Pi hated Emperor Jing for causing the death of Liu Xian.

Emperor Jing&#x27;s key advisor Chao Cuo suggested using as excuses offenses that the princes had committed which had generally been ignored by Emperor Wen, that he cut down the sizes of the principalities to make them less threatening. Chao explicitly contemplated the possibility that Wu and other principalities might rebel, but justified the action by asserting that if they were going to rebel, it would be better to let them rebel earlier than later when they might be more prepared.

Emperor Jing, in 154 BC, thus ordered the following punishments:
* He carved out the commandery of Donghai from the Principality of Chu (modern northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui), based on Liu Wu, Prince of Chu, being caught drinking during the mourning period for Empress Dowager Bo.
* He carved out the commandery of Changshan from the Principality of Zhao (modern central and southern Hebei), based on an unspecified offence.
* He carved out six counties from the principality of Jiaoxi (roughly modern Weifang, Shandong), based on Liu Ang, the Prince of Jiaoxi, embezzling funds from the sales of titles intended for paying border patrol costs.
* Carving out the commanderies of Kuaiji and Zhang from the Principality of Wu, based on various offences by Liu Pi, the Prince of Wu.

==Rebellion==
In response to these actions, Liu Pi organized a rebellion. The seven actively participating princes were:
* Liu Pi (劉濞), Prince of Wu.
* Liu Wu (劉戊), Prince of Chu.
* Liu Ang (劉卬), Prince of Jiaoxi.
* Liu Xiongqu (劉雄渠), Prince of Jiaodong.
* Liu Xian (劉賢), Prince of Zichuan.
* Liu Piguang (劉辟光), Prince of Jinan.
* Liu Sui (劉遂), Prince of Zhao.

Two other principalities—Qi (modern central Shandong) and Jibei (modern northwestern Shandong)--agreed to join but neither actually did. Liu Jianglü (劉將閭), Prince of Qi, changed his mind at the final moment and chose to resist the rebel forces, and Liu Zhi (劉志), Prince of Jibei, was put under house arrest by the commander of his guards and prevented from joining the rebellion.

Three other princes were asked to join but either refused or merely did not join:
* Liu An (劉安), Prince of Huainan (roughly modern Lu&#x27;an, Anhui)
* Liu Ci (劉賜), Prince of Lujiang (roughly modern Chaohu, Anhui)
* Liu Bo (劉勃), Prince of Hengshan (roughly part of modern Lu&#x27;an, Anhui).

The seven princes also requested help from the southern independent kingdoms of Donghai (modern Zhejiang) and Minyue (modern Fujian), and the powerful Xiongnu in the north. Donghai and Minyue sent troops to participate in the campaign, but the Xiongnu, after initially promising to do so, did not.

The seven princes claimed that Chao Cuo was aiming to wipe out the principalities and that they would be satisfied if Chao were executed.

==Rebel campaigns and strategies==
The four principalities on the periphery of Qi aimed to conquer Qi and divide it. Zhao forces headed west but stayed within the borders to wait for Wu and Chu forces, which were considered the main force in the rebellion.

Liu Pi, the Prince of Wu, had several strategies suggested to him that he considered:-
* A suggestion by Tian Lubo (田祿伯) to have two main forces—one to be led by Liu Pi himself, attacking the Principality of Liang (modern eastern Henan), and one to be led by Tian that would head west by the Yangtze River and the Han River to make a surprise attack directly on the capital Chang&#x27;an.
* A suggestion by a Gen. Huan (桓) to ignore all cities on the way and leapfrog to attack Luoyang and seize the plentiful food and weapons supply near Luoyang.
* A suggestion (probably by Liu Pi&#x27;s heir apparent Liu Ju (劉駒)) to concentrate the forces to attack Liang and destroy it first.

Liu Pi accepted the final suggestion, concerned that if he gave Tian a large force he might rebel, and that Huan&#x27;s plan was too dangerous. Wu and Chu forces therefore concentrated against Liang, against Emperor Jing&#x27;s younger brother Liu Wu, the prince of Liang, whose forces initially suffered devastating defeats, forcing Liu Wu to withdraw to his capital of Suiyang (present-day Shangqiu in Henan), which the Wu and Chu forces then proceeded to besiege.

==Emperor Jing&#x27;s responses==
In accordance with instructions left by Emperor Wen, Emperor Jing commissioned Zhou Yafu as the commander of his armed forces to face the main rebel force—the joint forces of Wu and Chu. He commissioned Li Ji (酈寄), the Marquess of Quzhou, to attack Zhao, and Gen. Luan Bu (欒布) to try to relieve the siege of Qi. Dou Ying (竇嬰) was put in command of Li and Luan&#x27;s forces, to coordinate them at his headquarters set at Xingyang.

==Main campaign==
Wu and Chu forces continued to attack Liang&#x27;s capital Suiyang fiercely. Zhou Yafu suggested to Emperor Jing that the proper strategy was not to engage Wu and Chu forces head on because, in particular, Chu forces were known for their ferocity and excellent mobility. Rather, his plan was to let Liang take the brunt of the attack, bypass Liang, and cut off the Wu and Chu supply lines to starve the rebel forces. Emperor Jing agreed, and Zhou set out from the capital Chang&#x27;an to join his main forces, already gathered at Yingyang. Wu and Chu prepared assassins on the way between Chang&#x27;an and Yingyang to assassinate Zhou, but Zhou, having been warned by the soldier Zhao She (趙涉), went by a circuitous route and avoided the assassins.

After taking command of his forces, Zhou headed toward Changyi (昌邑, in modern Jining, Shandong) to prepare to cut off the Wu and Chu supply routes. At this time Liang appeared to be in great danger, and Prince Liu Wu sent messenger after messenger to seek immediate assistance from Zhou, which Zhou ignored. Emperor Jing, concerned for his brother, ordered Zhou to head to Liang immediately to save it. Zhou refused, and instead sent a cavalry force to cut off the Wu and Chu supply lines. The strategy was effective. Wu and Chu, unable to capture Liang quickly due to the strong defence put up by the prince&#x27;s Gen. Han Anguo (韓安國) and Gen. Zhang Yu (張羽), headed northeast to attack Zhou. Zhou refused to engage in a direct battle with Wu and Chu forces, but rather concentrated on defending his camp. After being unable to get a decisive victory over Zhou, the Wu and Chu forces began to suffer from starvation and collapsed. Liu Pi fled to Donghai; Donghai killed him and sought peace with Han. Liu Wu, the prince of Chu, committed suicide.

==Other theaters==

The only other theater that Wu forces engaged in was a small one. Liu Pi&#x27;s guest Zhou Qiu (周丘) was looked down on by Liu Pi, but he, with Liu Pi&#x27;s approval, had some successes with a surprising plan he hatched. He headed to his home town Xiapi and, under the guise of being an imperial messenger, had the county magistrate killed and took over the county&#x27;s militia. He then persuaded the people of the county to join the rebellion, and they headed north and had victories over the forces of the Principality of Chengyang (modern southeastern Shandong). However, after hearing that Liu Pi had been defeated, Zhou was so taken by anxiety that he died.

Meanwhile, four principalities were besieging the Qi capital Linzi. Liu Jianglü, the Prince of Qi, considered surrendering, but his resolve to resist was strengthened when his messenger Lu (路), who had been captured by the four princes, told him from under the walls of the capital to resist (even though he was under threat from the four princes to persuade Prince Jianglü to surrender). Eventually, Luan Bu and Cao Qi (曹奇), the Marquess of Pingyang, arrived and defeated the four principalities, but at the same time also discovered that Qi had initially been part of the conspiracy. Unable to explain himself, Prince Jianglü committed suicide, but Emperor Jing, having compassion on him, permitted his son Liu Shou (劉壽) to inherit the principality.

Not so fortunate were the princes of the four rebelling principalities. The general sent to suppress them, Han Tuidang (韓頹當), the Marquess of Gonggao, wrote a letter to Liu Ang, the Prince of Jiaoxi, threatening him with utter destruction if he did not surrender. Prince Ang did so and was allowed to commit suicide. The other three princes were captured and executed. The four principalities were seized by the central government.

The final principality to be destroyed was Zhao. While Li Ji was initially unable to prevail in besieging the Zhao capital of Handan (modern Handan, Hebei), Zhao&#x27;s hopes were virtually lost when Xiongnu forces, realizing Zhao was about to be defeated, chose not to join in the battle. When Luan returned from Qi he attacked Handan with Li and was able to capture it by breaking a levee to flood the walls of Handan. Liu Sui, the Prince of Zhao, committed suicide.

Liu Zhi, the Prince of Jibei, who initially wished to join the rebellion, did not share their fate. His official Gongsun Huo (公孫獲) was able to persuade Liu Wu, the prince of Liang, that Liu Zhi had only pretended to join the rebellion and had in fact contributed to the rebellion&#x27;s defeat. With Liu Wu&#x27;s intercession, Prince Zhi was spared and he was instead given the Principality of Zaichuan.

In all, the initially ferocious rebellion lasted only three months before being defeated.

==Impact==
Emperor Gaozu had initially created imperial princes with independent military powers with an eye to having them protect the dynasty from outside. By the time of Emperor Jing, however, they were already creating problems by their refusal to follow the imperial government&#x27;s laws and orders. Had the seven princes prevailed in this conflict, in all likelihood the Han dynasty would have collapsed into a loose confederation of states. In the aftermath of the rebellion, while the principality system was maintained, the powers of the princes were gradually reduced and the sizes of the principalities reduced as well, under Emperor Jing and his son Emperor Wu. With the longevity of the Han dynasty, the Chinese mindset of it being normal to have a unified empire rather than divided states started to settle in.
