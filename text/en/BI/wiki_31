<text>David Davies (18 December 1818 – 20 July 1890) was a Welsh industrialist and Liberal politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1874 and 1886. Davies was often known as David Davies Llandinam (from the place of his birth, Llandinam in Montgomeryshire). He is best remembered today for founding Barry Docks.

==Early life and education==
Davies was the son of farmer David Davies and his wife Elizabeth and the eldest of nine children. He attended the day school at Llandinam but was primarily self-educated. He began work as a sawyer and went into agriculture, working alongside his father, who died when David was aged 20, leaving him to take charge of the family. He was successful from an early age and in 1848 took over a larger farm called Tynymaen, which later became the home farm of the Plâs Dinam estate. Two years later he took over a further holding, Gwerneirin.

==Religion==
A Calvinistic Methodist by upbringing, Davies was teetotaller and firm about his Sunday observance. He became an influential figure in Calvinistic Methodism, which had over 13,000 members in Cardiganshire alone, and funded the building of numerous chapels.

==Political career==
===Beginnings: the 1865 Cardiganshire election===
David Davies first sought election to Parliament at the 1865 General Election when he ran for the Cardiganshire county seat. Prior to the election, the sitting member, Colonel Powell of Nanteos, had indicated his intention to retire and Sir Thomas Davies Lloyd of Bronwydd, a Whig landowner, had announced his intention to stand as a Liberal. However, when Powell reversed his decision, Lloyd issued an address stating that he would not oppose the sitting member. The result was that both Davies and Henry Richard offered themselves as alternative Liberal candidates. A selection meeting was arranged to be held at Aberaeron, but shortly before this took place, Powell again announced his retirement. Lloyd now stated that he would now fight the seat after all and Richard withdrew in his favour. David Davies did not withdraw. Lloyd won the seat with a majority of 361 votes.

Davies had a number of advantages, including the fact that his railway building enterprises benefited the county and created additional, if temporary, employment opportunities. However, his defeat was attributed to the strong opposition of landowners, including the overwhelming influence of the Pryse family of Gogerddan at Aberystwyth, and the failure of nonconformists to unite behind his candidature. However, his intervention represented a direct challenge to the traditional hegemony of the county&#x27;s landed gentry over the political representation of the county. Ieuan Gwynedd Jones describes the election as &#x27;a contest between two kinds of wealth, the affluent railway contractor pitting his ready cash and ruthless commercial methods against the sedate and comfortable but strained resources of the rural gentry.&quot; This was symbolised by Davies depositing £10,000 in an Aberystwyth bank as &quot;ale money for the battle&quot;. Davies presented himself as a businessman who brought employment to the county and scarcely referred in his speeches to radical policies, including the secret ballot.

As a Calvinistic Methodist deacon, Davies had envisaged strong support from the nonconformist community. However, there were numerous examples of prominent nonconformists who were lukewarm, or even opposed, to Davies&#x27;s candidature. The reasons included a reluctance to offend landowners who held the leases to land on which some chapels had been built.

When the result was announced, Davies had polled 1,149 votes against 1,510 for Lloyd. Davies had a large majority in the Tregaron area, which was attributed to the coming of the railway and his Calvinistic Methodist connections. He was also ahead in the Lampeter district. However, he lost the other four districts, including Cardigan, where Lloyd polled 360 votes against a mere 65 for Davies.

Following his 1865 defeat in Cardiganshire, it appears that Davies initially intended to contest the seat again. After the election, he made significant contributions to chapels in the north of the county where Lloyd had won by a small margin. During the months leading up to the 1868 election became clear that Sir Thomas Lloyd did not wish to bear the costs of another contested election. A meeting of prominent Liberals at Aberaeron in late May saw an invitation issued to Davies to contest the county seat if Lloyd declined to do so (with Lloyd been offered the Cardigan Boroughs constituency where he was likely to be returned unopposed). However, Davies declined the invitation and appears to have offered Lloyd, his erstwhile opponent, a gift of £500 to contest the seat.

===Member of Parliament===
In 1874, however, Davies was elected as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Cardigan Boroughs and held the seat until 1885, when the county and borough seats were merged under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. He was then elected MP for Cardiganshire county seat in 1885. Davies was a poor public speaker, and his speech was described as untutored, but his support in Cardiganshire was nevertheless considerable owing to factors including his patronage of the new university college at Aberystwyth and his connections within the Calvinistic Methodist denomination, which had over 13,000 members in Cardiganshire. His success in 1885 was also underpinned by a particularly effective Liberal Association, organised by H. C. Fryer, an Aberystwyth solicitor, and which set up mechanisms to ensure the registration of voters. Trains were even organised to convey voters who had migrated to the South Wales coalfield back to their native county to cast their votes.

===Break with the Liberal Party and the 1886 General Election===
In 1886, however, Davies broke with Gladstone over home rule for Ireland and at the 1886 general election he stood as a Liberal Unionist candidate, having initially indicated that he would retire from politics. A number of his associates such as Robert J. Davies, Cwrtmawr followed him into the Liberal Unionist camp. The election split the Liberal Party in Cardiganshire and the election was hotly contested with almost all the landowners, including those previously regarded as having Liberal sympathies, supporting Davies. He also received the support of several prominent Liberals, especially from his own Methodist denomination. Eventually Davies was defeated by William Bowen Rowlands, the Gladstonian Liberal candidate, by a mere nine votes, a result which was largely attributed to the influence of nonconformist ministers over their congregations. Rowlands served until 1895.

Although he withdrew from political life after his defeat in 1886, Davies became a member of Montgomery County Council in 1889 and was a long-standing member and chairman of the Llandinam School Board. He was also a JP for Montgomeryshire.

== Business ==
===Early career===
His first enterprise was the building of a bridge over the Severn at Llandinam. He soon built a reputation as a contractor and was responsible for the building of numerous roads and bridges. From 1855 he was involved in the construction of the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway, which eventually opened in 1859. This line was unusual in that at neither terminus did it connect with any other railway, and the engines and carriages had to be carried on specially constructed wagons from Oswestry, 36 miles away. Together with partners such as Thomas Savin, Davies built the Vale of Clwyd Railway (opened in 1858), the Oswestry and Newtown Railway (1861), the Newtown and Machynlleth Railway (1862) and the Pembroke and Tenby Railway (1863, which was extended to Whitland in 1866). His greatest achievement was the section of the Manchester and Milford Railway from Pencader to Aberystwyth, which opened in 1867. This included the very difficult crossing of Tregaron Bog in the construction of the line between Lampeter and Aberystwyth in 1866. It is reputed that he bought up the entire year&#x27;s production of sheep fleeces in Ceredigion to lay as a foundation for the railway line on the bog. He later became a director of the Brecon and Merthyr Junction Railway.

===Industrialist===
As a result of his success in the railway trade, Davies became a colliery owner. He was an important figure in the industrialisation of the Rhondda Valley, having founded the Parc and Maendy collieries in the 1860s. The Ocean Merthyr company was formed under his chairmanship in 1867 and a number of new collieries were sunk including Dare (1868), Western and Eastern (1872), Garw (1884), and Lady Windsor (1885).

By the 1880s the output from his collieries had increased to such an extent that Davies established a limited liability company, the Ocean Coal Company Ltd. At the same time a combination of the inability of the Taff Vale railway and the Bute docks at Cardiff to cope with the Ocean traffic, and the fact that Davies had to pay such high costs to use these facilities, led him Davies to construct new docks at Barry with a railway connection from the Rhondda. The project came to fruition after a lengthy parliamentary process and was completed in 1889. Described by Kenneth Morgan as &quot;the crowning triumph&quot; of David Davies, Barry Docks was successful from the outset. The docks were crucial in the expansion of the South Wales coal trade on a global scale. &quot;The Barry&quot;, as the port facility was nicknamed, quickly became Great Britain&#x27;s most prolific exporter of coal.

Although Davies died the year following the inauguration of the Barry Docks and rail, the facilities had by that time already assisted Ocean Coal to become the most profitable and the largest of South Wales&#x27; coal companies.

==Personal life and family==

During his lifetime, he was also known by the nicknames, &quot;Top Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Davies the Ocean&quot;. His father was a and lived on the south side of the Severn valley in Llandinam so that in winter the house was shaded from the sun because of the enclosing hills. Once he had started to amass his fortune, he built Broneirion, a grand country mansion on the north side of the river that would enjoy sunshine all year round, which has been maintained and operated as a training facility and accommodation by owners Girlguiding Cymru since the 1940s. In 2022, Girlguiding Cymru announced they would be putting the property up for sale.

Davies married Margaret Jones, daughter of Edward Jones of Llanfair in 1851. They had one child, Edward Davies (1852–1898). His grandson, another David Davies, continued Llandinam&#x27;s philanthropic activities and was elevated to the peerage. Llandinam&#x27;s two granddaughters, Gwendoline Davies and Margaret Davies, donated their substantial art collection to the National Museum of Wales.

Davies was a keen patron and one of the first governors of the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth and in 1875 was elected treasurer, a post which he held till 1887.

In 1884 he bought the large country house, Plas Dinam, where he died on 20 July 1890, aged 71.

<doc id="344116" wikidata="Q601796" url="?curid=344116" title="Korteweg–De Vries equation">
<text>In mathematics, the Korteweg–De Vries (KdV) equation is a partial differential equation (PDE) which serves as a mathematical model of waves on shallow water surfaces. It is particularly notable as the prototypical example of an integrable PDE, exhibiting typical behaviors such as a large number of explicit solutions, in particular soliton solutions, and an infinite number of conserved quantities, despite the nonlinearity which typically renders PDEs intractable. The KdV can be solved by the inverse scattering method (ISM). In fact, Clifford Gardner, John M. Greene, Martin Kruskal and Robert Miura developed the classical inverse scattering method to solve the KdV equation.

The KdV equation was first introduced by and rediscovered by Diederik Korteweg and Gustav de Vries in 1895, who found the simplest solution, the one-soliton solution. Understanding of the equation and behavior of solutions was greatly advanced by the computer simulations of Norman Zabusky and Kruskal in 1965 and then the development of the inverse scattering transform in 1967.

In 1972, T. Kawahara proposed a fifth-order KdV type of equation, known as Kawahara equation, that describes dispersive waves, particularly in cases when the coefficient of the KdV equation becomes very small or zero.

==Definition==

The KdV equation is a partial differential equation that models (spatially) one-dimensional nonlinear dispersive nondissipative waves described by a function formula_1 adhering to:

:formula_2

where formula_3 accounts for dispersion and the nonlinear element formula_4 is an advection term.

For modelling shallow water waves, formula_5 is the height displacement of the water surface from its equilibrium height.

The constant formula_6 in front of the last term is conventional but of no great significance: multiplying formula_7, formula_8, and formula_5 by constants can be used to make the coefficients of any of the three terms equal to any given non-zero constants.

==Soliton solutions==

===One-soliton solution===
Consider solutions in which a fixed waveform, given by formula_10, maintains its shape as it travels to the right at phase speed formula_11. Such a solution is given by formula_12. Substituting it into the KdV equation gives the ordinary differential equation

:formula_13

or, integrating with respect to formula_14,

:formula_15

where formula_16 is a constant of integration. Interpreting the independent variable formula_14 above as a virtual time variable, this means 
formula_18 satisfies Newton&#x27;s equation of motion of a particle of unit mass in a cubic potential
:formula_19.
If
:formula_20
then the potential function formula_21 has local maximum at formula_22; there is a solution in which formula_10 starts at this point at &#x27;virtual time&#x27; 
formula_24, eventually slides down to the local minimum, then back up the other side, reaching an equal height, and then reverses direction, ending up at the local maximum again at time formula_25. In other words, formula_10 approaches formula_27 as formula_28. This is the characteristic shape of the &quot;solitary wave&quot; solution.

More precisely, the solution is

:formula_29

where formula_30 stands for the hyperbolic secant and formula_31 is an arbitrary constant. This describes a right-moving soliton with velocity formula_11.

=== &quot;N&quot;-soliton solution ===
There is a known expression for a solution which is an formula_33-soliton solution, which at late times resolves into formula_33 separate single solitons. The solution depends on a set of decreasing positive parameters formula_35 and a set of non-zero parameters formula_36. The solution is given in the form
formula_37
where the components of the matrix formula_38 are 
formula_39

This is derived using the inverse scattering method.

==Integrals of motion==

The KdV equation has infinitely many integrals of motion, functionals on a solution formula_40 which do not change with time. They can be given explicitly as

:formula_41

where the polynomials formula_42 are defined recursively by
:formula_43
The first few integrals of motion are:
* the mass formula_44
* the momentum formula_45
* the energy formula_46.
Only the odd-numbered terms formula_47 result in non-trivial (meaning non-zero) integrals of motion.

==Lax pairs==

The KdV equation
:formula_48
can be reformulated as the Lax equation
:formula_49
with formula_50 a Sturm–Liouville operator:
:formula_51
where formula_52 is the commutator such that formula_53. The Lax pair accounts for the infinite number of first integrals of the KdV equation.

In fact, formula_50 is the time-independent Schrödinger operator (disregarding constants) with potential formula_1. It can be shown that due to this Lax formulation that in fact the eigenvalues do not depend on formula_7.

===Zero-curvature representation===
Setting the components of the Lax connection to be
formula_57
the KdV equation is equivalent to the zero-curvature equation for the Lax connection,
formula_58

==Least action principle==

The Korteweg–De Vries equation
:formula_59
is the Euler–Lagrange equation of motion derived from the Lagrangian density, formula_60

with formula_5 defined by

:formula_62
Since the Lagrangian (eq (1)) contains second derivatives, the Euler–Lagrange equation of motion for this field is

{\partial ( \partial_{\mu\mu} \psi )} \right) - \partial_\mu \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial ( \partial_\mu \psi )} \right) + \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \psi} = 0 . &lt;/math&gt;|}}

where formula_63 is a derivative with respect to the formula_64 component.

A sum over formula_64 is implied so eq (2) really reads,

{\partial ( \partial_{tt} \psi )} \right) + \partial_{xx} \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial ( \partial_{xx} \psi )} \right) - \partial_t \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial ( \partial_t \psi )} \right) - \partial_x \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial ( \partial_x \psi )} \right) + \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \psi} = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Evaluate the five terms of eq (3) by plugging in eq (1),

:formula_66
:formula_67
:formula_68
:formula_69
:formula_70

Remember the definition formula_71, so use that to simplify the above terms,

:formula_72
:formula_73
:formula_74

Finally, plug these three non-zero terms back into eq (3) to see
:formula_75
which is exactly the KdV equation

:formula_76
==Long-time asymptotics==

It can be shown that any sufficiently fast decaying smooth solution will eventually split into a finite superposition of solitons travelling to the right plus a decaying dispersive part travelling to the left. This was first observed by and can be rigorously proven using the nonlinear steepest descent analysis for oscillatory Riemann–Hilbert problems.

==History==

The history of the KdV equation started with experiments by John Scott Russell in 1834, followed by theoretical investigations by Lord Rayleigh and Joseph Boussinesq around 1870 and, finally, Korteweg and De Vries in 1895.

The KdV equation was not studied much after this until discovered numerically that its solutions seemed to decompose at large times into a collection of &quot;solitons&quot;: well separated solitary waves. Moreover, the solitons seems to be almost unaffected in shape by passing through each other (though this could cause a change in their position). They also made the connection to earlier numerical experiments by Fermi, Pasta, Ulam, and Tsingou by showing that the KdV equation was the continuum limit of the FPUT system. Development of the analytic solution by means of the inverse scattering transform was done in 1967 by Gardner, Greene, Kruskal and Miura.

The KdV equation is now seen to be closely connected to Huygens&#x27; principle.

==Applications and connections==

The KdV equation has several connections to physical problems. In addition to being the governing equation of the string in the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem in the continuum limit, it approximately describes the evolution of long, one-dimensional waves in many physical settings, including:
* shallow-water waves with weakly non-linear restoring forces,
* long internal waves in a density-stratified ocean,
* ion acoustic waves in a plasma,
* acoustic waves on a crystal lattice.

The KdV equation can also be solved using the inverse scattering transform such as those applied to the non-linear Schrödinger equation.

===KdV equation and the Gross–Pitaevskii equation ===
Considering the simplified solutions of the form
:formula_77
we obtain the KdV equation as
:formula_78
or
:formula_79
Integrating and taking the special case in which the integration constant is zero, we have:
:formula_80
which is the formula_81 special case of the generalized stationary Gross–Pitaevskii equation (GPE)
:formula_82
Therefore, for the certain class of solutions of generalized GPE (formula_83 for the true one-dimensional condensate and
formula_84 while using the three dimensional equation in one dimension), two equations are one. Furthermore, taking the formula_85 case with the minus sign and the formula_5 real, one obtains an attractive self-interaction that should yield a bright soliton.

<doc id="344123" wikidata="Q1796959" url="?curid=344123" title="Heat sink">
<text>A heat sink (also commonly spelled heatsink,) is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant, where it is dissipated away from the device, thereby allowing regulation of the device&#x27;s temperature. In computers, heat sinks are used to cool CPUs, GPUs, and some chipsets and RAM modules. Heat sinks are used with other high-power semiconductor devices such as power transistors and optoelectronics such as lasers and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), where the heat dissipation ability of the component itself is insufficient to moderate its temperature.

A heat sink is designed to maximize its surface area in contact with the cooling medium surrounding it, such as the air. Air velocity, choice of material, protrusion design and surface treatment are factors that affect the performance of a heat sink. Heat sink attachment methods and thermal interface materials also affect the die temperature of the integrated circuit. Thermal adhesive or thermal paste improve the heat sink&#x27;s performance by filling air gaps between the heat sink and the heat spreader on the device. A heat sink is usually made out of a material with a high thermal conductivity, such as aluminium or copper.

==Heat transfer principle==

A heat sink transfers thermal energy from a higher-temperature device to a lower-temperature fluid medium. The fluid medium is frequently air, but can also be water, refrigerants, or even oil. If the fluid medium is water, the heat sink is frequently called a cold plate. In thermodynamics a heat sink is a heat reservoir that can absorb an arbitrary amount of heat without significantly changing temperature. Practical heat sinks for electronic devices must have a temperature higher than the surroundings to transfer heat by convection, radiation, and conduction. The power supplies of electronics are not absolutely efficient, so extra heat is produced that may be detrimental to the function of the device. As such, a heat sink is included in the design to disperse heat.

Fourier&#x27;s law of heat conduction shows that when there is a temperature gradient in a body, heat will be transferred from the higher-temperature region to the lower-temperature region. The rate at which heat is transferred by conduction, formula_1, is proportional to the product of the temperature gradient and the cross-sectional area through which heat is transferred. When it is simplified to a one-dimensional form in the &quot;x&quot; direction, it can be expressed as:
: formula_2

For a heat sink in a duct, where air flows through the duct, the heat-sink base will usually be hotter than the air flowing through the duct. Applying the conservation of energy, for steady-state conditions, and Newton&#x27;s law of cooling to the temperature nodes shown in the diagram gives the following set of equations:
: formula_3
: formula_4

where
: formula_5
: formula_6 is the air mass flow rate in kg/s
: formula_7 is the specific heat capacity of the incoming air, in J/(kg °C)
: formula_8 is the thermal resistance of the heatsink

Using the mean air temperature is an assumption that is valid for relatively short heat sinks. When compact heat exchangers are calculated, the logarithmic mean air temperature is used.

The above equations show that:
* When the air flow through the heat sink decreases, this results in an increase in the average air temperature. This in turn increases the heat-sink base temperature. And additionally, the thermal resistance of the heat sink will also increase. The net result is a higher heat-sink base temperature.
** The increase in heat-sink thermal resistance with decrease in flow rate will be shown later in this article.
* The inlet air temperature relates strongly with the heat-sink base temperature. For example, if there is recirculation of air in a product, the inlet air temperature is not the ambient air temperature. The inlet air temperature of the heat sink is therefore higher, which also results in a higher heat-sink base temperature.
* If there is no air flow around the heat sink, energy cannot be transferred.
* A heat sink is not a device with the &quot;magical ability to absorb heat like a sponge and send it off to a parallel universe&quot;.

Natural convection requires free flow of air over the heat sink. If fins are not aligned vertically, or if fins are too close together to allow sufficient air flow between them, the efficiency of the heat sink will decline.

==Design factors==
===Thermal resistance===
For semiconductor devices used in a variety of consumer and industrial electronics, the idea of &quot;thermal resistance&quot; simplifies the selection of heat sinks. The heat flow between the semiconductor die and ambient air is modeled as a series of resistances to heat flow; there is a resistance from the die to the device case, from the case to the heat sink, and from the heat sink to the ambient air. The sum of these resistances is the total thermal resistance from the die to the ambient air. Thermal resistance is defined as temperature rise per unit of power, analogous to electrical resistance, and is expressed in units of degrees Celsius per watt (°C/W). If the device dissipation in watts is known, and the total thermal resistance is calculated, the temperature rise of the die over the ambient air can be calculated.

The idea of thermal resistance of a semiconductor heat sink is an approximation. It does not take into account non-uniform distribution of heat over a device or heat sink. It only models a system in thermal equilibrium and does not take into account the change in temperatures with time. Nor does it reflect the non-linearity of radiation and convection with respect to temperature rise. However, manufacturers tabulate typical values of thermal resistance for heat sinks and semiconductor devices, which allows selection of commercially manufactured heat sinks to be simplified.

Commercial extruded aluminium heat sinks have a thermal resistance (heat sink to ambient air) ranging from for a large sink meant for TO-3 devices, up to as high as for a clip-on heat sink for a TO-92 small plastic case. The popular 2N3055 power transistor in a TO-3 case has an internal thermal resistance from junction to case of . The contact between the device case and heat sink may have a thermal resistance between , depending on the case size and use of grease or insulating mica washer.

===Material===
The materials for heat sink applications should have high heat capacity and thermal conductivity in order to absorb more heat energy without shifting towards a very high temperature and transmit it to the environment for efficient cooling. The most common heat sink materials are aluminium alloys. Aluminium alloy 1050 has one of the higher thermal conductivity values at 229 W/(m·K) and heat capacity of 922 J/(kg·K), but is mechanically soft. Aluminium alloys 6060 (low-stress), 6061, and 6063 are commonly used, with thermal conductivity values of 166 and 201 W/(m·K) respectively. The values depend on the temper of the alloy. One-piece aluminium heat sinks can be made by extrusion, casting, skiving or milling.

Copper has excellent heat-sink properties in terms of its thermal conductivity, corrosion resistance, biofouling resistance, and antimicrobial resistance (see also Copper in heat exchangers). Copper has around twice the thermal conductivity of aluminium, around 400 W/(m·K) for pure copper. Its main applications are in industrial facilities, power plants, solar thermal water systems, HVAC systems, gas water heaters, forced air heating and cooling systems, geothermal heating and cooling, and electronic systems.

Copper is three times as dense and more expensive than aluminium, and copper is less ductile than aluminum. One-piece copper heat sinks can be made by skiving or milling. Sheet-metal fins can be soldered onto a rectangular copper body.

====Fin efficiency====
Fin efficiency is one of the parameters that makes a higher-thermal-conductivity material important. A fin of a heat sink may be considered to be a flat plate with heat flowing in one end and being dissipated into the surrounding fluid as it travels to the other. As heat flows through the fin, the combination of the thermal resistance of the heat sink impeding the flow and the heat lost due to convection, the temperature of the fin and, therefore, the heat transfer to the fluid, will decrease from the base to the end of the fin. Fin efficiency is defined as the actual heat transferred by the fin, divided by the heat transfer were the fin to be isothermal (hypothetically the fin having infinite thermal conductivity). These equations are applicable for straight fins:
: formula_9
: formula_10

where
: &quot;h&quot;f is the convection coefficient of the fin:
:: 10 to 100 W/(m2·K) in air,
:: 500 to 10,000 W/(m2·K) in water,
: &quot;k&quot; is the thermal conductivity of the fin material:
:: 120 to 240 W/(m·K) for aluminium,
: &quot;L&quot;f is the fin height (m),
: &quot;t&quot;f is the fin thickness (m).

Fin efficiency is increased by decreasing the fin aspect ratio (making them thicker or shorter), or by using a more conductive material (copper instead of aluminium, for example).

====Spreading resistance====

Another parameter that concerns the thermal conductivity of the heat-sink material is spreading resistance. Spreading resistance occurs when thermal energy is transferred from a small area to a larger area in a substance with finite thermal conductivity. In a heat sink, this means that heat does not distribute uniformly through the heat-sink base. The spreading resistance phenomenon is shown by how the heat travels from the heat source location and causes a large temperature gradient between the heat source and the edges of the heat sink. This means that some fins are at a lower temperature than if the heat source were uniform across the base of the heat sink. This nonuniformity increases the heat sink&#x27;s effective thermal resistance.

To decrease the spreading resistance in the base of a heat sink:
* increase the base thickness,
* choose a different material with higher thermal conductivity,
* use a vapor chamber or heat pipe in the heat sink base.

===Fin arrangements===

A pin fin heat sink is a heat sink that has pins that extend from its base. The pins can be cylindrical, elliptical, or square. A second type of heat sink fin arrangement is the straight fin. A variation on the straight fin heat sink is a cross-cut heat sink. A third type of heat sink is the flared fin heat sink, where the fins are not parallel to one another. Flaring the fins decreases flow resistance and makes more air go through the heat-sink fin channel; otherwise, more air would bypass the fins. Slanting them keeps the overall dimensions the same, but offers longer fins. Examples of the three types are shown in the image on the right.

Forghan, et al. have published data on tests conducted on pin fin, straight fin, and flared fin heat sinks. They found that for low air approach velocity, typically around 1 m/s, the thermal performance is at least 20% better than straight fin heat sinks. Lasance and Eggink also found that for the bypass configurations that they tested, the flared heat sink performed better than the other heat sinks tested.
Generally, the more surface area a heat sink has, the better its performance. Real-world performance depends on the design and application. The concept of a pin fin heat sink is to pack as much surface area into a given volume as possible, while working in any orientation of fluid flow. Kordyban has compared the performance of a pin-fin and a straight-fin heat sink of similar dimensions. Although the pin-fin has 194 cm2 surface area while the straight-fin has 58 cm2, the temperature difference between the heat-sink base and the ambient air for the pin fin is , but for the straight-fin it was 44 °C, or 6 °C better than the pin fin. Pin fin heat sink performance is significantly better than straight fins when used in their optimal application where the fluid flows axially along the pins rather than only tangentially across the pins.

===Cavities (inverted fins)===
Cavities (inverted fins) embedded in a heat source are the regions formed between adjacent fins that stand for the essential promoters of nucleate boiling or condensation. These cavities are usually utilized to extract heat from a variety of heat-generating bodies to a heat sink.

===Conductive thick plate between the heat source and the heat sink===
Placing a conductive thick plate as a heat-transfer interface between a heat source and a cold flowing fluid (or any other heat sink) may improve the cooling performance. In such arrangement, the heat source is cooled under the thick plate instead of being cooled in direct contact with the cooling fluid. It is shown that the thick plate can significantly improve the heat transfer between the heat source and the cooling fluid by conducting the heat current in an optimal manner. The two most attractive advantages of this method are that no additional pumping power and no extra heat-transfer surface area, that is quite different from fins (extended surfaces).

===Surface color===

The heat transfer from the heat sink occurs by convection of the surrounding air, conduction through the air, and radiation.

Heat transfer by radiation is a function of both the heat-sink temperature and the temperature of the surroundings that the heat sink is optically coupled with. When both of these temperatures are on the order of 0 °C to 100 °C, the contribution of radiation compared to convection is generally small, and this factor is often neglected. In this case, finned heat sinks operating in either natural-convection or forced-flow will not be affected significantly by surface emissivity.

In situations where convection is low, such as a flat non-finned panel with low airflow, radiative cooling can be a significant factor. Here the surface properties may be an important design factor. Matte-black surfaces radiate much more efficiently than shiny bare metal. A shiny metal surface has low emissivity. The emissivity of a material is tremendously frequency-dependent and is related to absorptivity (of which shiny metal surfaces have very little). For most materials, the emissivity in the visible spectrum is similar to the emissivity in the infrared spectrum; however, there are exceptions 
 notably, certain metal oxides that are used as &quot;selective surfaces&quot;.

In vacuum or outer space, there is no convective heat transfer, thus in these environments, radiation is the only factor governing heat flow between the heat sink and the environment. For a satellite in space, a surface facing the Sun will absorb a lot of radiant heat, because the Sun&#x27;s surface temperature is nearly 6000 K, whereas the same surface facing deep space will radiate a lot of heat, since deep space has an effective temperature of only several Kelvin.

==Engineering applications==

===Microprocessor cooling===
Heat dissipation is an unavoidable by-product of electronic devices and circuits. In general, the temperature of the device or component will depend on the thermal resistance from the component to the environment, and the heat dissipated by the component. To ensure that the component does not overheat, a thermal engineer seeks to find an efficient heat transfer path from the device to the environment. The heat transfer path may be from the component to a printed circuit board (PCB), to a heat sink, to air flow provided by a fan, but in all instances, eventually to the environment.

Two additional design factors also influence the thermal/mechanical performance of the thermal design:
# The method by which the heat sink is mounted on a component or processor. This will be discussed under the section &quot;attachment methods&quot;.
# For each interface between two objects in contact with each other, there will be a temperature drop across the interface. For such composite systems, the temperature drop across the interface may be appreciable. This temperature change may be attributed to what is known as the thermal contact resistance. &quot;Thermal interface materials&quot; (TIM) decrease the thermal contact resistance.

====Attachment methods====
As power dissipation of components increases and component package size decreases, thermal engineers must innovate to ensure components won&#x27;t overheat. Devices that run cooler last longer. A heat sink design must fulfill both its thermal as well as its mechanical requirements. Concerning the latter, the component must remain in thermal contact with its heat sink with reasonable shock and vibration. The heat sink could be the copper foil of a circuit board, or a separate heat sink mounted onto the component or circuit board. Attachment methods include thermally conductive tape or epoxy, wire-form z clips, flat spring clips, standoff spacers, and push pins with ends that expand after installing.

; Thermally conductive tape
Thermally conductive tape is one of the most cost-effective heat sink attachment materials. It is suitable for low-mass heat sinks and for components with low power dissipation. It consists of a thermally conductive carrier material with a pressure-sensitive adhesive on each side.

This tape is applied to the base of the heat sink, which is then attached to the component. Following are factors that influence the performance of thermal tape:
# Surfaces of both the component and heat sink must be clean, with no residue such as a film of silicone grease.
# Preload pressure is essential to ensure good contact. Insufficient pressure results in areas of non-contact with trapped air, and results in higher-than-expected interface thermal resistance.
# Thicker tapes tend to provide better &quot;wettability&quot; with uneven component surfaces. &quot;Wettability&quot; is the percentage area of contact of a tape on a component. Thicker tapes, however, have a higher thermal resistance than thinner tapes. From a design standpoint, it is best to strike a balance by selecting a tape thickness that provides maximum &quot;wettability&quot; with minimum thermal resistance.

; Epoxy
Epoxy is more expensive than tape, but provides a greater mechanical bond between the heat sink and component, as well as improved thermal conductivity. The epoxy chosen must be formulated for this purpose. Most epoxies are two-part liquid formulations that must be thoroughly mixed before being applied to the heat sink, and before the heat sink is placed on the component. The epoxy is then cured for a specified time, which can vary from 2 hours to 48 hours. Faster cure time can be achieved at higher temperatures. The surfaces to which the epoxy is applied must be clean and free of any residue.

The epoxy bond between the heat sink and component is semi-permanent/permanent. This makes re-work very difficult and at times impossible. The most typical damage caused by rework is the separation of the component die heat spreader from its package.
; Wire form Z-clips
More expensive than tape and epoxy, wire form z-clips attach heat sinks mechanically. To use the z-clips, the printed circuit board must have anchors. Anchors can be either soldered onto the board, or pushed through. Either type requires holes to be designed into the board. The use of RoHS solder must be allowed for because such solder is mechanically weaker than traditional Pb/Sn solder.

To assemble with a z-clip, attach one side of it to one of the anchors. Deflect the spring until the other side of the clip can be placed in the other anchor. The deflection develops a spring load on the component, which maintains very good contact. In addition to the mechanical attachment that the z-clip provides, it also permits using higher-performance thermal interface materials, such as phase change types.
; Clips
Available for processors and ball grid array (BGA) components, clips allow the attachment of a BGA heat sink directly to the component. The clips make use of the gap created by the ball grid array (BGA) between the component underside and PCB top surface. The clips therefore require no holes in the PCB. They also allow for easy rework of components.
; Push pins with compression springs
For larger heat sinks and higher preloads, push pins with compression springs are very effective. The push pins, typically made of brass or plastic, have a flexible barb at the end that engages with a hole in the PCB; once installed, the barb retains the pin. The compression spring holds the assembly together and maintains contact between the heat sink and component. Care is needed in selection of push pin size. Too great an insertion force can result in the die cracking and consequent component failure.

; Threaded standoffs with compression springs
For very large heat sinks, there is no substitute for the threaded standoff and compression spring attachment method. A threaded standoff is essentially a hollow metal tube with internal threads. One end is secured with a screw through a hole in the PCB. The other end accepts a screw which compresses the spring, completing the assembly. A typical heat sink assembly uses two to four standoffs, which tends to make this the most costly heat sink attachment design. Another disadvantage is the need for holes in the PCB.

====Thermal interface materials====

Thermal contact resistance occurs due to the voids created by surface roughness effects, defects and misalignment of the interface. The voids present in the interface are filled with air. Heat transfer is therefore due to conduction across the actual contact area and to conduction (or natural convection) and radiation across the gaps. If the contact area is small, as it is for rough surfaces, the major contribution to the resistance is made by the gaps. To decrease the thermal contact resistance, the surface roughness can be decreased while the interface pressure is increased. However, these improving methods are not always practical or possible for electronic equipment. Thermal interface materials (TIM) are a common way to overcome these limitations.

Properly applied thermal interface materials displace the air that is present in the gaps between the two objects with a material that has a much-higher thermal conductivity. Air has a thermal conductivity of 0.022 W/(m·K) while TIMs have conductivities of 0.3 W/(m·K) and higher.

When selecting a TIM, care must be taken with the values supplied by the manufacturer. Most manufacturers give a value for the thermal conductivity of a material. However, the thermal conductivity does not take into account the interface resistances. Therefore, if a TIM has a high thermal conductivity, it does not necessarily mean that the interface resistance will be low.

Selection of a TIM is based on three parameters: the interface gap which the TIM must fill, the contact pressure, and the electrical resistivity of the TIM. The contact pressure is the pressure applied to the interface between the two materials. The selection does not include the cost of the material. Electrical resistivity may be important depending upon electrical design details.



===Light-emitting diode lamps===
Light-emitting diode (LED) performance and lifetime are strong functions of their temperature. Effective cooling is therefore essential. A case study of a LED based downlighter shows an example of the calculations done in order to calculate the required heat sink necessary for the effective cooling of lighting system. The article also shows that in order to get confidence in the results, multiple independent solutions are required that give similar results. Specifically, results of the experimental, numerical and theoretical methods should all be within 10% of each other to give high confidence in the results.

===In soldering===
Temporary heat sinks are sometimes used while soldering circuit boards, preventing excessive heat from damaging sensitive nearby electronics. In the simplest case, this means partially gripping a component using a heavy metal crocodile clip, hemostat, or similar clamp. Modern semiconductor devices, which are designed to be assembled by reflow soldering, can usually tolerate soldering temperatures without damage. On the other hand, electrical components such as magnetic reed switches can malfunction if exposed to hotter soldering irons, so this practice is still very much in use.

==Methods to determine performance==
In general, a heat sink performance is a function of material thermal conductivity, dimensions, fin type, heat transfer coefficient, air flow rate, and duct size. To determine the thermal performance of a heat sink, a theoretical model can be made. Alternatively, the thermal performance can be measured experimentally. Due to the complex nature of the highly 3D flow in present applications, numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can also be used. This section will discuss the aforementioned methods for the determination of the heat sink thermal performance.

===A heat transfer theoretical model===

One of the methods to determine the performance of a heat sink is to use heat transfer and fluid dynamics theory. One such method has been published by Jeggels, et al., though this work is limited to ducted flow. Ducted flow is where the air is forced to flow through a channel which fits tightly over the heat sink. This makes sure that all the air goes through the channels formed by the fins of the heat sink. When the air flow is not ducted, a certain percentage of air flow will bypass the heat sink. Flow bypass was found to increase with increasing fin density and clearance, while remaining relatively insensitive to inlet duct velocity.

The heat sink thermal resistance model consists of two resistances, namely the resistance in the heat sink base, formula_11, and the resistance in the fins, formula_12. The heat sink base thermal resistance, formula_11, can be written as follows if the source is a uniformly applied the heat sink base. If it is not, then the base resistance is primarily spreading resistance:
:formula_14 (4)

where formula_15 is the heat sink base thickness, formula_16 is the heat sink material thermal conductivity and formula_17 is the area of the heat sink base.

The thermal resistance from the base of the fins to the air, formula_12, can be calculated by the following formulas:
:formula_19 (5)
:formula_20 (6)
:formula_21 (7)
:formula_22 (8)
:formula_23 (9)
:formula_24 (10)
:formula_25 (11)
:formula_26 (12)
:formula_27 (13)

The flow rate can be determined by the intersection of the heat sink system curve and the fan curve. The heat sink system curve can be calculated by the flow resistance of the channels and inlet and outlet losses as done in standard fluid mechanics text books, such as Potter, et al. and White.

Once the heat sink base and fin resistances are known, then the heat sink thermal resistance, formula_28 can be calculated as:
:formula_29 (14).

Using the equations 5 to 13 and the dimensional data in, the thermal resistance for the fins was calculated for various air flow rates. The data for the thermal resistance and heat transfer coefficient are shown in the diagram, which shows that for an increasing air flow rate, the thermal resistance of the heat sink decreases.

===Experimental methods===
Experimental tests are one of the more popular ways to determine the heat sink thermal performance. In order to determine the heat sink thermal resistance, the flow rate, input power, inlet air temperature and heat sink base temperature need to be known. Vendor-supplied data is commonly provided for ducted test results. However, the results are optimistic and can give misleading data when heat sinks are used in an unducted application. More details on heat sink testing methods and common oversights can be found in Azar, et al.

===Numerical methods===

In industry, thermal analyses are often ignored in the design process or performed too late — when design changes are limited and become too costly. Of the three methods mentioned in this article, theoretical and numerical methods can be used to determine an estimate of the heat sink or component temperatures of products before a physical model has been made. A theoretical model is normally used as a first order estimate. Online heat sink calculators can provide a reasonable estimate of forced and natural convection heat sink performance based on a combination of theoretical and empirically derived correlations. Numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provide a qualitative (and sometimes even quantitative) prediction of fluid flows. What this means is that it will give a visual or post-processed result of a simulation, like the images in figures 16 and 17, and the CFD animations in figure 18 and 19, but the quantitative or absolute accuracy of the result is sensitive to the inclusion and accuracy of the appropriate parameters.

CFD can give an insight into flow patterns that are difficult, expensive or impossible to study using experimental methods. Experiments can give a quantitative description of flow phenomena using measurements for one quantity at a time, at a limited number of points and time instances. If a full-scale model is not available or not practical, scale models or dummy models can be used. The experiments can have a limited range of problems and operating conditions. Simulations can give a prediction of flow phenomena using CFD software for all desired quantities, with high resolution in space and time and virtually any problem and realistic operating conditions. However, if critical, the results may need to be validated.

In 2005, he won both a Grammy and a Latin Grammy Award for producing Cuban musician Cachao&#x27;s record &quot;¡Ahora Sí!&quot;

==Early life==
García was born Andrés Arturo García Menéndez in Havana, Cuba. His mother, Amelie Menéndez, was an English teacher and his father, René García, was an attorney in Cuba. García has two older siblings, a sister named Tessi and a brother named René. When he was five years old, his family moved to Miami, Florida after the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion. Over a period of several years, they built up a million-dollar perfume/fragrance company. García was raised as a Catholic and attended Miami Beach Senior High School, where he played on the basketball team. During his senior year of high school, he became ill with mononucleosis, which convinced him to pursue a career in acting. He began his acting career that year by taking a drama class with Jay W. Jensen. He graduated from Florida International University.

==Career==
=== 1980s ===
García began acting at Florida International University but soon went to Hollywood. He had a short role alongside Angela Lansbury in the first episode of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; as &quot;1st white tough&quot;, in 1984. He played the role of a gang member in &quot;Hill Street Station&quot;, the first episode of TV series &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;. He appeared in a supporting role in &quot;The Mean Season&quot; in 1985, alongside Kurt Russell.

In 1987, García received an acting breakthrough in Brian De Palma&#x27;s crime drama &quot;The Untouchables&quot;. The film starred Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, Charles Martin Smith, Patricia Clarkson, and Robert De Niro. The film follows Eliot Ness as he forms the Untouchables law enforcement team to bring Al Capone to justice during the Prohibition era. It received widespread critical acclaim and was a financial success.

In 1988, García played the main role in the music video clip of the British boyband Breathe. The song is called: &quot;How can I fall&quot; and reached #3 in the Billboard hot 100 in 1988.

In 1989, García acted in the Ridley Scott action thriller &quot;Black Rain&quot; with Michael Douglas as Detective Charlie Vincent. The film received mixed reviews from critics but was a financial success, earning $134 million.

===1990s===
In 1989, Francis Ford Coppola cast García as Vincent Mancini, the illegitimate son of Sonny Corleone, in &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; (1990). The film stars Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Eli Wallach. The film concludes the story of Michael Corleone, the patriarch of the Corleone family, who attempts to legitimize his criminal empire. For his performance, García earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, as well as a Golden Globe Award nomination.

In the 1990s, García appeared in the Mike Figgis film &quot;Internal Affairs&quot;, in which he engages in a battle of wits with a corrupt fellow police officer, played by Richard Gere. In 1992, he played a cynical everyman in Stephen Frears&#x27; &quot;Hero&quot; starring Dustin Hoffman, Geena Davis, and Joan Cusack. That same year, he co-starred with Uma Thurman in the thriller &quot;Jennifer 8&quot;. In 1994, he played the enabling husband of an alcoholic played by Meg Ryan in &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot;. In 1995, he portrayed a tragic criminal in &quot;Things to Do in Denver When You&#x27;re Dead&quot; alongside Christopher Lloyd, Steve Buscemi, and Christopher Walken. He starred as a hotshot lawyer in the 1996 Sidney Lumet drama &quot;Night Falls on Manhattan&quot; alongside Richard Dreyfus, and James Gandolfini. He played mobster Lucky Luciano in &quot;Hoodlum&quot; (1997) alongside Tim Roth, and Laurence Fishburne. He portrayed a cop trying to save his gravely ill son in the 1998 action thriller &quot;Desperate Measures&quot; starring Michael Keaton and Marcia Gay Harden.

===2000s===

In 2000, García starred and produced the HBO film, &quot;For Love or Country: The Arturo Sandoval Story&quot;. The film is about Cuba&#x27;s jazz scene and the life of trumpeter and composer Arturo Sandoval. It starred Gloria Estefan as Maria, and Charles S. Dutton as jazz legend Dizzy Gillespie. For his performance, García received Primetime Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations.

He portrayed the arrogant Las Vegas casino owner Terry Benedict in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; (2001), a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack caper movie starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Julia Roberts. The film was a massive commercial success earning $450 million at the box office. He also appeared in the sequel, &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; (2004), and in the third film, &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot; (2007).

He co-wrote, directed, and starred in &quot;The Lost City&quot; alongside Dustin Hoffman and Bill Murray. In 2005, he appeared in the last two episodes of the Turkish TV series &quot;Valley of the Wolves&quot;, along with Sharon Stone. In 2008, he starred in the first segment of &quot;New York, I Love You&quot; which was directed by Jiang Wen starring Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson.

Since 2009, García has been slated to direct the film &quot;Hemingway &amp; Fuentes&quot; about writer Ernest Hemingway, co-written by García and Hemingway&#x27;s niece Hilary Hemingway. They secured financing for the film in 2012, and García himself, Anthony Hopkins, and Annette Bening were announced as stars. Filming was originally to have begun in January 2013, but due to delays, Hopkins left the project in 2014 and was replaced by Jon Voight.

===2010s===
Towards the end of the 2010s, García had a career resurgence. He starred in four films in 2018.

He appeared as Fernando Cienfuegos in the critical and commercial success &quot;Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again&quot; alongside Cher, Amanda Seyfried, Lily James, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård, and Pierce Brosnan. When asked about singing with Cher, García told NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show, &quot;It was sublime. One thing is to act with Cher who is a great actress and then to be asked to sing with her&quot;.

García also starred in the Paramount romantic comedy, &quot;Book Club&quot;, alongside Diane Keaton, Candice Bergen, Jane Fonda, and Mary Steenburgen. The film was a box office success grossing over $89 million worldwide against its $10 million budget.

He also starred in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s drama film, &quot;The Mule&quot; alongside Eastwood, Bradley Cooper, Dianne Wiest, Laurence Fishburne and Michael Peña. It grossed $174.8 million and received positive reviews from critics.

García appeared in the HBO movie &quot;My Dinner with Hervé&quot; alongside Peter Dinklage and Jamie Dornan. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, and received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Television Movie.

=== 2020s ===
In 2020, García starred in Charles McDougall&#x27;s comedic film &quot;Ana&quot;. Also that year, he starred in Thor Freudenthal&#x27;s critically acclaimed coming of age drama &quot;Words on Bathroom Walls&quot;. The following year, he made an uncredited cameo in the comedy film &quot;Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar&quot; starring Kirsten Wiig and Jamie Dornan. That same year, he starred in the action films &quot;Redemption Day&quot; and the Guy Ritchie film &quot;Wrath of Man&quot;. 

In 2022, he starred in the comedy &quot;Big Gold Brick&quot;. He also starred opposite Gloria Estefan again in the romantic comedy HBO Max film &quot;Father of the Bride&quot;. It is the third filmed version of the 1949 novel of the same name by Edward Streeter.&quot;Time&quot; praised García on his comedic turn writing, &quot;Garcia carries the film ably with his gruff elegance&quot;. 

García appeared in the action comedy film &quot;Expend4bles&quot; as Marsh, a CIA agent who is also a double agent and the main antagonist of the film.

==Personal life==
Garcia met his now wife, Marivi Lorido, when they were both students at Florida International University during the mid-&#x27;70s when they first saw each other in a Miami nightclub. The couple dated for seven years before tying the knot on September 24, 1982. The family divides their time between Toluca Lake, Los Angeles and Key Biscayne, Florida.

The couple shares four children: Dominik García-Lorido, Daniella, Alessandra, and Andrés. Dominik was born on August 16, 1983, in Miami, Florida. She is married to Michael Doneger. Daniella was born on January 3, 1988, in Los Angeles, California. She is married to actor Stephen Borrello and the couple has a daughter named Violette Rose. Alessandra was born on June 20, 1991, in Los Angeles. The fourth child and only son, Andres, was born on January 28, 2002. Andres has gone on to become an established DJ across Los Angeles and Miami. 

García has often expressed his distaste for the communist regime that has ruled Cuba since the revolution. Following Fidel Castro&#x27;s death in November 2016, García criticized his legacy, stating: &quot;It is necessary for me to express the deep sorrow that I feel for all the Cuban people...that have suffered the atrocities and repression caused by Fidel Castro and his totalitarian regime.&quot;

In 2018, García attended a fundraiser event for Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, which raised $60 million. Following the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel in 2023 that killed 1,200, García signed an open letter by Creative Community for Peace condemning the killings and calling the world to &quot;stand with Israel as it defends itself against a terrorist regime in Gaza that seeks Israel’s destruction.&quot;

García is Catholic, and a naturalized citizen of the United States.

<text>Electoral reform in New Zealand has been a political issue in the past as major changes have been made to both parliamentary and local government electoral systems. A landmark reform was the mixed-member proportional (MMP) system, implemented in 1996 following a public referendum.

National elections in New Zealand were first held in 1853 and were conducted over a period of two and a half months. At this time, the country was divided into 24 electorates, who elected one, two or three members () depending on their population. In the multiple-seat districts, multiple non-transferable vote (block voting) was used; in the single-seat districts the basic first-past-the-post (FPP) was used. 

This system continued for a long time, with major diversions being only a change to the second ballot system (a type of two-round system), used for the and and swiftly repealed in 1913.

In the 1993 electoral reform referendum, New Zealanders voted to adopt the MMP system, a form of proportional representation combining single-member electorates and list MPs, first used in . Proportional representation led to an increase in minor parties entering Parliament, making multi-party governments the norm. Since the introduction of MMP, there have been occasional proposals for further reform; in a 2011 referendum, New Zealanders voted to retain MMP.

==Overview==

The first-past-the-post voting (FPP) electoral system, used in New Zealand for much of its history, was a simple plurality system, in which voters marked their preference for the candidate they wish to represent the electorate they live in. The candidate or candidates that garners the most votes through this process is then elected to Parliament. Generally, elections conducted in this manner result in an absolute majority, in which the party who wins the most votes wins a majority of seats and has the absolute power in the house. The only deviation from this in New Zealand during the FPP era was before the 1890s during which each member was independent and as such no political parties existed.

A bill was put forward in 1887 to divide the country into two districts, each of 20 members, and to use STV to elect the members. However, it failed to pass.

With the appearance of a New Liberal Party and the Independent Labour League, the old-time two-party system crumbled significantly. As early as the 1890s, in such ridings as Ashburton the successful candidate had been elected with less than half the votes cast in the district – in 1893 with as few as 32 percent of the vote. 

In the 1905 election, for the first time, all members were elected in single-member districts. Concern for fairness and avoidance of the bad effects of vote spitting led NZ to try out a majoritarian system of voting.

The second-ballot system used from 1908 to 1913 was a modification of the existing FPP system. A first election was held same as under FPP, but it guaranteed that a candidate to be elected, must garner over 50% of the votes in their district. If no one reached this threshold in the first count, a new round of voting was conducted featuring only the two highest polling candidates, this ensured one or the other received more than half the vote. This was discontinued in 1913, NZ reverting to FPP in single-member districts, the successful candidate winning by plurality, which in many cases was less than half the votes. As well, FPP was producing majority government but not since 1935 has a government been elected by a majority of the votes.

Many NZ voters became dissatisfied with this voting by the 1990s. Mixed-member proportional (MMP), as seen in New Zealand from 1996 onward, is a type of proportional system wherein each voter has two votes. One of these is for the candidate in their electorate and one is for the overall political party. The party vote is what ultimately decides the number of seats each party gains in parliament, with any shortfall between the number of electorates won and the party&#x27;s overall percentage of the party vote made up by list party members elected.

The impetus to change from FPP to MMP was largely due to the excessive disproportionality FPP elections are prone to. Prominent examples of this include the 1966 election, in which the Social Credit Party gained 9% of the vote and yet won only a single seat. Furthermore, this disproportionality often lead to the successful party winning less overall votes than the opposition, but gaining more seats. An example of this is the 1978 election, in which the Labour Party won more than 10,000 votes (0.6%) more than the National Party but gained 11 fewer seats in Parliament.

Another major factor that highlighted the weaknesses of FPP was the potential abuse of power that could occur. New Zealand does not have a written Constitution, and as such it is subject to change. Under FPP the power is concentrated with the leader of the winning party. Prime Minister Robert Muldoon showed this clearly when he illegally abolished the Superannuation scheme upon his election in 1975. Though the Judiciary ruled this move illegal, they were unable to halt the action and Muldoon faced no repercussions for this abuse of power.

Due to these factors, in 1979 the Labour Party adopted policy to seriously consider the adoption of proportional representation in place of the contemporary FPP system. While changes resultant from this were extremely delayed, the undercurrent of support for electoral reform continued and were bolstered by the commissioning of the Royal Commission on the Electoral System in 1985 which ultimately recommended a change to MMP. Finally, both the Labour and National parties entered the 1990 election with policy for a referendum on electoral reform. (The National Party won majority government in the elections of 1990 and 1993 with less than half the votes – evidence of the effects of vote-splitting under FPP, a system not well-suited to the multi-party system that NZ had.)

With both major parties calling for referendum on reform, a referendum to test public sentiment was held in 1992. The 1992 referendum represented the first tangible governmental step towards electoral reform. The results of this referendum overwhelmingly supported change and selected MMP as the preferred electoral system to replace FPP. Due to this a binding referendum was held the following year in 1993, offering a choice between these two systems. MMP was selected by a vote of 53.9% to 46.1%, a majority in favour of change. and was implemented before the next election in 1996.

== Parliamentary electoral reform ==
Authority for government in New Zealand is derived from Te Tiriti o Waitangi (Treaty of Waitangi), which was signed in 1840. The meaning of Te Tiriti is complicated by the fact that the Maori and English texts of the agreement are not entirely consistent in their meanings. While the English version is generally interpreted to have ceded absolute sovereignty, the Māori version only cedes governorship. Practically, in the years since 1840, the English interpretation was generally privileged. Thus, New Zealand officially became a British colony and was ruled by a governor until 1852, when the British government passed the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852. This Act established settler self-government in New Zealand by the way of a bi-cameral Parliament consisting of an appointed Legislative Council and a House of Representatives. Following this, the first government was elected using a simple first-past-the-post electoral system, with single and multi-member districts. Importantly, political franchise was only extended at this time to male land owners over the age of 21, which disqualified many Māori due to their communal ownership of land. Furthermore, no women were extended the right to vote. However this changed in 1893 when New Zealand became the first self-governing country in the world to allow women the right to vote.

=== Establishment of Māori electorates ===
In response to Māori antagonism towards the governments of the time due to their general lack of franchise, in 1867 the Māori Representation Act was passed, which established four additional Māori electorates throughout the country. Each of these would each elect a single member to Parliament, who was mandated to be full blooded Māori. However, all Māori males over the age of 21 were allowed to vote in these electorates regardless of their bloodline. Initially, these seats were created on an interim basis with a provision for their removal after five years had passed. Despite this, the Māori seats have remained even to this day as a part of the New Zealand political framework and have even been expanded in the Electoral Act 1993.

=== Introduction of universal suffrage ===
Universal male suffrage was introduced in 1879 by the passing of the Qualification of Electors Act, which abolished the previous requirement to own land. As such, all European men aged over 21 were now eligible to vote in New Zealand&#x27;s elections. The only qualifiers to this were that to be eligible to vote, one must have resided in New Zealand for 12 months and in a specific electorate for 6 months. This had an immediate and profound effect on the number of registered voters as they rose from 82,271 (71%) of the adult European population in 1879 to 120,972 (91%) in 1881. Furthermore, this allowed for election of people of different class to Parliament, including many &#x27;working men&#x27;.

Under huge pressure from suffrage campaigners led by Kate Sheppard, universal women&#x27;s suffrage followed in 1893 with the passing of the Electoral Act 1893. With this, New Zealand became the first self-governing nation in the world to grant women the vote. However, women still had not gained the right to stand for Parliament. Women&#x27;s suffrage only allowed women to vote for existing male candidates and as such, there was still a great deal of progress required until women had the same legal rights as men in these regards.

=== Second-ballot system 1908–1913 ===
The second-ballot system was introduced in the Second Ballot Act 1908 and was one of the first substantive reforms to the mechanism by which winning candidates are elected to Parliament to be seen in New Zealand. This system modified the original first-past-the-post electoral system to require the winning candidate in each electorate to have gained over 50% of the overall votes cast within their constituency. When the leading candidate did not achieve this, a second ballot would be held a week later featuring only the two leading candidates, to assure an absolute majority of votes was achieved. This method is otherwise known as runoff voting. However, this system only remained in place for five years as it was abolished in 1913 due to its supposed inequitable nature in the emerging party environment of Parliament.

=== Return to first past the post ===
Subsequently, New Zealand elections from 1914 to 1993 returned to the first-past-the-post system for parliamentary elections. However, in the newfound party context that had solidified throughout the second-ballot era it had somewhat unforeseen effects. While initially three main parties existed (the Liberal, Reform and Labour parties), the system quickly solidified into a two party system wherein the Reform and Liberal parties combined to create the National Party to oppose the Labour Party. This ushered in an era wherein National and Labour parties dominated New Zealand politics, with only a small number of independent and other party candidates being elected.

=== Debates around electoral reform ===
This ushered in an era of relative stability for many years, until the electoral reform debate began in earnest following two successive general elections in 1978 and 1981 in which the National Party won a majority in Parliament with less than 40% of the vote and a lower overall share of the vote than the opposing Labour Party. Other examples of this are evident in both the 1911 and 1931 elections. Furthermore, the Social Credit Party was a victim of disproportionality as while they won 16.1% of the vote in 1978 and 20.7% of the vote in 1981, they only won one and two seats in Parliament respectively.

In its 1984 campaign platform, the Labour party committed itself to appoint a royal commission on electoral reform if elected. Labour won that election and in 1985 Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice Geoffrey Palmer established a Royal Commission on the Electoral System. Palmer had promoted proportional representation as a law professor in his book &quot;Unbridled Power?&quot;, also published in 1984. The Royal Commission&#x27;s 1986 report, entitled &quot;Towards a Better Democracy&quot; recommended the adoption of an MMP electoral system. Recognising that a parliament dominated by the major parties might fail to implement a sweeping reform of this sort, the commission also proposed a referendum on the issue.

Ambivalence by the major parties and party politics led the issue to languish for several years, but in the meantime, an influential lobby group which had been formed, the Electoral Reform Coalition, continued to press for implementation of the royal commission’s proposals. During the 1987 election campaign, Labour promised to hold a referendum on MMP at, or before, the next election. Although Labour was returned to power in that election, it failed to proceed further on the matter due to its own internal divisions. In May 1990, Labour MP John Terris submitted a private members bill to force a binding referendum on the electoral system, but the bill was defeated.

Sensing Labour’s vulnerability on the issue, the National opposition criticised the government inaction, and National Party Leader Jim Bolger promised to carry on with a referendum if elected in 1990 and do so before the next election in 1993. Although there was even less support for reform among National parliamentarians than in the Labour Party, the new National government elected in 1990 was, like its predecessor, stuck with a rashly made campaign promise.

===1992 electoral system referendum===
In 1992, a non-binding referendum was held on whether or not FPP should be replaced by a new, more proportional voting system. New Zealanders voted overwhelmingly for change and indicated an overwhelming preference for MMP.

Voters were asked two questions: whether or not to replace FPP with a new voting system; and which of four different alternative systems should be adopted instead (see question one and question two, below). The government appointed a panel chaired by the Ombudsman to oversee the campaign. The panel issued a brochure describing each of the voting systems appearing on the ballot, which was delivered to all households, and sponsored other publications, television programs, and seminars to inform the public. Meanwhile, the Electoral Reform Coalition campaigned actively in favour of the MMP alternative originally recommended by the royal commission. These measures made it possible for voters to make an informed choice on what was otherwise a complicated issue.

This led New Zealanders to vote overwhelmingly for change (84.7%) and to indicate a clear and overwhelming preference for the MMP alternative (70.5%). Such a result could not be ignored by the government, but rather than implementing MMP as the government was urged to do by the Electoral Reform Coalition, it opted to hold a second binding referendum on reform. This referendum featured a direct choice between FPP and MMP and was planned to be held to coincide with the next general election in 1993.

====Question two in the 1992 referendum====
The second question asked voters which new system should replace FPP. Voters could choose between the following (as listed on the ballot):
* Mixed Member Proportional (MMP); also known as the seat linkage compensatory mixed system used in Germany (there called personalized proportional representation, and later under the name &quot;additional member&quot; system adopted in Scotland, and Wales); in which roughly half of the seats are elected by FPP; and the remainder are filled from party lists to top-up the local seats so as to ensure a proportional overall result;
* Single Transferable Vote (STV); a proportional system used in the Republic of Ireland, Malta, the Australian Senate, Northern Ireland, lower houses in Tasmania and ACT, and upper houses in NSW, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia; in which the country or province or state is divided into multimember constituencies; and each voter casts a single vote and ranks candidates in declining order of preference;
* &quot;Supplementary Member&quot; system (SM); commonly called the Parallel voting system, used in Japan, Russia and Italy; a semi-proportional mixed system with list proportional representation used to fill some seats; and a larger proportion of seats elected by FPP.
* &quot;Preferential Voting&quot; (PV); used in Australia and Fiji elections; similar to FPP but with voters ranking candidates in descending order of preference in single-seat constituencies (also called Instant-Runoff Voting).

As noted earlier, an overwhelming majority of those favouring a new electoral system voted for MMP. The percentages of the vote cast for the four possible electoral system options offered in the second question were:

===1993 electoral referendum===
The second, binding, referendum was held in conjunction with the general election on 6 November 1993. Although reform had been strongly favoured by the electorate in 1992, the campaign in the second referendum was hard fought, as opposition to the reforms came together under an umbrella organisation called Campaign for Better Government (CBG).

Many senior politicians in both major parties and businesspeople were opposed to MMP: Bill Birch, then a senior National Cabinet Minister, had said MMP would be &quot;a catastrophic disaster for democracy&quot;, and Ruth Richardson, former Minister of Finance in Jim Bolger&#x27;s government said MMP &quot;would bring economic ruin&quot;. Peter Shirtcliffe, chairman of Telecom New Zealand at the time and leader of the CBG, said MMP &quot;would bring chaos&quot;.

The Electoral Reform Coalition (ERC) was the main advocate for the adoption of MMP, and had support from several people, including the Green Party co-leader Rod Donald. MMP faced an uphill battle, as acknowledged in the pro-MMP poster to the side, since the proposed model was for increase in the number of MPs from 99 to 120. The CBG responded to the proposed increase in the number of MPs with a controversial television advertisement showing 21 faceless list MPs with paper bags over their heads.

The ERC also had a &quot;David and Goliath&quot; battle financially. With the CBG being backed by a large business lobby, they had large amounts of money to spend. While the CBG could spend large on television, radio and full-page newspaper advertisements, often with fear-evoking graphic images, the ERC had limited funds and concentrated more on advocating in communities.

At the same time, the country&#x27;s largest newspaper, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;, came out in support of the MMP proposal in the last week of the campaign, and press coverage overall was extensive and largely favourable. The Alliance heavily supported MMP, featuring &quot;vote MMP&quot; on all of its election billboards.
The CBG&#x27;s backing of business leaders and politicians proved to be damaging to their cause, giving the impression that they were &quot;a front for the business roundtable&quot;. The ERC capitalised on severe disenchantment with New Zealand&#x27;s political class after the severe effects of the neoliberal reforms of Rogernomics and Ruthanasia. After three elections in a row in which the parties that won power broke their promises and imposed unpopular market-oriented reforms, the New Zealand public came to see MMP as a way to curb the power of governments to engage in dramatic and unpopular reforms. Cartoonist Murray Ball reflected this perception in a cartoon starring his characters Wal Footrot and Dog, with Wal telling The Dog (and by extension the viewer), &quot;Want a good reason for voting for MMP? Look at the people who are telling you not to...&quot;

Given the link between the success of the referendum and anger at the &quot;status quo&quot;, politicians took lesser roles in the 1993 campaign, realising that their opposition to reform only increased voters&#x27; desire for change.

In the face of a strong opposition campaign, the final result was much closer than in 1992, but the reforms carried the day, with 53.9% of voters in favour of MMP. ERC spokesperson Rod Donald reflected in 2003, &quot;Had the referendum been held a week earlier I believe we would have lost.&quot; Lending additional legitimacy to the second referendum was the increase in the participation rate, which went from 55% in the 1992 referendum to 85% in the second one. The law had been written so that MMP came automatically into effect upon approval by the electorate, which it did.

Noteworthy in understanding the New Zealand case is that the reforms were able to go forward on the basis of majority support. This stands in contrast to the 60% requirement imposed in some other cases, such as the 2005 referendum on this issue in the Canadian province of British Columbia that failed despite a vote of 57.69% in support of the reform. Late in the campaign, Peter Shirtcliffe had in fact sought to act on this and proposed that the referendum should require a majority of the whole electorate, not just those voting, to pass the reform, which the government rejected.

===Introduction of MMP===
The first election using the MMP system was held in 1996. Districts were re-drawn as in this election there were 34 fewer district members than had been elected in the 1993 election. As well, the Parliamentary seating had to be reconfigured as overall there were to be 21 more members than had been elected in 1993.

Under MMP, each voter has two votes: the first vote is called the party vote and voters use this vote to express their support for a particular party. The second vote is the electorate vote, which is used to express support for a candidate to represent the voter&#x27;s electorate in Parliament.

New Zealand&#x27;s MMP system allocates top-up seats only to parties that have achieved an electoral threshold of 5 percent of the nationwide party vote, or success in an electorate, to ensure their proportion of the seat is about equal to its vote share. Parties who meet this threshold are entitled to a share of the seats in Parliament that is about the same as its share of the nationwide vote. If the number of its district seats are less than its vote share, it is allocated top-up seats. (Parties who do not exceed this threshold and who do not win at least one electorate seat receive no compensation for being under-represented. Those with less than .8 percent of the vote are not due any seats, of course.)

For example, if a party gets 30% of the party vote it is due roughly 36 MPs in Parliament (being 30% of 120 seats). If that party won 20 electorate seats, it will receive 16 List MPs in addition to its 20 Electorate MPs.

Because the system is proportional, it is difficult for any single party to gain a majority in Parliament alone. Therefore, coalitions or agreements between political parties are usually needed before Governments can be formed. The 2017 Election is a good example of this, resulting in a Labour-led government with coalitions with New Zealand First and the Greens.

Under the FPP, the two main parties had taken the lion&#x27;s share of the seats in 1993. The National party had taken majority government in 1993 with only 35 percent of the vote. Under MMP the result was much more proportional. The National Party was again the leading party and again took about 35 percent of the vote but this time won only 44 seats out of 120. Six parties won seats in the chamber compared to four under FPP in 1993. Such wide representation would be produced by MMP in every election until 2017.

The 5% threshold has been criticised as a significant problem for minor parties, and impedes their ability to gain seats in Parliament. (In 2017 the Opportunities party took more than 2 percent of the vote and was due two seats proportionally but took none. About 6 percent of the vote in that election did not deliver any representation.) This has led to proposals to lower the percentage threshold.

Coalition governments were rare, but not impossible under the FPP system. Most of the time a single party won majority government even if it did not win a majority of the vote. The majority governments elected in New Zealand have been mostly false-majority governments. Not since 1935 has a government been elected by a majority of the votes.

As an example of a coalition government under FPP, in 1931–35 there was the United/Reform coalition. Following the 1996 general election it took six weeks to form a coalition, showing that this is not a quick process.

MMP is arguably a more democratic system than FPP. Supporters of MMP criticised FPP for creating elective dictatorships, and promoting the excessive power of one party government. Supporters consider MMP to provide increased representational fairness, and better-considered, wiser, and more moderate policies because of cooperation of the leading party and minority parties.

Furthermore, MMP is considered to increase the representation of a diverse population, enabling a higher percentage of Maori, women, Pasifika and Asian people in Parliament.

However, supporters of FPP believe FPP provides a more stable Parliament, and avoids a minority party &quot;kingmaker&quot;, as was the case in 2017 with New Zealand First determining who would lead the government.

Prior to the switch to MMP, New Zealand largely had a two party system, with government interchanging between Labour and National since 1935.

Under MMP, National and Labour lost their complete dominance in the House, with the 2020 election – the ninth since the introduction of MMP – being the first to give a single political party a majority of the seats (with very close to a majority of the votes). This had meant that electoral results have usually required political parties to form coalitions to govern. Indeed, since 1998 there have been minority coalition governments relying on supply and confidence from parties outside of government.

With the introduction of MMP, due to New Zealand&#x27;s unique provision for parties to win list seats if they win at least one local seat despite getting less than the 5% threshold, there has been a widening of political parties represented within the House.

Prior to the 1996 election, there were four parties in the chamber. After the switch to MMP, the 1996 election gave seats in Parliament to six parties. The Act New Zealand party and United New Zealand was elected to Parliament for first time, joining the earlier elected Alliance, National, New Zealand First and Labour parties. Within a few years eight parties had seats in the chamber, after the Greens separated from the Alliance for the 1999 election, and after the creation of the Māori Party in 2004, and with the continued use of MMP.

The number of political parties was then expected to fall (as happened in Germany after its adoption of MMP), but instead seven or eight parties consistently had seats (see the table below). This was the case until the 2017 election where the number of parties in Parliament fell to five, the lowest it has been since MMP was introduced.

The 2017 election saw a severe decrease in the vote share for the two larger minor parties that were returned to parliament. This could be attributed to political scandals and the popularity of the Labour leader candidate, Jacinda Ardern, and evidence of the beginning of an overall decline.

The transition to MMP increased the democratic accountability and tightened the relationship between votes cast and the seats. The change decreased the disproportionality of New Zealand&#x27;s elections.
===2011 referendum===

As part of the lead-up to the 2008 general election, the National Party promised a second referendum to decide whether or not to keep MMP. Upon gaining power, the party legislated that the referendum would be held alongside the 2011 general election, which took place on Saturday 26 November 2011. The referendum was similar to the 1992 referendum, in that voters were asked firstly to choose whether to keep the MMP system or to change to another system, and secondly to indicate which alternative system would, in the case of change, have their preference.

Nearly 58% of voters voted to keep the MMP system in preference to any of the other four options, compared to 1993, where just under 54% had favoured MMP in preference to keeping FPP. On the second question, nearly one-third of voters didn&#x27;t vote, or cast an invalid vote. Of those who did vote, nearly 47% favoured the former FPP system.

===2012 review===
On the back of the majority of voters voting to keep the MMP system, a review into the workings of the system by the Electoral Commission was automatically triggered. The Commission released a public consultation paper on 13 February 2012 calling for public submissions, with particular emphasis placed on six key areas. On 13 August 2012, the Commission released its proposal paper, recommending changes to some of the six areas. After submissions on the proposals were considered, the final report was presented to the Minister of Justice on 29 October 2012. It is up to Parliament to decide whether to enact any of the recommendations.

=== 2024 Independent Electoral Review ===
In response to generally declining voter turnout, a number of commentators have proposed changes to the electoral system.

Former Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer has expressed support for the introduction of compulsory voting in New Zealand, as has existed in Australia since 1924. It is believed that such a measure will improve democratic engagement, although former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern opposed it on the grounds that citizens should vote because they&#x27;re engaged, not because they are compelled to.

Palmer has also expressed support for lowering the voting age to 16, considering that this may provide a platform for increased civic education during high school years.

In October 2021, the Labour government initiated a review of aspects of New Zealand&#x27;s electoral law. The Independent Electoral Review Panel was established in May 2022 and has its own website.

The Ministry of Justice published the final report of the Independent Electoral Review on 16 January 2024. The new National Party justice minister Paul Goldsmith ruled out implementing changes such as lowering the voting age to 16, allowing prisoners to vote, and increasing the size of parliament.

== Local government elections ==
Up until the 2004 local elections, all territorial authorities were elected using the bloc vote (although often referred to as first-past-the-post). In 2004, at the discretion of the council, they could use the single transferable vote. Eight local bodies used STV in the 2007 local body elections. However, only five territorial authorities used STV in the 2013 local elections.

Almost all regional authorities in New Zealand use FPP. However the Greater Wellington Regional Council used STV for the first time in the 2013 elections, becoming the first time that a regional authority used STV.

Before their abolition, all district health boards used STV.

In February 2021, the government passed the Local Electoral (Māori Wards and Māori Constituencies) Amendment Act which removed the option for citizens to require a local poll to decide whether the council should establish a Māori ward. The poll option had been seen as a barrier to establishing Māori wards. Twenty-four councils had sought to establish Māori wards since 2002 and only two had been successful. The government enacted the change against advice from the Department of Internal Affairs, which recommended more time was provided to consult on the change.

<text>In electronics, a signal trace or circuit trace on a printed circuit board (PCB) or integrated circuit (IC) is the equivalent of a wire for conducting signals. Each trace consists of a flat, narrow part of the copper foil that remains after etching. Signal traces are usually narrower than power or ground traces because the current carrying requirements are usually much less.

<text>Squadron Commander Christopher Draper (15 April 1892 – 16 January 1979), was an English flying ace of World War I. His penchant for flying under bridges earned him the nickname &quot;the Mad Major&quot;. After the war he became a film star through his work both as a stunt pilot and as an actor. During the 1930s he worked for a time as a British secret agent, serving as a double agent to Nazi Germany. He returned to the Navy in World War II. During his flying career he logged over 17,000 flying hours on 73 types of aircraft.

==Early life==
Christopher Draper was born at Bebington on the Wirral in Cheshire, England, into a family of five sons and two daughters. He became interested in flying in July 1909 when Louis Blériot flew across the English Channel. Unable to afford the £75 fee for pilot training, Draper wrote to his local MP, Joseph Hoult, who was an acquaintance of his father. Hoult provided Draper with £210 after making him promise not to tell anyone about the gift. On 9 October 1913, with a total of 3 hours 15 minutes of flying experience, he obtained Royal Aero Club Aviator&#x27;s Certificate No. 646 after flying a Grahame-White biplane at the Grahame-White Flying School at Hendon Aerodrome.

While trying to find a job flying, he learned from a cousin in the service that the Royal Navy was offering short service commissions to pilots with an Aviator&#x27;s Certificate. After passing the medical Draper joined the Royal Naval Air Service on 27 January 1914 and was commissioned as a probationary sub-lieutenant, RNR.

From January to April 1914 he attended the fifth course at the Central Flying School. Also on the course were Hugh Dowding and Wilfrid Freeman while the instructors included John Tremayne Babington and John Salmond – all of whom were later air marshals. After passing his course, Draper was assigned to the Royal Naval Air Station at Eastchurch under the command of Commander Charles Rumney Samson. He was promoted to flight lieutenant in June, and on 20 July he was one of nine pilots who flew in the Naval Review at Spithead, the first review to include aircraft.

Spending the initial war years on Home Defence in Newcastle and Scotland, Draper initiated his liking for dare-devil exploits by flying a seaplane under one of the spans of the Firth of Tay bridge near Dundee. While based at Dundee, Draper was ordered to land an aeroplane on the green at St. Andrew&#x27;s golf course. He stopped right in front of the clubhouse.

On 28 June 1915 he was promoted to flight commander.

==World War I==
===Royal Naval Air Service===
In mid-1916 he was posted to 3 Naval Wing, who were preparing to go to France. While collecting his new Sopwith 1½ Strutter, Draper flew the aircraft under the foot-bridge which ran around the racing track behind the Sopwith hangars at Brooklands. While flying the Sopwith 1½ Strutter with 3 Naval Wing he scored his first four victories while carrying out some of the first strategic bombing missions against German industrial targets. In 1917 he flew with 6 Naval Squadron on Nieuports, claiming two victories.

On 6 June 1917 his aircraft was shot up whilst in action against Jasta 5, before Draper slightly wounded prominent German ace Lt. Werner Voss (with 34 victories at the time), and forced him to land his Albatros D.III. After a heated argument with his commanding officer, Draper was transferred back to England soon after.

In the autumn of 1917 he returned to combat with 8 Naval Squadron, with which he scored three more victories. In October 1917 Draper became commanding officer of 8 Naval Squadron. Like most RNAS and RFC squadrons by now, it was a multi-national unit, manned by British, Australians (including the leading Australian ace Robert A. Little), Canadians, and at least one American. By the time the war ended, this squadron would boast 25 aces.

On 31 December 1917 he was promoted to squadron commander. In March 1918 the squadron was posted to RAF Walmer and then on 30 March departed for France one day before the RNAS and RFC were amalgamated to form the RAF. Draper later commented &quot;What a change, I don&#x27;t think the Squadron was ever the same again&quot;.

During the Ludendorff Offensive of spring 1918 the German Army&#x27;s initial breakthrough and rate of advance was such that Draper was forced to order the burning of 16 of Naval 8&#x27;s aircraft to prevent them being captured on the ground.

===Royal Air Force===
On 1 April 1918, 8 Naval Squadron became No. 208 Squadron RAF when the RNAS and the Royal Flying Corps merged to become the Royal Air Force. Draper refused to wear the new blue RAF uniform, and continued to wear the old naval blacks.

On 13 October 1918, he was wounded by anti-aircraft fire.

One morning while flying towards the front lines Draper accidentally flew under a bridge while in full view of a large body of troops. The troops cheered so heartily that Draper repeated the stunt wherever possible. This earned him his nickname &quot;The Mad Major&quot;. (In its early days the RAF used Army ranks.)

For his service in the war he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in April 1918 and the French Croix de Guerre in August 1919.

==Interwar years==
===Stunt and film flying===
After the war Draper became a secondhand car salesman. When this venture failed he returned to flying, and in April 1919 he was the chief test pilot for the British Aerial Transport Company, piloting the first flight of their F.K.26. This was the first aircraft specifically designed to carry passengers.

Draper was lucky to survive a crash on 23 March 1920 test flying the BAT Bantam at Hendon. When the company folded Draper sought an interview with Air Marshal Hugh Trenchard and was granted a short service commission as a squadron leader on 27 September 1920. Posted to the Central Flying School he led the RAF aerobatic team in the 1921 Air Pageant in July, and then resigned on 6 October. After leaving the RAF, he continued to fly as a stunt pilot at air shows and in films.

In 1930, out of work and penniless, he decided to raise his public profile and protest over the government&#x27;s treatment of war veterans by staging an aerial publicity stunt. Borrowing a Puss Moth, he set out to fly under all 14 of London&#x27;s bridges over the River Thames. Due to bad weather on the day he only managed to fly under two. This was captured on film and brought &quot;The Mad Major&quot; the desired degree of fame.

Draper&#x27;s work as a stunt pilot in films eventually led him into acting. Standing six feet two inches tall, with a robust frame and a classic profile, he was photogenic. He starred in many theatrical productions and several films as &quot;George Mannering&quot;. He played a pilot in 1935&#x27;s &quot;King of the Damned&quot;.

===Espionage work===
In 1932 Draper was invited to participate in an &quot;Aces of the Air Tour&quot; of Germany. Aces from many nations participated. In addition to meeting various German aces (he became firm friends with the German ace Major Eduard Ritter von Schleich). He was also introduced to Adolf Hitler.

As a result of this meeting and of Draper&#x27;s longstanding criticism of the British government&#x27;s treatment of veterans, he was listed by the Nazi Party as a potential sympathiser. After his return to England he was contacted and asked to spy for the Germans. He agreed and then immediately contacted MI6. They decided to use him as a double agent to feed false information to the Nazis. This situation continued for about four years until the Germans stopped answering Draper&#x27;s communications.

==World War II and post-war years==
In 1939, Draper joined the Royal Naval Reserve and was posted to Ford as assistant armament officer before going to Trinidad. In World War II, although 47 years of age, he became a lieutenant commander with postings in Scotland and the Gold Coast in 1943, before commanding No. 777 Squadron at Freetown, flying anti-submarine duties in Supermarine Walrus, Boulton Paul Defiant and Fairey Swordfish aircraft.

After the war Draper once more drifted into a variety of activities including acting and store-keeping. By the 1950s he was once again upset at the government&#x27;s treatment of veterans. On 5 May 1953, he again repeated his earlier protest by flying under the Thames bridges. This time he flew a rented, 100 h.p. Auster monoplane under 15 of the 18 bridges. It was a spectacular stunt; the bridge arches were only 40 to 50 feet high; Draper was flying 90 mph and dodged around a ship. According to news accounts, he pulled off his stunt as a means of seeking attention and soliciting job offers. He was arrested, charged with flying too low in an urban area, and assessed a nominal ten guineas court costs.

&quot;I did it for the publicity&quot;, Draper told the press; &quot;For 14 months I have been out of a job, and I&#x27;m broke. I wanted to prove that I am still fit, useful and worth employing. ... They tell me I can be jailed, possibly for six months. ... It was my last-ever flight- I meant it as a spectacular swansong.&quot;

However, he retained his pilot&#x27;s licence for another eleven years; it was revoked in 1964.

His memoir, &quot;The Mad Major&quot;, was published by Aero Publishers in 1962.

Draper died in Camden, London in 1979.

<doc id="344136" wikidata="Q1878250" url="?curid=344136" title="Electrical termination">
<text>In electronics, electrical termination is the practice of ending a transmission line with a device that matches the characteristic impedance of the line. Termination prevents signals from reflecting off the end of the transmission line. Reflections at the ends of unterminated transmission lines cause distortion, which can produce ambiguous digital signal levels and misoperation of digital systems. Reflections in analog signal systems cause such effects as video ghosting, or power loss in radio transmitter transmission lines.

==Transmission lines==
Signal termination often requires the installation of a terminator at the beginning and end of a wire or cable to prevent an RF signal from being reflected back from each end, causing interference, or power loss. The terminator is usually placed at the end of a transmission line or daisy chain bus (such as in SCSI), and is designed to match the AC impedance of the cable and hence minimize signal reflections, and power losses. Less commonly, a terminator is also placed at the driving end of the wire or cable, if not already part of the signal-generating equipment.

Radio frequency currents tend to reflect from discontinuities in the cable, such as connectors and joints, and travel back down the cable toward the source, causing interference as primary reflections. Secondary reflections can also occur at the cable starts, allowing interference to persist as repeated echoes of old data. These reflections also act as bottlenecks, preventing the signal power from reaching the destination.

Transmission line cables require impedance matching to carry electromagnetic signals with minimal reflections and power losses. The distinguishing feature of most transmission line cables is that they have uniform cross-sectional dimensions along their length, giving them a uniform electrical characteristic impedance. Signal terminators are designed to specifically match the characteristic impedances at both cable ends. For many systems, the terminator is a resistor, with a value chosen to match the characteristic impedance of the transmission line and chosen to have acceptably low parasitic inductance and capacitance at the frequencies relevant to the system. Examples include 75-ohm resistors often used to terminate 75-ohm video transmission coaxial cables.

Types of transmission line cables include balanced line such as ladder line, and twisted pairs (Cat-6 Ethernet, Parallel SCSI, ADSL, Landline Phone, XLR audio, USB, Firewire, Serial); and unbalanced lines such as coaxial cable (Radio antenna, CATV, 10BASE5 Ethernet).

== Types of electrical and signal terminators ==

===Passive===
Passive terminators often consist of a single resistor; however, significantly reactive loads may require other passive components such as inductors, capacitors, or transformers.

===Active===
Active terminators consist of a voltage regulator that keeps the voltage used for the terminating resistor(s) at a constant level.

====Forced perfect termination====

Forced perfect termination (FPT) can be used on single ended buses where diodes remove over and undershoot conditions. The signal is locked between two actively regulated voltage levels, which results in superior performance over a standard active terminator.

== Signal Termination Applications ==

===SCSI===
All parallel SCSI units use terminators. SCSI is primarily used for storage and backup. An active terminator is a type of single-ended SCSI terminator with a built-in voltage regulator to compensate for variations in terminator power.

===Controller Area Network===
Controller area network, commonly known as CAN Bus, uses terminators consisting of a 120 ohm resistor.

===Dummy load===

Dummy loads are commonly used in HF to EHF circuits.

===Ethernet coaxial 50 ohm===
10BASE2 networks absolutely must have proper termination with a 50 ohm BNC terminator. If the bus network is not properly terminated, too much power will be reflected, causing all of the computers on the bus to lose network connectivity.

===Antenna network 75 ohm===
A terminating resistor for a television coaxial cable is often in the form of a cap, threaded to screw onto an F connector. Antenna cables are sometimes used for internet connections; however, RG-6 should not be used for 10BASE2 (which should use RG-58) as the impedance mismatch can cause phasing problems with the baseband signal.

===Unibus===

The Digital Equipment Corporation minicomputer Unibus systems used terminator cards with 178 Ω pull-up resistors on the multi-drop address and data lines and 383 Ω on the single-drop signal lines.

===MIL-STD-1553===
Terminating resistor values of 78.7 ohms 2 watt 1% are used on the MIL-STD-1553 bus. At the two ends of the bus, resistors connect between the positive (high) and negative (low) signal wires either in internally terminated bus couplers or external connectorized terminators.

The MIL-STD-1553B bus must be terminated at both ends to minimize the effects of signal reflections that can cause waveform distortion and disruption or intermittent communications failures.

Optionally, a high-impedance terminator (1000 to 3000 ohms) may be used in vehicle applications to simulate a future load from an unspecified device.

Connectorized terminators are available with or without safety chains.

<text>Harold Andrew Blackmun (November 12, 1908 – March 4, 1999) was an American lawyer and jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1970 to 1994. Appointed by President Richard Nixon, Blackmun ultimately became one of the most liberal justices on the Court. He is best known as the author of the Court&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Roe v. Wade.&quot;

Raised in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Blackmun graduated from Harvard Law School in 1932. He practiced law in the Twin Cities, representing clients such as the Mayo Clinic. In 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. After the defeat of two previous nominees, President Nixon successfully nominated Blackmun to the Supreme Court to replace Associate Justice Abe Fortas. Blackmun and his close friend, Chief Justice Warren Burger, were often called the &quot;Minnesota Twins&quot;, but Blackmun drifted away from Burger during their tenure on the court. He retired from the Court during President Bill Clinton&#x27;s administration and was succeeded by Stephen Breyer.

Aside from &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, notable majority opinions by Blackmun include &quot;Bates v. State Bar of Arizona&quot;, &quot;Bigelow v. Commonwealth of Virginia&quot;, and &quot;Stanton v. Stanton&quot;. He joined part of the joint opinion in &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; but also filed a separate opinion, warning that &quot;Roe&quot; was in jeopardy. He wrote dissenting opinions in notable cases such as &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot;, and &quot;DeShaney v. Winnebago County&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Blackmun was born on November 12, 1908, in Nashville, Illinois, to Theo Huegely (Reuter) and Corwin Manning Blackmun. His grandparents were German immigrants who operated a flour mill in Nashville, Illinois. Three years after his birth, his brother, Corwin Manning Blackmun Jr., died soon after birth; his sister, Betty, was born in 1917. Blackmun grew up in Dayton&#x27;s Bluff, a working-class neighborhood in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where his father owned a small store. He attended the same grade school as future Chief Justice Warren E. Burger. Blackmun was a Methodist.

Blackmun attended Mechanic Arts High School in Saint Paul, where he graduated fourth in his class of 450 in 1925. He expected to attend the University of Minnesota but received a scholarship to attend Harvard University, from which he graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; and Phi Beta Kappa with a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1929. At Harvard, Blackmun joined Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity and sang with the Harvard Glee Club (with which he performed for President Herbert Hoover in 1929, Blackmun&#x27;s first visit to Washington). He attended Harvard Law School (where future Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter was among his professors), graduating with a Bachelor of Laws in 1932.

== Career ==
After graduating from law school, Blackmun returned to Minnesota, where he served in a variety of positions including private counsel, law clerk, and adjunct faculty at the University of Minnesota Law School and William Mitchell College of Law (then the St. Paul College of Law). Blackmun&#x27;s practice as an attorney at the law firm now known as Dorsey &amp; Whitney focused in its early years on taxation, trusts and estates, and civil litigation. He married Dorothy Clark in 1941 and they had three daughters. Motivated by his initial passion for medicine, Blackmun accepted a position as resident counsel for the Mayo Clinic in Rochester from 1950 to 1959.

== Court of Appeals ==
In the late 1950s, Blackmun&#x27;s close friend Warren E. Burger, then an appellate judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, repeatedly encouraged Blackmun to seek a judgeship. Judge John B. Sanborn Jr. of the Eighth Circuit, whom Blackmun had clerked for after graduating from Harvard, told Blackmun of his plans to assume senior status. He said that he would recommend Blackmun to the Eisenhower administration if Blackmun wished to succeed him. After much urging by Sanborn and Burger, Blackmun agreed to accept the nomination, duly offered by Eisenhower and members of the Justice Department. On August 18, 1959, Eisenhower nominated Blackmun to the seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit vacated by Sanborn. The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave Blackmun a rating of &quot;exceptionally well qualified&quot;. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 14, 1959, and received his commission on September 21. Over the next decade, Blackmun wrote 217 opinions for the Eighth Circuit. His service on the Court of Appeals ended on June 8, 1970, due to his appointment to the Supreme Court.

== Supreme Court ==
President Richard Nixon nominated Blackmun as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court on April 15, 1970, and the U.S. Senate confirmed him on May 12, by a 94–0 vote. He was sworn into office on June 9, 1970. This was Nixon&#x27;s third attempt to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Abe Fortas on May 14, 1969. His earlier failed nominees were Clement Haynsworth in September 1969 and G. Harrold Carswell in February 1970. Not since 1894, during the second Cleveland Administration, had a president had two Supreme Court nominees rejected by the Senate. This was also the longest vacancy on the court since 1873–74, during the Grant Administration391 days from Fortas&#x27;s resignation to Blackmun&#x27;s swearing-in.

While on the Court, Blackmun served as Circuit Justice for the Eighth Circuit (June 9, 1970 – August 2, 1994) and for the First Circuit (August 7, 1990 – October 8, 1990).

=== Early years on the Supreme Court ===
A lifelong Republican, Blackmun was expected to adhere to a conservative interpretation of the Constitution. The Court&#x27;s Chief Justice at the time, Warren E. Burger, a longtime friend of Blackmun&#x27;s and best man at his wedding, had recommended Blackmun for the job to Nixon. The two were often called the &quot;Minnesota Twins&quot; (a reference to the baseball team, the Minnesota Twins, in turn named after the &quot;Twin Cities&quot; of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota) because of their common history in Minnesota and because they so often voted together. Indeed, Blackmun voted with Burger in 87.5% of the closely divided cases during his first five terms (1970 to 1975), and with William J. Brennan, the Court&#x27;s leading liberal, in only 13%. In 1972, Blackmun joined Burger and Nixon&#x27;s other two appointees in dissenting from &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, the decision that invalidated all capital punishment laws then in force in the United States, and in 1976, he voted to reinstate the death penalty in &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot;, even the mandatory death penalty statutes. In both instances Blackmun indicated his personal opinion of the death penalty&#x27;s shortcomings as a policy, but insisted his political opinions should have no bearing on the death penalty&#x27;s constitutionality.

That began to change, however, between 1975 and 1980, by which time Blackmun was joining Brennan in 54.5% of the divided cases, and Burger in 45.5%. Shortly after Blackmun dissented in &quot;Rizzo v. Goode&quot; (1976), William Kunstler embraced him and &quot;welcom[ed] him to the company of the &#x27;liberals and the enlightened.&#x27;&quot;

From 1981 to 1986, when Burger retired, the two men voted together in only 32.4% of close cases, whereas Blackmun joined Brennan in 70.6% of the close cases.

=== Abortion ===
In 1973, Blackmun authored the majority opinion in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, invalidating a Texas statute that banned abortion except when a pregnant woman&#x27;s life was in danger. The Court&#x27;s judgment in the companion case of &quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot; held a less restrictive Georgia law to be unconstitutional as well. &quot;Roe&quot; was based on the right to privacy announced in &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; (1965), and it established a constitutional right to abortion in the United States. Blackmun&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Roe&quot; made him a target for criticism by opponents of abortion, and he received voluminous negative mail and death threats because of it.

Blackmun became a passionate advocate for abortion rights, often delivering speeches and lectures promoting &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; as essential to women&#x27;s equality and criticizing &quot;Roe&quot;″s critics. Defending abortion rights in &quot;Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&quot;, Blackmun wrote:

Blackmun filed separate opinions in &quot;Webster v. Reproductive Health Services&quot; (1989) and &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; (1992), warning that &quot;Roe&quot; was in jeopardy: &quot;I am 83 years old. I cannot remain on this Court forever, and when I do step down, the confirmation process for my successor well may focus on the issue before us today. That, I regret, may be exactly where the choice between the two worlds will be made.&quot;

Ancillary to the primary right to abortion, Blackmun extended First Amendment protection to commercial speech in &quot;Bigelow v. Commonwealth of Virginia&quot;, a case where the Supreme Court overturned the conviction of an editor who ran an advertisement for an abortion referral service.

=== Split with Burger ===
After &quot;Roe&quot;, Blackmun began to drift away from Burger&#x27;s influence to increasingly side with Brennan in finding constitutional protection for unenumerated individual rights. For example, Blackmun wrote a dissent to the Court&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; (1986). The Court&#x27;s ruling in this case denied constitutional protection to homosexual sodomy. Burger&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Bowers&quot; read: &quot;To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching.&quot; In his dissent, Blackmun responded by quoting Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.: &quot;[i]t is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past.&quot; Burger and Blackmun drifted apart, and as the years passed, their lifelong friendship degenerated into a hostile and contentious relationship.

From the 1981 term through the 1985 term, Blackmun voted with Brennan 77.6% of the time, and with Thurgood Marshall 76.1%. From 1986 to 1990, his rate of agreement with the two most liberal justices was 97.1% and 95.8%.

Blackmun&#x27;s judicial philosophy increasingly seemed guided by &quot;Roe&quot;, even in areas where &quot;Roe&quot; was not apparently directly applicable. His concurring opinion in 1981&#x27;s &quot;Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County&quot;, a case that upheld statutory rape laws that applied only to men, did not directly implicate &quot;Roe&quot;, but because the laws were justified on the basis that women would be subject to the &quot;risk&quot; of pregnancy, Blackmun had cause to discuss &quot;Roe&quot; further in his opinion.

=== Later years on the bench ===
Despite Blackmun&#x27;s stated personal &quot;abhorrence&quot; of the death penalty in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, he voted to uphold mandatory death penalty statutes at issue in &quot;Roberts v. Louisiana&quot; (1976) and &quot;Woodson v. North Carolina&quot; (1976), even though these laws would have automatically imposed the death penalty on anyone found guilty of first-degree murder. But on February 22, 1994, less than two months before announcing his retirement, Blackmun announced that he now saw the death penalty as always and in all circumstances unconstitutional by issuing a dissent from the Court&#x27;s refusal to hear a routine death penalty case (&quot;Callins v. Collins&quot;), declaring that &quot;[f]rom this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death.&quot; Subsequently, adopting the practice begun by Justices Brennan and Marshall, he issued a dissent from denial of certiorari in every death penalty case, citing and reiterating his &quot;Callins&quot; dissent. As Linda Greenhouse and others have reported, Blackmun&#x27;s law clerks prepared what would become the &quot;Callins&quot; dissent well in advance of the case coming before the Court; Blackmun&#x27;s papers indicate that work began on the dissent in the summer of 1993, and in a memo preserved in Blackmun&#x27;s papers, the clerk writing the dissent wrote Blackmun that:
Blackmun and his clerks then sought an appropriate case to serve as a &quot;vehicle for [the] dissent,&quot; and settled on &quot;Callins&quot;. That the case found the dissent, rather than the more traditional relationship of the dissent relating to the case, is underscored by the opinion&#x27;s almost total omission of reference to the case it ostensibly addressed: Callins is relegated to a supernumerary in his own appeal, being mentioned but five times in a 42-paragraph opinion – three times within the first two paragraphs, and twice in footnote 2.

Blackmun also wrote an impassioned dissent in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; (1986), in which the Court upheld sodomy laws. He wrote, &quot;This case is no more about &#x27;a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy&#x27; any more than Stanley v. Georgia was about a fundamental right to view obscene movies or Katz v. United States was about a fundamental right to place interstate bets through a telephone booth. Rather, this case is about &#x27;the right most valued by civilized men, namely the right to be let alone&#x27;.&quot; Blackmun criticized the Court for its &quot;almost obsessive focus on homosexual activity&quot;, noting that the sodomy law nominally prohibited both homosexual and heterosexual sodomy. He concluded his dissent: &quot;It took but three years for the Court to see the error in its analysis in &quot;Minersville School District v. Gobitis&quot;, 310 U.S. 586 (1940), and to recognize that the threat to national cohesion posed by a refusal to salute the flag was vastly outweighed by the threat to those same values posed by compelling such a salute. See &quot;West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette&quot;, 319 U. S. 624 (1943). I can only hope that here, too, the Court soon will reconsider its analysis and conclude that depriving individuals of the right to choose for themselves how to conduct their intimate relationships poses a far greater threat to the values most deeply rooted in our Nation’s history than tolerance of nonconformity could ever do. Because I think the Court today betrays these values, I dissent,&quot; deliberately omitting the customary &quot;respectfully&quot; before &quot;dissent&quot;.

In his emotional dissent in &quot;DeShaney v. Winnebago County&quot; (1989), rejecting the constitutional liability of the state of Wisconsin for four-year-old Joshua DeShaney, who was beaten until brain-damaged by his abusive father, Blackmun famously opined, &quot;Poor Joshua!&quot; In his dissent in &quot;Herrera v. Collins&quot; (1993), where the Court refused to find a constitutional right for convicted prisoners to introduce new evidence of &quot;actual innocence&quot; for purposes of obtaining federal relief, Blackmun argued in a section joined by no other justice that &quot;The execution of a person who can show that he is innocent comes perilously close to simple murder.&quot;

=== Women&#x27;s rights ===
In &quot;Stanton v. Stanton&quot; (1975), a case striking down a state&#x27;s definitions of adulthood (males reaching it at 21, women at 18), Blackmun wrote:
== Relationship with law clerks ==
Compared to other justices, Blackmun gave his law clerks great latitude in drafting opinions, such as his opinion in &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;, which was written by Stephanie Dangel, then one of Blackmun&#x27;s clerks and now a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh. According to Dangel, Blackmun&#x27;s &quot;Casey&quot; opinion draft initially included sharp criticism of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, including a sarcastic reference to him as &quot;The Chief&quot; rather than &quot;Chief Justice&quot; because &quot;I have my doubts as to whether he deserves to be called &#x27;justice&#x27; on this one.&quot; Dangel changed it to &quot;Chief Justice&quot; at Justice Anthony Kennedy&#x27;s urging.

Blackmun also revealed in a 1995 oral history with Harold Koh that his dissent in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; was written by a clerk, Pam Karlan. He said: &quot;Karlan did a lot of very effective writing, and I owe a lot to her and her ability in getting that dissent out. She felt very strongly about it, and I think is correct in her approach to it. I think the dissent is correct.&quot;

=== Notable clerks ===
Blackmun&#x27;s clerks included Edward B. Foley and Chai Feldblum.

== Relationship with other justices ==
When Blackmun&#x27;s papers were released at the Library of Congress, his sometimes negative notations regarding fellow Justice Clarence Thomas came to light. But Thomas spoke positively of Blackmun when he appeared in 2001 at the dedication of the Harry A. Blackmun Rotunda at the St. Louis federal courthouse, mentioning that Blackmun drove a blue Volkswagen Beetle and would tell fast food patrons that he was &quot;Harry. I work for the government.&quot;

Blackmun and Justice Potter Stewart both followed baseball obsessively. In one oral argument on October 10, 1973, Stewart passed Blackmun a note that read, &quot;V.P. AGNEW JUST RESIGNED!! METS 2 REDS 0.&quot; The game in question was the fifth and deciding game of the 1973 National League Championship Series, and the Mets won it 7–2, sending them to the 1973 World Series.

== Post-Supreme Court ==
Blackmun announced his retirement from the Supreme Court in April 1994, four months before he officially left the bench, assuming retired status on August 3, 1994. By then, he had become the court&#x27;s most liberal justice. In his place, President Bill Clinton nominated Stephen Breyer, whom the Senate confirmed, 87–9.

In 1995, Blackmun received the United States Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

In 1997, Blackmun portrayed Justice Joseph Story in the Steven Spielberg film &quot;Amistad&quot;, making him the only United States Supreme Court justice to play a judge in a motion picture.

On February 22, 1999, Blackmun fell in his home and broke his hip. The next day, he underwent hip replacement surgery at Arlington Hospital in Arlington, Virginia, but he never fully recovered. Ten days later, on March 4, at the age of 90, he died at 1:00 A.M. from complications from the procedure. He lay in repose in the Great Hall of the United States Supreme Court Building, and was buried five days later at Arlington National Cemetery. His wife died seven years later on July 13, 2006, at the age of 95, and was buried next to him.
In 2004 the Library of Congress released Blackmun&#x27;s voluminous files. He had kept all the documents from every case, notes the justices passed between themselves, 10% of the mail he received, and numerous other documents. After Blackmun announced his retirement from the Court, he recorded a 38-hour oral history with one of his former law clerks, former Yale Law School dean Harold Koh, which was also released. In it, he discusses his thoughts on everything from his important Court cases to the Supreme Court piano, though some Supreme Court experts such as David Garrow have cast doubt on the accuracy of some of Blackmun&#x27;s recollections, especially his thoughts on the Court&#x27;s deliberations on &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.

Based on these papers, Linda Greenhouse of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;Becoming Justice Blackmun: Harry Blackmun&#x27;s Supreme Court Journey&quot;. Jan Crawford&#x27;s &quot;Supreme Conflict&quot; also draws heavily from the papers.

<text>Baroque architecture is a highly decorative and theatrical style which appeared in Italy in the late 16th century and gradually spread across Europe. It was originally introduced by the Catholic Church, particularly by the Jesuits, as a means to combat the Reformation and the Protestant church with a new architecture that inspired surprise and awe. It reached its peak in the High Baroque (1625–1675), when it was used in churches and palaces in Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Bavaria and Austria. In the Late Baroque period (1675–1750), it reached as far as Russia, the Ottoman Empire and the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in Latin America. In about 1730, an even more elaborately decorative variant called Rococo appeared and flourished in Central Europe.

Baroque architects took the basic elements of Renaissance architecture, including domes and colonnades, and made them higher, grander, more decorated, and more dramatic. The interior effects were often achieved with the use of &quot;quadratura&quot; (i.e. &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; painting combined with sculpture): the eye is drawn upward, giving the illusion that one is looking into the heavens. Clusters of sculpted angels and painted figures crowd the ceiling. Light was also used for dramatic effect; it streamed down from cupolas, and was reflected from an abundance of gilding. Twisted columns were also often used, to give an illusion of upwards motion, and cartouches and other decorative elements occupied every available space. In Baroque palaces, grand stairways became a central element.

The Early Baroque (1584–1625) was largely dominated by the work of Roman architects, notably the Church of the Gesù by Giacomo della Porta (consecrated 1584) façade and colonnade of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica by Carlo Maderno (completed 1612) and the lavish Barberini Palace interiors by Pietro da Cortona (1633–1639), and Santa Susanna (1603), by Carlo Maderno. In France, the Luxembourg Palace (1615–45) built by Salomon de Brosse for Marie de&#x27; Medici was an early example of the style.

The High Baroque (1625–1675) produced major works in Rome by Pietro da Cortona, including the (Church of Santi Luca e Martina) (1635–50); by Francesco Borromini (San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane (1634–1646)); and by Gian Lorenzo Bernini (The colonnade of St. Peter&#x27;s Square) (1656–57). In Venice, High Baroque works included Santa Maria della Salute by Baldassare Longhena. Examples in France included the Pavillon de l’Horloge of the Louvre Palace by Jacques Lemercier (1624–1645), the Chapel of the Sorbonne by Jacques Lemercier (1626–35) and the Château de Maisons by François Mansart (1630–1651).

The Late Baroque (1675–1750) saw the style spread to all parts of Europe, and to the colonies of Spain and Portugal in the New World. National styles became more varied and distinct. The Late Baroque in France, under Louis XIV, was more ordered and classical; examples included the Hall of Mirrors of the Palace of Versailles and the dome of . An especially ornate variant, appeared in the early 18th century; it was first called Rocaille in France; then Rococo in Spain and Central Europe. The sculpted and painted decoration covered every space on the walls and ceiling. Its most celebrated architect was Balthasar Neumann, noted for the Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers and the Würzburg Residence (1749–51).

== History ==
=== Early Baroque (1584–1625) ===

Baroque architecture first appeared in the late 16th and early 17th century in religious architecture in Rome as a means to counter the popular appeal of the Protestant Reformation. It was a reaction against the more severe and academic earlier style of earlier churches, it aimed to inspire the common people with the effects of surprise, emotion and awe. To achieve this, it used a combination of contrast, movement, &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; and other dramatic and theatrical effects, such as &quot;quadratura&quot;the use of painted ceilings that gave the illusion that one was looking up directly at the sky. The new style was particularly favored by the new religious orders, including the Theatines and the Jesuits, who built new churches designed to attract and inspire a wide popular audience.

====Rome====
One of the first Baroque architects, Carlo Maderno, used Baroque effects of space and perspective in the new façade and colonnade of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica, which was designed to contrast with and complement the gigantic dome built earlier by Michelangelo. Other influential early examples in Rome included the Church of the Gesù by Giacomo della Porta (consecrated 1584), with the first Baroque façade and a highly ornate interior, and Santa Susanna (1603), by Carlo Maderno.

====Paris====
The Jesuits soon imported the style to Paris. The Church of St-Gervais-et-St-Protais in Paris (1615–1621) had the first Baroque façade in France, featuring, like the Italian Baroque façades, the three superimposed classical orders. The Italian style of palaces was also imported to Paris by Marie de&#x27; Medici for her new residence, the Luxembourg Palace (1615–1624) by architect Salomon de Brosse, and for a new wing of the Château of Blois by François Mansard (1635–38). Nicolas Fouquet, the superintendent of finances for the young King Louis XIV, chose the new style for his château at Vaux-le-Vicomte (1612–1670) by Louis Le Vau. He was later imprisoned by the King because of the extravagant cost of the palace.

====Southern Netherlands====

In the Southern Netherlands, the Baroque architecture was introduced by the Catholic Church in the context of the Counter-Reformation and the Eighty Years&#x27; War. After the separation of the Netherlands Baroque churches were set up across the country. One of the first architects was Wenceslas Cobergher (1560-1634), who built the Basilica of Our Lady of Scherpenheuvel from 1609 until 1627 and the Church of Saint Augustine, Antwerp. Other churches are for example the St. Charles Borromeo Church, Antwerp (1615-1621) and the St. Walburga Church (Bruges) (1619-1641), both built by Pieter Huyssens. Later, secular buildings, such as the Guildhalls on the Grand-Place in Brussels and several Belfries, were constructed too.

====Central Europe====
The first example of early Baroque in Central Europe was the Corpus Christi Church, Nesvizh in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, built by the Jesuits on the Roman model between 1586 and 1593 in Nieśwież (after 1945 Niasvizh in Belarus). The church also holds a distinction of being the first domed basilica with a Baroque façade in the Commonwealth and Eastern Europe.
Another early example in Poland is the Church of Saints Peter and Paul Church, Kraków, built between 1597 and 1619 by the Italian Jesuit architect Giovanni Maria Bernardoni.

===High Baroque (1625–1675)===
====Italy====

Pope Urban VIII, who occupied the Papacy from 1623 to 1644, became the most influential patron of the Baroque style. After the death of Carlo Maderno in 1629, Urban named the architect and sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini as the chief Papal architect. Bernini created not only Baroque buildings, but also Baroque interiors, squares and fountains, transforming the center of Rome into an enormous theater. Bernini rebuilt the Church of Santa Bibiana and the Church of San Sebastiano al Palatino on the Palatine Hill into Baroque landmarks, planned the Fontana del Tritone in the Piazza Barberini, and created the soaring baldacchino as the centerpiece of St Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

The High Baroque spread gradually across Italy, beyond Rome. The period saw the construction of Santa Maria della Salute by Baldassare Longhena in Venice (1630–31). Churches were not the only buildings to use the Baroque style. One of the finest monuments of the early Baroque is the Barberini Palace (1626–1629), the residence of the family of Urban VIII, begun by Carlo Maderno, and completed and decorated by Bernini and Francesco Borromini. The outside of the Pope&#x27;s family residence, was relatively restrained, but the interiors, and especially the immense fresco on the ceiling of the salon, the &quot;Allegory of Divine Providence and Barberini Power&quot; painted by Pietro da Cortona, are considered masterpieces of Baroque art and decoration. Curving façades and the illusion of movement were a speciality of Francesco Borromini, most notably in San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane (1634–1646), one of the landmarks of the high Baroque. Another important monument of the period was the Church of Santi Luca e Martina in Rome by Pietro da Cortona (1635–50), in the form of a Greek cross with an elegant dome. After the death or Urban VIII and the brief reign of his successor, the Papacy of Pope Alexander VII from 1666 until 1667 saw more construction of Baroque churches, squares and fountains in Rome by Carlo Rainaldi, Bernini and Carlo Fontana.

====France====

King Louis XIII had sent the architect Jacques Lemercier to Rome between 1607 and 1614 to study the new style. On his return to France, he designed the Pavillon de l’Horloge of the Louvre Palace (beginning 1626), and, more importantly, the Sorbonne Chapel, the first church dome in Paris. It was designed in 1626, and construction began in 1635. The next important French Baroque project was a much larger dome for the church of Val-de-Grâce begun in 1645 by Lemercier and François Mansart, and finished in 1715. A third Baroque dome was soon added for the Collège des Quatre-Nations (now the ).

In 1661, following the death of Cardinal Mazarin, the young Louis XIV took direct charge of the government. The arts were put under the direction of his Controller-General of Finances, Jean-Baptiste Colbert. Charles Le Brun, director of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, was named Superintendent of Buildings of the King, in charge of all royal architectural projects. The Académie royale d&#x27;architecture was founded in 1671, with the mission of making Paris, not Rome, the artistic and architectural model for the world.

The first architectural project of Louis XIV was a proposed reconstruction of the façade of the east wing of the Louvre Palace. Bernini, then Europe&#x27;s most famous architect, was summoned to Paris to submit a design. Beginning in 1664, Bernini proposed several Baroque variants, but in the end the King selected a design by a French architect, Charles Perrault, in a more classical variant of Baroque. This gradually became the Louis XIV style. Louis was soon engaged in an even larger project, the construction of the new Palace of Versailles. The architects chosen were Louis Le Vau and Jules Hardouin-Mansart, and the façades of the new palace were constructed around the earlier Marble Court between 1668 and 1678. The Baroque grandeur of Versailles, particularly the façade facing the garden and the Hall of Mirrors by Jules Hardouin-Mansart, became models for other palaces across Europe.

=== Late Baroque (1675–1750) ===

During the period of the Late Baroque (1675–1750), the style appeared across Europe, from England and France to Central Europe and Russia, from Spain and Portugal to Scandinavia, and in the colonies of Spain and Portugal in the New World and the Philippines. It often took different names, and the regional variations became more distinct. A particularly ornate variant appeared in the early 18th century, called Rocaille in France and Rococo in Spain and Central Europe. The sculpted and painted decoration covering every space on the walls and ceiling. The most prominent architects of this style included Balthasar Neumann, noted for the Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers and the Wurzburg Residence (1749–51). These works were among the final expressions of the Rococo or the Late Baroque.

==== Italy ====
By the early 18th century, Baroque buildings could be found in all parts of Italy, often with regional variations. Notable examples included the Basilica of Superga, overlooking Turin, by Filippo Juvarra (1717–1731), which was later used as model for the Panthéon in Paris. The Stupinigi Palace (1729–31) was a hunting lodge and one of the Residences of the Royal House of Savoy near Turin. It was also built Filippo Juvarra.

====France====


The Late Baroque period in France saw the evolving decoration of the Palace of Versailles, including the Hall of Mirrors and the Chapel. Later in the period, during the reign of Louis XV, a new, more ornate variant, the Rocaille style, or French Rococo, appeared in Paris and flourished between about 1723 and 1759. The most prominent example was the salon of the Princess in Hôtel de Soubise in Paris, designed by Germain Boffrand and Charles-Joseph Natoire (1735–40).

====England====

Christopher Wren was the leading figure of the late Baroque in England, with his reconstruction of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral (1675–1711) inspired by the model of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome, his plan for Greenwich Hospital (begun 1695), and Hampton Court Palace (1690–96). Other British figures of the late Baroque included Inigo Jones for Wilton House (1632–1647 and two pupils of Wren, John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor, for Castle Howard (1699–1712) and Blenheim Palace (1705–1724).

====Lithuania====

In the 17th century Late Baroque style buildings in Lithuania were built in an Italian Baroque style, however in the first half of the 18th century a distinctive Vilnian Baroque architectural style of the Late Baroque was formed in capital Vilnius (in which architecture was taught at Vilnius Jesuit Academy, Jesuits colleges, Dominican schools) and spread throughout Lithuania. The most distinctive features of churches built in the Vilnian Baroque style are very tall and slender towers of the main façades with differently decorated compartments, undulation of cornices and walls, decorativeness in bright colors, and multi-colored marble and stucco altars in the interiors. The Lithuanian nobility funded renovations and constructions of Late Baroque churches, monasteries (e.g. Pažaislis Monastery) and their personal palaces (e.g. Sapieha Palace, Slushko Palace, Minor Radvilos Palace).

Notable architects who built buildings in a Late Baroque style in Lithuania are Johann Christoph Glaubitz, Thomas Zebrowski, Pietro Perti (cooperated with painters Michelangelo Palloni, Giovanni Maria Galli), Giambattista Frediani, Pietro Puttini, Carlo Puttini, Jan Zaor, G. Lenkiewicz, Abraham Würtzner, Jan Valentinus Tobias Dyderszteyn, P. I. Hofer, , etc.
====Central Europe====
Many of the most extraordinary buildings of the Late Baroque were constructed in Austria, Germany, and Czechia. In Austria, the leading figure was Fischer von Erlach, who built the Karlskirche, the largest church of Vienna, to glorify the Habsburg emperors. These works sometimes borrowed elements from Versailles combined with elements of the Italian Baroque to create grandiose new effects, as in the Schwarzenberg Palace (1715). Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt used grand stairways and ellipses to achieve his effects at the upper and lower Belvedere Palace in Vienna (1714–1722). In The Abbey of Melk, Jakob Prandtauer used an abundance of polychrome marble and stucco, statuary and ceiling paintings to achieve harmonious and highly theatrical effects.

Another important figure of German Baroque was Balthasar Neumann (1687–1753), whose works included the Würzburg Residence for the Prince-Bishops of Würzburg, with its famous staircase.

In Bohemia, the leading Baroque architect was Christoph Dientzenhofer, whose building featured complex curves and counter-curves and elliptical forms, making Prague, like Vienna, a capital of the late Baroque.
====Spain====

Political and economic crises in the 17th century largely delayed the arrival of the Baroque in Spain until the late period, though the Jesuits strongly promoted it. Its early characteristics were a lavish exterior contrasting with a relatively simple interior and multiple spaces. They carefully planned lighting in the interior to give an impression of mystery. Early 18th century, Notable Spanish examples included the new west façade of Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, (1738–50), with its spectacular towers, by Fernando de Casas Novoa. In Seville, Leonardo de Figueroa was the creator of the Palacio de San Telmo, with a façade inspired by the Italian Baroque. The most ornate works of the Spanish Baroque were made by Jose Benito de Churriguera in Madrid and Salamanca. In his work, the buildings are nearly overwhelmed by the ornament of gilded wood, gigantic twisting columns, and sculpted vegetation. His two brothers, Joaquin and Alberto, also made important, if less ornamented, contributions to what became known simply as the Churrigueresque style.

====Latin America and North America====

The Baroque style was imported into Latin America in the 17th century by the Spanish and the Portuguese, particularly by the Jesuits for the construction of churches. The style was sometimes called Churrigueresque, after the family of Baroque architects in Salamanca. A particularly fine example is Zacatecas Cathedral in Zacatecas City, in north-central Mexico, with its lavishly sculpted façade and twin bell towers. Another important example is San Cristobal de las Casas in Mexico. A notable example in Brazil is the São Bento Monastery in Rio de Janeiro. begun in 1617, with additional decoration after 1668. The Metropolitan Tabernacle the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral, to the right of the main cathedral, built by Lorenzo Rodríguez between 1749 and 1760, to house the archives and vestments of the archbishop, and to receive visitors.

Portuguese colonial architecture was modeled after the architecture of Lisbon, different from the Spanish style. The most notable architect in Brazil was Aleijadinho, who was native of Brazil, half-Portuguese, and self-taught. His most famous work is the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi (Ouro Preto).
==Characteristics==
Baroque architecture often used visual and theatrical effects, designed to surprise and awe the viewer:
* domes were a common feature. Their interiors were often painted with a sky filled with angels and sculpted sunbeams, suggesting glory or a vision of heaven. Pear-shaped domes were sometimes used in the Bavarian, Czech, Polish and Ukrainian Baroque
* quadratura. Paintings in &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; of angels and saints in the dome and on the ceiling, combined with stucco frames or decoration, which give the illusion of three dimensions, and of looking through the ceiling to the heavens. Sometimes painted or sculpted figures of Atlantes appear to be holding up the ceiling. In some Baroque churches, illusionistic ceiling painting gave the illusion of three dimensions.
* grand stairways. Stairways often occupied a central place and were used for dramatic effect. winding upwards in stages, giving changing views from different levels, serving as a setting for ceremonies.
* cartouche in elaborate forms and sculpted frames break up the surfaces and add three-dimensional effects to the walls.
* mirrors to give the impression of depth and greater space, particularly when combined with windows, as in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles.
* incomplete architectural elements, such as frontons with sections missing, causing sections to merge and disorienting the eye.
* chiaroscuro. Use of strong contrasts of darkness and light for dramatic effect.
* overhead sculpture. Putti or figures on or just below the ceiling, made of wood (often gilded), plaster or stucco, marble or faux finishing, giving the impression of floating in the air.
* Solomonic columns, which gave an illusion of motion.
* elliptical or oval spaces, eliminating right angles. Sometimes an oval nave was surrounded by radiating circular chapels. This was a distinctive feature of the Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers of Balthasar Neumann.

<text>An audio frequency or audible frequency (AF) is a periodic vibration whose frequency is audible to the average human. The SI unit of frequency is the hertz (Hz). It is the property of sound that most determines pitch.

The generally accepted standard hearing range for humans is 20 to 20,000 Hz. In air at atmospheric pressure, these represent sound waves with wavelengths of to . Frequencies below 20 Hz are generally felt rather than heard, assuming the amplitude of the vibration is great enough. Sound frequencies above 20 kHz are called ultrasonic.

Sound propagates as mechanical vibration waves of pressure and displacement, in air or other substances. In general, frequency components of a sound determine its &quot;color&quot;, its timbre. When speaking about the frequency (in singular) of a sound, it means the property that most determines its pitch. Higher pitches have higher frequency, and lower pitches are lower frequency. 

The frequencies an ear can hear are limited to a specific range of frequencies. The audible frequency range for humans is typically given as being between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz (20 kHz), though the high frequency limit usually reduces with age. Other species have different hearing ranges. For example, some dog breeds can perceive vibrations up to 60,000 Hz. 

In many media, such as air, the speed of sound is approximately independent of frequency, so the wavelength of the sound waves (distance between repetitions) is approximately inversely proportional to frequency.

<doc id="344148" wikidata="Q784975" url="?curid=344148" title="History of English">
<text>English is a West Germanic language that originated from Ingvaeonic languages brought to Britain in the mid-5th to 7th centuries AD by Anglo-Saxon migrants from what is now northwest Germany, southern Denmark and the Netherlands. The Anglo-Saxons settled in the British Isles from the mid-5th century and came to dominate the bulk of southern Great Britain. Their language originated as a group of Ingvaeonic languages which were spoken by the settlers in England and southern and eastern Scotland in the early Middle Ages, displacing the Celtic languages, and, possibly, British Latin, that had previously been dominant. Old English reflected the varied origins of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms established in different parts of Britain. The Late West Saxon dialect eventually became dominant. A significant subsequent influence upon the shaping of Old English came from contact with the North Germanic languages spoken by the Scandinavian Vikings who conquered and colonized parts of Britain during the 8th and 9th centuries, which led to much lexical borrowing and grammatical simplification. The Anglian dialects had a greater influence on Middle English.

After the Norman conquest in 1066, Old English was replaced, for a time, by Anglo-Norman, also known as Anglo-Norman French, as the language of the upper classes. This is regarded as marking the end of the Old English or Anglo-Saxon era, as during this period the English language was heavily influenced by Anglo-Norman, developing into a phase known now as Middle English. The conquering Normans spoke a Romance langue d&#x27;oïl called Old Norman, which in Britain developed into Anglo-Norman. Many Norman and French loanwords entered the local language in this period, especially in vocabulary related to the church, the court system and the government. As Normans are descendants of Vikings who invaded France, Norman French was influenced by Old Norse, and many Norse loanwords in English came directly from French. Middle English was spoken to the late 15th century. The system of orthography that was established during the Middle English period is largely still in use today. Later changes in pronunciation, combined with the adoption of various foreign spellings, mean that the spelling of modern English words appears highly irregular.

Early Modern English – the language used by William Shakespeare – is dated from around 1500. It incorporated many Renaissance-era loans from Latin and Ancient Greek, as well as borrowings from other European languages, including French, German and Dutch. Significant pronunciation changes in this period included the Great Vowel Shift, which affected the qualities of most long vowels. Modern English proper, similar in most respects to that spoken today, was in place by the late 17th century.

English as we know it today was exported to other parts of the world through British colonisation, and is now the dominant language in Britain and Ireland, the United States and Canada, Australia, New Zealand and many smaller former colonies, as well as being widely spoken in India, parts of Africa, and elsewhere. Partially due to influence of the United States and its globalized efforts of commerce and technology, English took on the status of a global lingua franca in the second half of the 20th century. This is especially true in Europe, where English has largely taken over the former roles of French and, much earlier, Latin as a common language used to conduct business and diplomacy, share scientific and technological information, and otherwise communicate across national boundaries. The efforts of English-speaking Christian missionaries have resulted in English becoming a second language for many other groups.

Global variation among different English dialects and accents remains significant today.

==Proto-English==

English has its roots in the languages of the Germanic peoples of northern Europe. During the Roman Empire, most of the Germanic-inhabited area, Germania, remained independent from Rome, although some southwestern parts were within the empire. Some Germanics served in the Roman military, and troops from Germanic tribes such as the Tungri, Batavi, Menapii and Frisii served in Britain (Britannia) under Roman command. Germanic settlement and power expanded during the Migration Period, which saw the fall of the Western Roman Empire. A Germanic settlement of Britain took place from the 5th to the 7th century, following the end of Roman rule on the island. 

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; relates that around the year 449 Vortigern, king of the Britons, invited the &quot;Angle kin&quot;, Angles allegedly led by the Germanic brothers Hengist and Horsa, to help repel invading Picts, in return for lands in the southeast of Britain. This led to waves of settlers who eventually established seven kingdoms, known as the heptarchy. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; was not a contemporaneous work, however, and cannot be regarded as an accurate record of such early events. Bede, who wrote his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; in AD 731, writes of invasion by Angles, Saxons and Jutes, although the precise nature of the invasion and settlement and the contributions made by these particular groups are the subject of much dispute among historians.

The languages spoken by the Germanic peoples who initially settled in Britain were part of the West Germanic branch of the Germanic language family. They consisted of dialects from the Ingvaeonic grouping, spoken mainly around the North Sea coast, in regions that lie within modern Denmark, north-west Germany and the Netherlands. Due to specific similarities between early English and Old Frisian, an Anglo-Frisian grouping is also identified, although it does not necessarily represent a node in the family tree.

These dialects had most of the typical West Germanic features, including a significant amount of grammatical inflection. Vocabulary came largely from the core Germanic stock, although due to the Germanic peoples&#x27; extensive contacts with the Roman world, the settlers&#x27; languages already included a number of loanwords from Latin. For instance, the predecessor of Modern English &quot;wine&quot; had been borrowed into early Germanic from the Latin &quot;vinum&quot;.

==Old English==
The Germanic settlers in the British Isles initially spoke a number of different dialects, which developed into a language that came to be called Anglo-Saxon. It displaced the indigenous Brittonic Celtic, and the Latin of the former Roman rulers, in parts of the areas of Britain that later formed the Kingdom of England. Celtic languages remained in most of Scotland, Wales and Cornwall, and many compound Celtic-Germanic place names survive, hinting at early language mixing. Old English continued to exhibit local variation, the remnants of which continue to be found in dialects of Modern English. The four main dialects were Mercian, Northumbrian, Kentish and West Saxon. West Saxon formed the basis for the literary standard of the later Old English period. The dominant forms of Middle and Modern English developed mainly from Mercian.

Old English was first written using a runic script called the futhorc. This was replaced by a version of the Latin alphabet introduced by Irish missionaries in the 8th century. Most literary output was in either the Early West Saxon of Alfred the Great&#x27;s time, or the Late West Saxon, regarded as the &quot;classical&quot; form of Old English, of the Winchester school, inspired by Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester, and followed by such writers as the prolific Ælfric of Eynsham, &quot;the Grammarian&quot;. The most famous surviving work from the Old English period is the epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, composed by an unknown poet.

The introduction of Christianity from around the year 600 encouraged the addition of over 400 Latin loan words into Old English, such as the predecessors of the modern &quot;priest&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, and &quot;school&quot;, and a smaller number of Greek loan words. The speech of eastern and northern parts of England was also subject to strong Old Norse influence due to Scandinavian rule and settlement beginning in the 9th century (see below).

Most native English speakers today find Old English unintelligible, even though about half of the most commonly used words in Modern English have Old English roots. The grammar of Old English was much more inflected than modern English, combined with freer word order, and was grammatically quite similar in some respects to modern German. The language had demonstrative pronouns, equivalent to &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot;, but did not have the definite article &quot;the&quot;. The Old English period is considered to have evolved into the Middle English period some time after the Norman conquest of 1066, when the language came to be influenced significantly by the new ruling class&#x27;s language, Old Norman.

===Scandinavian influence===

Vikings from modern-day Norway and Denmark began to raid parts of Britain from the late 8th century onward. In 865, a major invasion was launched by what the Anglo-Saxons called the Great Heathen Army, which eventually brought large parts of northern and eastern England, the Danelaw, under Scandinavian control. Most of these areas were retaken by the English under Edward the Elder in the early 10th century, although York and Northumbria were not permanently regained until the death of Eric Bloodaxe in 954. Scandinavian raids resumed in the late 10th century during the reign of Æthelred the Unready. Sweyn Forkbeard was briefly declared king of England in 1013, followed by the longer reign of his son Cnut from 1016 to 1035, and Cnut&#x27;s sons Harold Harefoot and Harthacnut, until 1042.

The Scandinavians, or Norsemen, spoke dialects of a North Germanic language known as Old Norse. The Anglo-Saxons and the Scandinavians thus spoke related languages from different branches (West and North) of the Germanic family. Many of their lexical roots were the same or similar, although their grammatical systems were more divergent. It is likely that significant numbers of Norse speakers settled in the Danelaw during the period of Scandinavian control. Many place-names in those areas are of Scandinavian provenance, those ending in &quot;-by&quot;, for example. It is believed that the settlers often established new communities in places that had not previously been developed by the Anglo-Saxons. The extensive contact between Old English and Old Norse speakers, including the possibility of intermarriage that resulted from the acceptance of Christianity by the Danes in 878, undoubtedly influenced the varieties of those languages spoken in the areas of contact. 

During the rule of Cnut and other Danish kings in the first half of the 11th century, a kind of diglossia may have come about, with the West Saxon literary language existing alongside the Norse-influenced Midland dialect of English, which could have served as a koine or spoken lingua franca. When Danish rule ended, and particularly after the Norman Conquest, the status of the minority Norse language presumably declined relative to that of English, and its remaining speakers assimilated to English in a process involving language shift and language death. The widespread bilingualism that must have existed during the process possibly contributed to the rate of borrowings from Norse into English.

Only about 100 or 150 Norse words, mainly connected with government and administration, are found in Old English writing. The borrowing of words of this type was stimulated by Scandinavian rule in the Danelaw and during the later reign of Cnut. Most surviving Old English texts are based on the West Saxon standard that developed outside the Danelaw. It is not clear to what extent Norse influenced the forms of the language spoken in eastern and northern England at that time. Later texts from the Middle English era, now based on an eastern Midland rather than a Wessex standard, reflect the significant impact that Norse had on the language. In all, English borrowed about 2,000 words from Old Norse, several hundred surviving in Modern English.

Norse borrowings include many very common words, such as &quot;anger&quot;, &quot;bag&quot;, &quot;both&quot;, &quot;hit&quot;, &quot;law&quot;, &quot;leg&quot;, &quot;same&quot;, &quot;skill&quot;, &quot;sky&quot;, &quot;take&quot;, &quot;window&quot;, and even the pronoun &quot;they&quot;. Norse influence is also believed to have reinforced the adoption of the plural copular verb form &quot;are&quot; rather, than alternative Old English forms like &quot;sind&quot;. It is considered to have stimulated and accelerated the morphological simplification found in Middle English, such as the loss of grammatical gender and explicitly marked case, except in pronouns. That is possibly confirmed by observations that simplification of the case endings occurred earliest in the north, and latest in the southwest. The spread of phrasal verbs in English is another grammatical development to which Norse may have contributed, although here a possible Celtic influence is also noted.

Some scholars have claimed that Old English died out entirely and was replaced by Norse towards the end of the Old English period and as part of the transition to Middle English, by virtue of the Middle English syntax being much more akin to Norse than Old English. Other scholars reject this claim.

==Middle English==

Middle English is the form of English spoken roughly from the time of the Norman Conquest in 1066 until the end of the 15th century.

For centuries after the Conquest, the Norman kings and high-ranking nobles in England and to some extent elsewhere in the British Isles spoke Anglo-Norman, a variety of Old Norman, originating from a northern langue d&#x27;oïl dialect. Merchants and lower-ranked nobles were often bilingual in Anglo-Norman and English, whilst English continued to be the language of the common people. Middle English was influenced by both Anglo-Norman, and later Anglo-French. See characteristics of the Anglo-Norman language.
Until the 14th century, Anglo-Norman and then French were the language of the courts and government. Even after the decline of Norman, standard French retained the status of a formal or prestige language. About 10,000 French and Norman loan words entered Middle English, particularly terms associated with government, church, law, the military, fashion, and food. See English language word origins and List of English words of French origin. 

Although English is a Germanic language, it has a deep connection to Romance languages. The roots of this connection trace back to the Conquest of England by the Normans in 1066. The Normans spoke a dialect of Old French, and the comingling of Norman French and Old English resulted in Middle English, a language that reflects aspects of both Germanic and Romance languages and evolved into the English we speak today, where nearly 60% of the words are loanworded from Latin &amp; romance languages like French. 

The strong influence of Old Norse on English becomes apparent during this period. The impact of the native British Celtic languages that English continued to displace is generally held to be very small, although a few scholars have attributed some grammatical forms, such as periphrastic &quot;do&quot;, to Celtic influence. These theories have been criticized by a number of other linguists. Some scholars have also put forward hypotheses that Middle English was a kind of creole language resulting from contact between Old English and either Old Norse or Anglo-Norman.

English literature began to reappear after 1200, when a changing political climate and the decline in Anglo-Norman made it more respectable. The Provisions of Oxford, released in 1258, was the first English government document to be published in the English language after the Norman Conquest. In 1362, Edward III became the first king to address Parliament in English. The Pleading in English Act 1362 made English the only language in which court proceedings could be held, though the official record remained in Latin. By the end of the century, the royal court had switched to English. Anglo-Norman remained in use in limited circles somewhat longer, but it had ceased to be a living language. Official documents began to be produced regularly in English during the 15th century. Geoffrey Chaucer, who lived in the late 14th century, is the most famous writer from the Middle English period, and &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; is his best-known work.

The English language changed enormously during the Middle English period, in vocabulary, in pronunciation, and in grammar. While Old English is a heavily inflected language (synthetic), the use of grammatical endings diminished in Middle English (analytic). Grammar distinctions were lost as many noun and adjective endings were levelled to &quot;-e&quot;. The older plural noun marker &quot;-en&quot;, retained in a few cases such as &quot;children&quot; and &quot;oxen&quot;, largely gave way to &quot;-s&quot;. Grammatical gender was discarded. Definite article &quot;þe&quot; appears around 1200, later spelled as &quot;the&quot;, first appearing in East and North England as a substitute for Old English &quot;se&quot; and &quot;seo&quot;, nominative forms of &quot;that.&quot;

English spelling was also influenced by Norman in this period, with the and sounds being spelled &quot;th&quot;, rather than with the Old English letters þ (thorn) and ð (eth), which did not exist in Norman. These letters remain in the modern Icelandic and Faroese alphabets, having been borrowed from Old English via Old West Norse.

==Early Modern English==

English underwent extensive sound changes during the 15th century, while its spelling conventions remained largely constant. Modern English is often dated from the Great Vowel Shift, which took place mainly during the 15th century. The language was further transformed by the spread of a standardized London-based dialect in government and administration and by the standardizing effect of printing, which also tended to regularize capitalization. As a result, the language acquired self-conscious terms such as &quot;accent&quot; and &quot;dialect&quot;. As most early presses came from continental Europe, a few native English letters such as þ and ð died out. For some time &quot;þe&quot; (modern &quot;the&quot;) was written as &quot;ye.&quot; By the time of William Shakespeare (mid 16th – early 17th century), the language had become clearly recognizable as Modern English. In 1604, the first English dictionary was published, &quot;A Table Alphabeticall&quot;.

Increased literacy and travel facilitated the adoption of many foreign words, especially borrowings from Latin and Greek, often terms for abstract concepts not available in English. In the 17th century, Latin words were often used with their original inflections, but these eventually disappeared. As there are many words from different languages and English spelling is variable, the risk of mispronunciation is high, but remnants of the older forms remain in a few regional dialects, most notably in the West Country. During the period, loan words were borrowed from Italian, German, and Yiddish. British acceptance of and resistance to Americanisms began during this period.

==Modern English==
The first authoritative and full-featured English dictionary, the &quot;Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, was published by Samuel Johnson in 1755. To a high degree, the dictionary standardized both English spelling and word usage. Meanwhile, grammar texts by Lowth, Murray, Priestly, and others attempted to prescribe standard usage even further.

Early Modern English and Late Modern English, also called Present-Day English (PDE), differ essentially in vocabulary. Late Modern English has many more words, arising from the Industrial Revolution and technologies that created a need for new words, as well as international development of the language. The British Empire at its height covered one quarter of the Earth&#x27;s land surface, and the English language adopted foreign words from many countries. British English and North American English, the two major varieties of the language, are together spoken by 400 million people. The total number of English speakers worldwide may exceed one billion. There have been attempts to predict future English evolution, though they have been met with skepticism.

==Phonological changes==

===Introduction===
Over the last 1,200 years or so, English has undergone extensive changes in its vowel system, but many fewer changes to its consonants.

In the Old English period, a number of umlaut processes affected vowels in complex ways. Unstressed vowels were gradually eroded, eventually leading to a loss of grammatical case and grammatical gender in the Early Middle English period. The most important umlaut process was *i-mutation, c. 500 CE, which led to pervasive alternations of all sorts, many of which survive in the modern language: e.g. in noun paradigms (&quot;foot&quot; vs. &quot;feet&quot;, &quot;mouse&quot; vs. &quot;mice&quot;, &quot;brother&quot; vs. &quot;brethren&quot;); in verb paradigms (&quot;sold&quot; vs. &quot;sell&quot;); nominal derivatives from adjectives (&quot;strong&quot; vs. &quot;strength&quot;, &quot;broad&quot; vs. &quot;breadth&quot;, &quot;foul&quot; vs. &quot;filth&quot;) and from other nouns (&quot;fox&quot; vs. &quot;vixen&quot;); verbal derivatives (&quot;food&quot; vs. &quot;to feed&quot;); and comparative adjectives (&quot;old&quot; vs. &quot;elder&quot;). Consonants were more stable, although velar consonants were significantly modified by palatalization, which produced alternations such as &quot;speak&quot; vs. &quot;speech&quot;, &quot;drink&quot; vs. &quot;drench&quot;, &quot;wake&quot; vs. &quot;watch&quot;, &quot;bake&quot; vs. &quot;batch&quot;.

The Middle English period saw further vowel changes. Most significant was the Great Vowel Shift, c. 1500 CE, which transformed the pronunciation of all long vowels. This occurred after the spelling system was fixed, and accounts for the drastic differences in pronunciation between &quot;short&quot; &quot;mat, met, bit, cot&quot; vs. &quot;long&quot; &quot;mate, mete/meet, bite, coat&quot;. Other changes that left echoes in the modern language were homorganic lengthening before &quot;ld&quot;, &quot;mb&quot;, &quot;nd&quot;, which accounts for the long vowels in &quot;child&quot;, &quot;mind&quot;, &quot;climb&quot;, etc.; pre-cluster shortening, which resulted in the vowel alternations in &quot;child&quot; vs. &quot;children&quot;, &quot;keep&quot; vs. &quot;kept&quot;, &quot;meet&quot; vs. &quot;met&quot;; and trisyllabic laxing, which is responsible for alternations such as &quot;grateful&quot; vs. &quot;gratitude&quot;, &quot;divine&quot; vs. &quot;divinity&quot;, &quot;sole&quot; vs. &quot;solitary&quot;.

Among the more significant recent changes to the language have been the development of rhotic and non-rhotic accents (i.e. &quot;r-dropping&quot;) and the trap-bath split in many dialects of British English.

===Vowel changes===
The following table shows the principal developments in the stressed vowels, from Old English through Modern English. &quot;C&quot; indicates any consonant:

The following chart shows the primary developments of English vowels in the last 600 years, in more detail, since Late Middle English of Chaucer&#x27;s time. The Great Vowel Shift can be seen in the dramatic developments from to 1600.

Neither of the above tables covers the history of Middle English diphthongs, the changes before /r/, or various special cases and exceptions. For details, see phonological history of English as well as the articles on Old English phonology and Middle English phonology.

===Examples===
The vowel changes over time can be seen in the following example words, showing the changes in their form over the last 2,000 years:

==Grammatical changes==
The English language once had an extensive declension system similar to Latin, Greek, modern German and Icelandic. Old English distinguished among the nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive cases, and for strongly declined adjectives and some pronouns also a separate instrumental case (which otherwise and later completely coincided with the dative). The dual number was distinguished from the singular and plural.
Declension was greatly simplified during the Middle English period, when the accusative and dative cases of the pronouns merged into a single oblique case, that also replaced the genitive case after prepositions. Nouns in Modern English no longer decline for case, except for the genitive.

===Evolution of English pronouns===
Pronouns such as &quot;whom&quot; and &quot;him&quot;, contrasted with &quot;who&quot; and &quot;he&quot;, are a conflation of the old accusative and dative cases, as well as of the genitive case after prepositions, while &quot;her&quot; also includes the genitive case. This conflated form is called the &quot;oblique case&quot; or the &quot;object (objective) case&quot;, because it is used for objects of verbs (direct, indirect, or oblique) as well as for objects of prepositions. See object pronoun. The information formerly conveyed by distinct case forms is now mostly provided by prepositions and word order. In Old English as well as modern German and Icelandic as further examples, these cases had distinct forms.

Although some grammarians continue to use the traditional terms &quot;accusative&quot; and &quot;dative&quot;, these are functions rather than morphological cases in Modern English. That is, the form &quot;whom&quot; may play accusative or dative roles, as well as instrumental or prepositional roles, but it is a single morphological form, contrasting with nominative &quot;who&quot; and genitive &quot;whose&quot;. Many grammarians use the labels &quot;subjective&quot;, &quot;objective&quot;, and &quot;possessive&quot; for nominative, oblique, and genitive pronouns.

Modern English nouns exhibit only one inflection of the reference form: the possessive case, which some linguists argue is not a case at all, but a clitic. See the entry for genitive case for more information.

==Examples==
===&quot;Beowulf&quot;===
&quot;Beowulf&quot; is an Old English epic poem in alliterative verse. It is dated from the 8th to the early 11th centuries. These are the first 11 lines:

Which, as translated by Francis Barton Gummere, reads:
&lt;poem&gt;
Lo, praise of the prowess of people-kings
of spear-armed Danes, in days long sped,
we have heard, and what honor the athelings won!
Oft Scyld the Scefing from squadroned foes,
from many a tribe, the mead-bench tore,
awing the earls. Since erst he lay
friendless, a foundling, fate repaid him:
for he waxed under welkin, in wealth he throve,
till before him the folk, both far and near,
who house by the whale-path, heard his mandate,
gave him gifts: a good king he!
&lt;/poem&gt;
===&quot;Voyages of Ohthere and Wulfstan&quot;===
This is the beginning of &quot;The Voyages of Ohthere and Wulfstan&quot;, a prose text in Old English dated to the late 9th century. The full text can be found at .

===&quot;Ayenbite of Inwyt&quot;===
From &quot;Ayenbite of Inwyt&quot; (&quot;the prick of conscience&quot;), a translation of a French confessional prose work into the Kentish dialect of Middle English, completed in 1340:
&lt;poem&gt;
Nou wille þet ye hou is 
þet þis boc is Engliss of Kent.
Þis boc is vor men
Vor vader and vor moder and vor oþer 
 vor to vram alle manyere 
þet ine ne no voul .
&#x27; ase god&#x27; in his name ,
Þet þis boc made god him þet bread,
Of angles of hevene, and þerto his ,
And his þet he is . Amen.
&lt;/poem&gt;
===&quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;===
The beginning of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, a collection of stories in poetry and prose written in the London dialect of Middle English by Geoffrey Chaucer, at the end of the 14th century:
&lt;poem&gt;
Whan that Aprill with his shoures 
The droghte of March hath perced to the roote,
And bathed every veyne in 
Of which vertu engendred is the ;
Whan Zephirus with his sweete breeth
Inspired hath in every and heeth
The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne
Hath in the his half cours ,
And smale maken melodye,
That slepen al the nyght with open 
(So in ),
Thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimages,
And palmeres for to seken straunge ,
To , in sondry londes;
And specially from every shires ende
Of Engelond to Caunterbury they ,
The hooly blisful martir for to seke,
That whan that they were .
&lt;/poem&gt;
===&quot;Paradise Lost&quot;===
The beginning of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, an epic poem in unrhymed iambic pentameter written in Early Modern English by John Milton, first published in 1667:
&lt;poem&gt;
Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
Sing Heav&#x27;nly Muse, that on the secret top
Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire
That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
In the Beginning how the Heav&#x27;ns and Earth
Rose out of Chaos: Or if Sion Hill
Delight thee more, and Siloa&#x27;s Brook that flow&#x27;d
Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
That with no middle flight intends to soar
Above th&#x27; Aonian Mount, while it pursues
Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
&lt;/poem&gt;
===&quot;Oliver Twist&quot;===
A selection from the novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, written by Charles Dickens in Modern English and published in 1838:
The evening arrived: the boys took their places; the master in his cook&#x27;s uniform stationed himself at the copper; his pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him; the gruel was served out, and a long grace was said over the short commons. The gruel disappeared, the boys whispered each other and winked at Oliver, while his next neighbours nudged him. Child as he was, he was desperate with hunger and reckless with misery. He rose from the table, and advancing, basin and spoon in hand, to the master, said, somewhat alarmed at his own temerity—

&quot;Please, sir, I want some more.&quot;

The master was a fat, healthy man, but he turned very pale. He gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds, and then clung for support to the copper. The assistants were paralysed with wonder, and the boys with fear.

&quot;What!&quot; said the master at length, in a faint voice.

&quot;Please, sir,&quot; replied Oliver, &quot;I want some more.&quot;

The master aimed a blow at Oliver&#x27;s head with the ladle, pinioned him in his arms, and shrieked aloud for the beadle.

<doc id="344149" wikidata="Q2499206" url="?curid=344149" title="Ulysses (poem)">
<text>&quot;Ulysses&quot; is a poem in blank verse by the Victorian poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892), written in 1833 and published in 1842 in his well-received second volume of poetry. An oft-quoted poem, it is a popular example of the dramatic monologue. Facing old age, mythical hero Ulysses describes his discontent and restlessness upon returning to his kingdom, Ithaca, after his far-ranging travels. Despite his reunion with his wife Penelope and his son Telemachus, Ulysses yearns to explore again.

The character of Ulysses (in Greek, Odysseus) has been explored widely in literature. The adventures of Odysseus were first recorded in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; (c. 800–700 BC), and Tennyson draws on Homer&#x27;s narrative in the poem. Most critics, however, find that Tennyson&#x27;s Ulysses recalls Dante&#x27;s Ulisse in his &quot;Inferno&quot; (c. 1320). In Dante&#x27;s re-telling, Ulisse is condemned to hell among the false counsellors, both for his pursuit of knowledge beyond human bounds and for creating the deception of the Trojan horse.

For much of this poem&#x27;s history, readers viewed Ulysses as resolute and heroic, admiring him for his determination &quot;To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield&quot;. The view that Tennyson intended a heroic character is supported by his statements about the poem, and by the events in his life—the death of his closest friend—that prompted him to write it. In the twentieth century, some new interpretations of &quot;Ulysses&quot; highlighted potential ironies in the poem. They argued, for example, that Ulysses wishes to selfishly abandon his kingdom and family, and they questioned more positive assessments of Ulysses&#x27; character by demonstrating how he resembles flawed protagonists in earlier literature. 

==Synopsis and structure==
As the poem begins, Ulysses has returned to his kingdom, Ithaca, having made a long journey home after fighting in the Trojan War. Confronted again by domestic life, Ulysses expresses his lack of contentment, including his indifference toward the &quot;savage race&quot; (line 4) whom he governs. Ulysses contrasts his present restlessness with his heroic past, and contemplates his old age and eventual death—&quot;Life piled on life / Were all too little, and of one to me / Little remains&quot; (24–26)—and longs for further experience and knowledge. His son Telemachus will inherit the throne that Ulysses finds burdensome. While Ulysses thinks that Telemachus will be a good king—&quot;Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere / Of common duties&quot; (39)—he seems to have lost any connection to his son—&quot;He works his work, I mine&quot; (43)—and the conventional methods of governing—&quot;by slow prudence&quot; and &quot;through soft degrees&quot; (36, 37). In the final section, Ulysses turns to his fellow mariners and calls on them to join him on another quest, making no guarantees as to their fate but attempting to conjure their heroic past:

&lt;poem&gt;
 ... Come, my friends,
 &#x27;Tis not too late to seek a newer world.
 Push off, and sitting well in order smite
 The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds
 To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
 Of all the western stars, until I die.
 It may be that the gulfs will wash us down;
 It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
 And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. 
&lt;/poem&gt;

=== Prosody ===

The speaker&#x27;s language is unelaborated but forceful, and it expresses Ulysses&#x27; conflicting moods as he searches for continuity between his past and future. There is often a marked contrast between the sentiment of Ulysses&#x27; words and the sounds that express them. For example, the poem&#x27;s insistent iambic pentameter is often interrupted by spondees (metrical feet that consist of two long syllables); such laboured language slows the poem (and in other places may cast doubt upon the reliability of Ulysses&#x27; utterances):

&lt;poem&gt;
 Yet all experience is an arch wherethro&#x27;
 Gleams that untravell&#x27;d world, whose margin fades
 For ever and for ever when I move. 
&lt;/poem&gt;

Observing their burdensome prosodic effect, the poet Matthew Arnold remarked, &quot;these three lines by themselves take up nearly as much time as a whole book of the &quot;Iliad&quot;.&quot; Many of the poem&#x27;s clauses carry over into the following line; these enjambments emphasize Ulysses&#x27; restlessness and dissatisfaction.

=== Form ===

The poem&#x27;s seventy lines of blank verse are presented as a dramatic monologue. Scholars disagree on how Ulysses&#x27; speech functions in this format; it is not necessarily clear to whom Ulysses is speaking, if anyone, and from what location. Some see the verse turning from a soliloquy to a public address, as Ulysses seems to speak to himself in the first movement, then to turn to an audience as he introduces his son, and then to relocate to the seashore where he addresses his mariners. In this interpretation, the comparatively direct and honest language of the first movement is set against the more politically minded tone of the last two movements. For example, the second paragraph (33–43) about Telemachus, in which Ulysses muses again about domestic life, is a &quot;revised version [of lines 1–5] for public consumption&quot;: a &quot;savage race&quot; is revised to a &quot;rugged people&quot;.

The ironic interpretations of &quot;Ulysses&quot; may be the result of the modern tendency to consider the narrator of a dramatic monologue as necessarily &quot;unreliable&quot;. According to critic Dwight Culler, the poem has been a victim of revisionist readings in which the reader expects to reconstruct the truth from a misleading narrator&#x27;s accidental revelations. (Compare the more obvious use of this approach in Robert Browning&#x27;s &quot;My Last Duchess&quot;.) Culler himself views &quot;Ulysses&quot; as a dialectic in which the speaker weighs the virtues of a contemplative and an active approach to life; Ulysses moves through four emotional stages that are self-revelatory, not ironic: beginning with his rejection of the barren life to which he has returned in Ithaca, he then fondly recalls his heroic past, recognizes the validity of Telemachus&#x27; method of governing, and with these thoughts plans another journey.

=== Publication history ===

Tennyson completed the poem on 20 October 1833, but it was not published until 1842, in his second collection of &quot;Poems&quot;. Unlike many of Tennyson&#x27;s other important poems, &quot;Ulysses&quot; was not revised after its publication.

Tennyson originally blocked out the poem in four paragraphs, broken before lines 6, 33 and 44. In this structure, the first and third paragraphs are thematically parallel, but may be read as interior and exterior monologues, respectively. However, the poem is often printed with the first paragraph break omitted.

==Interpretations==

===Autobiographical elements===
Tennyson penned &quot;Ulysses&quot; after the death of his close Cambridge friend, the poet Arthur Henry Hallam (1811–1833), with whom Tennyson had a strong emotional bond. The two friends had spent much time discussing poetry and philosophy, writing verse, and travelling in southern France, the Pyrenees, and Germany. Tennyson considered Hallam destined for greatness, perhaps as a statesman.

When Tennyson heard on 1 October 1833 of his friend&#x27;s death, he was living in Somersby, Lincolnshire, in cramped quarters with his mother and nine of his ten siblings. His father had died in 1831, requiring Tennyson to return home and take responsibility for the family. Tennyson&#x27;s friends were becoming increasingly concerned about his mental and physical health during this time. The family had little income, and three of Tennyson&#x27;s brothers were mentally ill. Just as Tennyson&#x27;s outlook was improving—he was adjusting to his new domestic duties, regaining contact with friends, and had published his 1832 book of poems—the news of Hallam&#x27;s death arrived. Tennyson shared his grief with his sister, Emily, who had been engaged to Hallam.

According to Victorian scholar Linda Hughes, the emotional gulf between the state of his domestic affairs and the loss of his special friendship informs the reading of &quot;Ulysses&quot;—particularly its treatment of domesticity. At one moment, Ulysses&#x27; discontent seems to mirror that of Tennyson, who would have been frustrated with managing the house in such a state of grief. At the next, Ulysses is determined to transcend his age and his environment by travelling again. It may be that Ulysses&#x27; determination to defy circumstance attracted Tennyson to the myth; he said that the poem &quot;gave my feeling about the need of going forward and braving the struggle of life&quot;. On another occasion, the poet stated, &quot;There is more about myself in &quot;Ulysses&quot;, which was written under the sense of loss and that all had gone by, but that still life must be fought out to the end. It was more written with the feeling of his loss upon me than many poems in &quot;In Memoriam&quot;.&quot; Hallam&#x27;s death influenced much of Tennyson&#x27;s poetry, including perhaps his most highly regarded work, &quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot;, begun in 1833 and completed seventeen years later.

Other critics find stylistic incongruities between the poem and its author that make &quot;Ulysses&quot; exceptional. W. W. Robson writes, &quot;Tennyson, the responsible social being, the admirably serious and &#x27;committed&#x27; individual, is uttering strenuous sentiments in the accent of Tennyson the most un-strenuous, lonely and poignant of poets.&quot; He finds that Tennyson&#x27;s two widely noted personae, the &quot;responsible social being&quot; and the melancholic poet, meet uniquely in &quot;Ulysses&quot;, yet seem not to recognize each other within the text.

===Literary context===
Tennyson adopts aspects of the Ulysses character and narrative from many sources; his treatment of Ulysses is the first modern account. The ancient Greek poet Homer introduced Ulysses (Odysseus in Greek), and many later poets took up the character, including Euripides, Horace, Dante, William Shakespeare, and Alexander Pope. Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; provides the poem&#x27;s narrative background: in its eleventh book the prophet Tiresias foretells that Ulysses will return to Ithaca after a difficult voyage, then begin a new, mysterious voyage, and later die a peaceful, &quot;unwarlike&quot; death that comes vaguely &quot;from the sea&quot;. At the conclusion of Tennyson&#x27;s poem, his Ulysses is contemplating undertaking this new voyage.

Tennyson&#x27;s character, however, is not the lover of public affairs seen in Homer&#x27;s poems. Rather, &quot;Ulisse&quot; from Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; is Tennyson&#x27;s main source for the character, which has an important effect on the poem&#x27;s interpretation. Ulisse recalls his voyage in the &quot;Inferno&quot;″s 26th canto, in which he is condemned to the Eighth Circle of false counsellors for misusing his gift of reason. Dante treats Ulisse, with his &quot;zeal …/ T&#x27;explore the world&quot;, as an evil counsellor who lusts for adventure at the expense of his family and his duties in Ithaca. Tennyson projects this zeal into Ulysses&#x27; unquenched desire for knowledge:

&lt;poem&gt;
 And this gray spirit yearning in desire
 To follow knowledge like a sinking star,
 Beyond the utmost bound of human thought. 
&lt;/poem&gt;

The poet&#x27;s intention to recall the Homeric character remains evident in certain passages. &quot;I am become a name&quot; (11) recalls an episode in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; in which Demodocus sings about Odysseus&#x27; adventures in the king&#x27;s presence, acknowledging his fame. With phrases such as &quot;There gloom the dark broad seas&quot; (45) and &quot;The deep / Moans round with many voices&quot; (55–56), Tennyson seems to be consciously invoking Homer.

Critics have also noted the influence of Shakespeare in two passages. In the early movement, the savage race &quot;That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me&quot; (5) echoes Hamlet&#x27;s soliloquy: &quot;What is a man, / If his chief good and market of his time / Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.&quot; Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;How dull it is to pause, to make an end, / To rust unburnish’d, not to shine in use!&quot; (22–23) recalls Shakespeare&#x27;s Ulysses in &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; (c. 1602):
&lt;poem&gt;
 perseverance, my dear lord,
 Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
 Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail,
 In monumental mockery.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The last movement of &quot;Ulysses&quot;, which is among the most familiar passages in English poetry of the period, presents decisive evidence of the influence of Dante. Ulysses turns his attention from himself and his kingdom and speaks of ports, seas, and his mariners. The strains of discontent and weakness in old age remain throughout the poem, but Tennyson finally leaves Ulysses &quot;To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield&quot; (70), recalling the Dantesque damnable desire for knowledge beyond all bounds. The words of Dante&#x27;s character as he exhorts his men to the journey find parallel in those of Tennyson&#x27;s Ulysses, who calls his men to join him on one last voyage. Quoting Dante&#x27;s Ulisse:

&lt;poem&gt;
 &#x27;O brothers&#x27;, said I, &#x27;who are come despite
 Ten thousand perils to the West, let none,
 While still our senses hold the vigil slight
 Remaining to us ere our course is run,
 Be willing to forgo experience
 Of the unpeopled world beyond the sun.
 Regard your origin,—from whom and whence!
 Not to exist like brutes, but made were ye
 To follow virtue and intelligence&#x27;.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Critics note, however, that in the Homeric narrative, Ulysses&#x27; original mariners are dead. A tension may therefore be found in Ulysses&#x27; speech to his sailors (&quot;Come, my friends,/ &#x27;Tis not too late to seek a newer world/ ...&quot; [56–57]). Since Dante&#x27;s Ulisse has already undertaken this voyage and recounts it in the &quot;Inferno&quot;, Ulysses&#x27; entire monologue can be envisioned as his recollection while situated in Hell.

===From affirmation to irony===

The degree to which Tennyson identifies with Ulysses has provided one of the great debates among scholars of the poem. Critics who find that Tennyson identifies with the speaker read Ulysses&#x27; speech &quot;affirmatively&quot;, or without irony. Many other interpretations of the poem have developed from the argument that Tennyson does not identify with Ulysses, and further criticism has suggested that the purported inconsistencies in Ulysses&#x27; character are the fault of the poet himself.

Key to the affirmative reading of &quot;Ulysses&quot; is the biographical context of the poem. Such a reading takes into account Tennyson&#x27;s statements about writing the poem—&quot;the need of going forward&quot;—and considers that he would not undermine Ulysses&#x27; determination with irony when he needed a similar stalwartness to face life after Hallam&#x27;s death. The passion and conviction of Tennyson&#x27;s language—and even his own comments on the poem—signify that the poet, as was typical in the Victorian age, admired courage and persistence. Read straightforwardly, &quot;Ulysses&quot; promotes the questing spirit of youth, even in old age, and a refusal to resign and face life passively. Ulysses is thus seen as a heroic character whose determination to seek &quot;some work of noble note&quot; (52) is courageous in the face of a &quot;still hearth&quot; (2) and old age.

Until the early twentieth century, readers reacted to &quot;Ulysses&quot; sympathetically. The meaning of the poem was increasingly debated as Tennyson&#x27;s stature rose. After Paull F. Baum criticized Ulysses&#x27; inconsistencies and Tennyson&#x27;s conception of the poem in 1948, the ironic interpretation became dominant. Baum finds in Ulysses echoes of Lord Byron&#x27;s flawed heroes, who similarly display conflicting emotions, self-critical introspection, and a rejection of social responsibility. Even Ulysses&#x27; resolute final utterance—&quot;To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield&quot;—is undercut by irony, when Baum and later critics compare this line to Satan&#x27;s &quot;courage never to submit or yield&quot; in John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (1667).

Ulysses&#x27; apparent disdain for those around him is another facet of the ironic perspective. He declares that he is &quot;matched with an aged wife&quot; (3), indicates his weariness in governing a &quot;savage race&quot; (4), and suggests his philosophical distance from his son Telemachus. A skeptical reading of the second paragraph finds it a condescending tribute to Telemachus and a rejection of his &quot;slow prudence&quot; (36). However, the adjectives used to describe Telemachus—&quot;blameless&quot;, &quot;discerning&quot;, and &quot;decent&quot;—are words with positive connotations in other of Tennyson&#x27;s poetry and within the classical tradition.

Other ironic readings have found Ulysses longing for withdrawal, even death, in the form of his proposed quest. In noting the sense of passivity in the poem, critics highlight Tennyson&#x27;s tendency toward the melancholic. &quot;Ulysses&quot; is found lacking in narrative action; the hero&#x27;s goal is vague, and by the poem&#x27;s famous last line, it is not clear for what he is &quot;striving&quot;, or to what he refuses to yield. Goldwin Smith wrote in 1855 that Ulysses &quot;intends to roam, but stands for ever a listless and melancholy figure on the shore&quot;. T. S. Eliot, who praised the poem, still opined that &quot;Tennyson could not tell a story at all&quot;; he found Dante&#x27;s treatment of Ulysses exciting compared to Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;elegiac mood&quot;. Victorian scholar Herbert Tucker suggests that the goal of Tennyson&#x27;s characters is to be moved inwardly by moving through time and space. Ulysses says he finds experience &quot;somewhere out there&quot;,

&lt;poem&gt;
 ... an arch wherethro&#x27;
 Gleams that untravell&#x27;d world whose margin fades
 For ever and for ever when I move. 
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Legacy==

===Contemporary appraisal and canonization===

Contemporary reviews of &quot;Ulysses&quot; were positive and found no irony in the poem. Author John Sterling—like Tennyson a member of the Cambridge Apostles—wrote in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; in 1842, &quot;How superior is &#x27;Ulysses&#x27;! There is in this work a delightful epic tone, and a clear impassioned wisdom quietly carving its sage words and graceful figures on pale but lasting marble.&quot; Tennyson&#x27;s 1842 volume of poetry impressed Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle. Quoting three lines of &quot;Ulysses&quot; in an 1842 letter to Tennyson—

&lt;poem&gt;
 It may be that the gulfs will wash us down,
 It may be we shall touch the happy Isles
 And see the great Achilles whom we knew! [sic] 
&lt;/poem&gt;

—Carlyle remarked, &quot;These lines do not make me weep, but there is in me what would fill whole Lachrymatories as I read.&quot;

English theologian Richard Holt Hutton summarized the poem as Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;friendly picture of the insatiable craving for new experience, enterprise, and adventure, when under the control of a luminous reason and a self-controlled will.&quot; The contemporary poet Matthew Arnold was early in observing the narrative irony of the poem: he found Ulysses&#x27; speech &quot;the least &quot;plain&quot;, the most &quot;un-Homeric&quot;, which can possibly be conceived. Homer presents his thought to you just as it wells from the source of his mind: Mr. Tennyson carefully distils his thought before he will part with it. Hence comes ... a heightened and elaborate air.&quot;

Despite the early critical acclaim of &quot;Ulysses&quot;, its rise within the Tennyson canon took decades. Tennyson did not usually select it for publication in poetry anthologies; in teaching anthologies, however, the poem was usually included—and it remains a popular teaching poem today. Its current prominence in Tennyson&#x27;s oeuvre is the result of two trends, according to Tennyson scholar Matthew Rowlinson: the rise of formal English poetry studies in the late nineteenth century, and the Victorian effort to articulate a British culture that could be exported. He argues that &quot;Ulysses&quot; forms part of the prehistory of imperialism—a term that only appeared in the language in 1851. The protagonist sounds like a &quot;colonial administrator&quot;, and his reference to seeking a newer world (57) echoes the phrase &quot;New World&quot;, which became common during the Renaissance. While &quot;Ulysses&quot; cannot be read as overtly imperialistic, Tennyson&#x27;s later work as Poet Laureate sometimes argues for the value of Britain&#x27;s colonies, or was accused of jingoism.

===Literary and cultural legacy===

In a 1929 essay, T. S. Eliot called &quot;Ulysses&quot; a &quot;perfect poem&quot;. An analogue of Ulysses is found in Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Gerontion&quot; (1920). Both poems are narrated by an aged man contemplating life&#x27;s end. An excerpt from &quot;Gerontion&quot; reads as an ironic comment on the introductory lines of &quot;Ulysses&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;
 Rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds.
 The woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea,
 Sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter.

 I am an old man,
 A dull head among windy places. 
&lt;/poem&gt;

The Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli (1855–1912) stated that his long lyric poem &quot;L&#x27;ultimo viaggio&quot; was an attempt to reconcile the portrayals of Ulysses in Dante and Tennyson with Tiresias&#x27;s prophecy that Ulysses would die &quot;a mild death off the sea&quot;. Pascoli&#x27;s Ulysses leaves Ithaca to retrace his epic voyage rather than begin another.

&quot;Ulysses&quot; remains much admired, even as the twentieth century brought new interpretations of the poem. Professor of literature Basil Willey commented in 1956, &quot;In &#x27;Ulysses&#x27; the sense that he must press on and not moulder in idleness is expressed objectively, through the classical story, and not subjectively as his own experience. [Tennyson] comes here as near perfection in the grand manner as he ever did; the poem is flawless in tone from beginning to end; spare, grave, free from excessive decoration, and full of firmly controlled feeling.&quot; In the fifteenth edition of &quot;Bartlett&#x27;s Familiar Quotations&quot; (1980), nine sections of &quot;Ulysses&quot;, comprising 36 of the poem&#x27;s 70 lines, are quoted, compared to only six in the ninth edition of 1891.

Many readers have found the acclaimed last lines of the poem inspirational. The final line has been used as a motto by schools and other organisations; cited in a number of speeches; and is inscribed on a cross at Observation Hill, Antarctica, to commemorate explorer Robert Falcon Scott and his party, who died on their return trek from the South Pole in 1912. The line was included on a wall in the athletes village at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. &quot;Ulysses&quot;concludes:
&lt;poem&gt;
 Tho&#x27; much is taken, much abides; and tho&#x27;
 We are not now that strength which in old days
 Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;
 One equal temper of heroic hearts,
 Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
 To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. 
&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>Mint-made errors occur when coins are made incorrectly at the mint, including anything that happens to the coin up until the completion of the minting process. Mint error coins can be the result of deterioration of the minting equipment, accidents or malfunctions during the minting process, or interventions by mint personnel. Coins are inspected during production and errors are typically caught. However, some are inadvertently released into circulation. Modern production methods eliminate many errors and automated counters are effective at removing error coins. Damage occurring later (post-mint damage) may sometime resemble true mint errors. Error coins may be of value to collectors depending on the rarity and condition. Some coin collectors specialize in error coins.

Errors can be the result of defective planchets, defective dies or the result of mistakes made during striking. The planchet, die, and striking (or PDS) classification system happens to correspond with the mintmarks of the three largest U.S. mints, Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco. Some errors have multiple causes and not all errors fall neatly within the categories. For example, design elements may be missing from coins because die crevices were filled with grease — a problem with the die but the error occurs when the coin is struck. Labels used to identify specific categories of errors may describe the cause of the error (die crack, rotated die, clipped planchet), the appearance of the coin (wavy steps, trails, missing element) or other factors (mule, cud, brockage). Some errors are known by multiple names, e.g. filled die errors are also known as missing design element errors and as strike throughs. 

Some errors, such as an off-center strike, are unique. Other errors, such as those resulting from a specific die crack, form a variety, i.e., a group of coins with distinctive details or characteristics. Uniqueness does not necessarily make an error coin valuable. Although no other coin may be the same as a coin with a particular off-center strike, off-center strikes of varying degrees are not extremely rare. Accidental error coins are perhaps the most numerous, although in modern minting they are rare, making them potentially valuable to collectors. Intentional intervention by mint personnel does not typically involve a deliberate attempt to create an error, but usually involves an action intended to improve quality that miscarries.

==Planchet preparation errors==
Mints purchase long strips of metal which are fed through blanking machines that punch out disks known as blank planchets (or simply as planchets or blanks) on which coins are struck. This determines the size and shape of eventual coins. 

===Blank planchet===

The punched disks are first known as &quot;Type-1&quot; blanks (or planchets). After an upending mill adds uniform rounded rims, the disks are called &quot;Type-2&quot; blanks (or planchets). Occasionally, Type-1 and Type-2 blanks aren&#x27;t further processed, ‘escape’ the mint facility and enter circulation. Type-2 blanks may also be considered striking errors as they are prepared correctly, but are released without having been struck.

===Clipped planchet===

A misfeed can occur when the metal strip is fed through the blanking machine. The punches sometimes overlap the leading edge of the metal producing a straight clip. Sometimes, the punches strike an area of the strip which overlaps the hole left by the previous strike producing a curved clip. On such curved-clip coins, often the rim opposite the clip shows a distinctive distortion and loss of detail called &quot;Blakesley Effect&quot;. Sometimes punches strike the irregular trailing edge of the metal strip producing irregular clips.

===Improper planchet thickness===
Coins are sometimes struck on planchets that are either too thin or too thick producing underweight or overweight coins. This error can be due to incorrect equipment settings causing the metal strip to be rolled to the wrong thickness or due to the use of a metal strip intended for another coin denomination, such as a U.S. quarter planchet cut from a metal roll intended for dimes.

===Lamination flaw===

A lamination flaw is a planchet defect that results from metal impurities or internal stresses. Lamination flaws cause discoloration, uneven surfaces, peeling, and splitting.

===Split planchet===
A split planchet coin error occurs when, during the preparation of the planchet strip, impurities such as gas, dirt, or grease become trapped under the surface of the metal blank, creating a weakness or lamination defect. This weak area of the metal may flake, peel, or split because the adhesion is poor.

Split planchet errors are normally restricted to planchets composed of a solid alloy, such as U.S. cents and nickels, and the Australian fifty-cent coin. Split planchet errors should not be confused with &quot;separation errors&quot;, which only affect clad and plated coins. Separation errors are bonding errors, not alloy errors.

A split can occur either before or after the coin is struck. The descriptive terms split before strike and split after strike are used to distinguish the respective types. A &quot;split before strike&quot; will show design on both sides of the coin, have coarse to fine striations, and will usually be weakly struck. A &quot;split after strike&quot; will show a normal strike on one side, but will have a rough, design-free surface on the other side and will always weigh less than a normal planchet.

===Cladding flaw===

Many modern coins are made of layers of different metals known as clads. These cladding layers sometimes peel, fold, or completely separate.

==Hub and die errors==
Mints use hubs bearing raised images similar to the images that appear on a coin to imprint indented images onto the ends of steel rods. Those rods become the dies which strike planchets making them into coins. Hub and die errors can occur at the time the dies are made, when the dies are installed into presses, and from die deterioration during use. Modern coins can still be released with hub and die errors when the defects are too small to be seen with the naked eye. Sometimes, dies are used despite producing obvious flaws, such as the 1955 U.S. Lincoln cent.

===Fundamental die-setting error===
A fundamental die-setting error occurs when the die is not set as the producers intended. For example, in April 2013 the Central Bank of Ireland issued a silver €10 commemorative coin in honor of James Joyce that misquoted a famous line from his masterwork &quot;Ulysses&quot; despite being warned on at least two occasions by the Department of Finance over difficulties with copyright and design.

===Missing design elements===

Missing mintmarks, dates, and other design elements occur as the result of errors in the die or at the time of striking. A design element that is missing from the die when it is made is a fundamental error. Missing design elements that occur because dies are tilted and do not strike the planchet face-on are known as misaligned dies. A design element may be missing because foreign matter, such as grease, plugs the cavity into which the planchet&#x27;s metal would normally flow under the striking pressure. This error is also known as a filled die or a strike through. Although this does involve a die, it is typically thought of as a striking error, but is included here for completeness. This type of error led to some specimens of the 1999 release of the US 50 State quarters design for Delaware to be missing the final &quot;E&quot; from the state&#x27;s motto, thus accidentally declaring Delaware &quot;THE FIRST STAT.&quot;

===Doubled die===
A doubled die occurs when a die receives an additional, misaligned impression from the hub. Overdate coins such as the 1942/1 U.S. Mercury dime and 1918/7 U.S. buffalo nickel are also doubled dies. They are both listed by CONECA as class III doubled dies. Class III means the die was hubbed with different &quot;designs&quot; (or hubs that had different dates). They are not repunched dates, since the dates were punched onto the hub. Die deterioration may also appear as doubling.

===Die defects: cracks, breaks, and chips===

Dies can crack during use producing jaggeds, raised lines on the surface of subsequently struck coins. In U.S. coinage, many Morgan dollar coins show slight die cracks. Dies with cracks, especially those with cracks near the edge, sometimes break. The broken piece may be retained in position or fall away. Die cracks and retained die breaks can be difficult to distinguish. Retained die breaks cross the coin&#x27;s face from rim to rim with the area to one side of the break being slightly higher than the other. Coins struck after the break falls away have a raised, rounded, unstruck area along the edge. These coins are known to collectors as cuds. Sometimes, an area of a die will chip out of the center. These so-called die chips also appear as raised, rounded, unstruck areas on subsequently struck coins.

===Die clash===

A die clash occurs when the obverse and reverse dies are damaged upon striking each other without a planchet between them. Due to the tremendous pressure used, parts of the image of one die may be impressed on the other. Planchets subsequently struck by the clashed dies receive the distorted image. A well-known example is the &quot;Bugs Bunny&quot; Franklin half dollar of 1955, where part of the eagle&#x27;s wing from the reverse gives Franklin the image of protruding teeth.

===MAD clash===

A MAD clash (short for &quot;misaligned dies&quot;) occurs when an obverse and reverse die strike each other while misaligned in relation to each other. Additional misalignment errors are discussed below. 

===Punching errors===

Historically, some design elements near the outer perimeter of a die were added by punching because technology made it difficult to press both the central and perimeter design elements at the same time. Also, some dies were made without mintmarks or dates to permit their use at different mints. A die technician added missing elements by positioning a puncheon, a small steel rod with the mirror image of a letter or number on it, and striking the puncheon with a hammer pressing the image into the die. If the image is not strong enough, the technician will punch it a second time. Puncheons placed in a different position between strikes will produce a doubled image which is called a repunch. Dual punches occur when punching is repeated in a second location. Sometimes technicians use a puncheon with the wrong or incorrectly sized letter or number. A well known example of a small mint mark is 1945-S &quot;Micro S&quot; U.S. Mercury dime, when the mint used an old puncheon intended for Philippines coins. A much rarer example is the 1892-O &quot;Micro O&quot; U.S. Barber half dollar, which may have come about from the brief use of a mintmark puncheon intended for the quarter. The same error occurred with the 1905-O U.S. Barber dime. Numerous examples are known of this mistake. Modern techniques have eliminated the need to add design elements by punching as they are an integral part of the design and
included in each step of the hub and die making processes.

===Overdates and overmintmarks===
In the past, mints used dies until they broke. At the beginning of the year, mints punched a new date over the old on dies that were in use. For 19th-century coins, it is difficult to call an overdate an &quot;error&quot;, as it resulted from intentional recycling of the die. An overmintmark occurs when a second mintmark is punched over an earlier mintmark following the transfer of a die from one mint to another. A well-known example is the 1900 Morgan silver dollar, when reverse dies with &quot;CC&quot; below the eagle were sent from the Carson City Mint to the New Orleans Mint, where they were given an &quot;O&quot;. A similar case occurred in 1938, when a reverse die for the buffalo nickel was made for the San Francisco Mint, because that year only, the Denver Mint made these coins with a &quot;D&quot; punched over the &quot;S&quot;.

===Trails===
Lines, called trails, transfer to coins from dies made using the modern high pressure &quot;single pressing&quot; process. When images are impressed into dies using the process, the displaced metal moves out into fields leaving visible lines on the dies. The dies themselves are called trail dies. Coins on which the lines appear are simply called trails. Trails were first noted on Lincoln Memorial steps found on the reverse of one cent coins minted from 1959 to 2008. The trails gave the steps the appearance of being wavy. The term wavy steps is still used to refer to trails found on the memorial steps, but the term trails is more commonly used to refer to lines found elsewhere.

===Mule===

A coin struck using dies never intended for use together is called a &quot;mule&quot;. An example is a coin struck with dies designed for different coin denominations, or a coin struck with two dies that both lack a minting year on them, resulting in a &#x27;dateless&#x27; coin.

===Misaligned dies===
Dies must be properly aligned in presses for coins to be struck correctly. Errors occur when dies are offset, tilted, or rotated. Offset errors occur when the hammer die is not centered over the anvil die typically resulting in an off-centered obverse, but centered reverse. Tilting errors occur when die surfaces are not parallel producing coins that are thinner along one edge, and sometimes causing missing design elements along the opposite edge because of insufficient pressure being exerted on that edge. Rotation errors occur when the images on the obverse and reverse dies are turned from the normal positions such as when the reverse image is at a right angle to the obverse.

==Strike errors==
Strike errors occur when the planchet is struck. It is a fault in the manufacturing process rather than in either the die or the planchet. Numismatists often prize strike-error coins over perfectly struck examples, which tend to be more common, but less highly than die-error coins, which are usually rarer, making them valuable.

===Broadstrike===

Broadstrike errors are produced when the collar die (the circular die surrounding the lower die) malfunctions. The collar prevents the metal of the blank from flowing outside the confines of the die. All denominations of U.S. coins with a broadstrike have plain edges.

===Strike through===
A &quot;strike-through&quot; coin is made when another object comes between a blank and a die at the time of striking. That object&#x27;s outline is pressed into the blank&#x27;s surface. Common examples include hard objects such as staples, metal shavings, and other coins as well as soft objects such as cloth and grease. Hard objects leave sharp outlines and, on occasion, adhere to the blank producing a coin called a &quot;retained strike-through&quot;. A planchet &quot;struck-through&quot; a coin is left with an impression of the coin called brockage (discussed below). When the &quot;strike-through&quot; object is a blank planchet the result is a uni-face coin with one struck side and one blank side (see below). When the &quot;struck-through&quot; object is another coin, and that coin adheres to a die(as opposed to the other coin), the adhered coin is called a &quot;die cap&quot; (discussed below). Two coins which adhere to one another are called &quot;bonded pairs&quot;. Softer objects, such as grease, can fill crevices in a die, producing a weak strike with a smudged appearance. These errors are often called &quot;missing element coins&quot; (discussed above and as &quot;filled dies&quot;). (A great example of such an error occurred in 1922, when only the Denver mint struck Lincoln cents. As a result of the mint attempting to speed up production, such a large amount of excessive grease was applied to the dies that the mintmark was obscured and therefore either nonexistent or weakened on the 1922 cents. These are very popular with collectors.)


===Uni-face coin===
A uni-face coin results when two planchets are stacked one atop the other at the time of striking. This produces two coins: one with only an obverse image, and a second with only the reverse image. The planchets may be centered over the die producing one complete image on each coin or off-centered producing partial images on each side. In the accompanying image of the blank reverse, the shadow or outline of Lincoln&#x27;s profile from the obverse side of the coin is visible.

===Die cap===

A struck coin remains on a die and leaves its slowly fading impression (called brockage) on subsequently struck coins. subsequent strikes cause the stuck coin to gradually change shape if it isn&#x27;t dislodged, eventually resulting in it taking on a dome-like shape akin to a bottle cap.

===Brockage===
Brockage occurs when a mirror image of a coin is struck on a blank. After a struck coin fails to eject, a new blank is fed between the struck coin and the hammer die. The hammer die strikes the second blank leaving its image on one side while pressing the blank against the previously stuck coin which sinks its image into opposite side. Most brockages are off-center, but fully overlapping brockages are the most desirable.

===Edge strike===
There are two types of edge strikes. A standing edge strike occurs when a blank &quot;bounces&quot; so that it is standing on edge as it is struck. Striking pressure produces edge indentations where the dies strike, and sometimes bends the blank. Repeated strikes can produce a coin that is folded flat. . Chain edge strikes occur when two blanks are fed into the space between dies at the same time. The blanks expand when struck and press together leaving each with single indented edge. Two chain edge struck coins together are known as a matched pair.

===Multiple strike===
A multiple strike, also referred to as a double exposure, occurs when the coin has additional images from being struck again, off center. The result is sometimes mistaken for being a &quot;doubled die&quot;. On occasion, a coin will flip over between strikes so that the second image is that of the opposite side of the coin.

===Off-center strike===
An off-center coin is produced when the coin is struck once, albeit off center. Unlike a broadstrike, the punch is not in the center of the coin, but rather the edge. This results in a coin which is not circular. The coin gives a freakish appearance as a result, and various amounts of blank planchet space are visible. The coins can vary in value because of how far off center they are struck, although coins with full dates are more desirable than coins without a date or missing digits.

===Double denomination===
A double denomination coin is one that has been struck twice between different denomination dies such as once between nickel dies and again between quarter dies. The term is sometimes used to refer to a coin struck on the wrong planchet (see below).

===Struck on wrong planchet===

Sometimes planchets for one coin denomination are fed into a coin-stamping press equipped with dies of another denomination. This results in a coin that has been stamped with a design intended for a differently sized coin. The resulting errors are prized by collectors, though they are usually caught during the manufacturing process and destroyed. Such errors are sometimes called &quot;double denomination&quot; coins, but that term is also used to refer to coins struck a second time with dies of a different denomination.

Some examples include cents struck on dime planchets, nickels on cent planchets, or quarters on dime planchets. This type of error should not be confused with the much rarer mule which is a coin struck between dies that were never intended to be used together such as a coin with nickel obverse and a dime reverse.

Wrong-planchet errors may also occur when the composition of the coin changes. Such situations generally arise when the mint has decided to change the alloy or plating of the coin in the new coinage year, but a few planchets from the previous year—and thus of the previous composition—have yet to be struck. Should the dies be changed for the new year while the old planchets are awaiting striking and not removed, coins using the old composition will be struck with the new year&#x27;s date. Such coins are rare and often highly valued by collectors, as with the 1943 copper cents and 1944 steel cents.

A much rarer error is a denomination struck on a foreign planchet. This did occur occasionally with United States (and before that American colonial) coinage in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. In the 20th century, fewer errors on foreign planchets are discovered but they still occur when the U.S. Mint is contracted by foreign governments to produce coinage for them, and can hold a high value. Recent encapsulations and sales at auctions reveal 1995 and 1996 examples of mintages on foreign planchet. A few 1996 Lincoln cents were struck on stock designated for Singapore. There are 1997-D, 1998 and 2000 dated Lincoln cents struck on foreign planchets, but not identified by PCGS or NGC as to the country the mintage was intended. A wrong planchet error that sold for $5462.50 on Heritage Auctions in August 2010 is an undated U.S nickel struck on top of a 1960 Peruvian 5 centavos. 
===Edge and rim errors===
Blanks are surrounded by collars when struck to prevent the blank from flattening and spreading. Edge and rim errors occur when collars are either out of position or are deteriorated. A wire rim occurs when excessive pressure squeezes out metal between the collar and the edge of the die producing an extremely high thin rim. A partial collar occurs when an out-of-position collar leaves a line around the coin which is visible when looking at its edge. A partial collar is sometimes called a railroad rim when a reeded edge coin is involved as the line resembles a rail and the reeds resemble railroad ties.

===Mated pair or set===
A collection of two or more coins struck at the same time or during successive strikes on one or more dies, these coins with the resulting errors are related to one another, fitting together as a set. All brockages, indents, chain edge strikes, and capped die strikes have a corresponding coin, but are rarely found together. A single coin of the set may be discovered by mint staff during quality control and removed, or the coins may be separated into different lots to be distributed separately into circulation.

==Post-mint damage==

Authentic error coins are often confused with coins that have post-mint damage. Such coins are damaged (gouged, scraped, etched, mutilated, flattened) after the final strike, either accidentally or deliberately. If damage occurs at the mint after the minting process, for example in subsequent automated handling, it is still considered post-mint damage. Corrosion, scratches, bending, and dings can all occur to coins in circulation and sometimes may mimic mint-errors. 

==Numismatic value of error coins==
Like other coins, the value of errors is based in part on rarity and condition. In general, lower denomination errors are less expensive than higher denomination errors simply because more such coins are minted resulting in available errors. Due to improvements in production and inspection, modern errors are more rare and this impacts value. Some types of errors, such as clipped planchets, edge strikes, and foreign object strike-throughs can be faked. Many errors are sold ungraded because of their relatively low value and the relative cost of grading. In addition, errors are often not noted by grading services. Overdates, mules, brockage, double denomination, and struck on the wrong planchet errors are often valuable. Errors on ancient, medieval, and higher-value coins, however, may be detrimental to the coin&#x27;s numismatic value.

<doc id="344154" wikidata="Q3989791" url="?curid=344154" title="The Unknown Citizen">
<text>&quot;The Unknown Citizen&quot; is a poem written by W. H. Auden in 1939, shortly after he moved from England to the United States. The poem was first published on January 6, 1940 in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and first appeared in book form in Auden&#x27;s collection &quot;Another Time&quot; (Random House, 1940).

The poem is the epitaph of a man identified only by a combination of letters and numbers, JS/07/M/378, who is described entirely in external terms: from the point of view of government organizations such as the fictional &quot;Bureau of Statistics.&quot; The speaker of the poem concludes that the man had lived an entirely average, therefore exemplary, life. The poem is a satire of standardization at the expense of individualism. The poem is implicitly the work of a government agency at some point in the future, when modern bureaucratizing trends have reached the point where citizens are known by arbitrary numbers and letters, not personal names.

==Interpretation==
By describing the &quot;average citizen&quot; through the eyes of various government organizations, the poem criticizes standardization and the modern state&#x27;s relationship with its citizens. The last lines of the poem dismiss the questions of whether he was &quot;free&quot; or &quot;happy,&quot; implicitly because the &#x27;statistical method&#x27; strategy used by the state to judge his life cannot understand such questions. The manipulative state described in the poem finds the Unknown Citizen to be an ideal one.

The epigraph to &quot;The Unknown Citizen&quot; is a parody of the symbolic Tomb of the Unknown Soldier commemorating unidentified soldiers; tombs of unknown soldiers were first created following the first World War.

It is not just government organizations that Auden criticizes. His employer is &quot;satisfied,&quot; his union &quot;reports he paid his dues&quot;, his mates are found to like him, and the press are pleased with his buying papers daily and responding to the ads. The industry poll takers are happy with his buying habits, and teachers are glad he stayed out of their way. In Auden&#x27;s poem, the entire system and society are responsible for the loss of individualism, whether or not government was the initial cause of the decline.

<text>The government agencies in Sweden are state-controlled organizations that act independently to carry out the policies of the Government of Sweden. The ministries are relatively small and merely policy-making organizations, allowed to monitor the agencies and preparing decision and policy papers for the government as a collective body to decide upon. 

A Cabinet Minister is explicitly prohibited from interfering with the day-to-day operation in an agency or the outcome in individual cases. The cardinal rule is that Ministers are not allowed to issue orders to agencies in their portfolio personally (with only a few exceptions) as the government agencies are subject to decisions made by the government, although the government cannot even directly overrule an agency in the handling of an individual case.

Other than the executive branch, the Riksdag also has a number of independent agencies.

<text>Elizabeth Muriel Gregory MacGill (March 27, 1905November 4, 1980), known as the &quot;Queen of the Hurricanes&quot;, was a Canadian engineer. She was chief aeronautical engineer at Canadian Car and Foundry (CC&amp;F) in Fort William, Ontario during the Second World War. There she oversaw manufacturing of 1,451 Hawker Hurricane fighter aircraft for the Royal Canadian Air Force and the British Royal Air Force, then 835 Curtiss Helldivers for the U.S. Navy, which contributed greatly to the war effort and did much to make Canada a powerhouse of aircraft manufacturing. After her work at CC&amp;F, she ran a successful aeronautical engineering consulting business. Between 1967 and 1970, she was a Commissioner on the Royal Commission on the Status of Women in Canada, which published a report in 1970.

==Early life and education==
MacGill was born in Vancouver on March 27, 1905, youngest daughter of James Henry MacGill, a prominent Vancouver lawyer, part-time journalist, and Anglican deacon, and Helen Gregory MacGill, a journalist and British Columbia&#x27;s first woman judge. She had two older step-brothers from her mother&#x27;s first marriage, and an older sister with whom she was very close.

In the early years, the MacGill children were home-schooled in a formal setting to mimic that of Lord Roberts, the public school that the older boys attended. This included drawing lessons with Emily Carr, and swimming lessons with Joe Fortes. They later attended King George Secondary School, which was affiliated with McGill University. This rigorous education facilitated Elsie&#x27;s entrance to the University of British Columbia when she was 16. She was admitted to the Applied Sciences program, but the Dean of the Faculty asked her to leave after only one term.

When MacGill was 12 years old, her mother was appointed judge of the juvenile court of Vancouver. After 1911, racial strife in British Columbia continued to escalate, and Jim MacGill&#x27;s immigration-related legal work was directly impacted. This caused severe financial strain for the family during the war years. Her early aptitude for &quot;fixing things&quot; stood the family in good stead, and informed discussions of possible careers.

MacGill&#x27;s mother was an advocate of women&#x27;s suffrage and influenced Elsie&#x27;s decision to study engineering. 

MacGill was admitted to the University of Toronto&#x27;s Bachelor of Applied Sciences program in 1923. During the summers she worked in machine shops repairing electrical motors to supplement the theory and practical teachings during the school year. It is also here that she became exposed to the nascent field of aeronautical engineering. Contracting polio just before her graduation, MacGill was told that she would probably spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair. She refused to accept that possibility though, and learned to walk supported by two metal canes. Elsie graduated from the University of Toronto in 1927, the first Canadian woman to earn a degree in electrical engineering.

After graduating, MacGill took a junior job with Austin Aircraft Company in Pontiac, Michigan, which furthered her interest in aeronautics. She also began part-time graduate studies in aeronautical engineering at the University of Michigan, enrolling in the fall of 1927 in the full-time Master of Science in Engineering program to begin aircraft design work and conduct research and development in the university&#x27;s new aeronautics facilities. In 1929, she became the first woman in North America, and perhaps the world, to be awarded a Master&#x27;s degree in aeronautical engineering.

She pursued PhD studies at MIT in Cambridge from 1932-34. In order to help finance her doctoral studies, MacGill wrote magazine articles about aircraft and flying. Her contemporary at MIT was aeronautical engineer and technical writer, M. Elsa Gardner.

==Career==

In 1934, MacGill started work at Fairchild Aircraft&#x27;s operations in Longueuil as an assistant aeronautical engineer. She contributed to various aviation projects including the Fairchild Super 71 (the first aircraft designed and built in Canada featuring a metal fuselage), the Fairchild 82 (a bush plane), and the Fairchild Sekani (twin-engined transport aircraft). She presented a paper, &quot;Simplified Performance Calculations for Aeroplanes&quot;, to the Royal Aeronautical Society in Ottawa, on March 22, 1938, to high praise. It was later published in &quot;The Engineering Journal&quot;. She also participated in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s six-part series, &quot;The Engineer in War Time&quot;; her segment was called &quot;Aircraft Engineering in Wartime Canada&quot;. In 1942, she was elected to the position of chairman of the EIC, Lakehead Branch, after having also served as their vice-chairman.

Later that year MacGill was hired as Chief Aeronautical Engineer at Canadian Car and Foundry (CanCar). There she designed and tested a new training aircraft, the Maple Leaf Trainer II.

The Maple Leaf Trainer was designed and first built in CanCar&#x27;s Fort William (now Thunder Bay) factories, where MacGill had moved. Although the Maple Leaf II did not enter service with any Commonwealth forces, ten (two were completed, but eight had to be assembled in Mexico) were sold to Mexico where its high-altitude performance was important, given the many airfields from which it had to operate. Her role in the company changed when the factory was selected to build the Hawker Hurricane fighter aircraft for the Royal Air Force (RAF). The factory had to be quickly expanded from about 500 workers to 4,500 by war&#x27;s end, half of them women. McGill was responsible for tooling up production for more than 25,000 precision parts; the parts had to be interchangeable with Hurricanes manufactured in the U.K. For much of the war MacGill&#x27;s primary task was to set up and streamline operations in the production line as the factories rapidly expanded. This involved designing and adapting machine tools to enable quantity manufacturing to exacting specifications. She was also responsible for designing solutions to allow the aircraft to operate during the winter, introducing de-icing controls and a system for fitting skis for landing on snow.

By the time the production line shut down in 1943, CanCar had produced 1,451 Hurricanes. In 1940 she wrote and presented a paper on the experience, &quot;Factors Affecting Mass Production of Aeroplanes&quot;, later published in &quot;The Engineering Journal&quot; . Her role in this successful production run made her famous, to the point of having a comic book biography appear in an issue of True Comics in 1942, using her nickname, &quot;Queen of the Hurricanes”. Numerous popular stories were published about her in the media as well, reflecting the public&#x27;s fascination with this woman engineer. 

After Hurricane production ended, CanCar looked for new work and secured a contract from the United States Navy to build Curtiss SB2C Helldivers. Again MacGill was responsible for all engineering and production work, and the plant ultimately produced 835 aircraft, significantly contributing to Allied air power. This production did not go nearly as smoothly, and a continual stream of minor changes from Curtiss-Wright (in turn demanded by the U.S. Navy) meant that full-scale production took a long time to get started. 

MacGill moved to Toronto, where she set up an aeronautical engineering consulting business with Bill Soulsby in 1943. In 1946, she became a Technical Adviser for International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), where she helped to draft International Air Worthiness regulations for the design and production of commercial aircraft. In 1947 she became the chairman of the United Nations Stress Analysis Committee, the first woman ever to chair a U.N. committee.

In 1952, MacGill presented a paper to the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) conference, &quot;The Initiative in Airliner Design&quot;, that was subsequently published in &quot;The Engineering Journal&quot;. A year later SWE awarded her their annual Achievement Award.

==Advocacy==
After breaking her leg in 1953, MacGill used the opportunity of her months of convalescence to sort through her mother&#x27;s papers and begin writing a biography of her mother&#x27;s life. MacGill published the book, &quot;My Mother, the Judge: A Biography of Judge Helen Gregory MacGill,&quot; in 1955. The active public service and work of her mother and grandmother in the suffrage movement inspired Elsie to spend more time dealing with women&#x27;s rights in the 1960s.

MacGill served as President of the Canadian Federation of Business and Professional Women&#x27;s Clubs from 1962 to 1964. In 1967 she was named to the Royal Commission on the Status of Women in Canada and co-authored the report published in 1970. She also filed a &quot;Separate Statement&quot; describing those of her opinions which differed from the majority on the commission. For example, she wanted abortion removed from the entirety of the Criminal Code.

MacGill was also a member of the Ontario Status of Women Committee, an affiliate of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women. For this work she was given the Order of Canada in 1971.

MacGill once said:

==Personal life ==
Elsie MacGill married E.J. &quot;Bill&quot; Soulsby in 1943 and the couple moved to Toronto, where they began their consulting firm. 

After a short illness, MacGill died on November 4, 1980, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In noting her death, Shirley Allen, a Canadian member of the Ninety-Nines organization of women aviators said of her: &quot;She had a brilliant mind and was recognized as an outstanding Canadian woman. Neither gender nor disability prevented her from using her talents to serve her community and country.&quot;

==Awards, honours, and legacy==

MacGill&#x27;s education and career reflected many &quot;firsts&quot;. She was the first Canadian woman to earn a bachelors degree in electrical engineering in 1927 and in 1929, she became the first woman in North America, and perhaps the world, to be awarded a Master&#x27;s degree in aeronautical engineering. In 1938, she was the first woman elected to corporate membership in the Engineering Institute of Canada (EIC). In 1942, MacGill was hired as Chief Aeronautical Engineer at Canadian Car and Foundry (CanCar), becoming the first woman in the world to hold such a position. In 1946, she became the first woman to serve as Technical Adviser for International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). In 1947 she was named chair of the United Nations Stress Analysis Committee, becoming the first woman ever to chair a United Nations committee.

MacGill&#x27;s paper, &quot;Factors Affecting the Mass Production of Aeroplanes&quot;, won the Gzowski Medal from the Engineering Institute of Canada in 1941. In 1953, she was one of only 50 people, and the only woman, to have her picture in the exclusive Gevaert Gallery of Canadian Executives to honour her contributions and influence. In 1953 the Society of Women Engineers (in the U.S.) presented her with its Achievement Award &quot;in recognition of her meritorious contributions to aeronautical engineering,&quot; the first time the Award was given outside the United States.

MacGill was awarded the Centennial Medal by the Canadian government in 1967, and the Order of Canada in 1971 for &quot;services as an aeronautical engineering consultant and as a member of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women.&quot; She received an honorary Doctor of Law degree from the University of Toronto in 1973 and an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of Windsor in 1976. The Ninety-Nines awarded her the Amelia Earhart Medal in 1975; and in 1979 the Ontario Association of Professional Engineers presented her with their gold medal. She also received the Queens&#x27; Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977. 

In 1983 MacGill was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Aviation Hall of Fame, and in 1992 she was a founding inductee in the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame in Ottawa.

Her life story is part of the documentary &quot;Rosies of the North&quot; (1999).

In 2016, she was chosen as one of five outstanding women &quot;on the short list to be chosen as the iconic Canadian woman to be featured on the next series of banknotes&quot;.

In 2019, the Lakehead District School Board approved Ecole Elsie MacGill Public School as the name of the elementary school, then still under construction, which would replace Agnew H. Johnston and Edgewater Park public schools when it opens in September 2020.

Also in 2019, Elsie MacGill was the honoree of a Canada Post stamp as part of the &quot;Canadians in Flight&quot; series.

In October 2020, MacGill was the topic of a Heritage Minute short film honouring her achievements in the Second World War.

In September 2021 Elsie MacGill Secondary School of the Halton District School Board in Milton, Ontario opened.

In 2022, the Thunder Bay squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets was renamed &quot;70 &#x27;Elsie MacGill&#x27; Royal Canadian Air Cadet Squadron.&quot;

In 2023, The Royal Canadian Mint created a Commemorative circulating loonie entitled &quot;Honouring Elsie MacGill &quot;

<text>Benny Beaver is the official mascot of Oregon State University and winner of the 2011 Capital One Mascot of the Year write-in campaign. The date of the first use of the beaver as the university&#x27;s mascot is unknown, but photographs in the school&#x27;s yearbook document its use as a mascot as early as the 1940s. The campus newspaper was one of the first documented university entities to use the beaver as a name, starting in 1896.

in Oregon, the beaver has always been a popular animal but even more so in Europe and the Eastern US. In fact, wealthy residents of these two regions were dressing in fashionable beaver fur long before European explorers discovered Oregon. By the late 1700s, the beaver trade was already a major global industry. Beaver fur top hats were popular attire for the North American and European upper class. At the turn of the 19th century, the newly explored American Northwest was found to be plentiful with beaver. As a territory, Oregon grew into a global supplier. When Oregon became a state, it coined itself &quot;The Beaver State&quot; due to the beaver&#x27;s historic importance as an economic catalyst for the region and, similar to the California &quot;Gold Rush&quot;, helping to attract thousands of early pioneers and homesteaders. The beaver now appears on the back of the state flag and is recognized as the official state animal.

==Mascot history==

Shortly after the university&#x27;s school newspaper named itself the &quot;Beaver&quot;, the university&#x27;s yearbook took the name (1916). The continued use of the name, mostly by the yearbook, eventually solidified the beaver as the university&#x27;s official mascot. The popularity of the beaver was also shared by students at University of Oregon. For several early publishings, students at this school also used &quot;The Beaver&quot; as their yearbook&#x27;s title.

Oregon State University&#x27;s first documented use of &quot;Benny Beaver&quot; was found in a photograph showing students posing next to a statue of a beaver inscribed with the name &quot;Benny Beaver.&quot; The photograph appears in the 1942 edition of the yearbook.
Prior to the beaver, Oregon State&#x27;s mascot was an individual known as &quot;Doc&quot; Bell (1893–1928), a longtime member of the university&#x27;s board of regents. Bell became hugely popular among the students for his ritual of marching to the Marys River after each of Oregon State&#x27;s victories over Oregon and tossing his hat into the water as a token of celebration. 

Earlier mascots include &quot;Jimmie&quot; the Coyote (1892–1893) and &quot;Bulldog&quot; (1906–1910, unofficial mascot for Wrestling squad only). The beaver mascot&#x27;s name, &quot;Benny,&quot; was officially adopted in 1945 as the university mascot. Two failed attempts to maintain a live beaver mascot include Bevo Beaver (rescued from Mary&#x27;s River in 1921 and later stolen ) and Billy Beaver.

The early Benny Beaver &quot;cartoon&quot; icon/logo was created by famous graphic illustrator, and former Disney employee, Arthur C. Evans. As the art director for Angelus Pacific Company, Evans submitted his design to OSU and it was approved for use in 1951. His logos were used at hundreds of other universities and high schools throughout the nation. Evans&#x27; beaver logo also appeared in the 1985 movie &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;.

During the 1940s, students carted a beaver statue in parades throughout the state and around the stadium on game days. The statue was patterned after an earlier bronze statue that also went by the name &quot;Benny.&quot; Although the name &quot;Benny&quot; was adopted prior to the 1940s, a 1941 yearbook picture captions the statue as &quot;Bill Beaver&quot;. The following yearbook (1942) a photo of the same beaver statue is cited with the name &quot;Benny Beaver&quot;. After the statue&#x27;s demise, the name &quot;Benny&quot; was regularly used in a popular sports column in The Daily Barometer - known as &quot;The Gnawed Log.&quot;

The first live appearance during an athletic event by a mascot named &quot;Benny&quot;, was September 18, 1952 and performed by Ken Austin. Austin later founded Newberg, Oregon-based A-dec, the largest privately held dental equipment manufacturer in North America. Austin is now a major Oregon State donor.

Between the early 1980s and mid-1990s, Benny was often joined at sporting events by a co-mascot, known as &quot;Bernice Beaver.&quot;

In 1998 No Dinx, a graphic design shop in Albany, Oregon, redesigned the logo for the first time in nearly 50 years. In March 2013, working together with Nike, Oregon State University unveiled the latest, newly redesigned version, of the Benny Beaver logo. The new logo replaced the No Dinx design. The Benny Beaver costume also changed to match the new logo in 2001. Benny wears #0 at football games and #0 at basketball games. Past numbers have included #100 (football) and #6 (basketball).

In December 2010, Benny Beaver was ranked 13th on a list titled 20 Worst Behaved Mascots Of All Time. Despite the bad press, Benny Beaver won the 2011 Capital One Mascot of the Year write-in campaign, earning the mascot program $1000 and inclusion in the following year&#x27;s Capital One All-America Mascot Team.

During the halftime show of Oregon State Football&#x27;s last home game of the 2024 season, Benny became engaged with his longtime love interest, Bernice Beaver. Since the game was being played against the Washington State Cougars, Butch T. Cougar, Washington State University&#x27;s mascot, helped Benny with his proposal.

<doc id="344165" wikidata="Q5274304" url="?curid=344165" title="Die-deterioration doubling">
<text>Die deterioration doubling (DDD) is a common form of mint-made error on many United States and Canadian coins that results from degradation of the die used to strike the coin.

Due to a combination of improper preparation and treatment of the dies, excessive wear, and overuse, die deterioration doubling has occurred on nearly every series issued by the US mint in recent times. Certain coins are more susceptible to it than others, due to various factors, but it does occur on most series of coins.

==Causes==
===Annealing Errors===
During the annealing process of die making, two main errors can occur, resulting in less than perfect dies. It is impossible to tell without expensive and lengthy tests whether these errors occurred, but they will lead to significantly weaker dies and a higher tendency to deteriorate quickly. The first thing which can happen to a die in this process what metallurgists call decarburization. Decarburization is the result of an improper mix of metals and chemicals in the annealing furnace where the dies are sent to soften. If there is not enough ambient carbon in the furnace, the steel will give up some of its carbon and will become soft. The result is a thin surface of inadequate metal whose chemical composition has been altered and is below standard. 

Another less obvious error can also occur when heating the dies. After being taken out of the annealing furnace, the dies must cool for 24 to 36 hours. They are usually given an oil bath to cool them more quickly, but the dies must still cool for a period of several hours. When the dies are cooling, if they are not stored properly or not allowed to fully cool before being used, the result is a much softer die. When the die is subjected to the hubbing press again and work hardened again, it will be softer and more susceptible to wear. If the die is softer because it was not fully cooled, it will not harden to the same standard as a die which has received proper treatment. However, there will not be a noticeable difference between a good die and a bad die; the change in the structure of the die is not apparent until it is used for a period of time.

===Overuse of Dies===
In modern presses, a die strikes approximately 120 coins a minute. This is a large number of coins produced in a short time, and obviously the die cannot last forever. However, the process of wearing the die is only hastened by the metals used in coins. Nickel, one of the main metals used in today’s coins, is quite hard and causes wear quickly. Copper has been used for centuries because of its malleability and the ease with which it makes coins. However, it too wears the dies when they are used for too long. An infamous example is the 1955 &quot;poorman’s double die.&quot; This coin is sold as a replacement for the 1955 doubled die cent, but it is no more than Die Deterioration Doubling, caused by wear on the dies.

When a coin is struck, the planchet is not heated. Although the planchet would be softer and more malleable, the extra time and expense would prove too great for the Mint. The planchet is therefore struck at room temperature, and the only thing which makes the coin form is the tremendous pressure used to strike it. With a metal such as nickel, which is harder than a normal coin metal like silver, gold or copper, the pressure must be greater. When a nickel coin, or any coin, is struck, the metal must &quot;flow&quot; into the contours of the front and back dies. It is through the atoms of the metal flowing into the dies that &quot;flow lines&quot; are created. However, when metal flows over a sharp corner in the die, like the edges of a mintmark or words, it tends to roll the detail out. It wears on the die, and a little detail is lost with every strike. Die Deterioration Doubling is most prevalent on the date and mintmark because these fine details are alone in the middle of the field, and the metal must flow into these without the help of other valleys nearby. When the metal rolls into the mintmark or date, it wears away the corner of the die, and after long enough will appear on the coin as Die Deterioration Doubling.

In addition, the mint has a practice of polishing the dies and using them longer. When a die begins to show evidence of wear, a mint technician will polish the die and reuse it. However, the die is still rapidly deteriorating, and polishing it cannot avoid the problem of wear. So, after many thousand coins in rapid succession, the wear on the die has gotten so bad that it appears as Die Deterioration Doubling.

==Identification==
Die deterioration doubling is a result of a few simple causes, but it can be difficult to positively identify. There are a number of different features which appear similar, but the characteristic traits of each are easy to identify with practice. Die deterioration doubling is often mistaken for hub doubling. The causes of the two types of doubling are different, but their appearance on the finished coin is often similar. Die deterioration doubling appears most often around the mintmark and date because they are alone in the field. When it occurs in other features, like an image of a bust, it looks more like a weak strike than doubling.

Close examination of affected features show that the doubling is extremely irregular. This is because the coin metal does not flow from just one direction, but flows and produces wear on the die from all sides. There is no definite shape, and it can take on several different but similar appearances. It often looks like a thin metal shelf or spreading spot. It can also make lettering appear thick and twisted. There are no crisp lines affected, but things generally look bloated, enlarged, blurry, twisted, and damaged. This is different from hub doubling, because hub doubling appears as a crisp secondary image, rotated minutely from the original. When casually glancing at a coin, the difference is not easy to tell, but when magnified, the difference is obvious on most coins. Another easy way to tell hub doubling from die deterioration doubling is the presence of notched serifs; the small flairs on the ends of letters will appear distinctly separated with the former, whereas they appear just blurry and washed out with the latter.

==Types of die deterioration doubling==

There really are two different kinds of DDD: Inside and Outside Abraded Die Doubling. This is because Die Deterioration Doubling manifests itself in two different ways. The two classes look different, and are caused by wear in two different places. Inside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by wear around the edges and inside the actual detail affected. It appears as an enlarged, irregular outline of the element overlapping the original design element. Outside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by actual wear in the field of the die. The field of a die is the highest point, so when a mint technician polishes the die or the metal flow of a coin wears it away, the field is the first thing to be worn down. The difference here is that Outside doubling does not overlap any of the original design, but rather appears like an irregular shelf around the object.

==Numismatic Interest==
Many beginning numismatists buy coins thinking they are very valuable, but really are not worth more than a little over face value due to a die deterioration doubling. This common error fools a number of people into believing that it is a much rarer, and more valuable, form of doubling. It goes by a number of names, such as the &quot;poorman&#x27;s double die&quot;.

Jefferson nickels and Lincoln cents especially exhibit a large number of affected coins, throughout the entire history of the coin. The 1955 &quot;poorman’s double die&quot; is actually outside abraded die doubling, and a high percentage of 1999 coins exhibit this error. Because of the large numbers of these coins in circulation, they are not worth more than a few cents over normal value. Nevertheless, die deterioration doubling can deceive the beginning numismatist with the high hopes of discovering a new variety and making a fortune.

<doc id="344168" wikidata="Q5025566" url="?curid=344168" title="Cambridge Union">
<text>The Cambridge Union Society, also known as the Cambridge Union, is a historic debating and free speech society in Cambridge, England, and the largest society in the University of Cambridge. The society was founded in 1815 making it the oldest continuously running debating society in the world. Additionally, the Cambridge Union has served as a model for the foundation of similar societies at several other prominent universities, including the Oxford Union and the Yale Political Union. The Union is a private society with membership open to all students of Cambridge University and Anglia Ruskin University. The Cambridge Union is a registered charity and is completely separate from the Cambridge University Students&#x27; Union.

The Cambridge Union has a long and extensive tradition of hosting prominent figures from all areas of public life in its chamber, both state- and international-based, including the Dalai Lama, US presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking, UK Prime Ministers Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher, and John Major, presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, as well as comedian Stephen Fry. Previous presidents of the Cambridge Union have included economist John Maynard Keynes, Robert Harris (novelist), politician Kenneth Harry Clarke, and author Arianna Huffington.

==History==

=== Genesis ===

The society&#x27;s origins lie in a dispute among the members of three pre-existing societies, one being a discussion group of which Lord Palmerston was a member. The inaugural meeting of the Cambridge Union was held on 13th February 1815, eight years before the Oxford Union was founded in 1823. However, in the political climate of the Hundred Days which ended the Napoleonic Wars, controversial debate topics generated suspicion among university officials who sought to suppress potentially radical thought among students. On 24th March 1817, university proctors burst into a meeting of the society and the Cambridge Union was temporarily shut down, forbidding future debates from taking place.

By 1821, the Union was permitted to resume debates under strict conditions, including that no political topics relevant to the last twenty years were to be discussed. In 1830, the Union regained its full freedom to debate all topics, excluding those of a strictly theological nature. 

The Cambridge Union&#x27;s Bridge Street premises () were designed by Alfred Waterhouse (who went on to design the Oxford Union Society&#x27;s building) and formally opened on 30 October 1866. An additional wing was added several decades later. The future radical Liberal politician, Sir Charles Dilke, was the President chiefly responsible for construction. Included among the building&#x27;s many rooms are the debating chamber, a dining room, bar, snooker room, the Keynes Library and various offices.

Cambridge escaped virtually undamaged from the widespread aerial bombardment during World War II, ostensibly due to a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; arrangement with Heidelberg, another historic university city. However, the Union&#x27;s building was hit during one attack in July 1942. The Union was the only building connected to the university to be directly hit during the war and the explosion caused extensive damage to the Union&#x27;s library. 

In March 1944, the 30th Army Corps commandeered the entire Union building for a week. It is rumoured that during this time the Union became one of a handful of buildings in Cambridge used to plan Operation Overlord and make preparations for the D-Day landings. 

=== Postwar Regeneration ===

Facing financial trouble and extensive rebuilding work, the Union launched a restoration appeal to its life members in October 1945, successfully raising over £3,000 by the end of the academic year. 

The postwar period saw a strong political atmosphere and a great many celebrated orators emerge from the Union, many of whom went on serve serve in senior government positions, notably Geoffrey Howe.

On Armistice Day 1947, the Cambridge Union hosted what was the first university debate to be broadcast. The debate on the motion &quot;That this House considers that the Conservative Party makes a poor Opposition and would, if returned to office, make an even poorer Government&quot; was broadcast live on the BBC Third Programme and drew a very large audience, concluding with the motion being defeated by 503 to 267. 

During this period, the society also endowed several honorary memberships upon significant figures, including the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh who attended a debate to accept his membership status in 1952. 

=== The &#x27;Cambridge Mafia&quot; ===

By 1960, floor speeches had become an integral part of Union debates, facilitating the emergence of a number of promising new faces. The 1960s is noted as a time in which a number of future cabinet ministers served as officers at the Union. The so-called Cambridge Mafia were a group of students who attended the university at roughly the same time, many of whom served as Union President, as well as Chairman of Cambridge University Conservative Association during their time at Cambridge. Several members of the group, including Norman Fowler, Michael Howard and Kenneth Clarke had attended Grammar schools, reflecting gradual changes in university admission at large. 

=== Women Members ===

Though women had been allowed into the Union to watch debates from the gallery since at least 1866, the admission of women as full members was a contentious issue. For much of its history, the Cambridge Union was an exclusively all-male club, along with being a debating society. In the 1920s, Viscount Ennismore of Magdalene tried three times to allow female guests to speak in debates. The issue continued to arise in the following decades, with Leonard Miall of St John&#x27;s proposing a motion in 1935 that certain &#x27;ladies of distinction&#x27; be permitted to speak in one debate per term, to no avail.

By the early 1960s, formal votes were held to amend the constitution to allow women as members. Although the majority voted in favour, they failed to meet the 2/3 majority required to make constitutional change. On one occasion, a female student gate-crashed a debate and was removed, with the whole incident being reported in the national press. An amendment was finally passed by 71 per cent in 1965 to admit women to full membership of the Union. Almost immediately, five women had joined as full Union members, with one declaring that &#x27;This is a wonderful night for all women in Cambridge&#x27;. However, until the first female president, the decision to admit women had a negative effect on membership in the immediate term.

In Michaelmas 1967, Ann Mallalieu of Newnham College became the first female president. The daughter of a Labour minister and ex-President of the Oxford Union, Mallalieu&#x27;s term in office generated significant national publicity and saw a record number of new members joining. It is notable that the Union admitted women as full members before any of the colleges, as well as other societies such as the Footlights, did.

=== Modern developments ===
The Union is legally a self-funded charity that owns and has full control over its private property and buildings in the Cambridge city centre. It enjoys strong relations with the university, and allows other student societies to hire rooms for a nominal cost. Guests are sometimes admitted to Union events for a charge.

After more than 200 years, the Cambridge Union is best known for its debates, which receive national and international media attention. The top members of its debating team compete internationally against other top debating societies. The program also includes special events, such as a comedy debate in collaboration with the Cambridge Footlights. The Union also organises talks by visiting speakers and a wide array of events throughout the academic year.

The Cambridge Union is sometimes confused with the Cambridge University Students&#x27; Union, the student representative body set up in 1971; consequently, the term &#x27;President of the Union&#x27; may cause confusion. Although the Cambridge Union has never functioned as a students&#x27; union in the modern sense, it did briefly affiliate to the UK&#x27;s National Union of Students in 1924.

In 2015 the Union celebrated its bicentenary; a committee composed of former and current Officers was put together to organise a range of events to mark the occasion. This included special debates, dinners and parties in Cambridge and, for the first time in its history, in London.

=== 2016 redevelopment project ===
In January 2015 the Union announced a £9.5m refurbishment project to begin in late 2016 to address major structural problems and to expand existing facilities, subject to approval by planners, to include a new Wine Bar on the ground floor and a Jazz &amp; Comedy Club in the basement (in the old home of the Cambridge Footlights). It also announced a plan to use the revenue generated from the new building to reduce membership fees to make the Union more accessible to students from lower income backgrounds, and to increase the size of its competitive debating activities for disadvantaged children and students.

The development was to be partially financed through the leasing of disused parts of its site to Trinity College in a deal worth £4.5 million. Planning permission was received in 2016, and a fundraising campaign to cover the remaining cost was to be launched on 11 March 2017 with a special debate between Jon Snow and Nick Robinson. Construction on the major redevelopment project was scheduled to begin in Michaelmas 2018.

==Membership==
The Cambridge Union receives no formal funding from the university and raises funds for event expenses and building maintenance through membership fees and sponsorship. 

Membership is now open to all students at the University of Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin University. Members are able to bring guests to certain functions provided that the guests would not be allowed to purchase membership. Social events and events organised by external bodies are occasionally open to the public, with discounts for Union members.

The Union launched online membership in late 2015, which allowed any student around the world access to live streams of events for an annual subscription.

=== Honorary members ===
The union awards honorary memberships to particularly distinguished individuals. Honorary members include:
* Raif Badawi
* Ensaf Haidar

* Anne, Princess Royal
* John Major
* Alfred Waterhouse

== Speakers and debates ==
The Union puts on a wide variety of events for its members, but is best known for its Thursday night debates and individual speaker events. In both of these, leading figures from public life are invited to discuss something of interest to the membership. One of the Union&#x27;s most famous debates in recent years was between Richard Dawkins and Rowan Williams in February 2013, on the motion, &#x27;This House Believes Religion has no place in the 21st Century&#x27;, which was rejected by the assembled members. The Union&#x27;s debates regarding religion have also created several controversial incidents, including in October 2014, when Peter Hitchens, speaking in favour of the motion &quot;‘This House Regrets the Rise of New Atheism’&quot;, appeared to break the rules of the House by physically intimidating Lord Desai after a heated exchange.

===1965 Baldwin-Buckley Debate===
Arguably the most notable debate to have been held at the Union was the 1965 Baldwin–Buckley debate. The debate, which was televised by the BBC, featured writer and civil rights activist James Baldwin and leading American conservative intellectual William F. Buckley. The motion under consideration was that &quot;‘This House Believes The American Dream is at the Expense of the American Negro’&quot; and the proposition won by a landslide. At the time the debate received extensive coverage on both sides of the Atlantic, and in subsequent years has come to be seen as a significant moment in the US Civil Rights Movement.

== Governance ==
The Cambridge Union is an organisation that was founded and is headed by students. Each term is planned and carried out by a mixture of elected officers and appointed student staff, with support from the organisation&#x27;s non-student staff and trustees. The governance of the Cambridge Union is mandated by its Constitution.

=== The Standing Committee ===

The Standing Committee (or &#x27;Voting Members&#x27;) is the Union&#x27;s primary managerial body of 15 members, which consists of the current President, Vice-President and Officers, the President-Elect and Officers-Elect, and the Debating Officers, Communications Officer and Treasurer. All Officers of the Union are elected by its membership on a termly basis, with the exception of the Vice-President, Treasurer, Communications Officer, Membership Officer and two Debating Officers, who are appointed on an annual basis.

Officers of the Union are elected a term in advance, allowing them to serve one term as an officer-elect to prepare for their following term in office. Termly elected officers serve a term (and its preceding vacation) as &quot;officer-elect&quot;, during which time they are members of Standing Committee.

=== Full Committee ===
During every term, the Standing Committee appoints a variety of positions within the Union. These range from the Secretary to positions in the Events Management, Publicity, Guest Liaison and Audio-Visual departments, among others. Collectively, these positions are referred to as &#x27;Full Committee&#x27;.

=== The Trustees ===

The Board of Trustees, currently chaired by Mohamed A. El-Erian, is responsible for overseeing the long-term development of the Union&#x27;s finances and property. Whilst the Trustees are not intimately involved with the day-to-day running of the Union, they maintain ultimate legal responsibility for the organisation, its assets and status as a registered charity. To maintain the link between the Student management and the Trustees, the President and the Vice President of the Union are traditionally appointed as Trustees for the duration of their term in office.

=== Review Committee ===
The Review Committee of the Cambridge Union is a committee of former Officers appointed by Standing Committee under the guidance of the Vice President. It is responsible for handling all disciplinary matters of the Union and may also be called upon to adjudicate on electoral malpractice. No member of Review Committee may serve as an elected officer for the duration of their term.

=== Staff ===
In addition to these posts the Union also maintains an employed staff consisting of a Bursar, responsible for overseeing the long-term health of the charity, Office Managers and a Bar Manager, amongst others. The Union also holds contracts for catering, cleaning, building maintenance, property management, IT services and legal advice.

Members of staff are employed by the Union&#x27;s subsidiary events company. The President, Vice-President, Bursar and other Trustees appointed on an ad-hoc basis serve as Directors of the company.

=== Past officers ===

Many of the Union&#x27;s former Officers have gone on to considerable personal success after their time involved in the society. Notable past Presidents and officers include:
* Jack Ashley
* Clare Balding
* Gavin Barwell
* Peter Bazalgette
* Karan Bilimoria
* Leon Brittan
* Rab Butler
* Vince Cable
* Kenneth Clarke
* Edward John Gambier
* Robert Harris
* Helene Hayman
* Michael Howard
* Arianna Huffington
* Douglas Hurd
* John Maynard Keynes
* Norman Lamont
* Charles Lysaght
* Andrew Mitchell
* Philip Noel-Baker
* James Peiris
* G. Godfrey Phillips
* Michael Ramsey
* Christopher Steele
* Gerald Strickland
* Adair Turner
* Spencer Horatio Walpole
In addition to the long list of real life distinguished individuals that served as officers of the Cambridge Union during their time in Cambridge, Will Bailey, a fictional character on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, a US television drama series, claimed to have been a &quot;former president of the Cambridge Union on a Marshall Scholarship&quot;, as well as MacKenzie McHale, a fictional character in the hit US series &quot;The Newsroom&quot;.

=== Constitution ===
The Cambridge Union was famous within the university for having a very long and complicated constitution; it is a common rumour that the constitution is longer than the entire Constitution of Canada. This was in fact untrue, but only just: a quick count puts the old Union constitution in question at 31,309 words while the complete Constitution of Canada is 31,575 words long. If the university&#x27;s rules on single transferable voting are included, then this Constitution was indeed longer than that of Canada. These rules are referenced within this old constitution, but are not contained.

== Recordings and streaming ==
=== YouTube ===
On 9 May 2011, the Union launched its online public video service &quot;CUS-Connect&quot;, whereby recordings of past events and interviews were uploaded for free viewing. These have since been transferred the Union&#x27;s YouTube channel titled &#x27;The Cambridge Union&#x27;. Before 2014, the Union only occasionally live-streamed popular events, with the first ever live stream held on 12 May 2011, in which Stephen Fry debated Radio 1 DJ Kissy Sell Out on the motion: &quot;This House believes that classical music is irrelevant to today&#x27;s youth&quot;.

=== Members&#x27; streaming service ===
As part of its bicentennial celebrations in 2015, the Union launched a permanent live streaming service, to be integrated with a new automatic multi-camera rig in the Main Chamber. The new service includes the ability for &quot;virtual&quot; attendees to contribute to debates via questions and comments to be read out on the floor of the Union. The streaming service is hosted on the Union&#x27;s website and is available only to members.

== Controversy ==
=== Hosting of speakers ===
The Cambridge Union, like its Oxford counterpart, has faced controversy over its choice of speakers. Protests have been arranged by students against the appearance of Universities Minister David Willetts, Government Minister Eric Pickles, during which the building was broken into, former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, French politician Marine Le Pen and Wikileaks Founder Julian Assange. In January 2015, the hosting of Germaine Greer caused a public row between the Union and the Cambridge Students&#x27; Union&#x27;s LGBT+ group, due to Greer&#x27;s alleged transmisogyny towards Rachael Padman.
 In June 2019, the hosting of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad attracted criticism from the Union of Jewish Students, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and several former Cambridge Union members including former President Adam Cannon due to the former&#x27;s anti-Semitic remarks. In February 2022, the Union hosted the Israel ambassador Tzipi Hotovely in a high-security, balloted event, resulting in protests and minor vandalism of the premises. The hosting of technology entrepreneur Peter Thiel saw pro-Palestinian protestors gather outside the Union building and several inturuptions during the talk.

Responding to these criticisms, the Union is often quoted as upholding the universal right to free speech, against the principles of No Platform passed by the National Union of Students and upheld by a few groups within Cambridge.

=== 2015 Counter-Terrorism Bill ===
Lobbying by former Union Presidents Lord Deben and Lord Lamont resulted in the specific exclusion of the Cambridge and Oxford Unions from the Government&#x27;s counter-terrorism bill, amid fears it could restrict free debate. Deben argued that the provisions within the bill would have prevented the hosting of British Union of Fascists&#x27; leader Oswald Mosley in the 1950s, concluding that the bill threatened &quot;an essential British value&quot;. The National Union of Students used the exclusion to argue that the passage of the Bill was too rapid and ill-thought out, whilst both the Oxford and Cambridge Union reaffirmed that they were not legally part of their respective Universities and thus were never subject to the bill in the first place.

Strong opposition to the bill from Liberal Democrats and senior Conservative peers eventually resulted in the shelving of provisions regarding Universities&#x27; until after the 2015 General Election. The Counter Terrorism and Security Act 2015 eventually clarified that higher education institutions must retain particular regard to the duty to ensure freedom of speech and the importance of academic freedom within university societies, although it is unclear whether this applies to the Union.

=== Referendum on Julian Assange ===
The union called a referendum on the hosting of Julian Assange on 22 October 2015, arguing that his residency in the Ecuadorian Embassy meant he was outside the jurisdiction of UK law, and thus required the consultation of its members considering a lack of past precedent. The referendum was more widely viewed as an opinion poll on the union&#x27;s refusal to &quot;no platform&quot; speakers. It passed with 76.9% of the vote. Turnout was 1463.

<doc id="344173" wikidata="Q2140940" url="?curid=344173" title="Rotational energy">
<text>Rotational energy or angular kinetic energy is kinetic energy due to the rotation of an object and is part of its total kinetic energy. Looking at rotational energy separately around an object&#x27;s axis of rotation, the following dependence on the object&#x27;s moment of inertia is observed:
formula_1
where

The mechanical work required for or applied during rotation is the torque times the rotation angle. The instantaneous power of an angularly accelerating body is the torque times the angular velocity. For free-floating (unattached) objects, the axis of rotation is commonly around its center of mass.

Note the close relationship between the result for rotational energy and the energy held by linear (or translational) motion:
formula_2

In the rotating system, the moment of inertia, &quot;I&quot;, takes the role of the mass, &quot;m&quot;, and the angular velocity, formula_3, takes the role of the linear velocity, &quot;v&quot;. The rotational energy of a rolling cylinder varies from one half of the translational energy (if it is massive) to the same as the translational energy (if it is hollow).

An example is the calculation of the rotational kinetic energy of the Earth. As the Earth has a sidereal rotation period of 23.93 hours, it has an angular velocity of . The Earth has a moment of inertia, &quot;I&quot; = . Therefore, it has a rotational kinetic energy of .

Part of the Earth&#x27;s rotational energy can also be tapped using tidal power. Additional friction of the two global tidal waves creates energy in a physical manner, infinitesimally slowing down Earth&#x27;s angular velocity &quot;ω&quot;. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, this process transfers angular momentum to the Moon&#x27;s orbital motion, increasing its distance from Earth and its orbital period (see tidal locking for a more detailed explanation of this process).

It is endemic to the Western Ghats in India. Although the adult frog was formally described in October 2003, the juvenile form of the species was described earlier in 1917.

==History of the discovery==
The species was described from specimens collected in the Idukki district of Kerala by S.D. Biju from the Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute in Palode, India, from the &quot;Vrije Universiteit Brussel&quot; (Free University of Brussels), in 2003. However, it was already well known to the local people and several earlier documented specimens and publications had been ignored by the authors in the 2003 paper that describes the genus and species.
&quot;Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis&quot; closest living relatives are considered to be the Sooglossidae, only known in the Seychelles, an island chain in the Indian Ocean.

==Name==
The scientific name &quot;Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis&quot; is a Latinized portmanteau of the Sanskrit () for &quot;nose&quot;, Greek () for &quot;frog&quot;, and Sahyadri, the native name for the Western Ghats which forms the purple frog&#x27;s natural habitat.

One of its common names, the purple pig-nosed frog, also makes reference to the elongated morphology of its snout, which is well adapted to the acquisition of fossorial termites.

==Description==

The body of &quot;Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis&quot; appears robust and bloated and is relatively rounded compared to other more dorsoventrally flattened frogs. Their flattened body assists them to cling to submerged rocks and boulders which essentially helps them fight strong currents, allowing them to remain near stream banks where they typically reside. Its arms and legs splay out in the standard anuran body form. Compared to other frogs, &quot;N. sahyadrensis&quot; has a small head and an unusual pointed snout. Adults are typically dark purplish-grey in color. Males are about a third of the length of females. The specimen with which the species was originally described was long from the tip of the snout to the vent. Tadpoles of the species had been described in 1917 by Nelson Annandale and C. R. Narayan Rao as having oral suckers that allowed them to live in torrential streams. Suckers are also present in rheophilic fishes of genera such as &quot;Glyptothorax&quot;, &quot;Travancoria&quot;, &quot;Homaloptera&quot;, and &quot;Bhavania&quot;, adaptations that are the result of convergent evolution. Some of these fishes co-occur with &quot;Nasikabatrachus&quot; tadpoles in the hill streams. Its vocalization is a drawn-out harsh call that sounds similar to a chicken clucking. Males of this species exhibit the unique behavior of calling from under a thin layer of soil. Some other burrowing frogs (&quot;Myobatrachus gouldii&quot; and &quot;Arenophyrne rotunda&quot;) are known to do this, but these frogs have also been observed to call from the surface, while &quot;N. sahyadrensis&quot; has not. The frogs may switch to headfirst burrowing due to their wedge-shaped skull and other shaped limbs.

==Distribution==
Earlier thought to be restricted to the south of the Palghat Gap in the Western Ghats, additional records have extended its known range farther north of the gap. The species is now known to be quite widely distributed in the Western Ghats, ranging from the Camel&#x27;s Hump Hill Range in the north, all the way to the northernmost portions of the Agasthyamalai Hill Range in the south.

==Ecology==
Like many frogs, the Indian purple frog is well-adapted to its subterranean environment. The frog spends most of its life underground and surfaces only during the monsoon, for a period of two weeks, for mating. With few field scientists out in the field during the rainy season, the species was discovered and studied only in recent times. Males emerge to call beside temporary rainwater streams. They mount females and grip them (amplexus) along the vertebral column. The females then carry the male frogs on their backs to the egg laying sites which are usually crevices along the fast-flowing streams. Around 3000 eggs are laid in a rock pool and the tadpoles metamorphose after around 100 days.


Unlike many other burrowing species of frogs that emerge and feed above the ground, this species has been found to forage underground, feeding mainly on termites using its tongue and a special buccal groove.

In 2015, tadpoles of the species were discovered to be traditionally consumed by tribal communities.

The major threat to these amphibians in the Western Ghats of India is caused by the alteration of natural habitats by an ever-increasing human population, resulting in large areas being converted for settlement and agricultural use. Recent studies have shown frog utilization to be one of the major threats, which include the utilization of frogs for food, traditional medicine such as a cure for burns, asthma, and other lung ailments, research purposes, and pet trade has also been considered a major contributor to their decline. Tadpole-harvesting was prevalent in the monsoon season during July–September every year. The Nadukani-Moolamattom-Kulamaav tribal people have developed an indigenous method for collecting these uniquely adapted suctorial tadpoles. Usually, about 2–5 individuals would participate in each harvesting event.
The Purple Frog growth also depends on the velocity of the water. When the velocity of water increased, there was a greater number of tadpoles than the lower velocity of water areas in both streams. The tadpoles also had constant activity in the streams as well. They also have a huge influence on the number of tadpoles in the environments they are in.
Due to increasing population in India where the purple frogs are native to, large open areas where purple frogs typically reside are being reconstructed for agricultural and settlement purposes. This has led to almost 40% of all amphibians in the Western Ghats of India going extinct, due to a lack of data the remaining amphibians are mostly unresearched with no knowledge of ecology, biology, defining characteristics, threats faced (Thomas &amp; Biju, 2015).

The building of dams during monsoon season is affecting the loss of microhabitat that is needed for survival of the purple frog. The harvesting of tadpoles by indigenous communities also contributes to their endangerment.

<text>Nasikabatrachus is a genus of frogs. It is presently treated as the only genus in the family Nasikabatrachidae, though previously it was included in the family Sooglossidae. Two species are recognized, &quot;Nasikabatrachus bhupathi&quot; and &quot;Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis&quot;, both endemic to southwestern India. Both Nasikabatrachidae and Sooglossidae are thought to be the only extant families of the superfamily Sooglossoidea.

With its closest relatives in the Seychelles, &quot;Nasikabatrachus&quot; is thought to have evolved separately since the end of the Cretaceous. Its discovery added to the evidence that Madagascar and the Seychelles separated from the Indian landmass sometime well after the breakup of Gondwana had started.

==Reproduction==
The purple frog is an explosive seasonal breeder species which completes its development in ephemeral streams. Its breeding activities typically take place during the months of April and May, which is during the pre-monsoon shower.

<doc id="344181" wikidata="Q15988" url="?curid=344181" title="Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg">
<text>Jean (Jean Benoît Guillaume Robert Antoine Louis Marie Adolphe Marc d&#x27;Aviano; 5 January 1921 – 23 April 2019) was the Grand Duke of Luxembourg from 1964 until his abdication in 2000. He was the first Grand Duke of Luxembourg of French agnatic descent.

Jean was the eldest son of Grand Duchess Charlotte and Prince Felix. Jean&#x27;s primary education was initially in Luxembourg, before attending Ampleforth College in England. In 1938, he was officially named Hereditary Grand Duke as heir-apparent to the throne of Luxembourg. While Luxembourg was occupied by Germans during the Second World War, the grand ducal family was abroad in exile. Jean studied at the Université Laval in Quebec City. Jean later volunteered to join the British army&#x27;s Irish Guards in 1942, and after graduating from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, received his commission in 1943. He participated in the Normandy landings and the Battle for Caen, and joined the Allied forces in the liberation of Luxembourg. From 1984 until 2000, he was Colonel of the Regiment of the Irish Guards.

On 9 April 1953, Jean married Princess Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium, with whom he had five children. On 12 November 1964, Grand Duchess Charlotte abdicated and Jean succeeded her as Grand Duke of Luxembourg. He then reigned for 36 years before he himself abdicated on 7 October 2000 and was succeeded by his son, Grand Duke Henri.

==Early life==
===Birth and family===
Jean was born on 5 January 1921 at Berg Castle in central Luxembourg, the first child of Grand Duchess Charlotte and of Prince Félix. He was born just two years after his mother&#x27;s accession as Grand Duchess, which took place after her elder sister Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde had been forced to abdicate in 1919 when she was accused of being pro-German during the First World War. As the eldest child of the reigning Grand Duchess, he was heir apparent from birth. Among his godparents was Pope Benedict XV, who gave him his second name.

===Childhood and education===
Prince Jean was raised with his five siblings, and grew up primarily at his parents&#x27; residence, Berg Castle, in the town of Colmar-Berg. The young prince attended primary school in Luxembourg, where he continued the initial stage of secondary education. From 1934 to 1938, he completed secondary school at Ampleforth College, a Roman Catholic boarding school in the United Kingdom. Upon reaching maturity, on 5 January 1939 he was styled &#x27;Hereditary Grand Duke&#x27;, recognising his status as heir apparent.

== Hereditary Grand Duke ==
=== Second World War ===
Just a few months later, World War II broke out. Although the country declared itself neutral and unarmed, the Luxembourgers knew from their World War I experience that their country&#x27;s neutrality would not necessarily protect them. On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded Luxembourg, beginning a four-year occupation. Having been warned of an imminent invasion, the Grand Ducal Family escaped the previous night, together with the government of Luxembourg.

At first, they sought refuge in Paris, before fleeing France only weeks later, after receiving transit visas to Portugal from the Portuguese consul Aristides de Sousa Mendes, in June 1940. They arrived at Vilar Formoso on 23 June 1940. After travelling through Coimbra and Lisbon, the family first stayed in Cascais, in Casa de Santa Maria, owned by Manuel Espírito Santo, who was then the honorary consul for Luxembourg in Portugal. By July they had moved to Monte Estoril, staying at the Chalet Posser de Andrade. On 10 July 1940, Prince Jean, together with his father Prince Félix, his siblings, Princess Elisabeth, Princess Marie Adelaide, Princess Marie Gabriele, Prince Charles and Princess Alix, the nanny Justine Reinard and the chauffeur Eugène Niclou, along with his wife Joséphine, boarded the &quot;S.S. Trenton&quot; headed for New York City, where they sought refuge in the United States, renting an estate in Brookville, New York. The grand duchess travelled from Portugal to London, where a government in exile was set up, before joining her family in North America. Jean studied Law and Political Science at Université Laval, Quebec City.
He joined the British Army as a volunteer in the Irish Guards in November 1942. After receiving officer training at the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, Jean was commissioned as a lieutenant on 30 July 1943, before being promoted to captain in 1944. He landed in Normandy on 11 June 1944, and took part in the Battle for Caen and the liberation of Brussels. On 10 September 1944, he took part in the liberation of Luxembourg before moving on to Arnhem and the invasion of Germany. He relinquished his commission in the British Army on 26 June 1947. From 1984 until his abdication, he served as Colonel of the Regiment of the Irish Guards, often riding in uniform behind Queen Elizabeth II during the Trooping the Colour.

=== Marriage ===
In October 1952, Jean was officially engaged to Princess Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium, his third cousin, the only daughter of King Leopold III of the Belgians and his first wife, Princess Astrid of Sweden. There had been speculation that the marriage was arranged to improve relations between Luxembourg and Belgium but it soon became apparent that a love match was blooming between two longtime friends.

They were married in Luxembourg on 9 April 1953, first in the Hall of Ceremonies at the Grand Ducal Palace, later in Luxembourg&#x27;s Notre-Dame Cathedral. The marriage put an end to the tensions between Luxembourg and Belgium which arose from 1918 to 1920 when there had been a threat of annexation. 

The newlyweds were given Betzdorf Castle in Betzdorf in the eastern part of the grand duchy as their residence. The couple had five children, 22 grandchildren and 28 great-grandchildren.

Together with his wife, his parents and his sister Elisabeth, Jean took part in the ship tour organized by Queen Frederica and her husband King Paul of Greece in 1954, which became known as the “Cruise of the Kings” and was attended by over 100 royals from all over Europe.

==Reign==
Jean was named Lieutenant-Representative of the Grand Duchess on 28 April 1961. He became Grand Duke when his mother, Grand Duchess Charlotte, abdicated on 12 November 1964. The same day, he was made a General of the Armed Forces of Luxembourg.

From the beginning of his reign, Grand Duke Jean&#x27;s priorities included the well-being of his people and the completion of European unity. In the words of President Georges Pompidou of France, &quot;If Europe had to choose a hereditary president, it would certainly be the Grand Duke of Luxembourg&quot;. Indeed, during his reign Grand Duke Jean saw Luxembourg transformed from a minor industrial contributor into an international financial centre. In 1986, he was honoured with the Charlemagne Prize in Aachen for his efforts towards European integration.

The Grand Duke&#x27;s reign was one of the most prosperous periods in the history of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The degree of stability in the country&#x27;s politics, economy and social life was without precedent, thanks in part to the influence of the Grand Duke and his wife. He abdicated on 7 October 2000, and was succeeded on the throne by his son Henri.

Luxembourg&#x27;s museum of modern art Mudam was officially named &quot;Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne Grand-Duc Jean&quot; to commemorate his reign which lasted 36 years. It was inaugurated in his presence in July 2006.

==Later life==
===Retirement===

In the summer of 2002, Grand Duke Jean and Grand Duchess Joséphine Charlotte took up residence at Fischbach Castle. After his wife died in January 2005, the Grand Duke continued to live there alone. On 27 December 2016, Grand Duke Jean was hospitalized due to bronchitis and was discharged from hospital on 4 January 2017, a day before he celebrated his 96th birthday.

===Death===
Surrounded by his family, Grand Duke Jean died at 00.25 CEST on 23 April 2019 at the age of 98 after he had been hospitalized for a pulmonary infection. 
He had become the world&#x27;s oldest living monarch or former monarch by the time of his death.

His funeral was held on Saturday, 4 May at the Notre-Dame Cathedral, Luxembourg after a period of mourning of 12 days.

===Tributes===
Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission and former Prime Minister of Luxembourg, described Jean&#x27;s death as &quot;a great loss for the Grand Duchy and for Europe&quot;. He added, &quot;Like all the people of Luxembourg, I had great esteem for this man of commitment, kindness and courage.&quot;

Luxembourg&#x27;s Prime Minister, Xavier Bettel, alluded to his service in the Second World War: &quot;Grand Duke Jean fought for our freedom, for our independence and for the unity of our country and we will always be grateful. A family man left us today. A great statesman, a hero, an example – and a very beloved and gracious man.&quot;

Tributes followed from the Belgian royal family, commenting &quot;His courage, his dignity and his high sense of duty will remain as an example... The whole of Belgium shares the grief of the Luxembourg people.&quot;

In their tribute, the Dutch royal family mentioned &quot;the friendship and warmth he radiated&quot;, adding &quot;With his thoughtfulness and humanity, he added to calm and confidence in his country and Europe.&quot;

In their tribute, the British royal family said that the Grand Duke will be &quot;missed, both inside and outside Luxembourg&quot;.

In the tribute from the Romanian Royal Family via a post on their websites, they mentioned that &quot;The entire Royal Family of Romania is alongside the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in these sad and painful moments&quot;; also written was their very close relations (via Queen Anne who was a paternal first cousin of his) as well as &quot;a lifetime of friendship&quot;; the head of the family, Crown Princess Margareta, sent a letter of condolences to her cousin, Grand Duke Henri.

The president of the International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach paid tribute to Grand Duke Jean who had joined the IOC in 1946 and had been an honorary member since 1998. &quot;He was always a very calm and well-balanced person who was highly respected by the entire Olympic Movement because of his integrity... The IOC will always hold him in the highest honour and with the greatest respect.&quot;

Jean renounced the titles of the House of Bourbon-Parma for himself and his family in 1986. This decree was however repealed by another decree on 21 September 1995.

The &quot;Arrêté Grand-Ducal&quot; (Grand Ducal decree) of 21 September 1995 established that the title of Prince/Princesse de Luxembourg is reserved for the children of the sovereign and the heir to the throne. It also stated that the descendants in male lineage of the sovereign should be styled as Royal Highnesses and titled Prince/Princess of Nassau and that the descendants of unapproved marriages should be styled as Count/Countess of Nassau.

==Ancestry==
===Patrilineal descent===
Patrilineal descent is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations - which means that if Grand Duke Jean were to choose an historically accurate house name it would be Robertian, as all his male-line ancestors have been of that house.

Jean is a member of the House of Bourbon-Parma, a sub-branch of the House of Bourbon-Spain, itself originally a branch of the House of Bourbon, and thus of the Capetian dynasty and of the Robertians.

Jean&#x27;s patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son. It follows the Dukes of Parma as well as the Kings of Spain, France, and Navarre. The line can be traced back more than 1,200 years from Robert of Hesbaye to the present day, through Kings of France &amp; Navarre, Spain and Two-Sicilies, Dukes of Parma and Grand-Dukes of Luxembourg, Princes of Orléans and Emperors of Brazil. It is one of the oldest in Europe.

<doc id="344195" wikidata="Q187419" url="?curid=344195" title="Living fossil">
<text>A living fossil is a deprecated term for an extant taxon that phenotypically resembles related species known only from the fossil record. To be considered a living fossil, the fossil species must be old relative to the time of origin of the extant clade. Living fossils commonly are of species-poor lineages, but they need not be. While the body plan of a living fossil remains superficially similar, it is never the same species as the remote relatives it resembles, because genetic drift would inevitably change its chromosomal structure.

Living fossils exhibit stasis (also called &quot;bradytely&quot;) over geologically long time scales. Popular literature may wrongly claim that a &quot;living fossil&quot; has undergone no significant evolution since fossil times, with practically no molecular evolution or morphological changes. Scientific investigations have repeatedly discredited such claims.

The minimal superficial changes to living fossils are mistakenly declared as an absence of evolution, but they are examples of stabilizing selection, which is an evolutionary process—and perhaps the dominant process of morphological evolution.

The term is currently deprecated among paleontologists and evolutionary biologists.

==Characteristics==

Living fossils have two main characteristics, although some have a third:
# Living organisms that are members of a taxon that has remained recognizable in the fossil record over an unusually long time span.
# They show little morphological divergence, whether from early members of the lineage, or among extant species. 
# They tend to have little taxonomic diversity.
The first two are required for recognition as a living fossil; some authors also require the third, others merely note it as a frequent trait.

Such criteria are neither well-defined nor clearly quantifiable, but modern methods for analyzing evolutionary dynamics can document the distinctive tempo of stasis. Lineages that exhibit stasis over very short time scales are not considered living fossils; what is poorly-defined is the time scale over which the morphology must persist for that lineage to be recognized as a living fossil.

The term &quot;living fossil&quot; is much misunderstood in popular media in particular, in which it often is used meaninglessly. In professional literature the expression seldom appears and must be used with far more caution, although it has been used inconsistently.

One example of a concept that could be confused with &quot;living fossil&quot; is that of a &quot;Lazarus taxon&quot;, but the two are not equivalent; a Lazarus taxon (whether a single species or a group of related species) is one that suddenly reappears, either in the fossil record or in nature, as if the fossil had &quot;come to life again&quot;. In contrast to &quot;Lazarus taxa&quot;, a living fossil in most senses is a species or lineage that has undergone exceptionally little change throughout a long fossil record, giving the impression that the extant taxon had remained identical through the entire fossil and modern period. Because of the mathematical inevitability of genetic drift, though, the DNA of the modern species is necessarily different from that of its distant, similar-looking ancestor. They almost certainly would not be able to cross-reproduce, and are not the same species.

The average species turnover time, meaning the time between when a species first is established and when it finally disappears, varies widely among phyla, but averages about 2–3million years. A living taxon that had long been thought to be extinct could be called a Lazarus taxon once it was discovered to be still extant. A dramatic example was the order Coelacanthiformes, of which the genus &quot;Latimeria&quot; was found to be extant in 1938. About that there is little debate – however, whether &quot;Latimeria&quot; resembles early members of its lineage sufficiently closely to be considered a living fossil as well as a Lazarus taxon has been denied by some authors in recent years.

Coelacanths disappeared from the fossil record some 80million years ago (in the upper Cretaceous period) and, to the extent that they exhibit low rates of morphological evolution, extant species qualify as living fossils. It must be emphasised that this criterion reflects fossil evidence, and is totally independent of whether the taxa had been subject to selection at all, which all living populations continuously are, whether they remain genetically unchanged or not.

This apparent stasis, in turn, gives rise to a great deal of confusion – for one thing, the fossil record seldom preserves much more than the general morphology of a specimen. To determine much about its physiology is seldom possible; not even the most dramatic examples of living fossils can be expected to be without changes, no matter how persistently constant their fossils and the extant specimens might seem. To determine much about noncoding DNA is hardly ever possible, but even if a species were hypothetically unchanged in its physiology, it is to be expected from the very nature of the reproductive processes, that its non-functional genomic changes would continue at more-or-less standard rates. Hence, a fossil lineage with apparently constant morphology need not imply equally constant physiology, and certainly neither implies any cessation of the basic evolutionary processes such as natural selection, nor reduction in the usual rate of change of the noncoding DNA.

Some living fossils are taxa that were known from palaeontological fossils before living representatives were discovered. The most famous examples of this are:
* Coelacanthiform fishes (2 species)
* &quot;Metasequoia&quot;, the dawn redwood discovered in a remote Chinese valley (1 species)
* Glypheoid lobsters (2 species)
* Mymarommatid wasps (10 species)
* Eomeropid scorpionflies (1 species)
* Jurodid beetles (1 species)
* Soft sea urchins (59 species)

All the above include taxa that originally were described as fossils but now are known to include still-extant species.

Other examples of living fossils are single living species that have no close living relatives, but are survivors of large and widespread groups in the fossil record. For example:
* &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot;
* &quot;Syntexis libocedrii&quot;, the cedar wood wasp
* Dinoflagellates (typified on coccoid dinocysts: occasionally calcareous cell remnants)

All of these were described from fossils before later being found alive.

The fact that a living fossil is a surviving representative of an archaic lineage does not imply that it must retain all the &quot;primitive&quot; features (plesiomorphies) of its ancestral lineage. Although it is common to say that living fossils exhibit &quot;morphological stasis&quot;, stasis, in the scientific literature, does not mean that any species is strictly identical to its ancestor, much less remote ancestors.

Some living fossils are relicts of formerly diverse and morphologically varied lineages, but not all survivors of ancient lineages necessarily are regarded as living fossils. See for example the uniquely and highly autapomorphic oxpeckers, which appear to be the only survivors of an ancient lineage related to starlings and mockingbirds.

== Evolution and living fossils ==
The term &quot;living fossil&quot; is usually reserved for species or larger clades that are exceptional for their lack of morphological diversity and their exceptional conservatism, and several hypotheses could explain morphological stasis on a geologically long time-scale. Early analyses of evolutionary rates emphasized the persistence of a taxon rather than rates of evolutionary change. Contemporary studies instead analyze rates and modes of phenotypic evolution, but most have focused on clades that are thought to be adaptive radiations rather than on those thought to be living fossils. Thus, very little is presently known about the evolutionary mechanisms that produce living fossils or how common they might be. Some recent studies have documented exceptionally low rates of ecological and phenotypic evolution despite rapid speciation. This has been termed a &quot;non-adaptive radiation&quot; referring to diversification not accompanied by adaptation into various significantly different niches. Such radiations are explanation for groups that are morphologically conservative. Persistent adaptation within an adaptive zone is a common explanation for morphological stasis. The subject of very low evolutionary rates, however, has received much less attention in the recent literature than that of high rates.

Living fossils are not expected to exhibit exceptionally low rates of molecular evolution, and some studies have shown that they do not. For example, on tadpole shrimp (&quot;Triops&quot;), one article notes, &quot;Our work shows that organisms with conservative body plans are constantly radiating, and presumably, adapting to novel conditions... I would favor retiring the term &#x27;living fossil&#x27; altogether, as it is generally misleading.&quot; Some scientists instead prefer a new term stabilomorph, being defined as &quot;an effect of a specific formula of adaptative strategy among organisms whose taxonomic status does not exceed genus-level. A high effectiveness of adaptation significantly reduces the need for differentiated phenotypic variants in response to environmental changes and provides for long-term evolutionary success.&quot;

The question posed by several recent studies pointed out that the morphological conservatism of coelacanths is not supported by paleontological data. In addition, it was shown recently that studies concluding that a slow rate of molecular evolution is linked to morphological conservatism in coelacanths are biased by the &quot;a priori&quot; hypothesis that these species are &#x27;living fossils&#x27;. Accordingly, the genome stasis hypothesis is challenged by the recent finding that the genome of the two extant coelacanth species &quot;L. chalumnae&quot; and &quot;L. menadoensis&quot; contain multiple species-specific insertions, indicating transposable element recent activity and contribution to post-speciation genome divergence. Such studies, however, challenge only a genome stasis hypothesis, not the hypothesis of exceptionally low rates of phenotypic evolution.

==History==
The term was coined by Charles Darwin in his &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; from 1859, when discussing &quot;Ornithorhynchus&quot; (the platypus) and &quot;Lepidosiren&quot; (the South American lungfish):

===Other definitions===

==== Long-enduring ====

A living taxon that lived through a large portion of geologic time.

The Australian lungfish (&quot;Neoceratodus fosteri&quot;), also known as the Queensland lungfish, is an example of an organism that meets this criterion. Fossils identical to modern specimens have been dated at over 100million years old. Modern Queensland lungfish have existed as a species for almost 30million years. The contemporary nurse shark has existed for more than 112million years, making this species one of the oldest, if not actually the oldest extant vertebrate species.

==== Resembles ancient species ====
A living taxon morphologically and/or physiologically resembling a fossil taxon through a large portion of geologic time (morphological stasis).

==== Retains many ancient traits ====
A living taxon with many characteristics believed to be primitive. This is a more neutral definition. However, it does not make it clear whether the taxon is truly old, or it simply has many plesiomorphies. Note that, as mentioned above, the converse may hold for true living fossil taxa; that is, they may possess a great many derived features (autapomorphies), and not be particularly &quot;primitive&quot; in appearance.

==== Relict population ====
Any one of the above three definitions, but also with a relict distribution in refuges.

Some paleontologists believe that living fossils with large distributions (such as &quot;Triops cancriformis&quot;) are not real living fossils. In the case of &quot;Triops cancriformis&quot; (living from the Triassic until now), the Triassic specimens lost most of their appendages (mostly only carapaces remain), and they have not been thoroughly examined since 1938.

==== Low diversity ====
Any of the first three definitions, but the clade also has a low taxonomic diversity (low diversity lineages).

Oxpeckers are morphologically somewhat similar to starlings due to shared plesiomorphies, but are uniquely adapted to feed on parasites and blood of large land mammals, which has always obscured their relationships. This lineage forms part of a radiation that includes Sturnidae and Mimidae, but appears to be the most ancient of these groups. Biogeography strongly suggests that oxpeckers originated in eastern Asia and only later arrived in Africa, where they now have a relict distribution.

The two living species thus seem to represent an entirely extinct and (as Passerida go) rather ancient lineage, as certainly as this can be said in the absence of actual fossils. The latter is probably due to the fact that the oxpecker lineage never occurred in areas where conditions were good for fossilization of small bird bones, but of course, fossils of ancestral oxpeckers may one day turn up enabling this theory to be tested.

=== Operational definition ===
An operational definition was proposed in 2017, where a &#x27;living fossil&#x27; lineage has a slow rate of evolution and occurs close to the middle of morphological variation (the centroid of morphospace) among related taxa (i.e. a species is morphologically conservative among relatives). The scientific accuracy of the morphometric analyses used to classify tuatara as a living fossil under this definition have been criticised however, which prompted a rebuttal from the original authors.

==Examples==
Some of these are informally known as &quot;living fossils&quot;.

===Bacteria===
* Cyanobacteria – the oldest living fossils, emerging 3.5 billion years ago. They exist as single bacteria or in the form of stromatolites, layered rocks produced by colonies of cyanobacteria.

** &quot;Magnolia –&quot; a genus whose form is little changed since the earliest days of flowering plant evolution in the Cretaceous and possibly earlier
** &quot;Trapa&quot; – water caltrops, seeds, and leaves of numerous extinct species are known all the way back to the Cretaceous.
** &quot;Nelumbo&quot; – several species of lotus flower are known exclusively from fossils dating back to the Cretaceous.
** &quot;Sassafras&quot; – many fossils of sassafras are known from the late cretaceous through the late pleistocene.
** &quot;Platanus&quot; Sycamore fossils are very abundant throughout the northern hemisphere with several extinct species. Sycamore leaves and fruits are quite common in plant fossils. Sycamores exhibit many primitive features as well such their exfoliating bark which is a result of a lack of elasticity. Platanus Occidentalis fossils are known from the pliocene and the pleistocene in North America.
** &quot;Nyssa&quot; Blackgum fossils go way back to the late cretaceous period. Many extinct species are recorded as well.
** &quot;Liriodendron&quot; Fossils from the cretaceous and the tertiary period are found with many extinct species.

Liriodendron Tulipifera fossils dating from the pliocene and pleistocene were discovered at the chowan formation in North Carolina.
** &quot;Liquidambar&quot; Sweetgums appeared during the mid-late cretaceous and several extinct species are found throughout Asia Europe and North America. The genus was once widespread in europe and asia especially during the miocene. The American Sweetgum is a living fossil itself since fossil specimens dating from the miocene, pliocene and pleistocene were discovered in the eastern united states

<text>Quake 4 is a 2005 first-person shooter video game developed by Raven Software and published by Activision. It is the fourth title in the &quot;Quake&quot; series, after the multiplayer &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, and a sequel to &quot;Quake II&quot;. Raven Software collaborated with id Software, who supervised the development of the game as well as provided the id Tech 4 engine upon which it was built. The game has an increased emphasis on single-player gameplay compared to previous installments; its multiplayer mode does not support playable bots.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Quake 4&quot; has a stronger emphasis on single-player than its predecessor, which emphasizes multiplayer gameplay, and features a campaign that continues the story of &quot;Quake II&quot;. However, it lacks the bot matchmaking offered in &quot;Quake III&quot; without the use of third-party mods.

Multiplayer modes are Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Tourney, Capture the Flag, Arena CTF and DeadZone. Players at QuakeCon reported the multiplayer gameplay to include elements similar to those in previous &quot;Quake&quot; games such as strafe-jumping or rocket jumping. Notable additions to play are the ability to send shots through the teleporters and the advancement of the game physics provided by the new technology including the ability to bounce grenades and napalm fire off of jump-pads.

Like the previous &quot;Quake&quot; games, the multiplayer mode has a client-server architecture. The network code has been altered from &quot;Doom 3&quot;, allowing for larger numbers of players on each server; &quot;Doom 3&quot; has a four-player restriction, whereas &quot;Quake 4&quot; has a standard 16 player limit.

The player movement in &quot;Quake 4&quot; is similar to that in &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; and &quot;Quake Live&quot;, but with the additions of ramp jumping and crouch slides. Crouch slides give players the ability to maintain speed by sliding around corners. Ramp jumps allow players to gain extra height from jumping as they reach the top of an inclined object, which while present in the original &quot;Quake&quot; and &quot;Quake II&quot; was not included in &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;.

==Plot==

The &quot;Quake 4&quot; single player mode continues the story of &quot;Quake II&quot; by pitting the player against cyborg alien race known as the Strogg. The game follows the story of a Marine Corporal named Matthew Kane who is joining the elite Rhino Squad. Following the success of the protagonist of &quot;Quake II&quot; in destroying the Strogg&#x27;s leader, the Makron, Rhino Squad is tasked with spearheading the mission to secure the aliens&#x27; home planet Stroggos. In the course of the invasion, the squad ship is shot down and crashes in the middle of a battle zone, separating Kane from his companions. Kane rejoins his scattered team members and partakes in the assault against the Strogg.

After performing a number of tasks, such as destroying and capturing Strogg aircraft hangars and defense systems, Kane and his remaining squad members make it to the &quot;USS Hannibal&quot;. There they are given their next mission: infiltrating one of the Strogg&#x27;s central communication hubs, the Tetranode, with an electromagnetic pulse bomb in the hope that it will put the main Strogg Nexus in disarray. Kane is tasked with defending the mission convoy, which takes heavy casualties. After many setbacks, including the destruction of the EMP device by a Strogg ambush, Kane is left to complete the mission, assisted only by Private Johann Strauss (Peter Stormare) and Lance Corporal Nikolai &quot;Sledge&quot; Slidjonovitch (Dimitri Diatchenko). Strauss figures out a way to destroy the core by shutting down its coolant systems. As Kane reaches the entrance to the Tetranode, however, he is greeted by two rocket-equipped network guardians, as well as the newly constructed Makron, which easily defeats Kane and knocks him unconscious.

When Kane awakens, he finds himself strapped to a conveyor belt in the Strogg &quot;Medical Facilities&quot;, a structure used for turning those captured and killed by the aliens either into protein food or additional Strogg units. In a long and gruesome first-person cutscene, Kane is taken through this &quot;stroggification&quot; process which violently replaces much of his anatomy with bio-mechanical parts. Before the final controlling neurochip implanted in his brain can be activated, though, Rhino Squad bursts into the facility and rescues Kane. After escaping through the Strogg medical facility and Waste Disposal plant, fighting off zombie-like half-stroggified humans along the way, Kane is forced to combat his former commander, Lieutenant Voss (Michael Gannon), who has been fully stroggified into a powerful mechanized monster but retains his own consciousness long enough to warn Kane. After defeating this threat, Kane and the remaining marines finally make it back to the &quot;Hannibal&quot;.

The commanders realize that Kane&#x27;s Strogg physiology has opened up new possibilities for defeating the Strogg, as he can be used to infiltrate locations and teleportation areas previously impenetrable and/or fatally harmful to human forces. The new plan is to directly target the Strogg Nexus Core, a huge centralized brain-like structure which controls the alien forces. The Marines are tasked with infiltrating the three data towers adjacent to the Nexus: Data Storage, Processing, and Networking. There, they will deactivate the Nexus&#x27; shield and power up the teleporter used to access the Nexus and send Kane in. Once inside, Kane will travel to the center of the Nexus to destroy the Core Brain and its guardian.

After infiltrating the facility and realigning the data nodes powering the teleporter, and destroying its fearsome &quot;Guardian&quot; creature, Kane reaches the Nexus core. There he meets the Makron in a final showdown and kills it. This accomplished, he destroys the Core and returns to the &quot;Hannibal&quot;. Celebrating with Rhino Squad afterward, Kane receives word that he has new orders.

==Development==
The Xbox 360 version of &quot;Quake 4&quot; was released at the launch of the Xbox 360 and is Xbox Live compatible. There have been major issues with frame rates for the console adaptation, earning it the award for Most Aggravating Frame Rate/Best Slideshow in the GameSpot.com &quot;Best and Worst of 2005&quot; list. In addition, the Xbox 360 port of &quot;Quake 4&quot; has very long load times and Xbox Live glitches that result in problematic multiplayer experiences, as documented by game review sites as well as on Activision&#x27;s support pages for the Xbox 360 version. This version was initially priced the same as the PC Special Edition DVD and features the same content. Aspyr Media published and released &quot;Quake 4&quot; for OS X on April 5, 2006, initially only for PowerPC based Macs, but later as a universal binary compatible with both PowerPC- and x86-based Macs. id Software continued its tradition of supporting Linux, with Timothee Besset of id releasing a Linux version of the &quot;Quake 4&quot; binary executable. The binary could be downloaded for free from id&#x27;s servers and it requires a licensed copy of &quot;Quake 4&quot; for Windows or OS X in order to run. The Linux installer was made available two days after the release of the game itself. The game&#x27;s budget was $15 million.

Having worked on the theme music for &quot;Doom 3&quot;, Clint Walsh and Chris Vrenna were hired to work on the theme music for &quot;Quake 4&quot;. Vrenna produced while Walsh composed the theme music. The rest of the music was composed by Raven&#x27;s audio leads, Zachary Quarles and Kevin Schilder.

In 2021 the &quot;Quake 4&quot; game DLLs were adapted for use with the open source dhewm3 engine derived from the released &quot;Doom 3&quot; source code; this has since been used to port the game to AmigaOS.

==Release==
&quot;Quake 4&quot; went gold in early October 2005 and was released on October 18 for Microsoft Windows, and later for Linux, OS X, and Xbox 360.

A &quot;Special DVD Edition&quot; was released, including promotional material and the game &quot;Quake II&quot; with its expansions &quot;The Reckoning&quot; and &quot;Ground Zero&quot;. The Xbox 360 version of &quot;Quake 4&quot; is based on the &quot;Special DVD Edition&quot; and includes &quot;Quake II&quot;. On August 4, 2011, the game was made available through Steam.

&quot;Quake 4&quot; was re-released for the Xbox 360 and PC on June 19, 2012, with publication handled by Bethesda. In Europe, the game was launched in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Benelux territories. It was released in the United Kingdom on June 22. Unlike the original Xbox 360 version, the Bethesda re-release does not include the port of &quot;Quake II&quot;.

==Additional content==
===Cancelled expansion===
Sometime in 2018, it was revealed that there were plans for a &quot;Quake 4&quot; expansion called &quot;Awakening&quot; but it was cancelled due to unknown reasons. Former Raven artist Vitaliy Naymushin released several 3D models that were to appear in the expansion.

===Mods===
Like its predecessors, &quot;Quake 4&quot; can be modified. This led to &quot;Quake 4&quot; versions of popular mods from previous versions of &quot;Quake&quot;, such as Rocket Arena, and &quot;Quake 4 Fortress&quot; (the &quot;Quake 4&quot; version of &quot;Team Fortress Classic&quot;). &quot;Quake 4 Fortress&quot; was abandoned before its creators considered it complete; instead they released an alpha version complete with source code. In the competitive gaming scene, there were two principal mods, Q4Max and X-Battle. The online &quot;Quake 4&quot; competitive community was split between the two mods. A number of the online leagues switched between X-Battle and Q4Max, such as ClanBase EuroCup and GGL. Despite this split in the online community, the offline professional LAN tournaments run by CPL, ESWC, WCG, QuakeCon, and WSVG all used Q4Max. Members of both the Q4Max and X-Battle teams joined forces with Adam &#x27;SyncError&#x27; Pyle of id Software and developed another mod, Delta CTF, which brought &quot;Quake II&quot;-style Capture the Flag to &quot;Quake 4&quot;. Another notable mod is SABot, which successfully implemented multiplayer bots in &quot;Quake 4&quot; less than a month after the SDK was released, despite this being a feature that some reviewers criticised &quot;Quake 4&quot; for not including.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Quake 4&quot;″s PC version received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

&quot;Quake 4&quot; received generally favorable reviews regarding the PC version of the game, with game database Metacritic giving the game an aggregate review score of 81/100. Websites and magazines such as &quot;IGN&quot; and UGO praised its single-player campaign, graphics and Hollywood voice-acting, but complained that its multiplayer was too much like &quot;Quake III&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; gave Quake 4 an 8.0 and it also said: &quot;The single-player is great fun, but the uninspired multiplayer leaves a lot to be desired&quot;. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; gave &quot;Quake 4&quot; a good review for both singleplayer and multiplayer gameplay.

The original 2005 Xbox 360 version of the game fared slightly worse with critics when it was released but still received generally positive reviews, scoring 75/100 on Metacritic. The only exception for that is &quot;1UP.com&quot;, where they gave the PC version a score of &quot;B−&quot; but the Xbox 360 version a score of &quot;B+&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave a mixed rating to the Xbox 360 port. It panned the single-player campaign for not being creative enough to compete with other games such as &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; and noted that the game ran poorly on the 360. &quot;IGN&quot; scored &quot;Quake 4&quot; 8.1/10, saying &quot;Quake 4 is one of those games that will appeal to console gamers who haven&#x27;t owned a PC for years. The single-player campaign is varied and pretty interesting, getting better after you&#x27;re Stroggified. The enemies go from dumb and running right at you to diverse and more interesting in the second half of the game, and there are a few cool boss fights worth your while. The gory graphics and excellent lighting are well done and they&#x27;ll appeal to many gamers looking for a fast, shiny game to just let loose on&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; gave it a worse rating than the PC version: 6.6. They also wrote: &quot;There&#x27;s a good game in &quot;Quake 4&quot;, but it&#x27;s buried under several layers of highly disappointing graphical performance issues&quot;. &quot;X-Play&quot; gave the Xbox 360 version a 3/5 and the PC version a 4/5.

&quot;Quake 4&quot; was a finalist for &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s &quot;Best Multiplayer Game 2005&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Battlefield 2&quot;.

===Competitive play===
In part due to the similarities to the &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; multiplayer, &quot;Quake 4&quot; was used in a number of professional electronic sports tournaments.

The following competitions have held &quot;Quake 4&quot; events:
*Cyberathlete Professional League (2005)
*Electronic Sports World Cup (2006 / 2007)
*QuakeCon (2005–2007)
*World Cyber Games (2006)
*World Series of Video Games (2006 / 2007)

<doc id="344198" wikidata="Q7935845" url="?curid=344198" title="Viscount Stansgate">
<text>Viscount Stansgate, of Stansgate in the County of Essex, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1942 for the Labour politician, former Secretary of State for India and future Secretary of State for Air, William Wedgwood Benn. He was the second son of Sir John Benn, 1st Baronet, of The Old Knoll. Stansgate&#x27;s eldest son and heir apparent, Michael Benn, was later killed in the Second World War. Consequently, he was succeeded in the title by his second son, the Labour politician Tony Benn, who disclaimed the peerage on 31 July 1963, the day the Peerage Act 1963 passed into law and made it possible for him to do so. , the title is held by Tony Benn&#x27;s eldest son, Stephen Benn, 3rd Viscount Stansgate.

Stansgate is a hamlet near the village of Steeple, Essex, on the southern side of the River Blackwater estuary. The village has been home to several generations of the Benn family since about 1900. They live in Stansgate Abbey, described by Chris Mullin as &quot;an ungainly, rambling 1920s house in a stunning location&quot;.

<text>The Canadian Baptists of Atlantic Canada (CBAC), formerly known as Convention of Atlantic Baptist Churches (CABC) is an Baptist Christian denomination in the eastern provinces of Canada. The offices of the CBAC are located in Moncton, New Brunswick. The union is one of four components of Canadian Baptist Ministries.

==History==
The Baptist Convention of the Maritime Provinces was founded in 1846. The Canadian Baptists of Atlantic Canada was formed in 1905-1906 as the United Baptist Convention of the Maritimes by a union of Free, or Free Will Baptists and Calvinistic or Regular Baptists. The Regular Baptist and Free Will Baptist congregations wrote a statement of faith and polity called the &quot;Basis of Union&quot; with which both groups could agree. With the addition of Newfoundland to Canada, the name was changed to the United Baptist Convention of the Atlantic Provinces in 1963. Many of these churches still carry &quot;United Baptist&quot; in their official name. In 2001, the name was changed to the Convention of Atlantic Baptist Churches. In 2016, the name was changed to the Canadian Baptists of Atlantic Canada.

Since 1944 CBAC has been one of the partners in the Canadian Baptist Federation (now known as Canadian Baptist Ministries).

==Organization==
According to a census published by the association in 2024, it had 450 churches and 21 associations across the Atlantic provinces (New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia &amp; Prince Edward Island). The CBAC is subdivided into nine regions for local cooperation.

== Beliefs ==
The association has a Baptist confession of faith. The Union is a member of Canadian Baptist Ministries and Evangelical Fellowship of Canada.

==Education==

Crandall University is a partner of the Union.
It houses the Baptist Heritage Center whose 300 artifacts preserve the material history of Atlantic Baptists, the Canadian Baptists of Atlantic Canada, and its predecessor organizations. The collection and archives includes objects used in worship services, furniture, musical instruments, church building architecture pictures and printed material.

<text>Gaetano Salvemini (; 8 September 1873 – 6 September 1957) was an Italian socialist and anti-fascist politician, historian, and writer. Born into a family of modest means, he became a historian of note whose work drew attention in Italy and abroad, particularly in the United States, after he was forced into exile by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italian fascist regime.

Initially engaging with the Italian Socialist Party, Salvemini later adhered to an independent humanitarian socialism and maintained a commitment to radical political and social reform throughout his life. Salvemini offered significant leadership to political refugees in the United States. His prolific writings shaped the attitudes of American policymakers during and after the Second World War. His transatlantic exile experience endowed him with new insights and a fresh perspective to explain the rise of fascism and shaped the memory of the war and political life in Italy after 1945.

In post-war Italy, Salvemini advocated a third way between the Italian Communist Party and Christian Democracy.

== Early life and career ==

Salvemini was born in the town of Molfetta, Apulia, in the poor south of the Kingdom of Italy, in an extended family of farmers and fishermen of modest means. His father, Ilarione Salvemini, was a &quot;carabiniere&quot; and part-time teacher. He had been a radical republican who had fought as a Redshirt following Giuseppe Garibaldi in his fight for Italian unification. His mother, Emanuela Salvemini (née Turtur), was a socialist. His parents&#x27; political leanings, as well as the poverty of the region, shaped his own political and social ideals throughout his life.

Salvemini was admitted at the University of Florence, where he met students of northern Italy and engaged with young socialists who introduced him to Marxism, the ideas of philosopher and revolutionary Carlo Cattaneo, and the Italian socialist journal &quot;Critica Sociale&quot; edited by Italy&#x27;s foremost Marxist Filippo Turati. After completing his studies in Florence in 1894, his historical studies on medieval Florence, the French Revolution, and Giuseppe Mazzini established him as an historian of note. In 1897, he married Maria Minervini, the daughter of an engineer from Apulia, whom he had met while studying in Florence and with whom he would have five children: Filippo, Leonida, Corrado, Ugo and Elena.

In 1901, after years of teaching in secondary schools, Salvemini was appointed as Professor of Medieval and Modern History at the University of Messina. While in Messina, his wife, five children, and his sister perished before his eyes in the devastating 1908 Messina earthquake, while hiding under an architrave of a window; an experience that shaped his life. He wrote: &quot;I am a miserable wretch, without home or hearth, who has seen the happiness of eleven years destroyed in two minutes.&quot;

== Engaging with socialism ==
Salvemini became increasingly concerned with Italian politics and adhered to the Italian Socialist Party (, PSI). As a member of the PSI, Salvemini fought for universal suffrage and the moral and economic rebirth of Italy&#x27;s &quot;Mezzogiorno&quot; (Southern Italy) and against corruption in politics. As a meridionalist, he criticised the PSI for its indifference to the problems of Southern Italy. He would eventually abandon the PSI to adhere to an independent humanitarian socialism but maintained a commitment to radical reform throughout his life.

In 1910, he published an article in the socialist newspaper &quot;Avanti!&quot;, &quot;The Minister of the Underworld&quot; (&quot;Il ministro della malavita&quot;&quot;&quot;), in which he attacked the power system and political machine of the liberal prime minister Giovanni Giolitti, who dominated Italian political life in the early 20th century. Salvemini reproached Giolitti for exploiting the backwardness of Southern Italy for short-term political goals by appeasing the landlords while engaging with corrupt political go-betweens with ties to the underworld. According to Salvemini, Giolitti exploited &quot;the miserable conditions of the &quot;Mezzogiorno&quot; in order to link the mass of southern deputies to himself.&quot;

Salvemini opposed Italy’s costly military campaign in Libya during Italo-Turkish War (1911–1912). He thought that the war did not meet the real needs of the country in need of far-reaching economic and social reforms, but was a dangerous collusion between unrealistic nationalism and corporate interests. In 1911, Salvemini left the PSI because of what he described as &quot;the silence and indifference&quot; on the war by the party. He founded the weekly political review &quot;&quot;, which served as the voice of militant democrats in Italy for the next decade. He criticised the government&#x27;s aspirations to build an Italian Empire and its designs in Africa as chauvinist foolishness.

==Intervention in World War I==
Salvemini did favour Italy&#x27;s entry in the First World War on the side of the Entente powers against the &#x27;anachronistic&#x27; character of the German and Austro-Hungarian empires and calling for their defeat in the interests of Italy, as Austria-Hungary still occupied regions considered to be Italian. Intervention in the war was a minority position among socialists that, in the words of Battista Santhià (it), distinguished &quot;between the imperialist war and the just national claims against the old imperialisms; they did not consider it right that some Italian provinces should remain under the dominion of a foreign state, moreover a reactionary one.&quot; Salvemini wanted to achieve a greater political, economic, and social stake in the nation by the masses, as well as national self-determination.

Within Italy&#x27;s left-interventionist movement, he became one of the leaders of the democratic interventionists with Leonida Bissolati. Through the fight for democracy abroad, he believed that Italy would rediscover its own democratic roots. Consistently with his interventionist position, he joined as a volunteer in the first two years of the war. Towards the end of the war, however, he was disappointed that the rivalries between the states could not ultimately be overcome and that the individual peoples did not exert enough influence on the decisions of their governments.

Back in civilian life, he went on to teach history at the University of Pisa and in 1916 was appointed Professor of Modern History at the University of Florence. Over the years, he aligned with the economist Luigi Einaudi and gradually developed a pragmatic inquiry and inductive analysis, which he called &quot;concretismo&quot; – a combination of secular values from the Age of Enlightenment, liberalism, and socialism – in contrast to more philosophical thinkers like the liberal Benedetto Croce and the Marxist Antonio Gramsci. In 1916, he married Fernande Dauriac, the divorced wife of Julien Luchaire, an Italianist and founder of the &quot;Institut français&quot; in Florence, and an animator from 1916 to 1919 of the &quot;Revue des nations latines&quot;, on which Salvemini would also collaborate. His stepson Jean Luchaire later became the head of the French collaborationist press in Paris during the German military occupation of France during World War II.

== Resisting fascism ==

In the immediate postwar period, Salvemini was initially silent about Italian fascism. Elected on a list of ex-combatants, he served in the Chamber of Deputies as an independent radical from 1919 to 1921 during the revolutionary period of the Biennio Rosso. He supported the Fourteen Points, the internationalist programme of self-determination of United States president Woodrow Wilson that envisioned a readjustment of the frontiers of Italy along clearly-recognisable lines of nationality, in contrast to the Italian irredentist policy of the foreign minister Sidney Sonnino.

As a deputy, he soon dissented from the political line of its parliamentary group and started a lively polemic against Benito Mussolini, whom he had admired as socialist leader, to the point that Mussolini challenged him to a duel, which never took place. Nevertheless, as late as 1922, he considered the fascist movement too small to be a serious political challenge. Salvemini was more opposed to old-style politicians like Giolitti. He wrote: &quot;A return to Giolitti would be a moral disaster for the whole country. Mussolini was able to carry out his coup... because everybody was disgusted by the Chamber.&quot;

While in Paris, Salvemini was surprised by Mussolini&#x27;s March on Rome in October 1922, which initiated the National Fascist Party take over of Italy. In 1923, he held a series of lectures on Italian foreign policy in London to the ire of the Italian fascist government and Florentine fascists. The walls of Florence were plastered with posters saying &quot;The monkey from Molfetta should not return to Italy&quot;. Instead, Salvemini not only returned home but also resumed his lectures at the university regardless of the threat of fascist students. He joined the opposition after the murder of the socialist politician Giacomo Matteotti on 10 June 1924, when it became clear that Mussolini wanted to establish a one-party dictatorship.
Salvemini worked to maintain a strong network of contacts among anti-fascist intellectuals throughout Italy while much of the Italian academic world bowed to the regime. With his former students and followers Ernesto Rossi and Carlo Rosselli, he founded the first clandestine anti-fascist newspaper &quot;Non mollare&quot; (it) (&quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;) in January 1925. A half year later, he was arrested and put on trial; he was released on a technicality, although he was kept under surveillance. Threats against his life were published in the fascist press, and his lawyer was beaten to death by fascist Blackshirts. His name was on top of the list of the fascist death squads during raids on 4 October 1925 in Florence. Earlier, in August, Salvemini had fled to France. He was dismissed from the University of Florence, and his Italian citizenship was revoked in 1926.

In exile, Salvemini continued to actively organize resistance against Mussolini in France, England, and finally the United States. Salvemini and others smuggled out documents on Matteotti&#x27;s murder, eventually locking them away in the archives of the London School of Economics, because they &quot;well knew that their quest for justice for Matteotti would be unfulfilled for the foreseeable future. But they were driven by the conviction that these documents could one day prove beyond doubt that Mussolini had orchestrated Matteotti’s assassination.&quot;

In 1927, he published &quot;The Fascist Dictatorship in Italy&quot;, a lucid and groundbreaking study of the rise of fascism and Mussolini. In Paris, he was involved with the founding of &quot;Concentrazione antifascista&quot; in 1927 and &quot;Giustizia e Libertà&quot; with Carlo and Nello Rosselli in 1929. Through those organizations, Italian exiles were helping the anti-fascists in Italy and spreading clandestine newspapers. The movement intended to be a third alternative between fascism and Soviet Communism, pursuing a free democratic republic based on social justice.

== In the United States ==
Salvemini first toured the United States in January 1927 and lectured with a clear anti-fascist agenda. His lectures were disturbed by fascist foes. His forced exile nevertheless gave him a &quot;sense of freedom, of spiritual independence&quot;. Rather than &quot;exile&quot; or &quot;refugee&quot;, he preferred the term &quot;fuoruscito&quot;, an originally-contemptuous label employed by fascists that was adopted as a symbol of honour by political exiles from Italy, &quot;a man who has chosen to leave his country to continue a resistance which had become impossible at home&quot;. He published &quot;The Fascist Dictatorship in Italy&quot; (1927), contradicting the widely held belief that Mussolini had saved Italy from Bolshevism.

In 1934, Salvemini accepted a position created especially for him, to teach Italian civilization at Harvard University, where he would remain until 1948. Together with Roberto Bolaffi, he founded a North American chapter of &quot;Giustizia e Libertà&quot;. He wrote articles in important journals like &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; and travelled around the country to warn American public opinion against the dangers of fascism. Alarmed by the outbreak of the Second World War after Adolf Hitler&#x27;s invasion of Poland in September 1939, he and other Italian exiles founded the anti-fascist Mazzini Society in Northampton, Massachusetts. Salvemini joined the Italian Emergency Rescue Committee, which raised money for Italian political refugees and worked to convince American authorities to admit them.

Salvemini obtained United States citizenship in 1940 in the belief that he would have greater opportunity to influence American policies toward Italy. In fact, government agencies like the State Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation solicited his advice on fascism and Italian matters in general. Notable writings of the American years include &quot;Under the Axe of Fascism&quot; (1936). As an intellectual, Salvemini left an undeniable mark on the study of Italian history at Harvard and other universities by changing their original focus on language, art, and literature to a critical and systematic study into modern Italy.

The increasing prominence of Max Ascoli, Carlo Sforza, and Alberto Tarchiani in the Mazzini Society consequently led to the progressive distancing of Salvemini from active decision making. Salvemini&#x27;s fear was that Franklin D. Roosevelt would give Winston Churchill and his conservative agenda a free hand in postwar Italy that would benefit the monarchy and those who had collaborated with Mussolini. After Mussolini&#x27;s fall in July 1943, Salvemini became increasingly concerned that the Allies of World War II and Italian moderates favoured a conservative restoration in Italy. To provide an alternative, together with Harvard professor Giorgio La Piana, Salvemini authored &quot;What to Do With Italy?&quot;, in which they sketched a plan for the postwar reconstruction of Italy with a republican and social-democratic programme. Salvemini was also a familiar figure in the younger years of Arthur Schlesinger Jr., editor of the campaign speeches for peace strategy then known as The New Frontier for John F. Kennedy.

== Back in Italy ==

Although a United States citizen, Salvemini returned to Italy in 1948 and was reinstated to his old post as Professor of Modern History at the University of Florence. After twenty years of exile, he started his first speech at his old university with &quot;As we were saying in the last lecture&quot;. As a left-leaning republican, he was disappointed with the victory of Christian Democracy in the 1948 Italian general election and the influence of the Catholic Church in the country. Salvemini hoped that the Action Party, a post-war political party that emerged from &quot;Giustizia e Libertà&quot;, could provide a third force, a socialist-republican coalition uniting reformist socialists and genuine democrats as an alternative for the Italian Communist Party and Christian Democracy. His hopes for a new Italy declined with the restoration of old attitudes and institutions with the start of the Cold War.

In 1953, Salvemini&#x27;s last major historic study, &quot;Prelude to World War II&quot;, was published about the Second Italo-Ethiopian War (1935–1937). As a historian, he wrote mainly about recent and contemporary history but was also noted for his studies of the Italian medieval commune. His &quot;The French Revolution: 1788–1792&quot; is an outstanding explanation of the social, political, and philosophical currents and monarchical incompetence that led to that cataclysm.

== Death and legacy ==
Salvemini spent the last period of his life in Sorrento, in the Campania southern Italian region, and never ceased to denounce the ancient Italian evils: inefficiency, scandals, and the lengthy justicial procedures that continued to favour the powerful. He lamented the public schools, which he considered not to be forming a real critical conscience. After a long illness, he died on 6 September 1957 at the age of 83.

Salvemini was among the first and most effective opponents of fascism. According to his biographer Charles L. Killinger, Salvemini embodied a political culture such that &quot;the Fascists were anti-Salvemini before he became anti-Fascist, and their efforts to silence him made his name synonymous with early Italian resistance to the new regime.&quot; Although a prolific historian, he was not the kind of person to separate scholarship from political activity. Throughout his exile, he actively organized resistance to Mussolini, assisting others in escaping Italy, and he played an important role in spurring both elite and public opinion in America against the fascist regime.

Giolitti&#x27;s biographer Alexander De Grand describes his subject&#x27;s foe as a &quot;major historian, driven by an austere moralism&quot; and as a &quot;difficult man who attracted deep attachments and bitter enmity&quot;, who &quot;constantly sought to turn his ideas into practical policy, yet he was a mediocre – no, terrible – politician&quot;, quoting Salvemini&#x27;s fellow exile Max Ascoli, who described him &quot;as the greatest enemy of politics of all the men I have known&quot;. Nevertheless, Salvemini was an imperative force who left a permanent mark on Italian politics and historiography. As a party activist, political commentator, and public officeholder, he championed social and political reform, and his name is tantamount to early Italian resistance to Fascist Italy. Salvemini said several times that he always tried to live by the principle, &quot;Do what you have to do, come what may&quot; (in Italian: &quot;Fa&#x27; quello che devi, avvenga quello che può&quot;).

<doc id="344210" wikidata="Q5866694" url="?curid=344210" title="History of St Neots">
<text>[[St Neots]], historically in Huntingdonshire, is one of the largest towns in Cambridgeshire, England, after the cities of Cambridge and Peterborough. There is evidence of very early occupation in the area. In Roman times a fortified settlement was established, and present-day Eynesbury in particular became important, in addition to scattered settlements west of the River Great Ouse. A holy man named Saint Neot had died about the year 877 AD and his relics were held for a century in a parish in Cornwall. About 974 AD a Priory was established in the northern part of Eynesburydowner took the relics of Saint Neot from the Cornish church and conveyed them to Eynesbury. This brought fame to the Eynesbury Priory, and gradually that part of the town became known as St Neots.

After the Norman Conquest the Priory was passed from the monastery at Ely to being a dependent branch of the Norman Abbey of Bec, and it grew in importance until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, when the Priory was destroyed and Neot&#x27;s relics lost. 

The importance of the town increased greatly in the early nineteenth century, when stage coach travel to the north of England became important. Eaton Socon was on the Great North Road and many coaches used inns there to change and stable horses, and to refresh passengers - four such coaching inns are still operating today as public houses. Some of the coaches travelled through St Neots as well, as did others on an east-to-west trajectory from Cambridge. The river too brought much trade to the towns. When the railway opened in 1850, St Neots had a wayside station, but the stage coach trade and the river traffic slumped, causing for a time a loss of prosperity in the area, though that was later regained.

After 1945 a considerable expansion of the housing stock took place as part of a national scheme named London overspill, designed to transfer London residents away from slum housing. The housebuilding programme continued sporadically under other names, and accelerated in the twenty-first century. 

The county boundary between Huntingdonshire and Bedfordshire had been the River Great Ouse, but in 1965 the districts of Eaton Ford and Eaton Socon were brought into St Neots. Huntingdonshire was abolished (as a county-level unit - it continues to be a District Council) and replaced by Cambridgeshire.

This history article covers the modern urban area of St Neots, which includes Eaton Ford, Eaton Socon and Eynesbury.

==Before the Romans==
There were probably small settlements in St Neots, Eynesbury and Eaton Socon in the Neolithic period, which lasted until about 1,700 BC. The Bronze Age followed, and more evidence of settlement has been found, including an axe head and evidence of a large building, possibly a temple, has been found in Eaton Ford near the Crosshall Road junction. Polished stone axes and beaker pottery of the early Bronze Age have been discovered in Eynesbury. 

Archaeological excavations in the area now occupied by the Love&#x27;s Farm houses, exposed the remains of a Bronze Age field system dating from around 1,500 BC. An agricultural community occupied the site for over 700 years from at least 200 BC to around the 5th or 6th centuries AD. From the Iron Age until the Romano-British period, and the Early Saxon period, successive generations lived on this land, improving drainage, growing new crops, managing livestock, and adding enclosures, buildings, roads and monuments.

There is also evidence for Iron Age settlement, and a pit containing pottery was found in the grounds of what is now Ernulf Academy. People of the later iron age made a settlement near Howitts Lane.

This pre-Roman activity altered the natural landscape quite markedly, mostly through the felling of timber to clear fields and construct buildings.

==The Roman period==
During the Roman period (43-410 AD) the Eynesbury settlement was extended towards the River Great Ouse, while staying above the level of the flood plain. A large Roman camp existed at the Conygeare area of Eynesbury.

Sites of at least two houses with hypocaust central heating have been located in this area. It is possible that agricultural produce was loaded here on to river transport for shipment down river, perhaps to supply food for the Roman army in the north by coastwise transport.

In addition Eynesbury had good road communications in Roman times. A road from Sandy to Godmanchester passed not far to the east, and there was a branch to Eynesbury. It is marked on present-day Ordnance Survey maps. A present-day footpath leading from Duck Lane towards Wintringham is on the line of a metalled Roman footpath, and pottery has been found near it.

==Anglo-Saxon and Viking period==
The Romans left Britain between 446 AD and 454 AD, and new occupiers came in, chiefly the Angles and the Saxons. They subdued, or drove out, the indigenous population and established a system of local government in which the area was divided into hundreds, which may refer to an area containing one hundred families. The areas east of the River Great Ouse belonged to Toseland Hundred, and the western area to Barford Hundred. 

A Saxon chieftain called Ernulf (or Eynulf, or Aynulf) took over the Roman encampment near the river crossing at Coneygeare and the area became known as Eanulfsbyrig, meaning Ernulf&#x27;s fort. Later that became Einulfesberie, and then Eynesbury. St Neots did not exist as a separate place yet, and was simply part of Eynesbury.

To the west of the river, an Anglo-Saxon leader took control of a village near the water&#x27;s edge, probably opposite the Coneygeare, and this was called Ea-tun, meaning waterside-village. Another settlement a little further north was called Forda, and later simply Ford. A further small settlement was on the hilltop near the Duloe windmill, and was then called Sudbury, meaning the southern fort.

Everyday objects have been found such as the clay weights used in weaving, broken pieces of pottery, a quern-stone, a plough share, and an iron axe. Burials from the period contained other objects such as a sword, spears, pagan brooches, and a knife.

Throughout this period the River Great Ouse was much wider and shallower than at present, with ill-defined banks. This made fording the river possible with care, and by choosing a dryer period to do so.

==Christianity==
Although Christianity had been practised during the Roman period, the majority of the population were pagan. This was a situation disapproved of by the Pope, and in 597 AD he sent Augustine with some support, to re-convert the people. Augustine&#x27;s work - alongside the mission from Iona via Lindisfarne - was successful and a hundred years later most of East Anglia was Christian.

A mother church was built in Eaton to serve as a focus for a large area on the west bank of the Great Ouse, while at Great Paxton on the east bank, another church served an area including the present-day St Neots and Eynesbury. Later in Saxon times Eynesbury built its own church.

==A priory and Saint Neot==

About 972 AD an Anglo-Saxon landowner named Leofric (or Alric) and his wife Leoflaed founded a small monastery in Eynesbury (at that time known as Ernulph&#x27;s Bury. The settlement was established at the junction of Huntingdon Street and Cambridge Street. However Leofric and Leoflaed built their priory near the river, adjacent to the present-day Priory Lane, St Neots.

The Priory had the potential to generate considerable income from the visits and donations of pilgrims, but to attract pilgrims they needed relics. Leofric decided to obtain the remains of Saint Neot, a much-revered Saxon monk who had spent much of his life in Cornwall. He had died in about 875 AD and been buried there. The present day village in Cornwall is known as Saint Neot Leofric arranged to abstract Neot&#x27;s bones, bringing them to his Priory. This had the desired effect and the Priory became a major centre of attention for pilgrims.

According to Gorham, the name of the locality near the Priory was changed to Neotsbury about 974 AD.

==Viking incursion==
In the late 10th and early 11th centuries, Viking raiders from Denmark started to occupy areas inland from their established coastal territories; they rowed longboats up the River Great Ouse, attacking religious houses to plunder their treasure; as pagans they held no qualms about the practice. It is likely that the Priory was destroyed by the Danes in about 1010 AD. As a precaution, St Neot&#x27;s bones had been sent to Crowland Abbey in Lincolnshire for safe-keeping from the invaders. Neot&#x27;s remains were brought back to the Priory in Eynesbury in 1020.

==Takeover by the Normans==
In 1066 AD William, Duke of Normandy launched an invasion of southern England, and defeated English forces at the Battle of Hastings. The resulting subjugation of the Anglo-Saxon indigenous people is referred to as the Norman Conquest. The Normans found their subject population to be a multiracial mix of Celts, Angles, Saxons and Danes. At Eaton, on the west side of the river, the local chieftain was Ulmar, a thegn (or &quot;thane&quot;) and he was superior to two sokemen; the soke was a subsidiary area of land and control. In time the area became known as Soka de Eton by 1247 AD. In 1645 it was known as Eton cum Soca, and in the nineteenth century this had become Eaton Socon.

The manor of Eaton contained two water mills, a church and a priest; there were 38 villein families, seven smallholders and eight tied labourers.

On the east side of the river, there were two manors in Eynesbury: the southern manor was about the same size as Eaton, with about 42 houses and a church. These villagers kept sheep rather than pigs (as at Eaton) and they too had watermills. The northern community had about 25 houses, and it enjoyed fishing rights in the river as well as having a mill. In addition it had the Priory with its relics of Saint Neot, carrying considerable added prestige and income.

==Local Norman control consolidated==
William the Conqueror established his power as King William I, and he had fortifications built to impose local control. One was at Huntingdon, controlling the area east of the River Great Ouse, and another was at Bedford, controlling lands to the west. The local leader was called a baron and the area was a barony. Manors, local centres of agricultural and civil leadership, were allocated to favoured Norman individuals. 

The northern manor of Eynesbury, roughly equivalent to modern St Neots, was owned Richard fitz Gilbert and his wife Rohese Giffard, alternatively known as Richard of Clare and Rohaïs, or Roys. Richard owned extensive lands elsewhere, and it may be that Rohaïs was in practical control at Eynesbury. The manor there included the Priory.

The southern manor at Eynesbury, located within present-day Eynesbury, was owned by a Saxon, Earl Waltheof; he had married Judith, who was the niece of King William. In 1075 Waltheof was implicated in a revolt against the King, and was executed, leaving Judith as Countess of the manor.

At Eaton the manor was allocated to Lisois de Moutiers, but by the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 it had been transferred to Eudo Dapifer; he was a steward in the Royal household, and therefore an extremely important person, bringing prestige to Eaton.

==Developments at St Neots Priory==
By the end of the 11th century, the fame of the Priory due to the presence of Neot&#x27;s remains led progressively to the name St Neots being applied to the area of Eynesbury north of the Hen Brook, and that name is used in the rest of this article.

The existence of the Priory outweighed the agricultural value of the St Neots manor. Some time after 1078 (and to the displeasure of the monastery at Ely) it became a dependant of the important Abbey of Bec in Normandy, whose former Prior Lanfranc had become Archbishop of Canterbury in 1070. Anselm followed Lanfranc as Prior of Bec and was elected Abbot of Bec in place of its founder Herluin in 1078. He took a particular interest in the St Neots Priory, seeing it as a means of developing Benedictine influence, and he made it the most important possession of Bec in England. About 18 monks were transferred from Normandy. Anselm visited St Neots a few years after this time, to &quot;verify&quot; for himself that the relics held in the Priory were indeed the bones of Neot; evidently he was satisfied. On his return to Normandy he took with him the jawbone of the Saint.

The rebuilding of the Priory was complete by 1110, but Richard of Clare had died. Rohaïs was now in sole charge of the entire manor, and gave it to the Priory and its monks at a re-dedication ceremony in 1113. The building consisted of a church with the bell tower, a refectory, a dormitory, a chapter house, and a central cloister area, as well as kitchens, a cellarium for food storage and outbuildings including stables, storage barns, workshops and pigsties. Foundations and column bases have been discovered, as well as other finds including glazed floor tiles, painted wall plaster, fragments of stained glass, and pieces of carved masonry. By this time the Priory was very extensive, stretching from the river nearly as far as New Street, and from the Common to the market square.

While St Neots was making progress, a small religious house was established in Eaton Socon in the 12th century. William of Colmworth and a group of monks, not affiliated to any particular order, was given a site at Bushmead by Hugh de Beauchamp, who had his base in Bedford, in about 1195. After 1215 the site became an Augustinian priory, but it never rivalled the prestige of the St Neots priory.

==Secular developments==
About 1130 a weekly market on Thursdays was authorised to be held in St Neots, as well as four fairs annually. The St Neots market is said to be one of four early &quot;plantation&quot; markets, in effect new towns. This brought further income to the Priory. The market was held on a site very close to the present-day market square, immediately south of the Priory. In a further development, a wooden bridge was built in 1180, at the location of the present-day bridge; tolls were collected by the Priory. There had long been river-crossings -- probably fords, or ferries -- at Coneygeare and Crosshall, and these now fell into disuse. The Crosshall ford was further north than the present-day bridge: Crosshall Road from the junction with the Great North Road may have been constructed so as to aim in a straight line for the Priory and the ford. The existence of the market, and the visits of pilgrims to Neot&#x27;s relics, encouraged the establishment of permanent trading places, and by 1180 St Neots was granted permission to form a parish of its own, independent of Eynesbury, and the name of St Neots, long used informally, was now made official.
Hugh de Beauchamp built a castle in present-day Eaton Socon around 1140. It was probably of timber construction with earthworks and may never have been completed, but the earth mound still exists. The castle was built during a period of civil war over the succession to the throne. Matilda was the heir to King Henry I but a faction of barons supported Stephen. In the civil war that followed several fortified positions were quickly thrown up in support of Stephen, and Eaton Socon Castle was one of them. Stephen&#x27;s supporters won and he was installed as king. When he died in 1154, Matilda&#x27;s son Henry succeeded as King Henry II. One of his first acts was to order the demolition of the castles, which were referred to as adulterine. 

Some habitable accommodation must have remained, and was occupied in the 13th century by a Lady Juliana de Beauchamp. Notwithstanding its demolition, the castle and the remaining residential occupation conferred considerable prestige on Eaton. 

Around 1204, a new parish church was built in St Neots, fragments of which can still be found in the fifteenth century church which now stands on the site - a separate parish of St Neots was created out of the parish of Eynesbury in 1204 by William of Blois, Bishop of Lincoln (in whose Diocese the town remained until 1837). Both Eynesbury and Eaton Socon parish churches were rebuilt around the same time; the North Arcade in Eynesbury church is probably the oldest substantial remains from this time. The Priory became highly respected and extremely wealthy during this period, and the settlements of Eynesbury, St Neots, and Eaton Socon were prosperous too. The increasing river and road traffic further enhanced the importance of the three communities, all of which flourished.

Throughout the 12th and 13th centuries, the prestige of the area and the Priory, and the commercial benefit of the main highways passing through, increased the importance of the towns. In 1156 King Henry II visited, staying at the Priory and bringing a very large retinue. King Henry III visited the priory, staying there in 1229, 1235 and 1236.

==The Hundred Years War and the Black Death==
The Priory and the town suffered two major setbacks in the fourteenth century. The Hundred Years&#x27; War (1337 - 1453) involved bitter enmity between England and France. The Priory was a subsidiary of the Norman Abbey of Bec, and was regarded with suspicion as an alien outpost. This drastically reduced its income from pilgrimages as well as leading to administrative financial sanctions. In 1409 the Priory was given its independence by Bec, and this allowed it slowly to regain a limited prosperity.

The editor of the Victoria History puts it rather differently: &quot;... in 1412, the priory was declared independent of Bec, on the ground that divine service was neglected and revenues diminished by maladministration. An English prior, Edward Salisbury, was placed in charge, under obedience to the diocesan...&quot;

In 1348 the Black Death broke out, resulting in the death of about a third of the population, and extreme fear of ordinary travel; pilgrimages to the Priory were unsafe. As well as more widespread devastation, it is believed that the plague wiped out the village of Sudbury, which was located at the junction of Crosshall Road and the Great North Road.

==Surviving buildings==
Very few secular buildings have survived from the 15th century. A fine timber-framed building erected in the 15th has been revealed at the corner of Church Walk in St Neots. It is believed to have been built for a wealthy corn merchant. From the same period is the Old Falcon on the Market Square: its now dilapidated frontage conceals a much older interior. Eynesbury&#x27;s oldest surviving secular mediaeval building is The Chequers in St Mary&#x27;s Street. Although roughly dated to the early 16th century it is likely to have been there a century earlier.

==Tudor period, 1485 - 1603==
Henry VIII became King of England in 1509, and when he severed the connection with the Roman Catholic Church, he brought about the Dissolution of the Monasteries, when he disbanded and physically destroyed most of the country&#x27;s monasteries. St Neots Priory was closed in 1534, the remaining 12 monks being pensioned off. Many buildings and land, and movable possessions were confiscated and sold off, or given to the King&#x27;s friends. Crucially there is no record of what happened to the bones of Neot. Eight years later, the buildings and land were sold, while the manor was given to the King&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth, later to become Queen Elizabeth I. The site was built over by a brewery in Victorian times.

In 1591, there were 879 people living in Eaton Socon; as Eynesbury and St Neots may each have been a similar size, this suggests a total population of at least 2,000. St Neots Grammar School was in existence by 1556 when the schoolmaster was a Mr Faucet.

==St Neots Town Bridge==
The first bridge across the River Great Ouse at St Neots was probably built in the 11th or 12th century to bring traders and pilgrims into the market place established by the monks of St Neots Priory: it probably replaced a ford. It was constructed entirely in timber and, because there were marshy areas both sides of the river, it included a long causeway.

In 1588, a new town bridge was built. A survey of the old bridge showed that it consisted of 72 arches, and it was 704 feet in length and 7 ft 6 in wide. The replacement bridge was to have masonry piers up to the flood water level. The river formed the boundary between Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire, so both counties had to contribute to the costs of materials and labour.

The town bridge was replaced again, probably in 1617, but this time entirely in masonry. The bridge was clearly of great importance as it allowed river traffic to pass without hindrance (by elimination of the ford), and commerce was becoming increasingly important. Other improvements in the same period included river work to improve navigability. In 1670 the River Ouse (Bedfordshire) Navigation Act was passed for improvements to the River Ouse, to enable navigation as far as Bedford.

During the 19th century the superstructure of the bridge was widened and the &quot;scallops&quot; peculiar to the Huntingdonshire half were carried across the whole length of the parapet. (The scallops were in fact jack-arches supported on cantilever beams, supporting the footway extensions.) The end of the bridge at Eaton Ford was also widened to make less of a bottle-neck.

The old stone bridge survived well into the 20th century, but it proved inadequate for the weight of modern motor traffic, even when passage over it was restricted to one-way operation. There was a five mph speed limit. Because of its position on a county boundary, the negotiations regarding its replacement were prolonged, taking over 20 years to complete. Finally in 1964, the &quot;picturesque but fragile structure was demolished and work began on the present more practical bridge&quot;.

== Stuart and Civil War period ==
St Neots Manor passed from royal ownership under King James I to Sir Sidney Montague. In the First Civil War, he supported the Royalist or Cavalier cause although his nephew, Edward, supported Parliament. As in most parts of the country, loyalties were mixed, but St Neots was firmly in Parliamentary hands and a detachment of Roundhead troops guarded the town. However, King Charles I passed through the town in 1645 and gathered willing recruits from local people.
On 10 July 1648 during the Second Civil War, a small battle took place when a group of 300 Royalists camped in the Market Square overnight. They were surprised, and overcome by a smaller group of Roundheads advancing across the bridge, and most of them were taken prisoner.

From 1653 there was a period known as The Protectorate when Parliament ruled the country under Oliver Cromwell. During this time much destruction -- even desecration -- of religious decoration took place, as it offended the strict philosophies of the Puritans. After seven years the monarchy was restored under King Charles II. 

Things gradually returned to normal, and many buildings in St Neots and Eynesbury were constructed in the years following the Restoration. There were 543 houses in the town in 1674 when records were taken for the Hearth Tax (though some of these may have been in nearby villages). The Waggon and Horses public house in Eynesbury, and Ford House in Eaton Ford date from this period. Conversely Eynesbury Church was allowed to fall into disrepair, until in 1684 the spire collapsed, causing extensive damage. The building was repaired and the current tower was built in 1687.

==Resurgence of religion==
The first dissenting chapel in the district was built at Hail Weston, and a Congregational church Meeting House was established on the north side of St Neots High Street in 1718. The chapel was enlarged for larger congregations in 1889. Meanwhile, Baptists who broke away from the Congregationalists in 1800, established a chapel in New Street. Methodism started in St Neots as a result of a visit by John Wesley in 1772, and the first Methodist chapel was built at the corner of Huntingdon Street in 1794. Other chapels built in the period include the Salvation Army citadel in 1891, and a chapel in New Street and one in East Street now converted for use by the Roman Catholic Church. In 1883, the Salvationists were accused by the magistrates of &quot;thrusting their religious views upon the public in an ostentatious manner&quot;. By the time of the 1851 Census, there were as many Non-Conformists worshipping on Sundays as there were members of the Church of England.

It was a time of religious revival which showed itself not only in the growth of new denominations but also in the revival of the parish church. In 1847, at a cost of over £2,000, the church was refloored and the pews were renewed, with much stonework substantially repaired. A particularly fine set of stained-glass windows were put in between 1859 and 1902, largely paid for by C P Rowley. A new organ by George Holdich of London was installed in 1855.

In 1863 the Corn Exchange was erected on the corner of High Street and South Street. It was intended as an indoor market for farmers, but it also served as a venue for concerts and meetings, and after 1887, it housed a museum. Other facilities were provided by the Library and Literary Institute, founded in 1881, the Liberal Club, and the Constitutional Club, founded in 1895. There was a Workmen&#x27;s Club at Eaton Socon from 1880, meeting in the school, and at Eynesbury a Reading Room was established in the school there in 1868.

==Lords of the Manor==
The Lordship of the Manor was acquired by the Rowley family in 1902. The Rowleys first appear on the scene, however, in the 18th century at Upper Wintringham when they acquired the house formerly owned by the Payne family. Then in 1793, Owsley Rowley bought Priory Farm at the north end of Huntingdon Street from his father-in-law William King. He set about laying out the farm as parkland -- it amounted to 1,263 acres -- and, in 1798, he built a large house on it. Rowley&#x27;s purchases of land, much of it to the east of the railway line, including Monks Hardwick Farm, the Mill at Little Paxton made him probably the most powerful man in the town, long before the family became Lords of the manor. He was a Justice of the peace and chairman of the Court of quarter sessions for 25 years. 

On his death in 1824, his son George William Rowley succeeded and acquired the advowson of St Neots in 1864. Owsley Rowley&#x27;s third grandson, Charles Perceval Rowley, who lived at Wintringham, was responsible for ten of the stained glass windows in St Neots Parish church. The second son, George Dawson Rowley became famous as an explorer and ornithologist. Some of his collection of stuffed birds is now in the British Museum. He and his father died within hours of each other in 1878, to be succeeded by his only son George Fydell Rowley.

==Support for the poor==
As the structure of society changed with the agricultural revolution and the early stages of the industrial revolution it became obvious that some organised system for supporting the destitute was necessary. St Neots and Eaton Socon had had local workhouses since 1722 and 1719 respectively. This became known as indoor relief, where the poor were given accommodation and food instead of money, and were put to work if they were capable of it. The Workhouse system was introduced nationwide following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834.

This resulted in the formation of St Neots Poor Law Union on 24 September 1835. After some difficulty in finding a suitable site, a workhouse was built in Eaton Socon (the location is now considered to be in Eaton Ford). Its capacity was 250 persons. A separate infirmary block was ready in 1879, increasing the limited capacity of the workhouse.

The workhouse closed in that role in the late 1920s, and the building was used as a hospital for the elderly. It was renamed the White House. In the 1950s part of the building at the rear was converted into flats and in the 1980s the entire building was drastically converted, and was made into residential flats.

==Turnpikes and stage coaches==
In the 18th century new ideas and ways of life began to develop, and the pace quickened as the decades passed. The roads that were adequate for static populations in the sixteenth century, were becoming a hindrance to the commercial progress. Local people were responsible for the maintenance, but &quot;That a route connecting two great towns which have a large and thriving trade with each other should be maintained at the cost of the rural population scattered between them is obviously unjust.&quot; While stagecoaches catch the imagination, it must be remembered that slow goods carts formed a considerable traffic also.

By 1700 a few turnpikes had been set up: a turnpike was a toll road: the toll income was used to maintain the road surface. Eventually local Acts of Parliament were passed to enable Turnpike Trusts to manage sections of road. In 1725 a Trust was established to manage the Great North Road between Biggleswade and Alconbury. Another was founded in 1772 to manage part of the road between Cambridge and St Neots.

Improved roads meant more travelling and the number of coaches and carriages passing through St Neots and Eaton Socon increased. It was during the 18th century that road travel reached its zenith, when the stagecoach was introduced. Teams of horses were changed at intervals of 10 or 12 miles, known as &quot;stages&quot;, enabling the coach to keep going, stopping only for the change, and for meal stops. Coaching inns along the line of route arranged the feed and rest of the unharnessed horses, and had them ready at the specified time for the next run by the same coach operator. Overnight accommodation was provided, as any long transit took several days. Feed for the horses was the largest expense for the operators.

By 1754 coaches were travelling from London as far as Edinburgh (taking 8 or 9 days). At the height of stagecoach activity there were 20 coaches passing through Eaton Socon daily, &quot;some of them going straight up the Great North Road after changing horses at The White Horse and others taking the loop through St Neots. At The Cross Keys Inn mail was collected as well as passengers&quot;.

At this time stagecoach travel was at its peak. Some coaches took the loop into St Neots and some passed through Eaton Socon. The two routes converged again at Alconbury Hill with stagecoaches using the Old North Road, the stretch from there to Norman Cross was the busiest length of road in England. Stagecoaches passed along this section at the rate of one every 20 minutes day and night, and the Bell Inn at Stilton, where teams of horses were changed, had stabling for over 300 horses.

==Education==
In 1736 a school for 35 &quot;poor boys&quot; was established at St Neots; by the end of the century there was a school for poor children, and both sexes were taught. Classes were held at first in the Jesus Chapel of St Neots Church, but after 1745 they moved elsewhere. In 1760 Alderman Newton of Leicester left money in his will for the benefit of schools in Huntingdonshire and the school at St Neots received £26 to clothe as well as educate poor boys.

Huntingdonshire Education Committee long resisted the provision of a secondary school in St Neots; in 1926 about a hundred pupils travelled to Huntingdon every day to school. Following the enactment of the Education Act 1944, grammar schools were established. Local politicians in St Neots called for one to be provided, but it was said that there were not enough grammar pupils in St Neots to justify such a school. At this time Eaton Socon was in Bedfordshire, so a number of St Neots pupils travelled daily to school in Huntingdon, and a corresponding number of Eaton Socon pupils travelled daily to Biggleswade.

It was not until 1960 that a secondary school was established in St Neots. Eaton Socon was still in Bedfordshire, which complicated the position, and St Neots grammar school pupils still had to make a daily journey to Huntingdon. It was not until the establishment of Longsands and Ernulf comprehensive schools in 1966 and 1971 that full secondary education provision was made in St. Neots.

==The nineteenth century==
===Industrialisation===
The oldest forms of industry grew out of the needs of agriculture. Corn milling was practised at Duloe using a windmill and at Eaton Socon using water power, and a malt mill was established in 1604. Industrialisation proper began in St Neots as elsewhere in the 18th century. The most notable contribution of St Neots was in the field of paper making. In 1808 Sealy and Henry Fourdrinier invented a process by which paper could be made in a continuous roll and it was at St Neots Mill (in Little Paxton) that the process was first put into action. The machines were powered by water, but later steam turbines were used.

Despite the technical success, the Fourdrinier brothers failed financially. Their business was taken over by Matthew Towgood. Towgood and his sons operated the mill until the early 1880s, when it was taken over by the St Neots Paper Mill Company.

A bell foundry was established in 1735 by Joseph Eayre. The foundry was in the conical building later called the &#x27;Oast House&#x27; within the Brewery grounds. Eayre&#x27;s business was continued by Edward Arnold and then Robert Taylor. Taylor was required to leave the brewery site near the end of the century, and for around two decades cast bells in the Cambridge Street area, before moving, in about the year 1820, to Oxford. The family business later moved again to Loughborough where it continues - in 2020 it was the last remaining bell foundry in England.

Brewing took on a more industrial character in the 18th century. James Paine acquired William Foster&#x27;s brewery in the Market Square in 1831. The Priory Brewery, on the site of the old Priory, which was owned by the Fowler family, was sold to John Day of Bedford in 1814. John Day also provided St Neots with its first street lamps.

Writing in 1820 Gorham records that 

The river Ouse is navigable from the port of Lynn to St. Neot&#x27;s,[sic] and thence to Bedford. A considerable trade is carried on in corn, wine, coals, iron, timber, &amp;c. The average breadth of the stream is 150 feet. The greater part of the town being a few feet above the ordinary level of the river, inundations are sometimes consequent upon sudden thaws or very heavy rains, to such an extent as to render a navigation of the streets not merely practicable but necessary.

St. Neots also became famous for the manufacture of gas appliances. George Bower (1826 or 1827 - 1911) built a foundry for making gas fires, light fittings and gas cookers. His business was successful for many years -- at its height his factory employed 200 workers -- until a major South American purchaser defaulted and Bower went bankrupt.

===Railways===
On 7 August 1850, a railway opened to the public through St Neots: the Great Northern Railway opened its line from a temporary station in London at Maiden Lane, to Peterborough. In succeeding years the company opened throughout from Kings Cross to Doncaster, and with other friendly railway companies, reached York and Edinburgh as well as much of Yorkshire, and later the Nottinghamshire coalfields and the east coast ports.

At St Neots the route planned by the railway lay well to the east of the town. This was done to avoid taking land from Priory Park, the estate of George William Rowley. The eastward alignment made an awkward location for the station; Parliamentary Committees scrutinised railway bills, and at this early date the Lords Committee was heavily favourable to land owners. Protracted argument in Committee would cost a fortune in money the promoters did not have. Rowley had tried to force the railway company to adopt a route to the west of St Neots, far from his estate, but this was refused by Parliament, and the railway&#x27;s compromise route was confirmed. This still took some land from Rowley&#x27;s property, and this was valued by the railway&#x27;s valuer at £8,000. Rowley demanded £12,000, which he later increased to £15,000. The matter had to be settled by a jury trial; the jury valuation went ahead, and returned a value of £8,000, exactly as the railway company had already offered. 

The railway rapidly ousted the stagecoaches. Apart from long-distance trains that reduced the time of travel to Scotland to less than a day, there were soon excursions to holiday resorts such as Skegness and Cromer, and also to London. However by far the biggest influence of the railway in the nineteenth century was the transport of goods and minerals: manufactured goods outward, and heavy commodities inward: coal, lime for improving soil, and cattle feed. Coal in particular: the price of coal often reduced by 80% the day after a town acquired a railway connection.

Unfortunately for St Neots, the rise of the railways led to the destruction of the stagecoach trade that had brought so much prosperity to the area. Long distance stagecoach travel was quickly wiped out, and river traffic declined steeply too: Bedford and St Neots merchants and farmers no longer required river transport for their materials. Employment in support of stagecoach travel, and water transport, collapsed. Toll income on the Upper Ouse was £7,656 in 1842 but fell to £4,508 in 1815; for the years 1852 to 1863 it averaged £1,974 per annum.

Nevertheless St Neots revived its industry and trade; returning prosperity was signalled when the Corn Exchange opened in 1863, and a livestock market was opened in the 1890s.

==Assassination of the Prime Minister==

On 11 May 1812 John Bellingham shot and killed the Prime Minister, Spencer Perceval. Bellingham was born in St Neots and had travelled widely for business purposes. He seems to have been defrauded and imprisoned in Russia, and on his return he attracted no help from the British Government. Harbouring extreme resentment, he carried out the assassination. He was immediately caught, and hanged a week later.

==Local government==
The establishment of Poor Law Unions, and from 1877 the setting up of a national system of prisons eroded the role of the Justices of the Peace. Elected County Councils were introduced in 1888.

In the early 1960s serious proposals were put forward to reorganise the areas controlled by local government in the area. As it seemed likely that Huntingdonshire would be disbanded, it was repeatedly said by some that St Neots would prefer to join Bedfordshire rather than Cambridgeshire, as the town had limited affinity with the fen towns. A counterargument was that Bedfordshire had done little to improve Eaton Socon, whereas Huntingdonshire had done much to improve St Neots.

On 1 April 1965, Huntingdonshire was combined with the Soke of Peterborough to form an enlarged county. At the same time the urban area of Eaton Socon became part of St Neots Urban District. In 1974 Huntingdonshire and the Soke of Peterborough were finally merged with Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely, the entire new county being known as Cambridgeshire. The Huntingdonshire County Council therefore disappeared in 1974, and it was replaced by the Huntingdon District Council, which functions as a unit within the enlarged county of Cambridgeshire. The boundaries of the HDC were very similar to those of the former county of Huntingdonshire, with the addition of the Eatons. Huntingdon District Council has now altered its title to the Huntingdonshire District Council. In 1973 St Neots was granted power to create St Neots Town Council, to perpetuate some of the powers for the former St Neots UDC, now abolished.

==Water mains and sewerage==
In May 1885 the members of St Neots Local Board met Mr Spear, a Local Government Inspector, to discuss sanitation in the town. Spear drew attention to many of the cottages which were at that time crammed into the yards and courts behind other buildings. &quot;Day&#x27;s Court, for example, I find badly paved, very dilapidated, no windows in the bedrooms except into the court... and in this court are situated some foul privy pits.&quot; New buildings were considered to be little better. &quot;In the new cottages in East Street the drains are only unsocketed pipes and the sewer gas escapes into the houses... Your Medical Officer of Health speaks almost pathetically of the sanitary conditions of the district, he speaks of the people drinking their own excrement.&quot; The Local Board were unmoved by this dramatic report.

This attitude persisted for another twelve years, when a group of local businessmen made sure that St Neots got a minimal water supply, and some semblance of a sewerage system: in 1898 the St Neots Water Company was formed. Pipes conveyed water to some houses and a septic tank system coped with some of the sewage disposal. In 1907 the local authority, by this time the Urban District Council, took the sanitation services over, but it was still by no means a solution to all the town&#x27;s problems. There was still much open-drain sewerage, and wells were also in use in many homes. In 1914 there were only 250 &quot;better class&quot; homes on the main sewer, with 800 houses using pail privies and even a few earth closets. Water was being supplied to five hundred customers, but the wells were used elsewhere. Twice as much money was spent on scavenging as on sewerage in 1915, and as late as 1931 there were still 700 homes out of a total of 1,250 that were without proper sanitation. It was not until 1936 that St Neots at last acquired a sewage works.

==The river in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries==
The river had been a major transport route before the railways: Navigation Wharf and Hen Brook were crowded with barges bringing commodities into the town, and many more barges passed from King&#x27;s Lynn to Bedford, or onto the River Ivel for Biggleswade and Shefford. After the arrival of the railway in St Neots in 1850, the usage of the river for heavy goods transport declined steeply. The Ivel closed to commercial traffic in 1876 and by 1878 no barges went further upriver than St Neots. By 1890 they were only going up as far as St Ives. The river began to silt up and became choked with weeds. The owner of the navigation rights was John Kirkham; in 1892 he tried to sell the rights, and at first no-one wanted them. Then Leonard Taylor Simpson bought the rights in February 1893, for £6,170. He expended a great deal on improvements to locks and conservancy, but the low level of toll charges, set by statute in the 17th century, made profitability impossible. He lost a lot of money.

In September 1897 Simpson saw that his task was impossible, and he closed the navigation, physically securing the locks to make them impassable. A suit in Chancery was started, arguing that he had an obligation to maintain the river navigation, and also to limit his toll charges to the level originally determined. Appeal and counter-appeal followed, but in 1904 the House of Lords ruled in his favour, allowing him to close the navigation. He did so in August 1904.

The Great Ouse Catchment Board acquired the worthless navigation from him in 1934.

The first settlements in the St Neots area were located clear of areas where flooding might be expected. As the population expanded in medieval times, construction took place in vulnerable areas, resulting in flooding of dwellings. Efforts were made to train the waters, still resulting in flooding if the works were overcome. The worst floods in the nineteenth century were in 1908, 1916/17, 1933/34, and the great flood of 1947.

==Twentieth century wars==

===World War I===
World War I was declared on 4 August 1914. Towards the end of the month, the Council was informed by the Military Authorities that soldiers were to be stationed in the town, and that the town water supply should be laid on to the areas where men and horses would be encamped. The Gun Park (now the site of the Priory Infants School) was made available for the troops, though it was soon realised that the army&#x27;s heavy equipment needed a more solid and less muddy base. Consequently, from December 1915, all artillery and heavy wagons were kept on the Market Square.

The Highland Brigade Royal Field Artillery were stationed at St Neots from August 1914 to April 1915, prior to deployment to France. Three Highland Brigades were stationed at &quot;Bedford&quot;, and it seems that either I Highland Brigade RFA(T) or II Highland Brigade RFA(T) were outbased in St Neots.

I Highland Brigade consisted of three batteries: 1, 2 and 3 Aberdeen Battery RFA(T). II Highland Brigade RFA(T) consisted of three batteries: Forfarshire Battery RFA(T), Fifeshire Battery RFA(T) and Dundee Battery RFA(T). Each battery was equipped with obsolete (Boer War era) 15-pounder field guns.

There was also III Highland Brigade RFA(T), with two batteries each with six howitzers, almost certainly not based in St Neots.

===World War II===
St Neots did not suffer any concerted bombing attack in World War II, although the numerous RAF stations in the surrounding area led to enemy bombers&#x27; attention. An important issue was the reception of evacuated children. The primitive state of basic services is shown by the fact that as war became inevitable, it was urged that trenches should be dug to deal with the extra night soil. Three hundred children arrived two days before war was declared; they were all billeted in homes in Eynesbury. Well over 1,000 were billeted in 1940.

==Population growth==
During the stagecoach era, Eaton Socon had rivalled St Neots in population terms:
* Census year 1801

&quot;Eynesbury had been incorporated into St Neots by the time of the 1951 census.&quot;

The Town Development Act of 1952 was aimed at reducing overcrowding in London, and it has led to the rapid growth of the towns of Huntingdon, St Ives and St Neots in recent years. The population of St Neots had risen to 21,660 in 1982.

==The twentieth century==
===The St Neots Quads===

In 1935 quadruplets were born in St Neots to Mrs Doris Miles. This caused a media sensation, as they were the first British quadruplets to survive more than a few days. Careful attention was given to their early welfare, directed largely by the family doctor, Dr E H Harrisson, who made special arrangements to accommodate them. They were the subject of numerous press and newsreel reports following their progress. They are all alive today (May 2021).

===Little Barford Power Station===

Little Barford A Power Station was commissioned in 1941; it had 126 MW capacity. It burnt pulverised coal, delivered by rail from the adjacent main line. Cooling water was taken from the River Ouse nearby, supplemented by a cooling tower. Little Barford B Power Station nearby was commissioned in 1959 with 127 MW capacity, also using pulverised coal fuel and with cooling towers. Decommissioning and demolition of both stations took place in 1989. 

A gas fired station was commissioned on the same site in 1996. It is a Combined cycle power plant capable of an output of 256 MWe.

===Loss of industry -- and revival===
By the late 20th century, the de-industrialisation which characterised much of Britain affected St Neots with the loss of Courtaulds (formerly Kayser Bondor), Samuel Jones, Gates&#x27; Hydraulics and several others; Paine&#x27;s Brewery was sold and closed. However, the developments associated with housing expansion also brought light and mid-scale industry to the town in modern industrial facilities.

Unemployment rates in Huntingdonshire are lower than the national average: 2.7% compared with an average for England of 4.1%. Full-time workers in Huntingdonshire earned a median weekly salary of £600 in 2018, compared to £575 across England.

==Recent history==
St Neots has been designated for a considerable expansion of housing in the twenty-first century. As well as local in-fill sites, this involved the Loves Farm development in 2006. That development is currently (2021) being extended eastward, and the first stage of the Wintringham Estate, between Cambridge Street and the St Neots by-pass, has been constructed.

<text>Train 48 was a Canadian improvised soap opera, broadcast on Global Television Network and CH from 2003 until 2005. The series was based on the format of an Australian television program called &quot;Going Home&quot;.

==Characters==
* Liz Irwin-Gallo (Krista Sutton) (seasons 1–2, guest season 3) is a marketing expert and a senior executive at TWC, a large pharmaceutical company. After two divorces and a series of unsuccessful relationships, including with fellow passenger Randy, Liz has decided to have a child through in vitro fertilization. The character was shot in the finale of the second season and was in a coma for much of season 3, with Sutton not listed on the main cast, but was a recurring character late in the season with the character recovering from a brain injury induced by the shooting. 
* Johnny McLaughlin (Paul Braunstein) is a &quot;hoser&quot;. A handyman and construction foreman, he is often between jobs.

Joe Dinicol&#x27;s grandfather John Neville played Zach&#x27;s grandfather.

==Production and broadcast==
The show was broadcast daily, and recorded the same day. It took place in a railway car of a GO Train on Lakeshore West line returning from Toronto to the suburb of Burlington, Ontario, and followed the lives of 12 daily commuters through their interactions. Although major plot lines were written in advance, much of the dialogue was improvised by the actors. The entire series was shot on a 64-foot replica of a GO Train Bombardier BiLevel Coach, which kept production costs to a minimum.

The train setting allowed a basic construct where characters would share and act upon their opinions and views. The same-day recording allowed for comments on topical news stories to be introduced. The filming production was completed by 1:30 p.m. and edited by 5:00 p.m., later broadcast into regular time slots in different regions of Canada throughout the day (7:00 p.m. weeknights on Global in Toronto). It is estimated that each 30 minute episode cost $40,000 (Canadian) and had a typical audience of 200,000 to 300,000 viewers a night.

The method of improvisation, developed by show runners Duncan McKenzie and Eric Lunsky, was a hybrid of techniques used by Mike Leigh and Keith Johnstone. Actors worked from outline scripts of just a few lines per scene, and an extensive character bio which provided each actor with a background of events and attitudes which might affect the scene.

The improvised format and quick turnaround enabled the inclusion of references to extremely current events, giving a heightened sense of realism and currency. For example, the 2003 North America blackout was mentioned the next day. The show typically dealt with fictional relationships, humour and the non-fictional topics mentioned were the cases of Scott Peterson, Karla Homolka, the SARS outbreak and different views about US President George W. Bush.

During the production of the series between 2003 and 2004, four episodes were aired on Global Television Network during the week. However, in 2005, this was reduced to three. The series dealt with such controversial issues as the adoption of babies by gay couples, in vitro fertilization, single parent families, and euthanasia. A number of events occurred which would be unusual on a real commuter train, including the death of a passenger, a beating, a shooting, an escaped snake, a party, and sex in the train washroom.

CanWest Global in partnership with Global had promoted the series with stories and columns in the &quot;National Post&quot; and other CanWest News newspapers.

===Theme song===
The series theme song was titled &quot;Train goes&quot; by Adam Crossley and 9 Point Landing.

==Dilemmas and criticism==
When &quot;Train 48&quot; debuted, product placement was an important aspect of the show for the Global Television Network. Characters were seen using Fido cell phones, and if someone was seen reading the newspaper, it was the &quot;National Post&quot;, a newspaper owned by CanWest, the parent company of Global Television. The show&#x27;s producers argued that product placement was there to make the show seem more real. Later in the series, the use of product placement diminished, and the range of reading materials and products on the show became more diverse.

==Cancellation==
The cancellation of the show was announced publicly on June 2, 2005, by series producer Cindy Wrong. She stated that the final episode would be shown on July 1. After the finale, re-runs of the last few episodes aired until the finale was shown again on September 2. The show was cancelled in order to make way for the launch of &quot;Entertainment Tonight Canada&quot;.

The producers received word of the show&#x27;s cancellation ahead of time, allowing them to bring the stories to a conclusion. Throughout the series, viewers had frequently commented that the train seemed to be on a journey to nowhere. In response to this criticism, the final episode showed the train stopped, and showed, through the windows, the characters emerging from the train onto the platform at Burlington. This was the only time in the series that characters were ever seen outside the train.

==Home media==
The producers of &quot;Train 48&quot; have uploaded the entire series to YouTube for Canadian viewers. In the United States and Canada, episodes can be viewed on Amazon Prime Video&#x27;s on demand platform.

==Legacy==
During a 2019 reunion, four actors who appeared on &quot;Train 48&quot; described the series as &quot;progressive and innovative&quot;. &quot;It was one of the first shows on Canadian TV that had a transgendered actor in a leading role. It dealt with plot lines around gay marriage, gay relationships, interracial marriage, interracial relationships&quot;, said Raoul Bhaneja. &quot;The show was very progressive and as an ethnic actor on a Canadian television series, it was nice to see a plotline that puts people first.&quot;

<text>Poslovni sistem Mercator, d.o.o. (; Latin for &#x27;merchant&#x27;) is a Slovenian business conglomerate. One of the largest companies in Slovenia by annual revenue, it is the parent company of the Mercator Group of supermarket chains. It is wholly owned by the Croatian joint-stock company Fortenova Group.

In addition to Slovenia, Mercator Group is also present in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia. The core business of the Mercator Group is the retail of everyday consumer goods through a diversified retail network across Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro.

Mercator dates back to 1949 and the founding of the wholesale company Živila Ljubljana – the predecessor of Poslovni sistem Mercator, d. d., which was reorganised as a limited liability company on 4 July 2022. At the time of its founding, Mercator sold goods from a warehouse. Today, however, Mercator is one of the most modern retailers in the region with 20,300 employees across the entire Mercator Group.

Since April 2021, Mercator has been owned by Fortenova Group It acquired the shares from Agrokor, which had bought the Slovenian retailer in 2014. Fortenova initially owned 89.11% of Mercator, increasing its stake to 90.005% after the general meeting held in September 2021. Fortenova became the sole owner of Mercator on 1 April 2022, after forcing out minority shareholders. Then, in mid-April, the General Assembly approved the delisting of the company&#x27;s shares from the stock exchange.

Mercator aims to establish state-of-the-art store concepts on all of its markets. Its continued growth is based on efficient business models that include an attractive offer for customers, long-term partnerships with local and regional suppliers, new store concepts, as well as operational efficiency and cost efficiency across all the areas of its business.

==Retail markets of the Mercator Group==
===Slovenia===
Poslovni sistem Mercator, d.o.o., is the largest retail company in Slovenia with 1,014 retail units, 466 of which are located in Slovenia, 341 in Serbia, 128 in Montenegro, and 79 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It also boasts 163 franchise stores in Slovenia (as of 31 December 2021). 

The company&#x27;s core business is the sale of consumer goods, with a separate business area for homeware (M Tehnika, 41 stores) and wholesale (13 Cash&amp;Carry centres).

Mercator&#x27;s two independent production companies Mercator – Emba, d.o.o., and Mercator IP, d.o.o. are also active on the Slovenian market. Moreover, Mercator also owns the company M – Energija, d.o.o., which runs the Maxen self-service gas stations.

Mercator was the first retailer of everyday products in Slovenia with its own e-commerce website, the first retailer to set up self-service checkouts, the first retailer to enable shopping with the M Sken and M Sken MOBILE apps, and the first retailer to develop the Moj M mobile platform with the M Pay mobile wallet.

Mercator is constantly integrating innovative solutions with its services and offers, gradually changing and upgrading them, adapting them to the needs of customers, and replacing some of them with new ones. This way, it keeps improving both the shopping experience and its own performance, providing customers with what they want, what they need, and what holds added value for them at a given moment, thus developing stores that are tailored to the customer&#x27;s needs.

Mercator&#x27;s online store, which has been successfully running for more than two decades, is becoming an essential part of Mercator&#x27;s digital transformation. Its goal is to solidify Mercator&#x27;s omnipresence or omni-channel approach and secure Mercator&#x27;s position as the customer&#x27;s first choice in any given place and at any given moment. Mercator continuously improves its offer so as to make it attractive and tailored to online customers and their buying habits.

Mercator is investing heavily in the digitisation of its business processes and in digital communication, which it considers to be one of its strategic segments. Thus, in 2021, Mercator introduced a new digital communication channel and an innovative ecosystem that provides users with a holistic experience both inside and outside the digital environment, and goes beyond the limits of traditional communication. Mercator was the first retailer to launch its own media, the content video platform www.msoseska.tv. It is aimed at a broad spectrum of users, regardless of their age and lifestyle, who want to view short and useful content – not only for entertainment, but also whenever they need advice, want to save time, or want to make their work easier. Certain pieces of content on M Soseska (M Neighbourhood) also reflect Mercator&#x27;s involvement in the Slovenian culture and sports, which Mercator has been supporting for many years.

== Regional presence of the Mercator Group ==
In addition to Slovenia, Mercator operates as a local retailer in three other markets in the region: Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro.

=== Serbia ===
The first Mercator store in Belgrade, Serbia opened in 2002. Today, Mercator S, d.o.o., Serbia has a total of 341 stores in many Serbian cities under the Mercator, Roda, and Idea brands.

=== Montenegro ===
Mercator entered the Montenegrin market in 2007. It has been operating under the Idea brand since 2017.

=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===
In 2000, Mercator opened its first store in Sarajevo. In 2014, all stores owned by Mercator BH, d.o.o., Bosnia and Herzegovina were transferred to Konzum. In September 2017, all 83 stores were reacquired by Mercator BH, d.o.o., Bosnia and Herzegovina.

=== Croatia ===
In 2014, Mercator&#x27;s operations in Croatia were acquired by Konzum. Mercator H, d.o.o., Croatia, has retained the real estate operations.

<doc id="344221" wikidata="Q980691" url="?curid=344221" title="George Blanda">
<text>George Frederick Blanda (September 17, 1927 – September 27, 2010) was an American professional football quarterback and placekicker who played in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL). Blanda played 26 seasons of professional football, the most in the sport&#x27;s history, and had scored more points than anyone in history at the time of his retirement.

Blanda retired from pro football in August 1976 as the sport&#x27;s oldest player at the age of 48, a mark that still stands. One of only three players to play in four different decades (the other two being John Carney and Jeff Feagles), he holds the record for most extra points made (943) and attempted (959).

==College career==
Blanda was a quarterback and kicker at Kentucky from 1945 to 1948. Coach Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant, who later won fame and set countless records at Southeastern Conference rival Alabama, arrived in his sophomore year, following a 1–9 season in 1945. The Wildcats lost only three games in each of the next three years.

Blanda was the starting quarterback his last two seasons at Kentucky (1947–1948), compiling 120 completions in 242 passes (49.6 percent completions), 1,451 yards and 12 touchdowns.

==Professional career==

===Chicago Bears===
Blanda was signed by the Chicago Bears for $600 in 1949, an amount owner George Halas demanded back when he made the team. Blanda was given a lucrative contract of $6000, as the $600 was just a sign on bonus. While primarily used as a quarterback and placekicker, Blanda also saw time on the defensive side of the ball at linebacker. It was not until 1953 that Blanda emerged as the Bears&#x27; top quarterback, but an injury the following year effectively ended his first-string status. For the next four years, he was used mostly in a kicking capacity. Later commenting on his testy relationship with Halas, Blanda noted, &quot;he was too cheap to even buy me a kicking shoe.&quot; Blanda later reflected that by the 1950s the pro game had moved beyond Halas, who seemed to lack the interest he had earlier.

===Houston Oilers===

Blanda retired after the 1958 season because of Halas&#x27; insistence on only using him as a kicker, but returned in 1960 upon the formation of the American Football League. He signed with the Houston Oilers as both a quarterback and kicker. He was derided by the sports media as an &quot;NFL Reject&quot;, but he went on to lead the Oilers to the first two league titles in AFL history, and he was the All-AFL quarterback and won AFL Player of the Year honors in 1961. During that season, he led the AFL in passing yards (3,330) and touchdown passes (36). His 36 touchdown passes in 1961 were the most ever thrown by any NFL/AFL quarterback in a single season, until matched by Y. A. Tittle of the NFL New York Giants two years later in . Blanda&#x27;s and Tittle&#x27;s mark remained the record until surpassed by Dan Marino&#x27;s 48 touchdown passes in 1984. In the 1961 title game, he threw five interceptions, becoming the fourth quarterback in football history to do so in a playoff game. However, the Oilers won 10–3 on the strength of a tough defense that held the San Diego Chargers to no points until late in the fourth quarter, and Blanda made a field goal and threw a touchdown pass to Billy Cannon in the win. Of all players to throw five interceptions or more in a playoff game, Blanda is the only one who did not lose the game.

During 1962, he had two 400-yard passing days for the Oilers: a 464-yard effort against the Buffalo Bills on October 29, with four touchdown passes (winning 28–16); and 418 yards three weeks later against the Titans of New York, this time with seven touchdown passes in a 49–13 victory. Blanda passed for 36 touchdowns that season. Blanda threw 42 interceptions that season, a record that still stands as the only quarterback to throw 40 interceptions in a season. In the 1962 title game that went to double overtime, he kicked a field goal and threw for a touchdown pass but had his fifth interception occur late to eventually set up the game-ending field goal. On thirteen occasions, he connected on four or more touchdown passes during a game, and on November 1, 1964, unleashed 68 passes for Houston against the eventual champion Buffalo Bills.

From 1963 to 1965, Blanda led the AFL in passing attempts and completions, and ranked in the top ten for attempts, completions, yards and touchdowns during seven consecutive seasons. The 1966 season would see Blanda&#x27;s Oilers begin the season with a 3–5 record despite a statistically prolific connection with receiver Charley Frazier. Blanda would cede playing time at quarterback to the 25-year-old Don Trull, though Blanda continued to serve as the team&#x27;s primary kicker. A four-time AFL All-Star, Blanda&#x27;s already-long career seemed over when he was released by the Oilers on March 18, 1967. However, the Oakland Raiders signed him that July, seeing his potential as a contributing backup passer and a dependable kicker.

In later years, Blanda remained a strong supporter of AFL heritage, saying: &quot;That first year, the Houston Oilers or Los Angeles Chargers (24–16 losers to the Oilers in the title game) could have beaten the NFL champion (Philadelphia) in a Super Bowl.&quot; Blanda said further: &quot;I think the AFL was capable of beating the NFL in a Super Bowl game as far back as 1960 or &#x27;61. I just regret we didn&#x27;t get the chance to prove it.&quot;

===Oakland Raiders===
In 1967, Blanda&#x27;s first season with the Raiders, his kicking skills helped him lead the AFL in scoring with 116 points. In two instances, his leg helped play a role in Raider victories: a trio of field goals helped upset the defending league champion Kansas City Chiefs on October 1; in the closing weeks of the regular season, Blanda booted four field goals behind a hostile Houston crowd in a 19–7 victory over his former team, the Oilers, helping gain a measure of revenge. Three weeks later, the Raiders met the Oilers again in the AFL Championship Game and won 40–7.

The Raiders went on to compete in Super Bowl II, but lost the game to the Green Bay Packers.

In 1970, Blanda was released during the exhibition season, but bounced back to establish his 21st professional season. During that season, Blanda, at age 43, had a remarkable five-game run. Against the Steelers, Blanda threw for three touchdowns in relief of an injured Daryle Lamonica. One week later, his 48-yard field goal with three seconds remaining salvaged a 17–17 tie with the Kansas City Chiefs. On November 8, he again came off the bench to throw a touchdown pass to tie the Cleveland Browns with 1:34 remaining, then kicked a 53-yard field goal with 0:03 left for the 23–20 win. Immediately after the winning field goal, Raiders radio announcer Bill King excitedly declared, &quot;George Blanda has just been elected King of the World!&quot; In the team&#x27;s next game, Blanda replaced Lamonica in the fourth quarter and connected with Fred Biletnikoff on a touchdown pass with 2:28 left in the game to defeat the Denver Broncos, 24–19. The following week, Blanda&#x27;s 16-yard field goal in the closing seconds defeated the San Diego Chargers, 20–17.

In the AFC title game against the Baltimore Colts, Blanda again relieved an injured Lamonica, completing 17 of 32 passes for 217 yards and two touchdowns while also kicking a 48-yard field goal and two extra points, keeping the Raiders in the game until the final quarter, when he was intercepted twice. Aged 43, he became the oldest quarterback ever to play in a championship game, and was one of the few remaining straight-ahead kickers in the NFL.

Blanda&#x27;s achievements resulted in his winning the Bert Bell Award. Chiefs&#x27; owner Lamar Hunt said, &quot;Why, this George Blanda is as good as his father, who used to play for Houston.&quot; Although he never again played a major role at quarterback, Blanda served as the Raiders&#x27; kicker for five more seasons. Blanda was also named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year, being the first-ever professional football player to earn the award. He finished 2nd in the Associated Press MVP voting to John Brodie.

He played in his last game at Pittsburgh&#x27;s Three Rivers Stadium on January 4, 1976, at age 48, in the 1975 AFC Championship Game, in which he kicked a 41-yard field goal and made one extra point as the Raiders lost to the Steelers 16–10. Blanda was released during training camp in late August 1976 and succeeded at kicker by rookie Fred Steinfort. Blanda never played football again, but he harbored no ill feelings when the Raiders went on to win the NFL title that year in Super Bowl XI (incidentally, Steinfort was injured in mid-season and was replaced by 35-year-old veteran Errol Mann).
==NFL/AFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
===Postseason===
==Records and honors==
Blanda finished his 26 professional football seasons having completed 1,911 of 4,007 pass attempts for 26,920 yards and 236 touchdowns. Blanda also held the NFL record for most interceptions thrown with 277, until Brett Favre broke it on October 14, 2007. He rushed for 344 yards and 9 touchdowns on the ground, kicked 335 of 641 field goals, and 943 of 959 extra points, giving him 2,002 total points. Additional stats include 1 interception, 2 kickoff returns for 19 yards, 22 punts for 809 yards, and 23 fumble recoveries.

Blanda holds the following professional football records:

* Most seasons played: 26 (1949–1958, 1960–1975)
* Most seasons scoring a point: 26
* One of two players to play in 4 different decades. Blanda played in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and John Carney, who played in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s
* Oldest player to play in an NFL game: 
* Most interceptions thrown, single season: 42 (1962)
* Passing touchdowns in a game: 7 (Tied with 7 others) November 19, 1961, vs. New York Titans
* Most PATs made (943) and attempted (959)

He is the placekicker on the All-Time All-AFL Team, and was one of only 20 players to play all ten years of the AFL, as well as one of only three who were in every AFL game their teams played. Blanda was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1981, his first year of eligibility, and also was inducted into the University of Kentucky Hall of Fame.

Blanda held the record for most professional football games played with 340 until September 26, 2004, when it was broken by another placekicker, Morten Andersen as well as the record for most consecutive games played until September 26, 1976, by defensive end Jim Marshall. He still holds the record for most games played by an AFL/NFL player who was not exclusively a kicker or punter. His 114 postseason points were an NFL record at the time of his retirement.

Blanda broke Lou Groza&#x27;s career scoring record in 1971, a record he held until 2000 when it was broken by Gary Anderson. Blanda&#x27;s 2,002 total points are still good for 7th on the all-time scoring list.

U.S. Route 119 in Blanda&#x27;s hometown of Youngwood, Pennsylvania, was renamed George Blanda Boulevard in 1985.

In 1999, Blanda was ranked number 98 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;″ list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.

Blanda was the first-ever recorded fantasy football draft pick when the game was first created in 1962 by The Greater Oakland Professional Pigskin Prognosticators League.

==Personal life==
Blanda was the son of a Slovak-born Pittsburgh-area coal miner. He was married to Betty Harris from December 17, 1949, until his death on September 27, 2010, ten days after his 83rd birthday. They had two children.

===Death===
According to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Blanda died after a &quot;short illness&quot; on September 27, 2010. He was 83 years old. A moment of silence was held in Blanda&#x27;s honor prior to the start of the September 27, 2010, game between the Green Bay Packers and the Chicago Bears on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, from Soldier Field.

==Legacy==

The 1970s TV series &quot;Happy Days&quot; was set in 1950s Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In the Season 3 episode &quot;Football Frolics&quot;, first aired January 20, 1976, Richie Cunningham (played by Ron Howard) and Ralph Malph (Donny Most) are watching the December 9, 1956, Chicago Bears – Chicago Cardinals televised game. After Ed Brown&#x27;s pass to Harlon Hill is intercepted by the Cardinals, Richie wants &quot;the other quarterback&quot; put in. Ralph says that the other quarterback is &quot;washed up. He&#x27;s old. He&#x27;s 30. He&#x27;s got no future.&quot; Richie argues back, &quot;George Blanda has two or three good years left.&quot; The joke was that Blanda, 19 years after the date depicted in the show, was still playing.

Towards the end of his career, Blanda also served as a commercial spokesman for Chrysler Corporation. He was often seen in television commercials promoting the full-size Dodge Truck line, most notably its new &quot;Club Cab&quot; after the line received a complete redesign in 1973. Blanda also appeared in commercials for Schaefer Beer, Brut cologne, Kellogg&#x27;s cereals and many others during the early 1970s.

<doc id="344230" wikidata="Q1872199" url="?curid=344230" title="Louise Thaden">
<text>Iris Louise McPhetridge Thaden (born Louise McPhetridge; November 12, 1905 – November 9, 1979) was an American aviation pioneer, holder of numerous aviation records, and the first woman to win the Bendix trophy, alongside Blanche Noyes. She was inducted into the Arkansas Aviation Historical Society&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1980.

==Birth and education==
Louise McPhetridge was born in Bentonville, Arkansas, and attended Bentonville public schools. McPhetridge attended the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Arkansas, from 1921 to 1926 and studied as a journalism, physical education, and pre-medical major.

==Aviation==
In 1926, McPhetridge was working for the J.H.J. Turner Coal Co. where one of her main customers was the Travel Air Corporation in Wichita, Kansas, owned by Walter Beech. Beech liked McPhetridge and offered her a job as a sales representative in San Francisco, California, which she accepted. Her salary included free pilot&#x27;s lessons, and she earned her pilot&#x27;s certificate in 1928. She was the first female pilot to be licensed by the state of Ohio.

==Marriage==
McPhetridge met Herbert von Thaden, who was a United States Army Signal Corps pilot and engineer who worked on developing the first American all-metal aircraft, the Thaden T-2. McPhetridge and von Thaden were married in San Francisco on June 19, 1928. By 1929, Louise Thaden had become only the fourth woman to hold a transport pilot rating.

==Records==
Thaden rapidly became a major figure in the aviation world and set many world performance records and won many major flying events. In 1929, she became the first pilot to hold the women&#x27;s altitude, endurance and speed records in light planes simultaneously. Thaden set the women&#x27;s altitude record in December 1928 with a mark of 20,260 feet. In March 1929, she set the women&#x27;s endurance record with a flight of 22 hours, 3 minutes, 12 seconds.

Following the fatal crash of Florence Klingensmith at the 1933 International Air Races, women were not allowed to enter the national air racing competition in 1934 due to sexism.

==Women&#x27;s Air Derby==
Thaden was a friend and rival of pioneer aviators Amelia Earhart, Pancho Barnes, Opal Kunz, and Blanche Noyes. Thaden defeated her colleagues in the first Women&#x27;s Air Derby, also known as the Powder Puff Derby, in 1929. The Air Derby was a transcontinental race from Santa Monica, California to Cleveland, Ohio, which was the site of the National Air Races that year. It took place from August 13–20, 1929. Twenty women were entered in the race. Marvel Crosson was killed. Earhart damaged her aircraft at Yuma, Arizona, Barnes became lost and flew into Mexico and damaged her plane attempting to get back on course, and Noyes suffered an in-flight fire over Texas.

==Middle career==
In 1930, Thaden went to work as the public relations director of Pittsburgh Aviation Industries (which had recently purchased her husband&#x27;s Thaden Metal Aircraft Company) and became the director of the Women&#x27;s Division of the Penn School of Aeronautics. That same year, Thaden and Earhart participated in the founding of an international organization for women pilots called the Ninety-Nines. Thaden turned down the presidency of the organization but served as the treasurer and vice-president. The Ninety-Nine organization still exists. In 1935, Phoebe Omlie, another pioneer female aviator, asked Thaden to become a field representative for the National Air Marking Program.

In 1936, Thaden won the Bendix Trophy Race in the first year women were allowed access to compete against men. She set a new world record of 14 hours, 55 minutes from New York City to Los Angeles, California. In her astonishing victory, she flew a Beech C17R Staggerwing biplane and defeated twin-engine planes specifically designed for racing. Laura Ingalls, another aviator, came in second by 45 minutes flying a Lockheed Orion. First prize was $4,500, and she also won the $2,500 prize for a woman finishing. &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote on September 14, 1936:
To Pilots Thaden &amp; Noyes the $7,000 prize money was far less gratifying than the pleasure of beating the men. Among the first ten U.S. women to earn transport licenses, they have for years been front-line fighters in aviation&#x27;s &quot;battle of the sexes.&quot; A fuzzy-haired blonde of 30, Mrs. Thaden has been flying since 1927, has held the women&#x27;s speed, altitude and endurance records, is the mother of a 6-year-old son. She and Flyer Noyes both work regularly as air-marking pilots for the Department of Commerce. Short, brunette Mrs. Noyes is better known as the only pilot ever to fly John D. Rockefeller Sr. In the National Air Races, men contestants have always patronized women, in 1934 ousted them altogether. Smilingly observed Pilots Thaden and Noyes last week when they found they had won one of the two most important events of the Races: &quot;Well, that&#x27;s a surprise! We expected to be the cow&#x27;s tail.&quot;
For her achievements Thaden won aviation&#x27;s highest honor given to women, the Harmon Trophy.

==Aviation career==
Thaden teamed up with Frances Marsalis and set another endurance record by flying a Curtiss Thrush high-wing monoplane over Long Island, New York for 196 hours. The pair made seventy-eight air-to-air refueling maneuvers. Food and water were lowered to the two by means of a rope from another aircraft. The event gained national attention and the pair made a series of live radio broadcasts from the aircraft.

In 1937, she became the National Secretary of the National Aeronautics Association. Just prior to her retirement, she returned to Beech Aircraft Corporation as a factory representative and demonstration pilot.

==Retirement==
Thaden retired from competition in 1938. She worked for a time with the Bureau of Air Commerce to promote the creation of airfields. She also wrote her memoirs, &quot;High, Wide and Frightened&quot; soon after her retirement. In addition to her memoirs, she wrote numerous newspaper and magazine articles dealing with aviation issues. Thaden said women were &quot;innately better pilots than men.&quot; The final chapter of her autobiography, &quot;Noble Experiment,&quot; omitted from the 1973 and 2004 reissues of the book, is a short story giving a dystopian vision of the use of women in combat. It gains particular pertinence in its implicit criticism of the strategic bombing theories of Giulio Douhet and William (&quot;Billy&quot;) Mitchell.

The Arkansas Aviation Historical Society selected Thaden in 1980 as one of five initial inductees in the Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame.

==Death==
Thaden died of a heart attack at High Point, North Carolina on November 9, 1979.

<text>The average absolute deviation (AAD) of a data set is the average of the absolute deviations from a central point. It is a summary statistic of statistical dispersion or variability. In the general form, the central point can be a mean, median, mode, or the result of any other measure of central tendency or any reference value related to the given data set. 
AAD includes the mean absolute deviation and the &quot;median absolute deviation&quot; (both abbreviated as MAD).

== Measures of dispersion ==
Several measures of statistical dispersion are defined in terms of the absolute deviation.
The term &quot;average absolute deviation&quot; does not uniquely identify a measure of statistical dispersion, as there are several measures that can be used to measure absolute deviations, and there are several measures of central tendency that can be used as well. Thus, to uniquely identify the absolute deviation it is necessary to specify both the measure of deviation and the measure of central tendency. The statistical literature has not yet adopted a standard notation, as both the mean absolute deviation around the mean and the median absolute deviation around the median have been denoted by their initials &quot;MAD&quot; in the literature, which may lead to confusion, since they generally have values considerably different from each other.

== Mean absolute deviation around a central point ==

The mean absolute deviation of a set &quot;X&quot; = {&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, …, &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;} is
formula_1

The choice of measure of central tendency, formula_2, has a marked effect on the value of the mean deviation. For example, for the data set {2, 2, 3, 4, 14}:

=== Mean absolute deviation around the mean ===

The mean absolute deviation (MAD), also referred to as the &quot;mean deviation&quot; or sometimes &quot;average absolute deviation&quot;, is the mean of the data&#x27;s absolute deviations around the data&#x27;s mean: the average (absolute) distance from the mean. &quot;Average absolute deviation&quot; can refer to either this usage, or to the general form with respect to a specified central point (see above).

MAD has been proposed to be used in place of standard deviation since it corresponds better to real life. Because the MAD is a simpler measure of variability than the standard deviation, it can be useful in school teaching.

This method&#x27;s forecast accuracy is very closely related to the mean squared error (MSE) method which is just the average squared error of the forecasts. Although these methods are very closely related, MAD is more commonly used because it is both easier to compute (avoiding the need for squaring) and easier to understand.

For the normal distribution, the ratio of mean absolute deviation from the mean to standard deviation is formula_3. Thus if &quot;X&quot; is a normally distributed random variable with expected value 0 then, see Geary (1935):
formula_4
In other words, for a normal distribution, mean absolute deviation is about 0.8 times the standard deviation.
However, in-sample measurements deliver values of the ratio of mean average deviation / standard deviation for a given Gaussian sample &quot;n&quot; with the following bounds: formula_5, with a bias for small &quot;n&quot;.

The mean absolute deviation from the mean is less than or equal to the standard deviation; one way of proving this relies on Jensen&#x27;s inequality.

=== Mean absolute deviation around the median ===

The median is the point about which the mean deviation is minimized. The MAD median offers a direct measure of the scale of a random variable around its median
formula_6

This is the maximum likelihood estimator of the scale parameter formula_7 of the Laplace distribution. 

Since the median minimizes the average absolute distance, we have formula_8.
The mean absolute deviation from the median is less than or equal to the mean absolute deviation from the mean. In fact, the mean absolute deviation from the median is always less than or equal to the mean absolute deviation from any other fixed number.

By using the general dispersion function, Habib (2011) defined MAD about median as
formula_9
where the indicator function is
formula_10

This representation allows for obtaining MAD median correlation coefficients.

== Median absolute deviation around a central point ==
While in principle the mean or any other central point could be taken as the central point for the median absolute deviation, most often the median value is taken instead.

=== Median absolute deviation around the median ===
The &quot;median absolute deviation&quot; (also MAD) is the &quot;median&quot; of the absolute deviation from the &quot;median&quot;. It is a robust estimator of dispersion. 

For the example {2, 2, 3, 4, 14}: 3 is the median, so the absolute deviations from the median are {1, 1, 0, 1, 11} (reordered as {0, 1, 1, 1, 11}) with a median of 1, in this case unaffected by the value of the outlier 14, so the median absolute deviation is 1.

For a symmetric distribution, the median absolute deviation is equal to half the interquartile range.

== Maximum absolute deviation ==
The maximum absolute deviation around an arbitrary point is the maximum of the absolute deviations of a sample from that point. While not strictly a measure of central tendency, the maximum absolute deviation can be found using the formula for the average absolute deviation as above with formula_11, where formula_12 is the sample maximum.

== Minimization ==
The measures of statistical dispersion derived from absolute deviation characterize various measures of central tendency as &quot;minimizing&quot; dispersion:
The median is the measure of central tendency most associated with the absolute deviation. Some location parameters can be compared as follows:
* &quot;L&quot;2 norm statistics: the mean minimizes the mean squared error
* &quot;L&quot;1 norm statistics: the median minimizes &quot;average&quot; absolute deviation,
* &quot;L&quot;∞ norm statistics: the mid-range minimizes the &quot;maximum&quot; absolute deviation
* trimmed &quot;L&quot;∞ norm statistics: for example, the midhinge (average of first and third quartiles) which minimizes the &quot;median&quot; absolute deviation of the whole distribution, also minimizes the &quot;maximum&quot; absolute deviation of the distribution after the top and bottom 25% have been trimmed off.

== Estimation ==
The mean absolute deviation of a sample is a biased estimator of the mean absolute deviation of the population.
In order for the absolute deviation to be an unbiased estimator, the expected value (average) of all the sample absolute deviations must equal the population absolute deviation. However, it does not. For the population 1,2,3 both the population absolute deviation about the median and the population absolute deviation about the mean are 2/3. The average of all the sample absolute deviations about the mean of size 3 that can be drawn from the population is 44/81, while the average of all the sample absolute deviations about the median is 4/9. Therefore, the absolute deviation is a biased estimator.

However, this argument is based on the notion of mean-unbiasedness. Each measure of location has its own form of unbiasedness (see entry on biased estimator). The relevant form of unbiasedness here is median unbiasedness.

<text>Joseph Jean Arthur Béliveau (August 31, 1931 – December 2, 2014) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player who played parts of 20 seasons with the National Hockey League&#x27;s (NHL) Montreal Canadiens from 1950 to 1971. Inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1972, &quot;Le Gros Bill&quot; Béliveau is widely regarded as one of the ten greatest NHL players of all time. Born in Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Béliveau first played professionally in the Quebec Major Hockey League (QMHL). He made his NHL debut with the Canadiens in 1950, but chose to remain in the QMHL full-time until 1953.

By his second season in the NHL, Béliveau was among the top three scorers. He was the fourth player to score 500 goals and the second to score 1,000 points. Béliveau won two Hart Memorial Trophies as league MVP (1956, 1964) and one Art Ross Trophy as top scorer (1956), as well as the inaugural Conn Smythe Trophy as play-off MVP (1965). He has 17 Stanley Cup championships, the most by any individual to date. All championships have been with the Montreal Canadiens: 10 as a player and 7 as an executive. In 2017, Béliveau was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

==Early life==
Béliveau was born in Trois-Rivières, Quebec on August 31, 1931, the son of Arthur Béliveau and Lorette Dubé. Arthur worked as an electrician, installing power lines for Shawinigan Water and Power. This work had the family moving several times while Béliveau was young, moving to Plessisville when he was 3 years old and then to Victoriaville at the age of 6. Like many future hockey players of the era, the Béliveau family had a backyard ice rink on which their children, friends, and neighbours played shinny. Until he was twelve years old, the family rink was where Jean learned to play hockey. His first organized team was in a house league at L&#x27;Académie, which played on the school&#x27;s rink. As part of a squad of L&#x27;Académie &quot;all-stars,&quot; Jean played against other local teams. At age fifteen, he entered college and played for its team and an intermediate team, the Victoriaville Panthers. In 1947, he joined the junior Victoriaville Tigres. In the 1948–49 season, his second with the team, Béliveau placed seventh in the league in scoring with 75 points in 42 games. Prior to the 1949–50 season he joined the Quebec Citadelles. With 80 points in 35 games, Béliveau finished second in league scoring, behind Bernard Geoffrion. It was around this time that he acquired the nickname &quot;Le Gros Bill (). Coined by journalist Roland Sabourin, the name came from the Quebecois film &quot;Le Gros Bill&quot;, which was released in 1949.

In the summertime as a child, Béliveau also played baseball. A stand-out in local leagues in Victoriaville, he pitched and occasionally played infield, well enough that his family turned down an offer of a minor-league pro contract for Jean at age fifteen. At sixteen, Jean played for the senior league team in Val-d&#x27;Or, Quebec.

==Playing career==
Béliveau was already a star at 15 when spotted by Canadiens general manager Frank Selke, who sought to sign him to an NHL &quot;C-form&quot;. The standard league contract for young players at that time, it would have required Béliveau to join the Canadiens at a set date and agreed-upon salary. When his father balked, Béliveau signed a &quot;B-form&quot; instead, agreeing to play for Montreal should he ever decide to turn pro.

Béliveau was called up twice for brief appearances by the Canadiens in 1950–51 and 1952–53, each time playing the maximum number of games that an amateur could play at the professional level. He led the Quebec Senior Hockey League in scoring in 1953. However, he did not appear to show much interest in playing professionally. Finally, Selke got an idea—if the QSHL were somehow turned into a professional league, Béliveau would be a professional as well, and under the terms of the B-form he would have to sign with the Habs. At Selke&#x27;s suggestion, the Canadiens&#x27; owners, the Canadian Arena Company, bought the QSHL and converted it from an amateur league to a minor pro league. This forced Béliveau to join the Canadiens for the 1953–54 NHL season (though the Habs owned the NHL rights to all of the league&#x27;s players in any case).

Béliveau retired at the end of the 1970–71 NHL season as his team&#x27;s all-time leader in points, second all-time in goals and the NHL&#x27;s all-time leading playoff scorer. He scored 507 goals and had 712 assists for 1,219 points in 1,125 NHL regular-season games plus 79 goals and 97 assists for 176 points in 162 playoff games. His jersey number (#4) was retired on October 9, 1971. In 1972, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He is now the second all-time leading scorer in Canadiens history, behind Guy Lafleur. Only Henri Richard (1256 games) and Larry Robinson (1202 games) played more games for the Habs. Béliveau&#x27;s name appears on the Stanley Cup a record seventeen times, including seven times as an executive for the Canadiens: 1973, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1986, 1993. In addition to winning the Hart Trophy as league MVP twice, he finished second in the voting a further four times, and third once. As well, in addition to winning the Art Ross Trophy as the leading scorer once, he finished second twice and third four times, illustrating his remarkable long-term consistency. In 1998, &quot;The Hockey News&quot; named Béliveau the seventh greatest NHL player of all time. Upon his retirement, the Canadiens named Béliveau a vice president and director of public relations.

Béliveau was never known as an activist during his playing days. However, he was one of several players who threatened to pull out of the Hall of Fame if disgraced ex-NHLPA executive director Alan Eagleson had been allowed to stay in after being convicted of fraud and embezzlement. He also supported the NHL&#x27;s position during the 2004–05 NHL lockout, arguing that the players&#x27; demands would damage the sport and the league.

==Personal life and death==

Béliveau met his future wife, Élise Couture, in 1950 in Quebec City. The couple married on June 27, 1953, at Saint-Patrick Church there, and had one child together, daughter Hélène. In 1957, Béliveau appeared in full uniform on the American game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;.

Upon retiring as a player in 1971 Béliveau set up the charitable Jean Béliveau Foundation, transferred two decades later to the Society for Disabled Children in 1993.

In the early 1990s, he twice declined Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney’s offer of a Senate appointment, as he believed legislators should only be elected. In 1994 Prime Minister Jean Chrétien offered him the post of Governor General of Canada. Béliveau declined in order to be with his daughter and two grandchildren, Mylène and Magalie, whose father, a Quebec policeman, had committed suicide when the girls were five and three.

Beginning in the 1990s, Béliveau suffered from multiple health issues. He was first hospitalized for cardiac problems in 1996. In 2000, he was treated for a neck tumour. NHL.com reported on January 21, 2010, that Béliveau was admitted to Montréal General Hospital the previous evening with an apparent stroke that was not thought to be life-threatening. Béliveau was hospitalized with a stroke again on February 28, 2012.

Béliveau died on December 2, 2014, at the age of 83, in Longueuil, a suburb of Montreal. His public funeral was held at Mary Queen of the World Cathedral in Montreal.

==Legacy==

Béliveau was given many awards, including several honorary doctorates from Canadian universities, plus the Loyola Medal from Concordia University in 1995. He was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec in 1988, promoted to Officer in 2006 and Grand Officer in 2010.

On May 6, 1998, Béliveau was made by Governor General Roméo LeBlanc a Companion of the Order of Canada, then the country&#x27;s highest civilian award. In 2001, his name was added to Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame, the same year he was honoured with his portrait on a Canadian postage stamp. In August 2008, the Canadian Pacific Railway named a station in his honour. On June 29, 2009, he was named an honorary captain of the men&#x27;s national team for the 2010 Winter Olympics.

<text>Manuel Vázquez Montalbán (14 June 1939–18 October 2003) was a prolific Spanish writer from Barcelona: journalist, novelist, poet, essayist, anthologue, prologist, humorist, critic and political prisoner as well as a gastronome and an FC Barcelona supporter.

== Biography==
Vázquez Montalbán was born in Barcelona on 14 June 1939. His parents did not register his birth until 27 July; many sources show 27 July or 14 July as his birth date. He studied philosophy at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and was also a member of the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia. He spent 18 months in prison after participating in a 1962 miner&#x27;s strike.

He began writing poetry in 1967. He is one of the &quot;Novísimos&quot; from Jose María Castellet. His poetic works until 1986 are collected in &quot;Memoria y deseo&quot; (&quot;Memory and desire&quot;).

The same characteristic features of his poetry appear in his novels. &quot;Los mares del Sur&quot;, part of the Pepe Carvalho series, won the Planeta Award in 1979, bringing fame for both the writer and the fictional detective, who would later be portrayed in films, TV series and comic strips. In 1988, he wrote and published a children&#x27;s book called, &quot;Escenas de la Literatura Universal y Retratos de Grandes Autores&quot; (English version as &quot;Scenes from World Literature and Portraits of Greatest Authors&quot;), which is illustrated by Willi Glasauer, and published by Círculo de Lectores. This children&#x27;s book includes fun facts, trivia, and information accompanied by photos and Willi Glasauer&#x27;s illustrations of the likes of Ramón del Valle-Inclán, Gabriel García Márquez, Hermann Hesse, Agatha Christie, Federico García Lorca, William Shakespeare, Samuel Beckett, Günter Grass, Marguerite Duras, Miguel de Cervantes, Elias Canetti, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Albert Camus, Jonathan Swift, Virginia Woolf, Franz Kafka, Doris Lessing, Vladimir Nabokov, Jorge Luis Borges, James Joyce, Jean-Paul Sartre, Thomas Mann, William Faulkner, and Ernest Hemingway.

Other narrative works include narrative productions &quot;Galíndez&quot; (1991), winner of the National Narrative Award; &quot;El estrangulador&quot; (The strangler) (1994) and &quot;Erec y Enide&quot; (Erec and Enide) (2002). In 1992 he published &quot;Autobiografía del general Franco&quot;, which was awarded the 1994 international prize &quot;Premio Internacional de Literatura Ennio Flaiano&quot;. He also wrote non-literary works in Catalan, notably &quot;L&#x27;art del menjar a Catalunya&quot; (1977).
For many years, he contributed columns and articles to the Madrid-based daily newspaper &quot;El País&quot;.

In 1974, he wrote the libretto for Salvador Dalí&#x27;s opera-poem &quot;Être Dieu (To Be God)&quot;, with music by French avant-garde composer Igor Wakhévitch.

He died in Bangkok, Thailand, while returning to his home country from a speaking tour of Australia. His last book, &quot;La aznaridad&quot;, was published posthumously.

== The gastronome ==
Vázquez Montalbán was also a gastronome. Gastronomical references can be found in all the novels of the Pepe Carvalho series, which include some recipes such as the &quot;rice tagliatelle fideuà&quot; that Carvalho prepares in &quot;Los pájaros de Bangkok&quot;. He displays all his gastronomic knowledge, with erudition and humility, in &quot;Contra los Gourmets&quot; (Against Gourmets), an initiation in the world of gastronomy. &quot;Contra los Gourmets&quot; concentrates on Spanish cuisine, but covers international cuisine, traditional cuisine and nouvelle cuisine. He also considers eating fashions such as &quot;healthy food&quot; and &quot;light products&quot;. Other gastronomic works by Montalbán are &quot;L&#x27;art del menjar a Catalunya&quot; (Cocina Catalana), &quot;Recetas inmorales&quot; (Immoral recipes) and &quot;Reflexiones de Robinsón ante un bacalao&quot;.

== Essays ==
He wrote essays about journalism, politics, sociology, sports, history, cuisine, biographies, literature and music.His first essay, &quot;Informe sobre la Información&quot; (Report about Information) (1963) is still one of the best studies on journalism ever published in Spain. Some of his other works are:
*&quot;Crónica sentimental de España&quot; (Sentimental Chronicle of Spain), 1971
*&quot;Joan Manuel Serrat&quot;, 1972
*&quot;El libro gris de Televisión Española&quot; (The Grey TV Book), 1973
*&quot;Diccionario del Franquismo&quot;, (Dictionary of the Franco times) 1977
*&quot;Panfleto desde el planeta de los simios&quot; (Pamphlet from the Planet of the Apes), 1995

*&quot;Y Dios entró en La Habana&quot; (And God entered La Habana), 1998, about Cuba, Fidel Castro and the visit of the Pope John Paul II.
*&quot;Marcos: el señor de los espejos&quot; (Marcos: the Lord of the Mirrors), 1999.

<doc id="344258" wikidata="Q327888" url="?curid=344258" title="Edgar Bronfman Sr.">
<text>Edgar Miles Bronfman (June 20, 1929 – December 21, 2013) was a Canadian-American businessman. He worked for his family&#x27;s distilled beverage firm, Seagram, eventually becoming president, treasurer and CEO. As president of the World Jewish Congress, Bronfman is especially remembered for initiating diplomacy with the Soviet Union, which resulted in legitimizing the Hebrew language in the USSR, and contributed to Soviet Jews being legally able to practice their religion, as well as immigrate to Israel.

==Biography==
Bronfman was born into the Jewish-Canadian Bronfman family in Montreal, the son of Samuel Bronfman, a Russian who had immigrated to Canada with his parents, and Saidye Rosner Bronfman, a native of Manitoba born to Eastern European immigrants. They raised their four children in Montreal.

In 1925, Sam and his brother, Allan, built the family&#x27;s first liquor distillery near Montreal. They later bought a distillery owned by the Seagram family and incorporated the name. The U.S. subsidiary of the Seagram Company Ltd. opened in 1933; Edgar Bronfman would later take charge of the subsidiary.

Bronfman had two older sisters: architect Phyllis Lambert, and Minda de Gunzburg, who married Baron Alain de Gunzburg (1925–2004), a great grandson of Joseph Günzburg. Bronfman also had a younger brother, Charles Bronfman. The Bronfmans &quot;kept a kosher home, and the children received religious schooling on weekends. During the week, Edgar and Charles were among a handful of Jews sent to private Anglophone schools, where they attended chapel and ate pork.&quot;

Bronfman attended Selwyn House School in Montreal, and Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario, Canada. He next attended Williams College, then transferred to McGill University, where he graduated in 1951 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in commerce.

==Career==
===Seagram===

After graduating from McGill University with a B.A. degree, in 1951, he joined the family business, where he worked as an accounting clerk and apprentice taster. In 1953, he took over as head of the Seagram U.S. subsidiary, Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons. He increased the range of products sold by the company, improved distribution, and expanded the number of countries in which Seagram&#x27;s products were sold. In 1966, Cemp Investments, which managed the family&#x27;s investments, bought 820,000 shares of MGM and, in 1969, Bronfman took over the chairmanship of MGM, albeit briefly.

Following his father&#x27;s death, in 1971, Bronfman took over as president, treasurer and director of Distillers Corporation-Seagram Ltd. His son, Edgar Jr., succeeded him as chief executive officer of the company in 1994.

=== World Jewish Congress ===
When former World Jewish Congress president Philip Klutznick stepped down in 1979, Bronfman was asked to take over as acting head of the organization, then was formally elected president by the Seventh Plenary Assembly, in January 1981. Together with his deputy, Israel Singer, Bronfman led the World Jewish Congress. Initiatives such as those seeking to help free Soviet Jewry; to expose Austrian president Kurt Waldheim&#x27;s Nazi past; and to help victims of the Holocaust and their heirs to acquire compensation (including by Swiss banks) raised Bronfman&#x27;s international profile during the 1980s and 1990s.

==== Initiatives ====
===== Soviet Jewry =====
In 1983, Bronfman suggested that &quot;American Jews should abandon their strongest weapon, the Jackson–Vanik amendment, as a sign of goodwill that challenges the Soviets to respond in kind.&quot;

After Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s ascension in 1985, Bronfman&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; message began to resonate with the public. In early 1985, Bronfman secured an invitation to the Kremlin and on September 8–11, visited Moscow, becoming the first World Jewish Congress President to be formally received in Moscow by Soviet Officials. Carrying a note from Shimon Peres, Bronfman met with Gorbachev, and initiated talks of a Soviet Jewish airlift. It is said that Peres&#x27; note called on the Soviet Union to resume diplomatic relations with Israel.

In a &quot;Washington Post&quot; profile a few months after the September trip, Bronfman laid out what he thought had been accomplished during his September meetings. He said, &quot;There&#x27;s going to be a buildup of pressure through the business community. The Russians know the Soviet Jewry issue is tied to trade ... My guess is that over a period of time, five to ten years, some of our goals will be achieved.&quot; Author Gal Beckerman says in his &quot;When They Come For Us We&#x27;ll Be Gone&quot;, &quot;Bronfman had a business man&#x27;s understanding of the Soviet Jewish issue. It was all a matter of negotiation, of calculating what the Russians really wanted and leveraging that against emigration.&quot;

In March 1987, Bronfman, along with fellow delegates of the World Jewish Congress, flew to Moscow once again. Bronfman held three days of discussions with senior Soviet officials. Together, Bronfman and the World Jewish Congress delegates advocated for the freeing of the Jews living under Soviet rule.

On June 25, 1982, Bronfman became the first representative of a Jewish organization to speak before the United Nations. Speaking before the Special Session on Disarmament, Bronfman said, &quot;world peace cannot tolerate the denial of the legitimacy of Israel or any other nation-state ... [and the] charge that Zionism is racism is an abomination.&quot;

Bronfman&#x27;s goals for the visit were threefold. In his book, &quot;The Making of a Jew,&quot; he explained: first, he called for the release of all so-called Prisoners of Zion, the Jews imprisoned for expressing a desire to emigrate to Israel. Bronfman also wanted freedom for Jews in the Soviet Union to practice their religion. Finally, he called for the freedom for Soviet Jews to learn Hebrew, which was forbidden at the time.

A year later, in 1988, Bronfman returned to Moscow to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. This trip resulted in the Soviets promising to legalize the teaching of Hebrew in the Soviet Union and to establish a Jewish cultural center in Moscow. Bronfman said of this visit, &quot;By their actions, they are indicating that they are eager to get the question of Jewish rights and emigration off the bargaining table. And it is actions, rather than simply words, that count.&quot;
===== Kurt Waldheim =====
In 1986, during Bronfman&#x27;s presidency, the World Jewish Congress accused Austrian president Kurt Waldheim of covering up his past connections to the Nazi Party. It was when Waldheim became a candidate for president of Austria that the World Jewish Congress first published material showing Waldheim&#x27;s active duty in the German army during wartime. This evidence was later used to prove that Waldheim must have known about the deportation of Jews to concentration camps, though Waldheim&#x27;s service as an Austrian in the German army cannot itself be considered a war crime. Waldheim had served as an intelligence officer in a unit of the army that participated in the transfer of Greek Jews to death camps. The allegations against Waldheim resulted in public embarrassment for the then-Austrian president.

On May 5, 1987, Bronfman spoke to the World Jewish Congress saying Waldheim was &quot;part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine&quot;. Waldheim subsequently filed a lawsuit against Bronfman, but dropped the suit shortly after, due to a lack of evidence in his favor.

According to Joel Bainerman, in 1991 he was appointed to the International Jewish Committee for Inter-religious Consultations to conduct official contacts between the Vatican and the State of Israel.
===== Swiss bank restitution =====
In the late 1990s, Bronfman championed the cause of restitution from Switzerland for Holocaust survivors. Bronfman began an initiative that led to a $1.25 billion settlement from Swiss banks. This settlement aimed to resolve claims &quot;that they hoarded bank accounts opened by Jews who were murdered by the Nazis&quot;. The Swiss banks, the United States Government, and Jewish groups investigated unclaimed assets deposited by European Jews into Swiss banks before the Holocaust. Negotiations began in 1995 between the U.S. and Switzerland. The parties reached a settlement in August 1998, and signed the $1.25 billion settlement in January 1999. In exchange for the settlement money, both parties agreed to release the Swiss banks and government from any claims regarding the Holocaust. The settlement was officially approved on November 22, 2000, by Judge Edward R. Korman.

===== Israel =====
Bronfman was accused by another WJC official of &quot;perfidy&quot; when he wrote a letter to President Bush in mid-2003 urging Bush to pressure Israel to curb construction of its controversial West Bank separation barrier, co-signed by former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger. Former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres said in support of Bronfman, &quot;Clearly, issues that are open for debate in Israel should be open for debate in the Jewish world.&quot;

==== Resignation ====
Bronfman stepped down from his post as president on May 7, 2007, amid scandals and turmoil about Israel Singer. Bronfman&#x27;s leadership is known for transforming the World Jewish Congress into the powerful organization it is today. As president, Bronfman is remembered most for his diplomacy with the Soviet Union in freeing Soviet Jews.

At his memorial held in January 2014, Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said of Bronfman, &quot;Edgar was never shy of pressing an issue in the face of injustice,&quot; as she spoke about the many causes he championed in his lifetime.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and children===
Bronfman was married five times (twice to his third wife).

* Ann Margaret Loeb (1932–2011). In 1953, he married Loeb, a Jewish-American banking heiress. Loeb was the daughter of John Langeloth Loeb Sr. and Frances Lehman. They divorced in 1973. They had five children:
** Samuel Bronfman II – On August 9, 1975, Samuel was abducted in New York. The abductors were acquitted of kidnapping by claiming Bronfman II was a co-conspirator, but convicted of extortion charges and spent several years in prison. The ransom money was recovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Record/Herald-AnnLeobBronfman-obit&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The defense attorney wrote a memoir before his death in 2020, confessing that the defense was a lie, and Bronfman II had been an innocent victim. Samuel was married to Melanie Mann.
** Edgar Bronfman Jr.
** Matthew Bronfman
** Bhavani Lev née Holly Bronfman – His only daughter with Loeb moved to India and, in 1997, co-founded, with her husband, Israeli-citizen Yoav Lev, Organic India, an organic food and supplements company based in Lucknow, India. Fabindia purchased a 40% stake in Organic India in 2013. She is a convert to Hinduism and has taken the name Bhavani Lev.
** Adam Bronfman, managing director of The Samuel Bronfman Foundation.
* Lady Carolyn Townshend. In 1973, soon after his divorce from Loeb, he married Townshend, the daughter of the 7th Marquess Townshend. The couple separated after 10 days and their marriage was annulled in 1974.
* Rita Eileen Webb, later Georgiana &quot;George&quot; Bronfman. In 1975, he married Webb, then 25, who converted to Judaism and is the daughter of Barry and Eileen Webb, proprietors of an Essex country pub, &quot;Ye Old Nosebag&quot;. Webb and Bronfman divorced in 1983 and were later remarried, but again divorced. (&quot;After the second divorce, she began a brief but tempestuous affair with Lorenzo Ricciardi [spouse of Mirella Ricciardi], an Italian filmmaker in his 60s. He was arrested in 1990 for trying to kill her.&quot; In 2007, Webb married English actor Nigel Havers.) Bronfman and Webb had two children together:
** Sara Bronfman (born 1976) – She is married to Libyan businessman Basit Igtet; they have one daughter. She was sued in a 2018 regarding her NXIVM activities.
** Clare Bronfman (born 1979), who was indicted in the 2018 NXIVM cult scandal.
* Jan Aronson. In 1994, he married the artist Jan Aronson.

===NXIVM===
In 2003, a &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine article reported that Bronfman took a course from NXIVM under the leadership of Keith Raniere, endorsing it, but had since &quot;grown troubled&quot; due to the &quot;emotional and financial investment&quot; daughters Clare and Sara were giving to Raniere&#x27;s group, remarking that Clare had loaned NXIVM $2 million, though she denied this. Bronfman was quoted stating, &quot;I think it&#x27;s a cult.&quot; In 2018, Raniere, then daughter Clare and her long-time mentor NXIVM president Nancy Salzman, among others, were arrested on federal charges in connection with NXIVM. In September 2018, daughter Sara was named the defendant in a 2018 class-action suit regarding her NXIVM activities.

==Death==
Bronfman died on December 21, 2013, at his home in Manhattan. He was 84. Bronfman was survived by his widow, Aronson, seven children, 24 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren at the time of his death.

==Philanthropy==

Bronfman was a philanthropist who gave large amounts of money to Jewish causes, including , which he was credited with helping revive together with Hillel president Richard Joel in the 1990s. The Hillel at New York University is called The Edgar M. Bronfman Center for Jewish Student Life, known by students just as &quot;Bronfman&quot;. Bronfman established the Bronfman Youth Fellowships in Israel, a leadership program for Jewish youth, and provided the funding for MyJewishLearning.com, a digital media entity that includes Kveller, a popular Jewish parenting site.

His mother has a concert hall named after her in Montreal, the Saidye Bronfman Centre, and a building at McGill University is named after his father.

Bronfman was also the founder and president of The Samuel Bronfman Foundation, whose work is informed by these four principles: &quot;Jewish renaissance is grounded in Jewish learning, Jewish youth shape the future of the Jewish people, vibrant Jewish communities are open and inclusive, and that all Jews are a single family.&quot;

Major points of focus for The Samuel Bronfman Foundation are pluralism, intermarriage, community engagement – especially youth – and making Jewish knowledge accessible to Jews of all backgrounds. It is known for its work with the following grantees:

* In 1987, Bronfman founded The Bronfman Youth Fellowships in Israel, a network of 1,000 young Jews from Israel and North America that includes some of today&#x27;s most inspiring Jewish writers, thinkers and leaders. The Bronfman Youth Fellowships tap future influencers at a formative point in their lives, their final year of high school, and immerses them in an intensive exploration of Jewish text study, pluralism and social responsibility. Previous directors of the Fellowship include Rabbi Michael Paley, Rabbi Avi Weinstein, Rabbi Mishael Zion and currently, Becky Voorwinde. Past faculty members include Rabbi Sharon Cohen Anisfeld, Rabbi Andy Bachman and Rabbi Jehuda Sarna. The Fellowship has been called &quot;a new kind of yeshiva and a modern house of study.&quot;
* , which is the largest Jewish campus organization in the world, engaging Jewish students globally in religious, cultural, artistic, and community-service activities. Hillel&#x27;s mission is &quot;to enrich the lives of Jewish undergraduate and graduate students so that they may enrich the Jewish people and the world&quot;.
* MyJewishLearning.com, which is the leading transdenominational website of Jewish information and education, offering articles and resources on all aspects of Judaism and Jewish life, along with Kveller, a Jewish parenting website that is a project of MyJewishLearning.com.

In April 2012, Bronfman joined the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Giving Pledge, a long-term charitable initiative that aims to inspire conversations about philanthropy and increase charitable giving in the United States. Bronfman and 12 others joined the 68 billionaires who had already signed the giving pledge.

Following his death in 2013, Jewish news outlets called Bronfman a &quot;prince of his people,&quot; for his unique combination of lineage, intrigue, and devotion to the Jewish people through learning and philanthropy. Through his Jewish philanthropy, Bronfman became known for his unique approach to Jewish life. A proud Jew who publicly stated his disbelief in God, Bronfman developed his own understanding of Judaism, as he learned Jewish texts and traditions both in his personal life and in his work at The Samuel Bronfman Foundation. In an article, journalist Ami Eden writes about Bronfman, who chose to incorporate meaningful Jewish traditions into his life, all the while continuing to educate himself about the religion until his final days.
Bronfman also promoted the idea that Jewish organizations needed to stop using fear as a selling point, but rather encourage ordinary Jews to take a deeper interest in the substantive heritage they have been born into. Specifically, while much of the American Jewish community saw intermarriage as an epidemic to be curbed, Bronfman considered the trend an opportunity for Jews to learn further with their non-Jewish partners.

==Awards==

In 1986 Bronfman was honored with the Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur (Legion of Honour), from the Government of France. He was honored with the Star of People&#x27;s Friendship by East German leader Erich Honecker in 1988. Bronfman was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by U.S. president Bill Clinton in 1999.

In 2000, he received the Leo Baeck Medal for his humanitarian work promoting tolerance and social justice. In 2005 he received the Hillel Renaissance Award from Hillel International.

<text>Charles Bronfman, (born June 27, 1931) is a Canadian-American businessman and philanthropist and is a member of the Canadian Jewish Bronfman family. With an estimated net worth of $2.5 billion in 2023, Bronfman was ranked by &quot;Forbes&quot; as the 1,217th wealthiest person in the world.

== Biography ==
Bronfman was born into a Jewish family in Montreal. He is the son of Samuel Bronfman and Saidye Rosner Bronfman. He has two older sisters, the art patron Baroness Aileen &quot;Minda&quot; Bronfman de Gunzberg, and architecture expert and developer Phyllis Lambert. His older brother, Edgar Bronfman, Sr., was his fellow co-chair of Seagram. Edgar Bronfman Jr. is Edgar&#x27;s son. He was educated at Selwyn House School in Montreal, Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario, and McGill University. Bronfman said he is Canadian in his heart but sought his dual citizenship in order to vote in the United States.

== Business career ==
Bronfman held various positions in the family&#x27;s liquor empire, Seagram, from 1951 to 2000. In 1951 Bronfman&#x27;s father Samuel Bronfman gave Charles a 33% ownership stake in Cemp Investments, a holding company for him and his 3 siblings which controlled the family&#x27;s corporate empire. Under the leadership of Charles and brother Edgar, it controlled billions of dollars in liquor, real estate, oil and gas, and chemical companies.

Bronfman and his brother, Edgar, inherited the Seagram spirits empire in 1971 after the death of their father, Sam Bronfman. Bronfman is a former co-chairman of the Seagram Company Ltd. On the 2000 demise of the company: &quot;It was a disaster, it is a disaster, it will be a disaster,&quot; he says. &quot;It was a family tragedy.&quot;

Bronfman was also well known for his forays into professional sports. He was majority owner of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Montreal Expos from the team&#x27;s formation in 1968 until 1991. He sold the franchise for $100 million CAD to a consortium of local investors led by Claude Brochu on November 29, 1990. The sale was completed months later on June 14, 1991. In 1982, a day after the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League collapsed due to financial troubles, Bronfman bought their remains and used them to start a new franchise, the Montreal Concordes. This venture proved far less successful – despite later rebranding the team as the Alouettes, the team folded prior to the start of the 1987 CFL season.

Since 1986, he has served as chairman of The Andrea and Charles Bronfman Philanthropies, Inc. He planned to close the foundation in 2016.

From November 1997 until July 2002, Bronfman was the chairman of the board of Koor Industries Ltd., one of Israel&#x27;s largest investment holding companies. He is the co-chairman of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada. From 1999 to 2001, Bronfman was the first chairman of the United Jewish Communities, the merged North American organization comprising United Jewish Appeal, the Council of Jewish Federations and United Israel Appeal.

In April 2013, Bronfman was one of 100 prominent American Jews who sent a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urging him to &quot;work closely&quot; with Secretary of State John Kerry &quot;to devise pragmatic initiatives, consistent with Israel&#x27;s security needs, which would represent Israel&#x27;s readiness to make painful territorial sacrifices for the sake of peace.&quot;

== Philanthropy ==
He and Michael Steinhardt co-founded Taglit Birthright, a program which provides a free, educational travel experience to Israel for young Jewish adults. Bronfman is one of its principal donors. Since 1999, the program has sent more than 700,000 young Jews from around the world on a 10-day free trip to Israel.

In 1991, Bronfman with billionaire Leslie Wexner formed the &quot;Mega Group&quot;, a loosely organized club of some the wealthiest and most influential businessmen who were concerned with Jewish issues. Max Fisher, Michael Steinhardt, Leonard Abramson, Edgar Bronfman Sr., and Laurence Tisch were some of the members. The &quot;Mega Group&quot; would meet twice a year for two days of seminars related to the topic of philanthropy and Jewishness. In 1998, Steven Spielberg spoke about his personal religious journey, and later the group discussed Jewish summer camps. The &quot;Mega Group&quot;, went on to inspire a number of philanthropic initiatives such as the Partnership for Excellence in Jewish Education, Birthright Israel, and the upgrading of national Hillel.

He was linked to scandal in 1999, when it was revealed that funds he had donated to social causes were transferred to Ehud Barak&#x27;s election campaign for Prime Minister of Israel, to which he had previously contributed, among others. Bronfman was the largest donor to contribute to the renovation of the Tel Aviv Performing Arts Center and has also contributed to the Israel Museum. The Fredric R. Mann Auditorium was refurbished by Bronfman&#x27;s donation, and reopened as the Charles Bronfman Auditorium, in May 2013.

Bronfman is chairman of the Andrea and Charles Bronfman Philanthropies Inc., a family of charitable foundations operating in Israel, the U.S., and Canada. Since its foundation in 1986, the charity spent more than $340 million to about 1,820 organizations. In 2016 Bonfman closed the charity, which was planned over years. Bronfman is also responsible for The Charles Bronfman Prize, honoring individuals for their humanitarian contributions. The first winner was Gift of Life Marrow Registry founder Jay Feinberg. He also founded the CRB Foundation, which runs educational enrichment classes in outlying areas in collaboration with the Education Ministry in Israel.

Bronfman was a founding co-chairman of Historica Canada, producers of the &quot;Heritage Minutes&quot; series of television shorts. It was at an early meeting of this foundation (originally the CAB Foundation) that he asked the members, &quot;If television can use 30 seconds or 60 seconds to persuade people that Cadillacs or cornflakes are interesting, couldn&#x27;t we also use that short piece of time to persuade Canadians that their history is interesting? You tell me how to do it, and I&#x27;ll fund it.&quot; It was out of that discussion that the &quot;Heritage Minutes&quot; were conceived, piloted, distributed through cinemas and broadcasters across the country, and then confirmed as a major contribution of the foundation – which a few years later became Historica, recently merged with the Dominion Institute.

Bronfman joined the Giving Pledge, an initiative of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2022, he donated $5 million to McGill Institute for the Study of Canada (MISC), which he co-founded in 1994, for Conversations about Canada, launching with &quot;Comparing Immigration Policies: Canada &amp; the World&quot; in 2023.

Bronfman was one of the first signees of the Jewish Future Pledge, a charitable campaign launched in 2020 modeled after The Giving Pledge to encourage American Jews to designate at least 50% of their charitable giving to Jewish- or Israel-related causes.

<text>The Robber Bride is a novel by Canadian writer Margaret Atwood, first published by McClelland and Stewart in 1993.

== Plot summary ==
Set in present-day Toronto, Ontario, the novel is about three women and their history with old friend and nemesis, Zenia. Roz, Charis, and Tony meet once a month in a restaurant to share a meal years after Zenia betrayed them and interfered with their romantic relationships. During one outing they spot Zenia, who they thought to be long-dead. The plot then travels back in time to explain how Zenia stole, one by one, their respective partners. The novel alternates between the present and the past through flashbacks, in the third person perspective of Tony, Charis and Roz. Zenia gives each woman a different version of her biography, tailor-made to insinuate herself into their lives. No one version of Zenia is the truth, and the reader knows no more than the characters.

Their betrayals by Zenia are what initially bring the three together as friends and bind their lives together irrevocably - their monthly luncheons begin after her funeral. 

In the present-day, Roz, Charis and Tony each individually confront Zenia in a Toronto hotel room, where she tells each of them that the men they&#x27;d been with got what they deserved.

==Themes==
The novel, like many other works by Atwood, deals with power struggles between men and women, while also being a meditation on the nature of female friendship, power and trust. Zenia&#x27;s character can be read as either the ultimate self-empowered woman - a traitor who abuses sisterhood - or a self-interested mercenary who cunningly uses the &quot;war between the sexes&quot; to further her own interests. One interpretation posits Zenia as a kind of guardian angel to the women, saving them from unworthy men. This proposition comes as the conclusion of Atwood&#x27;s later short story, &quot;I Dream of Zenia with the Bright Red Teeth&quot;, which features the same characters.

Canadian literary critic Brian Busby wrote in his book &quot;Character Parts: Who&#x27;s Really Who in Canlit&quot; that the character of Zenia was based on journalist Barbara Amiel.

==Awards==
The novel was co-winner, with Jane Urquhart&#x27;s &quot;Away&quot;, of the 1993 Trillium Book Award, and was shortlisted for the Governor General&#x27;s Award for English-language fiction at the 1994 Governor General&#x27;s Awards.

== Film adaptation ==
A film adaptation of &quot;The Robber Bride&quot;, starring Mary-Louise Parker as Zenia, Wendy Crewson as Roz, Greg Bryk as Henry, Shawn Doyle as John, Susan Lynch as Charis, Amanda Root as Tony, Tatiana Maslany as Augusta and Brandon Firla as West, aired on CBC Television in January 2007 and the Oxygen Network in March 2007.

The adaptation altered the plotline, choosing not to show Roz, Tony and Charis&#x27; childhood flashbacks and adding several new characters. In addition, Augusta is taken by Zenia and the Toxique has been changed to Absinthe.

==Sequel==
In 2014, Atwood published the short story &quot;I Dream of Zenia with the Bright Red Teeth&quot;, which revisits Roz, Tony and Charis in the present day, when Charis believes that her new pet dog Ouida is possessed by the spirit of Zenia. Originally published by the Canadian magazine &quot;The Walrus&quot;, the story also appears in her 2014 short story collection &quot;Stone Mattress&quot;.

<doc id="344269" wikidata="Q207850" url="?curid=344269" title="Erogenous zone">
<text>An erogenous zone (from Greek , &quot;érōs&quot; &quot;love&quot;; and English &quot;-genous&quot; &quot;producing&quot;, from Greek , &quot;-genḗs&quot; &quot;born&quot;) is an area of the human body that has heightened sensitivity, the stimulation of which may generate a sexual response such as relaxation, sexual fantasies, sexual arousal, and orgasm.

Erogenous zones are located all over the human body, but the sensitivity of each varies, and depends on concentrations of nerve endings that can provide pleasurable sensations when stimulated. The touching of another person&#x27;s erogenous zone is regarded as an act of physical intimacy. Whether a person finds stimulation in these areas to be pleasurable or objectionable depends on a range of factors, including their level of arousal, the circumstances in which it takes place, the cultural context, the nature of the relationship between the partners, and the partners&#x27; personal histories.

Erogenous zones may be classified by the type of sexual response that they generate. Many people are gently aroused when their eyelids, eyebrows, temples, shoulders, hands, arms, and hair are subtly touched. Gently touching or stroking of these zones stimulates a partner during foreplay and increases the arousal level. Also, the gentle massage or stroke of the abdominal area along with kissing or simply touching the navel can be a type of stimulation.

== Classification ==
=== Specific zones ===
Specific zones are associated with sexual response, and include the lips and nipples in addition to areas of the genitals, notably corona of the glans penis, clitoris and perianal skin. These zones have a high density of innervation, and may have an efficiency of wound healing and a capacity to stimulate generalized cerebral arousal.

=== Nonspecific zones ===
In these zones, the skin is similar to normal-haired skin and has the normal high density of nerves and hair follicles. These areas include the sides and back of the neck, the inner arms, the axillae (armpits) and sides of the thorax (chest).

== Genital areas ==

=== Male ===
For males, erogenous zones consist of the glans and the penis itself, along with the scrotum, the perineum, and the anus.

Males may also experience sexual stimulation via the prostate, either from anal sex or massage.

=== Female ===
For females, parts of the vulva, especially the clitoris, as well as the perineum and anus, are erogenous zones.

While the vagina is not especially sensitive as a whole, its lower third (the area close to the entrance) has concentrations of the nerve endings that can provide pleasurable sensations during sexual activity when stimulated; this is also called the anterior wall of the vagina or the outer one-third of the vagina, and it contains the majority of the vaginal nerve endings, making it more sensitive to touch than the inner two-thirds of the vaginal barrel. 

Within the anterior wall of the vagina, there is a patch of ribbed rough tissue which has a texture that is sometimes described as similar to the palate (the roof of a mouth) or a raspberry, and may feel spongy when a woman is sexually aroused. This is the urethral sponge, which may also be the location of an area that some women report is an erogenous zone; this is sometimes called the &quot;G-spot&quot;. When stimulated, it may lead to sexual arousal, an orgasm, or female ejaculation. The existence of the G-spot and whether or not it is a distinct structure is debated among researchers, as reports of its location vary from woman to woman, it appears to be nonexistent in some women, and scientists commonly believe that it is an extension of the clitoris.

==Head==

===Mouth===
The lips and tongue are sensitive and can be stimulated by kissing and licking. Biting at the lip can also provide stimulus.

===Neck===
The neck, clavicle area and the back of the neck are very sensitive, and can be stimulated by licking, kissing or light caressing. Some people also like being bitten gently in these areas, often to the point that a &quot;hickey&quot;, or &quot;love-bite&quot; is formed.

===Ears===
Some people find whispering or breathing softly in the ear to be pleasurable and relaxing, as well as licking, biting, caressing and/or kissing it especially the area of and behind the earlobe.

== Torso ==

=== Chest ===
The areola and nipple contain Golgi-Mazzoni, Vater-Pacini, and genital corpuscles. No Meissner&#x27;s corpuscles and few organized nerve endings are present. There are concentrations of nerve tissue in the area of ducts and masses of smooth muscle. The hair surrounding the areola adds additional sensory tissue. The mass of smooth muscle and glandular-duct tissue in the nipple and areola block the development of normal dermal nerve networks which are present in other erogenous regions and the development of special end organs. The entire breast has a network of nerve endings, and it has the same number of nerve endings no matter how large the breast is, so that larger breasts may need more stimulation than smaller ones.

Intense nipple stimulation may result in a surge in the production of oxytocin and prolactin which could have a significant effect on the individual&#x27;s genitals, even to the point that some people of both sexes can achieve orgasm through nipple stimulation alone. Having the chest, breasts and nipples stimulated manually (hands, fingers) or orally (mouth, lips, teeth, tongue) is a pleasurable experience for many people of both sexes.

===Abdomen and navel===

Many people find stimulation (kissing, biting, scratching, tickling, caressing) of the abdomen to be pleasurable, especially close to the pubic region. It can cause strong arousal in men and women, in some even stronger than stimulation of the genitals. The navel is one of the many erogenous zones that has heightened sensitivity. In a 1982 study of eroticism in dress entitled &quot;Skin to Skin&quot;, Prudence Glynn claimed that the waist symbolized virginity and that it was the first place that a man would touch a woman &quot;when indicating more than a formal courtesy&quot;.

The navel and the region below when touched by the finger or the tip of the tongue result in the production of erotic sensations.

== Arms ==
The skin of the arms, and specifically the softer skin of the inner arms and across the creased mid-arm bend covering the ventral side of the elbow, are highly sensitive to manual or oral stimulation. Caressing with fingers or tongue, more vigorous kneading, and butterfly kissing can initiate arousal and, in some cases, induce clitoral/vaginal orgasm or penile ejaculation without direct contact with the latter areas. The mid-arm bend is especially sensitive due to the thinner skin found there, which makes nerve endings more accessible. Arm sensitivity may be reduced or concentrated to a more narrow range by excessive muscularity or obesity on the one hand, or transformed to uncomfortable tenderness by excessive thinness on the other.

==Armpits==
Some consider the armpits to be an erogenous zone, despite the similarity of the axillae (armpits) to normal-haired skin in both the density of nerves and hair follicles. Exaggerated or anticipated digital (fingers, toes) or oral (mouth, lips, tongue) stimulation is believed to be responsible for the heightened sensual response.
If pheromones exist for humans, they would likely be secreted by a mixture of liquid from the apocrine glands with other organic compounds in the body. George Preti, an organic chemist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia and Winnefred Cutler of the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s psychology department, discovered that women with irregular menstrual cycles became regular when exposed to male underarm extracts. They hypothesized that the only explanation was that underarms contain pheromones, as there was no other explanation for the effects, which mirrored how pheromones affect other mammals.

==Fingers==
The fingertips have many nerves and are responsive to very light touches, like the brushing of a tongue, light fingernail scratching or teeth stroking. The sides of the fingers are somewhat less sensitive and more ticklish. Both light and firmer touches work well at the junction of the fingers. Human fingertips are the second-most sensitive parts of the body, after the tongue.

== Legs ==
The thighs can be sensitive to touch.

An exaggerated tickle on the back of the legs and knees can also be sensitive for some.

==Feet and toes==
Because of the concentration of nerve endings in the sole and digits of the human foot—and possibly due to the close proximity between the area of the brain dealing with tactile sensations from the feet and the area dealing with sensations from the genitals—the sensations produced by both the licking of the feet and sucking of toes can be pleasurable to some people. Similarly, massaging the sole of the foot can also produce stimulation. Many people are extremely ticklish in the foot area, especially on the soles.

<text>Jouko Veli Turkka (17 April 1942 – 22 July 2016) was a Finnish theatrical director and controversialist. He was assistant director of the Helsinki City Theatre from 1975 to 1982, and a professor at the Helsinki Theatre Academy from 1981 to 1988, being its rector from 1982 to 1985. Turkka influenced a whole generation of Finnish actors, and created a recognisable style of acting.

Turkka died after a long illness on 22 July 2016, aged 74.

== Technique ==
The method was to progressively search for a mental borderline state by way of psychological and physical exertion, and the result was frequently an acting performance characterised by actors shaking uncontrollably and spewing spit and snot and other bodily fluids around them. Some likened the method to brainwashing, or to those of religious cults.

In 1987 the government had cause to remove him from his post as rector of the Helsinki School of Drama, when a group of his students held a performance at a theater symposium held in the city of Oulu. The organizers had specifically requested that the group should present something &quot;shocking&quot; so that there would be a bit of fuel for late night discussions at the bar. However the young students overshot expectations by staging a performance art piece in which they cut themselves to bleed, smeared each other with excrement, and crucified and whipped one of their number. The group, called &quot;Jumalan teatteri&quot; (The Theatre of God) in a direct reference to Antonin Artaud, also hurled excrement at the audience, resulting in well-publicised laundry bills and court cases for the recompense for same.

When the Finnish Minister of Culture appointed Maija-Liisa Márton to follow him as headmaster, the whole student body occupied and barricaded the school building with desks and chairs, refusing to &quot;give it up&quot;.

Several actors have written books which describe their experiences with him, either as students or actors.

<doc id="344277" wikidata="Q32989" url="?curid=344277" title="Bec Abbey">
<text>Bec Abbey, formally the Abbey of Our Lady of Bec (), is a Benedictine monastic foundation in the Eure &quot;département&quot;, in the Bec valley midway between the cities of Rouen and Bernay. It is located in Le Bec Hellouin, Normandy, France, and was the most influential abbey of the 12th-century Anglo-Norman kingdom.

Like all abbeys, Bec maintained annals of the house but uniquely its first abbots also received individual biographies, brought together by the monk of Bec, Milo Crispin. Because of the abbey&#x27;s cross-Channel influence, these hagiographic lives sometimes disclose historical information of more than local importance.

==Name==
The name of the abbey derives from the bec, or stream, that runs nearby. The word derives from the Scandinavian root, &quot;bekkr&quot;.

==First foundation==
The abbey was founded in 1034 by Saint Herluin, whose life was written by Gilbert Crispin, Abbot of Westminster, formerly of Bec, and collated with three other lives by Milo Crispin. Abbey construction began in 1034 and continued through 1035. Further lands were added through 1040. Saint Herluin was a Norman knight who in about 1031 left the court of Gilbert, Count of Brionne, to devote himself to a life of religion: the &quot;commune&quot; of Le Bec Hellouin preserves his name. One hundred and thirty-six monks made their profession while Herluin was in charge.

With the arrival of Lanfranc of Pavia, Bec became a focus of 11th century intellectual life. Lanfranc, who was already famous for his lectures at Avranches, came to teach as prior and master of the monastic school, but left in 1062, to become abbot of St. Stephen&#x27;s Abbey, Caen, and later Archbishop of Canterbury. He was followed as abbot by Anselm, also later an Archbishop of Canterbury, as was the fifth abbot, Theobald of Bec. Many distinguished ecclesiastics, probably including the future Pope Alexander II and Saint Ivo of Chartres, were educated in the school at Bec.

The life of the founder (&quot;Vita Herluini&quot;) was written by Gilbert Crispin. Archbishop Lanfranc also wrote a &quot;Chronicon Beccense&quot; of the life of Herlui. Milo Crispin&#x27;s biography of the first four abbots was published at Paris in 1648.

The followers of William the Conqueror supported the abbey, enriching it with extensive properties in England. Bec also owned and managed St Neots Priory as well as a number of other British foundations, including Goldcliff Priory in Monmouthshire founded in 1113 by Robert de Chandos. The village of Tooting Bec, now a London suburb, is so named because the abbey owned the land.

Bec Abbey was the original burial place of the Empress Matilda, whose bones were later transferred to Rouen Cathedral, where they remain.

Bec Abbey was damaged during the Wars of Religion and left a ruin in the French Revolution but the 15th-century St. Nicholas Tower (&quot;&quot;) from the medieval monastery is still standing.

==Second foundation==
In 1948 the site was re-established as the &quot;Abbaye de Notre-Dame du Bec&quot; by Olivetan monks led by Dom Grammont, who effected some restorations. The abbey is known for its links with Anglicanism and has been visited by successive archbishops of Canterbury. The abbey library contains the John Graham Bishop deposit of 5,000 works concerning Anglicanism.

Today the Abbey is probably best known for the pottery the monks produce.

<text>Paul-Émile Borduas (November 1, 1905 – February 22, 1960) was a Québécois artist known for his abstract paintings. He was the leader of the avant-garde Automatiste movement and the chief author of the Refus Global manifesto of 1948. Borduas had a profound impact on the development of the arts and of thought, both in the province of Quebec and in Canada.

== Biography ==
Borduas was born on November the first, 1905, in Saint-Hilaire, Quebec (a small village 50 kilometres from Montréal). He was the fourth child of Magloire Borduas and Éva Perrault. As a child, he engaged in &quot;bricolage&quot; - his first known artistic activity. He received five years of formal elementary school education, (which ended at the age of twelve) and some private lessons from a village resident. In his teens, Borduas met church painter and decorator Ozias Leduc, and Leduc agreed to take the young artist as an apprentice. Leduc provided Borduas with basic artistic training, teaching him how to restore and decorate churches. Leduc arranged for Borduas&#x27; instruction at the École Technique, in 1919, in Sherbrooke, Quebec. In 1923, assisted by a scholarship Leduc had secured for him, he enrolled in the École des Beaux-Arts de Montréal, continuing to work for Leduc at the same time. He received prizes for his paintings at both of these institutions. Despite discord between Borduas and the school administration, he continued his studies at Leduc&#x27;s urgings.

Upon graduation in 1927 Borduas was hired by the Montreal Catholic School Commission as a high school art teacher. In January 1929 he began studies at the Ateliers d&#x27;Art Sacré in Paris, which he left to pursue church decoration work of Rambucourt, in the Meuse Valley, with Pierre Dubois in April. He returned to Saint-Hilaire in June 1930 (his funds being depleted), began teaching part-time, and in 1933 returned to teaching high school. In 1937 Borduas began teaching at l&#x27;École du Meuble. This was an important time in Borduas&#x27; life: “by meeting young men of his own generation with the same tastes and the same need for action, he finally discovered a stimulating intellectual and social environment.”
In 1938, he encountered John Lyman, a Montreal painter and critic, at the first exhibition of one of Borduas&#x27; paintings. Lyman encouraged Borduas&#x27; involvement with the Contemporary Arts Society, and in January 1938 he was elected vice-president of this group. In 1941, he resumed painting after several years of study and teaching, during which time he and a group of students met regularly to discuss recent trends in European art. His first abstract paintings date from this year, and in April 1942 he exhibited 45 gouaches inspired by the abstract surrealism of Joan Miró. He became increasingly involved with about a dozen of his students, and they became known collectively as the &quot;Automatistes&quot; for their attempts to paint with &quot;pure psychic automatism&quot; as per the writings of André Breton. In January 1946, the first group exhibit of Borduas and his students was held in New York City, followed in April by an exhibit in Montreal. This was the first exhibit by a group of abstract painters in Canada. A second Montreal exhibit followed in February–March 1947. A critic, responding to this exhibit, coined the name &quot;Automatists&quot; for the group, after Borduas&#x27; painting &quot;Automatisme 1.47&quot;.

Borduas wrote &quot;Refus Global&quot; (or &quot;Total Refusal&quot;, anglicized) in late 1947-early 1948. It was circulated in a folder that contained other Automatists&#x27; writings. This piece was originally intended to accompany an Automatist showing, but it was actually distributed alone. &quot;Refus Global&quot; served as an important manifesto that advocated the separation of church and state in Quebec, especially for the arts. In it Borduas &quot;denounces the forces of oppression that had made of Quebec a suffocating environment, hostile to both individual and collective creativity&quot;.

 We foresee a future in which man is freed from useless chains, 
 to realize a plenitude of individual gifts, in necessary 
 unpredictability, spontaneity and resplendent anarchy. Until 
 then, without surrender or rest, in community of feeling with 
 those who thirst for better life, without fear of set-backs, in
 encouragement or persecution, we shall pursue in joy our 
 overwhelming need for liberation.
Four hundred copies of the manifesto went on sale August 9, 1948. Borduas was dismissed from l&#x27;École du Meuble on September 2 as a direct result of his involvement in this social critique. Even those who had tired of the repressive Duplessis régime, and advocated great social changes in Quebec, were reluctant to back Borduas&#x27; thorough condemnation of the Catholic Church—such a central influence on the French Canadian populace.

Borduas was ostracized and found himself unable to find a job, which was especially difficult as he was by now a father. He decided to take matters into his own hands. Borduas produced another piece in his defence, &quot;Projections Libérantes&quot; (&quot;Liberating Projections&quot;), which he completed in February 1949. Unfortunately, this more moderate composition, which clearly communicated Borduas&#x27; intentions in releasing &quot;Refus Global&quot;, was not enthusiastically received by the public or the presses. However, despite early denouncements, the manifesto marked the beginning of profound social change in Quebec and signalled the dawn of the Quiet Revolution. 
In 1953 Borduas moved to New York, where he saw the works of Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline and Mark Rothko and began to use the palette knife to apply his paint. In 1955 he moved back to Paris where he died of a heart attack in 1960.

In 1954, works by Borduas, along with those of B. C. Binning and Jean-Paul Riopelle, represented Canada at the Venice Biennale. In 1955 he represented Canada at the 3rd Bienal de São Paulo. In 1960 the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam gave him the posthumous exhibition, «Borduas 1905–1960» . In 1988 the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts gave him an enormous retrospective exhibition curated by François-Marc Gagnon.

In May 2012 his painting &quot;Froissement Multicolore&quot; sold for $663,750 at auction, surpassing the artist&#x27;s previous auction price record by $150,000.
In May 2018, Borduas&#x27; magnificent 1956 canvas &quot;Figures schématiques&quot; shattered the previous record for the artist&#x27;s work at auction and sold for $3,601,250 at the Heffel Fine Art Auction House spring live auction.
