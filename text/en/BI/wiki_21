<text>BlackBerry Limited (formerly Research In Motion or RIM for short) is a Canadian software company specializing in secure communications and the Internet of Things (IoT). Founded in 1984, it developed the BlackBerry brand of interactive pagers, smartphones, and tablets. The company transitioned to providing software and services and holds critical software application patents.

Initially leading the mobile phone and pager industry in the 1980s and 90s, the company struggled to gain a lasting presence in the smartphone market of the new millennium. BlackBerry led the market in many countries, particularly the United States, until 2010, with the announcement of the iPhone 4. The company withered against the rapid rise of Apple and Android. After the troubled launch of the BlackBerry 10, it transitioned to a cybersecurity enterprise software and services company under CEO John S. Chen. In 2018, the last BlackBerry smartphone, the BlackBerry Key2 LE, was released. In 2022, BlackBerry discontinued support for BlackBerry 10, ending their presence in the smartphone market.

BlackBerry&#x27;s software products are used by various businesses, car manufacturers, and government agencies to prevent hacking and ransomware attacks. They include BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BlackBerry Unified Endpoint Manager) and a Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) platform.

==History==
===1984–2001: early years and growth===

Research In Motion Limited was founded in March 1984 by Mike Lazaridis and Douglas Fregin. At the time, Lazaridis was an engineering student at the University of Waterloo while Fregin was an engineering student at the University of Windsor. In 1988, RIM became the first wireless data technology developer in North America and the first company outside the Nordic countries to develop connectivity products for Mobitex wireless packet-switched data communications networks. Mobitex&#x27;s wireless data transport also became RIM&#x27;s first wireless data service that powered the Blackberry and Palm devices until it was phased out. In 1990, RIM introduced the DigiSync Film KeyKode Reader. In 1991, it introduced the first Mobitex protocol converter. In 1992, it introduced the first Mobitex point-of-sale solution, a protocol converter box that interfaced with existing point-of-sale terminal equipment to enable wireless communication. In 1993, it introduced the RIMGate, the first general-purpose Mobitex X.25 gateway. In the same year, it launched Ericsson Mobidem AT and Intel wireless modems containing RIM modem firmware. In 1994, it introduced the first Mobitex mobile point-of-sale terminal. In the same year, it received the Emmy Award for Technical Innovation and the KPMG High Technology Award. In 1995, it introduced Freedom, the first Type II PCMCIA radio modem for Mobitex. 

In 1995, RIM was financed by Canadian institutional and venture capital investors through a private placement in the privately held company. Working Ventures Canadian Fund Inc. led the first venture round with a C$5,000,000 investment with the proceeds being used to complete the development of RIM&#x27;s two-way paging system hardware and software. A total of C$30,000,000 in pre-IPO financing was raised by the company prior to its initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange in January 1998 under the symbol RIM.

In 1996, RIM introduced the Interactive Pager, the first two-way messaging pager, and the RIM 900 OEM radio modem. The company developed the pager prototype with the support of Intel Corporation. The company worked with RAM Mobile Data and Ericsson to turn the Ericsson-developed Mobitex wireless data network into a two-way paging and wireless e-mail network. Pivotal in this development was the release of the Inter@ctive Pager 950. In August 1997, a prototype was presented to BellSouth executives, who were impressed with the device and agreed to a $70-million deal that involved the supply of 100,000 devices. The pager started shipping in August 1998. About the size of a bar of soap, this device competed against the Skytel two-way paging network developed by Motorola. 

In 1999, RIM introduced the BlackBerry 850 pager. This was also the first device to use the Blackberry OS. Named after its keyboard&#x27;s similarity to the druplets of the blackberry fruit, the device could receive push email from a Microsoft Exchange Server using its complementary server software, BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES). Its introduction set the stage for the company&#x27;s future enterprise-oriented products, such as the BlackBerry 957 in April 2000, the first BlackBerry smartphone. The BlackBerry OS platform and BES continued to increase in functionality, while the incorporation of encryption and S/MIME support helped BlackBerry devices gain increased usage by governments and businesses. During fiscal 1999-2001, RIM&#x27;s assets grew eight-fold due to massive capacity expansion. 

===2001–2011: global expansion and competition===
RIM soon began to introduce BlackBerry devices for the consumer market as well, beginning with the BlackBerry Pearl 8100the first BlackBerry phone to include multimedia features such as a camera. The Pearl series was highly successful, as was the subsequent Curve 8300 and Bold 9000 series. Extensive carrier partnerships fueled the rapid expansion of BlackBerry users globally in both enterprise and consumer markets. 

Despite the arrival of the first Apple iPhone in 2007, BlackBerry sustained market share growth well into 2011. The introduction of Apple&#x27;s iPhone on the AT&amp;T network in the fall of 2007 in the United States prompted RIM to produce its first touchscreen smartphone for the competing network in 2008the BlackBerry Storm. It sold well but suffered from mixed to poor reviews and poor customer satisfaction. The iPhone initially lagged behind BlackBerry in both shipments and active users, due to RIM&#x27;s head start and larger carrier distribution network. In the United States, the BlackBerry user base peaked at approximately 21 million users in the fall of 2010. That quarter, the company&#x27;s global subscriber base stood at 36 million users. As the iPhone and Google Android accelerated growth in the United States, the BlackBerry began to turn to other smartphone platforms. Nonetheless, the BlackBerry line as a whole continued to enjoy success, spurred on by strong international growth. As of December 1, 2012, the company had 79 million BlackBerry users globally with only 9 million remaining in the United States.

Even as the company continued to grow worldwide, investors and media became increasingly alarmed about the company&#x27;s ability to compete with devices from rival mobile operating systems iOS and Android. CNN cited BlackBerry as one of six endangered US-Canadian brands. Analysts were also worried about the company&#x27;s management structure.

Following numerous attempts to upgrade its existing Java platform, the company acquired QNX Software Systems to upgrade the BlackBerry platform, centered around its recently acquired real-time operating system QNX. In March 2011, then-co-CEO Jim Balsillie suggested during a conference call that the &quot;launch of some powerful new BlackBerrys&quot; (eventually released as BlackBerry 10) would be in early 2012. However, analysts were &quot;worried that promoting the mysterious, supposedly game-changing devices too early might hurt sales of existing BlackBerrys&quot; (similar to the Osborne effect). The initial launch date was seen in retrospect as too ambitious and hurt the company&#x27;s credibility at a time when its existing aging products steadily lost market share.

On September 27, 2010, RIM announced the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet, the first product running on the new QNX platform known as BlackBerry Tablet OS. The BlackBerry PlayBook was officially released to U.S. and Canadian consumers on April 19, 2011. It was criticized for being rushed to market in an incomplete state, and sold poorly. Following the shipments of 900,000 tablets during its first three quarters on market, slow sales and inventory pileups prompted the company to reduce prices and write down the inventory value by $485 million.

====Primary competition====
BlackBerry&#x27;s primary competitors were smartphones running Android OS, and the Apple iPhone. For a number of years, the BlackBerry was the leading smartphone in many markets, particularly the United States. The arrival of the iPhone and later Google&#x27;s Android platform caused a slowdown in BlackBerry growth and a decline in sales in some markets, most notably the United States, leading to negative media and analyst sentiment over the company&#x27;s ability to continue independently.

When Apple&#x27;s iPhone was introduced in 2007, it generated substantial media attention, with numerous media outlets calling it a &quot;BlackBerry killer&quot;. While BlackBerry sales continued to grow, the newer iPhone grew at a faster rate. The 87% drop in BlackBerry&#x27;s stock price between 2010 and 2013 was primarily attributed to the performance of the iPhone handset.

The first three iPhone models generally lagged behind the BlackBerry in sales, as RIM had major advantages in carrier and enterprise support; however, Apple continued gaining market share. In October 2008, Apple briefly passed RIM in quarterly sales when they announced they had sold 6.9 million iPhones to the 6.1 million sold by RIM, comparing partially overlapping quarters between the companies. Though Apple&#x27;s iPhone sales declined to 4.3 million in the subsequent quarter and RIM&#x27;s increased to 7.8 million, for some investors this was a sign of weakness. The iPhone began to sell more phones quarterly than the BlackBerry in 2010, brought on by the release of the iPhone 4.

In the United States, the BlackBerry hit its peak in September 2010, with almost 22 million users, or 37% of the 58.7 million American smartphones. BlackBerry then began to decline in use in the United States, with Apple&#x27;s installed base in the United States finally passing it in April 2011. Sales of the iPhone continued to accelerate, as did the smartphone market, while the BlackBerry began to lose users continuously in the United States. By February 2016, only 1.59 million (0.8%) of the 198.9 million smartphone users in the United States were running BlackBerry compared to 87.32 million (43.9%) on an iPhone.

Google&#x27;s Android mobile operating system, running on hardware by a range of manufacturers including Sony, Motorola, HTC, Samsung, LG and many others ramped up the competition for BlackBerry. In January 2010, barely 3 million (7.1%) of the 42.7 million Smartphones in use at the time in the United States were running Android, compared to 18 million BlackBerry devices (43%). Within a single year Android had passed the installed base of the BlackBerry in the United States. By February 2016, only 1.59 million (0.8%) of the 198.9 million smartphone users in the United States were running BlackBerry compared to 104.82 million (52.7%) running Android.

While RIM&#x27;s secure encrypted network was attractive to corporate customers, their handsets were sometimes considered less attractive to consumers than iPhone and Android smartphones. Developers often developed consumer applications for those platforms and not the BlackBerry. During 2010s, even enterprise customers had begun to adopt BYOD policies due to employee feedback. The company also faced criticism that its hardware and operating system were outdated and unappealing compared to the competition, as well as that the browsing capabilities were poorer.

===2011–2015: layoffs and strategic changes===
Slowing growth prompted the company to undertake a lay-off of 2,000 employees in the summer of 2011. In September 2011, the company&#x27;s BlackBerry Internet Service suffered a massive outage, impacting millions of customers for several days. The outage embarrassingly occurred as Apple prepared to launch the iPhone 4S, causing fears of mass defections from the platform.

Shortly afterwards, in October 2011, RIM unveiled BBX, a new platform for future BlackBerry smartphones that would be based on the same QNX-based platform as the PlayBook. However, due to an accusation of trademark infringement regarding the name BBX, the platform was renamed BlackBerry 10. The task proved daunting, with the company delaying the launch in December 2011 to some time in 2012. On January 22, 2012, Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie resigned as the CEOs of the company, handing the reins over to executive Thorsten Heins. On March 29, 2012, the company reported its first net loss in years. Heins set about the task of restructuring the company, including announcing plans to lay off 5,000 employees, replacing numerous executives, and delaying BlackBerry 10 a second time into January 2013.

====BlackBerry 10====

After much criticism and numerous delays, RIM officially launched BlackBerry 10 and two new smartphones based on the platform, the BlackBerry Z10 and Q10, on January 30, 2013. The BlackBerry Z10, the first BlackBerry smartphone running BlackBerry 10, debuted worldwide in January 2013, going on sale immediately in the U.K. with other countries following. A marked departure from previous BlackBerry phones, the Z10 featured a fully touch-based design, a dual-core processor, and a high-definition display. BlackBerry 10 had 70,000 applications available at launch, which the company expected would rise to 100,000 by the time the device made its debut in the United States. In support of the launch, the company aired its first Super Bowl television advertisement in the U.S. and Canada during Super Bowl XLVII. In discussing the decision to create a proprietary operating system instead of adopting an off-the-shelf platform such as Android, Heins noted, &quot;If you look at other suppliers&#x27; ability to differentiate, there&#x27;s very little wiggle room. We looked at it seriouslybut if you understand what the promise of BlackBerry is to its user base it&#x27;s all about getting stuff done. Games, media, we have to be good at it but we have to support those guys who are ahead of the game. Very little time to consume and enjoy contentif you stay true to that purpose you have to build on that basis. And if we want to serve that segment we can&#x27;t do it on a me-too approach.&quot; Chief Operating Officer Kristian Tear remarked &quot;We want to regain our position as the number one in the world&quot;, while Chief Marketing Officer Frank Boulben proclaimed &quot;It could be the greatest comeback in tech history. The carriers are behind us. They don&#x27;t want a duopoly&quot; (referring to Apple and Samsung).

During the BlackBerry 10 launch event, the company also announced that it would change its public brand from Research In Motion to BlackBerry. The name change was made to &quot;put the BlackBerry brand at the centre&quot; of the company&#x27;s diverse brands, and because customers in some markets &quot;already know the company as BlackBerry&quot;. A shareholder vote on an official name change to BlackBerry Limited was held at its next annual general meeting, after its ticker symbols on the TSX and NASDAQ already were changed to BB and BBRY respectively on February 4, 2013.

On August 12, 2013, the company announced that it was open to being purchased.

====Prem Watsa/Fairfax Deal====
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board&#x27;s CEO Mark Wiseman stated that he would consider investing in BlackBerry if the company became private. Also on August 12, 2013, foremost shareholder Prem Watsa resigned from BlackBerry&#x27;s board.

On September 20, 2013, the company announced it would lay off 4,500 staff and take a CAD$1 billion operating loss. Three days later, the company announced that it had signed a letter of intent to be acquired by a consortium led by Prem Watsa-owned Fairfax Financial Holdings for a $9 per share deal. This deal was also confirmed by Watsa.

On September 29, 2013, the company began operating a direct sales model for customers in the United States, where unlocked Q10 and Z10 smartphones were sold directly from the BlackBerry website. On October 15, 2013, the company published an open letter in 30 publications in nine countries to reassure customers that BlackBerry would continue to operate. Anthony Michael Sabino, St. John&#x27;s University business professor, stated in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;: &quot;This is BlackBerry&#x27;s last-ditch attempt to simply survive in the face of crushing competition in a market it essentially invented.&quot;

====John Chen joins BlackBerry====

On November 4, 2013, the Fairfax Prem Watsa deal was scrapped in favor of a US$1 billion cash injection which, according to one analyst, represented the level of confidence BlackBerry&#x27;s largest shareholder had in the company. At the same time, BlackBerry installed John Chen as CEO to replace the laid-off Heins. According to the Globe and Mail, BlackBerry&#x27;s hope was that Chen, with his reputation as a turnaround artist, could save the company.

&quot;We have begun moving the company to embrace a multi-platform, BYOD world by adopting a new mobility management platform and a new device strategy,&quot; Chen explained in an open letter published shortly after his appointment. &quot;I believe in the value of this brand. With the right team and the right strategy in place, I am confident that we will rebuild BlackBerry for the benefit of all our constituencies.&quot;

In April 2014, Chen spoke of his turnaround strategy in an interview with Reuters, explaining that he intended to invest in or partner with other companies in regulated industries such as healthcare, financial, and legal services. He later clarified that BlackBerry&#x27;s device division remained part of his strategy and that his company was also looking to invest in &quot;emerging solutions such as machine to machine technologies that will help power the backbone of the Internet of Things.&quot; He would later expand on this idea at a BlackBerry Security Summit in July 2014.

In May 2014, the low-cost BlackBerry Z3 was introduced in the Indonesian market, where the brand had been particularly popular. The budget handset was produced in partnership with Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn Technology Group, which handled the design and distribution of the product. A &quot;New York Times&quot; analysis stated that the model was an attempt by Chen to generate revenue while he tried &quot;to shift the organization&#x27;s focus to services and software.&quot; As part of the localization effort for the promotion of the Z3, the handset&#x27;s back panel was engraved with the word &quot;Jakarta&quot;, but skepticism still emerged, as the handset was still more than twice as expensive as Android models in Indonesia at the time of release.

===2015–present: software transition===
In the first quarter of the 2015 fiscal year, Chen stated: &quot;This is, of course, the very beginning of our task and we hope that we will be able to report better results going forward… We feel pretty good about where we are.&quot; &quot;Quartz&quot; reported that stock was up by 30 percent, compared to the same period in the previous year.

In September 2015, Chen unveiled the BlackBerry Priv, a keyboard-slider smartphone utilizing the Android operating system with BlackBerry-developed software enhancements, including a secure bootloader, full-disk encryption, integrity protection, and the BlackBerry HUB.

In 2020, BlackBerry signed a new licensing agreement for smartphones with the US-based startup company, OnwardMobility. The company never released a device before shutting down in 2022.

As of June 2021, Cybersecurity ($107 million) and IoT ($43 million) revenue accounted for a combined 86% of Q1 2022 earnings ($174 million). Chen reiterated: &quot;Now, we are pivoting the organization more heavily toward the market by creating two business units, Cybersecurity and IoT… we will provide revenue and gross margin by business unit as well as other selected metrics.&quot;

On January 4, 2022, BlackBerry decommissioned the infrastructure and operating system used by their non-Android phones.

In October 2023, the company announced that it would spin off its IoT business unit and hold an initial public offering for it in the next year.

====Acquisitions====
During this time, BlackBerry also expanded its software and services offerings with several acquisitions. These included file security firm WatchDox, crisis communications leader AtHoc, and rival EMM vendor Good Technology. The products offered by these firms were gradually re-branded and integrated into BlackBerry&#x27;s own portfolio. BlackBerry also announced the release of the Good Secure EMM Suites, consolidating WatchDox and Good Technology&#x27;s products into several tiered offerings alongside its existing software.

====Hardware licensing partnerships====
BlackBerry announced the DTeK50, a mid-range Android smartphone, on July 26, 2016. Unlike the Priv, the DTek50 was a re-branded version of an existing smartphone, the Alcatel Idol 4 as manufactured by TCL Corporation, one of the company&#x27;s hardware partners. It was to be the second-last phone ever developed in-house at BlackBerry, followed by the DTek60 in October 2016 – on September 28, 2016, BlackBerry announced that it would cease in-house hardware development to focus on software, delegating development, design, and manufacturing of its devices to third-party partners.

The first of these partners was BB Merah Putih, a joint venture in Indonesia. Chen stated that the company was &quot;no longer just about the smartphone, but the smart in the phone&quot;. On December 15, 2016, BlackBerry announced that it had reached a long-term deal with TCL to continue producing BlackBerry-branded smartphones for sale outside of Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. This partnership was followed by an agreement with Optiemus Infracom on February 6, 2017, to produce devices throughout India and neighbouring markets including Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh.

Since the partnerships were announced, TCL released the BlackBerry KeyOne and BB Merah Putih released the BlackBerry Aurora.

====Cybersecurity consulting====
In February 2016, BlackBerry acquired UK-based cybersecurity firm Encription, with the intention of branching out into the security consulting business.

====BlackBerry Secure====
On December 8, 2016, BlackBerry announced the release of BlackBerry Secure. Billed as a &quot;comprehensive mobile security platform for the Enterprise of Things&quot;, BlackBerry Secure deepened the integration between BlackBerry&#x27;s acquisitions and its core portfolio. According to Forbes, it brings all of BlackBerry&#x27;s products &quot;under a single umbrella&quot;.

Also in February 2017, analyst firm 451 Research released a report on BlackBerry&#x27;s improved financial position and product focus. The report identified BlackBerry&#x27;s position in the Internet of Things and its device licensing strategy as strengths.

=== John Chen resigns from BlackBerry ===
On October 30, 2023 John S. Chen announced his resignation as CEO through an employee letter posted to the Blackberry Limited blog page stating he will cease his role on November 4, 2023.

==Financials==
Until 2013, the number of active BlackBerry users increased over time. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended March 3, 2012, RIM shipped 11.1 million BlackBerry smartphones, down 21 percent from the previous quarter and it was the first decline in the quarter covering Christmas since 2006. For its fourth quarter, RIM announced a net loss of US$125 million (the last loss before this occurred in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2005). RIM&#x27;s loss of market share accelerated in 2011, due to the rapidly growing sales of Samsung and HTC Android handsets; RIM&#x27;s annual market share in the U.S. dropped to just 3 percent, from 9 percent.

In the quarter ended June 28, 2012, RIM announced that the number of BlackBerry subscribers had reached 78 million globally. Furthermore, RIM reported its first quarter revenue for the 2013 fiscal year, showing that the company incurred a GAAP net loss of US$518 million for the quarter, and announced a plan to implement a US$1 billion cost-saving initiative. The company also announced the delay of the new BlackBerry 10 OS until the first quarter of 2013.

After the release of the Apple iPhone 5 in September 2012, RIM CEO Thorsten Heins announced that the number of global users was up to 80 million, which sparked a 7% jump in shares. On December 2, 2012, the company reported a decline in the global subscriber base of BlackBerry to 79 million, after peaking at an all-time high of 80 million the previous quarter. Later that same month, media reports confirmed that BlackBerry lost US$1.049 billion during the second fiscal quarter of 2013. In the wake of the loss, Heins stated: &quot;We are very disappointed with our operational and financial results this quarter and have announced a series of major changes to address the competitive hardware environment and our cost structure.&quot;

Between 2010 and 2013, the stock price of the company dropped by 87 percent due to the widespread popularity of the iPhone. Goldman Sachs estimated that, in June 2014, BlackBerry accounted for 1 percent share of smartphone sales, compared to a peak of around 20 percent in 2009.

With the release of its financial results for the first fiscal quarter of 2015 in June 2014, Chen presented a more stable company that had incurred a lower amount of loss than previous quarters. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss.&quot; Following the news release, Chen stated that BlackBerry was comfortable with its position, and it is understood that his plan for the company mainly involves businesses and governments, rather than consumers.

==Organizational changes==

===Leadership changes===
The company was often criticized for its dual CEO structure. Some saw this arrangement as a dysfunctional management structure and believed RIM acted as two companies, slowing the effort to release the new BlackBerry 10 operating system. On June 30, 2011, an investor push for the company to split its dual-CEO structure was unexpectedly withdrawn after an agreement was made with RIM.

==== Stock option scandal settlement ====
In 2007, co-CEO Jim Balsillie was forced to resign as chairman as the company announced a $250 million earnings restatement relating to mistakes in how it granted stock options. Furthermore, an internal review found that hundreds of stock-option grants had been backdated, timed to a low share price to make them more lucrative.

In January 2009, Canadian regulators stated that they were seeking a record penalty of US$80 million from the top two executives, co-CEOs Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis. Furthermore, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) pushed for Balsillie to pay the bulk of any penalty and relinquish his seat on RIM&#x27;s board of directors for a period of time. On February 5, 2009, several executives and directors of Research In Motion agreed to pay the penalties to settle an investigation into the backdating of stock options. The Ontario Securities Commission approved the arrangement in a closed-door meeting. Under the terms of a settlement agreement with the OSC, RIM co-chief executive officers Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis, as well as chief operating officer Dennis Kavelman, jointly paid a total of C$68-million to RIM to reimburse the company for losses from the backdating and for the costs of a long internal investigation. The three were also required to pay C$9-million to the OSC. Balsillie resigned from RIM&#x27;s board of directors temporarily and remained in his executive role. In May 2010, almost immediately after the OSC sanctions expired, Balsillie was reappointed to the board in spite of strong shareholder objections.

==== Structural and personnel changes ====
Lazardis and Balsillie resigned as co-CEOs in January 2012. After years of tension, Balsille left the company entirely, stepping down from his executive role in March 2012. Following their resignations, they were replaced by a single CEO - former co-COO Thorsten Heins. Heins hired investment banks RBC Capital Markets and JP Morgan to seek out potential buyers interested in RIM, while also redoubling efforts on releasing BlackBerry 10.

Following the assumption of role as CEO, Heins made substantial changes to the company&#x27;s leadership team. Changes included the departures of Chief Technology Officer David Yach; Chief Operating Officer Jim Rowan; Senior Vice President of Software Alan Brenner; Chief Legal Officer, Karima Bawa; and Chief Information Officer Robin Bienfait.

Following the leadership changes, Heins hired Kristian Tear to assume the role of Chief Operating Officer, Frank Boulben to fill the Chief Marketing Officer role and appointed Dan Dodge, the CEO of QNX, to take over as Chief Technology Officer. On July 28, 2012, Steven E. Zipperstein was appointed as the new Vice President and Chief Legal Officer.

On March 28, 2013, Lazaridis relinquished his position as vice chairman and announced his resignation from the board of directors. Later in the year, Heins was replaced by John S. Chen, who assumed the CEO role in the first week of November. Chen&#x27;s compensation package mainly consists of BlackBerry shares—a total of 13 million—and he will be entitled to the entire number of shares after he has served the company for five years. Heins received an exit package of $22 million.

Chen has a reputation as a &quot;turnaround&quot; CEO, turning the struggling enterprise software and services organization Sybase into enough of a success to sign a merger with SAP in 2010. Chen was open about his plans for BlackBerry upon joining the company, announcing his intent to move away from hardware manufacturing to focus on enterprise software such as QNX, BlackBerry UEM, and AtHoc.

===Workforce reductions===
In June 2011, RIM announced its prediction that Q1 2011 revenue would drop for the first time in nine years, and also unveiled plans to reduce its workforce.

In July 2011, the company cut 2,000 jobs, the biggest lay-off in its history and the first major layoff since November 12, 2002, when the company laid off 10% of its workforce (200 employees). The lay-off reduced the workforce by around 11%, from 19,000 employees to 17,000.

On June 28, 2012, the company announced a planned workforce reduction of 5,000 by the end of its fiscal 2013, as part of a $1 billion cost savings initiative.

On July 25, 2013, 250 employees from BlackBerry&#x27;s research and development department and new product testing were laid off. The layoffs were part of the turnaround efforts.

On September 20, 2013, BlackBerry confirmed that the company will have a massive layoff of 4,500 employees by the end of 2013. This would be approximately 40 percent of the company&#x27;s workforce.

BlackBerry had at its peak about 20,000 employees. After CEO John Chen joined BlackBerry in 2013 there were additional layoffs in February 2015 to compete with smartphones, at which point the total employees numbered 6,225. On July 21, 2015, BlackBerry announced an additional layoff of an unspecified number of employees, with another 200 laid off in February 2016.

, the company had 3,225 employees.

==Mobile OS transition==
===BlackBerry OS ===

The BlackBerry OS was intended to operate under much different, simpler conditions such as low powered devices, narrow network bandwidth, and high-security enterprises. However, the aging platform struggled with emerging trends like mobile web browsing, consumer applications, multimedia and touch screen interfaces. Users experienced performance issues, usability problems and instability.

The company tried to enhance the old platform, but ultimately decided to build a new platform with QNX at its core.

===BlackBerry Tablet OS (QNX)===

The BlackBerry PlayBook was the first RIM product whose BlackBerry Tablet OS was built on QNX, launched in April 2011 as an alternative to the Apple iPad. However, it was criticized for having incomplete software and a poor app selection. It fared poorly until prices were substantially reduced, like most other tablet computers released that year. The BlackBerry Tablet OS received a major update in February 2012, as well as numerous minor updates.

===BlackBerry 10 (QNX)===

BlackBerry 10, a substantially updated version of BlackBerry Tablet OS intended for the next generation BlackBerry smartphones, was originally planned for release in early 2012. The company delayed the product several times, remembering the criticism faced by the BlackBerry Playbook launch and citing the need for it to be perfect in order to stand a chance in the market. The most recent model with this OS was the BlackBerry Leap.

===Android===

In September 2015, BlackBerry announced the Priv, a handset running Android 5.1.1 &quot;Lollipop&quot;. It is the first phone by the company not to run an in-house built operating system. The version of Android running on the Priv is very similar to the standard version developed by Google, with some changes to improve productivity and security. BlackBerry implemented some of the features of BlackBerry 10 within Android, such as BlackBerry Hub, BlackBerry Virtual Keyboard, BlackBerry Calendar, and BlackBerry Contacts.

On July 26, 2016, a mid-range model with only an on-screen keyboard was introduced, the slim BlackBerry DTEK50, powered by the then-latest version of Android (6.0, Marshmallow) and featuring a 5.2-inch full high-definition display. BlackBerry chief security officer David Kleidermacher stressed data security during the launch, indicating that this model included built-in malware protection and encryption of all user information. By then, the BlackBerry Classic, which used the BlackBerry 10 OS, had been discontinued.

In July 2016, industry observers expected the company to announce two additional smartphones over the subsequent 12 months, presumably also with the Android OS. However, BlackBerry COO Marty Beard told Bloomberg that &quot;The company&#x27;s never said that we would not build another BB10 device.&quot;

In 2018, the last Blackberry smartphone, the BlackBerry Key2 LE, was released. In 2022, BlackBerry discontinued support for BlackBerry 10, effectively ending their presence in the smartphone market.

BlackBerry Ltd. acquired Scroon in May 2013. The French startup manages Facebook, Twitter and other social-media accounts for large clients like luxury-good maker LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, wireless operator Orange SA (ORA) and Warner Bros. Entertainment. The deal was publicly announced in November 2013. According to Scroon founder, Alexandre Mars, he had not disclosed the purchase by BlackBerry before because of the &quot;delicate media buzz&quot; around the company. Scroon is part of BlackBerry&#x27;s strategy to profit from the BlackBerry Messenger instant-messaging service by utilizing the newly unveiled BBM Channels. Financial terms were not disclosed.

===Movirtu===
Movirtu was acquired in September 2014, by BlackBerry. Movirtu is a U.K. startup that allows multiple phone numbers to be active on a single mobile device. At the time of the acquisition BlackBerry announced they would expand this functionality beyond BlackBerry 10 to other mobile platforms such as Android and iOS.

==Patent litigation==
Since the turn of the century, RIM has been embroiled in a series of suits relating to alleged patent infringement.

===Glenayre Electronics===
In 2001, Research In Motion sued competitor Glenayre Electronics Inc. for patent infringement, partly in response to an earlier infringement suit filed by Glenayre against RIM. RIM sought an injunction to prevent Glenayre from infringing on RIM&#x27;s &quot;Single Mailbox Integration&quot; patent. The suit was ultimately settled in favour of RIM. 

===Good Technology===
In June 2002, Research In Motion filed suit against 2000 start-up and competitor Good Technology. RIM filed additional complaints throughout the year. In March 2004, Good agreed to a licensing deal, thereby settling the outstanding litigation.

===Handspring===
On September 16, 2002, Research In Motion was awarded a patent pertaining to keyboard design on hand-held e-mail devices. Upon receiving the patent, it proceeded to sue Handspring over its Treo device. Handspring eventually agreed to license RIM&#x27;s patent and avoid further litigation in November of the same year.

===NTP===

During the appeals, RIM discovered new prior art that raised a &quot;substantial new question of patentability&quot; and filed for a reexamination of the NTP patents in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. That reexamination was conducted separately to the court cases for infringement. In February 2006, the USPTO rejected all of NTP&#x27;s claims in three disputed patents. NTP appealed the decision, and the reexamination process was still ongoing as of July 2006 (See NTP, Inc. for details).

On March 3, 2006, RIM announced that it had settled its BlackBerry patent dispute with NTP. Under the terms of the settlement, RIM agreed to pay NTP US$612.5 million in a &quot;full and final settlement of all claims&quot;. In a statement, RIM said that &quot;all terms of the agreement have been finalized and the litigation against RIM has been dismissed by a court order this afternoon. The agreement eliminates the need for any further court proceedings or decisions relating to damages or injunctive relief.&quot;

===Xerox===
On July 17, 2003, while still embroiled in litigation with NTP and Good Technology, RIM filed suit against Xerox in the U.S. District of Hartford, Connecticut. The suit was filed in response to discussions about patents held by Xerox that might affect RIM&#x27;s business and also asked that patents held by Xerox be invalidated.

===Visto===
On May 1, 2006, RIM was sued by Visto for infringement of four patents. Though the patents were widely considered invalid and in the same veins as the NTP patents – with a judgement going against Visto in the U.K. – RIM settled the lawsuit in the United States on July 16, 2009, with RIM agreeing to pay Visto US$267.5 million plus other undisclosed terms.

===Motorola===
On January 22, 2010, Motorola requested that all BlackBerry smartphones be banned from being imported into the United States for infringing upon five of Motorola&#x27;s patents. Their patents for &quot;early-stage innovations&quot;, including UI, power management and WiFi, are in question. RIM countersued later the same day, alleging anti-competitive behaviour and that Motorola had broken a 2003 licensing agreement by refusing to extend licensing terms beyond 2008. The companies settled out of court on June 11, 2010.

===Eatoni===
On December 5, 2011, Research In Motion obtained an order granting its motion to dismiss plaintiff Eatoni&#x27;s claims that RIM violated Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act and equivalent portions of New York&#x27;s Donnelly Act. Eatoni alleged that RIM&#x27;s alleged infringement of plaintiff&#x27;s &#x27;317 patent constituted an antitrust violation. Eatoni Ergonomics, Inc. v. Research In Motion Corp., No. 08-Civ. 10079 (WHP) (S.D.N.Y. , 2011), Memorandum and Order, p. 1 (Pauley, J.).

===Mformation===
In July 2012, a U.S. federal court jury awarded damages (later overturned) of $147 million against Research In Motion. The jury decided that Research In Motion had violated patents of Mformation and calculated damages of $8 each on 18.4 million units for royalties on past sales of devices to nongovernment U.S. customers only, not including future royalty payments inside and outside the U.S. On August 9, 2012, that verdict was overturned on appeal. RIM had argued that Mformation&#x27;s patent claims were invalid because the processes were already being used when Mformation filed its patent application. Judge James Ware said Mformation failed to establish that RIM had infringed on the company&#x27;s patent.

===Qualcomm===
On May 26, 2017, BlackBerry announced that it had reached an agreement with Qualcomm Incorporated resolving all amounts payable in connection with the interim arbitration decision announced on April 12, 2017. Following a joint stipulation by the parties, the arbitration panel has issued a final award providing for the payment by Qualcomm to BlackBerry of a total amount of U.S.$940,000,000 including interest and attorneys&#x27; fees, net of certain royalties due from BlackBerry for calendar 2016 and the first quarter of calendar 2017.

===Facebook===
On March 8, 2018, BlackBerry Limited sued Facebook Inc. in federal court in Los Angeles. According to BlackBerry Limited, Facebook has built swaths of its empire on the messaging technology which was originally developed by them during the time when the Facebook chief, Mark Zuckerberg, was still living in a Harvard University dorm room. Blackberry Limited alleged that many features of the Facebook messaging service infringe on BlackBerry patents. In January 2021, BlackBerry shares jumped 20% after settling its patent dispute with Facebook.

==Controversies==
===Environmental record===
In November 2011, Blackberry, then RIM, was ranked 15th out of 15 electronics manufacturers in Greenpeace&#x27;s re-launched Guide to Greener Electronics. In its 2012 report on progress relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated RIM the sixth highest of 24 consumer electronics companies. In 2014, RIM partnered with Solutions for Hope to expand the number of conflict-free mineral regions in the Congo.

===Service outages===
On October 10, 2011, RIM experienced one of the worst service outages in the company&#x27;s history. Tens of millions of BlackBerry users in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and North America were unable to receive or send emails and BBM messages through their phones. The outage was caused as a result of a core switch failure, &quot;A transition to a back-up switch did not function as tested, causing a large backlog of data, RIM said.&quot; Service was restored on October 13, with RIM announcing a $100 package of free premium apps for users and enterprise support extensions.

===Government access to encrypted communication===
After a four-year stand-off with the Indian government over access to RIM&#x27;s secure networks, the company demonstrated the ability to intercept consumer email and messaging traffic between BlackBerry handsets, and make these encrypted communications available to Indian security agencies. This agreement does not include its enterprise services.

Through the Canadian Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, Blackberry has given its master encryption keys to law enforcement, allowing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to view communications and other encrypted information. Then-CEO John Chen defended the company&#x27;s sharing of data, saying &quot;(we) have long been clear in our stance that tech companies as good corporate citizens should comply with reasonable lawful access requests.&quot;

<text>Fei Xiaotong or Fei Hsiao-tung (November 2, 1910 – April 24, 2005) was a Chinese anthropologist and sociologist. He was a pioneering researcher and professor of sociology and anthropology; he was also noted for his studies in the study of China&#x27;s ethnic groups as well as a social activist. Starting in the late 1930s, he and his colleagues established Chinese sociology and his works were instrumental in laying a foundation for the development of sociological and anthropological studies in China, as well as in introducing social and cultural phenomena of China to the international community. His last post before his death in 2005 was as Professor of Sociology at Peking University.

==Early years==
Fei Xiaotong was born in Wujiang County of Jiangsu province in China on November 2, 1910. His world was one plagued with political corruption and abject poverty. He grew up in a gentry but yet not wealthy family. His father, Fei Pu&#x27;an () was educated in the Chinese classics, earned a &quot;shengyuan&quot; civil service degree, studied in Japan, and founded a middle school. Fei&#x27;s mother, Yang Renlan (), the Christian daughter of a government official and also highly educated for her time, established a nursery school in Wujiang which Fei attended. Her brothers include Chinese politician Yang Qianli (father of Hong Kong director and lyricwriter Evan Yang), Architect Yang Xiliu (S. J. Young), Chinese-American animator Cy Young, and entrepreneur Yang Xiren.

==Career in academic sociology==
At missionary-founded Yenching University in Beiping, which had China&#x27;s best sociology program, he was stimulated by the semester visit of Robert E. Park, the University of Chicago sociologist. For an M.A. in anthropology, Fei went to nearby Tsinghua University where he studied with Pan Guangdan and learned fieldwork methods from a White Russian, S. M. Shirokogoroff. Fei&#x27;s first fieldwork experience, in the rugged mountains of Guangxi province in the far south, ended tragically after Fei&#x27;s leg was crushed by a tiger trap, and his young bride Wang Tonghui () died seeking help.

===&quot;Functional&quot; anthropology===
From 1936 to 1938 Fei studied at the London School of Economics under the pioneer anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski. &quot;From Malinowski and A.R. Radcliffe-Brown, Fei learned to focus on the functional interrelationships of various &quot;parts&quot; of a community and on the meaning of a culture as seen by its members. He devised survey methods which incorporated the functional approach ... &quot; Fei wrote his 1938 PhD thesis, based on earlier fieldwork in Kaixiangong (Chinese:) village, China and published it as &quot;Peasant Life in China&quot; (1939).

Among Fei Xiaotong&#x27;s contributions to anthropology is the concept that Chinese social relations work through social networks of personal relations with the self at the center and decreasing closeness as one moves out. Among the criticisms of Fei Xiaotong&#x27;s work is that his work tended to ignore regional and historical variations in Chinese behavior. Nonetheless, as a pioneer and educator, his intent was to highlight general trends, thus this simplification may have had significant justification for Fei&#x27;s intent, even if they contributed to a bias in studies of Chinese society and culture.

An important work of the period, &quot;China&#x27;s Gentry&quot;, was compiled from Fei&#x27;s field interviews, and was published in the United States in 1953. It went on to become a staple of American university courses on China. The compilation and U.S. publication of &quot;China&#x27;s Gentry&quot; grew out of a relationship Fei developed at Tsinghua University with the University of Chicago anthropologist Robert Redfield and his wife, Margaret Park Redfield.

==Leading intellectual in People&#x27;s Republic of China==
===1950s and 1960s: Politics in command===
After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, Fei played an important role in national intellectual and ideological life, and before long he began to hold a growing number of political positions. He was made vice president in 1951 of the Central Institute for Nationalities in Beijing (today, Minzu University of China), and in 1954 attended the First National People&#x27;s Congress as a member of the Nationalities Affairs Commission.

Soon thereafter, however, departments of sociology were eliminated (as a &quot;bourgeois pseudo-science&quot;). Fei no longer taught, and published less and less. During the “Hundred Flowers” thaw of 1956–57, he began to speak out again, cautiously suggesting the restoration of sociology. But then the climate suddenly changed with the “Anti-Rightist Movement.” In 1957, Fei stood with head bowed before countless assemblies to confess his “crimes toward the people.” Hundreds of articles attacked him, not a few by colleagues, some viciously dishonest. Fei became an outcast, humiliated, isolated, unable to teach, do research, or publish. Twenty-three years of his life, he would later write, years that should have been his most productive period, were simply lost, wasted. At the height of the Cultural Revolution, physically attacked by Red Guards, forced to clean toilets, he contemplated suicide.

===1970s and 1980s: A &#x27;second life&#x27;===
In the 1970s, Fei, internationally known, began to receive foreign visitors, and after Mao&#x27;s death he was asked to direct the restoration of Chinese sociology. He visited the United States again and was subsequently able to arrange the visits to China of American social scientists to help with the gigantic task of training a whole new cadre of Chinese sociologists. In 1980 he was formally rehabilitated, and was one of the judges in the long, televised trial of the Gang of Four and others held responsible for the crimes of the Cultural Revolution.

His &#x27;second life&#x27; was more than ever that of the public intellectual, with important political posts and contact with policy makers. His influence is thought to have been important in convincing the government to promote rural industry, whose rapid growth in the 1980s raised the income of hundreds of millions of villagers all over China. Virtually every week in the 1990s his name was in the newspapers and his face on television. He traveled all over China, went abroad, to the US, Canada, Europe, Japan, Australia, and elsewhere, and was showered with international honors: the Malinowski Award of the Society for Applied Anthropology, the Huxley Memorial Medal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, an honorary doctorate from the University of Hong Kong, and other honors in Japan, the Philippines, Canada. He played a role in promoting and directing the reestablishment of sociology and anthropology in China, training scholars and developing teaching materials after thirty years of prohibition.

Fei is also known for his influential theory on ethnic groups in Chinese history, which follows the tradition of Lewis H. Morgan&#x27;s stage-developmental evolutionism. A representative example of his work is Fei&#x27;s 1988 Tanner lecture in Hong Kong, &quot;Plurality and Unity in the Configuration of the Chinese Nationality.&quot; According to Fei, the Huaxia became a true ethnic group, the Han, during the Qin dynasty. Afterwards, the Han became &quot;a nucleus with centripetal force&quot; with their stable agricultural society attracting and assimilating ethnic nomads from China&#x27;s northern frontier such as the Qiang.

===The 1990s and 2000s: reminiscence and caution===
Above all, it was as a writer that Fei flourished in his &#x27;second life&#x27;. Virtually all of his old books were republished during these years, and he turned out new books and articles in even greater quantity. Of the fifteen volumes of his “Works” (1999–2001), new writings from the 1980s and 1990s fill over half. Many of the themes were familiar. He repeatedly and forcefully set forth the case for sociology and anthropology in China if modernization were to succeed. He reminisced about his village fieldwork, his studies, and his teachers. There were articles and books on rural industrialization, small towns, national minorities, and developing frontier areas. He championed the cause of intellectuals. He recounted what he had learned from his trips abroad and made some new translations from English. There was even a little book of his poetry. What is different in all this new writing is political caution; Fei had too much to do and too little time in the last decades to risk playing with fire again.

He was Professor of Sociology at Peking University at the time of his death on April 24, 2005, in Beijing at the age of 94. A memorial has been set up in the Department of Sociology at the university, where he has taught and directed since the 1980s.

<text>The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, officially the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, is the highest organ when the national congress is not in session and is tasked with carrying out congress resolutions, directing all party work, and representing the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) externally. It is currently composed of 205 full members and 171 alternate members (see list). Members are nominally elected once every five years by the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. In practice, the selection process is done privately, usually through consultation of the CCP&#x27;s Politburo and its corresponding Standing Committee.

The Central Committee is, formally, the &quot;party&#x27;s highest organ of authority&quot; when the National Congress is not in a plenary session. According to the CCP&#x27;s constitution, the Central Committee is vested with the power to elect the General Secretary and the members of the Politburo and its Standing Committee, as well as the Central Military Commission. It endorses the composition of the Secretariat and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. It also oversees the work of various executive national organs of the CCP. The administrative activities of the Central Committee are carried out by the Central Committee&#x27;s General Office. The General Office forms the support staff of the central organs that work on the Central Committee&#x27;s behalf in between plenary sessions (plenums).

The Committee usually convenes at least once a year at a plenum, and functions as a top forum for discussion about relevant policy issues. The committee operates, however, on the principle of democratic centralism; i.e., once a decision is made, the entire body speaks with one voice. The role of the Central Committee has varied throughout history. While it generally exercises power through formal procedures defined in the party constitution, the ability for it to affect outcomes of national-level personnel decisions is limited, as that function has generally been, in practice, carried out by the Politburo and retired party elders who retain influence. Nonetheless, Central Committee plenums function as venues whereby policy is discussed, fine-tuned, and publicly released in the form of &quot;resolutions&quot; or &quot;decisions&quot;.

== History ==
=== Early history ===

The Central Committee&#x27;s role has varied throughout history. It was founded in 1927 as a successor organization to the &quot;Central Executive Committee&quot; (), a group of party leaders charged with executing party work during the pre-revolutionary days of the CCP. Over the next several decades it served to confirm the party leadership lineup and legitimize military, strategic, and foreign relations decisions of the party. In practice, power was concentrated in a small group of military and political leaders (the Secretariat or the Politburo), and, beginning at the Zunyi Conference in 1935, Mao held great power personally. Moreover, during the Second Sino-Japanese war and the Chinese Civil War between 1937 and 1949, the Central Committee rarely convened, partly because of the logistical difficulties of bringing together leading cadres involved in different theatres of war and agitation.

Beginning in 1949 at the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Central Committee gradually transformed from a revolutionary organ to a governing one, though again the day-to-day work and most political power resided with a few leaders, most notably the Politburo, then &quot;de facto&quot; chaired by Liu Shaoqi, and the Secretariat, then under Deng Xiaoping. Although the Central Committee was required to convene at least once a year, it did not convene at all in 1951–53, 1960, 1963–65, and 1967. Informal and &#x27;extraordinary&#x27; mechanisms were sometimes used for the purposes of discussing party policy, for example, the Seven Thousand Cadres Conference in 1962, meant to be a summation of the lessons of the Great Leap Forward. Mao did not hold absolute power over the Central Committee, as evidenced by the debates surrounding the policies of the Great Leap Forward, as well as the economic policies of the early 1960s. However, Mao used Central Committee meetings as a platform to project authority or legitimize decisions which have been made in advance, such as at the Lushan Conference of 1959, when the Central Committee ratified the decision to denounce Peng Dehuai, who had spoken out in opposition of the Great Leap Forward.

During the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, the Central Committee essentially ceased to function; it was convened in August 1966 (11th Plenum of the 8th CC) to cement decisions already made by Mao on launching the Cultural Revolution. Mao faced some opposition at the 11th Plenum but ultimately most delegates were goaded into ratifying Mao&#x27;s decisions. Many members were politically disgraced or purged thereafter. The committee was then convened again in October 1968 (12th Plenum) to ratify the decision to expel then head of state Liu Shaoqi from the Party. At the 12th plenum, less than half the members actually attended, as many had fallen victim to the Cultural Revolution. In a letter to Mao &quot;evaluating&quot; the members of the Central Committee at the time, Kang Sheng wrote that some 70% of CC members were considered &quot;traitors, spies, or otherwise politically unreliable&quot;. The Central Committee membership at the 9th Party Congress in April 1969 was largely handpicked by Mao and a small group of radical allies. The decisions at the Congress were later deemed to be &quot;wholly and absolutely wrong&quot; by official party historians.

=== Since economic reforms of 1978 ===

Since economic reforms began in 1978, the Central Committee has usually been composed of the leading figures of the party, government, the provinces, and the military. In contrast to Party Congresses, which have always been essentially ceremonial exercises, full meetings of the Central Committee have occasionally emerged as arenas in which there were substantive debates and decisions on party policy. An example of this was the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee in 1978, at which China formally embarked on a project of economic reform. Deng Xiaoping also attempted to increase the level of &quot;intra party democracy&quot; in the 1980s by introducing so-called &quot;more candidates than seats&quot; election method (). The &quot;Cha&#x27;e&quot; method meant that not everyone who was nominated would be elected to the Central Committee.

Despite experimenting with power separation on a broad scale in the 1980s, including the separation of party and state leadership positions, real decision-making power continued to reside in the hands of a dozen or so party elites, including party elders that formed the Central Advisory Commission (later abolished). For instance, the decision to crack down on the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and on top leadership changes in its aftermath, such as the purge of then General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, were made by &quot;party elders&quot; and a small group of top leaders, without first convening the Central Committee. Zhao questioned the legality of his removal in his memoirs released in 2006.

While Central Committee meetings do not usually serve as forums for substantive debate, they have sometimes &#x27;fine-tuned&#x27; the policies agreed upon at the Politburo level. But the Central Committee does not, by convention, overturn policies decided at higher levels. The Central Committee is larger and has a somewhat more diverse ideological spectrum than the Politburo. Since its plenary sessions is a rare event that concentrates almost all of China&#x27;s top leaders in one location, it could also be seen as a convenient venue for informal deal-making.

=== 21st century ===
Hu Jintao&#x27;s administration (2002–2012) attempted to embrace collective leadership, as well as more &quot;intra-party democracy&quot;; Hu was not a strong &quot;core&quot; figure in the same sense as Mao or Deng Xiaoping. The Central Committee thus gained more prominence as a &quot;bona fide&quot; consultation body. In 2003, Hu also cancelled the traditional August leadership retreat at the coastal town of Beidaihe, while giving more media coverage to the Central Committee plenums held in the fall. This was seen as an indication that Hu wanted to eschew informal decision-making by the handful of elites in favour of &quot;inner-party democracy&quot; involving bodies such as the Central Committee. However, the Beidaihe meetings resumed in July 2007, when political deliberation took place in anticipation of the 17th Party Congress; the same Bedaihe retreat also took place in 2011 in anticipation of the 18th Party Congress. This indicated that important personnel and policy decisions continued to be the domain of a small group of elites at the very top of the party hierarchy.

Since the 17th Party Congress, the Central Committee has seen an increase in the number of regional leadership figures. The 17th Central Committee formed with every province-level Party Secretary and Governor gaining a full seat on the Central Committee. The rise of regional party representation came at the expense of that of government ministries. Since Xi Jinping&#x27;s rise to power at the 18th Party Congress, the Central Committee plenums in 2013 and 2014 were given significant media coverage, as they marked the beginning of another round of comprehensive economic and social reforms (2013) and legal reforms (2014), respectively.

In 2016, a Central Committee plenum was held, focusing mainly on in-party discipline and supervision. This plenum also gained a significant media coverage in China and abroad.
== Function ==
According to the party constitution, the Central Committee is tasked with &quot;carrying out the decisions of the National Congress, leading the work of the party, and representing the party internationally.&quot; The Central Committee is therefore technically the &quot;party&#x27;s highest organ of authority&quot; when the National Congress is not in session. The National Congress is convened only once every five years, so the Central Committee can be called upon in the interim to make extremely far-reaching decisions, or at least legitimize a change in direction mandated by the Politburo or other party leaders. The Central Committee must also be theoretically convened to prepare for a National Congress; for example, to determine its dates, delegate selection, agenda, and so on.

The Central Committee has the power to elect the General Secretary and the members of the Politburo, its Standing Committee, and the Central Military Commission. These elections take place in the form of confirmation votes; i.e., there is only one candidate, a delegate can choose to vote for or against or abstain for that candidate. In some instances write-in candidates may also be allowed. In practice, for important posts such as the General Secretary or the Politburo Standing Committee, there is no known occasion since 1949 where the Central Committee voted against a candidate already vetted by the top party leadership in advance.

The Central Committee also confirms membership of the Secretariat, the organ in charge of executing party policy, whose membership is determined through nomination by the Politburo Standing Committee.

The directors of China&#x27;s 50 largest state-owned enterprises are appointed directly by the Central Committee and are equivalent in rank to ministers or vice ministers.

=== Plenary sessions ===

The Committee usually convenes at least once a year at a plenary session. The plenums typically open and close in the state banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People, with the working meetings of the plenum being held at the military run Jingxi Hotel in Beijing. The plenums of the Central Committee are the most important annually occurring event in Chinese politics. Normally, seven plenums are held over a five-year term of the Central Committee; two plenums are held at the year of the Party National Congress, another two held in the following year, and one held in each of the other three years. The first, second and seventh plenums generally deal with procedures around the five-yearly power transition process, containing no major policy announcements.

The first plenum, held a day after the conclusion of a Party National Congress, elects the top leadership, including the Politburo, the Politburo Standing Committee, and the General Secretary. The second plenum, held in February or March of the following year, typically approves a list of candidates for state positions, as well as a plan to overhaul Party and State organizations, which are then approved during a National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) session held immediately afterwards. The third plenum, generally held in the autumn of the year after the Party Congress, focuses on economic issues, and is generally the session when major economic and reform decisions are made and announced. The fifth plenum focuses on finalizing the upcoming five-year plan, which is then approved by the NPC in the following spring. The fourth and sixth plenums do not have a fixed theme, and usually focus on CCP ideology or Party building. The seventh plenum, the last held before the end of a Central Committee&#x27;s term, focuses on preparations for the upcoming Party Congress.

== Structure and membership selection ==
The Central Committee houses three important party departments: (1) the Organization Department, (2) the Publicity Department, and (3) the United Front Work Department. It has a secretariat which performs routine tasks including arranging leadership&#x27;s schedules and document flows.

Central Committee members are elected every five years during the Party Congress, and they in turn vote for the new Politburo, standing committee, and general secretary. The Central Committee has full members (委员 – &quot;weiyuan&quot;) and alternate or candidate members (候补委员 – &quot;houbuweiyuan&quot;). The practice of having &quot;full&quot; and &quot;alternate&quot; members is consistent with other Leninist parties in history, such as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union or the Communist Party of Vietnam. Members are elected by National Congresses through a confirmation vote (i.e., vote &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, or abstain) on a candidate list, where the number of candidates exceed the number of available seats. Unlike the Politburo, whose membership has historically been determined by informal deliberations that include incumbent Politburo members and retired Politburo Standing Committee members, the method of candidate selection for the Central Committee membership receives less coverage, though it appears to be managed by the incumbent Politburo and its Standing Committee. Since the 1980s membership patterns in the Central Committee have gradually stabilized. For example, provincial governors and party secretaries are almost guaranteed a seat on the Central Committee.

The primary difference between full members and alternate members is that full members have voting rights. Alternate members attend Central Committee plenary sessions, and can presumably voice their views on issues, but do not have the right to vote. At party plenary sessions, members of the Politburo seats at the front of the auditorium or meeting hall, facing the rest of the Central Committee. Full members are ordered by protocol, and seated, according to &quot;surname stroke order&quot; (&quot;xingshi bihua paiming&quot;), an impartial ordering system that is roughly equivalent of alphabetizing the names. Alternate members follow a different protocol sequence: they are arranged by the number of votes received when they were elected at the previous Party Congress.

Alternate members may be elevated to full members if a full member dies in office, resigns, or is removed from the body. Priority of ascension to full member status is given to the alternate member who received the highest number of votes in favour at the previous Party Congress.

Membership changes, such as the expulsion of a full member or an elevation of an alternate member, are confirmed through passing a formally adopted resolution at Central Committee plenary sessions.

=== Contemporary composition ===
==== Full members ====
Most members of the Central Committee are provincial governors or government ministers. For example, officials holding, or expected to hold the following positions at the time of a new party congress can be generally expected to hold a seat on the Central Committee:
* The party chiefs and governors of provinces (mayors of direct-controlled municipalities and chairpersons of autonomous regions)
* The ministers and minister-level commissioners of the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China
* The heads of the military-region level organizations of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, including the heads of the PLA departments under the Central Military Commission 
* Ministerial-level heads of the party organizations which report directly to the Central Committee, including the chiefs of the General Offices serving major party leading groups
* The national-level heads of state-sponsored civic institutions

Occasionally officials of vice-ministerial rank could also hold membership on the Central Committee, though only in rare and exceptional circumstances. For example, Ma Xingrui, the party chief of Shenzhen (as of 2015), was a member of the 18th Central Committee.

While institutional rules has, since the 1980s, played a major role in the selection of Central Committee members, it does not &quot;guarantee&quot; that holders of a specific office will gain a seat on the CC. If a CC member is transferred to a different post, they maintain their CC membership. For example, a Governor of Shandong who is transferred to a position of less significance does not lose his seat on the CC, neither will his successor gain a seat on the CC. This has created situations in which individuals who do not sit on the Central Committee assume provincial leadership positions. An individual already provisionally named to a provincial leadership post may also be rejected by the &quot;more candidates than seats&quot; voting method – as appeared to be the case with Li Yuanchao (then Jiangsu party chief) in 2002, and Yang Xiong (mayor of Shanghai) in 2012.

==== Alternate members ====
In contrast to full membership, alternate membership of the Central Committee is more varied in its composition, and there are fewer institutional rules governing its membership list. Generally speaking, since the 1980s, alternate membership in the Central Committee is composed of officials of provincial-ministerial rank or sub-provincial (vice-minister) rank. They are selected based on a combination of experience and the institutions that they represent. Many are heads of provincial party departments or party chiefs of big cities. Prominent academics with no political experience and state-owned enterprise chief executives often hold alternate seats on the Central Committee. Some alternate members therefore hold no other political positions. Younger alternate members are also generally seen to be &quot;up-and-coming&quot; national leaders.

=== Election of members ===
Though all nominations for the Central Committee are decided beforehand, since the 13th Party Congress in 1987, in the spirit of promoting &quot;inner-party democracy&quot;, the number of candidates up for election for both full members and alternate members have been greater than the number of available seats. Nominees for the Central Committee who receive the lowest number of votes from Party Congress delegates are thus unable to enter the Central Committee. At the 18th Party Congress, a total of 224 candidates stood for election for full membership for a total of 205 seats. A total of 190 candidates stood for election for a total of 171 alternate seats. This meant that 9.3% of full member candidates and 11.1% alternate member candidates were not elected.

=== Age and turnover of membership ===
Since the 1980s, the membership of the Central Committee has experienced rapid turnover, mostly due to the institutionalization of the system of promotions for party officials as well as an informally mandated retirement age, currently set at 65 for minister-level officials (which comprise the majority of the members of the Central Committee). The average age of members in the 18th Central Committee is 56.1 years. From the 1980s onwards, an average of 62% of the membership of the outgoing Central Committee has been replaced at each party congress. Since most members are at least 50 years old when they enter the body, the mandatory retirement age essentially serves as a &#x27;term limit&#x27; on the entire membership of the Central Committee, whereby no member or group of members could conceivably serve longer than three terms on the Central Committee. It also makes forming enduring political factions difficult. Chinese politics analyst Cheng Li noted that this makes the body much more fluid than most national legislatures, for which term limits do not generally apply.

<text>The French post offices in the Ottoman Empire were post offices in various cities of the Ottoman Empire run by France between 1812 and 1923. France was one of a half-dozen European countries, the others being Austria, Russia, Great Britain, Germany and Italy, which had been granted the right to maintain post offices within the Empire. This privilege was distinct from the so-called &quot;Capitulations&quot; which, since the 16th century, had been negotiated with a much larger number of countries and which granted some extraterritorial rights to citizens and commercial enterprises of those countries. Initially restricted to consular mail, these post offices could soon be used by foreign and local businesses and individuals, provided they used the postage stamps of the post office concerned. The system came to end with the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923.

Originally, the post office used postage stamps of France, but these were denominated in centimes and francs instead of the local piasters, so beginning in 1885, some French stamps were surcharged in piasters, at a rate of four piasters to the franc.

Beginning in 1902, stamps of the Blanc, Mouchon and Merson series were issued with the inscription &quot;LEVANT&quot;, both as centime/franc, and with higher values surcharged in piasters. In 1905, 15c stamps in Beirut were surcharged with &quot;1 Piastre / Beyrouth&quot;.

World War I forced the closure of all the post offices on 13 October 1914. After the war, only the office in Istanbul reopened, operating from August 1921 to July 1923. Stamps of France were again surcharged, with values from 30 paras to 75 piasters.

<text>Sayyid Kāẓim bin Qāsim al-Ḥusaynī ar-Rashtī (; 1793–1843), mostly known as Siyyid Kázim Rashtí (), was the son of Siyyid Qasim of Rasht, a town in northern Iran. He was appointed as the successor of Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsa&#x27;i, and led the Shaykhí movement until his death.

He came from a family of well known merchants. He was a Shaykhi scholar who told his students about the coming of the Mahdi and the &quot;Masih&quot; (the return of Christ) and taught them how to recognize them. After his death in 1843, many of his students spread out around Asia, Europe and Africa for the search.

Upon his death he was buried near the tomb of Imam Hossein in Karbala.

==Works==

===Sharh al-qasída al-lámíya===

One of Siyyid Kazim&#x27;s most important works is a 16,000 verse commentary on an Arabic ode. The text itself has not much to do with the actual content of the poem. The commentary is well known for Kazim&#x27;s depiction of the many levels, regions and inhabitants of the spiritual universe depicted as a &quot;multi-faceted celestial, cosmic city&quot;. It also includes discussion surrounding &quot;the curtain of the city of knowledge&quot; and its symbolism, the inception of an era of spirituality and &quot;inward realities&quot; as opposed to the &quot;outward observances&quot; and laws of the past, allusions to the significance of the word Baha (Splendour/Glory), as well as interpretations of Noah&#x27;s Ark and the light verse.

==Successorship==
On the death of Siyyid Kazim on 31 December 1843, some Shaykhis went on to become Babis, some of whom later became Baháʼís, and the rest split into three factions. Baháʼí sources claim that Ḥájí Mírzá Muḥammad-Karím Khán-i-Kirmání declared himself as the successor to Siyyid Káẓim.

It is also reported in the Baháʼí sources that before dying, instead of appointing a successor, he sent his out to find the Promised One. One of his most noted followers, Mullá Husayn said:
:&quot;Our departed teacher insistently exhorted us to forsake our homes, to scatter far and wide, in quest of the promised Beloved... Regarding the features of the Promised One, he told us that He is of a pure lineage, is of illustrious descent, and of the seed of Fatimah. As to His age, He is more than twenty and less than thirty. He is endowed with innate knowledge. He is of medium height, abstains from smoking, and is free from bodily deficiency.&quot;
::(quoted in Nabil-i-Aʻzam&#x27;s &quot;The Dawn-Breakers&quot;, or &quot;Nabil&#x27;s Narrative&quot;, translated by Shoghi Effendi, p. 57)&quot;

In 1844 Mullá Husayn, after meeting the Siyyid ʻAlí-Muhammad (the Báb) in Shiraz accepted him as the Mahdi.

===The Báb&#x27;s relationship to Sayyid Káẓim===
The Shaykhis had previously met Siyyid ʻAlí-Muhammad in Karbila&#x27; when he attended the meetings of Sayyid Káẓim. There is disagreement over the amount of time Sayyid Mírzá ʻAlí-Muhammad stayed in Karbila&#x27; and the frequency of his attending Sayyid Káẓim&#x27;s lectures; Baháʼí sources state that the Báb only occasionally attended the meetings, while sources more critical to the Baháʼí Faith state that he stayed in Karbila for a year or two and learned the Shaykhi teachings. In the Bab&#x27;s own writings, however, he refers to the Shaykhi leader as his teacher. Some statements include:

*E.G. Browne wrote that the Báb was in Karbila for two months meeting Siyyid Kazim occasionally:
*:&quot;He [the Báb] proceeded at some time antecedent to the year A.H. 1259 (in which year Siyyid Kázim died) to Karbilá, where he resided for some time (two months, according to the Táríkh-i-Jadíd), occasionally attending the lectures of Hájí Siyyid Kázim of Resht&quot;
*::(E.G. Browne, Notes in the Traveller&#x27;s Narrative) 
::&quot;One day the circle of those who sat at the feet of Seyyid Kázim was augmented by a fresh arrival. The newcomer, who took his seat modestly by the door in the lowest place, was none other than Mírzá &#x27;Alí Muhammad, who, impelled by a pious desire to visit the Holy Shrines, had left his business at Bushire to come to Kerbelá. During the next few months the face of the young Shírází became familiar to all the disciples of Siyyid Kázim, and the teacher himself did not fail to notice and appreciate the earnest but modest demeanour of the youthful stranger.&quot;
:::(Babism by E G Browne in Religious Systems of the World, pp. 335).
*Baháʼí sources state that the Báb went on pilgrimage to Iraq for 7 months, to the cities of Najaf and Karbila. But they deny that a close bond developed with Sayyid Kázim.
*:&quot;According to Mírzá Abu&#x27;l-Faḍl of Gulpaygan, He journeyed to the holy cities of &#x27;Iraq in the spring of 1841, stayed in &#x27;Iraq for nearly seven months and returned to His &#x27;native province of Fars&#x27; in the autumn of that year.
*:&quot;While in Karbila the Bab visited Siyyid Kazim-i-Rashti and attended his discourses. But these occasional visits did not and could not make Him a pupil or disciple of Sayyid Kazim. His adversaries have alleged that He sat at the feet of Siyyid Kazim for months on end to learn from him.&quot;
*::(H.M. Balyuzi, &quot;The Bab – The Herald of the Day of Days&quot;, p. 41)
*Amanat presents arguments for and against the Bab being a student of Siyyid Kazim (p140-1). On the one hand Mulla Sadiq Muqaddas states that &quot;...Mir Ali Muhammad Shirazi [the Bab]...is a student of Sayyid Kazim...&quot; and that he (Muqaddas) was introduced to Siyyid Kazim by the Bab. On the other hand, another contemporary, Qatil Karbala&#x27;i, who later became a Babi, states that the Bab attended Sayyid Kazim&#x27;s lectures only two or three times. Amanat argues that the Bab was not in Karbala long enough to fully grasp Siyyid Kazim&#x27;s teachings; in fact, Muqaddas himself states that once in Karbala, he was asked to teach the Bab, and that he was also determined to convert the Bab to Shaykhism. Amanat asserts that the Bab&#x27;s reference to Siyyid Kazim as &quot;the revered scholar and my intimate teacher&quot; is a symbolic acknowledgement of their spiritual affinity and not a literal fact.
*ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá&#x27;s wife, Munirih Khanum quotes in her biography her uncle stating:
*:&quot;We had often heard in the course of his lectures Haji Siyyid Kazem stating the fact, that the day of the Manifestation was drawing nigh. He admonished us at all times that we must be searching, and be in a state of quest, because the Promised One was living amongst the people, was associating with them; but unfortunately the people were veiled and lived in a state of negligence.
*:When we saw the Bab standing with such humility before the Shrine of Imam Hossein, we often wondered if perhaps, he was not the invisible Promised One, who had come to visit the Shrine of his ancestors.
*:During his seclusion in Karbila, he attended now and then the classes of Haji Siyyid Kasem, with a shining and luminous countenance. Whenever he entered the class, Haji Siyyid Kasem would show him the greatest respect and honor.&quot;
*::(Munirih Khanum quoting her uncle, found in &quot;Episodes in the Life of Moneereh Khanum&quot;, pp. 11–12)
*In one of the Báb&#x27;s earliest writings, the &quot;Risala fi&#x27;l-Suluk&quot;, or &quot;Treatise on Spiritual Wayfaring,&quot; he mentions the Shaykhi leader by name and refers to him as &quot;my master, my support, my teacher, the pilgrim Siyyid Kazim al-Rashti.&quot;

<doc id="342684" wikidata="Q849335" url="?curid=342684" title="Inclusion–exclusion principle">
<text>In combinatorics, the inclusion–exclusion principle is a counting technique which generalizes the familiar method of obtaining the number of elements in the union of two finite sets; symbolically expressed as
:formula_1
where &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are two finite sets and |&quot;S&quot;| indicates the cardinality of a set &quot;S&quot; (which may be considered as the number of elements of the set, if the set is finite). The formula expresses the fact that the sum of the sizes of the two sets may be too large since some elements may be counted twice. The double-counted elements are those in the intersection of the two sets and the count is corrected by subtracting the size of the intersection.

The inclusion-exclusion principle, being a generalization of the two-set case, is perhaps more clearly seen in the case of three sets, which for the sets &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; is given by 
:formula_2
This formula can be verified by counting how many times each region in the Venn diagram figure is included in the right-hand side of the formula. In this case, when removing the contributions of over-counted elements, the number of elements in the mutual intersection of the three sets has been subtracted too often, so must be added back in to get the correct total.

Generalizing the results of these examples gives the principle of inclusion–exclusion. To find the cardinality of the union of sets:

# Include the cardinalities of the sets.
# Exclude the cardinalities of the pairwise intersections.
# Include the cardinalities of the triple-wise intersections.
# Exclude the cardinalities of the quadruple-wise intersections.
# Include the cardinalities of the quintuple-wise intersections.
# Continue, until the cardinality of the -tuple-wise intersection is included (if is odd) or excluded ( even).

The name comes from the idea that the principle is based on over-generous &quot;inclusion&quot;, followed by compensating &quot;exclusion&quot;.
This concept is attributed to Abraham de Moivre (1718), although it first appears in a paper of Daniel da Silva (1854) and later in a paper by J. J. Sylvester (1883). Sometimes the principle is referred to as the formula of Da Silva or Sylvester, due to these publications. The principle can be viewed as an example of the sieve method extensively used in number theory and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;sieve formula&quot;.

As finite probabilities are computed as counts relative to the cardinality of the probability space, the formulas for the principle of inclusion–exclusion remain valid when the cardinalities of the sets are replaced by finite probabilities. More generally, both versions of the principle can be put under the common umbrella of measure theory.

In a very abstract setting, the principle of inclusion–exclusion can be expressed as the calculation of the inverse of a certain matrix. This inverse has a special structure, making the principle an extremely valuable technique in combinatorics and related areas of mathematics. As Gian-Carlo Rota put it:

&quot;One of the most useful principles of enumeration in discrete probability and combinatorial theory is the celebrated principle of inclusion–exclusion. When skillfully applied, this principle has yielded the solution to many a combinatorial problem.&quot;

==Formula==
In its general formula, the principle of inclusion–exclusion states that for finite sets , one has the identity

This can be compactly written as

:formula_3

or

:formula_4 of () in case formula_5 is a set.

==Applications==

The inclusion–exclusion principle is widely used and only a few of its applications can be mentioned here.

===Counting derangements===

A well-known application of the inclusion–exclusion principle is to the combinatorial problem of counting all derangements of a finite set. A &quot;derangement&quot; of a set &quot;A&quot; is a bijection from &quot;A&quot; into itself that has no fixed points. Via the inclusion–exclusion principle one can show that if the cardinality of &quot;A&quot; is &quot;n&quot;, then the number of derangements is [&quot;n&quot;! / &quot;e&quot;] where [&quot;x&quot;] denotes the nearest integer to &quot;x&quot;; a detailed proof is available here and also see the examples section above.

The first occurrence of the problem of counting the number of derangements is in an early book on games of chance: &quot;Essai d&#x27;analyse sur les jeux de hazard&quot; by P. R. de Montmort (1678 – 1719) and was known as either &quot;Montmort&#x27;s problem&quot; or by the name he gave it, &quot;&quot;problème des rencontres&quot;.&quot; The problem is also known as the &quot;hatcheck problem.&quot;

The number of derangements is also known as the subfactorial of &quot;n&quot;, written !&quot;n&quot;. It follows that if all bijections are assigned the same probability then the probability that a random bijection is a derangement quickly approaches 1/&quot;e&quot; as &quot;n&quot; grows.

===Counting intersections===
The principle of inclusion–exclusion, combined with De Morgan&#x27;s law, can be used to count the cardinality of the intersection of sets as well. Let formula_6 represent the complement of &quot;Ak&quot; with respect to some universal set &quot;A&quot; such that formula_7 for each &quot;k&quot;. Then we have

:formula_8

thereby turning the problem of finding an intersection into the problem of finding a union.

===Graph coloring===
The inclusion exclusion principle forms the basis of algorithms for a number of NP-hard graph partitioning problems, such as graph coloring.

A well known application of the principle is the construction of the chromatic polynomial of a graph.

===Bipartite graph perfect matchings===
The number of perfect matchings of a bipartite graph can be calculated using the principle.

===Number of onto functions===
Given finite sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, how many surjective functions (onto functions) are there from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;? Without any loss of generality we may take &quot;A&quot; = {1, ..., &quot;k&quot;} and &quot;B&quot; = {1, ..., &quot;n&quot;}, since only the cardinalities of the sets matter. By using &quot;S&quot; as the set of all functions from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;, and defining, for each &quot;i&quot; in &quot;B&quot;, the property &quot;Pi&quot; as &quot;the function misses the element &quot;i&quot; in &quot;B&quot;&quot; (&quot;i&quot; is not in the image of the function), the principle of inclusion–exclusion gives the number of onto functions between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; as:

:formula_9

===Permutations with forbidden positions===
A permutation of the set &quot;S&quot; = {1, ..., &quot;n&quot;} where each element of &quot;S&quot; is restricted to not being in certain positions (here the permutation is considered as an ordering of the elements of &quot;S&quot;) is called a &quot;permutation with forbidden positions&quot;. For example, with &quot;S&quot; = {1,2,3,4}, the permutations with the restriction that the element 1 can not be in positions 1 or 3, and the element 2 can not be in position 4 are: 2134, 2143, 3124, 4123, 2341, 2431, 3241, 3421, 4231 and 4321. By letting &quot;Ai&quot; be the set of positions that the element &quot;i&quot; is not allowed to be in, and the property &quot;P&quot;&quot;i&quot; to be the property that a permutation puts element &quot;i&quot; into a position in &quot;Ai&quot;, the principle of inclusion–exclusion can be used to count the number of permutations which satisfy all the restrictions.

In the given example, there are 12 = 2(3!) permutations with property &quot;P&quot;1, 6 = 3! permutations with property &quot;P&quot;2 and no permutations have properties &quot;P&quot;3 or &quot;P&quot;4 as there are no restrictions for these two elements. The number of permutations satisfying the restrictions is thus:

:4! − (12 + 6 + 0 + 0) + (4) = 24 − 18 + 4 = 10.

The final 4 in this computation is the number of permutations having both properties &quot;P&quot;1 and &quot;P&quot;2. There are no other non-zero contributions to the formula.

===Stirling numbers of the second kind===
The Stirling numbers of the second kind, &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) count the number of partitions of a set of &quot;n&quot; elements into &quot;k&quot; non-empty subsets (indistinguishable &quot;boxes&quot;). An explicit formula for them can be obtained by applying the principle of inclusion–exclusion to a very closely related problem, namely, counting the number of partitions of an &quot;n&quot;-set into &quot;k&quot; non-empty but distinguishable boxes (ordered non-empty subsets). Using the universal set consisting of all partitions of the &quot;n&quot;-set into &quot;k&quot; (possibly empty) distinguishable boxes, &quot;A&quot;1, &quot;A&quot;2, ..., &quot;Ak&quot;, and the properties &quot;Pi&quot; meaning that the partition has box &quot;Ai&quot; empty, the principle of inclusion–exclusion gives an answer for the related result. Dividing by &quot;k&quot;! to remove the artificial ordering gives the Stirling number of the second kind:

:formula_10

===Rook polynomials===
A rook polynomial is the generating function of the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a &quot;board B&quot; that looks like a subset of the squares of a checkerboard; that is, no two rooks may be in the same row or column. The board &quot;B&quot; is any subset of the squares of a rectangular board with &quot;n&quot; rows and &quot;m&quot; columns; we think of it as the squares in which one is allowed to put a rook. The coefficient, &quot;rk&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) of &quot;xk&quot; in the rook polynomial &quot;RB&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the number of ways &quot;k&quot; rooks, none of which attacks another, can be arranged in the squares of &quot;B&quot;. For any board &quot;B&quot;, there is a complementary board formula_11 consisting of the squares of the rectangular board that are not in &quot;B&quot;. This complementary board also has a rook polynomial formula_12 with coefficients formula_13

It is sometimes convenient to be able to calculate the highest coefficient of a rook polynomial in terms of the coefficients of the rook polynomial of the complementary board. Without loss of generality we can assume that &quot;n&quot; ≤ &quot;m&quot;, so this coefficient is &quot;rn&quot;(&quot;B&quot;). The number of ways to place &quot;n&quot; non-attacking rooks on the complete &quot;n&quot; × &quot;m&quot; &quot;checkerboard&quot; (without regard as to whether the rooks are placed in the squares of the board &quot;B&quot;) is given by the falling factorial:

:formula_14

Letting &quot;P&quot;i be the property that an assignment of &quot;n&quot; non-attacking rooks on the complete board has a rook in column &quot;i&quot; which is not in a square of the board &quot;B&quot;, then by the principle of inclusion–exclusion we have:

:formula_15

===Euler&#x27;s phi function===
Euler&#x27;s totient or phi function, &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is an arithmetic function that counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to &quot;n&quot; that are relatively prime to &quot;n&quot;. That is, if &quot;n&quot; is a positive integer, then φ(&quot;n&quot;) is the number of integers &quot;k&quot; in the range 1 ≤ &quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot; which have no common factor with &quot;n&quot; other than 1. The principle of inclusion–exclusion is used to obtain a formula for φ(&quot;n&quot;). Let &quot;S&quot; be the set {1, ..., &quot;n&quot;} and define the property &quot;Pi&quot; to be that a number in &quot;S&quot; is divisible by the prime number &quot;pi&quot;, for 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;r&quot;, where the prime factorization of

Then,

===Dirichlet hyperbola method===


The Dirichlet hyperbola method re-expresses a sum of a multiplicative function formula_18 by selecting a suitable Dirichlet convolution formula_19, recognizing that the sum

: formula_20

can be recast as a sum over the lattice points in a region bounded by formula_21, formula_22, and formula_23, splitting this region into two overlapping subregions, and finally using the inclusion–exclusion principle to conclude that

: formula_24

==Diluted inclusion–exclusion principle==
In many cases where the principle could give an exact formula (in particular, counting prime numbers using the sieve of Eratosthenes), the formula arising does not offer useful content because the number of terms in it is excessive. If each term individually can be estimated accurately, the accumulation of errors may imply that the inclusion–exclusion formula is not directly applicable. In number theory, this difficulty was addressed by Viggo Brun. After a slow start, his ideas were taken up by others, and a large variety of sieve methods developed. These for example may try to find upper bounds for the &quot;sieved&quot; sets, rather than an exact formula.

Let &quot;A&quot;1, ..., &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; be arbitrary sets and &quot;p&quot;1, ..., &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; real numbers in the closed unit interval . Then, for every even number &quot;k&quot; in {0, ..., &quot;n&quot;}, the indicator functions satisfy the inequality:

: formula_25

==Proof of main statement==

Choose an element contained in the union of all sets and let formula_26 be the individual sets containing it. (Note that &quot;t&quot; &gt; 0.) Since the element is counted precisely once by the left-hand side of equation (), we need to show that it is counted precisely once by the right-hand side. On the right-hand side, the only non-zero contributions occur when all the subsets in a particular term contain the chosen element, that is, all the subsets are selected from formula_26. The contribution is one for each of these sets (plus or minus depending on the term) and therefore is just the (signed) number of these subsets used in the term. We then have: 

:formula_28

By the binomial theorem,

:formula_29

Using the fact that formula_30 and rearranging terms, we have

:formula_31

and so, the chosen element is counted only once by the right-hand side of equation ().

===Algebraic proof===
An algebraic proof can be obtained using indicator functions (also known as characteristic functions). The indicator function of a subset &quot;S&quot; of a set &quot;X&quot; is the function 

:formula_32

If formula_33 and formula_34 are two subsets of formula_35, then 

:formula_36

Let &quot;A&quot; denote the union formula_37 of the sets &quot;A&quot;1, ..., &quot;An&quot;. To prove the inclusion–exclusion principle in general, we first verify the identity

for indicator functions, where:

:formula_38

The following function

:formula_39

is identically zero because: if &quot;x&quot; is not in &quot;A&quot;, then all factors are 0−0 = 0; and otherwise, if &quot;x&quot; does belong to some &quot;Am&quot;, then the corresponding &quot;m&quot;th factor is 1−1=0. By expanding the product on the left-hand side, equation () follows.

To prove the inclusion–exclusion principle for the cardinality of sets, sum the equation () over all &quot;x&quot; in the union of &quot;A&quot;1, ..., &quot;An&quot;. To derive the version used in probability, take the expectation in (). In general, integrate the equation () with respect to &quot;μ&quot;. Always use linearity in these derivations.

<text>The French post offices abroad were a global network of post offices in foreign countries established by France to provide mail service where the local services were deemed unsafe or unreliable. They were generally set up in cities with some sort of French commercial interest.

They started appearing in the early 19th century, reached their heyday at the beginning of the 20th century, then started closing down in the 1910s and 1920s, with the office at Kwangchou in China holding out until the 1940s.

Offices abroad:
* French post offices in China
* French post offices in Crete
* French post offices in Egypt
* French post offices in the Ottoman Empire
* French post offices in Zanzibar

<doc id="342691" wikidata="Q3081812" url="?curid=342691" title="Operation Alphabet">
<text>Operation Alphabet was an evacuation, authorised on 24 May 1940, of Allied (British, French and Polish) troops from the harbour of Narvik in northern Norway marking the success of Operation Weserübung (the German invasion of 9 April) and the end of the Allied campaign in Norway during World War II. The evacuation was completed by 8 June.

The evacuation was prompted by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;″s assault on Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and France in the spring of 1940, which reduced the relative importance of Germany&#x27;s iron ore provision and of Scandinavia. Several nights after the final military evacuation, the civilians of the town were rescued by British Sub-Lieutenant Patrick Dalzel-Job. Against orders, he organised local fishing boats to remove the population just before a German reprisal bombing. Much of the town was destroyed but only four people were killed. The Royal Navy wanted to discipline Dalzel-Job but was unable to, after King Haakon VII awarded him the Knights Cross of the Order of Saint Olav (First Class). Later in the war, he served with Ian Fleming. Many sources cite Dalzel-Job as the inspiration for the James Bond character.

A consequence of the evacuation of Allied troops from Norway was that Sweden&#x27;s and Finland&#x27;s position &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; Nazi Germany was weakened. An agreement was reached in June leading to extensive transfers of (unarmed) Wehrmacht troops on Swedish railways – probably Sweden&#x27;s chief digression from her policy of neutrality between the parties of the war – and in August Finland concluded a secret agreement according to which Finland could acquire weapons through Germany and Germany could transfer (armed) troops by truck through northernmost Finland. Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, still united by the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, had excluded other international powers from influence in Northern Europe.

<doc id="342692" wikidata="Q229599" url="?curid=342692" title="Charlie's Angels (2000 film)">
<text>Charlie&#x27;s Angels is a 2000 American spy action comedy film directed by McG in his feature film directorial debut, and written by Ryan Rowe, Ed Solomon, and John August. It is the first film in the &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; trilogy, a continuation of the television series of the same name created by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts. Unlike the original series, the film features more comic elements.

The movie stars Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu as three women working in a private detective agency in Los Angeles. John Forsythe reprised his role as the unseen Charlie&#x27;s voice from the original series. Bill Murray also stars as John Bosley, replacing David Doyle who played the role in the original series. It also stars Sam Rockwell, Tim Curry and Kelly Lynch while Crispin Glover, Matt LeBlanc, Luke Wilson and Tom Green appear in supporting roles.

The film was released on November 3, 2000, in the United States by Sony Pictures Releasing under its Columbia Pictures label, and grossed $264.1 million worldwide. The film received mixed reviews from critics.

==Plot==
Natalie Cook, Dylan Sanders, and Alex Munday are the &quot;Angels&quot;, three women who work as private investigators together for unseen millionaire Charlie Townsend. Charlie uses speakers in his offices to communicate with the Angels, and his assistant Bosley works with them directly when needed.

Charlie assigns the Angels to find Eric Knox, a software genius who created a revolutionary voice-recognition system and heads his own company, Knox Enterprises. He is believed to have been kidnapped by Roger Corwin, who runs the communications-satellite company Redstar.

The Angels infiltrate a party held by Corwin, spotting a suspicious-looking man that they had previously seen from surveillance videos of Knox&#x27;s kidnapping. Dubbing him the &quot;Thin Man&quot;, the Angels chase him down and fight him; he gets away, but the Angels find Knox, safely tied up nearby.

After the Angels reunite Knox with his business partner Vivian Wood, Charlie explains that they must determine whether the Thin Man has stolen Knox&#x27;s voice-recognition software. The Angels infiltrate Redstar headquarters, fool the security system, and plant a device in the central computer to enable them to explore it remotely. They retire for the night after giving Bosley the laptop computer that communicates with the Redstar computer.

Dylan takes up Knox&#x27;s offer to spend the night with him, and they end up having sex. Afterwards, he betrays her; simultaneously, attacks are made on Natalie and Alex, Bosley is captured by Vivian, and Corwin is murdered by the Thin Man. Knox tells Dylan his kidnapping was faked to get the Angels to help him access the Redstar satellite network. He plans to use it along with his voice recognition software to find and kill Charlie, who Knox asserts killed his father in the Vietnam War.

Dylan escapes and reunites with Natalie and Alex, who also survived their attacks. They approach Charlie&#x27;s office just as the building explodes. They find a radio receiver that Bosley is able to communicate through via a tooth implanted radio transmitter. He provides enough information of where he is being held captive to allow Natalie to deduce his location, an abandoned lighthouse. With help from Dylan&#x27;s friend Chad, the Angels stealthily approach by boat. Upon finding Knox, Dylan is captured by his henchmen, tied up and gagged.

The Angels are too late to stop Knox from determining Charlie&#x27;s location, though they rescue Bosley while Dylan fights off her captors. They come together to defeat Vivian, the Thin Man, and other assorted henchmen, but Knox blows up the lighthouse and flies off in an attack helicopter towards Charlie&#x27;s house. Bosley helps the Angels board it, where Alex reprograms the missile to have it shoot backwards; blowing up the helicopter and killing Knox while the Angels land safely.

Seeing the opportunity to finally meet Charlie in person, the Angels enter the nearby beach house that Knox had targeted, but he has already left. He remotely congratulates them on a job well done through another speaker, and treats them and Bosley to a vacation. Charlie also tells them that Knox&#x27;s father was an undercover double agent; he was discovered and killed by the enemy, but not by him.

When he speaks to the Angels by telephone on the beach, they ask if they could ever meet him in person. Dylan suspects she sees him nearby talking into a cell phone, but does not tell the group; opting to raise a toast to Charlie instead. Bosley playfully douses the Angels with his drink, and they chase him towards the ocean. From afar, a silhouetted Charlie watches them and walks off.

== Production ==
According to Thandiwe Newton, she was the original choice for Alex Munday, but declined as she did not want to be &quot;objectified&quot; or play racial stereotypes. The role ultimately went to Lucy Liu. McG would later say that Bill Murray headbutted him while filming. Murray would later denied this calling it &quot;bullshit&quot;.

Other actresses who were considered for the role of Alex include Jenifer Lopez, Angelina Jolie, and Selma Hayek. R&amp;B Singer and actress Aaliyah was also considered for the role of Alex, but was deemed too young at the time, while actress Nia Long, was deemed &quot;too old&quot; looking.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened on November 3, 2000, earning $13.7 million in its opening day, debuting at the top of the box office. For its first weekend, the film grossed $40.1 million, dethroning &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;, which had stayed at number-one for four weeks. Eventually, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; grossed a total of $125,305,545 domestically.

Against a budget of $93 million, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; grossed $125.3 million in North America and $148.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $264.1 million, making it the 12th highest-grossing film of 2000.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 68% approval rating based on 146 reviews, with an average rating of 6.20/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Mixing tongue-in-cheek cheesecake with glossy action set pieces, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; is slick and reasonably fun despite its lack of originality&quot;. On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score, it has a score of 52 out of 100 based on reviews from 34 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

David Edelstein for &quot;Slate&quot;, wrote, despite expecting to hate the film, he found he loved it, calling it &quot;a charming, hyper-energetic, and wittily self-aware action comedy about gorgeous girls&quot;. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B grade, with particular praise for Cameron Diaz&#x27;s performance, saying &quot;not just an Angel – that&#x27;s a star&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the film a &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; and praised the wire work and fight choreography of Cheung-Yan Yuen. Travers was critical of the thin plot but said it is &quot;the film&#x27;s quirky sense of mischief, which sets it apart&quot; from lesser television to film adaptations. Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said &quot;the gals are fab. And so&#x27;s the movie&quot;. He expressed mild disappointment at the men, commenting that Murray is funnier than the role written for him, and that even though Tom Green &quot;does his weirdest best&quot; he is only mildly amusing. In &quot;Variety&quot;, Todd McCarthy wrote of Diaz&#x27; performance, &quot;Rarely has a performer conveyed the impression of being so happy to be in a particular movie.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called it &quot;a movie without a brain. &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; is like the trailer for a video game movie, lacking only the video game, and the movie&quot; and gave it half a star out of a possible 4 stars. Manohla Dargis wrote: &quot;Of course, it&#x27;s terrible – but did it have to be this bad?&quot;
Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;an utter debacle&quot; and said the film &quot;makes the show look like the height of creativity, imagination and restraint&quot;. LaSalle blames director McG comparing the film to a trailer or music video. He was also critical of the deliberate decision to make the three women very similar, and says &quot;the Angels&#x27; goofiness is a big disappointment, second only to the shocking ineptitude of McG&quot;.
=== Other responses ===
During the making of &quot;Blade II&quot;, Guillermo del Toro commented that while films like &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; had helped to popularize the wire fu style of fighting choreography in Western films, they also served as a &quot;nail in the coffin&quot; and prompted many filmmakers to want to get back to more &quot;hard-hitting&quot; action. In his commentary: &quot;The moment you see Cameron Diaz flying in the air, and you &quot;know&quot; that she is incapable of flying in the air and kicking five guys... you realize that it is done using wires. [...] I mean, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; was great, but it[s fighting style] was almost satirical&quot;.

==Home media==

==Sequels==

A sequel called &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; released in 2003. Diaz, Barrymore and Liu reprised their roles, as did John Forsythe as the voice of Charlie in his last film role. Following Murray&#x27;s departure from the franchise, Bernie Mac joined the cast as Jimmy Bosley, John&#x27;s adoptive brother, while Demi Moore had a major role, and Jaclyn Smith reprised her role as Kelly Garrett from the original television series. The franchise was confirmed for a third and fourth film, but in 2004, the ideas were cancelled.

In 2015, Sony began development on a new &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; installment. Elizabeth Banks directed and produced the film with her producing partner and husband Max Handelman. Initially developed as a reboot of the franchise, the film is a continuation of the original TV series and the McG-directed 2000s films.

The 2019 follow-up film starred Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska as the new generation of Angels. Banks and Djimon Hounsou also starred as Charlie&#x27;s assistants, known as Bosleys, while Patrick Stewart replaced Murray in the role of John Bosley. Jaclyn Smith reprised her role as Kelly Garrett for the second time for a cameo appearance. It was also the first installment to feature Robert Clotworthy as the voice of Charlie, replacing Forsythe following his death in 2010.

<text>A desk or bureau is a piece of furniture with a flat table-style work surface used in a school, office, home or the like for academic, professional or domestic activities such as reading, writing, or using equipment such as a computer. Desks often have one or more drawers, compartments, or pigeonholes to store items such as office supplies and papers. Desks are usually made of wood or metal, although materials such as glass are sometimes seen.

Some desks have the form of a table, although usually only one side of a desk is suitable to sit at (there are some exceptions, such as a partners desk) Some desks do not have the form of a table, for instance, an armoire desk is a desk built within a large wardrobe-like cabinet, and a portable desk is light enough to be placed on a person&#x27;s lap. Since many people lean on a desk while using it, a desk must be sturdy. In most cases, people sit at a desk, either on a separate chair or a built-in chair (e.g., in some school desks). Some people use standing desks to be able to stand while using them.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;desk&quot; originated from the Modern Latin word &quot;desca&quot; &quot;table to write on&quot;, from the mid 14th century. It is a modification of the Old Italian &quot;desco&quot; &quot;table&quot;, from Latin &quot;discus&quot; &quot;dish&quot; or &quot;disc&quot;. The word desk has been used figuratively since 1797. A desk may also be known as a bureau, counter, davenport, escritoire, lectern, reading stand, rolltop desk, school desk, workspace, or writing desk.

==History==

Desk-style furniture appears not to have been used in classical antiquity or in other ancient centers of literate civilization in the Middle East or Far East, but there is no specific proof. Medieval illustrations show the first pieces of furniture which seem to have been designed and constructed for reading and writing. Before the invention of the movable type printing press in the 15th century, any reader was potentially a writer or publisher or both, since any book or other document had to be copied by hand. The desks were designed with slots and hooks for bookmarks and for writing implements. Since manuscript volumes were sometimes large and heavy, desks of the period usually had massive structures.
Desks of the Renaissance and later eras had relatively slimmer structures, and more and more drawers were added as woodworking became more precise and cabinet-making became a distinct trade. It is often possible to find out if a table or other piece of furniture of those times was designed to be used as a desk, by looking for a drawer with three small separations (one each for the ink pot, the blotter and the powder tray) and storage for pens.

The basic desk forms were developed mostly in the 17th and 18th centuries. The modern ergonomic desk is a refinement of the mechanically complex drawing table or drafting table from the end of the 18th century.

==Industrial era==

Refinements to the first desk forms were considerable through the 19th century, as steam-driven machinery made cheap wood-pulp paper possible towards the end of the first phase of the Industrial Revolution. This allowed an increase in the number of the white-collar workers. As these office workers grew in number, desks were mass-produced for them in large quantities, using newer, steam-driven woodworking machinery. This was the first sharp division in desk manufacturing. From then on, limited quantities of finely crafted desks have been continued to be constructed by master cabinetmakers for the homes and offices of the rich, while the vast majority of desks were assembled rapidly by unskilled labor from components turned out in batches by machine tools. Thus, age alone does not guarantee that an antique desk is a masterpiece, since this split in quality took place more than a hundred years ago.

More paper and correspondence drove the need for more complex desks and more specialized desks, such as the rolltop desk which was a mass-produced, slatted variant of the classical cylinder desk. It provided a relatively fast and cheap way to lock up the ever increasing flow of paperwork without having to file everything by the end of the day. Paper documents became voluminous enough to be stored separately in filing cabinets. Correspondence and other documents were now too numerous to get enough attention to be rolled up or folded again, then summarized and tagged before being pigeonholed in a small compartment over or under the work surface of the desk. The famous Wooton desk and others were the last manifestations of the &quot;pigeonhole&quot; style. The surfaces of some newer desks could be transformed into many different shapes and angles, and were ideal for artists, draftsmen, and engineers.

==Steel versions==
A small boom in office work and desk production occurred at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th with the introduction of smaller and less expensive electrical presses and efficient carbon paper coupled with the general acceptance of the typewriter. Steel desks were introduced to take heavier loads of paper and withstand the pounding meted out on the typewriters. This also gave rise to the &quot;typewriter desk&quot;, a platform, sometimes on wheels and with expandable surface via flaps, that was built to a specific height to make typing easier and more comfortable than when using a standard or traditional desk. The L-shaped desk also became popular, with the &quot;leg&quot; being used as an annex for the typewriter.

Another big expansion occurred after the Second World War with the spread of photocopying. Paperwork further increased the number of desk workers, whose work surfaces diminished in size as office rents rose, and the paper itself was moved more and more directly to filing cabinets or sent to specialized records management centers, or transformed into microfilm, or both. Modular desks seating several co-workers close by became common. Even executive or management desks became mass-produced, built of cheap plywood or fiberboard covered with wood finish, as the number of people managing the white collar workers became even greater.

==Student models==
A student desk can be any desk form meant for use by an enrollee in elementary, secondary or postsecondary education. Anna Breadin designed and patented a one-piece school desk in the late 1880s that was built with a table section attached in front of a wooden seat and back rest. Before this, most students in America sat either on chairs or long benches at long tables.
In homes, the term &quot;student desk&quot; designates a small pedestal desk, or writing table constructed for use by a teenager or a pre-teen in their room. It often is a pedestal desk, with only one of the two pedestals and about two-thirds of the desk surface. Such desks are sometimes called &quot;left-pedestal desks&quot; and &quot;right-pedestal desks&quot;, depending on the position of the single pedestal. These desks are not as tall as normal adult desks. In some cases, the desk is connected from the seat to the table.

The desks are usually mass-produced in steel or wood and sold on the consumer market. There is a wide variety of plans available for woodworking enthusiasts to build their own versions. Modern mass-produced student desks are often made with laminate table tops and molded plastic seats in a combined single unit, with storage found under the desktop or on a wire shelf beneath the seat. There are many novel forms of student desks made to maximize the relatively restricted area available in a child&#x27;s room. One of the most common is the bunk-bed desk, also called the &quot;loft bed&quot;.

==Influence of computers==
Until the late 1980s, desks remained a place for paperwork and &quot;business machines&quot;, but the personal computer was taking hold in large and medium-sized businesses. New office suites included a &quot;knee hole&quot; credenza which was a place for a terminal or personal computer and keyboard tray. Soon, new office designs also included &quot;U-shape&quot; suites which added a bridge worksurface between the back credenza and front desk. During the North American recession of the early 1990s, many managers and executive workers were required to do word processing and other functions previously completed by typing pools and secretaries. This necessitated a more central placement of the computer on these &quot;U-shape&quot; suite desk systems.

With computers more prevalent, &quot;computer paper&quot; became an office supply. The beginning of this paper boom gave birth to the dream of the &quot;paperless office&quot;, in which all information would only appear on computer monitors. However, the ease of printing personal documents and the lack of comfort with reading text on computer monitors led to a great deal of document printing. The need for paperwork space vied with the increased desk space taken up by computer monitors, computers, printers, scanners, and other peripherals. The need for more space led some desk companies to attach some accessory items to the modesty panel at the back of the desk, such as outlet strips and cable management, in an attempt to clear the desktop of electrical clutter.

Through the &quot;tech boom&quot; of the 1990s, office worker numbers increased along with the cost of office space rent. The cubicle desk became widely accepted in North America as an economical way of squeezing more desk workers into the same space, without further shrinking the size of their cramped working surfaces. The cubicle walls have become a new place for workers to affix papers and other items once left on the horizontal desktop surface. Even computer monitor bezels themselves were used to attach reminder notes and business cards.

Early in the 2000s, private office workers found that their side and back computer-placing furniture made it hard to show the contents of a computer screen to guests or co-workers. Manufacturers have responded to this issue by creating &quot;forward facing&quot; desks where computer monitors are placed on the front of the &quot;U-shape&quot; workstation. This forward computer monitor placement promotes a clearer sight-line to greet colleagues and allows for common viewing of information displayed on a screen.

Replacement of bulky CRT monitors with flat panel LCDs freed up significant room on desktops. However, the size of displays often increased to accommodate multiple on-screen windows, to display more and more information simultaneously. The lighter weight and slimmer profile of the new displays allowed them to be mounted on flexible arms, so they could be swung into view or out of the way, and adjusted frequently as needed.

==Notable examples==
* The &quot;Resolute&quot; desk in the Oval Office has been used by many United States presidents, including John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama. It is made from the timbers of , an abandoned British ship discovered by an American vessel and returned to Queen Victoria of Great Britain as a token of friendship and goodwill. Queen Victoria commissioned the desk from William Evenden, Royal Naval Dockyard at Chatham, England, and presented it to President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1880.
* The Bureau du Roi (, &quot;the King&#x27;s desk&quot;), also known as Louis XV&#x27;s roll-top secretary (), is the richly ornamented royal cylinder desk which was constructed at the end of Louis XV&#x27;s reign, and is now again in the Palace of Versailles.
* Henry VIII&#x27;s writing desk is a portable writing desk, made in about 1525-26 for Henry VIII. It is currently in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The desk is a product of the royal workshops and is lavishly embellished with ornamental motifs introduced to the Kingdom of England by continental artists.

<text>8Ball &amp; MJG is an American hip hop duo from Orange Mound, Memphis, Tennessee. They met at Ridgeway Middle School in 1984. In 1993, the duo released their debut album &quot;Comin&#x27; Out Hard&quot;. They went on to release &quot;On the Outside Looking In&quot; (1994), &quot;On Top of the World&quot; (1995), &quot;In Our Lifetime&quot; (1999), &quot;Space Age 4 Eva&quot; (2000), &quot;Living Legends&quot; (2004), &quot;Ridin High&quot; (2007) and &quot;Ten Toes Down&quot; (2010).

==Career==
8Ball &amp; MJG first appeared on the rap scene with their underground 1991 album &quot;Listen to the Lyrics&quot;. In 1993, they released the more commercially-successful album &quot;Comin&#x27; Out Hard&quot;. Their subsequent albums in the 1990s, including 1994&#x27;s &quot;On the Outside Looking In&quot;, and 1995&#x27;s &quot;On Top of the World&quot; helped cement their status as undisputed icons of the South&#x27;s budding mainstream rap scene. &quot;On Top of the World&quot; was particularly successful, peaking at #8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and being certified gold. It contained the song &quot;Space Age Pimpin&#x27;&quot;, which was 8Ball &amp; MJG&#x27;s first single to chart, reaching #58 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart and #22 on the Hot Rap Singles chart. After those albums, both 8Ball &amp; MJG each released solo attempts, the first of which was MJG&#x27;s &quot;No More Glory&quot; in 1997, followed by 8Ball&#x27;s &quot;Lost&quot; in 1998. They reunited in 1999 to release their fourth album as a group, titled &quot;In Our Lifetime&quot;. One year later in 2000, they released their fifth group album entitled &quot;Space Age 4 Eva&quot;.

In 1996, they appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation CD, &quot;America Is Dying Slowly&quot;, alongside Biz Markie, Wu-Tang Clan, and Fat Joe, among many other prominent hip hop artists. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men, was heralded as &quot;a masterpiece&quot; by the magazine &quot;The Source&quot;. In the early 2000s, they would sign with Sean Combs&#x27; Bad Boy Records. They already had some experience with the label, being featured on the song &quot;The Player Way&quot; from Bad Boy rapper Mase&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;Harlem World&quot;. Their first album for Bad Boy Records, &quot;Living Legends&quot;, came out in 2004 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. Their second album on Bad Boy Records was titled &quot;Ridin High&quot; and was released in March 2007.

Commercially, one of the high points of 8Ball &amp; MJG&#x27;s career was their being featured on Three 6 Mafia&#x27;s hit song &quot;Stay Fly&quot; in 2005. That song peaked at #13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, which is the biggest hit of Three 6 Mafia&#x27;s career and the biggest hit for 8Ball &amp; MJG. The song was a collaboration between two of the most successful rap groups from the state of Tennessee, whence Three 6 Mafia also hail. Today, 8Ball and MJG also head their own record labels. 8Ball heads 8 Ways Entertainment (distributed by Koch Entertainment), while MJG heads MJG Muzik. On their label are the young, up and coming Memphis duo, Da Volunteers, who are widely known throughout the Southern United States for their 2006 single, &quot;What&#x27;s Yo Favorite Color?&quot;, which glorifies their neighborhood of Orange Mound.

In September 2007, 8Ball and MJG signed deals in Sacramento, California with Real Talk Entertainment. 8Ball released a group album with E.D.I. Mean of the Outlawz entitled &quot;Doin&#x27; It Big&quot; on April 1, 2008, and MJG released a solo album entitled &quot;Pimp Tight&quot; on April 29, 2008. In June 2008 the group announced that they officially signed onto T.I.&#x27;s record label Grand Hustle. Their eighth album as a group and their first on Grand Hustle, titled &quot;Ten Toes Down&quot;, was released in May 2010. It reached #36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in its first week.

<doc id="342707" wikidata="Q33732" url="?curid=342707" title="North Caucasian languages">
<text>The North Caucasian languages, sometimes called simply Caucasic, is a proposed language family consisting of a pair of well established language families spoken in the Caucasus, predominantly in the north, consisting of the Northwest Caucasian family (also called &quot;Pontic, Abkhaz–Adyghe, Circassian,&quot; or &quot;West Caucasian&quot;) and the Northeast Caucasian family (also called &quot;Nakh–Dagestanian&quot;, &quot;Caspian&quot; or &quot;East Caucasian&quot;). There are some 34 to 38 distinct North Caucasian languages.

The Kartvelian languages, including Georgian, Zan and Svan, were once known as South Caucasian. However, they are no longer considered related to the North Caucasian languages and are classified as an independent language family.

Some linguists, notably Sergei Starostin and Sergei Nikolaev, believe that the two groups sprang from a common ancestor about five thousand years BCE. However, this proposal is difficult to evaluate, and remains controversial. 

North Caucasian has also been given in an automated computational analysis (ASJP 4) by Müller et al. (2013). However, since the analysis was automatically generated, Müller et al. (2013) does not conclude whether the grouping is due to mutual lexical borrowing or genetic inheritance.

==Internal classification==
Among the linguists who support the North Caucasian hypothesis, the main split between Northeast Caucasian and Northwest Caucasian is considered uncontroversial. Problems arise when it gets to the internal structure of Northeast Caucasian itself. So far no general agreement has been reached in this respect. The following classification is based on Nikolayev &amp; Starostin (1994):
*North Caucasian
**Abkhazo-Adyghean (Northwest Caucasian)
**Nakh–Daghestanian (Northeast Caucasian)
***Nakh
***Daghestanian
****Avar–Andi–Dido
****Lak–Dargwa
****Lezgic
==Comparison of the two phyla==
The main perceived similarities between the two phyla lie in their phonological systems. However, their grammars are quite different.

===Main similarities===
Both phyla are characterised by high levels of phonetic complexity, including the widespread usage of secondary articulation. Ubykh (Northwest) has 84 consonants, and Archi (Northeast) is thought to have 76.

A list of possible cognates has been proposed. However, most of them may be loanwords or simply coincidences, since most of the morphemes in both phyla are quite short (often just a single consonant).

=== Main differences ===
The Northeast Caucasian languages are characterised by great morphological complexity in the noun. For example, in Tsez, a series of locative cases intersect with a series of suffixes designating motion with regard to the location, producing an array of 126 locative suffixes (often – depending on the analysis – described as noun cases).

By contrast, the Northwest Caucasian noun systems are relatively poor in morphology, usually distinguishing just two or three cases. However, they make up for it by possessing a very complex verbal structure: the subject, the direct object, the indirect object, benefactive objects and most local functions are expressed in the verb.

=== Some comparisons ===


==Criticism==
Not all scholars accept the unity of the North Caucasian languages, and some who do believe that the two are, or may be, related do not accept the methodology used by Nikolayev and Starostin.

<doc id="342710" wikidata="Q1137219" url="?curid=342710" title="Sherlock (software)">
<text>Sherlock, named after fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, was a file and web search tool created by Apple Inc. for the PowerPC-based &quot;classic&quot; Mac OS, introduced in 1998 with Mac OS 8.5 as an extension of the Mac OS Finder&#x27;s file searching capabilities. Like its predecessor (System 7.5’s revamped &#x27;Find File&#x27; app, adapted by Bill Monk from his &#x27;Find Pro&#x27; find program), Sherlock searched for local files and file contents on a Mac, using the same basic indexing code and search logic found in AppleSearch. Sherlock extended the system by enabling the user to search for items on the World Wide Web through a series of plug-ins, which employed existing web search engines. These plug-ins were written as plain text files, so that it was a simple task for a user to write a Sherlock plug-in.

Sherlock was replaced by Spotlight and Dashboard in 2005 with Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, although Apple continued to include it with the default installation. Since most of the standard plug-ins for Sherlock provided by Apple itself no longer function, it was officially retired and removed in the release of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard in 2007.

== Data==
The Sherlock 2 search plug-in was an SGML document, and was typically given the &quot;.src&quot; file extension. The Sherlock plug-in was composed of three parts, identified by their element names: , , and tags. These elements allowed Sherlock to (respectively) identify a search engine&#x27;s web page and the parts that are relevant to searching, as well as returning the results of the search. There was also a facility for defining how a Sherlock plug-in could update itself.

Sherlock search plug-ins could also be used (with minor modifications) in Mozilla&#x27;s browser suites. These plug-ins were, appropriately enough, known as Mycroft project plug-ins (named after Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock Holmes&#x27; older brother). Among some of the changes made in the Sherlock file format were the separation of the automatic update element (which formed part of the element) and the icon (provided in a separate file in Mozilla and part of the resource fork in Sherlock).

== Sherlock 3 channels ==
The Sherlock 3 search plug-in was a web application, which was downloaded on the fly from a server to ensure the most current version. As information on the internet is subject to change so quickly, this was one way for Apple to guarantee the up-to-date version. A channel consisted of a web directory with an index. This usually pointed to a sub-directory (usually called &quot;Channel&quot;) which contained the code XML, any Script XML, and localized lproj directories (nib file and Localized Text Resources as a plist).

The channels included by default were:
*Internet
*Pictures
*Stocks
*Movies
*eBay
*Flights
*Dictionary
*Translation
*AppleCare

== Current status ==
As Sherlock was never released as a Universal binary, it is not compatible with Mac OS X versions after Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and couldn&#x27;t be launched on Intel Macs without Rosetta.

==Accusations of plagiarism==
Advocates of Watson made by Karelia Software, LLC claim that Apple copied their product without permission, compensation, or attribution in producing Sherlock 3. Some disagree with this claim, stating that Sherlock 3 was the natural evolution of Sherlock 2, and that Watson was obviously meant to have some relation to Sherlock by its very name.

== &quot;Sherlocked&quot; as a term ==
The phenomenon of Apple releasing a feature that supplants or obviates third-party software is so well known that being has become an accepted term used within the Mac and iOS developer community.

==Versions==
*Sherlock – introduced in Mac OS 8.5.
*Sherlock 2 – shipped with Mac OS 9, new interface, more plug-ins.
*Sherlock 3 – shipped with Mac OS X 10.2, runs only in Mac OS X.
*Sherlock was replaced by Spotlight in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger for hard drive searches, and replaced by Dashboard for other functionality, but remained as a stand-alone program with its channels. It was completely removed in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard.

<doc id="342714" wikidata="Q112678065" url="?curid=342714" title="Electromagnetic catapult">
<text>An electromagnetic catapult, also called EMALS (&quot;electromagnetic aircraft launch system&quot;) after the specific US system, is a type of aircraft launching system. Currently, only the United States and China have successfully developed it, and it is installed on the &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class aircraft carriers and the Chinese aircraft carrier &quot;Fujian&quot;. The system launches carrier-based aircraft by means of a catapult employing a linear induction motor rather than the conventional steam piston. 

Electromagnetic catapults have several advantages over their steam-based counterparts. Because the rate of aircraft acceleration is more uniform (and is configurable), stress on the airframe is reduced considerably, resulting in increased safety and endurance and lower maintenance costs for the aircraft. Electromagnetic systems also weigh less, are expected to cost less and require less maintenance, and can launch both heavier and lighter aircraft than steam catapults. They also take up less space below the flight deck and require no fresh water for their operation, thus reducing the need for energy-intensive desalination.

==History==
Developed in the 1950s, steam catapults have proven exceptionally reliable. Carriers equipped with four steam catapults have been able to use at least one of them at 99.5% of the time. These have, however, several drawbacks. One group of Navy engineers wrote: &quot;The foremost deficiency is that the catapult operates without feedback control. With no feedback, there often occurs large transients in tow forces that can damage or reduce the life of the airframe.&quot; The steam system is massive, inefficient (4–6%), and hard to control. These control problems allow steam-powered catapults to launch heavy aircraft, but not aircraft as light as many unmanned aerial vehicles.

General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems (GA-EMS) developed the first operational modern electromagnetic catapult, named Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), for the United States Navy. The system was installed on USS &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot; aircraft carrier, replacing traditional steam catapults. This innovation eliminates the traditional requirement to generate and store steam, freeing up considerable area below deck. With the EMALS, &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot; can accomplish 25% more aircraft launches per day than the &quot;Nimitz&quot; class and requires 25% fewer crew members. The EMALS uses a linear induction motor (LIM), which uses alternating current (AC) to generate magnetic fields that propel a carriage along a track to launch the aircraft. A system somewhat similar to EMALS, Westinghouse&#x27;s &quot;electropult&quot;, was developed in 1946 but not deployed.

China developed an electromagnetic catapult system in the 2000s for aircraft carriers, but with a different technical approach. Chinese adopted a medium-voltage, direct current (DC) power transmission system, instead of the alternating current catapult system that United States developed.

==Systems under development==
The concept of a ground carriage is intended for civilian use and takes the idea of an electromagnetic aircraft launch system one step further, with the entire landing gear remaining on the runway for both takeoff and landing.

===China===
Rear Admiral Yin Zhuo of the Chinese Navy has said that China&#x27;s next aircraft carrier will also have an electromagnetic aircraft launch system. Multiple prototypes have been spotted by the media in 2012, and aircraft capable of electromagnetic launching are undergoing testing at a Chinese Navy research facility.

According to a report in July 2017, the construction of the Type 003 aircraft carrier has been rescheduled in order to choose between a steam or electromagnetic catapult and the latest competition results shows that the electromagnetic launchers will be used in the Type 003 aircraft carrier.

China&#x27;s military chief claims a breakthrough in electromagnetic launch systems for aircraft carriers has been made, and will utilize such a system in the third aircraft carrier that China will build after Type 002. The launch system is powered by fossil fuel via generators and capacitors. The design on the Type 003 carrier is being led by Rear Admiral Ma Weiming.

China&#x27;s electromagnetic catapult has been installed on landing helicopter dock &quot;Sichuan&quot; and its third aircraft carrier, the aircraft carrier &quot;Fujian&quot;.

===Russia===
Russia&#x27;s United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC) is developing new launch systems for warplanes based on aircraft carriers, USC President Alexei Rakhmanov told TASS on 4 July 2018.

===United States===
General Atomics EMALS was designed for and into the . A proposal to retrofit it into carriers was rejected. John Schank said: &quot;The biggest problems facing the &quot;Nimitz&quot; class are the limited electrical power generation capability and the upgrade-driven increase in ship weight and erosion of the center-of-gravity margin needed to maintain ship stability.&quot;

=== India ===
In 2013, the Indian Navy reportedly sought to equip the aircraft carrier with electromagnetic catapult, which could enable the launching of larger aircraft as well as unmanned combat aerial vehicles. Though, it was initially planned to be imported from foreign firms for INS Vishal, reports as of 2024 suggests, it is being developed indigenously by Bharat Electronics with assistance from private sector companies. The system concept has been demonstrated to senior Indian Navy officials and Minister of Defence. The Navy plans to gain clearance for construction of ground-based full scale model to initiate development.

As per August 2024 media report, Research &amp; Development Establishment (Engineers) has developed a scaled-down prototype capable of launching payloads up to 400 kg over a short span of 16 to 18 meters. For further development and to scale up for usage on future aircraft carriers, they are currently searching for industry partners. Platforms weighing up to 40-tons can be handled by the system. Two crucial technologies that have been successfully developed for electromagnetic catapult are Pulse Power, which controls the electromagnetic catapult&#x27;s power requirements and ensures precise and dependable launches, and Linear Electric Machine, which produces the electromagnetic force required to launch aircraft.

<text>Algoma District is a district and census division in Northeastern Ontario in the Canadian province of Ontario.

The name was created by an American ethnologist, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft (1793–1864), who was appointed Indian agent to the Ojibwe in Sault Ste. Marie region in 1822. &quot;Al&quot; is derived from Algonquin, while &quot;goma&quot; is a variant of gomee, meaning lake or water.

Algoma District has shoreline along Lake Superior and Lake Huron. It has an international border crossing to the American state of Michigan, at Sault Ste. Marie. Historically, it was known for its lumber and mining industries.

The rugged scenery of the region has inspired works by Canadian artists, particularly the Group of Seven. They rented a boxcar from the Algoma Central Railway to travel on excursions through this region.

==History==

Surviving prehistoric remains in Algoma District are concentrated around waterways. These remains date as far back as the Archaic period. There are also sites from the later Woodland period, with evidence of extensive Late Woodland habitation. Ceramics at Late Woodland sites show predominantly southeastern links, having originated from the Huron–Petun complex (broadly Ontario Iroquoian) as well as from modern-day Michigan.

French explorers arrived in the area by the mid-17th century. As the French penetrated into North America, they established lines of forts and trading posts, often at river mouths to control trade, especially the lucrative fur trade. In Algoma, they established Fort Michipicoten, located at the mouth of the Michipicoten River where it empties into Lake Superior. The Michipicoten was one of the geographic features depicted by Samuel de Champlain on a 1632 map. This helped the French bridge the distance to Fort Kaministiquia at the head of Lake Superior, and protected the route up the Michipicoten to James Bay, providing a significant crossroads of water routes.

===Administrative history===
Algoma was created by proclamation in 1858 as a provisional judicial district of the Province of Canada comprising territory north of the French River as far west as Pigeon River, including all Canadian islands in Lakes Huron and Superior. The authorizing act of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada was &quot;An Act to provide for the Administration of Justice in the unorganized Tracts of Country within the limits of this Province&quot; (known by its short title as &quot;The Temporary Judicial Districts Act, 1857)&quot;.

The district seat is Sault Ste Marie, Ontario. However, it is noted that Thessalon is where the Algoma District Services Administration Board is located.

As the population grew and the northern and northwestern boundaries of Ontario were determined by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, Algoma shrank. Other districts were created from it by the provincial government of Ontario:
*Thunder Bay District in 1871
*Manitoulin District in 1888
*Sudbury District in 1894
*Timiskaming District in 1912

==Geography==

===Rivers===

Algoma District is crossed by a number of rivers, which historically were used as transportation and trade corridors. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company chose key riverside or river mouth locations for a number of its trading posts in the district. One example was Fort Michipicoten, located at the Michipicoten River&#x27;s mouth. The rivers flow in a number of directions, some crossing through other districts to ultimately empty into faraway water bodies such as James Bay. Others drain into the Great Lakes Basin via Lake Huron or Lake Superior.

Major rivers in Algoma District include:
* Batchawana River (empties into Batchawana Bay on Lake Superior)
* Michipicoten River (empties into Michipicoten Bay on Lake Superior)
* Missinaibi River (originates at Missinaibi Lake and empties into the Moose River, then ultimately into James Bay)
* Mississagi River (originates in Sudbury District and flows into Lake Huron)
* Kapuskasing River (begins at Kapuskasing Lake and flows northward to James Bay)

===Forests===

In the Algoma section, the characteristic forest mixture consists of yellow birch, white spruce, balsam fir, sugar maple, hop-hornbeam, and eastern white cedar. Eastern white pine and occasional red pine (&quot;Pinus resinosa&quot;) dominate on the upper, steep south-facing slopes; white spruce, eastern white cedar, and balsam fir occupy the middle and lower slopes. A white spruce–balsam fir association, which usually includes white birch and black spruce, is prominent on the river terraces and adjoining flats in the northern part of the Section (Rowe 1972).

<text>Lakehead University is a public research university with campuses in Thunder Bay and Orillia, Ontario, Canada. Lakehead University, shortened to &#x27;Lakehead U&#x27;, is non-denominational and provincially supported. It has undergraduate programs, graduate programs, the Bora Laskin Faculty of Law, the only internationally accredited (AACSB) business school in northern Ontario, and is home to the western campus of the Northern Ontario School of Medicine.

Lakehead has more than 45,000 alumni. The main campus in Thunder Bay has about 7,900 students. As of September 2006, a new permanent extension campus in Orillia, located about north of Toronto, has about 1,400 students.

==History==

Lakehead University evolved from Lakehead Technical Institute and Lakehead College of Arts, Science, and Technology.
 Lakehead Technical Institute was established in response to a brief that outlined the need for an institution of higher education in northwestern Ontario. It was established on June 4, 1946, by an Order-in-Council of the Province of Ontario. Classes commenced in January 1948, in temporary rented quarters in downtown Port Arthur. In September of that same year, the first university courses were added to the curriculum.

Lakehead College of Arts, Science and Technology was established by an Act of the Ontario Legislature, proclaimed on August 1, 1957. Years later, the original Lakehead College of Arts, Science and Technology Act was amended to grant the college authority to establish new faculties, and confer degrees in arts and sciences.

The Lakehead University Act was given royal assent on June 22, 1965, and came into force on July 1, 1965. The &quot;Lakehead College of Arts, Science and Technology&quot;, thereafter known as &quot;Lakehead University,&quot; was continued under this new charter. The first degrees were conferred on May 5, 1965. The first university chancellor was Senator Norman McLeod Paterson.

==Campuses==

===Thunder Bay campus===

The original college site comprised about 32 hectares of land in south-west Port Arthur, Ontario. From 1962 to 1965, an additional 87 hectares of adjoining land was purchased in anticipation of future expansion. The first building was opened in 1957.

In 2005 the Northern Ontario School of Medicine (NOSM) was formed as a joint initiative between Lakehead University and Laurentian University in Sudbury organized within the Faculty of Medicine of both Laurentian (East Campus) and Lakehead (West Campus) universities. The medical school has multiple teaching and research sites across Northern Ontario, including large and small communities. Students are given a choice of attending either one of the two main NOSM campuses. NOSM is the only Canadian medical school to be established as a stand-alone not-for-profit corporation, with its own Board of Directors and corporation bylaws.

A new law school was established; the faculty accepted its first students in 2013. The program is housed in the former Port Arthur Collegiate Institute. In 2014 it was named the Bora Laskin Faculty of Law, after the fourteenth Chief Justice of Canada.

Lakehead University&#x27;s physical plant now consists of 39 buildings and 116 hectares of property including 40 hectares of landscaped and maintained grounds.

===Orillia campus===

Lakehead University opened a campus at Heritage Place in Downtown Orillia in 2006; during the first semester there were about 100 students.

In September 2010 the university expanded to its new 500 University Avenue location. A new academic building at this site represents the first phase in the development of Canada&#x27;s first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum university campus. A 271-bed student residence building and a cafeteria/bookstore facility opened in November 2012 at the University Avenue site. Lakehead Orillia now has over 1,200 students studying at the Heritage Place and University Avenue sites. Undergraduate programs are offered at the 500 University Avenue site, while the professional year of Lakehead Orillia&#x27;s education programs are offered at the downtown campus.

===Residence===
Accommodations at Lakehead are divided into three living styles: residence halls, apartments and townhouses. The Thunder Bay residence currently has a total of 1,196 beds and three cafeteria/dining halls. Students can choose from meal options that range from kitchenette, full-kitchen and complete meal plan depending on the residence styles.

The men&#x27;s residence for 52 students was opened in fall of 1962, and has grown to include a residence village consisting of 10 new buildings. The village is situated on the banks of the McIntyre River within five-minute walking distance of all university buildings and athletic facilities.

From 1989 to 1992, a complex of townhouses, including some handicap accessible units, was added to the residence facility.

A 271-bed residence in Orillia opened its doors in late Fall 2012. The Orillia residence has two meal plan options for students, with food services operated by Dana Hospitality since 2021.

===Agricultural Research Station===
The university supports a research station near Thunder Bay to test newly developed crop varieties. The station had been in operation for a number of years, and was officially taken over by the university in 2018.

==Academic organization==
The university has nine faculties: Business Administration, Education, Engineering, Natural Resources Management, Faculty of Health and Behavioral Sciences, Science and Environmental Studies, Social Sciences and Humanities, Medicine, and Graduate Studies. The Faculty of Law welcomed its first students in September 2013.

Based on full-time undergraduate enrolment, the Social Sciences &amp; Humanities is the largest faculty at Lakehead, with about 30% of the students, followed by Health and Behavioral Sciences, Science &amp; Environmental Studies, Engineering, Education, and Business Administration. Two small faculties are Natural Resources Management and Medicine, each with less than 2% of the student enrolment.

===Aboriginal===

As a percentage of total student population, Lakehead University has one of the largest aboriginal student communities in Canada. The university has a governing board with senate policies along with Aboriginal-governed councils within its university governance structure. Lakehead also offers Aboriginal support including the Office of Aboriginal Initiatives. Special first-year bridging programs for Aboriginal students are provided. Tutoring services are available within Lakehead&#x27;s Native Nursing Access Program. There is also the Superior Science Program which goes to remote Aboriginal communities. Lakehead has Canada&#x27;s only Department of Aboriginal Education to foster Native Language instruction and prepare teachers to meet the needs of Aboriginal students and communities.

===Scholarships and bursaries===
Lakehead University scholarships for Aboriginal, First Nations and Métis students include: Hamlin Family Fund Nursing Bursaries; Hamlin Family Fund Bursary; Hamlin Family Fund Native Bursary; Lakehead University Native Award; TBayTel Bursary 

Apart from these awards, Lakehead University provides entrance scholarships to high school students with marks above 80%, paid out during four years of undergraduate. Lakehead also offers free tuition to students with a 95% average or higher.

==Student life==

Lakehead University Student Union, or LUSU, serves as a governing body for student-run clubs. Students can participate in various club activities, ranging from student government to multi-cultural and athletics. LUSU is also responsible for publishing &quot;The Argus&quot;, the student newspaper, as well as running The Study Coffeehouse and The Outpost Pub, sites that often serve as gathering places for campus community activities and as performance venues.

===Athletics===
Lakehead&#x27;s Thunder Bay campus has two main athletic facilities known as the Fieldhouse and the Hangar. The Fieldhouse contains a main gymnasium, weight room, yoga room, 50-meter swimming pool and change-room facilities. The Hangar has a 200-meter indoor track, soccer field, cardio area, aerobic studio and a climbing wall. Lakehead University is represented in the Canadian U Sports league by the Lakehead Thunderwolves. Varsity teams include: Basketball, Cross-Country, Hockey, Nordic Skiing, Track &amp; Field, Volleyball, and Wrestling. It also has club teams including, Men&#x27;s Volleyball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s curling, and rowing.

<doc id="342729" wikidata="Q480902" url="?curid=342729" title="Wave-cut platform">
<text>A wave-cut platform, shore platform, coastal bench, or wave-cut cliff is the narrow flat area often found at the base of a sea cliff or along the shoreline of a lake, bay, or sea that was created by erosion. Wave-cut platforms are often most obvious at low tide when they become visible as huge areas of flat rock. Sometimes the landward side of the platform is covered by sand, forming the beach, and then the platform can only be identified at low tides or when storms move the sand. 
==Formation==
Wave-cut platforms form when destructive waves hit against the cliff face, causing an undercut between the high and low water marks, mainly as a result of abrasion, corrosion and hydraulic action, creating a wave-cut notch. This notch then enlarges into a cave. The waves undermine this portion until the roof of the cave cannot hold due to the pressure and freeze-thaw or biological weathering acting on it, and collapses, resulting in the cliff retreating landward. The base of the cave forms the wave-cut platform as attrition causes the collapsed material to be broken down into smaller pieces, while some cliff material may be washed into the sea. This may be deposited at the end of the platform, forming an off-shore beach.

Because of the continual wave action, a wave-cut platform represents an extremely hostile environment and only certain organisms can utilize such a niche.

==Use of ancient examples==
Ancient wave-cut platforms provide evidence of past sea and lake levels. Raised and abandoned platforms, sometimes found behind modern beaches, are evidence of higher sea levels in the geological past, and have been used to identify areas of isostatic adjustment. By using scientific dating methods, or examination of marine fossils found on the platform, it is possible to work out when the platform was formed, thus giving geographers and geologists information about sea levels at known times in the past. This has been used in the United Kingdom and other previously glaciated areas to calculate the rate at which land is rising now that it is no longer covered in ice.

Where the coastline itself is changing due to seismic action, there may be a series of platforms showing earlier sea levels and indicating the amount of uplift caused by various earthquakes.

==Usage of term &#x27;wave-cut&#x27;==
According to Trenhaile, Sunamura, and Massalink and Hughes, the term &#x27;wave-cut platform&#x27; should no longer be used as it assumes that shore platforms are the result of wave action, which is not always true. Shore platforms, like comparable river and lake platforms, are erosional features that develop when removal of saprock and other debris by waves and currents leaves behind a bedrock surface below the water table.

<doc id="342731" wikidata="Q5247632" url="?curid=342731" title="Death spiral financing">
<text>Death spiral financing is the result of a badly structured convertible financing used to fund primarily small cap companies in the marketplace, causing the company&#x27;s stock to fall dramatically, which can lead to the company&#x27;s ultimate downfall. 

Some small companies rely on selling convertible debt to large private investors (see private investment in public equity) to fund their operations and growth. This convertible debt, often convertible preferred stock or convertible debentures, can be converted to the common stock of the issuing company at a discount to the market value of the common stock at the time of each conversion. 

Under a “death spiral” scenario, the holder of the convertible debt might short the issuer&#x27;s common stock, at which time the debt holder converts some of the convertible debt to common shares with which he then covers the debt holder&#x27;s short position. The debt holder continues to sell short and cover with converted stock, which, along with selling by other shareholders alarmed by the falling price, continually weakens the share price, making the shares unattractive to new investors and possibly severely limiting the company&#x27;s ability to obtain new financing if necessary.

The lender would have a potentially greater gain if the shares were to increase in value, but if they decrease in value, there is some protection. Otherwise, they would probably not be willing to lend the money because of the poor risk profiles of the companies interested in this type of financing. 

There are some ways to limit the &quot;spiral&quot; situation, e.g. by prohibiting short selling so as to have a stronger incentive for the debt holder to see the stock price increase. It is also worth noting that in a spiral scenario, it becomes more and more difficult for the debt holder to recover its investment because of the increasing volume of common stock it receives upon each conversion of its debt. Another mean to limit the &quot;spiral&quot; risk is to ensure that the amount of funding is in line with the trading activity of the common stock, so as to reduce the potential decrease resulting from the sale of common stock by the debt holder. 

Companies willing to agree to financing on these terms often could not obtain funding through any other means due to their early development stage or credit risk profile. The terms, though viewed by some as onerous, give the lender a potential way to recover their debt regardless of what happens to the shares of the company, and the company easy access to dilutive but relatively cheap funding in terms of cash cost.

<text>The University of Windsor (UWindsor, U of W, or UWin) is a public research university in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. It is Canada&#x27;s southernmost university. It has approximately 17,500 students. The university was incorporated by the provincial government in 1962 and has more than 150,000 alumni.

The University of Windsor has nine faculties, including the Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, the Faculty of Education, the Faculty of Engineering, Odette School of Business, the Faculty of Graduate Studies, the Faculty of Human Kinetics, the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Nursing, and the Faculty of Science. Through its faculties and independent schools, the university has demonstrated its primary research focuses of automotive, environmental, social justice, and international trade research. In recent years, it has increasingly begun focusing on health, natural science, and entrepreneurship research.

==History==
=== Founding era ===

The university dates to the founding of the Roman Catholic Assumption College in Windsor, Ontario, in 1857. Assumption College, a primarily theological institution, was founded by the Society of Jesuits in 1857. The Basilian Fathers assumed control of the college in 1870. The college grew steadily, expanding its curriculum and affiliating with several other colleges over the years.

In 1919, Assumption College affiliated with the University of Western Ontario. This affiliation expanded the curriculum at Assumption, including new general and honours programs for Bachelor of Arts degrees, graduate courses in philosophy, and pre-professional programs in engineering, medicine, and law. At this time, Assumption was one of the largest colleges associated with the University of Western Ontario.

The school became co-educational in 1934 when it formed and admitted women to attend Holy Names College. In 1937, the first class of women graduated from Assumption College, receiving Bachelor of Arts degrees.

Escalating costs forced Assumption College, a Roman Catholic university, to become a public institution to qualify for public support. In 1953, through an Act of the Ontario Legislature, Assumption College received its own university powers, and ended its affiliation with the University of Western Ontario.

In 1956, the institution&#x27;s name was changed to Assumption University of Windsor, by an Act of the Ontario Legislature, with Reverend Eugene Carlisle LeBel, C.S.B. named as its first President. The recently created Essex College, an independent non-denominational college led by Frank A. DeMarco, became an affiliate, with responsibility for the Faculty of Applied Science; the Schools of Business Administration and Nursing; and the departments of Biology, Chemistry, Geology and Geography, and Mathematics and Physics.

=== Mid-twentieth century ===
In the early 1960s, the city of Windsor&#x27;s growth and demands for higher education led to further restructuring. A petition was made to the province of Ontario for the creation of a non-denominational University of Windsor by the board of governors and regents of Assumption University and the board of directors of Essex College. The University of Windsor was established as an institution by the &quot;University of Windsor Act&quot; on December 19, 1962. The transition from an historic Roman Catholic university to a non-denominational provincial university was an unprecedented development.

On July 1, 1963, the entire campus with all of its facilities and faculty became known as the University of Windsor. As a &#x27;federated member&#x27;, Assumption University remained as an integrated institution, granting degrees only in its Faculty of Theology. Father Eugene Carlisle LeBel from Assumption became the inaugural president of the University of Windsor, and Frank A. DeMarco, who had been holding both positions of Principal, as well as Dean of Applied Science at Essex College, became the inaugural Vice President. The university&#x27;s coats of arms were designed by heraldic expert Alan Beddoe.

Six months later, Assumption University of Windsor made affiliation agreements with Holy Redeemer College (now Académie Sainte-Cécile), Canterbury College and the new Iona College (affiliated with the United Church of Canada). Canterbury College became the first Anglican college in the world to affiliate with a Roman Catholic University.
In 1964, when President LeBel retired, John Francis Leddy was appointed president of the University of Windsor, and presided over a period of significant growth.

President Leddy, &quot;concerned that the University of Windsor should emerge as soon as possible from the status and reputation of a College to that of a University&quot;, set out to review the existing departments. Based on the strengths in the social sciences, economics, political science and psychology, Leddy proposed to the university&#x27;s board of governors that a law school be established. In September 1968, the Faculty of Law opened with its first class of students.

From 1967 to 1977, Windsor grew from approximately 1,500 to 8,000 full-time students.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, this growth continued. Among the new buildings erected were the Odette Business Building and the CAW Student Centre.

The university partnered with Chrysler in 1996 to establish the Automotive Research and Development Centre, a research lab that focuses on automotive research and education.

=== Twenty-first century ===
Enrolment reached record heights in 2003 with 16,000 students registered, a 15% increase from the year previous. The increase was driven primarily by first-year students due to the elimination of Grade 13 in Ontario that year. The university developed a number of partnerships with businesses and industry, such as a partnership in 2013 with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment that introduced internships for students and research opportunities.

In 2008, a satellite campus of the Schulich School of Medicine &amp; Dentistry opened at the University of Windsor. The partnership between the University of Windsor and the University of Western Ontario followed several years of community and political organizing, and built upon an existing partnership that started in 2002 that sent Western medical students to Windsor for clinical training. The satellite school initially trained undergraduate medical students in the Doctor of Medicine program and has since expanded to offer post-graduate residency programs in family medicine and psychiatry. As of 2023, the program has added almost 100 physicians to the region.

==Campus==

Located in Canada&#x27;s traditional &quot;automotive capital&quot; across the border from Detroit, the campus is near the United States and its busy port of entry to and from the United States. It is framed by the Ambassador Bridge to the west and the Detroit River to the north.

The campus covers (contiguous) and is surrounded by a residential neighborhood. The campus features a small arboretum, which represents most of the species from the Carolinian forest. Campus is approximately a 10-minute drive from downtown Windsor. The university has moved some academic programs to the downtown core, including Social Work, the Executive and Professional Education program, Music and Fine Arts. Due to its historical roots in multiple religious institutions, the university&#x27;s campus has many examples of Christian architecture in addition to its modern flagship buildings like the $10-million dollar Joyce Entrepreneurship Centre.

The War Memorial Hall (more generally known as Memorial Hall) is a landmark building used as classrooms, labs, and offices. Memorial Hall honours alumni who had enlisted and died in the First World War, and in the Second World War. A bronze tablet remembers the alumni of Assumption College who died in the Second World War.

The Joyce Entrepreneurship Centre (formerly the “Innovation Centre”) is located on the main campus, on the south side of Wyandotte street. This building houses the EPICentre, and WEtech Alliance. The EPICentre (Entrepreneurship, Practice, and Innovation Centre) is a University of Windsor organization focused on providing students and alumni with the expertise and resources necessary to pursue entrepreneurial goals. The EPICentre is part of the Ontario Centres of Excellence and provides education, mentorship, office space and varying levels of funding to help support startup business. WEtech Alliance is a similar organization, also being an Ontario Centre of Excellence, whose main focus is to support technology startup companies. They provide services to technology startups in the Windsor-Essex and Chatham-Kent regions, not exclusively to students and alumni from the University of Windsor.

The CAW Student Centre is the main, comprehensive centre servicing all student needs. It houses a large food court and the main campus bookstore. Also within the CAW Centre: Student Health Services, a dental office, counselling services, a photographer, a pharmacy, the University of Windsor Students&#x27; Alliance (UWSA), a Multi-Faith Space, the campus community radio station CJAM-FM, and an information desk. A large public area beside the food court is available for clubs and informational booths to be set up on certain days. For example, during October there is a period where many Canadian law schools set up booths with representatives who answer questions and provide information to undergraduate students.

The St. Denis Centre, at the south end of campus on College Avenue, is the major athletic and recreational facility for students. It has a weight room, exercise facilities, and a swimming pool. The South Campus Stadium built for the 2005 Pan American Junior Games is beside the St. Denis Centre - which also has dressing rooms for Lancer teams - and borders Huron Church Road, the major avenue to and from the border crossing. The athletics department has become well known for Track &amp; Field, and Men and Women&#x27;s Basketball.

In February 2018, the university announced plans to build a new athletic centre, titled the Lancer Sport and Recreation Centre. The new facility will cost $73 million and be 130,000-square-feet. Unlike the current St. Denis Centre, there will be many separate sections of the facility to host different athletic resources; such as a new gymnasium, pool, fitness gym and many multi-purpose rooms, as opposed to a single general-purpose space. Construction for the facility began in October, 2018.

In June 2019, a new research facility opened up on the campus. The new facility, called the Essex Centre of Research (or CORe) is built on to the south side of the existing Essex Hall science facility. It is an open concept 46,000-square-feet facility, featuring state-of-the-art labs and will primarily be used as a research facility.

===Student residences===
The university houses students in three residence halls on campus, with a fourth under construction. 

Alumni Hall is home to first-year students and beyond first-year students. Alumni Hall has all-gender floors and it is a suite-style residence where suites have two bedrooms that share a kitchenette and a three-piece bathroom. Beyond first-year students are typically not assigned to the same suite as first-year students.

Cartier Hall is home to first-year students. Cartier Hall has all-gender floors, two students share one room and four students share one washroom.

Laurier Hall is home to beyond first-year students with single rooms on all gender floors. 

The University is expanding its residence offerings with a new 160,000-square-foot, six-storey building that will house 440 single rooms, with two students sharing each washroom. The residence will also feature dining facilities and other student amenities. It is expected to be ready for occupancy in Fall 2025.

== Organization and administration ==
=== Governance ===
The university is governed as a public, non-profit, and non-denominational institution by the &quot;University of Windsor Act, 1962&quot;, which sets out the basic legal obligations and purposes of the institution. Similar to most Canadian universities, the Act establishes the university as a bicameral institution, governed by a Board of Governors and Senate, and led by a chancellor and president.

The Board is responsible for the oversight of all operational aspects of the university, including strategic direction, budgets, property management, and accountability for the university&#x27;s financial, human, and physical resources. The Board is also responsible for appointing the chancellor, and the president and vice-chancellor. There are 32 members of the board, 20 external and 12 internal; this size was considered to be large without a compelling reason by the Auditor General of Ontario in a 2022 audit of Ontario universities.

The Senate is the supreme governing body of the university in academic matters. It is responsible for establishing academic policy, approving new programs and curricular changes, setting admission requirements, and overseeing academic regulation and discipline. It is the Senate that grants degrees, and has the authority to revoke them. The Senate is constituted by members of the faculty, who are either appointed ex-officio by virtue of their role, or elected by the faculty members from their home constituencies. Several students, staff members, and an alumni representative are also appointed to the Senate. There are several standing committees of the Senate that oversee different aspects of the Senate&#x27;s mandate.

As is common in Canada, Windsor is formally headed by the chancellor and led on a day-to-day basis by the president and vice-chancellor. The chancellor is the titular head of the university and confers all degrees. The role is mainly ceremonial. Since May 2019 this has been Mary Jo Haddad, a Windsor nursing alumnus and the first woman to take this role, who succeeded Ed Lumley. The president serves as the chief executive of the university and the chair of the Senate. As per the Act, the president has supervision and direction over the academic work and administration of the university. The current president is Robert Gordon who has been in this role since September 2019.

=== Faculties, schools, and departments ===
The university is organized into nine faculties and schools, which may also be made up of departments. These faculties and schools are led by a dean who is supported by an associate dean. These, along with the department heads and the faculty members, make up each of the faculty&#x27;s Assembly or Coordinating Council. The university has 524 faculty members.

=== Federated and affiliated institutions ===
The University of Windsor has three federated or affiliated institutions. It is federated with Assumption University, a Roman Catholic university offering graduate degree programs in religious subjects. The university is affiliated with Canterbury College, a public liberal arts college affiliated with the Anglican Church of Canada, and Iona College, a public liberal arts college formerly affiliated with the United Church of Canada.

=== Finances ===
Windsor has an endowment of $139 million as of April 2023. The university&#x27;s total assets (including its campus) are valued at $877 million. Its operating budget for the 2023-2024 academic year was $345 million. The Government of Ontario provided 29% of the university&#x27;s operating revenue, while tuition fees accounted for the bulk of the remainder at 69%. International student tuition fees comprised 62% of all tuition fee revenue.

The growing reliance on tuition fees from international students is not unique to the University of Windsor and is common at Ontario&#x27;s public universities. A 2023 blue-ribbon panel of experts reviewed the financial sustainability of Ontario&#x27;s universities and colleges and found that Ontario funds universities at just 57% of the national average, due to the government&#x27;s policies that reduced direct funding to institutions and cut tuition fees for domestic students.

==Academics==
The University of Windsor is a public research university and a member of Universities Canada. Full-time undergraduate students comprise the majority of the university&#x27;s enrolment, with the university offering over than 120 majors and minors.

<text>Trogir (; ; Ancient Greek: Τραγύριον, &quot;Tragyrion&quot; or Τραγούριον, &quot;Tragourion&quot;), historically known as Traù (from Dalmatian, Venetian and Italian: ) is a historic town and harbour on the Adriatic coast in Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia, with a population of 10,923 (2011) and a total municipal population of 13,192 (2011). The historic city of Trogir is situated on a small island between the Croatian mainland and the island of Čiovo. It lies west of the city of Split.

Since 1997, the historic centre of Trogir has been included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites for its Venetian architecture.

== History ==
In the 3rd century BC, &quot;Tragurion&quot; was founded as a colony by Ancient Greek colonists on the Illyrian coast from the island of Vis, and it developed into a major port until the Roman period. The name comes from the Greek &quot;tragos&quot; (male goat) and &quot;oros&quot; (hill or mountain). Similarly, the name of the neighbouring island of Bua comes from the Ancient Greek &quot;voua&quot; (herd of cattle). The sudden prosperity of Salona deprived Trogir of its importance.

During the migration of Croats the citizens of the destroyed Salona escaped to Trogir. Initially the Roman Tragurium was one of the Dalmatian City-States. From the 9th century on, Trogir paid tribute to Croatian rulers and to the Byzantine empire. The diocese of Trogir was established in the 11th century (abolished in 1828; it is now part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Split-Makarska and has temporarily been a Latin titular bishopric). In 1107, it was chartered by the king of Hungary, Croatia and Dalmatia Coloman, gaining thus its autonomy as a town.

In the year 1000, the Republic of Venice received submission from the Tragurium inhabitants and the city started since then to have commerce with the Italian peninsula enjoying cultural and economic improvements. However, in 1105, it acknowledged the supremacy of Hungary, while retaining its municipal freedom, and received a charter in 1108.

In 1123, Trogir was conquered and almost completely demolished by the Saracens. However, Trogir recovered in a short period to experience powerful economic prosperity in the 12th and the 13th centuries, with some autonomy under Venetian leadership. In 1242, King Béla IV of Hungary found refuge there as he fled the Mongols, who were unable to storm the island city. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, members of the Šubić family were most frequently elected dukes by the citizens of Trogir; Mladen III (1348), according to the inscription on the sepulchral slab in the Cathedral of Trogir called &quot;the shield of the Croats&quot;, was one of the most prominent Šubićs. In Dalmatian, the city was known as Tragur.

After the War of Chioggia between Genoa and Venice, on 14 March 1381 Chioggia concluded an alliance with Zadar and Trogir against Venice, and finally Chioggia became better protected by Venice in 1412, because the newly (21 July 1412) conquered Šibenik, called Sebenico by the Venetian Republic, became the seat of the main customs office and the seat of the salt consumers office with a monopoly on the salt trade in Chioggia and on the whole Adriatic Sea.

In 1420, the period of a long-term Venetian rule began and lasted nearly four centuries, when &quot;Traù&quot; (as the city was called by the Venetians) was a city with rich economy, as exemplified by numerous Renaissance works of art and architecture. In about 1650 a manuscript of the ancient Roman author Petronius&#x27; &quot;Satyricon&quot; was discovered at Trogir which contained the &quot;Cena Trimalchionis&quot; (&quot;Trimalchio&#x27;s Dinner&quot;). This is the longest surviving portion of the &quot;Satyricon&quot; and a major discovery for Roman literature.

On the fall of Venice in 1797, &quot;Traù&quot; became a part of the Habsburg Empire, which ruled over the city until 1918, with the exception of Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s French rule from 1806 to 1814 (when the city was part of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy and Illyrian Provinces).

After World War I, Trogir, together with most parts of Dalmatia, became a part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and subsequently the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During this period Dalmatian Italians, who until 1918 were present in the city, left for Italy. In 1939, it become a part of Banovina of Croatia. During World War II, Trogir was annexed by Italy and was part of the Italian Governorate of Dalmatia from 1941 to 1943 being part of the province of Spalato. After a short period of partisan rule it became part of the Independent State of Croatia under German military supervision from 1943 to 1944. Subsequently Tito&#x27;s Partisans liberated it for the second time in 1944. After that it belonged to the second Yugoslavia, and from 1991 to Croatia.

== Population ==
The city belonged for centuries to the Republic of Venice within the so-called Venetian Dalmatia, and for this reason, there was a significant community of Italians in Trogir, the Dalmatian Italians. According to the Austrian census of 1880, there were 1,960 Italians out of 3,129 inhabitants, corresponding to 62.64% of the total population. Their number dropped drastically following the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus, which took place from 1943 to 1960. From the 2011 Croatian census, there are 10 Dalmatian Italians present in Trogir, correspond to 0.08% of the total population.

==Main sights==


Trogir has 2300 years of continuous urban tradition. Its culture was created under the influence of the ancient Greeks, and then the Romans, and Venetians. Trogir has a high concentration of palaces, churches, and towers, as well as a fortress on a small island, and in 1997, was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List. &quot;The orthogonal street plan of this island settlement dates back to the Hellenistic period and it was embellished by successive rulers with many fine public and domestic buildings and fortifications. Its beautiful Romanesque churches are complemented by the outstanding Renaissance and Baroque buildings from the Venetian period&quot;, says the UNESCO report.

Trogir is the best-preserved Romanesque-Gothic complex not only in the Adriatic, but in all of Central Europe. Trogir&#x27;s medieval core, surrounded by walls, comprises a preserved castle and tower and a series of dwellings and palaces from the Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque periods. Trogir&#x27;s grandest building is the Trogir Cathedral (church of St. Lawrence), whose main west portal is a masterpiece by Radovan, and the most significant work of the Romanesque-Gothic style in Croatia.

The most important sites include:
* Historical city core, with about 10 churches and numerous buildings from the 13th century
* The city gate (17th century) and city walls (15th century)
* The Fortress Kamerlengo (15th century)
* The Duke&#x27;s Palace (13th century)
* The Cathedral (13th century) with the Portal of Master Radovan, the unique work of this Dalmatian artist
* The big and small palaces Cipiko from the 15th century
* The city loggia from 15th century

The St. Peter Church was part of the women&#x27;s Benedictine monastery which was, according to the legend, founded by the wife of king Bela IV of Hungary. The west front of the church is embellished by a Baroque portal decorated with a bust of St. Peter, the work of Niccolo di Giovanni Fiorentino. The interior was restored in a Baroque style in the second half of the 17th century. The wooden ceiling dating from that period is divided into oval, semioval and hexagon fields, framed by richly decorated borders. It was then that the two side-altars were added, dedicated to Mother Mary and St. Ignatius of Loyola. The high altar from the same period was made of wood, but only the statues of St. Peter and St. Paul have survived to the present day. Set into the pavement of the church one finds tombs of Trogir noble families Andreis and Cipiko.

The St. Sebastian&#x27;s Church was built in 1476 as a votive church or an offering given by the citizens of Trogir in thanks for deliverance from the plague. The front of this Renaissance building, which was executed by Niccolo di Giovanni Fiorentino, is decorated with the sculptures of St. Sebastian and Christ the Saviour. It displays the coats of arms of Bishop Giacomo Torlon and that of the duke Malipiero. Above the front rises the two-story tower of the town clock. A part of the eastern wall contains the remains of a centrally planned church with six apses dedicated to St. Mary. Against the west walls rests a plaque bearing names of the fallen defenders in the Croatian War for Independence.

The Town Loggia of Trogir was first recorded in documents of the 13th century. It served as a furnished public gathering space, and on certain dates and hours it was used by the communal legal service, as a place were contracts were signed, official announcements made, laws proclaimed, and where law proceedings took place. In 1471, the workshop of Niccolo di Giovanni Fiorentino executed a relief of Justice on the eastern wall, depicting the Venetian lion with S. Lawrence and B. John of Trogir, both guardians of the city. It was, in fact, a monument dedicated to the Republic of Venice. The central field with the lion was removed in 1932. On the south wall, the relief of a horseman depicting Petar Berislavić, viceroy of Croatia (1513–1520), was done by Ivan Meštrović. The Loggia was renovated in 1892.

The Garagnin-Fanfogna Palace is constituted of two blocks of Romanesque and Gothic buildings, incorporated into the ensemble in the second half of the 18th century, after the plans of Ignacije Macanović. The two-story building with the stone stairway situated on the south side originally had an economy purpose. Today its ground floor houses the town &quot;lapidarium&quot; within which the city walls of the Hellenistic Tragurion are presented. On the first floor there is Cata Dujšin-Ribar Gallery. The main entrance to the Palace with a lobby and a staircase was situated on the east side, in the main street, and decorated with a Late Baroque elements characteristic of the Macanović workshop. In the interior there is the original 18th century drawing room embellished with stucco decorations. The library owned by Ivan L. Garagnin (1722–1783), a numismatist and collector of archaeological monuments, is decorated with wall paintings portraying philosophers and writers. The ensemble houses collections of paintings and graphics from the 17th and 18th centuries and the Town Museum.

The Museum of sacred art is hosted in the Late Baroque building on the Trogir main square, dating from the 18th century. There is a rich collection of early Dalmatian and Venetian sacred paintings (14th–15th century) with masterpieces of Gentile Bellini, Paolo Veneziano, Quirizio da Murano and others. Works of local masters, paintings of Blaž Jurjev Trogiranin [Blase, son of George from Trogir] or the 13th century polyptych of the cathedral&#x27;s high altar are exhibited in the Pinacotheca.

The &quot;Santa Maria de Platea&quot; belongs to the early 9th century hexafoil pattern churches. It is the central type building, consisting of a high dome surrounded by six apses, in the manner of Carolingian chapels. In the 17th century visitation four altars were described: the high was dedicated to the Assumption of Mary; the Renaissance one, built in 1463, was dedicated to St. Jerome; the remaining two were dedicated to St. Mary of Loreto and St. Lucy respectively. The church was demolished in the mid 19th century, its only image is preserved on the 18th century French illustrator Ch. L. Clerisseau&#x27;s drawing. The apses had three niches divided by pilaster strips on the outside surface wheres niches and windows gave rhythm to the tambour of the dome. To the west there was a portico used as a medieval courtroom, street was closed by the city clock tower in the 15th century.
==Economy==
Tourism is the most important economic factor in the Trogir region, covering 50% of the municipal budget with more than 20,000 beds in hotels and private apartments. It is one of the fastest growing ports for sail-tourism in Croatia, and boasts two yacht marinas. There is also a strong fishing and agriculture tradition among the population in surrounding areas.

The most important industry is shipbuilding, with shipyard &quot;Trogir&quot; established at the beginning of the 20th century. The shipyard has a capacity of two ships of 55,000 tons. Between 1990 and 2004, 93 ships were built in the shipyard.

Trogir has also been used as a location for several television productions; it notably featured in two 2010 episodes of the British TV series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Due to its Venetian architecture, it served as a double for 16th-century Venice in &quot;The Vampires of Venice&quot;, and as a double for 19th-century Provence in &quot;Vincent and the Doctor&quot;. It also doubled for 19th century Venice in the 2015 BBC miniseries &quot;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell&quot;, and was used for scenes set in the city of Qarth in the HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

<text>A limestone pavement is a natural karst landform consisting of a flat, incised surface of exposed limestone that resembles an artificial pavement. The term is mainly used in the UK and Ireland, where many of these landforms have developed distinctive surface patterning resembling paving blocks. Similar landforms in other parts of the world are known as alvars.

==Formation of a limestone pavement==
Conditions for limestone pavements are created when an advancing glacier scrapes away overburden and exposes horizontally bedded limestone, with subsequent glacial retreat leaving behind a flat, bare surface. Limestone is slightly soluble in water and especially in acid rain, so corrosive drainage along joints and cracks in the limestone can produce slabs called &quot;clints&quot; isolated by deep fissures called &quot;grikes&quot; or &quot;grykes&quot; (terms derived from a northern English dialect). If the grykes are fairly straight and the clints are uniform in size, the resemblance to man-made paving stones is striking, but they are not necessarily so regular. Limestone pavements that develop beneath a mantle of topsoil usually exhibit more rounded forms.

==Notable examples==
Limestone pavements can be found in many previously glaciated limestone environments around the world. Notable examples are found in the Yorkshire Dales and Cumbria in Northern England, such as those above Malham Cove, on the side of Ingleborough, and above Grange-over-Sands. They are also found in the Stora Alvaret in Öland, Sweden; in the Burren, County Clare, Ireland, the Great Northern Peninsula on Newfoundland, and in the Désert de Platé, in the French Alps.

<text>Road to Perdition is a 2002 American crime drama film directed by Sam Mendes and written by David Self, based on the first volume of the DC Comics graphic novel series of the same name by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. It stars Tom Hanks, Paul Newman (in his final live-action theatrical film role), Jude Law, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Stanley Tucci and Daniel Craig. Set in 1931 during the Great Depression, the film follows a mob enforcer and his son as they seek vengeance against the mobster who murdered the rest of their family. The film explores themes such as father-son relationships and the consequences of violence.

&quot;Road to Perdition&quot; was screened at the 59th Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2002, where it was nominated for the Golden Lion. The film was theatrically released in the United States on July 12, 2002, and was a box office success, grossing over $181 million against its $80 million budget. Critics received it well and praised Mendes&#x27;s direction, Conrad L. Hall&#x27;s cinematography, and the cast&#x27;s performances. At the 75th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for Newman, Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Art Direction. Hall was posthumously awarded the Oscar for Best Cinematography.

==Plot==
Michael Sullivan, Sr., was orphaned and then raised by Irish Mob boss John Rooney in Rock Island, Illinois. Unbeknownst to his own children, Sullivan is now Rooney&#x27;s most fearsome enforcer. Rooney has come to love Sullivan more than he loves his own biological son, the rash and unpredictable Connor.

Speaking in 1931 at his brother&#x27;s wake, Rooney&#x27;s associate Finn McGovern insinuates that Rooney is responsible for his brother&#x27;s death. Rooney sends Connor and Sullivan to talk with McGovern. Sullivan&#x27;s older son, twelve-year-old Michael Jr., watches the interaction through a hole in the wall. McGovern denies that his brother stole anything from the mob and implies that Connor was responsible. Connor shoots McGovern, forcing Sullivan to shoot the other armed witnesses in self-defense. Sullivan learns that Michael saw the shootout and swears him to secrecy.

Rooney sends Sullivan to collect a debt from Tony Calvino. Connor, jealous and afraid, sends a letter with Sullivan for Calvino. Calvino reads the letter and reaches for his revolver, but Sullivan kills both Calvino and his bodyguard. The letter reads, &quot;Kill Sullivan and all debts are paid&quot;. Sullivan rushes home. When Sullivan arrives, he discovers that Connor has already murdered his wife, Annie, and their younger son, Peter. Michael was unharmed, as he had arrived home late from detention.

Sullivan and Michael flee Rock Island and head to Chicago to meet mobster Frank Nitti. Sullivan offers to work for the Chicago Outfit in exchange for permission to kill Connor. Nitti rejects his offer and advises Sullivan against seeking revenge. Rooney, listening next door with Connor, reluctantly allows Nitti to dispatch freelance killer Harlen Maguire to kill Sullivan. Maguire tracks the Sullivans to a roadside diner. Maguire and Sullivan converse seemingly casually while Michael stays in the car. Sensing the danger, Sullivan escapes the diner through the bathroom window and slashes Maguire&#x27;s tires before driving away.

Sullivan begins robbing the banks that hold the Outfit&#x27;s money. In so doing, Sullivan hopes to pressure the Outfit into withdrawing their protection from Connor. Sullivan teaches Michael to drive so that he can act as a getaway driver. The mob withdraws money from its banks, which interferes with Sullivan&#x27;s plan. Sullivan visits Rooney&#x27;s accountant, Alexander Rance. Rance stalls Sullivan until Maguire enters with a shotgun. Rance is killed in the crossfire before Sullivan wounds Maguire and escapes with Rooney&#x27;s ledgers. During the escape, Maguire shoots Sullivan in the shoulder. Michael drives them to a farm after Sullivan collapses from his wound, and an elderly childless husband and wife at the farm help him recover.

The ledgers reveal that Connor has been embezzling from his father. Believing that Rooney will call off the hit on him if he knows the truth, Sullivan heads back to Rock Island. Sullivan confronts Rooney at Mass and discovers that Rooney already knows Connor has been robbing him. Rooney states that he expects that Connor will either be killed by Sullivan or by Nitti&#x27;s men after Rooney has died. Nevertheless, Rooney refuses to give up his son. Rooney urges Sullivan to flee with Michael and raise him to be a better man than either of them are. Sullivan later ambushes and kills Rooney&#x27;s bodyguards and then Rooney himself. Nitti reveals Connor&#x27;s location after Sullivan promises that the feud will end with Connor&#x27;s death. Sullivan goes to the hotel where Connor is hiding and kills him.

Sullivan takes Michael to his aunt&#x27;s beach house in Perdition. Once there, Sullivan is ambushed and shot by Maguire inside the house as Michael stands on the beach. Michael appears and points a gun at Maguire, and Sullivan fatally shoots Maguire in the back. Michael tells his father that he could not pull the trigger, and Sullivan nods and smiles as he dies in his son&#x27;s arms.

Michael drives the car back to the elderly couple&#x27;s farm. In a voiceover, Michael says that he grew up there. Michael adds that he has not held a gun since his father&#x27;s death. Michael states that when he is asked if his father was a good man, he simply answers, &quot;he was my father&quot;.

==Production==
===Development===
When Max Allan Collins wrote the graphic novel &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;, his book agent saw potential in the story as a film adaptation and showed it to a film agent. By 1999, the novel had reached Dean Zanuck, who was the vice president of development at the company owned by his father, producer Richard D. Zanuck. The novel was sent to the elder Zanuck in Morocco, who was there producing &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot; (2000). The Zanucks agreed on the story&#x27;s prospect and sent it to director-producer Steven Spielberg. Shortly afterward, Spielberg set up the project at his studio DreamWorks, though he did not pursue the film&#x27;s direction due to his full slate.

Sam Mendes sought a new project after completing &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999) and explored prospects including &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, &quot;K-PAX&quot;, &quot;The Shipping News&quot;, and &quot;The Lookout&quot;. DreamWorks sent Mendes &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; as a prospect, and Mendes was attracted to the story, considering it &quot;narratively very simple, but thematically very complex&quot;. Mendes specified one theme being the parents&#x27; world is inaccessible to their children. Mendes considered the story&#x27;s theme to be about how children deal with violence, and whether exposure to violence would render children violent themselves. Mendes described the script as having &quot;no moral absolutes&quot;, a factor that appealed to the director.

=== Writing ===
Spielberg first contacted screenwriter David Self to adapt the story into a feature film. Self wrote an initial draft that remained close to the source material and retained most of its dialogue. The screenplay was then rewritten by uncredited writers, distancing the script from the graphic novel but leaving the core elements of the story intact. Some of the harsher aspects of the story were toned down as the script became more streamlined. For example, in some early drafts of the screenplay, Sullivan became an alcoholic, but this element was ultimately absent from the final version.

The story is deeply informed by the &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; manga series. Novelist Max Allan Collins acknowledged the influence of &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; on his graphic novel &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; in an interview with the BBC, declaring that &quot;&quot;Road To Perdition&quot; is &#x27;an unabashed homage&#x27; to &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;&quot;.

Some characters&#x27; names were slightly changed from their original versions in the graphic novel: the surname of the real-life gangsters John Looney and his son Connor were changed to Rooney, and the surname of Tom Hanks&#x27; character and his family was streamlined from the original O&#x27;Sullivan to simply Sullivan. One significant addition to the script was the creation of Maguire to provide a persistent element of pursuit to the Sullivans&#x27; departure from the old world.

Hanks and cinematographer Conrad Hall requested Mendes to limit violence in the film to meaningful acts rather than gratuitous carnage. Hanks&#x27; character, Michael Sullivan, is known as &quot;The Angel of Death&quot; and invokes fear in those around him, but his infamy is downplayed in the film. Mendes, who described the graphic novel as &quot;much more pulpy&quot;, sought to reduce the graphic novel&#x27;s background to its essence, seeking the &quot;nonverbal simplicity&quot; of films like &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; (1984), &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot; (1973), and films by Akira Kurosawa that lack dialogue. Duplicate language in characters&#x27; confrontations in &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; was trimmed to the absolute minimum. Mendes described &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; as a &quot;poetic, elegiac story, in which the pictures tell the true story&quot;. An example of one such unspoken scene in the film was the piano duet between Rooney and Michael Sr., intended to convey their relationship without words. In the final 20 minutes of &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;, the script was written to have only six lines of dialogue.

Max Allan Collins originally wanted to write the adapted screenplay but was not given the opportunity. Collins chose to stay out of the scripting process out of respect for the different writing styles for a different medium, though he served as a consultant. Collins praised the addition of Maguire and considered the minimalist use of dialogue to be appropriate. The author also applauded the film&#x27;s version of Rooney as &quot;more overtly a father figure&quot; to Sullivan.

Collins opposed the profanity in the script, as the vulgar language did not fit his vision of the 1930s. Collins also contested the path of Sullivan&#x27;s son in the film. In the graphic novel, the son kills once; in the film, Michael does not kill anyone. Collins also disagreed with the film&#x27;s narration technique. In the novel, the son narrates the story as an adult, becoming a priest, while in the film, Michael narrates while still a young boy.

===Casting===
Tom Hanks was sent a copy of the graphic novel by Steven Spielberg while he was filming &quot;Cast Away&quot;. Initially too busy to make sense of the story, Hanks later received David Self&#x27;s adapted screenplay, which he became attached to. Hanks, a father to four children, described Michael Sullivan&#x27;s role, &quot;I just got this guy. If you&#x27;re a man, and you&#x27;ve got offspring ... emotionally, it&#x27;s devastating.&quot;

Tyler Hoechlin was chosen from over 2,000 candidates to portray Michael Sullivan&#x27;s son. The actor was 13 years old while filming. In scenes in which Hoechlin&#x27;s character assists his father as a getaway driver, Hoechlin is trained by a driving instructor.

Paul Newman was unanimously the first choice for the role of John Rooney. The actor prepared by requesting Frank McCourt, the Irish-American author of &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot;, to record a tape of his voice.

David Self, who created the Maguire character, explained, &quot;He gets so jaded from exposure to this world, he steps over the line from being the storyteller to being the story maker.&quot; To capture the &quot;seedy countenance&quot; of the character, Jude Law was given a sallow skin tone that reflected the wear from working in a darkroom. Law&#x27;s teeth also received a lower gumline and had a rotted look. Law was also given a weak, thinning hairline. Maguire&#x27;s apartment also displays a collection of photographs of dead bodies, some of them actual police stills from the 1930s.

Stanley Tucci was selective about roles in gangster films, believing that Hollywood stereotyped Italian-Americans as gangsters. However, attracted by the prospect of working with Mendes, the actor accepted the role of Nitti, a real-life Mob boss from Chicago.

Anthony LaPaglia was cast as Al Capone and filmed a single scene, which was omitted from the final cut, and can be found in the DVD&#x27;s deleted scenes. Mendes believed that Capone was more menacing as an unseen presence. Actor Alfred Molina was approached to portray Capone, but Molina was forced to turn the role down due to scheduling conflicts with &quot;Frida&quot; (2002).

===Filming===
Mendes sought to produce a period film that would avoid clichés in the gangster genre. Mendes chose to film &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; on location in Chicago, IL, including downtown at the University Club of Chicago, the Chicago neighborhood of Pullman, the Charles G. Dawes House in Evanston, Illinois, as well as the far west Chicago suburb of Geneva, Illinois. General Jones Armory, the state&#x27;s largest location mainstay, which houses units of the Illinois National Guard, was provided to the studio by the Illinois State Film Commission. Sets were built inside the armory, including the interiors of the Sullivan family&#x27;s home and the Rooney mansion. The availability of an inside location provided the crew complete control over the lighting environment, which was established with the rigging of scaffoldings.

Mendes collaborated with costume designer Albert Wolsky, production designer Dennis Gassner, and cinematographer Conrad Hall to design the film&#x27;s style. Wolsky designed costumes that were &quot;very controlled, with soft outlines and very soft silhouettes.&quot; Gassner built sets that could capture the cold look of the era. Mendes sought a muted palette for the film, having dark backgrounds and sets with dark, muted greens and grays. Mendes filmed &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; using the Super 35 format.

The director filmed exterior scenes in Illinois in the winter and the spring of 2001, using real weather conditions such as snow, rain, and mud for the scenes. Mendes considered the usage of bleak weather conditions and the intended coldness of Gassner&#x27;s exterior locations to define the characters&#x27; emotional states. Pullman became a key location to reflect this theme, having several settings, including the town&#x27;s historic Florence Hotel, easily redressed by the crew for the film. Filming concluded in June 2001.

===Cinematography===
 To establish the lighting of scenes in &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;, Mendes drew from the paintings of Edward Hopper as a source of inspiration, particularly Hopper&#x27;s &quot;New York Movie&quot; (1939). Mendes and cinematographer Conrad Hall sought to convey similar atmospheric lighting for the film&#x27;s scenes, applying a &quot;less is more&quot; mantra. Hall also shot at wide apertures that retained one point in the depth of field sharply focused. Hall considered the technique to provide an emotional dimension to the scenes. The cinematographer also used unconventional techniques and materials to create unique lighting effects. One of Hall&#x27;s methods was to use black silk in daylight exterior scenes to filter the light enough to create an in-shade look.

Hall purposely distanced the camera from Hanks&#x27; character, Michael Sullivan Sr., at the beginning of the film to establish the perspective of Sullivan&#x27;s son, who is unaware of his father&#x27;s true nature. Hanks&#x27;s character was filmed as partially obscured and seen through doorways, and his entrances and exits took place in shadows. A wide lens was used to maintain a distance from the character.

Shots in the film were drawn directly from panels in the graphic novel, illustrated by Richard Piers Rayner. An instance of the direct influence is the scene in which Michael Jr. looks up at the Chicago skyline from the vehicle, with the skyline reflected in the vehicle&#x27;s glass.

A seamless 40-second driving scene, in which Michael Sullivan and his son travel into Chicago from the countryside, was aided by visual effects. The live-action part of the scene was filmed at LaSalle Street, and due to the lack of scenery for part of the drive down LaSalle Street, the background of Balbo Drive was included with the use of visual effects.

===Music===
==Themes==
===Consequences of violence===

The film&#x27;s title, &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;, is both Michael Sullivan and his son&#x27;s destination town and a euphemism for Hell, a road that Sullivan desires to prevent his son from traveling. Sullivan, who chooses his violent path early on in life, considers himself irredeemable and seeks to save his son from a similar fate. Said Mendes, &quot;[Sullivan] is in a battle for the soul of his son. Can a man who has led a bad life achieve redemption through his child?&quot; Hanks described Sullivan as a man who achieved a comfortable status through violent means, whose likely repercussions he ignored. Sullivan is a good father and husband but also has a job that requires him to be a violent killer. The film explores this paradoxical dichotomy. When Sullivan is faced with the consequences, Hanks says, &quot;At the moment we&#x27;re dropped into the story, it is literally the last day of that false perspective.&quot; To keep Sullivan from justifying his violent actions in the film, Mendes omitted scenes in the final cut that had Sullivan explaining his background to his son.

In the film, most of the numerous acts of violence are committed off-screen. The violent acts were also designed to be quick, reflecting the actual speed of violence in the real world. The focus was not on the direct victims of the perpetuated violence but on the impact of violence on the perpetrators or witnesses to the act.

===Fathers and sons===
The film also explores father-son relationships between Michael Sullivan and his son, Sullivan and his boss, John Rooney, and between Rooney and his son Connor. Sullivan simultaneously idolizes and fears Rooney, and Sullivan&#x27;s son feels the same about his father. Rooney&#x27;s son, Connor, has none of Sullivan&#x27;s redeeming qualities, and Rooney is conflicted about whom to protect: his biological son or his surrogate son. Connor is jealous of his father&#x27;s relationship with Sullivan, which fuels his actions, ultimately causing a domino effect that drives the film.

Because Sullivan shields his background from his son, his attempt to preserve the father-son relationship is actually harmful. Tragedy brings Sullivan and his son together. Sullivan escapes from the old world with his son, and the boy finds an opportunity to strengthen the relationship with his father. Tyler Hoechlin, who portrayed Michael Jr., explained, &quot;His dad starts to realize that Michael is all he has now and how much he&#x27;s been missing. I think the journey is of a father and son getting to know each other, and also finding out who they themselves are.&quot;

===Rain===
Rain served as a motif in the film. It was developed after research for the wake scene at the beginning of the film informed the director that corpses were kept on ice in the 1930s to keep bodies from decomposing. The notion was interwoven into the film, which linked the presence of rain with death. Mendes reflected on the theme, &quot;The linking of rain with death ... speaks of the mutability of rain and links to the uncontrollability of fate. These are things that humans can&#x27;t control.&quot;

==Release==
With filming concluding in June 2001, the studio intended a United States release for the following Christmas. However, in September 2001, Mendes requested more time. It was rescheduled for release on July 12, 2002, an unconventional move that placed the drama among the action-oriented summer films.

===Home media===
Max Allan Collins, who authored the graphic novel, was hired to write the novelization for the film adaptation. Collins initially turned in a draft that contained 90,000 words, but the licensing at DreamWorks required the author to use only the dialogue from the film and no additional dialogue. Collins reluctantly edited the novelization down to 50,000 words and later said he regretted taking on the task. In 2016, Brash Books published Collins&#x27; original version of the novelization as &quot;Road to Perdition: The New, Expanded Edition.&quot;

&quot;Road to Perdition&quot; was released on DVD on February 25, 2003, in both full screen and anamorphic widescreen versions. The DVD&#x27;s features included an audio commentary, deleted scenes, an HBO &quot;Making of&quot; documentary, and a photo gallery. Work on the DVD began on the same day the film&#x27;s production began, and a collaborative effort among the director, the studio, and the DVD production crew shaped the DVD&#x27;s content. Due to the limited space on the DVD, the film&#x27;s deleted scenes were chosen over a DTS soundtrack. Instead, the DVD included a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. A special edition DVD containing both DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtracks was also released, excluding the &quot;Making of&quot; documentary to fit both soundtracks.

&quot;Road to Perdition&quot; was released on Blu-ray Disc on August 3, 2010, featuring a widescreen transfer, a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack, and all of the features from the DVD release.

== Reception ==
===Box office===
&quot;Road to Perdition&quot; opened in 1,798 theaters in its debut weekend, competing against several other new releases, including &quot;Reign of Fire&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course&quot;. It ended up grossing $22.1 million, placing second to holdover &quot;Men in Black II&quot;. The film then beat &quot;Men in Black&quot; and &quot;Stuart Little 2&quot; to reach the number one spot during its second weekend with $15.4 million. It eventually grossed $104.5 million in the United States and $76.5 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $181 million.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Road to Perdition&quot; received positive reviews from critics, with Conrad L. Hall&#x27;s cinematography, the production design, and the lead performances of Hanks and Newman being praised. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 81% based on 216 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Somber, stately, and beautifully mounted, Sam Mendes&#x27; &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; is a well-crafted mob movie that explores the ties between fathers and sons.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised Hall&#x27;s cinematography and the thematic use of water. He also felt emotionally detached from the characters, saying, &quot;I knew I admired it, but I didn&#x27;t know if I liked it ... It is cold and holds us outside.&quot;

Kirk Honeycutt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised Hanks, Newman, and Craig but called Law&#x27;s performance &quot;almost cartoonish&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also complimented Hanks and Newman: &quot;[They] act together with the confidence of titans, their talents in the service of character, never star ego.&quot; Travers cited Hall&#x27;s &quot;breathtaking&quot; cinematography and composer Thomas Newman&#x27;s &quot;evocative&quot; score.

Paul Clinton of CNN said: &quot;While these deeply human issues are touched upon, they&#x27;re never fully explored, and that undermines the sense of greatness to which this movie obviously aspires.&quot; Clinton considered Craig&#x27;s character &quot;one-dimensional to the extreme&quot;. He found the cinematography too overpowering for the film&#x27;s storyline, which he considered &quot;weak&quot;. J. Hoberman of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; described the film as &quot;grim yet soppy&quot;. He added: &quot;The action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed.&quot; Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; thought that the script lost its path when Sullivan and his son fled their old life.

Eleanor Ringel Gillespie of &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; enjoyed the film&#x27;s cinematography, Depression-era setting, and the performances of Hanks and Newman. Gillespie wished the film lasted a little longer to explore its emotional core further. Eric Harrison of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; considered &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; &quot;the most brilliant work in this [gangster] genre&quot; since the uncut &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; (1984). Harrison considered Self&#x27;s script &quot;so finely honed that the story can change directions in a heartbeat.&quot;

===Accolades ===
In April 2006, &quot;Empire&quot; recognized &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; as No. 6 on its list of the top 20 comic book films.

<text>Šibenik (), historically known as Sebenico (), is a historic town in Croatia, located in central Dalmatia, where the river Krka flows into the Adriatic Sea. Šibenik is one of the oldest Croatian self-governing cities on the Adriatic, the capital and cultural, educational, administrative and economic center of Šibenik-Knin County, and is also the third-largest town in the Dalmatian region. As of 2021, the town has 31,115 inhabitants, while the municipality has 42,599 inhabitants.The seat is the Šibenik Diocese.

It was first mentioned on Christmas 1066 in a grant of Peter Krešimir IV, so it is also called Krešimir&#x27;s Town. Until the plague pandemic in 17th century it was the largest city on the entire eastern coast of the Adriatic. Šibenik was the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the Croatia from December 1944 to May 1945. It is also significant as the place of foundation of the Croatian Navy.

The Cathedral of St. James is the most significant architectural achievement of the 15th and 16th centuries on the soil of Croatia. Due to its exceptional values, it was included in the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List in 2000, which was joined on that list by the Fortress of St. Nicholas.

== History ==

=== Etymology ===

There are multiple interpretations of how Šibenik was named. In his fifteenth-century book &quot;De situ Illiriae et civitate Sibenici,&quot; Giorgio Sisgoreo describes the name and location of Šibenik. He attributes the name of the city to it being surrounded by a palisade made of &quot;šibe&quot; &#x27;switches/twigs&#x27;. Some argue the name is of Illyrian origin, or derived from the family name of the Šubićs. Another interpretation is associated with the forest through the Latin toponym &quot;Sibinicum&quot;, which covered a narrower microregion within Šibenik on and around the area of St. Michael&#x27;s Fortress.

===Early history===
Unlike other cities along the Adriatic coast, which were established by Greeks, Illyrians and Romans, Šibenik was founded by Slavs. It was mentioned for the first time under its present name in 1066 in a Charter of the Croatian King Petar Krešimir IV and, for a period of time, it was a seat of this Croatian King. For that reason, Šibenik is also called &quot;Krešimirov grad&quot; (Krešimir&#x27;s city).

Between the 11th and 12th centuries, Šibenik was tossed back and forth among Venice, Byzantium, and Hungary. It was conquered by the Republic of Venice in 1116, who held it until 1124, when they briefly lost it to the Byzantine Empire, and then held it again until 1133 when it was retaken by the Kingdom of Hungary. It would change hands among the aforementioned states several more times until 1180.

The city was given the status of a town in 1167 from Stephen III of Hungary. It received its own diocese in 1298.

===Under Venice and the Habsburgs===
The city, like the rest of Dalmatia, initially resisted the Venetian Republic, but it was taken over after a three-year war in 1412. Under Venetian rule, Šibenik became in 1412 the seat of the main customs office and the seat of the salt consumers office with a monopoly on the salt trade in Chioggia and on the whole Adriatic Sea.

In August 1417, Venetian authorities were concerned with the &quot;Morlachs and other Slavs&quot; from the hinterland, that were a threat to security in Šibenik. The Ottoman Empire started to threaten Šibenik (known as &quot;Sebenico&quot;), as part of their struggle against Venice, at the end of the 15th century, but they never succeeded in conquering it. In the 16th century, St. Nicholas Fortress was built and, by the 17th century, its fortifications were improved again by the fortresses of St. John (Tanaja) and Šubićevac (Barone).

The Morlachs started settling Šibenik during the Cretan War (1645–69).

The fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797 brought &quot;Sebenico&quot; under the authority of the Habsburg monarchy.

Annexed by the French Empire and included in its Illyrian Provinces during the Napoleonian Wars, the town became (again) part of the Austrian monarchy after the Congress of Vienna. The compromise of 1867 brought it in the Austrian side of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, until 1918. During this Austrian period, it was the capital of the district of the same name, one of the 13  in the Kingdom of Dalmatia. The Italian name &quot;Sebenico&quot; only was used until around 1871.

In 1872, at the time in the Kingdom of Dalmatia, Ante Šupuk became the town&#x27;s first Croat mayor elected under universal suffrage. He was instrumental in the process of the modernization of the city, and is particularly remembered for the 1895 project to provide street lights powered by the early AC Jaruga Hydroelectric Power Plant. On 28 August 1895, Šibenik became the world&#x27;s first city with alternating current-powered street lights.

===20th century===

During World War I, the Austro-Hungarian navy used the port facilities of Šibenik, and the light cruisers and destroyers which escaped the Allied force after the battle of Cape Rodoni (or Gargano) returned to safety in the city, where some battleships were based. After the war Šibenik was occupied by the Kingdom of Italy until 12 June 1921 within the framework of the occupation of the eastern Adriatic. As a result of the Treaty of Rapallo, the Italians gave up their claim to the city and it became a part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. After World War I, the exodus of the Dalmatian Italians from the city began. During World War II, Šibenik was annexed by Italy and was part of the Italian Governorate of Dalmatia from 1941 to 1943 being part of the province of Zara. Communist partisans liberated Šibenik on 3 November 1944.

After World War II it became a part of the SFR Yugoslavia until Croatia declared independence in 1991.

During the Croatian War of Independence (1991–95), Šibenik was heavily attacked by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army and Serbian paramilitary troops. Although under-armed, the nascent Croatian army and the people of Šibenik managed to defend the city. The battle lasted for six days (16–22 September), often referred to as the &quot;September battle&quot;. The bombings damaged numerous buildings and monuments, including the dome of the Šibenik Cathedral of St James and the 1870-built theatre building.

In an August 1995 military operation, the Croatian Army defeated the Serb forces and reconquered the occupied areas, which allowed the region to recover from the war and continue to develop as the centre of Šibenik-Knin county. Since then, the damaged areas of the city have been fully restored.

==Climate==

Šibenik has a mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;), with mild, humid winters and hot, dry summers. January and February are the coldest months, July and August are the hottest months. In July the average maximum temperature is around . The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Csa&quot; (Mediterranean Climate).

== Main sights ==

The central church in Šibenik, the Šibenik Cathedral of St James, is on the UNESCO World Heritage list.

Several successive architects built it completely in stone between 1431 and 1536, both in Gothic and in Renaissance style. The interlocking stone slabs of the cathedral&#x27;s roof were damaged when the city was shelled by Yugoslav forces in 1991. The damage has since been repaired.

=== Fortifications in Šibenik ===

In the city of Šibenik there are four fortresses, each of which has views of the city, sea and nearby islands. The fortresses are now tourist sightseeing destinations.

It is included in UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Site list as part of Venetian Works of Defence between 15th and 17th centuries: &quot;Stato da Terra&quot; – western &quot;Stato da Mar&quot; in 2017.

<text>Tyler Lee Hoechlin (; born September 11, 1987) is an American actor. He initially earned recognition for starring as Michael Sullivan Jr. in the 2002 film &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;. In television, Hoechlin starred as Martin Brewer on &quot;7th Heaven&quot; from 2003 to 2007, and also became known for portraying Derek Hale on &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; (20112014; 2017), Superman in The CW&#x27;s &quot;Supergirl&quot; (20162019) and &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot; (20212024), and for voicing Sephiroth in the &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; franchise.

== Early life ==
Hoechlin was born in Corona, California, on September 11, 1987, to Lori and Don Hoechlin. He has described his family&#x27;s ethnic background as &quot;Native American, German, Irish, and some others&quot;. Hoechlin has two brothers and an older sister. He graduated from Santiago High School in 2006.

==Career==
===Baseball===
Hoechlin began playing baseball at the age of seven and continued throughout high school, playing in the Area Code Games in 2004 and 2005. He earned a baseball scholarship to Arizona State University, where he played infield; his team made it to the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. In 2008, after a year at Arizona State, he transferred to the University of California, Irvine, where he was second baseman for the UC Irvine Anteaters, and also played in collegiate summer leagues.

At first, Hoechlin aimed for a career in baseball, prioritizing it over his acting opportunities, which led him to turn down offers for auditions and meetings (including one with director Francis Ford Coppola), and to decline the role of Emmett Cullen in the &quot;Twilight&quot; films. However, during his junior year in college, he pulled his hamstring, limiting his ability to play and practice. As a result, he participated in more acting auditions, and eventually, on the advice of his coach, made the decision to pursue acting full-time.

===Acting===
As a baby, Hoechlin appeared in TV commercials. This led him to successfully audition at an acting school and obtain an agent. As an older child, his first role (at age 11) was in &quot;Happy Haunting&quot;, a &quot;Disney Sing-Along Songs&quot; video. At 13, Hoechlin was selected from among 2,000 auditioners to play Michael Sullivan Jr. in &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;. Hoechlin was nominated for multiple awards for the role, and won both the Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor and the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Feature Film – Leading Young Actor. That performance led to him getting the role of Martin Brewer in the television series &quot;7th Heaven&quot; in 2003. Initially booked for a two-episode arc, he was promoted to a regular character for the rest of the series.

Hoechlin was nominated for a 2004 Teen Choice Award for Breakout Male Star for this role, and remained a regular cast member for the next four years, garnering further nominations for a Teen Choice Award and a Young Artist Award. The series&#x27; producers accommodated Hoechlin&#x27;s baseball schedule, filming on days he did not have practice or a game, throughout high school and his first year of college.
After &quot;7th Heaven&quot; ended in 2007, he had small roles in other television series, including &quot;&quot;, &quot;My Boys&quot;, and &quot;Castle&quot;. He also returned to film work, starring in David DeCoteau&#x27;s &quot;Grizzly Rage&quot; in 2007 and appearing in &quot;Solstice&quot; the following year. He also appeared in the 2011 movie &quot;Hall Pass&quot;.

Hoechlin played werewolf Derek Hale in the television series &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;. He was a regular on the show for the first four seasons, and returned as a guest star for the sixth and final season in 2017. During the early seasons of the show, filmed in Atlanta, Georgia, Hoechlin lived with co-stars Tyler Posey and Dylan O&#x27;Brien. BuddyTV ranked him third on its list of &quot;TV&#x27;s 100 Sexiest Men of 2011&quot;. Throughout &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;&#x27;s run, the cast won the Best Ensemble award at the 2013 Young Hollywood Awards and Hoechlin won the 2014 Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Male Scene Stealer.

After leaving &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; to pursue other work and film roles, Hoechlin was cast in Richard Linklater&#x27;s baseball comedy &quot;Everybody Wants Some!!&quot;. To achieve a sense of camaraderie among the cast, they spent three weeks living together at Linklater&#x27;s ranch while fine-tuning the script. Hoechlin was able to draw upon his baseball experience for the film, in which he played team captain McReynolds. The film was released in 2016 to critical acclaim. That same year, Hoechlin appeared in a second baseball film, &quot;Undrafted&quot;, which, in contrast to &quot;Everybody Wants Some!!&quot;, was poorly received by critics. He also appeared in military thriller film &quot;Stratton&quot;, released in 2017.
Hoechlin was cast as Superman on the CW show &quot;Supergirl&quot; in 2016. As producer Greg Berlanti&#x27;s first choice for the role, he did not have to audition. Describing the casting as &quot;surreal&quot;, Hoechlin said he hoped to successfully embody the optimism of the character and maintain the idea of Superman as a symbol of hope. He appeared in four episodes of the show&#x27;s second season, and was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Guest Performance on a Television Series for his work in the role. His portrayal of Superman was well received by fans and critics and described as &quot;fun&quot; and a &quot;breath of fresh air&quot;.

In 2018, Hoechlin returned to &quot;Supergirl&quot; as part of the annual Arrowverse crossover episodes, titled &quot;Elseworlds&quot;. He also appeared in the corresponding crossover episodes of both &quot;Arrow&quot; and &quot;The Flash&quot;, which all aired in December 2018. Hoechlin returned to the Arrowverse for the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; episodes.

In October 2019, it was confirmed that &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot;, a spin-off series starring Hoechlin and Elizabeth Tulloch, was in development at the CW, which picked it up straight-to-series in January 2020. The series premiered on February 23, 2021, and was renewed for a third season in March 2022.
He was cast in &quot;Fifty Shades Darker&quot; as Boyce Fox, an author, in early 2016. Hoechlin did not appear in the finished film but did feature in the sequel &quot;Fifty Shades Freed&quot;, which was released in 2018. The same year, he appeared in &quot;The Domestics&quot;, a post-apocalytic thriller, which was released on June 28.

Hoechlin starred in George Gallo&#x27;s &quot;Bigger&quot;, in which he played Joe Weider. The biopic told the story of the Weider brothers&#x27; founding the International Federation of Bodybuilders. &quot;Bigger&quot; premiered on September 13, 2018, in Las Vegas, in conjunction with the Mr. Olympia competition, and was released to cinemas in October.

The following month, teen drama &quot;Then Came You&quot; premiered at the Woodstock Film Festival. Initially titled &quot;Departures&quot; when Hoechlin was cast in February 2017, the film was released theatrically in February 2019.

In July 2019, Hoechlin appeared as Ian Yerxa in the sci-fi drama series &quot;Another Life&quot;. Two months later, Hoechlin starred in &quot;Can You Keep a Secret?&quot; as Jack Harper. The film is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Sophie Kinsella; it began filming in October 2018. In 2020, he was cast as the new voice of Sephiroth for &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot;, succeeding George Newbern.

In May 2022, he was confirmed to reprise his role as Derek Hale in &quot;Teen Wolf: The Movie&quot;, for which he also served as a producer.

<text>Nipissing University is a public university located in North Bay, Ontario, Canada. The campus overlooks Lake Nipissing.

==History==
===Northeastern University (1960–1967)===
The roots of Nipissing University date back to 1947, when residents of North Bay formed a committee with the goal of establishing a university within the city. The 1958 Northeastern University Committee continued their efforts in the following years. By 1960, Northeastern University was established and for a short time in 1960–1961, the institution offered first year university courses in Arts, Science, and Commerce in facilities provided by a local Catholic boys&#x27; high school. Its application to the Ontario Ministry of Education for a degree-granting university charter was denied on February 28, 1961, and the classes ended shortly thereafter.

By mid-1962, Northeastern University had leased new space on Cassells Street in North Bay and arranged for Laurentian University professors to teach extension night classes there. This arrangement continued through mid-1967, with students receiving credits from Laurentian for the coursework done in these classes.

===Nipissing College (1967–1992)===
To ensure its funding as a university-level institution, Northeastern University changed its name to Nipissing College and signed an affiliation agreement with Laurentian University in 1967. Students attending Nipissing College in North Bay were also officially students of Laurentian University (headquartered in Sudbury, Ontario, 125 km away) with Laurentian being the degree-granting institution.

In 1972, the College Education Centre officially opened. This building, which is still home to Nipissing University, was shared between multiple other educational institutions including Canadore College, a school of nursing, and a teachers&#x27; college. In 1973, the North Bay Teachers&#x27; College was incorporated into Nipissing College as the Faculty of Education.

===Nipissing University (since 1992)===
Nipissing University received its charter as an independent university in 1992, thus allowing the school to grant baccalaureate degrees. On December 12, 2001, the government of Ontario passed a bill revising the university&#x27;s charter to permit it to grant graduate degrees.

The governance of Nipissing University is modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906, which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, is to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.

==Academics==

The university is composed of three faculties: the Faculty of Applied and Professional Studies; the Faculty of Arts and Science; and the Schulich School of Education; as well as the School of Graduate Studies. Nipissing University has approximately 5000 undergraduate students, the majority of which are full-time students, and 150 graduate students Applicants entering from high school must have a minimum of 70%, or 75% if applying for a degree in Criminal Justice or Concurrent Education, to be considered for full-time (30 credits) study. Cut-off averages for each program change annually. The graduation rate at Nipissing University is 85.9%, which is higher than the average Ontario graduation rate of 77.3%.

Nipissing University offers over 30 areas of study, many of which have opportunities for internships or experiential learning. Some partnership programs, such as Environmental Biology and Technology, Criminology and Criminal Justice (Policing Stream), and Social Welfare and Social Development allow students to earn both a bachelor&#x27;s degree and a college diploma from Canadore College in four years. Nipissing also has a collaborative nursing program with Canadore, giving students access the college&#x27;s nursing simulation labs.

Formally known as the Faculty of Education, the Schulich School of Education was established in 2010 due to a donation from philanthropist Seymour Schulich. Programs within the Schulich School of Education include both Concurrent and Consecutive Bachelor of Educations degrees as well as a Bachelor of Physical and Health Education.

The Nipissing University Student Union (NUSU) is the official body representing the student point of view at Nipissing. All students, both full-time and part-time, belong to the Student Union and fund the organization through their incidental fees. NUSU deals with many aspects of student life on campus, including the academic governance of the university and social events.

Nipissing University has a variety of clubs and activities. Clubs are sanctioned by NUSU and run by students. Common club categories include academics, recreation, volunteerism, current social topics, and religion.

Nipissing University has over 20 km of trails. These trails are accessible for hiking in the warmer months and for snowshoeing or cross-country skiing in the winter. Points of interest include the Lookout Tower and Duchesnay Falls.

Students at Nipissing may also partake in intramural sports, such as dodge ball, slo-pitch, and ultimate Frisbee. Fitness classes, which include Zumba, kickboxing, and yoga, are held in the R.J. Surtees Student Athletics Centre and vary by semester.

=== Work study ===
Nipissing University has a Work Study Program (called NUWork) that enables students with financial need to work part-time on campus. Students in the NUWork program are capped at a maximum of ten hours per week and have flexible hours to accommodate class schedules. The majority of work study jobs begin in September and may include positions such as research assistants, athletics facility staff, or technology service technicians. It is expected that students will have explored all possible funding options, including OSAP, before applying for this program.

==Residences==
Nipissing University has four residence complexes: Chancellors House, Founders House, Governors House, and the Townhouse Residence Complex. Chancellors, Founders, and Governors are suite-style residences with four students per suite. First-year students coming directly from high school and who receive full-time admission are guaranteed a single room in one of these suite-style residences. The Townhouse Residence Complex is reserved for upper year students (second year and up). The townhouses have a six-bedroom floor plan and represent a stepping stone between the suite-style living and living off campus. All suites and townhouses have their own full kitchen. Each residence complex has a team of residence life student staff including residence dons, academic dons, residence office assistants, residents&#x27; council facilitators, and residents&#x27; council executives.

==Athletics==
The university is represented in the Ontario University Athletics and U Sports (formerly called &quot;Canadian Interuniversity Sport&quot;) by the Nipissing Lakers. The school colours are green and blue and the mascot is Louie the Laker. The university offers seven varsity sports and five club sports. They include:

Varsity Sports
* Basketball
* Cross-country Running
* Volleyball
* Soccer
* Rowing
* Ice Hockey
* Nordic Skiing
Club Sports
* Lacrosse
* Ringette
* Squash
* Cheerleading
* Dance
Nipissing Athletics is housed in the Robert J. Surtees Student Athletics Centre, which has undergone multiple expansions since it opened in 2001. The Athletic Centre features three full-sized gymnasiums, two squash courts, three fitness studios, a weight room, and a cardio-weight room. The main gym, which hosts the varsity volleyball and basketball games, has a seating capacity of approximately 1200 people. The soccer pitch and Frisbee golf course are located behind the Athletic Centre. A main feature of the Athletic Centre is the Living Wall, a hydroponic green wall of plants that improves the air quality of the facility due to the oxygen it produces. Nipissing students also have access to a gym facility shared with Canadore College, which is located within the Main Campus building.

== Harris Learning Library ==

Nipissing University&#x27;s Harris Learning Library, named in honour of former Ontario premier and North Bay Teachers&#x27; College alumnus Mike Harris, opened on June 20, 2011. In 2012, the Harris Learning Library received the American Library Association&#x27;s Interior Design Award. The following year, the library was presented with a New Library Building Award from the Ontario Library Association for its architectural design. The Giving Tree, a two-story metal and engineered wood sculpture in the shape of a tree, won the Design Edge Canada Award in 2012. The sculpture stands in the foyer of the library and features the names of the library&#x27;s donors.

Based at the North Bay campus, the Harris Learning Library&#x27;s services extend to Canadore College, students located at Nipissing&#x27;s Brantford Campus, online/distance students, and members of the community. The Harris Learning Library has a diverse collection of information resources and services, including books, DVDs, archives, streamed videos, e-Books, online journals, and a collection of educational resources. Students have access to learning spaces such as group study rooms, silent study spaces, a brightly lit Thomson Reading Room, a computer lab, and Adaptive Technology rooms. The library welcomes approximately 169 000 visitors each year. On March 30, 2017, the library celebrated its one-millionth visitor.

The Harris Learning Library was not without controversy when it was named after Premier Harris. Many Indigenous people in the area raised concerns about celebrating Mr. Harris in light of his intervention with the events at Ipperwash.

<text>Ontario College of Art &amp; Design University, commonly known as OCAD University or OCAD U, is a public art university in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Its main campus is located within Toronto&#x27;s Grange Park and Entertainment District neighbourhoods.

The university is co-educational and operates three academic faculties – the Faculty of Art, the Faculty of Arts and Science, and the Faculty of Design – which offer programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as certificate programs and continuing education courses. The university is one of four members of the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design located outside the United States.

Established by the Ontario Society of Artists in 1876 as the Ontario School of Art, it is the oldest operating school in Canada dedicated to art and design education. The school was renamed twice in 1886 and 1890 before it was provincially chartered under its new name, the Ontario College of Art (OCA), in 1912. With the inception of the college&#x27;s design department in 1945, the OCA grew and later became the Ontario College of Art and Design (OCAD) in 1996. In 2010, the institution formally adopted its current title, including the university designation in its name to reflect its maturation and change in degree-granting powers.

In 2023, there were 4,890 undergraduates and 330 graduate students enrolled at the university. As of 2022, the university holds an association of over 25,000 alumni.

==History==
=== Early history ===

The institution was founded in 1876 by the Ontario Society of Artists with the objective to provide professional artistic training while furthering the development of art education in Ontario. On 4 April 1876, the Ontario Society of Artists passed the motion to &quot;draw up a scheme&quot; for a school of art, which later led to its creation on 30 October 1876, funded by a government grant of $1,000. The Ontario School of Art initially opened at 14 King Street West with a class of 25 students, headed by artist Thomas Mower Martin as the founding director, a position he held for the next three years. Fellow artists Robert Harris and William Cruikshank also joined the school, the latter serving as the school&#x27;s president from 1884 to 1886.

In 1882, the Ontario Department of Education assumed control over the school and transferred it to the Toronto Normal School. In 1886, the school was relocated to a building near Queen Street and Yonge Street and was renamed the Toronto Art School.

When the Ontario Society of Artists resumed sponsorship of the school in 1890, they renamed it the Central Ontario School of Art and Industrial Design and reopened it at the Princess Theatre, which also shared its premises with the Art Museum of Toronto (now the Art Gallery of Ontario).

===20th century===

In 1910, the school was again relocated, occupying 1 College Street as a result of the Princess Theatre&#x27;s demolition. Two years later, the school was granted a charter by the Ontario government that authorized it to issue diplomas. The institution was incorporated as the Ontario College of Art with George Agnew Reid named as its first principal. Reid designed the first building owned by the college, which was also the first building in Canada built specifically for the education of artists and designers. The college moved, for the last time, to the new permanent property in 1921, which is still in use today.

As a part of Reid&#x27;s wider efforts to have visual arts accepted as part of the province&#x27;s formal education system, Reid pushed for the OCA to potentially become a constituent college of the University of Toronto; however, the proposed amalgamation was never pursued.

In 1945, the OCA established a design school, broadening its education mandate. By the 1950s, the college had expanded beyond its downtown campus, operating classes in Port Hope, Ontario and at William Houston Public School in midtown Toronto (today part of York University&#x27;s Glendon Campus). In 1957, the college&#x27;s main campus received its first physical extension, which has since abutted the eastern side of the original schoolhouse. Three more expansions to the new building were followed in 1963, 1967, and 1981 in response to increasing student enrolment. 

Roy Ascott, who was OCA&#x27;s president from 1971 to 1972, radically challenged the structure of the college&#x27;s curriculum. The overhaul of the college&#x27;s curriculum put forward by Ascott anticipated future developments in art pedagogy but polarized the community at the time, hastening his departure from the college. In 1974, the institution launched its Florence foreign exchange program, which allowed students to study in Florence, Italy inside a dedicated building with studio spaces. The program was staffed by faculty members until the program was discontinued in 2017.

From 1979 to 1997, OCA also held classes at the Stewart Building, a building located north of the main campus at 149 College Street.

The institution remained the Ontario College of Art until 1996 when it was reorganized as the Ontario College of Art and Design, a change intended to recognize its inclusion of design education, raise its media and industry profile, as well as better position it for a transition from a diploma- to a degree-granting body. In the following year, the college entered into a partnership with the U.K.–based Open University to provide students the opportunity to obtain an Open University undergraduate degree.

===21st century===

The advent of the 2000s marked a significant era of transformation for the college, most notably in 2000 when funding was secured from Ontario&#x27;s SuperBuild infrastructure program to build a major fifth extension to the Main Building. Through Canadian architect Rod Robbie, British architect Will Alsop was made aware of the project&#x27;s call for proposals, and Alsop&#x27;s ambitious &quot;table top&quot; design was ultimately selected in 2002. A joint venture was formed between the two individuals&#x27; firms to construct the new contemporary extension, which was completed in 2004 and named the Sharp Centre for Design after its benefactors Rosalie and Isadore Sharp. 

The college also underwent further changes to its internal operations whereby, in 2002, the Legislature of Ontario granted OCAD university status along with the limited authority to confer bachelor&#x27;s degrees in fine arts and design under its name. In 2007, authorization was extended to the conferring of graduate degrees, and the college accepted its first cohort of graduate students the next year. In 2008, the college was granted membership into the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, and in 2009, it began providing continuing education services to non-degree students through its School of Continuing Studies.

In the early years of Sara Diamond&#x27;s tenure as president from 2005 to 2020, the institution saw a reformation of its pedagogy. Diamond emphasized academics over studio time, increasing the independence of the academic deans and requiring full-time instructors to hold a graduate or terminal degree. The curriculum was also changed to reduce the amount of classroom time versus studio time, increase the academic rigour of the college&#x27;s programs, and push for digital media and design research classes. This caused some controversy as two faculty members resigned over the immense changes.

In 2010, the institution officially became the Ontario College of Art and Design University, and full degree-granting powers were subsequently awarded to the university on 1 July 2020 by the Government of Ontario, including the ability to confer its own honorary degrees.

==Campus==

During the university’s years as a nascent institution, it had relocated to several different buildings in Toronto, many of which have been decommissioned or demolished over time. Only in the early 20th century did the school establish its own purpose-built structure, on the grounds of what is now Grange Park, a two-hectare green space that was once the front lawn of a nineteenth-century estate. As a result, the university&#x27;s campus is embedded within the surrounding neighbourhoods that have developed alongside it, rather than in an enclosed area with contiguous buildings, as is standard with most other post-secondary institutions. The current campus is spread across a combination of owned, co-owned, and leased properties in Toronto’s downtown core. The largest cluster of buildings is located in the Grange Park neighbourhood along McCaul Street, between Dundas Street and Queen Street West, and comprises the Main Building (including its multiple extensions), Butterfield Park, the Annex Building, the Rosalie Sharp Pavilion, 49–51 McCaul Street, and 74–76 McCaul Street. Another group of buildings is situated south of the neighbourhood in the Entertainment District at 199, 205, and 230–240 Richmond Street West. 130 Queens Quay East in the East Bayfront is the university&#x27;s &quot;waterfront campus,&quot; which occupies 1,300 square metres (14,000 sq ft) of the building&#x27;s fourth floor and forms part of a larger development called the Daniels Waterfront—City of the Arts. The campus in the Grange Park and Entertainment District precincts is accessible by public transportation via St. Patrick and Osgoode stations on Line 1, as well as the 505 Dundas and 501 Queen streetcar routes. 

OCAD U does not have any student residences on campus, though it offers students resources to search for off-campus accommodations in the city.

=== Academic buildings ===
Physically, the campus’s buildings vary in age and aesthetics, ranging from the revival architecture of the 19th century to the more contemporary design language of the present. Dating back to 1887, the oldest structures on campus are 74–76 McCaul Street, which are semi-detached Victorian houses that are not used as academic facilities, but have instead been converted into an independent art supply store for students, faculty, and the public. The George Reid Wing, the earliest component of the Main Building, was opened in 1921 and was designed by George Agnew Reid, an alumnus and principal at the then Ontario College of Art. The two-storey building is characterized by Georgian features similar to The Grange manor nearby, both of which front onto Grange Park. Under the Ontario Heritage Act, 74–76 McCaul Street and the George Reid Wing are classified as a listed and a designated heritage building, respectively.Likewise, the repurposed mid-rise buildings at the intersection of Richmond Street West and Duncan Street, including 205 and 240 Richmond, hold heritage status; they are among the few remaining brick warehouses from an industrial area formerly known as the Garment District, which existed in the early to mid-20th century. Previously called the New Textile Building, 205 Richmond is an Edwardian classical building that was acquired by the university in 2007. 240 Richmond occupies the former Richmond Duncan Building and is interconnected with 230 Richmond; both sites were acquired in 2008 and contain the university&#x27;s main administration and services facilities, as well as private offices rented out to the co-working space company WeWork.

&lt;br&gt;Throughout the later half of the twentieth century, several modifications were made to Reid’s original building. On 17 January 1957, the first expansion to the building was inaugurated, a modernist extension known as the A.J. Casson Wing. The Nora E. Vaughan Auditorium, two additional floors, and an atrium were later added to the building through three extensions in 1963, 1967, and 1981. The most recent extension to the Main Building, known as the Sharp Centre for Design, radically departs from the previous modernist extensions, and more so from the Georgian Revival architecture of the historical building. Opening in 2004, the Sharp Centre for Design was conceived by British architect Will Alsop and came out of a participatory design process. The contemporary addition, often described as a table top, consists of a black and white box that is supported by a series of multi-coloured pillars at different angles. The achromatic steel box stands four storeys (26 metres) above the ground and measures 9 metres high, 31 metres wide, and 84 metres long, adding 7,440 square metres to the existing structure below. The $42.5-million expansion and redevelopment is regarded as an architectural landmark in the city, receiving numerous awards including the first Royal Institute of British Architects Worldwide Award, the award of excellence in the &quot;Building in Context&quot; category at the Toronto Architecture and Urban Design Awards, and was deemed the most outstanding technical project overall in the 2005 Canadian Consulting Engineering Awards.
As the college expanded, new buildings were added to the campus and the existing neighbourhood, namely the Annex Building and 49–51 McCaul Street, which were built in the 1970s as part of a larger mixed-use complex adjacent to the Main Building. As its name suggests, the Annex is an interconnected building, which shares its ground floor with a small retail concourse that serves the local, residential, and university communities. A distinct architectural feature of 49–51 McCaul is its unique placement within and around the McCaul Loop, a century-old streetcar terminus. In 1998, a separate 2.5-storey building at the corner of McCaul and Dundas Street was acquired and named the Rosalie Sharp Pavilion.

Further campus renovations and enlargements were followed in 2016 through the university’s &quot;Ignite Imagination&quot; campaign, which aimed to raise $60 million to renovate 95,000 sq ft of existing space while adding another 55,000 sq ft of new construction — the largest fundraiser in the university’s history. The two-phased project included the revamped interior and exterior of the Rosalie Sharp Pavilion, which incorporates a stainless steel facade scrim that is based on a map of Toronto. Along with the Art Gallery of Ontario, the pavilion is intended to act as a &quot;gateway&quot; to the university&#x27;s premises by flanking the southern part of the Dundas-McCaul Street intersection.

=== Library ===
The OCAD University Library is the academic library system for the university, which carries a collection of 65,928 print monograph volumes, 76,089 electronic monograph volumes, 4,421 film and video materials, 3,284 electronic serials, 827 audio materials, and over 455,000 graphic materials.

The library manages three facilities: the Dorothy H. Hoover Library, The Learning Zone, and the University Archives. The former two facilities are based in the Annex Building while the latter is located in the administration building at 230 Richmond Street West. The Dorothy H. Hoover library is a general research library for art and design that bears the name of the university&#x27;s first head librarian. Located on the second floor of the Annex Building, the library offers several information programs and resources to support academic research for students and faculty members. It opened in 1987 and is a member of four library consortiums, including the Art Libraries Society of North America and the Ontario Council of University Libraries. Since 2009, the Learning Zone has been located on the ground level, functioning as an open study area and computer lab for individual and group work; it also contains a small selection of zines and printed matter made by current and former students. The Dorothy H. Hoover Library is open to the general public, whereas access to the Library Learning Zone and University Archives is restricted to the university&#x27;s students and faculty, except during public events and exhibitions.

=== Galleries ===

There are seven galleries operated by the university that exhibit art from students, faculty, alumni, and other professional artists: the Ignite Gallery, Onsite Gallery, Graduate Gallery, Open Space Gallery, Ada Slaight Student Gallery, The Learning Zone, and The Great Hall. Some of the galleries provide priority access to certain students; for example, graduate students are given priority to the Graduate Gallery while the Ada Slaight Student Gallery is mostly used by criticism and curatorial practice students to apply their education. The Onsite Gallery is the university&#x27;s public gallery that exhibits contemporary art by Indigenous, Canadian, and international artists. The gallery was originally called the OCAD Professional Gallery when it opened in 2007, before it changed to its current name in 2010. The university also has a partnership with Partial Gallery to showcase and sell art from students and graduates.

=== Sustainability ===
The Sustainability Committee is a sub-committee that is charged with creating and implementing sustainable operating practices throughout the university&#x27;s facilities. In 2009, the university and other members from the Council of Ontario Universities signed a pledge, known as &quot;Ontario Universities Committed to a Greener World,&quot; to transform its campus into a model of environmental responsibility. According to a 2024 report, the university received a silver rating by the AASHE&#x27;s Sustainability, Tracking, Assessment, and Rating System (STARS) for its sustainability practices.

==Academics==
OCAD University is a comprehensive art, design, and media post-secondary institution, and is the oldest operating school in Canada dedicated to art and design education. The university&#x27;s academic year consists of two terms, Fall/Winter and Spring/Summer, with the former term running from September through April and the latter running from May through August.

The university is organized into the Faculty of Art, the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Science, and the Faculty of Design. As of 2022, the university offers 18 undergraduate programs and seven graduate programs. Graduate programs are coordinated through the School of Graduate Studies. In the 2020–21 academic year, the university had an enrolment of over 4,100 full-time undergraduate and graduate students. In the same year, there were 2,345 people enrolled in an OCAD University School of Continuing Studies course. In the 2020–21 academic year, the university&#x27;s faculty included 151 full-time members and 294 part-time faculty members.

Undergraduate degrees conferred by the university includes Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Design, and Bachelor of Fine Arts. Graduate degrees issued by the university include Master of Arts, Master of Design, and Master of Fine Arts. Quality control of academics is maintained by the Ontario University Council on Quality Assurance. The university holds membership in several national and international post-secondary organizations, such as the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design, and Universities Canada.

=== Reputation ===
According to the 2023 &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; for the subject of art and design, OCAD U placed 51–100 out of 238 universities.

=== Admissions ===
The requirements for admission differ between students from Ontario, students from other Canadian provinces, and international students outside of Canada, due to the lack of uniformity in grading schemes between provinces and countries. Because English is the primary language of instruction at the university, applicants whose first language is not English are required to present proof of proficiency in English. The university has a holistic undergraduate admissions process, which typically requires the minimum admission average alongside an interview, a letter of intent, a writing sample and/or portfolio submission.

In 2017, the university reported a retention rate of 92.2 per cent of first-year students that advanced to their second year.

== Research ==

As of 2022, the university has over 20 research centres and labs, such as the INVC Research Centre and the Inclusive Design Research Centre (IDRC). The IDRC is a research centre focused on inclusive design and coordinates the Inclusive Design Institute (IDI).

During the 2020–21 academic year, the university received over $7.2 million in contributions for research purposes. As of 2022, four faculty members from the university are Canada Research Chairs. Three chairholders are part of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, while the other is a part of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council. In the 2019–20 academic year, the university received 24 research awards and $690,625 in funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

The university is a part of several research networks and joint-research projects, including the Centre for Innovation in Information Visualization and Data-Driven Design, and the Inclusive Design Institute. The former is a research project led by York University in partnership with OCAD, the University of Toronto, and other private sector partners to develop new design, analytics and visualization techniques for new computational tools. The latter organization, headed by faculty member Jutta Treviranus, serves as a hub for research into inclusive designs for information and communications technology; eight other post-secondary institutions also partner with the IDI.

Along with research centres and labs, the university also supports two business incubators, the Imagination Catalyst and the Mobile Experience Innovation Centre. The Imagination Catalyst was established in August 2011 through the merger of the Digital Futures Accelerator and the Design Incubator, and is overseen by the Digital Futures Implementation office, which provides incubator support for students, alumni, and faculty. The Mobile Experience Innovation Centre is another incubator with a focus on applied research in mobile technology.

==Administration==

=== Governance ===
As a publicly funded university, OCAD U operates under a bicameral system with a board of governors and a senate empowered by provincial legislation, the &quot;Ontario College of Art and Design University Act&quot;. The Act was last amended in 2010 when the institution assumed its present name. The 2010 amendments also formalized the role of the university chancellor, as well as converted the former academic council into the academic senate and broadened its duties.

==== Board of Governors and Senate ====
The university&#x27;s board of governors is charged with managing university affairs and guiding major operational decisions. The board has 18 members, including six individuals appointed by provincial government and two members elected by OCAD University alumni. Eight members are drawn from the university&#x27;s community, with some being faculty members appointed by the Senate, and others being elected by staff and student representatives. The senate is responsible for the educational policies of the university; it is primarily made up of faculty members, although it also includes representatives from the university&#x27;s administration and the undergraduate and graduate student body.

The chancellor serves as the titular head of the university and is appointed by the board of governors to a four-year term. The university has named five chancellors, the last being Jamie Watt, who began their four-year tenure on 1 January 2022. The board of governors is also empowered to appoint the university president, who acts as the chief executive officer for the university and on the board&#x27;s behalf with respect to the institution&#x27;s operations. By virtue of their office, the president is also the chair of the senate. Ana Serrano is the current president of the university, having assumed the position in July 2020.

==== Indigenous Education Council ====
The Indigenous Education Council was established at the university in 2008 with a mandate &quot;to identify and strengthen collaboration and partnerships with Indigenous communities, government bodies and other associations to promote and advance access, retention, and degree completion for Indigenous learners&quot;. The council consists of volunteer members who represent the interests and concerns of both the internal and broader Indigenous community. In accordance with the Aboriginal Post Secondary Education and Training Policy Framework (APSET), the council exists to ensure that Indigenous peoples are consistently and regularly engaged in discussions and decision-making within the institution.

== Student life ==

In 2022, the university&#x27;s student body included 4,721 full-time and part-time undergraduate students, as well as 316 full-time and part-time graduate students. The majority of students (approximately 73 per cent) are Canadian citizens, either from Ontario or out of province. Many domestic students receive financial aid through federal Canada Student Loans and/or provincial loan programs, such as the Ontario Student Assistance Program. In the 2019–20 academic year, approximately 67 per cent of first-year full-time undergraduates received some form of financial aid. In that year, the average amount received from each recipient was $6,830.

The university&#x27;s student body population is represented by the OCAD Student Union (OCADSU), which is a member organization of the Canadian Federation of Students. The union&#x27;s offices are located inside 230 Richmond, and they provide services including academic advocacy, a food bank, legal services, and student grants. In addition to OCADSU, a variety of cultural, social, and recreational student groups are officially registered with the university.

==Insignias==

The institution used a logo as early as 1903 to serve as a visual identifier. Since that time, the institution has used at least nine logos. The present logo was introduced in 2011, coinciding with the institution&#x27;s name change to &quot;OCAD University&quot; in 2010. The 2011 logo was designed by Bruce Mau Design and uses Gotham typeface.

==Notable people==

Several individuals are associated with the university either as alumni, or members of its administration or faculty. As of 2022, there were over 25,000 OCAD University alumni worldwide. Alumni can join the OCAD Alumni Association, an independent group of OCAD graduates.

Several alumni and faculty have gained prominence in the field of visual arts and design. This includes all the original members from the Group of Seven: Franklin Carmichael, A. J. Casson, A. Y. Jackson, Franz Johnston, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Frederick Varley; as well as several members from the Canadian Group of Painters and the Painters Eleven, including Anna Savage, George Pepper, Yvonne McKague Housser, Jack Bush, and Harold Town. Other notable alumni and faculty members from the institution include Barbara Astman, Aba Bayefsky, J. W. Beatty, David Blackwood, David Bolduc, Dennis Burton, Ian Carr-Harris, Charles Comfort, Graham Coughtry, Greg Curnoe, Ken Danby, Azadeh Elmizadeh, Allan Fleming, Richard Gorman, Fred S.

<text>Audrey Justine Tautou (; born 9 August 1976) is a French actress. She made her acting debut at age 18 on television, and her feature film debut in &quot;Venus Beauty Institute&quot; (1999), for which she received critical acclaim and won the César Award for Most Promising Actress.

Tautou achieved international recognition for her lead role in the 2001 film &quot;Amélie&quot;, which was critically acclaimed and a major box-office success. She has since appeared in films in a range of genres, including the thrillers &quot;Dirty Pretty Things&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; (2006), and the romantic comedy &quot;Priceless&quot; (2006). She was acclaimed for her role in the World War I drama &quot;A Very Long Engagement&quot; (2004), and for her portrayal of French fashion designer Coco Chanel in the biographical drama &quot;Coco avant Chanel&quot; (2009). She has been nominated three times for the César Award and twice for the BAFTA for Best Actress in a leading role. In June 2004, she became one of the few French actors invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS).

Tautou has modeled for Chanel, Montblanc, L&#x27;Oréal and many other companies.

== Early life ==
Tautou was born in Beaumont and raised in Montluçon. Her father, Bernard Tautou, is a dental surgeon, and her mother Eveline Marie Laure (née Nuret) is a teacher. She was named after actress Audrey Hepburn. She showed an interest in acting at an early age and started her acting lessons at the Cours Florent, where she learned English and Italian.

== Acting career ==

=== 1990s ===

In 1998, Tautou participated in &quot;Jeunes Premiers&quot; (The Young Debuts), a Star Search-like competition sponsored by Canal+, and won Best Young Actress at the 9th Béziers Festival of Young Actors. Tonie Marshall gave Tautou a role in her 1999 César-winning film &quot;Venus Beauty Institute&quot; (also known as &quot;Vénus beauté (institut)&quot;). In 2000, Tautou received the Prix Suzanne Bianchetti as her country&#x27;s most promising young film actress.

=== 2000s ===
In 2001, Tautou rose to international fame for her performance as the eccentric lead in the romantic comedy &quot;Amélie&quot; (original French title: &quot;Le Fabuleux Destin d&#x27;Amélie Poulain&quot;; ), a film directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Written by Jeunet with Guillaume Laurant, it is a whimsical depiction of contemporary Parisian life, set in Montmartre, and tells the story of a shy waitress who decides to improve the lives of those around her while struggling with her own isolation. It was an international co-production between companies in France and Germany.

&quot;Amélie&quot; won Best Film at the European Film Awards; it won four César Awards (including Best Film and Best Director), two BAFTA Awards (including Best Original Screenplay), and was nominated for five Academy Awards. Grossing over $33 million in limited theatrical release, it is still the highest-grossing French-language film released in the United States.

In 2002, Tautou appeared in the British thriller film &quot;Dirty Pretty Things&quot; directed by Stephen Frears and written by Steven Knight, a drama about two illegal immigrants in London. Produced by BBC Films and Celador Films, it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and won the 2003 British Independent Film Award for Best Independent British Film.

In 2004, Tautou starred in &quot;A Very Long Engagement&quot;, a romantic war film co-written and directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. It is a fictional tale about a young woman&#x27;s desperate search for her fiancé who might have been killed in the Battle of the Somme during World War I. It was based on the 1991 novel of the same name by Sebastien Japrisot. In June, Tautou was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS).

In 2005, Tautou starred in her first full Hollywood production, opposite Tom Hanks, in the film version of Dan Brown&#x27;s best-selling novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, directed by Ron Howard and released in May 2006.

She starred alongside Gad Elmaleh in Pierre Salvadori&#x27;s &quot;Hors de prix&quot; (&quot;Priceless&quot;), released 13 December 2006. It has been compared to &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;.

Tautou starred with Guillaume Canet in Claude Berri&#x27;s &quot;Hunting and Gathering (Ensemble, c&#x27;est tout)&quot; in 2007, an adaptation of the eponymous novel by Anna Gavalda.

=== 2010s–present ===
Tautou played the lead role in the biopic of fashion designer Coco Chanel, titled &quot;Coco avant Chanel&quot;, and directed by Anne Fontaine. Filming began in Paris in September 2008, and the film was released in France on 22 April 2009. The script is partially based on Edmonde Charles-Roux&#x27;s book &quot;L&#x27;Irrégulière&quot; (&quot;The Non-Conformist&quot;). Instead of releasing &quot;Coco Before Chanel&quot; in the United States itself, Warner Bros. let Sony Pictures Classics handle the release there. The film grossed $6 million in the United States.

&quot;Coco Before Chanel&quot; was nominated for four BAFTA Awards, three European Film Awards, six César Awards and the Academy Award for Best Costume Design.

In 2011, she appeared in &quot;Delicacy&quot;, a French romantic comedy-drama directed by David and Stéphane Foenkinos and based on the novel of the same name by David Foenkinos. David was nominated for the 2012 Best Writing (Adaptation) César Award and the film was nominated as Best Film.

She appeared in the music video of &quot;I Love Your Smile&quot;, a song by British singer-songwriter Charlie Winston.

She was the host of the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.

She was a member of the jury of the 2015 Berlin Film Festival. She appeared in the 2016 film &quot;The Odyssey&quot; as Simone Melchior Cousteau.

== Public image and modelling career ==
Tautou began modelling at a young age, taking modelling courses and other activities, and has modelled for magazines such as &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot; in many countries, and many others.

Tautou was named in 2009 as the next spokesmodel for Chanel No. 5, replacing Nicole Kidman. She was directed in the advertisement by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, with whom she worked on &quot;Amélie&quot; and &quot;A Very Long Engagement&quot;. The advertisement was released in 2009 to coincide with release of &quot;Coco before Chanel&quot;. She has also become the face of L&#x27;Oréal and Montblanc and several other ad campaigns.

Tautou over the years has been declared a fashionista and icon by the press, appearing in many magazines, fashion, beauty, and culture. She has attended major fashion week events around the world as well as smaller events. The press sometimes refers to her as &quot;The Chanel Muse&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Tautou studied at the Institut Catholique de Paris. A churchgoer when young, she has stated that she is &quot;not officially&quot; Catholic.

She says she considers France her base, where she focused her career, rather than in the United States. In 2006, she told Stevie Wong of &quot;The Straits Times,&quot; &quot;I am, at the end of the day, a French actress. I am not saying I will never shoot an English-language movie again, but my home, my community, my career is rooted in France. I would never move to Los Angeles.&quot;

<doc id="342756" wikidata="Q2591384" url="?curid=342756" title="HMCS Magnificent">
<text>HMCS &quot;Magnificent&quot; (CVL 21) was a light aircraft carrier that served the Royal Canadian Navy from 1948–1957. Initially ordered by the Royal Navy during World War II, the Royal Canadian Navy acquired the &quot;Magnificent&quot; while waiting for another aircraft carrier to be completed to their needs and it entered service in 1948 replacing in service HMCS &quot;Warrior&quot; which had been loaned for two years by the RN.

&quot;Magnificent&quot; was generally referred to as &quot;Maggie&quot; in Canadian service. In 1956, Canada received HMCS &quot;Bonaventure&quot; and &quot;Magnificent&quot; returned to the United Kingdom in 1956, where it remained in reserve until being scrapped in 1965.

The 1942 Design Light Fleet carrier was divided into the original ten &quot;Colossus&quot;-class ships, followed by the five &quot;Majestic&quot;-class ships, which had some design changes that accommodated larger and heavier aircraft. The changes reduced the weight of petrol and fuel storage by reducing them to 75,000 gallons, to offset the additional weight from strengthening of the deck to operate aircraft as heavy as . Further improvements over the &quot;Colossus&quot; class included larger aircraft elevators () and improvements made to internal subdivisions for survivability purposes and accommodations.
The ship was long with a beam of and a draught of . The carrier displaced . The ship was powered by steam from four Admiralty three-drum boilers. This propelled two Parsons geared steam turbines driving two shafts creating . &quot;Magnificent&quot; had a top speed of .

The aircraft carrier was armed with 24 2-pounder and 19 Bofors 40 mm guns for anti-aircraft defence. &quot;Majestic&quot;-class carriers were fitted out with Type 281, Type 293 and two Type 277 radar installations. The ship had a complement of 1,100, including the air group.

The third ship of the &quot;Majestic&quot; class, &quot;Magnificent&quot; was ordered 16 October 1942. The order was placed with Harland and Wolff in Belfast who were also constructing the &quot;Colossus&quot;-class ships and . &quot;Magnificent&quot; was laid down on 29 July 1943 with the yard number 1228 and launched on 16 November 1944.

===Aircraft===

&quot;Magnificent&quot; operated both fixed and rotary-wing aircraft. In preparation for her joining the Royal Canadian Navy, the two squadrons formerly assigned to &quot;Warrior&quot;, 803 and 825 Squadrons, were designated 19th Air Group and embarked Sea Furies and Firefly IVs respectively. 883 (fighter) and 826 (torpedo bomber/reconnaissance) Squadrons were re-activated and formed the 18th Carrier Air Group. They embarked Seafires and older model Fireflies respectively.

In 1950, the Canadian government purchased 75 Grumman TBF Avengers from the United States Navy for use on &quot;Magnificent&quot;. They were intended to replace the Fireflies in 825 and 826 Squadrons. In May 1951, the squadrons were renumbered with 18 Air Group becoming 30 Air Group with 883 Squadron becoming 871 Squadron and 826 Squadron becoming 881 Squadron. 19 Air Group became 31 (Support) Air Group with its squadrons being renumbered from 803 and 825 becoming 870 and 880 respectively.

In 1955, the RCN purchased Sikorsky H04S helicopters and equipped them with dunking sonars. The first squadron, HS-50, embarked aboard &quot;Magnificent&quot; in July 1955. In September 1955, the Canadian navy began using United States Navy-style designations for its air units. VF-871 was composed of Sea Furies and VS-881 comprised Avengers. In February 1956, &quot;Magnificent&quot; embarked a second helicopter unit, HU-21.

==Acquisition==

In May 1944, the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) intended to expand its fleet in size of ships if it were to take on a larger role in the Pacific theatre. In October, the RCN offered to exchange the American-built escort carriers the RCN was managing, the operational and the heavily damaged (did not return to service) , with the intention to acquire larger aircraft carriers from the Royal Navy. The six &quot;Majestic&quot;-class ships were considered surplus to Royal Navy plans, and the three furthest along in construction were offered for loan.

In January 1945 the RCN negotiated the loan of two ships, (&quot;Colossus&quot; class) and &quot;Magnificent&quot;, with the option to purchase at a later date. The government approved the deal in February 1945. As &quot;Warrior&quot; was nearly complete, having been built in a hurry to serve in the Pacific Theater of war and not for operation in cold climates, she was the first of the two transferred to the RCN and commissioned as HMCS &quot;Warrior&quot; on 24 January 1946. She officially joined the Canadian Atlantic Fleet on 23 March, but required further work to address builder&#x27;s defects. The ship had problems with her unheated equipment during operations in cold North Atlantic waters off eastern Canada during 1946, and she was transferred to the Canadian Pacific Fleet, arriving in Esquimalt, British Columbia, in December 1946. While undergoing repairs in January 1947, the RCN was examining the overall impact of reduced defence spending and manning constraints, and came to the conclusion that they could not operate two aircraft carriers. Negotiations began to return &quot;Warrior&quot; when &quot;Magnificent&quot; became ready, with the RCN deeming &quot;Warrior&quot; unfit for service due to her lack of heating. As &quot;Magnificent&quot; was still under construction, all preparations were included to make her fully capable of operating in cold climates. The carrier was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 21 March 1948, and &quot;Warrior&quot; was decommissioned two days later as an RCN ship and returned to the RN, which commissioned her into RN service a few months later.

==Operational history==

Following her arrival in Halifax on 1 June 1948, &quot;Magnificent&quot; performed workups. During workups she lost two aircraft. She was deployed in September 1948 to the Hudson Strait in one of her first missions. With the destroyers and , the aircraft carrier sailed on a training cruise to the Ungava peninsula in Quebec, halting at Wakeham Bay, Quebec. From there the two destroyers left the aircraft carrier and toured the north, becoming the first RCN warships to penetrate Hudson Bay. In January 1949, &quot;Magnificent&quot; sailed to the United Kingdom to embark Firefly Vs that replaced the Firefly IVs of 825 Squadron. Upon the aircraft carrier&#x27;s return, 825 Squadron was disembarked at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia and 803, 883 and 826 Squadrons embarked for the training cruise to the Caribbean Sea.

===1949 &#x27;mutiny&#x27;===
On 20 March 1949, while on fleet manoeuvres in the Caribbean, thirty-two aircraft handlers on &quot;Magnificent&quot; briefly refused an order to turn to morning cleaning stations to protest various grievances. The captain acted with great sensitivity to defuse the crisis, holding an informal discussion with the disgruntled crew members and carefully using the term &quot;incident&quot; instead of &quot;mutiny&quot;, which could have resulted in severe legal consequences for the handlers.

At almost the same time, similar incidents happened on , at Nanjing, China, and on at Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico, both of whose captains acted similarly to that of &quot;Magnificent&quot;.

===Training and visits===

Following the incident in the Caribbean, in June 1949, she went aground off Port Mouton, Nova Scotia. With the help of destroyers, &quot;Maggie&quot; was refloated and taken to Saint John for repairs. With the outbreak of the Korean War, &quot;Magnificent&quot; was withheld from service in that theatre on the grounds that she was already committed to NATO duties.

&quot;Magnificent&quot; spent most of her time performing port visits and training. In December 1951, the carrier began a refit lasting until March 1952. In September 1952, the carrier took part in the large NATO Exercise Mainbrace, and again in 1953 as part of the exercise &quot;Mariner&quot;. In 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. 16 aircraft (8 Sea Furies and 8 Avengers) took part in the fly past. In March 1954, &quot;Maggie&quot; underwent a refit at Portsmouth. In 1955, &quot;Magnificent&quot; sailed to the Caribbean Sea for training exercises with the US and Royal Navies, escorted by and &quot;Haida&quot; and then sailed to Portsmouth before returning to Canada. The aircraft carrier, escorted by &quot;Micmac&quot;, &quot;Haida&quot; and , made a second cruise to Europe beginning in September, making several port visits and participating in two NATO naval exercises. In 1956, she operated helicopters from her deck for the first time during a naval exercise. That same year, on 10 October, a TBF Avenger made the last fixed-wing flight from the deck of &quot;Magnificent&quot;.

===Suez Crisis===
On 6 November 1956, the St. Laurent government chose to join the United Nations Emergency Force, agreeing to send ground forces to Egypt. &quot;Magnificent&quot; was chosen to transport the men and supplies to Egypt, being withdrawn from a training exercise to do so in November. In preparation for use as a transport, the ship″s weapons were stripped, and her complement reduced to 600. The initial plan was to embark the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada, however that order was rescinded in December. &quot;Magnificent&quot; waited in Halifax until the end of the month when she embarked 406 Canadian troops and their vehicles along with 4 Royal Canadian Air Force de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otters and a single H04S helicopter and sailed for Egypt. She arrived in Port Said in early January 1957. This was to be her last role, carrying a large part of the Canadian peacekeeping force to Egypt, its vehicles parked on her deck. She returned to Canada in March.

===Decommissioning===

&quot;Magnificent&quot; left Canada in April 1957 and arrived at Plymouth on 14 June for decommissioning. She was replaced in RCN service by , another Royal Navy &quot;Majestic&quot;-class carrier (HMS &quot;Powerful&quot;) that had not been completed at the end of the war. She was returned to the RN in 1957 and placed in reserve until disposed of. &quot;Magnificent&quot;″s inability to operate the modern jet aircraft of the time led to her return and replacement. The ship was placed on the disposal list in 1961 and remained there until 1965. The ship was broken up at Faslane, Scotland, in July 1965.

<text>The designation His Majesty&#x27;s Canadian Ship (HMCS; [NCSM]), is applied as a prefix to surface ships in the Royal Canadian Navy and Canadian Joint Operations Command. The similar designation of His Majesty&#x27;s Canadian Submarine is applied to submarine vessels.

==Origins of the term==
The title is derived from &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Ship&quot; (HMS), used in the United Kingdom, as the monarch of Canada is also equally and separately the monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Various Commonwealth realms use derivative variations to designate their warships, such as His Majesty&#x27;s Australian Ship (HMAS) and His Majesty&#x27;s New Zealand Ship (HMNZS).

In the reign of a queen, the designation changes to &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Canadian Ship&quot;; the French version of the title remains unchanged in this instance.

==Usage==

After the formation of Naval Service of Canada in 1910, warships were given the prefix HMCS with the &quot;C&quot; representing Canadian as a way to differentiate Canadian from British warships. It was initially the only concession the British Admiralty made following the formation of the Canadian naval service. was the first ship with the HMCS designation after being transferred from the British Royal Navy to Canada, commissioned on 4 August 1910. became the first Canadian ship commissioned under a Queen during March 1952.

Many RCN shore facilities also bear the designation, such as , , , , and the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets summer training centre HMCS &quot;Quadra&quot;. 

Shore maintenance and mooring facilities bear the name His Majesty&#x27;s Canadian Dockyard (HMC Dockyard) (in French or ).

<doc id="342762" wikidata="Q1188875" url="?curid=342762" title="Nahal Brigade">
<text>The 933rd &quot;Nahal&quot; Brigade is one of the Israel Defense Forces&#x27; main infantry brigades. It has operated in all major wars and large-scale operations since its inception in 1982, playing key roles during the 1982 and the 2006 Lebanon Wars and the First and Second Intifadas.

==History==
It was established as a separate brigade in 1982, in response to the growing need for infantry manpower, before the 1982 Lebanon War. Its 50th battalion was originally part of the Paratrooper Brigade in the 1950s. It is formed mainly from regular draftees, as well as from a core of soldiers from the Nahal group, part of the Nahal movement, which combines social volunteerism, agriculture (historically the establishment of kibbutz farming communities) and military service. Many Mahal foreign volunteers are also known to serve in the Nahal Brigade, providing a highly motivated and disciplined core of soldiers for the brigade.

Nahal Brigade soldiers are distinguished by their light green berets, which earned them the nickname &quot;sticklights&quot; (Hebrew for glowsticks). The brigade is composed of four active-duty battalions – 50, 931, 932, and 934 (the Gadsar, Hebrew for &quot;reconnaissance battalion&quot;) – and the various companies on its training base, which together comprise Battalion 933.

It operates on a rotational basis on the most volatile Israeli borders (Lebanon, Syria and Gaza) as well as in the West Bank territories. It is tasked with regular patrol and observation operations on the borders, counter-terrorist operations and riot control in the West Bank as well as tactical assault support to police operations in the territories.

It has operated in all major wars and large-scale operations since its inception, playing key roles during the First and Second Lebanon War and the First and Second Intifada.

On 10 June 1982, the Israeli air force mistook a column of IDF Nahal forces for a Syrian commando unit. An IAF F-4 Phantom attacked the Battalion 931, advancing in open APCs in south-eastern Lebanon with cluster ammunition. The unit suffered 24 soldiers killed and 108 wounded, with a further 30 soldiers shell shocked.

 It was the worst friendly-fire incident in the history of the IDF.

On 4 September 1982, a four-member Palestinian squad attacked an observation post manned by eight soldiers from the Nahal brigade. All the Israeli soldiers surrendered without firing a single bullet. Israel was then forced, in two separate exchange deals, to release almost 6000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the captured Nahal soldiers. The deals were severely criticized in Israel, for being extremely &quot;lopsided&quot;. The less than heroic behaviour of the Nahal brigade soldiers was also pointed out. The Nahal Brigade Commander Gilboa went as far as branding the soldiers of his own brigade as &quot;eight cowards&quot;.

In November 1987, two PFLP-GC fighters managed to slip through the Lebanese-Israeli border on hang gliders. One of them was cornered and killed by the IDF. The second fighter, Miloud Najah from Tunisia, avoided capture and attacked an IDF base outside Kiryat Shemona in northern Israel, manned by Nahal brigade soldiers. In a two minutes exchange of fire, Najah succeeded in killing six Nahal soldiers and wounding another 10, before being killed himself. The Palestinian victory was widely celebrated in the Palestinian Occupied Territories and contributed to the outbreak of the First Intifada.

In November 2002 three Nahal soldiers were killed in an ambush in the Palestinian city of Hebron. Another nine IDF soldiers and security personnel were killed in the incident, including Col. Weinberg, the commander of the Hebron brigade, were killed in the clash. The battle was widely seen as a victory for the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, who lost three fighters in the incident.

From August 2019 to June 2021, the brigade was led by Yisrael Shomer. On 28 June, was appointed as the new commander. However, three days later, on 1 July, Asman suddenly died during morning training. As a result, Shomer was issued command again until a permanent replacement could be found.

=== Israel–Hamas war ===
On 7 October 2023, brigade commander Lt. Col. Yonatan Steinberg was killed during the Gaza War.

In April 2024, Nochi Mandel, the chief of staff of the Nahal Brigade, was dismissed following the World Central Kitchen aid convoy attack that killed seven aid workers. Mandel, a religious nationalist Israeli settler, had previously signed a letter calling for the flow of aid into Gaza to be restricted.

The Nahal Brigade has lost 67 soldiers and commanders during the war, including during the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel itself.

== Training ==

Nahal Infantry Brigade soldiers undertake around four months of basic training and around four months of advanced training in the Israeli desert.

=== Basic training ===

Consists primarily of physical conditioning, Krav Maga, rifle training and the qualifying obstacle course. Recruits begin their desert marches at this point in order to prepare them for their 70+ kilometers, depending on company beret march at the end of advanced training. These marches are performed fully kitted in order to prepare them for battlefield marching. Rifle training aims to perfect recruits&#x27; day and night shooting skills prior to advanced training.

Recruits undergo two-man team live firing exercises in the field. Weapon understanding and maintenance is an important element of basic rifle training. Recruits are taught army values and weapon safety and responsibility. Recruits are introduced to long field exercises in the desert. There they learn to survive for the first time on combat rations, limited water, extreme desert heat, sleep deprivation, and field injuries all while being subjected to intense physical activity. Camouflage, fortification construction, combat first aid, and stealth maneuvering will also be taught at this stage.

=== Advanced training ===

Recruits will be expected to be fully proficient with their rifles, both maintenance and shooting. Recruits displaying certain aptitudes will be sent on various specialist courses: sharpshooter training, squad automatic gunner training, tactical MATADOR-missile training, radio operator&#x27;s course, advanced camouflage and fortifications course, combat paramedic course,

All recruits learn how to conduct live-fire drills at a squad, platoon, and company level. Recruits learn how to operate both on open field battlefields, desert and mountain, and in urban terrain.

After advanced training soldiers undergo a further stage of specialist training, combined with border guarding. During this time soldiers will undergo advanced urban warfare training, advanced navigation training, open field and mountain fighting training,

== Brigade organization ==

* 933rd Infantry Brigade &quot;Nahal&quot;
** 50th Infantry Battalion &quot;Bazelet/Basalt&quot;
** 931st Infantry Battalion &quot;Shaham/Onyx&quot;
** 932nd Infantry Battalion &quot;Granit/Granite&quot;
** (934th) Patrol Battalion &quot;Topaz&quot;
** 7107th Combat Engineer Battalion &quot;Raz&quot; (Reserve)
** Logistics Battalion &quot;Nahal&quot;
** Signals Company &quot;Palhik/Agate&quot;
Battalions 931 and 932 are composed entirely of soldiers who draft through the Bakum.

Prior to 2006, both groups of prospective 50th battalion soldiers were required to pass a two-day &quot;gibbush&quot; (selection phase) before being drafted in order to get into the 50th Battalion. Part of the battalion&#x27;s training comprised a paratrooper course after advanced infantry training, hence &quot;Nahal Mutznaḥ&quot;, or &quot;Airborne Nahal&quot;, the name of the battalion before being transferred to the Nahal brigade. Since 2006, both the &quot;gibbush&quot; and the paratrooper course were dropped and the 50th became a regular infantry battalion. In 2010 Nahal soldiers from the 50th Battalion produced IDF Tick Tock, a viral video of themselves dancing as a flash mob in the streets of Hebron.

Soldiers in this battalion undergo an additional eight months of training in krav maga, urban combat, navigation, camouflage, parachuting and other specialized courses. During periods of low intensity conflict, the companies are tasked with capturing enemies of the state and serve as counter-terrorism forces, raiding terrorist homes and hideouts. Gadsar Nahal won the IDF Chief of Staff prize in 2010 for best land combat unit.

<doc id="342763" wikidata="Q646153" url="?curid=342763" title="Bavarian Geographer">
<text>The epithet &quot;Bavarian Geographer&quot; () is the conventional name for the anonymous author of a short Latin medieval text containing a list of the tribes in Central and Eastern Europe, headed .

The name &quot;Bavarian Geographer&quot; was first bestowed (in its French form, &quot;&quot;) in 1796 by Polish count and scholar Jan Potocki. The term is now also used at times to refer to the document itself.

It was the first Latin source to claim that all Slavs have originated from the same homeland, called the Zeriuani.

== Origin ==
The short document, written in Latin, was discovered in 1772 in the Bavarian State Library, Munich by Louis XV&#x27;s ambassador to the Saxon court, Comte Louis-Gabriel Du Buat-Nançay. It had been acquired by the Wittelsbachs with the collection of the antiquarian Hermann Schädel (1410–85) in 1571. The document was much discussed in the early 19th-century historiography, notably by Nikolai Karamzin and Joachim Lelewel.

The provenance of the document is disputed. Although early commentators suggested that it could have been compiled in Regensburg, the list seems to have been taken from , recorded in the 9th century in the library of the Reichenau Abbey and named after a local librarian. Based on these findings, Bernhard Bischoff attributes it to a monk active at Reichenau from the 830s to 850s. Aleksandr Nazarenko finds it more probable that the list was composed in the 870s, when Saint Methodius is believed to have resided at Reichenau. The document may have been connected with his missions in the Slavic lands. Henryk Łowmiański demonstrated that the list consists of two parts, which may be datable to different periods and attributed to distinct authors.

In modern times, some scholars attribute the information from this document to be limited, because it is largely geographic in nature, and its understanding of Eastern European geography is limited, so it may be a case of cosmography.

== Content ==
The document has a short introductory sentence and a list of 58 tribal names in Central and Eastern Europe, east of the Elbe and north of the Danube to the Volga River to the Black Sea and Caspian Sea (most of them of Slavonic origin, with &quot;Ruzzi&quot;, and others such as &quot;Vulgarii&quot;, etc.). Absent on the list are Polans, Pomeranians and Masovians, tribes first of whom are believed to have settled along the shores of the Warta river during the 8th century, as well Dulebes, Volhynians and White Croats, but instead mentioning several unknown tribes hard to identify. There is also some information about the number of strongholds () possessed by some of the tribes, however the number in several instances seems exaggerated. The list consists of two parts, first describing the tribes in the Eastern neighborhood of Francia (&quot;iste sunt regiones ... nostris&quot;), while the second or near or outside the zone of the first going in different directions. The tribes can be geographically grouped into Danubian, Silesian-Lusatian, Baltic, and Eastern Vistulan-Caspian.

=== List of tribes ===
According to Łowmiański (1958), in the first list are mentioned:
* 1. &quot;Nortabtrezi&quot; (Obotrites), 
* 2. &quot;Uuilci&quot; (Veleti), 
* 3. &quot;Linaa&quot; (Linones), 
* 4.–6.&quot;Bethenici&quot;-&quot;Smeldingon&quot; (Smeldingi)-&quot;Morizani&quot;, 
* 7. &quot;Hehfeldi&quot; (Hevelli), 
* 8. &quot;Surbi&quot; (Sorbs/Serbs), 
* 9. &quot;Talaminzi&quot; (Daleminzi-Glomacze), 
* 10. &quot;Beheimare&quot; (Bohemians), 
* 11. &quot;Marharii&quot; (Moravians), 
* 12. &quot;Uulgarii&quot; (Bulgars), 
* 13. &quot;Merehanos&quot; (Nitra Moravians).

In the second list are mentioned:

<text>Clea Helen D&#x27;Etienne DuVall (born September 25, 1977) is an American actress, director and screenwriter. Her film appearances include &quot;The Faculty&quot; (1998); &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot;; &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; (both 1999); &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; (2001); &quot;Identity;&quot; &quot;21 Grams&quot; (both 2003); &quot;The Grudge&quot; (2004); &quot;Zodiac&quot; (2007); and &quot;Argo&quot; (2012). On television, DuVall starred as Emma Borden in &quot;Lizzie Borden Took an Ax&quot; (2014) and its miniseries spinoff, &quot;The Lizzie Borden Chronicles&quot; (2015). Her other credits include &quot;Carnivàle&quot; (2003–2005), &quot;Heroes&quot; (2006–2007), &quot;American Horror Story&quot; (2012–2013), &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; (2015–2017), &quot;Veep&quot; (2016–2019), and &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; (2018–2022). She also voiced Elsa on Fox&#x27;s &quot;HouseBroken&quot;, which she co-created, from 2021 to 2023.

DuVall&#x27;s directorial work includes the features &quot;The Intervention&quot; (2016) and &quot;Happiest Season&quot; (2020). She is the creator, writer, and executive producer of the Amazon Freevee series &quot;High School&quot; (2022).

==Early life==
DuVall was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. Her forename derives from the novel &quot;Clea&quot; by Lawrence Durrell. She worked in a coffee shop as a teenager and studied at the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts.

==Career==

=== 1996–2000: Career beginnings ===

DuVall made her screen debut in the low-budget horror film &quot;Little Witches&quot; (1996). This was followed by small roles in several independent features, as well as guest appearances on episodes of &quot;ER&quot; and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. Her breakthrough came in 1998 when she starred in Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s sci-fi horror film &quot;The Faculty&quot;, receiving positive reviews for her portrayal of &quot;Stokes&quot; Mitchell, a goth high school student. Also that year, she had a supporting role in the teen comedy &quot;Can&#x27;t Hardly Wait&quot;, which later developed a cult following.

DuVall had roles in several films released in 1999, including biographical drama &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;, where she appeared as compulsive liar Georgina Tuskin; teen romantic comedy &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot;, which opened atop the U.S. box office; and the independent features &quot;Wildflowers&quot; and &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot;. The latter, a satirical comedy in which she played a lesbian undergoing conversion therapy, is often cited as a favorite among fans of LGBT cinema. For her work in &quot;Wildflowers&quot;, a drama about a 17-year-old obsessed with finding her birth mother, DuVall received rave reviews, with Barry Johnson noting in his appraisal for &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Clea DuVall has those deep, round, chestnut eyes that convey years of experience with a solitary glance … [she] always seems to capture that unique blend of wisdom and naiveté … [here she] takes center stage in an impressive, nuanced performance that makes use of [her] magnetic screen presence&quot;.

=== 2001–2015: Film and television roles ===

DuVall had prominent parts in a variety of film projects throughout the early 2000s, such as &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; (2001), a space Western directed by John Carpenter; the ensemble drama &quot;Thirteen Conversations About One Thing&quot; (2001); &quot;The Laramie Project&quot; (2002), a documentary-style dramatisation of the murder of Matthew Shepard; coming-of-age sports drama &quot;The Slaughter Rule&quot; (2002); the James Mangold–directed mystery thriller &quot;Identity&quot; (2003); and the psychological crime drama &quot;21 Grams&quot; (2003), the English-language film debut of Alejandro González Iñárritu. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Elvis Mitchell called the latter &quot;a ruminative, stunned look at life after death – that is, the existence of the living after they have been devastated by loss&quot;, noting that &quot;The actors [don&#x27;t] sink to theatrical histrionics; instead they&#x27;re linked by the red-eyed, unblinking stare of zombies, and they shamble through their day-by-day activities as if saddled with death wishes they are too enervated to act upon&quot;.

DuVall appeared as a regular cast member on the HBO drama series &quot;Carnivàle&quot; between 2003 and 2005, with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; pointing out that her portrayal of tarot card reader Sophie was &quot;especially good&quot;. During that period, she also starred in the television film &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; (2004), earning a Satellite Award nomination for Best Actress, and in the horror film &quot;The Grudge&quot; (2004), which grossed US$187million at the box office. Subsequent credits included guest appearances on &quot;&quot; (2005), &quot;Lie to Me&quot; (2009), &quot;Numb3rs&quot;, &quot;Bones&quot;, and &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (all 2010), as well as key parts in films such as David Fincher&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Zodiac&quot; (2007), and the recurring role of Audrey Hanson on the NBC science fiction series &quot;Heroes&quot; (2006–2007).

After appearances in the psychological thrillers &quot;Anamorph&quot; (2007) and &quot;Passengers&quot; (2008), and a supporting role in the legal drama &quot;Conviction&quot; (2010), DuVall co-starred in Ben Affleck&#x27;s &quot;Argo&quot; (2012), a political thriller based on the Iran hostage crisis. For her portrayal of Cora Amburn-Lijek, one of the six American diplomats rescued from Iran in 1980, DuVall was awarded—alongside her co-stars—the SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture the following year. Also in 2012, she appeared in a recurring role on the second season of the FX anthology series &quot;American Horror Story&quot;, playing Wendy Peyser. Writing for &quot;Slate&quot;, Alyssa Rosenberg said of her work in the latter projects, &quot;Where DuVall often played strong, even aggressive characters in the past, in both &quot;American Horror Story&quot; and &quot;Argo&quot;, she&#x27;s turned in good performances by playing deeply vulnerable people trying to be strong in threatening circumstances&quot;.

DuVall starred as Emma Borden, sister of Lizzie Borden—played by Christina Ricci—in the Lifetime television film &quot;Lizzie Borden Took an Ax&quot; (2014), reprising the role for the limited series &quot;The Lizzie Borden Chronicles&quot; the following year. The latter received mixed reviews, but critics praised the performances of Ricci and DuVall; writing for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Keith Uhlich said the actresses &quot;have a delectable rapport not too far removed from Bette Davis and Joan Crawford at their hag-horror peak in &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot;&quot;

=== Since 2016: Directorial debut and subsequent work ===

DuVall made her feature directorial debut with &quot;The Intervention&quot; (2016), which she also wrote, starred in, and produced. Acquired by Paramount Pictures after its premiere at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival, the comedy-drama was positively reviewed; Andy Webster of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;DuVall juggles the emotional dynamics with fluid editing and light comic touches&quot;. That same year, she starred in the independent features &quot;Zen Dogs&quot; and &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Floor&quot;, and guest-starred in three episodes of AMC&#x27;s &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;.

From 2016 to 2019, DuVall played Marjorie Palmiotti on the HBO political satire &quot;Veep&quot;, for which she was twice nominated—alongside her co-stars—for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series, winning in 2018. She also starred in the independent comedy-drama &quot;All About Nina&quot; (2018), and played Sylvia in several episodes of the dystopian Hulu drama series &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; between 2018 and 2022, with Judy Berman of &quot;Time&quot; calling it &quot;the best work of [DuVall&#x27;s career]&quot;.

DuVall wrote and directed the 2020 film &quot;Happiest Season&quot;, a romantic comedy, which premiered on Hulu to a positive critical reception, later winning the 2021 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film. She is the creator, writer, director, and executive producer of the coming-of-age drama series &quot;High School&quot;, which premiered on Amazon Freevee in October 2022. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it one of the best shows of the year, writing in their review, &quot;[DuVall captures] the thrilling, horrifying, profoundly uncomfortable experience of adolescence&quot;.

==Personal life==
DuVall is a lesbian. She came out to close relations when she was 16, publicly coming out in 2016. DuVall has said that she was &quot;very closeted&quot; while making &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot;. She is close friends with Melanie Lynskey and Natasha Lyonne, with whom she worked on &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot; and &quot;The Intervention&quot;. DuVall is married and lives in Los Angeles.

<text>8-Bit Sampled Voice (8SVX) is an audio file format standard developed by Electronic Arts for the Amiga computer series. It is a data subtype of the IFF file container format. It typically contains linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) digital audio.

== Description ==
The 8SVX subtype stores 8-bit audio data within chunks contained within an IFF file container. 8SVX subtypes can exist alone within IFF file containers (audio only), or can be multiplexed together with other IFF subtypes, such as video animation streams.

Metadata about the 8SVX data stream is contained in separate descriptor chunks that come prior to the main data body chunk. Sample rate, volume and compression type are described in a &quot;VHDR&quot; chunk. Various other chunks are available to describe the name, author and copyright.

8SVX supports features such as attack, release and section repeat, which are useful for storage of musical instrument samples.

An example layout of an audio-only 8SVX IFF audio file:
== Encoding ==
The majority of 8SVX data streams are encoded using uncompressed linear PCM streams. Optionally, Fibonacci-delta lossy data compression is also available, resulting in a 50% compression ratio at the cost of decreased fidelity. Multi-byte values are stored in big-endian format, the native byte order for the Motorola 68000 family.

== Support ==
IFF-8SVX encoded audio was the default audio format for the Commodore Amiga. Most audio programs for the Amiga supported the format. AmigaOS 3.0 introduced a multimedia framework using the datatype subsystem that included an 8SVX decoder (8SVX.datatype).

Many sound editing programs and music tracker programs of the late 1980s and early 1990s supported the format. It is still a common format for cross-platform audio editing programs (such as Sound eXchange).

8SVX support is also available to modern programs via libavcodec (and the related ffdshow codec package) as well as via libsndfile.

== Legacy ==
The Commodore Amiga computer series never received native hardware support for 16-bit digital audio before the decline of the platform. As such, the related 16SVX and MAUD subtypes never saw wide adoption.

Apple Computer developed a separate subtype known as AIFF which included support for 16-bit samples and additional compression types. It superseded 8SVX as the dominant audio subtype for IFF files.

Microsoft and IBM co-developed the RIFF file container and the related WAVE audio subtype for Windows. Both formats are heavily influenced by the IFF/8SVX container format, but like AIFF, were extended to support higher bit-depths and additional compression types.

<text>Royal Air Force Halton, or more simply RAF Halton, is one of the largest Royal Air Force stations in the United Kingdom. It is located near the village of Halton near Wendover, Buckinghamshire. The site has been in use since the First World War but is due to close by December 2027.

==History==

The first recorded military aviation at Halton took place in 1913 when the then owner of the Halton estate, Alfred de Rothschild, invited No 3 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps to conduct manoeuvres on his land. Following a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement between Rothschild and Lord Kitchener, the estate was used by the British Army throughout the First World War. In 1916 the Royal Flying Corps moved its air mechanics school from Farnborough, Hampshire to Halton, and in 1917, the school was permanently accommodated in workshops built by German PoWs.

The estate was purchased by the British Government for the nascent Royal Air Force at the end of the First World War for £112,000.

In 1919 Lord Trenchard established the No. 1 School of Technical Training at RAF Halton for RAF aircraft apprentices, which remained at the station until it moved to RAF Cosford in the early 1990s. Also in 1919, Halton House – a French-style mansion built for Lionel de Rothschild – was re-opened as the station&#x27;s Officers&#x27; Mess, a role which the grade II listed building continues as today.

During the Second World War, RAF Halton continued its training role. Additionally No 112 Squadron and No 402 Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force were based at Halton for part of the war. No. 1448 (Radar Calibration) Flight was converted into No. 529 Squadron at Halton in June 1943. Initially, the squadron flew the Cierva C.30 and the de Havilland Hornet Moth and by the end of the war, the squadron was competent with autogyro aircraft.

In July 1952 the uncrowned Queen Elizabeth II performed one of her first duties as Sovereign by presenting a colour to Number 1 School of Technical Training; the first to be awarded to an apprentice school, and the first to be presented to an &#x27;other rank&#x27; when Sergeant Apprentice Hines, of the 63rd Entry, received the colour from Her Majesty.

In 1967, RAF Halton was the site of the unsolved case of the murder of aircraftswoman Rita Ellis. The case was reopened in 2010 to take advantage of modern forensic techniques, and in 2017 a new DNA profile enabled the police to eliminate 200 of the original suspects. In late 2020, the Thames Valley Police&#x27;s major crime review team issued a further appeal for anyone with information to come forward.

When No. 1 School of Technical Training moved to RAF Cosford in 1993, they took over guardianship of the Queen&#x27;s Colour and on 31 October 1997, Her Majesty presented RAF Halton with its second colour. RAF Halton was the only station to be granted the dignity of two Queen&#x27;s colours. The move of No. 1 School of Technical Training to RAF Cosford afforded space for the RAF School of Recruit Training to be moved from RAF Swinderby to RAF Halton in July 1993, where it has been ever since. In the year 2004–2005, RAF Halton trained 24,000 personnel, though not all were Phase 1 recruits; some were attending the Airman&#x27;s Command School which trains Non-Commissioned Officers (NCO) in Phase 2 and 3 disciplines.

From 1917 to 1963, a spur railway line ran from Wendover to Halton to supply coal and goods to the station.

The history of the RAF station and specifically apprenticeship training over the years is preserved by the Trenchard Museum located at RAF Halton, and managed by the RAF Halton Apprentices Association. In 2010 a major project by members of the station re-excavated the training trenches used during the First World War and made them available as an educational exhibit.

No. 613 Volunteer Gliding Squadron, which operated the Grob Vigilant T1, was disbanded in November 2016 by the MoD as part of its Better Defence Estate strategy.

In July 2018, the headquarters of the Logistics Specialist Training Wing (LSTW) relocated to the new Defence College of Logistics, Policing and Administration at Worthy Down Camp in Hampshire. The remaining element of the LSTW, the Logistics Supply Training Squadron, moved to Worthy Down over the months following 24 October 2019.

The following units were here at some point:

** RAF Police School
** No. 6 RAF Police Squadron
** Special Investigation Branch

=== RAF Hospital Halton ===

Princess Mary&#x27;s RAF Hospital Halton was opened in 1927 as a large purpose-built military hospital, replacing an earlier makeshift medical facility housed in wooden huts that had been opened in 1919. The hospital was the second unit in the United Kingdom to have a renal facility, and besides developing a cure for Sandfly fever, the hospital was the first in the world to use penicillin on a large scale in 1940, just after its discovery.

The hospital was closed in 1995 due to Government defence cuts. The buildings remained derelict until 2008 when they were demolished for new housing in a development called &quot;Princess Mary Gate&quot;.

=== Airfield ===
The site has a grass airfield, used mainly by gliders, light aircraft, microlights and the RAF hot air balloon. The airfield is the home of the Royal Air Force Gliding &amp; Soaring Association, Chilterns Gliding Centre, The Halton Aero Club and the RAF Halton Microlight Club.

The airfield was also used as the filming location for the German airfield in Wonder Woman.

== Future ==
On 7 November 2016, in a speech to the House of Commons by the Defence Secretary, it was announced that the RAF Halton airfield would cease to be part of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) estate and was scheduled to be disposed of by 2022. The following month, a letter from the Defence Secretary to MP David Lidington confirmed the planned phases prior to disposal of the site:

* Phase 1 – Airfield disposal.
* Phase 2 – Relocation of School of Recruit Training and Airmen&#x27;s Command School to RAF College Cranwell.
* Phase 3 – Relocation / rationalisation of lodger units.

On 28 February 2019, after a revision of the Defence Estates Optimisation Plan, MoD minister Tobias Ellwood MP announced that RAF Halton would not close until at least 2025. This was confirmed in letters sent from the Defence Infrastructure Organisation in May 2019 to local residents, stating that phased withdrawal would commence in 2022 with full disposal achieved in 2025. This was later extended with the airfield not closing until 2027.

Following a public consultation, Buckinghamshire Council’s Cabinet agreed a Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for RAF Halton. The SPD will inform the planning and development decisions for RAF Halton near Wendover once it ceases to be a military base in 2027.

<text>Marlborough ( , ) is a market town and civil parish in the English county of Wiltshire on the Old Bath Road, the old main road from London to Bath. The town is on the River Kennet, 24 miles (39 km) north of Salisbury and 10 miles (16 km) southeast of Swindon.

==History==
The earliest sign of human habitation is the Marlborough Mound, a prehistoric tumulus in the grounds of Marlborough College. Recent radiocarbon dating has found it to date from about 2400 BC. It is of similar age to the larger Silbury Hill about west of the town. Legend has it that the Mound is the burial site of Merlin and that the name of the town comes from Merlin&#x27;s Barrow. More plausibly, the town&#x27;s name possibly derives from the medieval term for chalky ground &quot;marl&quot;—thus, &quot;town on chalk&quot;. However more recent research, from geographer John Everett-Heath, identifies the original Anglo-Saxon place name as &quot;Merleberge&quot;, with a derivation from either the personal name of &quot;Mærle&quot; (&quot;Merlin&quot;) combined with &quot;beorg&quot; (hill), or &quot;meargealla beorg&quot;: hill where gentian grows. On John Speed&#x27;s map of Wiltshire (1611), the town&#x27;s name is recorded as &quot;Marlinges boroe&quot;. The town&#x27;s motto is &quot;Ubi nunc sapientis ossa Merlini&quot; (&quot;Where now are the bones of wise Merlin&quot;).

Further evidence of human occupation comes from the discovery in St Margaret&#x27;s Mead of the Marlborough Bucket, an Iron Age burial bucket made of fir wood with three iron hoops, a top bar and two handles; it also sports bronze bands decorated with human heads and mythical animals, and is now on display at the Wiltshire Museum in Devizes.

Roman remains and the large Mildenhall Hoard of coins have been found two miles to the east of Marlborough, at Mildenhall (Cunetio). A later Saxon settlement grew up around The Green and two early river crossings were made at Isbury Lane and Stonebridge Lane.

In 1067 William the Conqueror assumed control of the Marlborough area and set about building a wooden motte-and-bailey castle, sited on the prehistoric mound. This was completed in around 1100. Stone was used to strengthen the castle in around 1175. The first written record of Marlborough dates from the Domesday Book in 1086. William also established a mint in Marlborough, which coined the William I and the early William II silver pennies. The coins display the name of the town as Maerlebi or Maerleber.
He also established the neighbouring Savernake Forest as a favourite royal hunting ground and Marlborough castle became a Royal residence. Henry I observed Easter here in 1110. Henry II stayed at Marlborough castle in talks with the King of Scotland. His son, Richard I (&quot;Coeur de Lion&quot;) gave the castle to his brother John, in 1186. King John was married here and spent time in Marlborough, where he established a Treasury.

In 1204 King John granted Charter to the Borough which permitted an annual eight-day fair, commencing on 14 August, the vigil of the Feast of the Assumption of Our Lady (15 August), in which &quot;all might enjoy the liberties and quittances customary in the fair at Winchester&quot;. He also established that weekly markets may be held on Wednesdays and Saturdays. These continue to this day.

Henry III held Parliament here, in 1267, when the Statute of Marlborough was passed (this gave rights and privileges to small land owners and limited the right of the King to take possession of land). This law states that no-one shall seize his neighbour&#x27;s goods for alleged wrong without permission of the Court. Apart from Charters, it is the oldest statute in English law which has not yet been repealed.

A Jewish community lived in the town from the 1230s, near Silver Street (now Silverless Street) and established a synagogue. In January 1275, Eleanor of Provence expelled Jews from all of the towns within her dower lands, and the Jews of Marlborough relocated to Devizes.
The castle fell into disrepair by the end of the 14th century but remained Crown property. Edward VI then passed it to the Seymour family, his mother&#x27;s relatives. In 1498 Thomas Wolsey was ordained priest in (the now redundant) St Peter&#x27;s church. He later rose to become a cardinal and Lord Chancellor.

In 1642 Marlborough&#x27;s peace was shattered by the English Civil War. The Seymours held the Castle for the King but the town was for Parliament. With his headquarters in nearby Oxford, King Charles had to deal with Marlborough. &quot;A Town the most notoriously disaffected of all that Country, otherwise, saving the obstinacy and malice of the inhabitants, in the situation of it very unfit for a garrison... this place the King saw would prove quickly an ill neighbour to him, not only as it was in the heart of a rich County, and so would straighten him, and even infest his quarters.&quot;

The King sent Lord Digby who left Oxford to take the town at the head of four hundred horse on 24 November 1642. When he arrived, he chose to parley first, thus giving the inhabitants a chance to prepare defences and to recruit troops. They mustered about seven hundred poorly armed men. At this point, the town issued a reply to Digby: &quot;The King&#x27;s Majesty, providing he were attended in Royal and not in war like wise, should be as welcome to that town as ever was Prince to People; but as to delivering up the good Town of Marlborough to such a traitor as Lord Digby ... they would sooner die&quot;. After some early skirmishes, Royalist troops infiltrated the town down its small alleyways. The town was captured and looted and many buildings were set ablaze. One hundred and twenty prisoners were marched in chains to Oxford. The town was later abandoned by the King and took no further part in the war.
On 28 April 1653 the Great Fire of Marlborough started in a tanner&#x27;s yard and spread quickly, eventually after four hours burning the Guildhall, St Mary&#x27;s Church, the County Armoury, and 244 houses to the ground. This event attracted more than local attention; the parish register of Wotton-under-Edge, in the west of Gloucestershire, records on 9 August 1653 that 18 pounds 17 shillings and six and a half pence had been collected in the parish for the relief of the distressed inhabitants of Marlborough. During the rebuilding of the town after the Great Fire, the high street was widened and is often claimed to be the widest in England though the actual widest is in Stockton-on-Tees. This wide street allows ample space for the local market. Fire swept through the town again in 1679 and 1690. This time, an Act of Parliament was passed &quot;to prohibit the covering of houses and other buildings with thatch in the Town of Marlborough&quot;.

In 1804 the Marlborough White Horse was cut on a downland slope southwest of the town, by boys from Mr Greasley&#x27;s Academy in the High Street.

In 1901 and 1934 the boundaries of the borough were extended to include the hamlet of Preshute (which was separated from Preshute civil parish) and the village of Manton, both to the west of the town. Marlborough Town Hall was completed in 1902.

In 2004 Marlborough celebrated 800 years of its Town Charter. Among the celebrations were a street play by the Marlborough Players titled &quot;Wheels of Time,&quot; and a visit from the Prince of Wales.

==Events==
The Marlborough mop fair was originally a market where local goods could be sold or bartered. It later developed into a hiring fair for agricultural workers seeking employment, but now has become a travelling funfair. It takes place over two weekends in October, as the &quot;big mop&quot; and &quot;little mop&quot; fairs. In 2014 these were set for 3–4 and 17–18 October.

From 1986 a music festival was held in the town for a number of days in June or July. In 1997 this became the Marlborough International Jazz Festival, which ceased after 2016.

==Notable buildings==
The parish church of St Mary is Grade I listed building.

St George&#x27;s church in Preshute, adjoining Manton dates from the 12th century and was substantially restored in 1854 by T.H. Wyatt. It is Grade II* listed.

The Church of St Peter and St Paul at the west end of the High Street is Grade II* listed. It dates from the 15th century and was partly rebuilt by T.H. Wyatt in 1862–3. Cardinal Wolsey was ordained priest here in 1498.

On the north side of the high street is the Merchant&#x27;s House, which is currently under restoration but part of which is open to the public for guided tours on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays from April to October. The house was built following the Great Fire of 1653. It was the property of a silk merchant and, rarely for a house of this type in a town centre, retains its original room pattern. Notable are the wall paintings recently uncovered, which are undergoing conservation. One room painted in a striped pattern, copying silk hangings, is perhaps unique in Great Britain.

==Governance==
Marlborough is within the county of Wiltshire, and the administrative district of the same name. For local government purposes, it is administered by the Wiltshire Council unitary authority. Since the local boundary review of 2020, the parish has two wards – Marlborough East and Marlborough West. Marlborough and Manton collectively form a civil parish with a parish council known as the Marlborough Town Council, which has 16 councillors.

For elections to Wiltshire Council, the civil parish is covered by two electoral divisions, again named Marlborough East and Marlborough West, which each elect one member. They include large areas outside the town, the West division extending beyond Avebury. Prior to 2009, Marlborough was administered by Wiltshire County Council at the county level and the Kennet District Council.

Marlborough was part of the Devizes constituency until 2024, when it was placed in the new East Wiltshire constituency; it has been represented in the House of Commons since 2019 by Danny Kruger, a Conservative. Its representative has been a Conservative since 1924.

==Education==

Marlborough College, an independent boarding school, is on the west side of the town.

The town&#x27;s local authority secondary school, St John&#x27;s Academy had been considered an above average school and sixth form college by Ofsted, and in the June 2014 report it was considered outstanding. It was formed when the former Marlborough Grammar School and secondary modern school were amalgamated. There is also a primary school, St Mary&#x27;s.

==Sport==
Marlborough is home to Marlborough Rugby Club, who completed their most successful season in recent history in the 2009–10 South West Division Dorset &amp; Wilts 1 North league, winning all 22 games to secure promotion to the Southern Counties South league. In 2018, the first XV has competed in South West 1 East and in 2023, they were Regional 2 South East champions, winning promotion to tier 5 for the first time. The club has a second XV senior team as well as many junior players.

Marlborough Town F.C. play their home games at Elcot Lane, to the east of the town, and are members of the Wiltshire League. There is a youth football club, Marlborough Youth FC, with over 350 players that play in the North Wiltshire Youth Football League. There is a cricket team whose 1st X1 compete in the WEPL Wiltshire Premier Division.

Marlborough Hockey Club play at Marlborough College. A parkrun takes place on Marlborough Common every Saturday.

==Religion==

The town is at the heart of the Church of England Marlborough deanery in the diocese of Salisbury in the province of Canterbury. The rural dean has responsibility for the benefices of Marlborough, Ridgeway, Upper Kennet and Whitton which in total comprise 16 parishes. Of the town&#x27;s two Church of England parish churches, St Peter&#x27;s has been made redundant and converted into an arts centre. St Mary&#x27;s, a Grade I listed building, remains in use for worship.

The renowned jockey Sir Gordon Richards is buried in the new cemetery on Marlborough Common, the second of two such cemeteries to be opened after the two old churchyards stopped being used for burials.

==Media==
Local TV services are provided by BBC West and ITV West Country, via the Mendip transmitter and a local relay. Radio stations for the area are BBC Radio Wiltshire on 104.9 FM and Heart West on 96.5 FM. The local newspaper for the area is the Gazette and Herald.

==Transport==
Although once served by two railway lines (the Great Western Railway and the Midland and South Western Junction Railway) the town no longer has any direct rail access. The nearest stations are Pewsey (6.7 miles), Bedwyn (6.9 miles), and Swindon (12.7 miles).
Marlborough is well connected by road with the A4 from Hungerford to Calne, A346 from Tidworth to Swindon and A345 from Salisbury meeting there.

The long-distance National Trail, the Wessex Ridgeway, runs from Marlborough to Lyme Regis in Dorset.

==Climate==
Marlborough has an oceanic climate somewhat influenced by its inland position and at elevation is more prone to frost than southern coastal areas. For example, in 1909 the town reported the equal lowest temperature in the UK at a station below for that year, with a temperature of on 3 March.

<text>Citizens Bank Park is a baseball stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the city&#x27;s South Philadelphia Sports Complex. Home to Major League Baseball&#x27;s Philadelphia Phillies, the stadium opened April 3, 2004, and hosted its first regular-season baseball game nine days later, with the Phillies losing to the Cincinnati Reds, 4–1. It is named after Citizens Financial Group.

The 42,901-seat ballpark was built to replace the 33-year-old Veterans Stadium, a multipurpose football and baseball facility that was demolished in 2004. Citizens Bank Park features a natural grass-and-dirt playing field and Philadelphia-style food stands that serve cheesesteak sandwiches, hoagies, Tastykakes, soft pretzels, Yards and Yuengling beer, and other regional specialties.

The ballpark sits on the northeast corner of the Sports Complex, which includes Lincoln Financial Field, Wells Fargo Center, and Xfinity Live!, the Center&#x27;s theme park and food court.

==History==
===Planning===

In 1999, the owners of the Phillies and the Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL joined their western Pennsylvania counterparts, the owners of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Steelers, in asking state and local governments to replace Veterans Stadium and Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh with separate baseball and football stadiums. Pressure for new Philadelphia stadiums increased after a railing collapsed at &quot;The Vet&quot; during the 1998 Army–Navy Game, injuring eight cadets. The Pirates owners threatened to leave Pittsburgh in 1997, helping to convince the state legislature to approve funding for the four proposed stadiums. With their architectural plans already in place, Allegheny County and the City of Pittsburgh approved the pacts swiftly. Still, debate among Philadelphia&#x27;s city leaders continued into 2001, when Pittsburgh opened its stadiums (PNC Park for the Pirates and Heinz Field for the Steelers). The Eagles ultimately agreed to the site of a former food warehouse slightly southeast of Veterans Stadium. Lincoln Financial Field celebrated its grand opening in August 2003.

The Phillies originally sought to build a downtown ballpark similar to Baltimore&#x27;s, Denver&#x27;s, Cincinnati&#x27;s, Cleveland&#x27;s, Detroit&#x27;s and San Francisco&#x27;s. Various locations were proposed, including Broad and Spring Garden streets; Spring Garden and Delaware Avenue; and next to 30th Street Station on the site of the former main post office. The team and the city announced that the site would be at 13th and Vine streets in Chinatown, just north of Interstate 676, within walking distance of Center City. There was considerable support for a downtown ball park from business and labor and the city at large. But Chinatown residents protested, fearing a new ballpark would destroy their neighborhood. The City and team eventually settled on building the ballpark at the South Philadelphia Sports Complex on the site of another abandoned food warehouse. In the years that followed, residents, fans, and owner Bill Giles expressed regret that the new ballpark was not located in Center City Philadelphia. Still, the team set attendance records in 2010 (3,647,249 fans, averaging 45,028) with all home games sold out for the first time in the team&#x27;s 81-year history, extending a sellout streak dating to July 2009 to 123.

Chief architect of the new stadium was EwingCole&#x27;s Stanley Cole. The new park&#x27;s design was unveiled at a groundbreaking ceremonies on June 28, 2001. After the game that evening, the location of the left-field foul pole, from home plate, was unveiled at the outset of the team&#x27;s annual Fourth of July fireworks display. On June 17, 2003, Citizens Bank agreed to a 25-year, US $95 million deal for the park&#x27;s naming rights and advertising on billboards, telecasts, radio broadcasts, and publications. The ballpark was officially topped off on August 12, 2003, and opened in April 2004.

===Modifications===
Shortly after the park opened in 2004, the bullpens were reassigned so the Phillies&#x27; pitchers used the lower pen and visitors used the upper pen. This was done to give Phillies&#x27; pitchers a better view of the game and to protect them from heckling by fans. However, the team forgot to rewire the bullpen phones after the bullpens were reassigned, so during the first game, the dugout coaches had to communicate with the bullpens by hand signals.

In its first years, Citizens Bank Park allowed 218 home runs in 2004 and 201 in 2005, more than half to left-field. After the 2005 season, the left-field wall was moved back .

Even with these modifications, the park has a reputation as one of the most hitter-friendly parks in baseball. In 2009, it gave up 149 home runs, the most in the National League and second in the majors behind only the new Yankee Stadium, but has been neutral since, with a .997 park factor in 2011.

=== Events ===
*April 12, 2004, 1:32 PM: Randy Wolf of the Phillies threw the first regular-season pitch at Citizens Bank Park to D&#x27;Angelo Jiménez of the Cincinnati Reds, who got the park&#x27;s first hit, a lead-off ground-rule double.

Bobby Abreu of the Phillies hit the first home run in the bottom of the first inning, which also served as the franchise&#x27;s first hit at Citizens Bank Park.

*October 29, 2008, 9:58 PM: In Game 5 of the 2008 World Series, Phillies closer Brad Lidge struck out Eric Hinske of the Rays to complete a 4–3 victory and clinch the Phillies&#x27; second World Series championship in franchise history.

==Features==
===Ashburn Alley===
Behind center field is Ashburn Alley, named for Phillies Hall of Fame center fielder Richie Ashburn, who played for the team from 1948 to 1959 and was a Phillies broadcaster from 1963 until his death in 1997. It is seen by Phillies fans as a sop to their desire to see the stadium named for Ashburn.

Ashburn Alley is named for the slightly-overgrown grass that bordered the third base line at Shibe Park, where Ashburn was famous for laying down bunts that stayed fair. The new Ashburn Alley, located near Ashburn&#x27;s defensive position, is a walkway with restaurants, games and memorabilia from Phillies history. Ashburn Alley also has a memorabilia shop and a large bronze statue of Ashburn directly behind center field, as well as the U.S. flag, the flags of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the City of Philadelphia, a POW/MIA flag, and the flags from the Phillies&#x27; championships.

In 2004 and 2005, organist Paul Richardson performed from Ashburn Alley, as Citizens Bank Park was built without an organ booth.

===Other attractions===

*CP Rankin and Hall of Fame Clubs: Two premium seating areas in the park. The CP Rankin Club, located behind home plate, includes an air-conditioned indoor club area with exclusive food and souvenir shops where ticket holders can watch batting practice on either side of the club (especially on rainy days). There are a total of 1,164 seats in the CP Rankin Club. A second level, called the Hall of Fame Club, is located between Sections 212 through 232. This air-conditioned area features exclusive food and souvenir stands akin to The CP Rankin Club, and also houses memorabilia from the teams&#x27; past going back to the 1880s, along with memorabilia from the Philadelphia Athletics. The Hall of Fame Club contains 6,600 seats. In addition to being an attraction to fans, the Hall of Fame level also houses the A/V crew on the first-base side of that level that controls the scoreboard and all other monitors throughout the park and is where Dan Baker announces the game, as well as the press box, television, and radio booths.
*High and Inside Pub: Located on the Terrace Level behind home plate, the area is open to groups before the ballgame, and the public once the games start.
*Liberty Bell: Standing above street level, this by mechanical, lighted replica of the Liberty Bell &quot;rings&quot; and lights up after every Phillies home run and victory. In recent years, the Phillies have promoted the hashtag &quot;#RingTheBell&quot;.
*New Era Phillies Team Store and &#x27;47 Alley Store: The team store is open year-round, and serves as the starting point for tours of the ballpark. The bi-level store features regular merchandise on the first level and player jerseys as well as Phanatic-themed items on the second level, while the Alley Store is open during all home games and features authentic replicas of older Phillies jerseys made by the famous Philadelphia retailer of vintage uniform shirts and caps, Mitchell and Ness, as well as other items. During the off-season, customizable jerseys are available in the main store when a stand next to the store is open during the season.
*McFadden&#x27;s Bar and Grille: Open year-round, this restaurant combined the McFadden&#x27;s and Zanzibar Blue menus at the Third Base Gate. Since its opening, it has become a popular post-game (or event) site for the nearby Wells Fargo Center and Lincoln Financial Field. Closed in 2018.
*Pass and Stow: Located at the former site of McFadden&#x27;s Bar and Grille. Pass and Stow is an indoor bar and restaurant while also consisting of an outdoor bar and pizza oven. It is located inside of the entrance of the third base gate. Opened in 2019.
*Phanatic Phun Zone: Located at the First Base Gate plaza, this playground offers fun for guests eight years old and younger with slides, climb, explore and play games. A separate area for toddlers three years old and younger is found inside.
===Statues===

In addition to the Richie Ashburn statue in Ashburn Alley, statues of three other famous Phillies, Robin Roberts (at the First Base Gate), Mike Schmidt (at the Third Base Gate), and Steve Carlton (at the Left Field Gate), are located outside of the facility. Each of the statues were made by local sculptor Zenos Frudakis and cast at Laran Bronze in nearby Chester. Other art found throughout the park includes tile mosaics, murals and terrazzo floors with outlined images of famous players in Phillies history.

In April 2011, the Phillies accepted a gift of a fan-underwritten bronze statue of legendary broadcaster Harry Kalas. Created by noted local sculptor Lawrence Nowlan and cast at Laran Bronze, it was placed behind Section 141, near the restaurant that bears Kalas&#x27; name, after a dedication held on August 16, 2011, before a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The statue was unveiled two days later than originally scheduled (the originally-scheduled date is on a plaque on the ground below the statue) because of a rained-out game between the Phillies and the Washington Nationals.

===Green stadium===
The Philadelphia Phillies are the first Major League Baseball team to join the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s Green Power Partnership Program which motivates organizations across the world to purchase green power in order to minimize environmental impact. The Phillies announced on April 30, 2008, that their home field, Citizens Bank Park, will be powered with 20 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green energy purchased in Green-e Energy Certified Renewable Certificates (RECs). The EPA said that this purchase holds the record in professional sports for the largest purchase of 100% renewable energy.
The Phillies are among the top three purchasers of green power in Philadelphia, and the executive director of the Center for Resource Solutions, Arthur O&#x27;Donnell, wants &quot;other clubs to take their lead.&quot; Aramark Corporation is the Phillies&#x27; food and beverage provider at Citizens Bank Park and they are taking major actions in improving the environmental impact of the Phillies&#x27; stadium. Glass, cardboard and plastics used during game day are recycled; frying oil is being recycled to produce biodiesel fuel, and biodegradable, recyclable, and compostable products, serviceware, and plastics have been introduced.

==Non-baseball events==
===Ice hockey===
On January 2, 2012, Citizens Bank Park hosted the fifth annual NHL Winter Classic between long time division rivals New York Rangers and Philadelphia Flyers before an SRO crowd of 46,967. The game, which was televised throughout the United States and Canada by NBC and CBC respectively, was won by the Rangers, 3–2. Two days earlier, on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 45,667 attended an alumni game played between teams made up of former Flyers and Rangers who had retired from the NHL between the 1970s and 2011 of which eight (four on each team) were also members of the Hockey Hall of Fame. The Flyers&#x27; starting goalie for the game, which was won by the Flyers alumni, 3–1, was Hall of Famer Bernie Parent. He made his first on ice appearance since his playing career ended prematurely due to an eye injury suffered during a game against the Rangers played at the neighboring (although since demolished) Spectrum in February 1979.

Four days after the 2012 NHL Winter Classic game, a third sell out crowd of 45,663 filled the Park on January 6 to watch the Flyers&#x27; AHL farm team, the Adirondack Phantoms, defeat the Hershey Bears, 4–3, in overtime. That crowd exceeded by a factor of more than two the previous largest gathering (21,673) to ever attend an AHL game since the league was established in 1936. With the normal 43,651 baseball seating capacity of the Park having been increased by more than 3,000 with the installation of temporary bleachers built over the bullpen area in center field, the trio of outdoor hockey games drew a combined total of 138,296 over the week of Winter Classic events.

===Concerts===

The first concert at the park was Jimmy Buffett &amp; The Coral Reefer Band on August 25, 2005; they returned on June 14, 2008.

The Eagles, The Dixie Chicks, and Keith Urban were scheduled to perform on June 14, 2010, but the show was cancelled.

==Other stadium information==
Public address announcer Dan Baker has introduced the players since 1972. During each player&#x27;s first at-bat, Baker, in an excited voice, says, &quot;Now batting for the Phillies, number (#), (position), (player&#x27;s name)&quot;. For example, a first at-bat introduction would have Baker say, &quot;Now batting for the Phillies, number 11, shortstop Jimmy Rollins!&quot; During subsequent at-bats, players are only announced by their position and name, for example, &quot;Phillies first baseman, Ryan Howard!&quot; Baker only uses the city of the opposing team when he announces their players rather than the team nickname, for example, &quot;Now batting for Atlanta, number ten, third baseman Chipper Jones&quot;, and makes the announcement in a more-subdued tone.

==Video boards==

In 2004 and 2005, Citizens Bank Park installed Daktronics video and message displays in the park. One of the largest incandescent displays in Major League Baseball was installed in left field that was used as a scoreboard and for giving statistics. There are also out-of-town field-level displays installed in the park that measure about high by wide.

During the 2010–2011 offseason, the Phillies replaced their incandescent scoreboard with a new HD scoreboard that cost $10 million. The new screen measured high and wide, which nearly tripled the size of the old screen, and was the second-largest HD screen in the National League at the time, after the San Diego Padres&#x27; PETCO Park screen (61 ft. high and 124 ft. wide).

On March 21, 2023, a new &quot;PhanaVision&quot; was unveiled. Made by Daktronics, the 4K HDR video board is 77% larger, measuring 152 by 86 feet.

==Accolades==
The food at Citizens Bank Park was named the Best Ballpark Food in a survey of Food Network viewers in the first annual &quot;Food Network Awards&quot;, which first aired on the network on April 22, 2007.

In 2007, PETA rated Citizens Bank Park as America&#x27;s most vegetarian-friendly ballpark; the stadium was given the same honor in five of the next seven years as well.

<text>The Friedrichsfelde Central Cemetery () is a cemetery in the borough of Lichtenberg in Berlin. It was the cemetery used for many of Berlin&#x27;s Socialists, Communists, and anti-fascist fighters.

== History ==
When the cemetery was founded in 1881 it was called the &quot;Friedrichsfelde Municipal Cemetery Berlin&quot; (). The cemetery was modelled on Hamburg&#x27;s Ohlsdorf Cemetery. In 1900, with the burial of Wilhelm Liebknecht, founder of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the cemetery became the resting place for many of the leaders and activists of Germany&#x27;s social democratic, socialist and communist movements. In 1919, the coffins of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, co-founders of the Communist Party of Germany were buried in a mass grave in a remote section of the cemetery. A 2009 Charité autopsy report however cast doubt on whether Rosa Luxemberg&#x27;s remains were ever buried there.

The division of Berlin following the Second World War caused the cemetery to be within the borders of East Berlin, where it was used to bury East German (GDR) leaders, such as Walter Ulbricht and Wilhelm Pieck, the first President of the GDR.

In 2006 a monument to the victims of Stalinism was erected.

==Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde as &quot;Socialist Cemetery&quot;==
===The 1926 &quot;Monument to the Revolution&quot; ===

Unveiled in 1926, the &quot;Monument to the Revolution&quot; was erected in front of the mass grave where the coffins of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg had been interred in 1919. Designed by architect and future Bauhaus director, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, it was a wide and high red brick monument which the National Socialists destroyed in January 1935.

===The 1951 &quot;Memorial to the Socialists&quot;===
The current &quot;Memorial to the Socialists&quot; () stands close to the cemetery&#x27;s main gate and was inaugurated by Wilhelm Pieck in 1951. Although constructed at a significant distance from the site once occupied by the 1926 &quot;Monument to the Revolution&quot;, the 1951 memorial was planned as its &quot;moral successor&quot; and as central memorial site for East Germany&#x27;s Socialists, Communists and anti-fascist fighters. Until 1989, decisions whether a person should be buried in the &quot;Memorial to the Socialists&quot; or the adjacent &quot;Pergolenweg&quot; section of the cemetery rested solely with the Politburo of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and many honoured this way were also given a state funeral.

The 1951 &quot;Memorial to the Socialists&quot; consists of a central garden roundel surrounded by a semi-circular brick wall. The central garden roundel is dominated by a porphyry stele or obelisk with the words &quot;Die Toten mahnen uns&quot; (), which is surrounded by 10 graves commemorating foremost socialist leaders, namely: Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Ernst Thälmann, Wilhelm Pieck, Walter Ulbricht, Franz Mehring, John Schehr, Rudolf Breitscheid, , and Otto Grotewohl. Into the semi-circular brick wall are set gravestones and niches containing the urns of distinguished Socialists and Communists. Also in the semi-circular brick wall is a large red marble tablet recording the names of 327 men and women who gave their lives in the cause of fighting Fascism between 1933 and 1945. Included in the list are Hans Coppi, Hilde Coppi, Heinrich Koenen, Arvid Harnack, Harro Schulze-Boysen, John Sieg, and Ilse Stöbe.

Immediately behind the semi-circular brick wall of the &quot;Memorial to the Socialists&quot; lies the &quot;Pergolenweg&quot; Ehrengrab section of the cemetery. Here are buried the urns of Socialists, Communists and anti-fascist fighters of merit who were considered distinguished enough by the Politburo of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to rest in the vicinity of the foremost party leaders yet not as eminent as to entitle them to a grave in the &quot;Memorial to the Socialists&quot; itself. People buried in the &quot;Pergolenweg&quot; section could also have the urns of up to three family members buried with them.

<text>The 1988 Winter Paralympic Games () were the fourth Winter Paralympics, held again in Innsbruck, Austria. These were the last Paralympics to be held in a separate location from the Olympics. Beginning in 1992, the Olympics and the Paralympics were held in the same city or in an adjacent city. These Paralympics were not held at the same Olympic venue in Calgary, Canada, because of financial and recruiting difficulties. A total of 377 athletes from 22 countries took part. The USSR competed for the first and only time. Sit-skiing was introduced as another event in both the Alpine and Nordic skiing competitions. Other sports were biathlon and ice sledge speed racing. Ice sledge speed racer Knut Lundstroem from Norway was the most successful athlete, winning four gold medals in the 100m, 500m, 1000m and 1500m events.

<text>Richard Jay Potash (June 26, 1946 – November 24, 2018) was an American stage magician, actor, and writer. In a 1993 profile for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Mark Singer called Jay &quot;perhaps the most gifted sleight of hand artist alive&quot;. In addition to sleight of hand, he was known for his card tricks, card throwing, memory feats, and stage patter. He also wrote extensively on magic and its history. His acting credits include &quot;The Prestige&quot;, &quot;The Spanish Prisoner&quot;, &quot;Mystery Men&quot;, &quot;Heist&quot;, &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, &quot;Heartbreakers&quot;, &quot;State and Main&quot;, &quot;House of Games&quot;, &quot;Magnolia&quot;, and &quot;Deadwood.&quot; In 2015, he was the subject of an episode of PBS&#x27;s &quot;American Masters&quot;, the only magician ever profiled in the series.

==Early life==
Jay was born in the New York City borough of Brooklyn to Shirley (Katz) and Samuel Potash. A member of a middle-class Jewish family, he grew up in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He rarely spoke publicly about his parents, but did share an anecdote: &quot;My father oiled his hair with Brylcreem and brushed his teeth with Colgate&quot;, Jay recalled. &quot;He kept his toothpaste in the medicine cabinet and the Brylcreem in a closet about a foot away. Once, when I was ten, I switched the tubes. All you need to know about my father is that after he brushed his teeth with Brylcreem he put the toothpaste in his hair.&quot;

During an interview on the National Public Radio program &quot;Fresh Air with Terry Gross&quot;, Jay said that possibly &quot;the only kind memory I ever had of my parents&quot; was when they secretly hired one of his idols, magician Al Flosso, to perform at his bar mitzvah. Jay&#x27;s grandfather, Max Katz, was a certified public accountant and amateur magician who introduced Jay to magic.

==Career==
===Magician===

Jay first performed in public at the age of seven, in 1953, when he appeared on the television program &quot;Time for Pets&quot;. He is most likely the youngest magician to perform a full magic act on TV, the first magician to ever play comedy clubs, and probably the first magician to open for a rock and roll band. At New York&#x27;s Electric Circus in the 1960s, he performed on a bill between Ike and Tina Turner and Timothy Leary, who lectured about LSD.

During the 1960s and 70s, Jay lived in Ithaca, New York, performing while also intermittently attending the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, but later moved to the Los Angeles area.

He quickly developed a following among magic aficionados, and a reputation for sleight-of-hand feats that baffled even his colleagues. In his 1993 &quot;New Yorker&quot; profile of Jay, Mark Singer related the following story from playwright David Mamet and theater director Gregory Mosher:

Three of Jay&#x27;s one-man shows, &quot;Ricky Jay and His 52 Assistants&quot;, &quot;Ricky Jay: On the Stem&quot;, and &quot;Ricky Jay: A Rogue&#x27;s Gallery&quot;, were directed by Mamet, who also cast Jay in a number of his films.

A collector and historian, Jay was a student and friend of Dai Vernon, whom he called &quot;the greatest living contributor to the magical art.&quot; He collected rare books and manuscripts, art, and other artifacts connected to the history of magic, gambling, unusual entertainments, and frauds and confidence games. Jay opposed any public revelations of the techniques of magic.

Jay was formerly listed in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; for throwing a playing card 190 ft at (the current record is by Rick Smith Jr.). He could throw a playing card into a watermelon rind (which he referred to as the &quot;thick, pachydermatous outer melon layer&quot; and &quot;the most prodigious of household fruits&quot;) from ten paces. In addition, he was able to throw a card into the air like a boomerang and cut it cleanly in half with a pair of &quot;giant scissors&quot; upon its return. In his shows, he often attacked plastic animals with thrown cards in &quot;self defense&quot;.

===Actor===
Jay appeared in a number of David Mamet films including &quot;House of Games&quot;, &quot;The Spanish Prisoner&quot; and &quot;Redbelt&quot;; he also appeared in a few episodes of the Mamet-produced TV series &quot;The Unit&quot; as a C.I.A. recruiter.

Jay played Henry Gupta, a henchman to villain Elliot Carver, in the James Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies;&quot; and appeared in Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and &quot;Magnolia&quot;, as well as Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;The Prestige&quot;.

He joined the cast of the HBO western drama &quot;Deadwood&quot; as a recurring character and writer for the first season in 2004, playing card sharp Eddie Sawyer. He wrote the episode &quot;Jewel&#x27;s Boot Is Made for Walking&quot; and left the series at the end of the first season.

===Consultant===
As an expert on magic, gambling, con games and unusual entertainment, Jay was a consultant on Hollywood projects for many years, beginning with his work on Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s production of Caleb Deschanel&#x27;s &quot;The Escape Artist&quot;. Other early work included teaching Robert Redford how to manipulate coins for &quot;The Natural&quot; and working with Douglas Trumbull on his Showscan project &quot;New Magic&quot; (1983).

In the early 1990s, Jay and Michael Weber created a firm, Deceptive Practices, providing &quot;Arcane Knowledge on a Need-to-Know Basis&quot; to film, television and stage productions. By offering both vast historical expertise and creative invention, they were able to provide surprising practical solutions to real production challenges. Among many accomplishments, they designed the wheelchair that &quot;magically&quot; hid Gary Sinise&#x27;s legs in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;; the glass that &quot;drinks itself&quot; used by the gorilla in &quot;Congo&quot;; and an illusion &quot;in which a man climbs to the top of a ladder of light and vanishes in midair&quot; for the Broadway production of &quot;Angels in America: Perestroika&quot;.

Other projects they worked on included &quot;The Prestige&quot;, &quot;The Illusionist&quot;, &quot;Sneakers&quot;, &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;, &quot;Wolf&quot;, &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;, &quot;I Love Trouble&quot;, &quot;The Great Buck Howard&quot;, &quot;Heartbreakers&quot;, and &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot;.

Additionally, he worked with libraries and museums on their collections, including the Mulholland Library of Conjuring and the Allied Arts and the Museum of Jurassic Technology in Culver City, California.

===Lectures and exhibitions===
Jay authored numerous articles and delivered many lectures and demonstrations on such subjects as conjuring literature, con games, sense perception, and unusual entertainments. Among his presentations:

* &quot;Sleight and Shadow&quot;, at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art 
* &quot;Belknap Visitor in the Humanities&quot; lecture on the relationship between magicians and mediums, at Princeton University 
* &quot;Doing Likewise: Imitation, Emulation, and Mimesis&quot;, at the New York Institute of Humanities, hosted by Jonathan Miller.

* &quot;Prose &amp; Cons: The Early Literature of Cheating&quot;, at the New York Public Library (Pforzheimer Lecture Series) and the Chicago Humanities Festival.
* &quot;Magic &amp; Science&quot;, at the TED Conference in Monterey, California.

Jay also lectured at Harvard University, USC, the Grolier Club, the Hammer Museum, Getty Center, and Town Hall Theatre in New York City. In 1999 he guest-curated an exhibit at the Harvard Theater Collection entitled &quot;The Imagery of Illusion: Nineteenth Century Magic and Deception.&quot;

Exhibitions of material from his collections have been mounted at the Hammer Museum, the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, University of California, Davis, the Christine Burgin Gallery, the Museum of Jurassic Technology, and UCLA&#x27;s Clark Library. He loaned material to the Getty Center for their exhibit &quot;Devices of Wonder&quot; the Skirball Museum, the Huntington Library, the Whitney Museum of Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art for an exhibit entitled &quot;Wordplay: Matthias Buchinger&#x27;s Drawings From the Collection of Ricky Jay&quot; in 2016.

== Documentary film ==
Jay is the subject of the feature documentary &quot;Deceptive Practice: The Mysteries and Mentors of Ricky Jay&quot;.

==Death==
Jay died on November 24, 2018, at age 72. His attorney Stan Coleman confirmed his death but further details were not immediately released. Later press coverage reported that Jay died of natural causes.

<text>Tomás de Jesús Mangual (October 5, 1944 – October 31, 2011) was a Puerto Rican investigative reporter who worked for El Vocero, a well-known newspaper in Puerto Rico.

==Career==
Mangual served in the United States Army during the Vietnam War era. Joined El Vocero, a well-known Puerto Rican newspaper, during the 1970s. While he was not the only reporter covering crime stories for El Vocero, his name was the most recognizable. His trademark was the usage of Puerto Rican slang terms, such as (The person ran like a soul possessed by the Devil). Another one of his stories began with &quot;A well-aimed stab to the heart...&quot; His writing style earned him awards, but also criticism.

==Criminal libel laws of Puerto Rico lawsuit==
For many years, Mangual investigated crimes committed by politicians and police officers and was told he would be sued for libel by those he was investigating. In response, in 2003 Mangual became party to a lawsuit that said Puerto Rico&#x27;s criminal libel laws were against Freedom of the Press. The lawsuit resulted in the criminal libel laws of Puerto Rico being struck down for being unconstitutional.

Mangual died in Mayaguez and is interred at the Las Mercedes Cemetery in Ponce, Puerto Rico.

<doc id="342814" wikidata="Q27210" url="?curid=342814" title="Aleut language">
<text>Aleut ( ) or is the language spoken by the Aleut living in the Aleutian Islands, Pribilof Islands, Commander Islands, and the Alaska Peninsula (in Aleut , the origin of the state name Alaska). Aleut is the sole language in the Aleut branch of the Eskimo–Aleut language family. The Aleut language consists of three dialects, including  (Eastern Aleut), / (Atka Aleut), and / (Western Aleut, now extinct).

Various sources estimate there are fewer than 100 to 150 remaining active Aleut speakers. Because of this, Eastern and Atkan Aleut are classified as &quot;critically endangered and extinct&quot; and have an Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (EGIDS) rating of 7. The task of revitalizing Aleut has largely been left to local government and community organizations. The overwhelming majority of schools in the historically Aleut-speaking regions lack any language/culture courses in their curriculum, and those that do fail to produce fluent or even proficient speakers.

== History ==
The Eskimo and Aleut peoples were part of a migration from Asia across Beringia, the Bering land bridge between 4,000 and 6,000 years ago. During this period, the Proto-Eskimo-Aleut language was spoken, which broke up around 2000 BC. Differentiation of the two branches is thought to have happened in Alaska because of the linguistic diversity found in the Eskimo languages of Alaska relative to the entire geographic area where Eskimo languages are spoken (eastward through Canada to Greenland). After the split between the two branches, their development is thought to have occurred in relative isolation.

Evidence suggests a culture associated with Aleut speakers on the Eastern Aleutian Islands as early as 4,000 years ago, followed by a gradual expansion westward over the next 1,500 years to the Near Islands. Another westward expansion may have occurred about 1,000 years ago, which may explain the lack of obvious diversification among the Aleut dialects, with Eastern Aleut features having spread westward. This second westward expansion is characterized as a period of cultural affinity with southeastern Alaska and the Pacific Northwest Coast, which may explain linguistic features that Aleut shares with neighboring non-Eskimo languages, such as rules of plural formation.

Due to colonization by Russian colonizers and traders in the 18th and 19th centuries, Aleut has a large portion of Russian loanwords. However, they do not affect the basic vocabulary and thus do not suggest undue influence on the language.

In March 2021, the last native speaker of the Bering dialect, Vera Timoshenko, died aged 93 in Nikolskoye, Bering Island, Kamchatka.

== Dialects ==
Within the Eastern group are the dialects of the Alaskan Peninsula, Unalaska, Belkofski, Akutan, the Pribilof Islands, Kashega and Nikolski. The Pribilof dialect has more living speakers than any other dialect of Aleut.

The Atkan grouping comprises the dialects of Atka and Bering Island.

Attuan was a distinct dialect showing influence from both Atkan and Eastern Aleut. Copper Island Aleut (also called Medny Aleut) was a Russian-Attuan mixed language (Copper Island (, &quot;Medny&quot;, &quot;Mednyj&quot;) having been settled by Attuans). Despite the name, after 1969 Copper Island Aleut was spoken only on Bering Island, as Copper Islanders were evacuated there. After the death of the last native speaker in 2022, it became extinct.

All dialects show lexical influence from Russian; Copper Island Aleut has also adopted many Russian inflectional endings. The largest number of Russian loanwords can be seen in the Bering Aleut.

== Phonology ==

===Consonants===

The consonant phonemes of the various Aleut dialects are represented below. Each cell indicates the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) representation of the phoneme; consonants existing only in loanwords are in parentheses. Some phonemes are unique to specific dialects of Aleut.


The palato-alveolar affricate and uvular stop are pronounced with strong aspiration.

Attuan labial fricative is pronounced voiced or devoiced.

Voiceless approximants and devoiced nasals are preaspirated. The preaspiration of approximants causes very little friction and may pronounced more as a breathy voice. The preaspiration of devoiced nasals starts with a voiceless airstream through the nose and may end voiced before a vowel. The preaspiration feature is represented orthographically with an preceding the given sound. For example, a devoiced, preaspirated labial nasal would be written .

Voiced approximants and nasals may be partly devoiced in contact with a voiceless consonant and at the end of a word.

The voiceless glottal approximant functions as an initial aspiration before a vowel. In Atkan and Attuan, the prevocalic aspiration contrasts with an audible but not written glottal stop initiation of the vowel. Compare (&#x27;to turn the head&#x27;) and (&#x27;to need&#x27;). This contrast has been lost in Eastern Aleut.

Modern Eastern Aleut has a much simpler consonant inventory because the voice contrasts among nasals, sibilants and approximants have been lost.

Consonants listed in the dental column have varied places of articulation. The stop, nasal, and lateral dentals commonly have a laminal articulation. The voiced dental fricative is pronounced interdentally.

The pronunciation of the sibilant varies from an alveolar articulation to a retracted articulation like a palato-alveolar consonant. There is no contrast between and in Aleut. Many Aleut speakers experience difficulties with this distinction while learning English.

===Vowels===

Aleut has a basic three-vowel system including the high front , low , and high back . Aleut vowels contrast with their long counterparts , , and .

Notably, Aleut is pronounced slightly lower than in the vowel space.

The long vowel is pronounced retracted in the vowel space creating a significant distinction relative to the vowel length of . The two high vowels are pronounced with the same vowel quality regardless of vowel length.

In contact with a uvular, is lowered to , is backed to , and is lowered to . In contact with a coronal, is raised to or , and is fronted to .

The mid-vowels and occur only in family names like &quot;Nevzorof&quot; and very recently introduced Russian loanwords.

=== Syllable structure ===
(C)(C)V(V) ± {C(C)(C)V(V)} ± C

An Aleut word may contain one to about a dozen syllables, all syllables with a vocalic nucleus. In Atkan and Attuan, there is a word-final CC due to apocopation. There also exist word initial CCC in loanwords.

=== Phonotactics ===
A word may begin or end in a vowel, both short and long, with few exceptions. Due to apocopation, short is not found in the final position. The same is true for short , except in some obsolete suffixes, such as &#x27;your&#x27; (pl.) which is realized as and in modern Eastern and Atkan Aleut.

Vowels within a word are separated by at least one consonant. All single consonants can appear in an intervocalic position, with the following exceptions:
* and do not occur in intervocalic positions
* does not occur in contact with 
* does not occur in contact with 
Words begin with any consonant except and preaspirated consonants (with the exception of the preaspirated in Atkan Aleut). Only in loanwords do , , and the borrowed consonants (&quot;p, b, f, d, g, ɹ/ɾ)&quot; appear word-initially.

The word-initial CC can take many forms, with various restrictions on the distribution of consonants:
* a stop or , followed by a continuant other than or 
* a coronal stop or , followed by a postlingual continuant (velar, uvular, or glottal).
* postlingual stop or , followed by 
* or , followed by 
Intervocalic CC can occur in normal structure or as the result of syncopation.

In CC clusters of two voiced continuants, there is often a short transitional vowel. For example, &#x27;umbilical cord&#x27; is pronounced [-liĝ-] similar to &#x27;brain&#x27;.

Almost all possible combinations of coronal and postlingual consonants are attested.

The combination of two postlingual or two coronal consonants is rare, but attested, such as &#x27;rain pants&#x27;, &#x27;wolf&#x27;, &#x27;fit for me&#x27;, &#x27;to say; to tell; to call&#x27;.

In CCC clusters, the middle consonant is either , , . For example, &#x27;pulse&#x27;, &#x27;to wrap up&#x27;, &#x27;short fishline&#x27;.

The most common single consonants to appear word-final are , , , , , and .

Through apocopation, word-final single consonants and occur, and word-final consonant clusters ending with or .

==== Syncopation ====

The details of the extensive syncopation characteristic of the Eastern Aleut dialect are described below. In the examples, the syncopated vowel will be shown in parentheses.

A word medial short vowel may be syncopated between single consonants, except after an initial open short syllable and/or before a final open short syllable. For example, &#x27;it is good&#x27; and &#x27;what for?&#x27;.

The syncopation often creates consonant clusters beyond those prescribed by the general rules of Aleut phonotactics. The resulting clusters include:
* clusters of two stops: &#x27;he killed it&#x27;
* geminate consonants: &#x27;is young&#x27;
* a regular three consonant cluster: &#x27;after a short while (he)&#x27;
In some frequently encountered syncopated forms, which otherwise result in irregular three consonant clusters, the middle uvular fricative is deleted along with the preceding vowel. For example, &#x27;saying&#x27; and &#x27;being said&#x27;.

At slower speeds of speech, the syncopation may not be realized. Compare &#x27;you are getting skinny&#x27; beside &#x27;I am getting skinny&#x27;.

=== Stress ===
Aleut stress is indeterminate and often difficult to define. Stress varies based on the relation to the beginning or end of the word form, the length of the vowels, the sonority of the consonants, open- or closeness of the syllables, or the number of syllables in sentential rhythm and intonation. Stress affects the length of both vowels and consonants. Stress underlies the distinctive syncopation characteristics of Eastern Aleut. In the following discussion, the acute accent (á) indicates the stronger stress and the grave accent (à) indicates the weaker.

In Eastern Aleut, stronger stress tends to fall on the penultimate syllable if it is short (has a short vowel), or on the last syllable if it is long (has a long vowel). The weaker stress commonly falls on the first syllable. For example, &#x27;house&#x27;, &#x27;talked&#x27;, &#x27;without talking&#x27;, &#x27;he himself&#x27;.

Eastern Aleut words with more than two syllables exhibit a wider variety of stress patterns. Stress may be attracted to another syllable by a long vowel or relatively sonorant consonant, or by a closed syllable. It is possible the stress can be determined by rhythmic factors so that one word will have different stress in different contexts, such as compared to , both meaning &#x27;arrow&#x27;.

In Atkan and Attuan Aleut, stronger stress more commonly falls on the first syllable. However, long vowels, sonorants, etc. have similar effects on stress as in Eastern Aleut. For example, &#x27;how many&#x27; vs &#x27;where&#x27;; &#x27;spear&#x27; vs &#x27;sea&#x27;.

Stress may also be expressive, as with exclamations or polite requests. Stronger stress falls on the last syllable and is accompanied by a lengthening of a short vowel. For example, &#x27;coffee is coming&#x27;. There is a similar structure for polite requests: &#x27;please eat!&#x27; vs &#x27;eat&#x27;.

Under ordinary strong stress, a short syllable tends to be lengthened, either by lengthening the vowel or geminating the following single consonant. Lengthening of the vowel is most common in Eastern, but is found in Atkan before a voiced consonant. In all dialects gemination is common between an initial stressed syllable with a short vowel and a following stressed syllable. For example, &#x27;from him&#x27; pronounced and &#x27;a boy&#x27; pronounced .

=== Phrasal phonology ===
The following descriptions involve phonological processes that occur in connected speech.

Word-final velar and uvular fricatives are voiceless when followed by a word-initial voiceless consonant and are voiced when followed by a word-initial voiced consonant or a vowel.

Word-final nasals and are frequently deleted before an initial consonant other than . For example, &#x27;on the ground&#x27; and &#x27;the interior of the house&#x27;.

In Eastern Aleut, the final vowel may be elided before or contracted with the initial vowel of the following word, as in &#x27;he is bleeding awfully&#x27;.

In Atkan, the final syllable of a word form may be clipped off in fast speech. This is even frequent at slow speed in certain constructions with auxiliary verbs. The result will be a sequence of vowels or full contraction:
* , , &#x27;he&#x27;s about to come&#x27;
* , , &#x27;I&#x27;ll go home&#x27;

== Orthography ==
The modern practical Aleut orthography was designed in 1972 for the Alaskan school system&#x27;s bilingual program:
: * denotes letters typically used in loanwords
: † only found in Atkan Aleut
The historic Aleut (Cyrillic) alphabet found in both Alaska and Russia has the standard pre-1918 Russian orthography as its basis, although a number of Russian letters were used only in loanwords. In addition, the extended Cyrillic letters г̑ (г with inverted breve), ҟ, ҥ, ў, х̑ (х with inverted breve) were used to represent distinctly Aleut sounds.

A total of 24+ letters were used to represent distinctly Aleut words, including 6 vowels (а, и, й, у, ю, я) and 16 consonants (г, г̑, д, з, к, ԟ, л, м, н, ҥ, с, т, ў, х, х̑, ч). The letter ӄ has replaced the letter ԟ (Aleut Ka) for the voiceless uvular plosive in modern Aleut Cyrillic publications.
: * denotes letters typically used in loanwords
: † only found in Atkan Aleut

The modern Aleut orthography (for Bering dialect):

==Morphology==
Open word classes in Aleut include nouns and verbs, both derived from stems with suffixes. Many stems are ambivalent, being both nominal and verbal (see § Derivation). There are no adjectives other than verbal nouns and participles. Other word classes include pronouns, contrastives, quantifiers, numerals, positional nouns, demonstratives, and interrogatives.

=== Nouns ===
Ordinary nouns have suffixes for 
* number: singular, dual, and plural
* relational case: absolutive and relative
* person: first, second, anaphoric third, reflexive third
 

The anaphoric third person refers to a proceeding term, specified by being marked in the relative case or from context. For example, &#x27;the man&#x27;s house&#x27; and &#x27;his house&#x27;.

As free forms, the pronouns are used primarily as an object, like fully specified nouns. As enclitics they function as subject markers. 

==== Positional nouns ====
Positional nouns indicate positional, directional, or some more abstract relation to a definite referent (a person or proceeding noun in relative case). Positional nouns have possessive suffixes but no inherent number. 

Unlike ordinary nouns, positional nouns have two adverbial cases: locative and/or ablative. The most important stem , called the dative, has only a locative form (largely irregular) meaning &#x27;to, at, for-&#x27;. 

Most are used in absolutive case, as in &#x27;he passed behind the house&#x27;. They can also be used in the relative case, as in &#x27;the house behind the store&#x27;.

==== Numerals ====
The numeral system is decimal with &#x27;ten&#x27; and &#x27;hundred&#x27; as the basic higher terms. The higher tens numerals are derived through multiplication (e.g. 2 x10 for &#x27;twenty&#x27;). The multiplicative numerals are derived with the suffix on the base numeral followed by &#x27;ten&#x27;. For example, &#x27;forty&#x27;. 


=== Verbs ===

Verbs differ from nouns morphologically by having mood/tense suffixes. Like nominal stems, verb stems may end in a short vowel or consonant. Many stems ending in a consonant had auxiliary vowels which have largely become part of the stem itself.

Negation is sometimes suffixal, preceding or combining with the mood/tense suffix. In some cases the negation will be followed by the enclitic subject pronoun.

=== Derivation (postbases) ===

There are 570 derivational suffixes (postbases) including many composite ones, but about two thirds are found only in a small number of words. There are approximately 175 more common suffixes, considerably less than the Eskimo branch of the family.

A postbase may be nominal or verbal, yielding nouns derived from nouns or verbs, or verbs derived from verbs or nouns, or from nominal phrases. Many stems are ambivalent, being either nominal or verbal and even some derivatives can be ambivalent.

Difficulties distinguishing between nominal and verbal parts of speech arise because the parts of speech in Aleut are not easy to distinguish. A verbal stem may be used as a verbal predicate, and quite often as a noun. The verbal use of nouns is also very common.

The derivational suffixes may combine in strings of up to about six components, some belonging together to form composites. In sequences, each successive suffix often modifies the preceding string.

The majority of derivatives have a single stem that occurs also without the suffixes in question. While some stems are bound, only occurring with some derivational suffix. For example, compare &#x27;to scare, frighten&#x27; &#x27;to fear, be afraid of&#x27; &#x27;to be terrible, frightening&#x27;.

==Syntax==

===Overview===

Most Aleut words can be classified as nouns or verbs. Notions which in English are expressed by means of adjectives and adverbs are generally expressed in Aleut using verbs or postbases (derivational suffixes).

Aleut&#x27;s canonical word order is subject–object–verb (SOV).

Nouns are obligatorily marked for grammatical number (singular, dual, or plural) and for absolutive case or relative case (some researchers, notably Anna Berge, dispute both the characterization of this feature as &quot;case&quot; and the names &quot;absolutive&quot; and &quot;relative&quot;. This approach to Aleut nouns comes from Eskimo linguistics, but these terms can be misleading when applied to Aleut). The absolutive form is the default form, while the relative form communicates a relationship (such as possessive or contrastive) between the noun and another member of the sentence, possibly one that has been omitted. Absolutive and relative are identical in most combinations of person and number.

In possessive constructions, Aleut marks both possessor and possessum, with the possessor preceding the possessum:



The verbal predicate of a simple sentence of the final clause of a complex sentence carries the temporal and modal marking in relation to the speech act. Verbs of non-final clauses are marked in relation to the following clause. A complex sentence may contain an unlimited number of clauses.

Simple sentences may include a subject or no subject. The predicate may be a verb with no complement, a predicate noun with a copula, or a verb with a preceding direct object in the absolutive case and/or an oblique term or local complement.

The number of arguments may be increased or decreased by verbal derivative suffixes. Arguments of a clause may be explicitly specified or anaphoric.

The verb of a simple sentence or final clause may have a nominal subject in the absolutive case or a first-/second-person subject marker. If the nominal subject is left out, as known from context, the verb implies an anaphoric reference to the subject:

Positional nouns are a special, closed set of nouns which may take the locative or ablative noun cases; in these cases they behave essentially as postpositions. Morphosyntactically, positional noun phrases are almost identical to possessive phrases:

Verbs are inflected for mood and, if finite, for person and number. Person/number endings agree with the subject of the verb if all nominal participants of a sentence are overt:

If a 3rd person complement or subordinate part of it is omitted, as known from context, there is an anaphoric suffixal reference to it in the final verb and the nominal subject is in the relative case:

When more than one piece of information is omitted, the verb agrees with the element whose grammatical number is greatest. This can lead to ambiguity:

===Comparison to Eskimo grammar===

Although Aleut derives from the same parent language as the Eskimo languages, the two language groups (Aleut and Eskimo) have evolved in distinct ways, resulting in significant typological differences. Aleut inflectional morphology is greatly reduced from the system that must have been present in Proto-Eskimo–Aleut, and where the Eskimo languages mark a verb&#x27;s arguments morphologically, Aleut relies more heavily on a fixed word order.

Unlike the Eskimo languages, Aleut is not an ergative-absolutive language. Subjects and objects in Aleut are not marked differently depending on the transitivity of the verb (i.e. whether the verb is transitive or intransitive); by default, both are marked with a so-called absolutive noun ending. However, if an understood complement (which may either be a complement of the verb or of some other element in the sentence) is absent, the verb takes an &quot;anaphoric&quot; marking and the subject noun takes a &quot;relative&quot; noun ending.

A typological feature shared by Aleut and Eskimo is polysynthetic derivational morphology, which can lead to some rather long words:

== Research history ==

The first contact of people from the Eastern Hemisphere with the Aleut language occurred in 1741, as Vitus Bering&#x27;s expedition picked up place names and the names of the Aleut people they met. The first recording of the Aleut language in lexicon form appeared in a word list of the Unalaskan dialect compiled by Captain James King on Cook&#x27;s voyage in 1778. At that time the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg became interested in the Aleut language upon hearing of Russian expeditions for trading.

In Catherine the Great&#x27;s project to compile a giant comparative dictionary on all the languages spoken in what was the spread of the Russian empire at that time, she hired Peter Simon Pallas to conduct the fieldwork that would collect linguistic information on Aleut. During an expedition from 1791 to 1792, Carl Heinrich Merck and Michael Rohbeck collected several word lists and conducted a census of the male population that included prebaptismal Aleut names. Explorer Yuriy Feodorovich Lisyansky compiled several word lists. in 1804 and 1805, the czar&#x27;s plenipotentiary, Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov collected some more. Johann Christoph Adelung and Johann Severin Vater published their , which included Aleut among the languages it catalogued, similar to Catherine the Great&#x27;s dictionary project.

It was not until 1819 that the first professional linguist, the Dane Rasmus Rask, studied Aleut. He collected words and paradigms from two speakers of Eastern Aleut dialects living in Saint Petersburg. In 1824 came the man who would revolutionize Aleut as a literary language. Ioann Veniaminov, a Russian Orthodox priest who would later become a saint, arrived at Unalaska studying Unalaskan Aleut. He created an orthography for this language (using the Cyrillic alphabet; the Roman alphabet would come later), translated the Gospel according to St. Matthew and several other religious works into Aleut, and published a grammar of Eastern Aleut in 1846.

The religious works were translated with the help of Veniaminov&#x27;s friends Ivan Pan&#x27;kov (chief of Tigalda) and Iakov Netsvetov (the priest of Atka), both of whom were native Aleut speakers. Netsvetov also wrote a dictionary of Atkan Aleut. After Veniaminov&#x27;s works were published, several religious figures took interest in studying and recording Aleut, which would help these Russian Orthodox clerics in their missionary work. Father Innocent Shayashnikov did much work in the Eastern Fox-Island dialect translating a Catechism, all four Gospels and Acts of Apostles from the New Testament, and an original composition in Aleut entitled: &quot;Short Rule for a Pious Life&quot;.

Most of these were published in 1902, although written years earlier in the 1860s and 1870s. Father Lavrentii Salamatov produced a Catechism, and translations of three of the four Gospels (St. Mark, St. Luke, St. John) in the Western-Atkan dialect. Of Father Lavrentii&#x27;s work, the Gospel of St. Mark was published in a revised orthography (1959), and in its original, bilingual Russian-Aleut format (2007), together with his Catechism for the youth of Atka Island (2007). The Atkan-dialect Gospel of St. John was also electronically published (2008), along with the Gospel of St. Luke (2009) in the original bilingual format, completing the set of Fr. Lavrentii&#x27;s biblical translations.

The first Frenchman to record Aleut was Alphonse Pinart, in 1871, shortly after the United States purchase of Alaska. A French-Aleut grammar was also produced by Victor Henry, titled (Paris, 1879). In 1878, American Lucien M. Turner began work on collecting words for a word list. Benedykt Dybowski, a Pole, began taking word lists from the dialects of the Commander Islands in 1881, while Nikolai Vasilyevich Slyunin, a Russian doctor, did the same in 1892.

From 1909 to 1910, the ethnologist Waldemar Jochelson traveled to the Aleut communities of Unalaska, Atka, Attu and Nikolski. He spent nineteen months there doing fieldwork. Jochelson collected his ethnographic work with the help of two Unalaskan speakers, Aleksey Yachmenev and Leontiy Sivtsov. He recorded many Aleut stories, folklore and myth, and had many of them not only written down but also recorded in audio. Jochelson discovered much vocabulary and grammar when he was there, adding to the scientific knowledge of the Aleut language.

In the 1930s, two native Aleuts wrote down works that are considered breakthroughs in the use of Aleut as a literary language. Afinogen K. Ermeloff wrote down a literary account of a shipwreck in his native language, while Ardelion G. Ermeloff kept a diary in Aleut during the decade. At the same time, linguist Melville Jacobs picked up several new texts from Sergey Golley, an Atkan speaker who was hospitalized at the time.

John P. Harrington furthered research into the Pribilof Island dialect on St. Paul Island in 1941, collecting some new vocabulary along the way. In 1944, the United States Department of the Interior published &quot;The Aleut Language&quot; as part of the war effort, allowing World War II soldiers to understand the language of the Aleuts. This English–language project was based on Veniaminov&#x27;s work.

In 1950, Knut Bergsland began an extensive study of Aleut, perhaps the most rigorous to date, culminating in the publication of a complete Aleut dictionary in 1994 and a descriptive grammar in 1997. Bergsland&#x27;s work would not have been possible without key Aleut collaborators, especially Atkan linguist Moses Dirks.

Michael Krauss, Jeff Leer, Michael Fortescue, and Jerrold Sadock have published articles about Aleut.

Alice Taff has worked on Aleut since the 1970s. Her work constitutes the most detailed accounts of Aleut phonetics and phonology available.

Anna Berge conducts research on Aleut. Berge&#x27;s work includes treatments of Aleut discourse structure and morphosyntax, and curricular materials for Aleut, including a conversational grammar of the Atkan dialect, co-authored with Moses Dirks.

Bering Island dialect and Mednyj Aleut language have been extensively studied by Soviet and Russian linguists: , , . A dictionary and a comprehensive grammar were published.

In 2005, the parish of All Saints of North America Orthodox Church began to re-publish all historic Aleut language texts from 1840–1940. Archpriest Paul Merculief (originally from the Pribilofs) of the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Alaska and the Alaska State Library Historical Collection generously contributed their linguistic skills to the restoration effort. The historic Aleut texts are available in the parish&#x27;s Aleut library.

==Revitalization==

Revitalization efforts are a recent development for the Aleut language and are mostly in the hands of the Aleuts themselves. The first evidence of the preservation of the language came in the form of written documentation at the hands of the Russian Orthodox Church missionaries. However, as the historical events and factors transpired, Aleut&#x27;s falling out of favor has brought upon a necessity for action if the language is to survive much longer. Linguistic experts have been reaching out to the Aleut community in attempts to record and document the language from the remaining speakers. Such efforts amount to &quot;100 hours of conversation, along with the transcription and translation in Aleut, that will be transferred to compact disks or DVDs&quot;. If Aleut does go extinct, these records will allow linguists and descendants of the Aleutian people to pass on as much knowledge of the language as they can. Efforts like this to save the language are being sponsored by universities and local community interest groups, like the Aleutian/Pribilof Islands Association Task Force for Language Revitalization, while government relations with the Aleut people are severely limited. Similarly to the native languages of California, the native languages of Alaska had been given little attention from the United States government. While linguists are working to record and document the language, the local Aleutian community groups are striving to preserve their language and culture by assisting the linguists and raising awareness of the Aleut population.

There is an Aleut course named &quot;Unangam Qilinĝingin&quot; on Memrise.

<doc id="342815" wikidata="Q1553383" url="?curid=342815" title="Toyota Production System">
<text>The Toyota Production System (TPS) is an integrated socio-technical system, developed by Toyota, that comprises its management philosophy and practices. The TPS is a management system that organizes manufacturing and logistics for the automobile manufacturer, including interaction with suppliers and customers. The system is a major precursor of the more generic &quot;lean manufacturing&quot;. Taiichi Ohno and Eiji Toyoda, Japanese industrial engineers, developed the system between 1948 and 1975.

Originally called &quot;Just-in-time production&quot;, it builds on the approach created by the founder of Toyota, Sakichi Toyoda, his son Kiichiro Toyoda, and the engineer Taiichi Ohno. The principles underlying the TPS are embodied in The Toyota Way.

==Goals==
The main objectives of the TPS are to design out overburden (muri) and inconsistency (mura), and to eliminate waste (muda). The most significant effects on process value delivery are achieved by designing a process capable of delivering the required results smoothly; by designing out &quot;mura&quot; (inconsistency). It is also crucial to ensure that the process is as flexible as necessary without stress or &quot;muri&quot; (overburden) since this generates &quot;muda&quot; (waste). Finally the tactical improvements of waste reduction or the elimination of muda are very valuable. There are eight kinds of muda that are addressed in the TPS:
# Waste of overproduction (largest waste)
# Waste of time on hand (waiting)
# Waste of transportation
# Waste of processing itself
# Waste of excess inventory
# Waste of movement
# Waste of making defective products
# Waste of underutilized workers

==Concept==
Toyota Motor Corporation published an official description of TPS for the first time in 1992; this booklet was revised in 1998. In the foreword it was said: &quot;The TPS is a framework for conserving resources by eliminating waste. People who participate in the system learn to identify expenditures of material, effort and time that do not generate value for customers and furthermore we have avoided a &#x27;how-to&#x27; approach. The booklet is not a manual. Rather it is an overview of the concepts, that underlie our production system. It is a reminder that lasting gains in productivity and quality are possible whenever and wherever management and employees are united in a commitment to positive change&quot;. TPS is grounded on two main conceptual pillars:
# &quot;Just-in-time&quot; – meaning &quot;Making only what is needed, only when it is needed, and only in the amount that is needed&quot;
# &quot;Jidoka&quot; – (Autonomation) meaning &quot;Automation with a human touch&quot;

Toyota has developed various tools to transfer these concepts into practice and apply them to specific requirements and conditions in the company and business.

==Origins==
Toyota has long been recognized as a leader in the automotive manufacturing and production industry.

Toyota received their inspiration for the system, not from the American automotive industry (at that time the world&#x27;s largest by far), but from visiting a supermarket. The idea of just-in-time production was originated by Kiichiro Toyoda, founder of Toyota. The question was how to implement the idea. In reading descriptions of American supermarkets, Ohno saw the supermarket as the model for what he was trying to accomplish in the factory. A customer in a supermarket takes the desired amount of goods off the shelf and purchases them. The store restocks the shelf with enough new product to fill up the shelf space. Similarly, a work-center that needed parts would go to a &quot;store shelf&quot; (the inventory storage point) for the particular part and &quot;buy&quot; (withdraw) the quantity it needed, and the &quot;shelf&quot; would be &quot;restocked&quot; by the work-center that produced the part, making only enough to replace the inventory that had been withdrawn.

While low inventory levels are a key outcome of the System, an important element of the philosophy behind its system is to work intelligently and eliminate waste so that only minimal inventory is needed. Many Western businesses, having observed Toyota&#x27;s factories, set out to attack high inventory levels directly without understanding what made these reductions possible. The act of imitating without understanding the underlying concept or motivation may have led to the failure of those projects.

==Principles==

The underlying principles, called the Toyota Way, have been outlined by Toyota as follows:

===Continuous improvement===
* Challenge (We form a long-term vision, meeting challenges with courage and creativity to realize our dreams.)
* Kaizen (We improve our business operations continuously, always driving for innovation and evolution.)
* Genchi Genbutsu (Go to the source to find the facts to make correct decisions.)

===Respect for people===
* Respect (We respect others, make every effort to understand each other, take responsibility and do our best to build mutual trust.)
* Teamwork (We stimulate personal and professional growth, share the opportunities of development and maximize individual and team performance.)

External observers have summarized the principles of the Toyota Way as:

===The right process will produce the right results===

# Create continuous process flow to bring problems to the surface.
# Use the &quot;pull&quot; system to avoid overproduction.
# Level out the workload (heijunka). (Work like the tortoise, not the hare.)
# Build a culture of stopping to fix problems, to get quality right from the start. (Jidoka)
# Standardized tasks are the foundation for continuous improvement and employee empowerment.
# Use visual control so no problems are hidden.
# Use only reliable, thoroughly tested technology that serves your people and processes.

===Add value to the organization by developing your people and partners===
# Grow leaders who thoroughly understand the work, live the philosophy, and teach it to others.
# Develop exceptional people and teams who follow your company&#x27;s philosophy.
# Respect your extended network of partners and suppliers by challenging them and helping them improve.

===Continuously solving root problems drives organizational learning===
# Go and see for yourself to thoroughly understand the situation (Genchi Genbutsu, 現地現物);
# Make decisions slowly by consensus, thoroughly considering all options (Nemawashi, 根回し); implement decisions rapidly;
# Become a learning organization through relentless reflection (Hansei, 反省) and continuous improvement and never stop (Kaizen, 改善).

What this means is that it is a system for thorough waste elimination. Here, waste refers to anything which does not advance the process, everything that does not increase added value. Many people settle for eliminating the waste that everyone recognizes as waste. But much remains that simply has not yet been recognized as waste or that people are willing to tolerate.

People had resigned themselves to certain problems, had become hostage to routine and abandoned the practice of problem-solving. This going back to basics, exposing the real significance of problems and then making fundamental improvements, can be witnessed throughout the Toyota Production System.

The principles of the Toyota Production System have been compared to production methods in the industrialization of construction.

==Sharing==
Toyota originally began sharing TPS with its parts suppliers in the 1990s. Because of interest in the program from other organizations, Toyota began offering instruction in the methodology to others. Toyota has even &quot;donated&quot; its system to charities, providing its engineering staff and techniques to non-profits in an effort to increase their efficiency and thus ability to serve people. For example, Toyota assisted the Food Bank For New York City to significantly decrease waiting times at soup kitchens, packing times at a food distribution center, and waiting times in a food pantry. Toyota announced on June 29, 2011 the launch of a national program to donate its Toyota Production System expertise towards nonprofit organizations with goal of improving their operations, extending their reach, and increasing their impact. By September, less than three months later, SBP, a disaster relief organization based out of New Orleans, reported that their home rebuilds had been reduced from 12 to 18 weeks, to 6 weeks. Additionally, employing Toyota methods (like &quot;kaizen&quot;) had reduced construction errors by 50 percent. The company included SBP among its first 20 community organizations, along with AmeriCorps.

==&quot;Workplace Management&quot;==
Taiichi Ohno&#x27;s &quot;Workplace Management&quot; (2007) outlines in 38 chapters how to implement the TPS. Some important concepts are:
* Chapter 1 &quot;Wise Mend Their Ways&quot; - See the Analects of Confucius for further information.
* Chapter 4 &quot;Confirm Failures With Your Own Eyes&quot; 
* Chapter 11 &quot;Wasted Motion Is Not Work&quot;
* Chapter 15 &quot;Just In Time&quot; - Phrase invented by Kiichiro Toyoda - the first president of Toyota. There is conflict on what the actual English translation of what &quot;just in time&quot; really means. Taiichi Ohno quoted from the book says &quot; &#x27;Just In Time&#x27; should be interpreted to mean that it is a problem when parts are delivered too early&quot;.
* Chapter 23 &quot;How To Produce At A Lower Cost&quot; - &quot;One of the main fundamentals of the Toyota System is to make &#x27;what you need, in the amount you need, by the time you need it&#x27;, but to tell the truth there is another part to this and that is &#x27;at lower cost&#x27;. But that part is not written down.&quot; World economies, events, and each individual job also play a part in production specifics.

<text>WWE SmackDown, also known as Friday Night SmackDown or simply SmackDown, is an American professional wrestling television program produced by WWE. It airs live every Friday at 8 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on USA Network in the United States, and in most international markets on Netflix.

&quot;SmackDown&quot; is the most viewed television show on Friday nights in the United States. Fox Deportes simulcasts the program with Spanish-language commentary. The show features characters from the SmackDown brand, to which WWE wrestlers are assigned to work and perform. It is considered to be one of WWE&#x27;s two flagship programs, along with &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;.

&quot;SmackDown!&quot; debuted in Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Missouri on UPN on April 29, 1999, and was formerly broadcast on Thursday nights. The show moved to Friday nights on September 9, 2005, and began airing on The CW in September 2006, after the merger of UPN and the WB. The show later moved to MyNetworkTV in October 2008. On October 1, 2010, &quot;SmackDown&quot; moved to cable network Syfy, and eventually returned to Thursdays on January 15, 2015. The show then moved to the sibling USA Network on January 7, 2016, and later that year, beginning on July 19, &quot;SmackDown&quot; began broadcasting live on Tuesday nights. &quot;SmackDown&quot;″s move to Fox on October 4, 2019 marked the show&#x27;s return to Friday nights and over-the-air broadcast television (as well as the second time &quot;SmackDown&quot; has aired on a Fox-owned network). On September 13, 2024, the show returned to USA Network.

&quot;SmackDown&quot; has been broadcast from over 100+ arenas, 100+ cities and towns, and nine countries: United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Japan in 2005, Italy in 2007, Mexico in 2011, and France, Saudi Arabia, and Germany in 2024. Prior to switching to its current live format, taped episodes premiered a few hours earlier in Ireland and the United Kingdom than in the United States (and a day earlier in Australia, Canada, Singapore, and the Philippines) due to time differences. For international broadcast listings, see below. The show celebrated its 15th anniversary on October 10, 2014, and the 1000th episode on October 16, 2018.

The WWE Network ceased operations in the United States on April 4, 2021, with all content moved to Peacock which now has all previous episodes of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. Recent episodes are still available for on-demand viewing 30 days after the original air date.

== History ==
=== Early years (1999–2009) ===
&quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot; was set up to compete against World Championship Wrestling (WCW)&#x27;s Thursday night show, &quot;Thunder&quot;. &quot;SmackDown!&quot; first appeared on April 29, 1999, using the &quot;Raw&quot; set as a single television special on UPN. On August 26, 1999, &quot;SmackDown!&quot; officially debuted on UPN. Like &quot;Thunder&quot;, &quot;SmackDown!&quot; was recorded on Tuesdays and then broadcast on Thursdays. The new WWF show was so popular that WCW moved &quot;Thunder&quot; to Wednesdays so that it would not compete directly. Throughout the show&#x27;s early existence, The Rock routinely called &quot;SmackDown!&quot; &quot;his show&quot;, in reference to the fact that the name was derived from one of his catchphrases, &quot;Layeth the Smack down&quot;. In March 2002, WWF implemented the &quot;brand extension&quot;, under which Raw and SmackDown! would have separate rosters of performers that are exclusive to their respective programs and events, and be positioned in-universe as competing &quot;brands&quot; (in a manner reminiscent of athletic conferences).

In the 2004–05 season, &quot;SmackDown!&quot; had an average viewership of 5.1 million viewers, making it UPN&#x27;s second-highest-rated series behind &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;. With the cancellation of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, &quot;SmackDown!&quot; moved into its former timeslot on Friday nights for the 2005–06 season, beginning September 9, 2005. WWE subsequently announced that the show would be renamed &quot;Friday Night SmackDown!&quot; to emphasize the new scheduling.

In January 2006, CBS Corporation and Warner Bros. Entertainment announced that UPN and The WB would merge to form a new network known as The CW that fall. As part of the announcement, The CW announced that it would renew &quot;Friday Night SmackDown!&quot; for two more seasons as part of its launch schedule—which drew from the strongest programs of its two predecessors. On September 22, 2006, &quot;Friday Night SmackDown!&quot; aired its first ever episode on The CW.

The CW declined to renew &quot;SmackDown&quot;, resulting in the series being picked up in October 2008 by MyNetworkTV, a second new network that had been formed by Fox Entertainment Group to take on former UPN and WB affiliates who were not selected to join The CW. Retaining its previous Friday-night time slot, the season premiere of &quot;SmackDown&quot; on MyNetworkTV was the highest-rated program in that night on the network, with 3.2 million viewers. On March 20, 2009, &quot;SmackDown&quot; celebrated its 500th episode.

=== Move to Syfy and USA Network (2010–2019) ===
On October 1, 2010, as part of a new broadcast deal with NBC Universal, &quot;SmackDown&quot; moved to Syfy, retaining its Friday night timeslot. Prior to this premiere of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Michael Cole hosted a &quot;pre-game&quot; show. The move saw Syfy paying close to $30 million for the show as opposed to the $20 million paid by its former network MyNetworkTV.

During the August 29, 2011 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, WWE dissolved the brand extension, thus allowing performers to appear on &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot; at any given time without restriction. The October 14, 2011, episode made &quot;SmackDown&quot; the second-longest-running weekly episodic television series of American television history (behind &quot;Raw&quot;, which surpassed that mark on August 1, 2005). On January 18, 2013, &quot;SmackDown&quot; celebrated its 700th episode.

On October 10, 2014, &quot;SmackDown&quot; celebrated its 15-year anniversary. To help celebrate the 15th anniversary, Stephanie McMahon came out first, then Laurinaitis and Long, respectively, the latter of which kept one-upping each other for the main event of the night until McMahon decided to keep the 15-man tag team match that Long suggested, on the condition Laurinaitis and Long be the captains of each team like at WrestleMania XXVIII. Long&#x27;s team won the match. On December 16, 2014, &quot;SmackDown&quot; aired a live 800th episode special on Syfy&#x27;s sister channel USA Network, &quot;SuperSmackDown Live!&quot;, featuring a main event between Dolph Ziggler and Seth Rollins.

In January 2015, &quot;SmackDown&quot; returned to a Thursday time slot. The return to Thursday nights was expected to help attract a younger audience to Syfy, as well as more premium advertising dollars from marketers, who tend to spend more to promote their products, especially film releases, on the night as consumers head into the weekend. The last &quot;SmackDown&quot; airing on a Friday night had 2.43 million viewers with a 0.7 share. On January 7, 2016, &quot;SmackDown&quot; moved to USA Network, remaining on Thursday nights. With the move, all top three WWE programs—&quot;Raw&quot;, &quot;SmackDown&quot; and &quot;Tough Enough&quot;—would air on the same network for the first time ever.

On May 25, 2016, as part of the re-implementation of the brand extension and split between &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot;, it was announced that &quot;SmackDown&quot; would move to Tuesday nights and be broadcast live. On the July 11, 2016 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Vince McMahon named Shane McMahon the commissioner of SmackDown. Then next week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Daniel Bryan was revealed as the new SmackDown General Manager. On July 22, 2016, general manager Daniel Bryan revealed the new SmackDown logo on his official Twitter page, renaming the show SmackDown Live. On April 10, 2018, SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon announced that Daniel Bryan was back as a full-time WWE wrestler and named Paige the new general manager.

=== SmackDown on Fox (2019–2024) ===

On June 26, 2018, Fox announced a five-year agreement to air &quot;SmackDown&quot;, in a deal worth $205 million per year. &quot;SmackDown&quot; would debut on October 4, 2019, with its first episode being the 20th Anniversary special. The episode also marked the return of &quot;SmackDown&quot; to Friday nights and the return of WWE programming to Fox for the first time since Fox aired the November 14, 1992 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot;. The agreement came as WWE&#x27;s previous broadcast deal with USA Network to air both &quot;SmackDown&quot; and &quot;WWE Raw&quot; was set to expire, and as Fox has increasingly emphasized live sports programming and non-scripted entertainment in the wake of its then-upcoming sale of its in-house studios to Disney. Fox had hoped to acquire &quot;Raw&quot; for the Fox network and &quot;SmackDown&quot; for FS1. However, amid a competitive bidding situation, NBCUniversal focused its efforts on renewing &quot;Raw&quot;, freeing up Fox to pursue &quot;SmackDown&quot;. In particular, Fox promised a larger amount of promotion for &quot;SmackDown&quot; during its sports programming, as well as a WWE-oriented studio show (&quot;WWE Backstage&quot;) on FS1.

From March 13, 2020, all WWE touring shows were cancelled indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with &quot;SmackDown&quot;, &quot;Raw&quot;, and pay-per-views being broadcast from a studio in the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida with no audience beginning that night. The ensuing episode also featured Triple H as a guest commentator, and an encore presentation of the Elimination Chamber match for the SmackDown Tag Team Championship from the titular pay-per-view the previous Sunday. On August 17, WWE announced that &quot;SmackDown&quot;, &quot;Raw&quot;, and pay-per-views would move out of the Performance Center to the &quot;WWE ThunderDome&quot; at Orlando&#x27;s Amway Center, beginning with &quot;SmackDown&quot; on August 21. The program continued to be broadcast behind closed doors, but with a virtual audience and enhanced arena production. WWE returned to hosting and touring shows for both the &quot;SmackDown&quot; and &quot;Raw&quot; brands in June 2021.

Since the move to Fox, &quot;SmackDown&quot; has occasionally been pre-empted to FS1 due to conflicts with other Fox Sports programming airing in primetime, particularly the Major League Baseball postseason. In one instance in October 2019 due to the World Series, an hour-long version of the episode aired on Fox the following Sunday afternoon.

In conjunction with the 2023 Money in the Bank event, which was held at The O2 Arena in London, England, on July 1, the June 30, 2023, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; was held at the same venue, and broadcast live on BT Sport in local primetime hours for the first time. In 2024, the program aired episodes from other countries for the first time in conjunction with other WWE PPV&#x27;s, including May 3 for Backlash France (LDLC Arena in Décines-Charpieu, Lyon, France), May 24 for King and Queen of the Ring (Jeddah Super Dome in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia), and August 31 for Bash in Berlin (Uber Arena in Berlin, Germany).

=== Return to USA Network and global move to Netflix (2024–present) ===
On September 21, 2023, it was announced that &quot;SmackDown&quot; would return to USA Network in October 2024, following the expiration of WWE&#x27;s contract with Fox. The agreement with NBCUniversal was reported to be valued at $1.4 billion over five years, an increase over the previous agreement. As part of the agreement, WWE also agreed to produce four primetime specials for sister broadcast network NBC per-year; these specials were later revealed to be a second revival of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot;, which premiered on December 14, 2024.

The original date of &quot;SmackDown&quot; return to USA Network was October 4, 2024, the fifth anniversary of its premiere on Fox, however, Fox had originally planned to move the final three episodes of &quot;SmackDown&quot; to FS1 to accommodate the premiere of &quot;Fox College Football Friday&quot; in its former time slot. On May 9, 2024, USA Network announced that &quot;SmackDown&quot; would return to the channel on September 13, 2024, retaining its Friday-night timeslot.

On December 20, 2024, WWE announced that &quot;SmackDown&quot; would expand to three hours beginning January 3, 2025, replacing &quot;NXT Level Up&quot;. As Netflix acquired the rights to WWE programming outside of the United States, and &quot;Raw&quot; globally starting January 2025, that episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; is expected to be streamed on YouTube internationally in the interim. &quot;SmackDown&quot; formal Netflix debut will be on the January 10 episode, following the debut of &quot;Raw&quot; on Netflix.

== Production ==
WWE taped &quot;SmackDown&quot; on Tuesday evenings to air on Thursday evenings on UPN the same week. However, &quot;SmackDown&quot; had aired occasional live specials on Tuesday nights (which are then replayed in its usual Thursday night timeslot). The show began broadcasting in HD beginning with the January 25, 2008 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, where a new set (which became universal for all WWE weekly programming) debuted. Following the first broadcast in HD, the exclamation mark used since the show&#x27;s inception disappeared from all references pertaining to &quot;SmackDown&quot;, including the official logo, which resembles the 2001–2008 logo, but with a darker blue scheme.
The early set included an oval-shaped TitanTron entrance and stage (dubbed the &quot;Ovaltron&quot;) which made it stand out from the &quot;Raw Is War&quot; set with its rectangular Titantrons. Later productions gained the ability to move the Ovaltron either to the left or to the right of the stage. In August 2001, as part of celebrating &quot;SmackDown!&quot;″s second anniversary, the show received a new logo and set, which consisted of a fist centered above the entrance with the WWF/E scratch logo above it, and many glass panes along the sides strongly resembling shattered glass with two TitanTrons on each side. From September 23, 2004, to September 26, 2008, the theme song for &quot;SmackDown!&quot; was &quot;Rise Up&quot; by Drowning Pool, with variations, making it the longest tenured theme song used in the program.

Whenever &quot;SmackDown!&quot; shared the arena with &quot;Raw&quot; during the 2005–2007 period in a form of a supershow, the &quot;SmackDown!&quot; stage utilized all or some components of the same set from &quot;Raw&quot;.

From November 2, 2012 until April 18, 2014, &quot;SmackDown&quot; began using &quot;Born 2 Run&quot; by 7Lions as its theme song, with &quot;This Life&quot; by CFO$ and Cody B. Ware serving as the secondary theme, then a swap was made, as &quot;Born 2 Run&quot; was used as a secondary theme, when &quot;This Life&quot; is used as &quot;SmackDown&#x27;s&quot; main theme. Prior to November 2, 2012, &quot;SmackDown&quot; opened with &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; by Green Day while &quot;Hangman&quot; by Rev Theory served as the secondary theme song. Upon &quot;SmackDown&quot;″s debut on Syfy in 2010, it replaced the previous theme song &quot;Let it Roll&quot; by Divide the Day.

As of August 3, 2012, the show has used the modified WWE HD universal set, which debuted at &quot;Raw 1000&quot; on July 23. From September 21, 2012, until October 26, 2012, October 4, 2013, until November 1, 2013, October 3 and 31, 2014, and October 2 and 30, 2015, WWE worked in conjunction with Susan G. Komen for the Cure to raise awareness for breast cancer by adorning the &quot;SmackDown&quot; set with pink ribbons and a special pink middle-rope in the ring. &quot;SmackDown&quot;″s ring ropes were usually blue from 1999 to 2012 (although they were black for a period between 2001 and 2002). They remained blue until December 2012 when they were permanently changed to white, with all WWE programming now using white ring ropes. On August 22, 2014, &quot;SmackDown&quot; switched to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation, with a down-scaled version of the native HD feed on a 4:3 SD feed.

Although the graphics were re-positioned, &quot;SmackDown&quot; continued to use a variation of the graphics package that had been in use since its first HD broadcast in January 2008, until the show moved to Thursday nights on January 15, 2015, when an all-new graphics package (now optimized for the 16:9 format) and intro video were introduced along with a revised &quot;SmackDown&quot; logo. On March 26, 2015, WWE added a small LED board to the left side of the ring on &quot;SmackDown&quot;, similar to &quot;Raw&quot;. On the September 14, 2015 season premiere of &quot;Raw&quot;, the middle rope was colored gold. Throughout the month of October 2015, the WWE broadcast table, entrance ramp, and ring skirts were co-branded with Susan G. Komen for the cure of breast cancer. Also, the middle ring rope was pink to promote the fight against breast cancer. Following the brand split in 2016, the ropes return to its original blue color as well as debuting a new set. The post brand extension set was almost identical to the set from 2009 to 2013 and caused some negative feedback among online fans for re-using an old stage design. A month after the new set debut, a more distinctive and elaborate stage was created for SmackDown. The stage used was a new design with multiple LED side panels on each side with a titan-tron in a semi circle in the center. The new set also introduced LED floor panels on the entrance ramp. Feedback was more positive for this set design.

With the shift to Fox, both &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot; introduced new sets during their &quot;premiere week&quot;. The new set featured a large TitanTron screen, with semi-arches partially resembling the original &quot;SmackDown&quot; stage.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all WWE programs suspended touring shows from mid-March 2020 through mid-July 2021. All &quot;SmackDown&quot; broadcasts were filmed behind closed doors with no in-person spectators, initially from the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, before returning to an arena setting with a closed set known as the &quot;ThunderDome&quot;—which featured a larger-scale production more in line with its PPV shows, but with a virtual audience displayed on a grandstand constructed from video boards.

With the return to live shows in July 2021, a new universal stage was adopted by both &quot;SmackDown&quot; and &quot;Raw&quot;, with a high-resolution LED screen, and increasing use of augmented reality graphics for the television production.

Since January 3, 2025, &quot;SmackDown&quot; introduced a blue ring mat. The new standard announce table design, which debuted on the Raw debut on Netflix, was unveiled the next week.
Notes

# Bold song titles are currently being used as the opening theme.
# Also titled as &quot;Everybody on the Ground&quot; prior to the release of the .
# The first version was an instrumental composed by Jim Johnston and it was only used on September 23, 2004, for &quot;SmackDown&#x27;s 5th Anniversary&quot;. Another version was performed by Ryan McCombs entitled &quot;Rise Up 2006&quot; and was used from March 24, 2006.
== Cultural references ==
On July 10, 2007, Merriam-Webster included the word &quot;smackdown&quot; in &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary.&quot; Merriam Webster defined a &quot;smackdown&quot; as:
* The act of knocking down or bringing down an opponent.
* A contest in entertainment wrestling.
* A decisive defeat.
* A confrontation between rivals or competitors.

The Oxford English Dictionary traces the use of the word &quot;smackdown&quot; in English back at least as far as 1990, but notes that a professional wrestling television show &quot;popularized&quot; the term.

== Special episodes ==

Throughout its broadcast history, the show has aired editions that have different themes. These include tributes to various professional wrestlers who have recently died or retired from actively performing, and episodes commemorating various show milestones or anniversaries.

== Other SmackDown-branded properties ==
Although &quot;SmackDown&quot; has been the second-largest show in the WWE, the company&#x27;s use of the term went beyond its namesake program. During the 2000 U.S. election campaign, the WWE launched the &quot;SmackDown! Your Vote&quot; program.

The name was also used when WWE released its 2015 film &quot;The Flintstones &amp; WWE: Stone Age SmackDown!&quot; and WWE Network&#x27;s show &quot;Kitchen SmackDown!&quot;.

==Roster==

The wrestlers featured on WWE take part in scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers are portrayed as heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match.

The primary commentators for &quot;SmackDown&quot; are Joe Tessitore and Wade Barrett. Additional commentary has been provided by Tazz, Jim Ross, Josh Mathews, Mauro Ranallo, Tom Phillips and others since its creation.

== Broadcast ==

=== Broadcast history ===
==== Americas ====
===== Latin America =====
&quot;SmackDown&quot; airs live on Fox Sports in Mexico and across Central and South America since 2014 until 2021.

===== Canada =====
In Canada, &quot;SmackDown&quot; was previously aired on Sportsnet 360 (SN360, formerly known as The Score), as part of a long term deal with Rogers Sports &amp; Media. The program was mostly aired in simulcast with the U.S. airing but was broadcast the previous day from January 2015 to July 2016. This was due to conflicts with the channel&#x27;s Thursday-night National Hockey League broadcasts. In 2005, when the taped show moved to Friday airings in the U.S., it remained on Thursdays in Canada for a period of time.

When SmackDown transitioned to a live format in July 2016, the program returned to airing in simulcast with the U.S. broadcast, initially on Tuesdays and then moving back to Fridays in October 2019. Despite the move to Fox (which is widely carried on Canadian television providers) in 2019, Rogers did not elect to simulcast &quot;SmackDown&quot; on its broadcast network Citytv to invoke potential simsub rights.

As Rogers also held the rights to National Hockey League broadcasts, the program was occasionally pre-empted to OLN (now Bravo) during the Stanley Cup playoffs.

All archived broadcasts of &quot;SmackDown&quot; were available on the WWE Network until its closure in December 2024. Since January 1, 2025, WWE’s Canadian broadcast rights are held by Netflix. Select archived episodes are available for streaming on Netflix under the title &quot;SmackDown Vault,&quot; with live broadcasts beginning on January 10. The January 3 episode was streamed on WWE’s YouTube channel. The show does not air on the Canadian iteration of USA Network, which launched on the former Discovery Channel space on January 1.

<text>The year 1940 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events, listed below.

==Biochemistry==
* August 24 – Howard Florey and a team including Ernst Chain, Arthur Duncan Gardner, Norman Heatley, M. Jennings, J. Orr-Ewing and G. Sanders at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, publish their laboratory results showing the &quot;in vivo&quot; bactericidal action of penicillin. They have also purified the drug. On December 25 they seed their first batch of culture with spores of penicillin to grow it in medicinal quantity.
* The antibiotic dactinomycin (actinomycin D) is first isolated by Selman Waksman and H. Boyd Woodruff at Rutgers University.

==Biology==
* February 2 – The first transposons are discovered in maize (&quot;Zea mays&quot;, aka corn) by Barbara McClintock.
* March 11 – Ed Ricketts, John Steinbeck and six others leave Monterey for the Gulf of California on a marine invertebrate collecting expedition.

==Chemistry==
* February 27 – The radioactive isotope carbon-14 is discovered by Martin Kamen and Sam Ruben at the University of California, Berkeley.
* May 15 – Women&#x27;s stockings made of nylon are first placed on sale across the United States.
* December 14 – Plutonium is first synthesized by a team led by Glenn T. Seaborg and Edwin McMillan at the University of California, Berkeley by bombarding uranium-238 with deuterons.
* The radioactive element Astatine is synthesized by Dale R. Corson, Kenneth Ross MacKenzie and Emilio Segrè at the University of California, Berkeley.
* Neptunium, the first transuranic element, is synthesized by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson at the University of California, Berkeley.
* Louis Plack Hammett coins the term &quot;Physical organic chemistry&quot; when he uses it as the title of a textbook published in New York.
* Robert McCance and Elsie Widdowson publish the standard text &quot;The Chemical Composition of Foods&quot;.

==Computer science==
* January 8 – In the history of computing hardware, Bell Labs&#x27; Complex Number Computer, a relay-based calculator for complex numbers, is completed under the direction of George Stibitz in New York City.
* May–August – Alan Turing and Gordon Welchman at the United Kingdom Government Code and Cypher School, Bletchley Park, design the British Bombes to help decrypt Wehrmacht Enigma machine signals.
* September 9 – George Stibitz first demonstrates remote operation of a computer, using a modified teletype working over telegraph lines between an American Mathematical Society conference at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire and the Complex Number Computer in New York.

==Exploration==
* December – Finn Ronne and Carl Eklund of the United States Antarctic Service determine that Alexander I Land is an island.

==Mathematics==
* Friedrich Wilhelm Levi introduces the Levi graph in a series of lectures on finite geometry at the University of Calcutta.

==Medicine==
* At Johns Hopkins Hospital in the United States, Dr. Austin T. Moore (1899–1963) performs the first metallic hip replacement surgery.
* German optometrist Heinrich Wöhlk produces fully plastic contact lenses.

==Metallurgy==
* William Justin Kroll devises the Kroll process.

==Physics==
* January 5 – FM radio demonstrated to the FCC for the first time.
* March – Frisch–Peierls memorandum: Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls, at this time working at the University of Birmingham in England, calculate that an atomic bomb could be produced using very much less enriched uranium than has previously been supposed, making it a practical proposition.
* April 10 – MAUD Committee first convened in Britain to consider the feasibility of an atomic bomb.
* Cavity magnetron invented by John Randall and Harry Boot.
* Spontaneous fission first observed by Georgy Flyorov and Konstantin Petrzhak.

==Technology==
* May 26 – First free flight of Igor Sikorsky&#x27;s Vought-Sikorsky VS-300 helicopter, in the United States.
* September 21 – American Bantam deliver the first prototype BRC Quarter-Ton General Purpose Vehicle – the four-wheel drive Jeep, designed by Karl Probst.
* November 7 – The new Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapses due to aeroelastic flutter.
* Donald Leslie demonstrates the Leslie speaker, intended as an adjunct to the Hammond organ.

==Other events==
* September–November – The Tizard Mission, a British technical and scientific mission, exchanges information on wartime scientific advances with the United States, including radar (in particular a greatly improved cavity magnetron), Frank Whittle&#x27;s jet engine, the Frisch–Peierls memorandum on feasibility of an atomic bomb and work of the &#x27;Tube Alloys&#x27; project on production of enriched uranium.

<text>Aleksey Mironovich Yachmenev (; 1866–1937) was an Aleut chief who lived in Unalaska. Along with Leontiy Sivtsov, Yachmenev accompanied Waldemar Jochelson on his 1909-1910 ethnological studies on the Aleut.

His son, John Yatchmeneff, wrote down the texts for John P. Harrington&#x27;s 1941 work on the Aleut language.
