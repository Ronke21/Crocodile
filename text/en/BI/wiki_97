<text>The Distinguished Service Order (DSO) is a military award of the United Kingdom, as well as formerly throughout the Commonwealth, awarded for operational gallantry for highly successful command and leadership during active operations, typically in actual combat. 

Equal in British precedence of military decorations to the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross and Royal Red Cross, since 1993 the DSO is eligible to all ranks awarded specifically for &quot;highly successful command and leadership during active operations&quot;. 

== History ==
Instituted on 6 September 1886 by Queen Victoria by Royal Warrant published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 9 November, the first DSOs awarded were dated 25 November 1886.

The order was established to recognise individual instances of meritorious or distinguished service in war. It is a military order, and was, until recently, typically awarded to officers in command above the rank of major (or equivalent), with awards to lower ranks usually being for a high degree of gallantry, just short of deserving the Victoria Cross.

Whilst normally given for service under fire or under conditions equivalent to service in actual combat with the enemy, a number of awards made between 1914 and 1916 were under circumstances not under fire, often to staff officers, causing resentment among front-line officers. After 1 January 1917, commanders in the field were instructed to recommend this award only for those serving under fire.

From 1916, bars could be authorised for subsequent award of the DSO, worn on the ribbon of the original award.

In 1942, the award was extended to officers of the Merchant Navy who had performed acts of gallantry whilst under enemy attack. 

Prior to 1943, the DSO could be awarded to only commissioned officers of the Lieutenant-Colonel rank and above, for &#x27;meritorious or distinguished service in wartime&#x27; under conditions of actual combat. If awarded to an officer ranking below Lieutenant-Colonel, it had to be a case of &#x27;a high degree of gallantry just short of deserving the Victoria Cross&#x27;. In either case, being &#x27;Mentioned in Despatches&#x27; was a pre-condition for appointment to the Distinguished Service Order.

The stipulation that only those mentioned in despatches could be appointed to the Order was removed in 1943.

== Modern era ==
Since 1993, reflecting the review of the British honours system which recommended removing distinctions of rank in respect of operational awards, the DSO has been open to all ranks, with the award criteria redefined as &quot;highly successful command and leadership during active operations&quot;. At the same time, the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross was introduced as the second-highest award for gallantry. Despite some very fierce campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, the DSO has yet to be awarded to a non-commissioned rank.

The DSO was previously awarded throughout the Commonwealth but by the 1990s most, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, were had established their own honours systems no longer recommending British honours.

== Nomenclature ==
Recipients of the Order, formally styled Companions of the Distinguished Service Order, are entitled to use as post-nominal letters. All awards are announced in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;.

== Description ==
* The decoration signifying the award of the DSO is a silver-gilt (gold until 1889) cross with curved ends, wide, enamelled white and edged in gilt. It is manufactured by Messrs Garrard &amp; Co, the Crown Jewellers.
* In the centre of the obverse, within a green enamelled laurel wreath, is the Imperial Crown in gold upon a red enamelled background. The reverse has the Royal Cypher of the reigning monarch in gold within a similar wreath and background.
* A ring at the top of the decoration attaches to a ring at the bottom of a gilt suspension bar, ornamented with laurel. Since 1938 the year of award engraved on the back of the suspension bar. At the top of the ribbon is a second gilt bar ornamented with laurel.
* The decorations are issued unnamed but some recipients have had their names engraved on the reverse of the suspension bar.
* The red ribbon is wide with narrow blue edges.
* The Bar for an additional award is plain gold with an Imperial Crown in the centre. Since about 1938, the year of the award has been engraved on the back of the Bar. A rosette is worn on the ribbon in undress uniform to signify the award of each Bar.

==Recipients==

===Numbers awarded===
From 1918 to 2017, the Distinguished Service Order was awarded approximately 16,935 times, in addition to 1,910 bars. The figures to 1979 are laid out in the table below, the dates reflecting the relevant entries in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;:
In addition, approximately 90 DSOs were awarded between 1980 and 2017, including awards for the Falklands, Gulf, Iraq and Afghanistan Wars, in addition to three Bars. The above figures include awards to the Commonwealth. 

* In all, 1,220 DSOs were awarded to Canadians, plus 119 first bars and 20 second Bars. 
* From 1901 to 1972, when the last Australian to receive the DSO was announced, 1,018 awards were made to Australians, plus 70 first Bars and one second Bar. 
* The DSO was awarded to over 300 New Zealanders during the two World Wars. 
* At least 14 Indian officers of the British Indian Army (i.e., until 1947) were awarded the DSO, with one in the First World War and 13 in the Second World War. The higher number awarded during the latter was due to the gradual Indianization of the British Indian Army from 1923 (see: South Asian Companions of the Distinguished Service Order).
* Honorary awards to members of allied foreign forces include at least 1,329 for the First World War.

<doc id="355652" wikidata="Q907382" url="?curid=355652" title="Nagato Province">
<text>, often called , was a province of Japan. It was at the extreme western end of Honshū, in the area that is today Yamaguchi Prefecture. Nagato bordered on Iwami and Suō Provinces.

==History==
Although the ancient capital of the province was Shimonoseki, Hagi was the seat of the Chōshū &quot;han&quot; (fief or domain) during the Edo period. Nagato was ruled by the Mōri clan before and after the Battle of Sekigahara.

In 1871 with the abolition of feudal domains and the establishment of prefectures (&quot;Haihan Chiken&quot;) after the Meiji Restoration, the provinces of Nagato and Suō were combined to eventually establish Yamaguchi Prefecture. At the same time, the province continued to exist for some purposes. For example, Nagato is explicitly recognized in treaties in 1894 (a) between Japan and the United States and (b) between Japan and the United Kingdom.

Historically, the oligarchy that came into power after the Meiji Restoration of 1868 had a strong representation from the Chōshū province, as Itō Hirobumi, Yamagata Aritomo, and Kido Kōin were from there. Other natives famous for their role in the restoration include Yoshida Shōin, Takasugi Shinsaku, and Kusaka Genzui among others.

The Japanese battleship &quot;Nagato&quot; was named after this province.

==Shrines and temples==

&quot;Sumiyoshi jinja&quot; was the chief Shinto shrine (&quot;ichinomiya&quot;) of Nagato.

<doc id="355653" wikidata="Q648629" url="?curid=355653" title="Nagoya Castle">
<text>is a Japanese castle located in Nagoya, Japan.

Nagoya Castle was constructed by the Owari Domain in 1612 during the Edo period on the site of an earlier castle of the Oda clan in the Sengoku period. Nagoya Castle was the heart of one of the most important castle towns in Japan, Nagoya-juku, a post station on the Minoji road linking two of the important Edo Five Routes, the Tōkaidō and the Nakasendō. Nagoya Castle became the core of the modern Nagoya and ownership was transferred to the city by the Imperial Household Ministry in 1930. Nagoya Castle was partially destroyed in 1945 during the Pacific War and the reconstruction and repair of the castle has been ongoing since 1957.

&quot;Meijō&quot; (名城), another shortform way of pronouncing Nagoya Castle (名古屋城), is used for many Nagoya city institutions such as Meijō Park, the Meijō Line of the Nagoya Municipal Subway, and Meijo University, reflecting the cultural influence of this historic structure. The castle has also historically been called &quot;Kinjō&quot; (金城), which means &quot;Golden Castle&quot;, and Kinjo Gakuin University is named after it.

== History ==

In order to advance into Owari Province, the military governor of Suruga Province, Imagawa Ujichika, built Yanagi-no-maru, a precursor castle at Nagoya, between 1521 and 1528 during the Taiei era for his son, Imagawa Ujitoyo. It was located near the site of the later Ninomaru residence. Oda Nobuhide seized it from Imagawa Ujitoyo in March 1532 (Kyōroku 5), residing there and changing the name to Nagoya Castle. His son, Oda Nobunaga, was supposedly born there in 1534 (Tenbun 3), although this is subject to debate. After he defeated Oda Nobutomo at Kiyosu Castle in April 1555 (Kōji 1), he established his residence there. Around 1582 (Tenshō 10), the castle at Nagoya was abandoned.

After various upheavals in Japan, Tokugawa Ieyasu emerged victorious and decided in November 1609 (Keichō 14) to rebuild the castle at Nagoya. Up until the Meiji Restoration, Nagoya Castle flourished as the castle where the Owari branch, the foremost of the three Tokugawa clan lineages, resided. Castle construction technology had been extensively developed and consolidated since the construction of Azuchi Castle in 1576 by Oda Nobunaga (1534–1582). One of the main architects who designed and directed the building of the castle was Nakai Masakiyo, who was previously involved in the construction of the Nijō, Fushimi, Edo, and Sunpu castles. He had gathered and refined existing castle and fortification construction technology and techniques and ultimately formulated the standards for the Tokugawa shogunate&#x27;s castles, as exemplified by Nagoya Castle.

===Early restoration and expansion===
In January 1610 (Keichō 15), the site was roped off and work began. Tokugawa Ieyasu ordered various &quot;daimyō&quot; to help with the construction of what was to become the new capital of the existing Owari Province. Katō Kiyomasa, Fukushima Masanori, and Maeda Toshimitsu were among the 20 feudal lords from the northern and western part of Japan who were assigned to assist in the project. The inscriptions of feudal lords and their vassals, carved on the stones they carried, are still visible today. In August 1610 the stone foundation of the main keep (&quot;tenshu&quot;) was completed, and by December construction of the stone walls for the Honmaru, Ninomaru, Nishinomaru, and Ofukemaru buildings was almost finished. In June 1611 (Keichō 16) a canal that today is the Hori River was built. The source for much of the building material for the new castle was the smaller Kiyosu Castle, including its &quot;tenshu&quot;, which was rebuilt as the northwest turret. In mid-1612 (Keichō 17), the construction of Honmaru Palace began, and the main keep was completed in December of that year.

Artists including Kanō Sadanobu painted the walls, ceilings, and sliding doors of Honmaru Palace in 1614 (Keichō 19). Construction of the gates and the Sannomaru moat were completed in July, and in November of that year the Shōgun Tokugawa Hidetada came for an inspection. Honmaru Palace was finished in February 1615 (Keichō 20) and Ninomaru Palace in 1617 (Genna 3). The Tōshō-gū shrine was established in the Sannomaru enceinte in 1619 (Genna 5), and the northwest turret, the former Kiyosu Tower of the Ofukemaru, was completed. In 1620 (Genna 6), Tokugawa Yoshinao (1601–1650) moved into Ninomaru Palace, where in 1627 (Kan&#x27;ei 4), a sanctuary was also constructed.

Overall renovation began on Honmaru Palace in May 1633 (Kan&#x27;ei 10) in preparation of the upcoming visit of Shōgun Tokugawa Iemitsu on his way to the imperial capital at Kyoto. Additional chambers, bathrooms, and halls, such as Jorakuden and Oyudonoshoin, were constructed. Kanō Tan&#x27;yū and other artists painted the walls, ceilings, and sliding doors in the new extensions in 1634 (Kan&#x27;ei 11). Work was completed in June, just in time for the shōgun&#x27;s visit in July of that year.

For the next hundred years there was ongoing maintenance and renovation of the existing structures. In 1669 (Kanbun 9), repairs were made to the main keep walls and roofs. In November 1685 (Jōkyō 2), repairs were again made to the main keep roof; in March 1709 (Hōei 6) to the first and second stories of the main keep; in August 1720 (Kyōhō 5) to the &quot;chidorihafu&quot; gables on the third and fourth levels of the main keep; and in December 1726 (Kyōhō 11) to the third-level roofs, &quot;karahafu&quot; gables, the fourth-level roofs, and the copper tiles of the fifth-level roofs of the main keep. Repairs were also made to the golden &quot;shachi&quot; of the main keep, replacing their wooden core. Further work was carried out in August 1728 (Kyōhō 13) on the shingled roof of Honmaru Palace, remodeling it into a lightweight, informal roof. Repairs were made to the second-, third-, and fourth-level roofs of the main keep.

In November 1730 (Kyōhō 15), the golden &quot;shachi&quot; were recast for the first time and covered in wire mesh. In 1752 (Hōreki 2), the large-scale &quot;Restoration of Hōreki&quot; corrected the tilt of the keep, caused by unequal subsidence of its stone wall, and the roofs from the second level upward were tiled with copper. By 1788 (Tenmei 8), the accumulated debt of the Owari branch since 1767 (Meiwa 4) amounted to 215,000 ryō. As a result, the golden &quot;shachi&quot; had to be melted down and recast with less gold in 1827 (Bunsei 10). A finer wire mesh covered the &quot;shachi&quot; to hide the fact that they were less golden. In 1846 (Kōka 3), they were again melted down and recast for a third time.

===19th and 20th centuries===

Law and order broke down as the Tokugawa Shogunate came to an end. The Aomatsuba Incident took place in February 1868 (Keiō 4) in the Ninomaru Palace, and a stone memorial stele was erected in the 1926. After the end of the Shogunate, the Owari branch decided to submit to the emperor. In 1870 (Meiji 3), Tokugawa Yoshikatsu had parts of the castle demolished and donated the golden &quot;shachi&quot; to the Imperial Household Department. They were removed from the main keep in April 1871 (Meiji 4), transported by steamship from Atsuta port to Tokyo, and were taken to numerous locations in Japan as a traveling exhibition. The male &quot;shachi&quot; was displayed at the Yushima Seido Exposition in 1872 and the female at the 1873 Vienna World Exposition.

In May 1872 the 3rd Division of the Tokyo Garrison was stationed at the castle and the Nagoya Detached Garrison and barracks were installed on the castle grounds. The demolition of the castle was put on hold after the German minister to Japan, Max von Brandt, spoke out against it. In December 1879 (Meiji 12), the imperial war minister Yamagata Aritomo decided to have the castle preserved on the advice of Colonel Nakamura Shigeto.

The 1891 Mino–Owari earthquake in October 1891 (Meiji 24) seriously damaged the southwest and &quot;Tamon&quot; turrets and other structures. Reconstruction and repair work followed, but not everything was rebuilt. In 1893 (Meiji 26), the castle was transferred to the Imperial Household Ministry and in June its name was changed to &quot;Nagoya Detached Palace&quot; or when the castle was designated as a formal imperial residence. On May 20, 1906 (Meiji 39), the grounds were opened to the public for one day for the National Railroad Five Thousand Miles Celebration. In March 1910 (Meiji 43), bronze &quot;shachi&quot; brought from Edo Castle were added to the roofs of the small keep and corner turrets. In February 1911 (Meiji 44), the former Hasuike Gate of Edo Castle was transported and reconstructed on the remains of the Nishinomaru-Enoki Gate, which today is used as the main visitors gate. In 1923 (Taishō 12), the southwest turret was repaired.

On December 11, 1930 (Shōwa 5), ownership of the castle was transferred from the Imperial Household Ministry to the City of Nagoya, thus abolishing its status as an imperial villa. In the same month, 24 structures on the castle grounds were designated as national treasures. On February 11, 1931 (Shōwa 6), the grounds were opened to the general public. The next decade saw conservation and archaeological activities and the castle was scientifically documented. In May 1932 (Shōwa 7), a field survey and measurement of the castle were carried out. In July of that year, the old &quot;Kayanoki&quot; (Japanese nutmeg) tree in the Nishinomaru was designated as a national monument. In December the castle was designated a historical site. In 1936 (Shōwa 11), the Sarumen Tea House (猿面) in the Ninomaru was designated as a national treasure. In June 1942 (Shōwa 17), some of the Honmaru Palace paintings were designated as national treasures. Most of the sliding doors and paintings were put into storage as the Pacific War threatened the Japanese mainland.
During the Pacific War the castle was used as the Tokai district army headquarters and the administration office of the Nagoya POW camp. The aerial bombardments of Nagoya by the United States Army Air Forces as part of the air raids on Japan brought the most destruction to the castle in its entire history. In January 1945 (Shōwa 20), the Sarumen Tea House was destroyed in air raids. On May 14, the main keep, small keep, golden &quot;shachi&quot;, Honmaru Palace, northeast turret, and other buildings were completely destroyed in air raids. In June of that year, some of the paintings saved from Honmaru Palace were moved for safekeeping to the Haiho Shrine, Toyota-shi. They returned in May 1946 (Shōwa 21).

The castle&#x27;s surviving former national treasures, which included the southwest, southeast, and northwest turrets, the Omote-Ninomon Gate, and some of the Honmaru Palace paintings were redesignated as Important Cultural Assets by the national government. In 1953 the southeast turret was dismantled for repairs. The Ninomaru Garden was designated a place of scenic beauty. In June 1955 (Shōwa 30), most of the Honmaru Palace paintings—and exactly a year later, the ceiling panel paintings—were designated national important culture assets. In 1957 (Shōwa 32), reconstruction of the castle keeps was started. Second-generation golden &quot;shachi&quot; were cast in the Osaka Mint and transported to the castle. On October 3, 1959, reconstruction of the two keeps was completed, and the buildings were opened to the public. The next few decades saw further renovation work. In March 1964 (Shōwa 39), the northwest turret was dismantled for repairs. In 1967 (Shōwa 42), the Ninomon of the western iron gate was dismantled for repairs. In 1972 (Shōwa 47), the stone walls at the west side of the East Iron Gate of the Ninomaru were dismantled. The wooden Ninomon was dismantled and later rebuilt at the east Ninomon Gate of the Honmaru.
===21st century and future plans===
In preparation for Expo 2005, English-language plaques were added to most displays, and a 3D movie showing the paintings in was created for the anticipated large number of visitors. Reconstruction work of the destroyed Honmaru Palace began in 2009 and was completed by 2018. Nagoya mayor Takashi Kawamura announced plans in 2009 to completely reconstruct in wood the main towers that were destroyed during the Pacific War, just as in the original structure. The budget to reconstruct the main towers was estimated at billions of yen. After negotiations with the national authorities, the plan was approved and in July 2017 the city officially launched the fundraising campaign. The platform for international online donations opened in 2020. The goal was to reconstruct the main tower by 2022. Collection of necessary &quot;hinoki&quot; timber started in the forests of Gifu prefecture in 2019.

The city has plans to further restore &quot;Honmaru&quot; and &quot;Ninomaru&quot; structures where photographic evidence and architectural drawings exist such as various turrets, gates and defensive walls. This would also entail moving out existing modern structures on the grounds.

== Layout ==
The castle complex is made up of five enceintes divided by an outer (&quot;Soto-bori&quot;) and inner moat (&quot;Uchi-bori&quot;). Each enceinte is protected by walls with turrets strategically located at each corner. Access from one enceinte to the next was controlled by guarded gates that were accessible by bridges. The castle is a good example of the type built on flat land.

The Honmaru enceinte is in the centre of the complex, containing the main and minor keep, along with the palace. The Ninomaru enceinte is located to the east, the Nishinomaru to the west, the Ofukemaru, also known as the Fukaimaru, to the northwest, and the Sannomaru around the east and south. To the north was the &quot;Ofuke-niwa&quot; (御深井庭) or &quot;Ofuke-oniwa&quot; (御深井御庭). The Ofuke Garden was a pleasure garden centering on a large pond that was left over from the low marshland that existed on the north side of the castle when the castle was built, and served as a defense. The pond had a number of small islands and the area was cultivated as a Japanese garden. This part became the public Meijō Park in 1931. Located west of the Ofuke Garden was lord Tokugawa Naritomo&#x27;s &quot;Shin Goten&quot; (新御殿 New Palace) in what is today Horibata-chō (堀端町).

The larger Sannomaru enceinte used to be buffered by two moats and encircled the inner castle enceintes from the east and the south. Various temples and villas, as well as administrative buildings, were located on its grounds. On the eastern side, the large stone foundations of the Sannomaru East Gate are still visible. Located in the Sannomaru enceinte were the Tōshō-gū shrine and the Tennosha shrine, which housed the guardian deity of the castle. Both shrines played an important role in the religious life of the castle, and rituals and festivals were held in honour of the spirits enshrined. Both shrines were moved in the late 19th century during the Meiji era. None of the other original wooden structures of the Sannomaru have survived, but the area is still the administrative center of the city of Nagoya and the surrounding Aichi Prefecture, with Nagoya City Hall, the Aichi Prefectural Government Office, and other administrative buildings and offices being located there. Roads and areas such as Sotobori-dori (Outer Moat Road) and Marunouchi begin at the castle.

=== Corner turrets === 
These turrets were used as a storage area for weapons and armour in times of peace, and served as an encampment from which to mount attacks in an emergency. Because they were erected on the corners of enclosures within the castle grounds making for strategic watchtowers, they are often called corner turrets. 

The castle had originally at least 11 corner turrets. The southeast, southwest and northwest corner turrets are the three which remain in the Honmaru, and have been designated by the national government originally as National Treasures, later as Important Cultural Properties. 

These are long, narrow slits with coverings opened in the floor. The holes were colloquially called &quot;rock chutes&quot; but they were not used simply for dropping stones and other objects. The chutes were brilliantly designed so that guns could be fired downwardly over a wider area. They are made so that those looking from outside cannot immediately recognize where the chutes are located. The southeast and southwest corner turrets located at the Hommaru are installed the second floor bay window. 

Architecturally there are two roofs making the turret look as if they have two stories, but in reality there are three floors (二重三階 &quot;nijyu-sankai&quot;). The first and second floor aspects are the same size. Also the third floor aspect is smaller than the first and second one by two &quot;ken&quot; (3.6 meters) on a side. The northeast corner turret that burned down during the Pacific War had a similar structure except for the difference in the design of the projecting bay windows (出窓 &quot;de-mado&quot;).

== &quot;Nishinomaru&quot; ==

=== &quot;Nishinomaru Enokida&quot; Gate ===

The &quot;Nishinomaru Enokida&quot; Gate (西之丸 榎多門 &quot;Nishinomaru enokidamon&quot;) is used today as the main entrance (正門 &quot;seimon&quot;) to the castle. The original structure was built as a tower gate (&quot;yagura mon&quot;). A smaller front gate to the south was called Kabuki Gate (冠木門 &quot;Kabukimon&quot;) and a rectangular-shaped barbican tower was built on top of the surrounding stone walls. Together the structures formed a square called &quot;Masugata Koguchi&quot; (桝形虎口) where the enemy could be encircled. The gate formed an important part of the castle&#x27;s defenses, being the main portal into the western &quot;Nishinomaru&quot; (西之丸) enceinte.

It sustained major damage in the 1891 Mino–Owari earthquake and the Hasuike Gate (蓮池門 &quot;Hasuikemon&quot;) dating from Genroku 17 (1704) was relocated here from the former Edo Castle in Tokyo in 1911 as a replacement. This gate however completely burnt down in an air raid in 1945 and was reconstructed with reinforced concrete in 1959.

=== &quot;Kaya&quot; tree ===

An old &quot;Kaya&quot; (&quot;Torreya nucifera&quot;) tree is located close to the &quot;Nishinomaru-enokida&quot; Gate to the north. Its height is 16 metres and it is eight metres at the base. Over 600 years old, the tree was already there when the castle was constructed. It is the only government-designated natural monument in Nagoya. The tree regained its viability despite damage from air raids in 1945. Tokugawa Yoshinao, the first feudal lord of Owari, and thus the castle, is said to have decorated his dinner tray with &quot;torreya&quot; nuts from this tree before going into battle in Osaka, and later for New Year&#x27;s celebrations.

=== Warehouses===
Located behind the &quot;Kaya&quot; tree is the former site of the warehouses and rice granaries (米倉 &quot;komegura&quot;). These were six long-shaped buildings running parallel to the Cormorant&#x27;s Neck moat. After the Pacific War the Nishinomaru Exhibit Hall was located here and was replaced with two buildings that were rebuilt in the appearance of the former warehouses to house the new exhibition space. The new Nishinomaru Okura Museum (西の丸御蔵城宝館 &quot;Nishinomaru Okura Jōhōkan&quot; Nishinomaru Warehouses Castle Treasure Hall) is located where the third and fourth warehouses were and was opened on November 1, 2021 and exhibits important cultural properties such as the &quot;fusuma&quot; paintings of the Honmaru Palace. It also showcases the history and persons of the castle. Further excavations will be carried out in the future to reveal and clarify the original layout of the storehouses.

=== &quot;Ote Umadashi&quot; ===
The &quot;Ote Umadashi&quot; was once a small defensive wall in front of the Second Front Gate on the front side of the castle wall. A moat once served to protect this point and the &quot;Nishinomaru&quot;, but it was filled in when the area was turned into an imperial detached palace from 1893 to 1930 because it disrupted the flow of carriage traffic.

== &quot;Honmaru&quot; ==

The &quot;Honmaru&quot; is the central enceinte. It encompasses the primary residential palace of the Owari lords and the two main towers and is encompassed by turrets and gates. Registered by the government as a National Treasure, it was destroyed during aerial bombardments of the Pacific War. It was rebuilt using original methods and materials and reopened to the public in 2018.

The &quot;fusuma&quot; were from the Kanō school and along with the ceiling panels survived the war as they were in storage. Based on the originals and detailed photographs and plans, reproductions were made using the same techniques and materials from that time under the supervision of &quot;Nihonga&quot; painter Katō Junko (painter) (加藤純子).

Initially used as the primary residence of the Owari lords, it was later converted to a guesthouse and administrative office when the court moved to the Ninomaru. The palace has over 30 rooms and covers an area of 3,100 square metres. The architecture is in the formal &quot;shoin-zukuri&quot; style.

The palace is divided into various areas:

* &quot;Omote Shoin&quot; (表書院 Main Hall) 
* &quot;Taimenjo&quot; (対面所 Reception Hall)
* &quot;Jorakuden&quot; (上洛殿 Shogun Accommodation Facilities)
* &quot;Kuroki Shoin&quot; (黒木書院 Inner Reception Hall) 
* &quot;Oyudono Shoin&quot; (湯殿書院 Bathing Room)

While the majority of the palace&#x27;s halls and rooms are a museum, some rooms were no decoration exists such as the Peacock Room can be used for seminars and events. 

=== Southwest turret ===

The southwest turret (南西隅櫓 &quot;Seinan-sumi Yagura&quot;) is also called the &quot;Hitsuji-saru&quot; (未申 goat-monkey) turret because these two animals denoted the direction of the earthly branches. It is three stories tall with a two-level roof. On the west and south sides, trap doors project below the lower-level roof, which were designed for dropping stones on attackers in defense of the castle. The symbol of the chrysanthemum, the Imperial Seal of Japan, can be seen on the ridge-end tiles.

This tower and its stone wall were damaged during the great Nobi earthquake in 1891 and repaired in 1923 under orders of the Imperial Household Ministry. It is designated an Important Cultural Asset.

=== Southeast turret ===

Called the &quot;Tatsumi&quot; turret, the southeast turret (東南隅櫓 &quot;Tōnan-sumi Yagura&quot;) looks like it has two stories, but it actually has three. The white coating on the mud walls made the structure both waterproof and fireproof. The southeast turret is similar to the southwest turret. The construction adheres to the original Tokugawa design. The symbol of a hollyhock, the crest of the Tokugawa clan, can be seen on the ridge-end tiles. The turret has been designated an Important Cultural Asset.

=== South gate ===

Many of the gates of Nagoya Castle have a square layout, and the stone walls include several large stones to demonstrate the castle&#x27;s defense capabilities.

The second south gate (本丸南二之門 &quot;Minami-ninomon&quot;) is the outer structure that leads from the &quot;Nishinomaru&quot; into the inner &quot;Honmaru&quot; enceinte. It has heavy timber columns and a crossbar covered with especially-thick strong iron plates. On either side of the gate are rare examples of fireproofed plaster walls. It has a gabled and tiled roof. The door is latticed for reinforcement.
The first south gate (本丸南ー之門) was a tower gate (櫓門 &quot;yagura mon&quot;). A barbican tower was built on the stone walls to the north and west. This provided a structure whereby arrows could be fired at attacking enemy forces from three sides. The first south gate and the smaller second south gate along with the barbican formed a square, walled castle gate structure called &quot;Masugata Koguchi&quot; (枡形虎ロ). The wall section under the front part of the first gate was covered in wooden tiles, and the gate itself was iron-plated. Rocks could be dropped from a machine on the second store.

The whole gate structure was built around 1612. The barbican tower was damaged in the earthquake of 1891, and later completely removed. Detailed measurements and architectural drawings were made in the early Shōwa era. The first gate burnt down in the air raid of 1945, leaving only the stone basis and the smaller second gate. Since the second gate is in its original state, it has been designated an Important Cultural Asset.

=== East gate ===

The east gate was a structure similar to the south gate in its layout and appearance. It led from the &quot;Ninomaru&quot; into the &quot;Honmaru&quot; enceinte. It was also constructed around 1612. The First East Gate was a sturdy gate that formed a square together with the smaller outer second gate on the right. It also had a gabled, tile-roof along with the smaller gate. The barbican tower that formed the length of the square was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1891 and then removed. The remaining structures were destroyed in the air raid of 1945.
Located at the east gate is a very large stone built into the wall. According to legend, Katō Kiyomasa, a renowned general and castle engineer, hauled this large stone that was later named after him to the castle. But it is probable that this part of the castle&#x27;s foundation was constructed by Kuroda Nagamasa. Feudal lords who were ordered to build the stone walls carved their marks on their stones to distinguish them from the stones of other lords.

=== Northeast turret ===
Also called the &quot;Ushitora&quot; (ox-tiger 丑寅) turret due to its earthly branches position, the northeast turret (東北隅櫓 &quot;Tōhoku-sumi Yagura&quot;) had two stories. It was located close to the east gate. The white coating on the mud walls made the structure water- and fireproof. The northeast turret was similar to the southeast and southwest turret and had a similar structure except for the difference in the design of the projecting bay windows (出窓 &quot;de-mado&quot;).

It was destroyed during the Pacific War.

== Keeps ==
Nagoya Castle is known for its unique &quot;connected-keep&quot; style of construction, with the main keep of five stories on five different levels and a smaller keep of two levels joined by an abutment bridge. Evidence that another small keep was planned for the west side of the main keep can be found in traces of an entryway in the upper part of the stone wall foundation on that side. The entryway to the small keep was also planned for the west side. However, during the construction, the location was changed to where it is today. Traces of the original entryway remain inside the stone wall.

Various types of weapons were stored on the first level of the castle&#x27;s main keep. Flammable materials such as gunpowder were kept in facilities outside the castle.

The small and main keep both burned down during the Pacific War, and were reconstructed in 1959 with the use of modern materials such as steel beams and concrete. In 2017 the city announced the donation drive to completely reconstruct the keeps again in wood based on the original plans and surveys done before the war. The aim is to complete the main tower by 2022. The webpage for online donations was opened in 2020.

The job of constructing the castle walls was divided among twenty feudal lords, including Katō Kiyomasa. The walls of the keep were built by the Katō family and the cornerstones of the building bear the inscriptions of the family members in charge of the construction. Those of Katō and his retainers can be seen on the northeast corner. There are marks of figures of triangles in circles in the stone walls of the castle, as well as the rough outlines of folding fans, war fans, and other objects. These are called &quot;kokumon&quot; (carved crests), and represent the different &quot;daimyō&quot; lords and their vassals who were apportioned sections in the construction. The signs were carved into the stone so that there would be no mistake as to which lord contributed which stone in the transportation, and to avoid disputes. Some of the foundation stones of the main castle tower were moved to a lawn on the north side during the 1959 reconstruction due to damage from the immense heat of the fire and subsequent collapse of the tower.

The stone wall supporting the keep was constructed by a technique called &quot;ogi kobai&quot; or &quot;fan sloping&quot;, by which the upper part of the wall is curved outward like a fan. This wall is also called the Kiyomasa-style Crescent Stone Wall, after the general and engineer Katō Kiyomasa, who was in charge of its construction. The fan sloping technique was used to prevent swelling by curving the middle portion of the wall inward, thereby evenly balancing the stone weight against the pressure of sand and earth within.

There is a roofless corridor between the main and the small keep. The walls in this corridor were earthen and stone. Mounted on the outer part of the west side are numerous 30 centimetre-long spearheads to thwart enemy troops from climbing over the eaves. A similar sword-fence can be found at the Fumei Gate, facing the east side of the main keep.

=== Golden &quot;shachi&quot; ===
There are two golden &quot;shachi&quot; (金鯱, &quot;kinshachi&quot;) on either end of the topmost castle roof. A beast from Japanese mythology, &quot;shachi&quot; are tiger-headed dolphins or carp considered to have control over the rain. As such, they were employed in traditional Japanese architecture as a talisman to prevent fires. They first appeared in the Muromachi Era (1334–1400) and also served as a symbol of the lord&#x27;s authority.

The original &quot;shachi&quot; were formed over a roughly carved block of wood, over which lead sheets were applied. Copper was placed over the lead before the application of the final layer of gold, which was produced by pounding gold coins into thin sheets. It is said that the gold used amounted to a value of 17,975 &quot;ryō&quot; (taels), when converted from Keicho-period coins. The core of the golden &quot;shachi&quot; is composed of hinoki cypress; originally the foundation was &quot;sawara&quot; cypress.

The golden &quot;shachi&quot; were melted down and recast three times during the Edo period, when the Owari branch suffered severe economic hardship. When the &quot;shachi&quot; were recast in Bunsei 10 (1827), the purity of the gold was greatly decreased. In order to conceal the diminished luster, openings in the mesh in the protective bird screens built around the &quot;shachi&quot; were made smaller during the Kyōho period (1715–1735).

After the Meiji Restoration, there was a trend to abandon old ways, and plans were made to dismantle the castle keeps. During this time, the golden &quot;shachi&quot; were donated by the Owari branch to the imperial government. In Meiji 4 (1871) they were removed from the main keep and transported to Tokyo from Atsuta Port.

In March 1872 (Meiji 5), the male &quot;shachi&quot; was exhibited at the Yushima Seido Exhibition in Tokyo, considered the founding event of the Tokyo National Museum. It was later displayed at regional expositions held in Ishikawa, Oita, Ehime, and Nagoya. The female &quot;shachi&quot; was exhibited at the World Exposition in Vienna in 1873. Later, when it was decided to preserve the keep, a movement to return the &quot;shachi&quot; was initiated. In Meiji 11 (1878), the golden &quot;shachi&quot; were returned to Nagoya and restored to their original position in February of the following year.

Later in Meiji 9 (1937), during an inspection by the Castle Imperial Grant Commemorative Committee, a thief climbed the scaffold and stole some of the golden fish scales. He was later caught in Osaka. Responsibility for this incident was traced back to city executives. Since the Meiji era, the golden &quot;shachi&quot; have been stolen three times.

The &quot;shachi&quot; were destroyed by fire during the Pacific War. The second-generation golden &quot;shachi&quot; were cast in the Osaka Mint and transported to the castle in March 1959 (Shōwa 39). Both &quot;kinshachi&quot; were lowered temporarily from atop the castle and displayed on the castle grounds briefly in September 1984 (Shōwa 59) for the Nagoya Castle Exhibition, and again from March 19 to June 19, 2005 (Heisei 17), at the site of the Expo 2005. They were restored to the top beam of the castle roof on July 9 of the same year.

The male and female &quot;shachi&quot; were again lowered by helicopter on March 8, 2021, for an exhibition during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The northern &quot;kinshachi&quot; is male, has a height of , weighs ( of which is gold), and has 112 scales. The southern &quot;kinshachi&quot; is female, has a height of , weighs (of which is gold), and has 126 scales. Both &quot;shachi&quot; are covered with 18-carat gold plate thick.

=== Palace Camellia ===

There was once a &quot;Camellia japonica&quot; tree somewhere in the garden south of Honmaru Palace. It was called Palace Camellia (御殿椿 &quot;Goten tsubaki&quot;). Since the Edo period this tree was considered to be a secret treasure of the Owari domain. It blossomed every spring producing large white flowers. The original tree was thought to have been killed when the castle burned down during an air raid in 1945, but new buds started to grow from the charred stump. The current tree was grafted from the original in 1955 and continues to grow today.

=== Fumei Gate ===

The Fumei Gate (&quot;Fumei-mon&quot;) is located in the Tamon Wall, which leads into the Honmaru. It was always locked securely and therefore known as &quot;the gate that never opens&quot;. The wall is called a &quot;sword wall&quot;, because spearheads under the eaves prevented penetration by spies or attackers. The gate was destroyed in an air raid on May 14, 1945. It was reconstructed to its original form in March 1978.

== &quot;Ninomaru&quot; ==

The is thought to have been completed in 1617. Tokugawa Yoshinao, the first feudal lord of Owari, moved to this palace from &quot;Honmaru&quot; Palace in 1620. Besides serving as the residence of the lord, the palace functioned as the administrative center of the feudal government. It was further extended and renovated in later years.

Three chief retainers of the Owari branch were executed in the &quot;Ninomaru&quot; Palace in 1868 in what became known as the Aomatsuba Incident. Early in the Shōwa period, around 1926, a monument was erected at the execution site. The exact site is unknown; it is thought to have taken place 100 metres south of the current site of the monument. The stone stele was re-erected after the original one disappeared.

The &quot;Ninomaru&quot; existed until the Kaei period (1848–54). Facilities for conducting clan affairs, residences for retainers, gardens, and stables (&quot;Mukaiyashiki&quot;) were located there. The western two-thirds of the area was known as the &quot;Oshiro&quot; (the castle), while the eastern one-third was called &quot;Ninomaru Goten&quot; (the palace). The gardens originally included flowering trees, stone lanterns, and a traditional Japanese-style tea arbour. After the Meiji Restoration, the original was demolished to build army barracks, but it was restored and designated as an official scenic spot after the war.

The palace had two stages for performances of Noh: the &quot;omote-butai&quot;, or front stage, and &quot;oku-butai&quot;, the rear stage. Noh was performed to commemorate a lord&#x27;s succession to a fiefdom and to celebrate the birth of an heir. The Tokugawas of Owari were patrons of many Noh actors, and the modern Nagoya Noh Theater, which opened in April 1997, is located in the &quot;Sannomaru&quot; enceinte.

The Tokugawa Art Museum has a partial reconstruction of the &quot;Ninomaru&quot; palace reception chambers, such as the &quot;Kusari-no-ma&quot; and the &quot;Hiro-ma&quot;, which include display alcoves, staggered shelves, and writing alcoves equipped with authentic furnishings. A reconstruction of one of the Noh stages of the &quot;Ninomaru&quot; can also be seen in the museum. 

Another stone stele is also located in the Ninomaru honouring the Tokugawa clan army methods. 
The ninth son of Tokugawa Ieyasu and leader of the Owari clan, Tokugawa Yoshinao, authored a book on warfare tactics called the &quot;Gunsho-gōkan&quot; (軍書合鑑). The inscriptions on this stone monument are 「王命に依って催さるる事」「藩訓秘伝之跡」.
The book, which was passed down from generation to generation, contains diverse Tokugawa family war tactics. The stone&#x27;s inscription is distinctive since it expresses a political philosophy of obeisance to the Emperor. At the start of the Meiji Restoration, the Tokugawa dynasty, who were in power at the time, announced that they would adhere to this idea and follow the Emperor. 

=== &quot;Ninomaru&quot; Second Great Gate ===
The &quot;Ninomaru&quot; Second Great Gate (二之丸大手二之門 &quot;Ninomaru Ōte Ni-no-mon&quot;) along with the &quot;Ichinomon&quot; (first gate), which has been dismantled, were known as the &quot;Nishikurogane&quot; gate and served as the main entrance to the &quot;Ninomaru&quot; enceinte. It is located on the south side of the west face of the Ninomaru. The remaining gate is in the &quot;Kōrai-mon&quot; (高麗門 &quot;Goryeo Gate&quot;) style. It is registered as an Important Cultural Property.

=== Former &quot;Ninomaru&quot; Second East Gate ===

The former &quot;Ninomaru&quot; Second East Gate (二之丸東二之門 &quot;Ninomaru Higashi Ni-no-mon&quot;), also called the East Iron Gate, was the outer gate of the &quot;Ninomaru&quot; enceinte on the east side. It was a box-like structure with two separate gates opening into and out of the enclosure. The remaining gate is in the &quot;Kōrai-mon&quot; (高麗門 &quot;Goryeo Gate&quot;) style. It was probably constructed around Keichō 17 (1614). In 1963 the gate was dismantled and stored temporarily to make way for the construction of the Aichi Prefectural Gymnasium. In 1972 the gate was relocated to the site of the old &quot;Honmaru&quot; east gate, where it stands today. The gate is inscribed as an Important Cultural Property.

=== Uzumi Gate ===

The Uzumi Gate (埋御門 Uzumi Go-mon) led to a tunnel that ran beneath the castle walls. This tunnel was the secret escape route to be used by the lord of the castle during times of emergency. The remains of the entrance can be found in the northwest part of the &quot;Ninomaru&quot; garden. Steep wooden stairs led down to the water moat. The lord could cross the moat by boat to reach the &quot;Ofukemaru&quot; garden on the opposite side. He could then use a secret escape route to reach the Kisokaidō by way of Doishita (土居下), Kachigawa (勝川), and Jōkō-ji (Seto).

=== &quot;Namban&quot; Wall ===

The remains of the &quot;Nanban&quot; (&quot;European&quot;) wall can be seen north of the &quot;Ninomaru&quot; garden, running from east to west on top of the stone wall. This sturdy wall was constructed using the European plaster method topped with tiles, and had many round gunports. Today this wall is considered to be a unique feature to Nagoya Castle and has been designed an important cultural asset.

=== &quot;Ninomaru&quot; garden ===
The garden of the &quot;Ninomaru&quot; palace was built between 1615 and 1623 under Tokugawa Yoshinao, at the same time when the palace was constructed. The sanctuary on the north side of the palace was its centrepiece. It was transformed into a Japanese dry landscape garden in 1716. According to the &quot;Oshiro Oniwa Ezu&quot; (御城御庭絵図), a historic drawing of the old castle garden, the &quot;Ninomaru&quot; palace garden was grand in scale, featuring Mt. Gongen (権現山) in the north, Mt. Sazae (栄螺山) in the west, a large pond in the south, and six tea houses in various locations around the garden. The boundaries around the garden featured pavilions, gates, and a library (御文庫). Many large rocks are within its boundaries. On top of the hill the thickly growing trees offered the lord protection from enemies by providing a hiding place and a secret escape route. These characteristics of the garden have faded over the years, but the basic structure still remains. The garden has been expanded and undergone restorations over the years, especially between 1818 and 1829/1830 under the tenure of Tokugawa Naritomo. During the early Meiji era, when Nagoya Castle was under the control of the Imperial Japanese Army, barracks were set up in the eastern part. Mt. Gongen was leveled and the pond was filled in. In 1975, part of the garden was excavated using old drawings as a guide. The garden was renovated mainly around four unearthed structures: the North and South Ponds, the site of the Soketsu-tei teahouse, and the so-called North Culvert. The four rebuilt structures form the main features of the garden. Also nearby are flowerbeds of peonies and other flowers. The garden was opened to the public in April 1978 and named the &quot;Ninomaru&quot; East Garden. The Ninomaru garden was designated a National Place of Scenic Beauty in 1953, with the area under protection expanded in 2018. Excavations started in 2016 to uncover the historic remains and plans exist to recreate the original layout and features.

This dry landscape garden covers an area of and is separated into north and south areas. The north half of the garden retains more of the shape of the original garden. The pond, surrounded by five artificial mountains, has several islands. There are various kinds of walkways around the garden, including a stone bridge, a mountain pathway, and a shoreline path. The pond represents a ravine with many round rocks.

The garden has many high-quality trees from various regions throughout Japan and some of them, including the pines, have medicinal uses. Located in the garden is a modern teahouse constructed of hinoki cypress from the Kiso region. A &quot;tatami&quot; mat room and a washing room are located inside.

==== North Culvert ====

The remains of a north culvert (北暗渠), or drain, located outside the garden on the northern boundary, depicted in &quot;Oshiro Oniwa Ezu&quot;, were found in the course of an excavation survey and faithfully restored. The drain is thought to be the remains of a stone culvert for channeling rainwater, as mentioned in the &quot;Kinjō Onkoroku&quot; (金城温古録) document. Even today, rainwater is channeled to the moat through this drain. The stone materials of the culvert include granite for the lid and hard sandstone for the sides. According to the drawing, there was also a flower bed nearby.

==== Tea houses ====

Six &quot;chashitsu&quot; tea houses were located in the old &quot;Ninomaru&quot; garden, which were the Tashun-en (多春園), Yamashita Oseki (山下御席), Yohō-tei (余芳), Fūshin-tei (風信), Sōketsu-tei (霜傑亭) and the &quot;Sarumen Chaseki&quot; (猿面茶席). Tashun-en was located at the northwest corner of the Ninomaru, the Yamashita Oseki in north at the foot of Mount Gongen, Yohō-tei in the centre, and Fūshin-tei towards the south next to the palace. The &quot;Sarumen Chaseki&quot; was located at the eastern border. A reconstruction of it is located in the tea house area of the &quot;Ofukemaru&quot; and in the Tokugawa Museum. The Sōketsu-tei (霜傑亭), the largest one, was located in the northeastern part and was built in the &quot;sukiya&quot; style. In an excavation survey, a site was identified almost exactly matching that of the Sōketsu-tei as depicted in &quot;Oniwa Ezu&quot;. Today, cobblestones are placed to mark where tatami mats would have been, rubble and plaster where the hallway was, and gravel on the other surfaces for an easy understanding of the original structure. 

When the old &quot;Ninomaru&quot; garden was destroyed, two teahouses were sold off to private citizens, dismantled and set up in different locations: 

The Yohō-tei (余芳) was a teahouse with four-and-a-half &quot;tatami&quot; size. In the first year of the Meiji era, it was acquired by a private individual. It was transferred twice more, in 1892 (Meiji 25) and 1939 (Showa 14), close to Higashi Ōte Station. It is registered by the city as a Cultural Property. In 2022 the city council debated the moving of the teahouse back. The Watanabe Komuten carpentry company was tasked with the restoration in preparation of the relocation.

The Fūshin-tei (風信) is located close to Jōshin Station in Nishi-ku. It is also registered by the city as a Cultural Property.

==== South Pond ====

In the historic &quot;Oshiro Oniwa Ezu&quot; drawing of the old castle garden a pond in the south (南池) is depicted with a large boat-shaped stone on the northern shore and an island of rocks in the middle. In an excavation survey, the large boat-shaped stone was not found, but it is believed that the island lies under three rocks that can be seen in the pond. The original pond is believed to have been deep, surrounded by sturdily piled rocks, and exceptionally large in scale, much larger than depicted in the drawing. Studies by the government are existing to restore this area back to its original appearance including water restoration.

== &quot;Ofukemaru&quot; ==
Formerly a marsh located on the northern edge of the Nagoya Plateau, the &quot;Ofukemaru&quot; (御深井丸) is said to have been reclaimed with pine and many other trees at the time of the castle&#x27;s construction. It is also known as the &quot;Fukaimaru&quot;.

Necessary arms and ammunition, in addition to those the retainers had in their own possession, were stored in the facilities called &quot;Ozutsu-gure&quot;, &quot;Tezutsu-gura&quot;, &quot;Migaki-gura&quot;, and &quot;Ana-gura&quot;. A &quot;Shio-gura&quot; (salt storehouse) was located in the eastern corner. The warehouses have almost all disappeared; in their place some teahouses were constructed after 1945. 

=== Nogi Warehouse ===

After the deployment of a garrison of the Imperial Army in 1872, the whole Sannomaru enceinte of the castle was placed under their control in 1874. The warehouse was probably constructed in 1880 (Meiji 13) as an army ammunition depot. It was named after General Nogi Maresuke, who was posted to Nagoya during the early Meiji era (1868–1912). It is the only warehouse that has survived in the Ofukemaru.

This warehouse is a one-story brick building with white plastered walls, small windows on the side, and a Japanese-styled tiled roof. Its size is 89.25 square metres: 12.28 metres from east to west, 8.6 metres from north to south, and 7.68 metres in height. The size of the ancillary gunpowder depot is 13.12 square metres. The building is characterised by its arched entrance, underfloor area, and white-coloured masonry plaster at the corners of the building. The doors are covered with copper sheets, and there are four small windows on the sides.

Although the Honmaru Palace was destroyed during the Pacific War, the screen and ceiling paintings were undamaged because they were stored in this warehouse. It is a Registered Tangible Cultural Property.

=== Northwest Turret ===

Also called &quot;Inui&quot; turret, the northwest turret is a three-storey structure with a roof at each level. The top layer, designed in the &quot;irimoya&quot; style, is covered with tiles. Many materials were taken from previous structures in Kiyosu Castle to construct this tower; it is therefore also called the &quot;Kiyosu&quot; turret. It is designated an important cultural asset.

Projections on the first-storey outer walls facing north and west are trapdoors from which stones could be dropped on attacking forces. They are disguised with gabled roofs. Unlike other corner turrets that still exist, the northwest turret also has gables on the east and south facing inside, thus projecting an image of balance and stability. Unlike the turrets of the &quot;Honmaru&quot; that have three floors but from the outside appear to only have two due to the number of roofs (a feature called &quot;Nijūsankai&quot; 二重三階), this turret has three roofs for three floors (&quot;Miesankai&quot; 三重三階).

=== &quot;Cormorant&#x27;s Neck&quot; moats ===

In places like the Ofukemaru and Nishinomaru Palaces the moat comes close to the castle wall. This was done to increase the defendability of the castle. This design is called the cormorant&#x27;s neck because it is so long and thin. Five of these cormorant-neck shaped moats still exist throughout the castle area.

=== Tea houses ===

The area close to the main keep was designated for tea houses (&quot;chashitsu&quot;) starting in 1949. Normally the houses are used for &quot;chakai&quot; tea ceremony gatherings, &quot;haiku&quot; gatherings and so on. The area is open to the public only twice a year. The houses are built in the traditional architectural style of tea houses with accompanying gardens.

&quot;Sarumen Chaseki&quot; (猿面茶席), formerly a National Treasure, was reconstructed in this place in 1949 (Shōwa 24).

&quot;Kinjō-en&quot; (金城苑 &quot;Golden Castle Garden&quot;) is a &quot;shoin&quot; (書院) hall that was designed by Morikawa Kanichirō (森川勘一郎 , 1887－1980), a regional tea master and expert on ancient culture. It contains a 10-&quot;tatami&quot;, an eight &quot;tatami&quot; and a five &quot;tatami&quot; room. The long girder in the front corridor was originally used as a flagpole when Emperor Showa visited Nagoya Castle on the way to his enthronement in 1928.

&quot;Yūin chaseki&quot; (又隠茶席) is a copy of the one built by Sen no Rikyū&#x27;s grandson, Sen no Sōtan (1578-1658). It was built during the An&#x27;ei years (1772-1780) and relocated to the castle. The name originated from the fact that Sōtan first built &quot;Konnichi-an&quot; (今日庵) and later built a new seat and retired to &quot;Yūin chaseki&quot;.

&quot;Oribe-dō&quot; (織部堂) is dedicated to the memory of Lord Furuta Oribe (1544–1615), a &quot;samurai&quot; warrior who served all three unifiers, and who was also an aesthete who developed Oribe ware and spread the practice of tea in Nagoya. The memorial hall was constructed in 1955.

Close to the tea houses is the Ofukemaru exhibition hall (御深井丸展示館) built in traditional style that houses various rotating exhibition on local arts, crafts and culture.

== &quot;Ofuke-niwa&quot; == 
North of the &quot;Ofukemaru&quot; across the moat was a large garden area with a lotus pond and smaller buildings called &quot;Ofuke-niwa&quot; (御深井庭) or &quot;Ofuke-oniwa&quot; (御深井御庭). A kiln was located in the Ofuke garden starting around 1670 where Ofukei ware, related to Seto ware, was produced. Another ceramic ware produced on an island is called Hagiyama ware. Both are classified as &quot;Oniwa-yaki&quot; (garden ware).

The southern part of the garden had three tea houses and smaller pavilions, while the northern half consisted of agricultural rice fields.

This area today is the Meijō Park.

== &quot;Sannomaru&quot; ==

The southern and easternmost part of the castle complex was the third enceinte &quot;Sannomaru&quot; (三の丸), which formed the border to the town. It was surrounded by moats, stone walls and had five gates from east to west the Shimizu-mon (清水門), Higashi-mon (東門) or Higashi Ōtemon (東大手門), Honmachi-mon (本町門), Misono-mon (御園門), and the Habashita-mon (巾下門). The northern part of the &quot;Sannomaru&quot; consisted of a number of shrines and temples to protect the castle, especially from east to west the &quot;Tennōsha&quot; (天王社), the &quot;Tōshō-gū&quot; (東照宮), along the &quot;Taitokuin-den&quot; (台徳院殿), the &quot;Taiyūin-den&quot; (大獸院殿), and the &quot;Genyūin-den&quot; (厳有院殿). The &quot;Tennōsha&quot; was dedicated to Susanoo-no-Mikoto, the &quot;Tōshō-gū&quot; to Tokugawa Ieyasu, the first &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Tokugawa shogunate, the &quot;Taitokuin-den&quot; to Tokugawa Hidetada, the second &quot;shōgun&quot;, the &quot;Taiyūin-den&quot; to Tokugawa Iemitsu, the third &quot;shōgun&quot;, and the &quot;Genyūin-den&quot; to Tokugawa Ietsuna, the fourth &quot;shōgun&quot;. 

The main part of the &quot;Sannomaru&quot; south of the shrines consisted of residences of important retainers. None of the residences survived into the modern era. The former vestibule of the Shimizu (志水家) residence was however saved and relocated to Jōshin as the main gate of the house of the Oya family. The Fushin-tei tea house, formerly in the Ninomaru, was also relocated to the garden of the house.

A number of stone basis of the entry gates and moats are still extant. The area is now occupied by governmental buildings. On the eastern side the Higashi Ōte Station is named after the site of the nearby Higashi Ōtemon (東大手門). The road around the moats is the &quot;Sotobori-dōri&quot; (Outer Moat Road). 

Located further south just outside of the &quot;Sannomaru&quot; was the &quot;Meirindō&quot; (明倫堂). This Confucian school was established in 1783 under the 9th lord of Owari Province, Tokugawa Munechika (1733-1799), as a school for clan retainers and officials. The school closed in 1871. The hall however was relocated and became the main hall of the Eishō-ji (永照寺) in Hashima, Gifu during the Meiji era.

The eastern part of the &quot;Sannomaru&quot; contained the &quot;Sannomaru Oyakata&quot; auxiliary residences of the Owari lords. The area was converted in the Meiji era to military grounds and later given to housing and Nagoya Medical Center. 

Located in the area are the subway stations such as Nagoyajo Station to the south and Meijō Kōen Station to the north. Nagoyajo Station&#x27;s exit 7 is constructed as a &quot;Kōrai-mon&quot;.

== Plants and animals ==
The Ninomaru gardens and other areas such as the Ofukemaru have a wide variety of flora. In spring, Japanese cherry, wisteria, camellia, and peony bloom. In the summer it is iris, crape myrtle, plantain lily, and hydrangea; in autumn the confederate rose, Japanese quince and crape myrtle, and in winter the Japanese witch hazel, Japanese quince, wintersweet, and Japanese plum that bloom. During the summer, Sika deer can be observed grazing in the moats that are dry and covered with grass. Various birds, such as ducks and songbirds, inhabit the castle grounds as their sanctuary in the middle of the city.

=== Chrysanthemum exhibition ===

The Nagoya Castle Chrysanthemum exhibition started after the end of the Pacific War. Chrysanthemum cultivation began in Japan during the Nara and Heian periods (early 8th to late 12th centuries), and gained popularity in the Edo period. Many flower shapes, colours, and varieties were created. The way the flowers were grown and shaped also developed, and chrysanthemum culture flourished. The event at the castle has become a tradition for the city. With three categories, it is one of the largest events of its kind in the region by both scale and content. The first category is the exhibition of cultivated flowers. The second category is for chrysanthemum bonsai flowers, which are combined with dead pieces of wood to give the illusion of miniature trees. The third category is the creation of miniature landscapes.

<text>Betacam is a family of half-inch professional videocassette products developed by Sony in 1982. In colloquial use, &quot;Betacam&quot; singly is often used to refer to a Betacam camcorder, a Betacam tape, a Betacam video recorder or the format itself.

All Betacam variants from (plain) analog recording Betacam to Betacam SP and digital recording Digital Betacam (and additionally, HDCAM and HDCAM SR), use the same shape videocassettes, meaning vaults and other storage facilities do not have to be changed when upgrading to a new format. The cassettes are available in two sizes: S (short or small) and L (long or large). The Betacam camcorder can only load S magnetic tapes, while television studio sized video tape recorders (VTR) designed for video editing can play both S and L tapes.

The cassette shell and case for each Betacam cassette is colored differently depending on the format, allowing for easy visual identification. There is also a mechanical key that allows a video tape recorder to identify which format has been inserted.

The format supplanted the three-quarter-inch U-Matic format, which Sony had introduced in 1971. In addition to improvements in video quality, the Betacam configuration of an integrated professional video camera/recorder led to its rapid adoption by electronic news gathering (ENG) organizations.

DigiBeta, the common name for Digital Betacam, went on to become the single most successful professional broadcast digital recording video tape format in history. However, by 2008, although Betacam remained in use in the field and for archiving, new tapeless digital products had led to a phasing out of Betacam products in television studio environments.

== Variants ==
=== Betacam and Betacam SP ===
==== Original Betacam format ====
The original Betacam format was launched on August 7, 1982. It is an analog component video format, storing the luminance, &quot;Y&quot;, in one track and the chrominance, on another as alternating segments of the R-Y and B-Y components performing &quot;Compressed Time Division Multiplex&quot;, or CTDM. This splitting of channels allows &quot;true&quot; broadcast quality recording with 300 lines of horizontal luminance resolution and 120 lines chrominance resolution versus 688 kHz chroma bandwidth for domestic Betamax and the professional U-Matic formats (~30 lines resolution left-to-right) on a relatively inexpensive cassette based format.

The original Betacam cassettes, loaded with ferric-oxide tape, were identical in overall design and size (15.1 × 9.5 × 2.5 cm) to consumer-grade Betamax, introduced by Sony in 1975. Betacam cassettes could be used in a Betamax VCR; likewise, a blank Betamax tape would work on a Betacam deck. However, in later years Sony discouraged this practice, suggesting that the internal tape transport of Betamax cassette was not well suited to the faster tape transport of Betacam. In particular, the guide rollers tend to be noisy.

(Some Sony Betacam oxide tapes also carry the domestic Beta (Betamax) logo.)

Although there is a superficial similarity between Betamax and Betacam in that they use the same tape cassette, they are really quite different formats. Betamax records relatively low-resolution video using a heterodyne color recording system and only two recording heads, while Betacam uses four heads to record in component format, at a much higher linear tape speed of 10.15 cm/s (3.99606 in./s) compared with Betamax&#x27;s 1.87 cm/s (0.7362205 in./s), resulting in much higher video and audio quality. A typical L-750 length Betamax cassette that yielded about 3 hours of recording time on a Betamax VCR at its B-II Speed (NTSC), or on PAL, only provided 30 minutes&#x27; record time on a Betacam VCR or camcorder. Another common point between Betamax and Betacam is the placement of the stereo linear audio tracks. Also, some Betacam and Betamax portables share the same batteries.

(Matsushita&#x27;s rival &quot;M&quot; and &quot;MII&quot; formats took a similar approach in combining the cassette from a non-professional system- in this case, VHS- with a much higher-quality recording format. However, neither enjoyed Betacam&#x27;s level of success).

Betacam was initially introduced as a camera line along with a video cassette player. The first cameras were the BVP-3, which utilized three Saticon tubes, the BVP-30, which utilized three Plumbicon tubes, and the BVP-1, which used a single tri-stripe SMF (Saticon Mixed Field) Trinicon tube. These three cameras could be operated standalone, or with their docking companion VTR, the BVV-1 (quickly superseded by the BVV-1A), to form the BVW-1 (BVW-1A) integrated camcorder. Those decks were record-only. The only transport controls on the deck were eject and rewind. The docked camera&#x27;s VTR button started and paused the tape recorder. Later the Betacam SP docking decks had full transport controls (except a record button) but tapes could not be played back except in the camera&#x27;s viewfinder in black-and-white only. Sony then came out with the playback adapter, the VA-500, a separate portable unit that connected via a multi-pin cable and had a composite video out jack for color playback. At first color playback required the studio source deck, the BVW-10, which could not record, only play back. It was primarily designed as a feeder deck for A/B roll edit systems, usually for editing to a one-inch Type C or three-quarter-inch U-matic cassette edit master tape. There was also the BVW-20 field playback deck, which was a portable unit with DC power and a handle, that was used to verify color playback of tapes in the field. Unlike the BVW-10, it did not have a built in time base corrector (TBC).

With the popular success of the Betacam system as a news acquisition format, the line was soon extended to include the BVW-15 studio player, and the BVW-40 studio edit recorder. The BVW-15 added dynamic tracking, which enabled clear still frame and jog playback, something the BVW-10 could not deliver. The BVW-40 enabled for the first time editing to a Betacam master, and if set up and wired correctly, true component video editing. It was also possible to do machine-to-machine editing between a BVW-10/15 and BVW-40 without an edit controller—a single serial cable between the units was all that was required to control the player from the recorder in performing simple assemble and insert editing. Additionally, there were two field models introduced, the field recorder BVW-25, and the BVW-21 play only portable field deck.

At its introduction, many insisted that Betacam remained inferior to the bulkier one-inch type C and B videotapes, the standard broadcast production formats of the late 1970s to mid-1990s. Additionally, the maximum record time for both the cameras and studio recorders was only half an hour, a severe limitation in television production. There was also the limitation that high-quality recording was only possible if the original component signals were available, as they were in a Betacam camcorder. If the recording started as composite video, re-converting them to components for recording and then eventually back to composite for broadcast caused a drop in quality compared to recording component video directly.

====Betacam SP====

In 1987, Betacam SP (commonly referred to as Beta SP) was released. It increased horizontal resolution to 340 lines. While the quality improvement of the format itself was minor, the improvement to the VTRs was enormous, particularly in quality and features. In addition to the existing cassette a larger cassette (25.3 × 14.4 × 2.5 cm) was introduced with 90 minutes of recording time. Betacam SP (for &quot;Superior Performance&quot;) became the industry standard for most TV stations and high-end production houses until the late 1990s. Despite the format&#x27;s age and its discontinuation in 2001, Betacam SP remained a common standard for standard-definition video post-production into the 2010s. The recording time is the same as for Betacam, 30 and 90 minutes for S and L, respectively. Tape speed is slightly slower in machines working in the 625/50 format, increasing tape duration by one minute for every five minutes of run time. So, a 90-minute tape will record 108 minutes of video in PAL.

Betacam SP is able to achieve its namesake &quot;Superior Performance&quot; over Betacam in the fact that it uses metal-formulated tape as opposed to Betacam&#x27;s ferric oxide tape. Sony designed Betacam SP to be partially forward compatible with standard Betacam, with the capability that Betacam SP tapes recorded on Betacam SP decks can be played in oxide-era Betacam VTRs (such as the BVW-15 and BVW-40 mentioned earlier), but for playback only. Betacam SP-branded tapes cannot be used for recording in consumer Betamax VCRs like oxide Betacam tapes, due to Betacam SP&#x27;s metal-formulation tape causing the video heads in a Betamax deck to wear prematurely, which are made of a softer material than the heads in a standard Betacam deck. However, Betacam SP tapes can be used without a problem in ED Beta VCRs, since the ED Beta format uses metal-formulated tape as well.

The new Betacam SP studio decks were the players: The BVW-60 and BVW-65 (the BVW-65 features Dynamic Tracking); and the Edit Recorders: the BVW-70, and the Dynamic Tracking model, the BVW-75. The BVV-5 was the Betacam SP dockable camera back, which could play back in color if its companion playback adapter was used. A new SP field recorder, the BVW-35, possessed the added benefit of a standard RS422 serial control port that enabled it to be used as an edit feeder deck. Though the four new studio decks could utilize the full 90-minute Betacam SP cassettes, the BVW-35 remained limited to the original Betacam small 30-minute cassette shells. Answering a need for a basic office player, Sony also introduced the BVW-22, a much less expensive desktop model that could be used for viewing and logging 90-minute cassettes of both Betacam SP and oxide types, but could not be configured into an edit system and offered only composite video output.

Sony followed up the SP field recorder BVW-50 that could record and play the large-size 90 minute cassettes. After this, the deck line was relatively stagnant and incredibly popular for a decade, aside from some specialty models that could record digital audio.

Until the introduction of the BVW-200 camera, the camera and recorder configuration was a docking system. The BVW-200 was an integrated camera recorder system. It sacrificed the flexibility of a docking camera in order to lose a substantial amount of weight. Eventually, non-docking camcorders became the most popular design by the mid-1990s.

The final Betacam SP camcorder was the BVW-D600, which paired a digital professional video camera front section, very similar to the one on the DigiBeta DVW-700, with an integrated Betacam SP recorder. Like every other Betacam camera system, and unlike the DigiBeta DVW-700, the camera could not play back in color without the use of an outboard adapter.

In 1991, the less-expensive, &quot;Professional&quot;, PV line of Betacam SP decks was introduced. The PV line consisted of only four models: the full-sized PVW-2600 (VTP), PVW-2650 (VTP with Dynamic tracking allowing up to fwd x3, whereas the BVW line only offered x2 DT playback) and PVW-2800 (VTR) editing decks, and the PVV-3 camera-dockable VTR. These high quality machines were similar to the original BV series machines, but lacked the third and fourth audio channels. In 1993, the far less expensive UVW series debuted. These machines were considerably simpler, somewhat lower quality, and were designed primarily to be used as companions to computer systems, for industrial video, and other low-cost, yet high-quality, uses. The UVW decks possessed very limited front panel controls, no jog and shuttle (except by use of a DSRM-10 cable remote control); and with time base corrector (TBC) control available only with an optional remote TBC controller. These were represented by the UVW-1800, a very popular editing VTR (and companion UVW-1600 edit VTP), and the non-editing UVW-1400 VTR, and UVW-1200 VTP. The UVW-100 (and later 100B) one-piece camcorder rounded out the UVW series.

====Third-party support====
Betacam and Betacam SP tape cassette shells varied in color depending on the manufacturer. Many companies sold Betacam tapes, sometimes of their own manufacture, sometimes re-branded. Fuji, Maxell, Ampex/Quantegy, BASF/EMTEC and 3M were just some of the major brands to do so.

Ampex, Thomson SA, BTS each sold OEM versions of some of the Sony VTRs and camcorders at various times in the 1980s and 1990s. Other than nameplates, these models were identical to the Sony models. Internal components still bore the Sony name.

=== Digital Betacam ===

Digital Betacam (commonly referred to as &quot;DigiBeta&quot;, &quot;D-Beta&quot;, &quot;DBC&quot; or simply &quot;Digi&quot;) was introduced at 18th International Television Symposium in Montreux on June 10, 1993. It supersedes both Betacam and Betacam SP, while costing significantly less than the first, 100% uncompressed D1 format, although in practice, they continued to coexist for practical and economical reasons. S tapes are available with up to 40 minutes running time, and L tapes with up to 124 minutes.

The Digital Betacam format records 2.34:1 DCT-compressed digital component video signal at 10-bit YUV 4:2:2 sampling in NTSC (720×486) or PAL (720×576) resolutions at a bitrate of 90 Mbit/s plus four channels of uncompressed 48 kHz / 20 bit PCM-encoded digital audio. A fifth analog audio track is available for cueing, and a linear timecode track is also used on the tape. It was a popular digital video cassette format for broadcast television use. It uses a head drum 81 mm in diameter that rotates at 5400 RPM for NTSC video. The video heads in the drum read helical tracks 24 microns wide. Audio is also recorded on the helical tracks. The compression algorithm used by Digital Betacam is proprietary.

Another key element which aided adoption was Sony&#x27;s implementation of the SDI coaxial digital connection on Digital Betacam decks. Facilities could begin using digital signals on their existing coaxial wiring without having to commit to an expensive re-installation.

=== Betacam SX ===

Betacam SX is a digital version of Betacam SP introduced in 1996, positioned as a cheaper alternative to Digital Betacam. It stores video using MPEG-2 4:2:2 Profile@ML compression, along with four channels of 48 kHz 16 bit PCM audio. All Betacam SX equipment is compatible with Betacam SP tapes. S tapes have a recording time up to 62 minutes, and L tapes up to 194 minutes.

The Betacam SX system was very successful with newsgathering operations, which had a legacy of Betacam and Betacam SP tapes. Some Betacam SX decks, such as the DNW-A75 or DNW-A50, can natively play and work from the analog tapes interchangeably, because they contain both analog and digital playback heads.

Betacam SX uses MPEG-2 4:2:2P@ML compression, compliant with CCIR 601, in comparison with other similar systems that use 4:1:1 or 4:2:0 chroma subsampling for coding. It gives better chroma resolution and allows certain postproduction processes such as Chroma-key.

This format compresses the video signal from approximately 180 Mbit/s to only 18 Mbit/s. This means a compression ratio of around 10:1, which is achieved by the use of mild temporal compression, where alternate frames are stored as MPEG I-frames and B-frames, giving rise to an IBIB sequence on tape. Due to the low bitrate this format was not standardized by any standards body.

Together with Betacam SX, Sony introduced a generation of hybrid recorder, allowing use of both tape and disk recording on the same deck, and high speed dubbing from one to another. This was intended to save wear on the video heads for television studio applications, as well to speed up online editing.

Betacam SX also features a &quot;good shot mark&quot; (a method for qualitative decisions made in the camcorder to be utilized during the editing process) feature that allows marking of each scene for fast scanning of the tape, looking at recorded marks on each single cassette, and showing the markers to the operator.

The cameras themselves are generally considered by most sound recordists to be quite noisy in operation, possibly because the amount of computer processing power, and subsequent generated heat leads to cooling fans being used to keep the camera at a reasonable temperature.

Betacam SX tape shells are bright yellow, but SX recordings may also be found recorded on analogue Betacam SP cassettes. Of course if such a Betacam SP tape with SX recording is inserted into a Betacam SP player, no picture or sound will appear.

The helical scan head drum is 81 mm in diameter. The video tracks read by the video heads in the drum, are 32 microns wide, the drum rotates at 5400 RPM for NTSC video. The video heads have a 15.25 degree azimuth. 

Although Betacam SX machines have gone out of production since 2008, the format is still used by many newsgathering operations, including Canada&#x27;s CTV, Atlanta&#x27;s WSB-TV, San Diego&#x27;s KFMB-TV and NBC&#x27;s operations in the San Francisco Bay Area at KNTV and KSTS. Many news archives still contain SX tapes. In August 2011, Betacam SX tapes were found in Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s underground studio in Tripoli. CNN reporter Sara Sidner commented on-air that CNN still used the same type of tapes.

=== MPEG IMX ===
MPEG IMX also known as D-10, is a 2000 development of the Digital Betacam format. Digital video compression uses H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 encoding at a higher bitrate than Betacam SX: 30 Mbit/s (6:1 compression), 40 Mbit/s (4:1 compression) or 50 Mbit/s (3.3:1 compression). Unlike most other MPEG-2 implementations, IMX uses intraframe compression. Additionally, IMX ensures that each frame has the same exact size in bytes to simplify recording onto video tape. Video recorded in the IMX format is compliant with CCIR 601 specification, with eight channels of audio and timecode track. It lacks an analog audio (cue) track as the Digital Betacam, but will read it as channel 7 if used for playback. This format has been standardized in SMPTE 365M and SMPTE 356M as &quot;MPEG D10 Streaming&quot;.

With its IMX VTRs, Sony introduced some new technologies including SDTI and e-VTR. SDTI allows for audio, video, timecode, and remote control functions to be transported by a single coaxial cable, while e-VTR technology extends this by allowing the same data to be transported over IP by way of an Ethernet interface on the VTR itself.

All IMX VTRs can natively playback Betacam SX tapes, and some, such as the MSW-M2000P/1 are capable of playing back Digital Betacam cassettes as well as analog Betacam and Betacam SP cassettes, but they can only record to their native IMX cassettes. S tapes are available with up to 60 minutes capacity, and L tapes hold up to 184 minutes. These values are for 525/60 decks, but will extend in 625/50. A 184-minute tape will record for, as the label itself specifies, 220 minutes.

IMX machines feature the same &quot;good shot mark&quot; function of the Betacam SX.

MPEG IMX cassettes are a muted green.

This format uses a helical scan head drum 80 mm in diameter. The video tracks read by the video heads in the drum, are 22 microns wide. The video heads have a 15.25 degree azimuth. 4:2:2 Chroma subsampling is used, and the drum rotates at 5400 RPM for NTSC video. Due to the use of an MPEG format, video is recorded with 8-bit samples (8-bit color).

The XDCAM format, unveiled in 2003, allows recording of MPEG IMX video in MXF container onto Professional Disc.

=== HDCAM/HDCAM SR ===
HDCAM, introduced in 1997, was the first HD format available in Betacam form-factor, using an 8-bit DCT compressed 3:1:1 recording, in 1080i-compatible downsampled resolution of 1440×1080, and adding 24p and 23.976 PsF modes to later models. The HDCAM codec uses non-square pixels and as such the recorded 1440×1080 content is upsampled to 1920×1080 on playback. The recorded video bitrate is 144 Mbit/s. There are four channels of AES/EBU 20-bit/48 kHz digital audio.

It was used for some of Sony&#x27;s cinema-targeted CineAlta range of products (newer CineAlta devices use flash storage).

HDCAM SR, introduced in 2003, uses a higher particle density tape and is capable of recording in 10 bits 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 RGB with a bitrate of 440 Mbit/s. The &quot;SR&quot; stands for &quot;Superior Resolution&quot;. The increased bitrate (over HDCAM) allows HDCAM SR to capture much more of the full bandwidth of the HD-SDI signal (1920×1080). Some HDCAM SR VTRs can also use a 2× mode with an even higher bitrate of 880 Mbit/s, allowing for a 4:4:4 RGB stream at a lower compression. HDCAM SR uses the new MPEG-4 Part 2 Studio Profile for compression, and expands the number of audio channels up to 12 at 48 kHz/24 bit.

HDCAM SR was used commonly for HDTV television production.

Some HDCAM VTRs play back older Betacam variants, for example, the Sony SRW-5500 HDCAM SR recorder, plays back and records HDCAM and HDCAM SR tapes and with optional hardware also plays and upconverts Digital Betacam tapes to HD format. Tape lengths are the same as for Digital Betacam, up to 40 minutes for S and 124 minutes for L tapes. In 24p mode the runtime increases to 50 and 155 minutes, respectively.

Sony branded HDCAM cassettes are black with an orange lid, and HDCAM SR cassettes black with a cyan lid.

440 Mbit/s mode is known as SQ, and 880 Mbit/s mode is known as HQ, and this mode has recently become available in studio models (e.g. SRW-5800) as well as portable models previously available.

<text>Miguel Barbachano y Tarrazo (29 September 1807 – 17 December 1859) (Baqueiro 1896) was a liberal Yucatecan politician, who was 5 times governor of Yucatán between 1841 and 1853.

Miguel Barbachano y Tarrazo was born in the city of Campeche, a son of Manuel Barbachano and his wife, the former Maria Josefa Tarrazo.

He was one of the staunchest advocates for the independence of Yucatán from Mexico, but historical circumstances led to Yucatán twice declaring its independence while Barbachano was out of power, and twice Barbachano arranged for Yucatán&#x27;s reunification with Mexico.

He generally alternated in power with the centrist Santiago Méndez, who was more in favor of union with Mexico but was driven to declare independence by the excesses of Mexican dictator Antonio López de Santa Anna.

The final reunification was due to the crisis of the Caste War of Yucatán.

==Terms as governor==
Miguel Barbachano&#x27;s terms as Governor of Yucatán were:

* 11 June 1841 to 13 October 1841
* 18 August 1842 to 14 November 1843 
* 15 May 1844 to 2 June 1844
* 1 January 1846 to 21 January 1847 
* 26 March 1848 to 13 February 1853

==Marriages==
He was married twice, first (in 1842) to Feliciana Camara and second (1851) to Maria del Pilar Quijano.

<text>was the pen-name of a journalist, political theorist and statesman in Meiji-period Japan. His real name was . His major contribution was the popularization of the egalitarian doctrines of the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau in Japan. As a result, Nakae is thought to have been a major force in the development of liberalism in early Japanese politics.

==Biography==
Nakae was born in Kōchi, Tosa Domain (present day Kōchi Prefecture). His father was an &quot;ashigaru&quot;, or lower ranking foot soldier in the service of the Yamauchi clan of Tosa. Having displayed an early aptitude for Western learning, after studies at the domain academy, Nakae was selected to study French and Dutch at Nagasaki and Edo. Later, he worked as a translator for the French minister to Japan, Léon Roches.

After the Meiji Restoration, he was selected as a member of the Iwakura Mission and travelled abroad (under the patronage of the Justice Ministry) to study philosophy, history, and French literature in France, where he lived from 1871 until 1874. While in France, Nakae translated some of the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau into Japanese (most importantly, Rousseau’s &quot;Du contrat social&quot;) and Eugène Véron&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;esthétique&quot;. He joined Saionji Kinmochi at Emile Acollas&#x27; Law School for foreign students in Paris.

Upon his return to Japan, Nakae served as a lower-ranked secretary of the Genrōin. However, he soon became disenchanted by corruption and factionalism in Japanese government, and resigned to devote himself to other literary and educational activities.

In 1874, he established his own French language school. In 1881, he helped to start the daily newspaper, , through which he propagated Western democratic ideas. The newspaper was soon suppressed by the authorities for propagation of republicanism and lese majesty. The newspaper reemerged as the milder the following year with Nakae as its chief editor. The newspaper continued to attack factionalism and corruption in government, and to agitate for revision of the unequal treaties and the rapid implementation of an elected national assembly. In 1887, Nakae was sentenced to exile from Tokyo under the for publishing critical articles about the Meiji oligarchy. He spent the next few years in Osaka, where he started the . Nakae was pardoned after the promulgation of the Meiji Constitution in 1889, and he and his family moved back to Tokyo in October of that year.

During the 1890 General Election, Nakae successfully ran for a seat in the lower house of the Diet of Japan from the Osaka 4th District. He allied with Itagaki’s &quot;Jiyūto&quot; political party, and its successor, the &quot;Rikken Jiyūtō&quot;, establishing a newspaper, &quot;Rikken Jiyūtō Shinbun&quot;, as the party’s official mouthpiece. However, Nakae soon became disenchanted with the domination of the &quot;Jiyūtō&quot; by members of the former Tosa clan, and its blind opposition to policies of the Chōshū-dominated government. He left government for health reasons and for alcoholism, and retired to Hokkaidō, where he again established a newspaper. He ran for office again in the 1892 General Election, and after re-election was a strong supporter of railroad development.

Nakae continued to write, despite poverty and illness, until his death of esophageal cancer in 1901. His grave is at Aoyama Cemetery, Tokyo.

<text>The northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) is one of three species of the genus &quot;Glaucomys&quot;, the only flying squirrels found in North America. They are found in coniferous and mixed coniferous forests across much of Canada, from Alaska to Nova Scotia, and south to the mountains of North Carolina and west to Utah in the United States. They are light brown with pale underparts and grow to a length of . They are proficient gliders but uncoordinated walkers on the ground. They feed on a variety of plant material as well as tree sap, fungi, insects, carrion, bird eggs and nestlings. They mostly breed once a year in a cavity lined with lichen or other soft material. Except when they have young, they change nests frequently, and in winter a number of individuals may huddle together in a shared nest. Unlike most members of their family, flying squirrels are strictly nocturnal.

==Subspecies==
Currently, 25 subspecies are recognized:

* &quot;G. s. sabrinus&quot;
* &quot;G. s. alpinus&quot;
* &quot;G. s. bangsi&quot;
* &quot;G. s. californcus&quot;
* &quot;G. s. canescens&quot;
* &quot;G. s. coloratus&quot;
* &quot;G. s. columbiensis&quot;
* &quot;G. s. flaviventris&quot;
* &quot;G. s. fuliginosus&quot;
* &quot;G. s. fuscus&quot;
* &quot;G. s. goodwini&quot;
* &quot;G. s. gouldi&quot;
* &quot;G. s. griseifrons&quot;
* &quot;G. s. klamathensis&quot;
* &quot;G. s. lascivus&quot;
* &quot;G. s. latipes&quot;
* &quot;G. s. lucifugus&quot;
* &quot;G. s. macrotis&quot;
* &quot;G. s. makkovikensis&quot;
* &quot;G. s. murinauralis&quot;
* &quot;G. s. reductus&quot;
* &quot;G. s. stephensi&quot;
* &quot;G. s. yukonensis&quot;
* &quot;G. s. zaphaeus&quot;
==Habitat and range==
The northern flying squirrel is found in coniferous and mixed coniferous forests across the top of North America, from Alaska to Nova Scotia, south to the mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee and west to Utah. The Humboldt&#x27;s flying squirrel was formerly considered conspecific, but was found to be a cryptic species, and now considered distinct. It is generally smaller and darker than northern flying squirrel and occurs in British Columbia, northern California, Washington and Oregon.

Two subspecies are found in the southern Appalachians, the Carolina northern flying squirrel, &quot;G. s. coloratus&quot;, and the West Virginia northern flying squirrel &quot;G. s. fuscus&quot;, both of which are endangered, although the West Virginia subspecies has recovered enough that it was delisted in August 2008.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service temporarily put the West Virginia northern flying squirrel back under protection on June 6, 2011, in response to a court order. On appeal, the delisting was reinstated in March 2013.

&quot;G. s. californicus&quot;, the San Bernardino flying squirrel, is found in the San Bernardino National Forest in California. In 2010, the Center for Biological Diversity petitioned the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to give the San Bernardino flying squirrel protections as an endangered species, but ultimately their request was denied. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said, &quot;in a thorough status review of the species using the best available science, the Service has found that the squirrel is abundant where it is found and that the threats to habitat loss from urban development, habitat fragmentation, wildfire, urban air pollution and climate change do not pose significant threats to its long-term survival.&quot;. The Center for Biological Diversity argues that temperature changes are reducing the San Bernardino flying squirrel&#x27;s forest habitat and negatively affecting the availability of the truffles it feeds on, with urban development impacting the area as well.

==Description==
These nocturnal, arboreal rodents have thick light brown or cinnamon fur on their upper body and greyish fur on the flanks and whitish fur underneath. They have large eyes and a flat tail. They can also be identified by their long whiskers, common to nocturnal mammals. The adult northern flying squirrel measures from 25 to 37 cm long, and their weight can range from 110 to 230 grams.

==Gliding==
Flying squirrels do not actually fly, they glide using a patagium created by a fold of skin. From atop trees, flying squirrels can initiate glides from a running start or from a stationary position by bringing their limbs under the body, retracting their heads, and then propelling themselves off the tree. It is believed that they use triangulation to estimate the distance of the landing as they often lean out and pivot from side to side before jumping. Once in the air, they form an &quot;X&quot; with their limbs, causing their membrane to stretch into a square-like shape and glide down at angles of 30 to 40 degrees. They maneuver with great efficiency in the air, making 90 degree turns around obstacles if needed. Just before reaching a tree, they raise their flattened tails, which abruptly changes their trajectory upwards, and point all of their limbs forward to create a parachute effect with the membrane to reduce the shock of landing. The limbs absorb the remainder of the impact, and the squirrels immediately run to the other side of the trunk or to the top of the tree to avoid any potential predators. Although graceful in flight, they are very clumsy walkers and if they happen to be on the ground in the presence of danger, they will prefer to hide rather than attempt to escape.

==Diet==
A major food source for the squirrels are fungi of various species, although they also eat lichens, all mast-crop nuts, tree sap, insects, carrion, bird eggs and nestlings, buds and flowers. The squirrels are able to locate truffles by olfaction, though they also seem to use cues such as the presence of coarse woody debris, indicating a decaying log, and spatial memory of locations where truffles were found in the past.

The northern flying squirrel is also known to cache food for when food supplies are lower. These caches can be in cavities in trees, as well as in the squirrels&#x27; nest. Lichens and seeds are commonly cached.

==Behaviour==

Northern flying squirrels generally nest in holes in trees, preferring large-diameter trunks and dead trees, and will also build outside leaf nests called dreys and will also nest underground. Tree cavities created by woodpeckers as suitable nest sites tend to be more abundant in old-growth forests, and so do the squirrels, though harvested forests can be managed in ways that are likely to increase squirrel numbers. Nests may also be established in buildings, including parts of occupied homes. Except when rearing young, the squirrels shift from nest to nest frequently. They often share nests during winter months, forming aggregations. Usually, aggregate nests contain 4 to 10 individuals. The sharing of nests in winter by northern flying squirrels is important in maintaining body temperature (biothermal regulation), as northern flying squirrels do not hibernate, nor do they enter torpor states.

Northern flying squirrels gliding distances tend to be between 5 and 25 metres, though glides of up to 45 m and longer have been observed. Average glides are about 5 m less for females than for males. Glide angle has been measured at 26.8 degrees and glide ratio at 1.98.

Since first documented by Shaw in 1801, the general understanding was that northern flying squirrels bred but once per year. Recently, in southern Ontario, Canada, polyestrous behaviour (two litters per year) has been documented for the first time. This observation has since been confirmed by a second research team in New Brunswick, Canada.

In southern Ontario, Canada, genetic evidence has recently shown hybridization with the rapid northward expansion and increased sympatry of southern flying squirrels.

==Predation==
Northern flying squirrels, along with pine squirrels, are a primary prey species for the spotted owl (&quot;Strix occidentalis&quot;) and eastern screech owl (&quot;Megascops asio&quot;). Other predators include various other large birds, especially the great horned owl and hawks, as well as mammals including American martens, Canadian lynxes, and red foxes.

<text>Santiago Méndez Ibarra (1798 – 1872) was governor of Yucatán, Mexico 3 times from 1840 to 1857: 1840–44; 1847–48; 1855–57, alternating that office with Miguel Barbachano mainly during his first and second terms. Méndez was a moderate who advocated a strict conservative financial policy for the government. He was noted for his honesty, and gained no personal fortune from his years in governmental power. Santiago Méndez was more in favor of union with Mexico than Barbachano, but twice presided over Yucatán declaring its independence, due to frustration with Mexican dictator Antonio López de Santa Anna.

Santiago Méndez was father of Concepción Méndez Echazarreta and grandfather of Justo Sierra Méndez. Justo Sierra O&#x27;Reilly, his son-in-law collaborated with him in policy.

<doc id="355672" wikidata="Q944409" url="?curid=355672" title="Stanley G. Weinbaum">
<text>Stanley Grauman Weinbaum (April 4, 1902 – December 14, 1935) was an American science fiction writer. His first story, &quot;A Martian Odyssey&quot;, was published to great acclaim in July 1934; the alien Tweel was arguably the first character to satisfy John W. Campbell&#x27;s challenge: &quot;Write me a creature who thinks &quot;as well as&quot; a man, or better than a man, but not &quot;like&quot; a man.&quot; Weinbaum wrote more short stories and a few novels, but died from lung cancer less than a year and a half later.

==Life and career==
Weinbaum was born in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of Stella (née Grauman) and Nathan A. Weinbaum. His family was Jewish. 

He attended Riverside High School in Milwaukee. He was granted admission to the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Madison in July 1920. He first majored in chemical engineering, then switched to English, but contrary to common belief he did not graduate. On a bet, Weinbaum took an exam for a friend, and was later discovered; he left the university in 1923.

Weinbaum is best known for his groundbreaking science fiction short story &quot;A Martian Odyssey&quot;, which presents a sympathetic but decidedly non-human alien, Tweel. This was his first science fiction story: in 1933 he had sold a romantic novel, &quot;The Lady Dances&quot;, to King Features Syndicate, which serialized the story in its newspapers in early 1934. Isaac Asimov described &quot;A Martian Odyssey&quot; as &quot;a perfect Campbellian science fiction story, before John W. Campbell. Indeed, Tweel may be the first creature in science fiction to fulfil Campbell&#x27;s dictum, &#x27;write me a creature who thinks &quot;as well as&quot; a man, or &quot;better than&quot; a man, but not &quot;like&quot; a man&#x27;.&quot; Asimov went on to describe it as one of only three stories that changed the way all subsequent stories in the science fiction genre have been written. It was the oldest short story and one of the top vote-getters selected by the Science Fiction Writers of America for inclusion in &quot;The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929–1964&quot;.

Most of the work that was published in Weinbaum&#x27;s lifetime appeared in either &quot;Astounding&quot; or &quot;Wonder Stories&quot;. However, several of his pieces first appeared in the early science fiction fanzine &quot;Fantasy Magazine&quot; (successor to &quot;Science Fiction Digest&quot;) in the 1930s, including an &quot;Auto-Biographical Sketch&quot; in the June 1935 issue. Despite common belief, Weinbaum was not one of the contributors to the multi-authored &quot;Cosmos&quot; serial in &quot;Science Fiction Digest/Fantasy Magazine.&quot; He did contribute to the multi-author story &quot;The Challenge From Beyond&quot;, published in the September 1935 &quot;Fantasy Magazine&quot;. 

At the time of his death, Weinbaum was writing a novel, &quot;Three Who Danced&quot;. In this novel, the Prince of Wales is unexpectedly present at a dance in an obscure American community, where he dances with three of the local girls, choosing each for a different reason. Each girl&#x27;s life is changed, happily or tragically, as a result of the unexpected attention she has received. 

In 1993, Weinbaum&#x27;s widow, Margaret Hawtof Kay, donated his papers to the Temple University Library in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Included were several unpublished manuscripts, among them &quot;Three Who Danced&quot;, as well as other unpublished stories. These are mostly romance stories, but there are also a few other non-fiction and fiction writings, none of them science fiction.

A film version of Weinbaum&#x27;s short story &quot;The Adaptive Ultimate&quot; was released in 1957 under the title &quot;She Devil&quot;, starring Mari Blanchard, Jack Kelly, and Albert Dekker. The story was also dramatized for television as an episode of &quot;Studio One&quot; titled &quot;Kyra Zelas&quot; (the name of the title character), broadcast on September 12, 1949. A radio dramatization of &quot;The Adaptive Ultimate&quot; was performed on the anthology show &quot;Escape&quot; in the 1950s.

==Honors and awards==
A crater on Mars is named in Weinbaum&#x27;s honor. On July 18, 2008, he won the Cordwainer Smith Rediscovery Award.

==Critical reception==
Lester del Rey declared that &quot;Weinbaum, more than any other writer, helped to take our field out of the doldrums of the early thirties and into the beginnings of modern science fiction.&quot; H. P. Lovecraft stated that Weinbaum&#x27;s writing was ingenious, and that he stood miles above the other pulp fiction writers in his creation of genuinely alien worlds, in contrast to Edgar Rice Burroughs and his &quot;inane&quot; stories of &quot;egg-laying Princesses&quot;. Frederik Pohl wrote that before Weinbaum, science fiction&#x27;s aliens &quot;might be catmen, lizard-men, antmen, plantmen or rockmen; but they were, always and incurably, &quot;men&quot;. Weinbaum changed that. ... it was the difference in orientation – in drives, goals and thought processes – that made the Weinbaum-type alien so fresh and rewarding in science fiction in the mid-thirties.&quot; According to Pohl, that Weinbaum&#x27;s &quot;revolutionary idea&quot; was to &quot;give some sort of three-dimensional reality to the characters&quot;, in contrast to Hugo Gernsback&#x27;s &quot;animated catalogue of gadgets&quot;. Isaac Asimov wrote, &quot;Weinbaum... had he lived, would surely be in first place in the list of all-time-favorite science fiction writers.&quot; 

Everett F. Bleiler, however, wrote that, although Weinbaum &quot;was generally considered the most promising new s-f author of his day,&quot; his reputation is overstated. While &quot;Weinbaum&#x27;s style was more lively than that of his genre contemporaries, and he was imaginative in background details, ... his work was ordinary pulp fiction, with routine plots, slapdash presentation, cardboard characterization, and much cliche of ideas.&quot; Alexei and Cory Panshin concluded that &quot;Time has swallowed what were once Weinbaum&#x27;s particular virtues. What is left seems quaint and quirky.&quot;

==Planetary series==
All of Weinbaum&#x27;s nine interplanetary stories are set in a consistent solar system that was scientifically accurate by the standards of his time. The deceptively avian-looking, botanical Martians of &quot;A Martian Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Valley of Dreams&quot;, for instance, are mentioned in &quot;Redemption Cairn&quot; and &quot;The Red Peri&quot;; the quadrupedal Venusian trioptes of &quot;Parasite Planet&quot; and &quot;The Lotus Eaters&quot; are mentioned in &quot;The Mad Moon&quot;; the vicious, pseudomammalian pests of The Mad Moon appear in &quot;Valley of Dreams&quot; as minor antagonists; and the rock-eating Pyramid-Makers of Mars are mentioned in &quot;Tidal Moon&quot;. In Weinbaum&#x27;s solar system, in accordance with the then-current near-collision hypothesis, the gas giants radiate heat, enough to warm their satellites to Earthlike temperatures, allowing for Earthlike environments on Io, Europa, Titan, and even Uranus. Mars is also sufficiently Earthlike to allow humans to walk on its surface unprotected following training in thin-air chambers.

==Van Manderpootz stories==
Three of Weinbaum&#x27;s short stories deal with Dixon Wells, a perpetually late playboy who runs afoul of the inventions of his friend and former instructor in &quot;Newer Physics&quot;, Professor Haskel van Manderpootz, a supremely immodest genius who rates Albert Einstein as his equal or slight inferior. In &quot;The Worlds of If&quot;, Wells tests an invention that reveals what might have been; in &quot;The Ideal&quot;, the professor creates a device that can show the image of a person&#x27;s ideal (in Wells&#x27; case, his perfect woman); the contrivance of &quot;The Point of View&quot; allows one to see the world from another&#x27;s perspective. In all three, Wells finds and then loses the woman of his dreams.

<text>James Patrick Anderton (born Byrne; 21 January 1938 – 7 January 2018) was a New Zealand politician who led a succession of left-wing parties after leaving the Labour Party in 1989.

Anderton&#x27;s political career began when he was elected to the Manukau City Council in 1965. After serving for five years as Labour Party president, Anderton successfully stood as the Labour candidate for Sydenham in Christchurch in . However, he soon came into conflict with the party&#x27;s leadership, and became an outspoken critic of the Fourth Labour Government&#x27;s free-market reforms, called Rogernomics. In April 1989, believing that Labour was beyond change, Anderton resigned from the party.

As leader of the Alliance and later the Progressive Party, he served as the 15th deputy prime minister of New Zealand in the Fifth Labour Government from 1999 to 2002 and as a senior minister in that government from 2002 to 2008. In 2010, he ran unsuccessfully for the mayoralty of Christchurch. Anderton retired from Parliament at the . After his retirement, he and former MP Philip Burdon were the two prominent campaigners for the restoration of ChristChurch Cathedral.

== Early life ==
Jim Anderton was born on 21 January 1938 in Auckland to Matthew Byrne and Joyce Savage. His father left the family and his mother married Victor Anderton. Matthew Byrne died in a train accident in 1946 and Victor Anderton adopted Jim in 1951. Jim undertook all his education in Auckland, attending Seddon Memorial Technical College and the Auckland Teachers&#x27; Training College. He graduated as a qualified teacher, but spent only two years in a teaching role (at St Peter&#x27;s College, Auckland) before moving on to work as a child welfare officer in Wanganui.

In 1960, he married Joan Caulfield and they had five children, two girls and three boys. The same year he became the paid organiser for the Catholic Youth Movement in the Catholic Diocese of Auckland, and later worked as the secretary for the Catholic diocese in Auckland. Cardinal Reginald Delargey said that there were difficulties with Jim Anderton and his employment ended &quot;when he put us in a position where we had to make a choice between him or the Pope&quot;.

Anderton later moved into business, working as an export manager for a textiles company before establishing a manufacturing company, Anderton Holdings, with his brother Brian in 1971 and also bought a superette in Parnell.

==Entering politics==
Anderton joined the Labour Party in 1963 and first attended a Labour party branch meeting in Mangere in 1964. His political career began in 1965 when he was elected to the Manukau City Council on a Labour ticket. In 1971, he stood for the Auckland City Council as a Labour candidate unsuccessfully and was the highest polling un-elected Labour candidate.

Three years later, in 1974, he challenged Dove-Myer Robinson, the incumbent Mayor of Auckland City, for the mayoralty, but was beaten by 7,000 votes. In the same local election, he also stood for the Auckland City Council and was successful. David Lange, who also ran on the Labour ticket as a city councillor said &quot;Like the other candidates, I contributed $50 to pay for an advertisement in the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; in support of the Labour ticket. When I opened the paper to look at our advertisement I saw a photograph of Jim Anderton and no mention of the other candidates. Here was a warning of much to come&quot;.

Anderton had another tilt at the Auckland City mayoralty in 1977, but was again beaten by the incumbent though he did manage to reduce Robinson&#x27;s majority by nearly 1,500 votes. Earlier in 1977 he was elected to the Auckland Regional Authority via a by-election and was confirmed a member at the 1977 local elections later that year despite again losing the mayoralty. At the same time, he worked his way up the internal hierarchy of the Labour Party. He became the party&#x27;s president in 1979, a year before his term with the Auckland Regional Authority ended. He was also a long-standing member of the party&#x27;s policy council.

Following the sudden death of Frank Rogers in 1980 there was intense press speculation that Anderton (who was the proprietor of a business situated in the electorate) would stand to replace him in the Onehunga by-election. Despite briefly considering standing, he eventually declined the nomination, refusing to renege on the promise he made to members at the 1979 party conference that he would not stand for a parliamentary seat at, or before, the election. Soon afterwards Anderton was also rumoured to be contemplating replacing the retiring Arthur Faulkner in the electorate, but after a hostile reaction to the notion in caucus Anderton was dissuaded from seeking the Roskill nomination. In the attempted leadership coup against Labour leader Bill Rowling in 1980 by his deputy, David Lange, Anderton was among those (such as party secretary John Wybrow) who sided with Rowling.

Following Labour&#x27;s election loss there were serious discussions regarding the future of affiliated trade unions in the Labour Party. Labour was frequently attacked for being the &#x27;party of unions&#x27; (particularly by Muldoon) despite only 15% of unions being affiliated and providing just 8% of the annual party funds. In February 1982 Rowling gave a speech at a Labour regional conference in Timaru where he suggested Labour should cut formal ties with trade unions, citing the party&#x27;s public perception being too closely linked with unions and that there had been a large demographic shift in the membership from the working class to middle-class liberals. Rowling was supported by his Shadow Minister for Labour, Fred Gerbic, and several leading union figures such as national secretary of the New Zealand Electrical and Related Trades Union Tony Neary and secretary of the Wellington Clothing Workers Union Frank Thorn who stated their belief that their affiliation fees were too high and offered little benefit in return. Anderton and other unionists such as Jim Knox, the secretary of the New Zealand Federation of Labour, were opposed and argued for a continuing union presence in the party. By March the debate heated up with Rowling and Gerbic publicly expressing another concern that some affiliated unions had members of other parties, in particular the Socialist Unity Party (SUP). Anderton publicly disagreed with Rowling stating that the SUP had no influence in the Labour Party and that &quot;The entire membership of the SUP could be written on the back of a postage stamp.&quot; At Labour&#x27;s annual conference in May 1982 the conference delegates rejected Rowling&#x27;s proposal and union affiliation remained to Anderton&#x27;s relief. At the conference Gerbic used most of his speaking time to attack Anderton for publicly disagreeing with him over the SUP. Anderton was more bemused than angered and Gerbic&#x27;s speech finished with a more booing than applause. As a result of this failure maverick Labour MP Roger Douglas publicly questioned Rowling&#x27;s leadership qualities and his lack of direction. While Rowling did not respond, Anderton staunchly defended Rowling from Douglas&#x27; criticism.

Anderton got involved in the public discourse over the Mount Erebus disaster where an Air New Zealand plane crashed in Antarctica on 28 November 1979. He was publicly critical of the backlash that Justice Peter Mahon QC, who presided over the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the crash, received after the commission concluded that the primarily cause of the accident was an alteration of the flight path coordinates the night before the disaster while not informing the pilots of the change. The report contradicted an earlier investigation which concluded the accident was caused primarily by pilot error to which Mahon charged as &quot;an orchestrated litany of lies&quot; to cover up the real cause. Anderton particularly defended Mahon after a particularly attack on both him and his report by Prime Minister Robert Muldoon. After commenting publicly on the matter Bob Owens, the chairman of Air New Zealand, invited Anderton to a meeting with himself and chief executive John Wisdom. The meeting got heated with Anderton being confrontational in tone (particularly after Owens admitted to having not read Mahon&#x27;s report in full and did not intend to) and lasted only 8 minutes. It climaxed with Owens calling his security to escort Anderton from the office. Air New Zealand subsequently released a press statement criticising Anderton. Rowling later apologised to Owens for the incident. 

Many in the Labour Party (who were already critical of Anderton) used the Air New Zealand incident to attempt to remove him as president. A group of MPs (Michael Bassett, Roger Douglas, Mike Moore and Richard Prebble) organised a challenge for the presidency at the 1982 party conference. They approached former MP and party vice-president Joe Walding to stand, though he declined. Instead Bassett, the most acerbic critic of Anderton in the group, declared he would stand for the presidency of the party. An open conflict drew the ire of many in the party and eventually Bassett withdrew his candidacy. He was subsequently dumped from the shadow cabinet in February 1982 as a result. At the conference Anderton was challenged by Allan O&#x27;Neill, president of the Auckland Carpenters Union, but won easily 1,120 votes to 126.

==Member of Parliament==





In 1983 he was selected as the Labour candidate for the Christchurch seat of against 6 local contenders. The outgoing MP for Sydenham John Kirk declared that he did not support Anderton as the official Labour candidate and saw Anderton&#x27;s selection a sign that Labour was moving too far to the left. In the 1984 general election, Anderton was elected as MP for Sydenham. This election resulted in the formation of the Fourth Labour Government. Some on the left of the party, including Helen Clark, tried to persuade Anderton to remain president of the party, however he declined to stand again at the 1984 conference believing the president should not also be an MP. Anderton was appointed chairperson of Labour&#x27;s caucus sub-committee on industrial relations. Prime Minister David Lange sacked Anderton from the role on 3 August 1986 and replaced him with Fran Wilde ostensibly for a poor meeting attendance record, but more likely due to curb Anderton&#x27;s ability to criticise labour market restructuring. After it was revealed he in fact had the second-highest attendance record, Anderton received a caucus-level apology.

Anderton soon came into conflict with the party&#x27;s leadership, and became one of the most outspoken critics of Minister of Finance Roger Douglas. Douglas and his allies, Richard Prebble and David Caygill, were determined to implement radical reforms of the country&#x27;s economic system, known unofficially as &quot;Rogernomics&quot;. This involved a monetarist approach to controlling inflation, the removal of tariffs and subsidies, and the privatisation of state assets, all of which were regarded by Anderton as a betrayal of the party&#x27;s left-wing roots, and an abandonment of the party&#x27;s election platform.

Anderton&#x27;s severe criticism of Douglas and his reforms earned him the enmity of many within the party, including some of those who otherwise shared Anderton&#x27;s frustration; his public comments were seen as damaging the party&#x27;s public image. He released a policy document on 27 July 1988 which was described by Jim Sutton as &quot;looking like a Soviet prescription for a Polish shipyard&quot;. This caused much laughter in the Labour caucus. His stance of vocally and publicly opposing Labour&#x27;s neoliberal direction led him to eschew the prospect of becoming a cabinet minister in the Lange ministry. At the 1988 Labour Party conference in Dunedin, Anderton announced his intention to stand for the party presidency once again. In a highly publicised and bitterly contested campaign, he lost to vice-president Ruth Dyson 473 votes to 575. Optics from the divided conference were damaging to Labour&#x27;s image showing a clear left/right divide with the left backing Anderton and the right coalescing around Dyson.

== 1989 split from Labour ==

Although many ordinary members of the Labour Party (who were unhappy at the way the party&#x27;s parliamentary wing was behaving) backed Anderton, he became increasingly isolated in parliament. When Anderton disobeyed party instructions to vote in favour of selling the Bank of New Zealand (which Labour had explicitly promised not to do), he was suspended from caucus. In April 1989, believing that Labour was beyond change, Anderton resigned from the party. He later said, &quot;I did not leave the Labour Party; the Labour Party left me.&quot; All but one of Anderton&#x27;s electorate staff in Sydenham left with him. Fellow MP and then-cabinet minister Michael Bassett commented &quot;while Anderton liked to portray his differences as ideological, we knew from past experience that his real problem was that he wasn&#x27;t the one in control of the government, and he could see no way of seizing power&quot;.

On 1 May, Anderton announced the creation of the NewLabour Party, intended to represent the real spirit of the original Labour Party. Its primary goals were state intervention in the economy, retention of public assets, and full employment. In the 1990 general election Anderton retained his Sydenham seat, ensuring that NewLabour (and Anderton&#x27;s criticism) would not fade away. A long-serving office manager and campaign director, Jeanette Lawrence, said Anderton retaining his seat at the 1990 general election was the &quot;happiest she ever saw him&quot;. He was the first MP in New Zealand political history to leave an established party, found another and be re-elected to Parliament representing that new party. In parliament, Anderton attacked the policies of the new National Party government, particularly Ruth Richardson&#x27;s continuation of Rogernomics (Ruthanasia).

In regard to leaving Labour in 1989, he later recalled: &quot;I have no regrets about any of that. Under the same circumstances I would do exactly the same again.&quot; Anderton was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal.

== Alliance ==

Anderton and NewLabour were at the centre of the Alliance Party established in 1991. He became leader of the new party and in the 1993 election, was joined in parliament by Alliance colleague Sandra Lee. Jim Bolger spoke to him after the 1993 election where Anderton was &quot;courteous and sensible and spoke about co-operating, but made it clear he would never enter into a coalition with a National-led government&quot;. He briefly stepped down as leader of the Alliance in November 1994 following the suicide of his daughter the year before, but returned in May 1995.

In the 1996 election, the first to be held under the mixed-member proportional (MMP) system, the Alliance won 13 seats in Parliament. Anderton retained his constituency seat, now renamed Wigram, and he was joined in Parliament by 12 list MPs.

Anderton was the most prominent critic of the rash of party-switching (sometimes called &quot;waka jumping&quot; in New Zealand) that characterised the 45th Parliament, although remained silent about his own past party-switching. When Alliance list MP Alamein Kopu declared herself an independent and supported the National-led coalition, Anderton blasted her, saying her behaviour &quot;breached every standard of ethics that are known.&quot;

After the collapse of the National-New Zealand First coalition Anderton started a &quot;Go Now&quot; petition on 27 August 1998 calling on the government to resign and hold an election. Former prime minister Jim Bolger resigned from parliament triggering the 1998 Taranaki-King Country by-election. The Alliance performed surprisingly well. Campaigning on opposition to the proposed Multilateral Agreement on Investment, they won 15% of the vote in a traditionally conservative electorate and finishing just two points behind Labour. Following the by-election the Alliance and Labour began co-operating, informally to begin with, in recognition that it would be the only way to win power. Anderton, his chief advisor Andrew Ladley and Lee met with Labour leader Helen Clark, deputy Michael Cullen, secretary Tony Timms and Clark&#x27;s advisor Heather Simpson to agree on forming a coalition with one another if they each won enough seats at the next election. Ladley and Simpson drew up briefs on what a Labour-Alliance government would look like and how it would work.

== Fifth Labour Government ==

By the late 1990s, Labour under Clark&#x27;s leadership had largely purged itself of the influence of Roger Douglas. Realising that the cost of a split in the left-wing vote would be a continuance of the National government, Labour and the Alliance agreed to form a coalition after the 1999 election. National lost the election and Anderton became Deputy Prime Minister. He was also given the newly created post of Minister of Economic Development, which had an emphasis on job creation and regional development initiatives. Anderton also co-authored the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, a sovereign wealth fund to partially pre-fund the future cost of universal superannuation, with Finance Minister Michael Cullen and promoted the first waka-jumping legislation—the Electoral Integrity Act 2001. Anderton, along with fellow Alliance MP Laila Harré, was also an invaluable advocate in the creation and implementation for 12 weeks paid parental leave.

The successful establishment of Kiwibank, a state-owned bank, is often cited as Anderton&#x27;s greatest achievement. It was initially opposed by both Clark and Cullen but Anderton eventually wore the Labour Cabinet down following several months of debate culminating with Annette King telling Cullen, &quot;For God&#x27;s sake, give him the bloody bank&quot;.

Towards the end of the Alliance&#x27;s first term in Government, Anderton came into conflict with the Alliance&#x27;s administrative wing. Party president Matt McCarten and his allies claimed that the Alliance had become too close to Labour and that it should take a less moderate path; Anderton replied that some moderation was required for the Alliance to accomplish any of its goals. There were complaints that Anderton was too dominant in the party&#x27;s decision-making and over the fact that he supported the government&#x27;s stance on the bombing of Afghanistan, while the executive and wider membership opposed it. Eventually, Anderton and three other MPs left the Alliance, establishing the Progressive Coalition, later renamed the Progressive Party. In order to get around the waka-jumping legislation which Anderton had supported, he technically remained the Alliance&#x27;s parliamentary leader until the writ was dropped for the 2002 election.

In the election, Anderton was returned to Parliament, and the Progressives took the Alliance&#x27;s place as Labour&#x27;s coalition partner. Although Anderton won his electorate, the small amount of support the Progressives received (1.4% of the party vote) was enough for only one other Progressive (deputy leader Matt Robson) to enter Parliament. Anderton gave up the deputy prime minister&#x27;s post to Minister of Finance and Labour deputy leader Michael Cullen. He remained Minister of Economic Development, and also held other ministerial portfolios. He ranked third in Cabinet, behind Clark and Cullen.

In the runup to the 2005 election Anderton renamed his party &quot;Jim Anderton&#x27;s Progressive Party&quot;. However, he was the only Progressive who returned to Parliament by a narrow margin after many left-wing voters voted for Labour to prevent a National government from being elected due to a split on the left. He became Minister of Agriculture, Minister for Biosecurity, Minister of Fisheries, Minister of Forestry, Minister Responsible for the Public Trust, Associate Minister of Health, and Associate Minister for Tertiary Education.

The 2008 election saw a swing to the right, with National winning approximately 45% of the party vote to Labour&#x27;s 34%. Anderton retained his seat but the Progressives&#x27; share of the party vote remained low, at less than one percent. In a move described as &quot;unorthodox&quot; by the New Zealand Herald, Anderton announced that he would remain in coalition with Labour in opposition. He said that a priority for the Progressives would be to support better access to dental care.

==Christchurch mayoral candidacy==

Anderton announced in May 2010 that he would contest the Christchurch mayoralty that October. He initially said that if elected to the mayoralty he would not give up his seat in Parliament because he didn&#x27;t want to cause an expensive by-election. However, following the 2010 Canterbury earthquake Anderton announced he would stand down as MP for Wigram if elected mayor so he could fully focus on rebuilding the city. Anderton was leading the polls until the earthquake hit. He lost the election, taking 40.6% of the vote to incumbent mayor Bob Parker&#x27;s 53.7% of the vote, with the rest of the vote split amongst numerous minor candidates.

==Retirement==

Anderton retired from Parliament at the 2011 election. The Progressive Party did not run candidates in that election. At the time, he held the unofficial title of Father of the House as the longest continuously serving MP. During the election campaign, Anderton endorsed Labour candidate and previously unsuccessful mayoral candidate Megan Woods to succeed him in his electorate. Woods was elected. After his retirement, he put his energy into a campaign to have ChristChurch Cathedral restored after it had been severely damaged in the February and June 2011 Christchurch earthquakes; he worked on this campaign with former National MP Philip Burdon. Christopher Finlayson spoke of a meeting he and Gerry Brownlee had with Jim Anderton and Philip Burdon about restoring the cathedral. Anderton &quot;said that he had a couple of points he wanted to make. Forty minutes later, the monologue was continuing and I endeavored to ask a couple of questions. He effectively told me to shut up as he still had more to say. His was a somewhat bullying performance. I felt that if he had shown some more courtesy and understanding to the bishop, there may have been a more positive outcome&quot;. They were ultimately successful in September 2017 when the Anglican synod made a binding decision to restore the church. 

He was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2017 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, for services as a Member of Parliament. On 3 September 2017, he had a special investiture ceremony at Nazareth House attended by the Governor-General (Dame Patsy Reddy), the Mayor of Christchurch (Lianne Dalziel), and former Prime Minister Helen Clark.

==Death==
Anderton died in Christchurch on 7 January 2018, at age 79. His funeral at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Christchurch was attended by hundreds, including the Prime Minister. Anderton was buried at Onetangi Cemetery on Waiheke Island.

Figures from across the political spectrum praised Anderton following his death, and the leaders of New Zealand&#x27;s parliamentary parties paid tributes.

<text>The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle is an order of chivalry associated with Scotland. The current version of the order was founded in 1687 by King James VII of Scotland, who asserted that he was reviving an earlier order. The order consists of the sovereign and sixteen knights and ladies, as well as certain &quot;&quot; knights (members of the British royal family and foreign monarchs). The sovereign alone grants membership of the order; they are not advised by the government, as occurs with most other orders.
The order&#x27;s primary emblem is the thistle, the national flower of Scotland. The motto is (Latin for &quot;No one provokes me with impunity&quot;). The same motto appears on the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom for use in Scotland and pound coins minted in 1984, 1989, 1994, and 1999 (since withdrawn), and is also the motto of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, the Scots Guards, the Royal Regiment of Scotland, and the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada. The patron saint of the order is St Andrew.

Most British orders of chivalry cover the whole United Kingdom, but the three most exalted ones each pertain to one constituent country only. The Order of the Thistle, which pertains to Scotland, is the second most senior in precedence. Its equivalent in England, the Most Noble Order of the Garter, is the oldest documented order of chivalry in the United Kingdom, dating to the middle fourteenth century. In 1783 an Irish equivalent, the Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick, was founded, but it is now dormant.

== History ==

The claim that James VII was reviving an earlier order is generally not supported by the evidence. The 1687 warrant states that during a battle in 786 with Angles under Æthelstan of East Anglia, the cross of St Andrew appeared in the sky to Achaius, King of Scots; after his victory, he established the Order of the Thistle and dedicated it to the saint. This seems unlikely on the face of it, since Achaius died a century before Æthelstan (though it is now thought that the opponents in this battle were not the East Anglian king Æthelstan (born around 894) but an earlier Northumbrian of the same name, and not the legendary Scottish King Achaius but the historical Pictish King Óengus II).

An alternative version is that the order was founded in 809 to commemorate an alliance between Achaius and Emperor Charlemagne; there is some plausibility to this, insofar as Charlemagne is believed to have employed Scottish bodyguards. Yet another version is that Robert the Bruce instituted the order after his victory at Bannockburn in 1314.

Most historians consider the earliest credible claim to be the founding of the order by James III, during the fifteenth century. He adopted the thistle as the royal badge, issued coins depicting thistles and allegedly conferred membership of the &quot;Order of the Burr or Thissil&quot; on Francis I of France, although there is no conclusive evidence for this.
Some Scottish order of chivalry may have existed during the sixteenth century, possibly founded by James V and called the Order of St. Andrew, but lapsed by the end of that century, although the evidence is unclear. A royal thistle collar is depicted in a book of hours, prepared for James IV in about 1503, where he is shown kneeling at an altar bearing the royal arms encircled by a collar of thistles and a badge depicting St Andrew. In a painting of 1538, James V is shown wearing a gold collar of linked thistles with a St Andrew badge, although the King&#x27;s wardrobe inventories of the period make no mention of a thistle collar.

In 1558, a French commentator described the use of the crowned thistle and St Andrew&#x27;s cross on Scottish coins and banners but noted there was no Scottish order of knighthood. Writing around 1578, John Lesley refers to the three foreign orders of chivalry carved on the gate of Linlithgow Palace, with James V&#x27;s &quot;ornaments&quot; of St Andrew, &quot;proper to this nation&quot;. In 1610 William Fowler, the Scottish secretary to Anne of Denmark was asked about the Order of the Thistle. Fowler believed that there had been an order, founded to honour Scots who fought for Charles VII of France, but it had been discontinued in the time of James V, and could say nothing of its ceremonies or regalia.

James VII issued letters patent &quot;reviving and restoring the Order of the Thistle to its full glory, lustre and magnificency&quot; on 29 May 1687. His intention was to reward Scottish Catholics for their loyalty, but the initiative actually came from John, 1st Earl and 1st Jacobite Duke of Melfort, then Secretary of State for Scotland. Only eight members out of a possible twelve were appointed; these included Catholics, such as Melfort and the Lord Chancellor of Scotland, his elder brother James, 4th Earl and 1st Jacobite Duke of Perth, plus Protestant supporters like the Earl of Arran.
After James was deposed by the 1688 Glorious Revolution no further appointments were made, although the exiled House of Stuart continued to issue a Jacobite version until 1784 (the last appointment being Charlotte Stuart, Jacobite Duchess of Albany), although none of those were recognised by the British Crown. Queen Anne appointed knights to the Order from 1704, and it has remained in existence since then, and is used to recognise Scots &#x27;who have held public office or contributed significantly to national life.&#x27;

== Composition ==

The Kings of Scots, later the Kings of Great Britain and of the United Kingdom, have served as sovereigns of the Order. When James VII revived the order, the statutes stated that the order would continue the ancient number of Knights, which was described in the preceding warrant as &quot;the Sovereign and twelve Knights-Brethren in allusion to the Blessed Saviour and his Twelve Apostles&quot;. In 1827, George IV increased the number to sixteen members. Women (other than Queens regnant) were originally excluded from the Order; George VI created his wife Queen Elizabeth a Lady of the Thistle in 1937 by a special statute, and in 1987 Elizabeth II allowed the regular admission of women to both the Order of the Thistle and the Order of the Garter.

From time to time, individuals may be admitted to the order by special statutes. Such members are known as &quot;Extra Knights&quot; or &quot;Extra Ladies&quot; and do not count towards the sixteen-member limit. Members of the British royal family are normally admitted through this procedure; the first to be so admitted was Prince Albert. King Olav V of Norway, the first foreigner to be admitted to the order, was also admitted by special statute in 1962.

The sovereign has historically had the power to choose knights of the order. From the eighteenth century onwards, the sovereign made his or her choices upon the advice of the government. George VI felt that the orders of the Garter and the Thistle had been used only for political patronage, rather than to reward actual merit. Therefore, with the agreement of the Prime Minister (Clement Attlee) and the Leader of the Opposition (Winston Churchill) in 1946, both orders returned to the personal gift of the sovereign.

Knights and Ladies of the Thistle may also be admitted to the Order of the Garter. Formerly, many, but not all, Knights elevated to the senior order would resign from the Order of the Thistle. The first to resign from the Order of the Thistle was John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll in 1710; the last to take such an action was Thomas Dundas, 2nd Earl of Zetland in 1872. 

Knights and Ladies of the Thistle may also be deprived of their knighthoods. The only individual to have suffered such a fate was John Erskine, 6th Earl of Mar who lost both the knighthood and the earldom after participating in the Jacobite Rising of 1715.

The order has five officers: the Chancellor, the Secretary, the Dean, Lord Lyon King of Arms, and the Gentleman Usher of the Green Rod. The Dean is normally a cleric of the Church of Scotland. This office was not part of the original establishment, but was created in 1763 and joined to the office of Dean of the Chapel Royal. The two offices were separated in 1969. The office of Chancellor is mentioned and given custody of the seal of the order in the 1687 statutes, but no-one was appointed to the position until 1913. The office has subsequently been held by one of the knights, though not necessarily the most senior. The Usher of the Order is the Gentleman Usher of the Green Rod (unlike his Garter equivalent, the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, he does not have another function assisting the House of Lords). The Lord Lyon King of Arms, head of the Scottish heraldic establishment, whose office predates his association with the order, serves as King of Arms of the Order.

== Symbolism ==

According to legend, an invading Norse army was attempting to sneak up at night upon a Scottish army&#x27;s encampment. During this operation, one barefoot Norseman had the misfortune to step upon a thistle, causing him to cry out in pain, thus alerting Scots to the presence of the Norse invaders. Some sources suggest the specific occasion was the 1263 Battle of Largs, which marked the beginning of the departure of King Haakon IV (Haakon the Elder) of Norway who, having control of the Northern Isles and Hebrides, had harried the coast of the Kingdom of Scotland for some years.

== Habit and insignia ==
For the Order&#x27;s great occasions, such as its annual service each June or July, as well for coronations, the Knights and Ladies wear an elaborate costume:
* The &quot;mantle&quot; is a green robe worn over their suits or military uniforms. The mantle is lined with white taffeta; it is tied with green and gold tassels. On the left shoulder of the mantle, the star of the order (see below) is depicted.
* The &quot;hat&quot; is made of black velvet and is plumed with white feathers with a black egret&#x27;s or heron&#x27;s top in the middle.
* The &quot;collar&quot; is made of gold and depicts thistles and sprigs of rue. It is worn over the mantle.
* The &quot;St Andrew&quot;, also called the &quot;badge-appendant&quot;, is worn suspended from the collar. It comprises a gold enamelled depiction of St Andrew, wearing a green gown and purple coat, holding a white saltire. Gold rays of a glory are shown emanating from St Andrew&#x27;s head.

Aside from these special occasions, however, much simpler insignia are used whenever a member of the order attends an event at which decorations are worn:
* The &quot;star&quot; of the order consists of a silver St Andrew&#x27;s saltire, with clusters of rays between the arms thereof. In the centre is depicted a green circle bearing the motto of the order in gold majuscules; within the circle, there is depicted a thistle on a gold field. It is worn pinned to the left breast. (Since the Order of the Thistle is the second most senior chivalric order in the UK, a member will wear its star above that of other orders to which he or she belongs, except that of the Order of the Garter; up to four orders&#x27; stars may be worn.)
* The &quot;broad riband&quot; is a dark green sash worn across the body, from the left shoulder to the right hip.
* At the right hip of the Riband, the &quot;badge&quot; of the order is attached. The badge depicts St Andrew in the same form as the &quot;badge-appendant&quot;, surrounded by the order&#x27;s motto.

However, on certain collar days designated by the sovereign, members attending formal events may wear the order&#x27;s collar over their military uniform, formal wear, or other costume. They will then substitute the broad riband of another order to which they belong (if any), since the Order of the Thistle is represented by the collar.

Upon the death of a Knight or Lady, the insignia must be returned to the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood. The badge and star are returned personally to the sovereign by the nearest relative of the deceased.

Officers of the order also wear green robes. The Gentleman Usher of the Green Rod also bears, as the title suggests, a green rod.

== Chapel ==

When James VII created the modern order in 1687, he directed that the Abbey Church at the Palace of Holyroodhouse be converted to a Chapel for the Order of the Thistle, perhaps copying the idea from the Order of the Garter (whose chapel is located in Windsor Castle). James VII, however, was deposed by 1688; the Chapel, meanwhile, had been destroyed during riots. The order did not have a Chapel until 1911, when one was added onto St Giles High Kirk in Edinburgh. Each year, the sovereign resides at the Palace of Holyroodhouse for a week in June or July; during the visit, a service for the order is held. Any new knights or ladies are installed at annual services.

Each member of the order, including the sovereign, is allotted a stall in the chapel, above which his or her heraldic devices are displayed. Perched on the pinnacle of a knight&#x27;s stall is his helm, decorated with mantling and topped by his crest. If he is a peer, the coronet appropriate to his rank is placed beneath the helm. Under the laws of heraldry, women, other than monarchs, do not normally bear helms or crests; instead, the coronet alone is used (if she is a peeress or princess). Lady Marion Fraser had a helm and crest included when she was granted arms; these were displayed above her stall in the same manner as for knights. Unlike other British orders, the armorial banners of Knights and Ladies of the Thistle are not hung in the chapel, but instead in an adjacent part of St Giles High Kirk. The Thistle Chapel does, however, bear the arms of members living and deceased on stall plates. These enamelled plates are affixed to the back of the stall and display its occupant&#x27;s name, arms, and date of admission into the order.

Upon the death of a Knight, his helm, mantling, crest (or coronet or crown) and sword are taken down. The stall plates, however, are not removed; rather, they remain permanently affixed to the back of the stall, so that the stalls of the chapel are festooned with a colourful record of the order&#x27;s knights and ladies since 1911. The entryway just outside the doors of the chapel has the names of the order&#x27;s knights from before 1911 inscribed into the walls giving a complete record of the members of the order.

== Precedence and privileges ==
Knights and Ladies of the Thistle are assigned positions in the order of precedence, ranking above all others of knightly rank except the Order of the Garter, and above baronets. Wives, sons, daughters and daughters-in-law of Knights of the Thistle also feature on the order of precedence; relatives of Ladies of the Thistle, however, are not assigned any special precedence. (Generally, individuals can derive precedence from their fathers or husbands, but not from their mothers or wives.)

Knights of the Thistle prefix &quot;Sir&quot;, and Ladies prefix &quot;Lady&quot;, to their forenames. Wives of Knights may prefix &quot;Lady&quot; to their surnames, but no equivalent privilege exists for husbands of Ladies. Such forms are not used by peers and princes, except when the names of the former are written out in their fullest forms.

Knights and Ladies use the post-nominal letters &quot;KT&quot; and &quot;LT&quot; respectively. When an individual is entitled to use multiple post-nominal letters, &quot;KT&quot; or &quot;LT&quot; appears before all others, except &quot;Bt&quot; or &quot;Btss&quot; (Baronet or Baronetess), &quot;VC&quot; (Victoria Cross), &quot;GC&quot; (George Cross) and &quot;KG&quot; or &quot;LG&quot; (Knight or Lady Companion of the Garter).

Knights and Ladies may encircle their arms with the circlet (a green circle bearing the order&#x27;s motto) and the collar of the order; the former is shown either outside or on top of the latter. The badge is depicted suspended from the collar. The Royal Arms depict the collar and motto of the Order of the Thistle only in Scotland; they show the circlet and motto of the Garter in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Knights and Ladies are also entitled to receive heraldic supporters. This high privilege is shared only by members of the Royal Family, peers, Knights and Ladies Companion of the Garter, and Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the junior orders of chivalry and clan chiefs.

<doc id="355680" wikidata="Q2865296" url="?curid=355680" title="Arthur Porges">
<text>Arthur Porges (; 20 August 1915 – 12 May 2006) was an American writer of numerous short stories, most notably during the 1950s and 1960s, though he continued to write and publish stories until his death.

==Life==
Porges was born in Chicago, Illinois, on August 20, 1915. After completing his B.A. and master&#x27;s degrees in mathematics, he was drafted into the army for World War II and served as an instructor in California.

After the war, he taught mathematics at college before retiring to write.

==Family background==
Porges&#x27;s father, Israel Podgursky, was born in 1885 in the Russian Empire near the eastern border of Poland. He had American associations through his two brothers—Mortimer, a lawyer in Chicago, and Dave, who worked for the Chicago Board of Education—and two sisters, Lilian and Rose, neither of whom married. Mortimer had two daughters, Lois and June. On migrating to the U.S. he changed his name to James Porges, with the new surname adopted from that of a relative, Leo Porges, who had a business in Chicago. Of this, Arthur wrote later, &quot;I&#x27;ve never known if he ... picked the name out of the air, ... or had some ties to the Jewish Porges network.&quot; James Porges worked at the Bell Telephone Company in Chicago, and had four sons: Leonard, Irwin, Arthur, and Walter. Porges observed, &quot;None had children, although all but me married rather late in life.&quot;

Porges&#x27;s mother was Clara Kurzin, who died when he was nine years old. Porges&#x27;s brother Irwin Porges (1909–1998) was a biographer of the American author Edgar Rice Burroughs (&quot;The Man Who Created Tarzan&quot;). Irwin also studied piano and music arranging at a music conservatory, became a professional pianist with dance orchestras, and composed popular songs.

==Career==

As an author, Arthur Porges was most prolific during the mid-twentieth century, publishing most frequently in mystery magazines. He wrote many essays and non-fiction articles.
Many of Porges&#x27;s fictional heroes do not survive in their stories. This element adds tension—for example, in his first published story, &quot;The Rats&quot; (1950), mutated rats eventually overcome a lone survivor in a post-holocaust world. The publication of this story in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; began the working relationship between Porges and the editor Anthony Boucher.

A noted author himself, Boucher helped Porges get his work published, and during the 1950s influenced his writing style a great deal. Among Porges&#x27;s short stories of this period was &quot;The Ruum&quot; (1953). Perhaps his best-known story, &quot;The Ruum&quot; deals with a human who is chased by an indestructible alien machine designed to capture specimens and keep them in suspended animation. Stories of the 1960s include &quot;The Arrogant Vampire&quot; (1961), &quot;One Bad Habit&quot; (1961), and &quot;The Fanatic&quot; (1964).
His brother Irwin collaborated with him on one story, &quot;A Touch of Sun&quot; (1959). Porges also wrote at times under pseudonyms such as Peter Arthur, Pat Rogers, Maxwell Trent, Abel Jacobi, and Derek Page. He wrote in several genres, with his science fiction/fantasy and mystery stories being most celebrated. His output of short stories numbers in the hundreds.

A collection of his short stories, &quot;The Mirror and Other Strange Reflections&quot; (), was published in 2002 by Ash-Tree Press.

==Influences==
Porges read the works of such authors as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Saki, O. Henry, Thomas Henry Huxley, Samuel Johnson, G. K. Chesterton, Rudyard Kipling, Jack London, H. G. Wells, Isaac Asimov, Robert Louis Stevenson, Charles Dickens and Edgar Wallace.

==Adaptations==
The seventh episode, produced in 1982, of the Soviet science fiction TV series &quot;This Fantastic World&quot; was based on one of the finest science fiction stories by Porges, &quot;Priceless Possession&quot; and Oleg Lukyanov&#x27;s story &quot;Uncertainty Principle&quot;.

<text>The Loved One: An Anglo-American Tragedy is a short satirical novel published in 1948 by British novelist Evelyn Waugh about the funeral business in Los Angeles, the British expatriate community in Hollywood, and the film industry.

==Conception==
&quot;The Loved One&quot; was written as a result of Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s trip to Hollywood in February and March 1947. MGM was interested in adapting Waugh&#x27;s novel &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; (1945). Waugh had written that, &quot;I should not think six Americans will understand it&quot; and was baffled and even angered by its popularity in America, referring to it as &quot;my humiliating success in [the] U.S.A.&quot;

Waugh had no intention of allowing MGM to adapt &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, but allowed the film studio to bring him and his wife to California and pay him $2000 a week during negotiations. MGM was offering $140,000 if he granted them the film rights, but Waugh was careful to ensure that the weekly stipend was paid regardless of the results of the negotiation. Waugh was negotiating with MGM producer Leon Gordon, a British playwright and screenwriter, and British screenwriter Keith Winter, whom Waugh had previously known in Europe, who was to write the adaptation. Waugh complained that Winter &quot;sees &quot;Brideshead&quot; purely as a love story&quot;, and that no one at MGM was able to grasp the &quot;theological implication&quot; of the novel. MGM abandoned its pursuit of the novel after Waugh explained to Gordon &quot;what &quot;Brideshead&quot; was about&quot;, and he seemed to &quot;lose heart&quot;, citing aspects highlighted by the censor.

In Hollywood, Waugh enjoyed meeting Charlie Chaplin and Walt Disney (&quot;the two artists of the place&quot;) but complained about the accommodations, the quality of food and the lack of wine at meals, the relaxed dress and informal manners, and the small talk of service workers – &quot;the exact opposite of the English custom by which the upper classes are expected to ask personal questions of the lower&quot;. His trip to Hollywood was successful, however, in a literary way. He wrote &quot;I found a deep mine of literary gold in the cemetery of Forest Lawn and the work of the morticians and intend to get to work immediately on a novelette staged there.&quot; Forest Lawn&#x27;s founder, Dr. Hubert Eaton, and his staff gave Waugh tours of the facility and introduced him to their field. Waugh also had a copy of Eaton&#x27;s book, &quot;Embalming Techniques&quot;, which Waugh annotated with marginalia. As Waugh felt that the eschatological or apocalyptic implications he had intended in &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; had escaped many American readers, he was determined to highlight eschatological aspects of American society in &quot;The Loved One&quot;.

==Plot==
Sir Ambrose Abercrombie visits housemates Dennis Barlow and Sir Francis Hinsley to express his concern about Barlow&#x27;s new job and how it reflects on the British enclave in Hollywood, which is also taken as an announcement of Barlow&#x27;s impending exclusion from British society. Barlow reports to his job at the Happier Hunting Ground, a pet cemetery and funeral service, and picks up a couple&#x27;s dead Sealyham Terrier.

Because of the difficulty he is having rebranding actress Juanita del Pablo as an Irish starlet (having previously rebranded Baby Aaronson as del Pablo), Hinsley is sent to work from home. After his secretary stops showing up, he ventures to Megalopolitan Studios and finds a man named Lorenzo Medici in his office. After working his way through the bureaucracy he finds he has been unceremoniously fired. In the next scene, Abercrombie and other British expatriates are discussing Hinsley&#x27;s suicide and the funeral arrangements.

Barlow, given the task of making Hinsley&#x27;s funeral arrangements, visits Whispering Glades. There he is transfixed by the cosmetician Aimée Thanatogenos, though he has yet to learn her name.

Barlow continues with the funeral arrangements while Hinsley&#x27;s body arrives at Whispering Glades and is tended to by Thanatogenos and the senior mortician Mr. Joyboy.

Barlow visits Whispering Glades seeking inspiration for Hinsley&#x27;s funeral ode. While touring a British-themed section of the cemetery, he meets Thanatogenos and begins his courtship of her when she learns he is a poet.

Six weeks later, Thanatogenos is torn between her very different affections for Barlow and Joyboy. She writes to the advice columnist &quot;The Guru Brahmin&quot; for advice. Joyboy invites her over for dinner and she meets his mother.

The office of the Guru Brahmin consists of &quot;two gloomy men and a bright young secretary&quot;. Tasked with responding to Thanatogenos&#x27; letters is Mr. Slump, a grim drunk who advises that she marry Joyboy. She instead decides to marry Barlow.

Joyboy learns that the poems which Barlow has been using to woo Thanatogenos are not his own, and arranges that Thanatogenos, who still does not know Barlow works for a pet cemetery, attend the funeral of his mother&#x27;s parrot at the Happier Hunting Ground.

Sometime after Thanatogenos&#x27; discovery of Barlow&#x27;s deceptions, Barlow reads the announcement of her engagement to Joyboy. Barlow meets her and she is again torn between the two men. She tracks down Mr. Slump to seek the advice of the Guru Brahmin and finds him, via telephone, in a bar after he has been fired. Slump tells her to jump off a building. She commits suicide by injecting herself with embalming fluid in Joyboy&#x27;s workroom at Whispering Glades.

Joyboy discovers Thanatogenos&#x27; body and seeks assistance from Barlow. Then Barlow meets Abercrombie, who, fearing Barlow&#x27;s plans to become a non-sectarian funeral pastor will further damage the image of the British enclave, pays his return passage to England. Joyboy returns, unaware of Barlow&#x27;s impending departure, and in exchange for all his savings, Barlow says he will leave town so it will appear that he ran away with Thanatogenos. After cremating the body, Barlow registers Joyboy for the Happier Hunting Ground annual postcard service so every year Joyboy will receive a card reading &quot;Your little Aimée is wagging her tail in heaven tonight, thinking of you.&quot;

==Characters==
Dennis Barlow, a celebrated 28-year-old British poet who is brought to Hollywood to write a script for a film biography of Percy Bysshe Shelley. He is fired from his job and, as the novel opens, he is working for the Happier Hunting Ground, a funeral service for pets. He frequently quotes lines of poetry in his speech and writing, especially when he is wooing Aimée Thanatogenos, whom he allows to believe he is the author of those lines. The sources include Alfred Tennyson, Edgar Allan Poe, and others. One quotation, from the poet Richard Middleton, was not publicly identified until 1981, 33 years after the publication of &quot;The Loved One&quot;.

Aimée Thanatogenos, a cosmetician at Whispering Glades. She was named after evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. Her first name is French for &quot;loved one&quot; while her last name is Greek for &quot;born of death&quot;. Waugh describes her eyes as &quot;greenish and remote, with a rich glint of lunacy.&quot;

Mr. Joyboy, senior mortician at Whispering Glades. His trademark is a beaming smile he leaves on the faces of embalmed bodies. He lives with his mother, Mrs. Joyboy, and is dominated by her.

Sir Francis Hinsley, Barlow&#x27;s Hollywood housemate. In his youth, Hinsley authored the widely acclaimed novel &quot;A Free Man Greets the Dawn&quot;, but has long since abandoned writing. Former chief scriptwriter for Megalopolitan Pictures, as the novel opens he works for their publicity department and is struggling with rebranding an actress named Juanita del Pablo into an Irish starlet. He is fired from Megalopolitan and hangs himself.

Sir Ambrose Abercrombie, a distinguished British actor and leader of the British enclave in Hollywood, is primarily concerned to maintain the image of his country in the eyes of Hollywood. It is believed that he is based on actor Sir C. Aubrey Smith.

==Publication and reception==
Waugh began writing &quot;The Loved One&quot; in May 1947. After initial &quot;very slow&quot; going, he finished the first draft in early July and completed the novel in September. It was published in its entirety by Cyril Connolly in the February 1948 issue of &quot;Horizon&quot;. (Hinsley is described reading a copy of &quot;Horizon&quot; in the opening chapter of &quot;The Loved One&quot;.) It was enthusiastically greeted by readers who thought Waugh had returned to early form with this short comic novel.

The novel was successfully published in America as well, though Waugh had feared lawsuits so much that he employed his friend Lord Stanley of Alderley to add a codicil to his will instructing that he be buried at Forest Lawn. Waugh also claimed that American morticians would refuse to service his body should he die in the US. The novel was well-reviewed, however, and sales were good.

&quot;The New Yorker&quot;, though, refused to publish the novel because they thought the themes of the novel had already been well-handled by American authors, such as S. J. Perelman, Sinclair Lewis, and Nathanael West, the latter of whom had written two novels on themes (Hollywood studios and advice columnists) Waugh tackled in &quot;The Loved One&quot;. The magazine wrote &quot;The freshest part of Mr. Waugh&#x27;s story is the part which refers to the English in Hollywood, and we wish, wistfully, that he had concerned himself more exclusively with that theme.&quot;

==Allusions in other works==
Tom Paxton mentions &quot;The Loved One&quot;, along with Jessica Mitford&#x27;s book &quot;The American Way of Death&quot;, as one of the inspirations for his satirical song &quot;Forest Lawn&quot;.

The 1985 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot; is loosely based on the plot of the novel.

==Film adaptation==

The book was adapted in 1965 by Terry Southern and Christopher Isherwood into a film of the same title, which features, while adding to the novel&#x27;s plot with new characters and scenes, many in-joke cameos and familiar California filming locations such as the Greystone Mansion. Isherwood himself can be glimpsed within the film as one of &#x27;Uncle Frank&#x27;s&#x27; mourners.

<doc id="355695" wikidata="Q569487" url="?curid=355695" title="Ansei Purge">
<text>The was a multi-year event during the Bakumatsu period of Japanese history, between 1858 and 1860, during which the Tokugawa shogunate imprisoned, executed, or exiled those who did not support its authority and foreign trade policies. The purge was undertaken by Ii Naosuke in opposition to Imperial Loyalists.

==History==
The Ansei Purge was ordered by Ii Naosuke on behalf of the bakufu faction. He was the Senior Minister during the period preceding the Meiji Restoration and was part of the &quot;kōbu gattai&quot;, the movement opposed by the Revere the Emperor, Expel the Foreigner (&quot;sonnō jōi&quot;) faction. The purge was carried out in an effort to quell opposition to trade treaties with the United States, Russia, Great Britain, France and the Netherlands, particularly under the U.S. - Japan Treaty of Amity and Commerce. It involved the removal from power all opposition by way of imprisonment, torture or exile, and execution. The crackdown also targeted those who opposed the succession of Tokugawa Iesada and the &quot;kōbu gattai&quot; or the policy that attempted to unite the imperial court and the shogunate. Some of the victims included the &quot;sonno joi&quot;, the group who opposed Naosuke&#x27;s appointment of Tokugawa Iemochi over Hitotsubashi Keiki, the candidate of the Mito clan, which was one of the three branches of the Tokugawa family.

Japan descended into chaos after the purge. Elements seeking revenge, particularly radicals from Choshu and sympathizers of the victims launched widespread terrorism. Naosuke was also assassinated by a band of samurai and ronin from Mito. Those who were victimized by the purge reemerged in national politics such as Hitotsubashi Keikei and Matsudaira Shungaku. Attacks against Westerners also increased.

== Victims ==
Over 100 influential people were victims of the purge. Men were forced out of positions within the Bakufu, or from han leadership or from the Imperial Court in Kyoto. Victims of the purge included the following:

;Death Penalty
*Yoshida Shōin
*Hashimoto Sanai
;Permanent house arrest
*Mito Nariaki
*Nagai Naoyuki
*Prince Kuni Asahiko
;House arrest
*Hitotsubashi Yoshinobu
*Tokugawa Yoshikatsu
*Matsudaira Shungaku
*Date Munenari
*Yamauchi Yōdō
*Hotta Masayoshi

===Timeline===
* 1858 (&quot;Ansei 5&quot;): Beginning of the Ansei Purge
* 1859 (&quot;Ansei 6&quot;): Arrests and investigations continuing.
* March 24, 1860 (&quot;Ansei 7, 3rd day of the 3rd month&quot;): Ii Naosuke was assassinated at the Sakurada Gate of Edo Castle. This is also known as the &quot;Sakurada-mon Incident&quot;

Prince Narinaga was a son of Emperor Go-Daigo and Fujiwara no Renshi (藤原廉子, also called Ano Renshi 阿野廉子), daughter of Ano Kinkado. His full brothers were Crown Prince Tsunenaga and Emperor Go-Murakami.

On 17 November 1336 Prince Narinaga became Crown Prince to Emperor Kōmyō. However, Ashikaga Takauji had the prince killed in 1337 when Go-Daigo continued to resist.

Alternatively, Narinaga was placed with Konoe Mototsugu after deposal and died in 1344 (according to Diary by Nakahara no Moromori, 師守記).

<text>The Salafi movement or Salafism () is a fundamentalist revival movement within Sunni Islam, originating in the late 19th century and influential in the Islamic world to this day. The name &quot;Salafiyya&quot; is a self-designation, to call for a return to the traditions of the &quot;pious predecessors&quot; (), the first three generations of Muslims (the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the [his companions], then the , and the third generation, the ), who are believed to exemplify the pure form of Islam. In practice, Salafis claim that they rely on the Qur&#x27;an, the and the (consensus) of the , giving these writings precedence over what they claim as &quot;later religious interpretations&quot;. The Salafi movement aimed to achieve a renewal of Muslim life, and had a major influence on many Muslim thinkers and movements across the Islamic world.

Salafi Muslims oppose &quot;&quot; (religious innovation) and support the implementation of (Islamic law). In its approach to politics, the Salafi movement is sometimes divided by Western academics and journalists into three categories: the largest group being the purists (or quietists), who avoid politics; the second largest group being the activists (or Islamists), who maintain regular involvement in politics; and the third group being the jihadists, who form a minority and advocate armed struggle to restore early Islamic practice. In legal matters, Salafis usually advocate (independent reasoning) and oppose (blind faith) to the four or five schools () of Islamic jurisprudence while some remain largely faithful to them, but do not restrict themselves to the &quot;final&quot; edicts of any specific &quot;madhhab&quot;.

The origins of Salafism are disputed, with some historians like Louis Massignon tracing its origin to the intellectual movement in the second half of the nineteenth century that opposed Westernization emanating from European imperialism (led by Al-Afghani, Muhammad Abduh, and Rashid Rida). However, Afghani and Abduh had not self-described as &quot;Salafi&quot; and the usage of the term to denote them has become outdated today. Abduh&#x27;s more orthodox student Rashid Rida followed hardline Salafism which opposed Sufism, Shi&#x27;ism and incorporated traditional &quot;madh&#x27;hab&quot; system. Rida eventually became a champion of the Wahhabi movement and would influence another strand of conservative Salafis. In the modern academia, Salafism is commonly used to refer to a cluster of contemporary Sunni renewal and reform movements inspired by the teachings of classical theologians—in particular Ibn Taymiyya (1263–1328 CE/661–728 AH). These Salafis dismiss the 19th century reformers as rationalists who failed to interpret scripture in the most literal, traditional sense.

Conservative Salafis regard Syrian scholars like Rashid Rida ( 1935 CE/ 1354 AH) and Muhibb al-Khatib ( 1969 CE/ 1389 AH) as revivalists of Salafi thought in the Arab world. Rida&#x27;s religious orientation was shaped by his association with Syrian Hanbali and Salafi scholars who preserved the tradition of Ibn Taymiyya. These ideas would be popularised by Rida and his disciples, immensely influencing numerous Salafi organisations in the Arab world. Some of the major Salafi reform movements in the Islamic world today include the &quot;Ahl-i Hadith&quot; movement, inspired by the teachings of Shah Waliullah Dehlawi and galvanized through the South Asian jihad of Sayyid Ahmad Shahid; the Wahhabi movement in Arabia; the Padri movement of Indonesia; Algerian Salafism spearheaded by Abdelhamid Ben Badis; and others.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Salafi&quot; as a proper noun and adjective had been used during the classical era to refer to the theological school of the early movement. The treatises of the medieval proto-Salafist theologian Taqi al-Din Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328 C.E/ 728 A.H), which played the most significant role in formalizing the creedal, social and political positions of &quot;Ahl al-Hadith&quot;; constitute the most widely referred classical works in Salafi seminaries.

It is only in modern times that the label &quot;Salafi&quot; has been applied to a distinct movement and theological creed. Both modernists as well as traditionalists could apply the term. Both movements might have opposite approaches but advocate a belief that Islam has been altered and is in need of a return to a previous form of Islam allegedly practised by the &quot;Salafiyya&quot;. 

==Tenets==
According to Bernard Haykel, &quot;temporal proximity to the Prophet Muhammad is associated with the truest form of Islam&quot; among many Sunni Muslims. Salafis are first and foremost religious and social reformers engaged in creating and reproducing particular forms of authority and identity, both personal and communal. They define [their] reformist project first and foremost through creedal tenets (i.e., a theology). Also important in its &quot;manhaj&quot; (Arabic: منهج i.e. Methodology) are certain legal teachings as well as forms of sociability and politics.

The Salafi &quot;da&#x27;wa&quot; is a methodology, but it is not a &quot;madhhab&quot; (school) in &quot;fiqh&quot; (jurisprudence) as is commonly misunderstood. Salafis oppose to the Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i, Hanbali, Hanafi or Zahirite law schools of Sunni fiqh. The followers of Salafi school identify themselves as &quot;Ahlul Sunna wal Jama&#x27;ah&quot; and are also known as &quot;Ahl al-Hadith&quot;. The &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movement champions this early Sunni school of thought, also known as traditionalist theology.

Salafis place great emphasis on practicing actions in accordance with the known &quot;sunnah,&quot; not only in prayer but in every activity in daily life. For instance, many are careful always to use three fingers when eating, to drink water in three pauses, and to hold it with the right hand while sitting. The main doctrines of Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s school, also referred by various academics as &quot;al-Salafiyyah al-Tarikhiyah&quot; (trans: &quot;Historical Salafism&quot;) consist of:
* revival of &quot;the authentic beliefs and practices&quot; of &quot;Salaf al-Salih&quot;
* &quot;upholding tawhid (oneness of God)&quot;
* rejection of partisanship towards &quot;madh&#x27;habs&quot;
* literalist adherence to religious scriptures
* loyalty to Islamic rulers who ruled by &quot;Sharia&quot; (Islamic law)
* objection to &quot;bid&#x27;ah&quot; and heresies

===Views on &quot;Taqlid&quot; (adherence to legal precedent)===

The Salafi thought seeks the re-orientation of &quot;Fiqh&quot; (Islamic Jurisprudence) away from &quot;Taqlid&quot; (adherence to the legal precedent of a particular &quot;Madhhab&quot;) and directly back to the Prophet, his Companions and the &quot;Salaf&quot;. This preferred return to the pure way of the Prophet is termed &quot;Ittiba&quot; (following the Prophet by directly referring to the Scriptures). In legal approach, Salafis are divided between those who, in the name of independent legal judgement (&quot;ijtihad&quot;), reject strict adherence (&quot;taqlid&quot;) to the four schools of law (&quot;madhahib&quot;) and others who remain faithful to these.

Although Muhammad Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab (d. 1792 C.E/ 1206 A.H) had personally rejected the practice of &quot;Taqlid&quot;, Wahhabi scholars favoured following the Hanbali &quot;madhhab&quot; and generally permit &quot;Taqlid&quot; in following &quot;Fatwas&quot; (juristic legal opinions) and encourages following the &quot;madhhabs&quot;. While they doctrinally condemned &quot;Taqlid&quot; and advocated &quot;Ijtihad&quot;, historically the Wahhabi legal practice was grounded mostly within the confines of Hanbali school, until recently. The doctrinal rejection of &quot;Taqlid&quot; by Wahhabis would lead to subsequent emergence of prominent Wahhabi ulema such as Sa&#x27;d ibn &#x27;Atiq, Abd al-Rahman al-Sa&#x27;dii, Ibn &#x27;Uthaymin, Ibn Baz, etc.; who would depart significantly from Hanbali law.

Other Salafi movements, however, believe that &quot;taqlid&quot; is unlawful and challenge the authority of the legal schools. In their perspective, since the &quot;madhhabs&quot; emerged after the era of &quot;Salaf al-Salih&quot; (pious predecessors); those Muslims who follow a &quot;madhhab&quot; without directly searching for Scriptural evidences would get deviated. These include the scholars of &quot;Ahl-i Hadith&quot; movement, Muhammad Nasir Al-Din al-Albani (d. 1999), Muḥammad Ḥayāt al-Sindhī (d. 1750), Ibn &#x27;Amir al-Ṣanʿānī (d. 1182), al-Shawkānī (d. 1834), etc.; who completely condemn &quot;taqlid&quot; (imitation), rejecting the authority of the legal schools, and oblige Muslims to seek religious rulings (&quot;fatwa&quot;) issued by scholars exclusively based on the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Hadith&quot;; with no intermediary involved. The &quot;Ahl-i Hadith&quot; &quot;ulema&quot; would distinguish themselves from the Wahhabis who followed the Hanbali school while they considered themselves as following no particular school. In contemporary era, al-Albani and his disciples, in particular, would directly criticise Wahhabis on the issue of &quot;Taqlid&quot; due to their affinity towards the Hanbali school and called for a re-generated Wahhabism purified of elements contrary to doctrines of the Salaf.

Other Salafi scholars like Sayyid Rashid Rida (d. 1935) follow a middle course, allowing the layperson to do &quot;Taqlid&quot; only when necessary, obliging him to do &quot;Ittiba&quot; when the Scriptural evidences become known to him. Their legal methodology rejects partisanship to the treatises of any particular schools of law, and refer to the books of all &quot;madhhabs&quot;. Following Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim, these scholars accept the rich literary heritage of Sunni &quot;Fiqh&quot; and consider the literature of the four Sunni law-schools as beneficial resources to issue rulings for the contemporary era. At the far end of the spectrum, some Salafis hold that adhering to &quot;taqlid&quot; is an act of &quot;shirk&quot; (polytheism).

Contemporary Salafis generally discard the practice of adhering to the established rulings of any particular &quot;Madhhab&quot;, condemning the principle of &quot;Taqlid&quot; (blind imitation) as a &quot;bid&#x27;ah&quot; (innovation) and are significantly influenced by the legal principles of the Zahirite school, historically associated with anti-&quot;madhhab&quot; doctrines that opposed the canonization of legal schools. Early Zahirite scholar Ibn Hazm&#x27;s condemnation of &quot;Taqlid&quot; and calls to break free from the interpretive system of the canonized schools by espousing a &quot;Fiqh&quot; directly grounded on &quot;Qura&#x27;n&quot; and &quot;Hadith&quot;; have conferred a major impact on the &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movement. Salafi legalism is most often marked by its departure from the established rulings (&quot;mu&#x27;tamad&quot;) of the four Sunni &quot;madhahib&quot;, as well as frequently aligning with Zahirite views mentioned by Ibn Hazm in his legal compendium &quot;Al-Muhalla&quot;.

=== Scholarly hierarchy ===
Bernard Haykel notes that due to the peculiarity of its methodology, Salafis enjoy a relatively less rigid scholarly hierarchy of authorities (&quot;ulema&quot;). Most Salafis unlike other traditional and pre-modern Muslims do not subscribe to a hierarchy that rigorously &quot;constrains and regulates... the output of opinions&quot;. As an interpretive community, Salafi tradition, &quot;in contrast to other Muslim traditions of learning&quot;, is &quot;relatively open, even democratic&quot;.

=== Methodology and hermeneutics ===
Contemporary proponents of the Athari school of theology largely come from the Salafi movement; they uphold the &quot;Athari&quot; works of Ibn Taymiyya. Ibn Taymiyya himself, a disputed and partly rejected scholar during his lifetime, became a major scholar among followers of the Salafi movement credited with the title &quot;Shaykh al-Islam&quot;. Other important figures include major scholars important in Islamic history, such as Ahmad ibn Hanbal. While proponents of Kalam revere early generations of Salaf al-Salih, viewing Muhammad and the &quot;Sahaba&quot; as exemplar role models in religious life, they emulate them through the lens of the classical traditions of the &quot;madhahib&quot; and its religious clergy. On the other hand, Salafis attempt to follow the &quot;Salaf al-Salih&quot; through recorded scriptural evidences, often bypassing the classical manuals of &quot;madhahib&quot;. Nonetheless, both Salafis and &quot;Mutakallimun&quot; empasize the significance of the Salaf in the Sunni tradition&quot;.&quot;

Salafi Muslims consider Qur&#x27;an, &quot;Sunnah&quot; (which they equate with the &quot;Kutub al-Sittah&quot;) and The Actions or Sayings of The Sahaba as the only valid authoritative source for Islam. While Salafis believe that investigation of novel issues should be understood from the Scriptures in consideration of the context of modern era, they oppose rationalist interpretations of Scriptures. In addition to limiting the usage of logic with regards to textual interpretations, Salafi scholars also reduce the importance given to medieval legal manuals and texts, giving more priority to the texts from the early generations of the &quot;Salaf&quot;. Salafis favor practical implementation as opposed to disputes with regards to meanings, meaning may be considered either clear or something beyond human understanding. As adherents of Athari theology, Salafis believe that engagement in speculative theology (&quot;kalam)&quot; is absolutely forbidden. Atharis engage in strictly literal and amodal reading of the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;hadith&quot; (prophetic traditions) and only their clear or apparent meanings have the sole authority in creedal affairs. As opposed to one engaged in &quot;Ta&#x27;wil&quot; (metaphorical interpretation), they do not attempt to conceptualize the meanings of the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; rationally; and believe that the real meanings should be consigned to God alone (&quot;tafwid&quot;). Following the Salafi hermeneutic approach, Salafis differ from that of non-Salafis in some regards of permissibility.

Ibn Taymiyya was known for making scholarly refutations of religious groups such as the Sufis, Jahmites, Asha&#x27;rites, Shias, &quot;Falsafa&quot; etc., through his numerous treatises. Explaining the theological approach of &quot;Salafiyya&quot;, Ibn Taymiyya states in a &quot;fatwa&quot;:

===Teachings of Ibn Taymiyya===
The followers of the &quot;Salafiyya&quot; school look to the medieval jurist Ibn Taymiyya as the most significant classical scholarly authority in theology and spirituality. Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s theological treatises form the core doctrinal texts of Wahhabi, Ahl-i Hadith and various other Salafi movements. According to the monotheistic doctrine of Ibn Taymiyya, &quot;Tawhid&quot; is categorised into three types: &quot;At-tawḥīd ar-rubūbiyya&quot; (Oneness in Lordship), &quot;At-tawḥīd al-ulūhiyya&quot; (Oneness in Worship) and &quot;At-tawhid al-assmaa was-sifaat&quot; (Oneness in names and attributes). Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s interpretation of the &quot;Shahada&quot; (Islamic testimony) as the testimony to worship God alone &quot;only by means of what He has legislated&quot;, without partners, is adopted by the Salafis as the foundation of their faith. In the contemporary era, Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s writings on theology and innovated practices have inspired Salafi movements of diverse kinds. The increased prominence of these movements in the twentieth century has led to a resurgence in interest of the writings of Ibn Taymiyya far beyond traditional Salafi circles. Salafis commonly refer to Ibn Taymiyya by the title &quot;Shaykh al-Islām&quot;. Alongside Ibn Taymiyya, his disciples Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, Ibn Kathir, Al-Dhahabi, etc. constitute the most referenced classical scholarship in Salafi circles.

The scholarly works of Ibn Taymiyya, which advocate Traditionalist Creedal positions and intensely critique other theological schools, embody the theology of the &quot;Salafiyya&quot; school. Ibn Taymiyya also cited a scholarly consensus (&quot;Ijma&quot;), on the permissibility of ascribing ones self to the beliefs of the Salaf, stating:

==History==

Historians and academics date the emergence of &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movement to the late 19th-century Arab world, an era when European colonial powers were dominant. Notable leaders of the movement included Jamal al-Din Qasimi (1866–1914), &#x27;Abd al-Razzaq al Bitar (1837–1917), Tahir al-Jazai&#x27;iri (1852–1920) and Muhammad Rashid Rida (1865–1935). Until the First World War, religious missions of the Salafi call in the Arab East had operated secretively. Following the First World War, the Salafi ideas were spread and established among the intelligentsia. Politically oriented scholars like Rashid Rida had also emphasized the necessity to establish an Islamic state that implements &quot;Sharia&quot; (Islamic law) and thus laid the intellectual foundations for a more conservative strand of &quot;Salafiyya&quot;, which would also influence the ideologues of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.

The usage of the term &quot;&quot;Salafiyya&quot; to denote a theological reform movement based on the teachings of the &quot;Salaf al-Salih&quot;; was popularised by the Syrian disciples of Tahir al-Jaza&#x27;iri who were active in Egypt during the 1900s. They opened the famous &quot;al-Maktaba al-Salafiyya&quot;&quot; (&quot;The Salafi Bookshop&quot;) in Cairo in 1909. Rashid Rida co-operated with the owners of the library starting from 1912 and together published classical works, Hanbali treatises, pro-Wahhabi pamphlets, etc. as well as numerous articles through their official journal &quot;&quot;Al-Majalla al-Salafiyya&quot;. The immense popularity of the term at the time caused the Catholic Orientalist scholar Louis Massignon to mistakenly associate the label with Jamal al-Din Afghani and Muhammad &#x27;Abduh, which became the standard practice for Western scholars for much of the 20th century, at the expense of conceptual veracity.

Salafis believe that the label &quot;Salafiyya&quot;&quot; existed from the first few generations of Islam and that it is not a modern movement. To justify this view, Salafis rely on a handful of quotes from medieval times where the term &quot;Salafi&quot; is used. One of the quotes used as evidence and widely posted on Salafi websites is from the genealogical dictionary of al-Sam&#x27;ani (d. 1166), who wrote a short entry about the surname &quot;al-Salafi&quot; (the Salafi): &quot;According to what I heard, this [surname indicates one&#x27;s] ascription to the pious ancestors and [one&#x27;s] adoption of their doctrine [madhhabihim].&quot; In his biographical dictionary &quot;Siyar a`lam al-nubala,&quot; Athari theologian Al-Dhahabi described his teacher Ibn Taymiyya as a person who &quot;supported the pure Sunna and &quot;al-Tariqa al-Salafiyah&quot; (&quot;Salafiyah way or methodology&quot;)&quot;; referring to his non-conformist juristic approach that was based on direct understanding of Scriptures and his practice of issuing &quot;fatwas&quot; that contradicted the &quot;madhabs&quot;.

At least one scholar, Henri Lauzière, casts doubt on al-Sam&#x27;ani, claiming he &quot;could only list two individuals—a father and his son—who were known&quot; as al-Salafi. &quot;Plus, the entry contains blank spaces in lieu of their full names, presumably because al-Sam&#x27;ani had forgotten them or did not know them.&quot; In addition, Lauzière claims &quot;al-Sam&#x27;ani&#x27;s dictionary suggests that the surname was marginal at best, and the lone quotation taken from Al-Dhahabi, who wrote 200 years later, does little to prove Salafi claims.&quot;

=== Origins ===

The Salafi movement emphasizes looking up to the era of the &quot;Salaf al-Salih&quot;; who were the early three generations of Muslims that succeeded Prophet Muhammad. They consider the faith and practices of &quot;salaf al-salih&quot; as virtuous and exemplary. By seeking to capture values of the Salaf in their own lives, Salafis attempt to recreate a &#x27;golden age&#x27;, and revive a pristine version of Islam, stripped of all later accretions, including the four schools of law as well as popular Sufism. The emergence of Salafism coincided with the rise of Western colonialism across many parts of the Islamic world. Between the eighteenth and the twentieth centuries, these reformist movements called for a direct return to the Scriptures, institutional standardisations and &quot;jihad&quot; against colonial powers.

The movement developed across various regions of the Islamic World in the late 19th century as an Islamic response against the rising European imperialism. The Salafi revivalists were inspired by the creedal doctrines of the medieval Syrian Hanbali theologian Ibn Taymiyya, who had strongly condemned philosophy and various features of Sufism as heretical. Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s radical reform programme called for Muslims to return to the pristine Islam of the &quot;Salaf al-Salih&quot; (pious ancestors); through a direct understanding of Scriptures. Further influences of the early Salafiyya movement included various 18th-century Islamic reform movements such as the Wahhabi movement in the Arabian Peninsula, subcontinental reform movements spearheaded by Shah Waliullah Dehlawi, Shah Ismail Dehlawi and Sayyid Ahmad Shaheed as well as the Yemeni &quot;islah&quot; movement led by Al-San&#x27;aani and Al-Shawkani.
These movements had advocated the belief that the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Sunnah&quot; are the primary sources of &quot;sharia&quot; and the legal status quo should be scrutinized based on &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Hadith.&quot; Far from being novel, this idea was a traditionist thesis kept alive within the Hanbali school of law. The Wahhabi movement, under the leadership of Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, forcefully revived Hanbali traditionism in 18th century Arabia. Influenced by the Hanbali scholars Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328) and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (d. 751/1350); the teachings of Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab were also closely linked to the formulation of proto-Hanbalism expounded by early Hanbali writers &#x27;Abd Allah ibn Ahmad (d. 290/903), Abu Bakr al-Khallal (d. 311/923) as well as non-Hanbali scholars like Ibn Hazm, whom he cited frequently. Indian Hadith specialist Shah Waliullah Dehlawi, while rejecting &quot;Taqlid&quot;, also emphasised on involving the &quot;Fuqaha&quot; (jurisconsultants) in the study of &quot;hadith&quot;, their interpretations and rationalisation. Thus, he was accommodative towards classical structures of &quot;Fiqh&quot;. In Yemen, influential scholar Muhammad ibn Ali Al-Shawkani (1759–1834) condemned &quot;Taqlid&quot; far more fiercely, and his movement advocated radical rejection of classical &quot;Fiqh&quot; structures. The promotion of &quot;Ijtihad&quot; of these movements was also accompanied by an emphasis on strict adherence to &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Hadith&quot;.

==== Ottoman Empire ====

Kadızadelis (also &quot;Qādīzādali&quot;) was a seventeenth-century puritanical reformist religious movement in the Ottoman Empire that followed Kadızade Mehmed (1582-1635), a revivalist Islamic preacher. Kadızade and his followers were determined rivals of Sufism and popular religion. They condemned many of the Ottoman practices that Kadızade felt were bidʻah &quot;non-Islamic innovations&quot;, and passionately supported &quot;reviving the beliefs and practices of the first Muslim generation in the first/seventh century&quot; (&quot;enjoining good and forbidding wrong&quot;). 

Driven by zealous and fiery rhetoric, Kadızade Mehmed was able to inspire many followers to join in his cause and rid themselves of any and all corruption found inside the Ottoman Empire. Leaders of the movement held official positions as preachers in the major mosques of Baghdad, and &quot;combined popular followings with support from within the Ottoman state apparatus&quot;. Between 1630 and 1680 there were many violent quarrels that occurred between the Kadızadelis and those that they disapproved of. As the movement progressed, activists became &quot;increasingly violent&quot; and Kadızadelis were known to enter &quot;mosques, tekkes and Ottoman coffeehouses in order to mete out punishments to those contravening their version of orthodoxy.&quot;

=== Evolution ===

During the mid-nineteenth century British India, the &quot;Ahl-i Hadith&quot; movement revived the teachings of Shah Waliullah and Al-Shawkani; advocating rejection of &quot;Taqlid&quot; and study of hadith. They departed from Shah Waliullah&#x27;s school with a literalist approach to &quot;hadith&quot;, and rejected classical legal structures; inclining towards the &quot;Zahirite&quot; school. In the 19th century, Hanbali traditionism would be revived in Iraq by the influential Alusi family. Three generations of Alusis, Mahmud al-Alusi (d. 1853), Nu&#x27;man al-Alusi (d. 1899) and Mahmud Shukri al-Alusi (1857–1924); were instrumental in spreading the doctrines of Ibn Taymiyya and the Wahhabi movement in the Arab world. Mahmud Shukri Al-Alusi, a defender and historian of the Wahhabi movement, was also a leader of the &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movement. All these reformist tendencies merged into the early &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movement, a theological faction prevalent across the Arab world during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, which was closely associated with the works of Sayyid Rashid Rida (1865–1935).

==== Late nineteenth-century ====
The first phase of the &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movement emerged amidst the reform-minded &quot;ulema&quot; of the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire during the late nineteenth century. The movement relied primarily upon the works of Hanbali theologian Ahmad Ibn Taymiyya, whose call to follow the path of &quot;Salaf&quot;, inspired their name. The early phase of this tradition sought a middle-way that synthesised between &quot;&#x27;ilm&quot; and &quot;Tasawwuf&quot;. Damascus, a major centre of Hanbali scholarship in the Muslim World, played a major role in the emergence and dissemination of the ideas of this early trend of the &quot;Salafiyya&quot;. Some scholars in this phase like Amir &#x27;Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza&#x27;iri, re-interpreted Ibn Arabi&#x27;s mystical beliefs and reconciled them with the opposing theological doctrines of Ibn Taymiyya to address new challenges. Other major figures in the movement included &#x27;Abd al-Razzaq Al-Bitar, Jamal al-Din al-Qasimi, Tahir al-Jazairi, etc. &#x27;Abd al-Razzaq Al-Bitar (the grandfather of Muhammad Bahjat al Bitar, a disciple of Rashid Rida) was the leader of the more traditional branch of the reform trend, which would become the &quot;Salafiyya&quot; of Damascus. Years later, Rashid Rida would describe him as the &quot;mujaddid madhhab al-salaf fil-Sham&quot; (the reviver of the ancestral doctrine in Syria). While these reformers were critical of various aspects of popular Sufism, they didn&#x27;t deny Sufism completely. The Cairene school of Muhammad Abduh emerged as a separate trend in 1880s, and would be influenced by the Damascene &quot;Salafiyya&quot;, as well as Mu&#x27;tazilite philosophy. Abduh&#x27;s movement sought a rationalist approach to adapt to the increasing pace of modernisation. While &#x27;Abduh was critical of certain Sufi practices, his writings had Sufi inclinations and he retained love for &quot;true Sufism&quot; as formulated by Al-Ghazali.

The Damascene &quot;Salafiyya&quot; was also influenced by their reformist counterparts in Baghdad, especially the scholars of the Alusi family. Abu Thana&#x27; Shihab al-Din al-Alusi (1802–1854) was the first of the Alusi family of &quot;ulama&quot; to promote reformist ideas, influenced by Wahhabism through his teacher &#x27;Ali al-Suwaydi. He also combined the theological ideas of Sufis and &quot;Mutakallimun&quot; (dialecticians) like Razi in his reformist works. Shihab al-Din&#x27;s son, Nu&#x27;man Khayr al-Din al-Alusi, was also heavily influenced by the treatises of Siddiq Hasan Khan, an early leader of the &quot;Ah-i Hadith&quot; movement. He regularly corresponded with him and received an &quot;Ijazat&quot; (license to teach) from Siddiq Hasan Khan, and became the leader of the Salafi trend in Iraq. Later he would also send his son &#x27;Ala&#x27; al-Din (1860–1921) to study under Hasan Khan. Khayr al-Din Alusi would write lengthy polemics and treatises advocating the teachings of Ibn Taymiyya. The Iraqi reformers rejected the validity of &quot;Taqlid&quot; in jurisprudence, calling for &quot;Ijtihad&quot; and condemned ritual innovations like tomb-visitations for the purpose of worship.

&quot;Salafiyya&quot; tradition had become dominant in Syria by the 1880s, due to its popularity amongst the reformist &quot;ulema&quot; in Damascus. Furthermore; most of the medieval treatises of the classical Syrian theologian Ibn Taymiyya were preserved in various Damascene mosques. Salafi scholars gathered these works and indexed them in the archives of the Zahiriyya Library (&quot;Maktabat Zahiriyya&quot;), one of the most prominent Islamic libraries of the 19th century. Most influential Salafi scholars during this period were Tahir al-Jazai&#x27;ri, &#x27;Abd al-Razzaq al-Bitar and Jamal al-Din Qasimi. These scholars took precedent from the 18th-century reformers influenced by Ibn Taymiyya, such as Al-Shawkani, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab, Shah Waliullah etc. and called for a return to the purity of the early era of the &quot;Salaf al-Salih&quot; (righteous forebears). Like Ibn Taymiyya during the 13th century; they viewed themselves as determined preachers calling to defend &quot;Tawhid&quot; (Islamic monotheism), attacking &quot;bid&#x27;ah&quot; (religious innovations), criticising the Ottoman monarchy and its clerical establishment as well as relentlessly condemning Western ideas such as nationalism. According to historian Itzchak Weismann: &quot;The Salafi trend of Damascus constituted a religious response to the political alliance forged between the Ottoman State under the modernizing autocracy of Sultan Abdül Hamid II and orthodox sufi shaykhs and &quot;ulama&quot; who were willing to mobilize the masses in his support.&quot;

==== Post-WW1 Era ====

 By the 1900s, the reformers had already become commonly known as &quot;Salafis&quot;, which in-part was also used to deflect accusations from their opponents; to emphasize that they were different from the Wahhabis of Najd. The Salafi turn against Ibn &#x27;Arabi and Sufism would materialize a decade later, after the First World War, under the leadership of Rashid Rida. This second-stage of &quot;Salafiyya&quot; was championed by Rashid Rida and his disciples across the Islamic World, advocating a literalist understanding of the Scriptures. They were also characterised by a militant hostility to Western imperialism and culture. In addition to condemnations of tomb visits, popular Sufi practices, brotherhoods, miracles and mystical orders; Rida&#x27;s criticism of Sufism extended to all of it and beyond the critiques of his fellow Salafi comrades. He questioned the &quot;murid&quot;-&quot;murshid&quot; relationship in mysticism, as well as the &quot;Silsilas&quot; (chains of transmission) upon which &quot;Tariqah&quot; structures were built. In particular, Rida fiercely rebuked political quietism and pacifist doctrines of various Sufi orders. The &quot;Salafiyya&quot; of Rida and his disciples held onto an ideal of the complete return to the religious and political ways of the &quot;salaf&quot;. In calling for a return to the &quot;Salaf&quot;, Rashid Rida emphasised the path of the first four Rightly-Guided Caliphs (&quot;Khulafa Rashidin&quot;) and the revival of their principles. Rida&#x27;s revivalist efforts contributed to the construction of a collective imagined Salafi community operating globally, transcending national borders. For this reason, he is regarded as one of the founding pioneers of the &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movement and his ideas inspired many Islamic revivalist movements.
Rashid Rida&#x27;s religious approach was rooted in reviving Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s theology as the solution to rectify the decline and disintegration of the Islamic World. &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movement took a much more conservative turn under Rida&#x27;s mantle and became vehemently critical of the clerical establishment. Rida&#x27;s doctrines deeply impacted Islamist ideologues of the Muslim Brotherhood such as Hasan al-Banna (d. 1949) and Sayyid Qutb (d. 1966) who advocated a holistic conception of Islamic state and society; similar to the Wahhabi movement. Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s Syrian leaders like Mustapha al-Siba&#x27;i and &#x27;Isam al-&#x27;Attar were also influential in the movement and their ideas influenced numerous Jordanian students. The Damascene &quot;Salafiyya&quot; consisted of major scholarly figures like Muhammad Bahjat al-Bitar al-Athari, &#x27;Ali al-Tantawi, Nasir al-Din al-Albani, &#x27;Abd al-Fattah al-Imam, Mazhar al-&#x27;Azma, al-Bashir al-Ibrahimi, Taqiy al-Din al-Hilali, Muhiy al-Din al-Qulaybi, &#x27;Abd Allah al-Qalqayli, etc. Numerous books of the movement were printed and published through the Islamic Bookstore in Lebanon owned by Zuhayr Shawish.

The early leaders of &quot;Salafiyya&quot; like Sayyid Rashid Rida (d. 1935), Jamal al-Din Qasimi (d. 1914), etc. had considered traditionalist theology as central to their comprehensive socio-political reform programme. Rashid Rida, for instance, argued that Athari theology represented Sunni orthodoxy, was less divisive and provided a more reliable basis of faith than Ash&#x27;arism. According to Rida, Salafi creed was easier to understand than &quot;Kalam&quot; (speculative theology) and hence granted a stronger bulwark against the dangers posed by atheism and other heresies. Salafi reformers also hailed the medieval theologian Ibn Taymiyya as a paragon of Sunni orthodoxy and emphasized that his strict conception of &quot;Tawhid&quot; was an important part of the doctrine of the forefathers (&quot;madhhab al-salaf&quot;). Despite this, the Salafi reformers during this era were more concerned with pan-Islamic unity and hence refrained from accusing the majority of their co-religionists of being heretics; professing their creedal arguments with moderation. Jamal al-Din Qasimi decried sectarianism and bitter polemics between Atharis and followers of other creedal schools, despite considering them unorthodox. For Rashid Rida, intra-Sunni divisions between Atharis and Ash&#x27;arites, were an evil that weakened the strength of the &quot;Ummah&quot; (Muslim community) and enabled foreigners to gain control over Muslim lands. Hence, Rida held back from adopting an exclusivist attitude against Asharis during the first two decades of the 20th century.

Beginning from the mid-1920s, this leniency gradually disappeared from Salafi activists and scholars to give way to a more partisan stance. Mahmud Shukri al-Alusi, for example, was more uncompromising in his defense of Salafi theology than Rida and Qasimi. The hardening of Salafi stance was best represented by Rashid Rida&#x27;s disciple Muhammad Bahjat al Bitar (1894–1976) who made robust criticisms of speculative theology, by compiling treatises that revived the creedal polemics of Ibn Taymiyya. One such treatise titled &quot;Al-Kawthari wa-ta&#x27;liqatuhu&quot; published in 1938 strongly admonishes the Ottoman Maturidite scholar Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari (1879–1952); accusing him of heresy. In the treatise, Bitar vigorously advocates Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s literalist approach to the theological question of the Divine attributes (&quot;Al- Asma wa-l-Sifat&quot;) and seemingly anthropomorphic expressions in the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot;. At the height of his career, Bitar enjoyed the respect of Syrian &quot;ulema&quot; and laypersons of all groups. For his student Nasir al-Din Albani (1914–1999) and his purist Salafi followers, Bitar was a master of theology and &quot;hadith.&quot; For the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, Bitar&#x27;s studies of Islam and the Arabic language were an asset for Islamic Renaissance.

=== Contemporary era ===

Syrian &quot;Salafiyya&quot; tradition that emerged in late nineteenth century consisted of two divergent tendencies: an apolitical Quietist trend and a &quot;Salafi-Islamist hybrid&quot;. The early &quot;Salafiyya&quot; led by Rashid Rida was dominated by revolutionary Pan-Islamists who had socio-political goals and advocated for the restoration of an Islamic Caliphate through military struggle against European colonial powers. However, contemporary &quot;Salafiyya&quot; are dominated by Purists who eschew politics and advocate Islamic Political Quietism. Contemporary Purist Salafism, widely known as &quot;the &quot;Salafi Manhaj&quot;&quot; emerged from the 1960s as an intellectual hybrid of three similar, yet distinct, religious reform traditions: the Wahhabi movement in Arabia, &quot;Ahl-i Hadith&quot; movement in India and &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movement in the Arab world of the late-19th and early 20th centuries. The person most responsible for this transformation was the Albanian Islamic hadith scholar Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani, a protege of Rashid Rida, who is generally considered as the &quot;spiritual father&quot; of the Purist Salafi current and respected by all contemporary Salafis as &quot;the greatest hadith scholar of his generation&quot;.

As of 2017, journalist Graeme Wood estimated that Salafi &quot;probably&quot; make up &quot;fewer than 10%&quot; of Muslims globally, but by the 21st century, Salafi teachings and ideas had become so mainstreamised that many modern Muslims, even those who do not self-identify as Salafi, have adopted various aspects of Salafism.

At times, Salafism has also been deemed a hybrid of Wahhabism and other post-1960s movements. Academics and historians have used the term &quot;Salafism&quot; to denote &quot;a school of thought which surfaced in the second half of the 19th century as a reaction to the spread of European ideas&quot; across the Islamic World and &quot;sought to expose the roots of modernity within Muslim civilization&quot;. Starting from the French scholar Louis Massignon, Western scholarship for much of the 20th-century considered the Islamic Modernist movement of 19th-century figures Muhammad Abduh and Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (who were Ash&#x27;ari rationalists) to be part of the wider &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movement. However, contemporary Salafis follow a literalist approach with a &quot;heavy reliance on hadith&quot;, looking up to Ibn Taymiyya and his disciples like Ibn Kathir, Ibn Qayyim, etc. whom they regard as important classical religious authorities. Major contemporary figures in the movement include al-Albani, Taqi al-Din al-Hilali, ibn &#x27;Uthaymin, Ibn Baz, Ehsan Elahi Zahir, Muhammad ibn Ibrahim, Rashid Rida, Thanā Allāh Amritsari, Abd al-Hamid Bin Badis, Zubair Ali Zaee, Ahmad Shakir, Saleh Al-Fawzan, Zakir Naik, Abdul-Ghaffar Hasan, Sayyid Sabiq, Salih al-Munajjid, Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq, Muhammad al-Gondalwi, etc.

In the modern era, some Salafis tend to take the surname &quot;Al-Salafi&quot; and refer to the label &quot;Salafiyya&quot; in various circumstances to evoke a specific understanding of Islam that is supposed to differ from that of other Sunnis in terms of &quot;&#x27;Aqidah&quot; (creed) and approach to &quot;Fiqh&quot; (legal tradition).

==Political trends within Salafism==

Some Western analysts, most prominently Quintan Wiktorowicz in an article published in 2006, have classified Salafis into three groups – purists, activists, and Jihadis – based on their approach to politics. Purists focus on education and missionary work to solidify the &quot;Tawhid&quot;; activists focus on political reform and re-establishing a Caliphate through the means of political activities, but not violence (sometimes called Salafist activism); and jihadists share similar political goals as the politicians, but engage in violent Jihad (sometimes called Salafi jihadism and/or Qutbism).

Following the Arab Spring, Salafis across the Arab World have formed various political parties that actively advocate for Islamic social and political causes in the region.

=== Purists ===
&quot;Purists&quot; are Salafists who focus on non-violent &quot;da&#x27;wah&quot; (preaching of Islam), education, and &quot;purification of religious beliefs and practices&quot;, who follow the Salafi &quot;&#x27;aqida&quot; (creed). They dismiss politics as &quot;a diversion or even innovation that leads people away from Islam&quot;. Also known as conservative Salafism, its adherents seek to distance themselves from politics. This strand focuses its attention on the study of Islamic &quot;sharia&quot;, educating the masses and preaching to the society. This methodology is seen as attracting a significant section of pious Muslims who seek to be driven solely by religious objectives but not political objectives. Conservative Salafis are disinterested in getting entangled in the problems and consequences that accompany political activism. According to them, a prolonged movement of &quot;purification and education&quot; of Muslims is essential for Islamic revival through reaping a &quot;pure, uncontaminated Islamic society&quot; and thereby establish an Islamic state.

Some of them never oppose rulers. Madkhalism, as an example, is a strain of Salafists viewed as supportive of authoritarian regimes in the Middle East. Taking its name from the controversial Saudi Arabian cleric Rabee al-Madkhali, the movement lost its support in Saudi Arabia proper when several members of the Permanent Committee (the country&#x27;s clerical body) denounced Madkhali personally. Influence of both the movement and its figureheads have waned so much within the Muslim world that analysts have declared it to be a largely European phenomenon.

=== Salafi activists ===
Further along the spectrum are the Salafi-Activists (or &quot;haraki&quot;) who advocate the transformation of societies through political action. They include Islamist organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood, Egyptian &quot;Hizb al-Nour&quot; (Party of Light), the Al Islah Party of Yemen, the Al Asalah of Bahrain, and the &quot;ulema&quot; affiliated to the movement known as &quot;Al-Sahwa al-Islamiyya&quot; (Islamic Awakening). Committed to advancing &quot;the Islamic solution&quot; for all socio-political problems; Salafi-Activists are vehemently hostile to secularism, Israel, and the West. Their strategy involves working within the established order, to achieve the ultimate objective of replacing that order with an Islamic state.

Activists are different from the Salafi-jihadists in that they eschew violence and differ from Salafi purists in that they engage in modern political processes. Salafi-Activists have a long tradition of political activism in major Arab Islamist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood and its various branches and affiliates. Salafi activism originated in the 1950s to 60s Saudi Arabia, where many Muslim Brothers took refuge from the prosecution by the Nasser regime. There, they synthesized their Muslim Brotherhood beliefs with Salafism, which led to the creation of the Salafi activist trend exemplified by the Sahwa movement in the 80s, promulgated by Safar Al-Hawali and Salman al-Ouda.

In addition to being strong advocates of Sunni empowerment in the post-Arab Spring context, Salafi parties regularly warn against Iran&#x27;s interventionist and expansionist ambitions in the Arab World. Salafi activist scholars have attacked the Khomeinist Shia Crescent project and attempts to Shi&#x27;itization through demographic shifts in countries like Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, etc. As early as the 1980s Syrian Salafi Islamist clerics like Muhammad Surur had launched staunch critiques of Khomeini, denouncing him as a proponent of Iranian domination over the Arab World.

Islamist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood, Jamaat-e Islami, etc. are heavily influenced by the Activist Salafi thought. The movement is very popular amongst the followers of the Salafiyya school, and is often referred to as &quot;mainstream Salafism&quot;. The activist Salafis condemn violence, yet engage actively in the political processes of their societies to advocate for &quot;shari&#x27;a&quot;. As of 2013, this school makes up the majority of Salafism.

The movement is fiercely attacked by the followers of the Madkhalist strand of Quietist Salafism; who totally withdraw themselves from politics. Many Salafi activists are critical of the policies of Gulf kingdoms and have attacked Madkhalis for blindly toeing the political line of the Gulf monarchs. The Activist trend, who some call &quot;politicos&quot;, see politics as &quot;yet another field in which the Salafi creed has to be applied&quot; in order to safeguard justice and &quot;guarantee that the political rule is based upon the Shari&#x27;a&quot;. Al–Sahwa Al-Islamiyya (Islamic Awakening), as example, has been involved in peaceful political reform. Safar Al-Hawali, Salman al-Ouda, Abu Qatada, Zakir Naik, etc. are representatives of this trend. Because of being active on social media, they have earned some support among youth.

After the eruption of Arab Spring, Salafi Muslims have been becoming increasingly active in the political sphere, championing various Islamic causes. Salafi activists are highly critical of the foreign policies of Western countries as well as Iran&#x27;s aggressive activities in the region, such as its military intervention in Syria that backed the Alawite-dominated regime of Bashar al-Assad against Sunnis. Some Quietist Salafis have also began organizing political parties, in response to threats posed by wars and external interference in Arab countries. These include the Al-Nour Party in Egypt and Ansar al-Sunna in Sudan.

=== Salafi jihadists ===

&quot;Salafi Jihadism&quot; was a term invented by Gilles Kepel to describe those self-claiming Salafi groups who began developing an interest in (armed) jihad during the mid-1990s. Practitioners are often referred to as &quot;Salafi jihadis&quot;, &quot;Salafi jihadists&quot;, &quot;Revolutionary Salafis&quot; or &quot;armed Salafis&quot;. Journalist Bruce Livesey estimates that Salafi jihadists constitute less than 1.0 percent of the world&#x27;s 1.2 billion Muslims (i.e., less than 10 million).

Another definition of Salafi jihadism, offered by Mohammed M. Hafez, is an &quot;extreme form of Sunni Islamism that rejects democracy and Shia rule&quot;. Hafez distinguished them from apolitical and conservative Salafi scholars (such as Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani, Muhammad ibn al Uthaymeen, Abd al-Aziz ibn Abd Allah ibn Baaz and Abdul-Azeez ibn Abdullaah Aal ash-Shaikh), but also from the sahwa movement associated with Salman al-Ouda or Safar Al-Hawali. Dr. Joas Wagemakers defines Salafi-Jihadists as those Salafis who advocate &quot;Jihad&quot; against secular rulers through armed, revolutionary methods. Abu Muhammad al-Maqidisi, Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir, Abu Mus&#x27;ab al-Zarqawi, Abubakr al-Baghdadi, etc. are the major contemporary figures in this movement. Major Jihadi Salafi groups include the Islamic State organization, Boko Haram, and Al-Shabaab.

All Salafi-Jihadists agree on the revolutionary overthrow of existing ruling order through armed Jihad; and its replacement with a Global Caliphate. They believe that Jihad is essential to Islamic piety and belief, an individual obligation (&quot;fard &#x27;al-Ayn&quot;) on all Muslims; which the Palestinian Jihadist scholar &#x27;Abdallah &#x27;Azzam (1941–89) asserted as &quot;the most excellent form of worship&quot;. Salafi-Jihadists regard themselves as the heirs of Sayyid Qutb, an influential Islamist scholar who led the radical wing of the Muslim Brotherhood during the 1960s. Inspired by their reading of Ibn Taymiyya, they are strong advocates of &quot;(&quot;excommunication) and the principles of &quot;Al-Wala&#x27; wa&#x27;l- Bara&#x27;&quot;. Like Qutb, they also made the belief in the exclusive sovereignty (&quot;Hakimiyya&quot;) of Allah central to &quot;Tawhid&quot;, and condemn all other political doctrines as &quot;Jahiliyya&quot;. Sayyid Qutb&#x27;s &quot;Al-Ma&#x27;alim Fi&#x27;l-tariq&quot; (The Milestones), a short tract which outlined his militant strategy of destroying &quot;Jahiliyya&quot; and replacing it with Islam, would become an influential treatise in the Salafi-Jihadi intellectual circles.

American invasion of Iraq in 2003 became An analysis of the Caucasus Emirate, a Salafi jihadist group, was made in 2014 by Darion Rhodes. It analyzes the group&#x27;s strict observance of tawhid and its rejection of &quot;shirk&quot;, &quot;taqlid&quot; and &quot;bid&#x27;ah&quot;, while believing that Jihad ( holy war) is the only way to advance the cause of Allah on the Earth. The purist and Activist Salafis often strongly disapprove of the Jihadists and rejects its Islamic character. Although rooted in certain fringe interpretations of the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Hadith&quot;, scholars point out that Salafi-Jihadi views are not representative of the broader Islamic tradition. Scholars, thinkers and intellectuals from across the Islamic spectrum – Sunni, Shi&#x27;a, Salafi, Sufi, Wahhabi, modernists and Islamic neo-traditionalists – have come out strongly against various Salafi-jihadi groups and their doctrines; regarding them as &quot;a perversion&quot; of Islamic teachings.

=== Academic Review ===
Wiktorowicz&#x27;s typology has largely been discarded by recent scholarship due to its simplistic assumptions regarding religion, in addition to other limitations, such as its neglect of the changing social, political and cultural realities occurring across the Muslim World. Several researchers have criticised the classification for being unobservant regarding the dynamism of the &quot;Salafiyya&quot;, such it&#x27;s evolving relations with Islamic politics; as well as for its rigid compartmentalisation of Salafi Muslims. According to Samir Amghar and Francesco Cavatorta: &quot;studies question fundamentally the theoretical and scientific relevance of the typology between quietists, politicians and revolutionaries and argue that it is crucial to refine this typology by affirming that it is no longer apt in explaining Salafism in the contemporary age... If Wiktorowicz&#x27;s categorisation has the merit of shedding light on the plural and contradictory character of a movement that is too often caricatured, it prevents us from thinking about its dynamic and evolving character. The changing reality on the ground across the Arab world and beyond demands that traditional categories be revisited.&quot;

By making a case study of Egyptian Salafis and the &quot;quietist&quot; &quot;Al-Nour&quot; party, one scholar Laurence Deschamps-Laporte, demonstrates that Wiktorowicz&#x27;s &quot;non-dynamic typology&quot; merely denotes &quot;time-bounded pragmatic political strategies&quot; rather than any solid identity. Laurence proposes re-defining the triple classification of &quot;Quietist, Activist and Jihadist&quot; into &quot;proselytizing, politico and revolutionary&quot;; and re-conceptualise these categories as &quot;temporal strategies&quot; instead of a solid spiritual identity. She further calls for a holistic approach that accounts for the &quot;fluidity, diversity, and evolution of Salafi groups&quot; and focus more on the strategic adaptation of Salafi Muslims in their respective environments rather than creedal issues. Based on his study of European Salafi movements, Samir Amghar asserts that Jihadism no longer can be classified as part of proper Salafism since, according to Amghar, both movements have diverged significantly over the course of decades and have no &quot;shared doctrinal background&quot;.

Wiktorowicz&#x27;s proposition that all self-professed Salafi groups have the same &quot;Aqidah&quot; (creed) has also been challenged. According to scholar Massimo Ramaioli: &quot;Salafis do not vary, as Wiktorowicz claimed, only at the level of reading social reality and its attendant socio-political manifestations (their &quot;manhaj&quot;), while retaining sameness and coherence at the theoretical level. From a philosophy of praxis perspective, we can account for the variations of aqīdah&quot; that we witness. On issues such as &quot;imān&quot; (faith), &quot;kufr&quot; (unbelief) and &quot;takfīr&quot; (excommunication), &quot;al-wala&#x27; wa al-bara, and of course violence and &quot;jihād&quot;, Salafis clearly do not hold the same views precisely because they read social reality, and consequently behave, so differently... Negotiating the constraints and opportunities of the political prods Salafis to engage in thorough and at times painful ideological (re)positioning... the political affects Salafism on both levels: ideational and methodological/practical.&quot;

==Regional groups and movements==

===Saudi Arabia===
Modern Salafists consider the 18th-century scholar Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab and many of his students to have been Salafis. He started a reform movement in the remote, sparsely populated region of Najd. He invited people to &quot;Tawhid&quot; (monotheism) and advocated the purging of animist rituals and practices associated with shrine and tomb veneration, which were widespread among the nomadic tribes of Najd. Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab considered such practices as aspects of idolatry, representative of impurities and inappropriate innovations in Islam which contradicted &quot;Tawhid&quot;. While Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab stressed on the importance of obedience to &quot;sharia&quot;, he also obliged Muslims to uphold &quot;sharia&quot; by reading and following the Scriptures. Like their paragon scholar Ibn Taymiyya, Wahhabis did not believe in blind-adherence (&quot;Taqlid&quot;) and advocated engaging with the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Hadith&quot; through &quot;Ijtihad&quot; (legal reasoning), emphasizing simplicity in religious rituals and practices. Thus, classical-era legal works by &quot;Fuqaha&quot; were not considered as authoritative as the Scriptures themselves, since the former were human interpretations while the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; is the Universal, Eternal Word of God.

The Salafi movement in Saudi Arabia is the result of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s reform movement. Unlike other reform movements, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab and his disciples were also able to secure a religio-political pact with Muhammad Ibn Saud and his House; which enabled them to engage in military expansionism and establish an Islamic state in the Arabian Peninsula. While the mainstream constituency believed in Islamic revival through education and welfare reforms, the militant elements of the movement advocated armed campaigns to eradicate local practices considered as innovation and demolished numerous shrines and tombs of saints (&quot;awliya&quot;). It is believed that the Wahhabism is a more strict, Saudi form of Salafism, according to Mark Durie, who states that Saudi leaders &quot;are active and diligent&quot; using their considerable financial resources &quot;in funding and promoting Salafism all around the world&quot;. Ahmad Moussalli tends to agree with the view that Wahhabism is a subset of Salafism, saying &quot;As a rule, all Wahhabis are salafists, but not all salafists are Wahhabis&quot;.

However, many scholars and critics distinguish between the old form of Saudi Salafism (termed as Wahhabism) and the new Salafism in Saudi Arabia. Stéphane Lacroix, a fellow and lecturer at Sciences Po in Paris, also affirmed a distinction between the two: &quot;As opposed to Wahhabism, Salafism refers [...] to all the hybridations that have taken place since the 1960s between the teachings of Muhammad bin &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab and other Islamic schools of thought&quot;. Hamid Algar and Khaled Abou El Fadl believe, during the 1960s and 70s, Wahhabism rebranded itself as Salafism knowing it could not &quot;spread in the modern Muslim world&quot; as Wahhabism.

Its largesse funded an estimated &quot;90% of the expenses of the entire faith&quot;, throughout the Muslim World, according to journalist Dawood al-Shirian. It extended to young and old, from children&#x27;s madrasas to high-level scholarship. &quot;Books, scholarships, fellowships, mosques&quot; (for example, &quot;more than 1,500 mosques were built from Saudi public funds over the last 50 years&quot;) were paid for. It rewarded journalists and academics, who followed it and built satellite campuses around Egypt for Al Azhar, the oldest and most influential Islamic university. Yahya Birt counts spending on &quot;1,500 mosques, 210 Islamic centres and dozens of Muslim academies and schools&quot; at a cost of around $2–3bn annually since 1975. To put the number into perspective, the propaganda budget of the Soviet Union was about $1bn per annum.

This spending has done much to overwhelm less strict local interpretations of Islam, according to observers like Dawood al-Shirian and Lee Kuan Yew, and has caused the Saudi interpretation (sometimes called &quot;petro-Islam&quot;) to be perceived as the correct interpretation – or the &quot;gold standard&quot; of Islam – in many Muslims&#x27; minds.

Salafis are sometimes labelled &quot;Wahhabis&quot;, often in a derogatory manner by their sectarian opponents. Some Western critics often conflate Wahhabis and Salafis, although numerous Western academics have challenged such depictions. While Wahhabism is viewed as a Salafist movement in Arabian Peninsula that took inspiration from Muhammad ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab and his successors in the Aal al-Shaykh, the broader Salafist movement have deeper roots across the Muslim World. Often times, other Salafis oppose the stance of Gulf-based Wahhabis on various issues and engage in a variety of political activities.

===Indian subcontinent===

In Indian subcontinent, a number of Salafi streams exist including Ahl i Hadith and Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen.
&quot;Ahl-i Hadith&quot; is a religious movement that emerged in Northern India in the mid-nineteenth century. Adherents of Ahl-i-Hadith regard the Quran, sunnah, and hadith as the sole sources of religious authority and oppose everything introduced in Islam after the earliest times. In particular, they reject &quot;taqlid&quot; (following legal precedent) and favor &quot;ijtihad&quot; (independent legal reasoning) based on the scriptures. The movement&#x27;s followers call themselves Salafi, while others refer to them as Wahhabi, or consider them a variation on the Wahhabi movement. In recent decades the movement has expanded its presence in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan.

Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (1703–1762) is considered as the intellectual forefather of the movement and its followers regard him as &quot;Shaykh al-Islam&quot;. Waliullah &#x27;s rejection of &quot;Taqlid&quot; would be emphasized by his son Shah Abdul Aziz (1746–1824) and later successors like Shah Ismail (1779–1831) in a puritanical manner; stripping it of their eclectic and rational aspects. This tendency culminated in the Jihad movement of Sayyid Ahmad Barelvi (1786–1831). This iconoclastic movement expanded Shah Waliullah&#x27;s rejection of &quot;Taqlid&quot; as a fundamental creedal doctrine. They focused on waging physical Jihad against non-Muslims and banishing syncretic rituals prevalent amongst Muslims. Although the Indian &quot;Mujahidin&quot; movement led by Sayyid Ahmad shared close parallels with the Arabian Wahhabi movement and hence labelled as &quot;Wahhabi&quot; by the British; both movements mostly evolved independently. After the death of Sayyid Ahmad in 1831; his successors Wilayat ali, Inayat Ali, Muhammad Hussain, and Farhat Hussain continued Jihad activities of the &quot;Wahhabi&quot; movement throughout British India; spreading across Chittagong to Peshawar and from Madras to Kashmir. They played an important role in the Rebellion of 1857 and their anti-British Jihad has been described as &quot;the most strident challenge&quot; faced by the British during the 1850s. After the defeat of the revolt, the British would fully crush the &quot;Mujahidin&quot; through a series of expeditions, &quot;Wahhabi&quot; trials and sedition laws. By 1883, the movement was fully suppressed and no longer posed any political threat. Many adherents of the movement abandoned physical Jihad and opted for political quietism. The Ahl-i-Hadith movement emerged from these circles of religious activists.

In 19th century British India, the revivalist Ahl-i Hadith movement had descended as a direct outgrowth and quietist manifestation of the Indian &quot;Mujahidin&quot;. The early leaders of the movement were the influential hadith scholars Sayyid Nazir Hussein Dehlawi (1805–1902) and Siddiq Hasan Khan of Bhopal (1832–1890) who had direct tutelage under the lineage of Shah Waliullah and the Indian &quot;Mujahidin&quot; movement. Syed Nazeer Hussein was a student of Shah Muhammad Ishaq, the grandson of Shah Waliullah, and held the title &quot;&quot;Miyan Sahib&quot;&quot;, which was strongly associated with the spiritual heirs of Shah Waliullah. Siddiq Hasan Khan was a student of Sadar al-Din Khan (1789–1868) who inturn, had studied under Shah &#x27;Abd al-Azeez and Shah &#x27;Abd al-Qadir, the sons of Shah Waliullah. His father was also a direct disciple of Shah &#x27;Abd al Aziz. Yemeni scholars were also active in the Bhopal court of Siddiq Hasan Khan and he became a student of Muhaddith &#x27;Abd al-Haqq of Benarus, who was a disciple of Shawkani in Yemen. He became profoundly influenced by the works Al-Shawkani; claiming frequent contacts with him via visions and in this way, an &quot;ijaza&quot; (permission) to transmit his works. Thus, the Ahl-i Hadith movement drew directly from the teachings of Shah Waliullah and Al-Shawkani; advocating rejection of &quot;Taqlid&quot; and revival of hadith. However, they departed from Shah Waliullah&#x27;s conciliatory approach to classical legal theory; aligning themselves with &quot;Zahirite&quot; (literalist) school and adopted a literalist hadith approach. They also rejected the authority of the four legal schools and restrict &quot;Ijma&quot; (consensus) to the companions. Their ideal was to lead a pious and ethical life in conformity to the Prophetic example in every aspect of life.

Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen (KNM) was founded in 1950 in Kerala as a popular reform movement by the Kerala Jamiyat al Ulama (KJU). It traces its root to Kerala Aikya Sangam established in 1922 by Vakkom Moulavi. KNM witnessed a number of splits since 2002 and all existing fractions maintain a good connection with Arab Salafi groups especially in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

Folk Islam and Sufism, popular amongst the poor and working classes in the region, are anathema to Ahl-i Hadith beliefs and practices. This attitude towards Sufism has brought the movement into conflict with the rival Barelvi movement even more so than the Barelvis&#x27; rivals, the Deobandis. Ahl-i Hadith followers identify with the Zahiri madhhab. The movement draws both inspiration and financial support from Saudi Arabia. Jamia Salafia is their largest institution in India.

===Egypt===
The Egyptian Salafi movement is one of the most influential branches of the Salafi movement which profoundly impacted religious currents across the Arab world, including the scholars of Saudi Arabia. Salafis in Egypt are not united under a single banner or unified leadership. The main Salafi trends in Egypt are Al-Sunna Al-Muhammadeyya Society, The Salafist Calling, al-Madkhaliyya Salafism, Activist Salafism, and al-Gam&#x27;eyya Al-Shar&#x27;eyya. Salafi-Wahhabi doctrines were introduced in Egypt by the Syrian scholar Muhammad Rashid Riḍā starting from the 1920s. Rashid Riḍā opposed the Westernising cultural trends adopted by Egyptian liberal elite and denounced nationalist ideas as a plot to undermine Islamic unity. Riḍā and his disciples campaigned for the establishment of an Islamic state based on Salafi principles; thus becoming the biggest adversary of the Egyptian secularists and nationalists.

====&quot;Al-Sunna Al-Muhammadeyya&quot; Society====
&quot;Al-Sunna Al-Muhammadeyya Society&quot;, also known as &quot;Ansar Al-Sunna&quot;, was founded in 1926 by Sheikh Mohamed Hamed El-Fiqi, a 1916 graduate of Al-Azhar and a student of the famed Muslim reformer
Muhammed Abduh. It is considered the main Salafi group in Egypt. El-Fiqi&#x27;s ideas were resentful of Sufism. But unlike Muhammed Abduh, Ansar Al-Sunna follows the &quot;Tawhid&quot; as preached by Ibn Taymiyya. Many Saudi scholars became disciples of prominent &quot;ulema&quot; of &quot;Ansar al Sunna&quot; like ʿAbd al-Razzaq ʿAfifi and Muhammad Khalil Harras.

Majority of Egyptian Salafis are affiliated to &quot;Ansar al-Sunna al-Muhammadiyya&quot;. Established by Muhammad Hamid al-Fiqqi (a student of Salafi scholar Rashid Rida) to defend traditionalist Salafism, the movement shares a warm relationship with Arabian Wahhabi scholars and was a major benefactor of Salafi resurgence since the 1970s. The movement traces its initial Wahhabi contacts to Rashid Rida. Al-Azhar shares a close relation with Ansar al-Sunna. Most of the early leaders of &quot;Ansar al-Sunna&quot; were Azhari graduates and many of its contemporary scholars studied under Al-Azhar. Prominent scholars in the movement include Rashid Rida, Muhammad Hamid al-Fiqqi, Abd al-Razzaq &#x27;Afifi, Sayyid Sabiq, Muhammad Khalil Harass, etc.

====Salafist Call (&quot;al-daʿwa al-salafiyya&quot;)====
Salafist Call (&quot;al-daʿwa al-salafiyya&quot;) is another influential Salafist organisation. It is the outcome of student activism during the 1970s. While many of the activists joined the Muslim Brotherhood, a faction led by Mohammad Ismail al-Muqaddim, influenced by Salafists of Saudi Arabia established the Salafist Calling between 1972 and 1977. Salafist call is the most popular and localised of the Salafi organisations in Egypt. Due to it being an indigenous mass movement with strong political stances on various issues, it doesn&#x27;t enjoy good relationship with Saudi Arabia. Emphasising its Egyptian heritage more robustly than &quot;Ansar al-Sunna&quot;, &quot;Da&#x27;wa Salafiyya&quot; traces its history through the persecution and imprisonment of Ibn Taymiyya in Egypt, to the trials faced by the &quot;Muwahhidun&quot; movement in Arabia and then finally to scholars like Sayyid Rashid Rida, Muhibb al-Din al-Khatib, etc. who popularised Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s thought during the early twentieth century Egypt. Unlike &quot;Ansar al-Sunna&quot; which preaches political quietism, Salafist call is a politically activist movement.

====The Al-Nour Party====
The Al-Nour Party was created by Salafist Call after the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. It has an ultra-conservative Islamist ideology, which believes in implementing strict Sharia law. In the 2011–12 Egypt parliamentary elections, the Islamist Bloc led by Al‑Nour party received 7,534,266 votes out of a total 27,065,135 correct votes (28%). The Islamist Bloc gained 127 of the 498 parliamentary seats contested, second-place after the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s Freedom and Justice Party. Al‑Nour Party itself won 111 of the 127 seats. From January 2013 onward, the party gradually distanced itself from Mohamed Morsi&#x27;s Brotherhood regime, and was involved in the large-scale protests in late June against Morsi&#x27;s rule that subsequently led to a military coup removing him from office in July that year. A lawsuit against the party was dismissed on 22 September 2014 because the court indicated it had no jurisdiction. A case on the dissolution of the party was adjourned until 17 January 2015. Another court case that was brought forth to dissolve the party was dismissed after the Alexandria Urgent Matters Court ruled on 26 November 2014 that it lacked jurisdiction.

According to Ammar Ali Hassan of &quot;Al-Ahram&quot;, while Salafis and the Muslim Brotherhood agree on many issues such as the need to &quot;Islamize&quot; society and legally requiring all Muslims to give alms, the former has nevertheless rejected the flexibility of the latter on the issue of whether women and Christians should be entitled to serve in high office, as well as its relatively tolerant attitude towards Iran.

===Malaysia===
In 1980, Prince Mohammed bin Faisal Al Saud of Saudi Arabia offered Malaysia $100 million for an interest-free finance corporation, and two years later the Saudis helped finance the government-sponsored Bank Islam Malaysia. In 2017 it was reported that Salafi doctrines are spreading among Malaysia&#x27;s elite, and the traditional Islamic theology currently taught in Government schools is shifted to a Salafi view of theology derived from the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia. The Saudi-backed Salafist wave in Malaysia has particularly manifested itself in the growing trends of anti-Shi&#x27;a Muslim rhetoric and the encroaching Arabization of Malay culture.

===Yemen===
Islamic scholar Muhammad Ibn &#x27;Ali ash-Shawkani (1759–1839 C.E) is regarded as their intellectual precursor by the Salafis in Yemen, upholding his works to promote Salafi revivalist ideas. Beyond Yemen, his works are widely used in Salafi schools. He also profoundly influenced other Salafi movements across the world such as the &quot;Ahl-i Hadith&quot; in the Indian subcontinent.

===Tunisia===
Salafi movement in Tunisia was labeled as &quot;ultra-conservative&quot; by Philip Nalyor, in the context of Tunisia after the 2011 revolution.

===Turkey===
Turkey has been largely absent from the growing literature on the phenomenon of transnational Salafism. Salafism is a minority strand of Turkish Islam that evolved in the context of the state&#x27;s effort in the 1980s to recalibrate religion as a complement to Turkish nationalism. Although Salafism became a topic of discussion in media and scholarly writing in Turkish religious studies faculties, a continued lack of orthographic stability (variously, Selfye, Selefiyye, Selfyyecilik, Selefizm)&quot; gives an indication both of the denial of its relevance to Turkey and the success of republican secularism in clearing religion from public discourse. Yet since the 1980s Salafi preachers trained in Saudi Arabia have been able to find a niche through publishing houses that have endeavoured to translate Arabic texts from the Saudi Salafi scene in an attempt to change the discursive landscape of Turkish Islam. In 1999, the Turkish Directorate of Religious Affairs &quot;Diyanet&quot;, recognized Salafism as a Sunni school of thought. Salafist preachers then started to make inroads into the Turkish society. With the implication of Turkish citizens and the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government in Syrian civil war, public discussion began to question the narrative of Salafism as a phenomenon alien to Turkey. Salafism becomes an observable element of religious discourse in Turkey in the context of the military regime&#x27;s attempt to outmanoeuvre movements emerging as a challenge to the Kemalist secular order, namely the left, Necmettin Erbakan&#x27;s Islamism, Kurdish nationalism, and Iran. Through the Turkish—Islamic Synthesis (Turk islam Sentezi), the scientific positivism that had been the guiding principle of the republic since 1923 was modified to make room for Islam as a central element of Turkish national culture. The military authorities oversaw an increase of more than 50 percent in the budget of the religious affairs administration (known as Diyanet), expanding it from 50,000 employees in 1979 to 85,000 in 1989. Pursuing closer ties with Saudi Arabia, Turkey involved itself in a more meaningful manner in the pan-Islamic institutions under Saudi tutelage, and Diyanet received Muslim World League funding to send officials to Europe to develop outreach activities in Turkish immigrant communities.&quot; A network of commercial and cultural links was established with Saudi businesses and institutions in banking and financial services, publishing houses, newspapers, magazines, and children&#x27;s books.

Preachers who had studied at the Islamic University of Madinah, and applied the Salafi designation, also established publishing houses and charity organizations (dernek), the most prominent example is Iraqi-Turkish descent Salafi scholar and preacher Abdullah Yolcu, who preaches under the banner of Guraba publishing house. Subject to periodic harassment and arrest by security forces, they adopted markedly more public profiles with AKP ascendancy over the military following a resounding electoral victory in 2002. The Turkish Salafis became active on YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, complementing websites for their publishing enterprises. Saudi-based scholars such as Bin Baz, al-Albani, Saleh Al-Fawzan (b. 1933), and Muhammad ibn al-Uthaymeen (1925-2001) form the core of their references, while they avoid contemporary &#x27;ulama&#x27; associated with the Muslim Brotherhood such as Yusuf al-Qaradawi (b. 1926), an Egyptian scholar based in Qatar. Turkish is their prime language of communication, but Arabic is prominent in special sections on websites, Arabic-language Salafi texts in their bookshops, and heavy use of Arabic terminology in their Turkish texts. The most well-established among them is Ablullah Yolcu, who is said to do &quot;production of Turkish Salafism from Arabic texts&quot;. While Turkey has been outside the discussion on transnational Salafism, Meijer&#x27;s observation that Salafism may succeed `when its quietist current can find a niche or the nationalist movement has failed&#x27; seems to speak surprisingly well to the Turkish case.&quot;

===China===
Salafism is opposed by a number of Hui Muslims Sects in China such as by the Gedimu, Sufi Khafiya and Jahriyya, to the extent that even the fundamentalist Yihewani (Ikhwan) Chinese sect, founded by Ma Wanfu after Salafi inspiration, condemned Ma Debao and Ma Zhengqing as heretics when they attempted to introduce Salafism as the main form of Islam. Ma Debao established a Salafi school, called the Sailaifengye (Salafi), in Lanzhou and Linxia. It is completely separate from other Muslim sects in China.

The number of Salafis in China are not included on percentage lists of Muslim sects in China. The Kuomintang Sufi Muslim General Ma Bufang, who backed the Yihewani (Ikhwan) Muslims, persecuted the Salafis and forced them into hiding. They were not allowed to move or worship openly. The Yihewani had become secular and Chinese nationalists; they considered the Salafiyya to be &quot;heterodox&quot; (&quot;xie jiao&quot;) and people who followed foreigners&#x27; teachings (&quot;waidao&quot;). After the Communists took power, Salafis were allowed to worship openly again.

===Vietnam===
An attempt at Salafist expansion among the Muslim Chams in Vietnam has been halted by Vietnamese government controls, however, the loss of the Salafis among Chams has been to be benefit of Tablighi Jamaat.

=== Qatar ===
Similar to Saudi Arabia, most citizens of Qatar adhere to a strict sect of Salafism referred to as Wahhabism. The national mosque of Qatar is the Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab Mosque named after the founder of Wahhabism. Similar to Saudi Arabian sponsorship of Salafism, Qatar has also funded the construction of mosques that promote the Wahhabi Salafism.

Unlike the strict practice of Wahhabi Salafism in Saudi Arabia, Qatar has demonstrated an alternative view of Wahhabism. In Qatar, women are allowed by law to drive, non-Muslims have access to pork and liquor through a state-owned distribution center, and religious police do not force businesses to close during prayer times. Also, Qatar hosts branches of several American universities and a &quot;Church City&quot; in which migrant workers may practice their religion. The adoption of a more liberal interpretation of Wahhabism is largely credited to Qatar&#x27;s young Emir, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.

Yet, Qatar&#x27;s more tolerant interpretation of Wahhabism compared to Saudi Arabia has drawn backlash from Qatari citizens and foreigners. The Economist reported that a Qatari cleric criticized the state&#x27;s acceptance of un-Islamic practices away from the public sphere and complained that Qatari citizens are oppressed. Although Qatari gender separation is less strict than that found in Saudi Arabia, plans to offer co-ed lectures were put aside after threats to boycott Qatar&#x27;s segregated public university. Meanwhile, there have been reports of local discontent with the sale of alcohol in Qatar.

Qatar has also drawn widespread criticism for attempting to spread its fundamental religious interpretation both through military and non-military channels. Militarily, Qatar has been criticized for funding rebel Islamist extremist fighters in the Libyan Crisis and the Syrian Civil War. In Libya, Qatar funded allies of Ansar al-Sharia, the jihadist group thought to be behind the killing of former U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens, while channeling weapons and money to the Islamist Ahrar al-Sham group in Syria. In addition, Qatar-based charities and online campaigns, such as Eid Charity and Madid Ahl al-Sham, have a history of financing terrorist groups in Syria. Qatar has also repeatedly provided financial support to the Gaza government led by the militant Hamas organisation while senior Hamas officials have visited Doha and hosted Qatari leaders in Gaza. Qatar also gave approximately $10 billion to the government of Egypt during Mohamed Morsi&#x27;s time in office.

Non-militarily, Qatar state-funded broadcaster Al Jazeera has come under criticism for selective reporting in coordination with Qatar&#x27;s foreign policy objectives. The nearby Persian Gulf States of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates have been among the countries that have condemned Qatar&#x27;s actions. In 2014, the three Persian Gulf countries withdrew their ambassadors from Qatar referencing Qatar&#x27;s failure to commit to non-interference in the affairs of other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Saudi Arabia has also threatened to block land and sea borders with Qatar.
This blockade came to an end on 5 January 2021, when authorities from both Saudi and Qatar came on common grounds, with the midmanship of Kuwait.

==Statistics==
It is often reported from various sources, including Germany&#x27;s federal intelligence agency, that Salafism is the fastest-growing Islamic movement in the world. The &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movement has also gained popular acceptance as a &quot;respected Sunni tradition&quot; in Turkey starting from the 1980s, when the Turkish government forged closer ties to Saudi Arabia. This paved the way for cooperation between the Salafi Muslim World League and the Turkish Diyanet, which recognised Salafism as a traditional Sunni theological school, thus introducing Salafi teachings to Turkish society. Globally, Salafisation of Islamic religious discourse occurred simultaneously alongside the rise of pan-Islamist Movements, with an emphasis on the concept of &quot;Tawhid&quot;.
==Other usage==

=== &quot;Al-Salafiyya Al-Tanwiriyya&quot; (Enlightened Salafism) ===

As opposed to the traditionalist Salafism discussed throughout this article, some Western academics and historians have used the term &quot;Salafism&quot; to denote modernists, &quot;a school of thought which surfaced in the second half of the 19th century as a reaction to the spread of European ideas&quot; and &quot;sought to expose the roots of modernity within Muslim civilization&quot;. They are also known as &quot;Modernist Salafis&quot;. This trend, which was also known as &quot;Al-Salafiyya Al-Tanwiriyya&quot; (Enlightened Salafism) was represented by the Islamic scholars Jamal al-Din Afghani (1839–1897 C.E/ 1255–1314 A.H) and Muhammad &#x27;Abduh (1849–1905 C.E/ 1265–1323 A.H ); whose writings had distinct Mu&#x27;tazilite and Sufi mystical inclinations opposed by Salafism.

The origins of contemporary Salafism in the modernist &quot;Salafi Movement&quot; of Jamal al-Din al-Afghani and Muhammad Abduh is noted by some, while others say Islamic Modernism only influenced contemporary Salafism. However, the former notion has been rejected by majority. According to Quintan Wiktorowicz:

The second stage of Arab Salafiyya movement emerged after the First World War and was championed by the Syrian-Egyptian Islamic scholar Muhammad Rashid Rida (d. 1935), who called for a purist return to the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and the &quot;Sunnah&quot;. These Salafis favoured a literalist understanding of scriptures rather than the allegorical readings of Afghani and ʿAbduh, and were characterised by a deep resistance and hostility to Western imperialism and Western ideologies. Rida&#x27;s &quot;Salafiyya&quot; also championed pan-Islamist fraternity encompassing &quot;Ahl-i Hadith&quot; in South Asia to the Arabian Wahhabis; and clashed with nationalist and secular trends throughout the Islamic World. These themes would be re-inforced and popularised by a number of similar-minded Islamic revivalists like Hassan al-Banna (1906-1949 C.E/1324-1368 A.H) in Egypt and other Islamic fundamentalists like Abul A&#x27;la Mawdudi (1903-1979 C.E/1321-1399 A.H) in India.

Groups like Muslim Brotherhood, Jamaat-e-Islami etc. are inspired by Salafism as well as the modernist movement. Muslim Brotherhood include the term &quot;salafi&quot; in the &quot;About Us&quot; section of its website.

====Influence on contemporary Salafism====
In terms of their respective formation, Wahhabism and Salafism are quite distinct. Wahhabism was a pared-down Islam that rejected modern influences, while Salafism sought to reconcile Islam with modernism. What they had in common is that both rejected traditional teachings on Islam in favor of direct, &#x27;fundamentalist&#x27; reinterpretation. Although Salafism and Wahhabism began as two distinct movements, Faisal&#x27;s embrace of Salafi (Muslim Brotherhood) pan-Islamism resulted in cross-pollination between ibn Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s teachings on &quot;Tawhid&quot;, &quot;Shirk&quot; and &quot;bid&#x27;ah&quot; and Salafi interpretations of ahadith (the sayings of Muhammad). Some Salafis nominated ibn Abd al-Wahhab as one of the Salaf (retrospectively bringing Wahhabism into the fold of Salafism), and the &quot;Muwahidun&quot; began calling themselves Salafis.

===In the broadest sense===
In a broad sense, Salafism is similar to Non-denominational Islam (NDM), in the sense some of its adherents do not follow a particular creed. Salafi (follower of Salaf) means any reform movement that calls for resurrection of Islam by going back to its origin. In line with Wahhabism they promote a literal understanding of the sacred texts of Islam and reject other more liberal reformist movements such as those inspired for example by Muhammad Abduh or by Muhammad Iqbal.

==Criticisms==
===Criticism===
Due to its approach of rejecting &quot;taqlid&quot;, Salafiyya school is considered as deviant by certain &quot;ulema&quot; (clerics) of the Ash&#x27;arite and Maturidite schools, who portray themselves as the Sunni Islamic orthodoxy and believe &quot;Taqlid&quot; of the four madhabs to be &quot;wajib&quot; (obligatory) for the matter of &quot;Fiqh&quot; (Islamic jurisprudence). Some of these scholars also accuse Salafis of falling into certain forms of unapparent &quot;tajsim&quot; and &quot;tashbih&quot; in &quot;&#x27;Aqidah&quot; which they consider as deviation from orthodox Sunni doctrines, while clarifying that this deviancy does not expel them from the fold of Islam.

Some scholars of the Al-Azhar University of Cairo produced a work of religious opinions entitled &quot;al-Radd&quot; (The Response) to refute various views of the Salafi movement. &quot;Al-Radd&quot; singles out numerous Salafi aberrations – in terms of ritual prayer alone it targets for criticism the following Salafi claims:
* The claim that it is prohibited to recite God&#x27;s name during the minor ablution [Fatwa 50];
* The claim that it is obligatory for men and women to perform the major ablution on Friday [Fatwa 63];
* The claim that it is prohibited to own a dog for reasons other than hunting [Fatwa 134];
* The claim that it is prohibited to use alcohol for perfumes [Fatwa 85].
One of the authors of &quot;al-Radd&quot;, the Professor of Law Anas Abu Shady states that, &quot;they [the Salafis] want to be everything to everyone. They&#x27;re interested not only in the evident (al-zahir), although most of their law goes back to the &quot;Muhalla&quot; [of the Ẓāhirī scholar Ibn Hazm], but they also are convinced that they alone understand the hidden (al-batin)!&quot;

Sunni critics of Salafism accuse Salafis of altering the actual teachings of Ahmad ibn Hanbal and that of the other eponyms of the four Sunni legal schools. The term &quot;Wahhabi&quot; is sometimes used by opponents of the movement in a sectarian manner to label Salafi Muslims. The Syrian Ash&#x27;arite scholar Mohamed Said Ramadan Al-Bouti wrote a number of works refuting Salafism including &quot;Al-La Madhhabiyya (Abandoning the Madhhabs) is the most dangerous Bid&#x27;ah Threatening the Islamic Shari&#x27;a (Damascus: Dar al-Farabi 2010)&quot; and &quot;Al-Salafiyya&quot; &quot;was a blessed epoch, not a school of thought (Damascus: Dar al-Fikr, 1990).&quot; The latter is perhaps the most widespread refutation of Salafism in the twentieth century.

Numerous academic rebuttals of Salafism have been produced in the English language by modernists such as Khaled Abou El Fadl of the UCLA School of Law, and by Sufi intellectuals like Timothy Winter of Cambridge University and G.F. Haddad. According to El Fadl, Islamist militant groups such as Al-Qaeda &quot;derive their theological premises from the intolerant Puritanism of the Wahhabi and Salafi creeds&quot;. He claimed that the intolerance and alleged endorsement of terrorism manifest in the fringe elements of Wahhabism and Salafism was due to a deviation from Muslim historical traditions. El-Fadl also argued that the Salafi methodology &quot;drifted into stifling apologetics&quot; by the 1960s, marked by &quot;anxiety&quot; to &quot;render Islam compatible with modernity&quot;. These apologetic efforts sought the defense of Islamic traditions from the onslaught of Westernization; while simultaneously maintaining the supremacy of Islam and its compatibility with modernity. However, according to El Fadl, such efforts were being increasingly tainted by political opportunism and an unwillingness for critical engagement with the Islamic traditions.

The Saudi government was criticised by Jerome Taylor in the British tabloid &quot;The Independent&quot;, for its role in the destruction of early Islamic heritage sites in Arabia. There has been controversies over the recent expansionist projects in Mecca and Medina that destroyed historically important Islamic heritage sites to make way for &quot;skyscrapers, shopping malls and luxury hotels&quot;. The actions of the Saudi government stirred controversy across the Muslim world and Islamic activists across all sects, including Salafis, Sufis, Shias, etc. ;condemned the actions of the Saudi government.

Abu Ammaar Yasir Qadhi, an American Islamic cleric and former Salafi, has critiqued what he perceived as the hostility of the movement against non-Salafi Muslims, as well as its lack of intellectualism. While noting his own belief that the of following the generations of the &quot;Salaf&quot; is &quot;a fundamental part&quot; of Islamic faith, he has stated his disagreement with the methodological approach of Salafism.

=== Western criticism ===
In 2012, German government officials alleged that Salafi Muslims in Germany had links to various Islamist militant groups but later clarified that it does not consider all Salafis are terrorists. The statements by German government officials criticizing Salafism were televised by &quot;Deutsche Welle&quot; during April 2012.
According to the German political scientist Thorsten Gerald Schneiders, despite the Salafi claims to re-establish Islamic values and defend Islamic culture, some members of the movement interpret it in a manner which does not match with Islamic traditions and regard certain elements of Muslim culture such as poetry, literature, singing, philosophy, etc. as works of the devil. According to the French political scientist Olivier Roy, most of the third generation Western Muslim immigrants tend to adopt Salafism and some of them may break off from their family heritage, marrying other converts, rather than a bride from their country of origin, chosen by their parents. According to ex-CIA officer Marc Sageman, sections of the Salafi movement are linked to some Jihadist groups around the world, like Al-Qaeda.

However, according to other analysts, Salafis are not inherently political. Salafis may exhibit all sorts of diverse relations with the state depending on the environment, like the general populations to which they belong. They exhibit no demonstrable proclivity toward violence as a monolithic group. Those Salafis who engage in political participation or armed insurgencies, do so as part of a wider umbrella of political projects. Historian Roel Meijer has asserted that attempts to associate Salafi Muslims with violence by certain Western critics stem from the literature related to the state-sponsored &quot;security studies&quot; conducted by various Western governments during the early 2000s, as well as from Orientalist depictions that attempted to link Islamic revivalists with violence during the colonial era.

<text>Lester Dent (October 12, 1904 – March 11, 1959) was an American pulp-fiction writer, best known as the creator and main writer of the series of novels about the scientist and adventurer Doc Savage. The 159 Doc Savage novels that Dent wrote over 16 years were credited to the house name Kenneth Robeson.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Dent was born in 1904 in La Plata, Missouri. He was the only child of Bernard Dent, a rancher, and Alice Norfolk, a teacher before her marriage. The Dents had been living in Wyoming for some time, but had returned to La Plata so that Mrs. Dent could be with her family during the birth. The Dents returned to Wyoming in 1906, where they worked a ranch near Pumpkin Buttes, Wyoming.

Dent&#x27;s early years were spent in the lonely hills of Wyoming. He attended a local one-room school house, often paying for tuition with furs that he had caught. He had few companions or friends; this early loneliness may have helped develop his talents as a story-teller.

Around 1919, the Dent family returned to La Plata for good, where Dent&#x27;s father took up dairy farming. Dent completed his elementary and secondary education there.

In 1923, Dent enrolled at Chillicothe Business College in Chillicothe, Missouri. His original goal was to become a banker. However, while standing in the application line, he began talking to a fellow applicant about career options. He found out that the starting salary for a telegraph operator was $20 a week more than a bank clerk, so he changed his major to telegraphy. After completing the course, he taught at CBC for a short time.

In 1924, Dent became a telegraph operator for Western Union in Carrollton, Missouri. In 1925, he moved to Ponca City, Oklahoma, to work as a telegrapher for Empire Oil and Gas Company. It was in Ponca City that he met his future wife, Norma Gerling. They were married on August 9, 1925.

===Writing career===

In 1926, the Dents moved to Chickasha, Oklahoma, where Dent worked as a telegrapher for the Associated Press. One of Dent&#x27;s co-workers had published a story in a pulp magazine, earning the huge sum (for that time) of $450. Dent, a voracious reader, was very familiar with pulp magazines of the day, and was sure he could write at least as well, if not better. He took advantage of the slow time during the graveyard shift to write. His first professional sale was an action-adventure story entitled &quot;Pirate Cay&quot;; it appeared in the September 1929 issue of &quot;Top Notch&quot; magazine.

Shortly after the publication of his story, Dent was contacted by Dell Publishing in New York City. They were willing to offer him $500 a month if he would write exclusively for their magazines. Dent, stunned by the good fortune, took some time considering the offer, but eventually accepted. The Dents relocated to New York, arriving January 1, 1931. Dent quickly learned the trade of the pulp writer, teaching himself how to write quickly and with few rewrites. After Dell ended its pulp line in May 1931, Dent retreated to Missouri to regroup. Soon, he was back in New York, writing for the other pulp chains.

In 1932, Henry Ralston of Street and Smith Publications contacted Dent with a proposition for a new magazine. Ralston had scored a great success with &quot;The Shadow&quot; magazine, and was interested in developing a second title around a central character. He had in mind an adventure hero, which appealed to Dent&#x27;s love of that genre. While Dent was unhappy to later discover that his stories would be published under a house name (Kenneth Robeson), he was happy to receive $500 per novel (which would later increase to $750), and accepted Ralston&#x27;s offer.

Issue Number 1 of &quot;Doc Savage&quot; magazine hit the stands in February 1933; within 6 months it was one of the top selling pulp magazines on the market. Much of the success stemmed from Dent&#x27;s fantastic imagination, fueled by his own personal curiosity. Dent was able to use the freedom that his new-found financial security allowed him, to learn and to explore. In addition to being a wide-ranging reader, Dent also took courses in technology and the trades. He earned both his amateur radio and pilot license, passed both the electricians&#x27; and plumbers&#x27; trade exams, and was an avid mountain climber. His usual method was to learn a subject thoroughly, then move on to another. An example is boating: in May 1934, Dent bought a 40-foot two-masted Chesapeake Bay &quot;bugeye&quot; schooner, &quot;Albatross&quot;. He and his wife lived on it for several years, sailing it up and down the eastern seaboard and even doing some sunken-treasure hunting in the Caribbean, then sold it in 1940.

The Dents traveled extensively as well, enough to earn Lester a membership in the Explorers Club. He was sponsored by fellow pulp writer J. Allan Dunn and Navy Reserve Captain Charles Richardson Pond (1889–1969), a member of the family that owned Pond&#x27;s Cosmetics and a pioneer of transoceanic flight. He was elected to membership on November 9, 1936, but was apparently not all that involved in the Club beyond bouncing story ideas off more experienced members. He contributed to a year-long one-time fundraiser for the Club conducted throughout the year 1939, for which he was awarded a sterling silver miniature of the coveted Explorers Club Medal, No. 89 of an unknown number of such medallions, with a chain allowing it to be worn as a bracelet. He stopped paying his annual dues in December 1945 and was dropped from membership for this delinquency in January 1948.

In 1940, the Dents returned to La Plata for good. Dent continued to write for &quot;Doc Savage&quot;, but also found time to work in the other genres. His post-1941 Doc Savage work benefited from this; the later Savage novels are known for their tighter plotting, improved dialogue, and a shift towards mystery instead of super-science. Doc Savage himself began to shed his superhuman image, and to show a more fallible, human side. Dent may have recycled some generic detective stories as Doc tales; &quot;King Joe Cay&quot; features Doc working alone, in disguise, with no aides, gadgets, or headquarters, and an interest in the ladies.

&quot;Doc Savage&quot; Magazine ceased publication in 1949. Of the 181 Doc Savage novels published by Street and Smith, 179 were credited to Kenneth Robeson; and all but twenty were written by Dent. The first novel, &quot;The Man of Bronze&quot;, used the name Kenneth Roberts, but this was changed after it was discovered that there was another writer named Kenneth Roberts. The March 1944 issue, &quot;The Derelict of Skull Shoal&quot;, was accidentally credited to Lester Dent. This was the only time during the run of the magazine that Dent&#x27;s real name was used. Following his tenure on &quot;Doc Savage&quot;, Dent found continuing success as a mystery and western writer. His last published short story was a Western entitled &quot;Savage Challenge&quot;, published in the February 22, 1958, issue of the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;. A last novel, &quot;Lady in Peril&quot;, was released as half of an Ace Double the month that Lester died.

Dent suffered a heart attack in February 1959. He was hospitalized, but subsequently died on March 11, 1959. Dent is buried in the La Plata cemetery.

The Lester and Norma Dent House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

Since his death, Lester Dent has lived on in reprints and new stories discovered and marketed by his literary agent, Will Murray. In 2009, Hardcase Crime published his noir novel, &quot;Honey in His Mouth&quot; (written 1956, previously unpublished) to rave reviews. Black Dog Books has released five volumes of The Lester Dent Library. Altus Press issued &quot;The Weird Adventures of the Blond Adder&quot; in 2010 and &quot;Hell in Boxes: The Exploits of Lynn Lash and Foster Fade&quot; in 2012.

==Appearances in fiction==
Dent is a featured character in the Paul Malmont novel &quot;The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril&quot;, which was published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 2006, and in the sequel &quot;The Astounding, the Amazing, and the Unknown&quot; also Simon &amp; Schuster in 2011. The novels describe friendship and rivalry among pulp writers of the 1930s, and also include Walter Gibson, creator of The Shadow.

Dent also appears in Craig McDonald&#x27;s Hector Lassiter novel &quot;The Running Kind&quot; (2014), which touches on Dent&#x27;s passion for ham radio and aerial photography enterprises, .

==Pulp fiction formula==
Dent&#x27;s &quot;Master Fiction Plot&quot;, often referred to as the &quot;Lester Dent Formula,&quot; is a widely circulated guide to writing a salable 6,000-word pulp story. It has been recommended to aspiring authors by Michael Moorcock, among others. Moorcock summarizes the formula by suggesting: &quot;split your six-thousand-word story up into four fifteen hundred word parts. Part one, hit your hero with a heap of trouble. Part two, double it. Part three, put him in so much trouble there&#x27;s no way he could ever possibly get out of it...All your main characters have to be in the first third. All your main themes and everything else has to be established in the first third, developed in the second third, and resolved in the last third.&quot;

<doc id="355704" wikidata="Q1064767" url="?curid=355704" title="Charles Heaphy">
<text>Charles Heaphy VC (1820 – 3 August 1881) was an English-born New Zealand explorer and recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest military award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that could be awarded to British and Empire forces at the time. He was the first soldier of the New Zealand armed forces to be awarded the VC. He was also a noted artist of the colonial period who created watercolours and sketches of early settler life in New Zealand.

Born in England, Heaphy joined the New Zealand Company in 1839. He arrived in New Zealand later that year and was commissioned to make a visual record of the company&#x27;s work which was used to advertise the country to potential English migrants. Much of the next years was spent travelling around New Zealand and executing paintings of the land and its inhabitants. When his contract with the company ended in 1842, he lived in Nelson for several years and explored large parts of the West Coast. He later moved north to Auckland to take up employment as a surveyor.

During the invasion of the Waikato, his militia unit was mobilised and it was his conduct at Paterangi, where he rescued British soldiers under fire, that saw him awarded the VC. As well as being the first soldier of the New Zealand armed forces to receive the VC, he was the first recipient from any militia force. After his military service ended, Heaphy served a term as Member of Parliament for Parnell. From 1870 to 1881, he held a variety of civil service positions. In his later years, his health declined and he retired from public service in May 1881. He moved to Queensland, in Australia, seeking a better climate in which to recover his health but died a few months after his arrival. He is buried at Toowong Cemetery in Brisbane.

==Early life==
Charles Heaphy was born sometime in 1820 in London, England. He was the youngest child of Thomas Heaphy, who was a professional painter, and three of his siblings also became noted painters. His grandfather John Gerrard Heaphy was a merchant from Ireland. Thomas Heaphy earned painting commissions from high society and in 1812 accompanied Arthur Wellesley, who was later to become the Duke of Wellington, as staff artist during the Peninsular War.

The Heaphy family lived in St John&#x27;s Wood in north-west London and enjoyed a comfortable, middle-class existence although his mother died sometime during his early childhood. Thomas died in 1835 and left the entire estate to his second wife, who he had married in 1833. Charles, who had obtained work as a draughtsman at the London &amp; Birmingham Railway Company, moved out of the family home soon after. As a child, he had been taught to paint by his father and in December 1837, sponsored by a family friend, he entered the Royal Academy school of painting. He was the only child of the Heaphy family to receive this level of education.

In May 1839, after 18 months at the Royal Academy, Heaphy joined the New Zealand Company as a draughtsman. The company was established by Edward Wakefield as a private venture to organise colonies in New Zealand. Wakefield sought well-educated men as staff for the planning and surveying of new settlements in the country. Heaphy sailed with William Wakefield, Edward&#x27;s brother, aboard the &quot;Tory&quot; on an expedition to purchase land suitable for settlement. In late 1839, the &quot;Tory&quot; arrived in what became known as Wellington.

==Service with the New Zealand Company==
A sketch by Heaphy of the Māori &quot;rangatira&quot;, [[Te Rauparaha]] 
Heaphy&#x27;s contract with the New Zealand Company was for three years and his primary role was to produce a visual record of its efforts that could be used as advertising. In doing so he travelled extensively around New Zealand and occasionally participated in overland treks, living out of a tent or staying with local Māori. He also sailed along the coastline aboard the &quot;Tory&quot; and learned surveying from its captain. Another employee of the company travelling on the &quot;Tory&quot; was Ernst Dieffenbach, who taught Heaphy basic geology.

Heaphy painted a variety of subjects including landscapes, flora and fauna and Māori people, including Te Rauparaha, the notable &quot;rangatira&quot; (chief). The success of the company depended on attracting emigrants to New Zealand so his work was almost always intended to present the land and its inhabitants in its best light. Heaphy was at times exposed to some danger; on an expedition to the Chatham Islands, his party intervened in a skirmish between two warring tribes and he was wounded in the leg. It is unlikely it was a serious wound, for a few weeks later he went on a trek back in New Zealand to the Taranaki Region, where he produced some of his more notable landscapes, including an exaggerated view of Mount Taranaki from the south.

From October 1840, Heaphy was based in Wellington. With a friend, he built a small cottage and from there executed several views of Wellington Harbour, which were much used in advertising for the New Zealand Company. One example of his work, a view of the fledgling Wellington settlement, was reproduced as a lithograph for distribution in England. As an example of how Heaphy manipulated his work for commercial appeal, this painting depicted several ships anchored in the harbour and deliberately overstated their number, to give an impression of a busy port. A few months later, in early 1841, he joined Arthur Wakefield on the expedition that led to the founding of Nelson, in the South Island. Heaphy was among several employees of the New Zealand Company to scout the area around what is now known as Tasman Bay, before the location for Nelson was decided upon. He executed several watercolours highlighting the quality of the land intended for settlement and these were forwarded to London.

The New Zealand Company regularly published Heaphy&#x27;s work as lithographs, often having extra details added when being redrawn for printing purposes. By late 1841, his services as an artist were no longer required, given the number of works that he had produced, and Wakefield decided to send him to London to make a report to the company directors. He took six months to reach London, by which time his three-year contract had expired. The directors were impressed with his report and it was published as a book entitled &quot;Narrative of a Residence in Various Parts of New Zealand&quot; and included several lithographs prepared from Heaphy&#x27;s art. Another of the Wakefield brothers, Edward Jerningham, also published a book illustrated by Heaphy; this was entitled &quot;Adventures in New Zealand&quot;.

==Life in Nelson==
Although no longer employed by the New Zealand Company, Heaphy, emboldened by the success of his report and the public reception to his paintings, sought further opportunities for similar work. From London, he wrote to the company secretary seeking support to explore the area inland of Nelson. The response was unenthusiastic; the company was concentrating on developing its settlements rather than undertaking in further exploration. Despite this, Heaphy returned to New Zealand and arrived in Nelson on 22 December 1842.

There was little in way of work opportunities for Heaphy in Nelson and he based himself in Motueka. Here he farmed land with a friend, Frederick Moore, and this took much of what little funds he had. His farming venture was hard work and not particularly successful. By late 1843, the New Zealand Company was in need of good pastoral land around Nelson. It had clashed with Māori in the Wairau Affray in the Wairau Valley to the south-east of Nelson, and several company employees, including Arthur Wakefield, another brother of Edward Wakefield, were killed. The company needed to scout the area to the south-west and Heaphy finally got the chance to explore.

Wakefield&#x27;s replacement as resident agent in Nelson for the New Zealand Company, William Fox, was a keen advocate of expansion for settlement in the area around Nelson. Fox authorised Heaphy and a surveyor to scout south-west to the Buller River in November 1843. In a subsequent expedition undertaken the following month, Heaphy and two Māori trekked to what is now known as Golden Bay, and returned to Motueka via the coast, a journey which he regarded as the most difficult he had undertaken at the time. Both expeditions failed to locate suitable land for settlement as did an expedition back to the Buller River in March 1845. Heaphy was reasonably well compensated for his exploration efforts and for additional funds, he undertook art commissions for Nelson&#x27;s more wealthy residents.

In February 1846, Heaphy, accompanied by Fox and Thomas Brunner, another employee of the New Zealand Company, as well as a Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri tohunga named Kehu, undertook another expedition to the south-west. Difficult terrain faced them; high mountain ranges topped with snow and ice, steep bush, numerous rivers and gorges. Food sources included roots and berries; birds were snared and eels caught from streams. Along the coast, shellfish and gull eggs were added to the diet. The party, each carrying a load of , trekked to the Buller River and walked its banks as far as the Maruia River. As they believed they were only from the coast, their dwindling provisions prevented them proceeding to the mouth of the Buller River. Guided by Kehu, the party traversed the Hope Saddle on their way back to Nelson, which they reached on 1 March.

Heaphy and Brunner were keen for further exploration and with Kehu, left Nelson on 17 March 1846, to scout along the West Coast to the mouth of the Buller. The expedition traced the western coast of South Island as far south as the Arahura River. Their journey began from Golden Bay and they made their way to West Wanganui where Etau, a local Māori, was hired as a porter. The local chief barred their journey south but Heaphy and Brunner mollified him with some tobacco. They continued along the coast, climbing steep cliffs and fording rivers as they went. Their movements were held up at times due to rain and high tides. At night, they sheltered in small caves, augmented with a screen of nīkau palm leaves. They crossed the Karamea River on 20 April and reached the Buller River ten days later. This had to be crossed using an old canoe that was repaired by Kehu and Etau and after crossing, they stayed at the local pā (village). In early May, they sighted the Southern Alps and at the Arahura River, the southernmost point of the expedition, they were hosted by the local Ngāi Tahu tribe at Taramakau Pā. Poor weather plagued their return along the coast but they reached Nelson on 18 August. The harsh conditions he had experienced during his travels left him disillusioned with the potential prospects for settlements along the West Coast region.

Life in Nelson remained difficult for Heaphy, who had by now lost his appetite for exploration. He eked out a living taking occasional jobs for the next six months. For much of 1847, he undertook survey work around Tasman Bay and later that year was a representative for the New Zealand Company, when the government investigated the amount of land set aside by the company for the local Māori. Work had dried up by early 1848 and when he was offered employment with the Auckland Survey Office in April 1848, he accepted.

==Life in Auckland==

Moving north to Auckland, Heaphy&#x27;s new role as the chief draughtsman for the Auckland Survey Office kept him occupied with the preparation of maps and plans. After a few years, he began to spend a greater amount of time in the field, where he carried out survey work. As he had done when living in Nelson, he supplemented his income with commissioned artworks. He also began to build on his geological knowledge, taking a particular interest in volcanology. He wrote an article on Auckland&#x27;s volcanoes for a geological journal in England and completed several paintings of volcanoes as well as thermal attractions in the Bay of Plenty, including the famous Pink and White Terraces. Hoping to raise his profile, he sent many of his works to London and some remain on display at the offices of the Geological Society.

When he was 30, Heaphy met and began courting Kate Churton, the 21-year-old daughter of a reverend. The couple were married on 30 October 1851, at St Paul&#x27;s Church in Auckland. A year later, he was appointed &quot;Commissioner of Gold Fields&quot; at Coromandel, following the recent discovery of gold. His role required him to supervise claims made by miners and negotiate land sales with local Māori. The gold rush in Coromandel soon petered out and he returned to his work at the Auckland Survey Office by mid-1853.

In November 1853, Sir George Grey ended his first term as Governor of New Zealand and sailed to the islands around New Caledonia, to indulge his interest in languages. He also wanted to investigate French claims on the islands. Heaphy accompanied him as his private secretary and took the opportunity to execute artworks of the islands he visited and their inhabitants. He gave some of his works to Grey, who took them back to England in December 1853 and donated them to the British Museum.

Heaphy and his wife moved north of Auckland to what is now known as Warkworth in early 1854, following his appointment as district surveyor for the Mahurangi Peninsula, which was being opened for settlement. For two years, Heaphy surveyed the plots of land that were to be sold to people moving to the area. In 1856 he became Auckland&#x27;s provincial surveyor following the retirement of his predecessor. He moved back to Auckland and took up residence in Parnell. Surveying kept him busy for the next few years but in early 1859, he accompanied Ferdinand von Hochstetter on an expedition south of Auckland; Hochstetter had been invited by the government to make a report on a recent coalfield discovery in the area. The two became friendly and Hochstetter was impressed with Heaphy&#x27;s bush skills, although privately did not accord him much respect for his scientific knowledge. When Hochstetter left for Europe later in the year, he took with him many examples of Heaphy&#x27;s artwork. The two later fell out, when Heaphy had an article published in a geological journal. Hochstetter felt usurped by someone he considered an inferior scholar and publicly questioned Heaphy&#x27;s credentials. He also made allegations that Heaphy had plagiarised portions of his work on the coalfield. Heaphy mounted a spirited defence and generally had the sympathy of the public. The dispute did not stop Hochstetter from using Heaphy&#x27;s artwork in a book he published on New Zealand&#x27;s geology.

==Military career==
Soon after returning to Auckland in 1856, Heaphy joined a militia unit, the Auckland Rifle Volunteers, with the rank of private. In early 1863, during a period of hostilities of the New Zealand Wars, his unit was mobilised and Heaphy commissioned as an officer. Later that year he was appointed captain of the Parnell Company. In July 1863, as part of the invasion of the Waikato, he was sent to survey the military road being constructed into the Waikato. He also charted the riverways while pilot of the gunboat &quot;Pioneer&quot;. He was present at the Battle of Rangiriri and later made a sketch of the action, which unusually for him, included representations of British casualties. As the British advanced deeper into the Waikato, he was attached to the staff of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Havelock.
The Waikato Māori had withdrawn to fortified positions at Pikopiko and Paterangi by early 1864. While their positions were under siege, war parties would mount raids on small groups of British soldiers. On 11 February, soldiers of the 40th Regiment of Foot were swimming in the Mangapiko Stream near Paterangi and were attacked by a raiding party. Men of the 50th Regiment of Foot came to the aid of the defenders. Among them was Heaphy, who was in command of a group of 12 soldiers and came across the Māori reserve. After putting them to flight, he then led his men to the Mangapiko Stream to assist the British soldiers helping the besieged party. Despite being outnumbered, the British repulsed the Māori and began to pursue them into the bush. A soldier was wounded and Heaphy and three others went to his aid. In doing so, Heaphy and one of the other soldiers were wounded while another was killed. Unable to extricate themselves, Heaphy and the remaining fit soldier provided cover to prevent the wounded men from being killed by the Māori. They were eventually relieved by reinforcements, but the two wounded men that Heaphy and the soldier were trying to protect died of their injuries. Despite wounds to his arm, hip and ribs, Heaphy remained in the field for much of the remainder of the day, until the ambushed party was relieved. Following the action at Mangapiko Stream, Heaphy was promoted to major; a month later, with the end of the war in the Waikato, he ceased active duty and returned to civilian life.

===Victoria Cross===

In late 1864, Major General Thomas Galloway, the commander of the New Zealand colonial forces, recommended Heaphy for the Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions at Mangapiko Stream. Instituted in 1856, the VC is the highest gallantry award that can be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire.

The recommendation was supported by Grey, who was serving a second term as the Governor of New Zealand, despite knowing that neither Heaphy or another man also recommended for the VC for an action earlier in the campaign, were in the British Army or Royal Navy. At the time, only personnel from the regular British military could be awarded the VC and thus Heaphy, as a militiaman, was not eligible. Grey argued that as Heaphy was under the effective command of British officers he should be made an exception. In London, the authorities disagreed and the recommendation was turned down. Heaphy refused to accept this and began to agitate with the British government, with support from Grey, Havelock, and General Duncan Cameron, commander of the British forces in New Zealand. He was eventually successful and on 8 February 1867, Queen Victoria made a declaration that the local forces of New Zealand would be eligible for the VC. That day, the award of a VC to Heaphy, the first to a New Zealander and also to a non-regular soldier, was gazetted. The citation read:

Heaphy was presented with his VC at a parade at Albert Barracks in Auckland on 11 May 1867. The medal is now on display at the Auckland War Memorial Museum.

==Later life==
After the cessation of hostilities, Heaphy was contracted as the &quot;Chief Surveyor to the General Government of New Zealand&quot; and surveyed much of the land seized from the Waikato Māori by the British, which included that on which the towns of Hamilton and Cambridge were established. In Hamilton, Heaphy Terrace, a thoroughfare in the suburb of Claudelands, is named after him. His contract ended in early 1866 and he was reinstated to his pre-war position as Auckland&#x27;s provincial surveyor.In April 1867, Frederick Whitaker resigned his posts as Superintendent of the Auckland Province and Member of Parliament for the electorate in Auckland. Whitaker&#x27;s resignation became known soon after Heaphy&#x27;s award of the VC was announced and Heaphy declared his candidacy for the vacant seat, declaring that he would be an independent representative for Parnell. The publicity around his award of the VC helped raise his profile and when the nomination meeting for the was held at the Parnell Hall on 6 June, he was returned unopposed as the electorate&#x27;s representative in the New Zealand Parliament. Heaphy&#x27;s time in parliament was undistinguished but he was a hard working representative for the people of the Parnell electorate. He met with constituents to discuss matters of concern ranging from taxes to publicly funded travel. A parliamentary colleague was Fox, his old acquaintance from Nelson. When Fox became Premier of New Zealand in June 1869, Heaphy was a supporter. Offered a well paid position as &quot;Commissioner of Native Reserves&quot; by the Fox administration, he resigned from parliament on 13 April 1870.

As commissioner, Heaphy&#x27;s role was to administer Māori land set aside by the government and to determine areas of land that could be opened to migrants. His work took him up and down the country, inspecting land and negotiating with Māori landowners, a process he did not always enjoy, particularly when rival tribes disputed ownership. He also had to arrange for the acquisition of Māori land for utilities, such as telegraph lines. He occasionally advocated for compensation for aggrieved Māori, whose land had been stolen by colonials. An added stress in Heaphy&#x27;s first year as commissioner was an enquiry into his conduct during the period he was &quot;Chief Surveyor to the General Government of New Zealand&quot; and working in the Waikato. Allegations had been raised that he took bribes to illegally adjust land boundaries. The enquiry, headed by an acquaintance from his days in Nelson, Alfred Domett, cleared Heaphy of corruption, although he was criticised for taking payments from young trainee surveyors in return for work. In 1872, he and his wife moved to Wellington, which was more centrally located and thus convenient for his work, which now included an appointment as &quot;Trust Commissioner for the Wellington District&quot;, dealing with land fraud.

By 1875, Heaphy, beginning to suffer from rheumatism, had reduced the amount of time he spent in the field determining ownership of Māori land and its availability for colonial settlement and the work ended altogether in 1880. In the interim, he picked up more civil service duties; he became a justice of the peace and presided over cases of petty crime brought to the Resident Magistrates Court in Wellington. In April 1878 he was appointed &quot;Government Insurance Commissioner&quot; and later that year became a judge of the Native Land Court.

==Death and legacy==

By May 1881, Heaphy&#x27;s health was in severe decline and, still affected by his rheumatism, he caught tuberculosis. He resigned from all his civil service positions the following month and with his wife, moved to Brisbane, in Queensland, Australia. The couple hoped the warmer climate would help with Heaphy&#x27;s health but he died on 3 August 1881. Having no children he was survived only by his wife. Buried at Toowong Cemetery, formerly the Brisbane General Cemetery, his grave was at first marked with a numbered plaque and soon became overgrown. A descendant of his wife discovered the burial site in 1960 and a headstone was erected by the New Zealand government. The inscription reads: &quot;He served New Zealand in peace and war as artist, explorer and member of parliament. He was the first non-regular soldier to be awarded the Victoria Cross&quot;.

In addition to being the first New Zealander to be awarded the VC, Heaphy was an accomplished artist. His watercolours, mostly produced between 1841 and 1855, are an important record of many scenes in the early days of European settlement in New Zealand. The best of these were those produced for the New Zealand Company. Much of his later work was in the form of sketches and his output decreased in his middle age. Other than the publications relating to the New Zealand Company, his work received little exposure during his lifetime. His paintings were only exhibited on a few occasions, the first in February 1866 in Auckland.

The New Zealand Centennial Exhibition in 1940 increased the public awareness of Heaphy&#x27;s art as a record of colonial life in New Zealand. The Alexander Turnbull Library had purchased an archive of New Zealand Company paintings in 1915 from a bookseller in London, which included around 30 of Heaphy&#x27;s paintings. These were shown during the centennial exhibition and from there his reputation as a significant artist of colonial New Zealand grew. In his book &quot;Letters and Art in New Zealand&quot;, published in 1940, the art critic Eric Hall McCormick considered him the finest New Zealand artist of the colonial period, a view also shared by later authors. Prints of Heaphy&#x27;s paintings began to be produced in 1953 and on the hundred year anniversary of his death, a limited edition portfolio of his watercolours was published. At the time, it was the most expensive book produced in New Zealand, retailing for NZ$750.

His name is also known through the Heaphy Track, a walking route in the north-west corner of the South Island. He and Brunner were probably the first Europeans to walk through this area of the South Island and the Heaphy Track, though he never followed its path, is named in his honour as is the Heaphy River.

<text>Integration testing, also called integration and testing, abbreviated I&amp;T, is a form of software testing in which multiple parts of a software system are tested as a group. 

Integration testing describes tests that are run at the integration-level to contrast testing at the unit or system level.

Often, integration testing is conducted to evaluate the compliance of a component with functional requirements. 

In a structured development process, integration testing takes as its input modules that have been unit tested, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests defined in an integration test plan, and delivers as output test results as a step leading to system testing.

== Approach ==
Some different types of integration testing are big-bang, mixed (sandwich), risky-hardest, top-down, and bottom-up. Other Integration Patterns are: collaboration integration, backbone integration, layer integration, client-server integration, distributed services integration and high-frequency integration.

In big-bang testing, most of the developed modules are coupled together to form a complete software system or major part of the system and then used for integration testing. This method is very effective for saving time in the integration testing process . However, if the test cases and their results are not recorded properly, the entire integration process will be more complicated and may prevent the testing team from achieving the goal of integration testing.

In bottom-up testing, the lowest level components are tested first, and are then used to facilitate the testing of higher level components. The process is repeated until the component at the top of the hierarchy is tested. All the bottom or low-level modules, procedures or functions are integrated and then tested. After the integration testing of lower level integrated modules, the next level of modules will be formed and can be used for integration testing. This approach is helpful only when all or most of the modules of the same development level are ready. This method also helps to determine the levels of software developed and makes it easier to report testing progress in the form of a percentage.

In top-down testing, the top integrated modules are tested first and the branch of the module is tested step by step until the end of the related module.

Sandwich testing combines top-down testing with bottom up testing. One limitation to this sort of testing is that any conditions not stated in specified integration tests, outside of the confirmation of the execution of design items, will generally not be tested.

<doc id="355715" wikidata="Q6651304" url="?curid=355715" title="Little People (toys)">
<text>Little People is a toy brand for children ages 6–36 months and to ages 3 and up, originally produced by Fisher-Price, Inc. in the 1960s as the Play Family People. The current product line consists of playsets, mini-sets and accessories, books, CDs, and DVDs focusing on various configurations of 5 characters named Eddie, Tessa, Mia, Koby, and Sofie. Mattel reports that since the brand&#x27;s launch, over 2-billion Little People figures have been sold in over 60 countries. In 2016, Little People was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame.

The &quot;Little People&quot; name, registered and trademarked by Mattel and Fisher-Price in 1985, came from Mattel following the lead of consumers who referred to the early Play Family playsets as &quot;those little people&quot;.

By 2019, more than two billion Little People figures had been sold in more than 60 countries.

==History==

===Original Little People===

Little People started in 1950 with the &quot;Looky Fire Truck&quot; and three round-headed fire men (attached permanently to the toy). Following the success of this toy, Between 1952 and 1953, Fisher-Price developed the &quot;Super-Jet&quot; and &quot;Racing Rowboat&quot;.

Another early Little People precursor, the #959 &quot;Safety School Bus&quot;, was introduced in 1959. The set included a school bus together with six independent figures made out of tall slimmer pegs of cardboard tubes wrapped in lithographs simulating clothes. The toy gained instant popularity and other sets soon came out. 

===Little People Play Family===
In 1960, Fisher-Price introduced two additional toys with removable figures; &quot;Snorky the Fire Engine&quot; and the &quot;Nifty Station Wagon.&quot; The Nifty Station Wagon came with two adult figures and one child figure, thus the first &quot;Play Family&quot; was born. In 1985, Fisher-Price trademarked &quot;Little People&quot; and formally changed the name of the brand. Today, Little People are known and sold throughout the world. A Nifty Station Wagon in mint condition, in the box, could command up to $1,000,000 among toy collectors.

===Body style variations===
The original Little People went through six major styles of body (base) configurations, and even within each major classification there may be one or more minor style variations. By 1961, the figures were produced with wood; plastic was used for their vehicles and buildings. A few years later, the typical smiley face of the traditional Little People introduced in a &quot;straight-body&quot; format. All of the people had a basic cylinder body with the female figures only identifiable by the addition of slanted, oval eyes and eyelashes. By 1965, the Little People consisted of a small cylindrical base and a wider cylinder shape for boys and men and a conical upper shape for the girls. Adult women had a kind of hourglass-shaped upper body. The bottom portions of the bodies were indented slightly (allowing for placement in the corresponding holes in other furniture, cars and other vehicles, in which the figures were able to &quot;sit&quot;).

===Little People playsets===
In 1968, Fisher-Price introduced the first Little People playset, the famous Play Family Barn with barn doors that made a &quot;moo&quot; sound when opened. Also at this time, the figures were made with plastic bodies instead of wood. The Play Family dollhouse was introduced in 1969, with other playsets to follow, including a firehouse, an airport and a service station. Eventually, the toys encompassed a wide range of playsets, furniture packs, and accessory packs.

In the mid-1970s, Fisher-Price produced the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; town, with different &quot;Sesame Street&quot; stores, a bridge with stop lights and &quot;Sesame Street&quot; characters such as Bert, Ernie, and Little People toys modeled after celebrities: Loretta Long (Susan), Roscoe Orman (Gordon), and Will Lee (Mr. Hooper). Soon after, the Little People Discovery Airport, a hospital, and a school would also be released. Little People characters had by then been also produced with plastic products exclusively.

During the late 2010s, a line of celebrity Little People was launched with playsets including Kiss Little People and The Beatles &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; Little People.

In 1988, Marvel Productions made an animated series of six Little People videos such as &quot;Favorite Songs&quot;, &quot;3 Favorite Stories&quot;, &quot;A Visit to the Farm&quot;, &quot;Fun With Words&quot;, &quot;Jokes, Riddles and Rhymes&quot;, and &quot;Christmas Fun&quot;, which were released by New World Video, which the deal was signed in August 1987. This video series centered around two children named Timmy and Penny and their Baby Sister, their parents, and their dog Lucky.

=== Choking risk ===
In 1987 the company paid a $2.5 million settlement to the parents of Iain Cunningham after their son became physically and mentally disabled from choking on a figurine. 

In 1990, New York Attorney General Robert Abrams negotiated a settlement with Fisher-Price in which the company agreed to post a more specific choking hazard warning label on the boxes of Little People toys.

A book published in 1986 by Edward Swartz titled &quot;Toys That Kill&quot; prominently featured three original Little People figures on the cover and featured the Iain Cunningham case. The American Museum Of Tort Law features an exhibit on the Little People choking hazard.

While the product was redesigned in 1991 to become chunkier and therefore harder to for children to swallow, Fisher-Price contended that the redesign was not in response to choking deaths and that the Little People figurine are safe when they are played with by children of the appropriate age. In response to the choking deaths, the company launched the &quot;Family Alert Program&quot; campaign in 1992 to warned parents not to let young children play with Little People playset and other toys that are designed for older children. A Fisher-Price spokesman stated that &quot;the original Little People were designed for children 2 to 6 and met all the safety standards for Fisher-Price, and we&#x27;ve never had a complaint from parents of children in that age range.&quot;

In 2010, Health Canada issued a warning that pre-1991 Little People toys should be disposed after a recent choking death of an infant.

===Articulated Little People===
In 1997, the figures underwent a drastic redesign, from simple lathe-turned shapes to sculpted bodies. Little People became much more detailed and smaller in overall size – in fact, closer in size to the original Little People. For the first time, the Little People figures had arms, hands, more detailed clothing, molded hair, and facial features.

In 1999, Little People celebrated their 40th anniversary with the return of the first Little People toy ever: Little People School Bus and characters. The play sets include the school bus, circus train, construction vehicles, and other play sets.

In 2000, the Little People line introduced electronic sounds and movements. The Little People characters were given distinct personalities and voices in a stop motion, animated series with Phil Craig, known for starring in &quot;The Time Traveller&#x27;s Wife&quot;, &quot;Cinderella Man&quot;, and &quot;Spider&quot;; and Aaron Neville singing the theme song. The series was produced by Denmark-based Egmont Imagination and Cuppa Coffee Studios between 1999 and 2005.

They have been collected into around 30 volumes and released for home media on VHS and over 30 DVDs with some being distributed by Artisan Entertainment and Lionsgate Home Entertainment through Family Home Entertainment.

===Little People A to Z Learning Zoo===
In 2007, Fisher-Price produced the Little People A to Z learning zoo. This production introduced animals to the Little People family. The A to Z learning zoo includes 26 animals that each begin with a different letter of the alphabet. This interactive play mat allows children to learn the alphabet, recognize letters, and learn facts about animals. This was a significant step for the company, as education is now infused in their product.

<text>David Alan Stockman (born November 10, 1946) is an American politician and former businessman who was a Republican U.S. Representative from the state of Michigan (1977–1981) and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (1981–1985) under President Ronald Reagan.

== Early life and education ==
Stockman was born in Fort Hood, Texas, the son of Allen Stockman, a fruit farmer, and Carol (née Bartz). He is of German descent, and his family&#x27;s surname was originally &quot;Stockmann&quot;. He was raised in a conservative family in St. Joseph, Michigan; his maternal grandfather, William Bartz, was a Republican treasurer of Berrien County, Michigan for 30 years. Stockman was educated at public schools in Stevensville, Michigan. He graduated from Lakeshore High School in 1964 and received a BA in History from Michigan State University . He was a graduate theology student at Harvard University from 1968 until he left the university after 1969.

== Career ==
He served as special assistant to United States Representative and 1980 U.S. presidential candidate John Anderson of Illinois, 1970–1972, and was executive director, United States House of Representatives Republican Conference, 1972–1975.

=== U.S. House of Representatives ===

In 1976, Stockman was elected from Michigan&#x27;s 4th congressional district to the House of Representatives for the 95th Congress. He was reelected in the two subsequent elections. In total, he served in the House from January 3, 1977, until his resignation on January 21, 1981, to accept appointment as Director of the Office of Management and Budget for President Ronald Reagan.

=== Office of Management and Budget ===
Stockman was one of the most controversial OMB directors ever appointed, also known as the &quot;Father of Reaganomics.&quot; He resigned in August 1985. Committed to the doctrine of supply-side economics, he assisted in the passing of the &quot;Reagan Budget&quot; (the Gramm-Latta Budget), which Stockman hoped would curtail the &quot;welfare state&quot;. He thus gained a reputation as a tough negotiator with House Speaker Tip O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and Majority Leader Howard Baker&#x27;s Republican-controlled Senate. During this period, Stockman became well known to the public during the contentious political wrangling concerning the role of the federal government in American society.

Stockman&#x27;s influence within the Reagan Administration was weakened after the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; magazine published the infamous 18,246-word article, &quot;The Education of David Stockman&quot;, in its December 1981 issue, based on lengthy interviews Stockman gave to reporter William Greider.

Stockman was quoted as referring to Reagan&#x27;s tax act in these terms: &quot;I mean, Kemp-Roth [Reagan&#x27;s 1981 tax cut] was always a Trojan horse to bring down the top rate... It&#x27;s kind of hard to sell &#x27;trickle down.&#x27; So the supply-side formula was the only way to get a tax policy that was really &#x27;trickle down.&#x27; Supply-side is &#x27;trickle-down&#x27; theory.&quot; Of the budget process during his first year on the job, Stockman was quoted as saying, &quot;None of us really understands what&#x27;s going on with all these numbers,&quot; which was used as the subtitle of the article.

After &quot;being taken to the woodshed by the president&quot; because of his candor with Greider, Stockman became concerned with the projected trend of increasingly large federal deficits and the rapidly expanding national debt. On August 1, 1985, he resigned from OMB and later wrote a memoir of his experience in the Reagan Administration titled &quot;The Triumph of Politics: Why the Reagan Revolution Failed&quot; in which he specifically criticized the failure of congressional Republicans to endorse a reduction of government spending to offset large tax decreases to avoid the creation of large deficits and an increasing national debt.

=== Fiscal legacy ===

President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s last fiscal year budget ended with a $79.0 billion budget deficit (and a national debt of $907.7 billion as of September 30, 1980), ending during the period of David Stockman&#x27;s and Ronald Reagan&#x27;s first year in office, on October 1, 1981. The gross federal national debt had just increased to $1.0 trillion during October 1981 ($998 billion on September 30, 1981, up from $907.7 billion during the last full fiscal year of the Carter administration).

By September 30, 1985, four and a half years into the Reagan administration and shortly after Stockman&#x27;s resignation from the OMB during August 1985, the gross federal debt was $1.8 trillion. Stockman&#x27;s OMB work within the administration during 1981 until August 1985 was dedicated to negotiating with the Senate and House about the next fiscal year&#x27;s budget, executed later during the autumn of 1985, which resulted in the national debt becoming $2.1 trillion at fiscal year end September 30, 1986.

In 1981, Stockman received the Samuel S. Beard Award for Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 Years or Under, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

=== Business career ===
After leaving government, Stockman joined the Wall St. investment bank Salomon Brothers and later became a partner of the New York–based private equity company, the Blackstone Group. His record was mixed at Blackstone, with some very good investments, such as American Axle, but also failures, including Haynes International and Republic Technologies. During 1999, after Blackstone CEO Stephen A. Schwarzman curtailed Stockman&#x27;s role in managing the investments he had developed, Stockman resigned from Blackstone to start his own private equity fund company, Heartland Industrial Partners, L.P., based in Greenwich, Connecticut.

On the strength of his investment record at Blackstone, Stockman and his partners raised $1.3 billion of equity from institutional and other investors. With Stockman&#x27;s guidance, Heartland used a contrarian investment strategy, buying controlling interests in companies operating in sectors of the U.S. economy that were attracting the least amount of new equity: auto parts and textiles. With the help of about $9 billion in Wall Street debt financing, Heartland completed more than 20 transactions in less than 2 years to create four portfolio companies: Springs Industries, Metaldyne, Collins &amp; Aikman, and TriMas. Several major investments performed very poorly, however. Collins &amp; Aikman filed for bankruptcy during 2005 and when Heartland sold Metaldyne to Asahi Tec Corp. during 2006, Heartland lost most of the $340 million of equity it had invested in the business.

==== Collins and Aikman Corp. ====
During August 2003, Stockman became CEO of Collins &amp; Aikman Corporation, a Detroit-based manufacturer of automotive interior components. He was ousted from that job days before Collins &amp; Aikman filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 on May 17, 2005.

==== Criminal and civil charges ====

On March 26, 2007, federal prosecutors in Manhattan indicted Stockman in &quot;a scheme... to defraud [Collins &amp; Aikman]&#x27;s investors, banks and creditors by manipulating C&amp;A&#x27;s reported revenues and earnings.&quot; The United States Securities and Exchange Commission also brought civil charges against Stockman related to actions that he performed while CEO of Collins &amp; Aikman. Stockman suffered a personal financial loss, over $13 million, along with losses suffered by as many as 15,000 Collins &amp; Aikman employees worldwide.

Stockman said in a statement posted on his law firm&#x27;s website that the company&#x27;s end was the consequence of an industry decline, not due to fraud. On January 9, 2009, the US Attorney&#x27;s Office announced that it would discontinue prosecution of Stockman for this case.

==Personal life==
Stockman lives in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He is married to Jennifer Blei Stockman and is the father of two children, Rachel and Victoria. Jennifer Blei Stockman is a chairwoman emerita of the Republican Majority for Choice, and president of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation Board of Trustees. In 2013, Stockman signed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in favor of same-sex marriage. In 2018, Stockman criticized the U.S. interventionist foreign policy. He serves on the board of directors of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

* &quot;[Social Security] has to be means-tested. And Medicare needs to be means-tested ... Let the Bush tax cuts expire. Let the capital gains go back to the same rate as ordinary income.&quot;

* &quot;Ninety-two percent of the wealth is owned by five percent of the people.&quot; (Bloomberg TV 2013)
* &quot;[T]he Republican Party was hijacked by modern imperialists during the Reagan era. As a consequence, the conservative party cannot perform its natural function as watchdog of the public purse because it is constantly seeking legislative action to provision a vast war machine of invasion and occupation.&quot;
* &quot;The hard part of the supply-side tax cut is dropping the top rate from 70 to 50 per cent — the rest of it is a secondary matter. The original argument was that the top bracket was too high, and that’s having the most devastating effect on the economy. Then, the general argument was that, in order to make this palatable as a political matter, you had to bring down all the brackets. But, I mean, Kemp-Roth was always a Trojan horse to bring down the top rate.&quot; (1982, speaking on Reagan&#x27;s 1981 tax cuts)

<text>Emanuel Haldeman-Julius (&quot;né&quot; Emanuel Julius) (July 30, 1889 – July 31, 1951) was a Jewish-American socialist writer, atheist thinker, social reformer and publisher. He is best remembered as the head of Haldeman-Julius Publications, the creator of a series of pamphlets known as &quot;Little Blue Books,&quot; total sales of which ran into the hundreds of millions of copies.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Emanuel Julius was born July 30, 1889, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of David Julius (&quot;né&quot; Zolajefsky), a bookbinder. His parents were Jewish emigrants who fled Odessa (then part of the Russian Empire) and emigrated to America to escape religious persecution. His paternal and maternal grandfathers had both been rabbis but his own parents were not religious. &quot;[T]hey were indifferent, for which I thank them.&quot;

As a boy, Emanuel read voraciously. Literature and pamphlets produced by the socialists were inexpensive; Julius read them and was convinced by their arguments. As he put it in 1913, &quot;Only four years ago, I was a factory hand — slaving away in a textile mill in Philadelphia. I came upon the philosophy of Socialism and it put a new spirit into me. It lifted me out of the depths and pointed the way to something higher. I commenced to crave for expression. I felt that I have something to say. So, I scribbled things down. And, to my surprise, Socialist editors gave me a little encouragement.&quot; He joined the Socialist Party before World War I and was the party&#x27;s 1932 Senatorial candidate for the state of Kansas.

===Career===

After working for various newspapers, Julius rose to particular prominence as an editor (1915-1922) of the &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;, a socialist newspaper with a large but declining national circulation. He and his first wife, Marcet Haldeman (whose last name he adopted in hyphenate), purchased the &quot;Appeal&quot;&#x27;s printing operation in Girard, Kansas and began printing pocket books on cheap pulp paper (similar to that used in pulp magazines), stapled in paper cover. These were first were called &quot;The Appeal&#x27;s Pocket Series&quot; and sold in 1919 for 25 cents. The covers were either red or yellow. Over the next several years Haldeman-Julius changed the name successively to &quot;The People&#x27;s Pocket Series&quot;, &quot;Appeal Pocket Series&quot;, &quot;Ten Cent Pocket Series&quot;, &quot;Five Cent Pocket Series&quot;, &quot;Pocket Series&quot; and finally in 1923, &quot;Little Blue Books&quot;. The five cent price of the books remained in place for many years. Many titles of classic literature were given lurid titles in order to increase sales. Eventually, millions of copies per year were sold in the late 1920s.

In 1922 they renamed the &quot;Appeal&quot; as &quot;The Haldeman-Julius Weekly&quot; (known from 1929 to 1951 as &quot;The American Freeman&quot;), which became the house organ. In 1924 they launched &quot;The Haldeman-Julius Monthly&quot; (later renamed &quot;The Debunker&quot;), which had a greater emphasis on Freethought, and in 1932 added &quot;The Militant Atheist&quot;, among other journals.

The novelist Louis L’Amour (1908-1988) described the Haldeman-Julius publications in his autobiography and their potential influence:
Riding a freight train out of El Paso, I had my first contact with the Little Blue Books. Another hobo was reading one, and when he finished he gave it to me. The Little Blue Books were a godsend to wandering men and no doubt to many others. Published in Girard, Kansas, by Haldeman-Julius, they were slightly larger than a playing card and had sky-blue paper covers with heavy black print titles. I believe there were something more than three thousand titles in all and they were sold on newsstands for 5 or 10 cents each. Often in the years following, I carried ten or fifteen of them in my pockets, reading when I could.

Among the books available were the plays of Shakespeare, collections of short stories by De Maupassant, Poe, Jack London, Gogol, Gorky, Kipling, Gautier, Henry James, and Balzac. There were collections of essays by Voltaire, Emerson, and Charles Lamb, among others. There were books on the history of music and architecture, painting, the principles of electricity; and, generally speaking, the books offered a wide range of literature and ideas. […] In subsequent years I read several hundred of the Little Blue Books, including books by Tom Paine, Charles Darwin, and Thomas Huxley.

===Personal life, death and legacy===

The couple had two children: Alice Haldeman-Julius Deloach (1917–1991) and Henry Haldeman-Julius (1919–1990; he later changed his name to Henry Julius Haldeman). They adopted Josephine Haldeman-Julius Roselle (b. 1910). Marcet and Emanuel legally separated in 1933. Marcet died in 1941, and a year later Haldeman-Julius married Susan Haney, an employee.

In June 1951 Haldeman-Julius was found guilty of income tax evasion by a Federal grand jury and sentenced to six months in Federal prison and fined $12,500. The next month he drowned in his swimming pool. His son Henry took over his father&#x27;s publishing efforts, and the books continued to be sold until the printing house burned down on July 4, 1978.

Haldeman-Julius&#x27;s papers are held at Pittsburg State University in Pittsburg, Kansas, a few miles from Girard in the southeastern corner of the state, as well as at the University of Illinois at Chicago, Indiana University and California State University, Northridge.

<doc id="355723" wikidata="Q166623" url="?curid=355723" title="Johan van Oldenbarnevelt">
<text>Johan van Oldenbarnevelt (; 14 September 1547 – 13 May 1619), Heer van Berkel en Rodenrijs (1600), Gunterstein (1611) and Bakkum (1613), was a Dutch statesman and revolutionary who played an important role in the Dutch struggle for independence from Spain. He is generally considered as one of the greatest and most important political figures in the history of The Netherlands.

Van Oldenbarnevelt was born in Amersfoort. He studied law at the universities of Leuven, Bourges, Heidelberg, and Padua, and traveled in France and Italy before settling permanently in The Hague. He favored William the Silent in his revolt against Philip II of Spain, and fought in William&#x27;s army. In his later years he was a supporter of the Arminians during the religious-political controversy which split the young Dutch Republic. He was the founder of the Dutch East India Company.

== Early political life ==

Van Oldenbarnevelt served as a volunteer for the relief of Haarlem (1573) and again at Leiden (1574). He was married in 1575 to Maria van Utrecht. In 1576 he obtained the important post of pensionary of Rotterdam, an office which carried with it official membership of the States of Holland. In this capacity his industry, singular grasp of affairs, and persuasive powers of speech speedily gained for him a position of influence. He was active in promoting the Union of Utrecht (1579) and the offer of the countship of Holland and Zeeland to William the Silent (prevented by William’s death in 1584). He was a fierce opponent of the policies of the Earl of Leicester, the governor‐general at the time, and instead favoured Maurice of Nassau, a son of William. Leicester left in 1587, leaving the military power in the Netherlands to Maurice. During the governorship of Leicester, Van Oldenbarnevelt was the leader of the strenuous opposition offered by the States of Holland to the centralizing policy of the governor.

== Land&#x27;s Advocate ==

On 16 March 1586, Van Oldenbarnevelt, in succession to Paulus Buys, became Land&#x27;s Advocate of Holland for the States of Holland and West Friesland, an office he held for 32 years. This great office, given to a man of commanding ability and industry, offered unbounded influence in a multi-headed republic without any central executive authority. Though nominally the servant of the States of Holland, Van Oldenbarnevelt made himself the political personification of the province which bore more than half the entire charge of the union. As mouthpiece of the &quot;ridderschap&quot; (College of Nobles), with one vote in the States of Holland, he practically dominated that assembly. In a brief period, he became entrusted with such large and far-reaching authority in all details of administration, that he became the virtual Prime minister of the Dutch republic.

During the two critical years following the withdrawal of Leicester, the Advocate&#x27;s statesmanship kept the United Provinces from collapsing under their own inherent separatist tendencies. This prevented the United Provinces from becoming an easy conquest for the formidable army of Alexander of Parma. Also of good fortune for the Netherlands, the attention of Philip II of Spain was at its greatest weakness, instead focused on a contemplated invasion of England. Spain&#x27;s lack of attention coupled with the United Province&#x27;s lack of central, organized government allowed Van Oldenbarnevelt to gain control of administrative affairs. His task was made easier by receiving whole-hearted support from Maurice of Nassau, who, after 1589, held the office of Stadholderate of five provinces. He was also Captain-General and Admiral of the Union.

The interests and ambitions of Van Oldenbarnevelt and Maurice did not clash. Indeed, Maurice&#x27;s thoughts were centered on training and leading armies, and he had no special capacity as a statesman or desire for politics. Their first rift came in 1600, when Maurice was forced against his will by the States-General, under the Advocate&#x27;s influence, to undertake a military expedition to Flanders. The expedition was saved from disaster by desperate efforts that ended in victory at the Battle of Nieuwpoort.

After 1598, Van Oldenbarnevelt took part in special diplomatic missions to King Henry IV of France and Queen Elizabeth I of England, and again in 1605 in a special mission sent to congratulate King James I of England on his accession. He initiated and brokered the action that founded the Dutch East India Company (VOC) amalgamating half a dozen companies that traded on the Far East (the first from 1595) into one in 1602. The VOC would trade for two centuries. In 1612 the VOC developed the model for the corporation of using joint stock ownership by share holders, who could only get their investment back by selling its shares at a stock exchange, also an Oldenbarnevelt initiative. The basic principle of the model was over time adopted worldwide.

As the leader of the delegation of Holland in the States-General Oldenbarnevelt also dominated Dutch diplomacy. He led the negotiations with the Spanish Crown which led to the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce in 1609.

== Religious conflict in the Netherlands ==
The immediate effect of the truce was a strengthening of Van Oldenbarnevelt&#x27;s influence in the government of the Dutch Republic, now recognized as a free and independent state; external peace, however, was to bring with it internal strife. For some years there had been a war of words between the religious parties, the strict Calvinist Gomarists (or Contra-Remonstrants) and the Arminians.

In 1610 the Arminians, henceforth known as Remonstrants, drew up a petition, known as the Remonstrance, in which they asked that their tenets (defined in the Five Articles of Remonstrance) should be submitted to a national synod, summoned by the civil government. It was no secret that this action by the Arminians was taken with the approval and connivance of Van Oldenbarnevelt, who was an upholder of the principle of religious toleration.

The Gomarists in reply drew up a Contra-Remonstrance in seven articles, and called for a purely church synod. The Dutch Reformed Church was immediately divided into Remonstrants and Contra-Remonstrants; the States of Holland under the influence of Van Oldenbarnevelt supported the former (Remonstrants), and refused to sanction the summoning of a purely church synod (1613). They likewise (1614) forbade the preachers in the Province of Holland to treat the disputed subjects from their pulpits.

Obedience was difficult to enforce without military help. Riots broke out in certain towns, exacerbated by social tensions due to worsening economic conditions. When Prince Maurice was appealed to, as Captain-General of the Republic, he at first declined to act. Though in no sense a theologian, he then declared himself on the side of the Contra-Remonstrants, and established a preacher of that persuasion in a church in The Hague (1617).

== Holland declares sovereign independence (Scherpe Resolutie) ==
The Advocate now took a bold step. He proposed that the States of Holland should, on their own authority, as a sovereign province, raise a local force of 4000 men (&quot;waardgelders&quot;) to keep the peace.

The States-General, meanwhile, by a bare majority (4 provinces to 3) agreed to the summoning of a national church synod. The States of Holland, also by a narrow majority, refused their assent to this, and passed, on 4 August 1617, a strong resolution (&quot;Scherpe Resolutie&quot;) by which all magistrates, officials and soldiers in the pay of the province were, on pain of dismissal, required to take an oath of obedience to the States of Holland and to be held accountable not to the ordinary tribunals but to the States of Holland.

The States‐General of the Republic saw it as a declaration of sovereign independence on the part of Holland and decided to take action. A commission was appointed, with Maurice at its head, to compel the disbanding of the &quot;waardgelders&quot;. On 31 July 1618, the Stadholder, at the head of a body of troops, appeared at Utrecht, which had thrown in its lot with Holland. At his order the local militias laid down their arms. His progress through the towns of Holland met with no military opposition. The States party was crushed without a battle being fought.

== Arrest and trial ==

On 29 August 1618, by order of the States-General, Van Oldenbarnevelt and his chief supporters, Hugo Grotius, Gilles van Ledenberg, and Rombout Hogerbeets, and others were arrested or lost their political positions in government. Van Oldenbarnevelt was, with his friends, kept in strict confinement until November of that year, and then brought for examination before a commission appointed by the States-General, led by Reynier Pauw. He appeared more than 60 times before the commissioners and the whole course of his official life was severely examined. During the period of inquest, he was neither allowed to consult papers nor put his defense in writing.

On 20 February 1619, Van Oldenbarnevelt was arraigned before a special court of twenty-four members, only half of whom were Hollanders, and nearly all of whom were personal enemies. This &quot;ad hoc&quot; judicial commission was necessary, because, unlike in the individual provinces, the federal government did not have a judicial branch. Normally the accused would be brought before the &quot;Hof van Holland&quot; or the &quot;Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland,&quot; the highest courts in the provinces of Holland and Zeeland; however, in this case, the alleged crime was against the &quot;Generaliteit&quot;, or federal government, and required adjudication by the States-General, acting as the highest court in the land. As was customary in similar cases (for instance, the later trial of the judges in the case of the Amboyna massacre), the trial was delegated to a commission. Of course, the accused contested the competence of the court, as they contested the residual sovereignty of the States-General, but their protest was disregarded.

==Death and legacy==

It was in fact, according to critics, a kangaroo court. The stacked bench of judges decided the verdict on Saturday 11 May 1619 and it was announced on Sunday afternoon. Attempts to obtain a pardon, or at least a commutation of the sentence of death, were made by Maurice&#x27;s stepmother, Louise de Coligny, and the French ambassador Benjamin Aubery du Maurier, but it was in vain. On Monday, 13 May 1619, the death sentence was read to Van Oldenbarnevelt; and, therefore, on the same morning, the old statesman, at the age of seventy-one, was beheaded in the Binnenhof, in The Hague. His last words to the gathered crowd were: &quot;Men, do not believe I am a traitor; I have acted sincerely and piously, as a good patriot, and I shall die this way.&quot; Van Oldenbarnevelt&#x27;s last words to the executioner were purportedly: &quot;Make it short, make it short.&quot; He was buried under the Court Chapel (Hofkapel) at the Binnenhof.

During Van Oldenbarnevelt&#x27;s captivity, his servant Jan Francken kept a diary, forty pages long at the time of his execution; a copy was made by a pastor, the Rev Adrian Stolker, in 1825 for wider dissemination, but the original then disappeared until it was rediscovered in 2018 in Van Oldenbarnevelt&#x27;s home city of Amersfoort.

Van Oldenbarnevelt left two sons: Reinier van Oldenbarnevelt, lord of Groeneveld, and Willem van Oldenbarnevelt, lord of Stoutenburg, and two daughters. A conspiracy against the life of Maurice, in which both sons of Van Oldenbarnevelt took part, was discovered in 1623. Stoutenburg, who was the chief accomplice, made his escape and entered the service of Spain; Groeneveld was executed.

In London, &quot;The Tragedy of Sir John van Olden Barnavelt&quot;, a Jacobean play by John Fletcher and Philip Massinger, was written and produced within three months of its protagonist&#x27;s execution. Being controversial in terms of English as well as Dutch politics, it suffered considerable censorship before being allowed on the stage.

== Health ==
Until 1612, van Oldenbarnevelt was rarely ill. He sometimes suffered, especially in 1610 and 1611, from gout and third-day fever or malaria tertiana. In February 1613 he fell during a visit to Huis Westcamp, which meant that he had to miss out for two weeks. At the age of seventy, he began to walk worse on stairs, and had rheumatic complaints. From 1617 he started walking with his iconic &quot;stockske&quot; (walking stick).

<doc id="355729" wikidata="Q466311" url="?curid=355729" title="Joan, Countess of Flanders">
<text>Joan, often called Joan of Constantinople ( 1199 – 5 December 1244), ruled as Countess of Flanders and Hainaut from 1205 (at the age of six) until her death. She was the elder daughter of Baldwin IX, Count of Flanders and Hainaut, and Marie of Champagne.

Orphaned during the Fourth Crusade, Joan was raised in Paris under the tutelage of King Philip II of France. He arranged her marriage to Infante Ferdinand of Portugal in 1212. Ferdinand quickly turned against Philip, starting a war that ended with the defeat of Bouvines and his imprisonment. Joan then ruled her counties alone from the age of 14. She faced the rivalry of her younger sister, Margaret, as well as the revolt of her domains – guided by a man who claimed to be her father. After the end of the war, Ferdinand was released but died soon after. Joan then married Thomas of Savoy. She died in 1244 at the Abbey of Marquette near Lille, having survived her only child, a daughter by Ferdinand.

Joan&#x27;s policies favored economic development in her counties; in fact, she granted several charters to the Flemish cities. She played an important role in the development of the Mendicant orders, the Beguines, the Victorines and hospital communities in her domains (without neglecting the traditional religious orders). Under her reign, women&#x27;s foundations increased, transforming the place of women in both society and the church.

The &quot;Manessier&#x27;s Continuation&quot; (also called the &quot;Third Continuation&quot;), one of the novels of the Story of the Grail was written for Joan, as well as the &quot;Life of St. Martha&quot; of Wauchier de Denain. The first novel in Dutch, &quot;Van den vos Reynaerde&quot;, was written by a cleric of her court.

There are several painted or sculpted representations of the Countess in France and Belgium, as well as two &quot;Géants du Nord&quot;.

==Life==

===Childhood===

Joan&#x27;s exact date of birth is unknown. Contemporary sources indicate that, like her younger sister Margaret, she was baptized in the Church of St. John of Valenciennes.

In 1202, Joan&#x27;s father, Baldwin IX, left his lands to participate in the Fourth Crusade. After the capture of Constantinople, he was proclaimed emperor by the crusaders on 9 May 1204. Her mother, Marie of Champagne, decided to join him shortly after his departure, leaving their daughters Joan and Margaret in the care of their paternal uncle, Philip I of Namur. Marie decided to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land before reuniting with her husband, but died after her arrival at Acre in August 1204. One year later, on 14 April 1205, Baldwin vanished during the Battle of Adrianople against Bulgarians and Cumans under Tsar Kaloyan of Bulgaria. His fate is unknown.

After the news of Baldwin&#x27;s disappearance reached Flanders in February 1206, Joan succeeded her father as countess of Flanders and Hainaut. Because she was still a child, the administration of both counties was assumed by a council composed of the chancellor of Flanders, the provost of Lille and the castellans of Lille and Saint-Omer.

The guardianship and education of both Joan and her sister was supervised by their uncle Philip, who soon put his nieces in a difficult position. He became betrothed to Marie, a daughter of King Philip II of France. He gave his future father-in-law custody of Joan and Margaret, who were raised in Paris alongside the young Count Theobald IV of Champagne. During their time in France, they became familiar with the Cistercian Order, probably because of the future French queen Blanche of Castile.

In 1206, the French king demanded assurances from Philip I of Namur that he would not marry off his nieces without the former&#x27;s consent. In 1208, they reached an agreement: Joan and Margaret were forbidden to marry before their legal majority without the consent of the Marquis of Namur. However, the Marquis would not oppose the royal choice of husbands. If either refused the candidate chosen by King Philip II, the agreement required the Marquis to find a husband—after compensation was made to the French king.

In 1211 Enguerrand III of Coucy offered the King the sum of 50,000 livres to marry Joan, while his brother Thomas would marry Margaret. However, the Flemish nobility was hostile to the project. Matilda of Portugal, widow of Joan&#x27;s granduncle Philip I of Flanders, then offered her nephew, Ferdinand of Portugal, as Joan&#x27;s husband for the same amount. The marriage was celebrated in Paris in January 1212. Ferdinand thus became Joan&#x27;s co-ruler.

===Youth===
While on their way to Flanders, the newlyweds were captured by Joan&#x27;s first cousin Louis of France (the future Louis VIII), eldest son of King Philip II. The French prince intended to recover a large portion of the territory that he considered as belonging to his late mother&#x27;s dowry, including the Artois that Joan&#x27;s father had taken back by force after the death of Louis&#x27; mother in 1190.

Joan and Ferdinand only could obtain their release after signing the Treaty of Pont-à-Vendin (25 February 1212), under which they were forced to surrender the towns of Aire-sur-la-Lys and Saint-Omer to France, recognizing the previous occupation of Prince Louis over those lands. After this event, Joan and Ferdinand decided to join in an alliance with the former allies of Baldwin IX, King John of England and Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor. They obtained the support of the powerful bourgeoisie of Ghent (who initially refused to recognize Ferdinand as Count) after Joan and Ferdinand agreed to the annual election of four &quot;prudhommes&quot; chosen among the aldermen of the city; the granting to the people of Ghent and Ypres of permission to fortify their cities; and the resignation of the castellans of Bruges and Ghent, deemed pro-French.
In retaliation for this alliance, King Philip II attacked Lille, which was burned (with the exception of the fortified &quot;castrum&quot; and churches) in 1213. In Damme, the French fleet was destroyed by the English. At the Battle of Roche-au-Moine (2 July 1214), Prince Louis defeated the English army. Then King Philip II inflicted upon his opponents a decisive defeat at the Battle of Bouvines (27 July 1214), where Ferdinand was captured. During the twelve years that followed, while Ferdinand remained a prisoner of the French, Joan governed alone.

One of her first rulings was to exempt certain groups from taxes to encourage industry: an example is that of settlers in Kortrijk, who did not have to pay property tax, to promote woollen weaving in the town. Also she ordered the reconstruction of Lille&#x27;s ramparts, but fearing a new French offensive, she eventually was forced to sign the Treaty of Paris (24 October 1214), under which major fortresses in southern Flanders were destroyed; property was restored to French partisans; and Flanders was in effect ruled from Paris.

In the meanwhile, the Countess began to petition the Pope for the annulment of her marriage, arguing that it had never been consummated. In 1221, she sought to marry Peter Mauclerc (Duke-Regent of Brittany and widower of Alix of Thouars) but King Philip II refused.

===Conflict with Margaret===
Before 23 July 1212, Joan&#x27;s younger sister Margaret married Bouchard of Avesnes, Lord of Etroen. The French King, viewing this union with suspicion, informed Pope Innocent III that Bouchard before his wedding had already taken holy orders as sub-deacon. In 1215, at the Fourth Lateran Council, the Pope annulled the marriage on this ground. Margaret and Bouchard, however, refused to submit. They took refuge at the Castle of Houffalize in the Ardennes under the protection of Waleran, Count of Luxembourg. In the following four years, they had three sons: Baldwin (who died in infancy), John and Baldwin.

In 1219, during a battle in Flanders against Joan, Bouchard was captured and imprisoned. Two years later (1221), he was released after agreeing to separation from his wife. Between 18 August and 15 November 1223, Margaret married William II of Dampierre.

The next conflict to shake Joan&#x27;s rule took place in 1224, when she wanted to acquire, through her advisor Arnoul of Audernarde, the castellany of Bruges, which King Philip II had entrusted to John of Nesle, bailiff of Flanders, after the Battle of Bouvines. She challenged the excessive sums demanded by the bailiff, and the dispute was judged by two knights. Joan then appealed to the new King Louis VIII of France at a meeting in his court at Melun, contending that, due to her rank, she could only be judged by her peers. The King ultimately gave his verdict in favour of John of Nesle, which was a cause of further humiliation for the Countess.

===Return of Baldwin===
According to the &quot;Chroniques de Hainaut&quot;, the governor of Flanders and Hainaut Arnulf of Gavre learned from his uncle Josse Materne, who was now a Franciscan friar at Valenciennes, that Baldwin IX and his companions were able to escape from the Bulgarians after twenty years of captivity. The &quot;Chronique rimée&quot; of Philippe Mouskes reported at the same time that a mysterious stranger distributed large sums of money announcing the return of Baldwin. In 1225, a hermit living near Mortagne-du-Nord, in the forest between Valenciennes and Tournai, claimed to be Baldwin IX. He claimed the restitution by Joan of his rights to the counties of Flanders and Hainaut.

The supposed Baudouin created knights, sealed acts and behaved like a real count. Quickly, he was supported by the nobility of Hainaut, including Jean of Nesle and Robert III of Dreux. Then he received the support of the majority of the cities of Flanders and Hainaut, including Lille and Valenciennes. King Henry III of England even offered to him the renewal of an alliance against Louis VIII, counting with the support of Dukes Henry I of Brabant and Waleran III of Limburg. Joan sent her advisor Arnold of Oudenarde to meet the hermit; however, he returned convinced that he was the true Baldwin IX. Other witnesses were more skeptical, but they were accused by the people of being bribed by the Countess.

Joan was forced to take refuge in Mons, the only city that remained faithful to her. Against the promise of 20,000 livres and the pledge of the cities of Douai and Lécluse, Louis VIII agreed to take his army to restore Joan&#x27;s rights.

Before launching military operations, Louis VIII sent his aunt Sybille of Hainaut, Dowager Lady of Beaujeu and sister of Baldwin IX, to meet the hermit. She developed doubts about his identity. On 30 May 1225 the King met the hermit at Péronne and interrogated him about details of Baldwin IX&#x27;s life: he was unable to remember when and where he was knighted and even he did not remember his own wedding night. Philippe of Jouy (Bishop of Orléans) and Milo of Nanteuil (Bishop of Beauvais), recognized him as a juggler who already tried to pass himself off as Louis I, Count of Blois, who had also disappeared at the Battle of Adrianople.

Convinced that he was an impostor, Louis VIII gave him three days to flee. The false Baldwin IX took refuge with his supporters to Valenciennes, but the city was quickly retaken by the French. Joan required unconditional surrender. The impostor then took refuge with Engelbert II of Berg, Archbishop of Cologne, but there he lost his last followers and fled. Caught near Besançon, he was sent to Joan. Despite the promise to respect his life, he was put in a pillory between two dogs and then hanged at the gates of Lille. It is likely that Bouchard of Avesnes, the former husband of Margaret, was behind the plot: the false Baldwin IX had recognized the legitimate rights of his eldest son as heir of Flanders and Hainaut.

Following the recapture of the rebellious cities, Joan imposed heavy fines on them. This allowed her not only to pay her debts to the King of France the next year (instead of the 20 years previously agreed), but also to pay the ransom of her husband Ferdinand.

===Release of Ferdinand===

Whether as a ploy or out of genuine willingness to turn the page, Joan intensified her efforts to marry Peter Mauclerc, the widowed duke and regent of Brittany. She then requested the annulment of her marriage under grounds of consanguinity from Pope Honorius III, who accepted her petition. However, King Louis VIII refused the consent to a marriage between Mauclerc and the Countess, fearing that the royal demesne, squeezed between their domains, would be too endangered. To finally end Joan&#x27;s marital pretensions, the French King obtained from the Pope the renewal of her marriage with Ferdinand, while forcing her to a treaty and a ransom for her imprisoned husband.

In April 1226, the Treaty of Melun was signed between Joan and Louis VIII, under which Ferdinand&#x27;s ransom was fixed at 50,000 livres parisis payable in two installments. The Treaty also stipulated that the cities of Lille, Douai and Lécluse would be surrendered to France as a pledge until full payment of this considerable amount was made. Joan was also forced to maintain her marital bond with Ferdinand. Both Joan and Ferdinand could be excommunicated if they betrayed the King, a deed which constituted perjury in feudal law. Finally, the knights and representatives of the main Flemish cities also had to swear allegiance to the King of France: at all, 27 cities and 350 nobles paid homage. After the death of Louis VIII on 8 November, his widow Blanche of Castile and his son and successor Louis IX finally released Ferdinand in January 1227 after Joan paid half of the ransom, reduced to 25,000 livres.

In late 1227 or early 1228, Joan gave birth to a daughter, Marie. A few years later, on 27 July 1233 Ferdinand died in Noyon from urinary stones, a disease that he had had since his capture at Bouvines. His heart was buried in Noyon Cathedral, while his body was interred in the Abbey of Marquette, in Flanders. After the death of her husband, Joan wanted to marry Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, but since he was still loyal to the English crown at this point, this did not sit well with Louis IX, who refused to give his consent. It was during that year of 1233 that Bouchard of Avesnes, jailed since his plot of the false Baldwin was released.

After Ferdinand&#x27;s death, the couple&#x27;s daughter and heir presumptive, Marie of Portugal, was sent to Paris to be educated there, following Louis IX&#x27;s demands. In June 1235 she was betrothed to Robert, Louis IX&#x27;s brother. She died shortly after, leaving Joan childless.

===Marriage with Thomas of Savoy, death===

Following Blanche of Castile&#x27;s suggestion, Joan agreed to marry Thomas of Savoy, Count of Maurienne and Lord of Piedmont, maternal uncle of Margaret of Provence, wife of Louis IX. They wed on 2 April 1237, although without Papal dispensation despite consanguinity within the prohibited degrees between them (both were descendants of Humbert II, Count of Savoy). For this marriage, Joan was forced to pay 30,000 livres to the King of France and renew her oath of loyalty. With her new husband, she gave support to Louis IX against the rebellion led by Hugh X of Lusignan.

Joan died on 5 December 1244 at the Abbey of Marquette near Lille, where she had retired shortly before as a nun, and was buried next to her first husband in the mausoleum that she had previously built for him. Without surviving issue, she was succeeded by her sister Margaret, while her widower Thomas returned to Savoy. Her tomb was rediscovered in 2005 on the site of the later destroyed Abbey of Marquette; however, further excavations in 2007 revealed that the Countess&#x27; remains weren&#x27;t present in this tomb.

==Political role==

===Economy===
Countess Joan, in the early years of her personal reign (1214–1226), conducted a policy favorable to the development of Flemish cities. She provided legal and tax privileges to Dunkirk, Ghent, Lille, Mardyck, Seclin (1216), Biervliet and Ypres (1225). In Kortrijk, in 1217, she promoted the influx of workers for the wool industry by exempting from the &quot;taille&quot; tax to people who come to settle in this city. After the return of her husband Ferdinand, she confirmed this political orientation, by granting Douai, Ghent, Ypres, Bruges and Lederzeele new privileges, which gave them greater autonomy vis-à-vis from the Comital power. After the death of Ferdinand (1233), she maintained the Lille Charter and authorized the construction of a belfry at Valenciennes.
Then, after her marriage with Thomas of Savoy (1237–1244), she complemented this policy through tax exemptions, reorganization of the judicial system, measures to promote river commerce and sea ports, concerning the cities of Bergues, Bourbourg, Bruges, Damme, Veurne, Muiden and Kaprijke. In less urban areas, particularly in Hainaut, the comital power remained strong. Under constant pressure from the Flemish bourgeoisie, aware of Joan&#x27;s need of their support against the King of France, she pursued a policy that promoted economic development and urban autonomy, not without tax counterparties.

To promote river commerce, Joan ordered in 1237 the construction of water gates at Menen and Harelbeke, making the Leie river navigable. Then in 1242, with Thomas of Savoy, she authorized the aldermen of Lille to create three locks in Marquette-lez-Lille to Wambrechies and Lille itself, extending the network to the Deûle river. The latter was ultimately not built, but replaced by a double door in Le Quesnoy.

===Religion===

On good relations with the Cistercians, Joan founded the Abbey of Marquette-lez-Lille, and confirmed, supported or helped the foundation of several other monasteries of Cistercian nuns. Until the 12th century, the abbeys of both Flanders and Hainaut were exclusively male; however, twenty female monasteries in Flanders (most notably the Abbey of La Byloke in Ghent), and five in Hainaut were founded during the 13th century. They were supported by Joan and her sister Margaret – for some of them, the role of foundresses was assigned &quot;a posteriori&quot; in modern times.

Joan also supported the foundation of the Mendicant orders in her counties. At Valenciennes, (to which a small community of Franciscans moved in 1217), she granted them the usufruct of the old &quot;Donjon&quot; of the city with for the foundation of a convent there; however, she had to face the resistance of the local Franciscan community. Finally, the two communities merged before 1241. In the case of the Franciscans of Lille, Joan sent her general contractor and carpenters to help build the church and convent.

The Countess also promoted and established several monasteries, abbeys and Béguinages in her domains: the most notable of them were located in Mons and Valenciennes (in Hainaut), Bruges, Ghent and Ypres (in Flanders), all founded between 1236 and 1244. Douai and Lille were founded in 1245 by her sister Margaret. It is possible that the influence of the Dominicans played a role in these foundations, some of which were under their spiritual direction.
By the end of the 12th century, the religious Victorines were established in Flanders and Hainaut. A dozen monasteries were founded between 1217 and 1262. Joan encouraged this movement, and directly supported, in 1244 the creation of the Bethlehem Priory at Mesvin in the Diocese of Cambrai. These monasteries, which enjoyed considerable autonomy, had a charitable and urban land use. They responded well to the demands of the new women&#x27;s spirituality of the 13th century.

Joan also supported hospitals (including Saint-Sauveur and Saint-Nicolas in Lille) and leper colonies. In 1228, with her husband Ferdinand, she provided for the founding of the Abbey of Our Lady of Biloke in Ghent. In February 1237, she founded the Hospice Comtesse, for which she donated the gardens of her residence in the &quot;castrum&quot; of Lille at the site of the old &quot;donjon&quot; which was destroyed by the French in 1213. She also founded the Hospital of Saint Elizabeth of Hungary in Valenciennes, four years after her canonization. This foundation was used by the beguines.

==Influence on medieval literature==

Two known manuscripts are considered to have belonged to Joan&#x27;s library. The first is a Psalter preserved in the Bibliothèque nationale de France (Lat. 238), made around 1210, which could have been offered by Blanche of Navarre to her aunt when she married Ferdinand of Portugal. The second, dating from 1210 to 1220 is a copy of the &quot;Story of the Grail&quot;, kept at the British Library (Add. 36614). This second manuscript would have involved the &quot;Perceval&quot; of Chrétien de Troyes, which Joan would have added the &quot;Continuations&quot; and the &quot;Life of St. Mary of Egypt&quot;. Both come from a workshop of Champagne.

The writing of the Story of the Grail is strongly linked to the Counts of Flanders. Chrétien de Troyes wrote under the protection of Joan&#x27;s grand-uncle, Philip of Alsace. Manessier, author of the &quot;Third continuation&quot;, dedicated his work to Joan. It&#x27;s likely that his predecessor Wauchier de Denain, author of the &quot;Second continuation&quot; was also part of her court, without being able to demonstrate with certainty that the book was written for her. However, was widely known that he dedicated his &quot;Life of St. Martha&quot; to the young Countess, around 1212. Despite his character hagiographic, this text appears to have been designed both as a book for the instruction and edification of his teenage dedicatee, but also as a wonderful story, near the chivalric romance, including the episode of the Tarasque. Martha is presented as a great speaker, able to defeat the insurgency cities where St. Front de Passais and St. George were unsuccessful.

The &quot;Van den vos Reynaerde&quot; is the first version of Reynard the Fox in the Netherlands and one of the first literary works written in that language. It contains the original episodes, which do not belong to the Romanesque release. His author, &quot;Willem die Madocke maecte&quot; was identified as the lay Cistercian Guillaume de Boudelo, who died in 1261. This talented clerk was recruited by Countess, who made the request to the Cistercian General Chapter in 1238. He was appointed as director of the Hospice Comtesse in Lille, after his foundation, from 1238 to 1244 and then to the convent of Marke, near Kortrijk.

Nevertheless, Joan&#x27;s activity as literary patron seems to have been limited. It is possible that to succeed in a world dominated by men, she had to voluntarily dismiss this role usually assigned to women.

==Cultural legacy==

Later medieval chroniclers, such as Matthew Paris, are generally hostile to her; almost all consider that the hermit was indeed the true Baldwin IX of Flanders and by killing him, she committed parricide. In the middle of the 15th century, the book &quot;Baudouin, Count of Flanders&quot;, presents Joan as the illegitimate child of the Count with a Saracen possessed by a demon, who commits patricide after a tortuous romantic plot.

In 1823 Sismondi repeats this thesis of parricide in his &quot;Histoire des Français&quot;, like the playwrights Fontan and Victor Herbin in their play &quot;Jeanne de Flandre&quot; in 1835. In response, Emile Gachet began a process to rehabilitate the Countess in the recently founded &quot;Revue du Nord&quot;. Finally, in 1840 Jules de Saint-Genois, father of the Belgian historical novel, wrote &quot;A false Baudouin&quot;, then the following year, Edward le Glay published his &quot;Histoire de Jeanne de Constantinople, comtesse de Flandre et de Hainaut&quot;, who for a long time was an authority on the subject and helped to rehabilitate the Countess.

The Museum of the Hospice Comtesse has two tapestries of Guillaume Werniers, after drawings of Arnould de Vuez representing Countess Joan. One, made of wool and silk, showed Joan sat between her two successive husbands, Ferdinand of Portugal and Thomas of Savoy, identified by their faces; it is marked &quot;Joan of Constantinople, Countess of Flanders / founder of this house in 1233&quot;, which shows that the tapestry was made to the Hospice Comtesse. The other shows Count Baldwin IX, with his wife and two daughters, the future Countesses Joan and Margaret. In the same museum, an anonymous painting of 1632, called &quot;Foundation of the Notre-Dame Hospital&quot;, shows Countesses Joan and Margaret, surrounded by the Virgin, St. Augustine and St. Elizabeth of Hungary, as well as monks and nuns of the Hospice Comtesse.

There are statues of Joan in the béguinage of Kortrijk and the Old Saint Elisabeth in Ghent. The mother-child hospital in the Regional University Hospital of Lille bears her name. The city of Wattrelos has created &quot;Géants du Nord&quot; for Joan and her two husbands. This is also the case of the city of Marquette-lez-Lille, where the Countess was buried.

In the autumn of 2009, an exhibition entitled &quot;Joan of Constantinople, Countess of Flanders and Hainaut&quot;, was devoted to her. It was the opportunity of an artistic creation dedicated to both Countesses Joan and Margaret by photographer Laura Henno.

<doc id="355733" wikidata="Q170723" url="?curid=355733" title="Ruddy shelduck">
<text>The ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea), known in India as the Brahminy duck, is a bird species in the family Anatidae. It is a distinctive waterfowl, in length with a wingspan of . It has orange-brown body plumage with a paler head, while the tail and the flight feathers in the wings are black, contrasting with the white wing-coverts. It is a migratory bird, wintering in the Indian subcontinent and breeding in southeastern Europe and central Asia, though there are small resident populations in North Africa. It has a loud honking call.

The ruddy shelduck mostly inhabits inland water-bodies such as lakes, reservoirs and rivers. The male and female form a lasting pair bond and the nest may be well away from water, in a crevice or hole in a cliff, tree or similar site. A clutch of about eight eggs is laid and is incubated solely by the female for about four weeks. The young are cared for by both parents and fledge about eight weeks after hatching.

In central and eastern Asia, populations are steady or rising, but in Europe they are generally in decline. Altogether, the birds have a wide range and large total population, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed their conservation status as being of least concern.

==Taxonomy and etymology==

The ruddy shelduck (&quot;Tadorna ferruginea&quot;) is a member of the shelduck genus &quot;Tadorna&quot; in the wildfowl family Anatidae. The bird was first described in 1764 by the German zoologist and botanist Peter Simon Pallas who named it &quot;Anas ferruginea&quot;, but later it was transferred to the genus &quot;Tadorna&quot; with the other shelducks. Some authorities place it in the genus &quot;Casarca&quot; along with the South African shelduck (&quot;T. cana&quot;), the Australian shelduck (&quot;T. tadornoides&quot;) and the paradise shelduck (&quot;T. variegata&quot;). Phylogenetic analysis shows that it is most closely related to the South African shelduck. In captivity, the ruddy shelduck has been known to hybridise with several other members of &quot;Tadorna&quot;, with several members of the dabbling duck genus &quot;Anas&quot;, and with the Egyptian goose (&quot;Alopochen aegyptiaca&quot;). No subspecies are recognised.

The generic name &quot;Tadorna&quot; comes from the French &quot;tadorne&quot;, the common shelduck, and may originally derive from a Celtic word meaning &quot;pied waterfowl&quot;. The English name &quot;sheld duck&quot; dates from around 1700 and means the same. The specific name &quot;ferruginea&quot; is Latin for &quot;rusty&quot; and refers to the colour of the plumage.

==Description==

The ruddy shelduck grows to a length of and has a wingspan. The male has orange-brown body plumage and a paler, orange-brown head and neck, separated from the body by a narrow black collar. The rump, flight feathers, tail-coverts and tail feathers are black and there are iridescent green speculum feathers on the inner surfaces of the wings. Both upper and lower wing-coverts are white, this feature being particularly noticeable in flight but hardly visible when the bird is at rest. The bill is black and the legs are dark grey. The female is similar but has a rather pale, whitish head and neck and lacks the black collar, and in both sexes, the colouring is variable and fades as the feathers age. The birds moult at the end of the breeding season and the male loses the black collar, but a further partial moult between December and April restores it. Juveniles are similar to the female but are a darker shade of brown.

The call is a series of loud, nasal honking notes, it being possible to discern the difference between those produced by the male and the female. The calls are made both on the ground and in the air, and the sounds are variable according to the circumstances in which they are uttered.

==Distribution and habitat==
There are very small resident populations of this species in Northwest Africa and Ethiopia, but the main breeding area of the bird is from southeast Europe across the Palearctic to Lake Baikal, Mongolia, and western China. Eastern populations are mostly migratory, wintering in the Indian subcontinent. This species has colonised the island of Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands, first breeding there in 1994, and reaching a population of almost fifty pairs by 2008. The ruddy shelduck is a common winter visitor in India where it arrives by October and departs by April. Its typical breeding habitat is large wetlands and rivers with mud flats and shingle banks, and it is found in large numbers on lakes and reservoirs. It breeds in high altitude lakes and swamps in Jammu and Kashmir. Outside the breeding season it prefers lowland streams, sluggish rivers, ponds, flooded grassland, marshes and brackish lagoons.

Although becoming quite rare in Southeastern Europe and southern Spain, the ruddy shelduck is still common across much of its Asian range. It may be this population which gives rise to vagrants as far west as Iceland, Great Britain and Ireland. However, since the European population is declining, it is likely that most occurrences in Western Europe in recent decades are escapes or feral birds. Although this bird is observed in the wild from time to time in eastern North America, no evidence has been found that this is a genuine case of vagrancy. Feral ruddy shelduck have bred successfully in several European countries. In Switzerland the ruddy shelduck is considered an invasive species that threatens to displace native birds. Despite actions taken to reduce numbers, the population of ruddy shelduck in Switzerland increased from 211 to 1250 individuals in the period from 2006 to 2016.

A stable population exists in Moscow, settling the city parks&#x27; ponds alongside the endemic mallards. It is theorized that the birds are feral descendants of escapees from the Moscow Zoo, the population most likely forming after 1948, when the policy of clipping the birds&#x27; wings was repealed. Unlike the wild population, these ducks are non-migratory, wintering instead in the non-freezing parts of the city&#x27;s bodies of water.

This shelduck mostly frequents open locations on inland bodies of water such as lakes, reservoirs and rivers. It is seldom seen in forested areas but does occur in brackish water and saline lagoons. Though more common in the lowlands, it also inhabits higher altitudes and in central Asia is one of the few waterbirds, along with the bar-headed goose (&quot;Anser indicus&quot;), to be found on lakes at .

==Behaviour==

The ruddy shelduck is a mainly nocturnal bird. It is omnivorous and feeds on grasses, the young shoots of plants, grain and water plants as well as both aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates. On land it grazes on the foliage, in the water it dabbles in the shallows, and at greater depths, it up-ends, but it does not dive.

The ruddy shelduck is usually found in pairs or small groups and rarely forms large flocks. However, moulting and wintering gatherings on chosen lakes or slow rivers can be very large. Gatherings of over four thousand birds have been recorded on the Koshi Barrage and in the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve in Nepal, and over ten thousand at Lake Düden in Turkey.

The birds arrive at their main breeding locations in central Asia in March and April. There is a strong pair bond between the male and female and it is thought they pair for life. In their breeding quarters, the birds are very aggressive towards their own kind and towards other species. The female in particular approaches intruders with head lowered and neck outstretched, uttering anger calls. If the intruder stands its ground, the female returns to the male and runs round him, inciting him to attack. He may or may not do so. Mating takes place on the water after a brief courtship ritual involving neck stretching, head dipping and tail raising. The nesting site is often far away from water in a hole in a tree or ruined building, a crevice in a cliff, among sand-dunes or in an animal burrow. The nest is constructed by the female using feathers and down and some grasses.

A clutch of about eight eggs (range six to twelve) is laid between late April and early June. These have a dull gloss and are creamy-white, averaging . Incubation is done by the female while the male stands in attendance nearby. The eggs hatch after about twenty-eight days and both parents care for the young, which fledge in a further fifty-five days. After breeding the adults moult, losing the power of flight for about a month while they do so. Before moulting they move to large water bodies where they can more easily avoid predation while they are flightless. The family may stay together as a group for some time; the autumn migration starts around September and the young may mature in their second year. North African birds breed about five weeks earlier, and their breeding success is greater in wet summers.

==Status==
Buddhists regard the ruddy shelduck as sacred and this gives the birds some protection in central and eastern Asia, where the population is thought to be steady or even rising. The Pembo Black-necked Crane Reserve in Tibet is an important wintering area for ruddy shelducks, and here they receive protection. In Europe on the other hand, populations are generally declining as wetlands are drained and the birds are hunted. However, in Europe and Italy the ruddy shelduck is protected. You can not hunt it. They are less vulnerable than some other waterfowl because of their adaptability to new habitats such as reservoirs.

The ruddy shelduck has a very wide range and an estimated total population size of 170,000 to 225,000 individuals. The overall population trend is unclear as some local populations are increasing while others are decreasing. The bird does not appear to meet the higher criteria necessary to be considered threatened, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature assesses that its conservation status is of least concern. It is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.

<doc id="355735" wikidata="Q3509538" url="?curid=355735" title="Education in Scotland">
<text>Education in Scotland is provided in state schools, private schools and by individuals through homeschooling. Mandatory education in Scotland begins for children in Primary 1 (P1) at primary school and ends in Fourth Year (S4) at secondary school. Overall accountability and control of state–education in Scotland rests with the Scottish Government, and is overseen by its executive agency, Education Scotland, with additional responsibility for nursery schools being the joint responsibility of both Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate. Scotland&#x27;s private schools are overseen by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools. Children in Scotland sit mandatory National Standardised Assessments in Primary 1 (P1), Primary 4 (P4), Primary 7 (P7) at the end of primary school, and Third Year (S3) in secondary school, which assist in monitoring children&#x27;s progress and providing diagnostic data information to support teachers&#x27; professional judgement.

Each of Scotland&#x27;s 32 local authorities have control over the provision of mandatory education and early learning and childcare (nursery education; not mandatory) in their area and have a statutory requirement to ensure pupils in each area receive adequate and efficient provision of school education. Each local authority has control over their own education budget and have responsibility to ensure that their local authority area is implementing national educational policy and guidelines as directed by the Scottish Government. When proposing a change to any aspect of education provision in their area, local authorities must engage in a formal process as required through the Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Act 2010.

Education in Scotland has a history of universal provision of public education, and the Scottish education system is distinctly different from those in the other countries of the United Kingdom. The Scotland Act 1998 gives the Scottish Parliament legislative control over all education matters, and the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 is the principal legislation governing education in Scotland. Traditionally, the Scottish system at secondary school level has emphasised breadth across a range of subjects, while the English, Welsh and Northern Irish systems have emphasised greater depth of education over a smaller range of advanced subjects.

The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD in 2018 ranked Scotland as second out of four in the UK (after England) for reading with an average above the OECD average, while scoring third in the UK, and its results steadily dropping, in maths and science, scoring at OECD average.

The 2021 Nuffield report noted that &quot;Scottish pupils start off strongly at a young age, but then quickly fall behind their UK peers, particularly in maths, which we know has been an issue that Scotland has had to grapple with for several years.&quot; In 2014, research by the Office for National Statistics found that Scotland was the most highly educated country in Europe and among the most well-educated in the world in terms of tertiary education attainment, above countries like Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg, with roughly 40% of Scots aged 16–64 educated to NVQ level 4 and above.

==History==

==Provision of education in Scotland==
===Stages of compulsory education===

Children start primary school aged between 4½ and 5½ depending on when the child&#x27;s birthday falls. Scottish school policy places all those born between March of a given year and February of the following year in the same year group. Children born between March and August start school in August at between 5 and 5½ years old, and those born between September and February start school in the previous August at between age 4½ and 4 years 11 months years old. The Scottish system is the most flexible in the UK, however, as parents of children born between September and December can decide to defer for 1 year (but may or may not receive a funded nursery place in the deferral year), whilst children born between January and February can opt to hold their child back a year and let them start school the following August, with guaranteed nursery funding. This usually allows those not ready for formal education to have an extra year at an early years centre (formerly known as nursery).

Pupils remain at primary school for seven years. Then aged eleven or twelve, they start secondary school for a compulsory four years with the following two years being optional. In Scotland, pupils sit National 4/5 exams (previously Standard Grade or Intermediate exams) at the age of fifteen/sixteen, normally for between 6 and eight subjects including compulsory exams in English and Mathematics. A Science subject (Physics, Biology or Chemistry) and a Social Subject (Geography, History or Modern Studies) were also compulsory, but this was changed in accordance with the new curriculum. It is now required by the Scottish Parliament for students to have two hours of physical education a week; each school may vary these compulsory combinations. The school leaving age is generally sixteen (after completion of National 4/5s), after which students may choose to remain at school and study for Higher and/or Advanced Higher exams.

A small number of students at certain private, private schools may follow the English system and study towards GCSE instead of National 4/5s (Standard Grades), and towards A and AS-Levels instead of (or alongside) Higher Grade and Advanced Higher exams. The International Baccalaureate has also been introduced in some independent schools.

The table below lists rough equivalences with the year system in the rest of the United Kingdom (For England and Wales, the equivalence given is for children born before 1 September; the equivalence for those born from September to February [December for deferred pupils] is given in brackets):
===Access to education===

Government funded schools are free for children aged 5–19. In many cases, this applies to children of international post-graduate students, and other immigrants.

The age ranges specify the youngest age for a child entering that year and the oldest age for a child leaving that year. Playgroup can be described as a daycare centre for toddlers, then children may go on to attend an early years centre as soon as they have passed their third birthday, and progress to Primary 1 in the August of the year in which they turn five. In general, the cut-off point for ages is the end of February, so all children must be of a certain age on 1 March to begin class in August. All parents of children born between September and February (i.e. still 4 years old on the school start date) are entitled to defer entry to Primary School if they believe their child is not ready for school. Only children whose birthdays fall in January or February will be considered for funding for a subsequent year at an early years centre, unless there are special circumstances.

Children may leave school once they reach their statutory school leaving date; this is dependent on date of birth. For children born between 1 March and 30 September, this date is 31 May of their 4th year of secondary school. For children born between 1 October and 28 February, the last day of June is the first date they may leave school if they have a placement at college and the school have signed the health &amp; safety forms. Which high school the children go to depends on the area where they live, known as the &quot;catchment area&quot;, which has a specific high school that takes children who live in that area. Parents can also apply for a placement request if they would like their child to attend a school outside their catchment area and a panel will decide if the child is the most worthy (out of all placing requests) to take one of the spaces left after all children from the catchment area have been taken.

Access to secondary school education in Scotland&#x27;s island communities can be complex. Due to lower population numbers in some of Scotland&#x27;s island settlements, not every island community can have a secondary school given low pupil numbers and the financial strain this can present by having a secondary school open and operational for what, in some cases, can be a lower than average pupil roll. In some areas, pupils attending secondary school require to travel from island communities to the mainland for access to secondary education, with children residing in residential accommodation (also called hostels) on the mainland during school term-term to avoid having to make lengthy travel back to their island communities. The Scottish Government has pledged to ensure that &quot;island students be put on an equal platform with their counterparts from the mainland&quot;.

The table below lists list the numbers of children, schools and teachers in all publicly funded schools:
===Home education===

Home education is also legal in Scotland. Parents wishing to home educate do not need the permission of the Local Authority unless the children are already registered at a school. There are no exact numbers available for children being educated at home in Scotland.

===Qualifications and assessments===
All educational qualifications in Scotland are part of the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework, ranging between Scottish Qualifications Authority qualifications, Scottish Vocational Qualifications and higher education qualifications. Pupils in Primary 1, Primary 4 and Primary 7 at primary school sit a set of national standardised assessments, with secondary pupils sitting the national standardised assessments in S3 in literacy, reading and numeracy. The assessments provided data and information to track pupils progress in education and allows the Scottish Government to collate data across Scotland regarding educational performance.

The &quot;National Improvement Framework for Scottish Education&quot; was launched to ensure that children and young people in Scottish education experience a range of opportunities to learn and develop skills and capacities and ensuring that children and young people experience a broad general education. The &quot;National Improvement Framework&quot; document highlighted six key drivers for improvement in Scottish education; School and Early Learning and Childcare leadership, teacher and Early Years Practitioner professionalism, parental/carer involvement and engagement, curriculum and assessment, school and Early Learning and Childcare improvement and performance information.

Progression in Qualifications
The vast majority of Scottish pupils take Scottish Qualifications Certificate qualifications provided by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA). Generally, most pupils take National 4/5s (previously Standard Grades, but some schools offered Intermediates instead) in S3-S4, and Highers in S5. The number of National 4/5 qualifications a pupil enters can vary drastically depending on the individual, with the most common number of National 5s taken, per pupil, in 2017 being 6, however some may choose to undertake as few as one or two, up to eight or nine. For those who wish to remain at school for the final year (S6), more Highers and Advanced Highers (formerly CSYS) in S6 can be taken. Previous qualifications Intermediate 1 and Intermediate 2 – were intended to be roughly equivalent to General and Credit Level Standard Grades respectively.

Pupils can go to university at the end of S5, as Highers provide the entry requirements for Scottish universities where degrees are normally four years long; however, recently it is more common for students to remain until S6, taking further Highers and/or taking Advanced Highers. The majority of English universities, the most popular choice for Scottish students who wish to study university degrees outside of Scotland, require Advanced Higher qualification levels as these are deemed by the English universities to be most similar to A-levels.

Scottish universities generally have courses a year longer (typically 4 years) than their counterparts elsewhere in the UK, though it is often possible for students to take more advanced specialised exams and join the courses at the second year. One unique aspect is that the ancient universities of Scotland issue a Master of Arts as the first degree in humanities. State schools are owned and operated by the local authorities which act as &quot;Education Authorities&quot;, and the compulsory phase is divided into primary school and secondary school (often called high school). Schools are supported in delivering learning and teaching by Education Scotland (formerly Learning and Teaching Scotland). There are also private schools across the country, although the distribution is uneven with such schools in 22 of the 32 Local Authority areas. At September 2011 the total pupil population in Scotland was 702,104, of which 31,425 pupils, or 4.5%, were being educated in independent schools.

Qualifications at the secondary school and post-secondary (further education) level are provided by the Scottish Qualifications Authority, which is the national awarding and accrediting body in Scotland, and delivered through various schools, colleges and other centres. Political responsibility for education at all levels is vested in the Scottish Parliament and the Learning Directorate. Inspections and audits of educational standards are conducted by three bodies: Care Inspectorate inspects care standards in pre-school provision; Education Scotland (formerly Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Education) for pre-school, primary, education, further and community education; with the Scottish office of the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA Scotland) responsible for higher education.

===National Curriculum===
Unlike England&#x27;s nationally followed &quot;National Curriculum&quot;, Scotland had no national standards for some time. In 2003, work began on an education reform programme, to produce a new &quot;Curriculum for Excellence&quot; that would replace existing guidance on the school curriculum. Curriculum for Excellence was launched in Scottish secondary schools from school session 2012–2013. In 2017, new reforms were introduced moving control over curriculum and schools more towards head teachers and parents. Additional recommendations were made regarding the level of bureaucracy attached to &quot;Curriculum for Excellence&quot; that had been raised by teachers and Early Years Practitioners as a major problem with the curriculum. Following a review, in 2017, the Scottish Government introduced a new framework that would empower teachers and Early Years Practitioners to remove the unnecessary levels of bureaucracy that had been attached to &quot;Curriculum for Excellence&quot;, planning and evaluating for children&#x27;s progress and learning and the paperwork involved in Scottish education as a whole.

A review was undertaken by the OECD, having been commissioned by the Scottish Government to look at the broad general education.

===Religion in schools===
The majority of schools are non-denominational, and include the parish schools, pioneered by the Church of Scotland and other Protestant Churches, which became state schools in 1872. Religious education is taught in non-denominational schools and in denominational schools. Of over 2,500 schools in Scotland, there are 366 state schools which are Roman Catholic, three Episcopalian and one Jewish. The Education (Scotland) Act 1918 brought Roman Catholic schools within the State education system, ensuring the promotion of a Roman Catholic ethos within such schools.

==Governance and scrutiny==
The Scottish Government is responsible for the education system in Scotland, and the countries education system is overseen by Education Scotland, an executive agency of the Scottish Government. The Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills has overall responsibility for education provision in Scotland. The Cabinet Secretary is assisted by three junior ministers, currently the Minister for Childcare and Early Years, the Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science and the Minister for Employability and Training.

The Care Inspectorate regulates Early Learning and Childcare provision in Scotland. The Care Inspectorate publish their own independent inspection reviews of early years provision, and also liaises with Education Scotland frequently to conduct an inspection process for stand alone nurseries (those not attached to a primary school). Nursery classes or early years centres attached to a primary school are inspected by Education Scotland as part of the primary school inspection. In addition to an inspection by Education Scotland inspectors, nursery classes and early years centres are also required to be inspected by the Care Inspectorate.

Education Scotland is solely responsible for the inspection of Scotland&#x27;s primary, secondary and additional support needs schools, and like the Care Inspectorate, can also produce their own independent inspection reviews of early learning and childcare establishments in Scotland.

===Ministers responsible===

==Secondary schools==

Secondary education is provided by secondary schools throughout Scotland, both in the state and independent sector. The vast majority of schools in the state sector are administered directly by the local Education Authority, which is synonymous with the 32 councils used for local government.

There are three broad classifications of schools in Scotland:

* State-funded schools: These are schools under the management of an education authority. These schools do not charge fees to attend and have no entrance restrictions. Both denominational and non-denominational schools fall within this category. In the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 they are also referred to as &#x27;public schools&#x27; (not to be confused with the other meaning of public school in England and Wales).
* Grant-Aided schools: Grant-Aided schools are independent of their education authority and can decide on their own governance, but are directly funded by the Scottish Ministers. There is one mainstream Grant-Aided school in Scotland, Jordanhill School, formerly linked to Jordanhill College of Education. The remaining seven Grant-Aided schools are special schools, which are Capability Scotland: Corseford School, Capability Scotland: Stanmore House School, Donaldson&#x27;s School, East Park School, Harmeny School, the Royal Blind School and the Scottish Centre for Children with Motor Impairments (Craighalbert Centre). Despite their status, several of these schools are members of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
* Independent schools: Independent schools are schools that are not under management of an education authority and do not receive direct state funding. To qualify as a school, it must provide full-time education for at least five pupils of school age. Schools of this type are required to register and are subject to inspections by Education Scotland. Most are members of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools. One independent school, St Mary&#x27;s Music School, receives Aided Places (similar to the abolished Assisted Places Scheme) where fees can be paid by the Scottish Ministers.

===School naming===

There is not a set name for secondary schools in Scotland, but whatever they might be called, with just a few specific exceptions in mainly rural or island authorities, state secondary schools in Scotland are fully comprehensive and non-selective. Amongst the state-run secondary schools:

* 188 are nominally &quot;High Schools&quot;. These are spread across the country. Almost all Catholic secondaries are high schools, with the majority of the other names being non-denominational schools.
* 131 are nominally &quot;Academies&quot;. These are spread across the country but are in high concentration in North-East Scotland, Ayrshire and Galloway, an example is Banchory Academy. There are also three Royal Academies, in Irvine, North Ayrshire; Tain; and Inverness.
* 15 are nominally &quot;Secondary Schools&quot; (colloquially abbreviated to &quot;secondaries&quot;). These are found mostly in Glasgow.
* 14 are nominally &quot;Grammar Schools&quot;. Most of these schools were defined as grammar schools under a previous (now dissolved) system but their names remain. Popular areas for grammar schools are Argyll and Bute, East Lothian and South Lanarkshire.
* 13 are simply &quot;Schools&quot;. These schools cater for Primary as well as Secondary school children. They are found in rural areas or islands.
* 8 are &quot;Junior High Schools&quot;. These schools are found exclusively in the Orkney and Shetland Islands. They cater for school children from P1 to S4.
* 4 are &quot;Colleges&quot;. These include Madras College (in St Andrews, Fife), Marr College (in Troon, South Ayrshire) and St Joseph&#x27;s College (in Dumfries, Dumfries and Galloway).

Other schools include The Community School of Auchterarder, Auchterarder, Perth and Kinross; The Nicolson Institute, Stornoway, Western Isles and North Walls Community School on Hoy, Orkney Islands. All of these are, equally, fully comprehensive non-selective schools, differing only in designation from all other state secondary schools in Scotland.

==Attainment==

In 2015, the Scottish Government launched the Scottish Attainment Challenge which aims to achieve equity in educational outcomes throughout Scotland. The Scottish Government envisages equity being achieved by ensuring every child has the same opportunity to succeed, with a particular focus on closing the poverty-related attainment gap. It is underpinned by national Scottish educational policies such as Curriculum for Excellence, Getting it Right for Every Child (GIRFEC) as well as the National Improvement Framework. The attainment challenge focuses and accelerates targeted improvement activity in literacy, numeracy and health and wellbeing in specific areas of Scotland, known as &quot;challenge authorities&quot; (those councils with a higher percentage of children growing up in poverty and deprivation). At a cost of £750 million to the Scottish Government through the Attainment Scotland Fund, the challenge is a targeted initiative focused on supporting pupils in the local authorities of Scotland with the highest concentrations of deprivation. Currently, the nine &#x27;Challenge Authorities&#x27; are Glasgow City Council, Dundee City Council, Inverclyde, West Dunbartonshire, North Ayrshire, Clackmannanshire, North Lanarkshire, East Ayrshire and Renfrewshire.

On 1 February 2017 the share each primary and secondary school will receive for the academic year 2017–2018 from the Scottish Government&#x27;s £120 million Pupil Equity Funding was announced by the Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills John Swinney. This funding is provided through the Attainment Scotland Fund and allocated directly to schools, targeted at those children most affected by the poverty related attainment gap.

===Literacy and numeracy===
The SNP-led government launched the Scottish Survey of Literacy and Numeracy in 2011. The survey showed a sustained decline in basic literacy and numeracy among school pupils over six years. It was then scrapped by the government and its measures of literacy were replaced in part with a system based on teacher judgements. The teacher judgement data from December 2018 indicated that 70% of pupils achieved the expected literacy level by the end of primary school.

The government withdrew Scotland from the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study in 2010, making international comparisons of literacy difficult. It remains part of the Programme for International Student Assessment, which shows that Scotland&#x27;s international standing in reading and mathematics (as well as science) in schools fell between the first decade of the century and 2018.

The Scottish Survey of Adult Literacies in 2009 reported that 26.7% of adults in Scotland &quot;may face occasional challenges and constrained opportunities due to their literacy difficulties, but will generally cope with their day-to-day lives&quot;. Of that group, 3.6% &quot;face serious challenges in their literacy practices&quot;.

===Music education===
Music education is available at several levels. Formal music education begins at 4½ years and can progress as high as postgraduate studies. Music education can take place within a Scottish Music school; through a music service or privately.

===Scottish Gaelic medium education===

Some schools in Scotland provide education given in the Scottish Gaelic language. They are mainly located in the main cities of Scotland and in areas with higher numbers of Gaelic speakers. Gaelic medium education is becoming increasingly popular throughout Scotland, and the number of pupils who are in Gaelic medium education at primary school level has risen from 24 in 1985, to 2500 in the 2012–13 school year.

==Further education==
Further education is provided through a network of further education colleges available to people having reached the end of compulsory education at 16. In the early 2010s, colleges were merged to form larger, regional institutions.

Colleges offer a wide range of vocational qualifications to young people and older adults, including vocational, competency-based qualifications (previously known as SVQs), Higher National Certificates and Higher National Diplomas. In Scotland, FE college students receiving certain qualifications – frequently HNC and HND qualifications in a relevant subject – can apply for entry at a later stage at university.

Further education colleges also provide support to apprenticeship programmes, which are coordinated by the public body Skills Development Scotland.

==Higher education==

There are fifteen universities in Scotland and three other institutions of higher education which have the authority to award academic degrees. The oldest is St. Andrews, which was founded in 1413. Three other &quot;ancient universities&quot;, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh, date from before 1600. The University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) gained full university status in 2011, having been created through the federation of 13 colleges and research institutions across the Highlands and Islands, a process that began in 2001.

All Scottish universities have the power to award degrees at all levels: undergraduate, taught postgraduate, and doctoral. Education in Scotland is controlled by the Scottish Government under the terms of the Scotland Act 1998. The minister responsible for higher education is the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills, currently Jenny Gilruth MSP of the Scottish National Party. University status in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom today is conferred by the Privy Council which takes advice from the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education.

All Scottish universities are public universities and funded by the Scottish Government (through its Scottish Funding Council) and financial support is provided for Scottish-domiciled students by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland. Students ordinarily resident in Scotland do not pay tuition fees for their first undergraduate degree, but tuition fees are charged for those from the rest of the United Kingdom. All students are required to pay tuition fees for postgraduate education (e.g. MSc, PhD), except in certain priority areas funded by the Scottish Government, or if another source of funding can be found (e.g. research council studentship for a PhD). A representative body called Universities Scotland works to promote Scotland&#x27;s universities, as well as six other higher education institutions.

The university sector in Scotland had a total income of £3.5 billion in 2014/15 with the Scottish Government giving approximately £623 million in funding for individual university student support. The Scottish Funding Council contributing £1.1 billion of public money to the fifteen universities, this was a six per cent reduction since 2010/11.

In 2014–15, approximately 232,570 students studied at universities or institutes of higher education in Scotland, of which 56% were female and 44% male, with 66% being domiciled in Scotland, 12% from the rest of the United Kingdom, 9% from the EU and the remaining 13% being international students. Of all these, approximately 76% were studying for their first degree (i.e. undergraduate level) and 24% for a taught postgraduate degree (primarily a master&#x27;s degree) or a doctoral research degree (primarily PhD). The remainder were mostly on other programmes such as Higher National Diploma. 16,000 students were studying in Scotland with The Open University via distance-learning, and the Open University teaches 40 per cent of Scotland&#x27;s part-time undergraduates.

In the 2019 QS World University Rankings, three Scottish universities are among the top 100 worldwide: University of Edinburgh (at 18), University of Glasgow (at 69), University of St. Andrews (at 97). Other high ranked universities are the University of Aberdeen (at 172), University of Strathclyde (at 268), University of Dundee (at 272), Heriot-Watt University (at 302) and University of Stirling (at 417).

Tuition fees are handled by the Student Awards Agency Scotland (SAAS), which pays the fees of what it defines as &quot;Young Students&quot;. Young Students are defined as those under 25, without children, marriage, civil partnership or cohabiting partner, who have not been outside of full-time education for more than three years. Fees must be paid by those outside the young student definition, typically from £1,200 to £1,800 for undergraduate courses, dependent on year of application and type of qualification. Postgraduate fees can be up to £3,400. The system has been in place since 2007 when graduate endowments were abolished.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2008/02/28172530&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Labour&#x27;s education spokesperson Rhona Brankin criticised the Scottish system for failing to address student poverty.

Scotland&#x27;s universities are complemented in the provision of Further and Higher Education by 43 colleges. Colleges offer National Certificates, Higher National Certificates, and Higher National Diplomas. These Group Awards, alongside Scottish Vocational Qualifications, aim to ensure Scotland&#x27;s population has the appropriate skills and knowledge to meet workplace needs. In 2014, research reported by the Office for National Statistics found that Scotland was the most highly educated country in Europe and among the most well-educated in the world in terms of tertiary education attainment, with roughly 40% of people in Scotland aged 16–64 educated to NVQ level 4 and above. Based on the original data for EU statistical regions, all four Scottish regions ranked significantly above the European average for completion of tertiary-level education by 25- to 64-year-olds.

<text>This article provides an overview of education in Wales from early childhood to university and adult skills. Largely state-funded and freely accessible at a primary and secondary level, education is compulsory for children in Wales between ages 5-16 years old. It differs to some extent in structure and content to other parts of the United Kingdom, in the later case particularly in relation to the teaching of the Welsh language.

State-funded nursery education is typically offered from age three. Children usually enter fulltime primary school at age four, enter secondary school at age eleven and take their GCSEs at age 16. After that, young people have the option of staying at school to study A-levels or enrolling in further education. From the age of 18, they might enroll at university.

Formal education was originally a luxury, then provided by charity and later through the state. Universal primary education was established by the end of the 19th century and universal secondary education was reached by the mid 20th century. Attitudes to the Welsh language in education have varied overtime.

== History ==
Early forms of formal education were church or privately run and available to only a small segment of the population. In the 17th and 18th Centuries significant efforts were made, mainly by charitable causes, to expand access to basic education. In the 19th Century a state education system developed. By the end of the period education had become free and compulsory for children aged 5- to 12-years-old. Further increases to the school leaving age and the development of a system of secondary schools led by the mid 20th century to universal secondary education. Separate secondary schools for students of different academic abilities ended by 1980. Control over education policy was placed under the control of the devolved Welsh government in 1999.

==Structure==

=== Early years care and education ===

From the start of the January, April or September (whichever comes soonest) following a child&#x27;s third birthday they become eligible for a minimum of ten hours a week in publicly funded nursery education. Nursery lessons are focused on developing children&#x27;s abilities in a variety of areas such as creativity, communication and general knowledge however, at this age, learning to read and write is not yet considered a priority. Depending on their parents economic and employment status children in this age-range may be eligible for up to twenty additional hours of state-subsidised childcare each week.

According to statistics for the 2021/2022 school year most state-funded primary schools in Wales and all separate infant schools included nursery provision. There were also eight separate nursery schools which are owned and run by the Local authority. The hours of state-funded childcare a child is entitled to can also be provided by other childcare facilities. According to a 2018 report, there were 4,012 such facilities registered in 2016, it also noted that &quot;The majority of childcare providers are childminders (52%). The remaining childcare provision is delivered by sessional day care settings (20%), full day care settings (17%), out of school care settings (10%), open access play provision (1%) and crèches (0.5%).&quot;

The Welsh government is planning to introduce universal state funded childcare for two-year-old children by the mid-2020s. Currently, only the most disadvantaged toddlers in this age group and those in some more deprived areas are entitled to 12.5 hours of care provided by the state.

===Compulsory schooling===

A child&#x27;s age on 1 September determines the point of entry into the relevant stage of education. Education is compulsory beginning with the term following the child&#x27;s fifth birthday, but may take place at either home or school. Most parents choosing to educate through school-based provision, however, enrol their children in the reception year in September of that school year, with most children thus beginning school at age four or four and a half. This age was traditionally much earlier than in most other Western nations, but in recent years many European countries have lowered their age of compulsory education, usually by making one or more years of kindergarten compulsory.

====Primary education====

In 2014/15, there were 1,330 primary schools in Wales with 273,400 pupils and 12,240 full-time equivalent (FTE) teachers. The teacher/pupil ratio was 1:22 and the average class size was 26 pupils. In 2015/16, there were 276,950 pupils in 1,310 primary schools – a rise of 3,550 since 2014/15.

In 2014/15, there were 435 Welsh-medium primary schools with 65,460 pupils, rising from 64,366 in 2013/14, but the number of Welsh-medium primary schools decreased from 444, due primarily to the closure of small rural schools.

Universal free school meals were introduced in Wales for children in the first year of primary school in September 2022. They are planned to be rolled out for all primary school children by 2024.

====Secondary education====

Children typically transfer from primary to secondary school between schools years six and seven, when they are 11 years old. In school year nine (or sometimes eight), pupils receive a chose of what subjects to continue their studies in, options must be available across multiple fields but vary between schools. Maths, English, Science and Welsh as a first or second language are compulsory whilst some schools may also make other subjects compulsory.

Pupils in secondary school take part in the compulsory GCSE and the non-compulsory A-level or BTEC qualifications at ages 15/16 and 17/18 respectively. Since 2007 the Welsh Baccalaureate Qualification has also been available as an option although it was ungraded until 2015.

In 2014/15 there were 207 secondary schools (a drop of six since 2013/14) in Wales with 182,408 pupils and 11,269 FTE teachers (a drop of 310 since 2013/14). The pupil/teacher ratio was 17:1, which has remained largely the same since 2000/01. In 2015/16, there were 178,650 pupils in 205 secondary schools – a drop of 3,700 since 2014/15. The same report found that in 2015/16, there were 8,000 pupils in 34 independent schools, 4,540 pupils in 32 independent special schools, and 730 pupils in 25 pupil referral units.

In 2014/15, there were 50 Welsh-medium secondary (a drop of 2 since 2013/14) schools with 36,485 pupils, dropping from 37,400 in 2013/14. In the same year, there were 4 Welsh-medium middle schools (a rise of 2 since 2013/14) with 2,448 pupils, a rise from 1,577 in 2013/14.

In 2016, 60.3% of Year 11 pupils (aged 16) achieved the Level 2 inclusive threshold (Level 2 including a grade A*-C in English or Welsh first language and Mathematics). 35.6% of pupils eligible for FSM (free school meals) achieved the L2 inclusive threshold. 66.9% of pupils achieved A*-C in maths. 70.4% of pupils achieved A*-C in either English or Welsh first language.

Wales has often performed poorly in PISA results, which compare the academic abilities of adolescents around the world. The 2018 tests saw Wales&#x27; results improving but remaining the weakest of the four education systems of the UK in all subjects.

===Further education===
Further education (FE) includes full- and part-time learning for people over compulsory school age, excluding higher education. Young people often enrol in FE as an alternative to staying at school after the age of 16. FE and publicly funded training in Wales is provided by 15 FE institutions in 2014/15 and a range of public, private and voluntary sector training providers, such as the Workers&#x27; Educational Association. Colleges vary in size and mission, and include general FE, tertiary and specialist institutions, including one Roman Catholic Sixth Form College and a residential adult education college. Many colleges offer leisure learning and training programmes designed to meet the needs of business. In 2014/15 there were 263,315 FE students in Wales spanning the entire availability of FE at multiple placements, including FE, HE (higher education), LA (local authority) Community, and work-based learning.

===Adult community learning===
Adult Community learning is a form of adult education or lifelong learning delivered and supported by local authorities in Wales. Programmes can be formal or informal, non-accredited or accredited, and vocational, academic or leisure orientated. In 2018–2019, there were 23,970 learners in Local Authority Community Learning.

===Higher education===

Students normally enter higher education (HE) from 18 onwards. Undergraduate students contribute £9,000 a year in fees, and are generally entitled to student loans and grants depending on their family&#x27;s economic situation for maintenance. The state does not control syllabi, but it does influence admission procedures and monitors standards through the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales.

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland all qualifications can be compared on a scale beginning with entry level and then followed by eight numbered levels, 1 is the equivalent of a weaker pass grade at GCSE and 8 the equivalent of a doctorate. Undergraduate degrees typically the first higher education qualifications available are usually level 4, 5 or 6. Students will generally need A-Levels or an equivalent at a certain grade to enroll on them but may be able to do a foundation year prior to starting if their grades are weaker. There are various types of undergraduate degree but the most common is a Bachelor&#x27;s degree which generally takes three years to complete and involves studying one or sometimes two subjects in detail. It is a level 6 qualification.

A postgraduate degree is a level 7 or 8 qualification. It can typically only be completed after an undergraduate degree has been completed. It is generally focused on a more specific topic rather than the more general subject taught at undergraduate level. These generally come in two types the &quot;taught&quot; degree which conducted more in the style of an undergraduate degree and &quot;research&quot; degree where the student directs their own study of a self-chosen question in a more independent manner. A master&#x27;s degree is the highest level of qualification.

In 2014/15 there were 145,735 enrolments at HE institutions in Wales, including 97,900 first degree and other undergraduates and 27,780 postgraduates. Welsh HE institutions had a total of 10,140 full-time and part-time staff.

== Governance ==

=== Local administration and individual schools ===
Unlike in England, where state schools are increasingly run in an Academy model where they are funded directly by the central government, state schools in Wales are overseen by local authorities. Local authority funded or maintained schools come in various different models. The Community school is owned and run by the local authority, the Voluntary controlled schools are owned by a charity with close oversight from the local authority, the Voluntary aided schools are owned by a charity with a greater degree of self-governance and the Foundation school is owned by a governing body or charity organisation with limited local authority oversight. In the second and third case the charity is usually a religious organisation, typically the Church in Wales or the Roman Catholic Church.

The curriculum being rolled out in Wales from 2022 onwards is intended to give individual schools more control over the instruction they provide and the autonomy to develop their own curricula within a basic set of guidelines.

==== Education Consortia ====
In 2014, there were four formal education consortia in Wales covering:
* North Wales (GwE) (Flintshire, Conwy, Wrexham, Gwynedd, Isle of Anglesey, Denbighshire)
* South West and Mid Wales (ERW) (Swansea, Neath Port Talbot, Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire, Powys, Ceredigion)
* Central South Wales (CSC) (Bridgend, Cardiff, Merthyr Tydfil, Rhondda Cynon Taff, Vale of Glamorgan)
* South East Wales (EAS) (Caerphilly, Monmouthshire, Newport, Blaenau Gwent, Torfaen)
The role of Education Consortia is to assist in school improvement in their respective regions. This includes areas such as the effectiveness of schools leadership, the quality of their teaching and pupils results. The South West and Mid Wales Consortia partially broke down in 2020 with Powys, Ceredigion and Neath Port Talbot all leaving. The former two councils then formed an informal partnership whilst Neath Port Talbot remained outside the Consortia system as of March 2022.

=== Welsh government oversight and Wales-wide institutions ===
The governance of education has been devolved in Wales since the creation of the Welsh assembly in 1999 along with other related policy areas such as Welsh language policy and local government. This has led to the creation of a somewhat distinctive education system. Wales has its own education inspectorate, qualifications regulator and curriculum.

=== UK government role and UK-wide institutions ===
The money the Welsh government has to spend in devolved areas is broadly pegged to money the UK government spends in equivalent areas in England through a system called the Barnett formula. However, the devolved administrations are not obliged to spend the money they receive in the same policy area as it was spent in England (e.g. the equivalent to money spent on health in England could be spent on education in Wales). More broadly Wales&#x27;s and the other UK education systems are all influenced by their interactions with reserved matters and coexistence within the United Kingdom.

== Welsh language ==
In the 19th century Welsh was often repressed by schools. In the 20th century the language gradually gained a more prominent role in the education system. 

A significant minority of students in Wales are educated largely through the medium of Welsh: in 2014/15, 15.7% of children and young people received Welsh-medium education – a drop from the 15.9% in 2010/11. An additional 10% attended schools in which significant portion of the curriculum is bilingual. The study of the Welsh language is available to all age groups through nurseries, schools, colleges, and universities, and in adult education. Though, involvement is fairly limited above secondary school level. The study of the language is compulsory for all pupils in State Schools until the age of 16. 

Educational institutions have flexibility over how much English children are taught prior to the age of seven. This is in order to allow Welsh medium schools and nurseries to immerse young children in the language as much as possible. In the later years of primary school, the curriculum at Welsh medium schools continues to be mostly (70% or more) taught in Welsh whilst at secondary level all subjects other than English are taught in Welsh. However, as they get older, students in Welsh medium education are required to work towards the same tests and qualifications in the English language as their counterparts who were primarily educated in English.

<text>The education system in Northern Ireland differs from elsewhere in the United Kingdom (although it is relatively similar to Wales), but is similar to the Republic of Ireland in sharing in the development of the &quot;national school&quot; system and serving a similar society with a relatively rural population. A child&#x27;s age on 1 July determines the point of entry into the relevant stage of education in the region, whereas the relevant date in England and Wales is 1 September.

== Overview ==
As with the island of Ireland as a whole, Northern Ireland has one of the youngest populations in Europe and, among the four UK nations, it has the highest proportion of children aged under 16 years (21% in mid-2019).

In the most recent full academic year (2021–2022), the region&#x27;s school education system comprised 1,124 schools (of all types) and around 346,000 pupils, including:
* 796 primary schools with 172,000 pupils;
* 192 post-primary schools with 152,000 pupils;
* 126 non-grammar post-primary schools with 86,000 pupils;
* 66 grammar schools with 65,000 pupils;
* 94 nursery schools with 5,800 pupils;
* 39 special schools with 6,600 pupils (specifically for children with special educational needs); and
* 14 independent schools with 700 children.

Enrolments in further and higher education were as follows (in 2019–2020) before disruption to enrolments and classes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic:
* six regional further education colleges with 132,000 students;
* two universities – Queen&#x27;s University Belfast and Ulster University – with 53,000 students;
* two teacher training colleges – Stranmillis University College and St Mary&#x27;s University College, Belfast – with 2,200 students;
* the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise with 1,700 students on three campuses; and
* the Open University with 4,200 students.

Statistics on education in Northern Ireland are published by the Department of Education and the Department for the Economy.

==History==
For the history prior to the partition of Ireland in the 1920s, see History of education in Ireland.

== Administration ==

Education is devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly and the government departments which are mainly responsible for education policy are assigned responsibilities according to the different levels of the education system. The Department of Education is responsible for pre-school, primary, post-primary and special education, youth work policy, the promotion of good community relations within and between schools, and teacher education and salaries. Further and higher education sits within the remit of the Department for the Economy and the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs as young people and adults at that stage are either employed or being prepared for entering employment.

The Education Authority (EA) is responsible for ensuring that nursery, primary and post-primary education services are available to meet the needs of children and young people and for providing support for youth services. The authority was established in 2015 and its services, in relation to education, were previously delivered by the five education and library boards (ELBs) from the 1970s onwards and by county councils before that time. Each of the former ELBs is now a sub-region of the Education Authority:

==Curriculum==

The majority of examinations sat, and education plans followed, in Northern Irish schools are set by the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations &amp; Assessment. All schools in Northern Ireland follow the &quot;Northern Ireland Curriculum&quot; which is based on the National Curriculum used in England and Wales. At age 11, on entering secondary education, all pupils study a broad base of subjects from the nine &#x27;Areas of Learning&#x27;: Language and Literacy, Mathematics and Numeracy, Modern Languages, The Arts, Environment and Society, Science and Technology, Learning for Life and Work, Physical Education, and Religious Education.
At age 14, pupils select which subjects to continue to study for General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) examinations. Currently, it is compulsory to study English Language and Mathematics, although subjects such as English Literature, French, Learning for Life and Work, Religious Studies and Science (single-, double- or triple-award) may also be compulsory in certain schools. In addition, pupils usually choose to continue with other subjects and many study for eight or nine GCSEs, and possibly up to ten or eleven. GCSEs mark the end of compulsory education in Northern Ireland.

At age 16, some pupils stay at school and choose to study A-Level – AS and A2 – level subjects or more vocational qualifications such as Applied Advanced Levels; many also take up vocational courses at further education colleges on leaving school. Those choosing AS and A2 levels normally pick three or four subjects and success in these can determine acceptance into higher education courses at university.

== Levels of education ==

Pre-primary education is optional in Northern Ireland with preschool stage for children aged 3 and 4. In some pre-schools, pupils can leave when they turn 4 and enter into an optional Reception class in their local primary school. (This is entirely optional in most schools which provide these classes.)

Primary education covers three stages – Foundation, Key Stage 1, and Key Stage 2.

* Foundation Stage
** Reception, age 4 (optional; see above note)
** Primary 1, age 4 to 5 (equivalent to Reception in England and Wales)
** Primary 2, age 5 to 6
* Key Stage 1
** Primary 3, age 6 to 7
** Primary 4, age 7 to 8
* Key Stage 2
** Primary 5, age 8 to 9
** Primary 6, age 9 to 10
** Primary 7, age 10 to 11

Post-primary (or secondary) education covers up to three stages – Key Stage 3, Key Stage 4, and Key Stage 5:

* Key Stage 3
** Year 8, age 11 to 12 (equivalent to Year 7 in England and Wales)
** Year 9, age 12 to 13
** Year 10, age 13 to 14
* Key Stage 4
** Year 11, age 14 to 15
** Year 12, age 15 to 16 (including GCSE examinations)
* Key Stage 5
** Year 13, age 16 to 17 (including AS-level examinations)
** Year 14, age 17 to 18 (including A-level A2 examinations)

Although the Department of Education uses &quot;Year 8 to Year 14&quot; for post-primary education, the traditional &quot;First&quot; to &quot;Fifth Form&quot;, &quot;Lower Sixth&quot; and &quot;Upper Sixth&quot; are still used, at least informally, by some schools. Young people may continue their education at a post-primary school (often a grammar school) or at a further education college after Key Stage 4. A range of tertiary education qualifications are available through further education colleges, universities and other institutions, including at bachelor&#x27;s degree, master&#x27;s degree and doctorate levels.

==Post-primary transfer==
Most primary school children will transfer to non-grammar post-primary schools. However, issues around post-primary transfer and academic selection receive a high level of media coverage, as many parents regard a place for their child in a grammar school as a form of social mobility. In 2021–2022, 57% of young people in post-primary education (87,000 pupils) attended non-grammar schools and 43% attended grammar schools (65,000 pupils).

The Education Act (Northern Ireland) 1947 introduced a school system which included a government-run eleven-plus post-primary transfer test as an entrance exam for grammar schools; this had previously been introduced in England and Wales in 1944. The test, a form of academic selection, was retained in Northern Ireland whereas England and Wales moved towards a comprehensive school system, which is also in place in Scotland. The differences in political opinion regarding academic selection, with unionists generally in favour and nationalists and the Alliance Party broadly opposed, reflect differences between Conservative and Labour in Great Britain; a Conservative government introduced the eleven-plus in the 1940s and a Labour government introduced comprehensive schooling in the 1970s.

As Minister of Education in the first Northern Ireland Assembly after the Good Friday Agreement, Martin McGuinness commissioned a review of post-primary transfer – the Burns report – which (in 2001) proposed the ending of the eleven-plus (and academic selection in post-primary transfer) and a system of &quot;formative assessment&quot; through a pupil profile to provide a wider range of educational information to teachers, parents and pupils. In the subsequent public consultation, a majority of respondents favoured the abolition of eleven-plus tests, but not the end of academic selection, and most wanted all schools to use the same criteria for entry with parental preference to be the most important criterion.

The Assembly was suspended in November 2002 and, under direct rule, Education Minister Jane Kennedy commissioned a post-primary transfer working group, chaired by Steve Costello, which reported in 2004 and broadly supported the Burns Report and recommended a broader curriculum through a model known as the &quot;entitlement framework&quot;. The Assembly was restored in March 2007 and then Education Minister Caitríona Ruane reaffirmed the decision by her predecessors to abolish the eleven-plus; the last government-run test took place in 2008. The majority of grammar schools, however, decided to set their own entrance exams which, at present, are available in two types – AQE and GL Assessment – although a single test is planned from 2023 onwards.

==School sectors by ethos==
===Controlled===

&quot;Controlled schools&quot; are so-called as their governance is controlled by the state (e.g. through the Education Authority as the employer of teachers) although schools are managed by their board of governors, which include representatives of parents, teachers and &quot;transferor&quot; churches (who transferred their control of schools to the state in the mid-20th century). Controlled schools are open to children of all faiths and none.

Many controlled schools were originally church schools – under the management of the Church of Ireland, Presbyterian Church in Ireland and Methodist Church in Ireland – whose control was transferred in the 1930s and 1940s in return for assurances that a Christian ethos would continue through collective worship (school assemblies), the teaching of non-denominational religious education, and representation of churches on boards of governors. The three churches have a role in education through the Transferor Representatives&#x27; Council (TRC) and nominate around 1,500 school governors to the boards of controlled schools. In a more recent development, &quot;controlled integrated&quot; schools are those which have opted for a formally integrated status and therefore form part of both the controlled and integrated schools sectors.

The Education Act 2014, which created the Education Authority in the following year, was accompanied by a commitment by the Education Minister and the Northern Ireland Executive to establish and fund a support body for schools in the controlled sector. The Controlled Schools&#x27; Support Council (CSSC) therefore became operational in 2016; its headquarters are in Stranmillis University College, Belfast. Membership of the council is voluntary and over 90% of controlled schools are members of the CSSC.

In 2021–2022, there were 379 primary schools, 63 nursery schools, 53 secondary (non-grammar) schools and 16 grammar schools in the controlled sector – a total of 511 schools. These included 24 controlled integrated primary schools, five secondary schools and one nursery school with controlled integrated status, and two Irish medium schools. Around 147,000 pupils attended controlled schools (including 8,000 in controlled integrated schools), representing approximately 42% of all pupils in Northern Ireland. In terms of religious breakdown, 59% of pupils in controlled schools were Protestant, 11% were Catholic, and 30% were from other backgrounds.

===Catholic maintained===

Catholic &quot;maintained&quot; schools have a Roman Catholic ethos and are maintained by state funding, although the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) – established through the Education Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 – employs teachers in the sector as well as representing its interests. The membership of the CCMS includes representatives of the Department of Education, trustees (Catholic bishops in Northern Ireland), parents (drawn from the local community on a voluntary basis) and teachers. The Catholic Schools&#x27; Trustee Service (CTSS) provides teachers, clergy and others interested in Catholic education with resources, guidance and policies to assist them in their work, and highlights the Catholic ethos in education in both the maintained and voluntary grammar sectors.

In 2021–2022, there were 442 Catholic maintained schools – 355 primary schools, 56 post-primary (non-grammar) schools, and 31 nursery schools – with a total of 124,000 pupils, representing around 35% of all pupils; 93% of pupils in the sector were from a Catholic background.

===Voluntary grammar===

Voluntary grammar schools are self-governing schools and generally of long standing, having originally established to provide an academic education at post primary level on a fee-paying basis. These schools are now funded by the department and managed by boards of governors which are constituted in accordance with each school&#x27;s scheme of management – usually representatives of foundation governors, parents, and teachers and in most cases, representatives of the department or the Education Authority. The board of governors is the employing authority and is responsible for the employment of all staff in its school.

There were 50 voluntary grammar schools in 2021–2022 with around 51,000 pupils. The sector included 29 schools under Catholic management with 30,000 pupils and 21 under other forms of management with 21,000 pupils; 95% of pupils attending Catholic voluntary schools are from a Catholic background and 57% of pupils attending other voluntary schools are from a Protestant background. The Governing Bodies Association represents the interests of voluntary grammar schools.

===Integrated===
&quot;Grant-maintained integrated&quot; schools are those which have been established by the voluntary efforts of parents (such as the first formally integrated school, Lagan College, which was founded in 1981). &quot;Controlled integrated&quot; schools are controlled schools which have opted to have integrated status following a &quot;transformation&quot; process with the approval of parents. While parents, rather than churches, took the initiative in the development of grant-maintained integrated schools, the older controlled integrated schools (for example, those built in the 1930s and 1940s) were founded by Protestant churches before their transfer to the state in the mid-20th century.

The Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education (NICIE), a voluntary organisation, promotes, develops and supports integrated education, through the medium of English. The Integrated Education Fund (IEF) is a trust fund for the development and growth of integrated education in the region in response to parental demand. The IEF seeks to bridge the financial gap between starting integrated schools and securing full government funding and support. It was established in 1998 with funding from EU Structural Funds, the Department of Education, the Nuffield Foundation, and the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust. The IEF financially supports the establishment of new schools, the growth of existing schools, and those schools seeking to become integrated.

In 2021–2022, there were 38 grant-maintained integrated schools (23 primary and 15 post-primary) and 30 controlled integrated schools (24 primary, five post-primary and one nursery); all post-primary schools in the sector are non-grammar, however, three schools (Lagan College, Strangford College and Slemish College) accept a percentage of pupils based on grammar level ability (SEAG scoring). There were around 18,000 pupils in grant-maintained integrated schools and 8,000 pupils in controlled integrated schools, therefore around 26,000 pupils in 68 schools across the sector. The community backgrounds of pupils in grant-maintained integrated schools were 40% Catholic, 32% Protestant and 27% other, whereas the proportions for controlled integrated schools were 41% Protestant, 23% Catholic and 36% other.

===Irish-medium maintained===
The Education (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 placed a duty on the Department of Education, similar to that already in existence in relation to integrated education through the 1989 Education Reform Order, &quot;to encourage and facilitate the development of Irish-medium education&quot;. Pupils are usually taught most subjects through the medium of Irish, which is the second language of most of the pupils, whilst English is taught through English. This form of education has been described as Immersion education, and is now firmly established as a successful and effective form of bilingual education. It aims to develop a high standard of language competence in the immersion language (Irish) across the curriculum, but must also, and can, ensure a similar level of achievement in the first language (in this case, usually English) as that reached by pupils attending monolingual English medium schools.

Irish-medium schools, or &quot;Gaelscoileanna&quot;, are able to achieve grant-aided status, under the same procedures as other schools, by applying for maintained status. In addition to free-standing schools, Irish language medium education can be provided through units in existing schools; unit arrangements permit Irish-language-medium education to be supported where a free-standing school would not be viable. A unit may operate as a self-contained provision under the management of a host English-medium school and usually on the same site. In addition to this, there are two independent schools teaching through the medium of Irish. These are Gaelscoil Ghleann Darach in Crumlin and Gaelscoil na Daróige in Derry City.

Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta (CnaG) is the representative body for Irish-medium education, and was set up in 2000 by the Department of Education to promote, facilitate and encourage Irish-medium education. One of CnaG&#x27;s central objectives is to seek to extend the availability of Irish-medium education to parents who wish to avail of it for their children, and it is supported in this role by Iontaobhas na Gaelscolaíochta (the trust fund for Irish-medium education.

In 2021–2022, there were 25 primary schools and two post-primary schools (both non-grammar) in the Irish-medium maintained sector, with around 5,000 pupils, and 10 Irish-medium units, educating around 1,500 pupils; pre-school education is also available in the Irish language.

==School buildings==
Plans for investment in Northern Ireland schools and youth facilities were published in 2005, intended to address a reported problem of &quot;historic under-investment&quot;. The &quot;Investment Strategy for Northern Ireland 2005–2015&quot; was published on 14 December 2005. To offer sufficient construction companies an opportunity to support this strategy, the Department of Education established the &quot;Northern Ireland Schools Modernisation Programme (&quot;NISMP&quot;), with companies invited to express interest in works contracts in 2007.

==Further and higher education==
Northern Ireland provides a wide range of options for further and higher education through its universities, regional colleges (for further education), and other specialist colleges for teacher training and the agri-food sector. The Open University and regional colleges, in particular, enroll large numbers of adult learners. Many young people choose to travel to Great Britain to continue their education although this has, for many years, caused concern about a &#x27;brain drain&#x27; effect and the difficulty in retaining skills and knowledge in the region&#x27;s economy. The relatively low cost of living and higher quality of life in smaller and closer-knit communities, though, is an attraction for many students and graduates from Britain, the rest of Ireland and elsewhere.

In 2019–2020, the last year before disruption to school exams by the Covid-19 pandemic, 48% of school leavers in Northern Ireland entered higher education, 29% entered further education, 10% entered training, 9% entered employment, 3% became unemployed and the destination for a further 2% was unknown.

<doc id="355738" wikidata="Q1187072" url="?curid=355738" title="Texas annexation">
<text>The Republic of Texas was annexed into the United States and admitted to the Union as the 28th state on December 29, 1845.

The Republic of Texas declared independence from the Republic of Mexico on March 2, 1836. It applied for annexation to the United States the same year, but was rejected by the United States Secretary of State. At that time, the majority of the Texian population favored the annexation of the Republic by the United States. The leadership of both major U.S. political parties (the Democrats and the Whigs) opposed the introduction of Texas — a vast slave-holding region — into the volatile political climate of the pro- and anti-slavery sectional controversies in Congress. Moreover, they wished to avoid a war with Mexico, whose government had outlawed slavery and refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of its rebellious northern province. With Texas&#x27;s economic fortunes declining by the early 1840s, the President of the Texas Republic, Sam Houston, arranged talks with Mexico to explore the possibility of securing official recognition of independence, with the United Kingdom mediating.

In 1843, U.S. President John Tyler, then unaligned with any political party, decided independently to pursue the annexation of Texas in a bid to gain a base of support for another four years in office. His official motivation was to outmaneuver suspected diplomatic efforts by the British government for the emancipation of slaves in Texas, which would undermine slavery in the United States. Through secret negotiations with the Houston administration, Tyler secured a treaty of annexation in April 1844. When the documents were submitted to the U.S. Senate for ratification, the details of the terms of annexation became public and the question of acquiring Texas took center stage in the presidential election of 1844. Pro-Texas-annexation southern Democratic delegates denied their anti-annexation leader Martin Van Buren the nomination at their party&#x27;s convention in May 1844. In alliance with pro-expansion northern Democratic colleagues, they secured the nomination of James K. Polk, who ran on a pro-Texas Manifest destiny platform.

In June 1844, the Senate, with its Whig majority, soundly rejected the Tyler–Texas treaty. Later that year, the pro-annexation Democrat Polk narrowly defeated anti-annexation Whig Henry Clay in the 1844 presidential election. In December 1844, lame-duck President Tyler called on Congress to pass his treaty by simple majorities in each house. The Democratic-dominated House of Representatives complied with his request by passing an amended bill expanding on the pro-slavery provisions of the Tyler treaty. The Senate narrowly passed a compromise version of the House bill, designed to provide President-elect Polk the options of immediate annexation of Texas or new talks to revise the annexation terms of the House-amended bill.

On March 1, 1845, President Tyler signed the annexation bill, and on March 3 (his last full day in office), he forwarded the House version to Texas, offering immediate annexation. When Polk took office at noon the following day, he encouraged Texas to accept Tyler’s offer. Texas ratified the agreement with popular approval from Texians. The bill was signed by President Polk on December 29, 1845, accepting Texas as the 28th state of the Union. Texas formally joined the union on February 19, 1846, prompting the Mexican–American War in April of that year.

==Background information==
===U.S. territorial expansion and Texas===
First mapped by Spain in 1519, for over 300 years Texas was part of the vast Spanish Empire seized by the Spanish conquistadores from its indigenous people. The US-Spain border along the northern frontier of Texas took shape in the 1817–1819 negotiations between Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and the Spanish ambassador to the United States, Luis de Onís. The boundaries of Texas were determined within the larger geostrategic struggle to demark the limits of the United States&#x27; extensive western lands and of Spain&#x27;s vast possessions in North America. The Florida Purchase Treaty of February 22, 1819 emerged as a compromise that excluded Spain from the lower Columbia River drainage basin, but established southern boundaries at the Sabine and Red Rivers, &quot;legally extinguish[ing]&quot; any American claims to Texas. Nonetheless, Texas remained an object of fervent interest to American expansionists, among them Thomas Jefferson, who anticipated the eventual acquisition of its fertile lands.

The Missouri crisis of 1819–1821 sharpened commitments to expansionism among the country&#x27;s slaveholding interests, when the so-called Thomas proviso established the 36°30&#x27; parallel, imposing free-soil and slave-soil futures in the Louisiana Purchase lands. While a majority of southern congressmen acquiesced to the exclusion of slavery from the bulk of the Louisiana Purchase, a significant minority objected. Virginian editor Thomas Ritchie of the &quot;Richmond Enquirer&quot; predicted that with the proviso restrictions, the South would ultimately require Texas: &quot;If we are cooped up on the north, we must have elbow room to the west.&quot; Representative John Floyd of Virginia in 1824 accused Secretary of State Adams of conceding Texas to Spain in 1819 in the interests of Northern anti-slavery advocates, and so depriving the South of additional slave states. Then-Representative John Tyler of Virginia invoked the Jeffersonian precepts of territorial and commercial growth as a national goal to counter the rise of sectional differences over slavery. His &quot;diffusion&quot; theory declared that with Missouri open to slavery, the new state would encourage the transfer of underutilized slaves westward, emptying the eastern states of bondsmen and making emancipation feasible in the old South. This doctrine would be revived during the Texas annexation controversy.

When Mexico won its independence from Spain in 1821, the United States did not contest the new republic&#x27;s claims to Texas, and both presidents John Quincy Adams (1825–1829) and Andrew Jackson (1829–1837) persistently sought, through official and unofficial channels, to procure all or portions of provincial Texas from the Mexican government, without success.

===Texas settlement and independence===


Spanish and indigenous immigrants, primarily from northeastern provinces of New Spain, began to settle Texas in the late 17th century. The Spanish constructed Catholic missions and presidios in what is today Louisiana, east Texas, and south Texas. The first missions were designed for the Tejas Indians, near Los Adaes. Soon thereafter, the San Antonio Missions were founded along the San Antonio River. The City of San Antonio, then known as San Fernando de Bexar, was founded in 1718. In the early 1760s, José de Escandón created five settlements along the Rio Grande River, including Laredo.

Anglo-American immigrants, primarily from the Southern United States, began emigrating to Mexican Texas in the early 1820s at the invitation of the Texas faction of the Coahuila y Tejas state government, which sought to populate the sparsely inhabited lands of its northern frontier for cotton production. Colonizing empresario Stephen F. Austin managed the regional affairs of the mostly American-born population – 20% of them slaves – under the terms of the generous government land grants. Mexican authorities were initially content to govern the remote province through salutary neglect, &quot;permitting slavery under the legal fiction of &#x27;permanent indentured servitude&#x27;, similar to Mexico&#x27;s peonage system.

A general lawlessness prevailed in the vast Texas frontier, and Mexico&#x27;s laws went largely unenforced among the Anglo-American settlers. In particular, the prohibitions against slavery and forced labor, as well as the requirement that all settlers be Catholic or convert to Catholicism were ignored. Mexican authorities, perceiving that they were losing control over Texas and alarmed by the unsuccessful Fredonian Rebellion of 1826, abandoned the policy of benign rule. New restrictions were imposed in 1829–1830, outlawing slavery throughout the nation and terminating further American immigration to Texas. Military occupation followed, sparking local uprisings. Texas conventions in 1832 and 1833 submitted petitions for redress of grievances to overturn the restrictions, with limited success. In 1835, an army under Mexican President Santa Anna entered its territory of Texas and abolished self-government. Texians responded by declaring their independence from Mexico on March 2, 1836. On April 20–21, rebel forces under Texas General Sam Houston defeated the Mexican army at the Battle of San Jacinto. In June 1836 while held prisoner by the Texians, Santa Anna signed an agreement for Texas independence, but the Mexican government refused to ratify the agreement made under duress. Texians, now &quot;de facto&quot; independent, recognized that their security and prosperity could never be achieved while Mexico denied the legitimacy of their revolution.

In the years following independence, the migration of white settlers and importation of black slave labor into the vast republic was deterred by Texas&#x27;s unresolved international status and the threat of renewed warfare with Mexico. American citizens who considered migrating to the new republic perceived that &quot;life and property were safer within the United States&quot; than in an independent Texas. In the 1840s, global oversupply had also caused a crash in the price of cotton, the country&#x27;s main export commodity. The situation led to labor shortages, reduced tax revenue, large national debts and a diminished Texas militia.

==Jackson and Van Buren administrations==
The Anglo-American immigrants residing in newly independent Texas overwhelmingly desired immediate annexation by the United States. But, despite his strong support for Texas independence from Mexico, then-President Andrew Jackson delayed recognizing the new republic until the last day of his presidency to avoid raising the issue during the 1836 general election. Jackson&#x27;s political caution was dictated by northern concerns that Texas could potentially form several new slave states and undermine the North-South balance in Congress.

Jackson&#x27;s successor, President Martin Van Buren, viewed Texas annexation as an immense political liability that would empower the anti-slavery northern Whig opposition – especially if annexation provoked a war with Mexico. Presented with a formal annexation proposal from Texas minister Memucan Hunt Jr. in August 1837, Van Buren summarily rejected it. Annexation resolutions presented separately in each house of Congress were either soundly defeated or tabled through filibuster. In 1838, Texas President Mirabeau B. Lamar withdrew his republic&#x27;s offer of annexation over these failures. Texians were at an annexation impasse when John Tyler entered the White House in 1841.

==Tyler administration==
William Henry Harrison, Whig Party presidential nominee, defeated US President Martin Van Buren in the 1840 general election. Upon Harrison&#x27;s death shortly after his inauguration, Vice-President John Tyler assumed the presidency. President Tyler was expelled from the Whig party in 1841 for repeatedly vetoing their domestic finance legislation. Tyler, isolated and outside the two-party mainstream, turned to foreign affairs to salvage his presidency, aligning himself with a southern states&#x27; rights faction that shared his fervent slavery expansionist views.

In his first address to Congress in special session on June 1, 1841, Tyler set the stage for Texas annexation by announcing his intention to pursue an expansionist agenda so as to preserve the balance between state and national authority and to protect American institutions, including slavery, so as to avoid sectional conflict. Tyler&#x27;s closest advisors counseled him that obtaining Texas would assure him a second term in the White House, and it became a deeply personal obsession for the president, who viewed the acquisition of Texas as the &quot;primary objective of his administration&quot;. Tyler delayed direct action on Texas to work closely with his Secretary of State Daniel Webster on other pressing diplomatic initiatives.

With the Webster–Ashburton Treaty ratified in 1843, Tyler was ready to make the annexation of Texas his &quot;top priority&quot;. Representative Thomas W. Gilmer of Virginia was authorized by the administration to make the case for annexation to the American electorate. In a widely circulated open letter, understood as an announcement of the executive branch&#x27;s designs for Texas, Gilmer described Texas as a panacea for North-South conflict and an economic boon to all commercial interests. The slavery issue, however divisive, would be left for the states to decide as per the US Constitution. Domestic tranquility and national security, Tyler argued, would result from an annexed Texas; a Texas left outside American jurisdiction would imperil the Union. Tyler adroitly arranged the resignation of his anti-annexation Secretary of State Daniel Webster, and on June 23, 1843 appointed Abel P. Upshur, a Virginia states&#x27; rights champion and ardent proponent of Texas annexation. This cabinet shift signaled Tyler&#x27;s intent to pursue Texas annexation aggressively.

===Tyler–Upshur–Calhoun campaign for Texas===

In late September 1843, in an effort to cultivate public support for Texas, Secretary Upshur dispatched a letter to the US Minister to Great Britain, Edward Everett, conveying his displeasure with Britain&#x27;s global anti-slavery posture, and warning their government that forays into Texas&#x27;s affairs would be regarded as &quot;tantamount to direct interference &#x27;with the established institutions of the United States. In a breach of diplomatic norms, Upshur leaked the communique to the press to inflame popular Anglophobic sentiments among American citizens.

In the spring of 1843, the Tyler administration had sent executive agent Duff Green to Europe to gather intelligence and arrange territorial treaty talks with Great Britain regarding Oregon; he also worked with American minister to France, Lewis Cass, to thwart efforts by major European powers to suppress the maritime slave trade. Green reported to Secretary Upshur in July 1843 that he had discovered a &quot;loan plot&quot; by American abolitionists, in league with Lord Aberdeen, British Foreign Secretary, to provide funds to the Texans in exchange for the emancipation of its slaves. Minister Everett was charged with determining the substance of these confidential reports alleging a Texas plot. His investigations, including personal interviews with Lord Aberdeen, concluded that British interest in abolitionist intrigues was weak, contradicting Secretary of State Upshur&#x27;s conviction that Great Britain was manipulating Texas. Though unsubstantiated, Green&#x27;s unofficial intelligence so alarmed Tyler that he requested verification from the US minister to Mexico, Waddy Thompson Jr.

John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, a pro-slavery Democrat, counseled Secretary Upshur that British designs on American slavery were real and required immediate action to preempt a takeover of Texas by the United Kingdom. When Tyler confirmed in September that the British Foreign Secretary Aberdeen had encouraged détente between Mexico and Texas, allegedly pressing Mexico to maneuver Texas towards emancipation of its slaves, Tyler acted at once. On September 18, 1843, in consultation with Secretary Upshur, he ordered secret talks opened with Texas Minister to the United States Isaac Van Zandt to negotiate the annexation of Texas. Face-to-face negotiations commenced on October 16, 1843.

====Texas–Mexico–United Kingdom negotiations====

By the summer of 1843 Sam Houston&#x27;s Texas administration had returned to negotiations with the Mexican government to consider a rapprochement that would permit Texas self-governance, possibly as a state of Mexico, with Great Britain acting as mediator. Texas officials felt compelled by the fact that the Tyler administration appeared unequipped to mount an effective campaign for Texas annexation. With the 1844 United States presidential election approaching, the leadership in both the Democratic and Whig parties remained unequivocally opposed to the annexation of Texas. Texas-Mexico treaty options under consideration included an autonomous Texas within Mexico&#x27;s borders, or an independent republic with the provision that Texas should emancipate its slaves upon recognition.

Van Zandt, though he personally favored annexation by the United States, was not authorized to entertain any overtures from the US government on the subject. Texas officials were at the moment deeply engaged in exploring settlements with Mexican diplomats, facilitated by Great Britain. Texas&#x27;s predominant concern was not British interference with the institution of slavery – English diplomats had not alluded to the issue – but the avoidance of any resumption of hostilities with Mexico. Still, US Secretary of State Upshur vigorously exhorted Texas diplomats to begin annexation talks, finally dispatching an appeal to President Sam Houston in January 1844. In the appeal, Upshur assured Houston that the political climate in the United States was currently amenable to Texas statehood and that a two-thirds majority in Senate could be obtained to ratify a Texas treaty.

Texans were hesitant to pursue a US-Texas treaty without a written commitment of military defense from America, since a full-scale military attack by Mexico seemed likely when the negotiations became public. If ratification of the annexation measure stalled in the US Senate, Texas could face a war alone against Mexico. Because only Congress could declare war, the Tyler administration lacked the constitutional authority to commit the US to support of Texas. But when Secretary Upshur provided a verbal assurance of military defense, President Houston, responding to urgent calls for annexation from the Texas Congress of December 1843, authorized the reopening of annexation negotiations.

===The US–Texas treaty negotiations===


As Secretary Upshur accelerated the secret treaty discussions, Mexican diplomats learned that US-Texas talks were taking place. Mexican minister to the U.S. Juan Almonte confronted Upshur with these reports, warning him that if Congress sanctioned a treaty of annexation, Mexico would break diplomatic ties and immediately declare war. Secretary Upshur denied any knowledge of these reports and pressed forward with the negotiations. In tandem with moving forward with Texas diplomats, Upshur was secretly lobbying US senators to support annexation, providing lawmakers with persuasive arguments linking Texas acquisition to national security and domestic peace. In early 1844, Upshur assured Texas officials that 40 of the 52 members of the Senate were pledged to ratify the Tyler-Texas treaty — more than the two-thirds majority required for ratification. In his annual address to Congress in December 1843, Tyler maintained his silence with respect to the secret negotiations so as not to damage relations with the wary Texas diplomats. Throughout, Tyler did his utmost to keep the negotiations secret, making no public reference to his administration&#x27;s single-minded quest for Texas.

The Tyler-Texas treaty was in its final stages when its chief architects, Secretary Upshur and Secretary of the Navy Thomas W. Gilmer, died in an accident aboard USS &quot;Princeton&quot; on February 28, 1844, just a day after achieving a preliminary treaty draft agreement with the Texas Republic. The &quot;Princeton&quot; disaster proved a major setback for Texas annexation, in that Tyler expected Secretary Upshur to elicit critical support from Whig and Democratic Senators during the upcoming treaty ratification process. Tyler selected John C. Calhoun to replace Upshur as Secretary of State and to finalize the treaty with Texas. The choice of Calhoun, a highly regarded but controversial American statesman, risked introducing a politically polarizing element into the Texas debates, but Tyler prized him as a strong advocate of annexation.

====Robert J. Walker and the &quot;safety-valve&quot;====
With the Tyler-Upshur secret annexation negotiations with Texas near consummation, Senator Robert J. Walker of Mississippi, a key Tyler ally, issued a widely distributed and highly influential letter, reproduced as a pamphlet, making the case for immediate annexation. In it, Walker argued that Texas could be acquired by Congress in a number of ways – all constitutional – and that the moral authority to do so was based on the precepts for territorial expansion established by Jefferson and Madison, and promulgated as doctrine by Monroe in 1823. Senator Walker&#x27;s polemic offered analysis on the significance of Texas with respect to slavery and race. He envisioned Texas as a corridor through which both free and enslaved African-Americans could be &quot;diffused&quot; southward in a gradual exodus that would ultimately supply labor to the Central American tropics, and in time, empty the United States of its slave population.

This &quot;safety-valve&quot; theory &quot;appealed to the racial fears of northern whites&quot; who dreaded the prospect of absorbing emancipated slaves into their communities if the institution of slavery collapsed in the South. This scheme for racial cleansing was consistent, on a pragmatic level, with proposals for overseas colonization of blacks, which were pursued by a number of American presidents, from Jefferson to Lincoln. Walker bolstered his position by raising national security concerns, warning that in the event annexation failed, Great Britain would maneuver the Republic of Texas into emancipating its slaves, forecasting a dangerous destabilizing influence on southwestern slaveholding states. The pamphlet characterized abolitionists as traitors who conspired with the British to overthrow the United States.

A variation of the Tyler&#x27;s &quot;diffusion&quot; theory, it played on economic fears in a period when slave-based staple crop markets had not yet recovered from the Panic of 1837. The Texas &quot;escape route&quot; conceived by Walker promised to increase demand for slaves in fertile cotton-growing regions of Texas, as well as the monetary value of slaves. Cash-poor plantation owners in the older eastern South were promised a market for surplus slaves at a profit. Texas annexation, wrote Walker, would eliminate all these dangers and &quot;fortify the whole Union.&quot;

Walker&#x27;s pamphlet brought forth strident demands for Texas from pro-slavery expansionists in the South; in the North, it allowed anti-slavery expansionists to embrace Texas without appearing to be aligned with pro-slavery extremists. His assumptions and analysis &quot;shaped and framed the debates on annexation but his premises went largely unchallenged among the press and public.

==Tyler-Texas treaty and the election of 1844==
The Tyler-Texas treaty, signed on April 12, 1844, was framed to induct Texas into the Union as a territory, following constitutional protocols. To wit, Texas would cede all its public lands to the United States, and the federal government would assume all its bonded debt, up to $10 million. The boundaries of the Texas territory were left unspecified. Four new states could ultimately be carved from the former republic – three of them likely to become slave states. Any allusion to slavery was omitted from the document so as not to antagonize anti-slavery sentiments during Senate debates, but it provided for the &quot;preservation of all [Texas] property as secured in our domestic institutions.&quot;

Upon the signing of the treaty, Tyler complied with the Texans&#x27; demand for military and naval protection, deploying troops to Fort Jesup in Louisiana and a fleet of warships to the Gulf of Mexico. In case the Senate failed to pass the treaty, Tyler promised the Texas diplomats that he would officially exhort both houses of Congress to establish Texas as a state of the Union upon provisions authorized in the Constitution. Tyler&#x27;s cabinet was split on the administration&#x27;s handling of the Texas agreement. Secretary of War William Wilkins praised the terms of annexation publicly, touting the economic and geostrategic benefits with relation to Great Britain. Secretary of the Treasury John C. Spencer was alarmed at the constitutional implications of Tyler&#x27;s application of military force without congressional approval, a violation of the separation of powers. Refusing to transfer contingency funds for the naval mobilization, he resigned.

Tyler submitted his treaty for annexation to the Senate, delivered April 22, 1844, where a two-thirds majority was required for ratification. Secretary of State Calhoun (assuming his post March 29, 1844) had sent a letter to British minister Richard Packenham denouncing British anti-slavery interference in Texas. He included the Packenham Letter with the Tyler bill, intending to create a sense of crisis in Southern Democrats. In it, he characterized slavery as a social blessing and the acquisition of Texas as an emergency measure necessary to safeguard the &quot;peculiar institution&quot; in the United States. In doing so, Tyler and Calhoun sought to unite the South in a crusade that would present the North with an ultimatum: support Texas annexation or lose the South.

===Tyler and the Polk presidential nomination===

President Tyler expected that his treaty would be debated secretly in Senate executive session. However, less than a week after debates opened, the treaty, its associated internal correspondence, and the Packenham letter were leaked to the public. The nature of the Tyler-Texas negotiations caused a national outcry, in that &quot;the documents appeared to verify that the sole objective of Texas annexation was the preservation of slavery.&quot; A mobilization of anti-annexation forces in the North strengthened both major parties&#x27; hostility toward Tyler&#x27;s agenda. The leading presidential hopefuls of both parties, Democrat Martin Van Buren and Whig Henry Clay, publicly denounced the treaty. Texas annexation and the reoccupation of Oregon territory emerged as the central issues in the 1844 general election.

In response, Tyler, already ejected from the Whig party, quickly began to organize a third party in hopes of inducing the Democrats to embrace a pro-expansionist platform. By running as a third-party candidate, Tyler threatened to siphon off pro-annexation Democratic voters; Democratic party disunity would mean the election of Henry Clay, a staunchly anti-Texas Whig. Pro-annexation delegates among southern Democrats, with assistance from a number of northern delegates, blocked anti-expansion candidate Martin Van Buren at the convention, which instead nominated the pro-expansion champion of Manifest Destiny, James K. Polk of Tennessee. Polk unified his party under the banner of Texas and Oregon acquisition.

In August 1844, in the midst of the campaign, Tyler withdrew from the race. The Democratic Party was by then unequivocally committed to Texas annexation, and Tyler, assured by Polk&#x27;s envoys that as president he would effect Texas annexation, urged his supporters to vote Democratic. Polk narrowly defeated Whig Henry Clay in the November election. The victorious Democrats were poised to acquire Texas under President-elect Polk&#x27;s doctrine of Manifest Destiny, rather than on the pro-slavery agenda of Tyler and Calhoun.

==Congressional debate over annexation==

===Tyler-Texas Treaty defeat in the Senate===
As a treaty document with a foreign nation, the Tyler-Texas annexation treaty required the support of a two-thirds majority in the Senate for passage. But in fact, when the Senate voted on the measure on June 8, 1844, fully two-thirds voted against the treaty (16–35). The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted overwhelmingly in favor (15–8). The election campaign had hardened partisan positions on Texas among Democrats. Tyler had anticipated that the measure would fail, largely because of the divisive effects of Secretary Calhoun&#x27;s Packenham letter. Undeterred, he formally asked the House of Representatives to consider other constitutional means to authorize passage of the treaty. Congress adjourned before debating the matter.

===Reintroduction as a joint resolution===

The same Senate that had rejected the Tyler–Calhoun treaty by a margin of 2:1 in June 1844 reassembled in December 1844 in a short lame-duck session. (Though pro-annexation Democrats had made gains in the fall elections, those legislators – the 29th Congress – would not assume office until March 1845.) Lame-duck President Tyler, still trying to annex Texas in the final months of his administration, wished to avoid another overwhelming Senate rejection of his treaty. In his annual address to Congress on December 4, he declared the Polk victory a mandate for Texas annexation and proposed that Congress adopt a joint resolution procedure by which simple majorities in each house could secure ratification for the Tyler treaty. This method would avoid the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds majority in the Senate. Bringing the House of Representatives into the equation boded well for Texas annexation, as the pro-annexation Democratic Party possessed nearly a 2:1 majority in that chamber.

By resubmitting the discredited treaty through a House-sponsored bill, the Tyler administration reignited sectional hostilities over Texas admission. Both northern Democratic and southern Whig Congressmen had been bewildered by local political agitation in their home states during the 1844 presidential campaigns. Now, northern Democrats found themselves vulnerable to charges of appeasement of their southern wing if they capitulated to Tyler&#x27;s slavery expansion provisions. On the other hand, Manifest Destiny enthusiasm in the north placed politicians under pressure to admit Texas immediately to the Union.

Constitutional objections were raised in House debates as to whether both houses of Congress could constitutionally authorize admission of territories, rather than states. Moreover, if the Republic of Texas, a nation in its own right, were admitted as a state, its territorial boundaries, property relations (including slave property), debts and public lands would require a Senate-ratified treaty. Democrats were particularly uneasy about burdening the United States with $10 million in Texas debt, resenting the deluge of speculators, who had bought Texas bonds cheap and now lobbied Congress for the Texas House bill. House Democrats, at an impasse, relinquished the legislative initiative to the southern Whigs.

===Brown–Foster House amendment===

Anti-Texas Whig legislators had lost more than the White House in the general election of 1844. In the southern states of Tennessee and Georgia, Whig strongholds in the 1840 general election, voter support dropped precipitously over the pro-annexation excitement in the Deep South—and Clay lost every Deep South state to Polk. Northern Whigs&#x27; uncompromising hostility to slavery expansion increasingly characterized the party, and southern members, by association, had suffered from charges of being &quot;soft on Texas, therefore soft on slavery&quot; by Southern Democrats. Facing congressional and gubernatorial races in 1845 in their home states, a number of Southern Whigs sought to erase that impression with respect to the Tyler-Texas bill.

Southern Whigs in the Congress, including Representative Milton Brown and Senator Ephraim Foster, both of Tennessee, and Representative Alexander Stephens of Georgia collaborated to introduce a House amendment on January 13, 1845, that was designed to enhance slaveowner gains in Texas beyond those offered by the Democratic-sponsored Tyler-Calhoun treaty bill. The legislation proposed to recognize Texas as a slave state which would retain all its vast public lands, as well as its bonded debt accrued since 1836. Furthermore, the Brown amendment would delegate to the U.S. government responsibility for negotiating the disputed Texas-Mexico boundary. The issue was a critical one, as the size of Texas would be immensely increased if the international border were set at the Rio Grande River, with its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains, rather than the traditionally recognized boundary at the Nueces River, 100 miles to the north. While the Tyler-Calhoun treaty provided for the organization of a total of four states from the Texas lands – three likely to qualify as slave states – Brown&#x27;s plan would permit Texas state lawmakers to configure a total of five states from its western region, with those south of the 36°30’ Missouri Compromise line pre-authorized to permit slavery upon statehood, if Texas designated them as such.

Politically, the Brown amendment was designed to portray Southern Whigs as &quot;even more ardent champions of slavery and the South, than southern Democrats.&quot; The bill also served to distinguish them from their northern Whig colleagues who cast the controversy, as Calhoun did, in strictly pro- versus anti-slavery terms. While almost all Northern Whigs spurned Brown&#x27;s amendment, the Democrats quickly co-opted the legislation, providing the votes necessary to attach the proviso to Tyler&#x27;s joint resolution, by a 118–101 vote. Southern Democrats supported the bill almost unanimously (59–1), while Northern Democrats split strongly in favor (50–30). Eight of eighteen Southern Whigs cast their votes in favor. Northern Whigs unanimously rejected it. The House proceeded to approve the amended Texas treaty 120–98 on January 25, 1845. The vote in the House had been one in which party affiliation prevailed over sectional allegiance. The bill was forwarded the same day to the Senate for debate.

===Benton Senate compromise===
By early February 1845, when the Senate began to debate the Brown-amended Tyler treaty, its passage seemed unlikely, as support was &quot;perishing&quot;. The partisan alignments in the Senate were near parity, 28–24, slightly in favor of the Whigs. The Senate Democrats would require undivided support among their colleagues, and three or more Whigs who would be willing to cross party lines to pass the House-amended treaty. The fact that Senator Foster had drafted the House amendment under consideration improved prospects of Senate passage.

Anti-annexation Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri had been the only Southern Democrat to vote against the Tyler-Texas measure in June 1844. His original proposal for an annexed Texas had embodied a national compromise, whereby Texas would be divided in two, half slave-soil and half free-soil. As pro-annexation sentiment grew in his home state, Benton retreated from this compromise offer. By February 5, 1845, in the early debates on the Brown-amended House bill, he advanced an alternative resolution that, unlike the Brown scenario, made no reference whatsoever to the ultimate free-slave apportionment of an annexed Texas and simply called for five bipartisan commissioners to resolve border disputes with Texas and Mexico and set conditions for the Lone Star Republic&#x27;s acquisition by the United States.

The Benton proposal was intended to calm northern anti-slavery Democrats (who wished to eliminate the Tyler-Calhoun treaty altogether, as it had been negotiated on behalf of the slavery expansionists), and allow the decision to devolve upon the soon-to-be-inaugurated Democratic President-elect James K. Polk. President-elect Polk had expressed his ardent wish that Texas annexation should be accomplished before he entered Washington in advance of his inauguration on March 4, 1845, the same day Congress would end its session. With his arrival in the capital, he discovered the Benton and Brown factions in the Senate &quot;paralyzed&quot; over the Texas annexation legislation. On the advice of his soon-to-be Secretary of the Treasury Robert J. Walker, Polk urged Senate Democrats to unite under a dual resolution that would include both the Benton and Brown versions of annexation, leaving enactment of the legislation to Polk&#x27;s discretion when he took office. In private and separate talks with supporters of both the Brown and Benton plans, Polk left each side with the &quot;impression he would administer their [respective] policy. Polk meant what he said to Southerners and meant to appear friendly to the Van Burenite faction.&quot; Polk&#x27;s handling of the matter had the effect of uniting Senate northern Democrats in favor of the dual alternative treaty bill.

On February 27, 1845, less than a week before Polk&#x27;s inauguration, the Senate voted 27–25 to admit Texas, based on the Tyler protocols of simple majority passage. All twenty-four Democrats voted for the measure, joined by three southern Whigs. Benton and his allies were assured that Polk would act to establish the eastern portion of Texas as a slave state; the western section was to remain unorganized territory, not committed to slavery. On this understanding, the northern Democrats had conceded their votes for the dichotomous bill. The next day, in an almost strict party line vote, the Benton-Milton measure was passed in the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives. President Tyler signed the bill the following day, March 1, 1845 (Joint Resolution for annexing Texas to the United States, J.Res. 8, enacted March 1, 1845, ).

==Annexation and admittance==
Senate and House legislators who had favored Benton&#x27;s renegotiated version of the Texas annexation bill had been assured that President Tyler would sign the joint house measure, but leave its implementation to the incoming Polk administration. But, during his last &quot;full&quot; day in office, President Tyler, with the urging of his Secretary of State Calhoun, decided to act decisively to improve the odds for the immediate annexation of Texas. On March 3, 1845, with his cabinet&#x27;s assent, he dispatched an offer of annexation to the Republic of Texas by courier, exclusively under the terms of the Brown–Foster option of the joint house measure. Secretary Calhoun apprised President-elect Polk of the action, who demurred without comment. Tyler justified his preemptive move on the grounds that Polk was likely to come under pressure to abandon immediate annexation and reopen negotiations under the Benton alternative.

When President Polk took office on (at noon EST) March 4, he was in a position to recall Tyler&#x27;s dispatch to Texas and reverse his decision. On March 10, after conferring with his cabinet, Polk upheld Tyler&#x27;s action and allowed the courier to proceed to Texas with the offer of immediate annexation. The only modification was to exhort Texans to accept the annexation terms unconditionally. Polk&#x27;s decision was based on his concern that a protracted negotiation by US commissioners would expose annexation efforts to foreign intrigue and interference. While Polk kept his annexation endeavors confidential, Senators passed a resolution requesting formal disclosure of the administration&#x27;s Texas policy. Polk stalled, and when the Senate special session had adjourned on March 20, 1845, no names for US commissioners to Texas had been submitted by him. Polk denied charges from Senator Benton that he had misled Benton on his intention to support the new negotiations option, declaring &quot;if any such pledges were made, it was in a total misconception of what I said or meant.&quot;

On May 5, 1845, Texas President Jones called for a convention on July 4, 1845, to consider the annexation and a constitution. On June 23, the Texan Congress accepted the US Congress&#x27;s joint resolution of March 1, 1845, annexing Texas to the United States, and consented to the convention. On July 4, the Texas convention debated the annexation offer and almost unanimously passed an ordinance assenting to it. The convention remained in session through August 28, and adopted the Constitution of Texas on August 27, 1845. The citizens of Texas approved the annexation ordinance and new constitution on October 13, 1845.

President Polk signed the legislation making the former Republic of Texas a state of the Union on December 29, 1845 (Joint Resolution for the admission of the state of Texas into the Union, J.Res. 1, enacted December 29, 1845, ). Texas relinquished its sovereignty to the United States at the inauguration of Governor James Henderson on February 19, 1846.

==Border disputes==
Neither the joint resolution nor the ordinance of annexation contain language specifying the boundaries of Texas, and only refer in general terms to &quot;the territory properly included within, and rightfully belonging to the Republic of Texas&quot;, and state that the new State of Texas is to be formed &quot;subject to the adjustment by this [U.S.] government of all questions of boundary that may arise with other governments.&quot; According to George Lockhart Rives, &quot;That treaty had been expressly so framed as to leave the boundaries of Texas undefined, and the joint resolution of the following winter was drawn in the same manner. It was hoped that this might open the way to a negotiation, in the course of which the whole subject of the boundaries of Mexico, from the Gulf to the Pacific, might be reconsidered, but these hopes came to nothing.&quot;

There was an ongoing border dispute between the Republic of Texas and Mexico prior to annexation. Texas claimed the Rio Grande as its border based on the Treaties of Velasco, while Mexico maintained that it was the Nueces River and did not recognize Texan independence. In November 1845, President James K. Polk sent John Slidell, a secret representative, to Mexico City with a monetary offer to the Mexican government for the disputed land and other Mexican territories. Mexico was not inclined nor able to negotiate because of instability in its government and popular nationalistic sentiment against such a sale. Slidell returned to the United States, and Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor to garrison the southern border of Texas, as defined by the former Republic, in 1846. Taylor moved into Texas, ignoring Mexican demands to withdraw, and marched as far south as the Rio Grande, where he began to build a fort near the river&#x27;s mouth on the Gulf of Mexico. The Mexican government regarded this action as a violation of its sovereignty, and immediately prepared for war. Following a United States victory and the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexico ceded its claims to Texas and the Rio Grande border was accepted by both nations.

==Joint resolution precedent and legacy: Hawaii==
The formal controversy over the legality of the annexation of Texas stems from the fact that Congress approved the annexation of Texas as a state, rather than a territory, with simple majorities in each house, instead of annexing the land by Senate treaty, as was done with Native American lands. Tyler&#x27;s extralegal joint resolution maneuver in 1844 exceeded strict constructionist precepts, but was passed by Congress in 1845 as part of a compromise bill. The success of the joint house Texas annexation set a precedent that would be applied to the annexation of the Republic of Hawaii in 1897.

Republican President Benjamin Harrison (1889–1893) attempted, in 1893, to annex the Republic of Hawaii through a Senate treaty. When this failed, he was asked to consider the Tyler joint house precedent; he declined. Democratic President Grover Cleveland (1893–1897) did not pursue the annexation of the Republic of Hawaii. When President William McKinley took office in 1897, he quickly revived expectations among territorial expansionists when he resubmitted legislation to acquire the Republic of Hawaii. When the two-thirds Senate support was not forthcoming, committees in the House and Senate explicitly invoked the Tyler precedent for the joint house resolution, which was successfully applied to approve the annexation of Hawaii as an organized incorporated territory in July 1898.

<text>The city of Puruándiro is in the north of the Mexican state of Michoacán. 
It is located at . 
The population is 70,571. It was founded by Juan de Villaseñor y Orozco in 1522.

The wooded main garden has a kiosk that indicates that it was founded in 1565, but no records to corroborate that.

It is believed that Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla spent a night in Puruándiro during his revolutionary movement and that in 1965 President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz paid a visit to commemorate its founding. But again, there is a lack of information to support these facts.

Near the church and the center portals are the &quot;Lázaro Cárdenas&quot; and the &quot;Morelos&quot; garden. The latter holds a bust dedicated to José María Morelos, an insurgent soldier in the Mexican war of independence. In addition to a second effigy commemorating Benito Juárez, former president of the nation.

The &quot;Los Arcos&quot; thermal waters spa is one of the most notable tourist attractions in town.

==Name==
Its name purépecha is &quot;Purhuandirhu&quot; which means &quot;place of water where the fire rests&quot; or &quot;place of hot water&quot; since the city enjoys abundant hot water that comes from the mantles surrounding aquifers. Many people take advantage of this water (which is rich in minerals such as sulfur) to bathe, wash clothes or simply relax by soaking in it.

== Demography ==
The city of Puruándiro has a population of 32,333 inhabitants according to data from the XIV General Population and Housing Census from 2020 which has been done by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography. That makes it the 16th most populous city in Michoacán

=== Religion ===
Christianity Catholic predominates in 97% of the population, followed to a lesser extent by Protestant, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and atheism.

=== Ethnic groups ===
According to the 1990 General Population and Housing Census, 213 people who speak Purépecha live in the municipality, of whom 106 are men and 107 are women.

<doc id="355747" wikidata="Q1536398" url="?curid=355747" title="Little Blue Book">
<text>Little Blue Books are a series of small staple-bound books published from 1919 through 1978 by the Haldeman-Julius Publishing Company of Girard, Kansas. They were extremely popular, and achieved a total of 300-500 million booklets sold over the series&#x27; lifetime. A Big Blue Book range was also published.

==Origins==
Emanuel Haldeman-Julius and his wife, Marcet, set out to publish small low price paperback pocketbooks that were intended to sweep the ranks of the working class as well as the &quot;educated&quot; class. Their goal was to get works of literature, a wide range of ideas, common sense knowledge and various points of view out to as large an audience as possible. These books, at approximately 3½ by 5 inches (8.9 by 12.7 cm) easily fit into a working man&#x27;s back pocket or shirt pocket. The inspiration for the series were cheap 10-cent paperback editions of various expired copyright classic works that Haldeman-Julius had purchased as a 15-year-old (the &quot;Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot; being especially enthralling). He wrote:
It was winter, and I was cold, but I sat down on a bench and read that booklet straight through, without a halt, and never did I so much as notice that my hands were blue, that my wet nose was numb, and that my ears felt as hard as glass. Never until then, or since, did any piece of printed matter move me more deeply...I&#x27;d been lifted out of this world - and by a 10¢ booklet. I thought, at the moment, how wonderful it would be if thousands of such booklets could be made available.

In 1919 they purchased a publishing house in Girard, Kansas from their employer &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;, a socialist weekly which had seen better days and that Haldeman-Julius edited. Though the &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot; was not the influential newspaper it had been, its printing presses (and more importantly the 175,000 names on its subscriber lists) would prove to be crucial. Before anything had even been printed, Haldeman-Julius asked &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;&#x27;s subscribers to send him an advance of $5; at 10 cents a pamphlet, he would then, at staggered intervals, send them 50 pamphlets which he would be able to print with the upfront money. Things went very well:
Five thousand readers took me up, which meant I had $25,000 to work with. I hurried through the 50 titles (and they were good ones, too, for I haven&#x27;t believed in trash at any time in my life) and got many letters expressing satisfaction with the venture. Encouraged, I announced a second batch of 50 titles, and called for $5 subscriptions...Meanwhile, the booklets were selling well to readers who hadn&#x27;t subscribed for batches of 50.
In 1919 they began printing these works at a rate of 24,000 a day in a series called Appeal&#x27;s Pocket Series on cheap pulp paper, stapled and bound with a red stiff paper cover for 25 cents. The name changed over the first few years (as did the color of the binding), at times known as the People&#x27;s Pocket Series, the Appeal Pocket Series, the Ten Cent Pocket Series, the Five Cent Pocket Series, and finally the one that took, Little Blue Books in 1923. The price remained at 5-cents a copy for many years.

==Popularity==
In just nine years the idea caught on all around the globe as the Little Blue Books were finding their ways into the pockets of laborers, scholars, and the average citizen. The St. Louis Dispatch called Haldeman-Julius &quot;the Henry Ford of literature&quot;. Among the better known names of the day to support the Little Blue Books were Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, W. E. B. Du Bois, Admiral Richard Byrd, who took along a set to the South Pole, and Franklin P. Adams of Information, Please!

Most were sold by mail order and promoted through sensationalistic advertisements (e.g. “At last! Books are cheaper than hamburgers!”) in newspapers and magazines such as &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Popular Science&quot;, and &quot;Ladies’ Home Journal&quot;. To save ad space, only the book titles were listed, organized by topic headings such as “Philosophy,” “How-To,” or “Sex.” Many classics were cut down to fit the publishing requirements, which Haldeman-Julius justified as &quot;boring text&quot;, pioneering the concept later used by &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. A pioneer in guerrilla marketing, Haldeman-Julius sold his books not only in bookstores but everywhere he could reach the consumer, including drugstores, toy stores, even his own line of vending machines. Mail-order customers checked-off the titles they wanted and mailed in the order form, with $1 (20 books) being the minimum order. Many bookstores kept a book rack stocked with many Little Blue Book titles. Their small size and low price made them especially popular with travelers and transient working people.

If a book sold less than 10,000 copies in one year, Haldeman-Julius would remove it from his line, but usually only after trying a new title, often creating a hit. For instance, &quot;The Tallow Ball&quot; by Guy de Maupassant sold 15,000 copies one year, but 54,700 the next year after the title was changed to &quot;A French Prostitute&#x27;s Sacrifice&quot;.
Many famous people grew up on Little Blue Books. Louis L&#x27;Amour cites them as a major source of his own early reading in his autobiography &quot;Education of a Wandering Man&quot;. Other writers who recall reading the series in their youth include Saul Bellow, Harlan Ellison, Jack Conroy, Ralph Ellison, William S. Burroughs and Studs Terkel.

The works covered were frequently classics of Western literature. Goethe and Shakespeare were well represented, as were the works of the Ancient Greeks, and more modern writers like Voltaire, Émile Zola, H. G. Wells. Some of the topics the Little Blue Books covered were on the cutting edge of societal norms. Alongside books on making candy (#518 - &quot;How to Make All Kinds of Candy&quot; by Helene Paquin) and classic literature (#246 - Hamlet by William Shakespeare) were ones exploring same-sex love (#692 - &quot;Homo-Sexual Life&quot; by William J Fielding) and agnostic viewpoints (#1500 - &quot;Why I Am an Agnostic: Including Expressions of Faith from a Protestant a Catholic and a Jew&quot; by Clarence Darrow). Shorter works from many popular authors such as Jack London and Henry David Thoreau were published, as were a number of anti-religious tracts written by Robert Ingersoll, ex-Catholic priest Joseph McCabe, and Haldeman-Julius himself. A young Will Durant wrote a series of Blue Books on philosophy which were republished in 1926 by Simon &amp; Schuster as &quot;The Story of Philosophy&quot;, a popular work that remains in print today.

==Decline in popularity==
Demand for existing titles remained steady throughout the Depression although only about 300 new titles were released during the 1930s, the bulk appearing prior to 1932. Following World War II, the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover viewed the Little Blue Books&#x27; inclusion of such subjects as socialism, atheism, and frank treatment of sexuality as a threat and put Haldeman-Julius on their enemies list, getting him convicted of income tax evasion. This persecution caused a rapid decline in the number of bookstores carrying the Little Blue Books, and they slowly sank into obscurity by the 1950s, although still well remembered by older people who had read them in the 1920s and 1930s. The Cardinal Francis Spellman FBI file contains clear indications concerning the interest of the FBI on Haldeman-Julius Publications by 1955, after an anonymous letter in late 1954 alerted the government to a book that was under press &quot;vilifying&quot; the Cardinal.

At the time of Emanuel Haldeman-Julius&#x27;s death on July 31, 1951, the series supported 1873 active titles. The works continued to be reprinted until the Girard printing plant and warehouse was destroyed by fire in 1978 with 1914 total titles published. In the 1950s the San Diego, California-based atheist-Freethinker publication &quot;The Truth Seeker&quot; bought out most of their supply and raised prices.

Collections of the series are housed in the libraries at Pittsburg State University, Kent State University, Bowling Green State University, and California State University, Northridge.

<text>Photojournalism is journalism that uses images to tell a news story. It usually only refers to still images, but can also refer to video used in broadcast journalism. Photojournalism is distinguished from other close branches of photography (such as documentary photography, social documentary photography, war photography, street photography and celebrity photography) by having a rigid ethical framework which demands an honest and impartial approach that tells a story in strictly journalistic terms. Photojournalists contribute to the news media, and help communities connect with one other. They must be well-informed and knowledgeable, and are able to deliver news in a creative manner that is both informative and entertaining.

Similar to a writer, a photojournalist is a reporter, but they must often make decisions instantly and carry photographic equipment, often while exposed to significant obstacles, among them immediate physical danger, bad weather, large crowds, and limited physical access to their subjects.

==History==

===Origins in war photography===
The practice of illustrating news stories with photographs was made possible by printing and photography innovations that occurred in the mid 19th century. Although early illustrations had appeared in newspapers, such as an illustration of the funeral of Lord Horatio Nelson in &quot;The Times&quot; (1806), the first weekly illustrated newspaper was the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;, first printed in 1842. The illustrations were printed with the use of engravings.

The first photograph to be used in illustration of a newspaper story was a depiction of barricades in Paris during the June Days uprising taken on 25 June 1848; the photo was published as an engraving in &quot;L&#x27;Illustration&quot; of 1–8 July 1848.
During the Crimean War, the &quot;ILN&quot; pioneered the birth of early photojournalism by printing pictures of the war that had been taken by Roger Fenton. Fenton was the first official war photographer and his work included documenting the effects of the war on the troops, panoramas of the landscapes where the battles took place, model representations of the action, and portraits of commanders, which laid the groundwork for modern photojournalism. Other photographers of the war included William Simpson and Carol Szathmari. Similarly, the American Civil War photographs of Mathew Brady were engraved before publication in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly.&quot; The technology had not yet developed to the point of being able to print photographs in newspapers, which greatly restricted the audience of Brady&#x27;s photographs. However, it was still common for photographs to be engraved and subsequently printed in newspapers or periodicals throughout the war. Disaster, including train wrecks and city fires, was also a popular subject for illustrated newspapers in the early days.

===Expansion===

The printing of images in newspapers remained an isolated occurrence in this period. Photos were used to enhance the text rather than to act as a medium of information in its own right. This began to change with the work of one of the pioneers of photojournalism, John Thomson, in the late 1870s. In collaboration with the radical journalist Adolphe Smith, he began publishing a monthly magazine, &quot;Street Life in London&quot;, from 1876 to 1877. The project documented in photographs and text, the lives of the street people of London and established social documentary photography as a form of photojournalism. Instead of the images acting as a supplement to the text, he pioneered the use of printed photographs as the predominant medium for the imparting of information, successfully combining photography with the printed word.

On March 4, 1880, &quot;The Daily Graphic&quot; (New York) published the first halftone (rather than engraved) reproduction of a news photograph.
In March 1886, when General George Crook received word that the Apache leader Geronimo would negotiate surrender terms, photographer C. S. Fly took his equipment and attached himself to the military column. During the three days of negotiations, Fly took about 15 exposures on glass negatives. His photos of Geronimo and the other free Apaches, taken on March 25 and 26, are the only known photographs taken of American Indians while still at war with the United States. Fly coolly posed his subjects, asking them to move and turn their heads and faces, to improve his composition. The popular publication &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; published six of his images in their April 24, 1886 issue.

In 1887, flash powder was invented, enabling journalists such as Jacob Riis to photograph informal subjects indoors, which led to the landmark 1890 book &quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot;. By 1897, it became possible to reproduce halftone photographs on printing presses running at full speed.

In France, agencies such as Rol, Branger and Chusseau-Flaviens (ca. 1880–1910) syndicated photographs from all around the world to meet the need for timely new illustration. Despite these innovations, limitations remained, and many of the sensational newspaper and magazine stories in the period from 1897 to 1927 were illustrated with engravings. In 1921, the wirephoto made it possible to transmit pictures almost as quickly as news itself could travel.

===Golden age===

The &quot;Golden Age of Photojournalism&quot; is often considered to be roughly the 1930s through the 1950s. It was made possible by the development of the compact commercial 35mm Leica camera in 1925, and the first flash bulbs between 1927 and 1930, which allowed the journalist true flexibility in taking pictures.

A new style of magazine and newspaper appeared that used photography more than text to tell stories. The &quot;Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung&quot; was the first to pioneer the format of the illustrated news magazine. Beginning in 1901, it began to print photographs inside the magazine, a revolutionary innovation. In the successive decades, it was developed into the prototype of the modern news magazine.

It pioneered the photo-essay, had a specialised staff and production unit for pictures and maintained a photo library. It also introduced the use of candid photographs taken with the new smaller cameras.

The magazine sought out reporters who could tell a story using photographs, notably the pioneer sports photographer Martin Munkácsi, the first staff photographer, and Erich Salomon, one of the founders of photojournalism.

Other magazines included, &quot;Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung&quot; (Berlin), &quot;Vu&quot; (France), &quot;Life&quot; (USA), &quot;Look&quot; (USA), &quot;Picture Post&quot; (London)); and newspapers, &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; (London) and &quot;The New York Daily News&quot;. Famous photographers of the era included Robert Capa, Romano Cagnoni, Alfred Eisenstaedt, Margaret Bourke-White and W. Eugene Smith.

Henri Cartier-Bresson is held by some to be the father of modern photojournalism, although this appellation has been applied to various other photographers, such as Erich Salomon, whose candid pictures of political figures were novel in the 1930s.

The photojournalism of, for example, Agustí Centelles played an important role in the propaganda efforts of the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s.

American journalist Julien Bryan photographed and filmed the beginning of the Second World War being under heavy German bombardment in September 1939 in Poland. He was pioneer worker in color photography, Kodachrome.

William Vandivert photographed in color the German bombardment of London called the Blitz in 1940.

Soldier Tony Vaccaro is also recognized as one of the pre-eminent photographers of World War II. His images taken with the modest Argus C3 captured horrific moments in war, similar to Capa&#x27;s Spanish soldier being shot. Capa himself was on Omaha Beach on D-Day and captured pivotal images of the conflict on that occasion. Vaccaro is also known for having developed his own images in soldier&#x27;s helmets, and using chemicals found in the ruins of a camera store in 1944.

Until the 1980s, most large newspapers were printed with turn-of-the-century &quot;letterpress&quot; technology using easily smudged oil-based ink, off-white, low-quality &quot;newsprint&quot; paper, and coarse engraving screens. While letterpresses produced legible text, the photoengraving dots that formed pictures often bled or smeared and became fuzzy and indistinct. In this way, even when newspapers used photographs well — a good crop, a respectable size — murky reproduction often left readers re-reading the caption to see what the photo was all about. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; adopted stippled hedcuts in 1979 to publish portraits and avoid the limitations of letterpress printing. Not until the 1980s did a majority of newspapers switch to &quot;offset&quot; presses that reproduce photos with fidelity on better, whiter paper.
By contrast &quot;Life&quot;, one of America&#x27;s most popular weekly magazines from 1936 through the early 1970s, was filled with photographs reproduced beautifully on oversize 11×14-inch pages, using fine engraving screens, high-quality inks, and glossy paper. &quot;Life&quot; often published a United Press International (UPI) or Associated Press (AP) photo that had been first reproduced in newspapers, but the quality magazine version appeared to be a different photo altogether. In large part because their pictures were clear enough to be appreciated, and because their name always appeared with their work, magazine photographers achieved near-celebrity status. &quot;Life&quot; became a standard by which the public judged photography, and many of today&#x27;s photo books celebrate &quot;photojournalism&quot; as if it had been the exclusive province of near-celebrity magazine photographers.

In 1947, a few famous photographers founded the international photographic cooperative Magnum Photos. In 1989, Corbis Corporation and in 1995 Getty Images were founded. These powerful image libraries sell the rights to photographs and other still images.

===Decline===

The Golden Age of Photojournalism ended in the 1970s when many photo-magazines ceased publication, most prominently, &quot;Life&quot;, which ended weekly publication in December 1972. They found that they could not compete with other media for advertising revenue to sustain their large circulations and high costs. Still, those magazines taught journalism much about the photographic essay and the power of still images.

However, since the late 1970s, photojournalism and documentary photography have increasingly been accorded a place in art galleries alongside fine art photography. Luc Delahaye, Manuel Rivera-Ortiz and the members of VII Photo Agency are among many who regularly exhibit in galleries and museums.

==Professional organizations==

The Danish Union of Press Photographers (Pressefotografforbundet) was the first national organization for newspaper photographers in the world. It was founded in 1912 in Copenhagen, Denmark by six press photographers. Today it has over 800 members.

The National Press Photographers Association (NPPA) was founded in 1946 in the U.S., and has about 10,000 members. Others around the world include the British Press Photographers Association (BPPA) founded in 1984, then relaunched in 2003, and now has around 450 members. Hong Kong Press Photographers Association (1989), Northern Ireland Press Photographers Association (2000), Pressfotografernas Klubb (Sweden, 1930), and PK — Pressefotografenes Klubb (Norway).

Magnum Photos was founded in 1947 by Robert Capa, David &quot;Chim&quot; Seymour, Henri Cartier-Bresson, George Rodger, William Vandivert, Rita Vandivert and Maria Eisner, being one of the first photographic cooperatives, owned and administered entirely by its members worldwide.

VII Photo Agency was founded in September 2001 and got its name from the original seven founders, Alexandra Boulat, Ron Haviv, Gary Knight, Antonin Kratochvil, Christopher Morris, James Nachtwey and John Stanmeyer. Today it has 30 members, along with a mentor program.

News organizations and journalism schools run many different awards for photojournalists. Since 1968, Pulitzer Prizes have been awarded for the following categories of photojournalism: &#x27;Feature Photography&#x27;, &#x27;Spot News Photography&#x27;. Other awards are World Press Photo, Best of Photojournalism, and Pictures of the Year as well as the UK based The Press Photographer&#x27;s Year.

==Ethical, legal, and social considerations==

Photojournalism works within the same ethical approaches to objectivity that are applied by other journalists. What to photograph, what to include in the frame, how to curate, and how to edit are constant considerations. Photographing news for an assignment or to illustrate a story can present many possible ethical problems. Photojournalists have a moral responsibility to decide what pictures to take, what picture to stage, and what pictures to show the public. For example, photographs of violence and tragedy are prevalent in American journalism because, as an understated rule of thumb, &quot;if it bleeds, it leads&quot;. The public may be attracted to the spectacle of gruesome photographs and dramatic stories. Controversy may arise when deciding which photographs are too violent to show the public.

Photographs of the dead or injured arouse controversy because, more often than not, the name of person depicted in the photograph is not given in the caption. The photograph of the street execution of a Viet Cong soldier during the Vietnam War provoked a lot of interest because it captured the exact moment of death. The victim&#x27;s wife learned about her husband&#x27;s death when she was given a newspaper with the photo on the front page. This photo has claimed a reputation of &quot;galvanizing the anti-war movement in the United States&quot; and impacted many people&#x27;s perception of the war. Being exposed to such violence can have physiological and psychological effects on those who document it and is but one of many different forms of emotional labor that photojournalists report experiencing. In this case, the photographer Eddie Adams was quoted saying &quot;I was getting money for showing one man killing another. Two lives were destroyed, and I was getting paid for it. I was a hero.&quot; He expressed how this photo haunted him due to its impact on the world.

A key example of how impactful photography can be is found during documentation of the Civil Rights Movement. Bill Hudson was in Birmingham, Alabama on a quest to document the peaceful protests of the movement when he took a photo of high school student Walter Gadsden. In this photograph Gadsden appeared to be attacked by a police dog and the resulting image brought the gory side of the movement to everyone&#x27;s attention. The photo was seen above the fold in the May 1963 &quot;New York Times&quot;. In the case of this particular photograph, it helped change the path of the civil rights movement and gained it even more attention.

Other issues involving photojournalism include the right to privacy, negotiating how the subject desires to be depicted, and questions of whether compensation is warranted. Especially regarding pictures of violence, photojournalists face the ethical dilemma of whether or not to publish images of the victims. The victim&#x27;s right to privacy is sometimes not addressed or the picture is printed without their knowledge or consent.

Another major issue of photojournalism is photo manipulation – what degree is acceptable?  Some pictures are simply manipulated for color enhancement, whereas others are manipulated to the extent where people are edited in or out of the picture. War photography has always been a genre of photojournalism that is frequently staged. Due to the bulkiness and types of cameras present during past wars in history, it was rare when a photograph could capture a spontaneous news event. Subjects were carefully composed and staged in order to capture better images. Another ethical issue is false or misleading captioning. The 2006 Lebanon War photographs controversies is a notable example of some of these issue, and see photo manipulation: use in journalism for other examples.

The emergence of digital photography offers new realms of opportunity for the manipulation, reproduction, and transmission of images. It has inevitably complicated many of the ethical issues involved.

Often, ethical conflicts can be mitigated or enhanced by the actions of a sub-editor or picture editor, who takes control of the images once they have been delivered to the news organization. The photojournalist often has no control as to how images are ultimately used.

The National Press Photographers Association (NPPA) is an American professional society that emphasizes photojournalism. Members of the NPPA accept the following code of ethics
===Unethical practices===

Most photojournalists consider stage-managed shots presented as candid to be unethical. There have been examples in the history of photojournalism of photographers purposefully deceiving their audience by doing so.

Mike Meadows, a veteran photographer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, was covering a major wild fire sweeping southern California on 27 October 1993. His picture of a Los Angeles County firefighter, Mike Alves cooling himself off with water in a pool in Altadena ran both in the &quot;Times&quot; and nationally. Prior to submitting the photograph for a Pulitzer Prize, Meadows&#x27; assignment editor, Fred Sweets, contacted the firefighter, who reportedly said he had been asked by Meadows to go to the pool and splash water on his head. Meadows denied the accusation, claiming &quot;I may have been guilty of saying this would make a nice shot, but to the best of my recollection, I did not directly ask him to do that. ... I&#x27;ve been doing breaking news stories for years and years and I&#x27;ve never in my life set up a picture.&quot; Meadows was suspended without pay for a week and picture was withdrawn from any prize competitions – the &quot;Times&quot; called it a &quot;fabrication&quot; and the paper&#x27;s photography director, Larry Armstrong, said &quot;when you manipulate the situation, you manipulate the news.&quot;

Edward Keating, a Pulitzer Prize winner from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, photographed a young boy pointing a toy gun outside a Middle Eastern grocery store, near a town where the FBI raided an alleged Al Qaeda cell. Other photographers at the scene claimed that Keating pointed with his own arm to show the boy which way to look and aim the gun. After the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; reported the incident, Keating was forced to leave the paper.

==Impact of new technologies==

As early as the Crimean War in the mid-19th century, photographers were using the novel technology of the glass plate camera to record images of British soldiers in the field. As a result, they had to deal with not only war conditions, but their pictures often required long shutter speeds, and they had to prepare each plate before taking the shot and develop it immediately after. This led to, for example, Roger Fenton traveling around in a transportable dark room, which at times made him a target of the enemy. These technological barriers are why he was unable to obtain any direct images of the action.

The use of photography as a way of reporting news did not become widespread until the advent of smaller, more portable cameras that used an enlargeable film negative to record images. The introduction of the 35 mm Leica camera in 1925 made it possible for photographers to move with the action, take multiple shots of events as they were unfolding, as well as be more able to create a narrative through their photographs alone.

Since the 1960s, motor drives, electronic flash, auto-focus, better lenses and other camera enhancements have made picture-taking easier. New digital cameras free photojournalists from the limitation of film roll length. Although the number depends on the amount of megapixels the camera contains, whether one&#x27;s shooting mode is JPEG or raw, and what size of memory card one is using, it is possible to store thousands of images on a single memory card.

Social media are playing a big part in revealing world events to a vast audience. Whenever there is a major event in the world, there are usually people with camera phones ready to capture photos and post them on various social networks. Such convenience allows the Associated Press and other companies to reach out to the citizen journalist who holds ownership of the photos and get permission to use those photos in news outlets.

The content of photos tends to outweigh their quality when it comes to news value. On February 18, 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published on their front page a photo of AT&amp;T CEO John Zeglis which was taken with a camera phone. Content remains the most important element of photojournalism, but the ability to extend deadlines with rapid gathering and editing of images has brought significant changes. Even by the end of the 1990s – when digital cameras such as the Nikon D1 and the Canon EOS D30 were still in their infancy – nearly 30 minutes were needed to scan and transmit a single color photograph from a remote location to a news office for printing. Now, equipped with a digital camera, a mobile phone and a laptop computer, a photojournalist can send a high-quality image in minutes, even seconds after an event occurs. Camera phones and portable satellite links increasingly allow for the mobile transmission of images from almost any point on the earth.

There is some concern by news photographers that the profession of photojournalism as it is known today could change to such a degree that it is unrecognizable as image-capturing technology naturally progresses. Staff photojournalism jobs continued to dwindle in the 2010s and some of the largest news media outlets in the U.S. now rely on freelancers for the majority of their needs. For example, in 2016, the &quot;New York Times&quot; employed 52 photo editors and relied on freelancers to provide 50 percent or more of its visuals; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; employed 24 photo editors and relied on freelancers for 66 percent of its features imagery and 33 percent of its news imagery; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; employed 19 photo editors and relied on freelancers for 80 percent of its international news imagery, 50 percent of its political news imagery, and between 60 and 80 percent of its national news imagery.

The age of the citizen journalist and the providing of news photos by amateur bystanders have contributed to the art of photojournalism. Paul Levinson attributes this shift to the Kodak camera, one of the first cheap and accessible photo technologies that &quot;put a piece of visual reality into every person&#x27;s potential grasp.&quot; The empowered news audience with the advent of the Internet sparked the creation of blogs, podcasts and online news, independent of the traditional outlets, and &quot;for the first time in our history, the news increasingly is produced by companies outside journalism&quot;. Dan Chung, a former photojournalist for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Reuters, believes that professional photojournalists will have to adapt to video to make a living. Most digital single lens reflex bodies are being equipped with video capabilities.

===Phone journalism===
Phone journalism is a relatively new and even controversial means of photojournalism, which involves the use of pictures taken and edited on phones by professional or non-professional photographers.

In recent years, as social media has become the major platform on which people receive news and share events, phone photography is gaining popularity as the primary tool for online visual communication. A phone is easy to carry and always accessible in a pocket, and the immediacy in taking pictures can reduce the intervention of the scene and subjects to a minimum. With the assistance of abundant applications, photographers can achieve a highly aesthetic way of conveying messages. Once the pictures are uploaded onto social media, photographers can immediately expose their work to a wide range of audiences and receive real-time feedback from them. With a large number of active participants online, the pictures could also be spread out in a short period of time, thus evoking profound influence on society.

Having noticed the advantages of the combination of social media and Phoneography, some well-known newspapers, news magazines and professional photojournalists decided to employ phone journalism as a new approach. When the London Bombings happened in July 2005, for the first time, both the &quot;New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Washington Post&quot; ran photos on their front pages made by citizen journalists with camera phones. As work of witnesses and survivors, the images were less the outcome of documentary intent than a response to a traumatic shock. These photos represented &quot;vivid, factual accounts of history as it explodes around us&quot;, according to &quot;Washington Post&quot; journalist Robert MacMillan. In another instance, when Hurricane Sandy hit the northeastern United States in 2012, &quot;Time&quot; sent out five photographers with iPhones to document the devastation. Photographers dived deep into the site and captured pictures in close proximity to the storm and human suffering. One of the shots, raging ocean waves collapsing on Coney Island in Brooklyn, taken by Benjamin Lowy, made the cover of &quot;Time&quot;″s November 12 issue. Then in 2013, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; laid off its entire staff of 28 photographers, including John H. White, a Pulitzer Prize winner in photography. The newspaper cited viewers shifting towards more video as a reason. They then employed freelance photographers and required them to train in how to use an iPhone for photography to fill the gap. Some viewers online were quick to point out an at-times reduction in quality in comparison to the newspaper&#x27;s previous full-time professionals.

<text>The Masurian ethnolect (Masurian: &quot;mazurská gádkä&quot;; ; ), according to some linguists, is a dialect group of the Polish language; others consider Masurian to be a separate language, spoken by the Masurian people in northeastern Poland.

The dialect belongs to the Masovian dialect group and is located in the part of Poland as well as parts of Siberia. It borders the Lubawa dialect to the far southwest, the Ostróda dialect and Warmia dialect to the west, the new mixed dialects to the north, the Suwałki dialect to the east, marginally the Podlachia dialect to the far east, and the Kurpie dialect and Far Mazovian dialect to the south.

== History ==
From the 14th century, some settlers from Masovia started to settle in southern Prussia, which had been devastated by the crusades of the Teutonic Knights against the native Old Prussians. According to other sources, people from Masovia did not move to southern Prussia until the time of the Protestant Reformation, Prussia having become Lutheran in 1525. The Masurians were mostly of the Protestant faith, in contrast to the neighboring Roman Catholic people of the Duchy of Masovia, which was incorporated into the Polish kingdom in 1526. A new dialect developed in Prussia, isolated from the remaining Polish language area. The Masurian dialect group has many Low Saxon, German and Old Prussian words mixed in with Polish-language endings.

Beginning in the 1870s, Imperial German officials restricted the usage of languages other than German in Prussia&#x27;s eastern provinces.
While in 1880 Masurians were still treated as Poles by the German Empire, at the turn of century the German authorities undertook several measures to Germanise and separate them from the Polish nation by creating a separate identity. After World War I the East Prussian plebiscite was held on July 11, 1920, according to the Treaty of Versailles, in which the Masurians had to decide whether they wanted to be part of the Second Polish Republic or remain in German East Prussia; about 98% voted for Germany.

By the early 20th century, most Masurians were at least bilingual and could speak Low Saxon and German; in some areas about half of them still spoke Masurian, at least at home. In 1900, according to the German census there were 142,049 Masurians speaking Masurian. In 1925, only 40,869 people gave Masurian as their native language, many considering German their first language, considering Masurian merely as their domestic dialect, By the early 1920s there were also some Masurians who had their separate identity, claiming that Masurians are a nation. Most of them were members of &quot;Masurenbund&quot;. Their main goal was to grant Masurians some minority laws inside Germany, but there were also some separatists. In the early 1930s, support for the Nazi Party was high in Masuria, especially in elections in 1932 and 1933. Nazi political rallies were organized in the Masurian dialect during the campaigning.

After 1933 the usage of the Masurian dialect was prohibited by the National Socialist authorities. By 1938 most Masurian place and personal names had been changed to &quot;pure&quot; German substitutes. From 1939 on it was forbidden to hold church services in Masurian.

The replacement of Masurian in favor of German was not completed by the time the Soviet Red Army conquered Masurian East Prussia in January 1945, in World War II. The territory was transferred to Poland according to the postwar Potsdam Conference. During the wartime fighting and post-war deportations in the subsequent decades, most Masurian-speakers left Masuria for western Germany, especially to post-war West Germany, where they were quickly assimilated into the German mainstream.

=== Situation in 21st century ===
According to some scientists such as Andrzej Sakson, there are about 5,000–10,000 ethnic Masurians left in Poland. According to the Polish census from 2011, there are only 1,376 of them who identify themselves as Masurians. Most Masurians live in Germany now, but due to the German law the ethnicity and nationality are not determined in their census.

There is a lack of surveys on the knowledge of the ethnolect both in Poland and Germany. However, the elderly can communicate in Masurian with some fluency. The sole group who speak Masurian on a daily basis are the so-called Russian Masurians, who are the descendants of colonists who arrived in Siberia at the end of the 19th century. They have lived in isolation from the other groups, thus they were neither Germanized nor Polonized, although their speech acquired many Russian loanwords.

Nowadays, there are several organizations promoting the dialect. Since 2015, the Sorkwity Masurian Culture Festival started to promote Masurian, locals are starting to create folk music, and some schools are organizing competitions in speaking Masurian. People are also starting to promote the ethnolect via social media. In 2016, the was founded to promote the Masurian ethnolect and culture. Meanwhile, some activists have also started a process of linguistical normalization to promote and save the ethnolect.

In 2016, the online dictionary Glosbe introduced Masurian to their data.

== Books in Masurian ==
The oldest book written in Masurian probably is &quot;Ta Swenta Woyna&quot;, written by Jakub Szczepan in 1900.

In 2018, &quot;The Little Prince&quot; by Antoine de Saint Exupéry was translated to Masurian.

== Dialect or language ==
Several scientists consider Masurian to be a separate language in its own right; others argue that Masurian is a dialect of Polish, or even just a subdialect.

== Linguistic features ==
Typical of Masovian dialects, devoicing of word-final consonants before vowels and liquids is present here, including before clitics. Also typical of Masovian dialects is the presence of mazuration, however, younger people tend to use a pronunciation that of Standard Polish, and as such, mazuration is quickly fading. The degree of mazuration can also depend on the given phoneme.

===Vowels===
The shift of initial ja-, ra- &gt; je-, re- is present but limited to particular words: jek (jak), reno (rano).

Medial -ar- shifts to -er-: rozwer: (rozwarł), w mercu (w marcu), łosiera (ofiara).

Ablaut is often levelled: wietrak (wiatrak).

Often y merges with i: pisk (pysk).

====Slanted vowels====
Slanted á may be retained as á (more common in the central part), or sometimes merge with a (more common in the east), where historic short a often fronts to [æ] and can cause softening of the preceding consonant: matk’æ. Slanted é may sometimes be retained as é, or may either lower and merge with e or raise and merge with y. Slanted ó is usually retained as ó, but may also either lower and merge with o (in the east) or raise and merge with u (elsewhere).

====Nasal vowels====
Medial -ę- decomposes to -én- and -ą- to -óN- in the east, and nasality is often lost medially in the west. Finally, nasality is loss, giving -e and -o.

====Prothesis====
Initial i- often has a prothetic j-, and can then sometimes lower: jimię (imię), jenaczyj (inaczej). This happens most commonly in the north east of Szczytno and Mrągowo.

Initial o- typically labializes, as does u- to a lesser extent.

Soft labials decompose: b’jałi, b’źałi (biały), b’h’ijak (bijak) h and ch appear more commonly in the east and ś and ź in the west, j being rare; m’ shifts to mń: ramńona (ramiona); sometimes ᵐń: ᵐniasto; as well as ń: ńód (miód). Hardening of m also occurs, particularly in German loanwords and the instrumental plural ending -ami: ńemeck’i (niemiecki), nasto (miasto), myck’i (czapki), cepamy (cepami).

św’, ćw’ i dźw’ typically harden: śfat (świat). Soft forms occur more often before front vowels, but not only: śf’at (świat), śf’eće (świecie).

Fricative rz is retained by some speakers; however by the early 20th century it was already rare and present mostly among older speakers, and today is nearly non-existent, with rz generally being pronounced as in Standard Polish.

ń sometimes hardens, typically in the north, as a result of German influence: drewnana studna (drewniana studnia).

kie, gie, ki, and gi generally remain soft, but most people often harden k and g before one of the vowels while keeping them soft before the other, and generally k and g are soft before e more than i: k’edy (kiedy), taky (taki). Hard pronunciations are becoming rarer. A few instances of further palatalization can be heard: flakt’i (flaki), okt’eć (łokieć), mat’era (makiera). k and g may also sometimes palatalize before ę, especially in the east: matk’e (matkę), g’enśi (gęsi). k and g may also soften before a in the east, particularly the northeast; in the west it remains hard: k’apa (kapa). This softening mostly concerns jasne a, and is rare for ká, gá. Most residents had this pronunciation through the 20th century. Also in the east, ch may soften before i, e, ę, and a to chś, ś, or szi: ožeśi (orzechy), štaśety (sztachety), l’iśa (licha), ch’ata (chata). In the west, a hard pronunciation is most common.

===Consonants===
cz is most commonly merged with c, but words related to education often have cz, spread through schools. Rarely it may soften to czi or ć. dż is generally realized az dz, but is not a common enough phone to establish statistics. ż and sz show much more fluctuation, due to influence from both Standard Polish as well as German, but also the common presence of the phonemes s, z and ż sz from rz. This confusion with rz can sometimes result in mazuration of rz as well as hypercorrections, which contributes to the loss of mazuration of ż and sz. sz shows more fluctuation than ż. However, mazuration still predominates, with żi being less common and ź being rare.

Fricative rz was very common at the beginning 20th century; by the middle of the 20th century it was still used by some speakers, generally being replaced with ż/sz or rarely r: rec-i (rzeczy).

Similarly, the palatal sibilants ś, ź, ć, dź may be realized in many ways. Sometimes they are the same as in Standard Polish. They may also harden to szi, żi, czi, and dżi, or as sz, ż, cz, dż. Most rarely, they may completely depatalize. ś ź show more fluctuation than ć dź. Palatal pronunciations of ś ź are the most common, except in the north-east where szi, żi are more common. ć and dź more commonly harden in the north due to German influence. Elsewhere, soft realizations are more common.

A few cases of kaszubienie can be found.

== Dialects of Masurian ==
Masurian has three to five dialects:
* Ostróda dialect (Ostróda, Olsztynek) – Denasalization of the nasal vowels &quot;ą&quot; and &quot;ę&quot; as &quot;o&quot; and &quot;e&quot; – No mazuration – Common &quot;á&quot; (, a result from historic long vowels. See Old Polish phonology and Middle Polish phonology for more. – Labialization (&quot;ô, û – uo, uu)&quot; – Before &quot;ł&quot; vowels &quot;i&quot; and &quot;y&quot; pronounced like &quot;u&quot;, e.g. &quot;buł&quot;, &quot;zuł&quot; (&quot;był&quot;, &quot;żył&quot;).
* West-Masurian dialect (Działdowo, Nidzica, Szczytno) – Irregularly occurring &quot;á&quot; and labialization – &quot;Mni&quot; where Polish &quot;mi&quot; (&quot;mniasto, kamnień)&quot; – As in Ostróda district appear and have dominant position &quot;psi, bzi, (w)zi, f(si)&quot; to &quot;pchi, bhI&quot; etc. – Denasalization of the nasal vowels &quot;ą&quot; and &quot;ę&quot; as &quot;o&quot; and &quot;e.&quot;
* Center-Masurian dialect (Giżycko, Mrągowo, Pisz, Biała Piska) – The most common intermediate &quot;á&quot; – The most common archaic &quot;ř&quot; (in Polish sound as &quot;rż&quot;) – Frequent labialization – Appear and have dominant position &quot;pchi, bhI&quot; to &quot;psi, bzi&quot; etc. – Dominate pronunciation &quot;ni&quot; instead of &quot;mni&quot; – &quot;niasto, kanień&quot; etc. - Soft &quot;k, g, ch&quot; when is before &quot;a&quot; for example &quot;kia, gia, chia&quot; – Polish &quot;ą&quot; i &quot;ę&quot; like &quot;ón&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;én&quot;, &quot;en.&quot;
* East-Masurian dialect (Łek, Ôleck) – Polish &quot;ś, ć, ź&quot; pronounced like &quot;sz&quot;, &quot;cz&quot;, &quot;ż&quot; (for example &quot;spacz&quot;, &quot;bÿcz)&quot; – &quot;Á&quot; almost does not exist – &quot;a&quot; is frequently pronounced as a vowel intermediate between &quot;a&quot; and &quot;e&quot; (&quot;ä – mätkiä&quot; , as in American English &quot;trap&quot;) – Synchronous pronunciation of soft labials &quot;b&#x27;, p&#x27;, f&#x27;, w&quot;&#x27; change to &quot;bj,&quot; &quot;pj,&quot; &quot;fj,&quot; &quot;wj&quot; – &quot;Ch&quot; change to &quot;ś&quot; (kosianÿ, siätä) – Less frequent &quot;é&quot; and &quot;ó.&quot;
* North-Masurian dialect (Węgorzewo, Gołdap) – in the early 20th century almost disappeared, in the area Węgorzewa known for up to a few percent of the population (in the nineteenth century, more than half), in district of Gołdap 1% (in the nineteenth century, approx. 20%). – Very archaic sound for &quot;r&quot; – A relatively frequent &quot;á.&quot;

In the singular it is possible to replace &quot;u&quot; with &quot;ÿ&quot; for example: (Já) buł/bÿł, tÿsź buł/bÿł, (Ón) buł/bÿł. It is also possible to create the future perfect tense with the structure + , for example: &quot;(Já) Bénde koménderowač&quot;.

=== Present tense conjugation ===

==== &quot;-ač&quot; ====
The conjugation of regular verbs usually ending in &quot;-ač&quot;, for example &quot;znač&quot; (to know).

&quot;á&quot; will shorten to &quot;a&quot; if the word has more than one syllable. For example:

* dumač – to think (dumam, dumas, dumá, dumawa, dumata, dumajó)
* kupač – to buy (kupam, kupas, kupá, kupawa, kupata, kupajó)

==== &quot;-eč&quot; ====
The conjugation of regular verbs usually ending in &quot;-eč&quot;, for example &quot;mÿšléč&quot; (to think).
==== &quot;-ovač&quot; ====
The conjugation of regular verbs usually ending &quot;in -owač&quot; &quot;, for example &quot;koménderowač&quot; (to give an order to someone).
=== Conditional ===

To create the conditional, as in the majority of Slavic languages, the verb root is taken (i.e. verb endings like &quot;ač, eč&quot; are not considered and the respective ending is added for the conditional mode. For example, &quot;znač (to know) → &quot;znabÿ (he/she would know).

&quot;bÿ&quot; in Masurian has also one more function, where it can be placed at the beginning of a sentence to make questions, or also to mean &quot;whether&quot;/&quot;or&quot;/&quot;if&quot;. For example, &quot;Lejduje ni niénso/niéso, bÿ sźwÿnina, bÿ réntozina&quot; (I like meat, whether it [is] pork or beef), which in standard Polish: &quot;Lubię mięso, czy to wieprzowinę, czy wołowinę&quot;.

<doc id="355759" wikidata="Q207846" url="?curid=355759" title="King eider">
<text>The king eider (pronounced ) (Somateria spectabilis) is a large sea duck that breeds along Northern Hemisphere Arctic coasts of northeast Europe, North America and Asia. The birds spend most of the year in coastal marine ecosystems at high latitudes, and migrate to Arctic tundra to breed in June and July. They lay four to seven eggs in a scrape on the ground lined with grass and down.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==
When he first described the king eider in 1758, in the 10th edition of his opus Systema Naturae, Carl Linnaeus assigned it to the genus &quot;Anas&quot;, along with the rest of the ducks. In 1819, William Elford Leach moved it and the other large eiders to the genus &quot;Somateria&quot;, where it has remained since. It is very closely related to the other members of its genus, and is known to hybridise with the common eider. Despite its very large range, it is monotypic.

The genus name &quot;Somateria&quot; is a combination of the Greek words &quot;sōma&quot;, meaning &quot;body&quot;, and &quot;erion&quot;, meaning &quot;wool&quot;; the combination (i.e. &quot;wooly body&quot;) is a reference to the eider&#x27;s famously thick, soft down. The specific name &quot;spectabilis&quot; is Latin for &quot;showy&quot;, &quot;remarkable&quot; or &quot;worth seeing&quot;, a reference to the handsomeness of the adult male&#x27;s plumage. The bird&#x27;s common name, king eider, is a direct translation of its Icelandic name. It is called &quot;king&quot; because of the orange, crown-like knob above the male&#x27;s bill; the male&#x27;s multicoloured plumage also suggests royal robes. &quot;Eider&quot; is a Dutch, German or Swedish word derived from the Icelandic word &quot;æður&quot; (meaning eider), itself derived from the Old Norse &quot;æthr&quot;.

== Description ==
The king eider is a large sea duck, measuring in length with a wingspan of . Males are, on average, heavier than females, with a mean weight of for males and for females. An individual bird&#x27;s mass can vary considerably from season to season—from as little as to as much as . Like all eiders, the species is sexually dimorphic; the male is slightly larger and, in breeding plumage, much more colourful than the female. The male is unmistakable with its mostly black body, buff-tinged white breast and multicoloured head. The head, nape and neck are a pale bluish grey. The cheek is pale green. The bill, separated from the face by a thin black line, is red with a white nail and a large, distinctive yellow knob. Some tertials are curved up and form &quot;spurs&quot; along the back.

The female (occasionally colloquially referred to as a &quot;queen eider&quot;) is a warm brown colour overall, slightly paler on the head and neck. The feathers on her upperparts and flanks are marked with blackish , while those on her neck and head bear fine black streaks. She has a buffy spot at the base of her bill and a buffy eye ring which extends into a downward curving stripe behind her eye. Her bill is variously described as black or grey, and her legs and feet are greenish grey.

Juvenile birds are greyish brown. Late in their first autumn, young males moult into a darker plumage, with white on the breast and rump; it takes them three years to achieve full adult plumage.

== Habitat and range ==
The king eider is , found throughout the Arctic. It breeds on the Arctic coast of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Svalbard and Russia, using a variety of tundra habitats. It winters in arctic and subarctic marine areas, most notably in the Bering Sea, the west coast of Greenland, eastern Canada and northern Norway. Wintering birds can form large flocks on suitable coastal waters, with some flocks exceeding 100,000 birds. It also occurs annually off the northeastern United States, Scotland and Kamchatka.

== Behaviour ==

=== Food and feeding ===
The king eider&#x27;s foraging strategies change depending on the season. For much of the year, it is at sea; there, it dives for benthic invertebrates. During the breeding season, it does more of its foraging on freshwater lakes and ponds, where it dabbles, feeding primarily on small invertebrates plucked from the surface of the water. It feeds on mollusks, crustaceans like king crabs, and on sea urchins, starfish and sea anemones.

=== Breeding ===
The female builds a scrape nest on the ground, usually near water. She lines it with vegetation and down feathers from her own body. She lays a clutch of , which she alone incubates for 22 to . The young are raised collectively by the females.

=== Voice ===
The male&#x27;s song is a quavering, dove-like cooing, transcribed as &quot;croo-croo-croo&quot; or &quot;hoo-hoo-hooo&quot;. The female makes a variety of low clucks, grunts and growls.

=== Longevity ===
The oldest known king eider was a female that lived at least 18 years 11 months. She was ringed (banded) as an adult south of Gambell, Alaska in 1940, and shot in 1958 in Utqiagvik, Alaska.

== Conservation and threats ==
Due to its large population and vast range, the king eider is listed as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The king eider is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.

As eggs and young, king eiders have many predators, including glaucous gull, common raven, parasitic jaeger and Arctic fox.

== Traditional uses ==
The king eider, or &quot;qengallek&quot; (pronounced [qə.ˈŋaː.ɬək]) in Yup&#x27;ik, is a regular source of fresh meat in the spring. They begin their migration past the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in late April and are hunted in great numbers. In May, several hundred thousand king eiders pass Point Barrow in northern Alaska on their way to Alaskan and Canadian breeding grounds.

<doc id="355765" wikidata="Q942537" url="?curid=355765" title="Compound eye">
<text>A compound eye is a visual organ found in arthropods such as insects and crustaceans. It may consist of thousands of ommatidia, which are tiny independent photoreception units that consist of a cornea, lens, and photoreceptor cells which distinguish brightness and color. The image perceived by this arthropod eye is a combination of inputs from the numerous ommatidia, which are oriented to point in slightly different directions. Compared with single-aperture eyes, compound eyes have poor image resolution; however, they possess a very large view angle and the ability to detect fast movement and, in some cases, the polarization of light. Because a compound eye is made up of a collection of ommatidia, each with its own lens, light will enter each ommatidium instead of using a single entrance point. The individual light receptors behind each lens are then turned on and off due to a series of changes in the light intensity during movement or when an object is moving, creating a flicker-effect known as the flicker frequency, which is the rate at which the ommatidia are turned on and off– this facilitates faster reaction to movement; honey bees respond in 0.01s compared with 0.05s for humans.

==Types==
Compound eyes are typically classified as either apposition eyes, which form multiple inverted images, or superposition eyes, which form a single erect image.

===Apposition eyes===

Apposition eyes can be divided into two groups. The typical apposition eye has a lens focusing light from one direction on the rhabdom, while light from other directions is absorbed by the dark wall of the ommatidium. The mantis shrimp is the most advanced example of an animal with this type of eye. In the other kind of apposition eye, found in the Strepsiptera, each lens forms an image, and the images are combined in the brain. This is called the schizochroal compound eye or the neural superposition eye (which, despite its name, is a form of the apposition eye).

===Superposition eyes===
The superposition eye is divided into three subtypes; the &quot;refracting&quot;, the &quot;reflecting&quot;, and the &quot;parabolic&quot; superposition eye. The refracting superposition eye has a gap between the lens and the rhabdom, and no side wall. Each lens takes light at an angle to its axis and reflects it to the same angle on the other side. The result is an image at half the radius of the eye, which is where the tips of the rhabdoms are. This kind is used mostly by nocturnal insects. In the parabolic superposition eye, seen in arthropods such as mayflies, the parabolic surfaces of the inside of each facet focus light from a reflector to a sensor array. Long-bodied decapod crustaceans such as shrimp, prawns, crayfish and lobsters are alone in having reflecting superposition eyes, which also have a transparent gap but use corner mirrors instead of lenses.

===Other===

Good fliers like flies or honey bees, or prey-catching insects like praying mantises or dragonflies, have specialized zones of ommatidia organized into a fovea area which gives acute vision. In the acute zone the eye is flattened and the facets larger. The flattening allows more ommatidia to receive light from a spot and therefore higher resolution.

There are some exceptions from the types mentioned above. Some insects have a so-called single lens compound eye, a transitional type which is something between a superposition type of the multi-lens compound eye and the single lens eye found in animals with simple eyes. Then there is the mysid shrimp, &quot;Dioptromysis paucispinosa&quot;. The shrimp has an eye of the refracting superposition type, in the rear behind this in each eye there is a single large facet that is three times in diameter the others in the eye and behind this is an enlarged crystalline cone. This projects an upright image on a specialized retina. The resulting eye is a mixture of a simple eye within a compound eye.

Another version is the pseudofaceted eye, as seen in Scutigera. This type of eye consists of a cluster of numerous ocelli on each side of the head, organized in a way that resembles a true compound eye.

Asymmetries in compound eyes may be associated with asymmetries in behaviour. For example, &quot;Temnothorax albipennis&quot; ant scouts show behavioural lateralization when exploring unknown nest sites, showing a population-level bias to prefer left turns. One possible reason for this is that its environment is partly maze-like and consistently turning in one direction is a good way to search and exit mazes without getting lost. This turning bias is correlated with slight asymmetries in the ants&#x27; compound eyes (differential ommatidia count).

The body of &quot;Ophiomastix wendtii&quot;, a type of brittle star, was previously thought to be covered with ommatidia, turning its whole skin into a compound eye, but this has since been found to be erroneous; the system does not rely on lenses or image formation.

==Cultural references==
&quot;Dragonfly eyes&quot; (Chinese: 蜻蜓眼 &quot;qingting yan&quot;) is a term for knobbly multi-coloured glass beads made in Western and Eastern Asia 2000–2500 years ago.
Owing to the multiple views and stimuli, compound eyes or dragonfly eyes have become a feature in art, film and literature, particularly in the 2010s. For example:

<text>Bautzen () or Budyšin (,Polish: &quot;Budziszyn&quot; ) until 1868 &quot;Budissin&quot; in German, is a town in eastern Saxony, Germany, and the administrative centre of the district of Bautzen. It is located on the Spree river, is the eighth most populous town in Saxony, and is the seat of Saxony&#x27;s largest district. Bautzen lies in the bilingual Sorbian settlement area (&quot;Serbski sydlenski rum&quot;) of Lusatia, and is Lusatia&#x27;s third-largest town after Cottbus and Görlitz, as well as the second-largest town in Upper Lusatia.

The town lies in the hilly Upper Lusatian Gefilde (&quot;Hornjołužiske hona&quot;), a part of the northwesternmost foothills of the Sudetes, just north of the Lusatian Highlands. Bautzen is the first larger town on the Spree River (), and the Bautzen Reservoir (&quot;Budyska rěčna zawěra&quot;) lies in the north of the town. In 2021, Bautzen had a population of around 38,000.

Although Görlitz is larger, it is Bautzen that is regarded as the historical capital of Upper Lusatia. Bautzen is the political and cultural center of the entirety of the Slavic minority of the Sorbs (Upper and Lower), although Lower Lusatia and the Lower Sorbian-speaking Sorbs have an own, second center, which is Cottbus. About 10 percent of Bautzen&#x27;s population is Upper Sorbian-speaking. The use of the language is more widespread in the countryside surrounding the town than in the town itself. Bautzen is the seat of several Sorbian institutions like the Domowina, the German-Sorbian People&#x27;s Theater (&quot;Němsko-Serbske ludowe dźiwadło&quot;), and Sorbian Broadcasting (&quot;Sorbischer Rundfunk&quot;, &quot;Serbski rozhłós&quot;).

From 1346 until 1815, the town was a member of the Lusatian League. The Bautzen Wenceslaus&#x27; Market (&quot;Bautzener Wenzelsmarkt&quot;, Upper Sorbian: &quot;Budyske Wjacławske wiki&quot;) is &quot;Germany&#x27;s oldest Christmas market mentioned in a chronicle&quot;. Asteroid &quot;11580 Bautzen&quot; is named in honour of the city.

==Names==
Like other cities and places in Lusatia, Bautzen has several different names across languages. Its German name was also officially changed in 1868.

Besides &quot;Bautzen&quot; (German) and &quot;Budyšin&quot; (Upper Sorbian), the town has had the following names:

* German: &quot;Budissin&quot; (variants used from onwards; Saxon government changed to &quot;Bautzen&quot; on 3 June 1868)
* Lower Sorbian: &quot;Budyšyn&quot; 
* 

==Geography==

===Geographical situation===
The town on the River Spree is situated about east of Dresden between the Lusatian highland and the lowlands in the north, amidst the region of Upper Lusatia. To the north stretches the Bautzen Reservoir, which was flooded in 1974. This is the former location of the villages of Malsitz (&quot;Małšecy&quot;) and Nimschütz (&quot;Hněwsecy&quot;).

===Expansion of the urban area===
The old part of Bautzen is located on the plateau above the Spree, whose top is marked by the castle. It is bordered by the city walls. The later-built more recent quarters in the east were enclosed by the city ramparts. After their removal, the city expanded further east and to the left bank of the river. However, there has only been a small urban area west of the Spree until today. In the 1970s, the development areas of &quot;Gesundbrunnen&quot; and &quot;Allendeviertel&quot; were erected. After 1990, several neighbouring villages were incorporated.

===Bordering municipalities===
The city is bordered by Radibor, Großdubrau and Malschwitz in the North, Kubschütz in the East, Großpostwitz, Obergurig and Doberschau-Gaußig in the South, as well as Göda in the West. All of these belong to the Bautzen district.
===Subdivisions===
The 15 city districts are:
==History==

In the 3rd century AD an eastern Germanic settlement existed here, but excavations have proved that the region was already inhabited as early as the late Stone Age. Sorbs arrived in the area during the migration period in the 6th century AD.

The first written evidence of the city is from 1002 under the name &quot;Budusin&quot; (, ). In 1018 the Peace of Bautzen was signed between the German king Henry II and the Polish ruler Bolesław I the Brave. The treaty left the town under Polish rule. In 1032 it passed to the Margraviate of Meissen within the Holy Roman Empire, in 1075 to the Duchy of Bohemia, elevated to a kingdom in 1198 (with short periods of Brandenburgian and Hungarian rule), in 1635 to Saxony, whose electors were also Polish kings in personal union from 1697 to 1763. One of two main routes connecting Warsaw and Dresden ran through the town at that time.

From 1346 to 1815, it was a member of the Six Cities&#x27; Alliance of the Upper Lusatian cities of Görlitz, Zittau, Löbau, Kamenz, Lubań, and Bautzen.

In 1429 and 1431 the town was unsuccessfully besieged by the Hussites. In 1634, it was destroyed by the Swedes during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. It was the site of one of the battlefields of the Napoleonic War Battle of Bautzen in 1813. In 1868, the name was officially changed from &quot;Budissin&quot; to the more Germanized form &quot;Bautzen&quot;.

In 1839, the Sorbian student organization &quot;&quot; was founded in the city. In 1845, the Sorbian national anthem was publicly performed for the first time in the city. The &quot;Sorbian House&quot; (), a Sorbian cultural centre, was opened in the city in 1904.

After the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in 1933, many political prisoners were held in the Bautzen I and Bautzen II prisons, built in 1904 and 1906, respectively. During the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; in 1938, local Jews were persecuted and Jewish-owned businesses were destroyed. During World War II, in 1942–1943, the Nazis conducted three trials of members of the Polish resistance at the local court, sentencing thirteen to death. The &quot;AL Bautzen&quot; subcamp of the Groß-Rosen concentration camp operated in Bautzen. At least 600 men, mostly Poles, but also of other nationalities, were imprisoned there, about 310 of whom died. Ernst Thälmann was imprisoned there before being deported to Buchenwald. In April 1945, the Germans evacuated many prisoners on foot to Nixdorf, where they were liberated by Polish troops on May 8, 1945, while the remaining prisoners were liberated in Bautzen by the Soviets on April 20, 1945. Between 21 April and 30 April 1945, the Battle of Bautzen was fought which resulted in the town being recaptured by the German army. This meant Bautzen and its surroundings stayed in German hands until Germany&#x27;s capitulation.

From 1952 to 1990, Bautzen was part of the Bezirk Dresden of East Germany. Bautzen was infamous throughout East Germany for its two penitentiaries. &quot;Bautzen I&quot; was used as an official prison, soon to be nicknamed &quot;&quot; (&quot;Yellow Misery&quot;) due to its outer colour, whereas the more secretive &quot;Bautzen II&quot; was used as a facility to hold political prisoners, dissidents and prisoners of conscience. Today, Bautzen I is known as the Bautzen Correctional Institution and is used to hold prisoners who are awaiting trial. Bautzen II which was also operated by the GDR&#x27;s Ministry for State Security, has served as an open memorial since 1993, operated by the Saxon Memorials Foundation. It is accessible to the public. Guided tours are provided and occasionally, films are screened. A permanent exhibition depicts the misery suffered by occupants; visitors may tour detention cells, the isolation area and the yards where prisoners were allowed to exercise.

In 2002 the city commemorated its 1000th birthday. In 2010 it was hit by a flood.

===Population development=== 
During the Early Middle Ages, Bautzen was one of the largest cities in Central Germany. However, from around the 15th century, its population growth began to stagnate. The relatively late onset of industrialization in Bautzen brought new momentum, leading to population growth even during the era of East Germany. Following the Peaceful Revolution of 1990, however, the city’s population declined significantly, dropping from 52,000 in 1989 to around 38,000, largely due to emigration and low birth rates. Since the early 2000s, this decline has slowed considerably. Today, Bautzen ranks as the 10th largest city in Saxony by population.

As of December 31, 2011, 98.3% of Bautzen&#x27;s residents were of German origin, with 6.1% having a migration background.

<text>Pellagra is a disease caused by a lack of the vitamin niacin (vitamin B3). Symptoms include inflamed skin, diarrhea, dementia, and sores in the mouth. Areas of the skin exposed to friction and radiation are typically affected first. Over time affected skin may become darker, stiffen, peel, or bleed.
There are two main types of pellagra, primary and secondary. Primary pellagra is due to a diet that does not contain enough niacin and tryptophan. Secondary pellagra is due to a poor ability to use the niacin within the diet. This can occur as a result of alcoholism, long-term diarrhea, carcinoid syndrome, Hartnup disease, and a number of medications such as isoniazid. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and may be assisted by urine testing.
Treatment is with either nicotinic acid or nicotinamide supplementation. Improvements typically begin within a couple of days. General improvements in diet are also frequently recommended. Decreasing sun exposure via sunscreen and proper clothing is important while the skin heals. Without treatment death may occur. The disease occurs most commonly in the developing world, often as a disease of poverty associated with malnutrition, specifically sub-Saharan Africa.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The classic symptoms of pellagra are diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death (&quot;the four Ds&quot;).
A more comprehensive list of symptoms includes:
* Dermatitis (characteristic &quot;broad collar&quot; rash known as casal collar)
* Hair loss
* Swelling
* Smooth, beefy red glossitis (tongue inflammation)
* Trouble sleeping
* Weakness
* Mental confusion or aggression
* Ataxia (lack of coordination), paralysis of extremities, peripheral neuritis (nerve damage)
* Diarrhea
* Dilated cardiomyopathy (enlarged, weakened heart)
* Sensitivity to radiation
* Eventually dementia

J. Frostigs and Tom Spies—according to Cleary and Cleary—described more specific psychological symptoms of pellagra as:
* Psychosensory disturbances (impressions as being painful, annoying bright lights, odors intolerance causing nausea and vomiting, dizziness after sudden movements),
* Psychomotor disturbances (restlessness, tense and a desire to quarrel, increased preparedness for motor action), as well as
* Emotional disturbances

Independently of clinical symptoms, blood level of tryptophan or urinary metabolites such as 2-pyridone/N-methylnicotinamide ratio &lt;2 or NAD/NADP ratio in red blood cells can diagnose pellagra. The diagnosis is confirmed by rapid improvements in symptoms after doses of nicotinamide (250–500 mg/day) or nicotinamide enriched food.

== Pathophysiology ==
Pellagra can develop according to several mechanisms, classically as a result of niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency, which results in decreased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Since NAD and its phosphorylated NADP form are cofactors required in many body processes, the pathological impact of pellagra is broad and results in death if not treated.

The first mechanism is simple dietary lack of niacin. Second, it may result from deficiency of tryptophan, an essential amino acid found in meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and peanuts, which the body uses to make niacin. Third, it may be caused by excess leucine, as it inhibits quinolinate phosphoribosyl transferase (QPRT) and inhibits the formation of nicotinic acid to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) causing pellagra-like symptoms to occur.

Some conditions can prevent the absorption of dietary niacin or tryptophan and lead to pellagra. Inflammation of the jejunum or ileum can prevent nutrient absorption, leading to pellagra, and this can in turn be caused by Crohn&#x27;s disease. Gastroenterostomy can also cause pellagra. Chronic alcoholism can also cause poor absorption, which combined with a diet already low in niacin and tryptophan produces pellagra. Hartnup disease is a genetic disorder that reduces tryptophan absorption, leading to pellagra.

Alterations in protein metabolism may also produce pellagra-like symptoms. An example is carcinoid syndrome, a disease in which neuroendocrine tumors along the GI tract use tryptophan as the source for serotonin production, which limits the available tryptophan for niacin synthesis. In normal patients, only one percent of dietary tryptophan is converted to serotonin; however, in patients with carcinoid syndrome, this value may increase to 70%. Carcinoid syndrome thus may produce niacin deficiency and clinical manifestations of pellagra. Anti-tuberculosis medication tends to bind to vitamin B6 and reduce niacin synthesis, since B6 (pyridoxine) is a required cofactor in the tryptophan-to-niacin reaction.

Several therapeutic drugs can provoke pellagra. These include the antibiotics isoniazid, which decreases available B6 by binding to it and making it inactive, so it cannot be used in niacin synthesis, and chloramphenicol; the anti-cancer agent fluorouracil; and the immunosuppressant mercaptopurine.

== Treatment ==
If untreated, pellagra can kill within four or five years. Treatment is with nicotinamide, which has the same vitamin function as nicotinic acid and a similar chemical structure, but has lower toxicity. The frequency and amount of nicotinamide administered depends on the degree to which the condition has progressed.

== Epidemiology ==

Pellagra can be common in people who obtain most of their food energy from corn, notably rural South America, where maize is a staple food. If maize is not nixtamalized, it is a poor source of tryptophan, as well as niacin. Nixtamalization corrects the niacin deficiency, and is a common practice in Native American cultures that grow corn, but most especially in Mexico and the countries of Central America. Following the corn cycle, the symptoms usually appear during spring, increase in the summer due to greater sun exposure, and return the following spring. Indeed, pellagra was once endemic in the poorer states of the U.S. South, such as Mississippi and Alabama, where its cyclical appearance in the spring after meat-heavy winter diets led to it being known as &quot;spring sickness&quot; (particularly when it appeared among more vulnerable children), as well as among the residents of jails and orphanages as studied by Dr. Joseph Goldberger.

Pellagra is common in Africa, Indonesia, and China. In affluent societies, a majority of patients with clinical pellagra are poor, homeless, alcohol-dependent, or psychiatric patients who refuse food. Pellagra was common among prisoners of Soviet labor camps (the Gulags). In addition, pellagra, as a micronutrient deficiency disease, frequently affects populations of refugees and other displaced people due to their unique, long-term residential circumstances and dependence on food aid. Refugees typically rely on limited sources of vitamin B3 provided to them, often peanuts (which, in Africa, may be supplied in place of local groundnut staples, such as the Bambara or Hausa groundnut); the instability in the nutritional content and distribution of food aid can be the cause of pellagra in displaced populations. In the 2000s, there were outbreaks in countries such as Angola, Zimbabwe and Nepal. In Angola specifically, recent reports show a similar incidence of pellagra since 2002, with clinical pellagra in 0.3% of women and 0.2% of children and niacin deficiency in 29.4% of women and 6% of children related to high untreated corn consumption.

In other countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark, even with sufficient intake of niacin, cases have been reported. In this case, deficiency might happen not just because of poverty or malnutrition but secondary to alcoholism, drug interaction (psychotropic, cytostatic, tuberculostatic or analgesics), HIV, vitamin B2 and B6 deficiency, or malabsorption syndromes such as Hartnup disease and carcinoid tumors.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;&quot; is known to come from Lombard, but its exact origins are disputed. &quot;Pell&quot; certainly arises from classical Latin , meaning &quot;skin&quot;. &quot;-agra&quot; may arise from Lombard , meaning &quot;like serum or holly juice&quot;, or the Latinate , a suffix for maladies itself borrowed from the Greek , meaning &quot;a catch-point, a hunting trap&quot;.

== History ==

Native American cultivators who first domesticated corn (maize) prepared it by nixtamalization, in which the grain is treated with a solution of alkali such as lime. Nixtamalization makes the niacin nutritionally available and prevents pellagra. When maize was cultivated worldwide, and eaten as a staple without nixtamalization, pellagra became common.

Pellagra was first described for its dermatological effect in Spain in 1735 by Gaspar Casal. He explained that the disease causes dermatitis in exposed skin areas such as hands, feet and neck and that the origin of the disease is poor diet and atmospheric influences. His work published in 1762 by his friend Juan Sevillano was titled &quot;Historia Natural y Medicina del Principado de Asturias&quot; or &quot;Natural and Medical History of the Principality of Asturias&quot; (1762). This led to the disease being known as &quot;Asturian leprosy&quot;, and it is recognized as the first modern pathological description of a syndrome. It was an endemic disease in northern Italy, where it was named, from Lombard, by Francesco Frapolli of Milan. With pellagra affecting over 100,000 people in Italy by the 1880s, debates raged as to how to classify the disease (as a form of scurvy, elephantiasis or as something new), and over its causation. In the 19th century, Roussel started a campaign in France to restrict consumption of maize and eradicated the disease in France, but it remained endemic in many rural areas of Europe. Because pellagra outbreaks occurred in regions where maize was a dominant food crop, the most convincing hypothesis during the late 19th century, as espoused by Cesare Lombroso, was that the maize either carried a toxic substance or was a carrier of disease. Louis Sambon, an Anglo-Italian doctor working at the London School of Tropical Medicine, was convinced that pellagra was carried by an insect, along the lines of malaria. Later, the lack of pellagra outbreaks in Mesoamerica, where maize is a major food crop, led researchers to investigate processing techniques in that region.

Pellagra was studied mostly in Europe until the late 19th century when it became epidemic especially in the southern United States. In the early 1900s, pellagra reached epidemic proportions in the American South. Between 1906 and 1940 more than 3 million Americans were affected by pellagra with more than 100,000 deaths, yet the epidemic resolved itself right after dietary niacin fortification. Pellagra deaths in South Carolina numbered 1,306 during the first ten months of 1915; 100,000 Southerners were affected in 1916. At this time, the scientific community held that pellagra was probably caused by a germ or some unknown toxin in corn. The Spartanburg Pellagra Hospital in Spartanburg, South Carolina, was the nation&#x27;s first facility dedicated to discovering the cause of pellagra. It was established in 1914 with a special Congressional appropriation to the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) and set up primarily for research. In 1915, Dr. Joseph Goldberger, assigned to study pellagra by the Surgeon General of the United States, showed it was linked to diet by observing the outbreaks of pellagra in orphanages and mental hospitals. Goldberger noted that children between the ages of 6 and 12 (but not older or younger children at the orphanages) and patients at the mental hospitals (but not doctors or nurses) were the ones who seemed most susceptible to pellagra. Goldberger theorized that a lack of meat, milk, eggs, and legumes made those particular populations susceptible to pellagra. By modifying the diet served in these institutions with &quot;a marked increase in the fresh animal and the leguminous protein foods,&quot; Goldberger was able to show that pellagra could be prevented. By 1926, Goldberger established that a diet that included these foods, or a small amount of brewer&#x27;s yeast, prevented pellagra.

Goldberger experimented on 11 prisoners (one was dismissed because of prostatitis). Before the experiment, the prisoners were eating the prison fare fed to all inmates at Rankin Prison Farm in Mississippi. Goldberger started feeding them a restricted diet of grits, syrup, mush, biscuits, cabbage, sweet potatoes, rice, collards, and coffee with sugar (no milk). Healthy white male volunteers were selected as the typical skin lesions were easier to see in Caucasians and this population was felt to be those least susceptible to the disease, and thus provide the strongest evidence that the disease was caused by a nutritional deficiency. Subjects experienced mild, but typical cognitive and gastrointestinal symptoms, and within five months of this cereal-based diet, 6 of the 11 subjects broke out in the skin lesions that are necessary for a definitive diagnosis of pellagra. The lesions appeared first on the scrotum. Goldberger was not given the opportunity to experimentally reverse the effects of diet-induced pellagra as the prisoners were released shortly after the diagnoses of pellagra were confirmed. In the 1920s, he connected pellagra to the corn-based diets of rural areas rather than infection as contemporary medical opinion would suggest. Goldberger believed that the root cause of pellagra amongst Southern farmers was limited diet resulting from poverty, and that social and land reform would cure epidemic pellagra. His reform efforts were not realized, but crop diversification in the Southern United States, and the accompanying improvement in diet, dramatically reduced the risk of pellagra. Goldberger is remembered as the &quot;unsung hero of American clinical epidemiology&quot;. Though he identified that a missing nutritional element was responsible for pellagra, he did not discover the specific vitamin responsible.

In 1937, Conrad Elvehjem, a biochemistry professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, showed that the vitamin B3 cured pellagra (manifested as black tongue) in dogs. Later studies by Dr. Tom Spies, Marion Blankenhorn, and Clark Cooper established that niacin also cured pellagra in humans, for which &quot;Time&quot; Magazine dubbed them its 1938 Men of the Year in comprehensive science.

Research conducted between 1900 and 1950 found the number of cases of women with pellagra was consistently double the number of cases of affected men. This is thought to be due to the inhibitory effect of estrogen on the conversion of the amino acid tryptophan to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN). Some researchers of the time gave a few explanations regarding the difference.

Gillman and Gillman related skeletal tissue and pellagra in their research in South Africans. They provide some of the best evidence for skeletal manifestations of pellagra and the reaction of bone in malnutrition. They claimed radiological studies of adult pellagrins demonstrated marked osteoporosis. A negative mineral balance in pellagrins was noted, which indicated active mobilization and excretion of endogenous mineral substances, and undoubtedly impacted the turnover of bone. Extensive dental caries were present in over half of pellagra patients. In most cases, caries were associated with &quot;severe gingival retraction, sepsis, exposure of cementum, and loosening of teeth&quot;.

Pellagra was first reported in 1902 in the United States, and has &quot;caused more deaths than any other nutrition-related disease in American history&quot;, reaching epidemic proportions in the American South during the early 1900s. Poverty and consumption of corn were the most frequently observed risk factors, but the exact cause was not known, until groundbreaking work by Joseph Goldberger. A 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research paper explored the role of cotton production in the emergence of disease; one prominent theory is that &quot;widespread cotton production had displaced local production of niacin-rich foods and driven poor Southern farmers and mill workers to consume milled Midwestern corn, which was relatively cheap but also devoid of the niacin necessary to prevent pellagra.&quot; The study provided evidence in favor of the theory: there were lower pellagra rates in areas where farmers had been forced to abandon cotton production (a highly profitable crop) in favor of food crops (less profitable crops) due to boll weevil infestation of cotton crops (which occurred randomly).

Pellagra developed especially among the vulnerable populations in institutions such as orphanages and prisons, because of the monotonous and restricted diet. Soon pellagra began to occur in epidemic proportions in states south of the Potomac and Ohio rivers. The pellagra epidemic lasted for nearly four decades beginning in 1906. It was estimated that there were 3 million cases, and 100,000 deaths due to pellagra during the epidemic.

The pellagra epidemic in the American south had subsided in periods of low cotton production (late 1910s to early 1920s, the Great Depression), but it had consistently rebounded as cotton production recovered. The cause would not be understood until 1937, when the relation with niacin was discovered. Voluntary food fortification and periods of mandatory fortification on the state and federal levels soon followed, coinciding with a continuous drop in pellagra deaths. By the 1950s, the disease was virtually eliminated from the US.

==== Corn processing ====
The whole dried corn kernel contains a nutritious germ and a thin seed coat that provides some fiber. There are two important considerations for using ground whole-grain corn.
# The germ contains oil that is exposed by grinding, thus whole-grain cornmeal and grits turn rancid quickly at room temperature and should be refrigerated.
# Whole-grain cornmeal and grits require extended cooking times as seen in the following cooking directions for whole-grain grits: 

The milling of corn removes the aleurone and germ layers, removing much of the (already low) amounts of bioavailable niacin and tryptophan found within. The milling and degerming of corn in the preparation of cornmeal became feasible with the development of the Beall degerminator, which was originally patented in 1901 and was used to separate the grit from the germ in corn processing. Casimir Funk, who helped elucidate the role of thiamin in the etiology of beriberi, was an early investigator of the problem of pellagra. Funk suggested that a change in the method of milling corn was responsible for the outbreak of pellagra, but no attention was paid to his article on this subject.

==In popular culture==
* George Sessions Perry&#x27;s 1941 novel &quot;Hold Autumn in Your Hand&quot;and Jean Renoir&#x27;s 1945 film adaptation of it, &quot;The Southerner&quot;incorporates pellagra (&quot;spring sickness&quot;) as a major plot element in the story of an impoverished Texas farm family.
* Satirical singer/pianist Tom Lehrer referred to pellagra as an endemic disease of the Southern states in the lyrics of his 1960 song &quot;I Wanna Go Back to Dixie&quot; -- &quot;I&#x27;ll go back to the Swanee / Where pellagra makes ya scrawny / And the honeysuckle clutters up the vine.&quot;
* Season 2, Episode 22 of House, titled &quot;Forever&quot;, focuses on a new mother diagnosed with Pellagra who experiences aggression and homicidal tendencies
