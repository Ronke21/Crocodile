<text>The Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) is a military decoration of the United States Armed Forces. The medal was established on July 2, 1926, and is awarded to those who, after April 6, 1917, have distinguished themselves by single acts of heroism or extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight. Both heroism and extraordinary achievement are entirely distinctive, involving operations that are not routine. The medal may be awarded to friendly foreign military members in ranks equivalent to the U.S. paygrade of O-6 and below in combat or support operations.

==History==

The first award of the Distinguished Flying Cross was made by President Calvin Coolidge on May 2, 1927, to ten aviators of the U.S. Army Air Corps who had participated in the Army Pan American Flight which took place from December 21, 1926, to May 2, 1927. Two of the airmen died in a mid-air collision trying to land at Buenos Aires on February 26, 1927, and received their awards posthumously. The award had only been authorized by Congress the previous year and no medals had yet been struck, so the Pan American airmen initially received only certificates. Among the ten airmen were Major Herbert Dargue, Captains Ira C. Eaker and Muir S. Fairchild, and First Lieutenant Ennis C. Whitehead.

Charles Lindbergh received the first presentation of the actual medal about a month later from Coolidge during the Washington, D.C., homecoming reception on June 11, 1927, from his trans-Atlantic flight. The medal had hurriedly been struck and readied just for that occasion. The 1927 War Department General Order (G.O. 8) authorizing Lindbergh&#x27;s DFC states that it was awarded by the president, while the General Order (G.O. 6) for the Pan American Flyers&#x27; DFC citation notes that the War Department awarded it &quot;by direction of the President.&quot; The first Distinguished Flying Cross to be awarded to a Naval aviator was received by Commander Richard E. Byrd, USN for his trans-Atlantic flight from June 29 to July 1, 1927, from New York City to the coast of France. Byrd and his pilot Machinist Floyd Bennett had already received the Medal of Honor for their historic flight to the North Pole on May 9, 1926.

Numerous recipients of the medal earned greater fame in other occupations; a number of astronauts, actors, and politicians have been Distinguished Flying Cross recipients, including President George H. W. Bush. The DFC may be retroactively awarded to recognize notable accomplishments made at any time after the beginning of American participation in World War I. On February 23, 1929, Congress passed special legislation to allow the award of the DFC to the Wright brothers for their December 17, 1903, flight. Other civilians who have received the award include Wiley Post, Jacqueline Cochran, Roscoe Turner, Amelia Earhart, Glenn H. Curtiss, and Eugene Ely. Eventually, it was limited to military personnel by an Executive Order. Amelia Earhart became the first woman to receive the DFC on July 29, 1932, when it was presented to her by Vice President Charles Curtis in Los Angeles for her solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean earlier that year.

== World War I ==
The only Distinguished Flying Cross for World War I service was posthumously awarded on June 14, 2017, when 95th Aero Squadron Commander and Army Captain James Ely Miller was recognized for his actions on March 9, 1918, which made him the first American aviator serving with an American unit to die in that war.

== World War II ==
During World War II, the medal&#x27;s award criteria varied widely depending on the theater of operations, aerial combat that was engaged in, and the missions that were accomplished. In the Pacific, commissioned officers were often awarded the DFC, while enlisted men were given the Air Medal. In Europe, some crews received it for their overall performance through a tour of duty. The criteria used were however not consistent between commands or over time. Individual achievement could also result in the medal being awarded. For example, George McGovern received one for the successful completion of a bombing mission in which his aircraft lost an engine and then was landed safely. On December 28, 1944, Aleda Lutz became the first military woman to receive the DFC, which she received posthumously.

==Criteria==
The Distinguished Flying Cross was authorized by Section 12 of the United States Army Air Corps Act enacted by Congress on July 2, 1926, as amended by Executive Order 7786 on January 8, 1938 and USC 10, 9279. This act provided for the award to be given to any person who distinguishes themselves &quot;by heroism or extraordinary achievement while participating in an aerial flight&quot; while serving in any capacity with the Air Corps.

==Appearance==
The Distinguished Flying Cross was designed by Elizabeth Will and Arthur E. DuBois. The medal is a bronze cross pattee, on whose obverse is superimposed a four-bladed propeller, 1 11/16 inches in width. Five rays extend from the reentrant angles, forming a one-inch square. The reverse is blank; it is suitable for engraving the recipient&#x27;s name and rank. The cross is suspended from a rectangular bar.

The suspension and service ribbon of the medal is 1 3/8 inches wide and consists of the following stripes: 3/32 inch Ultramarine Blue 67118; 9/64 inch White 67101; 11/32 inch Ultramarine Blue 67118; 3/64 inch White 67101; center stripe 3/32 inch Old Glory Red 67156; 3/64 inch White 67101; 11/32 inch Ultramarine Blue 67118; 9/64 inch White 67101; 3/32 inch Ultramarine Blue 67118.

===Devices===

Additional awards of the Distinguished Flying Cross are shown with bronze or silver Oak Leaf Clusters for the Army, Air Force, and Space Force, and gold and silver Inch Stars for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.

The Army, Air Force, Space Force, Navy, and Marine Corps may authorize the &quot;V&quot; device for wear on the DFC to denote valor in combat. The services can also award the DFC for extraordinary achievement without the &quot;V&quot; device.

On January 7, 2016, a Secretary of Defense memorandum standardized the use of the &quot;V&quot; device as a valor-only device across the services. The Department of Defense published &quot;DOD Manuals 1348.33, Volumes 1-4, DOD Military Decorations and Awards&quot; which unified the criteria for awards. DOD 1348.33. &quot;Army Regulation 600-8-22, Military Awards&quot; authorizes use of the &quot;V&quot; Device with the DFC for combat valor and the &quot;C&quot; Device for meritorious service or achievement under combat conditions.

==DFC National Memorial Act==
In July 2014, the United States Senate passed the Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial Act. The act was sponsored by Senator Barbara Boxer, to designate the Distinguished Flying Cross Memorial at March Field Air Museum adjacent to March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, California, as a national memorial to recognize members of United States Armed Forces who have distinguished themselves by heroism in aerial flight. The act was signed into law by President Barack Obama on July 25, 2014.

<doc id="347793" wikidata="Q7342928" url="?curid=347793" title="Robert Chung">
<text>Robert Chung (; born 7 September 1957) is a Hong Kong academic. He is president and chief executive officer of the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, an independent institute since May 2019 and the successor organisation of the Public Opinion Programme of the University of Hong Kong (POP), of which he was long-time head.

In 2000, Chung wrote an academic article stating that he felt pressure to stop conducting public opinion research polls. Later known as the &#x27;Robert Chung affair&#x27;, his article showed that freedom of speech was still alive in Hong Kong.

== Education and career ==
Chung graduated from Diocesan Boys&#x27; School. He obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree, Master of Philosophy in Sociology and PhD Degree from The University of Hong Kong. His fields of research interest include electoral studies, political culture, public opinion, rural politics, mobility studies, media performance, youth culture and tradition in modernity.

He joined the Social Sciences Research Centre of the University of Hong Kong when it was established in 1987. In 1991, he set up the POP within the centre and began to study the development of public opinion in Hong Kong. To match the development of the university, Chung and his POP team was transferred to the Journalism and Media Studies Centre at the university on 1 May 2000, and then back to the Faculty of Social Sciences on 1 January 2002.

The programme regularly conducts independent surveys, covers media development, and launches electoral studies, policy issues, and youth studies. Under his leadership, the programme is famous for being impartial and professional, and is a highly respected public opinion study programme in the region. Its studies are widely covered in mass media and frequently cited in academic publications.

Chung has written numerous articles on public opinion and social surveys published in various journals and periodicals, and is the Chief Editor of the monthly POP newsletter, &quot;POP Express&quot;, and of the HKU POP Site.

In addition, Chung is a member of the Television Programme Advisory Panel of Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) and also of the Television Programme Appreciation Index Research Panel. From 1993 to 1994, Chung served as a part-time community panellist of the Central Policy Unit of the Hong Kong Government. He then became a part-time member of the Central Policy Unit between 1994 and 1999. Between 1997 and 2003, he served as a member of the Community Research Sub-committee of the Citizens Advisory Committee on Community Relations of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), and between 1998 and 2003, as a member of the Citizens Advisory Committee on Community Relations.

Internationally, he has been the Hong Kong representative at the World Association for Public Opinion Research (WAPOR) for a number of years. From 2006 to 2008, Chung was the elected Secretary-Treasurer of WAPOR. He was elected as WAPOR president for 2023–2024. He is also a member of the editorial board of the International Journal of Public Opinion Research.

=== Pollgate ===

In the summer of 2000, he sparked a controversy over the alleged government interference in his Public Opinion Programme. He alleged that he had received political pressure from Chief Executive of Hong Kong Tung Chee-hwa through Vice-Chancellor Cheng Yiu-chung and Pro-Vice-Chancellor Wong Siu-lun to discontinue his public opinion polls on Tung and his government.

Although the allegations were denied by Tung and HKU, controversy erupted over the question of political interference in academic freedom. HKU set up a three-member panel led by Justice Noel Power to investigate Chung&#x27;s claims. After 11 days of open hearings in August, the panel concluded that there were what it called &quot;covert attempts&quot; to pressure Chung into discontinuing his polls. The panel concluded that Chung was &quot;an honest witness who was telling the truth in relation to the matters he is complaining about&quot;, but &quot;neither Lo [The Chief Executive&#x27;s Senior Special Assistant] nor the vice chancellor disclosed the full and truthful extent of what was said in [the] meetings&quot;. The saga ended with the resignation of the Vice-Chancellor and Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong – Cheng Yiu-chung and Wong Siu-lun respectively – just before the University Council met on 9 September to vote on whether or not to accept the panel&#x27;s report. At the end, Chung&#x27;s Public Opinion Programme continued to function and went from strength to strength in the years following, becoming arguably Hong Kong&#x27;s most authoritative source of public opinion information and assessment.

<text>The Prisoner of War Medal is a military award of the United States Armed Forces which was authorized by Congress and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on 8 November 1985. The United States Code citation for the POW Medal statute is .

The Prisoner of War Medal may be awarded to any person who was a prisoner of war after April 5, 1917 (the date of the United States&#x27; entry into World War I was April 6). It is awarded to any person who was taken prisoner or held captive while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States; while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing Armed Force; or while serving with friendly forces engaged in armed conflict against an opposing Armed Force in which the United States is not a belligerent party. As of an amendment to Title 10 of the United States Code in 2013, the medal is also awarded for captivity under circumstances &quot;which the Secretary concerned finds were comparable to those circumstances under which persons have generally been held captive by enemy armed forces during periods of armed conflict.&quot; The person&#x27;s conduct, while in captivity, must have been honorable. This medal may be awarded posthumously to the surviving next of kin of the recipient.

No more than one Prisoner of War Medal may be awarded. For any subsequent award of the medal, service stars will be awarded and worn on the suspension and service ribbon of the medal.

The medal was designed by Jay C. Morris of the United States Army Institute of Heraldry.

==Legal==

===Legislative proposals for the medal===
The idea of creating a military award to recognize prisoners of war was first put forth in 1944. However, the military services opposed the idea, claiming that other medals could be awarded in such cases. Congressman F. Edward Hébert (D-LA) submitted a bill to create a POW lapel button in 1971, but the bill was defeated. The Defense Department told Herbert that the pin &quot;could have an adverse impact on the morale and pride of those families whose members are or were missing in action,&quot; and also claimed that it was inappropriate to seem to reward soldiers for having suffered with &quot;such an undesirable status&quot; as prisoners of war.

The first Senate bill to create a POW Medal was submitted by Senator John G. Tower (R-TX) in the same year, but his bill was also defeated due to opposition by the military services. Congressman G. William Whitehurst (R-VA) proposed the medal again in 1975, and was informed by the Department of Defense that &quot;the present hierarchy of military awards is adequate for recognizing valorous and meritorious acts&quot; performed by former POWs. The Iran hostage crisis in 1979 changed the attitudes of many Americans toward POWs, and helped convince Congress to authorize a POW Medal.

In April 1981, only months after the Iran hostages were released, Congressman Robert Badham (R-CA) introduced the POW Medal yet again. This bill was also defeated. Senator Alan K. Simpson (R-WY) asked the Department of Defense to create a &quot;Prisoner of War Recognition Medal&quot; in 1983, and the Department of the Army informed him that awards were only intended as &quot;an incentive to achieve some higher goal or perform some desired service&quot; and maintained that surrendering did not accomplish any such goal. Only in 1985 did Congress pass legislation creating the POW Medal, notably over the Pentagon&#x27;s objections.

===Original legislation===
The statute that established the POW Medal was Public Law 99–145, Title V, Sec. 532(a)(1), Nov. 8, 1985. The public law in question, which began as S.1160, was the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1986, sponsored by Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona. It was first amended on May 21, 1985, by Senator William V. Roth, Jr. to include the language that first established eligibility criteria for the POW Medal in Title 10, § 1128.

According to Roth, &quot;This amendment will formally recognize that character of military service which arises under the most hostile and difficult of circumstances -- that of being held prisoner by the enemy.&quot; The House version of this amendment was submitted on June 21, by Congressman Robert J. Lagomarsino. According to Lagomarsino, &quot;Official recognition of American prisoners of war is long overdue, Mr. Chairman. This medal will honor the more than 142,000 prisoners of war, and their families, who have sacrificed their liberty for the freedom of this country during World War I, World War II, and the Korean and Vietnam wars.&quot;

====Scope of legislation====
The original wording contained in Public Law 99-145 only authorized the POW Medal for service members held captive &quot;while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States; while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force; or while serving with friendly forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.&quot;

Accordingly, DoD policy articulated in 1988 concluded that only military captives taken prisoner by enemy or opposing states during active armed conflict were eligible for the award. Specifically, DoD policy stated that &quot;hostages of terrorists and persons detained by governments with which the US is not actively engaged in armed conflict are not eligible for the medal.&quot;

The armed conflict requirements in 10 USC 1128(a)(1-3) were drawn verbatim from a 1963 Act of Congress that added the same criteria to most valor awards, which is why the original POW Medal shares the same combat prerequisites with the Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star, and other valor awards. In 1963 Congress drew these three permutations of combat from President Kennedy&#x27;s executive order of April 25, 1962, which added the same criteria to the Purple Heart. Kennedy had also added similar criteria for the Bronze Star prior to the 1963 act.

The 1963 law was necessary because Cold War armed conflicts did not qualify for consideration under previous statutes such as the 1918 Act of Congress that required valor &quot;in action involving actual conflict with an enemy&quot; for awards such as the Medal of Honor and Distinguished Service Cross. Requiring conflict with an enemy was problematic since the United States had not formally declared war since World War II as a result of the provisions of the United Nations Charter. According to congressional testimony by the Army&#x27;s deputy chief of staff for personnel, the services were seeking authority to award the Medal of Honor and other valor awards retroactive to July 1, 1958, in areas such as Berlin, Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu Islands, Taiwan Straits, Congo, Laos, Vietnam, and Cuba. These were all areas where the DoD authorized the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal.

====Challenges to legislation====
A congressional inquiry on behalf of the former crew of , who were detained in North Korea in 1968, resulted in a 1988 DoD General Counsel opinion authored by Kathleen A. Buck. The general counsel argued that the Pueblo&#x27;s &quot;passive type of activity hardly qualifies ... as an &#x27;action&#x27;, a term that denotes violence in the employment of weapons.&quot; Therefore, Buck concluded that the Pueblo crew was not involved in active armed conflict and fell outside the statute, a position that was hotly contested by the crew and even by the congressmen who authored the legislation. Commander Lloyd M. Bucher, the former commanding officer of the &quot;Pueblo&quot;, responded to the review and petitioned directly to the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Carlisle Trost. Bucher claimed that the DoD&#x27;s position on the medal was &quot;simply contrary to the facts,&quot; noting that the &quot;Pueblo&quot; crew received the Navy&#x27;s Combat Action Ribbon &quot;specifically for surface combat with North Korea on 23 January 1968.&quot;

Bucher&#x27;s petition eventually resulted in the Navy&#x27;s supporting an amendment to the POW Medal statute to allow eligibility for service members taken captive during situations other than armed conflict. Congressman Robert Lagomarsino, author of the original POW Medal legislation, also agreed with Bucher. He said in an affidavit that the &quot;Pueblo&quot; crew were denied the medal due to a &quot;technicality,&quot; and claimed that &quot;it was never my intent to preclude the crew members of the USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; from eligibility for this medal.&quot;

Others, including the military hostages held during the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis in Tehran, Iran from 1979 to 1981, likewise objected to their ineligibility. Responding to May 1989 congressional inquiry on behalf of the Iran hostages, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense David J. Berteau, a career civilian who had never served in the U.S. armed forces, noted that, &quot;...many Service members have been held as hostages, detainees or internees who do not meet the criteria for award of the POW Medal.&quot;

Berteau explained that the criteria for the medal applied only in &quot;wartime situations,&quot; and argued that, &quot;...once the criteria is divorced from wartime situations, it will be difficult to establish a basis for the award in the many other circumstances which could occur.&quot; In addition, Berteau argued with regard to granting the medal to people captured outside formal armed conflict, i.e., being detained by those who are not officially enemies of the United States. &quot;If the criteria were changed to recognize all members held as prisoners, hostages, detainees and internees,&quot; he said, &quot; the recognition originally intended for actual prisoners of war will be lost.&quot;

===1989 expansion===
 was later modified by , Nov. 29, 1989, which originated from H.R.2461, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1990 and 1991. Sponsored by Representative Les Aspin, the bill added the fourth paragraph to Title 10 § 1128 and authorized the POW Medal for those captured &quot;by foreign armed forces that are hostile to the United States, under circumstances which the Secretary concerned finds to have been comparable to those under which persons have generally been held captive by enemy armed forces during periods of armed conflict.&quot;

This amendment was the result of congressional recognition of multiple groups of individuals who were not originally authorized to receive the medal after Department of Defense review, such as the &quot;USS Pueblo&quot; crew detained in North Korea in 1968, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army Air Forces flight crews interned in the neutral USSR during World War II, the U.S. Army Air Forces crews interned in neutral Switzerland during World War II, U.S. Marine Corps Colonel William R. Higgins who was kidnapped in 1988 and executed by Hezbollah-affiliated terrorists, and the U.S. Marines from the U.S. Embassy in Teheran, Iran who were held hostage by terrorists from 1979 to 1981 in the Iran Hostage Crisis. The 1989 amendment is no longer in the statute; it was later removed by the 2013 amendment, due to policy mistakes that effectively precluded its implementation.

====Intent of 1989 amendment====
As expressed by the House Committee on Armed Services in report 101–121, the original intent of the POW Medal statute was to allow the award in incidents such as the &quot;USS Pueblo&quot; capture, but that due to the wording of the statute the detainees simply did not &quot;meet the literal requirements of the law.&quot; Admiral J.M. Boorda, the (then) Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, made a policy statement to the House Committee on Armed Services on behalf of OSD and OMB: &quot;Within the Department of Defense, the general counsel has determined that the &quot;Pueblo&quot; crew does not, under the current statute, qualify for the POW medal…Additionally, persons detained by governments with which the United States is not engaged actively in armed conflict are not eligible for the POW medal. As a result, if an award is to be made, and I believe it should be, it is necessary to amend the existing statute that is currently being processed through the Department.&quot; Rep. Jim Slattery, who drafted the House version of the 1989 amendment to 10 USC § 1128, explained to the House Committee on Armed Services that the amendment was intended to remedy &quot;a quirk in the law&quot; that required active armed conflict against an enemy state.

As a result, detainees of non-enemies such as the crew of the USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; were not eligible for consideration for the award, since &quot;the United States was not in open conflict with North Korea at the time the USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; was attacked.&quot; According to Senator Alan Cranston, who drafted the Senate version of the 1989 amendment to 10 USC § 1128, &quot;The Department of Defense has interpreted that provision [Public Law 99-145], which is codified at section 1128 of title 10, as not permitting the award of [the POW Medal] to individuals who were taken and held as prisoner in situations other than the classical prisoner-of-war situation during armed conflict. As a result, the medal has not been awarded to such former captives as the crewmembers of the USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; and the military personnel who were held captive in Iran during the seizure of the United States Embassy in Teheran.&quot; Cranston stated explicitly that the amendment was intended to &quot;include [as] eligible for the medal those individuals who were held captive in neutral or allied countries in situations similar to those of prisoner-of-war conditions during armed conflict.&quot;

====Scope of final amendment====
The Senate members of the conference committee for the FY1990 National Defense Authorization Act eventually drafted an amendment that &quot;would clarify the intent of Congress that persons serving with the U.S. armed forces who are taken prisoner and held captive by certain hostile, foreign armed forces should receive the prisoner of war medal. This clarification is intended to cover the individuals taken prisoner as a result of the &quot;USS Pueblo&quot; seizure, as well as any similar occurrence that the Service Secretary concerned deems comparable to the circumstances under which persons have generally been held captive by enemy armed forces during a war or conflict.&quot; This amendment to the POW Medal statute appeared at 10 USC § 1128 (a)(4) prior to its repeal in 2013.

The exception clause added by the 1989 amendment was the only authority to award the POW Medal to persons held outside formal armed conflict, including non-state actors such as terrorist, since terrorists are not conventional enemy armed forces that would automatically qualify a captive for the award under the original statute adopted by the 99th Congress in 1985. Detainees and internees of neutral countries were also authorized the award provided that the service secretary determined that circumstances of their captivity were &quot;comparable to those under which persons have generally been held captive by enemy armed forces during periods of armed conflict.&quot; What exactly qualified as comparable circumstances of captivity and treatment was never defined in Title 10, although the 38 USC § 101 (32) Veterans Affairs POW Status statute that served as the source of the &#x27;comparability clause&#x27; for the 1989 amendment to Title 10 contains similar language requiring &quot;circumstances which the Secretary finds to have been comparable to the circumstances under which persons have generally been forcibly detained or interned by enemy governments during periods of war.&quot;

According to VA guidelines contained in 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (y): &quot;To be considered a former prisoner of war, a serviceperson must have been forcibly detained or interned under circumstances comparable to those under which persons generally have been forcibly detained or interned by enemy governments during periods of war. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, physical hardships or abuse, psychological hardships or abuse, malnutrition, and unsanitary conditions.&quot; Although these criteria do not formally apply to the military&#x27;s Title 10 POW statute, the legal rule of &quot;in pari materia&quot; allows the reference of the Title 38 guidelines for clarification purposes since both statutes were crafted to be complementary. Therefore, the military previously referenced VA determinations of POW status for veterans affairs purposes- including VA comparability criteria- in order to establish eligibility for the POW Medal.

====Awards under the 1989 amendment (no longer current law)====

=====Detainees=====
This category applied to servicemembers detained by a foreign government in the absence of a formal armed conflict. After the passage of Public Law 101–189, Secretary of the Navy H. Lawrence Garrett III authorized the POW Medal to the crew of the USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; on December 22, 1989, and the medal was awarded to the crew on May 5, 1990. Later in 1991, Secretary Garrett also awarded the POW Medal to a Naval Flight Officer, LT Robert O. &quot;Bobby&quot; Goodman, Jr., USN, whose A-6E &quot;Intruder&quot; attack jet was shot down by Syrian anti-aircraft gunners while conducting an airstrike against Syrian positions in Hammana, east of Beirut, on December 4, 1983.

His pilot having been killed during the shootdown, Goodman was captured by Syrian forces and imprisoned until January 5, 1984, when he was released. In a 1991 Navy Office of the Judge Advocate General (OTJAG) review of Goodman&#x27;s case, a Navy attorney stated that individuals held outside armed conflict, &quot;...may be entitled to POW medals as a result of the [1989] amendment if the Secretary determines that the circumstances under which they were held captive were &#x27;comparable to those under which persons have generally been held captive by enemy armed forces during periods of armed conflict.&#x27;&quot; In 1993 the Secretary of the Army awarded the POW Medal to CW3 Michael Durant, an Army MH-60 &quot;Blackhawk&quot; helicopter special operations pilot who was shot down in Mogadishu and held captive by warlord Mohamed Aidid. In 1996, retired USAF officers Colonel Freeman &quot;Bruce&quot; Olmstead and Colonel John McKone received the POW Medal from the Secretary of the Air Force for their captivity in Lubyanka prison in Moscow, Russia, between July 1960 and January 1961; the two were shot down by a Russian fighter plane while flying their RB-47 &quot;Stratojet&quot; on a patrol over the Barents Sea. According to the USAF deputy chief of staff for personnel, &quot;...a precedent has been set with the award of POW Medals to the crew of the USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; and to Chief Warrant Officer Michael Durant for his capture in Somalia.&quot; In 2000, U-2 pilot Gary Powers posthumously received the POW Medal from the USAF for his captivity in Russia.

The deputy general counsel for National Security and Military Affairs staffed the award for Powers, and explained that Powers qualified despite being held outside active armed conflict. According to the general counsel, &quot;The phrase that the Secretary must find the circumstances of captivity to be comparable to those under which persons have generally been held captive by enemy armed forces during periods of armed conflict does not mean that the event must &quot;occur&quot; during an armed conflict such as World Wars I &amp; II, the Korean War, Vietnam War, etc. It means that the &quot;circumstances&quot; must be &quot;comparable&quot;.&quot; In particular, the general counsel highlighted the importance of connecting the captivity to some kind of military or national-security objective, which would separate a case like Powers&#x27; from that of a person who &quot;carelessly wanders across the border of a country hostile to the U.S. and is seized by military border guards and imprisoned.&quot;

=====Internees=====
This category applied to any belligerent servicemembers interned by non-belligerent (or neutral) countries during a period of international armed conflict. According to the legislative history of the 1989 amendment to the POW Medal statute, internees were intended beneficiaries of the POW Medal so long as they were treated comparably to POWs during periods of armed conflict. However, only a few select groups of internees received the POW Medal under the 1989 amendment due to DoD and service policy that failed to incorporate the 1989 amendment, and differing interpretations of the ambiguous statutory language requiring captivity by &quot;foreign armed forces hostile to the U.S.&quot; as well as the requirement for &quot;comparable&quot; circumstances of treatment. From 1991 to 1993 the Air Force and the Navy Secretaries awarded the POW Medal to all U.S. aircrew members interned in neutral Russia during World War II, a total of 291 personnel. While staffing one of the Navy awards, the Assistant Vice Chief of Naval Operations, Rear Admiral Raymond M. Walsh, explained that an internee of the Soviet Union was previously denied the POW Medal under the older version of 10 USC § 1128 &quot;because he was not a prisoner of an enemy of the United States.&quot; However, he could now be considered for the medal because &quot;The 1989 change to the law permits the Secretary of the Navy to determine if the circumstances under which [an internee] was held captive were ‘comparable to those under which persons have generally been held captive by enemy armed forces during periods of armed conflict.’&quot;

While staffing the Air Force award, the Air Force Directorate of Personnel Services (AFPC/DPS) concluded that &quot;In 1989, Title 10, Section 1128, regarding Prisoner of War Medals changed and allowed Service secretaries to determine eligibility for the POW Medal for personnel held captive in countries not directly involved in armed conflict with the United States, provided the treatment of the prisoners was similar to the treatment received by prisoners held by enemy forces.&quot; AFPC/DPS determined that the internees in Siberia met the statutory criteria because &quot;the conditions of this detainment were comparable, if not worse, than those experienced in Germany, and therefore, should be eligible for the POW Medal.&quot; In 1996 and 2006 the USAF awarded POW Medals to USAAF T/Sgt Daniel Culler and Lt. Richard Pettit for illegal incarceration during World War II in prison camp Wauwilermoos, in neutral Switzerland. Both airmen were confined at Wauwilermoos as a punishment for escape attempts.

By November 1944, over 100 U.S. airmen were confined in Wauwilermoos, and were only released after the U.S. Legation in Switzerland presented a protest authorized by the acting U.S. Secretary of State, which accused the Swiss Army of violating provisions of the 1929 Geneva Convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war. The U.S. Minister in Bern, Leland Harrison, informed the Swiss Political Department Minister that he was &quot;surprised that [the Swiss] have a more severe attitude toward [escaping internees] than if they were prisoners of war.&quot; The rejection of the POW Medal to many internees mistreated in Switzerland led Congress to further modify the 1989 amendment in 2013, such that this language could no longer be used to block the award for internees or any other type of captive held outside active armed conflict.

=====Hostages of terrorists=====
This category applied to servicemembers held captive or hostage by non-state actors regardless of the existence of an active armed conflict. The first hostage award under the amended statute was possibly the case of Donald R. Blair, a sailor based in Okinawa in 1946 who was sent to Tsingtao, China, to train Nationalist Chinese forces. Blair was captured by communist forces, tortured, and was released after 44 days when he was exchanged for two communist officers. He later received the POW Medal from the Secretary of the Navy around 1991. According to the Marine Corps Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, Mr. Blair was &quot;a member of the US Navy [who] was interned from 3 December 1946 to 15 January 1947 by Chinese guerilla forces.&quot;

This case was then used as a precedent for several other hostage scenarios outside formal armed conflict. In 2001 Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig awarded the POW Medal to the thirteen USMC embassy guards held hostage in the U.S. Embassy in Iran during the Iran Hostage Crisis. According to the Navy&#x27;s Deputy Assistant Judge Advocate General for Administrative Law, the Marines held in Tehran were &quot;entitled to award of the medal if the Secretary determines that circumstances under which they were held captive were &#x27;comparable to those under which persons have generally been held captive by enemy armed forces during periods of armed conflict.&#x27;&quot; Similarly, in 2003 USAF Secretary James G. Roche authorized the POW Medal to all &quot;U.S. Air Force personnel taken hostage anytime during the period of 4 November 1979 to 22 January 1981, at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran.&quot; According to Roche, the USAF hostages qualified because &quot;[they] were held by a foreign armed force hostile to the United States and were under circumstances comparable to prisoners held by enemy forces during periods of armed conflict,&quot; a clear reference to the 1989 amendment. The qualification of the USAF hostages was reviewed by Richard Peterson of the Air Force Office of the Judge Advocate General.

Peterson referenced the legislative intent, noting that &quot;the military members held captive in Iran when the US Embassy was seized were mentioned by Senator Cranston when he introduced the Senate bill.&quot; He concluded that hostages of terrorists qualified for the medal because &quot;Americans captured there were clearly held captive (vice merely being under house arrest, for example),&quot; and &quot;the law does not require that the captors be members of the military of a recognized state, but only that they be organized as an armed force hostile to the US.&quot; In Peterson&#x27;s opinion, the Iranian captors were &quot;members of an armed force hostile to the US&quot; in spite of not being &quot;regularly constituted Iranian Army forces.&quot; Despite this legal endorsement and the AF Secretary approval, the USAF did not award the medal to any Iran hostages until November 2011.

The U.S. Army also staffed an awards package for most of their hostages in 2003, explaining that &quot;in view of the expanded criteria for award of the POW Medal [contained in the 1989 amendment], the Soldiers held in Iran are eligible for award of the medal.&quot; All Army soldiers were approved with the exception of Staff Sergeant Joseph Subic Jr., who was denied because &quot;his character of service was determined not to be consistent with POW Medal policy.&quot; However, as with the USAF, the Army did not award any of the medals even after they were approved and the soldiers were located. In 2006 and 2009 the Secretary of the Army retroactively awarded the medal to two of the former hostages, Donald Hohman and Regis Ragan, who were previously approved but had to appeal to the Army&#x27;s Board for Correction of Military Records to obtain the awards. In November 2011, the Army awarded the medal to most of the remaining Army hostages, including Colonel Charles Scott, Colonel Leland Holland, and Chief Warrant Officer Joseph Hall, with the explanation that &quot;due to administrative oversight and staff transition, there has been some delay in you receiving this award.&quot;

In 2003, the Secretary of the Navy awarded the POW Medal (posthumously) to USMC Colonel William R. Higgins, who was kidnapped in 1988 and executed by Hezbollah-affiliated terrorists. According to the head of the Marine Corps Awards Branch, &quot;The law governing the Prisoner of War (POW) Medal was amended in 1989. The late Colonel Higgins is eligible for the POW Medal based upon this change to [the] legislation.&quot; In a supporting recommendation, the office of the Marine Corps Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs stated that COL Higgins was &quot;kidnapped in 1988 by Islamic terrorists,&quot; and therefore met the criteria of captivity &quot;by foreign armed forces that are hostile to the United States.&quot; According to the Deputy Commandant&#x27;s recommendation, &quot;The posthumous awarding of the POW Medal to Colonel Higgins is consistent with law and precedent, and should be supported.&quot;

Several other hostages of terrorists also received the POW Medal after abduction by terrorists or insurgents during operations in Iraq subsequent to the collapse of the Hussein regime in 2003. Several of these U.S. Army hostages of terrorists who received the POW Medal include Private First Class Kristian Menchaca and Private First Class Thomas Lowell Tucker, who were abducted from a roadside checkpoint on June 16, 2006, and later executed by Al-Qaeda in Iraq. Several other U.S. Army soldiers received the POW Medal after the 20 January 2007 Karbala provincial headquarters raid including 1LT Jacob Fritz, SPC John Chism, and PFC Shawn Falter. These soldiers were also killed during captivity.

====Issues of policy and interpretation of 1989 amendment====

=====Armed conflict requirement=====
Interim DoD policy articulated in 1988 concluded that only military captives taken prisoner by enemy states during active armed conflict were eligible for the award. Specifically, DoD policy stated that &quot;the medal will be issued only to those taken prisoner by an enemy during armed conflict,&quot; and further states that &quot;hostages of terrorists and persons detained by governments with which the US is not actively engaged in armed conflict are not eligible for the medal.&quot; However, the 1989 amendment to the POW Medal Statute that created an exception to the armed conflict requirement was overlooked in the July 1990 version of the DoD Manual of Military Decorations and Awards, presumably because the 1989 amendment occurred in November, during the staffing window for the 1990 revision to the manual. Instead of incorporating the 1989 amendment, the 1990 manual incorrectly repeated the 1988 policy almost verbatim, such that it required that &quot;the POW Medal shall be issued only to those taken prisoner by an enemy during armed conflict,&quot; and &quot;hostages of terrorists and persons detained by governments with which the United States is not engaged actively in armed conflict are not eligible for the medal.&quot; No mention was made of the 1989 amendment at all. Change 1 of the 1990 DoD manual, issued in June 1991, also lacked any reference to the 1989 amendment.

The error in policy was finally discovered at the Office of the Secretary of Defense in March 1991, when a Navy OTJAG attorney conducted a legal review on two cases where Navy personnel were detained in China and Syria, both outside formal armed conflict. The attorney discovered that neither the DoD awards manual nor the Navy&#x27;s awards manual cited the 1989 amendment, and he called the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management and Personnel (ASD/FM&amp;P). The action officer at ASD/FM&amp;P reportedly &quot;acknowledged that the Service Secretaries do have this authority [to overrule the policy and invoke the 1989 amendment].&quot; The OTJAG attorney concluded his report by recommending that &quot;it may be advisable to examine the possibility of further defining qualifying criteria in the SECNAV Awards Manual in line with the statutory guidance for the purpose of simplifying future decisionmaking regarding the POW Medal,&quot; but this step was not taken. The June 1993 version of the DoD awards manual finally incorporated the 1989 amendment with the addition of the exception that &quot;the POW Medal shall be issued only to those taken prisoner by foreign armed forces that are hostile to the United States, under circumstances which the Secretary concerned finds to have been comparable to those under which persons have generally been held captive by enemy forces during periods of armed conflict.&quot; In addition, the requirement for active armed conflict was removed, and the prohibition for detainees and hostages held outside armed conflict was also removed. However, no language was added to explain what the new language meant or how to implement it, particularly that the law was modified to provide an exception to captivity in active armed conflict. The legal citation for the POW Medal also remained unchanged, and did not reference the 1989 amendment.

As a result, none of the services correctly incorporated the change in policy in their manuals. The Army did not change its medal policy until 2006, when it added the 1989 amendment but incorrectly retained the contradictory requirement that &quot;hostages of terrorists and persons detained by governments with which the United States is not engaged actively in armed conflict are not eligible for the medal.&quot; The Navy still retains the original requirements from the 1990 version of DoD policy, and thus has never removed the armed conflict requirement nor added any mention of the 1989 amendment. The Air Force awards publication defers to the DoD awards manual on the subject of the POW Medal. Other service-level legal reviews highlighted the problems still evident in service-level policy. The 2001 Navy OTJAG legal review for the USMC hostages held in Iran from 1979 to 1981 noted that the previous version of the DoD awards manual incorrectly &quot;limited issuance of the award to periods of active armed conflict.&quot;

The attorney noted that the POW Medal statute &quot;had recently expanded eligibility for the POW Medal to members held captive by foreign armed forces when the United States was not involved in armed conflict,&quot; and cited that &quot;the inconsistency no longer exists&quot; in the DoD manual. However, he noted that &quot;the Navy and Marine Corps Awards Manual, issued in 1991, has not been updated to reflect the change in the statute.&quot; Thus, the requirement for active armed conflict remained in the Army and Navy awards manuals. During a 2010 policy review, the Office of the Secretary of Defense erroneously added the armed conflict requirement back into the DoD awards manual. As a result, DoD policy from 2010 to 2013 incorrectly stated that &quot;hostages of terrorists and persons detained by governments with which the United States is not engaged actively in armed conflict are not eligible for the medal.&quot; This language directly contradicted the 1989 amendment.

=====Captivity by hostile foreign armed forces requirement=====
This requirement was never clearly defined in the law or the policy at any level, and for many years was completely omitted from service policy due to mistakes by responsible officials. The requirement for hostile forces was subjectively interpreted any number of ways. According to official DoD doctrine in a separate publication issued years after the creation of the POW Medal, a &quot;hostile act&quot; is defined as &quot;An attack or other use of force against the US, US forces, or other designated persons or property. It also includes force used directly to preclude or impede the mission and/or duties of US forces, including the recovery of US personnel or vital US Government property.&quot; A &quot;hostile force&quot; is defined as &quot;Any civilian, paramilitary, or military force or terrorist(s), with or without national designation, that have committed a hostile act, exhibited hostile intent, or have been declared hostile by appropriate US authority.&quot; &quot;Armed forces&quot; are defined as &quot;The military forces of a nation or a group of nations.&quot; Although the original Senate bill that produced the 1989 amendment intended to make the treatment of captives the operative qualifying condition for those held outside formal armed conflict, this intent was only sporadically enforced. The requirement for captivity by &quot;foreign armed forces that are hostile to the United States&quot; was sometimes interpreted to encompass a range of captors, stretching from neutral states, hostile individuals/terrorists, to countries in a &quot;de facto&quot; state of war with the United States.&quot;

The definition of a hostile force is necessarily distinct from an enemy force or opposing force (which require a formal declaration of war or joint resolution authorizing use of military force or some other evidence of a protracted conflict, respectively), since captives of enemy and opposing armed forces fall under the automatic qualification of the original 1985 statute that the amendment modified. Thus, the 1989 amendment applied only to those held outside armed conflict, which also meant that hostility was a designation that did not require armed conflict. The &quot;USS Pueblo&quot; crew&#x27;s detention in North Korea was mentioned explicitly in the conference report for the amendment, clearly indicating that North Korea qualified as a hostile foreign armed force. A conservative interpretation of the hostile force requirement sometimes resulted in denial of the medal for internees of neutral countries and hostages of terrorists, since in both cases ill-treatment during captivity is not necessarily condoned at the level of state policy. For example, Air Force attorneys argued in Board for Correction of Military Records cases that neutrality and hostility were mutually exclusive, despite the fact that incidents have occurred where captives of neutrals were severely mistreated by hostile individuals. This interpretation was at odds with international law, which only recognizes states that are belligerent and those that are not. Hostile forces distinct from enemy forces bear no mention and have no meaning under international law. Thus, hostile forces are merely a vague sub-category of non-belligerence. Furthermore, treaty law frequently commingles so-called &quot;non-belligerents&quot; and neutral states, making them indissociable. For example, the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War makes virtually no distinction between non-belligerents and neutrals, and imposes many of the same duties on both.

The International Committee of the Red Cross&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949&quot; similarly elaborates that &quot;other forms of non-participation in a conflict have been added to neutrality as defined by treaty and customary law,&quot; and that &quot;it would have sufficed to use the expression ‘not engaged in the conflict’ or ‘not Party to the conflict’&quot; in lieu of using the term ‘neutral.’ The &quot;Commentary&quot; explicitly states that the term ‘neutral’ &quot;should be interpreted as covering non-participation in conflicts in general, as well as neutrality in the proper sense of the word.&quot; Therefore, all non-belligerence is a form of neutrality, which means that neutrality includes the entire range of states not formally participating in international armed conflict such as de facto belligerents, non-participants who do not claim neutrality, temporary declared neutrals, and even long-standing neutrals. Thus, in this type of case, the legal question is not whether neutrality negates hostility, but rather whether an individual who detains Americans and mistreats them becomes hostile at a level below the entire state in question, and whether this alone qualifies as captivity by hostile foreign armed forces if the parent government (if one exists) is not necessarily hostile.

Hostages of terrorists were sometimes denied eligibility for lack of detention by a state, normally through the citation of the outdated armed conflict requirement in DoD policy, or by claiming that terrorists are not hostile foreign armed forces. For example, several military hostages held during the Iran Hostage Crisis were initially denied the award or incorrectly sent to the Board for Correction of Military Records, which is not appropriate if the captive is eligible or already qualified. The Army incorrectly sent the case of former hostage Sergeant Major Regis Ragan to the Board for Correction in 2009, even though he was already qualified as per a 2004 by-name approval from Army Secretary Brownlee. Another example is the case of LtCol William R. Higgins, who was kidnapped and killed by Hezbollah affiliates in 1988. DoD General Counsel Judith A. Miller initially blocked the award in 1998 based on the claim that &quot;circumstances do not appear to meet the criteria established by Congress for award of the Prisoner of War Medal,&quot; which may have been a reference to the fact that Higgins&#x27;s captors were not members of regularly constituted (state) armed forces.

However, it is likely that Miller did not understand the language of the amendment or know that the statute was amended in the first place, since neither the law nor the policy explained the ambiguous language that amended the statute in 1989, and the policy failed to note that the law was ever amended. The Navy disagreed with Miller, and in 2003 it overruled her determination and awarded the POW Medal to Higgins. Since the attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in 2001 the Office of the Secretary of Defense has promoted a broader definition of &quot;opposing armed force&quot; that now includes individual actors or terrorists. However, there is little room for this interpretation in the original statute that standardized the same conflict prerequisites for valor awards in 1963, which expanded several decorations to armed conflicts against an &quot;opposing foreign force&quot; or &quot;while serving with friendly forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.&quot; In this context, both of these opposing forces were interpreted to be states in a Cold-War conflict short of a formal war, not non-state actors.

The post-9-11 conflict in Afghanistan was somewhat different from prior actions against terrorists, in that Congress passed an authorization for use of military force. The September 18, 2001 authorization for use of military force specified that &quot;the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons.&quot; Technically, this resolution only applied to those who actually perpetrated or aided perpetrators of the September 11 attacks, meaning that not all terrorists or captors of U.S. soldiers are &quot;opposing foreign forces,&quot; and captivity not associated with the September 11 attacks should be adjudicated for POW Medal eligibility based on treatment rather than automatic qualification.

=====Comparable treatment requirement=====
Again, the statute and the policy do not define what constitutes comparable treatment. Ostensibly, the base of comparison are the general historical conditions of captivity for American prisoners who qualify automatically for the POW Medal through captivity by enemy or opposing armed forces. The origin of the &quot;comparability clause&quot; is the language dictating Veterans Affairs POW determinations in 38 USC § 101(32), which was created by Public Law 97-37 and later expanded in Public Law 100–322. Senator Alan Cranston, then chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, both expanded the VA eligibility law in 1988 and authored a companion bill to expand the POW Medal statute. This bill, S.487, was eventually incorporated into the FY1990 National Defense Authorization Act, and became part of the 1989 amendment to the POW Medal statute. Thus, there is a link between the language and intent of both statutes. The legal rule of &quot;pari materia&quot; allows the reference of companion statutes to provide context.

Accordingly, the VA regulations cite that comparable circumstances &quot;include, but are not limited to, physical hardships or abuse, psychological hardships or abuse, malnutrition, and unsanitary conditions.&quot; A military secretary is not bound by these qualifiers for comparable treatment, but the framework is a useful reference in the absence of explicit DoD guidance on comparable circumstances. There is precedent for the use of VA rules in military POW determinations. In the case of US Navy internees held by the Soviet Union during WWII, the Navy&#x27;s Office of the Judge Advocate General cited that &quot;the Veteran&#x27;s Administration has determined that [redacted internee] will qualify for benefits afforded POWs. Although we are not bound by VA rulings in this case I believe that the Prisoner of War Medal should be awarded to [redacted internee] and the other 45 people listed.&quot; The attorney referenced a VA POW approval that stated &quot;a decision has been made that [an internee&#x27;s] detention by Russian forces was under circumstances comparable to those under which persons generally have been forcibly detained or interned by enemy governments during wartime. He is therefore considered a former prisoner of war and entitled to the same benefits as if he had been held by enemy forces.&quot;

===2013 amendment to clarify non-conflict captivity awards===
====Background and intent of 2013 amendment====
The ambiguity of the 1989 amendment as well as the various policy mistakes spawned an effort to clarify the language in 10 USC 1128(a)(4) allowing the medal for some captives held outside armed conflict. In 2010, multiple rejections of USAAF internees mistreated in Switzerland during World War II led the House Committee on Armed Services to direct the Secretary of Defense to &quot;review the rationale for awarding the prisoner-of-war medal to some Wauwilermoos internees and not to others,&quot; and &quot;to award the prisoner-of-war medal to those Wauwilermoos internees, who upon review, the Secretary determines to be entitled to the award.&quot; In response, the Department of Defense again denied the awards under the justification that &quot;Switzerland was a neutral country and Switzerland&#x27;s armed forces were not hostile to the United States.&quot;

The department determined that the statute&#x27;s requirement for &quot;foreign armed forces that are hostile to the United States&quot; did not encompass members of the Swiss military because of Swiss neutrality, irrespective of the personal hostility of the Swiss service members who mistreated the U.S. airmen held at Wauwilermoos prison. In response, the House Committee on Armed Services authored an amendment contained in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act that proposed amending 10 USC 1128(a)(4) by striking &quot;that are hostile to the United States.&quot; In conference, the Senate revised the amendment to state: &quot;Under uniform regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary concerned may issue a prisoner-of-war medal to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the armed forces, was held captive under circumstances not covered by paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (a), but which the Secretary concerned finds were comparable to those circumstances under which persons have generally been held captive by enemy armed forces during periods of armed conflict.&quot; The conference managers explained that &quot;there may be circumstances when an individual serving with the armed forces is held captive by other than an enemy armed force, by other than a hostile nation, or during times other than periods of armed conflict in conditions comparable to those in which the POW medal is now required. For this reason, the conferees recommend amendment of current law to give the service secretaries the authority to issue an award in appropriate cases where the conditions of captivity are comparable to those in which a POW is held by enemy armed forces.&quot;

Thus, the amendment has a similar legislative intent to the 1989 amendment, excepting that the language of the 1989 amendment was more ambiguous and was never fully implemented in policy. The 2013 amendment became Public Law 112–239 on January 2, 2013, with the signature of the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act.
The new DoD policy for the amendment, published on May 31, 2013, repeated the language of the amendment and specified that &quot;[a]ward of the [POW Medal] under the comparable conditions provision is the exception and not the rule. Authority to award the [POW Medal] under this provision may not be delegated below the Secretary concerned.&quot; Additionally, the policy specified that the conflicts to be used for comparison purposes are World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam Conflict.

====Precedents under 2013 amendment====
As a result of the new policy, 143 of the Wauwilermoos airmen were authorized the medal in an October 15, 2013 decision by acting USAF Secretary Eric Fanning. Eight of the living airmen received the medal from USAF Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh in a ceremony at the Pentagon on April 30, 2014.

In 2014, six Navy divers from Underwater Construction Team One were awarded the POW Medal by USN Secretary Ray Mabus. The divers were held captive in Beirut, Lebanon in 1985 after their commercial aircraft (TWA flight 847) was hijacked by Hezbollah militants. One of the divers, Robert D. Stethem, was killed on the tarmac at Beirut International Airport.

In 2022, the Army also awarded POW Medals to two former specialists, Ronald Dolecki, and David Strickland, who were both abducted at different times while serving in Ethiopia in the 1960s and 1970s. Both men were abducted by insurgent members of the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF), which was fighting for Eritrean independence at the time. Dolecki had been unlawfully denied the medal between 2004 and 2020, under the rationale that the ELF “was not considered an opposing armed force hostile to the United States,” which was apparently a confusion over the 1989 amendment&#x27;s hostility provision that had not existed for many years in law or policy. Indeed, the ELF was clearly hostile to the United States, and this was no longer required as of the revision to the Army&#x27;s Awards Manual after the 2013 amendment. The House Committee on Armed Services reported in reaction that &quot;The Department of the Army specifically has interpreted the statutory requirements in such a narrow way as to block seemingly obvious cases of eligibility,&quot; and directed DoD to brief the committee on the matter. The Senate Committee on Armed Services also reported on the matter, reflecting that &quot;the Department of the Army has implemented regulatory hurdles that are difficult for servicemembers and next-of-kin to clear,&quot; and expressed that the 2013 amendment was intended to &quot;broaden eligibility for the prisoner-of-war medal to those who, for reasons of law and not fact, were not eligible for the medal because they were not in a conflict or taken prisoner and held captive by a party whose legal status met the criteria . . . of the aforementioned statute.&quot;

===Link to Purple Heart Medal===
Due to a provision in the FY1996 National Defense Authorization Act, service secretaries are required to award the Purple Heart to any POW Medal recipients wounded in captivity. The law specified that &quot;[a] person shall be considered to be a former prisoner of war for purposes of this section if the person is eligible for the prisoner-of-war medal under section 1128 of title 10, United States Code.&quot; The corresponding DoD regulation specifies that any &quot;Service member who is killed or dies while in captivity&quot; after April 5, 1917, can receive the medal, &quot;unless compelling evidence is presented that shows that the member’s death was not the result of enemy action.&quot;

===Penalties for misrepresentation===
Prior to October 2011, federal law provided that any false verbal, written or physical claim to the Prisoner of War Medal, by an individual to whom it has not been awarded, shall be fined or/and imprisoned not more than six months. In October 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Stolen Valor Act for violating the First Amendment. This effectively invalidated all legislation that criminalized false oral claims to U.S. decorations. In response, Congress passed H.R. 258, the Stolen Valor Act of 2013, which was more limited in scope and only criminalized false claims to the Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross, Air Force Cross, Silver Star, Purple Heart, or combat badge &quot;with intent to obtain money, property, or other tangible benefit.&quot; Since the Prisoner of War Medal was not included, false claims to this medal are no longer criminal under this statute.

<doc id="347797" wikidata="Q752064" url="?curid=347797" title="Crinan Canal">
<text>The Crinan Canal is a navigable canal in Argyll and Bute, west of Scotland. It opened in 1801 and connects the village of Ardrishaig on Loch Gilp with Crinan on the Sound of Jura, providing a navigable route between the Firth of Clyde and the Inner Hebrides, without the need for a long diversion around the Kintyre Peninsula, and in particular the exposed Mull of Kintyre.

Today the canal is operated by Scottish Canals and is a popular route for leisure craft, used by nearly 2,000 boats annually. The towpath is part of National Cycle Route 78.

The canal is a two-part scheduled monument. Loch a&#x27; Bharain, which serves as a feeder reservoir for the canal, is also a scheduled monument.

==History==

The canal was built to provide a shortcut for commercial sailing and fishing vessels and later Clyde puffers to travel between the industrialised region around Glasgow to the West Highland villages and islands. Authorised by the (33 Geo. 3. c. 104), it was designed by civil engineer John Rennie and work started in 1794, but was not completed until 1801, two years later than planned. The canal&#x27;s construction was beset with problems including finance and poor weather. Landowners demanded high prices for their land and navvies were reluctant to leave jobs in more accessible parts of England and Scotland. The construction cost £127,000 ().

On Saturday 8 August 1801, the &quot;Carlisle Journal&quot; reported that: 
On Monday, a boat laden with fish, arrived at the Broomielaw, Glasgow, from one of the Western Isles, being the first vessel that has passed through the Crinan Canal

The canal bank near Lochgilphead failed in 1805 and the canal&#x27;s course was diverted to avoid the marshy ground. The canal&#x27;s reservoirs were finished in 1809 but two years later a storm caused one to burst releasing its water and sending boulders and mud along the canal in both directions wrecking locks, the canal banks and the nearby roads. Repairs cost £8,000 ().

The canal company, headed by the Duke of Argyll, had to seek help from the government, who asked Thomas Telford to assess the problems. He suggested improvements to the locks, and some parts of the canal were redesigned including the swing bridges which were replaced in cast iron in 1816. The government paid for the work but the canal company lost control and it was handed to the Caledonian Canal Commissioners.
Queen Victoria travelled along the canal to Crinan during a holiday in the Scottish Highlands in 1847. She was greeted at Ardrishaig and her boat was towed by four horses, two of which were ridden by postilions in royal livery. At Crinan she boarded the royal yacht &quot;Victoria and Albert&quot;. Her journey made the canal a tourist attraction and gave the canal an added purpose. Passenger steamer companies operating out of Glasgow advertised the canal as the &quot;Royal route&quot; and by the late 1850s more than 40,000 passengers passed through Ardrishaig each year and were met by steamers to Oban at Crinan. 

A disaster occurred on 2 February 1859 when the Camloch reservoir supplying the canal burst, and the ensuing torrent of water and rock damaged the banks of the canal and seven of the gates forming the locks which were swept into the valley below. The canal was closed for through navigation until 1 May 1860 although the wider repairs to paths and road had not been completed. Although Parliament had authorised £12,000 () for repairs the company reported that the expenditure had exceeded the budget by around £3,500 () as the damage included large boulders of rock which were found in the bed of the canal.

In 1866 a steam-powered passenger boat &quot;Linnet&quot; replaced horse-drawn boats for tourists. &quot;Linnet&quot; remained in service until 1929.

Between 1930 and 1932, new sea locks were built at either end, making the canal accessible at any state of tide. The swing bridge at Ardrishaig was installed at this time. The canal became the responsibility of British Waterways in 1962. It closed for nine-week period in October 1987 to allow some refurbishment. On 2 July 2012 the British Waterways functions in Scotland became Scottish Canals.

==Features==

The Crinan Canal has 15 locks and is crossed by seven bridges: six swing bridges and a retractable bridge. Stone for the 15 locks was brought from Mull, the Isle of Arran and Morvern. From Ardrishaig, three locks raise the canal&#x27;s east reach to above sea level. The summit reach, between Cairnbaan and Dunardry, is above sea level. The west reach between Dunardry and Crinan is above sea level. The canal is deep, although the declared maximum draught for a vessel is , and has essentially no height limit, but there are signs quoting 30m maximum due to the recent power lines that cross the canal.

The retractable bridge at Lock 11 replaced the original swing bridge in 1900. It is operated by a rotating handle and a cogged wheel which causes the bridge deck to roll forwards and backwards on rails and comes to rest across the lock chamber. It is no longer is use. The canal has towpaths on both sides from Ardrishaig to Crinan Bridge (no longer) and horses assisted unpowered craft until 1959.

<doc id="347803" wikidata="Q2076208" url="?curid=347803" title="1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election">
<text>The 1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election took place on Thursday, 25 June 1998. This was the first election to the new devolved Northern Ireland Assembly. Six members from each of Northern Ireland&#x27;s eighteen Westminster Parliamentary constituencies were elected by single transferable vote, giving a total of 108 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs).

==Background and campaign==

The election was the culmination of the years long Peace Process that had resulted in the Good Friday Agreement on 10th of April 1998. The Agreement had been the result of multi-party talks in Northern Ireland, as well as talks with the British and Irish governments. The Agreement would need to be endorsed by referendums in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland that were scheduled for the 22nd of May.

Of the parties who&#x27;d won election in 1996 to the Northern Ireland Forum only the DUP and UK Unionist Party opposed the Agreement, encouraging a No vote in the referendum. Whilst the UUP officially supported the Agreement, there was significant dissent within its ranks. Several high profile members, including six of their ten MPs, opposed the Agreement. On 18th of April the ruling council of the UUP backed the Agreement with 540 delegates in favour and 120 against.

On 24 April the loyalist paramilitary organisation, the Ulster Defence Association announced that it was in support of the Agreement. However on the 1st of May the Orange Order came out in opposition.

At the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis on the 10th of May the party voted to end its 77 year policy of abstentionism from NI government institutions. However, it would continue to refuse to take any seats won at Westminster elections.

Two major issues during both the referendum and subsequent Assembly campaign was that of decommissioning and release of paramilitary prisoners. This was cemented when the IRA released a statement saying that it would not agree to decommissioning its weapons. A poll released on the 15th of May showed that a majority of those planning on voting No were going to do so due to the release of prisoners. On the same day the Ulster Volunteer Force announced a ceasefire in opposition to the Agreement, encouraging a No vote in the referendum.

On the 19th of May, just three days before the referendum was to be held, U2 held a concert at Belfast&#x27;s Waterfront Hall in support of the Yes campaign. John Hume, the SDLP leader, and David Trimble, the UUP leader, attended and appeared on stage. Bono held their hands aloft in an image that became iconic of the campaign. The concert was the first time the two men had campaigned together and is credited with giving the Yes campaign a crucial boost in the final days of the campaign.

In the end the Agreement was endorsed by the people of Northern Ireland with 71.1% voting in favour on a turnout of 81.1%.

Compared to the referendum campaign, the Assembly campaign was much more subdued. However, the issue of decommissioning continued to be a major issue. Following a meeting with the Northern Ireland Secretary, Mo Mowlam, Vice President of Sinn Fein, Martin McGuinness, warned against &quot;falling into the trap of trying to make decommissioning the most important item on the agenda&quot;.

On the 4th of June a Northern Ireland Office memo on the upcoming Independent Commission on Policing was leaked, resulting in controversy as it contained none of the people nominated by the Irish government on the behalf of nationalists.

==Results==

The SDLP topped the polls, receiving about 22 percent of the votes. It won a plurality of the first preference votes. This was the first time a nationalist party had ever achieved this in Northern Ireland&#x27;s history. It was a feat that would not be repeated until the 2022 Assembly elections when Sinn Féin also topped the poll. 

Despite the use of STV, a form of proportional representation, the UUP won four more seats than the SDLP. This has been attributed to several reasons, including:

* Slightly different turnouts across the province, with the result that in the more staunchly unionist east fewer votes were required to elect an MLA than in the SDLP&#x27;s heartlands in the west.
* The Ulster Unionists proved better at &quot;vote balancing&quot; whereby in the rounds of transfers their candidates were less likely to be eliminated earlier on.
* The Ulster Unionists proved better at attracting transfers from other parties (and due to the vote balancing mentioned above, were more likely to be in a position to benefit from this).

Despite a nationalist party topping the poll with a plurality of votes, unionist parties won a majority of both seats and votes. Of the 108 seats available, 58 designated as unionist, 42 as nationalist and 8 as other. In terms of first preference votes unionist candidates won 50.6% of the vote, compared to nationalists 39.8% and others 8.9% of the vote.

=== Within unionism ===
Whilst the UUP retained its position as the largest party of unionism, its vote share of just 21.25% was the lowest it had ever achieved. The DUP managed to finish just 3.24% behind the UUP, which was considered a significant success. Of the smaller unionist parties the UK Unionist Party managed to win five seats, and the Progressive Unionist Party two seats. This was an improvement for the UKU compared to the 1996 Northern Ireland Forum election, whilst the PUP retained its two seats. The Ulster Democratic Party however failed to win any seats in the Assembly and the party dissolved before the 2003 Assembly election. In addition to the four unionist parties elected, three independent unionists were also elected to the assembly.

=== Within nationalism ===
The election was considered a success for the SDLP, which not only secured the largest vote share, but also increased its number of seats compared to the 1996 Forum elections. Sinn Féin also had a successful election by increasing its share of both votes and seats. Unlike unionism, where the vote was split between several different parties, the nationalist vote was split between just two and there were no significant independent nationalist campaigns.

=== Other parties ===
The Alliance Party had a disappointing night with their vote share remaining unchanged and the net loss of one seat. The election continued the pattern of the Alliance Party winning seats only in heavily unionist areas. The NI Women&#x27;s Coalition had a successful night, winning two seats. This would be the only Assembly election in which the party would win any seats.

<text>The 2008 Summer Paralympic Games (), the 13th Summer Paralympic Games, took place in Beijing, China, from September 6 to 17, 2008. As with the 2008 Summer Olympics, equestrian events were held in Hong Kong and sailing events in Qingdao. It was first time the new Paralympic logo featured in the Summer Paralympics since its rebranding after the 2004 Summer Paralympics.

3,951 athletes from 146 countries took part, the largest number of nations ever (ten more than the 2004 Games in Athens). Five countries competed for the first time. As host country, China fielded more athletes than any other country. The slogan for the 2008 Paralympics was the same as the 2008 Summer Olympics, &quot;One World, One Dream&quot; ( Pinyin &quot;Tóng yīge shìjìe tóng yīge mèngxiǎng&quot;, lit. &quot;One World, One Dream&quot;). China dominated the medal count, finishing with 89 gold medals and 211 total medals, more than double the next-ranked NPC in both cases. 339 Paralympic records and 279 world records were broken. International Paralympic Committee (IPC) President Philip Craven declared the Games &quot;the greatest Paralympic Games ever.&quot;

Beijing was selected to host the 2022 Winter Paralympics, making it the first city to host both Summer and Winter Games.

==Symbols==
===Emblem===
The Games&#x27;s emblem, &quot;Sky, Earth, and Human Beings&quot; (), was unveiled in July 2004, a multicolored Chinese character &quot;之&quot; () stylized as an athletic figure in motion. Its red, blue and green colors represent sun, sky and earth.

===Slogan===
The slogan was the same as the 2008 Summer Olympics, &quot;One World, One Dream&quot;.

===Mascots===
The mascot was a cartoon cow named Fu Niu Lele (), roughly meaning &quot;Lucky Ox &#x27;Happy&#x27;&quot;.

===Theme song===
The theme song was &quot;Flying with the Dream&quot; . It was performed by Chinese-Tibetan singer Han Hong and Hong Kong singer and actor Andy Lau.

==Torch relay==

The torch relay of the 2008 Summer Paralympics started from Tian Tan (Temple of Heaven) on August 28. The flame then gathered before &quot;The Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests&quot; (祈年殿) and followed two routes (the &quot;Route of Ancient China&quot; and the &quot;Route of Modern China&quot;). Both routes returned to Beijing on September 5, and the torch was flamed at the National Stadium during the Opening Ceremony on September 6.

==The Games==
===Opening ceremony===

The opening ceremony took place on September 6, 2008. The pre-ceremony performance was a succession of various musical performances, ranging from military music to folk music and a performance of &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;. Following a countdown, a fireworks display signalled the beginning of the ceremony proper. The national flag of China was then raised, in accordance with usual protocol, and the national anthem of China performed. Performers wearing suits in bright colours paraded round the stadium, as a welcoming ceremony preceding the athletes&#x27; entry. As with the 2008 Summer Olympics, the ceremony included a parade of nations, with a flag bearer for each national team. Contrary to Olympic tradition, the national team of Greece did not enter first, as the Paralympic Games traces its roots to Stoke Mandeville rather than Olympia; the host country, as is customary in both Olympic and Paralympic Games, came last. As Chinese is written in characters and not letters, the order of the teams&#x27; entry was determined by the number of strokes in the first character of their respective countries&#x27; Simplified Chinese names. Countries with the same number of strokes in the first character are sorted by those of the next character. This made Guinea (几内亚) the first country to enter as it takes two strokes to write the first character in the country&#x27;s name (几). Following the athletes&#x27; parade, a performance took place, divided into chapters and sub-chapters entitled the &quot;Journey of Space&quot; and &quot;Journey of Life&quot;. The sunbird performance entailed Yang Haitao (杨海涛), a singer with a visual impairment, singing about dreams while an acrobat in sunbird costume descended in simulated flight from the air and &quot;awakened the blind singer from his sleep&quot;. The ceremony concludes with Hou Bin, the first Chinese paralympian to be three-time champion consecutively in the same event, lifted himself and his wheelchair up on a rope by strength of arms to the top of Beijing National Stadium, where he lit the cauldron to mark the beginning of the Games.

===Closing ceremony===

The 2008 Summer Paralympics closing ceremony was held at the Beijing National Stadium. It began at 8:00 pm China Standard Time (UTC+8) on September 17, 2008.

===Calendar===
===Participating NPCs===
The following National Paralympic Committees sent delegations to compete. Macau and the Faroe Islands are members of the International Paralympic Committee, but not of the International Olympic Committee; hence they participate in the Paralympic Games but not in the Olympics.

Burundi, Gabon, Georgia, Haiti and Montenegro participated in the Paralympics for the first time.

Botswana was due to take part, but its single athlete, defending Paralympic champion sprinter Tshotlego Morama, withdrew prior to the Games due to injury. The country&#x27;s last-minute attempt to field other athletes in her place was rejected, as they did not meet the requirement of having participated in international events.

==Medal count ==
This table is based on the medal count of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).

The ranking is sorted primarily by the number of gold medals earned by a National Paralympic Committee. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IPC Country Code.

France Télévisions replied that it would take Juvin to court for slander.

<doc id="347822" wikidata="Q333179" url="?curid=347822" title="Persuasion (novel)">
<text>Persuasion is the last novel completed by the English author Jane Austen. It was published on 20 December 1817, along with &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, six months after her death, although the title page is dated 1818.

The story concerns Anne Elliot, an Englishwoman of 27 years, whose family moves to lower their expenses and reduce their debt by renting their home to an admiral and his wife. The wife&#x27;s brother, Captain Frederick Wentworth, was engaged to Anne in 1806, but the engagement was broken when Anne was persuaded by her friends and family to end their relationship. Anne and Captain Wentworth, both single and unattached, meet again after a separation lasting almost eight years, setting the scene for a second, well-considered chance at love and marriage for Anne.

The novel was well received in the early 19th century, but its greater fame came later in the century and continued into the 20th and 21st centuries. Much scholarly debate on Austen&#x27;s work has since been published. Anne Elliot is noteworthy among Austen&#x27;s heroines for her relative maturity. As &quot;Persuasion&quot; was Austen&#x27;s last completed work, it is accepted as her most maturely written novel, showing a refinement of literary conception indicative of a woman approaching 40 years of age. Her use of free indirect speech in narrative was in full evidence by 1816.

&quot;Persuasion&quot; has been the subject of several adaptations, including four made-for-television adaptations, theatre productions, radio broadcasts, and other literary works.

==Plot==
The story begins seven years after the broken engagement of Anne Elliot to Frederick Wentworth: having just turned nineteen years old, Anne fell in love and had accepted a proposal of marriage from Wentworth, then a young and as yet undistinguished naval officer. Wentworth was considered clever, confident and ambitious, but his low social status and lack of wealth made Anne&#x27;s friends; her vain father, Sir Walter Elliot; and her older sister Elizabeth view him as an unsuitable match for the daughter of a baronet. Lady Russell, a distant relative whom Anne considers to be a second mother to her after her own had died, also saw the relationship as imprudent for one so young and persuaded Anne to break off the engagement. Sir Walter, Elizabeth, and Lady Russell are the only family members who knew about the short engagement, as Anne&#x27;s younger sister, Mary, was away at school.
Several years later, the Elliot family are in financial trouble on account of Sir Walter&#x27;s lavish spending; this had been kept in check while Lady Elliot was alive, but since then Sir Walter and Elizabeth have spent without thought. At last, forced into action, they are persuaded to rent out Kellynch Hall, the family estate, and settle in Bath until their finances improve. Sir Walter, Elizabeth, and Elizabeth&#x27;s new companion, Mrs Clay, look forward to the move. Anne, on the other hand, doubts she will enjoy Bath, but cannot go against her family. Mary is now married to Charles Musgrove of Uppercross Hall, the heir to a respected local squire. Anne visits Mary and her family, where she is well-loved. As the Napoleonic Wars are over, Admiral Croft and his wife Sophia (Frederick&#x27;s sister) become the new tenants of Kellynch Hall. Captain Wentworth, now wealthy from prize ships he captured in the war, visits his sister and meets the Uppercross family, where he crosses paths with Anne.

The Musgroves, including Mary, Charles, and Charles&#x27;s sisters Henrietta and Louisa, welcome the Crofts and Captain Wentworth, who makes it clear that he is ready to marry. Both the Crofts and the Musgroves enjoy speculating about which sister Captain Wentworth might marry. The Musgroves&#x27; cousin, the young clergyman Charles Hayter, who is absent when Wentworth is introduced to their social circle, returns and is rather upset over Henrietta&#x27;s apparent interest in Wentworth after Hayter&#x27;s wooing of her. However, when Charles Hayter stops visiting so often, Henrietta realises where her true affections lie, and now it seems that a match between Louisa and Wentworth will soon follow. Anne still loves Wentworth, so each meeting with him requires preparation for her own strong emotions. She overhears a conversation in which Louisa tells Wentworth that before marrying Mary, Charles Musgrove first proposed to Anne, who turned him down. This news startles Wentworth, and Anne realises that he has not yet forgiven her for letting herself be persuaded to end their engagement years ago.

Anne and the young adults of the Uppercross family accompany Captain Wentworth on a visit to see two of his fellow officers, Captains Harville and Benwick, in the coastal town of Lyme Regis. Captain Benwick is in mourning over the death of his fiancée, Captain Harville&#x27;s sister Fanny, and he appreciates Anne&#x27;s sympathy and understanding, helped by their mutual admiration for the Romantic poets. At Lyme, Anne attracts the attention of a young man they later learn is William Elliot, her cousin and a wealthy widower who is heir to Kellynch Hall; he broke ties with his family years earlier, and was reported to have spoken of Sir Walter and Elizabeth in very disrespectful terms. On the last morning of the visit, Louisa sustains a serious concussion after willfully insisting on jumping from the Cobb seawall a second time, expecting to be caught again by Wentworth; he first tries to dissuade her from such a big jump but she is determined and jumps a fraction of a second before Wentworth is ready. Anne organises others to summon assistance. Wentworth is impressed with Anne&#x27;s quick thinking and cool-headedness, but feels guilty about his actions concerning Louisa; he now sees that his encouraging her to never allow anyone to persuade her to anything was a serious error, resulting in her serious injury. This causes him to re-examine his feelings for Anne. Louisa, due to her delicate condition, is forced to recover at the Harvilles&#x27; home in Lyme for months. Captain Benwick, who was a guest as well, helps in Louisa&#x27;s recovery by attending and reading to her.

Following Louisa&#x27;s accident, Anne joins her father and sister in Bath, with Lady Russell also in the city. Captain Wentworth visits his older brother Edward in Shropshire. Anne finds that her father and sister are flattered by the attentions of their cousin William Elliot, thinking that if he marries Elizabeth, the family fortunes will be restored. William flatters Anne and offhandedly mentions that he was &quot;fascinated&quot; with the name of his future wife already being an &quot;Elliot&quot; who would rightfully take over for her late mother, but teasingly refuses to tell her who had talked fondly of her to him in the past. Although Anne wants to like William, the attention and his refined manners, she finds his character opaque and difficult to judge.

Admiral Croft and his wife arrive in Bath with the news that Louisa is engaged to Captain Benwick. Wentworth travels to Bath, where his jealousy is piqued by seeing William courting Anne. Anne visits Mrs Smith, an old school friend, who is now a widow living in Bath under straitened circumstances, and in the early days of recovery from serious illness. From her, Anne discovers that she was the person who spoke fondly of her to her former friend, William Elliott. She reveals that beneath William&#x27;s charming veneer is a cold, calculating opportunist who led Mrs Smith&#x27;s late husband into debt. He had frequently obtained money from the good-natured but easily manipulated Mr Smith before William&#x27;s marriage to a very wealthy woman, who has since died. However, when Mr Smith became ill, William made no attempt to aid his friend. Named as the executor to Mr Smith&#x27;s will before the Smiths learned that William was no true friend, William has done nothing to help Mrs Smith. She needs someone to act for her in regards to a property of her husband&#x27;s, which she is too ill to deal with herself, and too poor to employ someone to do it for her. She asked William to act for her, but he made it clear he had no intention of doing anything. Although Mrs Smith believes that William is genuinely attracted to Anne, she feels that his initial aim was to prevent Mrs Clay from marrying Sir Walter — rumours abound in Bath that this is Mrs Clay&#x27;s aim, along with astonishment that Elizabeth does not realise this — as a new marriage might mean a son for Sir Walter, displacing William as heir to Kellynch Hall. The discovery that the young lady he had admired in Lyme is his cousin Anne is a wonderful bonus for William.

The Musgroves visit Bath to purchase wedding clothes for Louisa and Henrietta, both soon to marry. Captains Wentworth and Harville encounter them and Anne at the Musgroves&#x27; hotel in Bath, where Wentworth overhears Anne and Harville discussing the relative faithfulness of men and women in love. Deeply moved by what Anne says about women not giving up their feelings of love even when all hope is lost, Wentworth writes her a note declaring his feelings for her. Outside the hotel, Anne and Wentworth reconcile, reaffirm their love for each other, and renew their engagement. Lady Russell admits she was wrong about Wentworth and endorses the engagement. William leaves Bath; Mrs Clay soon follows him and becomes his mistress, making it more likely that he will inherit Kellynch Hall as the danger of her marrying Sir Walter has passed. Once Anne and Wentworth have married, Wentworth helps Mrs Smith recover her remaining assets. Anne settles into her new life as the wife of a Navy captain.

==Main characters==

Anne Elliot – The second daughter of Sir Walter Elliot. Anne is intelligent, accomplished and attractive, and is unmarried at 27, having broken off seven years earlier her engagement to Frederick Wentworth, then a naval commander. Anne fell in love with Wentworth but was persuaded by her late mother&#x27;s friend, Lady Russell, to reject his proposal because of his uncertain prospects and lack of money, and Anne&#x27;s youth. Anne rejects Charles Musgrove&#x27;s proposal a few years later, knowing she still loves Wentworth, but it is only when Wentworth returns from fighting abroad that she finally confronts her unfulfilled feelings for him.

Captain Frederick Wentworth – A naval officer, about 31 years old, who proposed to Anne some seven years earlier. At the time, he had no fortune and uncertain prospects, but owing to his achievements in the Napoleonic Wars, he advanced in rank and in fortunes. He is one of Sophia Croft&#x27;s two brothers. He gained his step to post Captain, and gained wealth amounting to about £25,000 from prize money awarded for capturing enemy vessels. He is an eminently eligible bachelor, eager to settle down with a good woman.

Sir Walter Elliot, Bt. – A vain and self-satisfied baronet. Sir Walter is a man whose extravagance since the death of his prudent wife thirteen years before has put his family into dire financial straits, forcing him to lease his estate, Kellynch Hall, to Admiral Croft and rent a more economical residence in Bath. Despite being strongly impressed by wealth and status, he allows Mrs Clay, who is beneath him in social standing, to join his household as a companion to his eldest daughter.

Elizabeth Elliot – The eldest and most beautiful of Sir Walter&#x27;s three daughters, who appears to be his favourite. Elizabeth encourages her father&#x27;s imprudent spending and extravagance and like her father, she has a tendency to be narcissistic, while she herself desires marriage after spending most of her life managing the family home in her mother&#x27;s place. She and her father regard Anne as inconsequential, wanting to ensure only that she marries a man who can enhance the Elliot family&#x27;s social standing.

Mary Musgrove – The youngest daughter of Sir Walter, married to Charles Musgrove. Mary is attention-seeking, always looking for ways she might have been slighted, and often claims illness when she is upset. She is just as obsessed with social standing and wealth as the rest of her family, and opposes sister-in-law Henrietta&#x27;s interest in marrying a cousin, Charles Hayter, whom Mary feels is unworthy of being married to a woman of means.

Charles Musgrove Jr. – Son of Charles Musgrove Sr. Husband of Mary and heir to the Musgrove estate. He first proposes to Anne, who refuses as she does not love him. He marries Mary about five years before the story opens, and they have two sons. He is a cheerful man, who loves hunting and endures his wife&#x27;s faults.

Lady Russell – An intimate friend of the late Lady Elliot and the godmother of Anne, of whom she is particularly fond. She is instrumental in Sir Walter&#x27;s decision to leave Kellynch Hall and avoid financial ruin. She values social rank and finds in Anne the Elliot daughter most like her late friend, which led her to persuade the young Anne not to marry Wentworth seven years earlier on account of his lack of wealth.

Penelope Clay – A poor widow with children, daughter of Sir Walter&#x27;s lawyer, and companion of Elizabeth Elliot. She aims to flatter Sir Walter into marriage while her oblivious friend looks on. Later, she abandons the family to become the unmarried mistress of William Elliot.

Admiral Croft – A good-natured, plainspoken tenant at Kellynch Hall and brother-in-law of Captain Wentworth. In his naval career, he was a captain when he married, present at the major Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, then assigned to the East Indies, and now holds the rank of rear admiral of the white.

Sophia Croft – Sister of Captain Wentworth and wife of Admiral Croft for the last fifteen years. She is 38 years old. She offers Anne an example of a strong-minded woman who has married for love instead of money and who has a good life as a naval wife.

Louisa Musgrove – Second sister of Charles Musgrove, aged about 19. Louisa is a high-spirited young woman who has returned with her sister from school. She likes Captain Wentworth and seeks his attention. She is ultimately engaged to Captain Benwick after recovering from her serious fall in Lyme Regis. Her brother Charles notices that she is less lively after suffering the concussion.

Henrietta Musgrove – Eldest sister of Charles Musgrove. Henrietta, aged about 20, is informally engaged to her cousin, Charles Hayter, but is tempted by the more dashing Captain Wentworth. Once Hayter returns home, she again connects with him.

Captain Harville – A friend of Captain Wentworth. Wounded two years previously, he is slightly lame. Wentworth has not seen his friend since the time of that injury, and is eager to reconnect. Harville and his family are settled in nearby Lyme for the winter. His wife tends to Louisa, and the children come to stay with the Musgroves for the Christmas holiday.

Captain James Benwick – A friend of Captains Harville and Wentworth. Benwick was engaged to marry Captain Harville&#x27;s sister Fanny, but she died while Benwick was at sea. He gained prize money as a lieutenant and was promoted to commander (thus earning the right to be called Captain). Benwick&#x27;s enjoyment of reading gives him a connection with Anne as does her willingness to listen to him in his time of deep sadness. Benwick was with Louisa Musgrove during her recovery, at the end of which they become engaged to marry.

William Elliot – A distant relation (&quot;great grandson of the second Sir Walter&quot; when it is not stated from which later holder of the baronetcy Sir Walter descends in order to be the current holder of the title) and the heir presumptive of Sir Walter. It is later revealed that, beneath his charming veneer, Mr Elliot is a cold, calculating opportunist. He became estranged from the family when he married a woman of lower social rank for her fortune and actively insulted his uncle; his relatives cast him aside, until he returned as a wealthy man when they desperately needed money. Despite rumours that he is interested in Elizabeth, he instead turns his attentions towards Anne. He is a widower, eager to claim the social value of the title that he will someday inherit. He also has an interest in Mrs Clay, Elizabeth&#x27;s companion, and she later becomes his mistress, although this turns out largely to be an attempt by William to stop his uncle from remarrying and potentially producing a son who would inherit Kellynch instead of William.

Mrs Smith – A friend of Anne Elliot who lives in Bath. Mrs Smith is a widow who suffers ill health and financial difficulties. She keeps abreast of the doings of Bath society through news she gets from her nurse, Rooke, who tends the wife of a friend of William Elliot&#x27;s. Her financial problems could have been straightened out with assistance from William Elliot, her husband&#x27;s friend and executor of his will, but Elliot&#x27;s greed led him to hide most of her remaining fortune with the expectation that he would eventually be able to take it for himself. Wentworth eventually acts on her behalf when William departs Bath, allowing Mrs Smith to claim her money.

Lady Dalrymple – A viscountess, cousin to Sir Walter. She occupies an exalted position in society by virtue of wealth and rank. Sir Walter and Elizabeth are eager to be seen at Bath in the company of this great relation and her daughter, Miss Carteret, at a time when their own social status is in question.

Miss Carteret – Daughter of Lady Dalrymple, who is always in tow behind the viscountess. Considered by Anne and others to be undeserving and very ordinary in intelligence and social graces. Elizabeth, who is more socially motivated, tolerates her company.

==Themes==
Readers of &quot;Persuasion&quot; might conclude that Austen intended &quot;persuasion&quot; to be the unifying theme of the story, as the idea of persuasion runs through the book, with vignettes within the story as variations on that theme. British literary scholar Gillian Beer establishes that Austen had profound concerns about the levels and applications of &quot;persuasion&quot; employed in society, especially as it related to the pressures and choices facing the young women of her day. Beer asserts that persuasion was indeed &quot;fraught with moral dangers&quot; for Austen and her contemporary readers; she notes particularly that Austen personally was appalled by what she came to regard as her own misguided advice to her beloved niece Fanny Knight on the very question of whether Fanny ought to accept a particular suitor, even though it would have meant a protracted engagement. Beer writes: 

Fanny ultimately rejected her suitor and married someone else after her aunt&#x27;s death.

Thus, Beer explains, Austen was keenly aware that the human quality of persuasion—to persuade or to be persuaded, rightly or wrongly—is fundamental to the process of human communication, and that, in her novel &quot;Jane Austen gradually draws out the implications of discriminating &#x27;just&#x27; and &#x27;unjust&#x27; persuasion.&quot; Indeed, the narrative winds through a number of situations in which people influence or attempt to influence other people, or themselves. Finally, Beer calls attention to &quot;the novel&#x27;s entire brooding on the power pressures, the seductions, and also the new pathways opened by persuasion.&quot;

==Development of the novel==
Canadian scholar Sheila Johnson Kindred states that parts of &quot;Persuasion&quot; were inspired by the career of Austen&#x27;s brother Charles Austen, a Royal Navy officer, as there are some similarities between the career of the real-life Captain Austen and the fictional Captain Wentworth: both began their careers in command of sloops in the North America station at about the same age; both were popular with their crews; both progressed to the command of frigates; both were keen to share their prize money with their crews, though Captain Wentworth ended up considerably richer as a result of his prize money than did Captain Austen.

Likewise, Captain Austen&#x27;s wife Fanny, whom he married in Bermuda in 1807, bears some similarities to Mrs Croft, who, like Fanny Austen, lived aboard naval vessels for a time; lived alternatively in Bermuda and Halifax (the two ports that hosted the Royal Navy&#x27;s North America station); crossed the Atlantic five times, though Mrs Croft was middle-aged in the novel while Fanny Austen was 15 when she married Captain Austen.

Jane Austen liked Fanny Austen, whom she admired for her &quot;unfussiness and gallant good sense.&quot; Even after the outbreak of the War of 1812, Fanny Austen was anxious to follow her husband back to the North America station despite the danger of American attacks on Bermuda and Halifax. Jane Austen was impressed with her devotion according to Kindred, seeing Fanny&#x27;s desire to be with her husband no matter the danger as an attractive trait. Likewise, in &quot;Persuasion,&quot; Mrs Croft follows her husband everywhere despite the dangers.

Author Andrew Norman has argued that Barrington Court was the inspiration for &#x27;Kellynch Hall.&#x27;

==Publication history==
In a letter to her niece Fanny Knight in March 1817, Austen wrote that she had a novel &quot;which may appear about a twelvemonth hence.&quot; John Murray published &quot;Persuasion&quot; together with &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; in a four-volume set, printed in December 1817 but dated 1818. The first advertisement appeared on 17 December 1817. The Austen family retained copyright of the 1,750 copies, which sold rapidly. The later editions of both were published separately.

The book&#x27;s title is not Jane Austen&#x27;s but her brother Henry&#x27;s, who named it after her early death. There is no known source that documents what Austen intended to call her novel. Whatever her intentions might have been, Austen spoke of the novel as &quot;The Elliots,&quot; according to family tradition, and some critics believe that is probably the title she planned for it.

Henry Austen supplied a &quot;Biographical Notice&quot; of his sister in which her identity was revealed; she was no longer an anonymous author.

==Early drafts and revisions==
Unlike &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; and &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, &quot;Persuasion&quot; was not rewritten from earlier drafts of novels that Austen had originally started before 1800.

American literary historian A Walton Litz has emphasized the special quality of &quot;Persuasion&quot; among Austen&#x27;s novels, as it was written over a relatively narrow space of two or three years from start to finish. Almost all of Austen&#x27;s novels were written in the form of first drafts (now lost) from before 1800, over a decade before their first publication in the last years of Austen&#x27;s life. Since &quot;Persuasion&quot; was written over such a narrow time frame, Litz was able to locate and publish Austen&#x27;s early handwritten drafts as she refined the text of the novel into its final published form. &quot;Persuasion&quot; is unique among Austen&#x27;s novels in allowing such a close inspection, as recorded by Litz, of her editorial prowess in revising and enhancing early drafts of her own writing. Litz, citing the research of Norman Page, gives an example of Austen&#x27;s meticulous editing by excerpting a passage of Austen&#x27;s cancelled Chapter Ten of the novel and comparing it to the revised version. In its original version, the manuscript stated:
[Wentworth] found that he was considered by his friend Harville an engaged man. The Harvilles entertained not a doubt of a mutual attachment between him and Louisa; and though this to a degree was contradicted instantly, it yet made him feel that perhaps by &quot;her&quot; family, by everybody, by &quot;herself&quot; even, the same idea might be held, and that he was not &quot;free&quot; in honour, though if such were to be the conclusion, too free alas! in heart. He had never thought justly on this subject before, and he had not sufficiently considered that his excessive intimacy at Uppercross must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that while trying whether he could attach himself to either of the girls, he might be exciting unpleasant reports if not raising unrequited regard./ He found too late that he had entangled himself, (cancelled version, as published in Chapman&#x27;s edition of Austen).

Litz then gives the final version by Austen:
&quot;I found&quot;, said he, &quot;that I was considered by Harville an engaged man! That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment. I was startled and shocked. To a degree, I could contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same—her own family, nay, perhaps herself, I was no longer at my own disposal. I was hers in honour if she wished it. I had been unguarded. I had not thought seriously on this subject before. I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls, at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other ill effects. I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences&quot;./ He found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself (final version).

To this may be added the surviving version of Austen&#x27;s handwritten copy of the original draft before the editing process outlined above had even started where Austen wrote it in the following nascent form:
He found that he was considered by his friend Harville, as an engaged Man. The Harvilles entertained not a doubt of a mutual attachment between him &amp; Louisa—and though this to &quot;a degree&quot; was contradicted instantly—it yet made him feel that perhaps by &quot;her&quot; family, be everyone, by &quot;herself&quot; even, the same idea might be held—and that he was not &quot;free&quot; alas! in Heart.—He had never thought justly on this subject before—he had not sufficiently considered that this excessive Intimacy at Uppercross must have it&#x27;s (sic?) danger of ill consequence in many ways, and that while trying whether he c-d (sic) attach himself to either of the Girls, he might be exciting unpleasant reports, if not, raising unrequited regard!—He found, too late, that he had entangled himself—.&quot;

==Literary significance and criticism==
In his essay &quot;&quot;Persuasion&quot;: forms of estrangement&quot;, A Walton Litz summarises the issues critics have raised with &quot;Persuasion&quot; as a novel:&quot;Persuasion&quot; has received highly intelligent criticism in recent years, after a long period of comparative neglect, and the lines of investigation have followed Virginia Woolf&#x27;s suggestive comments. Critics have been concerned with the &quot;personal&quot; quality of the novel and the problems it poses for biographical interpretation; with the obvious unevenness in narrative structure; with the &quot;poetic&quot; use of landscape, and the hovering influence of Romantic poetry; with the pervasive presence of Anne Elliot&#x27;s consciousness; with new effects in style and syntax; with the &quot;modernity&quot; of Anne Elliot, an isolated personality in a rapidly changing society.In her 1980 book on Austen, Susan Morgan challenges Litz on calling &quot;Persuasion&quot; a novel showing Austen&#x27;s assimilation of the new romantic poetry. Morgan notes Litz&#x27;s comment on &quot;the deeply physical impact of &quot;Persuasion&quot;; he remarks that &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; is about the loss and return of principles, &quot;Emma&quot; about the loss and return of reason, &quot;Persuasion&quot; about the loss and return of &#x27;bloom&#x27;.&quot; According to Morgan, Litz &quot;acknowledges the crudeness of these formulations, and we recognize that he is attempting to discuss a quality of the novel that is hard to describe. But such summaries, even tentatively offered, only distort. The few brief nature scenes in &quot;Persuasion&quot; (and they are brief, out of all proportion to the commentary on them), the walk to Winthrop and the environs of Pinny and Lyme, are certainly described with sensibility and appreciation. And in Anne&#x27;s mind they are just as certainly bound up with &#x27;the sweets of poetical despondence&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;Persuasion&quot; is the first of Austen&#x27;s novels to feature as the central character a woman who, by the standards of the time, is past the first bloom of youth. British literary critic Robert P Irvine writes that &quot;Persuasion&quot; &quot;is in many ways a radical departure&quot; from Austen&#x27;s earlier novels. Austen biographer Claire Tomalin characterizes the book as Austen&#x27;s &quot;present to herself, to Miss Sharp, to Cassandra, to Martha Lloyd...to all women who had lost their chance in life and would never enjoy a second spring.&quot;

A recurring debate in 18th-century Britain concerned the power of books over women: were women more susceptible to the power of reading than men, and if so, was reading a benign or malign influence on them? Austen first addressed this question in &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, in which reading Gothic books has comic effects for Catherine Morland, and also gives her a more acute sense of reality and people. The American scholar Adela Pinch writes that Austen returns to this theme in &quot;Persuasion&quot; but in a more mature and probing manner, as &quot;Persuasion&quot; is concerned with &quot;what it feels like to be a reader. It does so by connecting this feeling to what the presence of other people feel like. It explores, that is, the influence reading can have on one&#x27;s mind by comparing it to the influence of one person&#x27;s mind over another&#x27;s.&quot;

Pinch writes that &quot;Persuasion&quot; has been called the most lyrical of Austen&#x27;s novels; &quot;Its emphasis on memory and subjectivity has been called Wordsworthian, its emotional tone has been likened to Shelley and Keats, and its epistemological strategies compared to Coleridge&#x27;s conversation poems. Its modernity has been hinted through allusions to the lyric fiction of Virginia Woolf.&quot;

Pinch also writes that Austen is more concerned with spatial matters as various families, especially the Musgroves, are portrayed in terms of the amount of space they take up and noise they generate. For example, Captain Wentworth and Elliot are prevented from embracing by grossly obese Mrs Musgrove, and Sir Walter comments after seeing some Royal Navy sailors that they are &quot;fit not to be seen&quot;; Austen notes how people look and the brain registers visual information. Pinch describes &quot;Persuasion&quot; as a novel of &quot;repetitions, of things happening within a strong context of memory.&quot; Anne is often lost in her own world of thought, and throughout the book the phrase &quot;Anne found herself&quot; recurs. During her walk at Winthrop on a November day, Anne ruminates on various aspects of her life and the books she has read, and Austen seems to suggest that reading is insufficient consolation for a woman&#x27;s pain, but also unavoidable if one wishes for her comfort.

The literary scholar Stuart Tave, in his essay on Anne Elliot, notes the melancholy qualities of her reality after she turns down Captain Wentworth&#x27;s original proposal of marriage. For Tave, Austen portrays Anne as a character with many admirable traits, usually exceeding the characters who surround her in these traits. Tave singles out Austen&#x27;s portrayal of Anne at the end of the novel in her conversation with Captain Harville, when they discuss the relative virtues of gender and their advantages compared to one another; Tave sees Anne as displaying remarkable intelligence. Tave quotes from Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot;: &quot;It was strange to think that all the great women of fiction were, until Jane Austen&#x27;s day, not only seen by the other sex, but seen only in relation to the other sex.&quot; Tave applies Woolf&#x27;s insight to &quot;Persuasion&quot;, writing: &quot;All histories are against you, Captain Harville says to Anne in their disagreement about man&#x27;s nature and woman&#x27;s nature, &#x27;all stories, prose and verse.&#x27; He could bring fifty quotations in a moment to his side of the argument, from books, songs, proverbs. But they were all written by men. &#x27;Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story,&#x27; as Anne says. &quot;Persuasion&quot; is the story told by a woman.&quot;

In her book on Austen, the critic Julia Prewitt Brown finds significance in comparing &quot;Persuasion&quot; to &quot;Emma&quot; with regard to Austen&#x27;s ability to vary her narrative technique. Brown writes: 
The coolness to the reader (conveyed by Austen&#x27;s narrative) contrasts with an intensity of feeling for the characters in the story, particularly for the heroine. The reason for this contradiction is that Anne Elliot is the central intelligence of the novel. Sir Walter is seen as Anne sees him, with resigned contempt. For the first time Jane Austen gives over the narrator&#x27;s authority to a character almost completely, In &quot;Emma&quot;, many events and situations are seen from Emma&#x27;s point of view, but the central intelligence lies somewhere between the narrator and the reader, who together see that Emma sees wrongly. In &quot;Persuasion&quot;, Anne Elliot&#x27;s feelings and evaluations correspond to those of the narrator in almost every situation, although there are several significant lapses...It seems that this transfer of authority placed a strain on Jane Austen&#x27;s accustomed narrative tendencies and that she could not maintain it completely.

Robert Irvine writes that, unlike other Austen heroes, who are either part of the gentry, the aristocracy or the Church of England, Wentworth is a self-made man who has become rich via prize money allowed to those who served in the Royal Navy. Sir Walter disparages naval officers like Wentworth and Croft because they &quot;spoil&quot; their complexions outside on the sea and have risen &quot;too quickly&quot; in social status. But Sir Walter is portrayed as financially incompetent, having squandered his inherited wealth, whereas Wentworth uses his prize money wisely. Sir Walter&#x27;s dismissal of the navy men who played such a prominent role in defeating Napoleon is considered unpatriotic and ungrateful. According to the scholar Gary Kelly, Sir Walter is a stand-in for the notoriously spendthrift and snobbish Prince Regent George—of whom Austen deeply disapproved—who was infamous for his womanizing, gambling, drinking, and inability to pay his colossal debts. At the time, there was a widespread belief that Britain defeated France despite the Prince Regent rather than because of him, and Kelly states that a character like Sir Walter—who did nothing to defeat Napoleon—attacking someone like Wentworth was Austen&#x27;s way of expressing her frustration at the Prince Regent taking credit for defeating Napoleon.

Anne and Wentworth, once married, do not become part of the land-owning gentry; Austen writes that the two were destined for &quot;settled life.&quot; According to Irvine, the sailors in &quot;Persuasion&quot; are the &quot;most subversive characters&quot; in all of Austen&#x27;s books, as they possess &quot;national importance&quot; only by the virtue of their role in defeating Napoleon and do not own land or ask for social recognition from the gentry. The Royal Navy in &quot;Persuasion&quot; is a meritocracy where one rises up via one&#x27;s talents, not via birth and land, which makes &quot;Persuasion&quot; the most radical of all of Austen&#x27;s novels, according to Irvine.

Irvine notes that the gentry characters in &quot;Persuasion&quot; are an &quot;unimpressive lot.&quot; Sir Walter is portrayed as a vain, pompous, and incapable of providing love for his children, while the Musgroves lack class and elegance. John Wiltshire writes that Sir Walter obsessively reads books relating only to the baronetage, and the Musgroves are relentlessly philistine in their tastes. Admiral and Mrs Croft do not plan to buy an estate, being content to rent Kellynch Hall, and are described as taking better care of the estate than Sir Walter, whose family has owned Kellynch Hall for three generations. Wiltshire considers that the Musgroves&#x27; and Sir Walter&#x27;s narrowness of vision and taste highlight the heightened state of Anne&#x27;s consciousnesses.

Charles Musgrove, though friendly and respectable, is portrayed as unsuitable for Anne as his only interests are guns, hunting, dogs and horses. Irvine notes that in British fiction at the time, it was a normal plot device for women—who were portrayed as more sensitive and poetical than men—to improve someone like Charles by showing him that there is more to life than hunting, but Anne rejects this role, and the narrator suggests that she was right to do so. The marriage of Anne&#x27;s parents is presented as such a match, with Anne&#x27;s mother attempting to &quot;improve&quot; Sir Walter, and her life becoming thoroughly miserable as a result. But the possibility of such a marriage seems to exist for Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove, as the narrator notes, &quot;he would gain cheerfulness and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott and Lord Byron.&quot; According to Irvine, Benwick and Anne are similar characters, who have a profound sense of loss. Anne&#x27;s heart still belongs to Wentworth, but Benwick is described as &quot;younger in feelings, if not in fact; younger as a man. He will rally again, and be happy with another&quot;.

Irvine writes of the differences between the Elliot sisters and Austen&#x27;s other sibling relationships. In contrast to the Dashwood sisters (&quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;) and the Bennet sisters (&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;), Anne is not close to her sisters.

Lady Russell persuades Anne to reject Wentworth&#x27;s first offer of marriage. Lady Russell never expresses any guilt about breaking up Anne&#x27;s relationship with Wentworth: &quot;her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt.&quot; in reference to Lady Russell&#x27;s reflection that Wentworth, who had once seemed to appreciate Anne&#x27;s superior qualities, now appeared to be attracted to Louisa Musgrove, who, although pleasant, is vastly inferior to Anne in character.

John Wiltshire notes that Wentworth is a man of action as opposed to words, which makes Anne the novel&#x27;s only self-reflective character. Anne becomes steadily more assertive, telling Mr Elliot at one point, &quot;My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever, well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is what I call good company.&quot; 

Irvine writes that, unlike in Austen&#x27;s other novels, a &quot;non-event&quot; at the beginning of &quot;Persuasion&quot;—Anne does not marry Wentworth—shapes the rest of the plot, as the hero and heroine defeat the consequences of their shared history. Irvine also says that &quot;Persuasion&#x27;s&quot; plot depends upon the main characters remaining the same, and the need for the characters to remain true to themselves, to cherish the memory of the ones they love, is emphasized by the signs of social decay around Anne; the gentry characters neglect their estates and treat the values they are supposed to uphold. Anne&#x27;s love for Wentworth is the only fixed point in an otherwise fluid world.

For Irvine, &quot;Persuasion&quot;&#x27;s key moments come when a third party overhears somebody else&#x27;s conversation, whereas conversation is a means for members of the elite to confirm their membership of a common group in Austen&#x27;s other novels. Louisa Musgrove discusses Admiral Croft&#x27;s carriage driving with Wentworth, which leads her to say, &quot;If I loved a man, as she loves the Admiral, I would be always with him, nothing should ever separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely by anybody else.&quot; According to Irvine, overhearing this conversation brings back Anne&#x27;s memories of her love for Wentworth and brings her sorrow as she fears that he is falling in love with Louisa. Another overheard conversation occurs during the novel&#x27;s climax, when Anne debates with Captain Harville the respective capacity for faithfulness of men and women, which Wentworth overhears. Not realising that Wentworth is listening, Anne says, &quot;All the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one, you need not covet it) is that of loving longest, when existence or when hope is gone.&quot; The narrator notes that, after saying this, &quot;She [Anne] could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart was too full, her breath too much oppressed.&quot; As Wentworth fears a second rejection by Anne, John Wiltshire, known for his work on psychoanalysis and literature, feels that much of the novel is concerned with incidents that bring the two together and relies upon relating Anne&#x27;s psychological state as she comes close to the man who once proposed marriage to her, making it more of a psychological study.

In the introduction to the Penguin Classics edition, &quot;Persuasion&quot; is called a great Cinderella story. It features a heroine who is generally unappreciated and to some degree exploited by those around her; a handsome prince who appears on the scene but seems more interested in the &quot;more obvious&quot; charms of others; a moment of realisation; and a happy ending. It has been said that it is not that Anne is unloved, but rather that those around her no longer see her clearly: she is such a fixed part of their lives that her likes and dislikes, wishes and dreams, are no longer considered, even by those who claim to value her, like Lady Russell.

<text>Magical Project S, known in Japan as , is a 26-episode anime television series produced by AIC and Pioneer LDC, airing in Japan from October 1996 to March 1997. It is based on the Pretty Sammy character and the OVA series. The series was released in the United States on VHS in 1999 and on DVD in 2002, only in a subtitled format. All instances of the word &quot;sexy&quot; were changed into &quot;lovely&quot; in some episodes.

==Characters==
===Main===
: 
: Based on Sasami Masaki Jurai, Sasami is an ordinary schoolgirl who is given the power to transform into a magical girl, Pretty Sammy. She was also given Ryo-Ohki as her advisor. She uses a magical girl baton.
: 
: Misao Amano is Sasami&#x27;s best friend. A kind, soft-spoken, and rather shy girl with dark purple hair, she tends to take a passive role, quietly following and watching the more energetic Sasami. She is transformed into Pixy Misa, a boisterous magical girl villain with blonde hair who wields a paper fan and summons (monsters of the week) to foil Pretty Sammy&#x27;s day. She speaks in &quot;weird English&quot;
: 
: Ryo-Ohki, the cabbit, serves as Sasami&#x27;s advisor. In contrast to the counterpart at &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot;, Ryo-Ohki is male, can speak, and can also transform into a boy.
: 
: Based on her &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; counterpart, Tsunami is a candidate to be the queen of Juraihelm. After she was chosen, she chose Sasami to act as her representative on Earth. In contrast to her &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; character, she is not connected or related to Sasami, and she is far more carefree, relaxed, and air-headed.
: 
: Passed over by the council of Juraihelm to be the candidate for Queen, Ramia attempts to undermine Tsunami&#x27;s bid by having her brother Rumiya transform someone on Earth to be a magical girl villain. She has long red hair.
: 
: Ramia&#x27;s little brother. He can transform into a bird that uses hypnosis to transform Misao into magical girl Pixy Misa.

===&quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; characters===
&quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; characters that were recast for the TV series include:
* , Sasami&#x27;s homeroom teacher, based on Mihoshi Kuramitsu
* , a teacher at Sasami&#x27;s school, based on Kiyone Makibi
* , an American child genius who graduated from MIT, and comes to Sasami&#x27;s school as a science teacher, based on Washu Hakubi
* , a bodyguard to Tsunami, based on Ryoko Hakubi
* , a third candidate for Queen of Juraihelm, based on Ayeka Masaki Jurai

Other &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; characters have cameos including:
* Tenchi Masaki as a high school kid that Sasami admires
* Genjuro Hagakure, based on Katsuhito Masaki
* Binpachi Hagakure, based on Yosho
* Shinobi Hagakure, based on Achika Masaki
* Nobuyuki Onjigoku, based on Nobuyuki Masaki

===Supporting characters===
: 
: Ginji is Sasami&#x27;s father in the TV series and seemingly a man of endless talents and abilities. He&#x27;s an affable man in general, and his love for his wife and daughter is unmatched. Ginji drives Sasami around to places on his motorcycle, even to school. He makes many suave remarks, telling Sasami &quot;good night&quot; in the morning just because he likes the sound of it. Misao finds him a fun person to be around and is a little envious of Sasami getting to be so close with her family.
: Ginji often ends up getting involved with helping Pretty Sammy from time to time. Though Ginji has no magical powers, his skills and even his charm often prove useful in many tough situations. In the past, he seems to have been a member of the SWAT team and even has NASA certification for operating a rocket. Sometimes his talents are helpful in combination with Washu&#x27;s scientific genius, and the two greet each other with &quot;Catherine&quot; and &quot;Johnny&quot; respectively. He also has &quot;Dandy Power&quot;, which he used in his fight against the Team Sexy Mrs.
: 
: Honoka is Sasami&#x27;s mother in the TV series and like Ginji has a cheerful and overly-nice personality. Her job is running the CD Vision store which is connected to Sasami&#x27;s houses. However, Honoka sometimes neglects her job to go play video games, which causes CD sales to plummet. At one point, Sasami&#x27;s parents expect Pretty Sammy to come by and help the store by putting on a show, which made Sasami very nervous.
: 
: Haida is a mean girl in Sasami&#x27;s class. She has a crush on Hiroto, constantly doting over him and trying to get his affection in a variety of ways. Hiroto just seems to be annoyed with her, although it is implied that they do start a relationship in the last episode. Konoha also has a dislike of Misao and sometimes says hurtful things to her. In the first episode, she says her goal in life is to conquer the world with her cousin (who clearly resembles Katsuhiko Jinnai from El-Hazard).
: In one episode when Sasami loses her baton, Konoha comes across it and is able to transform into the magical girl, . The magical baton asks Connie to fight for justice, but she ends up being a failure at it. Instead, Connie ignores all the problems around her and uses it selfishly to get Hiroto to love her. She ends up being extremely disappointed when she finds that the magic can cause Hiroto to love her as Connie but not as Konoha and gives up the baton. Funky Connie&#x27;s only other appearances are in an episode of the Bonus Theatre where she battles with Love-Me Eimy and a short appearance in the Pretty Sammy Movie trailer.
:In five different episodes Konoha is shown with two other mean girls, although they are never named and only speak briefly in one episode.
: 
: Eimi is a girl who is class rep in Sasami&#x27;s class. She seems to know the school rules by heart and tries to make sure everyone abides by them. Even in the oddest of situations, and outside of school, she chides people that they are going against &quot;school rules&quot;. In the first episode she admits to having dreams of becoming an actress but her voice is shrill, and her singing is later shown to be downright terrible. The class has to keep her quiet when they sing a song together or otherwise she single-handedly ruins it, such as during the School Festival, they first had to tie and gag Eimi during the rehearsal, and then cover Eimi&#x27;s mouth during the performance.
: When Romio arrives on the scene to help Ramia after Pixy Misa&#x27;s defeat, she takes control of Eimi and causes her to transform into her own champion magical girl, . The monsters she calls are named Lovely Monsters, and she also chides people for breaking school rules like her normal counterpart. She tends to make up rules at her convenience, though, and when she sings her songs (as terrible as her usual self) they are also filled with strange contradictory lyrics. She is nonetheless very powerful and Sammy has to get some help from Oryo (disguised as Cool Red) in order to beat her. Eimi turns to normal again but is unable to transform out of her costume, stuck as a magical girl for the remainder of the series.
: 
: Hiroto is an athletic boy in Sasami&#x27;s class. Along with his friend Kenji, he is one of the first civilians to see Pretty Sammy in action, and they spread the word around school about the big news about the magical girl. Konoha is infatuated with him, but Hiroto does not care for her, although in the last episode it is implied that they do start a relationship. When she is Connie, Konoha mentions that she had fallen for him when he chased away a bear with his soccer ball in 2nd grade, something that Hiroto doesn&#x27;t remember happening, though this may only be because he does not remember saving &quot;Connie&quot;, and only Konoha. He also does not seem to remember who Konoha is while under Connie&#x27;s spell.
: Much to Konoha&#x27;s dismay, Hiroto has a slight crush on Misao. He provided some help for Misao at academic endeavors, such as getting her ready to jump over the vaulting horse when she was afraid and also covered for her during the dodge ball battle between Mihoshi and Kiyone&#x27;s classes. Hiroto is quick to notice Misao&#x27;s change in confidence later in the series. When it is revealed to him that Misao is really Pixy Misa, he is shocked and also a bit frustrated over not being able to help. Konoha chides him over the fact he got so worked up over a girl who might not like him back.
: 
: Kenji is another boy in Sasami&#x27;s class and a friend of Hiroto. He has squinty eyes and tends to be a comic relief character throughout the series, inserting some kind of joke into the situation. Kenji has an obsession with photographs and often likes to take pictures, particularly of girls in skirts and swimsuits.
: 
: Shigeki is Misao&#x27;s father. In the TV series he is shown as a pianist that is traveling the world. Shigeki later came back to visit his family and Misao was happy to be able to see her dad. However when Rumiya had Misao forcibly transform into Pixy Misa for the final time, Shigeki found out that the area that Pixy Misa&#x27;s giant rose which was causing people to go berserk is where his wife and daughter are. Worried for their safety, Shigeki ran into the city and covered his face to avoid breathing in the rose&#x27;s pollen. When Misao saw him and Kotoe looking for her, it caused her powers as Pixy Misa to weaken and the transformation immediately canceled out. However, Shigeki had to leave before Misao had a chance to see him. But he was able to complete an uncompleted composition that he left for Misao, which also happened to be named Misao.
: However, when Misao was going to be performing the song on a piano for her class&#x27;s performance in the School Festival, Sasami wanted Shigeki to attend so he could watch Misao perform. As Pretty Sammy, she asked Washu for help and Washu used her connections to locate Shigeki. Sasami tried to master Pretty Teleport to teleport to him. When that didn&#x27;t work, Sasami was able to teleport a letter instead. After being able to see her father after the festival, Misao told him that she wanted to be a pianist just like him.
: 
: Kotoe is Misao&#x27;s mother and Shigeki&#x27;s estranged wife. After Shigeki abandoned his family, Kotoe was left in charge of taking care of Misao. Although she seems to be a very busy business woman that is hardly around, she does deeply care about her daughter and works hard to support her.

<doc id="347832" wikidata="Q110952894" url="?curid=347832" title="Fifth Generation Computer Systems">
<text>The Fifth Generation Computer Systems (FGCS; ) was a 10-year initiative launched in 1982 by Japan&#x27;s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to develop computers based on massively parallel computing and logic programming. The project aimed to create an &quot;epoch-making computer&quot; with supercomputer-like performance and to establish a platform for future advancements in artificial intelligence. Although FGCS was ahead of its time, its ambitious goals ultimately led to commercial failure. However, on a theoretical level, the project significantly contributed to the development of concurrent logic programming.

The term &quot;fifth generation&quot; was chosen to emphasize the system&#x27;s advanced nature. In the history of computing hardware, there had been four prior &quot;generations&quot; of computers: the first generation utilized vacuum tubes; the second, transistors and diodes; the third, integrated circuits; and the fourth, microprocessors. While earlier generations focused on increasing the number of logic elements within a single CPU, it was widely believed at the time that the fifth generation would achieve enhanced performance through the use of massive numbers of CPUs.

== Background ==

In the late 1960s until the early 1970s, there was much talk about &quot;generations&quot; of computer hardware, then usually organized into three generations.

# First generation: Thermionic vacuum tubes. Mid-1940s. IBM pioneered the arrangement of vacuum tubes in pluggable modules. The IBM 650 was a first-generation computer.
# Second generation: Transistors. 1956. The era of miniaturization begins. Transistors are much smaller than vacuum tubes, draw less power, and generate less heat. Discrete transistors are soldered to circuit boards, with interconnections accomplished by stencil-screened conductive patterns on the reverse side. The IBM 7090 was a second-generation computer.
# Third generation: Integrated circuits (silicon chips containing multiple transistors). 1964. A pioneering example is the ACPX module used in the IBM 360/91, which, by stacking layers of silicon over a ceramic substrate, accommodated over 20 transistors per chip; the chips could be packed together onto a circuit board to achieve unprecedented logic densities. The IBM 360/91 was a hybrid second and third-generation computer.

Omitted from this taxonomy is the &quot;zeroth-generation&quot; computer based on metal gears (such as the IBM 407) or mechanical relays (such as the Mark I), and the post-third-generation computers based on Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits.

There was also a parallel set of generations for software:
# First generation: Machine language.
# Second generation: Low-level programming languages such as Assembly language.
# Third generation: Structured high-level programming languages such as C, COBOL and FORTRAN.
# Fourth generation: &quot;Non-procedural&quot; high-level programming languages (such as object-oriented languages).

Throughout these multiple generations up to the 1970s, Japan built computers following U.S. and British leads. In the mid-1970s, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry stopped following western leads and started looking into the future of computing on a small scale. They asked the Japan Information Processing Development Center (JIPDEC) to indicate a number of future directions, and in 1979 offered a three-year contract to carry out more in-depth studies along with industry and academia. It was during this period that the term &quot;fifth-generation computer&quot; started to be used. 

Prior to the 1970s, MITI guidance had successes such as an improved steel industry, the creation of the oil supertanker, the automotive industry, consumer electronics, and computer memory. MITI decided that the future was going to be information technology. However, the Japanese language, particularly in its written form, presented and still presents obstacles for computers. As a result of these hurdles, MITI held a conference to seek assistance from experts.

The primary fields for investigation from this initial project were:

* Inference computer technologies for knowledge processing
* Computer technologies to process large-scale data bases and knowledge bases
* High-performance workstations
* Distributed functional computer technologies
* Super-computers for scientific calculation

== Project launch ==

The aim was to build parallel computers for artificial intelligence applications using concurrent logic programming. The project imagined an &quot;epoch-making&quot; computer with supercomputer-like performance running on top of large databases (as opposed to a traditional filesystem) using a logic programming language to define and access the data using massively parallel computing/processing. They envisioned building a prototype machine with performance between 100M and 1G LIPS, where a LIPS is a &quot;Logical Inference Per Second.&quot; At the time typical workstation machines were capable of about 100k LIPS. They proposed to build this machine over a ten-year period, 3 years for initial R&amp;D, 4 years for building various subsystems, and a final 3 years to complete a working prototype system. In 1982 the government decided to go ahead with the project, and established the Institute for New Generation Computer Technology (ICOT) through joint investment with various Japanese computer companies. After the project ended, MITI would consider an investment in a new &quot;sixth generation&quot; project. 

Ehud Shapiro captured the rationale and motivations driving this project:
&quot;As part of Japan&#x27;s effort to become a leader in the computer industry, the Institute for New Generation Computer Technology has launched a revolutionary ten-year plan for the development of large computer systems which will be applicable to knowledge information processing systems. These Fifth Generation computers will be built around the concepts of logic programming. In order to refute the accusation that Japan exploits knowledge from abroad without contributing any of its own, this project will stimulate original research and will make its results available to the international research community.&quot;

=== Logic programming ===

The target defined by the FGCS project was to develop &quot;Knowledge Information Processing systems&quot; (roughly meaning, applied Artificial Intelligence). The chosen tool to implement this goal was logic programming. Logic programming approach as was characterized by Maarten Van Emden – one of its founders – as:

* The use of logic to express information in a computer.
* The use of logic to present problems to a computer.
* The use of logical inference to solve these problems.

More technically, it can be summed up in two equations:

* &quot;Program&quot; = &quot;Set of axioms&quot;.
* &quot;Computation&quot; = &quot;Proof of a statement from axioms&quot;.

The Axioms typically used are universal axioms of a restricted form, called Horn-clauses or definite-clauses. The statement proved in a computation is an existential statement. The proof is constructive, and provides values for the existentially quantified variables: these values constitute the output of the computation.

Logic programming was thought of as something that unified various gradients of computer science (software engineering, databases, computer architecture and artificial intelligence). It seemed that logic programming was a key missing connection between knowledge engineering and parallel computer architectures.

== Results ==

After having influenced the consumer electronics field during the 1970s and the automotive world during the 1980s, the Japanese had developed a strong reputation. The launch of the FGCS project spread the belief that parallel computing was the future of all performance gains, producing a wave of apprehension in the computer field. Soon parallel projects were set up in the US as the Strategic Computing Initiative and the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (MCC), in the UK as Alvey, and in Europe as the European Strategic Program on Research in Information Technology (ESPRIT), as well as the European Computer‐Industry Research Centre (ECRC) in Munich, a collaboration between ICL in Britain, Bull in France, and Siemens in Germany.

The project ran from 1982 to 1994, spending a little less than ¥57 billion (about US$320 million) total. After the FGCS Project, MITI stopped funding large-scale computer research projects, and the research momentum developed by the FGCS Project dissipated. However MITI/ICOT embarked on a neural-net project which some called the Sixth Generation Project in the 1990s, with a similar level of funding. Per-year spending was less than 1% of the entire R&amp;D expenditure of the electronics and communications equipment industry. For example, the project&#x27;s highest expenditure year was 7.2 million yen in 1991, but IBM alone spent 1.5 billion dollars (370 billion yen) in 1982, while the industry spent 2150 billion yen in 1990.

=== Concurrent logic programming ===

In 1982, during a visit to the ICOT, Ehud Shapiro invented Concurrent Prolog, a novel programming language that integrated logic programming and concurrent programming. Concurrent Prolog is a process oriented language, which embodies dataflow synchronization and guarded-command indeterminacy as its basic control mechanisms. Shapiro described the language in a Report marked as ICOT Technical Report 003, which presented a Concurrent Prolog interpreter written in Prolog. Shapiro&#x27;s work on Concurrent Prolog inspired a change in the direction of the FGCS from focusing on parallel implementation of Prolog to the focus on concurrent logic programming as the software foundation for the project. It also inspired the concurrent logic programming language Guarded Horn Clauses (GHC) by Ueda, which was the basis of KL1, the programming language that was finally designed and implemented by the FGCS project as its core programming language.

The FGCS project and its findings contributed greatly to the development of the concurrent logic programming field. The project produced a new generation of promising Japanese researchers.

=== Commercial failure ===

Five running Parallel Inference Machines (PIM) were eventually produced: PIM/m, PIM/p, PIM/i, PIM/k, PIM/c. The project also produced applications to run on these systems, such as the parallel database management system Kappa, the legal reasoning system &quot;HELIC-II&quot;, and the automated theorem prover &quot;MGTP&quot;, as well as bioinformatics applications.

The FGCS Project did not meet with commercial success for reasons similar to the Lisp machine companies and Thinking Machines. The highly parallel computer architecture was eventually surpassed in speed by less specialized hardware (for example, Sun workstations and Intel x86 machines).

A primary problem was the choice of concurrent logic programming as the bridge between the parallel computer architecture and the use of logic as a knowledge representation and problem solving language for AI applications. This never happened cleanly; a number of languages were developed, all with their own limitations. In particular, the committed choice feature of concurrent constraint logic programming interfered with the logical semantics of the languages. The project found that the benefits of logic programming were largely negated using committed choice.

Another problem was that existing CPU performance quickly overcame the barriers that experts anticipated in the 1980s, and the value of parallel computing dropped to the point where it was for some time used only in niche situations. Although a number of workstations of increasing capacity were designed and built over the project&#x27;s lifespan, they generally found themselves soon outperformed by &quot;off the shelf&quot; units available commercially.

The project also failed to incorporate outside innovations. During its lifespan, GUIs became mainstream in computers; the internet enabled locally stored databases to become distributed; and even simple research projects provided better real-world results in data mining. 

The FGCS workstations had no appeal in a market where general purpose systems could replace and outperform them. This is parallel to the Lisp machine market, where rule-based systems such as CLIPS could run on general-purpose computers, making expensive Lisp machines unnecessary.

=== Ahead of its time ===

In summary, the Fifth-Generation project was revolutionary, and accomplished some basic research that anticipated future research directions. Many papers and patents were published. MITI established a committee which assessed the performance of the FGCS Project as having made major contributions in computing, in particular eliminating bottlenecks in parallel processing software and the realization of intelligent
interactive processing based on large knowledge bases. However, the committee was strongly biased to justify the project, so this overstates the actual results.

Many of the themes seen in the Fifth-Generation project are now being re-interpreted in current technologies, as the hardware limitations foreseen in the 1980s were finally reached in the 2000s. When clock speeds of CPUs began to move into the 3–5 GHz range, CPU power dissipation and other problems became more important. The ability of industry to produce ever-faster single CPU systems (linked to Moore&#x27;s Law about the periodic doubling of transistor counts) began to be threatened. 

In the early 21st century, many flavors of parallel computing began to proliferate, including multi-core architectures at the low-end and massively parallel processing at the high end. Ordinary consumer machines and game consoles began to have parallel processors like the Intel Core, AMD K10, and Cell. Graphics card companies like Nvidia and AMD began introducing large parallel systems like CUDA and OpenCL. 

It appears, however, that these new technologies do not cite FGCS research. It is not clear if FGCS was leveraged to facilitate these developments in any significant way. No significant impact of FGCS on the computing industry has been demonstrated.

<text>The Norfolk Southern Railway is a Class I freight railroad operating in the Eastern United States. Headquartered in Atlanta, the company was formed in 1982 with the merger of the Norfolk and Western Railway and Southern Railway. The company operates in 22 eastern states, the District of Columbia, and has rights in Canada over the Albany to Montreal route of the Canadian Pacific Kansas City. Norfolk Southern Railway is the leading subsidiary of the Norfolk Southern Corporation.

Norfolk Southern maintains 28,400 miles of track, with the rest managed by other parties through trackage rights. Intermodal containers and trailers are the most common commodity type carried by NS, which have grown as the coal business has declined throughout the 21st century; coal was formerly the largest traffic source. The railway offers the largest intermodal rail network in eastern North America. NS was also the pioneer of Roadrailer service. Norfolk Southern and its chief competitor, CSX Transportation, have a duopoly on the transcontinental freight rail lines in the Eastern United States.

Norfolk Southern is the namesake and leading subsidiary of the Norfolk Southern Corporation, based in Atlanta, Georgia; it was headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia, until 2021. Norfolk Southern Corporation was incorporated in Virginia on July 23, 1980, and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol &quot;NSC&quot;. The primary business function of Norfolk Southern Corporation is the rail transportation of raw materials, intermediate products, and finished goods across the Southeast, East, and Midwest United States. The corporation further facilitates transport to the remainder of the United States through interchange with other rail carriers while also serving overseas transport needs by serving several Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports. As of February 2024, Norfolk Southern Corporation&#x27;s total public stock value is $57.869. As of January 2024, Norfolk Southern&#x27;s operating revenue is $3.07 billion.

==History==
Norfolk Southern is one of the five biggest railroad operators in North America by its revenue. It operates in 22 states and in Washington, D.C. The company&#x27;s market capitalization stood at nearly $58 billion in February 2024.

=== Corporate history ===
==== Predecessors ====
Norfolk Southern&#x27;s predecessor railroads date to the early 19th century.

The South Carolina Canal &amp; Rail Road was the SOU&#x27;s earliest predecessor line. Chartered in 1827, the South Carolina Canal &amp; Rail Road Company became the first to offer regularly scheduled passenger train service with the inaugural run of the &quot;Best Friend of Charleston&quot; in 1830. Another early predecessor, the Richmond &amp; Danville Railroad (R&amp;D), was formed in 1847 and expanded into a large system after the American Civil War under Algernon S. Buford. The R&amp;D ultimately fell on hard times, and in 1894, it became a major portion of the new Southern Railway (SOU). Financier J. P. Morgan selected veteran railroader Samuel Spencer as president. Profitable and innovative, Southern became, in 1953, the first major U.S. railroad to completely switch to diesel-electric locomotives from steam.

The City Point Railroad, established in 1838, was a railroad in Virginia that started south of Richmond—specifically, City Point on the navigable portion of the James River, now part of the independent city of Hopewell—and ran to Petersburg. It was acquired by the South Side Railroad in 1854. After the Civil War, it became part of the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad (AM&amp;O), a trunk line across Virginia&#x27;s southern tier formed by mergers in 1870 by William Mahone, who had built the Norfolk &amp; Petersburg Railroad in the 1850s. The AM&amp;O was the oldest portion of the Norfolk &amp; Western (N&amp;W) when it was formed in 1881, under E. W. Clark &amp; Co., ownership with a keen interest and financial investments in the coal fields of Western Virginia and West Virginia. In the second half of the 20th century, the N&amp;W acquired the Virginian Railway (1959), the Wabash Railway, and the Nickel Plate Road, among others.

==== Formation ====
In January 1979, major eastern United States railroad holding companies Chessie System and Seaboard System Railroad applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission for approval to merge and create CSX Corporation. In response, the Southern Railway (SOU, formed in 1894) and Norfolk &amp; Western Railway (N&amp;W, formed in 1881) quickly decided a merger of their own would be advantageous. The two companies announced their merger plans in April 1979; the CSX merger went ahead in 1980. In 1982, SOU and N&amp;W concluded their own merger, creating Norfolk Southern Corporation. In 1990, Norfolk Southern Corporation transferred all the common stock of N&amp;W to Southern, and Southern&#x27;s name was changed to Norfolk Southern Railway Company. In 1998, Norfolk and Western was merged into Norfolk Southern Railway, forming one, united, railroad. Headquarters for the new NS were established in Norfolk, Virginia. The company suffered a slight embarrassment when the marble headpiece at the building&#x27;s entrance was unveiled, which read &quot;Norfork Southern Railway&quot;. A new headpiece replaced the erroneous one several weeks later.

==== Conrail purchase ====

The system grew with the acquisition of over half of Conrail. The Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) was an system formed in 1976 from the Penn Central Railroad (1968–1976), and five other ailing northeastern railroads that were conveyed into it, forming a government-financed corporation. Conrail was perhaps the most controversial conglomerate in corporate history. Penn Central itself was created by merging three venerable rivals—the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR, 1846), the New York Central Railroad (NYC, 1831), and the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad (NYNH&amp;H, 1872)—as well as some smaller competitors. In 1980, Conrail became profitable after the Staggers Act largely deregulated the U.S. railroad industry.

When the U.S. government offered up Conrail for sale in 1983, Norfolk Southern was one of the 18 bidders to make offers. The government decided the NS offer was the best choice, and by 1985 had begun planning to sell Conrail to NS. Extensive opposition from competitors, particularly CSX, persuaded the government that selling Conrail to one railroad would create too powerful of a company. As an alternative, Conrail leader (and former Southern Railway CEO) L. Stanley Crane proposed an initial public offering to privatize the company, which was ultimately carried out in 1987 instead of a sale to one operator.

NS again expressed interest in a Conrail purchase in 1994, but this time Conrail publicly stated it had no interest in selling to another company. The company began to reconsider this stance after several expansion initiatives failed. After confidential discussions, Conrail and CSX made a surprise announcement in October 1996 that CSX would acquire the company. Norfolk Southern was unwilling to let a CSX purchase go through, beginning a bidding war between the two competitors that was only resolved in January 1997 when an agreement was reached to split Conrail.

NS and CSX applied to the Surface Transportation Board (STB) for authority to purchase, divide, and operate the assets of Conrail in June 1997. On June 8, 1998, the STB approved the NS-CSX application, effective August 22, 1998. NS acquired 58% of Conrail assets, including about of track, most of which was part of the former Pennsylvania Railroad. CSX got the remaining 42%. NS began operating its trains on its portion of the former Conrail network on June 1, 1999, closing out the 1990s merger era.

====Pennsylvania Lines LLC====

Pennsylvania Lines LLC was a limited liability company was formed in 1998 to own Conrail lines assigned to Norfolk Southern in the split of Conrail; operations were switched over on June 1, 1999. The company is named after the old Pennsylvania Railroad, whose old main line was a line of the new company. In November, 2003, the Surface Transportation Board approved a plan allowing Norfolk Southern to fully absorb Pennsylvania Lines LLC, which was done on August 27, 2004.

==== 21st century ====
In 2016, a proposed merger that had been months in the pipeline with Canadian Pacific was abandoned abruptly.

According to NS&#x27;s 2022 Annual Report to Investors, at the end of 2022, NS had 19,300 employees, 3,190 locomotives, and 40,470 freight cars. At the end of 2022, the transport of coal made up 14% of the total operating revenue of NS, general merchandise (automotive, chemicals, metals, construction materials, agriculture commodities, consumer products, paper, clay, forest products, and more) made up 57%, and intermodal made up 29% of the total.

On December 12, 2018, Norfolk Southern announced that it would be leaving its hometown of Norfolk, Virginia after 38 years and relocating its headquarters to Atlanta, Georgia. The new Atlanta headquarters building opened on November 10, 2021.

In June 2023, Norfolk Southern became the first major North American railroad to offer sick time to all union workers.

In July 2023, Norfolk Southern announced plans to purchase the Cincinnati Southern Railway for $1.6 billion. Cincinnati voters approved the sale in the November 2023 election. Norfolk Southern will pay the city $1.6 billion and Cincinnati will establish a trust fund with the money, with earned interest going back to Cincinnati to maintain infrastructure.

In 2024, the company nominated a slate of new board members. In a letter to shareholders, NS asked them to vote for its slate of 13 nominees at its May shareholder meeting. The company defended its choice of board members, citing the board&#x27;s work to improve long-term shareholder value, hold management accountable, and improve safety and operational performance. Among the 13 nominees, two of them are for new independent directors—Richard H. Anderson, former CEO of Amtrak and Delta Air Lines, and Heidi Heitkamp, a former U.S. Senator. In 2023, retired Navy Admiral Philip Davidson, and Francesca DeBiase, former executive at McDonald&#x27;s Corporation, were appointed to the board.

=== Environmental history ===
In early spring of 2008, the state program manager for air quality planning in Georgia, Jimmy Johnston, had been talking to NS about voluntary upgrades to reduce the company&#x27;s environmental impact. NS is upgrading 3,800 of its locomotives with new technology that is 73 percent more efficient than previous models. The new technology being put into the locomotives makes the ride more fuel efficient and reduces idle time.

In 2009, the company introduced an experimental battery-electric switcher locomotive, NS 999. This prototype locomotive was developed by Norfolk Southern in collaboration with the United States Department of Energy, the Federal Railroad Administration and the Pennsylvania State University.

Norfolk Southern reduced core greenhouse gasses by 13.5% between 2019 and 2021. For its efforts, the company achieved recognition from USA Today&#x27;s America&#x27;s Climate Leaders 2023 and Forbes&#x27; Net Zero Leaders 2023.

In November 2022, Norfolk Southern contributed $750,000 to the Georgia Tech sustainability program for the next three years.

In order to align itself with climate-change goals set by the Paris Agreement, NS aims to cut its scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 42% by 2034. NS has begun measures to lower emissions, such as modernizing more than 100 locomotives each year and equipping 93% of its active locomotive fleet, or 1550 locomotives, with energy-management technology.

The company has made efforts to improve environmental sustainability, according to Progressive Railroading magazine. In 2007, the company established the rail industry&#x27;s first chief sustainability officer and published its first sustainability report in 2008. In 2021, Norfolk Southern set a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 42% by 2034 and has already achieved a 6% reduction. The company is also upgrading 1,000 locomotives to enhance fuel efficiency and incorporating biofuels and renewable energy into its operations.

=== Labor history ===
Since 2019, a labor dispute between Norfolk Southern Railway and railway workers has been underway. In September 2022, the workers and companies involved tentatively agreed to a deal, but it was rejected by a majority of the union&#x27;s members. In late 2022, the United States Congress intervened to prevent a strike by passing the tentative deal into law. Norfolk Southern was the first railroad to offer paid sick leave to all employees. In May 2023, Norfolk Southern agreed to provide up to seven paid sick days per year to employees, meeting one of the workforce demands that nearly led to a nation-wide rail strike in December 2022. On December 6, 2022, Norfolk Southern announced a new service and growth plan that will ensure the company maintains its train crew levels during downturns.

In 2024, an investor group led an effort to bring in a new leadership team at NS. The proposal would have removed Alan Shaw as CEO and replaced seven directors on the company&#x27;s board. The division of organized labor on the issue surfaced in April. Labor was divided on the issue, which led to a proxy battle ahead of an annual shareholder meeting. Unions criticized investors&#x27; plans to replace Shaw and implement an industry operating model known as Precision Scheduled Railroading, saying such a model is &quot;unrealistic.&quot; In the end, shareholders voted to keep Shaw as CEO, but voted in three new directors.

=== Norfolk Southern Railway Police ===
Norfolk Southern Railway maintains its own railroad police force, tasked with enforcing laws and investigating incidents involving the company&#x27;s property. The Norfolk Southern Police Department, based in Atlanta, operates across 22 states with special agents responsible for protecting employees, the public, company property, and freight. The department&#x27;s Police Communications Center, also in Atlanta, functions 24/7, coordinating field operations. Officers receive state-mandated training to maintain certification, alongside additional annual training provided by the department.

Critics have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as these officers are employed by the railroad and may prioritize protecting corporate interests over public safety. In 2023, an accident involving a Norfolk Southern train in Georgia severely injured Charlotte Cleary, a 14-year-old girl. This case became central to growing calls for reform and increased independent oversight of railroad policing practices. In November 2024, shots were fired at Norfolk Southern Railway police officers during an investigation of a burglary in Chicago. The officers were unharmed, and the suspects fled.

The Norfolk Southern Police runs a program called Protect the Line that encourages citizens and employees to report suspicious activity. The Police Communications Center coordinates responses to potential threats or incidents across the railroad&#x27;s 20,000 miles of track.

==Notable accidents==
On September 15, 2002, a Norfolk Southern train derailed in Farragut, Tennessee. The derailment resulted in the release of oleum or fuming sulfuric acid. Roughly 2,600 residents were evacuated from nearby homes for three days until hazardous materials crews were able to mitigate the scene. No fatalities or major injuries were reported as a result of the derailment, but property damage and losses were calculated at $1.02 million. Seventeen people were injured.

On January 6, 2005, a derailment in Graniteville, South Carolina, resulted in a large amount of chlorine and diesel fuel being released into nearby waterways. In addition, a toxic cloud covered the city resulting in the town being evacuated. Local wildlife was killed, many of the local crops and vegetation were contaminated or killed, nine human deaths were reported, and thousands were injured. The company was taken to court and fined for violating the Clean Water Act and the Federal Superfund law. NS spent a total of $26 million for the cleanup.

Derailments incidents also occurred in Pennsylvania in 2018, and in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023.

===2018 Pennsylvania derailment===
A derailment happened in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, on the afternoon of August 5, 2018, when the train was heading from New Jersey to Chicago.

===2023 Ohio derailment===

On February 3, 2023, a freight train carrying vinyl chloride, butyl acrylate, ethylhexyl acrylate and ethylene glycol monobutyl ether derailed along Norfolk Southern Railways Fort Wayne Line in East Palestine, Ohio, United States. Emergency crews conducted a controlled burn of the spill which released hydrogen chloride and phosgene into the air.

In May 2023, Norfolk Southern announced compensation plans for homeowners whose homes lost value near the 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. The program applies to parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania near the derailment site and applies to those with homes on the market, future listings or sold since February 3, 2023.

NS has also added more trackside detectors to help spot mechanical problems like wheel-bearing temperatures following the Ohio derailment. Six months after the accident, contractors removed about 25 million gallons of wastewater and 80,000 tons of contaminated soil. By July 2023, NS spent $63 million to support the community, including about $18 million to reimburse families for housing, food and other expenses. Within eight months of the accident, Norfolk Southern removed more than 167,000 tons of contaminated soil and more than 39 million gallons of tainted water from the site. Norfolk Southern is continuing to collect 2,500 soil samples from the site to ensure all the contamination is gone.

As of June 2024, Norfolk Southern contributed over $107 million in aid to East Palestine, including nearly $21 million paid out directly to residents whose lives were affected by the derailment. Norfolk Southern worked on several projects in East Palestine, including renovating the historic train depot, enhancing City Lake, improving the municipal water treatment plant, renovating East Palestine City Park, and establishing a First Responder Training Center.

Residents in East Palestine affected by the Norfolk Southern train derailment have the option to join a class action lawsuit to potentially receive a portion of a $600 million settlement. The agreement-in-principle of the class action lawsuit includes compensation for residents and businesses in East Palestine and surrounding communities for personal injuries resulting from exposure to chemicals. Accepting payment from the rail company now would prevent homeowners from pursuing future litigations against Norfolk Southern. On September 25, 2024, the $600 million settlement was given final approval by U.S. District Judge Benita Y. Pearson, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. There are 464,000 potential class members, and only 1 percent opted out of the settlement, while 86 objected. Over 90 percent of East Palestine households have reportedly filed claims to access the settlement. Approximately 27 percent of the settlement fund, or around $162 million, will be set aside for attorneys&#x27; fees to be divided between over 35 law firms that participated in the lawsuit.

The U.S. Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reached a settlement with Norfolk Southern Railway Company in May 2024 to address the derailment. The settlement includes over $310 million for cleanup efforts, penalties, and future costs associated with the environmental impact. However, Norfolk Southern officials estimate that the company will end up paying over $1 billion to address contamination in East Palestine.

In January 2025, Norfolk Southern faced a $5 million lawsuit filed by local business owners in East Palestine, Ohio. The lawsuit alleges significant damages stemming from the derailment and chemical spill, with the plaintiffs citing lost income, property damage, and emotional and physical distress as consequences of the incident. Despite their property being rendered inaccessible and unusable due to contamination, the lawsuit claims that Norfolk Southern failed to undertake cleanup efforts, leaving the area unsafe.

In January 2025, East Palestine and Norfolk Southern reached a $22 million settlement. The settlement will fund village priorities related to the derailment and acknowledges the $13.5 million Norfolk Southern has already paid for water treatment upgrades and new police and fire equipment. It also complements Norfolk Southern&#x27;s agreement to allocate $25 million towards ongoing improvements at East Palestine City Park, separate from this settlement.

That same month, two owners of a local bar filed a $5 million lawsuit against company, alleging that the company’s role in the derailment led to their business closure, property damage, and emotional distress.

==== NTSB investigation ====
The National Transportation Safety Board found that Norfolk Southern mishandled its response to the derailment. According to the NTSB, Norfolk Southern obstructed the government&#x27;s investigation into the derailment by withholding important safety information from first responders and local authorities. NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy accused the company of threatening the board and obstructing the investigation by delaying or failing to provide critical information. Homendy described Norfolk Southern&#x27;s behavior as “unconscionable” and “reprehensible,” citing the company&#x27;s attempt to manufacture evidence by hiring a private firm to conduct tests outside of the NTSB process.

The NTSB issued a report in June 2024 on its investigation into the derailment. NTSB&#x27;s investigators found that Norfolk Southern gave incomplete and misleading information to the local incident commander following the derailment and chemical spill. The incident commander, based on this information, conducted a vent and burn of the toxic chemical vinyl chloride monomer from the tank car. An NTSB investigator and the Federal Railroad Administration found that the vent and burn was unnecessary. The chemical burn released toxic contaminants into the air, soil, and water in East Palestine, according to the science director at the Science and Environmental Health Network, Todd Schettler. The NTSB concluded that this decision was based on misinterpreted evidence, contributing to unnecessary environmental harm.

==Safety==
Norfolk Southern has introduced safety programs to protect employees and local communities. In 2015, Norfolk Southern introduced the Operation Awareness &amp; Response program, which trains around 5,000 first responders annually, equipping them with the knowledge to handle rail-related emergencies effectively.

In early 2023, Norfolk Southern rolled out a comprehensive six-point safety plan which included installing approximately 200 additional hot bearing detectors across its rail network. These detectors are essential in identifying potential issues before they become serious problems, thereby enhancing the overall safety of the rail operations.

To address the safety of transporting hazardous materials, in May 2023, Norfolk Southern enlisted the help of Atkins Nuclear Secured (ANS). The team, led by a former chief of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Nuclear Propulsion program and comprising several ex-Navy admirals, was tasked with evaluating and improving the railroad&#x27;s safety protocols.

That same month, CEO Alan Shaw, along with 12 union leaders, took a united stand on safety by issuing a joint letter. This letter emphasized their commitment to improving rail safety for both employees and the communities within Norfolk Southern&#x27;s service areas.

By September 2023, Norfolk Southern had begun constructing a state-of-the-art railroad safety training center in East Palestine. With a budget of $20 million, this facility is designed to train first responders from Ohio, Pennsylvania, and surrounding areas on how to handle various railroad emergencies.

October 2023 saw Norfolk Southern implementing cutting-edge technology with the introduction of Digital Train Inspection Portals. The first of these portals, located between Leetonia and Columbiana, features 42 powerful lights and 38 high-definition cameras to capture detailed images of passing trains. These images are then analyzed by computers to detect any defects that might lead to derailments, marking a significant advancement in rail safety in the United States.

Norfolk Southern&#x27;s safety achievements in 2023 were notable. It was the only Class I railroad to significantly reduce the rate of mainline derailments, even as the industry as a whole experienced a decline in this area.

In January 2024, Norfolk Southern made history by becoming the first Class I railroad to join the federal Confidential Close Call Reporting System (C3RS). This program allows employees to anonymously report near-miss incidents. Later in 2024, the company instructed its employees inspect each railcar in under a minute, raising criticisms from unions and federal safety officials, who argue the policy prioritizes speed over thoroughness and jeopardizes rail safety. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) said it would closely monitor the policy&#x27;s impact.

In July 2024, Norfolk Southern agreed to implement a series of safety recommendations made by the National Transportation Safety Board following a February 2023 train derailment in East Palestine. The NTSB recommendations include improving rail defect detection systems, modernize nationwide tank car fleets, and getting real-time rail safety information to emergency responders.

=== FRA safety assessment ===
In August 2023, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) published a report on Norfolk Southern&#x27;s safety culture, which it rated at an &quot;involving&quot; level of maturity—level 3 out of 5 on the Fleming Safety Culture Maturity Model. The FRA acknowledged the railroad&#x27;s efforts to improve safety but noted that some practices were still aligned only with the minimum standards set by law. Norfolk Southern responded by committing to address the findings and further enhance its safety culture.

The report, called the 2023 Norfolk Southern Safety Culture Assessment, identified several deficiencies in the company&#x27;s safety practices, particularly regarding training, communication, and compliance. The report stated that Norfolk Southern&#x27;s conductor training, especially its 13-day classroom program, was insufficient for the complexity of Class I railroad operations. On-the-job training was found to be inconsistent and poorly structured, increasing the likelihood of unsafe practices. Additionally, the company failed to comply with federal regulations concerning qualified instructor designations, further undermining the effectiveness of its safety training programs.

The report also highlighted communication failures within the company, particularly between dispatchers and the Advanced Train Control desk, which led to delays in responding to critical safety alarms. Norfolk Southern&#x27;s focus on meeting only minimum safety standards rather than implementing proactive improvements was another major concern. Despite previous safety audits and opportunities to address these issues, the company demonstrated slow progress in rectifying critical deficiencies, leading to ongoing risks in its operations. These shortcomings contributed to an overall weak safety culture at the railroad.

However, the report did include notes about areas that the railroad is doing well. For example, the report acknowledged Norfolk Southern&#x27;s partnership with Atkins Nuclear Secured to assess and enhance its safety culture, with the FRA recognizing the partnership as a constructive effort aimed at addressing the company&#x27;s safety challenges. The report commended Norfolk Southern for taking corrective actions based on the assessment&#x27;s findings.

=== Alan Shaw ===

Alan Shaw, who became CEO in May 2022, was with Norfolk Southern from 1994 to September 11, 2024, holding various positions within the company. Shaw holds a Bachelor of Science and an MBA from Virginia Tech, and he completed the General Management Program at Harvard Business School. In December 2022, he introduced a new strategy for Norfolk Southern that focuses on enhancing service reliability and investing in resources like locomotives, technology, and employee training. After a train derailment in 2023 in East Palestine, Ohio, Shaw visited residents, assuring them of NS&#x27;s commitment to assisting with the cleanup and recovery efforts after the derailment. In 2023, Shaw received the Railway Innovator Award, an industry given by Progressive Railroading and RailTrends. Shaw was terminated because of an inappropriate consensual relationship with the company&#x27;s Chief Legal Officer.

=== 2024 executive hires ===
Norfolk Southern made several key executive appointments announced in August 2024. John Orr, the chief operating officer, named Tim Livingston as senior vice president of transportation and network operations. Livingston brings Rodney Moore, vice president of transportation for the northern region, and Dewayne Swindall, vice president of transportation for the southern region. Moore has been with Norfolk Southern for 20 years, while Swindall previously served as head of the Indiana Rail Road.

Additionally, Anil Bhatt was appointed as executive vice president and chief information and digital officer. Bhatt, who previously served as chief information officer at Elevance Health, will focus on advancing Norfolk Southern&#x27;s technological capabilities and operational efficiency. He will work with chief marketing officer Ed Elkins and chief operating officer John Orr to implement technology solutions in the areas of safety, productivity, and customer service.

==Current trackage==
===Regional divisions===
On March 15, 2016, Norfolk Southern consolidated its three operation regions into two: northern and southern regions. The northern region includes Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, Dearborn, Lake, and Illinois divisions. The southern region includes Piedmont, Alabama, Georgia, Central, and Pocahontas divisions.

The two merged regions will support approximately 1,000 daily crew starts for long-haul train operations. The consolidation was part of Norfolk Southern&#x27;s five-year strategic plan to enhance operating efficiencies while reducing costs.

===Premier Corridor===

The Premier Corridor is Norfolk Southern&#x27;s principal east–west line from the East Coast to the Midwest. An average day sees 100 trains of all types. The corridor&#x27;s main (New York to Chicago) segment consists of the Lehigh Line, Reading Line, Harrisburg Line, Pittsburgh Line, Fort Wayne Line, Cleveland Line, and Chicago Line.

===Chicago Bypass===
===Meridian Speedway===
===Pan Am Southern/Patriot Corridor===
On May 15, 2008, NS announced that it would join with Pan Am Railways to create the &quot;Patriot Corridor&quot;, an improved rail route between Albany, New York, and the greater Boston, Massachusetts, area. On March 12, 2009, STB approved the deal. Each of the two companies now owns 50% of a new company known as Pan Am Southern (PAS). PAR&#x27;s trackage between Ayer, Massachusetts, and Mechanicville, New York, was transferred to PAS and continues to be operated and maintained by PAR&#x27;s Springfield Terminal Railway Company subsidiary. NS transferred to PAS cash and property valued at $140 million. The railroad operates 22K and 23K from Mechanicville, NY to Ayer, MA. Due to the unique ACSES PTC system used on Keolis-operated trackage, which the 22K and 23K runs on between Wachusett and Ayer, only specific SD60E locomotives equipped with ACSES can lead trains.

In 2021, CSX announced its intention to purchase Pan Am Railways. Norfolk Southern protested, arguing that CSX, which would own 50% of Pan Am Southern, would be able to block Norfolk Southern out of the northeast. As part of the Surface Transportation Board merger requirements, CSX will give NS limited trackage rights to run intermodal trains, and Pan Am Southern will be operated by the Pittsburg and Shawmut Railroad, under the name Berkshire and Eastern Railroad.

==Yards and facilities==

Norfolk Southern operates 35,600 miles (57,300 kilometers) of track primarily in the eastern United States, covering 22 states. It maintains four major hubs in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Chicago, and Atlanta, along with various facilities like classification yards and intermodal yards. The company also holds trackage rights that allow it to run its trains on other railroads&#x27; tracks, extending its operations to places like Dallas, Texas, Waterville, Maine, and Miami, Florida, while also participating in locomotive leasing and sharing with other Class I railroads.

===General freight classification yards===

===Intermodal classification yards===
===Locomotive shops===

NS also shares interest with CSX in the Oak Island Yard, managed by Conrail Shared Assets Operations in Newark, New Jersey.

===Steam excursion programs===
After the 1982 merger, NS President Robert Claytor retained the Southern Railway&#x27;s steam excursion program begun in the 1960s by his brother, SOU president W. Graham Claytor. NS initially used former Chesapeake and Ohio 2716, which had been modified and decorated as a Southern locomotive for the steam program; however, the engine developed mechanical problems in its firebox after less than a year in excursion service and was replaced by Nickel Plate Road 765.

Merging with the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway prompted the steam program to acquire and overhaul Norfolk &amp; Western 611 in 1982, and Norfolk &amp; Western 1218 in 1987. These two locomotives and 765 joined the steam program veterans – Southern Railway 4501, Savannah and Atlanta Railway 750, Nickel Plate 587, Louisville &amp; Nashville 152, Atlanta and West Point 290, Tennessee Valley Railroad 610, and Frisco 1522 – for an extensive series of excursions throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s. Norfolk Southern&#x27;s management under David R. Goode was forced to end the program in late 1994, citing safety concerns, rising insurance costs, the expense of maintaining the steam locomotives and decreasing rail network availability due to a surge in freight traffic.

In June 2010, Norfolk Southern CEO Wick Moorman announced that NS would run excursions with Southern Railway 4501, Southern Railway 630, and U.S. Army 610 with their new 21st Century Steam program.

The program began in 2011 with excursions in the south powered by 630 and in the north by 765. On February 22, 2013, the Virginia Museum of Transportation (611&#x27;s owner) formed a campaign called &quot;Fire Up 611!&quot; to conduct a feasibility study with the goal of returning the 611 to active service and have it join the program. The locomotive was removed from her static display from the Virginia Museum of Transportation to the North Carolina Transportation Museum in 2014 to be overhauled. That same year, TVRM completed their restoration of Southern Railway 4501 – joining the 21st Century Steam program for the 2015 season and pulling excursions in Tennessee, Virginia, and Georgia. The restoration of 611 was completed in May 2015 and celebrated with a run to Roanoke, Virginia, where it was originally built. The 611 pulled several excursions in Virginia and was featured in special events at the North Carolina Transportation Museum. In December 2015, Norfolk Southern had concluded their program; however, the 611 continued to run various excursions, hosted by the Virginia Museum of Transportation and the North Carolina Transportation Museum instead of Norfolk Southern across the NS system in Virginia and North Carolina until 2018. Norfolk Southern currently limits the steam locomotives up to on their system.

===Rolling stock===
==Reporting marks==
Although it has been widely known as simply &quot;Norfolk Southern&quot; since 1982, the corporate structure and reporting marks are more complicated. In 1999, when most of Conrail&#x27;s former PRR trackage was sold to the Norfolk Southern Railway, the Pennsylvania Railway Lines was created and PRR reporting marks used on the former Conrail motive power and rolling stock.

<text>Slowworms (also called blindworms and hazelworms) are a small genus (Anguis) of snake-like legless lizards in the family [[Anguidae]]. The genus contains five extant living species, including the common slowworm (&quot;A. fragilis&quot;), the eastern slowworm (&quot;A. colchica&quot;), the Greek slowworm (&quot;A. graeca&quot;), the Peloponnese slowworm (&quot;A. cephalonnica&quot;), and the Italian slowworm (&quot;A. veronensis&quot;). There are also known fossil species.

==Description==
Slowworms are typically grey-brown, with the females having a coppery sheen and two lateral black stripes, and the males displaying electric blue spots, particularly in the breeding season. They give birth to live young, which are about long at birth and generally have golden stripes.

Slowworms are slow-moving and can be easily caught, which has given rise to the folk etymology that the &quot;slow&quot; in slowworm is the same as the English adjective slow; the actual origin is a proto-Germanic root which simply means &quot;slowworm&quot; (cf. German &quot;Schleiche&quot;). Like many lizards, slowworms can shed their tails to distract predators. The tail regrows, but never fully. Principal predators are birds, badgers, hedgehogs, foxes and domestic cats.

The average British slowworm can grow to 45 cm when fully mature and weigh about 100 g, females being slightly larger than the males. The tail makes up around half its length, but is indistinguishable from the body. It has been recorded to live for up to 30 years in wild, and the record age for a slowworm in captivity is 54 years (Copenhagen Zoo).

The specific name &quot;fragilis&quot; (fragile) comes from the tendency of this species to shed its own tail, when threatened by predators, or if handled too roughly (caudal autotomy).

==Morphology==
Although slowworms much resemble snakes, and are often mistaken for such, they are actually lizards that have lost their limbs completely with evolution.

Slowworms can be distinguished from snakes by several features: their eyelids, which snakes lack (having brille instead); their small ear openings, which again snakes lack; and their tongues, which are notched in the centre rather than completely forked like a snake&#x27;s. Further, snakes have an opening in their upper jaw to allow their tongue through, which slowworms lack.

==Habitat==
Slowworms live in any habitat that is warm and protected, such as woodland, grassland, and heathland; they are frequently found in garden compost heaps, sometimes on purpose for pest control. They range across most of Europe, and into parts of Asia, but they are restricted to temperate and humid habitats. They hibernate from October to February/March, both communally and solitarily, and sometimes share hibernating sites with other reptiles.

==Diet==
Slowworms have grooved teeth which allow them to grab and swallow whole their soft invertebrate prey, such as slugs, hairless caterpillars, other insects, spiders, and earthworms. Snails are usually avoided, except when they are still very young and the shell can be broken easily.

==Protected status==
Slowworms are protected in the United Kingdom, Poland and Slovakia.

==Classification==

<text>Ophisaurus (from the Greek &#x27;snake-lizard&#x27;) is a genus of superficially snake-like legless lizards in the subfamily Anguinae. Known as joint snakes, glass snakes, or glass lizards, they are so-named because their tails are easily broken; like many lizards, they have the ability to deter predation by dropping off part of the tail, which can break into several pieces, like glass. The tail remains mobile, distracting the predator, while the lizard becomes motionless, allowing eventual escape. This serious loss of body mass requires a considerable effort to replace, and can take years to do so. Despite this ability, the new tail is usually smaller than the original.

Although most species have no legs, their head shapes, movable eyelids, and external ear openings identify them as lizards. A few species have very small, stub-like legs near their rear vents. These are vestigial organs, meaning they once served an evolved purpose but are no longer used. They reach lengths of up to , but about two-thirds of this is the tail. Glass lizards feed on insects, spiders, other small reptiles, and young rodents. Their diets are limited by their inability to unhinge their jaws. Some glass lizards give birth to live young but most lay eggs.

==Feeding==
Their diets consist primarily of arthropods, with larger animals eating snails and small mammals.

==Species==
The genus &quot;Ophisaurus&quot; (&quot;sensu lato&quot;) contains two monophyletic sister clades, one native to North America, the other to Asia, the latter is sometimes treated as the separate genus &quot;Dopasia.&quot;

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: In the list below, a binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Ophisaurus&quot;.

* &quot;Ophisaurus&quot; &quot;sensu stricto&quot;: (native to North America)
**&quot;Ophisaurus attenuatus&quot; – slender glass lizard
**&quot;Ophisaurus ceroni&quot; – Ceron&#x27;s glass lizard
**&quot;Ophisaurus compressus&quot; – island glass lizard
**&quot;Ophisaurus incomptus&quot; – plainneck glass lizard
**&quot;Ophisaurus mimicus&quot; – mimic glass lizard
**&quot;Ophisaurus ventralis&quot; – eastern glass lizard
* &quot;Ophisaurus/Dopasia&quot; (native to Asia)
** &quot;Ophisaurus buettikoferi&quot; – Buettikofer&#x27;s glass lizard
** &quot;Ophisaurus gracilis&quot; – Burmese glass lizard, Asian glass lizard, Indian glass snake
** &quot;Ophisaurus hainanensis&quot; – Hainan glass lizard
** &quot;Ophisaurus harti&quot; – Hart&#x27;s glass lizard
** &quot;Ophisaurus ludovici&quot; – Ludovic&#x27;s glass lizard
** &quot;Ophisaurus sokolovi&quot; – Sokolov&#x27;s glass lizard
** &quot;Ophisaurus wegneri&quot; – Wegner&#x27;s glass lizard

&quot;Hyalosaurus&quot; from North Africa has also been included within the concept of &quot;Ophisaurus sensu lato&quot;, but genetic evidence has shown them to be more closely related to &quot;Anguis&quot; and &quot;Pseudopus&quot;.

=== Fossil record ===
&quot;Ophisaurus sensu lato&quot; was once widely distributed in Europe, first appearing there during the Eocene, with its distribution at its maximum extent during the Miocene, their range had contracted to the Mediterranean by the late Pliocene. The youngest records of &quot;Ophisaurus&quot; in Europe are from southern Spain, dating to the Early-Mid Pleistocene transition around 800,000 years ago. The decline was likely caused by decreasing temperatures and increasing aridity due to the onset of glaciation. &quot;Ophisaurus&quot; &quot;sensu lato&quot; likely dispersed into Asia from Europe before dispersing from Asia into North America via Beringia. The oldest records of &quot;Ophisaurus&quot; in North America are from the late Miocene.

<text>Nuclear medicine (nuclear radiology, nucleology), is a medical specialty involving the application of radioactive substances in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Nuclear imaging is, in a sense, &quot;radiology done inside out&quot;, because it records radiation emitted from within the body rather than radiation that is transmitted through the body from external sources like X-ray generators. In addition, nuclear medicine scans differ from radiology, as the emphasis is not on imaging anatomy, but on the function. For such reason, it is called a physiological imaging modality. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans are the two most common imaging modalities in nuclear medicine.

== Diagnostic medical imaging ==

=== Diagnostic ===
In nuclear medicine imaging, radiopharmaceuticals are taken internally, for example, through inhalation, intravenously, or orally. Then, external detectors (gamma cameras) capture and form images from the radiation emitted by the radiopharmaceuticals. This process is unlike a diagnostic X-ray, where external radiation is passed through the body to form an image.

There are several techniques of diagnostic nuclear medicine.
* 2D: &quot;Scintigraphy&quot; (&quot;scint&quot;) is the use of internal radionuclides to create two-dimensional images.

* 3D: &quot;SPECT&quot; is a 3D tomographic technique that uses gamma camera data from many projections and can be reconstructed in different planes. &quot;Positron emission tomography&quot; (PET) uses coincidence detection to image functional processes.

Nuclear medicine tests differ from most other imaging modalities in that nuclear medicine scans primarily show the physiological function of the system being investigated as opposed to traditional anatomical imaging such as CT or MRI. Nuclear medicine imaging studies are generally more organ-, tissue- or disease-specific (e.g.: lungs scan, heart scan, bone scan, brain scan, tumor, infection, Parkinson etc.) than those in conventional radiology imaging, which focus on a particular section of the body (e.g.: chest X-ray, abdomen/pelvis CT scan, head CT scan, etc.). In addition, there are nuclear medicine studies that allow imaging of the whole body based on certain cellular receptors or functions. Examples are whole body PET scans or PET/CT scans, gallium scans, indium white blood cell scans, MIBG and octreotide scans.
While the ability of nuclear metabolism to image disease processes from differences in metabolism is unsurpassed, it is not unique. Certain techniques such as fMRI image tissues (particularly cerebral tissues) by blood flow and thus show metabolism. Also, contrast-enhancement techniques in both CT and MRI show regions of tissue that are handling pharmaceuticals differently, due to an inflammatory process.

Diagnostic tests in nuclear medicine exploit the way that the body handles substances differently when there is disease or pathology present. The radionuclide introduced into the body is often chemically bound to a complex that acts characteristically within the body; this is commonly known as a tracer. In the presence of disease, a tracer will often be distributed around the body and/or processed differently. For example, the ligand methylene-diphosphonate (MDP) can be preferentially taken up by bone. By chemically attaching technetium-99m to MDP, radioactivity can be transported and attached to bone via the hydroxyapatite for imaging. Any increased physiological function, such as due to a fracture in the bone, will usually mean increased concentration of the tracer. This often results in the appearance of a &quot;hot spot&quot;, which is a focal increase in radio accumulation or a general increase in radio accumulation throughout the physiological system. Some disease processes result in the exclusion of a tracer, resulting in the appearance of a &quot;cold spot&quot;. Many tracer complexes have been developed to image or treat many different organs, glands, and physiological processes.

=== Hybrid scanning techniques ===
In some centers, the nuclear medicine scans can be superimposed, using software or hybrid cameras, on images from modalities such as CT or MRI to highlight the part of the body in which the radiopharmaceutical is concentrated. This practice is often referred to as image fusion or co-registration, for example SPECT/CT and PET/CT. The fusion imaging technique in nuclear medicine provides information about the anatomy and function, which would otherwise be unavailable or would require a more invasive procedure or surgery.
=== Practical concerns in nuclear imaging ===
Although the risks of low-level radiation exposures are not well understood, a cautious approach has been universally adopted that all human radiation exposures should be kept As Low As Reasonably Practicable, &quot;ALARP&quot;. (Originally, this was known as &quot;As Low As Reasonably Achievable&quot; (ALARA), but this has changed in modern draftings of the legislation to add more emphasis on the &quot;Reasonably&quot; and less on the &quot;Achievable&quot;.)

Working with the ALARP principle, before a patient is exposed for a nuclear medicine examination, the benefit of the examination must be identified. This needs to take into account the particular circumstances of the patient in question, where appropriate. For instance, if a patient is unlikely to be able to tolerate a sufficient amount of the procedure to achieve a diagnosis, then it would be inappropriate to proceed with injecting the patient with the radioactive tracer.

When the benefit does justify the procedure, then the radiation exposure (the amount of radiation given to the patient) should also be kept &quot;ALARP&quot;. This means that the images produced in nuclear medicine should never be better than required for confident diagnosis. Giving larger radiation exposures can reduce the noise in an image and make it more photographically appealing, but if the clinical question can be answered without this level of detail, then this is inappropriate.

As a result, the radiation dose from nuclear medicine imaging varies greatly depending on the type of study. The effective radiation dose can be lower than or comparable to or can far exceed the general day-to-day environmental annual background radiation dose. Likewise, it can also be less than, in the range of, or higher than the radiation dose from an abdomen/pelvis CT scan.

Some nuclear medicine procedures require special patient preparation before the study to obtain the most accurate result. Pre-imaging preparations may include dietary preparation or the withholding of certain medications. Patients are encouraged to consult with the nuclear medicine department prior to a scan.

=== Analysis ===
The result of the nuclear medicine imaging process is a dataset comprising one or more images. In multi-image datasets the array of images may represent a time sequence (i.e. cine or movie) often called a &quot;dynamic&quot; dataset, a cardiac gated time sequence, or a spatial sequence where the gamma-camera is moved relative to the patient. SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) is the process by which images acquired from a rotating gamma-camera are reconstructed to produce an image of a &quot;slice&quot; through the patient at a particular position. A collection of parallel slices form a slice-stack, a three-dimensional representation of the distribution of radionuclide in the patient.

The nuclear medicine computer may require millions of lines of source code to provide quantitative analysis packages for each of the specific imaging techniques available in nuclear medicine.

Time sequences can be further analysed using kinetic models such as multi-compartment models or a Patlak plot.

== Interventional nuclear medicine ==

Radionuclide therapy can be used to treat conditions such as hyperthyroidism, thyroid cancer, skin cancer and blood disorders.

In nuclear medicine therapy, the radiation treatment dose is administered internally (e.g. intravenous or oral routes) or externally direct above the area to treat in form of a compound (e.g. in case of skin cancer).

The radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine therapy emit ionizing radiation that travels only a short distance, thereby minimizing unwanted side effects and damage to noninvolved organs or nearby structures. Most nuclear medicine therapies can be performed as outpatient procedures since there are few side effects from the treatment and the radiation exposure to the general public can be kept within a safe limit.

In some centers the nuclear medicine department may also use implanted capsules of isotopes (brachytherapy) to treat cancer.

== History ==
The history of nuclear medicine contains contributions from scientists across different disciplines in physics, chemistry, engineering, and medicine. The multidisciplinary nature of nuclear medicine makes it difficult for medical historians to determine the birthdate of nuclear medicine. This can probably be best placed between the discovery of artificial radioactivity in 1934 and the production of radionuclides by Oak Ridge National Laboratory for medicine-related use, in 1946.

The origins of this medical idea date back as far as the mid-1920s in Freiburg, Germany, when George de Hevesy made experiments with radionuclides administered to rats, thus displaying metabolic pathways of these substances and establishing the tracer principle. Possibly, the genesis of this medical field took place in 1936, when John Lawrence, known as &quot;the father of nuclear medicine&quot;, took a leave of absence from his faculty position at Yale Medical School, to visit his brother Ernest Lawrence at his new radiation laboratory (now known as the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) in Berkeley, California. Later on, John Lawrence made the first application in patients of an artificial radionuclide when he used phosphorus-32 to treat leukemia.

Many historians consider the discovery of artificially produced radionuclides by Frédéric Joliot-Curie and Irène Joliot-Curie in 1934 as the most significant milestone in nuclear medicine. In February 1934, they reported the first artificial production of radioactive material in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, after discovering radioactivity in aluminum foil that was irradiated with a polonium preparation. Their work built upon earlier discoveries by Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen for X-ray, Henri Becquerel for radioactive uranium salts, and Marie Curie (mother of Irène Curie) for radioactive thorium, polonium and coining the term &quot;radioactivity.&quot; Taro Takemi studied the application of nuclear physics to medicine in the 1930s. The history of nuclear medicine will not be complete without mentioning these early pioneers.

Nuclear medicine gained public recognition as a potential specialty when on May 11, 1946, an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) by Massachusetts General Hospital&#x27;s Dr. Saul Hertz and Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s Dr. Arthur Roberts, described the successful use of treating Graves&#x27; Disease with radioactive iodine (RAI) was published. Additionally, Sam Seidlin. brought further development in the field describing a successful treatment of a patient with thyroid cancer metastases using radioiodine (I-131). These articles are considered by many historians as the most important articles ever published in nuclear medicine. Although the earliest use of I-131 was devoted to therapy of thyroid cancer, its use was later expanded to include imaging of the thyroid gland, quantification of the thyroid function, and therapy for hyperthyroidism. Among the many radionuclides that were discovered for medical-use, none were as important as the discovery and development of Technetium-99m. It was first discovered in 1937 by C. Perrier and E. Segre as an artificial element to fill space number 43 in the Periodic Table. The development of a generator system to produce Technetium-99m in the 1960s became a practical method for medical use. Today, Technetium-99m is the most utilized element in nuclear medicine and is employed in a wide variety of nuclear medicine imaging studies.

Widespread clinical use of nuclear medicine began in the early 1950s, as knowledge expanded about radionuclides, detection of radioactivity, and using certain radionuclides to trace biochemical processes. Pioneering works by Benedict Cassen in developing the first rectilinear scanner and Hal O. Anger&#x27;s scintillation camera (Anger camera) broadened the young discipline of nuclear medicine into a full-fledged medical imaging specialty.

By the early 1960s, in southern Scandinavia, Niels A. Lassen, David H. Ingvar, and Erik Skinhøj developed techniques that provided the first blood flow maps of the brain, which initially involved xenon-133 inhalation; an intra-arterial equivalent was developed soon after, enabling measurement of the local distribution of cerebral activity for patients with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Later versions would have 254 scintillators so a two-dimensional image could be produced on a color monitor. It allowed them to construct images reflecting brain activation from speaking, reading, visual or auditory perception and voluntary movement. The technique was also used to investigate, e.g., imagined sequential movements, mental calculation and mental spatial navigation.

By the 1970s most organs of the body could be visualized using nuclear medicine procedures. In 1971, American Medical Association officially recognized nuclear medicine as a medical specialty. In 1972, the American Board of Nuclear Medicine was established, and in 1974, the American Osteopathic Board of Nuclear Medicine was established, cementing nuclear medicine as a stand-alone medical specialty.

In the 1980s, radiopharmaceuticals were designed for use in diagnosis of heart disease. The development of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), around the same time, led to three-dimensional reconstruction of the heart and establishment of the field of nuclear cardiology.

More recent developments in nuclear medicine include the invention of the first positron emission tomography scanner (PET). The concept of emission and transmission tomography, later developed into single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), was introduced by David E. Kuhl and Roy Edwards in the late 1950s. Their work led to the design and construction of several tomographic instruments at the University of Pennsylvania. Tomographic imaging techniques were further developed at the Washington University School of Medicine. These innovations led to fusion imaging with SPECT and CT by Bruce Hasegawa from University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and the first PET/CT prototype by D. W. Townsend from University of Pittsburgh in 1998.

PET and PET/CT imaging experienced slower growth in its early years owing to the cost of the modality and the requirement for an on-site or nearby cyclotron. However, an administrative decision to approve medical reimbursement of limited PET and PET/CT applications in oncology has led to phenomenal growth and widespread acceptance over the last few years, which also was facilitated by establishing 18F-labelled tracers for standard procedures, allowing work at non-cyclotron-equipped sites. PET/CT imaging is now an integral part of oncology for diagnosis, staging and treatment monitoring. A fully integrated MRI/PET scanner is on the market from early 2011.

== Sources of radionuclides ==

99mTc is normally supplied to hospitals through a radionuclide generator containing the parent radionuclide molybdenum-99. 99Mo is typically obtained as a fission product of 235U in nuclear reactors, however global supply shortages have led to the exploration of other methods of production. About a third of the world&#x27;s supply, and most of Europe&#x27;s supply, of medical isotopes is produced at the Petten nuclear reactor in the Netherlands. Another third of the world&#x27;s supply, and most of North America&#x27;s supply, was produced at the Chalk River Laboratories in Chalk River, Ontario, Canada until its permanent shutdown in 2018.

The most commonly used radioisotope in PET, 18F, is not produced in a nuclear reactor, but rather in a circular accelerator called a cyclotron. The cyclotron is used to accelerate protons to bombard the stable heavy isotope of oxygen 18O. The 18O constitutes about 0.20% of ordinary oxygen (mostly oxygen-16), from which it is extracted. The 18F is then typically used to make FDG.

A typical nuclear medicine study involves administration of a radionuclide into the body by intravenous injection in liquid or aggregate form, ingestion while combined with food, inhalation as a gas or aerosol, or rarely, injection of a radionuclide that has undergone micro-encapsulation. Some studies require the labeling of a patient&#x27;s own blood cells with a radionuclide (leukocyte scintigraphy and red blood cell scintigraphy). Most diagnostic radionuclides emit gamma rays either directly from their decay or indirectly through electron–positron annihilation, while the cell-damaging properties of beta particles are used in therapeutic applications. Refined radionuclides for use in nuclear medicine are derived from fission or fusion processes in nuclear reactors, which produce radionuclides with longer half-lives, or cyclotrons, which produce radionuclides with shorter half-lives, or take advantage of natural decay processes in dedicated generators, i.e. molybdenum/technetium or strontium/rubidium.

The most commonly used intravenous radionuclides are technetium-99m, iodine-123, iodine-131, thallium-201, gallium-67, fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose, and indium-111 labeled leukocytes. The most commonly used gaseous/aerosol radionuclides are xenon-133, krypton-81m, (aerosolised) technetium-99m.

== Policies and procedures ==

===Radiation dose===
A patient undergoing a nuclear medicine procedure will receive a radiation dose. Under present international guidelines it is assumed that any radiation dose, however small, presents a risk. The radiation dose delivered to a patient in a nuclear medicine investigation, though unproven, is generally accepted to present a very small risk of inducing cancer. In this respect it is similar to the risk from X-ray investigations except that the dose is delivered internally rather than from an external source such as an X-ray machine, and dosage amounts are typically significantly higher than those of X-rays.

The radiation dose from a nuclear medicine investigation is expressed as an effective dose with units of sieverts (usually given in millisieverts, mSv). The effective dose resulting from an investigation is influenced by the amount of radioactivity administered in megabecquerels (MBq), the physical properties of the radiopharmaceutical used, its distribution in the body and its rate of clearance from the body.

Effective doses can range from 6 μSv (0.006 mSv) for a 3 MBq chromium-51 EDTA measurement of glomerular filtration rate to 11.2 mSv (11,200 μSv) for an 80 MBq thallium-201 myocardial imaging procedure. The common bone scan with 600 MBq of technetium-99m MDP has an effective dose of approximately 2.9 mSv (2,900 μSv).

Formerly, units of measurement were:
*the curie (Ci), equal to 3.7 × 1010 Bq, and also equal to 1.0 grams of radium (Ra-226);
*the rad (radiation absorbed dose), now replaced by the gray; and
* the rem (Röntgen equivalent man), now replaced by the sievert.
The rad and rem are essentially equivalent for almost all nuclear medicine procedures, and only alpha radiation will produce a higher Rem or Sv value, due to its much higher Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE). Alpha emitters are nowadays rarely used in nuclear medicine, but were used extensively before the advent of nuclear reactor and accelerator produced radionuclides. The concepts involved in radiation exposure to humans are covered by the field of Health Physics; the development and practice of safe and effective nuclear medicinal techniques is a key focus of Medical Physics.

=== Regulatory frameworks and guidelines ===
Different countries around the world maintain regulatory frameworks that are responsible for the management and use of radionuclides in different medical settings. For example, in the US, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have guidelines in place for hospitals to follow. With the NRC, if radioactive materials aren&#x27;t involved, like X-rays for example, they are not regulated by the agency and instead are regulated by the individual states. International organizations, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), have regularly published different articles and guidelines for best practices in nuclear medicine as well as reporting on emerging technologies in nuclear medicine. Other factors that are considered in nuclear medicine include a patient&#x27;s medical history as well as post-treatment management. Groups like International Commission on Radiological Protection have published information on how to manage the release of patients from a hospital with unsealed radionuclides.

<text>Celestus is a genus of diploglossid lizards mostly endemic to Jamaica (aside from a single species endemic to Haiti) and containing about 11 species, though three of these may be extinct. They are commonly known as galliwasps although the origin of this name is unclear. Formerly, this genus had more than 31 species, but a 2021 phylogenetic study found this classification to be paraphyletic and split those species into their own genera. A more recent study found that several ecomorphs exist on Jamaica including a swamp ecomorph, a tree ecomorph, and a ground ecomorph. 

==Species==
*&quot;Celestus barbouri&quot; – limestone forest galliwasp
*&quot;Celestus crusculus&quot; – Jamaican forest galliwasp
*&quot;Celestus duquesneyi&quot; – blue-tailed forest galliwasp
*&quot;Celestus fowleri&quot; – bromeliad forest galliwasp
*&quot;Celestus hewardi&quot; – red-spotted forest galliwasp
*&quot;Celestus macrolepis&quot; – large-scaled forest galliwasp (possibly extinct) 
*&quot;Celestus macrotus&quot; – La Selle forest galliwasp
*&quot;Celestus microblepharis&quot; – small-eyed forest galliwasp
*&quot;Celestus molesworthi&quot; – Portland Coast forest galliwasp
*&quot;Celestus occiduus&quot; – Jamaican giant galliwasp (possibly extinct)
*&quot;Celestus striatus&quot; – golden forest galliwasp (possibly extinct) 

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: a binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Celestus&quot;.

<text>Abronia is a genus of lizards, known colloquially as alligator lizards, in the family Anguidae that is native to Mexico and Central America. The majority of the species are restricted to southern Mexico and Guatemala, but members of the genus occur as far south as Panama. They inhabit forests and woodlands, mostly in highlands, and some species are often associated with bromeliads. They are typically arboreal, but there are also terrestrial &quot;Abronia&quot; species. Many species are considered threatened due to habitat loss, killing by locals who mistakenly believe they are venomous, or collection for the captive reptile trade (they are listed on CITES, which restricts international trade). They feed on small animal prey, such as insects, and the females give birth to live young (rather than lay eggs).

These medium-sized to fairly large lizards (maximum length generally up to about ) possess intriguing physical traits such as long prehensile tails that can be regrown if lost, keeled body scales, and a helmet-like structure on the top of the head, which in some species, for example &quot;A. lythrochila&quot;, has spikes towards the rear. Their colors also vary significantly depending on species, including green, bluish-green, brown, yellowish, whitish, gray and black, and some have contrasting mottled or banded patterns.

<text>Gerrhonotus is a genus of anguid lizards that are commonly referred to as alligator lizards, due to a vague resemblance to an alligator. Most species are restricted to Mexico, but a few range into Guatemala or Texas, and &quot;G. rhombifer&quot; is from Costa Rica and Panama. Along with glass lizards (&quot;Ophisaurus&quot;) and many other lizards, alligator lizards have the ability to regrow their tail. 
==Species and subspecies==
There are nine recognized species in the genus &quot;Gerrhonotus&quot;. One species has recognized subspecies.

*&quot;Gerrhonotus farri&quot; – alligator lizard
*&quot;Gerrhonotus infernalis&quot; – Texas alligator lizard
*&quot;Gerrhonotus lazcanoi&quot; 
*&quot;Gerrhonotus liocephalus&quot; – smooth-headed alligator lizard, Texas alligator lizard, Wiegmann&#x27;s alligator lizard
**&quot;Gerrhonotus liocephalus austrinus&quot;

<text>Xantusia () is one of three genera of night lizards (family Xantusiidae). Species of &quot;Xantusia&quot; are small to medium-sized, viviparous (live-bearing) lizards found in the U.S. Southwest and in northern Mexico. 
These lizards display morphological adaptations to specific microhabitats. They occupy rock crevices and decaying plants. Rock dwellers generally have brighter coloration, longer limbs and digits, and larger size than plant dwellers, which are generally duller, smaller, and have shorter limbs. 

Species of the genus &quot;Xantusia&quot; are remarkably disjunct, with populations scattered throughout the deserts and mountains of the far western borderlands with only a handful of recorded cases of interspecific allopatry. The genus contains at least seven distinct cases of morphological convergence to the rock dwelling ecomorph in Arizona, California, Baja California, and Central Mexico.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The names and descriptions of the genus &quot;Xantusia&quot; and the type species &quot;X. vigilis&quot; were published in 1859 by Spencer Fullerton Baird, the generic name commemorating the naturalist John Xantus.

Based on the most current phylogenetic analyses of Xantusiid lizards, The earliest-diverging species of the genus is &quot;Xantusia riversiana&quot;. Sister to this species are two clades: the &quot;X. vigilis&quot; species complex, and the southern &quot;Xantusia&quot;. The &quot;X. vigilis&quot; species complex is made up of &quot;X. vigilis&quot;, &quot;X. arizonae&quot;, &quot;X. sierrae&quot;, &quot;X. bezyi&quot;, &quot;X. wigginsi&quot;, and its most recent addition &quot;X. jaycolei&quot;. The Southern &quot;Xantusia&quot; contains &quot;X. gilberti&quot;, &quot;X. sherbrookii&quot;, &quot;X. gracilis&quot;, &quot;X. henshawi&quot;, &quot;X. bolsonae&quot;, &quot;X. extorris&quot;, and &quot;X. sanchezi&quot;.

==Species==
The following is a list of species in the genus.
*&quot;Xantusia arizonae&quot; – Arizona night lizard
*&quot;Xantusia bezyi&quot; – Bezy&#x27;s night lizard
*&quot;Xantusia bolsonae&quot; – bolsón night lizard
*&quot;Xantusia extorris&quot; – Durango night lizard
*&quot;Xantusia gilberti&quot; – Gilbert&#x27;s night lizard
*&quot;Xantusia gracilis&quot; – sandstone night lizard
*&quot;Xantusia henshawi&quot; – granite night lizard
*&quot;Xantusia jaycolei&quot; 
*&quot;Xantusia riversiana&quot; – island night lizard
*&quot;Xantusia sanchezi&quot; – Sanchez&#x27;s night lizard
*&quot;Xantusia sherbrookei&quot; 
*&quot;Xantusia sierrae&quot; – sierra night lizard
*&quot;Xantusia vigilis&quot; – desert night lizard
*&quot;Xantusia wigginsi&quot; – Wiggins&#x27;s desert night lizard

<text>The desert plated lizard (Gerrhosaurus skoogi) is a reptile species endemic to the northern Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. Also known as the sand plated lizard, it is diurnal.

==Etymology==
The specific name, &quot;skoogi&quot;, is in honor of Hilmer Nils Erik Skoog (1870–1927), who was Curator of the &quot;Götesborgs Naturhistoriska museum&quot; from 1904 to 1927.

==Taxonomy==
In 1916 Andersson described this lizard as a new species, naming it &quot;Gerrhosaurus skoogi&quot;. In 1953 FitzSimons assigned the species to a new genus &quot;Angolosaurus&quot;. Recent studies suggest that this monotypic genus is synonymous to &quot;Gerrhosaurus&quot; and makes it paraphyletic; therefore &quot;A. skoogi&quot; was reclassified as &quot;Gerrhosaurus skoogi&quot;.

<doc id="347864" wikidata="Q1455927" url="?curid=347864" title="Personal prelature">
<text>A personal prelature is a canonical structure of the Catholic Church which comprises clergy and laity under the jurisdiction of a prelate who undertake specific pastoral activities. Along with dioceses and military ordinariates, personal prelatures, were originally under the administration of the Vatican&#x27;s Congregation for Bishops, but since 4 August 2022, personal prelatures have been placed in the Dicastery for the Clergy. Unlike dioceses, which cover territories, personal prelatures—like military ordinariates—minister to persons as regards some objectives regardless of where they live.
The first personal prelature is Opus Dei. 

== Origins ==

In the Catholic Church, the personal prelature was conceived during the sessions of the Second Vatican Council in no. 10 of the decree &quot;Presbyterorum ordinis&quot; and was later enacted into law by Paul VI in his &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Ecclesiae sanctae&quot;. The institution was later reaffirmed in the 1983 Code of Canon Law.

==Nature==

A personal prelature is an institution having clergy and lay members which carry out specific pastoral activities. 
The adjective &quot;personal&quot; refers to the fact that, in contrast with previous canonical use for ecclesiastical institutions, the jurisdiction of the prelate is not linked to a territory but over persons wherever they happen to be. The establishment of personal prelatures is an exercise of the theologically inherent power of self-organization which the Church has to pursue its mission, though a personal prelature is not a particular church as dioceses and eparchies are.

==Structure==
A personal prelature is an ordinary jurisdictional structure of the Catholic Church. The prelate is a presbyter nominated by the Pope and governs the prelature with ordinary power. In order to de-emphasize the importance of hierarchy in the governance of the personal prelature Pope Francis decreed in 2022 that the prelate should not be consecrated bishop. 

The prelate has the right to erect a national or international seminary, and to promote students to holy orders, in service to the pastoral mission of the prelature (can. 295).

The lay faithful of a prelature are &quot;determined by a personal criteria&quot;, which is established in each case by the Apostolic See, in the constitutional documents of the prelature, or in its statutes. Diverse organizational models are possible, according to a variety of possible missions: for example, the determination &quot;a iure&quot; of those lay faithful for whom the pastoral mission is intended, or the express &quot;inscription in an apposite register&quot;, as is the case in other personal ecclesiastical circumscriptions. It is also possible that, through a &quot;mutual agreement or convention&quot;, lay faithful can pursue the specific mission of the prelature in organic cooperation with the prelate and his presbyterium, by the terms established in its statutes (can. 296). The fact that these lay persons are under the jurisdiction of the prelate does not impede their being under the authority of the diocesan bishop or pertaining to other ecclesiastical jurisdictions (accumulative jurisdiction).

The statutes likewise are to define the relations of the personal prelature with the diocesan bishops in whose dioceses the prelature exercises its pastoral or missionary works (can. 297).

==Application==

===Opus Dei===
The first, and thus far the only, personal prelature is Opus Dei, which was established as a personal prelature by Pope John Paul II in 1982 through the Apostolic constitution &quot;Ut sit&quot;. In the case of Opus Dei, the prelate is elected by members of the prelature and confirmed by the Pope.

According to John Paul II, the priests and lay faithful (both men and women) in the Prelature of the Holy Cross are &quot;the components by which the Prelature is organically structured.&quot; According to the website Prelaturas Personales.

===Other possible personal prelatures===

Philippine clergy proposes personal prelatures for the pastoral care of Filipino migrants. This canonical set-up can help the Filipino migrants integrate better into their local church and help spread best practices in integration from other places where Filipinos have migrated. A prelature rather than an ordinariate can better serve the purpose since it will not have to provide all the pastoral services and the migrants will continue to be faithful of their specific dioceses. 

The Society of Saint Pius X has been offered a canonical restructuring as a personal prelature by Rome.

== Related structures: personal ordinariate and apostolic administration ==
On October 20, 2009, it was announced that the Holy See would create personal ordinariates for Anglicans entering the Catholic Church, a formula inspired by existing military ordinariates, in ways that are comparable to the current Opus Dei personal prelature. A major difference between an ordinariate and a prelature is the ordinariates (both personal and military) may erect parishes and those who inscribe themselves in the apposite register effectively become transients in their geographic diocese (no accumulative membership). The personal ordinariates for former Anglicans were also authorized to use a unique liturgy developed by the CDF and CDW.
Three are established: Our Lady of the Southern Cross for Australia and Japan, Our Lady of Walsingham for England and Wales, The Chair of Saint Peter for USA and Canada.

Another, unique prelature is the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney in Brazil, for the Tridentine Use.

<doc id="347892" wikidata="Q497896" url="?curid=347892" title="Iphisa">
<text>Iphisa is a genus of the lizard family Gymnophthalmidae. The genus is monotypic, meaning that it has only one species, Iphisa elegans, and its common name is the glossy shade lizard. &quot;I. elegans&quot; is native to the Amazon and is typically found in regions of South America, centrally located in the Amazon Basin. The average body length of the glossy shade lizard is 55 mm. Relatively small, these lizards rely on running as their primary form of movement and, interestingly, exhibit death-feigning behavior, which aids in protection from potential predators.

== History ==
The name &quot;Iphisa elegans&quot; stems from the root &quot;Iphis-,&quot; which is associated with many individuals from Greek mythology. Namely, from Ovid&#x27;s Metamorphoses narrative poem, Iphis, the daughter of Telethusa and Ligdus, was raised as a man by her mother such that her true gender could be hidden from her father, who wanted a son to carry on their family&#x27;s farming legacy. The goddess Isis transformed Iphis into a man, and Iphis ended up marrying Ianthe.

In 1851, Gray diagnosed Iphisadae as a family; however, as the Iphisadae spelling is not in prevailing usage, it has been corrected to Iphisadae. This was then shortened to &quot;Iphisa,&quot; as is the monotypic genus of this species.

===Genome===
Iphisa is part of the Squamata order, which is the largest order of reptiles. The Iphisa genome is 18,622 base pairs long, it has 12 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA proteins, and 22 tRNA proteins.

== Physical characteristics ==
The body of the glossy shade lizard is compressed dorsoventrally, giving the lizard its elongated shape. The average body length is 55 mm; however, the length of &quot;I. elegans&quot; can reach a maximum of 62 mm. Adult glossy shade lizards exhibit sexual dichromatism as they appear antique-brown to dark yellow on their dorsal surface. The abdomen of females is a creamy grey color and the abdomen of males is an orange color. The orange color is thought to be related to the hormonal cycles of breeding males, yet more studies need to be conducted to observe if this difference in coloration offers any anti-predation advantage. Sexual dichromatism is a term that accounts for the difference in the coloration between the two sexes, between the males and the females. This can have implications on dominance and reproduction within the species. There are two longitudinal rows of scales on the dorsal side of the lizard as well as two longitudinal rows of scales on the ventral side of the lizard. As the lateral scales are smaller than the dorsal and ventral scales, each lateral side of the lizard is composed of three to five longitudinal rows of scales, with ninety percent of glossy shade lizards having four longitudinal rows of lateral scales on each side.

&quot;I. elegans&quot; has a vestigial inner finger, which means that it poses no true function and just exists as part of the lizard&#x27;s body. It also has claws, but these claws are not really visible. This can give the glossy shade lizard an advantage in protecting itself from predators since it can use its claws as weapons while the predator approaches, unsuspecting of any self-defense mechanism that &quot;I. elegans&quot; possesses. Moving more cranially, the glossy shade lizard has a lower eyelid with a transparent window, and the tympanic membrane (or ear drum) in its ear is exposed outwards. The tympanic membrane is a cavity that separates the inner ear from the outer ear. Auditory vibrations hit the tympanic membrane, which allow for sound to be heard and processed.

Although this species covers a large geographical range across the Amazon rainforest, Iphisa mostly has a broadly conserved external morphology. For this species, however, there is a lot of variation in the hemipenial morphotypes in males. This reinforces the fact that Iphisa is a cryptic species – there are high degrees of genetic and morphological differences across the lizards even though there are many instances of sympatry among the mtDNA lineages of these lizards.

== Habitat and distribution ==
Found in the Neotropics, &quot;I. elegans&quot; originates in South America. For a long time, Iphisa has been known to inhabit the amazon basins of Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Columbia, Brazil, and Guiana Shield. Recent studies, however, have found evidence that the distribution of Iphisa is more extensive. Research has confirmed the presence of Iphisa in 10 additional locations in the North and Southwest of the state of Mato Grosso.

The population trend for the glossy shade lizard is currently stable, meaning that there is relatively the same number of &quot;I. elegans&quot; continuously as the population size is neither increasing nor decreasing. Being at a stable population state can be viewed positively since there are no harsh or immediate threats that threaten the status of the species or risk it going extinct.

The habitat in which &quot;I. elegans&quot; resides is a terrestrial one, meaning that they live on land. Terrestrial habitats can include forests, grasslands, deserts, shorelines, and wetlands. Animals that live in terrestrial habitats are influenced by the moisture in the area (i.e., the moisture that builds from rain or snow falling), the cold temperatures in the winter season, the frequency at which the land floods with water, and the nutrients present in the soil. The Neotropics specifically encompasses two lowland deserts, a high-altitude inland desert, and the coastal deserts of Atacama and Sechura, which, together, form a long arid continuum in South America. Nevertheless, in contrast to these drier habitats, the glossy shade lizard can find its home in tropical rainforests that are either completely undisturbed or moderately disturbed. They can also be found at the borders of flooded tropical rainforests or, for example, near a creek. An ecomorphological guild is a group of organisms that adapt to similar environments and ecological roles in nature, thereby causing them to share morphological traits. &quot;I. elegans&quot; is a part of the fossorial and/or ground dwelling only ecomorphological guild, implying that this species spends most of its time either underground or on the ground. Fossorial is a description that essentially illustrates the action of digging and burrowing.

A vital part of the glossy shade lizard&#x27;s habitat consists of leaf litter, which is a combination of leaves, twigs, and fallen bark that compose healthy soil. When leaf litter is decomposed, healthy nutrients are absorbed into the soil, which aid in keeping the soil moist. Furthermore, leaf litter is beneficial in that it can also serve as hiding spots and/or protection from any predators. Given the relatively small size of &quot;I. elegans&quot;, it is able to hide and take shelter among leaf litter, making this part of the lizard&#x27;s habitat very advantageous.

== Reproduction ==
&quot;I. elegans&quot; sexually reproduces, meaning that the sperm from the male parent fertilizes the egg of the female parent to form the offspring. The sperm and the egg are two gametes that come together and form the zygote. This zygote and later becomes a mature lizard. Glossy shade lizards are oviparous animals. This signifies that they are animals that lay eggs and that their offspring hatch from the eggs after coming out of the mother&#x27;s body. This species of lizard produces around one litter in a year.

== Predator and prey ==
Predators of &quot;I. elegans&quot; include reptiles—particularly snakes and other lizards—as well as birds like hawks. The small size of the glossy shade lizard aids can have benefits for the predators as it makes it easier to grab and kill the prey.

&quot;I. elegans&quot; are diurnal carnivores. As carnivores, they eat meat and their diet chiefly consists of other animals. This is in contrast to the herbivore and omnivore diets, which consist more of leafy plants. Herbivores are animals that strictly only eat plants, and omnivores are animals who have a diet in between herbivores and carnivores as omnivores eat both plants and animals.

== Foraging ==
Iphisa is a species with diurnal habits. This means that these lizards tend to forage just below the top layer of leaves that cover the forest floor.

== Behavior ==

=== General ===
The behavior of the glossy shade lizard is quite unique, as it is rather difficult to observe the behavior and actions of this species of lizard. Its behavior is cryptic as the glossy shade lizard moves quickly on the ground. The cryptic behavior of this lizard species limits the amount of information there currently is regarding its behavior as it easily evades observation. However, another main behavior of &quot;I. elegans&quot; is its attempt to escape. Upon noticing any disturbance in their surrounding environment, &quot;I. elegans&quot; is able to quickly dart into leaf litter and seek hiding and protection there. Since these lizards are diurnal, they are primarily active during the daytime and more inactive in the nighttime. Additionally, the glossy shade lizard is an active forager, which is a term used to describe an individual that obtains food resources by actively searching for and obtaining them.
=== Death-feigning ===
This is also known as thanatosis, and it is said that death-feigning behavior is only stimulated in the glossy shade lizard when its cryptic behavior or its escape attempt fails. Many animals engage in a death-feigning posture when they are under threat. This is often done to avoid predation from carnivores who eat live animals. If an animal appears dead, the animal is less likely to be eaten or attacked by a predator. Especially as hawks are a common predator of the glossy shade lizard, when hawks are flying above in the sky, if an animal appears dead below, they will not waste their energy to swoop down, land, and then eat the dead animal. This does not satisfy the cost-benefit analysis for the hawk, as it is more costly to expend wasteful energy as there is no benefit of prey since the animal is already &quot;dead.&quot; Thus, the death-feigning behavior, which &quot;I. elegans&quot; exhibits, is a successful form of protection from predators. This posture, as seen in the image on the right, is held by the lizard turning their venter, or abdomen, up. The image on the right depicts the death-feigning posture of a male glossy shade lizard because the abdomen is orange in color. It is also found that &quot;I. elegans&quot; do not relax from this death-feigning posture until they are sure that the dangerous threat has been cleared and that they are once again safe. In the 2015 Machado-Filho et al. study, the glossy tailed lizard assumed the death-feigning posture as it was lifted up off of the ground and only returned back to its normal posture once it was placed safely back onto the ground.

<text>The Mortara case () was an Italian cause célèbre that captured the attention of much of Europe and North America in the 1850s and 1860s. It concerned the Papal States&#x27; seizure of a six-year-old boy named Edgardo Mortara from his Jewish family in Bologna, on the basis of a former servant&#x27;s testimony that she had administered an emergency baptism to the boy when he fell ill as an infant. Mortara grew up as a Catholic under the protection of Pope Pius IX, who refused his parents&#x27; desperate pleas for his return. Mortara eventually became a priest. The domestic and international outrage against the Pontifical State&#x27;s actions contributed to its downfall amid the unification of Italy.

In late 1857, Bologna&#x27;s inquisitor, Father Pier Feletti, heard that Anna Morisi, who had worked in the Mortara house for six years, had secretly baptised Edgardo when she had thought he was about to die as a baby. The Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition held the view that the action irrevocably made the child a Catholic and, because the law of the Papal States forbade the raising of Christians by members of other faiths, it ordered that he be taken from his family and brought up by the Church. Police went to the Mortara home late on 23 June 1858, and took custody of Edgardo the following evening.

After the child&#x27;s father was allowed to visit him during August and September 1858, two starkly different narratives emerged: one told of a boy who wanted to return to his family and the faith of his ancestors, while the other described a child who had learned the catechism perfectly and wanted his parents to become Catholics as well. International protests mounted, but the Pope would not be moved. After pontifical rule in Bologna ended in 1859, Feletti was prosecuted for his role in Mortara&#x27;s kidnapping, but he was acquitted when the court decided that he had not acted on his own initiative. With the Pope as a substitute father, Mortara trained for the priesthood in Rome until the Kingdom of Italy captured the city in 1870, ending the existence of the Papal States. Leaving the country, Mortara was ordained in France three years later, at the age of 21. He spent most of his life outside Italy and died in Belgium in 1940, aged 88.

Several historians highlight the affair as one of the most significant events in Pius IX&#x27;s papacy, and they juxtapose his handling of it in 1858 with the loss of most of his territory a year later. The case notably altered the policy of the French Emperor Napoleon III, who shifted from opposing the movement for Italian unification to actively supporting it. The traditional Italian historiography of the country&#x27;s unification does not give much prominence to the Mortara case which, by the late 20th century, was mostly remembered by Jewish scholars. A 1997 study by the American historian David Kertzer has marked the start of a wider re-examination of it.

==Background==
===Political context===

For more than a millennium, starting around 754, the Papal States were territories in Italy under the direct and sovereign rule of the Pope. The Catholic Church&#x27;s control over Rome and a neighbouring swathe of central Italy was generally seen as a manifestation of the Pope&#x27;s secular, &quot;temporal&quot; power, as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy.

After the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the other main Italian states were the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in the west, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in the south, and the Kingdom of Sardinia (governed from Piedmont, on the mainland). The French occupation during the 1790s and early 1800s had greatly increased the Pope&#x27;s popularity and spiritual authority, but had also severely damaged the geopolitical credibility of the Papal States. The historian David Kertzer suggests that, by the 1850s, &quot;what had once appeared so solid – a product of the divine order of things – now seemed terribly fragile&quot;.

Pope Pius IX, elected in 1846, was initially widely seen as a great reformer and moderniser, who might throw his weight behind the growing movement for unification of Italy – referred to in Italian as the Risorgimento (meaning &quot;Resurgence&quot;). When the revolutions of 1848 broke out, however, he refused to support a pan-Italian campaign against the Austrian Empire, which controlled Lombardy–Venetia in the north-east. That triggered a popular uprising in the Papal States, Pope Pius&#x27;s flight to Gaeta, then belonging to the Two Sicilies, and the proclamation in 1849 of the short-lived Roman Republic, which was crushed by Austrian and French intervention in support of the Pope. Rome was thereafter guarded by French troops, and Austrians garrisoned the rest of the Papal States, much to the resentment of most of the inhabitants. Pope Pius shared the traditional pontifical view that the Papal States were essential to his independence as head of the Catholic Church. He regained some of his popularity during the 1850s, but the drive for Italian unification, spearheaded by the Kingdom of Sardinia, continued to unsettle him.

The Jews of the Papal States, numbering 15,000 or so in 1858, were grateful to Pope Pius IX because he had ended the long-standing legal obligation for them to attend sermons in church four times a year, based on that week&#x27;s Torah portion and aimed at their conversion to Christianity. On 17 April 1848, he had also torn down the gates of the Roman Ghetto, despite the objections of many Christians. However, Jews continued to be subject to many restrictions and the vast majority still lived in the ghetto. After returning from exile in 1850, during which the Roman Republic had issued sharp anti-Church measures, the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the Ghetto.

===Mortara and Morisi===
Edgardo Levi Mortara, the sixth of eight children born to Salomone &quot;Momolo&quot; Mortara, a Jewish merchant, and his wife Marianna (&quot;née&quot; Padovani), was born on 27 August 1851 in Bologna, one of the Papal Legations in the far north of the pontifical state. In 1850, the family had moved from the Duchy of Modena, just west of Bologna. Bologna&#x27;s Jewish population of about 900 had been expelled in 1593 by Pope Clement VIII. Some Jews, mostly merchants like Edgardo&#x27;s father, had started to settle in Bologna again during the 1790s and, by 1858, there was a Jewish community of about 200 in the city. The Jews of Bologna practised Judaism discreetly, with neither a rabbi nor a synagogue. The Papal States officially forbade them to have Christian servants, but observant Jewish families perceived gentile maids as essential because they were not covered by Jewish laws, and thus provided a way for Jews to have household tasks carried out while still observing their Sabbath. In practice, Church authorities turned a blind eye, and almost every Jewish family in Bologna employed at least one Catholic woman.

A few months after Edgardo&#x27;s birth, the Mortara family engaged a new servant: Anna &quot;Nina&quot; Morisi, a 14-year-old Catholic from the nearby village of San Giovanni in Persiceto. Like all her family and friends, Morisi was illiterate. She had come to the city following her three sisters, to work and save money towards a dowry so she could eventually marry. In early 1855, Morisi became pregnant, which was not uncommon for unmarried servants in Bologna at that time. Many employers would simply sack girls in such situations, but the Mortaras did not. They paid for Morisi to spend the last four months of her pregnancy at a midwife&#x27;s home and deliver the child, then had her return to work with them. To protect Morisi and themselves from embarrassment, they told neighbours that their maid was sick and recuperating at home. Morisi gave her newborn baby to an orphanage, which the Papal States required unwed mothers to do, then returned to work with the Mortaras. She remained there until she was hired by another Bologna family in 1857. Soon after that, she married and moved back to San Giovanni in Persiceto.

==Removal==
===Instigation===
In October 1857, the inquisitor of Bologna, the Dominican friar Pier Gaetano Feletti, learned of rumours that a secret baptism had been administered to one of the city&#x27;s Jewish children by a Catholic servant. If true, it would make the child a Catholic in the eyes of the Church, a fact with secular as well as spiritual ramifications, since the stance of the Church was that children who it considered to be Christian could not be raised by non-Christians, and should be removed from their parents in such circumstances. Cases like that were not uncommon in 19th-century Italy, and often revolved around the baptism of a Jewish child by a Christian servant. The official Church position was that Catholics should not baptise Jewish children without the parents&#x27; consent, except if a child was on the brink of death. In those cases, the Church considered the customary deferment to parental authority was outweighed by the importance of allowing the child&#x27;s soul to be saved and go to Heaven, and permitted baptism without the parents&#x27; assent. Many Jewish families feared clandestine baptisms by their Christian maids and, to counter this perceived threat, some households required Christians leaving their employment to sign notarised statements confirming that they had never baptised any of the children.

The servant identified in the rumours was Anna Morisi. After receiving written permission to investigate from the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition (also called the Holy Office), the body of cardinals responsible for overseeing and defending Catholic doctrine, Feletti interrogated her at the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna. Morisi averred that while she was employed by the Mortaras, their infant son Edgardo had fallen gravely sick while in her care, leading her to fear that he might die. She said that she had performed an emergency baptism herself – sprinkling some water on the boy&#x27;s head and saying: &quot;I baptise you in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost&quot; – but had never revealed that to the child&#x27;s family. Edgardo had since recovered. Feletti had Morisi swear to keep the story quiet and sent a transcript of the meeting to Rome, requesting permission to remove the then six-year-old Edgardo from his family.

It is not known whether Pope Pius IX was involved in any of the early Holy Office discussions over Mortara, or was otherwise aware of Feletti&#x27;s initial investigation. He was its official head but only occasionally attended its meetings, and was not likely to have been consulted about what the cardinals saw as routine matters. For the Holy Office, situations such as that reported by Feletti presented a profound quandary – on the one hand, the Church officially disapproved of forced conversions, but on the other, it held that the baptismal sacrament was sacrosanct and that if it had been properly administered, the recipient was thereafter a member of the Christian communion. In accordance with the 1747 papal bull &quot;Postremo mense&quot;, the laws of the Papal States held that it was illegal to remove a child from non-Christian parents for baptism (unless it was dying), but if such a child was indeed baptised the Church was held to bear responsibility to provide a Christian education and remove it from its parents.

The cardinals considered Morisi&#x27;s account and ultimately accepted it as bearing &quot;all the earmarks of the truth without leaving the least doubt about the reality and the validity of the baptism she performed&quot;. Feletti was instructed to arrange Edgardo&#x27;s removal and transport to the House of Catechumens in Rome, where instruction was given to those who were newly converted or in the process of converting to Catholicism.

===Removal===
A detail of papal carabinieri (military police), led by Marshal Pietro Lucidi and Brigadier Giuseppe Agostini, arrived at the Mortara apartment in Bologna soon after sunset on 23 June 1858. After asking a few questions about the family, Lucidi announced: &quot;Signor Mortara, I am sorry to inform you that you are the victim of a betrayal&quot;, and explained that they were under orders from Feletti to remove Edgardo as he had been baptised. Marianna screamed hysterically, ran to Edgardo&#x27;s bed and shrieked that they would have to kill her before taking him. Lucidi said repeatedly that he was only following Feletti&#x27;s orders. He reported afterwards that he &quot;would have a thousand times preferred to be exposed to much more serious dangers in performing my duties than to have to witness such a painful scene&quot;.

Lucidi offered to let Edgardo&#x27;s father accompany them to the inquisitor to discuss the matter with him. Momolo refused, but Lucidi allowed him to send his eldest son, Riccardo, to summon relatives and neighbours. Marianna&#x27;s uncle Angelo Padovani, a prominent member of Bologna&#x27;s Jewish community, concluded that their only hope was to appeal to Feletti. The inquisitor received Padovani and Marianna&#x27;s brother-in-law Angelo Moscato at San Domenico soon after 23:00. Feletti said that he, like Lucidi, was merely following orders. He declined to reveal why it was thought that Edgardo had been baptised, saying that it was confidential. When the men begged him to at least give the family one last day with Edgardo, the inquisitor acquiesced, on the condition that no attempt was made to spirit the child away. He gave Padovani a note to that effect to pass on to the marshal. Lucidi left as ordered, leaving two men to stay in the Mortaras&#x27; bedroom and watch over Edgardo.

The Mortaras spent the morning of 24 June attempting to have Feletti&#x27;s order overruled by either the city&#x27;s cardinal legate, Giuseppe Milesi Pironi Ferretti, or the Archbishop of Bologna, Michele Viale-Prelà, but they found that neither was in the city. Around noon, the Mortaras decided to take steps to make the removal as painless as possible. Edgardo&#x27;s siblings were taken to visit relatives, while Marianna reluctantly agreed to spend the evening with the wife of Giuseppe Vitta, a Jewish family friend. Around 17:00, Momolo visited San Domenico to make one last plea to Feletti. The inquisitor repeated all he had said to Padovani and Moscato the previous night and told Momolo not to worry, because Edgardo would be well cared for, under the protection of the Pope himself. He warned that it would benefit no-one to make a scene when the carabinieri returned that evening.

Momolo went home to find the apartment empty, apart from Vitta, Marianna&#x27;s brother (also called Angelo Padovani), the two policemen and Edgardo himself. At about 20:00, the carabinieri arrived in two carriages – one for Lucidi and his men, and another in which Agostini would drive Edgardo. Lucidi entered the apartment and removed Edgardo from his father&#x27;s arms, prompting the two policemen who had guarded him to shed tears. Momolo followed the police down the stairs to the street, then fainted. Edgardo was passed to Agostini and driven away.

==Appeal==
===Initial appeal; Morisi confronted===

With no way of knowing where the boy had been taken (Momolo only found out in early July), the Mortaras, supported by the Jewish communities in Bologna, Rome and elsewhere in Italy, initially focused on drafting appeals and trying to rally support from Jews abroad. The greatly expanded public voice wielded by Jews in western European countries, as a result of recent moves towards increasing the freedom of the press, coupled with Jewish political emancipation in the Kingdom of Sardinia, Britain, France and the United States, caused Mortara&#x27;s removal to gain press attention far beyond anything previously given to such incidents. The papal government was initially disposed to simply ignore Momolo&#x27;s appeals, but reconsidered after newspapers began reporting on the case. The pontifical state&#x27;s many detractors seized on the episode as an example of papal tyranny.

Anxious to protect the Papal States&#x27; precarious diplomatic position, the Cardinal Secretary of State Giacomo Antonelli liaised with Rome&#x27;s Jewish community to arrange a meeting with Momolo Mortara, and received him politely in early August 1858. Antonelli promised that the matter would be referred to the Pope, and granted Momolo&#x27;s request that he be allowed to visit Edgardo regularly in the House of Catechumens. Kertzer cites Antonelli&#x27;s concession of repeated visits, as opposed to the usual single meeting, as the first sign that the Mortara case would take on a special significance.

The attempts of the Mortaras and their allies to identify who was supposed to have baptised Edgardo quickly bore fruit. After their current servant, Anna Facchini, adamantly denied any involvement, they assessed former employees and soon earmarked Morisi as a possible candidate. In late July 1858, the Mortara home was visited by Ginerva Scagliarini, a friend of Morisi&#x27;s who had once worked for Marianna&#x27;s brother-in-law Cesare De Angelis. Marianna&#x27;s brother, Angelo Padovani, tested Scagliarini by saying falsely that he had heard it was Morisi who had baptised Edgardo. The ruse worked: Scagliarini said that she had been told the same thing by Morisi&#x27;s sister Monica.

The younger Angelo Padovani went with De Angelis to confront Morisi in San Giovanni in Persiceto. Padovani recalled finding her in tears. After the visitors assured her that they meant no harm, Morisi recounted what she had told Feletti. She said that a grocer named Cesare Lepori had suggested the baptism when she mentioned Edgardo&#x27;s sickness, and had shown her how to perform it. She had not mentioned it to anyone, she went on, until soon after Edgardo&#x27;s brother Aristide died at the age of one in 1857. When a neighbour&#x27;s servant, called Regina, proposed that Morisi should have baptised Aristide, that she had done so to Edgardo &quot;slipped out of my mouth&quot;. According to Padovani, Morisi described crying during her interrogation by the inquisitor, and expressed guilt over Edgardo&#x27;s removal: &quot;figuring that it was all my fault, I was very unhappy, and still am.&quot; Morisi agreed to have that formally recorded, but was gone when Padovani and De Angelis returned after three hours with a notary and two witnesses. After searching for her in vain, they went back to Bologna with only their hearsay account of her story, which Padovani thought genuine: &quot;Her words, and her demeanour, and her tears before she could launch into her story, persuaded me that what she told me was all true.&quot;

===Two narratives===
From mid-August to mid-September 1858, Edgardo was visited by his father several times, under the supervision of the rector of the Catechumens, Enrico Sarra. The wildly divergent accounts of what happened during those encounters grew into two rival narratives of the entire case. Momolo&#x27;s version of events, favoured by the Jewish community and other backers, was that a family had been destroyed by the papal government&#x27;s religious fanaticism, that helpless Edgardo had spent the journey to Rome crying for his parents, and that the boy wanted nothing more than to return home. The narrative favoured by the Church and its supporters, and propagated in the Catholic press throughout Europe, was one of divinely ordained, soul-stirring redemption, and a child endowed with spiritual strength far beyond his years. Whereas the neophyte Edgardo had faced a life of error, followed by eternal damnation, he now stood to share in Christian salvation, and was distraught that his parents would not convert with him.

The central theme in almost all renditions of the narrative favouring the Mortara family was that of Marianna Mortara&#x27;s health. From July 1858 onwards, it was reported across Europe that, as a result of her grief, Edgardo&#x27;s mother had practically, if not actually, gone insane, and might even die. The powerful image of the heartbroken mother was stressed heavily in the family&#x27;s appeals both to the public and to Edgardo himself. Momolo and the secretary of Rome&#x27;s Jewish community, Sabatino Scazzocchio, told Edgardo that his mother&#x27;s life was at risk if he did not come back soon. When Marianna wrote to her son in August, Scazzocchio refused to deliver the letter on the grounds that, being relatively calm and reassuring in tone, it might work against the impression they were trying to give him that she was no longer herself and that only his return could save her. In January 1859, one correspondent reported: &quot;The father shows a great deal of courage, but the mother is having a hard time carrying on. ... If the Holy Father had seen this woman as I saw her, he would not have the courage to keep her son another moment.&quot;

There were many different versions of the Catholic story, but all followed the same basic structure. All had Edgardo quickly and fervently embracing Christianity and trying to learn as much as possible about it. Most described a dramatic scene of Edgardo wondering at a painting of the Virgin Mary in sorrow, either in Rome or during the journey from Bologna. Agostini, the policeman who had escorted him to Rome, reported that the boy had at first stubbornly refused to enter a church with him for Mass, but displayed an apparently miraculous transformation when he did.

A common theme was that Edgardo had become a kind of prodigy. According to an eyewitness account published in the Catholic &quot;L&#x27;armonia della religione colla civiltà&quot;, he had learned the catechism perfectly within a few days, &quot;blesse[d] the servant who baptised him&quot;, and declared that he wanted to convert all Jews to Christianity. The most influential pro-Church article on Mortara was an account published in the Jesuit periodical &quot;La Civiltà Cattolica&quot; in November 1858, and subsequently reprinted or quoted in Catholic papers across Europe. That story had the child begging the rector of the Catechumens not to send him back but to let him grow up in a Christian home, and initiated what became a central plank of the pro-Church narrative – that Edgardo had a new family, namely the Catholic Church itself. The article quoted Edgardo as saying: &quot;I am baptised; I am baptised and my father is the Pope.&quot;

According to Kertzer, the proponents of the pro-Church narrative did not seem to realise that to many those accounts sounded &quot;too good to be true&quot; and &quot;absurd&quot;. Kertzer comments: &quot;If Edgardo in fact told his father that he did not want to return with him, that he now regarded the Pope as his true father and wanted to devote his life to converting the Jews, this message seems not to have registered with Momolo.&quot; Liberals, Protestants and Jews across the continent ridiculed the reports in the Catholic press. A booklet, published in Brussels in 1859, outlined the two contrasting narratives, then concluded: &quot;Between the miracle of a six-year-old apostle who wants to convert the Jews and the cry of a child who keeps asking for his mother and his little sisters, we don&#x27;t hesitate for a moment.&quot; Mortara&#x27;s parents furiously denounced the Catholic accounts as lies, but some of their supporters were less certain about where Edgardo&#x27;s loyalties then lay. They included Scazzocchio, who had attended some of the disputed meetings at the Catechumens.

===Lepori&#x27;s denial; Morisi discredited===
Momolo returned to Bologna in late September 1858, after his two brothers-in-law wrote to him that if he stayed in Rome any longer the family might be ruined. He left Scazzocchio to represent the family&#x27;s cause in Rome. Momolo shifted his priority to attempting to undermine Morisi&#x27;s credibility, either by disproving aspects of her story or by showing her to be untrustworthy. He also resolved to confront Cesare Lepori, the grocer who Morisi said had both suggested the baptism and shown her how to perform it. Based on Morisi&#x27;s story, Lepori had already been identified by many observers as being ultimately to blame for the affair. When Momolo visited his shop in early October, Lepori vehemently denied that he had ever spoken to Morisi about Edgardo or any baptism, and said that he was prepared to testify to that effect before any legal authority. He claimed that he did not himself know how to administer baptism so, had such a conversation occurred, it could hardly have gone as Morisi described.

Carlo Maggi, a Catholic acquaintance of Momolo&#x27;s who was also a retired judge, sent a report of Lepori&#x27;s refutation to Scazzocchio, who asked Antonelli to pass it on to the Pope. A covering letter, attached to Maggi&#x27;s statement, described it as proof that Morisi&#x27;s story was false. Scazzocchio also forwarded an affidavit from the Mortara family doctor, Pasquale Saragoni, who acknowledged that Edgardo had fallen sick when he was about a year old, but stated that he had never been in danger of dying and that, in any case, Morisi had herself been bedridden at the time she was supposed to have baptised the boy. A further report sent from Bologna in October 1858, comprising the statements of eight women and one man, all Catholics, corroborated the doctor&#x27;s claims about the sicknesses of Edgardo and Morisi respectively, and alleged that the former maid was given to theft and sexual impropriety. Four women, including the servant Anna Facchini and the woman who had employed Morisi after she left the Mortaras, Elena Pignatti, claimed that Morisi had regularly flirted with Austrian officers and invited them into her employers&#x27; homes for sex.

===Alatri, then back to Rome===
Momolo set out for Rome again on 11 October 1858, bringing Marianna with him in the hope that her presence might make a stronger impression on the Church and Edgardo. Anxious about the possible consequences of a dramatic reunification between mother and son, the rector, Enrico Sarra, took Edgardo from Rome to Alatri, his own home town about away. The Mortaras tracked them to a church in Alatri where, from the door, Momolo saw a priest saying Mass, with Edgardo by his side, assisting him. Momolo waited outside and, afterwards, persuaded the rector to let him see his son. Before any meeting could take place, the Mortaras were arrested on the orders of the Mayor of Alatri, himself following a request from the town&#x27;s bishop, and despatched back to Rome. Antonelli was not impressed, considering it to be an undignified line of action that would give obvious ammunition to the Church&#x27;s detractors, and ordered Sarra to bring Edgardo back to the capital to meet his parents.

Edgardo returned to the Catechumens on 22 October, and was visited by his parents often over the next month. As with Momolo&#x27;s first round of visits, two different versions emerged of what happened. According to Edgardo&#x27;s parents, the boy was obviously intimidated by the clergymen around him and threw himself into his mother&#x27;s arms when he first saw her. Marianna later said: &quot;He had lost weight and had turned pale; his eyes were filled with terror ... I told him that he was born a Jew like us and like us he must always remain one, and he replied: &quot;Sì, mia cara mamma, I will never forget to say the &quot;Shema&quot; every day.&quot; One report in the Jewish press described the priests telling Edgardo&#x27;s parents that God had chosen their son to be &quot;the apostle of Christianity to his family, dedicated to converting his parents and his siblings&quot;, and that they could have him back if they also became Christians. The clerics and nuns then knelt and prayed for the conversion of the Mortara household, prompting Edgardo&#x27;s parents to leave in terror.

The pro-Church accounts, by contrast, described a boy very much resolved to stay where he was, and horrified by his mother&#x27;s exhortations to return to the Judaism of his ancestors. In that narrative, the main reason for the Mortaras&#x27; grief was not that their son had been taken, but that he now stood to grow up in the Christian faith. According to &quot;La Civiltà Cattolica&quot;, Marianna flew into a rage on seeing a medallion hanging from Edgardo&#x27;s neck bearing the image of the Virgin Mary, and ripped it off. One article went so far as to claim the Jewish mother had done that with the words: &quot;I&#x27;d rather see you dead than a Christian!&quot; Some of the Church&#x27;s critics had charged that by keeping Edgardo, it was violating the commandment that a child should honour his father and mother – &quot;La Civiltà Cattolica&quot; countered that Edgardo still loved his family despite their religious differences and indeed, after being taught by the priests to read and write, had chosen to write his first letter to his mother, signing it &quot;your most affectionate little son&quot;. After meeting Edgardo in Rome, Louis Veuillot, the ultramontane editor of the newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Univers&quot; and one of the Pope&#x27;s staunchest defenders, reported that the boy had told him &quot;that he loves his father and his mother, and that he will go to live with them when he is older ... so that he can speak to them of Saint Peter, of God, and of the most Holy Mary&quot;.

==Outrage==
===International scandal and political machinations===

Having made no progress in Rome, Momolo and Marianna Mortara returned to Bologna in early December 1858, and moved to Turin, in Piedmont, soon afterwards. The case, an anti-Catholic &quot;publicist&#x27;s dream&quot;, to quote Kertzer, had become a massive controversy in both Europe and the United States by then, with voices across the social spectrum clamouring for the Pope to return Edgardo to his parents. Mortara became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot;, not only for Jews but for Protestant Christians as well, particularly in the United States, where anti-Catholic sentiment abounded. &quot;The New York Times&quot; published more than 20 articles on the case in December 1858 alone. In Britain, &quot;The Spectator&quot; presented the Mortara case as evidence that the Papal States had &quot;the worst government in the world – the most insolvent and the most arrogant, the cruelest and the meanest&quot;. The Catholic press both in Italy and abroad steadfastly defended the Pope&#x27;s actions. The pro-Church articles often took on an overtly antisemitic character, charging, for example, that was hardly a surprise that coverage in Britain, France or Germany was critical, &quot;since currently the newspapers of Europe are in good part in the hands of the Jews&quot;. Scazzocchio suggested that the press storm attacking the Church was actually counter-productive for the Mortara family&#x27;s cause, because it angered the Pope and steeled his resolve not to compromise.

Regardless of whether Pope Pius IX had been personally involved in the decision to remove Mortara from his parents (whether he had been or not was debated extensively in the press), what is certain is that he was greatly surprised by the international furore that erupted over the matter. He adopted the position, based on &quot;Postremo mense&quot;, that to return the baptised child to his non-Christian family would be incompatible with Church doctrine. As foreign governments and the various branches of the Rothschild family one by one condemned his actions, Pius IX stood firm on what he saw as a matter of principle. Those angered included Napoleon III of France, who found the situation particularly vexing because the pontifical government owed its very existence to the French garrison in Rome. Napoleon III had indifferently supported the Pope&#x27;s temporal rule because it enjoyed widespread support among French Catholics. Mortara&#x27;s abduction was widely condemned in the French press and weakened support for the papacy. According to the historian , it was the final straw that changed French policy.

In February 1859, Napoleon III concluded a secret pact with the Kingdom of Sardinia pledging French military support for a campaign to drive the Austrians out and unify Italy. Most of the pontifical domain would be absorbed along with the Two Sicilies and other minor states.

At that time, it was an annual custom for the Pope to receive a delegation from Rome&#x27;s Jewish community shortly after the New Year. The meeting, on 2 February 1859, quickly descended into a heated argument, with Pope Pius berating the Jewish visitors for &quot;stirring up a storm all over Europe about this Mortara case&quot;. When the delegation denied that the Jews of Rome had had any hand in the anti-clerical articles, the Pope dismissed Scazzocchio as inexperienced and foolish, then shouted: &quot;The newspapers can write all they want. I couldn&#x27;t care less what the world thinks!&quot; The Pope then calmed down somewhat: &quot;So strong is the pity I have for you, that I pardon you, indeed, I must pardon you.&quot; One of the delegates proposed that the Church should not give so much credence to Morisi&#x27;s testimony, given her spurious morals, but the Pope countered that, regardless of her character, so far as he could see the servant had no reason to invent such a story and, in any case, Momolo Mortara should not have employed a Catholic in the first place.

Pope Pius IX&#x27;s determination to keep Edgardo developed into a strong paternal attachment. According to Edgardo&#x27;s memoirs, the pontiff regularly spent time with him and played with him. The Pope would amuse the child by hiding him under his cloak and calling out: &quot;Where&#x27;s the boy?&quot; At one of their meetings, Pope Pius told Edgardo: &quot;My son, you have cost me dearly, and I have suffered a great deal because of you.&quot; He then said to others present: &quot;Both the powerful and the powerless tried to steal this boy from me, and accused me of being barbarous and pitiless. They cried for his parents, but they failed to recognise that I, too, am his father.&quot;

===Montefiore&#x27;s petition; fall of Bologna===

The Italian Jewish appeals came to the attention of Sir Moses Montefiore, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, whose willingness to travel great distances to help his co-religionists, as he had over the Damascus blood libel of 1840, for example, was already well known. From August to December 1858, he headed a special British committee on Mortara that relayed reports from Piedmont to British newspapers and Catholic clergymen, and noted the support expressed by British Protestants, particularly the Evangelical Alliance led by Sir Culling Eardley. A strong advocate of conversion of the Jews, Eardley believed that the affair would slow down that process. After unsuccessfully attempting to have the British government lodge an official protest with the Vatican, Montefiore resolved to personally travel to Rome to present a petition to the Pope calling for Edgardo to be returned to his parents. He arrived in Rome on 5 April 1859.

Montefiore failed to gain an audience with the Pope, and was received by Cardinal Antonelli, only on 28 April. Montefiore gave him the Board of Deputies&#x27; petition to pass on to the Pope, and said that he would wait in the city a week for the pontiff&#x27;s reply. Two days later, news reached Rome that fighting had broken out between Austrian and Piedmontese troops in the north. The War of 1859 had begun. While most foreign dignitaries fled Rome as quickly as possible, Montefiore waited in vain for the Pope&#x27;s response, finally leaving on 10 May. On his return to Britain, more than 2,000 leading citizens, including 79 mayors and provosts, 27 peers, 22 Anglican bishops and archbishops and 36 members of parliament, signed a protest message calling the Pope&#x27;s conduct a &quot;dishonour to Christianity&quot;, &quot;repulsive to the instincts of humanity&quot;. Meanwhile, the Church quietly had Edgardo confirmed as a Catholic in a private chapel on 13 May 1859. By that time, Edgardo was no longer in the Catechumens but at San Pietro in Vincoli, a basilica elsewhere in Rome, where Pope Pius had personally decided the boy would be educated.

As the war turned against the Austrians, the garrison in Bologna left early in the morning on 12 June 1859. By the end of the same day, the papal colours flying in the squares had been replaced with the Italian green, white and red, the cardinal legate had left the city, and a group styling itself Bologna&#x27;s provisional government had proclaimed its desire to join the Kingdom of Sardinia. Bologna was promptly incorporated as part of the province of Romagna. The Archbishop Michele Viale-Prelà attempted to persuade the citizenry not to cooperate with the new civil authorities but had little success. One of the first official acts of the new order was to introduce freedom of religion and make all citizens equal before the law. In November 1859, the governor Luigi Carlo Farini issued a proclamation abolishing the inquisition.

==Retribution==
===Feletti arrested===

Momolo Mortara spent late 1859 and January 1860 in Paris and London, trying to rally support. While he was away, his father Simon, who lived about west of Bologna in Reggio Emilia, successfully asked the new authorities in Romagna to launch an inquiry into the Mortara case. On 31 December 1859, Farini ordered his justice minister to pursue the &quot;authors of the kidnapping&quot;. Filippo Curletti, the new director-general of police for Romagna, was put in charge of the investigation. After two officers identified the erstwhile inquisitor, Feletti, as having given the order to remove Edgardo, Curletti and a detachment of police went to San Domenico on 2 January 1860 and arrested him at about 02:30.

The police inspectors questioned Feletti, but each time they asked about anything to do with Mortara or his removal, the friar said that a sacred oath precluded his discussing affairs of the Holy Office. When Curletti ordered him to hand over all files relating to the Mortara case, Feletti said that they had been burned. When asked when or how, he repeated that on Holy Office matters he could say nothing. Pressed further, Feletti said: &quot;As far as the activities that I carried out as Inquisitor of the Holy Office of Bologna, I am obliged to explain myself to one forum only, to the Supreme Sacred Congregation in Rome, whose Prefect is His Holiness Pope Pius IX, and to no-one else.&quot; The police searched the convent for documents relating to the Mortara case, finding nothing, but the inquisitor was escorted to prison. The news that Feletti had been arrested caused the press storm concerning Mortara, which had died down somewhat, to flare up again across Europe.
===Investigation===
Feletti&#x27;s trial was the first major criminal case in Bologna under the new authorities. On 18 January 1860, the magistrate, Francesco Carboni, announced that Feletti and Lieutenant-Colonel Luigi De Dominicis would be prosecuted, but not Lucidi or Agostini. When Carboni interviewed Feletti in prison on 23 January, the friar said that, in seizing Edgardo from his family, he had only carried out instructions from the Holy Office, &quot;which never promulgates any decree without the consent of the Roman Pontiff&quot;. Feletti then recounted a version of the Church narrative of the case, stating that Edgardo had &quot;always remained firm in his desire to remain a Christian&quot; and was now studying successfully in Rome. In conclusion, he predicted that Edgardo would one day be the &quot;support and pride&quot; of the Mortara family.

On 6 February, Momolo Mortara gave an account of the case that contradicted the inquisitor&#x27;s at almost every turn. In Rome, he said, Edgardo had been &quot;frightened, and intimidated by the rector&#x27;s presence, [but] he openly declared his desire to return home with us&quot;. Carboni then travelled to San Giovanni in Persiceto to interrogate Morisi, who gave her age as 23 rather than the actual 26. Morisi said that Edgardo had fallen sick in the winter of 1851–52, when he was about four months old. She recounted having seen the Mortaras sitting sadly by Edgardo&#x27;s crib and &quot;reading from a book in Hebrew that the Jews read when one of them is about to die&quot;. She repeated her account of giving Edgardo an emergency baptism at the instigation of the grocer Lepori and later telling the story to a neighbour&#x27;s servant called Regina, adding that she had also told her sisters about the baptism.

As before, Lepori denied any role in the affair whatsoever, asserting that he could not even remember Morisi. The &quot;Regina&quot; in Morisi&#x27;s story was identified as Regina Bussolari but, though Morisi averred to have told her the whole story, Bussolari professed to know nothing of the case. She said that she had spoken with Morisi only &quot;once or twice, when she was going up to the storage room to get something&quot;, and never about anything to do with the Mortaras&#x27; children.

Elena Pignatti, who had employed Morisi after she left the Mortaras in 1857, and whose words about Morisi&#x27;s misconduct had formed part of the Mortaras&#x27; appeal to the Pope, testified that
Pignatti said that she had herself seen Edgardo during his illness, and Marianna sitting by the crib: &quot;Since his mother was crying, and despaired for his life, I thought he was dying, also because of his appearance: his eyes were closed, and he was hardly moving.&quot; She added that during the three months when Morisi worked for her in late 1857, the servant had been summoned to San Domenico four or five times, and had said that the inquisitor had promised her a dowry.

Bussolari&#x27;s denial that she had discussed any baptism with Morisi raised the question of who could have reported the rumours to the inquisitor in the first place. On 6 March, Carboni interviewed Morisi again and pointed out the inconsistencies between her story and the testimony of the Mortara family doctor, the Mortaras themselves, and both Lepori and Bussolari. She replied: &quot;It&#x27;s the Gospel truth&quot;. Carboni put it to Morisi that she might have invented the whole story out of spite against the Mortara family in the hope that the Church might reward her. When Carboni asked Morisi if she had been to San Domenico apart from for her interrogation, she stated that she had been there on two other occasions to try to secure a dowry from Father Feletti. Carboni suggested that Morisi must have herself prompted the interrogation by recounting Edgardo&#x27;s baptism during one of those visits, but Morisi insisted that the interrogation had been first and the other two visits later.

After one last interview with Feletti, who again said almost nothing, citing a sacred oath, Carboni informed him that so far as he could see, there was no evidence to support his version of events. Feletti replied: &quot;I commiserate with the Mortara parents for their painful separation from their son, but I hope that the prayers of the innocent soul succeed in having God reunite them all in the Christian religion ... As for my punishment, not only do I place myself in the Lord&#x27;s hands, but I would argue that any government would recognise the legitimacy of my action.&quot; The next day, Feletti and De Dominicis, the latter of whom had fled to the rump Papal States, were formally charged with the &quot;violent separation of the boy Edgardo Mortara from his own Jewish family&quot;.

===Feletti tried and acquitted ===
Feletti faced a court trial under the code of laws in effect in Bologna at the time of Edgardo&#x27;s removal. Carboni proposed that even under the pontifical laws, the seizure was illegal. He reported that he had seen no evidence to support the friar&#x27;s claim that he had acted following instructions from Rome, and that there was substantial evidence casting doubt on Morisi&#x27;s account but, so far as he could see, Feletti had done nothing to verify what she had said before ordering the child removed. After Feletti refused to appoint a defence counsel when prompted, saying he was putting his defence in the hands of God and the Virgin Mary, the experienced Bologna lawyer, Francesco Jussi, was appointed by the state to defend him.

The hearing on 16 April 1860, before a panel of six judges, was attended by neither the Mortara family nor Feletti, the former because they were in Turin and learned of the trial date only two days beforehand, and the latter because he refused to recognise the right of the new authorities to put him on trial. With the evidence gathered by Curletti and Carboni already in hand, the prosecution had no witnesses to call. The prosecutor, Radamisto Valentini, a lawyer fighting his first major case, declared that Feletti had ordered the removal alone and on his own initiative, and then turned his focus to Carboni&#x27;s second point about how the authorities in Rome could have possibly concluded that Morisi&#x27;s story was genuine. Valentini went over Morisi&#x27;s account in detail, arguing that even if things had happened as she said, the baptism had not been administered properly and was therefore invalid. He then highlighted the inconsistencies between her testimony and the other accounts, condemned Morisi as a silly girl &quot;corrupted by the foul breath and touch of foreign soldiers ... [who] rolled over without shame with them&quot;, and finally charged that Feletti had ordered the removal himself out of and &quot;an inquisitor&#x27;s hatred of Judaism&quot;.

Jussi found himself in the unusual position of attempting to defend a client who refused to defend himself. With no evidence at his disposal to support Feletti&#x27;s testimony, he was forced to rely almost entirely on his own oratory. Jussi noted some aspects of the sequence of events that he said suggested that orders had indeed come from Rome. For example, Feletti had sent Edgardo straight off to the capital without seeing him, and the Holy Office and the Pope were far better placed to adjudge the validity of the baptism than a secular court. He quoted at length from Angelo Padovani&#x27;s account of his meeting with Anna Morisi in July 1858, then cast doubt on the grocer Lepori&#x27;s claim that he did not even know how to baptise a child, producing a police report in which Lepori was described as a close friend of a Jesuit priest. Jussi proposed that Lepori and Bussolari might both be lying to protect themselves, and that Morisi&#x27;s sexual impropriety did not necessarily mean her story was false. He concluded that since Feletti had been inquisitor at the time, he had merely done what that office required him to do, and no crime had been committed. Following a swift deliberation, the judging panel, headed by Calcedonio Ferrari, ruled that Feletti should be released as he had acted under instructions from the government of the time.

The interval between the priest&#x27;s arrest and his trial, coupled with the swift progress being made towards Italian unification, meant that the Mortara case had lost much of its prominence, so there was little protest against the decision. The Jewish press expressed disappointment – an editorial in the Italian Jewish paper &quot;L&#x27;Educatore Israelita&quot; suggested that it had perhaps been unwise to target Feletti rather than someone more senior. In France, &quot;Archives Israélites&quot; took a similar line, positing: &quot;what good does it do to strike at the arm when it is the head that in this case conceived, carried out, and sanctioned the attack?&quot;

===Plans to recapture Edgardo===
The Mortaras were not surprised by the verdict in Feletti&#x27;s trial. Momolo hoped that his son might be a major topic of discussion at an international conference on the future of Italy, but was disappointed when no such summit materialised. His cause, and a visit to Paris, partly motivated the formation in May 1860 of the Alliance Israélite Universelle, a Paris-based organisation dedicated to the advancement of Jewish civil rights across the world. As the Italian nationalist armies advanced through the peninsula, the fall of Rome seemed imminent. In September 1860, the Alliance Israélite Universelle wrote to Momolo offering him financial and logistical support if he wished to reclaim his son by force, as &quot;getting your child back is the cause of all Israel&quot;. A separate plan was formulated by Carl Blumenthal, an English Jew serving in Giuseppe Garibaldi&#x27;s nationalist volunteer corps: Blumenthal and three others would dress up as clergymen, seize Edgardo, and spirit him away. Garibaldi approved the plan in 1860, but it was apparently called off after one of the conspirators died.

==Conclusion==
===Italian unification; Edgardo flees===

The Pope remained steadfastly determined not to give Edgardo up, declaring: &quot;What I have done for this boy, I had the right and the duty to do. If it happened again, I would do the same thing.&quot; When the delegation from Rome&#x27;s Jewish community attended their annual meeting at the Vatican in January 1861, they were surprised to find the nine year-old Edgardo at the pontiff&#x27;s side. The new Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed two months later with Victor Emmanuel II as king. A reduced incarnation of the Papal States, comprising Rome, its immediate environs, and Lazio, endured outside the new kingdom because of Napoleon III&#x27;s reluctance to offend his Catholic subjects by withdrawing the French garrison. He pulled these troops out in 1864 following the September Convention and transport to the Catechumens of another Jewish child, nine-year-old Giuseppe Coen from the Roman Ghetto. The removal of the French garrison brought the Roman Question to the fore in the Italian parliament. The statesman Marco Minghetti dismissed a proposed compromise whereby Rome would become part of the kingdom with the Pope retaining some special powers, saying: &quot;We cannot go to guard the Mortara boy for the Pope.&quot; The French garrison returned in 1867, following an unsuccessful attempt by Garibaldi to capture the city.

In early 1865, at the age of 13, Edgardo became a novice in the Canons Regular of the Lateran, adding the Pope&#x27;s name to his own to become Pio Edgardo Mortara. He wrote repeatedly to his family, he recalled, &quot;dealing with religion and doing what I could to convince them of the truth of the Catholic faith&quot;, but received no reply until May 1867. His parents, who were now living in Florence, wrote that they still loved him dearly, but saw nothing of their son in the letters they had received. In July 1870, just before Edgardo turned 19, the French garrison in Rome was withdrawn for good after the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Italian troops captured the city on 20 September 1870.

Momolo Mortara followed the Royal Italian Army into Rome, hoping to finally reclaim his son. According to some accounts, he was preceded by his son Riccardo, Edgardo&#x27;s elder brother, who had entered the kingdom&#x27;s service as an infantry officer. Riccardo Mortara fought his way to San Pietro in Vincoli and found his brother&#x27;s convent room. Edgardo covered his eyes, raised his hand in front of him and shouted: &quot;Get back, Satan!&quot; When Riccardo said that he was his brother, Edgardo replied: &quot;Before you get any closer to me, take off that assassin&#x27;s uniform.&quot; Whatever the truth, what is certain is that Edgardo reacted to the capture of Rome with intense panic. He later wrote: &quot;After the Piedmontese troops entered Rome ... they used their force to seize the neophyte Coen from the Collegio degli Scolopi, [then] turned toward San Pietro in Vincoli to try to kidnap me as well.&quot; The Roman chief of police asked Edgardo to return to his family to appease public opinion, but he refused. He subsequently met the Italian commander, General Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora, who told him that as he was 19 years old he could do as he wished. Edgardo was smuggled out of Rome by train along with a priest on 22 October 1870, late at night and in lay clothes. He made his way north and escaped to Austria-Hungary.

===Father Mortara===

Edgardo found shelter in a convent of the Canons Regular in Austria, where he lived under an assumed name. In 1872, he moved to a monastery at Poitiers in France, where Pope Pius regularly corresponded with the bishop about the young man. After a year, Pio Edgardo Mortara was ordained as a priest. That required special dispensation because, aged 21, he was technically too young. He received a personal letter from the Pope to mark the occasion, along with a lifetime trust fund of 7,000 lire to support him.

Father Mortara spent most of the rest of his life outside Italy, travelling throughout Europe and preaching. It was said that he could give sermons in six languages, including Basque, and read three more, including Hebrew. &quot;As a preacher he was in great demand,&quot; Kertzer writes,
Momolo Mortara died in 1871, shortly after spending seven months in prison during his trial over the death of a servant girl who had fallen from the window of his apartment. The Florentine court of appeal found him guilty of murdering her, but he was acquitted by the court of assizes. Pope Pius IX died in 1878. The same year, Marianna travelled to Perpignan in south-western France, where she had heard Edgardo was preaching, and enjoyed an emotional reunion with her son, who was pleased to see her, but disappointed when she refused his pleas to convert to Catholicism. Edgardo thereafter attempted to re-establish connections with his family, but not all of his relatives were as receptive to him as his mother.

Following Marianna&#x27;s death in 1890, it was reported in French newspapers that she had finally, on her deathbed, and with Edgardo beside her, become a Christian. Edgardo refuted that: &quot;I have always ardently desired that my mother embrace the Catholic faith,&quot; he wrote in a letter to &quot;Le Temps&quot;, &quot;and I tried many times to get her to do so. However, that never happened&quot;. A year later, Father Pio Edgardo Mortara returned to Italy, for the first time in two decades, to preach in Modena. A sister and some of his brothers went to hear his sermon, and for the rest of his life Edgardo called on his relatives whenever he was in Italy. During a 1919 sojourn in Rome he visited the House of Catechumens he had entered 61 years before. By that time, he had settled at the abbey of the Canons Regular at Bouhay in Liège, Belgium. Bouhay had a sanctuary to the Virgin of Lourdes, to which Father Mortara felt a special connection, the Lourdes apparitions of 1858 having occurred in the same year as his own conversion to Christianity. Father Pio Edgardo Mortara resided at Bouhay for the rest of his life and died there on 11 March 1940, at the age of 88.

==Appraisal and legacy==

The Mortara case is given little attention in most Risorgimento histories, if it is mentioned at all.
The first book-length scholarly work was Rabbi Bertram Korn&#x27;s &quot;The American Reaction to the Mortara Case: 1858–1859&quot; (1957), which was devoted entirely to public opinion in the United States and, according to Kertzer, often incorrect about details of the case. The main historical reference until the 1990s was a series of articles written by the Italian scholar Gemma Volli and published around the centenary of the controversy in 1958–60. When David Kertzer began studying the case, he was surprised to find that many of his Italian colleagues were not familiar with it, while specialists in Jewish studies across the world invariably were. Mortara had, as Kertzer put it, &quot;[fallen] from the mainstream of Italian history into the ghetto of Jewish history&quot;. Kertzer explored many sources not previously studied and eventually published &quot;The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara&quot; (1997), which has become the standard reference work for the affair.

The Mortara case was, in the view of Timothy Verhoeven, the greatest controversy to surround the Catholic Church in the mid-19th century, because it &quot;more than any other single issue ... exposed the divide between supporters and opponents of the Vatican&quot;. Abigail Green writes that &quot;this clash between liberal and Catholic worldviews at a moment of critical international tension ... gave the Mortara affair global significance – and rendered it a transformative episode in the Jewish world as well&quot;. Mortara himself suggested in 1893 that his abduction had been, for a time, &quot;more famous than that of the Sabine Women&quot;.

In the months before Pius IX&#x27;s beatification by the Catholic Church in 2000, Jewish commentators and others in the international media raised the largely forgotten Mortara episode while analysing the Pope&#x27;s life and legacy. According to Dov Levitan, the basic facts of the Mortara case are far from unique, but it is of particular importance nevertheless, because of its effect on public opinion in Italy, Britain and France, and as an example of &quot;the great sense of Jewish solidarity that emerged in the latter half of the 19th century [as] Jews rose to the cause of their brethren in various parts of the world&quot;. The &quot;Alliance Israélite Universelle&quot;, the formation of which had been partly motivated by the Mortara case, grew into one of the most prominent Jewish organisations in the world, and endures into the 21st century.

According to Michael Goldfarb, the Mortara controversy provided &quot;an embarrassing example of just how out of touch with modern times the Church was&quot;, and demonstrated that &quot;Pope Pius IX was incapable of bringing the Church into the modern era&quot;. Kertzer takes a similar view: &quot;The refusal to return Edgardo contributed to the growing sense that the Pope&#x27;s role as temporal ruler, with his own police force, was an anachronism that could no longer be maintained.&quot; Kertzer suggests that the affair may have motivated the French to change their stance on Italian unification in 1859–1861.

In the twenty-first century, many Catholics see the affair as a cause for shame, and an example of abuse of authority or antisemitism in the Church . However, some supporters of Catholic integralism, such as Romanus Cessario, have defended Pius IX&#x27;s actions during the affair, arguing that civil liberties should be subordinate to the Catholic religion.

== In popular media ==
The case is the subject of Francesco Cilluffo&#x27;s two-act opera &quot;Il caso Mortara&quot;, which premiered in New York in 2010. The publication, by Vittorio Messori in 2005, of the Italian language version of Mortara&#x27;s unpublished Spanish memoirs, available in English since 2017 under the title &quot;Kidnapped by the Vatican? The Unpublished Memoirs of Edgardo Mortara&quot;, reignited the debate.

In 2023, Marco Bellocchio released &quot;Kidnapped: The Abduction of Edgardo Mortara&quot;, a film he also wrote and directed.

<text>The gens Fabia was one of the most ancient patrician families at ancient Rome. The gens played a prominent part in history soon after the establishment of the Republic, and three brothers were invested with seven successive consulships, from 485 to 479 BC, thereby cementing the high repute of the family. Overall, the Fabii received 45 consulships during the Republic. The house derived its greatest lustre from the patriotic courage and tragic fate of the 306 Fabii in the Battle of the Cremera, 477 BC. But the Fabii were not distinguished as warriors alone; several members of the gens were also important in the history of Roman literature and the arts.

==Background==
The family is generally thought to have been counted amongst the , the most prominent of the patrician houses at Rome, together with the Aemilii, Claudii, Cornelii, Manlii, and Valerii; but no list of the &quot;gentes maiores&quot; has survived, and even the number of families so designated is a complete mystery. Until 480 BC, the Fabii were staunch supporters of the aristocratic policies favoring the patricians and the senate against the plebs. However, following a great battle that year against the Veientes, in which victory was achieved only by cooperation between the generals and their soldiers, the Fabii aligned themselves with the plebs.

One of the thirty-five voting &quot;tribes&quot; into which the Roman people were divided was named after the Fabii; several tribes were named after important gentes, including the tribes &quot;Aemilia, Claudia, Cornelia, Fabia, Papiria, Publilia, Sergia&quot;, and &quot;Veturia&quot;. Several of the others appear to have been named after lesser families.

The most famous legend of the Fabii asserts that, following the last of the seven consecutive consulships in 479 BC, the gens undertook the war with Veii as a private obligation. A militia consisting of over three hundred men of the gens, together with their friends and clients, a total of some four thousand men, stationed itself in arms on a hill overlooking the Cremera, a small river between Rome and Veii. The cause of this secession is said to have been the enmity between the Fabii and the patricians, who regarded them as traitors for advocating the causes of the plebeians. The Fabian militia remained in their camp on the Cremera for two years, successfully opposing the Veientes, until at last, on the fifteenth day before the kalends of Sextilis—July 18, 477 BC—they were lured into an ambush and destroyed. Three hundred and six Fabii of fighting age were said to have perished in the disaster, leaving only a single survivor to return home. By some accounts he was the only survivor of the entire gens; but it seems unlikely that the camp of the Fabii included not only all of the men, but the women and children of the family as well. They and the elders of the gens probably remained at Rome. 

This story was considerably embellished at a later date in order to present the Battle of the Cremera as a Roman counterpart to the Greek Battle of Thermopylae. However, historian Tim Cornell writes that there is no reason to doubt the historicity of the battle, because the &quot;tribus Fabia&quot;—presumably where the Fabii had their country estates—was located near the Cremera, on the border with Veii. The day on which the Fabii perished was forever remembered, as it was the same day that the Gauls defeated the Roman army at the Battle of the Allia in 390 BC. The Gauls had marched on Rome only in retaliation after Quintus Fabius Ambustus, sent as an ambassador, broke a truce to attack the Gauls at Clusium.

Throughout the history of the Republic, the Fabii made several alliances with other prominent families, especially plebeian and Italian ones, which partly explains their long prominence. The first of such alliances that can be traced dates from the middle of the fifth century and was with the Poetelii; it lasted for at least a century. In the fourth century, the Fabii were allied to the patrician Manlii and the plebeian Genucii and Licinii, whom they supported during the Conflict of the Orders. They then occupied an unprecedented leading position in the third century, as three generations of Fabii were &quot;princeps senatus&quot;—a unique occurrence during the Republic. During this period, they allied with the plebeian Atilii from Campania, where the Fabii had significant estates, the Fulvii and Mamilii from Tusculum, the Otacili from Beneventum, the Ogulnii from Etruria, and the Marcii. They also sponsored the emergence of the Caecilii Metelli and Porcii, who owed their first consulate to the Fabii, as well as the re-emergence of the patrician Quinctii. The main direction of the second war against Carthage was disputed between the Fabii and the Cornelii Scipiones. The death of Fabius Verrucosus in 203 marks the end of the Fabian leadership on Roman politics, by now assumed by their rivals: Scipio Africanus and his family. After the consulship of Fabius Maximus Eburnus in 116, the Fabii entered a century-long eclipse, until their temporary revival under Augustus.

The name of the Fabii was associated with one of the two colleges of the &quot;Luperci&quot;, the priests who carried on the sacred rites of the ancient religious festival of the Lupercalia. The other college bore the name of the Quinctilii, suggesting that in the earliest times these two gentes superintended these rites as a &quot;sacrum gentilicum&quot;, much as the Pinarii and Potitii maintained the worship of Hercules. Such sacred rites were gradually transferred to the state, or opened to the Roman &quot;populus;&quot; a well-known legend attributed the destruction of the Potitii to the abandonment of its religious office. In later times the privilege of the Lupercalia had ceased to be confined to the Fabii and the Quinctilii.

==Origin==

According to legend, the Fabii claimed descent from Hercules, who visited Italy a generation before the Trojan War, and from Evander, his host, through Fabius. This brought the Fabii into the same tradition as the Pinarii and Potitii, who were said to have welcomed Hercules and learned from him the sacred rites which for centuries afterward they performed in his honor.

Another early legend stated that at the founding of Rome, the followers of the brothers Romulus and Remus were called the Quinctilii and the Fabii, respectively. The brothers were said to have offered up sacrifices in the cave of the Lupercal at the base of the Palatine Hill, which became the origin of the Lupercalia. This story is certainly connected with the tradition that the two colleges of the Luperci bore the names of these ancient gentes.

The nomen of the Fabii is said originally to have been &quot;Fovius, Favius&quot;, or &quot;Fodius;&quot; Plinius stated that it was derived from &quot;faba&quot;, a bean, a vegetable which the Fabii were said to have first cultivated. A more fanciful explanation derives the name from &quot;fovea&quot;, ditches, which the ancestors of the Fabii were said to have used in order to capture wolves.

It is uncertain whether the Fabii were of Latin or Sabine origin. Niebuhr, followed by Göttling, considered them Sabines. However, other scholars are unsatisfied with their reasoning, and point out that the legend associating the Fabii with Romulus and Remus would place them at Rome before the incorporation of the Sabines into the nascent Roman state.

It may nonetheless be noted that, even supposing this tradition to be based on actual historical events, the followers of the brothers were described as &quot;shepherds,&quot; and presumably included many of the people then living in the countryside where the city of Rome was to be built. The hills of Rome were already inhabited at the time of the city&#x27;s legendary founding, and they stood in the hinterland between the Latins, Sabines, and Etruscans. Even if many the followers of Romulus and Remus were Latins from the ancient city of Alba Longa, many may also have been Sabines already living in the surrounding countryside.

==Praenomina==
The earliest generations of the Fabii favored the praenomina &quot;Caeso, Quintus&quot;, and &quot;Marcus&quot;. They were the only patrician gens to make regular use of &quot;Numerius&quot;, which appears in the family after the destruction of the Fabii at the Cremera. According to the tradition related by Festus, this praenomen entered the gens when Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, the consul of 467, married a daughter of Numerius Otacilius of Maleventum, and bestowed his father-in-law&#x27;s name on his son.

Although the Fabii Ambusti and some later branches of the family used the praenomen &quot;Gaius&quot;, &quot;Quintus&quot; is the name most frequently associated with the Fabii of the later Republic. The Fabii Maximi used it almost to the exclusion of all other names until the end of the Republic, when they revived the ancient praenomen &quot;Paullus&quot;. This was done in honor of the Aemilii Paulli, from whom the later Fabii Maximi were descended, having been adopted into the Fabia gens at the end of the 3rd century BC. A variety of surnames associated with the Aemilii were also used by this family, and one of the Fabii was called &quot;Africanus Fabius Maximus&quot;, although his proper name was &quot;Quintus Fabius Maximus Africanus&quot;. In a manuscript of Cicero, &quot;Servius&quot; appears among the Fabii Pictores, but this seems to have been a corruption in the manuscript, which originally read &quot;Numerius&quot;.

==Branches and cognomina==

The cognomina of the Fabii under the Republic were &quot;Ambustus, Buteo, Dorso&quot; or &quot;Dorsuo, Labeo, Licinus, Maximus&quot; (with the agnomina &quot;Aemilianus, Allobrogicus, Eburnus, Gurges, Rullianus, Servilianus&quot;, and &quot;Verrucosus&quot;), &quot;Pictor&quot;, and &quot;Vibulanus&quot;. Other cognomina belonged to persons who were not, strictly speaking, members of the gens, but who were freedmen or the descendants of freedmen, or who had been enrolled as Roman citizens under the Fabii. The only cognomina appearing on coins are &quot;Hispaniensis, Labeo, Maximus&quot;, and &quot;Pictor&quot;.

In imperial times it becomes difficult to distinguish between members of the gens and unrelated persons sharing the same nomen. Members of the gens are known as late as the second century, but persons bearing the name of &quot;Fabius&quot; continue to appear into the latest period of the Empire.

The eldest branch of the Fabii bore the cognomen &quot;Vibulanus&quot;, which may allude to an ancestral home of the gens. The surname &quot;Ambustus&quot;, meaning &quot;burnt&quot;, replaced &quot;Vibulanus&quot; at the end of the fifth century BC; the first of the Fabii to be called &quot;Ambustus&quot; was a descendant of the Vibulani. The most celebrated &quot;stirps&quot; of the Fabia gens, which bore the surname &quot;Maximus&quot;, was in turn descended from the Fabii Ambusti. This family was famous for its statesmen and its military exploits, which lasted from the Samnite Wars, in the fourth century BC until the wars with the Germanic invaders of the second century BC. Most, if not all of the later Fabii Maximi were descendants of Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus, one of the Aemilii Paulli, who as a child was adopted into that illustrious family.

&quot;Buteo&quot;, which described a type of hawk, was originally given to a member of the Fabia gens because such a bird on one occasion settled upon his ship with a favorable omen. This tradition, related by Plinius, does not indicate which of the Fabii first obtained this surname, but it was probably one of the Fabii Ambusti. Crawford suggests that the &quot;buteo&quot; of the legend was not a hawk, but a flamingo, based on the appearance of a bird resembling a flamingo on the coins of Gaius Fabius Hadrianus, who may have sought to associate himself with that family by the use of such a symbol. Hadrianus and his descendants form the last distinguishable family of the Fabii. Their surname was probably derived from the Latin colony of Hatria, and it is likely that they were not lineal descendants of the Fabii Buteones, but newly-enfranchised citizens. The flamingo might also allude to the family&#x27;s coastal origins.

The surname &quot;Pictor&quot;, borne by another family of the Fabii, signifies a painter, and the earliest known member of this family was indeed a painter, famed for his work in the temple of Salus, built by Gaius Junius Bubulcus Brutus between 307 and 302 BC. The later members of this family, several of whom were distinguished in the arts, appear to have been his descendants, and must have taken their cognomen from this ancestor. The cognomen &quot;Labeo&quot;—originally denoting someone with prominent lips—appears at the beginning of the second century BC; Quintus Fabius Labeo, the first of that name, was also a poet, but his line vanished before the end of the century.

<doc id="347925" wikidata="Q3595254" url="?curid=347925" title="V. R. Krishna Iyer">
<text>[[Justice (title)|Justice]] Vaidyanathapuram Rama Iyer Krishna Iyer (15 November 1914 – 4 December 2014) was an Indian judge who became a pioneer of judicial activism. He pioneered the legal-aid movement in the country. Before that, he was a state minister and politician.

As an activist lawyer, he served jail terms for the cause of his poor and underprivileged clients. He was seen as an ardent human-rights activist. In addition, he campaigned for social justice and the environment. A sports enthusiast and a prolific author, he was conferred with the Padma Vibhushan in 1999. His judgements continue to be cited in the higher judiciary.

==Early life and education ==
Krishna Iyer was born in a Tamil Brahmin family on 15 November 1914 in Vaidyanathapuram village in Palakkad, which was the part of the then Malabar region of the then Madras State, to a lawyer father, named Rama Iyer, and a mother named Narayani Ammal. He was the eldest among the seven children born to his parents, among whom, the youngest, V. R. Lakshminarayanan, served as the Director General of Police in Tamil Nadu Police. He inherited from his father the qualities of taking an avid interest in the community around and using the law for the benefit of those more in need.

Iyer was educated at Basel Evangelical Mission Parsi High School, Thalassery, Government Victoria College, Palakkad, Annamalai University, and at Dr. Ambedkar Government Law College, Chennai. He started practice in his father&#x27;s chamber in 1938 at Thalassery, Malabar. In 1948, when he protested the evil of torture by police for interrogation, he was imprisoned for a month on a fabricated charge of giving legal assistance to communists.

==Career ==

=== Legal Practice ===
Iyer joined the Bar in 1938, beginning his practice in the chambers of his father, V.V. Rama Aiyar, who was a lawyer in Thalassery in the State of Kerala.

=== Political career ===
Iyer was elected to the Madras Legislative Assembly in 1952, from Kuthuparamba as a non-party, independent candidate, and served until 1956. In 1957, Iyer stood for elections again from the Thalassery constituency as an independent candidate. He was supported by the Communist Party of India. He was a Minister between 1957 and 1959 in the government led by E. M. S. Namboodiripad, holding the portfolios for Home, Law, Prison, Electricity, Irrigation, Social Welfare and Inland Water. He initiated legal-aid to the poor, jail reforms incorporating the rights of prisoners, and set up more courts and rescue homes for women and children. He got several labour and land reform laws passed. He resolved an inter-state water dispute between the newly formed neighbouring states, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. When this government was dismissed by the central government, he resumed legal practice in August 1959. He lost the 1965 assembly election, which he again contested as an independent candidate.

=== Judicial career ===
He was appointed a judge of the Kerala High Court on 12 July 1968. He was elevated as judge of the Supreme Court of India on 17 July 1973. Following this, a group of lawyers had written a letter published in &quot;The Times of India&quot;, objecting to his appointment as a judge.

=== Law Commission of India ===
Iyer was a member of the Law Commission of India from 1971 to 1973 where he drafted a comprehensive report, which would lead to the legal-aid movement in the country.

== Jurisprudence ==
Iyer made notable contributions in the field of constitutional law, focusing on social, political, and civil rights. He was noted for his use of literary references in his judgments.

=== Public Interest Litigation ===
Iyer made notable contributions to public interest litigation at the Supreme Court of India, and relaxed the rules regarding standing in a number of cases in order to allow the Court to hear and decide on socially significant matters. On a number of occasions, Iyer utilised the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;suo motu&quot; jurisdiction to hear cases based on letters or postcards written to the Court, raising awareness about social concerns. Along with Justice P. N. Bhagwati, he introduced the concept of PILs (Public Interest Litigations) or &quot;people&#x27;s involvement&quot; in the country&#x27;s courts with a series of cases. This revolutionary tool, initially used by public-spirited citizens to file PILs on behalf of sections of society unable to on their own, continues to bring in unheard changes in the day-to-day lives of the people even now, decades later. Observing this, he states: ? 

=== Jurisprudence during the Emergency ===
In June 1975, the Allahabad High Court had ruled that Prime Minister Indira Gandhi&#x27;s election to Parliament was unlawful, and barred her from it for another six years. Iyer was on the bench that heard an appeal against this order in the Supreme Court. In &quot;Indira Gandhi v Raj Narain&quot;, he ruled that although Mrs. Gandhi could no longer be a Member of Parliament, she was entitled to retain her position as Prime Minister.

Rebuffing favour-seekers, he heard a challenge to this order in the Supreme Court. He was both blamed for granting a conditional stay and praised for refusing an unconditional stay. Interpreting this as losing the popular mandate to rule, the Opposition called for her resignation. The next day she declared a state of Emergency in the country.

=== Social Rights ===
Iyer wrote judgments in several notable cases concerning social rights. These included &quot;Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India&quot;, in which he held that Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, which protects the right to life and liberty, must be interpreted widely to include several social rights. In the Ratlam Municipality case, he started a trend for judges to leave the courtroom and go out and see, the situation on the ground. Moreover, this case would be a forerunner of cases which would be decided later on, on the concepts of &quot;precautionary principle&quot;, &quot;polluter pays&quot; and &quot;sustainable development&quot;. In Muthamma&#x27;s case, Iyer called for breaking the &#x27;glass ceiling&#x27; with gender parity in traditional practices in public employment.

=== Civil and Political Rights ===
Iyer ruled in several cases that aimed to secure against custodial violence, ruling on bail conditions as well as regarding legal aid for detainees. Iyer also ruled against the practice of establishing special courts for cases involving politically connected persons. Iyer advocating criminal justice based on corrective measures, and opposed retributive justice, calling for therapies such as meditation within prison environments to help decrease recidivism. He also ruled against the practice of solitary confinement.

Iyer was an opponent of the death penalty, laying down the standard that it could only be imposed in the &quot;rarest of rare&quot; cases. In &quot;Ediga Anamma v State of Andhra Pradesh,&quot; he established the jurisprudence governing the commuting of death sentences to imprisonment for life, identifying mitigating factors that could be applied in such cases.

==Public life post-retirement and death==
He retired as a judge on 14 November 1980 but, continued to advocate the cause of justice, on every forum and through his writings, participating in street protests, and his house would always remain open, bustling with all who sought his help or advice. He stood for the nation&#x27;s president in 1987, as the Opposition&#x27;s candidate against R. Venkataraman, the ruling Congress&#x27;s nominee who won. In 2002, he inquired into the Gujarat riots as part of a citizens&#x27; panel, with retired Justice P. B. Sawant among others. He also headed the Kerala Law Reform Commission in 2009. He had been active, almost until a few weeks before his death, when ill-health and advancing age took their toll on him. As a public intellectual Iyer held several positions in the people&#x27;s organizations, arts societies, sports councils, and cultural groupings.

He died on 4 December 2014 at the age of 100, and was cremated with state honours. His wife Sarada, who would listen to him talk about his work, when on occasion he would change his mind after she gave her opinion on it, had predeceased him. Upon his demise, his private library was donated to the National University of Advanced Legal Studies, where the Justice Krishna Iyer Collection still resides. He is survived by his two sons, Ramesh and Paramesh.

==Publications ==
He has to his credit 70–100 books, mostly on law, and four travelogues. He has also authored a book in Tamil, &quot;Neethimandramum Samanvya Manithanum&quot;. &quot;Leaves from My Personal Life&quot; is his autobiography. There are around five published books by other authors about him.

<text>Taxco de Alarcón (; usually referred to as simply Taxco) is a small city and administrative center of Taxco de Alarcón Municipality located in the Mexican state of Guerrero. Taxco is located in the north-central part of the state, from the city of Iguala, from the state capital of Chilpancingo and southwest of Mexico City.

The city is heavily associated with silver, both with the mining of it and other metals and for the crafting of it into jewelry, silverware and other items. Today, mining is no longer a mainstay of the city&#x27;s economy. The city&#x27;s reputation for silverwork, along with its stylish homes and surrounding landscapes, have made tourism the main economic activity.

==History==

The name Taxco is most likely derived from the Nahuatl place name &quot;Tlachco&quot;, which means &quot;place of the ballgame&quot;. However, one interpretation has the name coming from the word &quot;tatzco&quot; which means &quot;where the father of the water is,&quot; due to the high waterfall near the town center on Atatzin Mountain. &quot;De Alarcón&quot; is in honor of writer Juan Ruiz de Alarcón who was a native of the town. Like many municipalities in central Mexico, the municipality&#x27;s coat-of-arms is an Aztec glyph. This glyph is in the shape of a Mesoamerican ballcourt with rings, players and skulls, derived from the most likely source of Taxco&#x27;s name.

Before the arrival of the Spanish in Mexico, the indigenous community known as &quot;Taxco&quot; was not located where the modern city is now. The name referred to a village about ten kilometers to the south, which is now referred to as Taxco El Viejo (Old Taxco). In pre-Hispanic times, this village was the most important in the area as it was the seat of the Aztec governor who presided over tribute collection in the surrounding seven districts. The modern Spanish town of Taxco was founded by Hernán Cortés in an area previously known as Tetelcingo, because of the abundance of silver here.

Mining here began in the pre-Hispanic period with natives extracting a number of stones for decorative and ritual purposes. The Spanish discovered silver lodes here in around 1532, which started commercial silver mining in the area.
Mining operations in the area during the early colonial period was carried out mostly by mining haciendas such as the Hacienda del Chorrillo and the Hacienda San Juan Bautista, established by Cortés or his knights. In the mid 18th century, José de la Borda arrived to Taxco and started more modern operations in mines called Pedregal, El Coyote, San Ignacio and Cerro Perdido.

For most of the colonial period, the area was sparsely populated, including the town of Taxco itself. For this reason, it was governed as a dependency of Mexico City. When the modern state of Guerrero was created in 1850, Taxco was chosen to be the seat of the municipality of the same name. Since it was the only town of any size in the area, the town was taken a number of times during a number of different conflicts. During the Mexican War of Independence, it was taken by Hermenegildo Galeana in 1815. During the Reform Wars, it was taken by Porfirio Diaz in 1865. During the Mexican Revolution, it was taken by Jesus Moran and Margarito Giles in 1911, and occupied by Carranza&#x27;s forces in 1916.

Silversmithing was reinvigorated in Taxco by American William Spratling, who moved to the town in the 1920s, creating silver design workshops and exported items, mostly to the United States. With its fame for silversmithing, tourism became a major economic force in Taxco.

==Geography==
Taxco is located in the north-central part of the state, 36 kilometres (22 miles) from the city of Iguala, 135 kilometres (84 miles) from the state capital of Chilpancingo and 170 kilometres (106 miles) southwest of Mexico City.
===Climate===
The climate in Taxco is mild, with average highs around and average lows around year-round. The dry season lasts from November to April, with rains typically occurring from June to September.

==Demographics and development==
Taxco&#x27;s population was 52,217 (in 13,933 households), of whom 48% were men and 52% were women. Taxco&#x27;s population grew rapidly from 1950 (10,023) to 2000 (50,488).

Taxco&#x27;s development indicators are fairly good relative to other towns and cities in Mexico. , approximately 38% of residents aged 15 and over lacked a basic education (including 17% who did not finish primary education), and approximately 6% of residents aged 15 and over were illiterate. Approximately 87% of homes had refrigerators, and 51% had washing machines. Approximately 8% of homes lacked piped water, and 5% had a dirt floor.

===Economy and transportation===

Silverwork and tourism related to Taxco&#x27;s status as a silver town is the mainstay of the economy. Mining is no longer a major employer in the city; the last major mining operation on the outskirts of town, Industrial Minera México S.A., phased out operations beginning in 2007 due to the depletion of reserves and labor problems. Most commercial activity related to silver is the production and sale of silver jewelry, silverware and other goods. Commerce in silver here is both regional and international. Streets in the town are filled with silvershops selling jewelry, silverware and other goods. The city has been named one of Mexico&#x27;s &quot;Pueblos Mágicos&quot; (Magical Towns) due to the quality of the silverwork, the colonial constructions and the surrounding scenery.

Taxco lies along Mexican Federal Highway 95 and the toll road Mexican Federal Highway 95D. Taxco has two long-distance bus stations: the Terminal Estrella de Oro in the south and the Autobuses Estrella Blanca station in the northeast. There is no airport in Taxco. Transport within Taxco is generally by taxi, or &quot;Kombis&quot;—converted Volkswagen vans that serve as minibuses.

====Influential silver designers====

Taxco was home to many influential and popular designers and silversmiths specifically in the early and mid 20th century. One of the most prominent figures in popularizing Taxco silver was the famous American artist and architect William Spratling. Spratling discovered Taxco in 1929 and was amazed by the artisanal traditions and craftsmanship employed by the local silversmiths. Prior to Spratling&#x27;s arrival, Taxco was mostly a silver mining town but was not known for silver designing. He visited the nearby town of Iguala and enlisted the help of master silversmiths Artemio Navarrete, Alfonso Mondragón, and Wenceslao Herrera Spratling&#x27;s first workshop was set up on Calle de Las Delicias in Taxco. Some modern day designers including Reveka Rose and AtomicDrip still employ original techniques popularized by Spratling and his students to create modern day pieces with silver sourced from Taxco. Today, over 3,000 silversmith artisans call Taxco home. This is a testament to the influence that Spratling had on making Taxco the proclaimed Silver Capital of the World.

==Culture==

Holy Week in Taxco involves elaborate processions and ceremonies that have gained international fame. Between Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday, there are ten major processions, six during the evening and four during the day. Most processions are about two and a half kilometers long and take about two hours to complete. These commemorations date back to at least 1622 when they began in the atrium of the Church of the former monastery of San Bernardino de Siena. Now these processions and ceremonies center upon the Santa Prisca Church.

Other notable events include the San Antonio Abad Festival in January, the Jornadas Alarconianas (Alarconian Days) in May, the Jumil Festival in October, and the National Silver Fair in late November and early December.

Maize is a staple of food in Taxco. Common dishes include pozole and tacos. Dishes distinctive of Taxco include jumiles (a type of stink bug) prepared in tacos or Mole sauce, cecina (a cured meat), plum and bean tamales, and a drink called berta (honey margarita). Criollo cheese is a local specialty.

Basketball is the most popular sport in Taxco Municipality. In the city of Taxco, there are basketball, volleyball, and tennis courts, as well as soccer fields.

==Main sights==

The city of Taxco lies on very rugged terrain and has steep, irregular streets. The streets are also narrow and generally lack sidewalks, making them picturesque but dangerous. Adding to the charm is that most streets are paved with dark stones, adorned with lines, pictures and even murals of white stone. Some of the pictures in the street are from the Zodiac and meant to indicate certain commercial activities in times past. One example of this is the sign of Taurus near the Church of Santa Prisca, which used to indicate the area of butcher shops. Buildings in the city typically have Spanish-style, red-tile roofs.

The town&#x27;s main plaza, officially called Plaza Borda after José de la Borda, is commonly referred to as the Zócalo. On the north side of this plaza is the Casa Borda (Borda House), the most important non-religious construction in the city. The front facing the Zócalo has two stories, but the back, facing the Plaza de Bernal, has five. This is due to the uneven ground on which the house was built. Much of the house is now dedicated to the Casa de Cultura (Cultural Center) where classes in languages, fine arts and sports such as judo are taught. The rest of the main plaza is surrounded by silver shops, restaurants and bars.
The Parish of Santa Prisca y San Sebastián, commonly referred to as the Santa Prisca Church, is located on the east side of the main plaza of Taxco, and is one of the few Baroque buildings in the state of Guerrero. It was built between 1751 and 1758 by José de la Borda (ca. 1700–1778), who had made a great fortune in the silver mines surrounding the town. Despite his wealth, however, the opulence of the church nearly bankrupted him. It is built with pink stone, flanked by two towers which are plain in the lower half but highly decorated in the upper bell portions. The cupola is covered in colored tile. Inside, there are a number of floor-to-ceiling altarpieces, all covered in gold.

Near the main plaza are two museums: the William Spratling Museum, which contains silver and archeological pieces from Spratling&#x27;s personal collection, and the Museum of Viceregal Art. The Museum of Viceregal Art is located in the &quot;Humboldt House&quot;, named so because German writer Alexander Von Humboldt spent a night here in 1803. This house was restored in 1991 to become the Museum of Viceregal Art and contains colonial period art and artifacts, some of which belonged to José de la Borda.

Two other churches of note are the Church of the former monastery of San Bernardino de Siena, and the Church of Veracruz. The Church of the former monastery of San Bernardino de Siena is the oldest in the area, constructed at the end of the 16th century and restored in the 19th after a fire. This convent&#x27;s orchard is now the garden of the Posada San Javier Hotel. The Church of Veracruz is located on the Plazuela de la Veracruz on Juan Ruiz de Alarcón. Its principal attraction is an image of Christ which is nicknamed &quot;The General&quot;. This plaza is one of three that house monuments to the playwright Juan Ruiz de Alarcón, who was born in a house near here.

On the north side of town is one of the major colonial period silver haciendas, the Ex Hacienda del Chorrillo. The hacienda was constructed by knights of Hernán Cortés and is one of the oldest in the region. Its aqueduct, built in 1534, is partially preserved.

<text>The Walt Disney Concert Hall at 111 South Grand Avenue in downtown Los Angeles, California, is the fourth hall of the Los Angeles Music Center and was designed by Frank Gehry. It was opened on October 23, 2003. Bounded by Hope Street, Grand Avenue, and 1st and 2nd Streets, it seats 2,265 people and serves, among other purposes, as the home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestra and the Los Angeles Master Chorale. The hall is a compromise between a vineyard-style seating configuration, like the by Hans Scharoun, and a classical shoebox design like the Vienna Musikverein or the Boston Symphony Hall.

Lillian Disney made an initial gift of $50 million in 1987 to build a performance venue as a gift to the people of Los Angeles and a tribute to Walt Disney&#x27;s devotion to the arts and to the city. Both Gehry&#x27;s architecture and the acoustics of the concert hall, designed by Minoru Nagata, the final completion supervised by Nagata&#x27;s assistant and protege Yasuhisa Toyota, have been praised, in contrast to its predecessor, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.

==Design==
The Walt Disney Concert Hall was designed by world-renowned architect Frank Gehry. Despite being a well-accomplished architect at the time of design, Gehry found himself an unlikely candidate for the job when the Disney family was looking for the hall&#x27;s designer. Even with the location of the Walt Disney Concert Hall set to be in his hometown of Los Angeles, California, Gehry, when discussing his thoughts at the time the architect was selected, said, &quot;it was the least likely thing that I thought would ever happen to me in my life&quot;. Gehry&#x27;s opinion was supported by the representative of the Disney family. Gehry says he was told, &quot;that under no circumstances would Walt Disney&#x27;s name be on any buildings that I design&quot;. Much of this doubt came from Gehry&#x27;s reputation for relying on the use of cheap materials in his architecture that were used in unconventional ways. With the Walt Disney Concert Hall being a project that demanded a high budget and an elegant style, Gehry did not seem like the right candidate for the job. However, Gehry&#x27;s determination landed him the job of designing the hall, as he produced a design that caught the eye of Walt Disney&#x27;s widow, Lilian. His design included some of the elements of the deconstructivist architecture that he was known for, while still producing an elegant structure.

== Construction ==

The project was initiated in 1987, when Lillian Disney, widow of Walt Disney, donated $50 million. Frank Gehry delivered completed designs in 1991. Construction of the underground parking garage began in 1992 and was completed in 1996. The garage cost had been $110 million, and was paid for by Los Angeles County, which sold bonds to provide the garage under the site of the planned hall. Construction of the concert hall itself stalled from 1994 to 1996 due to lack of fundraising. Additional funds were required since the construction cost of the final project far exceeded the original budget. Plans were revised, and in a cost-saving move the originally designed stone exterior was replaced with a less costly stainless steel skin. The needed fundraising restarted in earnest in 1996, headed by Eli Broad and then-mayor Richard Riordan. Groundbreaking for the hall was held in December 1999. Delay in the project completion caused many financial problems for the county of LA. The County expected to repay the garage debts by revenue coming from the Disney Hall parking users.

Due to the mathematical complexity of Gehry&#x27;s innovative design, he relied on computer software to produce his design in a way that could be completed by contractors. The technology, called CATIA (computer-aided three-dimensional interactive application) is typically used in the design process for French fighter jets, but its mathematical ability aided Gehry in his process of designing the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Perhaps it is the angle-based design of the concert hall that required the use of CATIA, which can be seen on the exterior of the building. For example, the box columns on the north side of the Walt Disney Concert Hall are tilted forward at seventeen degrees. The angular design was used by Gehry to &quot;symbolize musical movement and the motion of Los Angeles&quot;.

Upon completion in 2003, the project cost an estimated $274 million; the parking garage alone cost $110 million. The remainder of the total cost was paid by private donations, of which the Disney family&#x27;s contribution was estimated at $84.5 million with another $25 million from The Walt Disney Company. By comparison, the three existing halls of the Music Center cost $35 million in the 1960s (about $330 million in 2021 dollars).

== Acoustics ==

As construction finished in the spring of 2003, the Philharmonic postponed its grand opening until the fall and used the summer to let the orchestra and Master Chorale adjust to the new hall. Performers and critics agreed that it was well worth this extra time taken by the time the hall opened to the public. During the summer rehearsals a few hundred VIPs were invited to sit in including donors, board members and journalists. Writing about these rehearsals, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; music critic Mark Swed wrote the following account:

The hall met with laudatory approval from nearly all of its listeners, including its performers. In an interview with PBS, Esa-Pekka Salonen, former music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, said, &quot;The sound, of course, was my greatest concern, but now I am totally happy, and so is the orchestra,&quot; and later said, &quot;Everyone can now hear what the L.A. Phil is supposed to sound like.&quot; This remains one of the most successful grand openings of a concert hall in American history.

As he was designing the Walt Disney Concert Hall, Gehry committed to producing a building that would promote the best acoustics possible. In order to do this, Gehry used ratios to test the acoustics of a model of the building, which was a 1:10 replica. Gehry had to scale all elements of the design accordingly, including the sound that he pumped into the model. Gehry reduced the wavelength of the sounds by a factor of ten in order to discover how his design would respond to the orchestras that would later perform in it to provide the best possible acoustics.

The walls and ceiling of the hall are finished with Douglas-fir while the floor is finished with oak. Columbia Showcase &amp; Cabinet Co. Inc., based in Sun Valley, CA, produced all of the ceiling panels, wall panels and architectural woodwork for the main auditorium and lobbies. The Hall&#x27;s reverberation time is approximately 2.2 seconds unoccupied and 2.0 seconds occupied.

===Regional Connector tunnel===
Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority had an agreement with the Los Angeles Music Center to use the most advanced noise-suppression measures for construction of the Regional Connector subway under 2nd Street where it passes the hall and the Colburn School of Music. Metro used procedures to ensure that the rumble of trains did not intrude on the sound quality of recordings made in the venues or mar audiences&#x27; musical experience within this sensitive stretch of the tunnel. Metro also built an elevated walkway from the Grand Avenue Arts/Bunker Hill station to the concert hall.

== Reflection problems ==
Originally, Frank Gehry had designed the Disney Concert Hall with a facade of stone, because &quot;at night stone would glow,&quot; he told interviewer Barbara Isenberg. &quot;Disney Hall would look beautiful at night in stone. It would have just been great. It would have been friendly. Metal at night goes dark. I begged them. No, after they saw Bilbao, they had to have metal.&quot;

After the construction, modifications were made to the Founders Room exterior; while most of the building&#x27;s exterior was designed with stainless steel given a matte finish, the Founders Room and Children&#x27;s Amphitheater were designed with highly polished mirror-like panels. The reflective qualities of the surface were amplified by the concave sections of the Founders Room walls. Some residents of the neighboring condominiums suffered glare caused by sunlight that was reflected off these surfaces and concentrated in a manner similar to a parabolic mirror. The resulting heat made some rooms of nearby condominiums unbearably warm, caused the air-conditioning costs of these residents to skyrocket and created hot spots on adjacent sidewalks of as much as . There was also the increased risk of traffic accidents due to blinding sunlight reflected from the polished surfaces. After complaints from neighboring buildings and residents, the owners asked Gehry Partners to come up with a solution. Their response was a computer analysis of the building&#x27;s surfaces identifying the offending panels. In 2005, these were dulled by lightly sanding the panels to eliminate unwanted glare.

== Concert organ ==
The design of the hall included a large concert organ, completed in 2004, which was used in a special concert for the July 2004 National Convention of the American Guild of Organists. The organ had its public debut in a non-subscription recital performed by Frederick Swann on September 30, 2004, and its first public performance with the Philharmonic two days later in a concert featuring Todd Wilson.

The organ&#x27;s façade was designed by architect Frank Gehry in consultation with organ consultant and tonal designer Manuel Rosales. Gehry wanted a distinctive, unique design for the organ. He would submit design concepts to Rosales, who would then provide feedback. Many of Gehry&#x27;s early designs were fanciful, but impractical: Rosales said in an interview with Timothy Mangan of the &quot;Orange County Register&quot;, &quot;His [Gehry&#x27;s] earliest input would have created very bizarre musical results in the organ. Just as a taste, some of them would have had the console at the top and pipes upside down. There was another in which the pipes were in layers of arrays like fans. The pipes would have had to be made out of materials that wouldn&#x27;t work for pipes. We had our moments where we realized we were not going anywhere. As the design became more practical for me, it also became more boring for him.&quot; Then, Gehry came up with the curved wooden pipe concept, &quot;like a logjam kind of thing,&quot; says Rosales, &quot;turned sideways.&quot; This design turned out to be musically viable.

The organ was built by the German organ builder Caspar Glatter-Götz under the tonal direction and voicing of Manuel Rosales. It has an attached console built into the base of the instrument from which the pipes of the Positive, Great, and Swell manuals (keyboards) are playable by direct mechanical, or &quot;tracker&quot; key action, with the rest playing by electric key action; this console somewhat resembles North-German Baroque organs, and has a closed-circuit television monitor set into the music desk. It is also equipped with a detached, movable console, which can be moved about as easily as a grand piano, and plugged in at any of four positions on the stage, this console has terraced, curved &quot;amphitheatre&quot;-style stop-jambs resembling those of French Romantic organs, and is built with a low profile, with the music desk entirely above the top of the console, for the sake of clear sight lines to the conductor. From the detached console, all ranks play by electric key and stop action.

In all, there are 72 stops, 109 ranks, and 6,125 pipes; pipes range in size from a few inches/centimeters to the longest being 32 feet (9.75m) (which has a frequency of 16 hertz).

The organ is a gift to the County of Los Angeles from Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (the U.S. sales, marketing, service, and distribution arm of Toyota Motor Corporation).

<text>Phoenix is an unincorporated community located in Baltimore County in the State of Maryland, United States. It is located at latitude 39°30&#x27;59&quot; North, longitude 76°36&#x27;59&quot; West. The United States Postal Service has assigned Phoenix the ZIP code 21131.

Part of the area is also known as Jacksonville, although Jacksonville was once a separate community to the east.

Hunt Valley Golf Club, an 18-hole private golf course, is located in Phoenix. The NCR Trail also runs through Phoenix, which hosts one of the rail trail&#x27;s major parking lots.

Phoenix has an elementary school, Jacksonville Elementary. It also has the Jacksonville Senior Center. The center hosts a variety of activities for seniors age 60 and over and is open five days a week. There is a fitness studio, multipurpose room with kitchen, classrooms, and staff and council offices.

Fashion designer Jhane Barnes was born in Phoenix.

One of the world&#x27;s largest demolition firms, Controlled Demolition, Inc., is headquartered in Phoenix.

==MTBE spill==

Phoenix was the location of a January 2006 Exxon Mobil gas leak, in which over 26,000 gallons of gas seeped out of a punctured pipe at a station at the intersection of Maryland routes 145 and 146. The area affected by the gas leak was approximately one-half mile downhill from the location of the gas station. Six wells were contaminated, and 62 residential wells showed traces of MTBE. The state filed a $12 million suit against Exxon Mobil in April 2006. In September 2008, the state settled the case with Exxon Mobil, imposing a $4 million civil penalty. In addition, about 300 Jacksonville residents sought compensatory and punitive damages from the company worth several billion dollars. A jury awarded the plaintiffs $1B in punitive damages, which decision was later reversed. This was the largest amount of money ever awarded in history involving oil spills. In March 2009, a Baltimore County jury found Exxon Mobil liable and awarded compensatory damages to the plaintiffs. Several other cases were ongoing as of 2015.

<text>A piñata (, ) is a container, often made of papier-mâché, pottery, or cloth, that is decorated, filled with candy, and then broken as part of a celebration. Piñatas are commonly associated with Mexico.

The idea of breaking a container filled with treats came to Europe in the 14th century. The Spanish brought the European tradition to Mexico, although there were similar traditions in Mesoamerica, such as the Aztecs&#x27; honoring the birthday of the god Huītzilōpōchtli in mid-December. According to local records, the Mexican piñata tradition began in the town of Acolman, just north of Mexico City, where piñatas were introduced for catechism purposes as well as to co-opt the Huitzilopochtli ceremony.

Today, the piñata is still part of Mexican culture, the cultures of other countries in Latin America, as well as the United States, but it has mostly lost its religious character.

==Etymology==
The Spanish word probably derives from the Italian &#x27;fragile pot,&#x27; itself from It may also come from Spanish 

==History==

Although today, piñatas are typically used for a fun activity at parties, their origins lie in other customs. There is some debate but it appears that their origin is not Spanish but Chinese. The Chinese version was in the shape of a cow or ox and used for the New Year. It was decorated with symbols and colors meant to produce a favorable climate for the coming growing season. It was filled with five types of seeds and then hit with sticks of various colors. After the piñata was broken, the remains were burned and the ashes kept for good luck.

The tradition arrived in Europe in the 14th century where it was associated with the Christian celebration of Lent; in Spain, the First Sunday of Lent, &quot;Piñata Sunday&quot;, became a celebration known as the Dance of the Piñata. As the word&#x27;s Italian origin indicates, &quot;pignatta&quot; (also &quot;pignata&quot; and &quot;pignàta&quot;) meaning &quot;earthenware cooking pot&quot;, the Spanish initially used a plain clay container, before starting to decorate it with ribbons, tinsel and colored paper. The origin of the Italian word is thought to be linked to the Latin word &quot;pinea&quot;, &quot;pine cone&quot;.

The European piñata tradition was brought to Mexico in the 16th century; however, there was a similar tradition in Mesoamerica already. The Mayan tradition was similar to the modern piñata tradition, including blindfolding the participant hitting the piñata. The Aztec tradition commemorated the birthday of Huitzilopochtli. Priests would decorate a clay pot with colorful feathers. When the pot was broken with a stick or club, the treasures inside would fall to the feet of the idol as an offering. According to local records, the piñata was first used for the purposes of evangelism in 1586, in Acolman, in the modern State of Mexico, just north of Mexico City. The Augustinian monks there modified European piñatas and created the Las Posadas tradition to co-opt the celebration of the birth of Huitzilopochtli, which was celebrated in mid December.

The Mexican Catholic interpretation assigned meanings related to the Catholic doctrine of struggle against temptation, and used for catechism purposes. In this tradition, the seven points represent the seven deadly sins, the pot represents evil, and the seasonal fruit and candy inside the temptations of evil. It was said that person with the stick is blindfolded to represent faith, and the turning, singing and shouting represent the disorientation that temptation creates. In some traditions, the participant is turned thirty three times, one for each year of Christ&#x27;s life. As the participant beats the piñata, it is supposed to represent the struggle against temptation and evil. When the piñata breaks, some say (contrary to other interpretations) the treats inside then represent the rewards of keeping the faith.

Since that time, the piñata has not retained its religious significance and has become popular in many types of celebrations, not just during December&#x27;s Las Posadas. The clay pot has been replaced with a papier-mâché container. The creation of piñatas has even taken on an artistic aspect in some areas. David Gamez and Cecilia Meade sponsored a showing of piñatas as art rather than just as a party favor. The 2010 event was called Piñatarama, with 25 piñatas made of papier-mâché at the Vértigo Galería in Mexico City, all original works of art by graphic illustrators, from 23 countries including Australia. Some of the illustrators who participated include 1000 Changos, Allan Sieber, Apak, Ben Newman, Cecy Meade, Cristian Turdera, Cupco and Daniel Berman. In Tepatitlán, the world&#x27;s largest traditional seven-pointed piñata was created in 2010. It measures 11.2 meters, is made of fiberglass and weighs 350 kilograms. It surpasses the former Guinness record holder which was made in 2008 in Pennsylvania.

==In Mexico==

The piñata is most strongly identified with Mexico. The art of making modern piñatas falls under the Mexican craft heading of &quot;cartonería&quot;, which refers to the making of items from paper and cardboard. This puts piñatas in the same category as amate paper craft, Judas figures and Mexico City style alebrijes. The Museo de Arte Popular held the first &quot;Concurso de Piñatas Mexicanas&quot; (Mexican Piñata Contest) in 2007 with prizes of 15,000, 10,000 and 5,000 pesos. The purpose of the contest is to help retain this tradition and help it to be continued to be valued. The Museo del Caracol in Mexico City held a workshop on how to make traditional piñatas, as part of its outreach program to the public.

While the religious significance has been mostly lost, the ceremony that occurs with it has remained mostly intact. Piñatas remain most popular during Las Posadas with birthday parties coming in second. Each participant, usually a child, will have a turn at hitting the piñata, which is hung from above on a string. The participant is blindfolded, given a wooden stick, and then spun a number of times. As the participants works to hit the piñata, another moves it to make it harder to hit. There is a time limit to any one person&#x27;s attempts, which is marked out by the singing of a traditional song, &quot;Dale, dale, dale, no pierdas el tino&quot;.

Piñatas were traditionally made with a clay pot base and many artisans make a living selling just the pot for people to decorate as they wish. However, clay pot piñatas have mostly been replaced by those made with cardboard and papier-mâché, usually fashioned over balloons. One reason for this is that broken pot pieces can be dangerous to children. These are then decorated with crepe paper, other colored paper and other items. Piñatas today come in all shapes and sizes, with many representing cartoon or other characters known to most children. Popular shapes today can include Batman, Superman, Spider-Man or characters based on popular movies and television shows such as Nemo, the Lion King and more. For Christmas, the traditional style with the points is popular as it is associated with the Star of Bethlehem. However, for the most part, piñata designs have been completely commercialized.
Traditionally in Mexico, especially at Christmas, piñatas are filled with fruit and candies such as guavas, oranges, jicamas, pieces of sugar cane, tejocotes and wrapped candies. Some piñatas are &quot;traps&quot; filled with flour, confetti or water. Special baskets of treats may be given to children who come up empty handed after a piñata is broken. These are called colaciónes and are given to prevent hurt feelings.

There are a number of localities in Mexico that specialize in the making of piñatas for sale. Acolman, the origin of piñatas, along with neighboring Otumba are one. Acolman hosts an annual National Piñata Fair. This event includes cultural events, workshops on the making of piñatas, piñata contests and traditional Posadas. The event has attracted as many as 100,000 visitors over the days that it is held, many of whom come from Mexico City.

About 400 families in the town of San Juan de la Puerta, in the south of the Cuerámaro municipality in Guanajuato, are dedicated to the creation of piñatas, and produce about 16,000 pieces each month. The making of piñatas supports about half of the people in the town. It is the second most important economic activity after agriculture. This tradition began in 1960 by Juan Remigio Anguiano, who brought the craft to the town after living in Mexico City. Today, piñatas from the town are sold in various parts of the state.

In the penal facility of Huajuapan de León, prisoners make piñatas to sell. This began when several prisoners brought the craft with them when they were incarcerated about twenty years ago. These piñatas have become traditional for the population of the city for Christmas.

The busiest time for the sale of piñatas in Mexico is December for posadas. During bad economic times, sales of piñatas can fall as much as thirty percent as they did in 2008.

The star shape, or ball with points, still remains popular for the Christmas season, but for other events, traditional designs such as donkeys have almost entirely been replaced by cartoon characters based on U.S. movies and television shows. However, most of the piñatas produced based on these images are not following copyright law, which has caused problems. Copyright holders such as Marvel Comics have complained about infringement by piñata makers in Mexico. Federal authorities have responded by seizing such merchandise in stores in various areas of Mexico City. Vendors complain that they have sold these piñatas for decades and never have had problems. Those who have run into problems with copyright law state that it is difficult to sell other types as most customers prefer to buy those based on popular characters. Mexico exports piñatas to the United States and other parts of the world, but copyright has been an issue there as well. Piñatas based on Disney and other characters have been seized at the border for violating U.S. copyright law. Some have also been seized and destroyed by customs agents under suspect of hiding drugs.

One niche market for piñatas in Mexico is of those themed for adults. These include political figures, especially those who are not particularly liked. Another type for the adult market are sexually-themed piñatas, mostly those in the form of exotic dancers and strippers. Of the female of this type, the most popular are blondes. For the male, darker shades are preferred. These piñatas will be filled with adult items such as condoms in addition to candy.

Piñatas are similarly popular in a number of other Latin American countries as well.

==In the United States==
Piñatas have also become popular in Mexican-American and other Hispanic and Latino communities in the United States, as well as non-Hispanic populations. They are used for birthday parties, Christmas and Cinco de Mayo celebrations.

The 2006 video game &quot;Viva Piñata&quot; is about a world where piñatas compete to be chosen for children&#x27;s birthday parties. A spinoff television show, also titled &quot;Viva Piñata&quot; was created to push sales of the Xbox game created by Microsoft.

==Similar traditions==

=== Europe ===
A similar tradition in Denmark is slå katten af tønden (&quot;hit the cat out of the barrel&quot;) in which a wooden barrel is struck to release candy.

In Catalonia, a Christmastide tradition known as &quot;fer cagar el tió&quot; (&quot;making the log defecate&quot;) is observed. A log is wrapped with a blanket several days in advance of Christmas and is &quot;fed&quot; grass. On Christmas Eve, the log is repeatedly struck with sticks in order to make the log &quot;defecate&quot;. The blanket is then removed to reveal the gifts that have been &quot;expelled&quot; by the log.

In Italy feasts with a game similar to &quot;piñata&quot;, called &quot;pentolaccia&quot;, used to be celebrated the first Sunday of Lent.

=== Asia ===
In Maharashtra, India, another similar tradition called Dahi Handi is observed on the festival of Janmashtami, Lord Krishna&#x27;s birthday. The iconography represents Lord Krishna&#x27;s childhood portrayal as the mischievous &quot;Maakhan Chor&quot; (butter thief). Clay pots filled with buttermilk, money or treats, in lieu of butter, are hung in public squares or on streets at a height implicitly challenging youngsters to break them. Teams put in great planning, skill and effort to form human pyramids, each higher than the other, in an attempt to break the pot and claim the prize.

In South Indian villages, festivals feature a competition called Uri adithal (Pot breaking with blindfold) which closely resembles the piñata event.

In Japan, a similar game called suikawari is played where a watermelon shell is used.

The Philippines has a pinata-based game called &quot;hampas-palayok&quot; or &quot;pukpok-palayok&quot; (hit-the-pot), which is played during Filipino fiestas and traditional parties (e.g., birthdays). Unlike papier mache, a clay pot filled with treats and/or prizes is used. Historians state that the pinata was brought by Spanish colonizers when the Philippines was a colony of Spain.

Like the Philippines, Vietnamese traditional custom also features the game &quot;đập nêu&quot; (pot-hitting).

<doc id="347972" wikidata="Q2895685" url="?curid=347972" title="Orycteropodidae">
<text>Orycteropodidae is a family of afrotherian mammals. Although there are many fossil species, the only species surviving today is the aardvark, &quot;Orycteropus afer&quot;. Orycteropodidae is recognized as the only family within the order Tubulidentata, from the Latin words &quot;tubulis&quot; (tubule) and &quot;dentis&quot; (tooth), referring to the tubule-style teeth., so the two are effectively synonyms.

==Evolution==
The first aardvark fossil discovered was originally named &quot;Orycteropus gaudryi&quot; (now &quot;Amphiorycteropus&quot;) and was found in Turolian deposits on the island of Samos. Since then, representatives of the order Tubulidentata have been located from the Oligocene in what is now Europe, and it is believed that the order probably originated around 65–70 million years ago or in the Paleocene. They are thought to be closely related to the now extinct Ptolemaiida, a lineage of carnivorous afrotheres. The family arose in Africa in the Early Miocene epoch, and spread to Eurasia later in the Miocene. Most of the family&#x27;s diversity had become extinct by the end of the Pliocene.

== Characteristics ==

Aardvarks had originally been categorized as relatives of American anteaters in the order Edentata. But their unique type of teeth and other morphological characteristics had made it clear that aardvarks are not closely related to any other living mammals. Since the end of the 19th century, they are placed in their own separate order Tubulidentata. Both the fossil record and genetic studies have corroborated that separate status. All similarities to American anteaters have evolved independently as adaptations to eating ants.

One of the most distinctive features of the animals is that their teeth have a &quot;tubulidentate&quot; microstructure, lacking enamel, and are just rounded structures of dentine. They lack incisors and canines, and have 20–22 teeth, which are evergrowing, unrooted, and diphyodont. Another unique trait is that their small milk teeth are lost before the animal is born.

A few anatomical characters unite the Orycteropodidae and Tubulidentata. The occipital region of the skull has extensive mastoid exposure, the femur has a pectineal tubercle, and the diaphysis of the tibia is curved mediolaterally.

Modern aardvarks are polygynous, the females providing care for the young. They are territorial, and only cross paths to breed. The males&#x27; genitals create a musk while females create this musk from glands in their elbows, this scent helps mating occur. The gestation period lasts about seven months, and they are dependent upon the mother until they are six months of age, becoming sexually mature at two years of age. Breeding occurs once a year, they produce one offspring, and will have maybe one to two more in their lifetime. Aardvarks are myrmecophagous, feeding almost exclusively on termites and ants. They rely on their sense of smell to find most of their food and hunt at night.

<text>Suffocation is an American death metal band formed in 1988 in Centereach, New York, currently consisting of lead guitarist Terrance Hobbs, bassist Derek Boyer, rhythm guitarist Charlie Errigo, drummer Eric Morotti, and vocalist Ricky Myers. The band rose to prominence with their 1991 debut album &quot;Effigy of the Forgotten&quot;, which became a blueprint for death metal in the 1990s. Since then, Suffocation has recorded eight albums. These feature growled vocals with downtuned guitars, fast and complex guitar riffs and drumming, open chord notes and occasional breakdowns.

==History==

===Early years (1988–1990)===
Suffocation was formed in 1988 in Long Island, New York, by vocalist Frank Mullen, guitarists Guy Marchais and Todd German, bassist Josh Barohn, and a drummer whose name has not been disclosed. By 1990, the band had replaced their founding members with hired guitarists Terrance Hobbs and Doug Cerrito along with drummer Mike Smith, who were members of a local band called Mortuary, which had already disbanded. The quintet was mainly influenced by fellow American death metal bands as well as Britain&#x27;s Napalm Death and Brazil&#x27;s Sepultura. Suffocation would be unique among the death metal community for featuring African-American musicians in their lineup, with Smith commenting on meeting Hobbs for the first time: &quot;That&#x27;s where I first noticed, &#x27;Wow, there&#x27;s another black guy playing this kind of stuff.&#x27;&quot; They signed a contract with Relapse Records in 1990, becoming one of the first three bands to sign onto the newly founded label alongside Incantation and Deceased.

===&quot;Human Waste&quot; and &quot;Effigy of the Forgotten&quot; (1991–1992)===
The band&#x27;s first EP, &quot;Human Waste&quot;, was released through Relapse Records in 1991. The first full-length debut album, &quot;Effigy of the Forgotten&quot;, was recorded by producer Scott Burns at Tampa&#x27;s Morrisound Studios and released by Roadrunner Records in 1991. The album took a week to produce, and was recorded on a budget of $5,000. Hobbs said of the experience, &quot;To know that Deicide, Death, Morbid Angel and all those bands were in that studio was a super amazing experience [...] Florida was a big thing; that was like our Mecca. For us to go down to Morrisound, recording with Scott Burns, an amazing engineer, was just unbelievable.&quot;

Though it initially received mixed reviews from critics, &quot;Effigy of the Forgotten&quot; would later gain acclaim and become greatly influential in extreme metal music, influencing the technical death metal and slam death metal genres. In 2004, the album was voted as the 342nd greatest metal album of all time in Martin Popoff&#x27;s book of &quot;The Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

In July 1991, founding bassist John Barohn was replaced by Chris Richards (ex Apparition/Sorrow), leaving the band to join Autopsy.

===&quot;Breeding the Spawn, Pierced from Within&quot;, and hiatus (1993–1995)===
In 1993, the sophomore album &quot;Breeding the Spawn&quot; was released, its production and mixing being a key weak point that would be immediately harshly criticized. Originally, the band was due to return to Morrisound and record the album with Scott Burns, but Roadrunner was unwilling to fund the album properly and refused to pay for the studio time, forcing them to record elsewhere. After this album, drummer Mike Smith left the band, the situation with the recording process for this album being a major reason for him leaving the band, and was replaced by Doug Bohn. Tracks of &quot;Breeding the Spawn&quot; would be re-recorded in future Suffocation releases.

The 1995 release &quot;Pierced from Within&quot;, which received better production than the previous release, was followed by extensive tours in Europe, Canada, Mexico and the United States. In 1998, Suffocation released the EP &quot;Despise the Sun&quot; via Vulture Records and disbanded soon after. The EP was re-released later in 2000 and 2002 by Relapse Records.

=== Reunion and later years (2003–present) ===

Mullen and Hobbs reformed in 2003 with Smith, returning founding members Guy Marchais on guitar, and Josh Barohn on bass. Barohn would not last long, and left the band soon. Suffocation would then hire bassist Derek Boyer of the bands Deeds of Flesh and Decrepit Birth. In April 2004, Relapse Records released &quot;Souls to Deny&quot;. After the band played more than 400 shows in the United States and Europe including the Wacken Festival in Germany, playing to over 33,000 fans, Suffocation released their self-titled album, &quot;Suffocation&quot;, in 2006. In 2007, the band was featured in The History Channel&#x27;s promotional video for &quot;The Dark Ages&quot; documentary, playing the song &quot;Bind, Torture, Kill&quot;.

In 2008, the band signed to the German Nuclear Blast Records and released their album &quot;Blood Oath&quot; in 2009. The album charted on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 135. In 2009, Relapse released the live album entitled &quot;Close of a Chapter—Live in Québec City&quot;, that was previously self-released by the band in 2005. The release of a documentary film &quot;Legacy of Violence&quot; was set for 2010, but has since been delayed. In May 2010, Suffocation toured with Napalm Death in South America and Mexico. In February 2012, Smith left the band again, to be replaced by the returning Dave Culross.

In 2012, the band was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame and released &quot;Pinnacle of Bedlam&quot; in February 2013. Since after the release of &quot;Pinnacle of Bedlam&quot; in 2013, vocalist Frank Mullen announced that he will retire from full-time touring with the band due to his new job. He has since been replaced by various live vocal stand ins, including Bill Robinson, John Gallagher, Kevin Muller, and, currently, Ricky Myers.

In January 2015, Suffocation began making posts revealing that they were in the process of recording demos for a new album with a potential release date of late 2015. In April 2016, the ensemble toured with Soulfly, Abnormality, Battlecross and Lody Kong.

The new album&#x27;s name was revealed as &quot;...Of the Dark Light&quot; and was released on June 9, 2017. Later in 2017, Kevin Muller, who had previously been a touring member, joined the band full-time alongside longtime vocalist Frank Mullen leading the two to share vocal duties on the last album. He subsequently stepped down at the end of the year and was replaced by a returning Myers in 2018. On March 12, 2018, it was announced that Frank Mullen would do one more tour with Suffocation before officially retiring from the band. They were joined by Cattle Decapitation and Krisiun on this tour. On January 15, 2019, it was announced that Mullen would return in June 2019 for a final tour of Japan.

On September 12, 2023, the band announced their ninth album, &quot;Hymns from the Apocrypha&quot;, would be released on November 3. The album won the Album Of The Month designation at Metallian. The band began touring in support of the new release immediately.

==Musical style, influences and legacy==
Suffocation are considered by many to be one of the pioneers of technical death metal. Lead guitarist Terrance Hobbs shared his view on the subgenre&#x27;s development, recalling &quot;As bands started to get progressively faster, our ears really liked that [...] Going from thrash like Slayer, Destruction and Metallica to us was natural. We just wanted to go faster and faster.&quot; The band&#x27;s sound has also been said to contain elements of brutal death metal, thrash metal, speed metal, and grindcore. Guitarists Doug Cerrito and Terrance Hobbs have been referred to as &quot;the guitar duo from hell,&quot; drawing comparisons to Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman of Slayer.

Suffocation uses &quot;outrageously guttural vocals with a bottom-heavy guitar foundation, blistering speed, unparalleled brutality and sophisticated sense of songwriting, complex time changes and lead and rhythm guitar acrobatics&quot; and occasional slam riffs and breakdowns. 

With their debut album, &quot;Effigy of the Forgotten&quot; (1991), Suffocation rose to prominence in death metal and created a blueprint for the genre for the 1990s, retaining their style after the reunion in 2003. &quot;Decibel Magazine&quot; stated: &quot;&quot;Effigy of the Forgotten&quot; was a benchmark for extreme music, as it sacrificed neither virtuosity or brutality, becoming a signpost for thousands who were still contemplating how to incorporate scalar runs, rapid-fire palm-muting and hummingbird-wing-quick picking into riffs, while opening up rhythmic dimensions and the scope of the blast beat.&quot;

Blabbermouth.net described Suffocation as &quot;American death metal&#x27;s most consistent and punishing standard-bearers&quot; and their style as &quot;brutal death metal&quot;. Leslie Mathew of Allmusic stated Mullen is one of the best vocalists in the genre. &quot;Decibel Magazine&quot; stated: &quot;One of Suffocation&#x27;s trademarks, breakdowns, has spawned an entire metal subgenre: deathcore.&quot;

Leslie Mathew of AllMusic conferred the title of &quot;the connoisseur&#x27;s death metal band&quot; on Suffocation.

Guitarist Terrance Hobbs has cited Slayer, Destruction, Death, King Diamond, Atheist, and Metallica as early influences on the band&#x27;s sound. He also cited &quot;stadium rockers&quot; such as Ozzy Osbourne, Led Zeppelin and Iron Maiden as having influenced various elements of the band&#x27;s craft. He said, &quot;musically, if it was in that thrash metal, hardcore, death metal-type vein, we were into it, and I think we were playing off all that.&quot;

<doc id="347998" wikidata="Q435352" url="?curid=347998" title="Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus">
<text>Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus (or Rullus) was a patrician, politician and soldier of the Roman Republic during the fourth and early third century BC. He was the son of Marcus Fabius Ambustus, of the patrician Fabii, was five times consul, dictator once (possibly twice), censor, and a hero of the Samnite Wars. He was brother to Marcus Fabius Ambustus, who was named after their father, and the grandfather (or great-grandfather) of Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus (hero of the Second Punic War).

His first appearance in surviving records is as magister equitum in 325 BC, when he won a daring victory against the Samnites at Imbrinium. However, he had acted without the authority of the dictator Lucius Papirius Cursor, who was angry and demanded that the Senate punish Fabius for disobeying orders. Livy (8.31-36) describes a tense scene where Papirius stood nearly alone against the Senate and people, who supported Fabius because of his victory, but who also did not wish to undercut the absolute authority they had given Papirius; finally Fabius threw himself at the feet of the dictator and asked forgiveness, which was granted.

Fabius became consul for the first time in 322 BC, although little is said of his time in office. The following year (321) he serves a Interrex. He appears next as a dictator himself in 315 BC, successfully besieging Saticula and then, less successfully, fighting at Lautulae (Diodorus mentions another dictatorship in 313 BC, but this is probably mistaken). As consul in 310 BC, Fabius fought the Etruscans at Sutrium, then followed them when they fled into the Ciminian Forest and defeated them again. Consul again in 308 BC, he defeated Perusia and Nuceria Alfaterna.

He then served as censor with Decius Mus beginning in 304 BC. The last Lustrum was shortened to speed up Rullianus taking up the office, because they wanted him overturn the reforms Appius Claudius Caecus had instituted during his censorship. Caecus had admitted citizens without property (a very numerous group) to all Roman tribes; Rullianus limited them to the four urban tribes and by doing so took away most of their newly achieved political power. For his censorship he received the cognomen &quot;Maximus&quot;, the first of his line to get the honorific name. A further measure he took was to institute an annual parade for the equites on the 15th of July.

Fabius was consul for the fourth time in 297 BC, defeating the Samnites at Tifernum by sending part of his line around the hills behind the enemy. In 296 BC, as Lucius Volumnius and Appius Claudius Caecus were consuls, he and Publius Decius Mus were made proconsul and their imperium was prolonged by six months. In 295 BC he was elected unanimously for a fifth term, where he won lasting fame for defeating a coalition of Etruscans, Samnites, and Gauls in the epic Battle of Sentinum.

Rullianus&#x27; son was Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges, and his grandson or great-grandson the famous Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, surnamed &quot;Cunctator&quot;, of the Second Punic War.

His son, Gurges, was defeated in Samnium and being spared a recall from the army and humiliation by the intervention of Rullianus who promised to help him as second-in-command (senior legate). The two men defeated the Samnites and captured Gaius Pontius, the Samnite commander, who was paraded in the triumph and beheaded.

Rullianus became Princeps Senatus in his later years.

Although Rullianus&#x27; fame is undoubted, the main source of his life is Livy, who in turn worked from annals by Fabius Pictor and others, and many of the details are suspiciously similar to stories of the Cunctator.

The agnomen (actually more likely an extra cognomen) &quot;Rullus&quot; appears to mean &quot;uncultivated, boorish&quot; or &quot;beggar&quot;.

<text>Zinovy Petrovich Rozhestvensky (, tr. ; – January 14, 1909) was a Russian admiral of the Imperial Russian Navy. He was in command of the Second Pacific Squadron in the Battle of Tsushima, during the Russo-Japanese War.

Under Admiral Rozhestvensky&#x27;s command, the Russian navy accomplished a feat of steaming an all-steel, coal-powered battleship fleet over one way to engage an enemy in decisive battle (the Battle of Tsushima, which ended in a disastrous defeat of the Russian force.) The , one of four brand-new battleships of the French-designed , was his flagship for the voyage to the Pacific.

==Early naval career==
Rozhestvensky was the son of a physician from St Petersburg, and joined the Imperial Russian Navy at the age of 17. He graduated from the Sea Cadet Corps, where he mastered English and French, in 1868, and the Mikhailovsky Artillery Academy in 1873. He initially served with the Baltic Fleet as a gunnery officer. In 1876 he transferred to the Black Sea Fleet.

During the Russo-Turkish War Rozhestvensky served on board the gunboat . On June 10, 1877, six torpedo boats, five of which were armed with spar torpedoes, attempted to attack four ironclads of the Ottoman Navy at Sulina. Rozhestvensky volunteered to lead the first attack against the Turkish warships but his torpedo boat became caught up in the &quot;rope boom&quot; defenses that protected the enemy ships. The attack was beaten back by Turkish gunfire which destroyed one torpedo boat and the remaining boats withdrew, leaving the enemy ironclads intact. In July 1877 while still assigned to &quot;Vesta&quot;, he engaged and damaged an Ottoman battleship, , in a five-hour battle. Rozhestvensky was awarded the Order of Saint Vladimir and Order of St George for this action and was promoted to lieutenant commander. However, after the war he revealed in a newspaper article that he had falsified his reports, and that the overloaded &quot;Feth-i Bülend&quot; escaped with only minor damage. This revelation had no adverse impact on his career.
From 1883 to 1885 Rozhestensky was seconded to the newly formed Bulgarian Navy. He also designed a defense plan for the Bulgarian coastline, and was one of the founders of the Technology Association of Bulgaria.

Rozhestvensky returned to Russian service and was senior officer on the battery ship &quot;Kreml&quot; and the cruiser . He then commanded the clipper &quot;Naezdnik&quot; and gunboat &quot;Grozyachiy&quot;. From 1891 to 1893 he was naval attaché to London. In 1894 he commanded the which was part of the Russian Mediterranean Squadron under the command of Admiral Stepan Makarov. From 1896 to 1898 he commanded the coast defence ship &quot;Pervenets&quot;. In 1898 he was promoted to rear admiral and became commander of the gunnery school of the Baltic Fleet. In 1900 he commanded the salvage operation for the . In 1902 he was appointed Chief of the Naval Staff and proposed a plan for strengthening the Imperial Russian Navy in the Far East.

==Russo-Japanese War==

Prior to the war against Japan starting in 1904, Rozhestvensky was commander of the Baltic Fleet. Tsar Nicholas II ordered Rozhestvensky to take the Baltic Fleet to East Asia to protect the Russian naval base of Port Arthur. The Tsar had selected the right man for the job, for it would take an iron-fisted commander to sail an untested fleet of brand new battleships (for some of the new &quot;Borodino&quot;s, this voyage was their shakedown cruise) and new untrained sailors on the longest coal-powered battleship fleet voyage in recorded history. Rozhestvensky had a fiery temper when dealing with a subordinate, and both officers and men knew to stand clear of &quot;Mad Dog&quot; when a subordinate either disobeyed orders, was incompetent, or both.

Rozhestvensky was fully aware that he had a new untrained fleet under his command and that re-coaling stations would not be available during the journey, due to Britain&#x27;s alliance with Japan; and that both the shakedown testing of the new battleships and the gunnery practice/training would have to occur during the voyage. Also, re-coaling would have to be done at sea, instead of in port as with most other navies. As a consequence of these circumstances, the mission-minded commander would sometimes fire service ammunition (live gunfire) across the bows of an errant warship, and in a fiery moment fling his binoculars from the bridge into the sea. When his battleship fleet set sail in 1904, Rozhestvensky&#x27;s staff ensured that his flagship, &quot;Knyaz Suvorov&quot;, had a good supply of binoculars on board.

Nevertheless, the inexperience of the Russian Baltic Fleet almost triggered a war between Russia and Great Britain as it sailed through the North Sea. After several Russian ships mistook British fishing trawlers at Dogger Bank for torpedo boats from the Imperial Japanese Navy, they opened fire on the unarmed civilian vessels. The Dogger Bank incident on the night of 21–22 October 1904 resulted in the deaths of three British fishermen and many wounded. One sailor and a priest aboard a Russian cruiser were also killed in the crossfire.

The Russian government agreed to investigate the incident following a great deal of international diplomatic pressure. Rozhestvensky was ordered to dock in Vigo, Spain, while battleships of the Royal Navy from the British Home Fleet were prepared for war. Several British cruiser squadrons shadowed Rozhestvensky&#x27;s fleet as it made its way through the Bay of Biscay. On arrival in Spain, Rozhestvensky left behind those officers he considered responsible for the incident (as well as at least one officer who had been critical of him). On November 25, 1904, the British and the Russian governments signed a joint agreement in which they agreed to submit the issue to an International Commission of Inquiry at The Hague. On February 26, 1905, the commission published its report. It criticized Rozhestvensky for allowing his ships to fire upon the British ships, but noted that &quot;as each [Russian] vessel swept the horizon in every direction with her searchlights to avoid being taken by surprise, it was difficult to prevent confusion&quot;. The report also concluded that once the mistake was known &quot;Admiral Rozhestvensky personally did everything he could, from beginning to end of the incident, to prevent [the trawlers] from being fired upon by the squadron&quot;. Russia eventually paid £66,000 (£5.8m today) in compensation.

Rozhestvensky believed from the start that the plan to send the Baltic Fleet to Port Arthur was ill-conceived, and vehemently opposed plans to include a motley collection of obsolete vessels, the Third Pacific Squadron to his fleet (referred to by the Admiral and his staff as the &#x27;self-sinkers&#x27;), to the extent of refusing to reveal to the Admiralty his exact routing from Madagascar and to share his battle plan with Third Pacific Squadron commander Nikolai Nebogatov. Remote and distrustful of his staff, Rozhestvensky grew increasingly bitter and pessimistic as he approached Asia.
Almost as soon as the Baltic Fleet arrived in the Far East in May 1905, it was engaged by the Japanese Navy at the decisive Battle of Tsushima (27–28 May 1905).

===Battle of Tsushima===
Japanese Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō drew upon his experiences from the battles of Port Arthur and the Yellow Sea, and this time would not split his fires nor engage Rozhestvensky at excessive ranges, as he had done with Admiral Vitgeft at the Battle of the Yellow Sea the year previously. He would instead, with the proper use of reconnaissance vessels and wireless communications position his battle fleet in such a way as to &quot;preserve his interior lines of movement&quot;, which would allow him to have shorter distances to cover while causing Rozhestvensky to have longer distances to travel, regardless of battleship speeds.

Naval intelligence had already informed Togo of Rozhestvensky&#x27;s mission, that of reaching Vladivostok, and avoiding contact with the Japanese navy if at all possible, and fighting as little as possible, if forced into it. Rozhestvensky&#x27;s objective was to reinforce the &quot;Vladivostok Squadron&quot;, and then, when the Russian navy felt sufficiently prepared, they would engage the Japanese navy in a decisive action.

With this knowledge in possession, Togo planned on preempting the Russian plan, by positioning his battle fleet to &quot;bring the Russian fleet to battle, regardless of the speed of either battlefleet.&quot; Admiral Togo was able to appear directly across Rozhestvensky&#x27;s line of advance (Rozhestvensky&#x27;s &quot;T&quot; had been crossed). With only most of his bow guns to use, Rozhestvensky&#x27;s main batteries were &quot;thrown successively out of bearing&quot; as he continued to advance. Other than surrender or retreat, Rozhestvensky had but two choices; fight a pitched battle or charge Togo&#x27;s battleline. He chose the former, and by the evening of 27 May 1905, Rozhestvensky&#x27;s flagship and the majority of his fleet were on the bottom of the Tsushima Straits. The Russians had lost 5,000 sailors.
During the battle, Rozhestvensky was wounded at least twice. The first time not seriously but the second time suffered significant injuries to the head and legs. He then retreated with the other survivors from the conning tower to the lower fighting position before leaving to find somewhere to observe the battle from. He was later found sitting in the remains of the ship&#x27;s right 6-inch turret where he remained for about an hour before losing consciousness. The unconscious admiral was transferred to the destroyer &quot;Buiny&quot;. Rozhestvensky regained consciousness but may have been slipping in and out of delirium. Later with the Buiny suffering from engine damage and running low on coal he was transfered to the destroyer &quot;Bedovy&quot;. He was taken prisoner when the Bedovy was later captured by the &quot;&quot;Sazanami&quot; of the Imperial Japanese Navy. After the signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth he returned to St Petersburg via the Trans-Siberian Railway.
The victorious Admiral Tōgō would later visit him (while being treated for his injuries in a Japanese hospital), comforting him with kind words:
With the end of the war Rozhestvensky left Japan on November 23 aboard the transport Yakut. This has been delayed by a bit over a week first by Rozhestvensky&#x27;s insistence on taking a Russian ship but then by riots in Vladivostok and mutiny on the first ship he attempted to take.

===Aftermath===
In 1906, Rozhestvensky faced court-martial for the disaster, along with each of his surviving battleship commanders. Some were sentenced to prison and some to firing squad for either losing the battle or surrendering on the high seas. The Tsar&#x27;s court was fully aware that Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov had surrendered the Russian fleet, as Rozhestvensky had been wounded and unconscious for most of the battle, and was very reluctant to accept his statements of responsibility. Nonetheless, Rozhestvensky was adamant in his defense of his subordinate commanders and maintained total responsibility, pleading guilty to losing the battle. As was expected (and hoped) by the courts, the Tsar commuted the death-sentenced captains to short prison terms and pardons for the remaining officers.

==Later life==
Rozhestvensky lived out the last years of his life in quietly St Petersburg. He died in the early hours of new years day 1909 and was buried in the Alexander Nevsky Lavra.

==Personal life==

He married Olga Antipova which whom he had one daughter. He had a number of affairs including beginning around 1900 one with Capitalina Makarova the wife of admiral Stepan Makarov.

<text>In mathematics, the arguments of the maxima (abbreviated arg max or argmax) and arguments of the minima (abbreviated arg min or argmin) are the input points at which a function output value is maximized and minimized, respectively. While the arguments are defined over the domain of a function, the output is part of its codomain.

== Definition ==

Given an arbitrary set a totally ordered set and a function, the formula_1 over some subset formula_2 of formula_3 is defined by

:formula_4

If formula_5 or formula_2 is clear from the context, then formula_2 is often left out, as in formula_8 In other words, formula_1 is the set of points formula_10 for which formula_11 attains the function&#x27;s largest value (if it exists). formula_12 may be the empty set, a singleton, or contain multiple elements. 

In the fields of convex analysis and variational analysis, a slightly different definition is used in the special case where formula_13 are the extended real numbers. In this case, if formula_14 is identically equal to formula_15 on formula_2 then formula_17 (that is, formula_18) and otherwise formula_19 is defined as above, where in this case formula_19 can also be written as:
:formula_21 

where it is emphasized that this equality involving formula_22 holds when formula_14 is not identically formula_15 on 

=== Arg min ===
The notion of formula_25 (or formula_26), which stands for argument of the minimum, is defined analogously. For instance,

:formula_27

are points formula_10 for which formula_11 attains its smallest value. It is the complementary operator of 

In the special case where formula_30 are the extended real numbers, if formula_14 is identically equal to formula_32 on formula_2 then formula_34 (that is, formula_35) and otherwise formula_36 is defined as above and moreover, in this case (of formula_14 not identically equal to formula_32) it also satisfies:
:formula_39

== Examples and properties ==

For example, if formula_11 is formula_41 then formula_14 attains its maximum value of formula_43 only at the point formula_44 Thus 

:formula_45

The formula_1 operator is different from the formula_47 operator. The formula_47 operator, when given the same function, returns the of the function instead of the that cause that function to reach that value; in other words

:formula_49 is the element in formula_50

Like formula_51 max may be the empty set (in which case the maximum is undefined) or a singleton, but unlike formula_51 formula_53 may not contain multiple elements: for example, if formula_11 is formula_55 then formula_56 but formula_57 because the function attains the same value at every element of formula_58

Equivalently, if formula_59 is the maximum of formula_60 then the formula_1 is the level set of the maximum:

:formula_62

We can rearrange to give the simple identity

:formula_63

If the maximum is reached at a single point then this point is often referred to as formula_51 and formula_1 is considered a point, not a set of points. So, for example,

:formula_66

(rather than the singleton set formula_67), since the maximum value of formula_68 is formula_69 which occurs for formula_70 However, in case the maximum is reached at many points, formula_1 needs to be considered a of points.

For example

:formula_72

because the maximum value of formula_73 is formula_74 which occurs on this interval for formula_75 or formula_76 On the whole real line

:formula_77 so an infinite set.

Functions need not in general attain a maximum value, and hence the formula_1 is sometimes the empty set; for example, formula_79 since formula_80 is unbounded on the real line. As another example, formula_81 although formula_82 is bounded by formula_83 However, by the extreme value theorem, a continuous real-valued function on a closed interval has a maximum, and thus a nonempty formula_58

<text>The Redshirts (Italian: &quot;Camicie rosse&quot; or &quot;Giubbe rosse&quot;), also called the Red coats, are volunteers who followed the Italian patriot Giuseppe Garibaldi during his campaigns. The name derived from the colour of their shirts or loose-fitting blouses that the volunteers, usually called Garibaldini, wore in lieu of a uniform.

The force originated as the Italian Legion supporting the Colorado Party during the Uruguayan Civil War. The story is that Garibaldi was given red shirts destined for slaughterhouse workers. Later, during the wars of Italian unification, the Redshirts won several battles against the armies of the Austrian Empire, the Kingdom of Two Sicilies and the Papal States. Most notably, Garibaldi led his Redshirts in the Expedition of the Thousand of 1860, which concluded with the annexation of Sicily, Southern Italy, Marche, and Umbria to the Kingdom of Sardinia, which led to the creation of a unified Kingdom of Italy. His military enterprises in South America and Europe made Garibaldi become known as the &quot;Hero of the Two Worlds&quot;.

&quot;Redshirts&quot; and &quot;Garibaldino&quot; were used to describe Italian volunteers in subsequent international conflicts, including the Garibaldi Legion of Poland organized by Garibaldi&#x27;s son Menotti during the January Uprising (1863); the Redshirt volunteers led by Garibaldi&#x27;s son Ricciotti that fought with the army of Greece during the Greco-Turkish War (1897) and the Balkan League during the First Balkan War (1912–1913); the Garibaldi Legion who fought for France in World War I (1914–1915); the Garibaldi Battalion who fought for the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War; and the Italian anti-fascist partisans in World War II.
The Redshirts were very popular and influenced many armies worldwide. For example, during the American Civil War, the Union&#x27;s Garibaldi Guard and its Confederate counterpart, the Garibaldi Legion, wore red shirts as a part of their uniforms. The Garibaldi shirt also became a popular type of clothing. According to &quot;A Cultural History of the Modern Age: The Crisis of the European Soul&quot;, &quot;For a considerable time Garibaldi was the most famous man in Europe, and the red shirt, la &quot;camicia rossa&quot;, became the fashion for ladies, even outside Italy&quot;.

==Background==
The red shirts were started by Giuseppe Garibaldi. During his years of exile, Garibaldi was involved in a military action in Uruguay. In 1843, he there originally used red shirts from a stock destined for slaughterhouse workers in Buenos Aires. Later, he spent time in private retirement in New York City. Both places have been claimed as the birthplace of the Garibaldian red shirt.The formation of his force of volunteers in Uruguay, his mastery of the techniques of guerilla warfare, his opposition to the Emperor of Brazil and to Argentine territorial ambitions (perceived by liberals as also imperialist), and his victories in the Battles of Cerro and Sant&#x27;Antonio in 1846 assured the independence of Uruguay and made Garibaldi and his followers heroes in Italy and Europe. Garibaldi was later hailed as the &quot;Gran Chico Fornido&quot; on the basis of these exploits.

In Uruguay, Garibaldi called on the Italians of Montevideo and formed the Italian Legion in 1843. In later years, it was claimed that in Uruguay the legion first sported the red shirts associated with Garibaldi&#x27;s &quot;Thousand&quot;, which were said to have been obtained from a factory in Montevideo that had intended to export them to the slaughterhouses of Argentina. Red shirts sported by Argentinian butchers in the 1840s are not otherwise documented, however, and the famous &quot;camicie rosse&quot; did not appear during Garibaldi&#x27;s efforts in Rome in 1849–1850. Later, after the failure of the campaign for Rome, Garibaldi spent around 1850– to 1853 with the Italian patriot and inventor, Antonio Meucci, in a modest Gothic frame house (now designated a New York City Landmark), on Staten Island, New York City before he sailed for Italy in 1853. The Garibaldi-Meucci Museum is on Staten Island.

In New York City, before the American Civil War, rival companies of volunteer firemen were the great working-class heroes. Their courage, civic spirit, and lively comradeship inspired fanatical followers throughout New York, the original &quot;fire buffs&quot;. Volunteer fire companies varied in the completeness and details of their uniforms, but all of them wore the red flannel shirt. When Garibaldi returned to Italy after his New York stay, the red shirts made their first appearance among his followers.

Garibaldi remained a local hero among European immigrants back in the city. The &quot;Garibaldi Guard&quot; (39th New York State Volunteers) fought in the American Civil War from 1861 to 1865. As part of their uniform, all enlisted men wore red woollen &quot;Garibaldi Shirts&quot;. The &quot;New York Tribune&quot; sized them up:

A woman&#x27;s fashion, the Garibaldi shirt, was begun in 1860 by Empress Eugénie in France, and the blousy style remained popular for some years and eventually turned into the Victorian shirt waist and modern woman&#x27;s blouse. Garibaldi&#x27;s son, Ricciotti Garibaldi, later led Redshirt volunteer troops that fought with the Hellenic Army in the Greco-Turkish War in 1897 and the First Balkan War in 1912–13.

==Legacy==
 Nottingham Forest have worn red shirts since the club&#x27;s formation in 1865, as tribute to the Garibaldi Redshirts and their leader.

<text>Our Lady of Zeitoun, also known simply as El-Zeitoun, Zeitun or rarely Our Lady of Light, was a mass Marian apparition that was reported to have occurred in the Zeitoun district of Cairo, Egypt, during a period of about 3 years beginning on 2 April 1968.

==Apparition==
The first apparition of the Virgin Mary at Zeitoun was recorded on the evening of 2 April 1968. The phenomenon was seen by two Muslim bus mechanics, who claimed to witness a woman dressed in white on the roof of Saint Mary&#x27;s Coptic Church. One thought she was a nun about to attempt suicide by leaping from the roof, and called for police. Intrigued by the mechanics yelling &quot;don&#x27;t jump!&quot;, a crowd gathered at the site. The police attempted to disperse them, saying that the sighting was just a reflection of the light from the street lamps. However, a church custodian suggested the figure was the Virgin Mary, which greatly excited the crowd. The event itself ended after a few minutes.

One week later, on 9 April, the phenomenon reoccurred, again lasting for only a few minutes. After that time apparitions became more frequent, sometimes two or three times a week, for several years, ending in 1971. According to Coptic tradition, Zeitoun is near one of the locations where the Holy Family stayed during their flight into Egypt.

The patriarch of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, Pope Kyrillos VI appointed a committee of high-ranking priests and bishops to investigate the matter, directed by Bishop Gregorios, bishop of postgraduate studies, Coptic culture and scientific research. On 4 May Pope Kyrillos VI issued an official statement confirming the apparitions. Soon afterward, the Ministry of Tourism also issued a validation of the sightings, and began printing pamphlets.

As the apparition appeared over a Coptic church, the Vatican left the investigation to the Coptic authorities.

The apparitions were also allegedly witnessed by President Gamal Abdel Nasser, and images photographed by newspaper photographers and Egyptian television. Investigations performed by the police could find no apparent explanation. No device was found within a radius of fifteen miles capable of projecting the image, and many photos were taken of the alleged apparition by independent photographers. With no alternative explanation and approval from religious and political officials, the Egyptian government accepted the apparitions as true.

==Skeptical response==

Estimates of the number of observers of the event vary greatly. Thousands were said to have flocked to the Church soon after the first announced occurrences of the phenomenon. Christian author Francis Johnston claims the apparitions were seen by a total of millions of people. Primary sources used by Johnston put 250,000 as the upper limit for a single night, though the difficulty in estimating crowd size in the dark means the number of people in the crowd may have been significantly larger or smaller.

The only secular, English-language account of the events was provided by Cynthia Nelson, a professor of anthropology at the American University in Cairo. She visited the church site on several occasions including 15 April 1968, another week later near the end of April, and on 1 June 1968. Despite reports of regular appearances of the Virgin Mary, Nelson did not see anything that could be identified clearly as such. Instead she only saw a few &quot;intermittent flashes of light&quot; that she considered to be headlights, and later a glow of ambiguous shape shining through palm trees. &quot;But&quot;, she admitted, &quot;the source of the light was a mystery, for the streetlights had been disconnected all around the church for several days.&quot;

Some authors suggest that the sightings must be considered in context. The appearances happened during a period of crisis in Egyptian history and echoed &quot;a widespread feeling that the defeat of Egypt in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war was the result of having abandoned faith in favor of human-made ideas and belief systems&quot;. Sociologists Robert Bartholomew and Erich Goode offer the Zeitoun apparitions as a prominent case of mass hysteria: &quot;It appears that the Marian observers were predisposed by religious background and social expectation to interpreting the light displays as related to the Virgin Mary.&quot; 

Professor Michael P. Carroll similarly suggests that the &quot;lights of uncertain origin&quot; were interpreted as Mary due to the societal stresses on Egyptian society at the time, coupled with an association of the Virgin Mary with the Zeitoun area. Carroll notes that Muslims seeing the Virgin would not be unusual, as Mary is highly revered in Islam as well.

John S. Derr and Michael A. Persinger propose a possible cause of the lights themselves in Tectonic Strain Theory, the idea that the occurrence of earthquakes causes the appearance of strange lights. Zeitoun did see some tectonic activity prior to the events of 1968–1971; therefore, the source of the lights could have been a by-product of this seismic activity. Appearances of the lights only at night would be possible as such lights might not be visible during daytime; however, Tectonic Strain Theory has yet to provide a mechanism for how tectonic events could cause these lights.

Photos of the event are numerous, though sometimes inconsistent. Most of the photos are blurry or of poor quality, though some do seem to show the Virgin Mary regardless. Some of them are either illustrations over a less detailed photo, or a complete illustration, depending on the source of the image. The sourcing for the most popular photo is unclear, and many skeptics have mentioned numerous inconsistencies such as the bright sunlight on the onlookers heads, while the sky looks black, or the apparition seeming translucent despite other photographs and witness testimony describing it as opaque and very bright. In Cynthia Nelson&#x27;s report, she noted that many photos and pictures of the apparition were being sold in the marketplace, which could add a financial incentive for forgery.

==Golden Jubilee==
On 12 May 2018, the Coptic Church celebrated the golden Jubilee of the event. A large number of priests and Christians from all over Egypt attended the celebration. Sub-celebrations have been held from 10 May to 13 May.

<text>Miles Beresford Kington (13 May 1941 – 30 January 2008) was a British journalist, musician (a double bass player for Instant Sunshine and other groups) and broadcaster. He is also credited with the invention of Franglais, a fictional language, made up of French and English. 
==Early life==
Kington was born to William Beresford Nairn (also &quot;Nairne&quot;, depending on the source) Kington (1909–1982), of Frondeg Hall, Rhostyllen, Denbighshire, Wales, and his first wife Jean Ann (1912–1973; daughter of John Ernest Sanders, of Whitegates, Gresford, Denbighshire) in Downpatrick, County Down, Northern Ireland, where his father, a captain in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, was then posted. Subsequently, Bill Kington ran the Border Brewery in Wrexham, North Wales. The Kingtons were a branch of a landed gentry family that married into the Scottish Clan Oliphant and produced the line of Kington-Blair-Oliphant Chieftains of Gask. Kington had a younger brother, Stewart (1943–2009), who followed his father in the brewing trade, later becoming a cameraman.

Kington was educated at Bilton Grange, a prep school in Rugby, then Trinity College, Glenalmond, a boys&#x27; fee-funded boarding school (now Glenalmond College). During a gap year Kington worked as a translator in New York City, and lived in Greenwich Village. He then studied Modern Languages (French and German) at Trinity College, Oxford. After graduation he spent some time writing with Terry Jones, an Oxford contemporary; but the teaming did not click, and Jones was in reality waiting for his friend Michael Palin to graduate.

== Career ==
Inspired particularly by the American humourist S. J. Perelman, Kington began his writing career at the satirical magazine &quot;Punch&quot;, where he spent some 15 years. It was during this time, in the late 1970s, that he began writing his Franglais columns, written in a comical mixture of English and French. These short sketches purported to be a study course taking as their &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; that &quot;les Français ne parlent pas le O-level français&quot; (&quot;the French do not speak O-level French&quot;). They were later published as a series of books (&quot;Let&#x27;s Parler Franglais!&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Parler Franglais Again&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Parler Franglais One More Temps&quot;, and so on). During the 1980s he presented &quot;Steam Days&quot;, an informative programme about Britain&#x27;s railways. He also presented one episode, &quot;Three Miles High&quot;, in the first series of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Great Railway Journeys&quot;, travelling through parts of Peru and Bolivia.

Taught the piano from the age of seven, Kington discovered when he fell in love with jazz during adolescence that being able to read music meant he felt unable to improvise; he therefore took up the trombone. At Oxford he found that several fellow undergraduates played better, so he switched to the double bass when someone pointed out the shortage of bass players at the university. Kington was for many years a member of the cabaret quartet Instant Sunshine. To his regret, he only played in a jazz group for a brief period in 1962 during a summer job in Spain, where he ran into the British politician Enoch Powell, apparently looking somewhat displeased. Meeting Powell years later at a &quot;Punch&quot; meal and reminding him of their previous meeting, he was amused by Powell&#x27;s comment: &quot;I never forgot a face&quot;. Kington moved away from London in the 1980s, remarried, and worked from his home in the village of Limpley Stoke, near Bath.

He wrote a humorous column for &quot;The Independent&quot;, which he joined in 1987 after six years at &quot;The Times&quot;. He also wrote a similar column for &quot;The Oldie&quot;. Regular topics for his columns included:
* Answers to a Christmas quiz that was never printed
* Fictional court reporting
* Jazz
* Motorway ballads
* Proceedings of the United Deities
* Spot the fictional news story
* Things for which there is no word
* &quot;Albanian Proverbs&quot; which appear profound at first glance, but are actually meaningless
* Letters concerning a recently deceased celebrity&#x27;s supposed love of cricket

He also satirised Bertrand Russell à la &quot;Punch&quot; in &quot;Bertrand&#x27;s Mind Wins over Mater&quot;, in &quot;Welcome to Kington: Includes All the Pieces You Cut Out From The Independent and Lost&quot; (1989). In addition, Kington wrote two stage plays. &quot;Waiting for Stoppard&quot;, a good-natured pastiche of early Tom Stoppard plays and simultaneously a convoluted farce involving the fatwa against Salman Rushdie, was seen at the Bristol New Vic, Southwark Playhouse and other venues in 1995. The following year came &quot;The Death of Tchaikovsky – a Sherlock Holmes Mystery&quot;, in which Kington appeared in person at the Edinburgh Festival.

==Death and legacy==
Kington died at his home in Limpley Stoke, near Bath, after a short illness, having just filed what became his final copy for &quot;The Independent&quot;. He had suffered from pancreatic cancer. In October 2008, &quot;How Shall I tell the Dog?&quot;, written by him about events after receiving his terminal diagnosis, was serialised by BBC Radio Four, featuring Michael Palin as Kington.

A quotation frequently attributed to him is: &quot;Knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad.&quot;

He is commemorated by a memorial bench alongside the Kennet and Avon Canal, near Blackberry Lane, Conkwell. It bears a plaque, with the inscription:

<doc id="348029" wikidata="Q1366201" url="?curid=348029" title="Virasoro algebra">
<text>In mathematics, the Virasoro algebra is a complex Lie algebra and the unique nontrivial central extension of the Witt algebra. It is widely used in two-dimensional conformal field theory and in string theory. It is named after Miguel Ángel Virasoro.

== Structure ==

The Virasoro algebra is spanned by generators for and the central charge .
These generators satisfy formula_1 and 

The factor of formula_2 is merely a matter of convention. For a derivation of the algebra as the unique central extension of the Witt algebra, see derivation of the Virasoro algebra.

The Virasoro algebra has a presentation in terms of two generators (e.g. 3 and −2) and six relations.

The generators formula_3 are called annihilation modes, while formula_4 are creation modes. A basis of creation generators of the Virasoro algebra&#x27;s universal enveloping algebra is the set
:formula_5
For formula_6, let formula_7, then 
formula_8.

==Representation theory==

In any indecomposable representation of the Virasoro algebra, the central generator formula_9 of the algebra takes a constant value, also denoted formula_9 and called the representation&#x27;s central charge. 

A vector formula_11 in a representation of the Virasoro algebra has conformal dimension (or conformal weight) formula_12 if it is an eigenvector of formula_13 with eigenvalue formula_12:
: formula_15 
An formula_13-eigenvector formula_11 is called a primary state (of dimension formula_12) if it is annihilated by the annihilation modes,
: formula_19 

===Highest weight representations===

A highest weight representation of the Virasoro algebra is a representation generated by a primary state formula_11.
A highest weight representation is spanned by the formula_13-eigenstates formula_22. The conformal dimension of formula_23 is formula_24, where formula_25 is called the level of formula_23.
Any state whose level is not zero is called a descendant state of formula_11.

For any formula_28, the Verma module formula_29 of central charge formula_9 and conformal dimension formula_12 is the representation whose basis is formula_22, for formula_11 a primary state of dimension formula_12. 
The Verma module is 
the largest possible highest weight representation. 
The Verma module is indecomposable, and for generic values of formula_28 it is also irreducible. When it is reducible, there exist other highest weight representations with these values of formula_28, called degenerate representations, which are quotients of the Verma module. In particular, the unique irreducible highest weight representation with these values of formula_28 is the quotient of the Verma module by its maximal submodule.

A Verma module is irreducible if and only if it has no singular vectors.

===Singular vectors===

A singular vector or null vector of a highest weight representation is a state that is both descendant and primary.

A sufficient condition for the Verma module formula_29 to have a singular vector is formula_39 for some formula_40, where 
:formula_41
Then the singular vector has level formula_42 and conformal dimension 
:formula_43
Here are the values of formula_44 for formula_45, together with the corresponding singular vectors, written as formula_46 for formula_11 the primary state of formula_48:
:formula_49
Singular vectors for arbitrary formula_40 may be computed using various algorithms, and their explicit expressions are known.

If formula_51, then formula_29 has a singular vector at level formula_53 if and only if formula_39 with formula_55. If formula_56, there can also exist a singular vector at level formula_53 if formula_58 with formula_59 and formula_60. This singular vector is now a descendant of another singular vector at level formula_42. 

The integers formula_62 that appear in formula_44 are called Kac indices. It can be useful to use non-integer Kac indices for parametrizing the conformal dimensions of Verma modules that do not have singular vectors, for example in the critical random cluster model.

===Shapovalov form===

For any formula_64, the involution formula_65 defines an automorphism of the Virasoro algebra and of its universal enveloping algebra. 
Then the Shapovalov form is the symmetric bilinear form on the Verma module formula_66 such that formula_67, where the numbers formula_68 are defined by
formula_69 and formula_70.
The inverse Shapovalov form is relevant to computing Virasoro conformal blocks, and can be determined in terms of singular vectors.

The determinant of the Shapovalov form at a given level formula_53 is given by the Kac determinant formula, 
: formula_72
where formula_73 is the partition function, and formula_74 is a positive constant that does not depend on formula_12 or formula_9. 

===Hermitian form and unitarity===

If formula_77, a highest weight representation with conformal dimension formula_12 has a unique Hermitian form such that the Hermitian adjoint of formula_79 is formula_80 and the norm of the primary state formula_11 is one. In the basis formula_82, the Hermitian form on the Verma module formula_29 has the same matrix as the Shapovalov form formula_68, now interpreted as a Gram matrix. 

The representation is called unitary if that Hermitian form is positive definite. 
Since any singular vector has zero norm, all unitary highest weight representations are irreducible.
An irreducible highest weight representation is unitary if and only if 
* either formula_85 with formula_86,
* or formula_87 with formula_88

Daniel Friedan, Zongan Qiu, and Stephen Shenker showed that these conditions are necessary, and Peter Goddard, Adrian Kent, and David Olive used the coset construction or GKO construction (identifying unitary representations of the Virasoro algebra within tensor products of unitary representations of affine Kac–Moody algebras) to show that they are sufficient.

===Characters===

The character of a representation formula_89 of the Virasoro algebra is the function
:formula_90
The character of the Verma module formula_91 is 
:formula_92 
where formula_93 is the Dedekind eta function.

For any formula_94 and for formula_95, the Verma module formula_96 is reducible due to the existence of a singular vector at level formula_42. This singular vector generates a submodule, which is isomorphic to the Verma module formula_98. The quotient of formula_96 by this submodule is irreducible if formula_96 does not have other singular vectors, and its character is 
:formula_101

Let formula_102 with formula_103 coprime, and formula_104 and formula_105. (Then formula_106 is in the Kac table of the corresponding minimal model). The Verma module formula_96 has infinitely many singular vectors, and is therefore reducible with infinitely many submodules. This Verma module has an irreducible quotient by its largest nontrivial submodule. (The spectrums of minimal models are built from such irreducible representations.) The character of the irreducible quotient is 
:formula_108
This expression is an infinite sum because the submodules formula_98 and formula_110 have a nontrivial intersection, which is itself a complicated submodule.

==Applications==

===Conformal field theory===
In two dimensions, the algebra of local conformal transformations is made of two copies of the Witt algebra.
It follows that the symmetry algebra of two-dimensional conformal field theory is the Virasoro algebra. Technically, the conformal bootstrap approach to two-dimensional CFT relies on Virasoro conformal blocks, special functions that include and generalize the characters of representations of the Virasoro algebra.

===String theory===
Since the Virasoro algebra comprises the generators of the conformal group of the worldsheet, the stress tensor in string theory obeys the commutation relations of (two copies of) the Virasoro algebra. This is because the conformal group decomposes into separate diffeomorphisms of the forward and back lightcones. Diffeomorphism invariance of the worldsheet implies additionally that the stress tensor vanishes. This is known as the Virasoro constraint, and in the quantum theory, cannot be applied to all the states in the theory, but rather only on the physical states (compare Gupta–Bleuler formalism).

==Generalizations==

===Super Virasoro algebras===

There are two supersymmetric &quot;N&quot; = 1 extensions of the Virasoro algebra, called the Neveu–Schwarz algebra and the Ramond algebra. Their theory is similar to that of the Virasoro algebra, now involving Grassmann numbers. There are further extensions of these algebras with more supersymmetry, such as the &quot;N&quot; = 2 superconformal algebra.

===W-algebras===

W-algebras are associative algebras which contain the Virasoro algebra, and which play an important role in two-dimensional conformal field theory. Among W-algebras, the Virasoro algebra has the particularity of being a Lie algebra.

===Affine Lie algebras===

The Virasoro algebra is a subalgebra of the universal enveloping algebra of any affine Lie algebra, as shown by the Sugawara construction. In this sense, affine Lie algebras are extensions of the Virasoro algebra.

===Meromorphic vector fields on Riemann surfaces===
The Virasoro algebra is a central extension of the Lie algebra of meromorphic vector fields with two poles on a genus 0 Riemann surface.
On a higher-genus compact Riemann surface, the Lie algebra of meromorphic vector fields with two poles also has a central extension, which is a generalization of the Virasoro algebra. This can be further generalized to supermanifolds.

===Vertex algebras and conformal algebras===
The Virasoro algebra also has vertex algebraic and conformal algebraic counterparts, which basically come from arranging all the basis elements into generating series and working with single objects.

==History==

The Witt algebra (the Virasoro algebra without the central extension) was discovered by É. Cartan (1909). Its analogues over finite fields were studied by E. Witt in about the 1930s. 

The central extension of the Witt algebra that gives the Virasoro algebra was first found (in characteristic &quot;p&quot; &gt; 0) by R. E. Block (1966, page 381) and independently rediscovered (in characteristic 0) by I. M. Gelfand and Dmitry Fuchs (1969). 

The physicist Miguel Ángel Virasoro
(1970) wrote down some operators generating the Virasoro algebra (later known as the Virasoro operators) while studying dual resonance models, though he did not find the central extension. The central extension giving the Virasoro algebra was rediscovered in physics shortly after by J. H. Weis, according to Brower and Thorn (1971, footnote on page 167).

<text>Mongane Wally Serote (born 8 May 1944) is a South African poet and writer. He became involved in political resistance to the apartheid government by joining the African National Congress (ANC) and in 1969 was arrested and detained for several months without trial. He subsequently spent years in exile, working in Botswana, and later London, England, for the ANC in their Arts and Culture Department, before eventually returning to South Africa in 1990. He was inaugurated as South Africa&#x27;s National Poet Laureate in 2018.

== Early years ==
Mongane Wally Serote was born in Sophiatown, Johannesburg, 1944, just four years before the National Party (South Africa) came to power in South Africa. His early education took place in the poverty-stricken township of Alexandra and later at Morris Isaacson High School – the school in Jabavu, Soweto, and Sacred Heart Commercial High School, Lesotho. He first became involved in the Black Consciousness Movement when he was finishing high school in Soweto. His presence in that town linked him to a group known as the &quot;township&quot; or &quot;Soweto&quot; poets, and his poems often expressed themes of political activism, the development of black identity, and violent images of revolt and resistance. He was arrested by the apartheid government under the Terrorism Act in June 1969 and spent nine months in solitary confinement, before being released without charge. 

== 1970s–1990: Life in exile ==

Serote went to study in New York City, United States, obtaining a Fine Arts degree at Columbia University.

After contributing poems to various journals, in 1972 he published his first collection, &quot;Yakhal&#x27;Inkomo&quot;. It won the Ingrid Jonker Poetry Prize in 1973.

He was a Fulbright Scholar and received a fine arts degree from Columbia University in 1979. He was not able to return to South Africa and he began a life in exile, Serote remained in voluntary exile, going in 1977 to Botswana, where he rejoined the ANC underground and its military wing, uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK). He lived in Gaborone, where he was involved in the Medu Art Ensemble, and in London, England, where he relocated in 1986 and worked for the ANC&#x27;s Department of Arts and Culture.

== Return to South Africa ==
He returned to South Africa in 1990, after the ANC was unbanned. In 1993, he won the Noma Award for Publishing in Africa. In 2004, he received the Pablo Neruda award from the Chilean government.

Serote held a variety of positions in the ANC, returning to South Africa in 1990, when he was appointed Head of the Department of Arts and Culture of the ANC in Johannesburg. He has also served as chair of the parliamentary select committee for arts and culture. Serote was awarded honorary doctorates from the universities of KwaZulu-Natal and Transkei. Until recently he was a Member of Parliament and Chairman of the Portfolio Committee for Arts, Culture, Language, Science and Technology.

He has served as chair of the parliamentary select committee for arts and culture, and was also the CEO of Freedom Park, a national heritage site in Pretoria opened in 2007. He has founded a few NGOs, iIKSSA Trust where he is the Chairperson, IARI which he is also the CEO. He sits on a few advisory boards in the country dealing with Arts, Culture, Indigenous Knowledge and African Renaissance issues.

In 2018, Serote was announced as the National Poet Laureate of South Africa, following the death of Keorapetse Kgositsile.
