==Early life and education==
Arthur Christopher Orme Plummer was born on December 13, 1929, in Toronto, Ontario. He was the only child of John Orme Plummer (1894–1977), who sold stocks and other securities, and Isabella Mary Abbott, who worked as secretary to the Dean of Sciences at McGill University, and was the granddaughter of Canadian prime minister Sir John Abbott. On his father&#x27;s side, Plummer&#x27;s great-uncle was patent lawyer and agent F. B. Fetherstonhaugh. Plummer was also a cousin of a Canadian classical pianist Janina Fialkowska and a second cousin of British actor Nigel Bruce, known for portraying Doctor Watson to Basil Rathbone&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes. 

Plummer&#x27;s parents separated shortly after his birth, and he was brought up mainly by his mother in the Abbott family home in Senneville, Quebec, on the western tip of the Island of Montreal. He spoke English and French fluently. As a schoolboy, he began studying to be a concert pianist, but developed a love for theatre at an early age, and began acting while he was attending the High School of Montreal. He took up acting after watching Laurence Olivier&#x27;s film &quot;Henry V&quot; (1944). He learned the basics of acting as an apprentice with the Montreal Repertory Theatre, where fellow Montrealer William Shatner also played.

Plummer never attended university, something he regretted all his life. Although his mother and his father&#x27;s family had ties with McGill University, he was never a McGill student.

In 1946, he caught the attention of &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;″s theatre critic Herbert Whittaker with his performance as Mr. Darcy in a Montreal High School production of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Whittaker was also amateur stage director of the Montreal Repertory theatre, and he cast Plummer at age 18 as Oedipus in Jean Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;La Machine infernale&quot;.

==Career==
=== 1948–1964: Early roles and theatre debut ===

Plummer made his professional acting debut in 1948 with Ottawa&#x27;s Stage Society after which he performed roles as an apprentice artist with the Montreal Repertory Theatre alongside fellow apprenticing actor William Shatner. In 1952, he starred in a number of productions at the Bermudiana Theatre in the City of Hamilton, in the British colony of Bermuda where he was seen and recruited by an American producer, although he was reluctant to leave Bermuda. Edward Everett Horton hired Plummer to appear as Gerard in the 1953 road show production of André Roussin&#x27;s &quot;Nina&quot;, a role originated on Broadway by David Niven in 1951. Plummer made his Broadway debut in January 1953 in the Diana Morgan play &quot;The Starcross Story&quot;, a show that closed on opening night after a plagiarism lawsuit shut down the production. Plummer acted opposite Mary Astor and Margaret Bannerman.

His next Broadway appearance, &quot;Home is the Hero&quot;, lasted 30 performances from September to October 1954. He appeared in support of Broadway legend Katharine Cornell and film legend Tyrone Power in &quot;The Dark Is Light Enough&quot;, which lasted 69 performances from February to April 1955. The play toured several cities, with Plummer serving as Power&#x27;s understudy. Later that same year, he appeared in his first Broadway hit, opposite Julie Harris (who won a Tony Award) in Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;The Lark&quot;. After this success, he appeared in &quot;Night of the Auk&quot;, which was not a success, He appeared as Jason opposite Dame Judith Anderson in Robinson Jeffers&#x27; adaptation of &quot;Medea&quot; at the Theatre Sara Bernhardt in Paris in 1955. The American National Theatre and Academy production, directed by Guthrie McClintic, was part of Le Festival International. Also in 1955, he played Mark Antony in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and Ferdinand in &quot;The Tempest&quot; at the American Shakespeare Festival (Stratford, Connecticut). He returned to the American Shakespeare Festival in 1981 to play the title role in &quot;Henry V&quot;.

Plummer made his Canadian television debut in the February 1953 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation production of &quot;Othello&quot;, starring Lorne Greene as the Moor. His American television debut was also in 1953 on a &quot;Studio One&quot; episode entitled &quot;The Gathering Night&quot;, as an artist who finds success just as his eyesight begins to fail him. He also appeared throughout the 1950s on both dramatic showcase programs like &quot;The Alcoa Hour&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;, and &quot;Omnibus&quot; and episodic series. In 1956, he appeared with Jason Robards and Constance Ford in an episode entitled &quot;A Thief There Was&quot; of CBS&#x27;s anthology series &quot;Appointment with Adventure&quot;. Plummer made his debut at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in 1956, playing the title role in &quot;Henry V&quot;, which subsequently was performed that year at the Edinburgh Festival. He played the title role in &quot;Hamlet&quot; and Sir Andrew Aguecheek in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; at Stratford in 1957. The following year, he played Leontes in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, Bardolph in &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, and Benedick in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. In 1959, Plummer appeared in Elia Kazan&#x27;s successful Broadway production of Archibald MacLeish&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;J.B.&quot;; Plummer was nominated for his first Tony for Best Actor in Play. (&quot;J.B.&quot; also won Tonys for Best Play and for Kazan&#x27;s direction.)

He appeared in the live television drama &quot;Little Moon of Alban&quot; with Julie Harris, for which he received his first Emmy Award nomination. He also appeared with Harris in the 1958 television adaptation of &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot; and played Torvald Helmer to Harris&#x27; Nora in a 1959 television version of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;. Plummer starred in the television adaptations of Philip Barry&#x27;s &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1959), George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Captain Brassbound&#x27;s Conversion&quot; (1960), Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Time Remembered&quot; (playing the role of Prince Albert originated by Richard Burton on Broadway), and Edmond Rostand&#x27;s &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; (1962). In 1964, his performance of the Gloomy Dane in the BBC production &quot;Hamlet at Elsinore&quot; garnered him his second Emmy nomination. He played Hamlet in &quot;Hamlet at Elsinore&quot;, produced by Danish and British BBC TV (1964), taped at Elsinore Castle.

In April 1961, he appeared as Benedick in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; with the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. He also appeared with the RSC in May 1961 in the lead role of &quot;Richard III&quot;. He made his London debut on June 11, 1961, playing King Henry II in Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Becket&quot; with the RSC at the Aldwych Theatre, directed by Peter Hall. The production later transferred to the Globe for a December 1961 to April 1962 run. For his performance, Plummer won the Evening Standard Award for Best Actor. At the Stratford Festival, he played Philip the Bastard in &quot;King John&quot; and Mercutio in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. In 1962, he played the title roles in both &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;, returning in 1967 to play Mark Antony in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. Plummer appeared less frequently on Broadway in the 1960s as he moved from New York to London. 

He appeared in the title role in a 1963 production of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui&quot;, which did not succeed, but he had a great success in Peter Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot;, playing conquistador Francisco Pizarro to David Carradine&#x27;s Atahuallpa. Both performances were &quot;stunning&quot;, as Plummer did wonders &quot;of extraordinary beauty and deep pain&quot; in playing his complex character. Plummer&#x27;s film career began in 1958 when Sidney Lumet cast him as a young writer in &quot;Stage Struck&quot;. That same year, Plummer played the lead in Nicholas Ray&#x27;s film &quot;Wind Across the Everglades&quot;. In 1963, he was the subject of a short National Film Board of Canada documentary, &quot;30 Minutes, Mister Plummer&quot;, directed by Anne Claire Poirier. Plummer returned to film playing the Roman emperor Commodus in Anthony Mann&#x27;s epic &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (1964).

=== 1965–1979: &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and stardom ===

Plummer remains widely known for his portrayal of Captain Von Trapp due to the box-office success and continued popularity of the Robert Wise-directed musical epic &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965). Plummer acted alongside Julie Andrews, and the film earned five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Although he was embarrassed, at first, about the role, which Plummer described as &quot;so awful and sentimental and gooey&quot;, the film made cinematic history, becoming the all-time top-grossing film, eclipsing &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. He found all aspects of making the film unpleasant, except working with Andrews, and he avoided using its name, instead calling it &quot;that movie&quot;, &quot;S&amp;M&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Mucus&quot;. He declined to attend the 40th Anniversary cast reunion, but he did provide commentary on the 2005 DVD release. 

He relented for the 45th anniversary and appeared with the full cast on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; on October 28, 2010. In 2009, Plummer said that he was &quot;a bit bored with the character&quot;. He said: &quot;Although we worked hard enough to make him interesting, it was a bit like flogging a dead horse. And the subject matter is not mine. I mean, it can&#x27;t appeal to every person in the world.&quot; However, he admitted that the film itself was well made and was proud to be associated with a film with such mass appeal. &quot;But it was a very well-made movie, and it&#x27;s a family movie and we haven&#x27;t seen a family movie, I don&#x27;t think, on that scale for ages.&quot; In one interview he said that he had &quot;terrific memories&quot; of making the movie.

He was in &quot;Inside Daisy Clover&quot; (1965), then played World War Two agent Eddie Chapman in &quot;Triple Cross&quot; (1966), and had a supporting role as Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in &quot;The Night of the Generals&quot; (1967). Plummer was cast to replace Rex Harrison for the film adaptation of &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot;. This decision was later reversed, but Plummer was nonetheless paid $87,500 for signing the contract. At the same time, Plummer was performing in the stage play &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot; and his whole &quot;Dolittle&quot; participation was so brief that Plummer never missed a performance. Plummer had the title role in &quot;Oedipus the King&quot; (1968) and &quot;The High Commissioner&quot; (1968), playing an Australian in the latter. Plummer was one of many stars in &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1969), and the lead in a musical, &quot;Lock Up Your Daughters&quot; (1969). In the 1969 &quot;film adaptation of The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot;, Plummer plays the Inca Emperor Atahualpa to Robert Shaw&#x27;s Pizarro. On screen, Plummer portrayed the Duke of Wellington in &quot;Waterloo&quot; (1970). &quot;The Pyx&quot; (1973) was his first Canadian film. He played Rudyard Kipling in &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; (1975). He also appeared in the comedy &quot;The Return of the Pink Panther&quot; (1975), alongside Peter Sellers and &quot;The Silent Partner&quot; (1978) opposite Elliott Gould. He appeared in &quot;Aces High&quot; (1976), &quot;Starcrash&quot; (1978), &quot;International Velvet&quot; (1978) and &quot;Murder by Decree&quot; (1979) (playing Sherlock Holmes).

From June 1971 to January 1972, he appeared at the Royal National Theatre, acting in repertory for the season. The plays he appeared in were Jean Giraudoux&#x27;s &quot;Amphitryon 38&quot; directed by Laurence Olivier; Georg Büchner&#x27;s &quot;Danton&#x27;s Death&quot; (director Jonathan Miller); Adrian Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Tyger&quot;; Luigi Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot;; and Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; at the New Theatre in London. From May to June 1973, he appeared on Broadway as the title character in &quot;Cyrano&quot;, a musical adaptation of Edmond Rostand&#x27;s 1897 play &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; by Anthony Burgess and Michael J. Lewis. For that performance, Plummer won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical and a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance. Later that year, he played Anton Chekhov in Neil Simon&#x27;s adaptation of several Chekhov short stories, &quot;The Good Doctor&quot;. Another notable play in which he appeared was the 1974 adaptation of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;After the Fall&quot;, in which he played Quentin (a part originated on Broadway by Jason Robards) opposite Faye Dunaway&#x27;s Maggie.

Plummer acted in &quot;Lovers and Madmen&quot; at the Opera House at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., in 1973 and in &quot;Love and Master Will&quot; at the same venue in 1975. &quot;Love and Master Will&quot; consisted of selections from the works of William Shakespeare on the subject of love, arranged by Plummer. His co-stars were Zoe Caldwell, Bibi Andersson and Leonard Nimoy. Plummer played &quot;Edgar&quot; in E. L. Doctorow&#x27;s &quot;Drinks before Dinner&quot; with the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Public/Newman Theatre in New York City in 1978. He appeared as Herod Antipas in the television miniseries &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (1977) alongside the ensemble cast which included Laurence Olivier, James Earl Jones and James Mason. Plummer played Herbert Kappler in the true based television film &quot;The Scarlet and the Black&quot;. That same year, he starred in the five-time Emmy Award-winning television series &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;, alongside Barbara Stanwyck and Jean Simmons.

=== 1980–1997: Return to theatre ===

During this time Plummer appeared in the romantic drama &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; (1980), the drama &quot;Eyewitness&quot; (1981), the comedy &quot;Dragnet&quot; (1987) and &quot;Shadow Dancing&quot; (1988). Plummer also did some voice work, such as his role of Henri the pigeon in &quot;An American Tail&quot; (1986) and the villainous Grand Duke of Owls in &quot;Rock-a-Doodle&quot; (1991), both directed by Don Bluth. In 1982, he starred on Broadway production of the Shakespearean tragedy &quot;Othello&quot;, playing Iago opposite James Earl Jones&#x27; Moor. The production also featured performances from Kelsey Grammer as Cassio and Dianne Wiest as Desdemona. &quot;New York Times&quot; theatre critic Frank Rich wrote in his original review, &quot;Mr. Plummer, a sensational actor in peak form, has made something crushing out of Shakespeare&#x27;s archvillain. He gives us evil so pure - and so bottomless - that it can induce tears. Our tears are not for the dastardly Iago, of course - that would be wrong. No, what Mr. Plummer does is make us weep for a civilization that can produce such a man and allow him to flower.&quot; For his performance he received a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play nomination losing to Roger Rees in &quot;The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby&quot;.

In 1987, Plummer provided the English narration for Frédéric Back&#x27;s animated film &quot;The Man Who Planted Trees&quot;. The film won Best Animated Short at the 60th Academy Awards. 

In 1988, he starred in another Shakespeare adaptation on Broadway in the title role in &quot;Macbeth&quot; with Glenda Jackson playing his lady. Frank Rich wrote of his performance &quot;Mr. Plummer&#x27;s thoughtful, beautifully spoken performance best illuminates the strengths and built-in limitations of the entire enterprise. This actor grapples arrestingly with his early bouts of conscience, as &quot;horrible imaginings&quot; send Macbeth&#x27;s heart knocking at his ribs.&quot; From 1990 to 1993, he starred in the Canadian-French drama series &quot;Counterstrike&quot;.

From 1993 to 1995, he narrated the animated television series &quot;Madeline&quot;, for which he received an Emmy Award, as well as the animated television series &quot;The World of David the Gnome&quot;. He appeared with Jason Robards in the 1994 revival of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; by the Roundabout Theatre Company. &quot;Variety&quot; film critic Jeremy Gerard praised Plummer&#x27;s performance while critiquing Robards by writing, &quot;They&#x27;re a remarkable pair to watch wrangling with Pinter&#x27;s elliptical, often uncrackable script. As it happens, Plummer emerges triumphant, while Robards seems utterly at sea...Plummer plays the humour and the bathos with equal ease and complete conviction. By turns funny and heartbreaking, it&#x27;s an exquisite, haunting performance.&quot; For his performance Plummer received his fourth Tony Award nomination.

Plummer achieved great success in the 1997 Broadway production of the William Luce play &quot;Barrymore&quot; portraying John Barrymore a few months before his death. Vincent Canby in his &quot;New York Times&quot; review he praised Plummer for his performance &quot;With the confidence of the superb actor he has become, and in the trim of an athlete, Christopher Plummer is here in a new play, giving an achingly funny, memorably strong and debonair performance&quot;. After a successful run on Broadway he went on tour with production. His performance brought him his second Tony Award (this time as Best Actor in a Play) and a Drama Desk Award as Outstanding Actor in a Play. Plummer continued acting in films including the science fiction film &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; (1991), which was a welcome opportunity for him since he was a fan of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise which also allowed him to perform with his former understudy and long-time friend, William Shatner. He also appeared in Spike Lee&#x27;s biographical drama &quot;Malcolm X&quot; (1992), Mike Nichols&#x27; horror drama &quot;Wolf&quot; (1994), Taylor Hackford&#x27;s psychological drama &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; (1995), and Terry Gilliam&#x27;s science fiction drama &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (1995). Plummer portrayed George Hees in the Canadian miniseries &quot;The Arrow&quot; (1997).

=== 1998–2009: Established actor ===

One of Plummer&#x27;s most critically acclaimed roles was that of television journalist Mike Wallace in Michael Mann&#x27;s biographical film &quot;The Insider&quot; (1999), for which he was honoured with several critics&#x27; awards for Best Supporting Actor, though a corresponding Academy Award nomination did not materialize. Plummer&#x27;s other turns from this period include his roles as Dr. Rosen in Ron Howard&#x27;s Academy Award-winning biographical film &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; (2001), Uncle Ralph to the title character in the 2002 film adaptation of Charles Dickens novel &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;, Arthur Case in Spike Lee&#x27;s film &quot;Inside Man&quot; (2006), and the philosopher Aristotle in &quot;Alexander&quot;, alongside Colin Farrell. In 2004, Plummer briefly played John Adams Gates in the Disney adventure film &quot;National Treasure&quot;. He also appeared in Stephen Gaghan&#x27;s drama &quot;Syriana&quot; (2005), the romantic comedy &quot;Must Love Dogs&quot; (2005), Terrence Malick&#x27;s historical drama &quot;The New World&quot; (2005), and the romantic drama &quot;The Lake House&quot; (2006). In 2009, Plummer gave a voice performance for Pixar&#x27;s animated film &quot;Up&quot; where he played the antagonistic character Charles Muntz. That same year he also lent his voice in Tim Burton-produced action/science fiction film &quot;9&quot; playing elder leader 1.

In 2000, Plummer played Sir David Maxwell Fyfe in the Primetime Emmy Award-winning &quot;Nuremberg&quot; (2000) alongside Alec Baldwin, Brian Cox and Max Von Sydow, and the Emmy-winning &quot;The Moneychangers&quot; (for which he won his first Emmy Award as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series). That same year he co-starred in &quot;American Tragedy&quot; as F. Lee Bailey (for which he received a Golden Globe Award nomination), and appeared in TV movie &quot;Four Minutes&quot;, &quot;Miracle Planet&quot;, and a documentary by Ric Burns about Eugene O&#x27;Neill. He received an Emmy Award nomination for his performance in &quot;Our Fathers&quot; and reunited with Julie Andrews for a television production of &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;. He was the narrator for &quot;The Gospel of John&quot;. Plummer appeared as a presenter in the CPAC documentary series &quot;The Prime Ministers&quot; in 2004. He appeared in the third episode, &quot;John Abbott&quot; (as Plummer is Abbott&#x27;s great-grandson).

In 2002, he appeared in a lauded production of &quot;King Lear&quot;, directed by Jonathan Miller. The production successfully transferred to New York City&#x27;s Lincoln Center in 2004. He was nominated for a Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award for his 2004 &quot;King Lear&quot; and for a Tony Award playing Henry Drummond in the 2007 revival of &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;. He returned to the stage at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in August 2008 in a critically acclaimed performance as Julius Caesar in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; directed by Tony Award winner Des McAnuff; this production was videotaped and shown in high definition in Canadian cinemas on January 31, 2009 (with an encore presentation on February 23, 2009) and broadcast on April 4, 2009, on Bravo! in Canada.

In 2009 and 2010, Plummer starred in two stage to screen adaptations of the Stratford Festival productions of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; and William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. Both plays were directed for the stage by Des McAnuff and produced by Barry Avrich. The Tempest won Plummer a Canadian Screen award for Best Performance in a Performing Arts Program. Plummer returned to the Stratford Festival in the summer of 2010 in &quot;The Tempest&quot; as the lead character, Prospero (also videotaped and shown in high definition in cinemas), and again in the summer of 2012 in the one-man show, &quot;A Word or Two&quot;, an autobiographical exploration of his love of literature. In 2014, Plummer presented &quot;A Word or Two&quot; again, at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles.

=== 2010–2021: Resurgence and final roles ===
In January 2010, Plummer received his first Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of author Leo Tolstoy in &quot;The Last Station&quot; (2009). Speaking to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in an interview that aired on March 7, 2010, Plummer added, tongue-in-cheek, &quot;Well, I said it&#x27;s about time! I mean, I&#x27;m 80 years old, for God&#x27;s sake. Have mercy.&quot; On Oscar night, March 7, 2010, however, he lost to Christoph Waltz. That same year, Plummer appeared in David Fincher&#x27;s English-language film adaptation of Stieg Larsson&#x27;s book &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot; starring Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara and Stellan Skarsgård. The film was a critical and commercial success. Earlier that year, Plummer received his second nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Mike Mills&#x27; independent comedy drama film &quot;Beginners&quot; (2011) starring Ewan McGregor and Mélanie Laurent&quot;.&quot; Plummer was announced as the winner at the 84th Academy Awards&quot;.&quot; Plummer&#x27;s win made him, at age 82, the oldest actor to win an Academy Award. When he accepted the award, he quipped: &quot;You&#x27;re only two years older than me, darling. Where have you been all my life?&quot;

In 2011, he appeared in the feature-length documentary &quot;The Captains&quot;. The film, written and directed by William Shatner, sees Shatner interview Plummer at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival Theatre where they talk about their young careers, long lasting friendship, and Plummer&#x27;s role as Chang in &quot;Star Trek VI&quot;. The film references that Shatner, two years Plummer&#x27;s junior, was the other&#x27;s understudy in a production of &quot;Henry V&quot; at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. When Plummer had fallen ill, Shatner took the stage, earning his first big break. Plummer voiced Arngeir, speaker for the Greybeards, in the video game &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot;. In 2015, he starred in the Atom Egoyan-directed thriller &quot;Remember&quot;, alongside Martin Landau and Bruno Ganz. Plummer played Ebenezer Scrooge in &quot;The Man Who Invented Christmas&quot; (2017), which is based on Charles Dickens&#x27; novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.

In November 2017, Plummer, who was director Ridley Scott&#x27;s original choice to play J. Paul Getty in &quot;All the Money in the World&quot;, was cast to replace Kevin Spacey in the then-already completed film. The move came amid numerous sexual misconduct allegations made against Spacey. All scenes that had included Spacey were re-shot with Plummer. Co-stars Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams were part of the necessary filming. The decision was made not long before the scheduled release date of December 22. TriStar Pictures intended to meet that release date in spite of the tight re-shooting and editing schedule; it was eventually pushed back to December 25. For his role, Plummer earned Golden Globe, BAFTA and Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor.

He starred in the Rian Johnson directed mystery thriller ensemble film &quot;Knives Out&quot; (2019) alongside Ana de Armas, Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Lakeith Stanfield and Michael Shannon. Plummer plays Harlan Thrombey, a wealthy mystery novelist whose family is celebrating his 85th birthday party when a death occurs. The film premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival to positive reviews. It was an immense box office success. It was selected by the American Film Institute and the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2019. At the age of 89, he appeared in a leading role in &quot;Departure&quot;, a 2019 Canadian-British TV series by Global for NBCUniversal about the disappearance of a trans-Atlantic flight. Plummer was set to return to &quot;Departure&quot; for season 2. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Canadian travel lockdown, he would film his parts from his home in Connecticut, instead of venturing to Toronto, in 2020 and 2021. He completed his filming for the second season shortly before his death. In 2021, Plummer was set to play the lead for a film adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;, to be filmed in the summer, in Newfoundland, under director Des McAnuff. He died before filming commenced.

==Other works==
Plummer wrote for the stage, television and concert-hall. He and Sir Neville Marriner rearranged William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot; with Sir William Walton&#x27;s music as a concert piece. They recorded the work with Marriner&#x27;s chamber orchestra the Academy of St Martin in the Fields. He performed it and other works with the New York Philharmonic and symphony orchestras of London, Washington, D.C., Cleveland, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Toronto, Vancouver and Halifax. With Marriner, he made his Carnegie Hall debut in his own arrangements of Mendelssohn&#x27;s incidental music to &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

==Personal life==
Plummer was married three times. His first wife was actress Tammy Grimes, whom he married in 1956. Their marriage lasted four years, and they had a daughter together, the actress Amanda Plummer. 

He was next married to British entertainment journalist Patricia Lewis. Prior to their marriage they were involved in a major car crash outside Buckingham Palace after leaving The Establishment club in Soho (owned by comedian-actor Peter Cook). Plummer was uninjured, but Lewis was in a coma for several weeks; they married May 4, 1962 after her recovery and were divorced in 1967.

Three years after his second divorce, Plummer married actress Elaine Taylor on October 2, 1970. They lived in Weston, Connecticut. Plummer had no children with either his second or his third wife.

Plummer&#x27;s memoir, &quot;In Spite of Myself&quot;, was published by Alfred A. Knopf in November 2008. He was a patron of Theatre Museum Canada. He was a member of The Players social club in New York City.

==Death and legacy ==
Plummer died at his home in Weston, on February 5, 2021, at the age of 91. According to Taylor, he died two and a half weeks after a fall that resulted in a blow to the head. A statement released by the family announced that Plummer had died peacefully with Taylor by his side.

Following the announcement of his death, his &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; co-star Julie Andrews paid tribute:

Others who paid tribute to Plummer included Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Katherine Langford, Rian Johnson, Chris Evans and Don Johnson (who all collaborated with him on &quot;Knives Out&quot;), as well as William Shatner, Anne Hathaway, Elijah Wood, Vera Farmiga, Ed Asner (his costar in &quot;Up&quot; who also died in 2021), Ridley Scott, Spike Lee, Simon Pegg, Antonio Banderas, Leonard Maltin, Daniel Dae Kim, George Takei, Russell Crowe (his costar in &quot;The Insider&quot; and &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;), Bruce Greenwood and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

Lou Pitt, Plummer&#x27;s manager of 46 years, said in a statement:

A postage stamp paying tribute to Christopher Plummer was released by Canada Post on October 13, 2021.

==Awards and honours ==
Plummer is one of the few performers to have received the Triple Crown of Acting, and he is the only Canadian to accomplish this feat. He has received an Academy Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards and two Tony Awards. He has also received a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Independent Spirit Award and Screen Actors Guild Award.

In 2012, he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor at the age of 82 for &quot;Beginners&quot; (2011), becoming the oldest person to win an acting award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (a distinction he held until being supplanted by 83-year-old Anthony Hopkins in 2021), and he also received an Oscar nomination at the age of 88 for &quot;All the Money in the World&quot;, making him the oldest person to be nominated in any acting category at the Academy Awards.

Plummer has been recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) for the following performances:
* 82nd Academy Awards: Best Actor in a Supporting Role, nominee, &quot;The Last Station&quot; (2009)
* 84th Academy Awards: Best Actor in a Supporting Role, winner, &quot;Beginners&quot; (2011)
* 90th Academy Awards: Best Actor in a Supporting Role, nominee, &quot;All the Money in the World&quot; (2017)

In 2016, Plummer received the Canadian Screen Award for Lifetime Achievement. Over his distinguished career he received numerous honours from Canada. In 1968, he was invested as Companion of the Order of Canada, at the time among Canada&#x27;s highest civilian honours. In 2001, he received the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, Canada&#x27;s highest honour in the performing arts. He was made an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts at New York&#x27;s Juilliard School and has received honorary doctorates from the University of Toronto, Ryerson University (now Toronto Metropolitan University), McGill University, the University of Western Ontario, the University of Ottawa, and most recently the University of Guelph. Plummer was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1986 and into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in Toronto in 1998. He was a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in the Actor&#x27;s Branch from 2007.

<text>The Steve Bartman incident was a controversial play that occurred during a baseball game between the Chicago Cubs and the Florida Marlins on October 14, 2003, at Wrigley Field in Chicago, Illinois, during Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 2003 postseason. The play involved a spectator attempting to catch a fly ball and potentially affecting the outcome of the game.

The incident occurred in Game 6 of the National League Championship Series (NLCS), with Chicago leading 3–0 in the eighth inning and holding a three-games-to-two lead in the best-of-seven series. Marlins batter Luis Castillo hit a fly ball into foul territory in left field. Cubs outfielder Moisés Alou attempted to make the catch near the wall, but Cubs fan Steve Bartman deflected it; the umpire judged the play not to be fan interference. If Alou had caught the ball, it would have been the second out in the inning, and the Cubs would have been just four outs away from winning their first National League pennant since 1945.

However, following the ruling of no interference, the Cubs&#x27; defense collapsed. On the very next pitch, Mark Prior threw a wild pitch to walk Castillo and allow Juan Pierre to reach third base. After a run-scoring single to cut the Cubs&#x27; lead to 3–1, Cubs shortstop Alex Gonzalez mishandled a ground ball that could have resulted in an inning-ending double play. The Cubs ultimately allowed eight runs in the inning and lost the game 8–3. They also lost in Game 7 at Wrigley Field the following day and were eliminated by the Marlins.

In the moments following the play, Cubs fans shouted insults and threw debris at Bartman. For his safety, security was forced to escort him from the ballpark. Minutes after the game, his name and personal information were published online, necessitating police protection at his home. He faced further harassment from fans and the media after the Cubs&#x27; loss in the series. Bartman apologized for the incident and stated his desire to move past it and return to a quiet life. Many Cubs players came to his defense, emphasizing that their performance was to blame for their loss. To recompense Bartman for his treatment, the Cubs sent him a championship ring after the team&#x27;s victory in the 2016 World Series 13 years later.

==Incident==
The incident occurred on October 14, 2003, at Wrigley Field, during Game 6 of the National League Championship Series (NLCS), which matched the Chicago Cubs against the Florida Marlins. At the time of the incident, Cubs pitcher Mark Prior had allowed only three hits and no runs entering the eighth inning. The Cubs led the game 3–0 and the best-of-seven series three games to two. They were five outs away from reaching the World Series for the first time since ; the Cubs had not been baseball&#x27;s champions since . Luis Castillo was at bat for the Marlins with one out and a full count, with teammate Juan Pierre on second base.
Cubs fan Steve Bartman was sitting in the front row along the left field corner wall behind the on-field bullpen when a pop foul off the bat of Castillo drifted toward his seat. Cubs left fielder Moisés Alou approached the wall, jumped, and reached for the ball. Bartman was one of several fans who attempted to catch the ball. As Bartman attempted to catch the ball, his hand slapped the ball, deflecting it away from Alou&#x27;s glove. Alou slammed his glove down in frustration and shouted at several fans. The Cubs, in particular Alou and Prior, argued for fan interference, but umpire Mike Everitt ruled there was no interference because the ball had broken the plane of the wall separating the field of play from the stands and entered the stands.

Cubs manager Dusty Baker did not see the play as it happened, because the curvature of the Cubs dugout blocked his view.

In the Marlins&#x27; dugout after the Bartman play, pitcher Mark Redman, who was scheduled to start Game 7 if the Marlins won, told his teammates &quot;Let&#x27;s make that guy famous.&quot;

Everitt&#x27;s ruling has been heavily scrutinized over the years. For example, the authors of &quot;Mad Ball: The Bartman Play&quot; argue that photographs show Bartman&#x27;s arms extending into the playing field and that Castillo should have been called out due to fan interference.

On Fox, commentator Thom Brennaman said &quot;Again in the air, down the left field line. Alou... reaching into the stands... and couldn&#x27;t get it and he&#x27;s livid with a fan!&quot;

==Aftermath==
===For the Cubs and Marlins===
Following the incident, the Marlins scored eight runs:
# Continuing his at bat, Castillo drew a walk. Ball four was a wild pitch from Prior, which allowed Juan Pierre, who doubled before Castillo came to bat, to advance to third base.
# Iván Rodríguez, on an 0–2 pitch, singled to drive in the first run of the inning, making the score 3–1.
# Miguel Cabrera hit a ground ball to Alex Gonzalez, who misfielded the ball. Had Gonzalez fielded the ball, the Cubs could have either ended the half-inning with a double play, still ahead by two runs, or at least added the second out. Instead, all runners were safe and the bases were loaded.
# Derrek Lee doubled, tying the score and chasing Prior from the game.
# Relief pitcher Kyle Farnsworth issued an intentional walk to Mike Lowell, then gave up a sacrifice fly to Jeff Conine, giving Florida a 4–3 lead. Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa missed the cut-off man, allowing Lowell to move up to second base. The Cubs issued another intentional walk to Todd Hollandsworth, which again loaded the bases.
# A bases-clearing double from Mike Mordecai, who led-off the half-inning, broke the game open, making the score 7–3.
# Mike Remlinger replaced Farnsworth and Pierre singled to put Florida ahead 8–3.
# Finally, Luis Castillo, whose foul pop initiated the controversy, popped out to second to end the inning. The Marlins had sent twelve batters to the plate and scored eight runs. Florida won the game 8–3.

The next night, back at Wrigley Field, Florida overcame Kerry Wood and a 5–3 deficit to win 9–6, and win the pennant. The Marlins would then go on to win the World Series, defeating the heavily favored New York Yankees in six games.

===For Bartman===
Bartman remained seated as Fox repeatedly alternated between broadcasting live shots of him with multiple instant replays of the foul ball. The somber image of Bartman wearing a Cubs baseball cap, glasses, headset, and green turtleneck shirt became memorable. Because there were no video replay screens at Wrigley Field at the time, Bartman was not widely recognized until many of the attendees&#x27; friends and family members, who were watching the game on television, started calling them on cell phones, informing them of Bartman and his appearance. After Rodriguez’s at bat ended with the Marlins scoring their first run, many Cubs fans began pointing at Bartman, repeatedly chanting &quot;asshole&quot;. Bartman had to be led away from the park under security escort for his own safety, as many Cubs fans shouted insults and threats at him (some of which were death threats), while others threw things, with one fan dumping a cup of beer on him. Security escorted Bartman and two people who accompanied him to the game towards the exit tunnel from the field. News footage of the game showed him surrounded by security as fans pelted him with drinks and other debris. Bartman&#x27;s name, as well as personal information about him, appeared on Major League Baseball&#x27;s online message boards minutes after the game ended. As many as six police cars gathered outside his home in Northbrook, Illinois to protect Bartman and his family following the incident. Afterwards, then-Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich suggested that Bartman join a witness protection program, while then-Florida Governor Jeb Bush offered Bartman asylum.

After the incident, Bartman released a statement, saying he was &quot;truly sorry&quot;. He added &quot;I had my eyes glued on the approaching ball the entire time and was so caught up in the moment that I did not even see Moisés Alou, much less that he may have had a play.&quot; Trying to maintain a low profile, Bartman declined interviews, endorsement deals, and requests for public appearances, and his family changed their phone number to avoid harassing phone calls. He requested that any gifts sent to him by Florida Marlins fans be donated to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. In July 2008, Bartman was offered $25,000 to autograph a picture of himself at the National Sports Collectors Convention in Rosemont, but he refused the offer. He declined to appear as a VIP at Wrigley Field. In 2011, eight years after the incident, he declined to appear in an ESPN documentary, and he declined a six-figure offer to appear in a Super Bowl commercial.

Many fans associated the Bartman incident with the Curse of the Billy Goat, allegedly laid on the Cubs during the 1945 World Series after Billy Sianis and his pet goat were ejected from Wrigley Field. The Cubs lost that series to the Detroit Tigers in seven games and did not return to the World Series until 2016. Bartman was also compared to the black cat that ran across Shea Stadium near an on-deck Ron Santo during a September 9, 1969, regular season game between the Cubs and the New York Mets. The Cubs were in first place at the time, but after the cat appeared, the Cubs lost the game and eventually fell eight games behind the Mets in the standings, missing that season&#x27;s playoffs. Fans further believed that they had been jinxed when, an inning before the incident, comedian Bernie Mac (a lifelong fan of the cross-town rival White Sox), singing &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch, prematurely referred to the Cubs as &quot;champs&quot;. On Fox, coming off a commercial break after the Marlins had tied the game as Lowell was being intentionally walked, Thom Brennaman said of the incident, as well as the Marlins&#x27; subsequent rally: &quot;It&#x27;s safe to say that every Cubs fan has to be wondering right now, is the Curse of the Billy Goat alive and well?&quot;

===Destruction of the Bartman ball===
The loose ball was snatched up by a Chicago lawyer and sold at an auction in December 2003. Grant DePorter purchased it for $113,824.16 on behalf of Harry Caray&#x27;s Restaurant Group. On February 26, 2004, it was publicly detonated by special effects expert Michael Lantieri.

In 2005, the remains of the ball were used by the restaurant in a pasta sauce. While no part of the ball itself was in the sauce, the ball was boiled and the steam captured, distilled, and added to the final concoction.

Today, the remains of the ball are on display at the Chicago Sports Museum, while further remains are amid various artifacts at the restaurant itself.

===The Bartman seat===
In the years following the incident, the seat Bartman sat in – Aisle 4, Row 8, Seat 113 – became a tourist attraction at Wrigley Field. When the lower grandstands were reconfigured before the 2017 season, that seat number was changed. It was changed to Section 2, Row 8, Seat 108. Before the 2019 season, more reconfiguration was done to the seats with the seat Bartman sat in once again being changed. It is now currently Section 3, Row 12, Seat 1.

===Moisés Alou===
In April 2008, Moisés Alou was quoted by the Associated Press as saying &quot;You know what the funny thing is? I wouldn&#x27;t have caught it, anyway.&quot; Alou later disputed that story, however: &quot;I don&#x27;t remember that,&quot; he said to a writer from &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot;. &quot;If I said that, I was probably joking to make [Bartman] feel better. But I don&#x27;t remember saying that.&quot; Alou added &quot;It&#x27;s time to forgive the guy and move on.&quot;

In the 2011 documentary &quot;Catching Hell&quot;, Alou states &quot;I&#x27;m convinced 100% that I had that ball in my glove.&quot;

==Defense of Bartman==
After the incident, the Cubs issued the following press release:

Several Cubs players publicly absolved Bartman of blame. Mark Prior said &quot;We had chances to get out of that situation. I hung an 0–2 curveball to [Ivan] Rodriguez that he hit for a single. Alex Gonzalez, who&#x27;s a sure thing almost at shortstop, the ball came up on him... and things just snowballed. Everybody in the clubhouse and management knows that play is not the reason we lost the game.&quot; Former Cubs pitcher Rick Sutcliffe said that the crowd&#x27;s reactions to Bartman &quot;crushed [him]&quot;. &quot;Right after I saw what happened with the fan, I woke up the next morning and told my wife that if the Cubs asked me to throw out the first pitch in the World Series, I was going to take that fan out to the mound with me,&quot; he said. Baseball commissioner Bud Selig also came to Bartman&#x27;s defense, telling an interviewer &quot;[W]hile I understand that people felt so strongly and that their hearts were just breaking, to blame this young man, who is the most devoted Cub fan... it&#x27;s just unfair. When I read his statement, it broke my heart. ... If you want to blame the Curse of the Bambino and the goat in Chicago or a series of other things, that&#x27;s fine. But blaming Steve Bartman is just not right.&quot;

Several of Bartman&#x27;s friends and family members spoke out in the days following the incident. His father told the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; &quot;He&#x27;s a huge Cubs fan. I&#x27;m sure I taught him well. I taught him to catch foul balls when they come near him.&quot; A neighbor added &quot;He&#x27;s a good kid, a wonderful son, never in any trouble. I don&#x27;t think he should be blamed at all. People reach for balls. This just happened to be a little more critical. If Florida didn&#x27;t score all the runs, you wouldn&#x27;t be standing here.&quot;

&quot;Sun-Times&quot; sports columnist Jay Mariotti wrote &quot;A fan in that situation should try his best to get out of the way, even if he isn&#x27;t of the mind to see Alou approaching, as Bartman claims. Still, he&#x27;s also a human being who was reacting in a tense, unusual moment. And the resulting verbal abuse and trash-hurling, followed by the Neanderthal threats and creepy reaction on the Internet, hasn&#x27;t reflected well on Chicago&#x27;s sports culture. As it is, everyone thinks the prototypical local fans are those mopes from the Superfans skits on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.&quot;

In a 2011 interview on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot;, Cubs President Theo Epstein expressed a desire for the team to reach out to Bartman. &quot;From afar, it seems like it would be an important step. Maybe a cathartic moment that would allow people to move forward together. I&#x27;m all about having an open mind, an open heart and forgiveness. Those are good characteristics for an organization to have as well. He&#x27;s a Cubs fan. That&#x27;s the most important thing,&quot; said Epstein.

In 2012, former Cubs player Doug Glanville said &quot;[I]t was easy to look at Steve Bartman [...] But that was not the whole story by a long shot.&quot; He argued that the Cubs lost the momentum of the series when Marlins ace Josh Beckett shut down the Cubs in Game 5. Glanville drew parallels between that game and Barry Zito&#x27;s game-winning performance in Game 5 of the 2012 NLCS.

==2016 Cubs victory in World Series==

During the 2016 season, Bartman received renewed media attention as the Cubs progressed through the playoffs. On Saturday, October 22, 2016, the Cubs were again at home with a 3–2 lead in Game 6 of the NLCS, similar to the 2003 NLCS game. The Cubs ended up winning the National League Championship Series and ending the Curse of the Billy Goat. In a surprising turn of events, a foul ball in the final inning fell near the area Bartman had sat in, prompting shouts of &quot;Don&#x27;t touch it&quot; from the crowd, though this foul ball fell well out of play. After winning the pennant, many Cubs fans petitioned for the team to allow Bartman to throw out a first pitch during the 2016 World Series. Nonetheless, Bartman&#x27;s spokesman Frank Murtha told CNN that Bartman did not want to be in the spotlight, and that there is &quot;probably a slim, none, and no chance&quot; that Bartman would agree to throw out a first pitch.

On November 2, 2016, the Chicago Cubs won the World Series for the first time since 1908. Through Murtha, Bartman congratulated the Cubs in their World Series championship. Murtha said &quot;[Bartman] was just overjoyed that the Cubs won, as all the Cubs fans are.&quot; Further, when calls were made for Bartman to be a part of the victory parade, or other similar ideas &quot;The one thing that Steve and I did talk about was if the Cubs were to win, he did not want to be a distraction to the accomplishments of the players and the organization.&quot;

MLB.com and ESPN have both reported that Cubs owner Tom Ricketts had expressed interest in contacting Bartman for closure &quot;at the right time&quot;. Later on, Cubs president Theo Epstein stated that Bartman is &quot;welcome to come back&quot; but at his own discretion and that he should be left alone. Bartman received a championship ring from Cubs owner Tom Ricketts and the Ricketts family as a special gift on July 31, 2017. The Cubs said in a statement &quot;We hope this provides closure on an unfortunate chapter of the story that has perpetuated throughout our quest to win a long-awaited World Series. While no gesture can fully lift the public burden he has endured for more than a decade, we felt it was important Steve knows he has been and continues to be fully embraced by this organization. After all he has sacrificed, we are proud to recognize Steve Bartman with this gift today.&quot;

Bartman released a statement, saying: Although I do not consider myself worthy of such an honor, I am deeply moved and sincerely grateful to receive an official Chicago Cubs 2016 World Series Championship ring. I am fully aware of the historical significance and appreciate the symbolism the ring represents on multiple levels. My family and I will cherish it for generations. Most meaningful is the genuine outreach from the Ricketts family, on behalf of the Cubs organization and fans, signifying to me that I am welcomed back into the Cubs family and have their support going forward. I am relieved and hopeful that the saga of the 2003 foul ball incident surrounding my family and me is finally over. I humbly receive the ring not only as a symbol of one of the most historic achievements in sports, but as an important reminder for how we should treat each other in today’s society. My hope is that we all can learn from my experience to view sports as entertainment and prevent harsh scapegoating, and to challenge the media and opportunistic profiteers to conduct business ethically by respecting personal privacy rights and not exploit any individual to advance their own self-interest or economic gain. Moreover, I am hopeful this ring gesture will be the start of an important healing and reconciliation process for all involved. To that end, I request the media please respect my privacy, and the privacy of my family. I will not participate in interviews or further public statements at this time. Words alone cannot express my heartfelt thanks to the Ricketts family, Crane Kenney, Theo Epstein, and the entire Cubs organization for this extraordinary gift, and for providing the City of Chicago and Cubs fans everywhere an unforgettable World Championship in 2016. I am happy to be reunited with the Cubs family and positively moving forward with my life.

<text>Sir Alan William Parker (14 February 1944 – 31 July 2020) was an English film director, screenwriter and producer. His early career, beginning in his late teens, was spent as a copywriter and director of television advertisements. After about ten years of filming adverts, many of which won awards for creativity, he began screenwriting and directing films.

Parker was known for using a wide range of filmmaking styles and working in differing genres. He directed musicals, including &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; (1976), &quot;Fame&quot; (1980), &quot;Pink Floyd – The Wall&quot; (1982), &quot;The Commitments&quot; (1991) and &quot;Evita&quot; (1996); true-story dramas, including &quot;Midnight Express&quot; (1978), &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; (1988), &quot;Come See the Paradise&quot; (1990) and &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot; (1999); family dramas, including &quot;Shoot the Moon&quot; (1982), and horrors and thrillers including &quot;Angel Heart&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot; (2003).

Parker&#x27;s films won nineteen BAFTA awards, ten Golden Globes and six Academy Awards. His film &quot;Birdy&quot; was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the Top Ten Films of 1984 and won the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury prize at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival. In 1984, Parker received the BAFTA for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema, and in 2002 he was knighted for his services to the film industry. He was active in both British cinema and American cinema, along with being a founding member of the Directors Guild of Great Britain and lecturing at various film schools.

In 2000, Parker received the Royal Photographic Society Lumière Award for major achievement in cinematography, video or animation. In 2013, he received the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award, the highest honour the British Film Academy can give a filmmaker. Parker donated his personal archive to the British Film Institute&#x27;s National Archive in 2015.

==Early years and education ==
Parker was born on 14 February 1944 into a working-class family in Islington, North London, the son of Elsie Ellen, a dressmaker, and William Leslie Parker, a house painter. He grew up on a council estate in Islington, which always made it easy for him to remain &quot;almost defiantly working-class in attitudes&quot; said the British novelist and screenwriter Ray Connolly. Parker said that although he had his share of fun growing up, he always felt he was studying for his secondary school exams, while his friends were out having a good time. He had an &quot;ordinary background&quot; with no aspirations to become a film director, nor did anyone in his family have any desire to be involved in the film industry. The closest he ever came, he said, to anything related to films was learning photography, a hobby inspired by his uncles: &quot;... that early introduction to photography is something I remember.&quot;

Parker attended Dame Alice Owen&#x27;s School, concentrating on science in his last year. He left school when he was 18 to work in the advertising field, hoping that the advertising industry might be a good way to meet girls.

==Career==

=== 1962–1975: Early work and breakthrough ===
Parker&#x27;s first job was office boy in the post room of Ogilvy &amp; Mather an advertising agency in London. But more than anything, he said, he wanted to write, and would write essays and ads when he got home after work. His colleagues also encouraged him to write, which soon led him to a position as a copywriter in the company. Parker took jobs with different agencies over the next few years, having by then become proficient as a copywriter. One such agency was Collett Dickenson Pearce in London, where he first met the future producers David Puttnam and Alan Marshall, both of whom would later produce many of his films. Parker credited Puttnam with inspiring him and talking him into writing his first film script, &quot;Melody&quot; (1971).

By 1968, Parker had moved from copywriting to successfully directing numerous television advertisements. In 1970, he joined Marshall to establish a company to make advertisements. That company eventually became one of Britain&#x27;s best commercial production houses, winning nearly every major national and international award open to it. Among their award-winning adverts were the UK Cinzano vermouth advertisement (starring Joan Collins and Leonard Rossiter), and a Heineken advert which used 100 actors. Parker credited his years writing and directing adverts for his later success as a film director: 

After writing the screenplay for the Waris Hussein film &quot;Melody&quot; in 1971, Parker shot his first fictional film titled &quot;No Hard Feelings&quot; in 1972, for which he wrote the script. The film is a bleak love story set against the Blitz in London during the Second World War, when the Luftwaffe bombed the city for 57 consecutive nights. Parker was born during one of those bombing raids, and said &quot;the baby in that [film] could well have been me&quot;. With no feature film directing experience, he could not find financial backing, and decided to risk using his own money and funds from mortgaging his house to cover the cost. The film impressed the BBC, which bought the film and showed it on television a few years later in 1976. The BBC producer Mark Shivas had, in the interim, also contracted Parker to direct &quot;The Evacuees&quot; (1975), a Second World War story written by Jack Rosenthal which was shown as a &quot;Play for Today&quot;. The work was based on true events which involved the evacuation of school children from central Manchester. &quot;The Evacuees&quot; won a BAFTA for best TV drama and also an Emmy for best International Drama.

Parker next wrote and directed his first feature film, &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; (1976), a parody of early American gangster films and American musicals, but with only child actors. Parker&#x27;s desire in making the film was to entertain both children and adults with a unique concept and style of film:
The film received eight British Academy Award nominations and five Awards, including two BAFTAs for Jodie Foster.

=== 1978–1990: Subsequent success ===
Parker next directed &quot;Midnight Express&quot; (1978), based on a true account by Billy Hayes about his incarceration and escape from a Turkish prison for trying to smuggle hashish out of the country. Parker made the film in order to do something radically different from &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot;, which would broaden his style of filmmaking. The script was written by Oliver Stone in his first screenplay, and won Stone his first Academy Award. The music was composed by Giorgio Moroder, who was also awarded his first Oscar for the film. &quot;Midnight Express&quot; established Parker as a &quot;front rank director&quot;, as both he and the film were Oscar nominated. The success of that film also gave him the freedom from then on to direct films of his own choosing.

Parker then directed &quot;Fame&quot; (1980), which follows the lives of eight students through their years at the New York City&#x27;s High School of Performing Arts. It was a huge box-office success and led to a television spin-off series of the same name. Parker stated that after doing a serious drama like &quot;Midnight Express&quot;, he wanted to do a film with music, but very different from typical musicals of the past. Having already done &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot;, he felt confident that he knew how to go about creating a musical where the songs emerge from real situations.

Actress Irene Cara recalled that &quot;the nice thing about the way Alan works with everyone is that he allowed us to really feel like classmates.&quot; However, Parker was refused permission to use the actual school portrayed in the film because of the foul language in the screenplay.

Parker&#x27;s next film was &quot;Shoot the Moon&quot; (1982), the story of a marital break-up that takes place in Northern California. Parker calls it &quot;the first grown-up film that I&#x27;d done&quot;. He again chose to direct a subject distinctly different from his previous film, explaining, &quot;I really try to do different work. I think that by doing different work each time, it keeps you creatively fresher.&quot; He described the theme of the film being about &quot;two people who can&#x27;t live together but who also can&#x27;t let go of one another. A story of fading love, senseless rage, and the inevitable bewildering betrayal in the eyes of the children.&quot; Its stars, Albert Finney and Diane Keaton, received Golden Globe nominations for their performances.

The film also had a personal significance for Parker, who said he was forced to examine his own marriage: &quot;It was a painful film to make for me because there were echoes of my own life in it. It was about a breakup of a marriage, and the children in the story were quite close to my own children in age. &quot;Shoot the Moon&quot; was very, very close to my own life.&quot; He spent days with the writer Bo Goldman on developing a realistic story, and states that his marriage became &quot;infinitely stronger&quot; as a result of the film.

Also in 1982 Parker directed a film version of the Pink Floyd conceptual rock opera, &quot;The Wall&quot;, which starred Boomtown Rats frontman Bob Geldof as the fictive rocker &quot;Pink&quot;. Parker later described the filming as &quot;one of the most miserable experiences of my creative life.&quot; Though not a major box office success, receiving lukewarm reviews from critics, the film has since become a cult classic amongst Pink Floyd fans.

Parker directed &quot;Birdy&quot; (1984), starring Matthew Modine and Nicolas Cage. It recounts the story of two school friends who have returned from the Vietnam War but who were both psychologically and physically injured. Parker called it a &quot;wonderful story&quot; after having read the book by William Wharton. However, because of the nature of the story, he had no idea how to make it into a movie: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know if you could take the poetry of the book and make it cinematic poetry, or if an audience would actually want it.&quot;

The film became a critical success. Richard Schickel says that Parker had &quot;transcended realism ... [and] achieved his personal best&quot;, while Derek Malcolm considers &quot;Birdy&quot; to be Parker&#x27;s &quot;most mature and perhaps his best movie&quot;. The message of the film, writes critic Quentin Falk, is &quot;joyously life-affirming&quot;, which he notes is common to much of Parker&#x27;s work. He adds that Parker&#x27;s films manage to achieve a blend of &quot;strong story and elegant frame&quot;, a style which he says typically eludes other directors who rely too much on the purely visual.

Continuing to explore different genres, Parker made a film that bridged horror and thriller territory, &quot;Angel Heart&quot; (1987), starring Mickey Rourke, Lisa Bonet, and Robert De Niro. He later wrote that he was fascinated by its &quot;fusion of two genres: the noir, Chandleresque detective novel and the supernatural.&quot; The film was a disappointment at the box office, and received mixed reviews at the time, but has since become a cult classic.

With &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; (1988), Parker received his second Oscar nomination for Best Director. The film is based on a true story about the murders of three civil rights workers in 1964, and stars Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe. Hackman was nominated for Best Actor, while the film was nominated for five other Oscars, including Best Picture. It won for Best Cinematography.

Despite commercial success, &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; received considerable criticism for centering three white characters in a story about the civil rights movement. Parker later wrote, &quot;Certainly, the two protagonists of &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; are white. At that time the film would never have been made if they weren&#x27;t.&quot; He tried to address this in his next movie, &quot;Come See the Paradise&quot; (1990), about the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Before and after making the film, he sought input from the community, agreeing to cast Japanese-American actress Tamlyn Tomita in the lead instead of a Chinese-American actress. However, the film ultimately faced similar criticism to &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot;, for focusing on a white character played by Dennis Quaid. As one woman who was born in the Gila River internment camp told the &quot;Rafu Shimpo&quot; newspaper, &quot;My parents saw the movie and they said the camp scenes were authentic. It was interesting for me. I liked it.&quot; However, she added, &quot;I would&#x27;ve preferred to see a Japanese actor in the role of Dennis Quaid.&quot;

===1991–2003: Later works===
In 1991 Parker directed &quot;The Commitments&quot;, a comedy about working class Dubliners who form a soul band. The film was an international success and led to a successful soundtrack album. To find a cast Parker visited most of the estimated 1,200 different bands then playing throughout Dublin. He met with over 3,000 different band members. Rather than pick known actors, Parker says he chose young musicians, most of whom had no acting experience, in order to remain &quot;truthful to the story&quot;. &quot;I cast everybody to be very close to the character that they play in the film. They&#x27;re not really playing outside of who they are as people.&quot; Parker says he wanted to make the film because he could relate to the hardships in the lives of young Dubliners, having come from a similar working-class background in north London.

Film critic David Thomson observes that with &quot;The Commitments&quot;, Parker &quot;showed an unusual fondness for people, place, and music. It was as close as Parker has come to optimism.&quot; Parker said that it was the &quot;most enjoyable&quot; time he had making a film, to the extent that he would have been glad he made it even if it had ended up being terrible.

Parker&#x27;s next film was &quot;The Road to Wellville&quot;, an adaptation of T. C. Boyle&#x27;s novel about Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, the eccentric inventor of corn flakes (played by Anthony Hopkins). The film proved unsuccessful with both audiences and critics. However, novelist Boyle was pleased with the adaptation, calling it &quot;daring, experimental, ballsy – it&#x27;s something new for Christ&#x27;s sake, new!… and killingly funny.&quot;

&quot;Evita&quot; (1996), was another musical, starring Madonna, Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice&#x27;s score originated from the earlier musical. &quot;Evita&quot; was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning for Best Original Song, which was sung by Madonna.

Parker&#x27;s next film was &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot; (1999), a drama based on the real-life experiences of the Irish-American teacher Frank McCourt and his childhood. His family was forced to move from the United States back to Ireland because of financial difficulties, which led to the family&#x27;s problems caused by his father&#x27;s alcoholism.

Colm Meaney, who acted in &quot;The Commitments&quot;, noticed the dramatic shift in theme and style of Parker&#x27;s films. He said &quot;It&#x27;s the variety of his work that sort of staggers me. He can go from &quot;Evita&quot; to &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot;. When Alan starts a project, it&#x27;s going to be something very interesting and completely out of left field.&quot; Parker explained that &quot;To do a film like &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot;, I suppose, was my reaction against a big film like &quot;Evita&quot;.&quot; He said that he tried to avoid the &quot;obvious movies&quot;, and &quot;You want the film to stay with people afterwards ... It just seems to me that the greatest crime is to make just another movie.&quot; Parker said it is important to carefully choose which films to write and direct:

Therefore, when Parker visited film schools and spoke to young filmmakers, he told them that the new film technology available for making films and telling a story is less important than conveying a message: &quot;If you haven&#x27;t got something to say, I don&#x27;t think you should be a filmmaker&quot;.

British film critic Geoff Andrew described Parker as a &quot;natural storyteller&quot; who got his message across using &quot;dramatic lighting, vivid characterisation, scenes of violent conflict regularly interrupting sequences of expository dialogue, and an abiding sympathy for the underdog (he is a born liberal with a keen sense of injustice)&quot;.

Parker produced and directed &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot; (2003), a crime thriller about an advocate for the abolition of capital punishment who finds himself on death row after having been convicted of murdering a fellow activist. The film received generally poor reviews.

==Personal life==
Parker was married twice; first to Annie Inglis from 1966 until their divorce in 1992, and then to producer Lisa Moran, to whom he was married until his death. He had five children, including screenwriter Nathan Parker.

Parker died in London on 31 July 2020 at age 76, following a lengthy illness.

==Honours and awards==
Parker was nominated for eight BAFTA awards, three Golden Globes and two Oscars. He was a founding member of the Directors Guild of Great Britain and lectured at film schools around the world. In 1985, the British Academy awarded him the Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Cinema. Parker was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1995 Birthday Honours and Knight Bachelor in the 2002 New Year Honours for services to the film industry. In 1999 he was given the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Directors Guild of Great Britain. He became chairman of the Board of Governors of the British Film Institute (BFI) in 1998 and in 1999 was appointed the first chairman of the newly formed UK Film Council.

In 2005 Parker received an honorary Doctorate of Arts from the University of Sunderland of which his long-time associate Lord Puttnam is chancellor. In 2004 he was the Chairman of the Jury at the 26th Moscow International Film Festival. In 2013 he was awarded the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award &quot;in recognition of outstanding achievement in the art forms of the moving image&quot;, which is the highest honour the British Academy can bestow.

The British Film Institute (BFI) produced a tribute to Parker in September and October 2015 with an event titled &quot;Focus on Sir Alan Parker&quot; which included multiple screenings of his films and an on-stage interview of Parker by producer David Puttnam. The event coincided and marked the donation his entire working archive to the BFI National Archive.

<text>Stocksbridge is a town and civil parish, it is encircled to the north and east by the southern edge of the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley, although since 1974 it lies within the borders of the City of Sheffield, in South Yorkshire, England. The town is approximately from Barnsley and from Sheffield.

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it lies just to the east of the Peak District. The town is located in the steep-sided valley of the Little Don River, below the Underbank Reservoir. It blends into the areas of Deepcar, Bolsterstone and the eastern end of Ewden valley around Ewden village, which are also within the civil parish. The population of the civil parish as of the 2011 census was 13,455.

== Early history ==
Until the early 18th century, what is now Stocksbridge was a deciduously wooded valley, running from Midhopestones at its northwestern extremity to Deepcar at its southeastern end. A river, originally called the Hunshelf Water and later renamed the Little Don, ran through the valley. This river was also, unofficially, called the Porter, probably on account of its peaty colour. A dirt road, connecting Sheffield with Manchester, ran through the woods adjacent to the river. There were a few stone houses in the valley and a sprinkling of farms on each hillside.

In 1716 John Stocks, a local farmer and landowner, occupied a fulling mill halfway along the valley where a flood plain, created by meltwater at the end of the last ice age, extended southwest from the river. Here he reputedly built a footbridge over the river, perhaps so that his workforce could reach the mill from their homes on the north side. This originally wooden structure, Stocks&#x27; Bridge, gave the place its name, not only because it was about the only thing there apart from the mill itself, but also because as a crossing place it appeared under that name on Thomas Jeffrey&#x27;s map of 1772, so establishing itself as a place name. On various occasions, this bridge was destroyed by flooding, and it was eventually replaced by a stone structure in 1812.

In 1794 three businessmen, Jonathan Denton, Benjamin Grayson and Thomas Cannon, built a large cotton mill extremely close by, or possibly upon, the site of the original mill.

The parish church of St Matthias was consecrated in 1890.

Stocksbridge historically straddled the large parishes of Penistone and Ecclesfield. In 1872 a local government district called Stocksbridge was created, governed by an elected local board. Such districts were converted into urban districts in 1894. The current Stocksbridge Town Hall was constructed in 1928. The district was merged into the City of Sheffield in 1974.

==Steel industry==

The valley bottom today is almost entirely occupied by steel works. Samuel Fox acquired the old cotton mill in 1842, at first renting it from its then owner, Joshua Newton. Nine years later, in 1851, he purchased the mill outright from Joshua&#x27;s son, Thomas Newton. Fox converted the place to use as a wire mill, and built much of the infrastructure of Stocksbridge, primarily to house his new workforce and to supply their needs. The wire was initially for textile pins, but around 1848 the business expanded to include wire for umbrella frames which led to Fox developing the “Paragon” umbrella frame in 1851.

The business continued to expand, and extended into different products, but underwent a major change in direction in the early 1860s when Fox realized that he could save large amounts of money by making his own steel for the wire, rather than buying it in. Furnaces and a rolling mill were installed, which in turn allowed the production of railway lines and springs. The business was incorporated into a limited company in 1871.

Between 1872 and 1877 a railway line was built to link the works with the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway at Deepcar railway station. This was the Stocksbridge Railway, which existed as a subsidiary company until 1992. Although the Sheffield to Manchester route via the Woodhead Tunnel was closed to traffic in 1981, a single-track section from Sheffield to Stocksbridge via Deepcar remains to serve the steel works.

Samuel Fox &amp; Co joined Steel, Peech and Tozer at Templeborough to form the United Steel Companies (USC) following the First World War. From then on the products of the USC sites were coordinated so that each works specialised in set products. Fox’s specialised in special steel produce such as spring steel and stainless steels. This developed into the manufacture of high-quality steel for the aviation industry. One specialised department assembled and tested springs for Rolls-Royce cars.

During the Second World War, &#x27;Sammy Fox&#x27;s&#x27; Steelworks was kept busy as part of the war effort. During the Sheffield Blitz by the Luftwaffe, the bombers used the dam at the end of Stocksbridge as a turning point for their run back toward Sheffield.

Following nationalisation in 1967, the British Steel Corporation split the stainless steel departments off into a separate business which by 2004 had become part of Outokumpu.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the Stocksbridge works was part of the United Engineering Steels group (a joint venture between British Steel and GKN) and was known as &quot;Stocksbridge Engineering Steels&quot;.

In 1999 the works were taken over by Corus and are part of the Corus Engineering Steels (CES) group. Although for several years Corus ran at a loss, it returned to profit, in part helped by a rise in demand for steel caused by Chinese economic activity.

Steel manufacture in Stocksbridge had always been by melting iron and steel firstly in crucibles (from 1860), then Bessemer converters (from 1862) and Siemens Open Hearth Furnaces (from 1899 until 1968) and lastly Electric arc furnaces (from 1939 until 2005). Iron has never been produced from iron ore at Fox&#x27;s, by any method.

In October 2006, Corus was taken over by the Indian company Tata. Corus Engineering Steels (Stocksbridge site) was renamed Tata Steels Speciality. During the 2008 recession Stocksbridge works reduced its workforce and output, focusing on producing lower quantities of high-value product for the aerospace and oil and gas markets. After the recession the company returned to profitability and began investing once again. In 2011 £6.5 million was invested in boosting the site&#x27;s ability to produce aerospace steel, and further developments were planned for 2013.

In December 2015 Tata came under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office in connection with the alleged falsification of certificates guaranteeing the quality of its speciality steels. This was then followed in early 2016 by an announcement from Tata that they would be selling their entire steelmaking interests in the UK, due, they said, to crippling electricity prices in the UK which are more than double the price in the European Union and in other competing countries, and to large volumes of cheap steel which are being exported to the west by China. If a buyer could not be found, then steelmaking in the Stocksbridge valley would finally end, after almost 160 years.

On 9 February 2017 it was announced by Tata and by the Liberty House Group, that the latter had purchased Tata&#x27;s entire UK steelmaking operation for GBP 100 million. This has secured the continuation of steelmaking in the Stocksbridge valley. In May 2021 Liberty Steel Group put the Stocksbridge business up for sale, a consequence of the collapse of Greensill Capital in March 2021.

== Transport ==
The main road from Sheffield to Manchester passed through the town until the A616 Stocksbridge bypass opened in 1988. The new road links the M1 motorway at Junction 35A (and J36) to the A628 (which is one of the main trans-Pennine routes from Sheffield to Manchester) bypassing the towns of Stocksbridge and Deepcar, diverting the steelworks traffic away from passing through the town.

Stocksbridge has bus services that connect the town to Sheffield City Centre, Middlewood tram stop and Barnsley Interchange. The 57/57A (operated by Stagecoach Yorkshire) runs every 30 minutes. The 57 serves Unsliven Bridge (the western part of the town) to Sheffield City Centre, and the 57A serves Stocksbridge Leisure Centre and Worrall to Sheffield City Centre. Service 201 (operated by South Pennine Community Transport) runs hourly connecting Stocksbridge to Chapeltown. Service 23/23A (South Pennine Community Transport) connects Stocksbridge to Millhouse Green hourly, and Barnsley twice a day. Smaller services, such as the 34 and the 26 (also operated by South Pennine Community Transport), serve Northern College to Barnsley Interchange and Penistone, respectively.

A railway line runs from Stocksbridge to Sheffield via Deepcar, but is currently used only for steel freight trains. Proposals are regularly made to re-open it as a passenger line.

== Culture ==

The British Steel Stocksbridge Band [sic] is credited with performing &quot;Slaidburn&quot; in the trailer of the 1997 film &quot;The Full Monty&quot;. Stocksbridge Engineering Steels Brass Band has since been renamed to Unite the Union Band. Deepcar Brass Band remains locally.

Nearby Bolsterstone is home to a well-known male voice choir led by male vocalist Alan Rodgers, particularly noted for its performances of Sheffield local carols.

Stocksbridge has a strong amateur theatre group called Steel Valley Beacon which produces Shakespeare and other plays every year.

Mathcore band Rolo Tomassi were formed and are still based in Stocksbridge. Some of the Arctic Monkeys, and the vocalist of Bring Me the Horizon, are from Stocksbridge and attended Stocksbridge School.

== Media == 
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor and the local relay TV transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Sheffield on 104.1 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire on 102.0 FM, Heart Yorkshire on 107.7 FM, Capital Yorkshire on 105.1 FM, Hits Radio South Yorkshire on 102.9 FM and Penistone FM on 95.7 FM. 

The town is served by the local newspaper &quot;Look Local Newspaper&quot;.

==Sport==
The town&#x27;s local football club, Stocksbridge Park Steels, was founded in 1986 following the merger of Stocksbridge Works and Oxley Park FC. Their home ground is Bracken Moor, located at the eastern end of the town. The club plays in the Northern Premier League Division One East and also organises many youth teams, for ages 8 to 18.

Stocksbridge Church was the first to represent the town in the FA Cup, in 1910.

<doc id="343143" wikidata="Q1421879" url="?curid=343143" title="Lincoln (album)">
<text>Lincoln is the second studio album by the band They Might Be Giants. It was released by Bar/None in 1988. The album is named after John Linnell and John Flansburgh&#x27;s boyhood home of Lincoln, Massachusetts. The album produced three singles—&quot;Ana Ng&quot;, &quot;They&#x27;ll Need a Crane&quot;, and &quot;Purple Toupee&quot;. It is included on &quot;&quot;, a compilation of the band&#x27;s early material, in its entirety.

== Style ==
&quot;Lincoln&quot; maintains the range of musical styles present on the previous album, &quot;They Might Be Giants&quot;, and lyrically attempts to merge word play into narrative songs. Lyrical themes are broadened with the inclusion of songs detailing troubled romantic relationships (&quot;Ana Ng&quot;, &quot;They&#x27;ll Need a Crane&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Match&quot;), and songs that verge on social or political satire (&quot;Purple Toupee&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me, Son of God&quot;), whereas musically, the album explores a number of genres. For example, songs such as &quot;Cowtown&quot; and &quot;Mr. Me&quot; incorporate elements of sea shanties, while &quot;Lie Still, Little Bottle&quot; suggests a jazz influence.

Like previous releases, &quot;Lincoln&quot; does not utilize a full band arrangement. Instead, bass and drum tracks are entirely synthetic or sampled, with the exception of live drums on &quot;Lie Still, Little Bottle&quot;. The drum tracks on the album were produced with an Alesis HR-16 drum machine. The album featured The Ordinaires, a nonet which was also signed to the Bar/None label, providing the arrangement for &quot;Kiss Me, Son of God&quot;.

==Release==
As of 1999, the album had sold more than 200,000 copies, double the amount of the previous album.

== Packaging ==
The cover art depicts a shrine built by Brian Dewan and photographed by Carol Kitman. Two slightly different versions of the cover photograph exist: one that was used for domestic releases, and another that was used for all releases outside the United States with the exception of the Australian releases and Italian CD. The two men pictured behind the lecterns in the shrine are John Linnell&#x27;s great-grandfather, Lewis T. Linnell (left), and Flansburgh&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Brigadier General Ralph Hospital (right).

The artwork for the album was designed by John Flansburgh. The CD and LP labels feature diagrams of an accordion and accordion case, which were drawn by John Linnell.

== Reception ==
&quot;Lincoln&quot; received generally positive reviews. David Kissinger of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;every bit as eccentric as its predecessor, and even more eclectic&quot;, though this was supplemented with the disclaimer that &quot;[a]t times this penchant for the bizarre leads them into pointlessly sophomoric zaniness&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; described the band as &quot;actively annoying even if intelligence is all you ask of your art-pop&quot; and called the album&#x27;s hooks &quot;cleverness for cleverness&#x27;s sake&quot;, nonetheless conceding that &quot;damned clever they are.&quot; The album placed at number 78 on &quot;Pitchfork&quot; &quot;100 Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;.

The album peaked at number 89 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums chart in 1989, spending 19 weeks on that chart. Its success led to They Might Be Giants&#x27; signing to the major label Elektra Records in 1990. &quot;Lincoln&quot; also generated the band&#x27;s first charting single, &quot;Ana Ng&quot;, which peaked at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. The single, which was only released promotionally in the United States, also received positive attention. Christgau praised it as &quot;a beyond-perfect tour de force about a Vietnamese woman they never got to meet&quot;. The other singles from the album, &quot;They&#x27;ll Need a Crane&quot; and &quot;Purple Toupee&quot;, failed to chart, though both songs and the track &quot;Kiss Me, Son of God&quot; received praise from Stewart Mason of Allmusic.

<text>Bradfield is a civil parish in the City of Sheffield, in South Yorkshire, England.

The civil parish is extensive, the western half is situated in the moorlands of the Peak District, the eastern half is in lower agricultural land and contains the parish&#x27;s significant habitations, which include the Sheffield suburb of Stannington, as well as Oughtibridge and Worrall, and the villages of High Bradfield and Low Bradfield. The parish also includes several reservoirs, and a number of minor settlements, such as Ewden. Bradfield is located from Sheffield city centre and from Barnsley.

On 6 July 2014, Stage 2 of the 2014 Tour de France from York to Sheffield, passed through the village. It was also the location of the seventh climb of the stage, the Category 4 Côte de Bradfield. It was long at an average gradient of 7.4%. The one point in the King of the Mountains competition was claimed by Andriy Hrivko of Astana Pro Team.

==Description==

Bradfield is one of the largest parishes in England, and covers extensive moor and agricultural land around the Damflask Reservoir, Dale Dike Reservoir (the source of the Great Sheffield Flood of 1864), Strines Reservoir, and Agden Reservoirs, including the Bradfield, Midhope, and Broomhead moors and eastern parts of the Howden moors. The western end of the parish reaches to the upper parts of the Upper Derwent Valley with part of its boundary forming Yorkshire’s border with Derbyshire. The northern part of the parish includes the Langsett Reservoir and Midhope Reservoir, and borders the town and civil parish of Stocksbridge.

The eastern edge reaches the western extent of the urban spread of Sheffield, and includes the suburb of Stannington, as well as the villages of Oughtibridge, Wharncliffe Side, and Worrall. Minor habitations within the parish include Midhopestones, Upper Midhope and Bolsterstone on the northern edge, and Dungworth in the southeastern part. The moorland villages of High Bradfield and Low Bradfield are located within the parish. High Bradfield possesses a Gothic revival church, and the earthworks of a motte and bailey castle. Low Bradfield is less historic, having been largely destroyed in the Great Sheffield flood of 1864.

At the time of the 2001 census the parish had a population of 14,915, increasing to 17,100 at the 2011 Census. The parish extends across the City of Sheffield electoral wards of Stocksbridge and Upper Don and Stannington Ward, and covers more than a third of the land area of Sheffield City Council.

<text>High Bradfield is a rural village north-west of the centre of Sheffield in South Yorkshire, England and within the city&#x27;s boundaries. The village lies just within the Peak District National Park, inside the park&#x27;s north-eastern border, is at an altitude of 260 metres (850 feet) AOD, and has extensive views across Bradfield Dale towards Derwent Edge and the Dark Peak.

The most striking feature of the village is the medieval Church of St. Nicholas, Bradfield. It is one of only five Grade I Listed buildings in Sheffield.

The name Bradfield failed to shift during the Great Vowel Shift from Old English to Broadfield, a name with a double emphasis on its broad stretch of open countryside. and the area around the village is predominantly grazing land with dairy and sheep farming dominating. High Bradfield has a sister village, Low Bradfield, which lies less than to the south-west but is lower down in the upper Loxley valley. The two villages are linked by the steep Woodfall Lane.

High Bradfield is in the civil parish of Bradfield, the largest in England, and in the electoral area of Stannington.

==History==

High Bradfield, which was formerly known as &quot;kirkton&quot;, is not mentioned in the Domesday Book, but it may have been one of the 16 hamlets recorded in the manor of Hallam. On the north-west edge of the village, close to the church, is Bailey Hill, an approximately high man-made conical mound that is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The date and purpose of its construction are unknown, though it has been interpreted as a Saxon fort, a Norman motte-and-bailey castle, or a place of public village assembly. The late David Hey said there was no doubt that Bailey Hill is a motte-and-bailey castle calling it &quot;One of the best preserved and most dramatic motte-and-baileys in Yorkshire.&quot; Excavations from 1720 revealed squared stones that had been produced by using tools. The eastern and southern flanks of the bailey are enclosed by a 95 metre long curving earthwork while to the west it is protected by steep slopes. About to the southeast of the village is Castle Hill, a site marked on old maps as a “supposed Saxon encampment” The site occupies a rocky ridge at the head of a high escarpment partially enclosed by ring work. The date or purpose of construction of this site are also unknown although it has been speculated that it was used a look-out post.

The parish church, St Nicholas Church, is built in the Gothic Perpendicular style and dates from the 1480s. It incorporates elements of an earlier church that may have been built in the 12th century, and it may stand on the site of an Anglo-Saxon place of worship.

The Enclosure Act of the early 19th century altered the appearance of the countryside around High Bradfield as the profusion of stones in the soil resulted in many small fields in the area. Around the same time many people in the Bradfield area were influenced by the Industrial Revolution and moved to nearby Sheffield to improve their standard of living. The Bradfield Parish workhouse was based in High Bradfield between 1759 and 1847; the building is still there today, standing across the road from the Old Horns pub on Towngate. The building was converted into private houses in the 1870s. Thousands of documents relating to the workhouse were found in a hidden cupboard in one of the houses in the 1950s; these are now in the Bradfield Parish Archives. On Jane Street is the Grade II listed building known as the Old Post Office, built from gritstone with a slate roof in 1835. It was originally an inn called &quot;Heaven House&quot; or &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; and later &quot;The Cross Daggers&quot;. Later it served as a register office, vestry and school and latterly as a post office; it is now a private dwelling divided into several flats.

===Present day===
The present-day village is still dominated by farming. Church Farm is a large dairy farm which supplies a large amount of milk for the surrounding area. Watt House Farm is also a dairy farm but is unique in that it is the home of the Bradfield Brewery, which is based in a converted barn on the farm. It brews several beers including Farmers Blonde and Pale Ale as well as some seasonal specials. There is one public house in the village, the Old Horns Inn. The Monastery of The Holy Spirit, known locally as Kirk Edge Convent, stands 1.5 km to the east of the village, it is a monastery of the Carmelite order of nuns.

The Peak District Boundary Walk runs through the village.

<doc id="343146" wikidata="Q2706252" url="?curid=343146" title="The Soft Boys">
<text>The Soft Boys were an English rock band led by guitarist Robyn Hitchcock.

The band formed in 1976 in Cambridge, England and released two albums before disbanding in 1981. Though the Soft Boys’ initial career was brief, their style of psychedelic music and retro folk-rock had a big influence on the development of jangle pop, indie rock, and neo-psychedelia during the 1980s and beyond.

==Early band history==
The Soft Boys formed in 1976 in Cambridge, England, initially calling themselves Dennis and the Experts. Their first lineup comprised Hitchcock on guitar, Rob Lamb (half-brother of radio host and author Charlie Gillett) on guitar, Andy Metcalfe on bass, and Morris Windsor on drums. Alan Davies replaced Lamb after only four gigs in late 1976, and Kimberley Rew eventually replaced Davies. It was this lineup of Hitchcock, Rew, Metcalfe, and Windsor that recorded the Soft Boys&#x27; debut album, &quot;A Can of Bees,&quot; released 1979. 

Matthew Seligman replaced Metcalfe on bass in 1979. The band broke up in 1981 after the release of their second album, &quot;Underwater Moonlight&quot;. 

==Post-Soft Boys and reunions==
Rew formed the more mainstream pop group Katrina and the Waves. Hitchcock went on to a prolific career with a similar whimsical, surrealistic style. In 1984, he formed Robyn Hitchcock and the Egyptians with fellow Soft Boys Morris Windsor and Andy Metcalfe and went on to tour and record for ten years. They were briefly joined by Rew, Jim Melton and Seligman in a re-formed the Soft Boys for a UK tour in 1994 to mark the release of a box set of their work. They briefly came together again in 2001 without Metcalfe for the 20th anniversary of &quot;Underwater Moonlight&quot; and the release of a new album, 2002’s &quot;Nextdoorland&quot;. They disbanded once again in 2003.

Seligman died in 2020 of complications from COVID-19.

<doc id="343148" wikidata="Q14862299" url="?curid=343148" title="Low Bradfield">
<text>Low Bradfield is a village within the civil parish of Bradfield in South Yorkshire, England. It is situated within the boundary of the city of Sheffield in the upper part of the Loxley Valley, 6¼ miles west-northwest of the city centre and just inside the northeast boundary of the Peak District National Park. Low Bradfield and the surrounding area is noted for its attractive countryside which draws many visitors from the more urban parts of Sheffield. At weekends the village can become quite crowded, especially when there is a match on the village cricket pitch. Low Bradfield which stands in the shadow of Agden Reservoir has a sister village High Bradfield which is located at a higher altitude, ½ mile to the northeast. The two villages are joined by the steep Woodfall Lane.

==History==

===Early history===
The earliest historical sign of settlement in the Bradfield area is an early to mid Bronze Age ring cairn on Broomhead Moors, three miles to the northwest of Low Bradfield. This is believed to be a ritual or burial site from over 4,000 years ago. On the ridge between Bradfield Dale and the Ewden Valley is the Bar Dike, a 492 yards long trench with a rampart on its southern side which is 10 feet high in places. The dike is believed to have marked the boundary between different Dark Ages tribes in the period following the withdrawal of The Romans from Britain.

===Anglo-Saxon cross===
There is evidence of Anglo-Saxon settlement within the Low Bradfield area with the discovery in 1870 of an Anglo-Saxon cross in a field near the site of the former Cross Inn not far from the village centre. It has been examined by Sheffield University&#x27;s Phil Sidebottom who has compared it to similar crosses found in Staffordshire that were put up in the middle of the 10th century. He says the cross’s hammer head design confirms that it dates to just before the Norman conquest. The cross can now be seen in the nave of St. Nicholas&#x27; Church at High Bradfield.

===Norman development===
While Bradfied is not documented in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; it is inconceivable that it was not settled at that time and it is believed to be one of 16 unnamed Berewicks (an outlying part of a large manor) within Hallamshire that are mentioned. The hamlet of Low Bradfield grew up around the manorial corn mill which was established on the banks of the River Loxley in the shadow of the local church and castle at High Bradfield. The village developed as a farming community with much of the surrounding countryside set aside by the Norman lords as a deer hunting park. The Howard family showed little interest in hunting and the deer were finally removed from the park in the 16th century.

===Great Sheffield Flood===
Low Bradfield was the first populated place to be flooded by the Great Sheffield Flood when the Dale Dyke Dam broke on 11 March 1864. The original dam wall stood almost one mile west of the village. There was only one fatality in the village mainly because word had spread throughout the immediate area that there was a leak in the earth embankment and the community was partly prepared for the tragedy. The only death was a one-day-old infant, the child of a local couple (Mr. and Mrs. Dawson); despite this the village was extensively damaged. Two stone bridges were swept away, as was the corn mill, blacksmith’s shop, schoolroom, schoolmaster&#x27;s house and a farmhouse. Samuel Harrison described the flood damage at Low Bradfield thus: &quot;“The destruction at Lower Bradfield is so thorough that the rock is torn up from under the foundation of the buildings.”&quot;

==Present day==

Low Bradfield continues its tradition as a farming community into the present day. Cross Farm, Nether Farm and Fair House Farm are situated close to the centre of the village. Fair House is a grade II* listed building and is one of the oldest structures in the area dating from the 1630s and was originally called Swinden House. Nether Farm is Grade II listed and dates from the 1820s. There are several other farms in the outlying areas. One of the great attractions to people from outside the village is the large centrally located recreation ground known as the Ibbotson Memorial Field which is a popular site for picnics and family visits and also serves as the village cricket ground, drawing large crowds to games on summer weekends. The field was named after the Ibbotson family who have lived in Low Bradfield for several centuries. The local tennis and bowls clubs also have facilities at the field.

There are several other notable buildings in the village. The former Wesleyan chapel on Mill Lee Road was built in 1817 and now serves as the offices for Bradfield Parish Council. Just across the road is another former Wesleyan chapel which was built in 1899 to replace its counterpart. It closed in 1993 and was sold for residential use. Also on Mill Lee Road are the former water board filter houses which filtered water from the Agden, Dale Dike and Strines reservoirs in Bradfield Dale. The filter houses were built in 1913 and extended in 1953 before being closed in 1995 when a new water treatment works was opened in the Loxley Valley. The buildings are currently being converted for residential use with an expected completion date of winter 2024. The Bradfield village hall, situated on the Memorial Field was completely rebuilt recently and re-opened in 2006.

There is just one public house in the village, the Plough. There was a second pub called the Cross Inn which was situated at the foot of Woodfall Lane but this closed in the late 1970s and is now a private house. Just across the road is the village shop which is also the local post office. The former Low Bradfield School is now a private residence which was built in 1867 to replace a school that was washed away in the flood of 1864 in a different part of the village. The school closed in 1985 with its pupils being transferred to nearby Dungworth School.

The Peak District Boundary Walk runs through the village.

===Bradfield Dale===

The area to the west of the village is a rural area known as Bradfield Dale and contains the three reservoirs of Agden, Dale Dike and Strines which were constructed in the 1860s. The many construction workers who came into the dale prompted the Haychatter Farm to open a public house on its premises known as the Reservoir Inn and then the Haychatter which remained open until 2003. The dale contains Sugworth Hall which dates from a least the 16th century although the building has been much changed since then. Eminent families who have lived there include the Hooles and the Boots. Charles Boot built a folly tower overlooking Strines Reservoir in 1927 known as Boot&#x27;s Folly, it is a prominent landmark for miles around. Another ancient residence in the dale is Hallfield House which dates from the Elizabethan era and was the seat of the Greaveses, a very old Hallamshire family. The dale also includes the Strines Inn public house.

<doc id="343156" wikidata="Q2482753" url="?curid=343156" title="Schnirelmann density">
<text>In additive number theory, the Schnirelmann density of a sequence of numbers is a way to measure how &quot;dense&quot; the sequence is. It is named after Russian mathematician Lev Schnirelmann, who was the first to study it.

==Definition==
The Schnirelmann density of a set of natural numbers &quot;A&quot; is defined as
:formula_1
where &quot;A&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) denotes the number of elements of &quot;A&quot; not exceeding &quot;n&quot; and inf is infimum.

The Schnirelmann density is well-defined even if the limit of &quot;A&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)/&quot;n&quot; as fails to exist (see upper and lower asymptotic density).

==Properties==
By definition, and for all &quot;n&quot;, and therefore , and if and only if . Furthermore,
: formula_2

===Sensitivity===
The Schnirelmann density is sensitive to the first values of a set:
: formula_3.
In particular,
:formula_4
and
:formula_5
Consequently, the Schnirelmann densities of the even numbers and the odd numbers, which one might expect to agree, are 0 and 1/2 respectively. Schnirelmann and Yuri Linnik exploited this sensitivity.

==Schnirelmann&#x27;s theorems==
If we set formula_6, then Lagrange&#x27;s four-square theorem can be restated as formula_7. (Here the symbol formula_8 denotes the sumset of formula_9 and formula_10.) It is clear that formula_11. In fact, we still have formula_12, and one might ask at what point the sumset attains Schnirelmann density 1 and how does it increase. It actually is the case that formula_13 and one sees that sumsetting formula_14 once again yields a more populous set, namely all of formula_15. Schnirelmann further succeeded in developing these ideas into the following theorems, aiming towards Additive Number Theory, and proving them to be a novel resource (if not greatly powerful) to attack important problems, such as Waring&#x27;s problem and Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture.
Theorem. Let formula_16 and formula_17 be subsets of formula_15. Then
formula_19

Note that formula_20. Inductively, we have the following generalization.
Corollary. Let formula_21 be a finite family of subsets of formula_15. Then
formula_23

The theorem provides the first insights on how sumsets accumulate. It seems unfortunate that its conclusion stops short of showing formula_24 being superadditive. Yet, Schnirelmann provided us with the following results, which sufficed for most of his purpose.
Theorem. Let formula_16 and formula_17 be subsets of formula_15. If formula_28, then
formula_29


Theorem. (&quot;Schnirelmann&quot;) Let formula_30. If formula_31 then there exists formula_32 such that
formula_33

==Additive bases==
A subset formula_30 with the property that formula_35 for a finite sum, is called an additive basis, and the least number of summands required is called the &quot;degree&quot; (sometimes &quot;order&quot;) of the basis. Thus, the last theorem states that any set with positive Schnirelmann density is an additive basis. In this terminology, the set of squares formula_6 is an additive basis of degree 4. (About an open problem for additive bases, see Erdős–Turán conjecture on additive bases.)

==Mann&#x27;s theorem==
Historically the theorems above were pointers to the following result, at one time known as the formula_37 hypothesis. It was used by Edmund Landau and was finally proved by Henry Mann in 1942.
Theorem. Let formula_16 and formula_17 be subsets of formula_15. In case that formula_41, we still have
formula_42

An analogue of this theorem for lower asymptotic density was obtained by Kneser. At a later date, E. Artin and P. Scherk simplified the proof of Mann&#x27;s theorem.

==Waring&#x27;s problem==
Let formula_43 and formula_44 be natural numbers. Let formula_45. Define formula_46 to be the number of non-negative integral solutions to the equation

:formula_47

and formula_48 to be the number of non-negative integral solutions to the inequality

:formula_49

in the variables formula_50, respectively. Thus formula_51. We have

*formula_52
*formula_53

The volume of the formula_54-dimensional body defined by formula_55, is bounded by the volume of the hypercube of size formula_56, hence formula_57. The hard part is to show that this bound still works on the average, i.e.,
Lemma. (&quot;Linnik&quot;) For all formula_58 there exists formula_59 and a constant formula_60, depending only on formula_32, such that for all formula_62,
formula_63
for all formula_64

With this at hand, the following theorem can be elegantly proved.
Theorem. For all formula_32 there exists formula_54 for which formula_67.
We have thus established the general solution to Waring&#x27;s Problem:
Corollary. For all formula_32 there exists formula_54, depending only on formula_32, such that every positive integer formula_71 can be expressed as the sum of at most formula_54 many formula_32-th powers.
==Schnirelmann&#x27;s constant==
In 1930 Schnirelmann used these ideas in conjunction with the Brun sieve to prove Schnirelmann&#x27;s theorem, that any natural number greater than 1 can be written as the sum of not more than &quot;C&quot; prime numbers, where &quot;C&quot; is an effectively computable constant: Schnirelmann obtained &quot;C&quot; &lt; 800000. Schnirelmann&#x27;s constant is the lowest number &quot;C&quot; with this property.

Olivier Ramaré showed in that Schnirelmann&#x27;s constant is at most 7, improving the earlier upper bound of 19 obtained by Hans Riesel and R. C. Vaughan.

Schnirelmann&#x27;s constant is at least 3; Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture implies that this is the constant&#x27;s actual value.

In 2013, Harald Helfgott proved Goldbach&#x27;s weak conjecture for all odd numbers. Therefore, Schnirelmann&#x27;s constant is at most 4.

==Essential components==
Khintchin proved that the sequence of squares, though of zero Schnirelmann density, when added to a sequence of Schnirelmann density between 0 and 1, increases the density:

: formula_74

This was soon simplified and extended by Erdős, who showed, that if &quot;A&quot; is any sequence with Schnirelmann density α and &quot;B&quot; is an additive basis of order &quot;k&quot; then

: formula_75

and this was improved by Plünnecke to

:formula_76

Sequences with this property, of increasing density less than one by addition, were named essential components by Khintchin. Linnik showed that an essential component need not be an additive basis as he constructed an essential component that has &quot;x&quot;o(1) elements less than &quot;x&quot;. More precisely, the sequence has

: formula_77

elements less than &quot;x&quot; for some &quot;c&quot; &lt; 1. This was improved by E. Wirsing to

: formula_78

For a while, it remained an open problem how many elements an essential component must have. Finally, Ruzsa determined that for every &quot;ε&quot; &gt; 0 there is an essential component which has at most &quot;c&quot;(log &quot;x&quot;)1+&quot;ε&quot; elements up to &quot;x&quot;, but there is no essential component which has &quot;c&quot;(log &quot;x&quot;)1+&quot;o&quot;(1) elements up to &quot;x&quot;.

<doc id="343157" wikidata="Q1421317" url="?curid=343157" title="Sheffield Cathedral">
<text>The Cathedral Church of St Peter and St Paul, Sheffield, also known as Sheffield Cathedral, is the cathedral church for the Church of England diocese of Sheffield, England. Originally a parish church, it was elevated to cathedral status when the diocese was created in 1914. Sheffield Cathedral is one of five Grade I listed buildings in the city, along with the Town Hall, Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet, and the parish churches at Ecclesfield and Bradfield.

The cathedral is located on Church Street in the city centre, close to the head of Fargate. Construction of the earliest section of the cathedral dates back to 1200, with the newest construction completed in 1966; the building is an unusual mixture of medieval and modern architecture. Cathedral tram stop, located outside the front churchyard, opened in 1994 and is today served by all four lines of the Sheffield Supertram network. Most recently, the cathedral underwent an interior and exterior refurbishment in 2013–2014.

Sheffield Cathedral was damaged in a fire on 14 May 2020, an investigation into which is ongoing; a 40-year-old woman has been arrested and charged with arson. The fire destroyed a portion of the cathedral used by a homelessness charity. A previous fire caused damage to the cathedral belltower in 1979.

==History==
The site of the cathedral has a long history of Christian use. The shaft of the 9th-century Sheffield Cross, believed to have formerly been sited here, is now held by the British Museum. It is probable that Sheffield&#x27;s parish church, a satellite of Worksop Priory, was constructed here in the 12th century by William de Lovetot at the opposite end of the town to Sheffield Castle. This established the area of the parish of Sheffield, unchanged until the 19th century. This church was burnt down in 1266 during the Second Barons&#x27; War against King Henry III.

Another parish church was completed in 1280, but this church was mostly demolished and rebuilt about 1430 on a cruciform floor plan. The Shrewsbury Chapel was added in the next century, and a vestry chapel (now the Chapel of Saint Katherine) was added in 1777. The north and south walls of the nave were rebuilt in 1790–93 and a major restoration by Flockton &amp; Gibbs, which included the addition of new north and south transepts, was completed in 1880. The church was originally dedicated to Saint Peter, but from some time after the reformation into the 19th century it was dedicated to Holy Trinity; it has since been dedicated to both Saint Peter and Saint Paul.

The parish of Sheffield was subdivided into smaller parishes in 1848. The church is still the parish church for the smaller Parish of Sheffield, but in 1914 it was also made the cathedral church for the newly created Diocese of Sheffield. Plans were drafted by Charles Nicholson to extend the church and reorient it on its axis, but due to World War II these were greatly scaled down. The resulting additions leave the church an awkward shape in plan, but with an impressive south elevation.

=== 1979 fire ===
During the early hours of 17 July 1979, a major fire broke out in the belltower of Sheffield Cathedral. The fire began inside the belfry, and subsequently spread down the tower to the ground floor and upwards to the clockroom. At least 35 firefighters from Division Street fire station tackled the fire, narrowly preventing the destruction of the cathedral spire and containing the lower portion of the fire to the belltower and surrounding structures. Thousands of pounds worth of damage was caused by the fire, which destroyed several of the cathedral&#x27;s bells (including one dating to the 16th century) and much of the clock mechanism. Additionally, burst water pipes caused flooding of the choir stalls, adding to the damage. In the Ringing Room, fire damage was severe, with all records of the cathedral&#x27;s bellringers dating back 600 years completely destroyed.

Despite severe damage to the contents of the belltower, the structure of the cathedral ultimately suffered only mild damage and the building was never in danger of collapse. The cathedral was back operational by 26 July 1979 at the latest, according to photographs showing the ringing of the remaining bells on this date. Following police investigation of two phone calls made to the &quot;Sheffield Star&quot; newspaper the previous evening, warning that the cathedral was being set on fire, the cause of the fire was determined to be arson, although no perpetrator was ever found.

=== 2015 Royal Maundy ===
On Thursday 2 April 2015, the Royal Maundy service was held inside Sheffield Cathedral. As is tradition, The Queen (aged 89 at the time) distributed specially-minted Maundy money to 89 men and 89 women from the Sheffield area of state pension age or above. Recipients were handed two leather pouches, containing Maundy money equivalent in value to 89 pence. It was the first time the Royal Maundy service had ever been carried out in South Yorkshire. More than 12,000 people travelled to Sheffield to witness the service.

=== 2020 fire ===
A fire broke out at Sheffield Cathedral during the evening of 14 May 2020; emergency services were called to the cathedral around 18:00 BST after smoke was spotted coming from the side of the cathedral facing Campo Lane. The fire was attended by South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue crews from Sheffield Central fire station on Eyre Street, and extinguished by around 21:40 the same evening. The cathedral was empty at the time, and there were no injuries. A joint investigation between the police and fire service was undertaken, with the cause of the fire believed to be arson after a smashed window was found at the rear of the cathedral.

The fire caused damage to the interior of the cathedral. Smoke damage affected the entire structure, including the many stained glass windows. The fire is believed to have been started deliberately in a pile of clothes that had been donated to the Cathedral Archer Project, a homelessness charity which occupies part of the cathedral site. The fire destroyed the entire contents of the rooms used by the charity, but was prevented from spreading to other parts of the cathedral.

South Yorkshire Police arrested a 40-year-old woman in connection with the cathedral fire, charging her with arson with reckless endangerment, burglary and assault of an emergency worker. The woman was accused of spitting at two police officers as they arrested her, which was treated with added severity in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.

The Cathedral Archer Project charity temporarily reduced operations in the aftermath of the fire, as much of their donated stock had been destroyed; increased donations from the public after the fire later allowed them to continue working from a temporary base. Prior to the fire, the charity had been distributing around 180 free meals to homeless people in Sheffield city centre every day, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Art and architecture==

The east end of the current church is the oldest. In the east wall of the sanctuary there are stones from the 13th-century church. Dating from the 15th century are the sanctuary and chancel. The 15th-century cruciform church also included lofts and a rood chapel but these were ordered to be removed by Elizabeth I. Their scars can be seen on the walls.

The chancel roof likely dates to the 16th century and is a hammerbeam roof with gilded angels. The outstretched wings are a modern gift from the 1960s by George Bailey.

In the 1770s, rebuilding included the addition of tracery into the windows and a resurfacing of the walls with moorstone. The addition of the vestry chapel of St Katherine destroyed the cruciform shape of the plan. The Shrewsbury Chapel was constructed in order to house the Tudor monuments of the Earls of Shrewsbury. The altarpiece in the chapel is considered medieval in date. On the south wall of the Shrewsbury Chapel is the alabaster monument to George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury with its architectural surround, armoured effigy and Latin inscription. Several members of the family are buried in the vault. The monument on the left towards the sanctuary is to George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury. It is made of fine marble, carved in an Italian style to depict the Earl and his two wives in positions of prayer. They are both fine examples of Tudor monuments. The east window is a monument to James Montgomery.

In the 1880s further reconstruction and rebuilding removed the galleries, moved the organ to the north transept to clear the chancel, and installed new oak pews. The north and south transepts and west end were extended. A screen was constructed by local craftsmen for the Shrewsbury Chapel but was modified and moved to the north aisle in the 1900s. During later restoration work in 2013, it was discovered that a number of the Shrewsbury coffins were missing from the crypt.

Sir Charles Nicholson&#x27;s design in the 1900s called for a radical realignment of the church axis by 90 degrees. However, funds and World Wars forced the designs to change. Those changes were implemented throughout the 20th century. The bulk of the changes have affected the northern part of the cathedral, which was extensively expanded. Immediately to the north of the nave is the chapel of Saint George, which commemorates the York and Lancaster Regiment. It is furnished with regiment flags and a screen made up of the bayonets and swords of the first regiment. Under the chapel of St George is the vaulted crypt chapel of All Saints and the Te Deum window, which was designed by Christopher Webb. At the furthest north end is the Chapel of the Holy Spirit with a four-part vaulting system and a painted screen. The main entrance of the church is at the expanded west end, added in 1966 when the church was rededicated. The baptism font is at this end. The lantern tower was an earlier addition to improve light but its glass was replaced by an abstract design designed by Amber Hiscott in 1998–99. In September 2010 it was announced that the cathedral would be applying for a £980,000 Heritage Lottery Fund grant to fund a £1.25 million scheme to make the building more attractive to visitors.

==Dean and chapter==
As of 1 December 2021:
*Dean — Abi Thompson (since 6 November 2021 installation)
*Vice-Dean &amp; Canon Missioner — Keith Farrow (Canon &amp; Missioner since March 2014; Vice-Dean since 1 December 2019)
*Canon Residentiary &amp; interim Canon Precentor — Geoffrey Harbord (canon since 21 October 2020 installation; interim Precentor since 9 October 2021)
*Minor Canon Precentor — Daniel Wyman (to be installed in October 2024)

==Music==
===Choir===
On 22 July 2020, the Sheffield Cathedral chapter announced the closure of the cathedral choir. The choir contained around 40 members and was composed of adult lay clerks and choral scholars and girl and boy choristers from various local schools. The chapter stated the closure was &quot;in order to create a Music Department and Choir ready for the exciting future of the mixed urban community in which we live and work&quot;, and that the chapter is &quot;committed to retaining the distinctive choral life of an Anglican cathedral, drawing fully on our long heritage of music-making&quot;. The closure was received negatively by the national media.

===Organ===
The pipe organ by N. P. Mander Ltd was decommissioned in 1998 with a view to a long-term replacement with another pipe organ. This had not occurred by 2020, when a digital organ by Phoenix Organs was being used. In 2008 negotiations were undertaken with Warrington Borough Council to purchase their Cavaillé-Coll organ from the Parr Hall, but these failed in 2011.

===Organists===
==Change ringing==
As of 2017, the cathedral has 12 bells hung for change ringing, including a flat sixth bell and an Extra Treble. The bells are rung regularly for practice on Thursday and for Sunday services, in the morning and the evening. Also hanging in the cathedral is the stainless steel ship&#x27;s bell from .

== Cathedral Archer Project ==
The Cathedral Archer Project is a homelessness charity which operates from rooms around the rear of the cathedral, with a separate entrance from Campo Lane. The charity was founded in 1989, following a decade of economic decline and rising homelessness in Sheffield following the collapse of the local steelworks and coal-mining industries. In 2007, the charity moved into the refurbished rooms to the rear of the cathedral that they occupy today; the rooms include shower and laundry facilities, computer access, lounge areas and a full kitchen for the use of Sheffield&#x27;s homeless.

In 2013, the charity received Investing in Volunteers status. The Archer Project was the official charity of the Sheffield Eagles rugby league side for the 2018 season. The charity has also worked closely with schools, including a formal fundraising partnership with Dronfield Henry Fanshawe School&#x27;s sixth form college.

The rooms used by the Archer Project at Sheffield Cathedral were destroyed by fire in an arson attack on 14 May 2020. The charity had previously been distributing 180 free meals per day to the city&#x27;s homeless amid the COVID-19 pandemic. More than £22,000 was raised for the charity within 24 hours of the fire, including a £1,000 donation from Sheffield Wednesday football club.

==Access==
Sheffield Cathedral has its own stop on the South Yorkshire Supertram network called Cathedral. Located in front of the cathedral at the edge of the churchyard, it is one of three city centre tram stops served by all four lines, and as such can be accessed from any other stop on the network. The tram stop was opened on 17 February 1995. Tram-train services between Cathedral and Rotherham Parkgate commenced on 25 October 2018.

 


Beyond the tram platforms is Church Street, which since the construction of the tram network now runs westbound only from High Street to West Street. There are two bus stops on Church Street, serving local bus services 7a, 30/30a, 51 and 52/52a as of May 2020. There is no on-street parking on the streets directly surrounding the cathedral; the nearest car park is located on Campo Lane a short walk away, operated by National Car Parks.

<doc id="343158" wikidata="Q156300" url="?curid=343158" title="Michael Kamen">
<text>Michael Arnold Kamen (April 15, 1948 – November 18, 2003) was an American composer (especially of film scores), orchestral arranger, orchestral conductor, songwriter, record producer and musician.

==Early life==
Michael Arnold Kamen was born in New York City, the second of four sons. His father, Saul Kamen, was a dentist, and his mother, Helen, was a teacher. He was of Jewish heritage.

While attending the High School of Music &amp; Art in New York City, Kamen became friends with Martin Fulterman (later known as Mark Snow), who would compose the theme music for &quot;The X-Files&quot;, among other projects. While studying the oboe, Kamen formed a rock-classical fusion band called New York Rock &amp; Roll Ensemble, together with classmates Fulterman and Dorian Rudnytsky, along with Clifton Nivison and Brian Corrigan of Toms River, New Jersey. The group released five albums from 1968 to 1972 (&quot;Self-Titled&quot;, &quot;Reflections&quot;, &quot;Faithful Friends&quot;, &quot;Roll Over&quot; &amp; &quot;Freedomburger&quot;). The group performed in white tie (not tuxedos), as typically worn by classical musicians. In the middle of the concert, Fulterman and Kamen would play an oboe duet. The group backed up friend and classmate Janis Ian in a concert at Alice Tully Hall in late 1967.

After graduating from high school, Kamen attended The Juilliard School, in Manhattan, New York City.

Kamen&#x27;s early work concentrated on ballets before extending to Hollywood with the score for &quot;The Next Man&quot; in 1976, and then to pop and rock arranging, collaborating with Pink Floyd on their album &quot;The Wall&quot;.

==Career==
===Popular music===
Kamen became a highly sought-after arranger in the realms of pop and rock music. His contemporaries in this field included Academy Award winner Anne Dudley, Richard Niles, and Nick Ingman.

His successes include his work with Pink Floyd, David Gilmour and Roger Waters (he is one of the few people invited to work with both former Pink Floyd members, even after their acrimonious split), as well as Queen (orchestration on &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot;), Eric Clapton (on &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;), Roger Daltrey, Aerosmith (live orchestral version of &quot;Dream On&quot; for MTV), Kiss, Tom Petty, Bon Jovi, David Bowie, Bryan Ferry, Eurythmics, Queensrÿche, Rush, Metallica (on the song &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; and their live album, &quot;S&amp;M&quot;), Def Leppard, Herbie Hancock, Tim Curry, The Cranberries, Bryan Adams, Jim Croce, Coldplay, Sting, Guns N&#x27; Roses (on their performance of &quot;November Rain&quot; on the MTV Video Music Awards) and Kate Bush. For Bush, Kamen delivered an orchestral backing for &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot; from &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; album, substantially building upon a simple piano theme Bush had composed. In this instance and many others, he conducted the orchestra personally for the recording. In 1984, two years after moving to London, Kamen had similarly heightened the effect of a pop recording for the Eurythmics &quot;Here Comes the Rain Again&quot;, that score relying as much on his compositional skills as his arranging talents.

In 1990, Kamen joined many other guests for Roger Waters&#x27; performance of &quot;The Wall&quot; in Berlin, and led the National Philharmonic Orchestra during the &quot;24 Nights&quot; sessions with Eric Clapton the following year.

Lenny Kravitz recorded a cover of &quot;Fields of Joy&quot;, a song co-written by Kamen and Hal Fredricks, on his 1991 CD &quot;Mama Said&quot;.

In 2002, Kamen took part in the Concert for George as strings conductor.

Kamen had a successful partnership with Bryan Adams and &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange composing scores and songs. The ballad &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot; for the 1991 film &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; was the number one song that year worldwide. Other songs were &quot;All for Love&quot; for the film &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; in 1993, &quot;Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?&quot; for the film &quot;Don Juan DeMarco&quot; in 1994, and &quot;Star&quot; for the film &quot;Jack&quot; in 1996.

===Film and television===
Kamen wrote eleven ballets, a saxophone concerto and an electric guitar concerto (with Japanese guitarist Tomoyasu Hotei as a soloist, though originally performed by Eric Clapton). Additionally, he wrote a commissioned work, &quot;Quintet&quot;, for the Canadian Brass. He also provided scores for the films &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; (1996), &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;, &quot;For Queen and Country&quot;, &quot;Polyester&quot;, &quot;Brazil&quot;, &quot;Someone To Watch Over Me&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot;, &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, &quot;Highlander&quot;, &quot;X-Men&quot;, &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;, &quot;Licence to Kill,&quot; the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; series, the first three films of the &quot;Die Hard&quot; series, &quot;Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus&quot;, &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, &quot;Splitting Heirs&quot;, &quot;Frequency&quot; and many others. He also scored both the &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; and &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; series on HBO. Trailers for the 2007 release &quot;Bee Movie&quot;, the 2008 release &quot;Nim&#x27;s Island&quot;, the 2008 release &quot;WALL-E&quot;, and the 2014 release &quot;Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman&quot; featured Kamen&#x27;s &quot;Central Services / The Office&quot; from his score to &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985).

In television, Kamen composed music for two series of &quot;The Manageress&quot; produced by Glenn Wilhide, at Zed Productions for Channel 4, and Joan Bakewell&#x27;s interview series &quot;Memento&quot; in 1993, also at Zed Productions for Channel 4 directed by Robin Bextor, but perhaps his best known work was on the 1985 BBC Television serial &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;, on which he collaborated with Eric Clapton to write the score. The pair were awarded with a British Academy Television Award for Best Original Television Music for their work and performed the main movie theme with the National Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall of London in 1990 and 1991. In 1994, Kamen conducted an orchestration of the Who&#x27;s music for Roger Daltrey&#x27;s 50th birthday concert series entitled A Celebration: The Music of Pete Townshend and The Who which was subsequently released on CD and DVD. In the same year he was initially hired to do the soundtrack for the 1994 movie Speed, however Jan de Bont, the director of the movie, rejected him because he wanted Mark Mancina, who at the time worked on some Hans Zimmer scores like Days of Thunder, Where Sleeping Dogs Lie and True Romance.

Kamen was nominated for two Academy Awards and won three Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, two Ivor Novello Awards, an Annie Award, and an Emmy.

===Later years===
His involvement with &quot;Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus&quot;, a film about a frustrated composer who finds fulfillment as a high school music teacher, led Kamen to create The Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus Foundation in 1996. The foundation supports music education through the donation of new and refurbished musical instruments to underserved school and community music programs and individual students in the United States. In 2005 the foundation created an emergency fund for schools, and students affected by Hurricane Katrina.

In 1998, Kamen composed and conducted the soundtrack for &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot;. Produced by James Seymour Brett, the score was initially set to be composed by Ennio Morricone. The Italian composer had initially completed and recorded a full score for the film but, after editorial changes were made, his score was rejected and Kamen was hired in his place. Short on time, Kamen took the song &quot;Beside You&quot; from his New York Rock Ensemble&#x27;s album &quot;Roll Over&quot; and adapted it as the movie&#x27;s main musical theme.

Between April 21 and 22, 1999, Kamen worked with the heavy metal band Metallica, along with The San Francisco Symphony, to record a two-day concert that was held at The Berkeley Community Theatre in Berkeley, California. The concert performance, titled &quot;S&amp;M&quot; by Metallica, which is an acronym for &quot;Symphony and Metallica&quot;, referencing the collaboration of the two artists, was released on November 23, 1999, on CD, DVD, and VHS formats, debuting at #2 on the Billboard 200, subsequently reaching multi-platinum status by 2001. Later that year, Kamen and Metallica won a Grammy Award For Best Rock Instrumental Performance for the &quot;S&amp;M&quot; track titled &quot;The Call Of Ktulu&quot;.

In 2001 and 2002, Kamen performed with David Gilmour at Gilmour&#x27;s semi-unplugged shows at the Royal Festival Hall, playing piano and cor anglais. The 2001 concert and highlights from 2002 were released on DVD as &quot;David Gilmour in Concert&quot;.

In 2002, Kamen, along with Julian Lloyd Webber, Dame Evelyn Glennie, and Sir James Galway launched the Music Education Consortium in the UK. The consortium&#x27;s efforts led to the injection of £332 million for music education in the UK. He was also commissioned to write a piece for the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.

His last recorded work appeared on Bryan Adams&#x27;s album &quot;Room Service&quot; where he played the oboe and wrote the orchestration to &quot;I Was Only Dreamin&#x27;&quot;. Kamen had also completed the charts for accompaniment to two songs on Kate Bush&#x27;s album &quot;Aerial&quot;, which was released in April 2005.

==Health and death==
Kamen was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1997. He died in London, England, from a heart attack on November 18, 2003, at age 55.

==Legacy==

In 2004, when Annie Lennox accepted the Academy Award for Best Original Song (for &quot;Into the West&quot; from &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;), she dedicated her achievement to the memory of Kamen.

The 2004 films &quot;Boo, Zino &amp; the Snurks&quot; (also known as &quot;Back to Gaya&quot;) and &quot;First Daughter&quot;, which Kamen was working on at the time of his death, were dedicated to his memory.

David Gilmour&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;On an Island&quot; was dedicated to the memory of Kamen and longtime Pink Floyd manager Steve O&#x27;Rourke.

<text>In espionage jargon, a mole (also called a &quot;penetration agent&quot;, &quot;deep cover agent&quot;, &quot;illegal&quot; or &quot;sleeper agent&quot;) is a long-term spy (espionage agent) who is recruited before having access to secret intelligence, subsequently managing to get into the target organization. However, it is popularly used to mean any long-term clandestine spy or informant within an organization (government or private). In police work, a mole is an undercover law-enforcement agent who joins an organization in order to collect incriminating evidence about its operations and to eventually charge its members.

The term was introduced to the public by British spy novelist John le Carré in his 1974 novel &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; and has since entered general usage, but its origin is unclear, as well as to what extent it was used by intelligence services before it became popularized. Le Carré, a former British intelligence officer, said that the term &quot;mole&quot; was actually used by the Soviet intelligence agency, the KGB, and that a corresponding term used by Western intelligence services was &quot;sleeper agent&quot;. While the term &quot;mole&quot; had been applied to spies in the book &quot;Historie of the Reign of King Henry VII&quot; written in 1626 by Sir Francis Bacon, Le Carré said he did not get the term from that source.

==Overview==
A mole may be recruited early in life, and take decades to get a job in government service and reach a position of access to secret information before becoming active as a spy. Perhaps the most famous examples of moles were the Cambridge Five, five upper-class British men recruited by the KGB as communist students at Cambridge University in the 1930s who later rose to high levels in various parts of the British government. By contrast, most espionage agents, such as CIA counterintelligence officer Aldrich Ames and FBI agent Robert Hanssen, who spied on the US government for the KGB, were either recruited or offered their services as spies after they were in place as members of the target organization.

Because their recruitment occurred in the remote past, moles are difficult for a nation&#x27;s security services to detect. The possibility that a top politician, corporate executive, government minister, or officer in an intelligence service could be a mole working for a foreign government is the worst nightmare of counterintelligence services. For example, James Angleton, director of counterintelligence for the CIA between 1954 and 1975, was reportedly obsessed with suspicions that the top levels of Western governments were riddled with long-term communist agents and accused numerous politicians such as former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former Canadian Prime Ministers Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau, former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and many members of Congress before he was removed in 1975.

Moles have been featured in numerous espionage films, television shows, video games and novels.

==Reasons for use==

The most common procedure used by intelligence services to recruit agents is to find the location within the foreign government or organization of the information they want (the &quot;target&quot;), find out which people have access to it, and attempt to recruit one of them as a spy (&quot;espionage agent&quot;) to obtain the information. However, the people with access to top secret government information, who are government employees with high security clearances, are carefully monitored by the government&#x27;s security apparatus for just that sort of espionage approach. Thus, it is difficult for a representative of the foreign intelligence service to meet with them clandestinely to recruit them. Private organizations, such as large corporations or terrorist groups, have similar security monitors. 

In addition, the security clearance process weeds out employees who are openly disgruntled, ideologically disaffected, or otherwise having motives for betraying their country, so people in such positions are likely to reject recruitment as spies. Therefore, some intelligence services have tried to reverse the above process by first recruiting potential agents and then having them conceal their allegiance and pursue careers in the target government agency in the hope that they can reach positions of access to desired information.

Because the spy career of a mole is so long-term, sometimes occupying most of a lifetime, those who become moles must be highly motivated. One common motivation is ideology (political convictions). During the Cold War, a major source of moles in Western countries was so-called fellow travellers, Westerners who, in their youth during the 1920s to 1940s, became disaffected with their own governments and sympathetic to world communism without actually joining a communist party.

<doc id="343168" wikidata="Q494221" url="?curid=343168" title="The Secret Policeman's Ball">
<text>The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball is a series of benefit shows staged initially in the United Kingdom to raise funds for the human rights organisation Amnesty International. The shows started in 1976 featuring popular British comedians but later included leading musicians and actors. The &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; shows are credited by many prominent entertainers with having galvanised them to become involved with Amnesty and other social and political causes in succeeding years.

Co-founded by Monty Python member John Cleese, campaigner Peter Luff (Assistant Director Amnesty International 1974–1978), and entertainment industry executive Martin Lewis, there have been four distinct eras of the Amnesty benefit shows. The shows of the first era (1976–1981), featuring five members of Monty Python and newcomers such as Rowan Atkinson, yielded films, television specials, home-videos, and albums that have since been widely seen and heard internationally. The three subsequent eras (1987–1989, 1991–2001 and 2006 onwards) have primarily featured locally popular British performers – and spin-off products have been released mainly in the UK.

In March 2012, &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; took place in the United States for the first time. The one-night show at New York&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall on 4 March was part of Amnesty&#x27;s 50th anniversary commemorations.

In January 2013, the website for &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; was set to redirect to Amnesty International&#x27;s; its registration has since expired. However, in 2019, the show was adapted as &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Tour,&quot; performing at Hackney Empire in London, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and Manchester Palace Theatre.

== Overview ==
The series was created and developed by Monty Python member John Cleese, Peter Luff (Assistant Director Amnesty International 1974–1978) and entertainment industry executive Martin Lewis who subsequently worked with Peter Walker (Amnesty&#x27;s Fund-Raising Officer from 1978). Cleese, Lewis and Luff worked together on the first two shows (1976 and 1977). After this, Cleese and Lewis worked on the next two shows (1979 and 1981) with Luff&#x27;s replacement at Amnesty, Peter Walker – using the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; title for the first time in 1979 and developing the series identity. Cleese credits Lewis with coining the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; title. In an interview aired on BBC TV on 22 June 1979, Cleese told interviewer Michael Billington &quot;It&#x27;s Martin Lewis&#x27; title, I can pin that one on him. But I thought it was quite funny.&quot;

Although the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; title was not used until the third show in 1979, the two preceding shows in 1976 and 1977 were retrospectively treated as part of the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s&quot; canon.

Cleese and Lewis subsequently worked individually on other Amnesty projects. Cleese made brief cameo appearances in the 1987 and 1989 shows and co-directed the latter. Lewis produced two American films drawn from the first four shows (released in the US in 1982 and 1983) and then helped expand the participation of rock musicians for Amnesty (that he first engendered in the 1979 and 1981 shows) with his contributions to the 1986 &quot;Conspiracy of Hope&quot; US tour and the 1988 &quot;Human Rights Now!&quot; world tour.

The first wave of shows took place approximately every other year, and three of the first four shows were filmed and released theatrically as movies with corresponding record albums. Because multi-artist benefit shows with contemporary performers were a new phenomenon in Britain in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, they were accorded considerable media coverage and public attention.

After 1981, there was a six-year hiatus. When Amnesty International re-commenced staging benefit shows, it did so without the benefit of the Amnesty staff members and outside producers who had successfully guided the first wave of shows. The new team running Amnesty International re-commenced staging benefit shows in 1987, and the shows were on a noticeably smaller scale and consequently generated less media attention. The shows from 1987 onwards were videotaped to be shown as TV specials and/or released on home video in Britain rather than filmed as movies with prospects for international release. The sole exception to the smaller scale events was an ill-fated attempt in June 1988 to stage a weekend concert event titled &quot;Amnesty International Festival of Youth&quot; at the 65,000 capacity Milton Keynes Bowl. The event was a massive failure and for the first time ever, one of Amnesty&#x27;s fund-raising benefit events lost money.

Only two more of Amnesty&#x27;s benefit shows (in 1987 and 1989) carried a &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot;-related title. Between 1991 and 2001 Amnesty staged four more benefit events and though they were comedy shows in the same vein as their predecessors, none of them carried the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; title. When Amnesty staged a 40th anniversary show in 2001 it was stated that the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; title had run its course and would not be revived.

However, in October 2006, following a 17-year gap, the name was revived, and also used for shows in October 2008 and March 2012.

=== Lasting impact ===
The first four shows (1976–1981) and their spin-offs are credited by many prominent comedians, musicians, actors and producers with having galvanised them to become involved with Amnesty and other social and political causes in succeeding years.

Rock stars Bob Geldof, Bono and Sting have all attributed their involvement in humanitarian issues to their exposure to the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; shows: Geldof, Sting and Clapton as participants with Bono as an audience member.

Bono told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 1986: &quot;I saw &#x27;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&#x27; and it became a part of me. It sowed a seed...&quot; In 2001, Bono described &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; to an Amnesty audience as &quot;a mysterious and extraordinary event that certainly changed my life...&quot; In 1986, Sting told NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve been a member of Amnesty and a support member for five years, due to an entertainment event called &#x27;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&#x27; and before that I did not know about Amnesty, I did not know about its work, I did not know about torture in the world.&quot; Bob Geldof and Ultravox singer Midge Ure first met and worked together at 1981&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot; which was the first benefit show that either of them had performed at. Geldof credits the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; series with having inspired his own charity show endeavours.

The earliest shows predated the proliferation of comedy and rock benefit shows that took place in the UK and US in the mid-1980s such as Live Aid, Farm Aid, Prince&#x27;s Trust concerts, The Free Nelson Mandela Concert and Comic Relief. The Amnesty shows are considered to have been the pioneering charity events that helped inspire the later shows.

Amnesty directly attributes the leaps in awareness of the human rights issue, the significant increases in its membership (especially among the young) and its dramatically increased fundraising achievements to the impact of the various shows, their spin-offs and successor Amnesty events such as the Conspiracy of Hope and Human Rights Now! tours.

Some of the films received international cinema release, and the soundtrack albums enjoyed commercial success worldwide, all of which generated considerable international awareness of the original shows, together with a growing grassroots awareness of Amnesty International and the human rights issue. Amnesty states that public awareness of Amnesty increased by 700% between the first and third shows. Membership of the organisation increased sharply.

=== Introduction to an American audience ===
The films and records of the first three Amnesty benefit shows did not initially receive much exposure in the US, but this started to change in 1981–1982.

The original British versions of the two &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; movies were presented at the 1981 and 1982 &quot;Filmex Los Angeles International Film Festival&quot;. Media coverage of the screenings in magazines such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; created awareness of the benefit shows.

The album &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball – The Music&quot; was released by Island Records/Warner Bros. Records in March 1982 and became a Top Thirty album in the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

The third major element in bringing the Secret Policeman&#x27;s Balls to the U.S. was the acquisition of the UK films by American distributors Harvey Weinstein and Bob Weinstein, founders of the independent distribution company Miramax Films. They had acquired the US rights to the film of the 1979 show &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; and subsequently its successor &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot;. They determined that neither film would be successful in the American marketplace because some of the content was too parochial for American tastes. With Amnesty&#x27;s blessing, they decided to combine the two films for the US.

Original producer Martin Lewis distilled the best performances from both films into one new 110-minute film for the American market, with an opening sequence narrated by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; announcer Don Pardo. The new film premiered in New York in May 1982 as a fund-raiser for the U.S. section of Amnesty; it received enthusiastic reviews and went on to box office success. The film is recognised as Miramax&#x27;s first hit. The American version of the film was released on home video by MGM-UA later in 1982. The US film (though drawn from the UK films of both the 1979 and 1981 shows) used as its title &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot; – a title that by May 1982 had some resonance in the US marketplace because of the success of the music soundtrack album and media coverage of the film festival screenings.

In 1983, the Weinsteins and Lewis produced an 80-minute sequel TV special for HBO/Cinemax later released on home video by Media Home Entertainment titled &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Private Parts&quot;. The program compiled material from the first two Amnesty shows (the 1976 and 1977 benefits) and the best of the content from the original 1979 and 1981 films that had not been used in the 1982 US version of &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot;.

=== American offshoots (1986 and 1988) ===
In the early 1980s, Amnesty had a low profile in the US, and its Executive Director Jack Healey was looking for a way to raise the organisation&#x27;s profile, especially among young people. In a 1986 profile in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Healey related how he decided to find out if the goodwill towards Amnesty of rock musicians that he had seen in the US version of &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot; could be put to service to help improve Amnesty&#x27;s profile in America.

Consulting with Martin Lewis, Healey conceived and produced Conspiracy of Hope, a 10-day/6-concert rock tour of the US that took place in June 1986 in celebration of Amnesty&#x27;s 25th anniversary. The tour was headlined by a mixture of British and Irish artists – Sting, The Police, Peter Gabriel and U2 – with American and Canadian musicians Jackson Browne, Lou Reed, Joan Baez, The Neville Brothers and Bryan Adams. The tour was promoted by rock impresario Bill Graham. The tour concluded with a major all-day concert at Giants Stadium in New Jersey that was televised live by MTV. The final concert featured additional artists including Bob Geldof, Joan Armatrading, Rubén Blades, Carlos Santana, Howard Jones, Miles Davis and Joni Mitchell. Just one month after the tour, the membership of Amnesty in the USA had increased by 45,000 members.

Subsequent to the &quot;A Conspiracy of Hope&quot; tour, Lewis and Healey conceived the 1988 Amnesty world tour Human Rights Now!, that featured Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel, Youssou N&#x27;Dour and Tracy Chapman. Lewis and Healey&#x27;s intention was to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by staging a tour that would visit all five continents. The aim was to raise consciousness of human rights issues rather than fund-raising.

The six-week/20-concert tour was produced by Healey and Bill Graham. The tour staged concerts in 19 different nations in all five continents – and was considered successful in raising considerable awareness of the human rights issue throughout the world.

The two tours were the cornerstone of what subsequently became known collectively as the Human Rights Concerts – a series of music events and tours staged by the US Section of Amnesty International between 1986 and 1998.

== First four shows 1976–1981 ==

=== 1976 – &quot;A Poke in the Eye&quot; ===

In early 1976, the British section of Amnesty International was seeking a way to simultaneously raise funds for itself and elevate the very low profile of human rights issues in British public discourse. It decided to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Amnesty parent organisation with a simple one-night benefit show with a few entertainers contributing services as was the norm with charity events in that era. There was no anticipation that the event might be filmed or recorded to be shared with an audience beyond the people attending the benefit, and no anticipation that it might be anything other than a one-off event.

Amnesty&#x27;s Assistant Director Peter Luff approached John Cleese of the Monty Python comedy troupe to seek his participation. Cleese was taken with the idea and volunteered to assist the event by helping to &quot;round up a few friends&quot;.

Cleese&#x27;s &quot;few friends&quot; turned out to be colleagues in Monty Python, pals in the earlier British comedic ensemble &quot;Beyond The Fringe&quot;, his &quot;Footlights&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot; peers (including The Goodies), and other members of the British comedy community from the 1960s and 1970s (primarily those described as &quot;Oxbridge&quot; comedians).

Luff, working with his Amnesty colleague David Simpson, obtained the use of Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, free of charge. The tickets for the show were advertised solely in the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; and were sold out within four days.

The other member of the production team was Martin Lewis, a young record industry executive who initially undertook to produce a record album of the show and then became closely involved with Cleese, Luff and Simpson on the show production – which evolved into a three-night run. TV documentary maker Roger Graef, approached the team offering to make a &quot;fly-on-the-wall&quot;-style documentary about the production of the show and to film the show itself. The resulting film was titled &quot;Pleasure at Her Majesty&#x27;s&quot;. Lewis also undertook responsibility for publicising the show and its film and record spin-offs.

==== Show ====
The show – titled by Cleese &quot;A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)&quot; – took place on 1–3 April 1976 as a series of late-night galas at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in London&#x27;s West End theatre district. The show was directed by &quot;Beyond The Fringe&quot; alumnus Jonathan Miller. The shows started at 11.30 pm, after the performance of the theatre&#x27;s regularly scheduled play. Being late-night events became a hallmark of subsequent shows.

In addition to Lewis&#x27; audio recording team, Roger Graef, used a small 16 mm crew, to film rehearsals and performances. The footage was later assembled into the film &quot;Pleasure at Her Majesty&#x27;s&quot;, which premiered in November 1976 at the 20th annual London Film Festival, and was broadcast by the BBC in December 1976. Subsequently, the film received a modest theatrical release at art-house cinemas in 1977. A record album of the show, titled &quot;A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)&quot;, was released in November 1976 by Transatlantic Records and was a commercial success.

The original working title for the show had been &quot;An Evening Without David Frost&quot; – an allusion to the fact that most of the performers had worked with, or for, David Frost early in their careers.

=== 1977 – &quot;The Mermaid Frolics&quot; ===
In May 1977 a second Amnesty benefit was held to build on the success of the first show and with the intent of developing momentum for a regularly scheduled benefit show. The returning production team included Amnesty Assistant Director Peter Luff and Martin Lewis. The show was directed by Monty Python member Terry Jones. This show was unlike the first show and its primary successors in three key aspects. It was a single-night event rather than consisting of multiple performances, it started at 8:00 pm on a Sunday evening, and the show was videotaped as a TV special rather than filmed for theatrical release.

The show took place at London&#x27;s Mermaid Theatre and was titled &quot;An Evening Without Sir Bernard Miles&quot;, an affectionate reference to the actor/manager who had founded the Mermaid Theatre. The title grew out of the discarded working title of the previous year&#x27;s show.

The comedic performers in the 1977 show included several who had performed in the first show – such as Peter Cook, Terry Jones, John Cleese – joined by his then wife Connie Booth – and some newcomers including Sir Peter Ustinov. There were also a handful of musical performers including classical guitarist John Williams, actress/singer Julie Covington and folk troubadour Pete Atkin.

The album of the show and the TV show were given a fresh title by producer Lewis: &quot;The Mermaid Frolics&quot;. The album was released on Polydor Records in December 1977 and the TV special was shown on the ITV network that same month through Granada TV. The title of the TV show and record album has since become the name by which the original stage show itself is referred to.

=== 1979 – &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; ===

Amnesty decided not to present a benefit show in 1978, in order to consider how to make better use of the performing talent so favourably disposed to assist it in raising funds. Peter Luff left Amnesty in 1978 and the organisation&#x27;s new fund-raising officer, Peter Walker, was deputed to work with Lewis on reconfiguring the show to raise more money and greater awareness of Amnesty.

Lewis and Walker determined that the third show needed to be produced in the same vein as the first show (i.e. multiple performances, late-night and filmed for theatrical release) but with a more professional approach to exploiting the film. They approached John Cleese who agreed to be involved again. He also agreed to direct the show, though requesting that his credit read &quot;&quot;slightly&quot; directed by John Cleese.&quot; He also recruited the majority of the comedic performers – including Peter Cook and fellow Pythons Michael Palin and Terry Jones. He also selected a newcomer on the British comedy scene named Rowan Atkinson. Lewis recruited Scottish comedian Billy Connolly with whom he had worked while employed at Transatlantic Records. Connolly was the first non-Oxbridge comedian to perform at an Amnesty benefit – a distinction he made fun of at the show.

Lewis proposed to Cleese that in addition to the comedy performances the show should feature some contemporary rock musicians. Cleese delegated this responsibility to Lewis who recruited Who guitarist Pete Townshend to perform, as well as new wave singer-songwriter Tom Robinson.

Cleese and Palin promoted the forthcoming show in an interview conducted by Michael Billington, transmitted on BBC television on 22 June 1979. Cleese and Palin explained their support for Amnesty and their reasons for doing the shows.

The shows took place over four consecutive nights at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in London on 27–30 June 1979.

The shows were again filmed by a rudimentary 16 mm documentary crew and the resulting 100-minute film – also titled &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; was released theatrically by ITC in June 1980 heralded by a special preview attended by many of the show&#x27;s participants. (A one-hour television special drawn from the performances aired on Britain&#x27;s ITV network by London Weekend Television in December 1979, to coincide with the release of &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; record album on Island Records, produced by Lewis, of the comedy performances.)

A second record was released to coincide with the release of the film, a 12-inch EP containing eight musical performances from the show including three Townshend songs.

Peter Cook&#x27;s nine-minute parody of the summing up of Mr Justice Cantley in the Thorpe Trial, &quot;Entirely A Matter for You,&quot; was so successful that the audio recording of the live performance was released as an album on Virgin Records entitled &quot;Here Comes the Judge: Live&quot;.

The film and record albums enjoyed critical and commercial success in the UK and sparked international interest. The film was released in several countries with notable success in Australia. For the first time there was also interest in the US with the EP of the musical performances being released as an album by Atco/Atlantic Records and the US movie rights being acquired by fledgling independent distributor Miramax Films.

The iconic &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s&quot; cartoon character used to promote the show, film and record albums made its first appearance in 1979. It was created by New Statesman cartoonist Colin Wheeler who had been commissioned by Peter Walker.

This film, plus four others, is included on the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Balls&quot; DVD.

=== 1981 – &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot; ===

Following the success of the 1979 show and the financial benefits accruing to Amnesty from the spin-off movie, TV special and record albums – Cleese, Lewis and Walker planned the next show to be a more spectacular event.

Cleese focused on broadening the comedic talent to be presented at the show. In addition to the Amnesty show stalwarts drawn from the Oxbridge/&quot;Monty Python&quot;/&quot;Beyond The Fringe&quot; orbit, he invited newcomers such as Rowan Atkinson&#x27;s colleagues from the BBC TV show &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; including Pamela Stephenson and Griff Rhys Jones; comedian Victoria Wood and regional comic Jasper Carrott. Lewis secured a return appearance by Billy Connolly and a debut appearance by &quot;alternative&quot; comedian Alexei Sayle whom Lewis had recently discovered and was managing.

Building on the success of Pete Townshend&#x27;s 1979 appearance Lewis recruited other rock musicians to perform at the 1981 show including Sting, Phil Collins, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Donovan and Bob Geldof.

The show was presented at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on four consecutive nights on 9–12 September 1981.

Cleese invited theatre director Ron Eyre to co-direct the show with him. Walker secured funds to have the show filmed (at Lewis&#x27; suggestion) by new wave filmmaker Julien Temple. For the first time an Amnesty show was filmed with a full 35 mm film crew. The resulting film was released in the UK by UIP in March 1982. It became a commercial success on both its theatrical release and its subsequent home video release.

Two record albums were also released by Springtime/Island Records. One featured highlights of the comedy material, while the other featured the musical performances. In addition to the movies and albums, Methuen published a large coffee-table book edited by Lewis and Walker, featuring transcripts of the sketches from the show, photographs and some specially written comedic notes by Michael Palin and Terry Jones.

=== Distinctive elements of early shows ===
The reputation of the original four shows has endured and grown over the years. In September 2006, 30 years after the first show, a profile in the respected British newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; referred to the &quot;talismanic power of the words The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; and &quot;the show&#x27;s folkloric status&quot;.

There are many factors that contributed to the reputation of the shows, particularly those of the &#x27;first wave&#x27;:

* The galas were the first stage shows in the UK to feature a broad cross-section of the baby boomer generation of contemporary comedic performers who came of age in the 1960s and 1970s. Media reviews at the time described the 1976 show as a gathering of the tribes.
* They were the first stage shows in the UK to present comedic performers (such as Monty Python and Rowan Atkinson) in the same setting and shows as their contemporaries in rock music.
* Solo live performances by rock musicians of their hits was not a familiar phenomenon prior to the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s&quot; shows. This changed with Townshend&#x27;s performance of &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;, Sting singing &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; and &quot;Roxanne&quot;, Phil Collins performing &quot;In The Air Tonight&quot;.
* The shows presented unusual permutations of performers, in the 1976 show, Peter Cook of &quot;Beyond The Fringe&quot; became an honorary member of &quot;Monty Python&quot; for their &quot;Courtroom Sketch&quot;. Terry Jones of &quot;Monty Python&quot; took the place of the absent Dudley Moore in &quot;Beyond The Fringe&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Shakespeare skit&quot;. In a later show, Rowan Atkinson was a guest performer with three members of &quot;Monty Python&quot; for the &quot;Four Yorkshiremen sketch&quot;. John Cleese had the opportunity to perform in &quot;two-handers&quot; (skits for just two performers) with two of his mentors: Jonathan Miller in 1977 and Peter Cook in 1979. In 1981, it was Cleese&#x27;s turn to fulfil the role of mentor in a two-hander with Rowan Atkinson.
* The out-of-the-ordinary pairings extended to musical performers. In the 1979 show, producer Martin Lewis arranged for rock guitarist Pete Townshend to duet with classical guitar virtuoso John Williams on The Who&#x27;s &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;. Lewis also arranged for new-wave rock performers Sting and Bob Geldof to perform in a specially assembled super-group (named &quot;The Secret Police&quot;) with 1960s guitar icons Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck on a grand finale performance of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot;.
* Much of the material performed in the much heralded first four shows (1976–1981) came from the repertoire of sketches and skits created in the preceding 15 years by &quot;Beyond The Fringe&quot; alumni, and by &quot;Monty Python&quot; and its radio and TV antecedents, this radio or TV material was presented on stage. For example: several skits from the cult 1960s TV show &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot; were resuscitated by John Cleese (one of that show&#x27;s creators) and performed by him with cast members, including fellow Pythons (Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Graham Chapman) and other peers (John Bird, John Fortune and Tim Brooke-Taylor (the last also an &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot; writer and performer), along with younger performers (Rowan Atkinson, Griff Rhys Jones), and Cleese&#x27;s then wife, actress/writer Connie Booth.
* The shows were also the first to present a new wave of comedians to a wider audience, such as Billy Connolly and Alexei Sayle. By the time of the second and third waves of &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s&quot; shows (in 1987–1989 and 1991–2001, respectively), &quot;alternative comedians&quot; had become the new mainstream, succeeding the Oxbridge comedy school of the 1960s and 1970s. The later Amnesty shows followed the lead of the earlier shows in presenting the most popular comedy performers of the era, such as Ben Elton, French &amp; Saunders, and Eddie Izzard.

=== Aftermath ===
Following the success of &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; shows, there was a substantial increase in the number of benefit shows and charity projects in the UK in the early to mid-1980s – for a wide variety of causes. Many of the shows were modelled on the format of the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; shows. At a certain point the media started to refer to a phenomenon described as &quot;benefit fatigue&quot; a term coined to describe the attitude towards the glut of benefit shows – many featuring the same group of performers – that were taking place each year.

By 1982, Amnesty had lost the services of two key staff members, Peter Luff and Peter Walker, who had guided the first 4 benefit shows.

The British Section of Amnesty responded to these two factors by taking a break from staging new benefit shows for six years. When it restarted the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s&quot; series in 1987 it scaled back from producing theatrical movies of its shows to making them into TV and home video specials.

== 1987–2001 shows ==

=== 1987 – &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Third Ball&quot; ===
When the British Amnesty shows finally resumed in 1987 after a six-year hiatus, the show format was retooled in an effort to take advantage of the growing number of rock musicians supporting Amnesty. Instead of the live show being primarily a comedy show with a few musical cameos, the event made a point of giving equal emphasis to comedy and music. The show&#x27;s four nights were divided up into two nights of comedy and two nights of music.

The line-up of musicians included several who were already veterans of earlier Amnesty benefits in the UK and/or USA: Bob Geldof, Peter Gabriel, Jackson Browne and Lou Reed. Other performers included Kate Bush, David Gilmour, Mark Knopfler, Joan Armatrading, Chet Atkins, World Party and Duran Duran.

Most of the comedic performers in the 1987 show were talents familiar primarily just to British audiences. This made the film of the show far less appealing to overseas audiences and unlike its predecessors it did not find major international distribution in lucrative markets such as the US and Canada.

Comedic performers included: Stephen Fry &amp; Hugh Laurie, Mel Smith &amp; Griff Rhys Jones, Dawn French &amp; Jennifer Saunders, Ruby Wax, Hale and Pace, Lenny Henry, Rory Bremner, Robbie Coltrane, Ben Elton and the &quot;Spitting Image&quot; puppets.

The shows took place at The London Palladium over four consecutive nights 26–29 March 1987. The shows were videotaped and a home video special was created integrating performances from the two comedy nights and two music nights. It was released by Virgin Vision. Two TV specials were created and transmitted – one featuring musical performances, the other featuring comedy performances. Following the pattern established by the 1979 and 1981 shows, separate albums of the comedic and musical performances was released by Virgin Records. The shows were produced by Tony Hollingsworth, and the videos were produced by Hollingsworth and Neville Bolt.

The 92-minute TV and video specials were subsequently criticised for the increased musical content. While all the musical performances were presented in full, the comedic performances were often edited heavily. The TV version also prominently featured spoof documentary segments by newcomer Ruby Wax, which took time from the performances of the comedians and musicians. This reflected the fact that, unlike the previous shows (which had been stage events that integrated comedy and music) the performances were edited together from two entirely different types of stage show.

=== 1988 – &quot;Amnesty International Festival of Youth&quot; ===
In 1986, the US Section of Amnesty International had organised the very successful Conspiracy of Hope tour featuring leading rock musicians on an 11-day/6-concert tour of the US. This tour built upon the participation of rock musicians in the 1979 and 1981 &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s&quot; shows. In early 1988, the US Section of Amnesty announced plans for a world tour featuring major musicians to take place later that year. Titled Human Rights Now! the tour would commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The primary artists who had signed on to perform were Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel, Youssou N&#x27;Dour and Tracy Chapman. It was also announced that the world tour would commence with a gigantic kick-off concert in England – a salute to the fact that Amnesty had been founded in UK. The choice of England for the first concert was also in acknowledgement of the English &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; shows that had pioneered the deployment of rock musicians for Amnesty&#x27;s benefit, and the presence in the line-up of two prominent English musicians, Sting and Peter Gabriel.

Shortly after the announcement of the forthcoming concert in England, the British Section of Amnesty International announced that it too had decided to salute the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with a rock concert in England. The British Section of Amnesty scheduled its own concert to take place less than ten weeks prior to the announced date of the Human Rights Now! English concert already organised by their American sister organisation.

Amnesty&#x27;s British Section then booked one of Britain&#x27;s largest concert venues, the 65,000 capacity Milton Keynes Bowl and at very short notice staged a weekend-long extravaganza titled &quot;Amnesty International Festival of Youth&quot;. Fatally for the event, Amnesty&#x27;s in-house producer Pat Duffy scheduled the event to follow just one week after the long-announced &quot;Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute&quot; at England&#x27;s 82,000 capacity Wembley Stadium. The Nelson Mandela concert had already lined up appearances by many of Amnesty&#x27;s most prominent supporters in the music community – including Sting, Peter Gabriel, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, Bryan Adams, Jackson Browne, Steven van Zandt, Midge Ure, Simple Minds, Youssou N’Dour, Joan Armatrading – all of whom declined to partake in the new Amnesty show taking place just one week later. This made it virtually impossible for the comparatively last-minute Amnesty event, with less celebrated performers, organised by people without much previous experience, to succeed. Amnesty resisted recommendations to postpone or cancel the event and proceeded with the weekend.

Amnesty&#x27;s &quot;Festival of Youth&quot; weekend featured: Aswad, Joe Strummer, Big Country, The Stranglers, Aztec Camera, Motörhead, The Bhundu Boys, Go West, The Damned, Spear of Destiny, Martin Stephenson and the Daintees, New Model Army, The Icicle Works, Rhythm Sisters, The Men They Couldn&#x27;t Hang, Transvision Vamp, So, World Domination Enterprises, Runrig.

Positioned chronologically between the two previously announced major benefit concerts that summer in the UK – the &quot;Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Concert&quot; and Amnesty&#x27;s own &quot;Human Rights Now!&quot; concert, both of which featured far more stellar line-ups. Thus the &quot;Festival of Youth&quot; was a major financial disaster for Amnesty. Uniquely among all the Amnesty benefit shows, Amnesty failed to find a film studio, television network, radio broadcaster, home-video distributor or record company to partner with it on the event and this compounded the substantial financial losses sustained by Amnesty.

=== 1989 – &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Biggest Ball&quot; ===
After the criticisms of the 1987 production&#x27;s disproportionate focus on music – and the financial disaster of its music-only &quot;Festival of Youth&quot; weekend concert in 1988 – Amnesty returned to the original formula that had been so successful in the 1976–81 era with a primary focus on comedy. Pat Duffy was dropped from organising any further benefit events for Amnesty and for the 1989 show, Amnesty hired producer Judith Holder.

John Cleese and Michael Palin made brief cameo appearances, establishing a connection to the original shows. Also returning was Peter Cook – on this occasion performing with his longtime comedic partner, Dudley Moore – and satirist John Bird. Several performers from the 1987 show returned including: Adrian Edmondson, Stephen Fry &amp; Hugh Laurie, Dawn French &amp; Jennifer Saunders, Lenny Henry, Rory Bremner, Ben Elton, Robbie Coltrane, Willie Rushton and the &quot;Spitting Image&quot; puppets.

Performances took place at the Cambridge Theatre between 30 August and 2 September. The show was directed by Jennifer Saunders and John Cleese, and a videotape was televised in October 1989.

=== 1991 – &quot;Barf Bites Back&quot; and &quot;Big 30&quot; ===
In early 1991, Amnesty held a comedy gala at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in London to commemorate its 30th anniversary. The event was the first Amnesty comedy show since 1979 which did not use the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s&quot; title. The performers were primarily alternative comedians including: Tony Slattery, Lee Evans, Simon Fanshawe, Martin Soan, Eddie Izzard and Richard Vranch. The show was videotaped and televised by Granada TV in August 1991.

At the end of 1991, a second event commemorating Amnesty&#x27;s 30th anniversary was organised as a TV special. The cast included Ben Elton, Lenny Henry, Steve Coogan, Julian Clary, Frank Skinner, Paul Merton, Vic Reeves and comedic music from Spinal Tap. The show&#x27;s musical directors were David Gilmour of Pink Floyd and Jools Holland. Musical guests included Dave Stewart, Seal, Tom Jones, Morrissey, EMF, Jason Donovan, Kim Wilde, Rick Astley, Daryl Hall and Lisa Stansfield. The show was hosted by Jonathan Ross and Alexei Sayle.

Unlike Amnesty&#x27;s previous shows, these shows took place in a television studio. The performers were videotaped at Central Independent Television Studios, Nottingham, on 13 and 15 December 1991 and the resulting TV show was televised later that month.

=== 1997 &amp; &#x27;98 – &quot;So You Think You&#x27;re Irish&quot; and &quot;So You Think You&#x27;re Irish 2&quot; ===
In early 1997, Amnesty held a comedy gala at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin. The performers were primarily Irish performers including: Barry Murphy, Brendan O&#x27;Carroll, Pauline McLynn, Dermot Morgan, Kevin McAleer, Owen O&#x27;Neill, and Kevin Gildea. The show was videotaped and televised on ITV in March 1997.

In 1998, Amnesty staged a reprise of &quot;So You Think You&#x27;re Irish&quot; in Dublin. The performers were again primarily Irish performers including: Milo O&#x27;Shea, Barry Murphy, Pauline McLynn, Dylan Moran, Dara Ó Briain, Tommy Tiernan, Ed Byrne, Kevin McAleer, Owen O&#x27;Neill, Ian Coppinger, Eddie Bannon, Brendan Dempsey and Kevin Gildea. The show was videotaped and televised on ITV in August 1998.

=== 2001 – &quot;We Know Where You Live&quot; ===
In June 2001, Amnesty staged a benefit show that was video-taped as a TV special to commemorate its 40th anniversary.

Titled &quot;We Know Where You Live&quot; the show was a one-night performance at the Wembley Arena. The show was coordinated by comedian Eddie Izzard. The majority of the performers were British comedians popular in their homeland but not well known internationally. Performers included Izzard, Harry Enfield, Paul Whitehouse, Vic Reeves, Sean Lock, Harry Hill, Jeremy Hardy, Phill Jupitus, Richard Blackwood, Dom Joly, Simon Day and Jonathan Ross – with cameo appearances by actors Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Richard E. Grant, Tim Roth, Emma Thompson, and Julie Walters.

In a salute to the original &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot;, the finale of the show was a re-creation by Alan Rickman, Vic Reeves, Eddie Izzard and Harry Enfield of the &quot;Four Yorkshiremen&quot; sketch that had been performed at the 1979 Amnesty show by John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Rowan Atkinson.

Coordinator Eddie Izzard also acknowledged the show&#x27;s heritage in an interview in London&#x27;s &quot;Evening Standard&quot; (31 May 2001) saying: &quot;The musical elements will follow the previous format because it&#x27;s the son of &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; – so they&#x27;re more acoustic than electric...&quot;

Explaining the show&#x27;s new title, Izzard told the Evening Standard: &quot;The title is designed to streamline the message of &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot;, which was a bit more ambiguous. &quot;We Know Where You Live&quot; is about gangsters or governments who run countries and withhold human rights.&quot;

The audience saw a musical performance on a giant video screen by U2 via satellite. Also acknowledging the heritage of the show, Bono introduced U2&#x27;s performance by saying: &quot;Right, what we&#x27;d like to do now is go live from Toronto to London, to &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; – which is a mysterious and extraordinary event that certainly changed my life...&quot; (Notwithstanding the description of the show as &quot;live&quot; the U2 performance had actually been pre-recorded in Toronto two weeks earlier on 21 May 2001.)

Other live musical performances included Stereophonics, Badly Drawn Boy and Tom Jones.

== Shows since 2006 ==

On 18 August 2006, Amnesty International announced that it was reviving the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; title for its forthcoming benefit show – a one-night show to be held at the Royal Albert Hall, London, on 14 October 2006. The name that had by then become the colloquially used umbrella title for all of Amnesty&#x27;s fund-raisers. The 2006 show was coordinated by British comedian Eddie Izzard – who had coordinated the 2001 Amnesty show.

=== 2006 – &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball 2006&quot; ===

The 13th show in the Amnesty series took place at the Royal Albert Hall, London, on 14 October 2006.

Unlike the first (1976–1981) era of Amnesty shows featuring mainly internationally known stars – the line-up mirrored the later (1987–1989 and 1991–2001) eras of Amnesty shows with the vast majority of performers being little known outside the UK. The one internationally known British performer – Eddie Izzard – headlined a roster of locally popular acts – including Russell Brand, Jon Culshaw, Al Murray, The Mighty Boosh and Meera Syal. Four American performers also made cameo appearances: comedic actor Chevy Chase appeared in a skit along with actor Seth Green – and comedians Jimmy Fallon and Sarah Silverman also performed. There was a cameo from actor Richard E. Grant and animations featuring familiar voices including Jennifer Saunders. Music was supplied by The Zutons and The Magic Numbers.

The 2006 edition of &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; was not filmed for international theatrical release, but was instead videotaped for a UK TV special of highlights that was broadcast by Britain&#x27;s Channel 4 on 31 October 2006. A DVD with 90 minutes of highlights from the three-hour event was also issued. There was also a &quot;cinecast&quot; in which the event was shown live in 17 cinemas in major British cities.

=== 2008 – &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball 2008&quot; ===
In July 2008, Amnesty announced that it would present another show to be titled &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball 2008&quot;. Like its immediate predecessor, the show was a single-night event at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall which took place on Saturday 4 October 2008.

The majority of the performers were again British (or UK-based) and not well known outside Great Britain, (one Canadian comedian Russell Peters and one American comedian Kristen Schaal were involved). There were contradictory announcements about the cast list for the show, with one &quot;finalised line-up&quot; for the event announced on Amnesty&#x27;s webpage and a different &quot;finalised cast list&quot; announced by the event&#x27;s broadcaster Channel Four indicating a lack of coordination between the two wings of the production.

The show included appearances from Frank Skinner, Alan Carr, Graham Norton, Sean Lock, Kristen Schaal, Fearne Cotton, Matt Berry, Katherine Parkinson, Mitchell and Webb, Jason Manford, Shappi Khorsandi, Russell Howard, Katy Brand, Tim Minchin, Sarah Millican, Kayvan Novak, Meera Syal, Shaun Williamson, Sharon Horgan, Nick Mohammed, Dan Clark, David Armand, Eddie Izzard, Ed Byrne, Deborah Meaden, Jon Culshaw, Gok Wan, and Mike Fenton Stevens. Additionally, Keane and Razorlight gave musical performances while Russell Peters appeared via video-tape.

The three-hour event was video-taped and a 95-minute television version was broadcast the following day on Britain&#x27;s Channel Four. There was also a &quot;cinecast&quot; in which the event was shown live in 35 cinemas in major British cities in addition to four cinemas in Australia and cinemas in six of Canada&#x27;s thirteen provinces and territories. The Cineplex cinema chain made the film available on 50 of its 1,317 screens.

=== 2012 – &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball 2012&quot; ===

Coinciding with Amnesty&#x27;s 50th anniversary, the 2012 edition of &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; took place outside of the UK for the first time under that title. It was staged on 4 March 2012 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The three-hour show featured a mix of prominent comedians from both Britain and the United States. After a taped introduction by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the live comedy lineup included US comedic performers: Jon Stewart, Ben Stiller, Fred Armisen, Kristen Wiig, Seth Meyers, Jason Sudeikis, Bobby Moynihan, Jay Pharoah, and Taran Killam (from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;), Rachel Dratch, David Cross &amp; Bob Odenkirk, Hannibal Buress, Sarah Silverman, Paul Rudd, Rashida Jones, Chris O&#x27;Dowd, Bill Hader (as Julian Assange), Rex Lee (as Kim Jong-un), comedic music by Reggie Watts.

Participating UK comedians were : Russell Brand, Eddie Izzard, Peter Serafinowicz, David Walliams, Jimmy Carr, Catherine Tate, Noel Fielding, Matt Berry, Micky Flanagan, Jack Whitehall, John Oliver.

Also appearing were actors Tim Roth and Liam Neeson. Neeson introduced a short presentation by formerly imprisoned Burmese comedian and political activist Zarganar. There was a cameo appearance by Richard Branson in one skit. There were music sets, each of three songs, by Mumford &amp; Sons and Coldplay. There were real-time comedic commentaries on the show from Statler and Waldorf of the Muppets and from Beavis and Butt-head in animated sequences. Monty Python alumni Michael Palin, Eric Idle, and Terry Jones appeared in pre-recorded video segments explaining comedically why they were not there. The event was streamed live in the USA on Epix, and televised by Channel 4 in the UK.

== Film, video and audio formats ==
Adaptations of the shows have been released in various film, video and audio formats over the years. Because there have been many different versions released in different configurations in different countries over the years, there has been some public confusion as to which version is which.

The confusion is most notable in respect of the two widely different versions of the film &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot;. The only home-video/DVD version presently available is based on the UK version of the film. There is currently no home-video version of the very different, original 1982 US version of the film.

The first two Amnesty productions &quot;Pleasure at Her Majesty&#x27;s&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Mermaid Frolics&quot; (1977) have only been released on home video in truncated form. Video reissues of &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot; (1981) have also had original sequences edited out.

The US compilation &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Private Parts&quot; (1983) – that featured special additional content and outtakes not included in the original UK films – has not been available in any format since the early 1980s and was only released in the US.

The most recent home-video release has been a 5-disc box set of DVDs entitled &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball: 25th Anniversary Silver Box Set&quot;. Released on region zero international format. The discs feature the edited, truncated versions of the earlier films.

The original audio albums of comedy and music from the shows have not been commercially available since the early 1990s.

Shout! Factory released &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Balls&quot; in January 2009. The 3-DVD set includes &quot;Pleasure at Her Majesty&#x27;s&quot; (1976), &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; (1979), &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot; (1981), &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Third Ball&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Biggest Ball&quot; (1989). In early 2010, Shout! Factory released the DVD &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Private Party&quot;, featuring the best comedic moments from various Secret Policeman&#x27;s Balls.

To celebrate the 30th anniversary of The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball, Shout! Factory partnered with Amnesty International on a collection of musical highlights entitled &quot;The Secret Policeman Rocks.&quot; The 14-track CD was released on 29 September 2009. A DVD of the 2012 US edition was released in North America in 2013.

<text>A dendritic spine (or spine) is a small membrane protrusion from a neuron&#x27;s dendrite that typically receives input from a single axon at the synapse. Dendritic spines serve as a storage site for synaptic strength and help transmit electrical signals to the neuron&#x27;s cell body. Most spines have a bulbous head (the spine head), and a thin neck that connects the head of the spine to the shaft of the dendrite. The dendrites of a single neuron can contain hundreds to thousands of spines. In addition to spines providing an anatomical substrate for memory storage and synaptic transmission, they may also serve to increase the number of possible contacts between neurons. It has also been suggested that changes in the activity of neurons have a positive effect on spine morphology.

== Structure ==
Dendritic spines are small with spine head volumes ranging 0.01 μm3 to 0.8 μm3. Spines with strong synaptic contacts typically have a large spine head, which connects to the dendrite via a membranous neck. The most notable classes of spine shape are &quot;thin&quot;, &quot;stubby&quot;, &quot;mushroom&quot;, and &quot;bifurcated&quot;. Electron microscopy studies have shown that there is a continuum of shapes between these categories. The variable spine shape and volume is thought to be correlated with the strength and maturity of each spine-synapse.

===Distribution===
Dendritic spines usually receive excitatory input from axons, although sometimes both inhibitory and excitatory connections are made onto the same spine head. Excitatory axon proximity to dendritic spines is not sufficient to predict the presence of a synapse, as demonstrated by the Lichtman lab in 2015.

Spines are found on the dendrites of most principal neurons in the brain, including the pyramidal neurons of the neocortex, the medium spiny neurons of the striatum, and the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Dendritic spines occur at a density of up to 5 spines/1 μm stretch of dendrite. Hippocampal and cortical pyramidal neurons may receive tens of thousands of mostly excitatory inputs from other neurons onto their equally numerous spines, whereas the number of spines on Purkinje neuron dendrites is an order of magnitude larger.

===Cytoskeleton and organelles===
The cytoskeleton of dendritic spines is particularly important in their synaptic plasticity; without a dynamic cytoskeleton, spines would be unable to rapidly change their volumes or shapes in responses to stimuli. These changes in shape might affect the electrical properties of the spine. The cytoskeleton of dendritic spines is primarily made of filamentous actin (F-actin). tubulin Monomers and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are present, and organized microtubules are present. Because spines have a cytoskeleton of primarily actin, this allows them to be highly dynamic in shape and size. The actin cytoskeleton directly determines the morphology of the spine, and actin regulators, small GTPases such as Rac, RhoA, and CDC42, rapidly modify this cytoskeleton. Overactive Rac1 results in consistently smaller dendritic spines.

In addition to their electrophysiological activity and their receptor-mediated activity, spines appear to be vesicularly active and may even translate proteins. Stacked discs of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SERs) have been identified in dendritic spines. Formation of this &quot;spine apparatus&quot; depends on the protein synaptopodin and is believed to play an important role in calcium handling. &quot;Smooth&quot; vesicles have also been identified in spines, supporting the vesicular activity in dendritic spines. The presence of polyribosomes in spines also suggests protein translational activity in the spine itself, not just in the dendrite.

== Morphogenesis ==
The morphogenesis of dendritic spines is critical to the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). The morphology of the spine depends on the states of actin, either in globular (G-actin) or filamentous (F-actin) forms. The role of Rho family of GTPases and its effects in the stability of actin and spine motility has important implications for memory. If the dendritic spine is the basic unit of information storage, then the spine&#x27;s ability to extend and retract spontaneously must be constrained. If not, information may be lost. Rho family of GTPases makes significant contributions to the process that stimulates actin polymerization, which in turn increases the size and shape of the spine. Large spines are more stable than smaller ones and may be resistant to modification by additional synaptic activity. Because changes in the shape and size of dendritic spines are correlated with the strength of excitatory synaptic connections and heavily depend on remodeling of its underlying actin cytoskeleton, the specific mechanisms of actin regulation, and therefore the Rho family of GTPases, are integral to the formation, maturation, and plasticity of dendritic spines and to learning and memory.

=== RhoA pathway ===
One of the major Rho GTPases involved in spine morphogenesis is RhoA, a protein that also modulates the regulation and timing of cell division. In the context of activity in neurons, RhoA is activated in the following manner: once calcium has entered a cell through NMDA receptors, it binds to calmodulin and activates CaMKII, which leads to the activation of RhoA. The activation of the RhoA protein will activate ROCK, a RhoA kinase, which leads to the stimulation of LIM kinase, which in turn inhibits the protein cofilin. Cofilin&#x27;s function is to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton of a cell; namely, it depolymerizes actin segments and thus inhibits the growth of growth cones and the repair of axons.

A study conducted by Murakoshi et al. in 2011 implicated the Rho GTPases RhoA and Cdc42 in dendritic spine morphogenesis. Both GTPases were quickly activated in single dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus during structural plasticity brought on by long-term potentiation stimuli. Concurrent RhoA and Cdc42 activation led to a transient increase in spine growth of up to 300% for five minutes, which decayed into a smaller but sustained growth for thirty minutes. The activation of RhoA diffused around the vicinity of the spine undergoing stimulation, and it was determined that RhoA is necessary for the transient phase and most likely the sustained phase as well of spine growth.

=== Cdc42 pathway ===
Cdc42 has been implicated in many different functions including dendritic growth, branching, and branch stability. Calcium influx into the cell through NMDA receptors binds to calmodulin and activates the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases II (CaMKII). In turn, CaMKII is activated and this activates Cdc42, after which no feedback signaling occurs upstream to calcium and CaMKII. If tagged with monomeric-enhanced green fluorescent protein, one can see that the activation of Cdc42 is limited to just the stimulated spine of a dendrite. This is because the molecule is continuously activated during plasticity and immediately inactivates after diffusing out of the spine. Despite its compartmentalized activity, Cdc42 is still mobile out of the stimulated spine, just like RhoA. Cdc42 activates PAK, which is a protein kinase that specifically phosphorylates and, therefore, inactivates ADF/cofilin. Inactivation of cofilin leads to increased actin polymerization and expansion of the spine&#x27;s volume. Activation of Cdc42 is required for this increase in spinal volume to be sustained.

=== Observed changes in structural plasticity ===

Murakoshi, Wang, and Yasuda (2011) examined the effects of Rho GTPase activation on the structural plasticity of single dendritic spines elucidating differences between the transient and sustained phases.

==== Transient changes in structural plasticity ====
Applying a low-frequency train of two-photon glutamate uncaging in a single dendritic spine can elicit rapid activation of both RhoA and Cdc42. During the next two minutes, the volume of the stimulated spine can expand to 300 percent of its original size. However, this change in spine morphology is only temporary; the volume of the spine decreases after five minutes. Administration of C3 transferase, a Rho inhibitor, or glycyl-H1152, a Rock inhibitor, inhibits the transient expansion of the spine, indicating that activation of the Rho-Rock pathway is required in some way for this process.

==== Sustained changes in structural plasticity ====

After the transient changes described above take place, the spine&#x27;s volume decreases until it is elevated by 70 to 80 percent of the original volume. This sustained change in structural plasticity will last about thirty minutes. Once again, administration of C3 transferase and Glycyl-H1152 suppressed this growth, suggesting that the Rho-Rock pathway is necessary for more persistent increases in spinal volume. In addition, administration of the Cdc42 binding domain of Wasp or inhibitor targeting Pak1 activation-3 (IPA3) decreases this sustained growth in volume, demonstrating that the Cdc42-Pak pathway is needed for this growth in spinal volume as well. This is important because sustained changes in structural plasticity may provide a mechanism for the encoding, maintenance, and retrieval of memories. The observations made may suggest that Rho GTPases are necessary for these processes.

==Physiology==
===Receptor activity===
Dendritic spines express glutamate receptors (e.g. AMPA receptor and NMDA receptor) on their surface. The TrkB receptor for BDNF is also expressed on the spine surface, and is believed to play a role in spine survival. The tip of the spine contains an electron-dense region referred to as the &quot;postsynaptic density&quot; (PSD). The PSD directly apposes the active zone of its synapsing axon and comprises ~10% of the spine&#x27;s membrane surface area; neurotransmitters released from the active zone bind receptors in the postsynaptic density of the spine. Half of the synapsing axons and dendritic spines are physically tethered by calcium-dependent cadherin, which forms cell-to-cell adherent junctions between two neurons.

Glutamate receptors (GluRs) are localized to the postsynaptic density, and are anchored by cytoskeletal elements to the membrane. They are positioned directly above their signalling machinery, which is typically tethered to the underside of the plasma membrane, allowing signals transmitted by the GluRs into the cytosol to be further propagated by their nearby signalling elements to activate signal transduction cascades. The localization of signalling elements to their GluRs is particularly important in ensuring signal cascade activation, as GluRs would be unable to affect particular downstream effects without nearby signallers.

Signalling from GluRs is mediated by the presence of an abundance of proteins, especially kinases, that are localized to the postsynaptic density. These include calcium-dependent calmodulin, CaMKII (calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II), PKC (Protein Kinase C), PKA (Protein Kinase A), Protein Phosphatase-1 (PP-1), and Fyn tyrosine kinase. Certain signallers, such as CaMKII, are upregulated in response to activity.

Spines are particularly advantageous to neurons by compartmentalizing biochemical signals. This can help to encode changes in the state of an individual synapse without necessarily affecting the state of other synapses of the same neuron. The length and width of the spine neck has a large effect on the degree of compartmentalization, with thin spines being the most biochemically isolated spines.

===Plasticity===

Dendritic spines are very &quot;plastic&quot;, that is, spines change significantly in shape, volume, and number in small time courses. Because spines have a primarily actin cytoskeleton, they are dynamic, and the majority of spines change their shape within seconds to minutes because of the dynamicity of actin remodeling. Furthermore, spine number is very variable and spines come and go; in a matter of hours, 10-20% of spines can spontaneously appear or disappear on the pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex, although the larger &quot;mushroom&quot;-shaped spines are the most stable.

Spine maintenance and plasticity is activity-dependent and activity-independent. BDNF partially determines spine levels, and low levels of AMPA receptor activity is necessary to maintain spine survival, and synaptic activity involving NMDA receptors encourages spine growth. Furthermore, two-photon laser scanning microscopy and confocal microscopy have shown that spine volume changes depending on the types of stimuli that are presented to a synapse.

===Importance to learning and memory===

====Evidence of importance====
Spine plasticity is implicated in motivation, learning, and memory. In particular, long-term memory is mediated in part by the growth of new dendritic spines (or the enlargement of pre-existing spines) to reinforce a particular neural pathway. Because dendritic spines are plastic structures whose lifespan is influenced by input activity, spine dynamics may play an important role in the maintenance of memory over a lifetime.

Age-dependent changes in the rate of spine turnover suggest that spine stability impacts developmental learning. In youth, dendritic spine turnover is relatively high and produces a net loss of spines. This high rate of spine turnover may characterize critical periods of development and reflect learning capacity in adolescence—different cortical areas exhibit differing levels of synaptic turnover during development, possibly reflecting varying critical periods for specific brain regions. In adulthood, however, most spines remain persistent, and the half-life of spines increases. This stabilization occurs due to a developmentally regulated slow-down of spine elimination, a process which may underlie the stabilization of memories in maturity.

Experience-induced changes in dendritic spine stability also point to spine turnover as a mechanism involved in the maintenance of long-term memories, though it is unclear how sensory experience affects neural circuitry. Two general models might describe the impact of experience on structural plasticity. On the one hand, experience and activity may drive the discrete formation of relevant synaptic connections that store meaningful information in order to allow for learning. On the other hand, synaptic connections may be formed in excess, and experience and activity may lead to the pruning of extraneous synaptic connections.

In lab animals of all ages, environmental enrichment has been related to dendritic branching, spine density, and overall number of synapses. In addition, skill training has been shown to lead to the formation and stabilization of new spines while destabilizing old spines, suggesting that the learning of a new skill involves a rewiring process of neural circuits. Since the extent of spine remodeling correlates with success of learning, this suggests a crucial role of synaptic structural plasticity in memory formation. In addition, changes in spine stability and strengthening occur rapidly and have been observed within hours after training.

Conversely, while enrichment and training are related to increases in spine formation and stability, long-term sensory deprivation leads to an increase in the rate of spine elimination and therefore impacts long-term neural circuitry. Upon restoring sensory experience after deprivation in adolescence, spine elimination is accelerated, suggesting that experience plays an important role in the net loss of spines during development. In addition, other sensory deprivation paradigms—such as whisker trimming—have been shown to increase the stability of new spines.

Research in neurological diseases and injuries shed further light on the nature and importance of spine turnover. After stroke, a marked increase in structural plasticity occurs near the trauma site, and a five- to eightfold increase from control rates in spine turnover has been observed. Dendrites disintegrate and reassemble rapidly during ischemia—as with stroke, survivors showed an increase in dendritic spine turnover. While a net loss of spines is observed in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and cases of intellectual disability, cocaine and amphetamine use have been linked to increases in dendritic branching and spine density in the prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens. Because significant changes in spine density occur in various brain and spinal cord diseases, this suggests a balanced state of spine dynamics in normal circumstances, which may be susceptible to disequilibrium under varying pathological conditions.

There is also some evidence for loss of dendritic spines as a consequence of aging. One study using mice has noted a correlation between age-related reductions in spine densities in the hippocampus and age-dependent declines in hippocampal learning and memory. Emerging evidence has also shown dendritic spine abnormalities in the pain processing regions of the spinal cord nociceptive system, including superficial and intermediate zones of the dorsal horn.

Overall, the evidence suggests that dendritic spines are crucial for normal brain and spinal cord function. Alterations in spine morphology may not only influence synaptic plasticity and information processing but also have a key role in many neurological diseases. Furthermore, even subtle changes in dendritic spine densities or sizes can affect neuronal network properties, which could lead to cognitive or mood alterations, impaired learning and memory, as well as pain hypersensitivity. Moreover, the findings suggest that maintaining spine health through therapies such as exercise, cognitive stimulation and lifestyle modifications may be helpful in preserving neuronal plasticity and improving neurological symptoms.

====Importance contested====
Despite experimental findings that suggest a role for dendritic spine dynamics in mediating learning and memory, the degree of structural plasticity&#x27;s importance remains debatable. For instance, studies estimate that only a small portion of spines formed during training actually contribute to lifelong learning. In addition, the formation of new spines may not significantly contribute to the connectivity of the brain, and spine formation may not bear as much of an influence on memory retention as other properties of structural plasticity, such as the increase in size of spine heads.

==Modeling==
Theoreticians have for decades hypothesized about the potential electrical function of spines, yet our inability to examine their electrical properties has until recently stopped theoretical work from progressing too far. Recent advances in imaging techniques along with increased use of two-photon glutamate uncaging have led to a wealth of new discoveries; we now suspect that there are voltage-dependent sodium, potassium, and calcium channels in the spine heads.

Cable theory provides the theoretical framework behind the most &quot;simple&quot; method for modelling the flow of electrical currents along passive neural fibres. Each spine can be treated as two compartments, one representing the neck, the other representing the spine head. The compartment representing the spine head alone should carry the active properties.

===Baer and Rinzel&#x27;s continuum model===
To facilitate the analysis of interactions between many spines, Baer &amp; Rinzel formulated a new cable theory for which the distribution of spines is treated as a continuum. In this representation, spine head voltage is the local spatial average of membrane potential in adjacent spines. The formulation maintains the feature that there is no direct electrical coupling between neighboring spines; voltage spread along dendrites is the only way for spines to interact.

===Spike-diffuse-spike model===
The SDS model was intended as a computationally simple version of the full Baer and Rinzel model. It was designed to be analytically tractable and have as few free parameters as possible while retaining those of greatest significance, such as spine neck resistance. The model drops the continuum approximation and instead uses a passive dendrite coupled to excitable spines at discrete points. Membrane dynamics in the spines are modelled using integrate and fire processes. The spike events are modelled in a discrete fashion with the wave form conventionally represented as a rectangular function.

===Modeling spine calcium transients===
Calcium transients in spines are a key trigger for synaptic plasticity. NMDA receptors, which have a high permeability for calcium, only conduct ions if the membrane potential is sufficiently depolarized. The amount of calcium entering a spine during synaptic activity therefore depends on the depolarization of the spine head. Evidence from calcium imaging experiments (two-photon microscopy) and from compartmental modelling indicates that spines with high resistance necks experience larger calcium transients during synaptic activity.

==Development==
Dendritic spines can develop directly from dendritic shafts or from dendritic filopodia. During synaptogenesis, dendrites rapidly sprout and retract filopodia, small membrane organelle-lacking membranous protrusions. Recently, I-BAR protein MIM was found to contribute to the initiation process. During the first week of birth, the brain is predominated by filopodia, which eventually develop synapses. However, after this first week, filopodia are replaced by spiny dendrites but also small, stubby spines that protrude from spiny dendrites. In the development of certain filopodia into spines, filopodia recruit presynaptic contact to the dendrite, which encourages the production of spines to handle specialized postsynaptic contact with the presynaptic protrusions.

Spines, however, require maturation after formation. Immature spines have impaired signaling capabilities, and typically lack &quot;heads&quot; (or have very small heads), only necks, while matured spines maintain both heads and necks.

==Clinical significance==
Emerging research has indicate abnormalities in spine density in anxiety disorders.

Cognitive disorders such as ADHD, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, autism, intellectual disability, and fragile X syndrome, may be resultant from abnormalities in dendritic spines, especially the number of spines and their maturity. The ratio of matured to immature spines is important in their signaling, as immature spines have impaired synaptic signaling. Fragile X syndrome is characterized by an overabundance of immature spines that have multiple filopodia in cortical dendrites.

==History==
Dendritic spines were first described at the end of the 19th century by Santiago Ramón y Cajal on cerebellar neurons. Ramón y Cajal then proposed that dendritic spines could serve as contacting sites between neurons. This was demonstrated more than 50 years later thanks to the emergence of electron microscopy. Until the development of confocal microscopy on living tissues, it was commonly admitted that spines were formed during embryonic development and then would remain stable after birth. In this paradigm, variations of synaptic weight were considered as sufficient to explain memory processes at the cellular level. But since about a decade ago, new techniques of confocal microscopy demonstrated that dendritic spines are indeed motile and dynamic structures that undergo a constant turnover, even after birth.

<doc id="343170" wikidata="Q714909" url="?curid=343170" title="Pete Wilson">
<text>Peter Barton Wilson (born August 23, 1933) is an American attorney and politician who served as a United States senator from California from 1983 to 1991 and as the 36th governor of California from 1991 to 1999. A member of the Republican Party, he also served as the 29th mayor of San Diego from 1971 to 1983.

Born in Lake Forest, Illinois, Wilson graduated from the UC Berkeley School of Law after serving in the United States Marine Corps. He established a legal practice in San Diego and campaigned for Republicans such as Richard Nixon and Barry Goldwater. Wilson won election to the California State Assembly in 1966 and became the mayor of San Diego in 1971. He held that office until 1983, when he became a member of the United States Senate. In 1982, he defeated then-incumbent Governor Jerry Brown to become the United States senator from California. In the Senate, Wilson supported the Strategic Defense Initiative and the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, while he opposed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.

Wilson resigned from the Senate after winning the 1990 California gubernatorial election. As governor, Wilson signed a three-strikes law and supported energy deregulation and term limits. He was also an advocate for California Proposition 187, which established a state-run citizenship screening system with the intention of preventing illegal immigrants from using social services. Wilson won reelection in the 1994 gubernatorial election. He sought the Republican nomination in the 1996 United States presidential election but dropped out of the race before the primaries began.

Wilson retired from public office after serving two terms as governor. Since leaving office, he has worked for several businesses and has been affiliated with several other organizations. He is a distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution. As of to date, Wilson&#x27;s 1988 re-election is the last time Republicans won a Senate election in California.

==Early life==
Peter Barton Wilson was born on August 23, 1933, in Lake Forest, Illinois, a suburb north of Chicago, at the height of the Great Depression. His parents were James Boone Wilson and Margaret (Callaghan) Wilson. His father sold college fraternity jewelry to work his way through University of Illinois, and later became a successful advertising executive. The Wilson family settled in St. Louis, Missouri, when Pete was in elementary school. He then attended the private, non-sectarian preparatory middle school John Burroughs (grades 7–9) in Ladue, and then St. Louis Country Day School, an exclusive private high school, where he won an award in his senior year for combined scholarship, athletics, and citizenship. In the fall of 1951, Pete Wilson enrolled at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where he received a United States Navy Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) scholarship, majored in English, and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree. In his junior year he elected to join the Marine Corps upon his graduation.

After graduating from Yale, Wilson served for three years in the United States Marine Corps as an infantry officer, eventually becoming a platoon commander. Upon completion of his Marine Corps service, Wilson earned a Juris Doctor degree from the University of California, Berkeley School of Law in June 1962.

In 1962, while working as an Advance Man for the Republican gubernatorial candidate Richard M. Nixon, Wilson got to know Herb Klein, one of Nixon&#x27;s top aides. Klein suggested that Wilson might do well in Southern California politics, so in 1963, Wilson moved to San Diego.

After passing the bar exam on his fourth attempt, Wilson began his practice as a criminal defense attorney in San Diego, but he found such work to be low-paying and personally repugnant. He later commented to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;I realized I couldn&#x27;t be a criminal defense lawyer – because most of the people who do come to you are guilty.&quot; Wilson switched to a more conventional law practice and continued his activity in local politics, working for Barry Goldwater&#x27;s unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1964. Wilson&#x27;s liking for politics and managing the day-to-day details of the political process was growing. He put in long hours for the Goldwater campaign, earning the friendship of local Republican boosters so necessary for a political career, and in 1966, at the age of thirty-three, he ran for, and won a seat in the California State Assembly, succeeding Clair Burgener.

Wilson was re-elected to the Assembly in 1968 and 1970, and in 1971 was elected mayor of San Diego.

==Mayor of San Diego==
Wilson served three terms as mayor of San Diego, from 1971 to 1983, winning election by a 2:1 margin each time. During his three terms he restructured the San Diego City Council, reorganized the planning and civil service commissions, instituted campaign finance reform, and promoted the redevelopment of downtown San Diego. He also helped to keep Major League Baseball&#x27;s San Diego Padres in the city, helping to persuade local millionaire Ray Kroc to buy the team.

The 1972 Republican National Convention had been scheduled to take place in San Diego in August 1972. However, in May 1972 the Republican National Committee voted to move the convention to Miami because of a scandal involving a donation to the event by ITT Corporation, as well as concerns about the proposed venue (the San Diego Sports Arena) and the adequacy of hotel space. Wilson proclaimed the week of the convention to be America&#x27;s Finest City Week, which became an annual event and gave rise to San Diego&#x27;s unofficial nickname.

In 1972, Wilson recruited Clarence M. Pendleton Jr. to head the Model Cities Program in San Diego. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan appointed Pendleton to chair the United States Commission on Civil Rights, a position that he held from 1981 until his death in San Diego in 1988.

==United States Senator from California (1983–1991)==
In 1982, Wilson won the Republican primary in California to replace the retiring U.S. Senator S. I. Hayakawa. Wilson&#x27;s Democratic opponent was the outgoing two-term Governor Jerry Brown. Wilson was known as a fiscal conservative who supported the property-tax limiting Proposition 13, although Wilson had opposed the measure while mayor of San Diego. However, Brown ran on his gubernatorial record of building the largest state budget surpluses in California history. Both Wilson and Brown were moderate-to-liberal on social issues, including support for abortion rights and environmentalism. The election was expected to be close, with Brown holding a slim lead in most of the polls leading up to Election Day. Wilson hammered away at Brown&#x27;s appointment of California Chief Justice Rose Bird, using this to portray himself as tougher on crime than Brown was. Brown&#x27;s late entry into the 1980 Democratic presidential primary, after promising not to run, was also an issue. President Ronald Reagan made a number of visits to California late in the race to campaign for Wilson. Reagan quipped that the last thing he wanted to see was both of his home state&#x27;s U.S. Senate seats falling into Democrats&#x27; hands, especially to be occupied by the man who succeeded him as governor. Despite exit polls indicating a narrow Brown victory, Wilson edged him out to win the election. A major contributing factor may also have been a late influx of the Armenian vote in the California Governor&#x27;s race between George Deukmejian and Tom Bradley. Many of these votes came from heavily Republican areas. The Deukmejian voters likely also voted for Wilson for United States Senator.
On October 19, 1983, Wilson voted in favor of a bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The legislation was signed into law by President Reagan the following month. In January 1988, Wilson voted in favor of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override President Reagan&#x27;s veto in March).

In June 1984, Wilson voted in favor of legislation restricting federal highway funds for states that did not raise the minimum age for drinking to 21.

In May 1985, Wilson underwent surgery for a ruptured appendix at Bethesda Naval Hospital, concurrently as fellow Republican Senator Bob Dole hoped to gather enough votes for the Reagan administration&#x27;s 1986 budget. The surgery was expected to keep Wilson hospitalized for days, but Wilson returned to Capitol Hill via an ambulance to cast a vote in favor of the budget on May 10. After voting, Wilson stated he made the decision to forgo further bed rest as he believed the vote was possibly the most important of his career.

Convinced by Japanese-American farmers in the Central Valley to support redress, Wilson co-sponsored the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. The bill was signed into law by President Reagan.

As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he called for early implementation of President Reagan&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative, a national ballistic missile defense system.

Wilson also co-sponsored the Federal Intergovernmental Regulatory Relief Act requiring the federal government to reimburse states for the cost of new federal mandates. A fiscal conservative, he was named the Senate&#x27;s &quot;Watchdog of the Treasury&quot; for each of his eight years in the nation&#x27;s capital.

In 1988, Wilson won the race for the United States Senate against his Democratic opponent, Leo T. McCarthy. In that election, he became the first person to get more than 5 million votes in a single Senate race, and his 5.1 million votes was a record for the most won by a Republican candidate for Senator that wasn&#x27;t broken until 2020, when John Cornyn of Texas topped it.

On January 20, 1989, he presided over the inauguration of George H. W. Bush as President of the United States. He voted against Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Bush&#x27;s tax increase, thus remaining a fiscal conservative.

In the weeks following incumbent governor of California George Deukmejian announcing that he was not running for a third term, Wilson considered a gubernatorial bid; by late January 1989, Wilson admitted to the decision being agonizing for him amid his consulting with others on a possible run. At the beginning of his second six-year term in the Senate, Wilson announced plans to run for Governor of California.

On October 2, 1990, Wilson, away from Washington to campaign for California governor, became the only sitting senator from either party to not vote on the nomination of David Souter for Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court. He had previously endorsed Souter for confirmation. Wilson voted in favor of the Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination.

On January 7, 1991, he resigned from the Senate upon his inauguration as California&#x27;s governor and appointed John Seymour as his successor.

==Governor of California==

Wilson won the Republican nomination for Governor of California to succeed two-term Republican governor George Deukmejian, who chose not to seek a third term in 1990. In the general election, he defeated Democratic former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who would go on to be elected to Wilson&#x27;s former U.S. Senate seat two years later. Wilson was sworn in as governor on January 7, 1991.

As governor, Wilson oversaw economic recovery in California, just as the rest of the country was recovering from an economic slump. Inheriting the state&#x27;s worst economy since the Great Depression, Wilson insisted on strict budget discipline and sought to rehabilitate the state&#x27;s environment for investment and new job creation. During his term, market-based, unsubsidized health coverage was made available for employees of small businesses.

Despite his belief in fiscal conservatism, Wilson raised the sales tax to reduce the state deficit, including imposing a new sales tax on newspapers and a sales tax on &quot;snack&quot; foods. He also raised car license fees and college tuition; by 1991, tuition fees at the University of California rose by 40%, while they rose by 24% at California State University. Additionally, he raised the income tax in the top bracket temporarily. However, by 1993, the snack tax was repealed by the Democratic state legislature and the sales tax increase expired. On April 26, 1991, Wilson proposed an increase in sales tax by 1 1/4 cents and state taxes by $6.7 billion (equivalent to $ in ) as part of plan to reduce the state&#x27;s budget deficit. The revenue gap had increased by $5 billion (equivalent to $ in ) in the four months of his governorship. In response to the April 1991 proposal, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote of Wilson,

In July 1991, the Senate voted 28 to 9 in favor of a bipartisan tax plan that would have increased taxes on the wealthiest Californians, boosted the corporate tax rate, and imposed a tax increase on telecommunication services by 2%. Wilson returned the budget bill to the legislature without his signature, revoking a prior commitment to vetoing the measure.

On July 12, 1991, Wilson signed a bill mandating that parents neglecting paying for child support could warrant stiff fines and potential suspensions of business and professional licenses. The legislation was intended to address a rising cause of poverty among children and women in the state at a time when Californians collectively owed $2 billion (equivalent to $ in ) per year in unpaid child support. On July 24, 1991, Wilson signed a bill requiring mass transit rail lines to be built underground in the event construction take place in the residential neighborhoods of North Hollywood and Van Nuys. The bill, requested by the residents of those neighborhoods, was aimed at easing &quot;homeowners&#x27; fear of noise from ground-level trains running along a proposed rail route that parallels Chandler and Victory boulevards&quot;.

Less than a year into his first term as governor, Wilson vetoed AB 101, a bill written to prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation in the state. Wilson feared that the bill would increase lawsuits and make California less competitive economically. The veto was met with protests in San Francisco that included demonstrations during Wilson&#x27;s subsequent public appearances and speeches. Wilson was the driving force behind the 1996 legislation that deregulated the state&#x27;s energy market, which was the first energy utilities deregulation in the U.S. and aggressively pushed by companies such as Enron.

Wilson also enacted education reforms aimed at creating statewide curriculum standards, reducing class size and replacing social promotion with early remedial education. Wilson promoted standardized testing of all students, increased teacher training, and a longer school year. However, it was Wilson&#x27;s uncompromising stance on reducing education spending that led to the budget impasse of 1992, leaving state workers without paychecks from July until September, when the California Supreme Court forced the Governor and the legislature to agree to terms that ended the sixty-three-day stand-off. On February 22, 1993, Wilson issued an executive order banning smoke in a majority of state buildings barring &quot;buildings controlled by the courts, the Legislature or the state&#x27;s two university systems&quot;. The order was set to take effect December 31. Wilson said secondhand smoke &quot;threatens the health of non-smoking state employees&quot; and charged workplace smoking with increasing the cost of cleaning, damaged furniture and carpets, and heightening the chances of starting fires.

Despite this, in a leaked Philip Morris memo, the company&#x27;s chief executive, Hamish Maxwell, said, &quot;You will be pleased to know that Pete is still &#x27;pro-tobacco.&#x27;&quot; His move to revoke Proposition 99, a $114 million dollar voter-approved bill to tax cigarette companies to research and educate on the effects of tobacco, as well as shut down a highly effective anti-tobacco ad with footage of tobacco executives testifying to Congress that nicotine was not addictive (which also a prompted defamation lawsuit against it), was claimed to be illegal and caused multiple lawsuits, and was criticized as being influenced by the tobacco lobby. While he claimed to take no funding personally in response to allegations of being pro-tobacco, he collected over $100,000 from a New York fund-raising dinner organized by Phillip Morris. While Phillip Morris didn&#x27;t directly fund his campaign, they were major funders of the California Republican Party which he led. The leaked memo was in response to worries over Wilson&#x27;s rejection of direct campaign donations. Maxwell claimed to have been told by Wilson over a phone call that this was to &quot;protect Hamish and himself,&quot; assuring that it was not due to a lack of support.

In late 1993, Wilson traveled to Asia to endorse Californian goods and investment opportunities abroad. Wilson&#x27;s six-day tour was also marked by his insistence on creating export-oriented jobs. Wilson was re-elected to a second gubernatorial term in 1994, gaining 55% of the vote in his race against Democratic State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, daughter of former California Governor Pat Brown. According to one study, Wilson exploited anti-immigrant sentiment to win re-election. Wilson spoke at the funeral services for former First Lady Pat Nixon in 1993 and former President Richard M. Nixon in 1994 at the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, California. Two years later, Wilson became, to date, the most recent governor to speak at a California gubernatorial funeral, that of former Governor Pat Brown.

For most of his time as governor, Wilson reduced per-capita infrastructure spending for California, much as he had done as the mayor of San Diego. Many construction projects – most notably highway expansion/improvement projects – were severely hindered or delayed, while other maintenance and construction projects were abandoned completely. Term limit laws passed by voters as Proposition 140, and championed by Wilson in 1990, prohibited Wilson from running for re-election to a third term. At the end of his time in office, Wilson left California with a $16 billion budget surplus (equivalent to $ in ). He was succeeded by then-lieutenant governor Gray Davis as governor. A September 1998 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; poll found 55% of registered voters in California favored Wilson&#x27;s job performance.

===Welfare===
On December 14, 1991, in an address to Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, Wilson criticized the Democratic leaders of the state legislature for their opposition to his budget-balancing plan and &quot;spent most of his hour at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles railing against the state&#x27;s entitlement programs – including education and Medi-Cal, but especially Aid to Families with Dependent Children and other welfare programs&quot;. On January 8, 1993, Wilson submitted the 1993 spending plan, advocating an immediate cut in welfare grants by 4.2% that would be followed 6 months later by a larger reduction of 15% that would be directed at recipient families with an able-bodied adult. The twin cuts would reduce California&#x27;s standing as the 5th highest benefit granting state to the 12fth.

By the end of his first term, Wilson allied with members of the state legislature that supported the continuation of recession-inspired cuts to welfare benefits. A bill imposing the continued reduction of benefits was passed by 2 committees of the Republican-majority assembly. H. D. Palmer maintained Wilson&#x27;s priorities rested in other issues and though admitting to an improving in revenues, disclosed that &quot;the governor does not believe that the first call on those revenues should go to double-digit cost-of-living increases for welfare recipients.&quot;

Wilson&#x27;s second inaugural address featured a proclamation that the administration would usher in welfare reform:

In his 1997 State of the State address, Wilson criticized welfare recipients and charged the program with creating conditions producing out-of-wedlock births, the lack of paternal involvement in the lives of children, and the lifelong ramifications to children caused by the father not being of presence. Under Wilson&#x27;s welfare overhaul package, mothers would have to go to work after two years and a year would pass before they could return to welfare, which would only have a five-year lifetime. Paternity for each child would also have to be established for the mother to begin receiving benefits.

===Proposition 187===

As governor, Wilson was closely associated with California Proposition 187, a 1994 ballot initiative to establish a state-run citizenship screening system and prohibit illegal immigrants from using health care, public education, and other social services in the U.S. State of California. Voters passed the proposed law as a referendum in November 1994; it was the first time that a state had passed legislation related to immigration, customarily an issue for federal policies and programs. The law was challenged in a legal suit and found unconstitutional by a federal court in 1998 and never went into effect.

Passage of Proposition 187 reflected state residents&#x27; concerns about illegal immigration into the United States and the large Hispanic population in California. Opponents believed the law was discriminatory against immigrants of Hispanic origin; supporters generally insisted that their concerns were economic: that the state could not afford to provide social services for so many who entered the state illegally or overstayed their visas. Wilson himself would state that the policy was &quot;about supporting the people who came here the right way&quot;.

Opponents of Proposition 187 cited its passage as the cause of long-term negative effects for the California Republican Party statewide. Noting a rapid increase in the Latino participation in California elections, some analysts cite Wilson and the Republican Party&#x27;s embrace of Proposition 187 as a cause of the failure of the party to win statewide elections. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is the only Republican to win a California gubernatorial, senatorial, or presidential election since 1994, in a unique 2003 recall election and then a re-election in 2006.

Since 1995 the following states have had similar ballot initiatives or laws passed: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma and Texas.

===Policies on crime===
Wilson led efforts to enact &quot;tough on crime&quot; measures and signed into law the &quot;Three Strikes&quot; (25 years to life for repeat offenders) As a result of the Three Strikes Law, 4,431 offenders have been sentenced to 25 years to life for strings of crime. The law required the construction of new prisons, leading some to question the role in his stance of the California Correctional Peace Officers Association, a lobbying group of prison guards that gave $1.47 million (equivalent to $ in ) to Wilson&#x27;s gubernatorial campaigns. On September 26, 1995, Wilson signed a bill authorizing the possible use of the death penalty toward any individual who committed a murder amid a carjacking or killed a juror. Wilson said the law was the result of 4 years&#x27; worth of attempts on his part to toughen the laws against carjacking: &quot;This bill sends an unmistakable message to gang bangers: If you take someone&#x27;s life while committing a cowardly carjacking, you can expect to pay for your crime with your own life.&quot; Wilson also supported resuming the death penalty in California, after a 25-year moratorium, and he signed the death warrant for the execution of child-murderer Robert Alton Harris. Harris was executed in 1992. A total of five people were executed during his administration (the first 2 in the gas chamber, the latter 3 by lethal injection).

==Energy deregulation==
Wilson supported deregulation of the energy industry in California during his administration due to heavy lobbying efforts by Enron. Nevertheless, during the California energy crisis caused by companies such as Enron, Wilson authored an article titled &quot;What California Must Do&quot; that blamed Gray Davis for not building enough power plants. Wilson defended his record of power plant construction and claimed that between 1985 and 1998, 23 plants were certified and 18 were built in California.

==1996 presidential campaign==

Despite a campaign promise to the people of California not to do so, Wilson also unsuccessfully ran for the Republican nomination for President in the 1996 election, making formal announcements on both coasts. Wilson announced first on August 28, 1995, in New York City, at Battery Park, with the Statue of Liberty as a backdrop. He completed a cross-country tour. In April of 1995, he had surgery to remove a benign nodule on his vocal cords. When Wilson did not lighten his speaking schedule, it resulted in the occasional cracking of his voice. It ended up keeping him from announcing – or even talking – for months. His campaign ended on September 30, 1995
A September 6, 1995, UC Irvine poll showed equal support for Wilson and incumbent President Bill Clinton among Orange County voters. The same poll indicated Wilson as trailing his former Senate colleague Bob Dole by a 20-point margin. Dole would become the Republican nominee in the general election. Later that month, a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; poll found 23% of Californians believed Wilson should seek the presidency, including 30% of state voters identifying as Republican. On September 29, 1995, Wilson told supporters in Sacramento that he was dropping out of the Republican primary, citing he lacked the &quot;necessary campaign funds to take this message to the people who need to hear it&quot;. He became the first candidate to exit the Republican primary.

==Post-political careers and commemoration==

After leaving office, Wilson spent 2 years as a managing director of Pacific Capital Group, a merchant bank based in Los Angeles. He has served as a director of the Irvine Company, TelePacific Communications, Inc., National Information Consortium Inc., an advisor to Crossflo Systems, and IDT Entertainment. He has been a member of the Board of Advisors of Thomas Weisel Partners, a San Francisco merchant bank. He also served as chairman of the Japan Task Force of the Pacific Council on International Policy, which produced an analysis of Japanese economic and national security prospects over the next decade entitled &quot;Can Japan Come Back?&quot;

Wilson is currently a distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank located on the campus of Stanford University, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, the Richard Nixon Foundation, the Donald Bren Foundation, is the founding director of the California Mentor Foundation and is the chairman of the board of trustees of the National World War II Museum. Wilson sits on two prestigious Federal advisory committees, the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee. He previously worked as a consultant at the Los Angeles office of Bingham McCutchen LLP, a large, national law firm. He is currently Of Counsel with Ellis George Cipollone O&#x27;Brien Annaguey LLP d/b/a Ellis George Cipollone, a bicoastal trial boutique law firm. He is also a Principal at Wilson Walsh Consulting.

<text>The M23 is a motorway in the United Kingdom, running from the south of Hooley in Surrey, where it splits from the A23, to Pease Pottage, south of Crawley in West Sussex where it rejoins the A23. 

The northern end of the motorway starts on what is effectively a spur north of junction 7 of the M25 motorway (junction 8 on the M23). From Hooley it runs for past Redhill, Gatwick Airport and Crawley. A spur runs from junction 9 to Gatwick Airport.

The motorway was constructed between 1972 and 1975, at the same time as the southern section of the M25 from Godstone to Reigate (M25 junctions 6 to 8). The current northern terminus at junction 7 uses the original sliproads to meet the A23 and a flyover above the junction built for the onward northern continuation remains unused.

The cancellation of the unbuilt northern section from the M25 in towards Central London has resulted in the A23 carrying the majority of traffic through South London to the motorway. This is largely a single carriageway route, with many level junctions, traffic lights and awkward interchanges. It travels largely through residential areas and is inadequate for the level of traffic it carries.

A new junction (J10a) was opened in 1997, between J10 and J11, for access to the new Crawley neighbourhood of Maidenbower. It was financed as part of the development of Maidenbower by the construction consortium. It has only a northbound slip road, no southbound access.
==Unbuilt sections==

The M23 was planned to relieve congestion on the A23 through Streatham, Thornton Heath, Purley and Coulsdon in south London and was originally intended to terminate in Streatham Vale at a junction with the controversial London Ringways Plan&#x27;s Ringway 2 (the intended replacement of the South Circular Road (A205)).

In an earlier version of the Ringways Plan it would have continued into central London where it would have met the Balham Loop spur from Ringway 1 (the London Motorway Box) at Tooting. This was dropped in 1967 when the northern terminus was changed to Ringway 2. While a definite route had not been chosen at that time for the northern section, approval was met for the route south of the Greater London boundary at Hooley.

By 1972 the southern section of Ringway 2 had been dropped from the plan, with an alternative proposal that the M23 continue further into London to end on Ringway 1. This was immediately countered in the same year by the GLC, who announced they would not be building that Ringway, which meant that had the M23 continued north into inner London it would not have had the motorway required at its northern end to distribute traffic to the east and west. The M23 plan was gradually scaled back further to omit the section across Mitcham Common and end the motorway at an unsuitable location on Croydon Road (A232) before the plan was postponed indefinitely. By the late 1970s, the area along the proposed line of the motorway had become affected by blight, and while the proposals were finally dropped in the mid-1980s, much of the land reserved for the route was not released by the Department for Transport until the mid-1990s.

The missing section of motorway and the missing six junctions north of Hooley were not constructed due to the refusal of the GLC to finance the project, having encountered large scale opposition to the construction of Ringways elsewhere in London. However, the scale of the four-tier junction between the M23 and the M25, one of only three stack interchanges in the UK, is indicative of the importance attached to the M23 at that time.

== Smart motorway ==

Between July 2018 and July 2020 works took place to upgrade the M23 between junctions 8 and 10 to an all-lane-running motorway. The upgrades took place mostly for more reliable journeys to Gatwick Airport and increase the overall capacity of the route. The upgrades include an all-lane-running motorway, 12 new emergency areas, a new concrete central barrier replacing the current steel one, new roadside sound barriers, variable speed limits and two new emergency access slip roads. Changes were also implemented on the M23 junction 9 spur, with the hard shoulder west bound converted to a running lane, and static speed limits implemented in both directions.

In January 2020 all smart motorway projects were put under review due to concerns about their safety, during this period no new smart motorways could open. The review was published on 12 March 2020 and required no immediate amendments to the design or construction, however new technology to detect static vehicles is required to be fitted within three years, and a review on spacing of emergency refuge areas was to be carried out.

The fourth lane was opened to traffic on 2 April 2020, however with a temporary 50 mph speed limit. Works were scheduled to take place until July 2020 to finish installation of equipment, followed by testing and commissioning, before the project is completed and can run at the national speed limit.

<text>Frederick John Westcott (26 March 1865 – 17 September 1941), best known by his stage name Fred Karno, was an English theatre impresario of the British music hall. As a comedian of slapstick he is credited with popularising the custard-pie-in-the-face gag. During the 1890s, in order to circumvent stage censorship, Karno developed a form of sketch comedy without dialogue.

Cheeky authority-defying sketches such as &quot;Jail Birds&quot; (1895) in which prisoners play tricks on warders and &quot;Early Birds&quot; (1899), showing the poverty and realities for the poor of London&#x27;s East End, can be seen as precursors of movie silent comedy. His innovative 1904 sketch &quot;Mumming Birds&quot;, produced for the Hackney Empire in London, became the longest-running sketch the music halls produced. Many of his comics subsequently worked in film and used Karno material throughout their work. Film producer Hal Roach stated: &quot;Fred Karno is not only a genius, he is the man who originated slapstick comedy. We in Hollywood owe much to him.&quot;

Among the music hall comedians who worked for him were Charlie Chaplin and his understudy, Arthur Stanley Jefferson, who later adopted the name of Stan Laurel. These were alumni of his comedy companies all of whom trained at his headquarters, The Fun Factory, in Vaughan Road, Camberwell, southeast London. Such was Karno&#x27;s fame that his name became associated with any chaotic situation, and the disorganised volunteer soldiers of the Great War labelled themselves &quot;Fred Karno&#x27;s Army&quot;. The phrase was also adapted into a trench song in World War I, to the tune of the hymn &quot;The Church&#x27;s One Foundation&quot;. In World War II it was adapted as the Anthem of the Guinea Pig Club, the first line becoming &quot;We are McIndoe&#x27;s Army ...&quot;. The song also features in the musical comedy film &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; (1969).

==Biography==

Karno was born in Exeter, Devon, England, in 1866. His father was a cabinet maker, although Karno&#x27;s first career was as a plumber&#x27;s apprentice. A chance encounter at a gymnasium led to Karno taking up acrobatics, and around 1882 Karno joined forces with an older performer called Olvene, and ran away with the circus. He subsequently worked as a solo acrobat and as part of a troupe called The Four Aubreys. Whilst with the Aubreys he met Edith Cuthbert who worked in the box office at Stockport Theatre Royal. They married in 1889. In 1891 his son, Fred Karno Jr. (born Frederick Arthur Westcott) was born. As a young man he had busked at Molesey near Tagg&#x27;s Island on London&#x27;s River Thames and in 1912 he leased the island and the existing hotel. He demolished the original hotel and hired architect Frank Matcham to build The Karsino. With the advent of cinema, the music hall&#x27;s popularity declined and as a result of this decline, Karno went bankrupt in 1927.

On 27 May 1927, his wife Edith, from whom he had been separated since 1904, died in her sleep of diabetes. Karno then was able to marry his long-time partner, Marie Moore. Karno went to the US in September 1929, and was hired by the Hal Roach Studios as a writer-director, thanks to the support of one of his former protégés, Stan Laurel. However, his stay at the studio was brief and unsuccessful. Hal Roach later said that Karno&#x27;s main abilities were as a producer, although in reality Karno appears to have been the victim of cost cutting at the studio following the Wall Street crash of 1929. He left the studio in February 1930 and returned to England later that spring. On his return to Britain, he launched a show called &quot;Laffs&quot; which was later licensed by George Black as the basis of shows for the newly formed Crazy Gang. He later helped to write and produce several short films, some of which starred members of the Gang. In 1932 he returned to the theatre with a show called &quot;Real Life&quot;.

Karno spent his last years in southwest England in the village of Lilliput, Dorset, as a part-owner of an off-licence, and died there in 1941 from diabetes, aged 75.

==Legacy==

As a music hall impresario, Karno was hugely influential on comedy – not least in recruiting and training a generation of comics who went on to fame and fortune in their own right, notably: Stan Laurel, Charlie Chaplin, Will Hay, Fred Kitchen, Syd Walker, Sydney Chaplin, Eric Campbell, Sandy Powell, Max Miller, Frank Randle, Billie Ritchie, Billy Bennett, Walter Groves, Billy Reeves, Jimmy Nervo, of Nervo and Knox, and many more. These comedians were the backbone of British variety throughout the first half of the 20th century, and many were recruited by fledgling studios in Hollywood as the cream of physical slapstick comedy. 

Karno was also an innovator: he choreographed mime shows for his own troupe, Karno&#x27;s Komics, and brought slapstick circus comedy to the music hall which included his 1904 sketch &quot;Mumming Birds&quot;, featuring a number of new innovations including the pie in the face gag; its success saw it become the longest-running sketch the music halls produced. He also developed possibly the first use of the revolve in Britain, brought together troupes of comics and in so doing developed sketch comedy; he was instrumental in establishing copyright protections for stage productions against the threat from film; and was a pioneer of adding musical accompaniment to stage slapstick. In his autobiography Stan Laurel wrote, &quot;Fred Karno didn&#x27;t teach Charlie [Chaplin] and me all we know about comedy. He just taught us most of it&quot;.

Calling Karno &quot;a master of publicity&quot;, Samantha Ellis in &quot;The Guardian&quot; writes that &quot;one of his favourite tricks was to drive a red Rolls-Royce scattering flyers as he went&quot;. Karno&#x27;s reputation and legacy was significantly tarnished by a salacious biography: &quot;Master of Mirth and Tears&quot; (1971) by J. P. Gallagher, but this text has now been largely discredited by the 2021 biography by David B Crump: &quot;Fred Karno, the Legend Behind the Laughter&quot;.

The American writer Trav S.D., author of &quot;No Applause, Just Throw Money: The Book That Made Vaudeville Famous,&quot; has proclaimed Crump&#x27;s biography as &quot;definitive, full of original primary research and then digested and turned into perceptive and entertaining prose&quot;, adding &quot;there is a tendency to restrict Karno mentally to the British music hall in which he was so central, and to associate him almost entirely with his two best known creative progeny (Chaplin and Laurel). But that doesn&#x27;t do him enough justice. Given the minor fact that between them Chaplin and Laurel largely wrote the rules for screen comedy, it might be well to think of Karno as a Socrates to their Aristotle and Xenophon. In that respect, he has hands over all of 20th century culture. Crump&#x27;s strongly worded formulation is the one we should all now go by, calling Karno &quot;the most significant exponent of sketch comedy and physical slapstick the stage has ever seen&quot;. 
Karno&#x27;s houseboat, the &quot;Astoria&quot;, on the River Thames at Hampton, Middlesex, is now used as a recording studio by Pink Floyd&#x27;s David Gilmour.

On 30 September 2012, the Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America unveiled a commemorative blue plaque to Karno at his former studios at 38 Southwell Road, Camberwell, in south London.

Karno&#x27;s role in Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s rise to fame was highlighted in the biopic &quot;Chaplin&quot; (1992), where Karno was played by British actor John Thaw. The film included a brief routine based on Karno&#x27;s sketch &quot;Mumming Birds&quot;. The sketch, known as &quot;A Night in an English Music Hall&quot; when Chaplin performed it on tour, was also the basis for Chaplin&#x27;s 1915 film, &quot;A Night in the Show&quot;.

Karno&#x27;s comedy companies were the basis of a trilogy of novels, &quot;The Fun Factory&quot;, by Chris England.

<doc id="343177" wikidata="Q878728" url="?curid=343177" title="James Rolph">
<text>James &quot;Sunny Jim&quot; Rolph Jr. (August 23, 1869 – June 2, 1934) was an American politician. A member of the Republican Party, he was elected to a single term as the 27th governor of California from January 6, 1931, until his death on June 2, 1934, at the height of the Great Depression. Previously, Rolph had been the 30th mayor of San Francisco from January 8, 1912, until his resignation to become governor. Rolph remains the longest-serving mayor in San Francisco history.

==Life and career==
Rolph was born in San Francisco, the son of Margaret (née Nicol) and James Rolph. He had four brothers, including Thomas Rolph, and two sisters. After attending school in the Mission District, he went to work as an office boy in a commission house. He married Annie Marshall Reid (1872–1956) and had at least one son: James Rolph III (1904–1980).

Rolph entered the shipping business in 1900, by forming a partnership with George Hind. Over the next decade, he served as president of two banks, one of which he helped establish. Although he was asked to run for mayor in 1909, he chose to wait until 1911 to run for mayor—a position that he would hold for nineteen years. As mayor, he was known as &quot;Sunny Jim&quot;, and his theme song was &quot;There Are Smiles That Make You Happy&quot;. In 1915 he appeared as himself in an early documentary film titled &quot;Mabel and Fatty Viewing the World&#x27;s Fair at San Francisco&quot;, which starred Fatty Arbuckle and Mabel Normand and was directed by Arbuckle. In 1924, Rolph appeared as himself in a Slim Summerville comedy short film, &quot;Hello, &#x27;Frisco&quot;.

Rolph knew of the power in San Francisco of the Roman Catholic Church. Italians, Irish, French and Germans made up the majority of the population of the city. He established a deep friendship with Archbishop Edward Joseph Hanna.

In addition to his mayoral duties and overseeing his shipping interests, he directed the Ship Owners and Merchants Tugboat Company and the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. He also was vice-president of the Panama–Pacific International Exposition and president of the Merchants&#x27; Exchange. He resigned in 1931 to assume the office of governor of California.

Rolph received considerable criticism for publicly praising the citizens of San Jose following the November 1933 lynching of the confessed kidnapper-murderers of Brooke Hart, a local department store heir, while promising to pardon anyone involved, thereby earning the nickname &quot;Governor Lynch.&quot; Four days before the lynching he had announced he would not call on the National Guard to prevent the lynching, which was already being discussed locally.

After violence erupted during the San Joaquin cotton strike in October 1933, Governor Rolph appointed a fact-finding committee to investigate the deaths of several strikers. When the committee met in Visalia on October 19, 1933, Caroline Decker, a labor activist who had taken part in other California agricultural actions, took testimony from the strikers who testified about the growers&#x27; assaults on striking workers.

==Death==
After suffering several heart attacks, Rolph died in Santa Clara County on June 2, 1934, aged 64, three years into his term. He was the second California governor to die in office, the first being Washington Bartlett in 1887. Rolph is buried at Greenlawn Memorial Park in Colma, California. He was succeeded as governor by Lieutenant Governor Frank Merriam.

==Legacy==
On September 7, 1934, the California Toll Bridge Authority passed a resolution &quot;that...the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge be dedicated as a lasting memorial to the memory of James Rolph Jr.&quot;

A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Rolph as the twenty-third-best American big-city mayor to have served between the years 1820 and 1993.

<text>The M27 is a motorway in Hampshire, England. It is long and runs between Cadnam and Portsmouth. It was opened in stages between 1975 and 1983, providing the largest two urban areas in Hampshire (Southampton and Portsmouth) with a direct motorway link. An extension into the county of West Sussex was planned but never constructed. A number of smaller motorways were proposed, connecting the city centres of Southampton and Portsmouth to the motorway; of these only the M271 and M275 were built. Three sections of the M27 have since been widened to four lanes each way, the first between junctions 7 and 8, the second between junctions 3 and 4, and the third begins at the slip road where junction 11 joins until mid-way to junction 12.

==Route==
Running approximately parallel both to the coast of the Solent and to the A27, the M27 starts as an eastwards continuation of the A31 from Bournemouth and Poole, at Cadnam in the New Forest. The motorway meets the A36 from Salisbury, crosses the Wessex Main Line railway, and then meets the M271 to central Southampton. After the M271, the road becomes a dual four lane motorway and passes Rownhams services, it then meets the M3, (two lanes going off, two lanes continuing to the other side of the junction) reverting to a dual three lane motorway as it passes to the north of Southampton, passes Southampton Airport, meeting junction 7 and becoming dual four lanes again, then becoming dual three lanes after junction 8, it then runs alongside the West Coastway Line as it heads south-east towards Fareham. It then runs alongside the northern outskirts of Fareham, briefly with a fourth climbing lane in either direction, before its junction with the M275 to Portsmouth. Very shortly after this point the motorway ends, becoming the A27, a four lane dual carriageway almost to motorway standards until the junction with the A3 (M) motorway. The official reason for this section of road not being a continuation of the motorway is the hard shoulders being too narrow. Although the M275 which the M27 junctions with, has no hard shoulders along its entire length.

==History==

===Opening dates===
The M27 was opened in stages (in common with many UK motorways) between 1975 and 1983.

*Junction 1 to 2 opened 20 August 1975
*Junction 2 to 4 opened in December 1975
*Junction 4 to 7 opened in 1983
*Junction 7 to 8 opened in February 1978
*Junction 8 to 12 opened in March 1976

The South Stoneham Crematorium, which was located north of South Stoneham Cemetery, was demolished during 1973 to make way for the construction of the M27 motorway. The South Stoneham garden of remembrance is now located at the north end of the cemetery, adjacent to the motorway.

===Unfulfilled plans===
It has been said that the M27 was intended as a motorway connecting south coast towns from Penzance to Ramsgate. However the only proposal of a route similar to that was by the Institution of Highway Engineers in 1936.
Road developments in the New Forest are also restricted due to its national park status.

The M27 was meant to be extended to Chichester; a sign of this is the width of the A27 road between junction 12 and the junction with the A3(M), which has three or four lanes, a hard shoulder and grade-separated junctions. It is not part of the M27 as its hard shoulders are not quite wide enough to comply with motorway regulations.

The M272 was meant to go from junction 5 through Portswood to the centre of Southampton. The M272 was instead built (in much-reduced form) as the A335 Thomas Lewis Way.

Junction 6 was never builtthere were plans for a motorway spur (probably to be numbered M273) connecting the M27 to the centre of the Townhill Park area of Southampton.

A planned service area just east of junction 9 was never constructed. The long westbound exit slip road at junction 9 was designed to allow an entry to and exit from the service area.

=== 2015 incident ===
In November 2015, an elderly woman died after falling from the A3057 bridge that crosses over the M27, into westbound traffic, just before junction 3. She had not taken her anti-psychotic medication, and escaped from her Southampton home through an upstairs window before climbing off the garage roof and running away.

===Smart motorway conversion===
In March 2018, work began to convert the section between junctions 11 and 4 to a smart motorway. The scheme will turn the hard shoulder into a permanent fourth running lane, adding refuge areas along the route and installing new CCTV and speed cameras with mandatory variable speed limit signs.

In early January 2019, official work began when average speed cameras were switched on between junctions 5 and 4. Average speed cameras further along on the scheme will be turned on as work continues along the route. The work has suffered repeated delays, originally due to be complete in Spring 2021. The commissioning phase began in mid February 2022, during which time the smart motorway technology will be tested, including stopped vehicle detection radars. This is with a fully open carriageway and a speed limit controlled by electronic signs on new gantries and CCTV and speed cameras. The 60mph limit was lifted on 29 June 2022 when the upgraded section was fully opened and returned to the national speed limit.

==Junctions==

Data from driver location signs are used to provide distance and carriageway identifier information. Where a junction spans several hundred metres and start and end points are available, both are cited.

<text>A culm is the aerial (above-ground) stem of a grass or sedge. It is derived from Latin , meaning &quot;stalk.&quot; It originally referred to the stem of any type of plant. 

In horticulture or agriculture, it is especially used to describe the stalk or woody stems of bamboo, cane or grain grasses.

==Malting==
In the production of malted grains, the culms refer to the rootlets of the germinated grains. The culms are normally removed in a process known as &quot;deculming&quot; after kilning when producing barley malt, but form an important part of the product when making sorghum or millet malt. These culms are very nutritious and are sold off as animal feed.

<doc id="343181" wikidata="Q1328487" url="?curid=343181" title="M42 motorway">
<text>The M42 motorway runs north east from Bromsgrove in Worcestershire to just south-west of Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire, passing Redditch, Solihull, the National Exhibition Centre (NEC) and Tamworth on the way, serving the east of the Birmingham metropolitan area. The section between the M40 and junction 4 of the M6 forms – though unsigned as such – a part of Euroroute E05. Northwards beyond junction 11, the route is continued as the A42; the junctions on this section, 12–14, are numbered like a continuation of the motorway, but the road has non-motorway status from here.

==History==
===Planning and construction===
Plans for a new motorway by-passing the south and east of Birmingham, reaching Tamworth and connecting the M5 and M6 motorways, were announced in 1972.

The first section opened in November 1976 linking Birmingham Airport with the M6 motorway.

The curve around the south-eastern side of Solihull opened in September 1985 followed by the section from the M6 with the A5 at Tamworth in December 1985. The southern section of the motorway to Alvechurch just north of Redditch to form a junction with the A441 and from A5 at Tamworth with the A444 at Measham opened in 1986.

In 1987, the section to the A38 at Bromsgrove, south of Birmingham was completed. and then in December 1989, the motorway was completed with the opening of the link from the M5.

A planned section north of the M6 running to the M1 near Nottingham was never constructed as planned being replaced by the A42 link, a trunk road which was completed in August 1989 to link with the M1 motorway near Nottingham. The A42 is built to a similar standard to the M42, being a grade separated dual carriageway. The Measham and Ashby-de-la-Zouch bypass section was opened in August 1989 at a cost of £33m. The original planned line of the M42 saw it joining the M1 further to the north, crossing what is now the A50 Derby Southern Bypass and meeting the M1 north of Bardills Island (A52/M1 interchange).

When first built, there was no direct connection between the M5 South and M42. Westbound M42 traffic similarly had no direct connection to the M5 North. Instead traffic had to use the A38 between M5 junction 4 and M42 junction 1.

===Operational history===
Junction 3a was remodelled to give priority to traffic operating between the now westbound section of the M42 and the extended M40 motorway, which opened in stages between December 1989 and January 1991. 

The section of the M42 between junctions 7A and 9 was re-built as part of the M6 Toll works and now forms the link between the M6 and the southern end of the toll road. The M6 Toll opened in 2003.

Active Traffic Management with hard shoulder running and variable speed limits were introduced in 2006.

Since the 1990s, there have been constant plans to build a new service station on the motorway south of Birmingham Airport and the NEC, but this has yet to be built. In 2019 Solihull Planning Committee rejected two plans to build a new service station near junction 4 or next to junction 5. However, in 2022 the Planning Inspector approved plans to allow the plans to proceed at the junction 5 scheme, subject to the road being a full ALM Smart Motorway which is currently not on plan to take place due to the cancellation of new Smart Motorways in 2023.

===History of the road number===
The current road is the second incarnation of the A42. The original (1923) route was Reading to Birmingham via Oxford. The whole road was renumbered in 1935 – the section from Reading to Shillingford became part of the A329, Shillingford to Oxford became part of the A423 and Oxford to Birmingham became part of the A34. In 1993 the A423 was itself renumbered, with the section formerly the A42 becoming part of the A4074 from Reading to Oxford. The modern M42 does interchange with the former A42 at junction 4 near Solihull: Stratford Road now being numbered A34 to the north of the junction and A3400 to the south.

==Features==

=== Birmingham Motorway Box ===

Along with sections of the M5 and M6, the southern sections of the M42 form the Birmingham Motorway Box around Birmingham. Similar to an orbital motorway such as the M25 around London, and the M60 around Manchester, there are areas where this orbital system does not work well. One such point is junction 3A, the link between the M42 and the M40, where traffic is often heavy in the rush hour. The section between the M42 and M6 is often very busy too especially around junction 6 for Birmingham Airport and NEC. The 2024 newly constructed J5a should eliminate some of these queues.

====Managed motorways and Active Traffic Management====
Active Traffic Management (ATM) was launched as a pilot scheme on the M42 operating between junction 3a and 7 with mandatory variable speed limits, hard shoulder running, better driver information signs and a new incident management system. This system allows operators to open and close any lane to traffic in order to help manage congestion or an incident. Between 2006 and 2007, journey times have decreased by 26% northbound and 9% southbound and journey time variability has decreased by 27%. Due to the success of the trial this system was later extended northbound to junction 9 of the M42 (and onto the adjacent M6 to junction 5) and southbound along the M40 to junction 15 as part of the first phase of a nationwide roll out of the rebranded &#x27;Managed motorways; concept.

==Incidents and accidents==
*A collision involving 160 vehicles occurred on 10 March 1997 in fog in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire which resulted in three deaths and 60 injuries.
*Drivers have rated the M42 as the worst motorway in England, in a 2024 survey from Transport Focus, scoring 56 per cent for overall satisfaction from road users, citing speed limits (&quot;for no reason&quot;), delays, roadworks and potholes.

== New junction ==
As of 18 December 2024 a new junction named junction 5a located between Solihull junction 5 and Birmingham Airport/NEC junction 6 and 2.4KM of new dual carriageway the A4545 alongside the motorway has been opened to provide direct access to Birmingham Airport and Birmingham Business Park and to reduce congestion in the area. 

Work started in 2021 to build the new junction and road and finished on schedule at the end of 2024.

==Junctions==
Data from driver location signs are used to provide distance and carriageway identifier information. If a junction extends over several hundred metres and both start and end points are known, both are shown.

<doc id="343182" wikidata="Q4648884" url="?curid=343182" title="A14 road (England)">
<text>The A14 is a major trunk road in England, running from Catthorpe Interchange, a major intersection at the southern end of the M6 and junction 19 of the M1 in Leicestershire to the Port of Felixstowe, Suffolk. The road forms part of the unsigned Euroroutes E24 and E30. It is the busiest shipping lane in East Anglia carrying anything from cars to large amounts of cargo between the UK and Mainland Europe.

==Route==
Beginning at the Catthorpe Interchange, the A14 runs through Kettering, Northamptonshire towards Huntingdon where it now runs parallel to the A1 past Brampton, Cambridgeshire and now bypasses Huntingdon completely due to the A14 Cambridge to Huntingdon Scheme from 2017 until 2022. It continues past Bar Hill towards Cambridge to meet the end of the M11 and the A428 at the Girton Interchange. The A14 continues easterly over northern Cambridge towards Newmarket where it briefly joins with the A11 to form the Newmarket Bypass between J36 and J38. The A11 splits off again towards the North and the A14 continues through Bury St Edmunds, past Stowmarket then on to bypass Ipswich via the Orwell Bridge and finally comes to an end at the Port of Felixstowe fully connecting the Midlands to East Anglia.

The road is a dual carriageway, mostly with two lanes each way, but there are some dual three-lane sections: on the Newmarket bypass (between Junctions 36 and 38) where it runs concurrent with the A11, at Kettering (between Junctions 7 and 9) and as of December 2019, with the opening of the Cambridge to Huntington improvement scheme, dual three-lanes between Milton and the A1 Junction at Brampton (Junctions 22 to 33). There is also a short dual four-lane section of the A14 that runs between Bar Hill and the Girton Interchange. There are three at-grade junctions: with the B663 at Bythorn in Cambridgeshire (junction 15); at the Leighton Bromswold turn a few miles to the east (junction 17); and at the Dockspur Roundabout at the edge of Felixstowe (junction 60).

There were two additional at-grade roundabouts along the former A14 main route, these being Brampton Hut Interchange (Junction 21) and Spittals Interchange (former Junction 23). However, these junctions are no longer part of the A14 since the opening of the new alignment south of Huntingdon in December 2019.

The old A14 from Huntingdon Spittals interchange to Godmanchester was closed both ways for a 2-year period, and has now reopened in 2022 as part of the A1307, after the Huntingdon railway viaduct has been dismantled. Link roads at Hinchingbrooke and Mill Common will connect the former A14 dual carriageway to the road network in Huntingdon.

==History==
The current A14 includes parts of the former A45 between Felixstowe and Cambridge, the A604 between Cambridge and Kettering, a short stretch of the former A6 west of Kettering, plus a new link road which was constructed in the early 1990s between there and the M1/M6 interchange at Catthorpe, Leicestershire. The original A14 was known as the Royston - Alconbury Trunk Road, the original A604 was known as the Barton Seagrave - Harwich Trunk Road, and the original A45 was known as the Ipswich - Weedon Trunk Road.

Prior to the current A14, the main route from Birmingham to the Haven ports followed the M6, M1, A428 and A45 via Coventry, Rugby, Northampton, Bedford, St Neots and Cambridge, and then went through all the towns on the A14 to Felixstowe. Prior to its use for the current route, the A14 designation had been used for a section of road between the A10 at Royston and the A1 at Alconbury, following part of the route of Ermine Street which is now designated the A1198 to Godmanchester and the A1307 to Alconbury. The section through Huntingdon is now part of the A1307 following the opening of the Huntingdon by-pass; Highways England demolished a viaduct carrying the road over the River Great Ouse and the Great Northern railway and built new junctions with local roads.

The M45 motorway was constructed in 1959 parallel to part of the old A45 in the Midlands. It opened on the same day as the M1 motorway and was soon one of the busiest sections of the motorway. The M6 opened in the late 1960s and early 1970s, after which more traffic to the ports used the route from junction 1 of the M6 via the A427 to Market Harborough, followed by a short section of the A6 to Kettering and then the A604 to Cambridge, before joining the old A45 to the ports as above. The M45 now carries little traffic.

The sections from Huntingdon east to the ports were upgraded first, starting with the Huntingdon bypass in 1973, followed by the Girton to Bar Hill section in 1975/76 and the Cambridge northern bypass and Cambridge/Newmarket section in 1976/77. The Bar Hill-to-Huntingdon section opened in 1979, prior to the M11 which was fully opened in 1980. The Ipswich southern bypass, including the Orwell Bridge, opened between 1982 and 1985.

The A604 between Kettering and Huntingdon was upgraded and the section from Catthorpe to Kettering was constructed between 1989 and 1991 (commonly referred to at the time as the &quot;M1-A1 link road&quot;) following a lengthy period of consultation. The first inquiry was in 1974 and then a series of inquiries for sections of the preferred route from September 1984 until June 1985, during which objections came from some 1,130 sources. Subsequent public inquiries were held regarding Supplementary Orders. The route close to the site of the Battle of Naseby was particularly difficult, and was taken to the High Court. The link was opened by Transport Secretary John MacGregor on 15 July 1994.

Work to create a compact grade-separated junction (Junction 45/Rougham) and to re-align a stretch of carriageway was completed in 2006.

Vehicles over 7.5 tonnes traveling east were banned from using the outside lane on a dual two-lane section on a steep climb to Welford summit close to Junction 1 (A5199) from spring 2007; a similar scheme covered of the westbound carriageway from Junction 2, including a particularly steep climb to Naseby summit. The bans are active between 6am and 8pm, and are intended to reduce delays to other traffic from lorries attempting to pass on these climbs.

Between 2007 and 2008 a new section of a two-lane dual carriageway was constructed at the Haughley Bends, one of Suffolk&#x27;s most notorious accident blackspots, to rationalise access using a new grade-separated junction. The road opened in the summer of 2008 with some associated local works being completed early in 2009.

Variable Message Signs (VMS), traffic queue detection loops and closed circuit TV (CCTV) were installed at a cost of £50million during 2009 to 2010 Both carriageways between Junction 52 (Claydon) and Junction 55 (Copdock) were refurbished during 2010 at a cost of £9 million. Work was being carried out a year earlier than scheduled as part of a UK government&#x27;s fiscal stimulus package.

The Cambridgeshire Guided Busway connecting Cambridge, Huntingdon and St Ives, which opened in 2011, was intended to remove 5.6% of traffic using that section of the A14 (rising to 11.1% with the new Park &amp; Ride sites), although as other traffic re-routes to the freed-up road space from other parts of the local road network, the net reduction is predicted to be 2.3%.

The Felixstowe and Nuneaton freight capacity scheme, designed to take more lorry traffic off the A14 between the Port and the Midlands by increasing rail capacity and allowing the carriage of larger &#x27;Hi-cube&#x27; shipping containers by widening to the W10 loading gauge, opened in 2011.

Junction 55 (Copdock interchange) to the south of Ipswich was signalisation in 2011, along with lengthening the off-slip from the A1214. The section around Kettering between Junctions 7 and 9 was widened to three lanes between November 2013 and April 2015 at a cost of £42million.

After initially being shelved in 2010, the Catthorpe Interchange at the road&#x27;s Western terminus underwent a massive restructuring in 2014. The redesigned junction was intended to allow free-flowing traffic movement between the A14, the southern terminus of the M6 motorway and Junction 19 of the M1 motorway. The first part opened in September 2016, and the upgrade was completed three months later.

===Construction===
The contract for the 6.5 miles Huntingdon - Godmanchester bypass, from the A1 to Godmanchester, contract was given to A. Monk Ltd, of Padgate, on Tuesday 22 May 1973, for £6m. Construction began on Monday 4 June 1973, to finish in the summer of 1975. It was controversial. The local Conservative MP David Renton had played a large part in choosing the route, which not everyone had liked. The dual-carriageway bypass, from The Stukeleys to Godmanchester, opened as the A604 on Tuesday 30 September 1975. For many years this was the A14.
The Godmanchester to Bar Hill section was built by Sir Alfred McAlpine (Southern), opening in April 1981 as the A604. The Bar Hill to Swavesey section had opened first, in early December 1980. This section had originally been a three-lane single-carriageway road.

The original Fenstanton bypass had opened in early February 1965, as a single carriageway, built by Cementation Company.

The contract for the £350,000 intersection at Bar Hill, was awarded in February 1975 to Roadworks (1952) Ltd, of Ipswich.

The contract for the Girton to Bar Hill section was awarded on Monday 16 February 1976 to Roadworks (1952) Ltd, of Ipswich. Construction started in March 1976. The section opened in December 1977.

The 9.6-mile A45 Cambridge Northern bypass was accepted by the city council on Thursday 24 June 1971. The inquiry took place on Tuesday 15 February 1972 at the Guildhall, at the same time as the M11 bypass inquiry. The inquiry was proceeding in July, and was to take six weeks, but it took six months. The bypass was to be built by late 1975. By May 1974, the bypass was to start in late 1975, and to finish by mid 1977; it would cost £10m in December 1974. By September 1975, it was to cost £22m, and to start by January 1976. The A604 Girton to Bar Hill section was to start at the same time. In January 1976, the bypass was to start in April 1976.
In March 1976, the bypass was to start in June 1976, with a tender accepted by May 1976, to take 18 months. In May 1976, the bypass would now open at the end of 1978. At the end of June 1976 a £16m contract was given to Bovis Civil Engineering, for the Madingley to Stow cum Quy section. The start of construction ceremony was held at Madingley on Friday 23 July 1976. The M11 bypass was to start in mid 1977, to be opened by February 1980. At 12pm on Thursday 21 December 1978 the Cambridge northern bypass was opened at Madingley by John Horam; it had taken took 28 months, but the Girton and Madingley interchanges were unfinished, and traffic was allowed late in the evening. The police were not happy with traffic on such an unfinished road.

For the 3.75-mile A45 Stow-cum-Quy to Nine Mile Hill section, a one day inquiry was held in April 1975 in Bottisham. It was constructed by Monk from September 1976 to be finished by mid-1978, when the northern bypass should be approaching completion.
The section opened in early April 1978.

The 14-mile A45 Newmarket bypass in 1971, was to start in late 1973. Wimpey started construction on 6 June 1973, costing £9,047,925.
Two previous Labour transport secretaries had said that Newmarket did not need a bypass. The Conservatives disagreed. The Newmarket bypass opened on Friday 11 July 1975.

The 5.5-mile A45 Seven Mile Bridge to Westley Roundabout section, known as the Kentford bypass, was to start by mid 1975. It started in July 1975, and was to finish by July 1977, constructed by Higgs and Hill, costing £3,516,180.

The 3.75-mile A45 Bury bypass in 1971, was to start in early 1972, to be the first section of the new A45 to start. It was to start in May 1972, to take 24 months. It cost £2,696,230 late April, with the contract given to Monk, to take 18 months. The Bury bypass was opened at 11.30am on Friday 7 December 1973 by the town MP.

The 9.5-mile A45 Stowmarket-Claydon bypass in 1971, was to start in early 1973, the second section of the new A45 to start. Construction started on 29 May 1973 by WC French, costing £8,972,857. It was built in two stages with 7 miles to the A140 at Beacon Hill to open in November 1974, then 3 miles to the A45 at Claydon in November 1975.
But a lack of steel meant that the first section was eight months late and opened on Thursday 7 August 1975. The second section opened on Thursday 27 November 1975. One of the WC French civil engineers working on the project, Richard Coult of Rushbrooke, West Suffolk, originally from Felixstowe, died on Turkish Airlines Flight 981 on 3 March 1974; he was one of the 17 players of Bury St Edmunds RUFC on the doomed flight.

The A45 Rougham to Woolpit Bypass section started in early 1977, costing £4.6million. It was planned to open in January 1979, but opened four months late, due to bad weather. It was built by Amey Roadstone Construction (ARC). The section opened on Thursday 17 May 1979, which now gave dual carriageway to Ipswich.

The A45 Woolpit to Haughley New Street section started in October 1975, built by Monk, costing £1.6million. It would take 21 months to be ready by August 1977. The section opened on 11 April 1977.

===A14 Cambridge to Huntingdon Improvement Scheme===
The plan, originally called the &#x27;A14 Ellington to Fen Ditton&#x27;, was to include widening from Fen Ditton to Fen Drayton broadly on the existing alignment, and then a new route to be constructed from Fen Drayton to Ellington, the route following a widened A1 for a short distance south of Brampton Interchange. One of the main reasons for the widening and the new road was the volume of traffic using the existing road. This section was heavily used by local traffic, long-distance traffic to/from the M11 to A1(M), and freight traffic to/from Felixstowe and the Midlands. Another reason was the deteriorating condition of the Huntingdon viaduct over the East Coast Main Line. The viaduct was reaching the end of its life and needed replacing, a task that would require closing the road for a long period of time and not improve congestion.

The Highways Agency unveiled its plans in March 2005. Details of the preferred route for the Fen Drayton-to-Fen Ditton section were published in March 2007. The contract was awarded to Costain Skanska Joint Venture on 28 January 2008, which worked on detailed plans for the Highways Agency before publishing a draft order. The scheme was expected to open in stages between 2015 and 2016. The Highways Agency estimated that the widening and the new road would cost in total between £690 million and £1.2 billion, making this the most expensive scheme in its roads programme.

In October 2009 the cost estimate had risen to £1.3 billion with work due to start in 2012 and being completed in winter 2015/2016. The Campaign for Better Transport was opposed to the plans, listing their reasons for objection as the carbon emissions the road would induce, the cost, and its negative impact on non-car travel. The coalition government suspended the scheme when it came into power, with Philip Hammond, the Secretary of State for Transport, suggesting that the scheme would be &#x27;axed&#x27;, and that the only way it would get built was as a toll road. It was confirmed at the end of October that government money would not pay for the scheme, when Roads Minister Mike Penning said that the scheme was not affordable and no longer offered acceptable value for money. The scheme was officially cancelled in 2010.

In 2011, the government announced an &#x27;A14 Challenge&#x27; inviting people to present proposals for the route. The revised scheme was similar to its predecessor and was now known as the &#x27;A14 Cambridge to Huntingdon Improvement Scheme&#x27;. It involved widening of the A1 between Brampton and Alconbury, a new Huntingdon southern bypass, widening of the existing A14 from Swavesey to Milton, and a new local access road between Swavesey and Girton. The A14 through Huntingdon around the Huntingdon viaduct would be redundant and the viaduct demolished. In November 2012, it was reported that the scheme might be back on a fast track to implementation and it was mentioned in the June 2013 spending review. The project was approved by the Secretary of State for Transport in May 2016. Work was due to be completed by March 2021 at a cost of £1.2–1.8 billion. The works gave rise to one of the largest commercial archaeological projects ever undertaken in the UK.

In September 2018, Highways England said it was to ask the Planning Inspectorate to consider giving the upgraded section of A14 motorway status, to be known as the A14(M). However, shortly after the amendment of the Development Consent Order, the announcement came that the new Huntingdon southern bypass, between Brampton and the A1 to Swavesey, was ready a year ahead of schedule. Instead of waiting for the road to be reclassified, Highways England made the decision to withdraw the application so the road could be opened to traffic as soon as possible.

The of new bypass opened a year ahead of schedule from the A14 at Swavesey to the A1 at Brampton on 9 December 2019, and the remainder of the route opened on 5 May 2020. A smart motorway in all but name, the new road has variable message signs and gantries, emergency SOS lay-bys and virtually all non-motorway traffic is prohibited from using the new road (this includes pedestrians, cyclists, horse riders, horses &amp; carriages, motorcycles under 50cc and agricultural vehicles). The new route is also to be supplied with variable speed limits to reduce congestion when legislation is passed to allow this technology to be used on primary roads.

At the same time as the southern section opening, junctions on the A14 between Ellington and Bar Hill were renumbered. This upgraded section of the A14 has fewer junctions than previously; junctions 26 to 30 no longer exist. The section of the old A14 from Godmanchester to the Spittals interchange in Huntingdon was permanently closed after the Huntington bypass opened, in order to remove the Huntingdon viaduct over the East Coast Main Line. The project to build new links to the town centre is to be completed by 2022.

The construction works of the section between Huntingdon and Godmanchester, specifically where the River Great Ouse is crossed, was painted by Michael Murfin, a local artist. The artist&#x27;s work records various stages of the build, depicting workers on the site and the heavy machinery used in the construction of the viaduct.

==Junction list==























== Road number signage and history ==
The numbering of the A14 is inconsistent with the national road numbering scheme, as it begins in zone 5 and crosses through zone 6 on the way to zone 1 east of Huntingdon to Felixstowe. The road is concurrent with the A12 road from the Seven Hills Interchange to the Copdock Interchange which forms the Ipswich Southern bypass and with the A11 road between junctions 36 and 38.

From the A12 west of Ipswich to the M1/M6 junction, the A14 is part of (but not signed as) the E-road E 24, and from Ipswich to Felixstowe it is part of E 30.

East of the Girton Interchange with the M11 at Cambridge, the A14 used to be the A45, and much of the long-distance traffic further west had previously used the A45 route. The section between Cambridge and Kettering used to be the A604, apart from a short section near Kettering that used to be part of the A6. The road which was the A14 until the late 1980s is now the A1198 between Royston, Hertfordshire and Godmanchester.

=== Identity of the A14 spur north of Huntingdon ===
Until the opening in 2019 of the Huntingdon bypass, there was some confusion as to the identity of the section of road between the A141 junction at Stukeley (Spittals Interchange) and the A1(M). The Ordnance Survey 1:25000 map showed the A-road section as part of the A14 and the motorway section (between the B1043 junction and the A1(M)) as the A14(M). However, some official documents, including the 1993 statutory instrument which authorised the motorway upgrade, referred to it as the A604(M). The same confusion appeared on the former Highways Agency page about the 1996-8 upgrade to the A1(M) between Alconbury and Peterborough. The signs on entering the motorway section, unusually, show a large &quot;start of motorway&quot; symbol with no number, and there are no driver location signs confirming the route number.

Following the opening of the Huntingdon bypass, the former A14 between the A1(M) and the Cambridge Services at Swavesey has been renumbered A1307, with the section through Huntingdon itself closed for the time being. Therefore, the &quot;Alconbury spur&quot; of the former A14 trunk route finally carries a unique road number again, in the form of the A1307. The official number of the former A14(M) stub is not known: some claim it is still A14(M), as the new road did not become a motorway in the end; others claim A604(M), although the lack of an A604 makes this hard to believe; and others still claim it is just a spur of the A1(M), carrying the same number.

==Longer term plans==
The Highways Agency has plans to increase capacity from junction 3 to junction 10 near Kettering &#x27;in the longer term&#x27; and also to widen the road throughout Northamptonshire to &quot;help cut the number of accidents and cope with the likely growth in traffic&quot;.

==Notable incidents==
* 17 November 1998. A lorry collided with the petrol station between Bar Hill and Lolworth. The incident happened shortly before 11am and one person was killed and many others injured. The road was closed and there were huge tailbacks.
* 26 July 2006. The A14 was closed for 24 hours near Newmarket when a van carrying acetylene gas canisters caught fire and the rescue services were advised by BOC that they could remain unstable and would need 24 hours to cool. Bomb disposal officers were called in and the Red Cross set up a centre in Newmarket for those who were stranded.

<text>Courken George Deukmejian Jr. ( 
; June 6, 1928May 8, 2018) was an American politician who served as the 35th governor of California from 1983 to 1991. A member of the Republican Party, he was the state&#x27;s first governor of Armenian descent.

Born in New York, Deukmejian moved to California in 1955. He was elected to the State Assembly in 1962 to represent Long Beach. Four years later he was elected into the State Senate and later served as the Senate&#x27;s minority leader. In 1970, Deukmejian unsuccessfully ran for Attorney General of California, finishing fourth in the Republican primary. In 1978 he secured the nomination and defeated Yvonne Brathwaite Burke to become the state&#x27;s 27th attorney general. As attorney general, he led a veto override against Governor Jerry Brown, who had vetoed legislation to authorize the death penalty in the state.

After Governor Brown did not seek reelection in 1982, Deukmejian won the Republican nomination for governor and faced Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley in the general election. Although opinion polls showed that Bradley had a favorable lead in the race, Deukmejian narrowly won the election outright. In 1986, Deukmejian defeated Bradley again for a much larger victory. As governor, Deukmejian made a name for being tough on crime, presenting himself to be in favor of &quot;law and order&quot;. Under his administration, the California prison population nearly tripled, and he increased spending for the building of new prisons.

Deukmejian retired from front-line politics in 1991 and was succeeded as governor by fellow Republican Pete Wilson.

==Early life and education==
Deukmejian was born on June 6, 1928, in Menands, New York. His parents were Armenians born in the Armenian highlands, who emigrated from the Ottoman Empire (present-day Turkey) to the United States in the early 1900s. His father, Courken George Deukmejian, whose sister was killed during the Armenian Genocide, was a rug merchant born in Aintab. Deukmejian&#x27;s mother, Alice Gairden, was born in Karin; in the United States she worked for Montgomery Ward and later for New York State.

Deukmejian attended local schools. For college, he graduated in 1949 with a B.A. in Sociology from Siena College. He earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from St. John&#x27;s University in New York City in 1952. From 1953 to 1955, he served in the U.S. Army, assigned to the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps (JAG).

Deukmejian moved to California in 1955 where his sister, Anna Ashjian, was living and there was a large Armenian community. She introduced him to his future wife Gloria Saatjian, a bank teller whose parents were also immigrants from Armenia. They married on February 16, 1957. He and his wife had three children: two daughters, born in 1964 and 1969; and one son, born in 1966.

== Political career ==

Deukmejian entered politics in California after a short period of private legal practice in Long Beach alongside Malcolm M. Lucas. In 1962, Deukmejian was elected to represent Long Beach in the State Assembly.

In 1966, he was elected as a state senator, serving from 1967 to 1979. He was a high-profile advocate for capital punishment. By 1969, he was the Majority Leader of the California State Senate.

He first ran for Attorney General of California in 1970, finishing fourth in the Republican primary. He won the election for Attorney General in 1978 and served from 1979 to 1983. During this time, he led a high-profile campaign against cannabis in northern California, which later became the Campaign Against Marijuana Planting. Additionally, he led a veto override against Governor Jerry Brown, who had vetoed legislation to authorize the death penalty.

== Governorship ==
Deukmejian was elected in 1982 to his first term as Governor of California. He first defeated Lieutenant Governor Mike Curb, a recording company owner, in the Republican primary. One of his early primary backers was former gubernatorial candidate Joe Shell of Bakersfield, a conservative who had opposed Richard M. Nixon in the 1962 California primary. Upon his victory, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, 
The image that comes across of Mr. Deukmejian — a devoted family man, an Episcopal churchman, an ice cream lover — led one reporter to write, &quot;California may have accidentally elected Iowa&#x27;s Governor&quot;.

In the general election, Deukmejian ran as a conservative supporter of public safety and balanced budgets. In addition, he was strongly critical of outgoing Governor Jerry Brown and promised to run a very different administration. He strongly criticized the Supreme Court of California, which was dominated by Brown appointees, notably controversial Chief Justice Rose Bird.
Deukmejian narrowly defeated Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley in the general election. Deukmejian won the election by about 100,000 votes, about 1.2 percent of the 7.5 million votes cast. The victory came despite opinion polls leading up to the election that consistently showed Bradley with a lead, and despite exit polling conducted after voting closed that led some news organizations on the night of the election to make early projections of a Bradley victory. The discrepancy between the polling numbers and the election&#x27;s ultimate results would come to be termed the &quot;Bradley effect&quot;, which refers to a hypothesized tendency of white voters to tell interviewers or pollsters that they are undecided or likely to vote for a black candidate, but they actually vote for his opponent.

Deukmejian&#x27;s governorship was a departure from that of his predecessor, Jerry Brown. He vowed not to raise taxes, later saying that he was &quot;business friendly&quot;. In addition, he presented himself as a &quot;law and order&quot; candidate, proposing new efforts to fight crime. He faced a Democrat-dominated California State Legislature during his two terms as governor. He was the sole Republican statewide officeholder until Thomas W. Hayes was appointed California State Treasurer, following the death of Treasurer Jesse Unruh. In 1983, Deukmejian abolished the Caltrans Office of Bicycle Facilities and reduced state spending for bicycle projects from $5 million to the statutory minimum of $360,000 per year. In 1984, he vetoed A.B. 1, the first bill to ban discrimination against gays and lesbians, which passed the Legislature.
In 1986, Bradley sought a rematch, and Deukmejian defeated him by a 60% to 37% margin. He was generally regarded as a moderate-to-conservative Republican.

The Deukmejian administration began during a national economic recession. He halted the hiring of new state employees and banned out-of-state travel for those in government. He rejected the legislature&#x27;s demands for tax hikes, and pared $1.1 billion from its budget by selectively vetoing spending items. One year later, further cuts, along with a nationwide economic rebound that benefited the state, created a billion dollar surplus for 1985. His 1985 budget slightly increased spending in highway construction, but cut deeply into the education, health, welfare and environmental budgets. For this he was roundly criticized, and the cuts probably led to his low polling numbers at the end of his tenure as governor. 3 years later, Deukmejian faced his own billion dollar deficit. He supported a raise in the state minimum wage in 1989. Deukmejian largely made his career by being tough on crime. When he was in the legislature, he wrote California&#x27;s capital punishment law. As a candidate for re-election, in 1986 he opposed the retention election of three Brown-appointed justices of the Supreme Court of California due to their consistent opposition to the death penalty in any and all circumstances. The best known of these was Rose Bird, the first female Chief Justice of the Court (and the first one to be voted off). Deukmejian elevated his friend and law partner, Malcolm Lucas, from Associate Justice to Chief Justice, and appointed three new associate justices. Under Deukmejian, the California prison population nearly tripled — as of December 31, 1982, the total prison population stood at 34,640 inmates. He increased spending for the building of new prisons.

In 1988, then-Vice President George H. W. Bush considered Deukmejian as a possible running mate for the presidential election that year. During a trade mission to South Korea in August, Deukmejian sent a letter saying he could not be considered for nomination, refusing to leave the governorship to Democratic Lieutenant Governor Leo T. McCarthy.

Deukmejian did not seek re-election to a third term as governor in the 1990 gubernatorial elections. The Republicans instead nominated sitting United States Senator Pete Wilson, who defeated Dianne Feinstein in the general election. He was the last governor not affected by the two-term limit that was passed by voters in 1990.

On October 1, 1989, Deukmejian signed legislation authorizing the purchasing of health insurance by uninsured Californians suffering from catastrophic serious illnesses, such as AIDS, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease, to be funded through tobacco tax revenues. In 1991, in his last days in office, he vetoed the property tax exemption bill that applied to companies building solar in California. This exemption was focused toward the Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) plants then being built by Luz International Limited (Luz). The veto led to the bankruptcy of Luz.

== Post-governorship ==

Deukmejian was a partner in the law firm of Sidley &amp; Austin from 1991 until 2000 when he retired. He reentered public life by serving on special committees, including one to reform the California penal system, and a charter-reform committee in his hometown of Long Beach. He oversaw a revamping of the UCLA Willed Body Program after a scandal involving the sale of human body parts donated for science. In 2013, a courthouse in Long Beach was named in his honor. Deukmejian received an honorary doctor of laws degree from California State University, Long Beach, in 2008, because of his support for education, state law, and Long Beach. In 2015, he was given the Key to the City of Long Beach.

==Death==
Deukmejian died of natural causes at his home on May 8, 2018, at the age of 89. California Governor Jerry Brown said on Twitter: &quot;George Deukmejian was a popular governor and made friends across the political aisle. Anne and I join all Californians in expressing our deepest condolences to his family and friends&quot;. He resided in the Belmont Park neighborhood of Long Beach for over 51 years. Throughout his adult life, he was a member of All Saints Episcopal Church in Long Beach.

<doc id="343187" wikidata="Q4648862" url="?curid=343187" title="A12 road (England)">
<text>The A12 is a major road in Eastern England. It runs north-east/south-west between London and the coastal town of Lowestoft in the north-eastern corner of Suffolk, following a similar route to the Great Eastern Main Line until Ipswich. A section of the road between Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth became part of the A47 in 2017. Between the junctions with the M25 and the A14, the A12 forms part of the unsigned Euroroute E30 (prior to 1985, it was the E8). Unlike most A roads, this section of the A12, together with the A14 and the A55, has junction numbers as if it were a motorway.

The section of the A12 through Essex has sections of dual two lanes and dual three lanes, with eight changes in width between the M25 to Ipswich. It was named as Britain&#x27;s worst road because of &quot;potholes and regular closures due to roadworks&quot; in a 2007 survey by Cornhill Insurance. The A12 is covered by the National Highways &quot;A12 / A120 route based strategy&quot;.

Starting just north of the Blackwall Tunnel, where it connects end on to the A102, it heads north through Bow and Hackney Wick, then north-east through Leyton and Romford, then into Essex, passing Brentwood and Colchester. In Suffolk, it passes Ipswich and Saxmundham, then follows the coast through Lowestoft before entering Norfolk, passing through Gorleston-on-Sea and ending at Great Yarmouth. In February 2017, the route was renumbered between Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft to become the A47. In June 2024, most of the A1117 was renumbered as the A12, incorporating the Lowestoft Gull Wing Bridge, where the A12 now terminates at the A47 in North Lowestoft.

==History==
The A12 was formed in 1922 as part of the Great Britain road numbering scheme, and initially the route went from Stratford to Gallows Corner along the present A118 road before continuing to Great Yarmouth. This section in London was rerouted to run on Eastern Avenue by the mid-1940s, and extended to follow the current route from Blackwall Tunnel along the East Cross Route, (previously the A102(M) &amp; A106), the M11 link road in 1999.

The route from London to Essex has long been important, with Old Ford being the location of an ancient Celtic crossing of the River Lea. The route was altered slightly by the Romans who created a paved road from London to Colchester, which was part of &quot;Inter V&quot; on the Antonine Itinerary, and parts of this were used by a turnpike road, the Great Essex Road. The crossing of the Lea moved to its current location at Bow around 1110 when Matilda, wife of Henry I, ordered a distinctively bow-shaped, three-arched bridge to be built over the river. A map from 1766 shows a route from London to Lowestoft which follows much of the current A12.

The &quot;Ipswich to South Town and Bungay Turnpike Trust&quot; was established in 1785, operating between Ipswich and Great Yarmouth. The trust was wound up in 1872 following the arrival of the East Suffolk Line which was fully operational between the two towns in 1859. Following the demise of the Turnpike trust, responsibility reverted to parish councils until the new county councils took over in 1889.

A new section of the A12, known as the &quot;M11 link road&quot; or &quot;A12 Hackney-M11 Link Road&quot;, was built in the early 1990s in the face of the major M11 link road protest and finally opened in October 1999. The section of road had originally been proposed in 1903 in a Royal Commission on London Traffic. A public inquiry had been held in September 1961 and a further three public inquiries, a Parliamentary Bill and a High Court challenge had been required before the work started.

Initiated in 2000, the London to Ipswich Multi-modal study reported its conclusions late in 2002.

In 2008 improvements were made to the junction between the A12 and the M25 to increase slip-road capacity, in particular for clockwise M25 traffic turning north onto the A12, and to ease congestion on the Brook Street Roundabout (serving the M25, A12 and local Brentwood traffic as the A1023).

The bascule bridge in Lowestoft was built in 1972, and was refurbished in spring 2008.

Essex County Council carried out its own inquiry into the road in 2008, with work on a £12.4m scheme for a new junction on the A12 at Cuckoo Farm, Colchester adjacent to the Colchester Community Stadium, subsequently starting in December 2009. It was promoted by Essex County Council who prepared plans in 2001 and was financed from the Community Infrastructure Fund. It opened on 16 December 2010.

The section of A12 between Brentwood and Ipswich is classed as a major trunk road, managed by Highways England. The section between Ipswich and Lowestoft was de-trunked in 2001, with control passing to Suffolk County Council. This section is primarily single carriageway.

In 2011, at Junction 33 (Copdock Interchange) the junction was widened and improved to ease the increasing traffic flow along the road. Works ended in 2012. A widening of the section from Chelmsford to the A120 junction near Colchester is proposed with a start date in 2023/2024 and expected to complete around 2028.

==Bypasses==
The Eastern Avenue was built in the 1920s as a bypass for the section between Romford and Ilford, meeting what was the A11 at Leytonstone. It was numbered A106 until the 1930s when it became part of the A12.

The long Brentwood bypass was opened in November 1965.

A bypass for Chelmsford was first included in the roads programme in 1968. Draft orders for the southern bypass were published in 1974, however the public inquiry in 1975 suggested that the government should re-examine the appropriateness of a &quot;central route&quot; and the government delayed the road. In 1979 the government announced that it would proceed with the southern dual two lane route which opened in 1986.

The Wickham Market bypass opened in July 1976, providing a much needed improvement to avoid the narrow, one-lane wide section of road through Wickham Market.
Ipswich&#x27;s &quot;Southern by-pass&quot; via the Orwell Bridge was opened in 1982. This section, when first numbered, was part of the A45 and later designated as part of the A14.

The Martlesham bypass (previously known as the Kesgrave and Martlesham Bypass) was completed in 1987/1988 as was the Saxmundham bypass.

A white paper, &quot;Roads for Prosperity&quot;, published in 1989, proposed to widen the Chelmsford Bypass and the section from Hatfield Peverel to Witham to dual 3 lane; it also proposed widening the section from Saxmundham to Lowestoft and from Wickham Market to Farnham to dual 2 lanes. It also included a &#x27;new route from the M25 to Chelmsford&#x27; as a dual two lane road following the proposed route of the M12 motorway.

The Department for Transport published &quot;Trunk roads, England, into the 1990s&quot; in May 1990 which included ten proposed developments for the A12 between the M25 and Lowestoft including the M12 motorway between M25 and the Chelmsford bypass, Chelmsford bypass widening and improvements on the sections from Hatfield Peverel to Marks Tey, Four Sisters to Stratford St. Mary, Martlesham to Wickham Market, Wickham Market to Saxmundham, the bypass around Saxmundham, Saxmundham to south of Wrentham, South of Wrentham to Kessingland and the Lowestoft relief road.

A public inquiry in the &quot;Saxmundham to Wickham Market bypass&quot; was held in 1995 but this road has not been built.

Between 1968 and 2024 Lowestoft has seen various new roads built to bypass and divert the A12 away from the historic residential streets along the coastline. In the 60s/70s Bloodmoor Roundabout / Bloodmoor Road was completed, paving the way for the new route of the A12 from the south. 1990 saw the construction of Peto Way, followed by Millennium Way in 1998 (the &quot;Northern Relief Road&quot;) (formerly part of the A1117), however it wouldn&#x27;t be until 2024 these were incorporated into the A12. In 2006, the 1.5 mile Tom Crisp Way &quot;Southern Relief Road&quot; opened, diverting the A12 away from the cliffs and built up Kirkely. 2015 saw Millennium Way extended to connect to the A47 at Corton and 2024 saw a new third river crossing built, the Gull Wing Bridge, which linked the northern and southern relief roads and completes the A12 bypass in Lowestoft. The entire bypass consists of single carriageway roads with modern cycle and pedestrian facilities and a mostly 40 MPH speed limit.

==M12 motorway==
During the 1940s, there were plans for a motorway between South Woodford and Brentwood, initially dubbed Radial Route 7, which later became the M12 motorway in the 1960s. This would have run from the North Circular Road in London, at the base of the current M11 motorway, joining the A12 north of Brentwood. The North Circular was to be upgraded to motorway-standard as part of Ringway 2 and be designated as the M15 motorway. The M11 was to have provided a motorway standard road into central London past Ringway 1, terminating at the Angel in Islington. The M12 motorway was never built, although the junction of the M11 with the North Circular was designed to accommodate it.

The scheme was revived in the late 1980s, and extended the northern section to the A12 near Chelmsford. Plans for the M12 motorway were withdrawn in March 1994, following a review of the trunk roads programme.

==Route==

===London===
The A12 starts just north of the Blackwall Tunnel at a junction with the A102 and the A13. From here to past Ipswich (including the entire section through London) the road is a dual carriageway. North of the junction, the A12 heads northwards as a 2/3 lane dual carriageway mostly at street level. This stretch of road is known as the Blackwall Tunnel Northern Approach. This stretch ends at the triple-layer interchange with the A11 at Bow Road where it becomes the East Cross Route. This is mainly a 3/4 lane dual carriageway built mainly on flyovers and underpasses and was built in the late 1960s, previously called the A102(M).
The road turns North Eastwards at the unfinished Hackney Wick Interchange where the carriageways split and the northbound carriageway has a right hand entrance. When the London Ringways plan was being proposed, a motorway (North Cross Route) was to end here and the M11 was meant to extend from its current terminus on the A406 through this junction and to Angel.
The A12 heads to Lea.
The section from the Lea Interchange to Leytonstone, also known as the M11 Link road, was built in the 1990s in the face of a major road protest. During this work the old section as far as Wanstead was rebuilt as a dual carriageway. Prior to that, the A12 started at the Green Man Roundabout at Leytonstone, and was single carriageway west of Wanstead Underground station. It now has an underpass at that roundabout, which again is a junction with the old A11.
East of Wanstead, the A12 runs roughly due east. It is known as Eastern Avenue, then Eastern Avenue West and Eastern Avenue East, built in the 1920s as a bypass for the section of the Roman road from Colchester to London running through Ilford and Romford (today&#x27;s A118). The eastern end of the Eastern Avenue is Gallows Corner in the London Borough of Havering, just east of Romford. The junction also marks the start-point of the A127 Southend Arterial Road, also 1920s vintage. At the roundabout, an extemporised two-lane flyover still provides priority for A12 eastbound to A127 traffic (and vice versa). However, the A12 now veers roughly north-eastward, because it starts to follow the course of the Roman road; the Romans started building this road from Colchester, their original capital for the province. However, the stretch from Gallows Corner to the junction with the M25 motorway, called Colchester Road, is still perfectly straight. The M25 junction is number 28; it also marks where the A12 crosses the boundary from London to Essex.

===Essex===
Originally, the A12 followed the route of the Roman road closely and so was fairly straight, but there are now several town bypasses, so the road through Essex now has several meanders. The A12 formerly went through Brentwood, Mountnessing, Ingatestone, Margaretting, Chelmsford, Boreham, Hatfield Peverel, Witham, Kelvedon, Copford, Stanway and Colchester, but these are all now bypassed, and the A12 is a dual carriageway with mostly grade-separated junctions for its whole length in Essex.

It is this stretch of the A12, particularly between Chelmsford and Colchester, which has led to the poor reputation for surface quality of the A12. This is mainly for its bumpy or potholed surface, mostly due to worn concrete surfaces. In an ongoing process these sections are being relaid with tarmac, however some sections including the Kelvedon bypass, and between Copford and Stanway have yet to be resurfaced.

Built in 1982, the A12 Colchester bypass provides an uninterrupted dual carriageway where the national speed limit of 70 mph applies. Before 1982, the A12 took a route much closer to Colchester itself, and although still a bypass it consisted of urban single carriageways with roundabouts and pedestrian crossings. The old bypass is still in existence – the western half now forms part of the A1124 and the eastern half part of the A133.

===Suffolk===
The Suffolk stretch of the A12 starts with the Capel St Mary bypass. Originally the route from the Northern end of this bypass ran through the villages of Washbrook and Copdock and into Ipswich. When Ipswich&#x27;s Southern by-pass was built in the early 1980s, the route picked up from the northern Capel St Mary junction (now numbered 32b), to pass to the West of the original line – this allowed the relevant ground works and interchanges to be completed with minimal traffic disruption. The old dual carriageway through Washbrook and Copdock is blocked off at White&#x27;s Corner and was renumbered to be the C475. A footpath still exists which enables passage underneath the A14.

The old route through Ipswich was renumbered as the A1214 following construction of the Ipswich Southern By-pass. The old route is more locally known by the road names, notably &quot;London Road&quot; to the Town Centre and Woodbridge Road out the other side. The Ipswich Southern By-pass allows the A12 to overlap the A14 to Seven Hills Interchange, from the Copdock junction, where the A12 reappears and heads North. As the A14 the road passes over the large Orwell Bridge with total length of 1,287 metres. This has a summit at 43 metres above the river giving a humped feel with reduced visibility for traffic. There are at-grade roundabout junctions past BT Adastral Park at Martlesham and around the Woodbridge bypass.

For most of its remaining length through Suffolk the A12 is a mostly single carriageway road, and in many places its speed limit is less than the national limit, for example as it passes through towns and villages. During 2003/2004 some of these speed restrictions were further reduced from to . There are, though, a few stretches of dual carriageway between the Woodbridge bypass and Lowestoft (at Wickham Market, Saxmundham, Wangford and Kessingland). This section of the A12 was detrunked in 2001 as part of the Highways Agency&#x27;s streamlining of its Trunk Road Network. Control was therefore passed to the local authorities. Just south of Blythburgh, the old milestone shows it is to London.

The A12 ran through Lowestoft for about on urban limited roads. However, as of June 2006, the A12 now follows the course of the new single carriageway Southern Relief Road that joins the A47 at Lowestoft Bascule Bridge. In June 2024, a small segment of the B1531 was renumbered the A12 and upgraded with a new roundabout junction and 50m of dual carriageway. The A12 is now carried over the river by a new third river crossing, the Gull Wing Bridge, where it meets the former A1117 which was renumbered as the A12. This carries the A12 via the towns Northern Relief Roads to the A47 near to Corton, where the A12 terminates. 

===Norfolk===

From February 2017, the A12 no longer reaches Norfolk as it terminates in Lowestoft at . Before February 2017, From a point just south west of the mouth of the River Yare, northwards to the point where it crosses the River Yare in Great Yarmouth, the A12 followed the route originally used by the railway line from Lowestoft to its terminus north of Breydon Bridge at Vauxhall Roundabout where the A47 previously terminated.

==Proposed Improvements==

=== 2008 Technology Upgrades ===
In November 2008 the government announced a £60 million technology package including variable message signs, CCTV, Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras and automatic incident detection sensors embedded in the road surface to improve journey reliability, reduce delays and give better information to drivers. Work is due to start in 2011/12.

=== 1986 Proposed Bypasses ===
A bypass for various villages was proposed in 1986 as part of the government&#x27;s 1989 Roads for Prosperity white paper which detailed many road schemes across the country. Suffolk county council considered a bypass for the villages of Farnham, Stratford St Andrew, Glemham and Marlesford for the 2006 Local Transport Plan. The scheme will not be implemented until after 2016. Essex county council has put forwards plans for a bypass of Chelmsford connecting Junction 19 of the A12 to the A131. Plans to upgrade additional sections of the A120 into a dual two-lane carriageway were scrapped in 2009.

==2008 inquiry==
In response to this increasing congestion, Essex County Council announced it would hold an A12 inquiry which was tasked with deciding how to improve the A12 and prevent the congestion. The inquiry was headed by Sir David Rowlands, KCB, a former Permanent Secretary at the Department for Transport, with professor Stephen Glaister, David Quarmby and Lord Whitty, all with significant knowledge of the transport sector.

The inquiry began taking submissions in April 2008. The Inquiry, the first ever local council sponsored inquiry into a major trunk road, heard from 24 organisations and 36 witnesses over three days including Department for Transport and Highways Agency officials, MPs, local and regional agencies and authorities, the emergency services, business and motoring groups. Comments were also received from over two hundred members of the public and through a petition organised by the Essex Chronicle newspaper. The commissions finding were published in July 2008 and its outline recommendations are:

* the A12 as far as Ipswich should be brought up to modern dual 2-lane standards (where not already dual-3), with urgent priority given to the Hatfield Peverel – Marks Tey section
* substandard lay-bys should be replaced; one or more locations off but near the A12 should be identified for secure HGV parking, and an HGV overtaking ban should be trialled
* a wide range of short term practical measures should be introduced to improve safety and reduce driver stress, such as selective speed limits and better information for drivers, and to improve the recovery from incidents and closures
* a New Route Management Strategy should be drawn up by the Highways Agency, in collaboration with local stakeholders, and an &#x27;A12 Alliance&#x27; should be formed to consolidate and sustain the momentum for improvement

<text>The A61 is a major trunk road in England connecting Derby and Thirsk in North Yorkshire by way of Alfreton, Clay Cross, Chesterfield, Sheffield, Barnsley, Wakefield, Leeds, Harrogate and Ripon. The road is closely paralleled by the M1 motorway between Derby and Leeds.

==Route==

Heading south, the road begins as single carriageway from Thirsk which bypasses Ripon and travels towards Harrogate, eventually passing through Harrogate town centre. Here, the road divides into two major one-way streets which enclose the town centre and run along The Stray, a stretch of grassland in Harrogate. As Leeds Road, it then passes through the southern suburbs of Harrogate before meeting the A658 near the village of Pannal. The A61 continues through Harewood before approaching the north&#x27;s metropolis, where a sudden urban fringe approaches. As the road enters Leeds and crosses the A6120 outer ring road, the road becomes Scott Hall Road, a main dual carriageway (or Trunk Road) and artery for north Leeds. There are sections of guided bus route using kerb guidance near Potternewton. Here, the A61 rises slightly, and a panoramic view of Leeds skyline is revealed. The descent into Leeds is quick and the road soon turns into a multi-lane road, as it approaches Sheepscar Interchange. Fast-flowing traffic is directed onto the A61, although some traffic is directed off the A61 to avoid Leeds City Centre as it routes around the back of Quarry House. The A61 meets it shortly after, as it shares the city centre loop for a short distance. After crossing the river, the road splits again before taking traffic out to the motorways. The road then continues out of Leeds towards Wakefield and Barnsley. South of Barnsley it crosses the M1 at Junction 36 then heads towards Sheffield. Between the M1 at Junction 36 and the Westwood roundabout intersection with the A616, the road is designated as a trunk road under the responsibility of National Highways.
The A61 travels into Sheffield through Grenoside and Hillsborough, passing next to the Sheffield Wednesday football stadium as Penistone Road. It continues down to Shalesmoor and at this point it forms a major artery into the City Centre from the north, becoming the Sheffield Inner Ring Road (which is labelled as A61 all the way around). It meets the A57 twice; at Park Square and Brookhill roundabout. At Junction 4 (Bramall Lane) of the Sheffield Inner Ring Road, is a spur road the A621 – Bramall Lane, this road takes you past the western side of Sheffield United&#x27;s stadium and back onto the A61 as Queens Road. The A621 is used as a shortcut, instead of continuing on the Sheffield Inner Ring Road to Junction 3 (Granville Square), where it meets Queens Road further north. The A61 then continues through Heeley as Chesterfield Road and climbs up to Norton and onto Bowshaw roundabout. Between Sheffield and Chesterfield it is a dual carriageway, avoids Dronfield and Unstone as the eponymous by-pass. The road used to go through Chesterfield town centre, passing by the famous crooked spire, but was heavily congested. This was alleviated by the construction of the Chesterfield bypass in the 1980s on the alignment of the former Great Central Railway. The road reverts to single carriageway south of Chesterfield, passing through Clay Cross and Alfreton.
South of Alfreton, the A61 merges with the dual carriageway A38, but the old A61 continues as the B6179 through Swanwick and Denby, meeting the A38 again just north of the city. The A61 road continues towards the city centre along Sir Frank Whittle Road until it finally ends at the junction with the A52 near to the headquarters of Derbyshire County Cricket Club.

==Road safety==
In June 2008 a stretch of the A61 between Barnsley and Wakefield was named as the most dangerous road in Britain, when motorcycle accidents were excluded. In the latest EuroRAP findings from the Road Safety Foundation, this stretch of road was also found to be the most dangerous road in Yorkshire and Humber. With 22 fatal and serious injury accidents in the three years analysed (2004–2006), this single carriageway route was rated as Red – the second highest risk category.

<text>The Poles come from different West Slavic tribes living on territories belonging later to Poland in the early Middle Ages.

== Kingdom of Poland (966–1569) ==
Around the year 1000, the population of the Duchy of Poland is estimated at 1,000,000 to 1,250,000. Around 1370 Poland had 2 million inhabitants with a population density of 8.6 per square kilometer. Poland was less affected by the Black Death than Western Europe.

Although the population of the Kingdom of Poland in late Middle Ages consisted mostly of Poles, the influx of other cultures was significant: particularly notable were Jewish and German settlers, who often formed significant minorities or even majorities in urban centers. Sporadically migrants from other places like Scotland, and Netherlands settled in Poland as well. At that time other notable minorities included various incompletely assimilated people from other Slavic tribes (some of whom would eventually merge totally into the Polish people, while others merged into neighboring nations).

Around 1490, the combined population of Poland and Lithuania, in a personal union (the Polish–Lithuanian union) since the Union of Krewo a century before, is estimated at 8 million. An estimate for 1493 gives the combined population of Poland and Lithuania at 7.5 million (including 3.9 million in the Kingdom of Poland), breaking them down by ethnicity at 3.25 million Poles, 3.75 million Ruthenians and 0.5 million Lithuanians. The Ruthenians composed most of the population of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania: this is the reason that the late GDL is often called a Slavic country, alongside Poland, Russia, etc. In time, the adjective &quot;Lithuanian&quot; came to denote a Slav of the Grand Duchy.

Eventually, the Lithuanian speakers came to be known as Samogitians (see also Samogitian nobility), after the province in which they were the dominant majority. Another estimate for the combined population at the beginning of the 16th century gives 7.5 million, roughly split evenly, due to the much larger territory of the Grand Duchy (with about 10-15 people per square km in Poland and 3-5 people per square km in the Grand Duchy, and even less in the south-east Cossack borderlands). By 1500, about 15% of Poland&#x27;s population lived in urban centers (settlements with over 500 people).


== Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795) ==
By 1600, about 25% of Poland&#x27;s population lived in urban centers (settlements with over 500 people). Major towns in Poland included: Gdańsk (70,000), Kraków (28,000), Warsaw (20,000-30,000), Poznań (20,000), Lwów (Lviv) (20,000), Elbląg (Elbing) (15,000), Toruń (Thorn) (12,000), Sandomierz (4,000-5,000), Kazimierz Dolny (4,000-5,000) and Gniezno (4,000-5,000).

The population of the Commonwealth of both nations was never overwhelmingly either Roman Catholic or Polish. This resulted from Poland&#x27;s possession of Ukraine and federation with Lithuania; in both these countries ethnic Poles were a distinct minority. The Commonwealth comprised primarily four nations: Poles, Lithuanians, and Ukrainians and Belarusians (the latter two usually referred to together as Ruthenians). Shortly after the Union of Lublin (1569), at the turn of the 16th to 17th century, the Commonwealth population was around 7 million, with a rough breakdown of 4.5m Poles, 0.75m Lithuanians, 0.7m Jews and 2m Ruthenians. In 1618, after the Truce of Deulino the Commonwealth population increased together with its territory, reaching 12 million that could be roughly divided into: Poles – 4.5m, Ukrainians – 3.5m, Belarusians – 1.5m, Lithuanians – 0.75m, Prussians – 0.75m, Jews – 0.5m, Livonians – 0.5m; at that time nobility formed 10% and burghers, 15%. Population losses of 1648–1667 are estimated at 4m. Coupled with further population and territorial losses, by 1717 the Commonwealth population had fallen to 9m: roughly 4.5m Poles, 1.5m Ukrainians, 1.2m Belarusians, 0.8m Lithuanians, 0.5m Jews, 0.5m others The urban population was hit hard, falling to below 10%.

From 1648 to 1660, the Commonwealth lost between 30% and 50% of its population. During the Great Northern War, Poland&#x27;s population contracted by 25% in 1709–1711.

To be &quot;Polish&quot;, in the non-Polish lands of the Commonwealth, was then much less an index of ethnicity than of religion and rank; it was a designation largely reserved for the landed noble class (szlachta), which included Poles but also many members of non-Polish origin who converted to Catholicism in increasing numbers with each following generation. For the non-Polish nobility such conversion meant a final step of Polonization that followed the adoption of the Polish language and culture. Poland, as the culturally most advanced part of the Commonwealth, with the royal court, the capital, the largest cities, the second-oldest university in Central Europe (after Prague), and the more liberal and democratic social institutions proved an irresistible magnet for the non-Polish nobility in the Commonwealth.

As a result, in the eastern territories a Polish (or Polonized) aristocracy dominated a peasantry whose great majority was neither Polish nor Roman Catholic. Moreover, the decades of peace brought huge colonization efforts to Ukraine, heightening the tensions among nobles, Jews, Cossacks (traditionally Orthodox), Polish and Ruthenian peasants. The latter, deprived of their native protectors among the Ruthenian nobility, turned for protection to cossacks that facilitated violence that in the end broke the Commonwealth. The tensions were aggravated by conflicts between Eastern Orthodoxy and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church following the Union of Brest, overall discrimination of Orthodox religions by dominant Catholicism, and several Cossack uprisings. In the west and north, many cities had sizable German minorities, often belonging to Reformed churches. The Commonwealth had also one of the largest Jewish diasporas in the world.

Until the Reformation, the &quot;szlachta&quot; were mostly Catholic or Eastern Orthodox. However, many families quickly adopted the Reformed religion. After the Counter-Reformation, when the Roman Catholic Church regained power in Poland, the &quot;szlachta&quot; became almost exclusively Roman Catholic, despite the fact that Roman Catholicism was not a majority religion (the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches counted approximately 40% of the population each, while the remaining 20% were Jews and members of various Protestant churches). The Counter-Reformation in Poland, influenced by the Commonwealth tradition of religious tolerance, was based mostly on Jesuit propaganda, and was very peaceful when compared to excesses such as the Thirty Years&#x27; War elsewhere in Europe.

In the late 18th century, the first statistical estimates of Commonwealth population appeared. Aleksander Busching estimated the number of Commonwealth population for 8.5 million; Józef Wybicki in 1777 for 5,391,364; Stanisław Staszic in 1785 for 6 million; and Fryderyk Moszyński in 1789 for 7,354,620. Modern estimates tend to be higher; by 1770, on the eve of the partitions, Commonwealth had a population of about 11m-14m, about 10% of that - Jewish. The nobility constituted about 10%, the burghers, about 7-8%.

== Partitions (1795–1918) ==

By the First Partition in 1772, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth lost about 211 000 km2 (30% of its territory, amounting at that time to about 733 000 km2), with a population of over four to five million people (about a third of its population of 14 million before the partitions).

After the Second Partition, Commonwealth lost about 307 000 km2, being reduced to 223 000 km2. Only about 4 million people remained in Poland at that time, which makes for a loss of another third of its original population, about a half of the remaining.

After the Third Partition, overall, Austria had gained about 18 percent of the former Commonwealth territory (130,000 km2) and about 32 percent of the population (3.85 million people). Prussia had gained about 20 percent of the former Commonwealth territory 149,000 km2) and about 23 percent of the population (2.6 million people). Russia had gained about 62 percent of the former Commonwealth territory (462,000 km2) and about 45 percent of the population (3.5 million people).

An estimate for 1815 gives 11.5 million Poles, out of which 5m were under Russian control (4 million in Congress Poland and 1 million in the territories incorporated into the Russian Empire), 3.5m in the Prussian partition territories and 3m in the Austrian partition territories.

Congress Poland had a population of about 4.25 million around 1830. In the Russian partition, the Pale of Settlement resulted in resettlement of many Russian Jews to the western fringes of Russian Empire, which now included part of Poland. This further increased the sizable community of Polish Jews. By 1914, about 31 million people inhabited the territories that would become the Second Polish Republic, the First World War saw the population of those territories drop to 26 million.
== Second Polish Republic and World War II (1918–1945) ==
Before World War II, the Polish lands were noted for the variety of their ethnic communities. Following the Polish-Soviet War, a large part of its population belonged to national minorities. The census of that year allocates 30.8% of the population in the minority. In 1931, the population of Poland was 31,916,000, including 15,428,000 males and 16,488,000 females. By January 1939, the population of Poland increased to 35,100,000. This total included 240,000 in Trans-Olza which was under Polish control from October 1938 until August 1939. The population density was 90 persons per square km. In 1921, 24% of the population lived in towns and cities, by 1931 the ratio grew to 27%. Altogether, in 1921, there were 611 towns and cities in the country, by 1931 there were 636 municipalities. The six biggest cities of Poland (as of 1 January 1939) were Warsaw, Łódź, Lwów, Poznań, Kraków and Vilnius (Wilno). In 1931, Poland had the second largest Jewish population in the world, and one-fifth of all Jews resided within Poland&#x27;s borders (approx. 3,136,000, roughly 10% of the entire Polish population).

According to historian Norman Davies the Polish census of 1931 listed the nationalities by language as Polish, 69% of the population, Ukrainian, 15%, Jews 8.5%, Belarusian, 4.70%, German, 2.2%, Russian 0.25%, Lithuanian, 0.25%, Czech 0.09%, Norman Davies included the Ruthenians with the Ukrainians however the Polish census figures list them as separate group with 3.82% of the population. The classification of the ethnic groups in Poland during the Second Polish Republic is a disputed topic, Tadeusz Piotrowski maintains that the 1931 Polish census &quot;involved questionable methodology, especially the use of mother tongue as an indicator of nationality&quot;, noting that it had underestimated the number of non-Poles. The official figures for nationality from the 1931 Polish census based on the mother tongue put the percentage of ethnic Poles at 68.9%, Jews 8.6% and other minority groups 22.5%. Piotrowski cited a study by the Polish historian Jerzy Tomaszewski that puts that the adjusted census figures (taking religious affiliation into account) of ethnic Poles at 64.7%, Jews 9.8% and other minority groups 25.5% of Poland&#x27;s population. Polish demographer Piotr Eberhardt maintains that it is commonly agreed that the criterion of declared language to classify ethnic groups led to an overestimation of the number of Poles in pre-war Poland. He notes that in general, the numbers declaring a particular language do not mesh with the numbers declaring the corresponding nationality. Members of ethnic minority groups believe that the language criterion led to an overestimation of Poles.

The detailed figures for the census published by the Polish government provided a breakdown by religion for the various language groups, the details of the Polish census of 1931 published by the Central Statistical Office the Polish Republic according to language and religion are as follows.:

In the southeast, Ukrainian settlements were present in the regions east of Chełm and in the Carpathians east of Nowy Sącz. The three main native highlander populations were Łemkowie, Bojkowie and Huculi. In all the towns and cities there were large concentrations of Yiddish-speaking Jews. The Polish ethnographic area stretched eastward: in eastern Lithuania, Belarus, and western Ukraine, all of which had a mixed population, Poles predominated not only in the cities but also in numerous rural districts. There were significant Polish minorities in Daugavpils (in Latvia), Minsk (in Belarus), Bucovina (in Romania), and Kyiv (in Ukraine) (see Polish minority in the Soviet Union, Polish Autonomous District).

=== Second World War (1939–1945) ===
:&quot;See supplements: Occupation of Poland, World War II crimes in Poland, Holocaust in Poland&quot;

In the beginning of the war (September 1939) the territory of Poland was divided between the Nazi Germany and the USSR. By late-1941 following Operation Barbarossa Nazi Germany controlled the entire territory of the former Second Polish Republic, but in 1944-1945 the Red Army&#x27;s offensive claimed the region for the USSR.

After both occupiers divided the territory of Poland between themselves, they conducted a series of actions aimed at suppression of Polish culture and repression of much of the Polish people. In August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated Poland&#x27;s dead (including Polish Jews) at between 5.47 and 5.67 million (due to German actions) and 150,000 (due to Soviet), or around 5.62 and 5.82 million total. About 90% of Polish Jews were killed during the Holocaust; many others emigrated in the succeeding years.
1. Population 1939 -Polish sources allocate the population by the primary language spoken, not by religion. Most Jews spoke Yiddish, however included with the Poles are about 200,000 Polish speaking Jews who are classified with the Polish group. Included with the Poles are 1,300,000 Eastern Orthodox &amp; Greek Catholic adherents who are sometimes classified with the Ukrainian and Belarusian groups.

2. Natural Increase October 1939-December 1945 -After the war Polish demographers calculated the estimated natural population growth that occurred during the war.

3. Transfer of German Population Most of the ethnic German population fled during the war. Many of them were sent to forced labour.. In 1950 only about 40,000 of the pre-war ethnic German group remained in Poland in 1950, most of whom emigrated later in the 1950s. Others were also expelled .

4. War Dead In August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) put the figure of Poland&#x27;s dead at between 5,620,000 and 5,820,000. The IPN&#x27;s figures include 3 million Polish Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust (200,000 included with Polish speakers); as well as Poles killed in 1943-44 during the massacres of Poles in Volhynia. The figures also include 150,000 victims of Soviet repression.

Deaths Due to German Occupation
Poles-The Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) figure for deaths of Poles due to the German occupation is 2,770,000. This figure includes &quot;Direct War Losses&quot; -543,000; &quot;Murdered in Camps and in Pacification&quot; -506,000; &quot;Deaths in prisons and Camps&quot; 1,146,000; &quot;Deaths outside of prisons and Camps&quot; 473,000; &quot;Murdered in Eastern Regions&quot; 100,000; &quot;Deaths in other countries&quot; 2,000. These figures include about 200,000 Polish speaking Jews who are considered Poles in Polish sources.

Jews-Polish researchers have determined that the Nazis murdered 1,860,000 Polish Jews in the extermination camps in Poland, plus another 1.0 million Polish Jewish deaths in prisons and ghettos. In addition 970,000 Jews from other nations were murdered in the Nazi extermination camps in Poland.

In the Polish figures of war dead are included 2.0 million Polish citizens of the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union, that were occupied by German Nazy forces after 22 June 1941. Contemporary Russian sources include these losses with Soviet war deaths.

Deaths Due to Soviet Occupation

The Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated that 150,000 Polish citizens were executed due to Soviet repressions or died during deportations. Since the collapse of the USSR, Polish scholars have been able to do research in the Soviet archives on Polish losses during the Soviet occupation. Andrzej Paczkowski puts the number of Polish deaths at 90–100,000 of the 1.0 million persons deported and 30,000 executed by the Soviets.

5. Population Remaining in the USSR The number of Poles and Jews who remained in the USSR after the war was estimated at 1.4 million by Polish scholar and historian Krystyna Kersten. Included with the Poles remaining in the USSR are about 700,000 Eastern Orthodox &amp; Greek Catholic adherents who are sometimes classified with the Ukrainian and Belarusian groups.

6. Emigration to the West Poles and Jews who remained in non communist countries after the war.

7. Population gain Recovered Territories Germans remaining in Poland after the war in the Recovered Territories. This group included 1,130,000 bi-lingual Polish-German persons who declared their allegiance to Poland. Also remaining in 1950 were 94,000 German nationals, 36,000 Germans from pre-war Danzig and 1,500 ethnic Germans of other nations. Most of this group emigrated to Germany after 1956. The ethnic German population remaining in the 1990s was about 300,000.

8. Reimmigration 1946-50 Poles resident in western Europe before the war, primarily in Germany and France, who returned to Poland after the war.

9. Natural Increase 1946-1950 This is the official Polish government data for births and natural deaths from January 1946 until the census of December 1950.

10. Population December 1950 Per Census The total population per the December 1950 census was 25 million. A breakdown by ethnic group was not given. However, we can estimate the Jewish population based on the postwar census taken by the Jewish community. Data for the Germans and others who remained in Poland after the war can be estimated using the 1946 Polish census

==Post-Second World War (1945–present)==

===Early post-war period===
Before World War II, a third of Poland&#x27;s population was composed of ethnic minorities. After the war, however, Poland&#x27;s minorities were mostly gone, due to the 1945 revision of borders, and the Holocaust. Under the National Repatriation Office (&quot;Państwowy Urząd Repatriacyjny&quot;), millions of Poles were forced to leave their homes in the eastern Kresy region and settle in the western former German territories. At the same time approximately 5 million remaining Germans (about 8 million had already fled or had been expelled and about 1 million had been killed in 1944–46) were similarly expelled from those territories into the Allied occupation zones. Ukrainian and Belarusian minorities found themselves now mostly within the borders of the Soviet Union; those who opposed this new policy (like the Ukrainian Insurgent Army in the Bieszczady Mountains region) were suppressed by the end of 1947 in the Operation Vistula.

The population of Jews in Poland, which formed the largest Jewish community in pre-war Europe at about 3.3 million people, was all but destroyed by 1945. Approximately 3 million Jews died of starvation in ghettos and labor camps, were slaughtered at the German Nazi extermination camps or by the Einsatzgruppen death squads. Between 40,000 and 100,000 Polish Jews survived the Holocaust in Poland, and another 50,000 to 170,000 were repatriated from the Soviet Union, and 20,000 to 40,000 from Germany and other countries. At its postwar peak, there were 180,000 to 240,000 Jews in Poland, settled mostly in Warsaw, Łódź, Kraków and Wrocław.

Poland&#x27;s population diminished from 35 million in 1939 to just under 24 million in 1946. According to the national census, which took place on 14 February 1946, the number of inhabitants was 23,930,000, out of which 32% lived in cities and towns, and 68% lived in the countryside. The 1950 census (3 December 1950) showed the population rise to 25,008,000, and the 1960 census (6 December 1960) placed the population of Poland at 29,776,000. In 1950, Warsaw was the biggest city of the country, with population of 804,000. Second was Lodz (pop. 620,000), third Kraków (pop. 344,000), fourth Poznan (pop. 321,000), and fifth Wroclaw (pop. 309,000).

Females were in the majority in the country. In 1931, there were 105.6 women for 100 men. In 1946, the difference grew to 118.5/100, but in subsequent years, number of males grew, and in 1960, the ratio was 106.7/100.

===Current situation===
Most Germans were expelled from Poland and the annexed east German territories at the end of the war, while many Ukrainians, Rusyns and Belarusians lived in territories incorporated into the USSR. Small Ukrainian, Belarusian, Slovak, and Lithuanian minorities reside along the borders, and a German minority is concentrated near the southwestern city of Opole and in Masuria. Groups of Ukrainians and Polish Ruthenians also live in western Poland, where they were forcefully resettled by communists.

As a result of the migrations and the Soviet Unions radically altered borders under the rule of Joseph Stalin, the population of Poland became one of the most ethnically homogeneous in the world. Virtually all people in Poland claim Polish nationality, with Polish as their native tongue. Ukrainians resp. Rusyns, the largest minority group, are scattered in various northern districts. Lesser numbers of Belarusians and Lithuanians live in areas adjoining Belarus and Lithuania. The Jewish community, almost entirely Polonized, has been greatly reduced. In Silesia a significant segment of the population, of mixed Polish and German ancestry, tends to declare itself as Polish or German according to political circumstances. Minorities of Germans remain in Pomerania, Silesia, East Prussia, and Lubus.

Small populations of Polish Tatars still exist. Some Polish towns, mainly in northeastern Poland have mosques. Tatars arrived as mercenary soldiers beginning in the late 14th century. The Tatar population reached approximately 100,000 in 1630 but is less than 500 in 2000. See also Islam in Poland.

A recent large migration of Poles took place following Poland&#x27;s accession to the European Union and opening of the EU&#x27;s labor market; with an approximate number of 2 million primarily young Poles taking up jobs abroad.

<text>The Norton Motorcycle Company (formerly Norton Motorcycles.) is a brand of motorcycles headquartered in Solihull, West Midlands, (originally based in Birmingham), England. For some years around 1990, the rights to use the name on motorcycles were owned by North American financiers. Currently it is owned by Indian motorcycle giant TVS Motor Company.

The business was founded in 1898 as a &quot;fittings and parts for the two-wheel trade&quot; manufacturer. By 1902 the company had begun manufacturing motorcycles with bought-in engines. In 1908 a Norton-built engine was added to the range. This began a long series of production of single and eventually twin-cylinder motorcycles, and a long history of racing involvement. During the Second World War Norton produced almost 100,000 of the military Model 16 H and Big 4 sidevalve motorcycles.

Associated Motor Cycles bought the company in 1953. It was reformed as Norton-Villiers, part of Manganese Bronze Holdings, in 1966, and merged with BSA to form Norton Villiers Triumph in 1973.

In late 2008, Stuart Garner, a UK businessman, bought the rights to Norton from some US concerns and relaunched Norton in its then-new Midlands home at Donington Park where it was to develop the 961cc Norton Commando and a new range of Norton motorcycles.

The company went into administration in January 2020. In April 2020, administrators BDO agreed to sell certain aspects of Garner&#x27;s business to a new business with links to Indian motorcycle producer TVS Motor Company.

==Early history==

The original company was formed by James Lansdowne Norton (known as &quot;Pa&quot;) at 320, Bradford Street, Birmingham, in 1898. In 1902 Norton began building motorcycles with French and Swiss engines. In 1907 a Norton with Peugot engine, ridden by Rem Fowler, won the twin-cylinder class in the first Isle of Man TT race, beginning a sporting tradition that went on until the 1960s. In April 1907 the Norton Manufacturing Co. moved to a larger factory at Deritend Bridge, Floodgate Street, Birmingham. The first Norton engines were made in 1907, with production models available from 1908. These were the 3.5 hp (490 cc) and the &#x27;Big 4&#x27; (633cc), beginning a line of side-valve single-cylinder engines which continued with few changes until the late 1950s.

The first Norton logo was a fairly simple, art nouveau design, with the name spelled in capitals. However, a new logo appeared on the front of the catalogue for 1914, which was a joint effort by James Norton and his daughter Ethel. It became known as the &quot;curly N&quot; logo, with only the initial letter as a capital, and was used by the company thereafter, first appearing on actual motorcycles in 1915.

In 1913 the business declined, and R. T. Shelley &amp; Co., the main creditors, intervened and saved it. Norton Motors Ltd was formed shortly afterwards under joint directorship of James Norton and Bob Shelley. Shelley&#x27;s brother-in-law was tuner Dan O&#x27;Donovan, and he managed to set a significant number of records on the Norton by 1914 when the war broke out - and as competition motorcycling was largely suspended during the hostilities, these records still stood when production restarted after the war. 1914 Dan O&#x27;Donovan records set in April 1914 :
* Under 500 cc flying km 81.06 mph, flying mile 78.60 mph - 490 cc Norton
* Under 750 cc flying km and flying mile see above
* Under 500 cc with sidecar flying km 65.65 mph, flying mile 62.07 mph - 490 cc Norton
* Under 750 cc with sidecar flying km and flying mile see above
On 17 July 1914 O&#x27;Donovan also took the flying 5 mile record at 75.88 mph, and the standing start 10 mile record at 73.29 mph, again on the 490 cc Norton.

==First World War==
Norton continued production of their 3.5 hp and Big 4 singles well into the war period, though in November 1916 the Ministry of Munitions issued an order that no further work on motor cycles or cars would be allowed from 15 November 1916 without a permit. By this time most motor cycle companies were already either producing munitions (or aircraft parts), or devoted to the export trade. Norton were involved in exporting and earlier that year had announced a new &#x27;Colonial Model&#x27; of their 633cc Big 4. This featured an increase in ground clearance from 4.25&quot; to 6.5&quot;, by altering the frame, larger tank, greater clearance on mudguards, and a sturdy rear carrier. The engine was unaltered, and transmission was via a Sturmey-Archer 3-speed gearbox.

In February 1918, &quot;Motor Cycle&quot; reported on a visit to Norton Motors. Mr Norton had stated that he expected three post-war models, the 3.5 hp 490 cc TT with belt drive (for the &#x27;speed merchant&#x27;), and two utility mounts, one with detuned TT engine, and the other being the Big Four for very heavy solo or sidecar work, both of these with three-speed Sturmey-Archer countershaft gearbox and all chain drive. It was also stated that he had been experimenting with aluminium pistons, and that Norton had produced a book of driving hints which also contained details of their Military and Empire models.

In May 1918, Norton stated in one of their adverts that &#x27;The ministry are taking the whole of our present output, but we have a waiting list&#x27;; this advert also uses the &quot;Unapproachable Norton&quot; phrase. Few Norton WD models appear in the For Sale column of &quot;The Motor Cycle&quot; after the war, suggesting they were shipped abroad, apparently one order going to the Russian Army . The 1913–1917 Red Book listing UK Motor, Marine and Aircraft production shows Norton dropped from a full range in 1916, to only the Military Big Four in 1917.

==Inter-War years==

Norton resumed deliveries of civilian motorcycles in April 1919 with models aimed at motorcyclists who enjoyed the reliability and performance offered by long-stroke single-cylinder engines with separate gearboxes.

Norton also resumed racing and in 1924 the Isle of Man Senior TT was the first win with a race average speed over 60 mph, rider Alec Bennett. Norton won this event ten times until they withdrew from racing in 1938.

J.L. Norton died in 1925 aged only 56, but he saw his motorcycles win the Senior and sidecar TTs in 1924, specifically with the 500 cc Model 18, Norton&#x27;s first overhead valve single.

Designed by Walter Moore, the Norton CS1 OHC engine appeared in 1927, based closely on the ES2 pushrod engine and using many of its parts. Moore was hired away to NSU in 1930, after which Arthur Carroll designed an entirely new OHC engine destined to become the basis for all later OHC and DOHC Norton singles. (Moore&#x27;s move to NSU prompted his former staff to quip NSU stood for &quot;Norton Spares Used&quot;) The Norton racing legend began in the 1930s. Of the nine Isle of Man Senior TTs (500 cc) between 1931 and 1939, Norton won seven.

Until 1934 Norton bought Sturmey-Archer gearboxes and clutches. When Sturmey discontinued production Norton bought the design rights and had them made by Burman, a manufacturer of proprietary gearboxes.

==Second World War==

Norton started making military motorcycles again in 1936 after a tender process in 1935 where a modified Norton 16H beat contenders. From 900 in 1936 to 2000 in 1937, Norton was ahead of the competition as war loomed, and there was good reason in terms of spares and maintenance for the military to keep to the same model. Between 1937 and 1945 nearly a quarter (over 100,000) of all British military motorcycles were Nortons, basically the WD 16H (solo) and WD Big Four outfit with driven sidecar wheel.

==Post-war==

The Isle of Man Senior TT successes continued after the war, with Nortons winning every year from 1947 to 1954.

After the Second World War, Norton reverted to civilian motorcycle production, gradually increasing its range. A major addition in 1949 was the twin cylinder Model 7, known as the Norton Dominator, a pushrod 500 cc twin-cylinder machine designed by Bert Hopwood. Its chassis was derived from the ES2 single, with telescopic front and plunger rear suspension, and an updated version of the gearbox known as the &quot;lay-down&quot; box. More shapely mudguards and tanks completed the more modern styling to Nortons new premium model twin.

Norton struggled to reclaim its pre-WWII racing dominance as the single-cylinder machine faced fierce competition from the multi-cylinder Italian machines and AJS from the UK. In the 1949 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season, the first year of the world championship, Norton made only fifth place and AJS won. That was before the Featherbed frame appeared, developed for Norton by the McCandless brothers of Belfast in January 1950, used in the legendary Manx Norton and raced by riders including Geoff Duke, John Surtees and Derek Minter. Very quickly the featherbed frame, a design that allowed the construction of a motorcycle with good mass-stiffness distribution, became a benchmark by which all other frames were judged.

Norton also experimented with engine placement, and discovered that moving the engine slightly up/down, forward/back, or even right/left, could deliver a &quot;sweet spot&quot; in terms of handling. Motorcycle designers still use this method to fine-tune motorcycle handling.

In 1951 the Norton Dominator was made available to export markets as the Model 88 with the Featherbed frame. Later, as production of this frame increased, it became a regular production model, and was made in variants for other models, including the OHV single-cylinder machines.

Manx Nortons also played a significant role in the development of post war car racing. At the end of 1950, the English national 500 cc regulations were adopted as the new Formula 3. The JAP Speedway engine had dominated the category initially but the Manx was capable of producing significantly more power and became the engine of choice. Many complete motorcycles were bought in order to strip the engine for 500 cc car racing, as Norton would not sell separate engines.

The racing successes were transferred to the street through cafe racers, some of which would use the featherbed frame with an engine from another manufacturer to make a hybrid machine with the best of both worlds. The most famous of these were Tritons - Triumph twin engines in a Norton featherbed frame.

==AMC==
Despite, or perhaps because of, the racing successes Norton was in financial difficulty. Reynolds could not make many of the highly desired Featherbed frames and customers lost interest in buying machines with the older frames. In 1953 Norton sold out to Associated Motorcycles (AMC), who owned the brands AJS, Matchless, Francis-Barnett and James. In 1962 the Norton factory in Bracebridge Street, Birmingham was closed and production was moved to AMC&#x27;s Woolwich factory in south-east London.

Under AMC ownership a much improved version of the Norton gearbox was developed, to be used on all the larger models of AJS, Matchless and Norton. Again, the major changes were for improved gear selection.
In September 1955 a 600 cc Dominator 99 was launched.
The 1946 to 1953 Long Stroke Manx Norton was initially SOHC, the DOHC engine becoming available to favoured racers in 1949. The Short Stroke model (1953 to 1962) had bore and stroke of . It used a dry sump 499 cc single-cylinder motor, with two valves operated by bevel drive, shaft driven twin overhead camshafts. Compression ratio was 11:1. It had an Amal GP carburettor, and a Lucas racing magneto. The 1962 500 cc Manx Nortons produced at 6,780rpm, weighed , and had a top speed of .

In 1960, a new version of the road-going Featherbed frame was developed in which the upper frame rails were bent inwards to reduce the width between the rider&#x27;s knees for greater comfort. The move was also to accommodate the shorter rider as the wide frame made it difficult to reach the ground. This frame is known as the &quot;slimline&quot; frame; the earlier frames then became known as the &quot;wideline&quot;.

The last Manx Nortons were sold in 1963. Even though Norton had pulled out of Grand Prix racing in 1954, the race-shop at Bracebridge Street continued until 1962, and the Manx became a mainstay of privateer racing, and even today are highly sought after, commanding high prices.

On 7 November 1960 the first new 650 cc Norton Manxman was launched for the American market only. By September 1961 the Norton 650SS appeared for the UK market, the 750 cc (Atlas). By 20 April 1962 for the American market as they demanded more power, but the increases to the vertical twin engine&#x27;s capacity caused a vibration problem at 5500 rpm. A 500 cc vertical twin is smoother than a single-cylinder, but if the vertical twin&#x27;s capacity is enlarged vibration increases. The 750 Norton Atlas proved too expensive and costs could not be reduced. Financial problems gathered.

There was an export bike primarily for use as a desert racer, sold up until 1969 as the Norton P11, AJS Model 33, Matchless G15 and Norton N15 which used the Norton Atlas engine in a modified Matchless G85CS scrambler frame with AMC wheels and Teledraulic front forks. This bike was reputed to vibrate less than the Featherbed frame model. AMC singles were also sold with Norton badging in this era.

Also during this period Norton developed a family of three similar smaller-capacity twin cylinder machines: first the Norton Jubilee 250 and then the Navigator 350 and the Electra 400, which had an electric starter. These models were Norton&#x27;s first use of unit construction. The engine was an entirely new design by Bert Hopwood and the frame and running gear were from the Francis-Barnett range, also owned by AMC.

==Norton-Villiers==

In 1966 AMC became insolvent and was reformed as Norton-Villiers, part of Manganese Bronze Holdings.

The 750 Norton Atlas was noted for its vibration. Rather than change engines Norton decided to change the frame, and the isolastic-framed Norton Commando 750 was the result.
In 1967 the Commando prototype was shown at the Earls Court Show in November, and introduced as a production model for 1968. Its styling, innovative isolastic frame and powerful engine made it an appealing package. The Commando easily outperformed contemporary Triumph and BSA twins and was the most powerful and best-handling British motorcycle of its day. The isolastic frame made it much smoother than the Atlas. It used rubber bushings to isolate the engine and swing arm from the frame, forks, and rider. However, as the steel-shims incorporated in the Isolastic bearings wore, often from rusting, the bike became prone to poor handling: fishtailing in high-speed turns.

The &quot;Combat&quot; engine was released in January 1972 with a twin roller bearing crank, 10:1 compression and developing at 6,500 rpm. Reliability immediately suffered, with frequent and early crank-shaft main-bearing failures, sometimes leading to broken crankshafts. Older engines had used one ball-bearing main bearing and one roller bearing main bearing but the Combat engine featured two roller bearings in a mistaken belief that this would strengthen the bottom-end to cope with the higher power-output. Instead the resultant crank-bending caused the rollers to &quot;dig-in&quot; to the races, causing rapid failure. This fragility was particularly obvious when measured against the reliability of contemporary Japanese machines. This problem was solved initially by a special roller bearing of &#x27;superblend&#x27; fame later in 1972. This was superseded by a standard high capacity roller bearing early in 1973.

In April 1973 an 8.5:1 compression 828 cc &quot;850&quot; engine was released with German FAG SuperBlend bearings. These, featuring slightly barrel-shaped rollers, had been introduced on late model 750 cc engines to cure the Combat engine&#x27;s problems of crank-flex and the consequent digging-in to the bearing-surface of the initial cylindrical bearing rollers. This model produced at 6,250 rpm but the stated power does not give a true picture of the engine performance because increased torque seemed to make up for the reduced horsepower.

The Commando was offered in several different styles: the standard street model, a pseudo-scrambler with upswept pipes and the Interstate, packaged as a tourer.

==Norton Villiers Triumph==
In 1972 BSA was also in financial trouble. It was given UK Government help on the condition that it merged with Norton-Villiers, and in 1973 the new Norton Villiers Triumph (NVT) was formed. The Triumph Motorcycles name came from BSA&#x27;s Triumph subsidiary.

1973 saw the start of development on a new machine with a monocoque pressed steel frame, that also included a 500 cc twin, stepped piston engine called the &#x27;Wulf&#x27;. However, as the Norton Villiers Triumph company was again in serious financial problems, development of the &#x27;Wulf&#x27; was dropped in favour of the rotary Wankel type engine inherited from BSA.

In 1974 the UK&#x27;s outgoing Conservative government of Edward Heath withdrew subsidies, but the incoming Labour government of Harold Wilson restored them after the General Election. Rationalisation of the factory sites to Wolverhampton and Birmingham (BSA&#x27;s Small Heath site) caused industrial disputes at Triumph&#x27;s Coventry site; Triumph would go on as a workers cooperative alone. Despite mounting losses, 1974 saw the release of the 828 Roadster, Mark 2 Hi Rider, JPN Replica (John Player Norton) and Mark 2a Interstate. In 1975 the range was down to just two models: the electric start Mark 3 Interstate and the Roadster, but then the UK Government asked for a repayment of its loan and refused export credits, further damaging the company&#x27;s ability to sell abroad. Production of the two models still made was ended and supplies dwindled.

==Wankel engine==

After the break-up of NVT, Poore established Norton Motors (1978) Ltd in the former NVT factory at Shenstone, Staffordshire to continue work on the rotary. They purchased all the wankel manufacturing equipment from Hercules/DKW who had stopped manufacturing wankel machines. 25 production prototypes of a dual rotor machine were built in 1979 with a planned production of 500 in 1980. However, Poore announced in December 1979 that the launch of the bike was delayed indefinitely due to the political situation surrounding the Triumph cooperative. The company had some success making the Wankel-engined Interpol 2 motorcycle for civilian and military police forces and the RAC which was launched in 1984.

In 1981 Lotus Cars planned to build a front-wheel drive (fwd) 2+2 car powered by a turbo version of the water cooled Norton wankel engine known as Project Nora. After negotiations with Norton it became apparent that the engine was not sufficiently developed for use. Development of the water cooled engine continued and a water cooled prototype, the P51, was built in 1984.

In a joint venture with German Norton importer Joachim &quot;Joe&quot; Seifert, Norton set up the German company Norton Motors (Deutschland) GmbH.

After Poore&#x27;s death in 1987, Manganese Bronze sold Norton to a group of investors led by Philippe LeRoux for £1.64 million, who formed Norton Group PLC.

A civilian version of the Interpol 2 was introduced named the Classic with only 100 bikes being made. Subsequent Norton Wankels were water-cooled. The Commander was launched in 1988 and was followed by the Spondon-framed F1. This model was a de-tuned replica of the Norton RCW588 factory racing machine, which won many short-distance races, but had many reliability issues requiring frequent servicing, in particular changing the primary drive chain every 100 miles.

In 1988 a new team was brought in to replace Brian Crighton&#x27;s team, to try to improve the model and reduce some of its reliability issues. The team, headed by ex-Honda-team manager Barry Symmons, Honda engineer Chris Mehew and chassis specialist Ron Williams, were tasked with producing a low-cost chassis and an engine with long-term reliability. The chassis, designed by Ron Williams and made by Harris Products, was based on Yamaha&#x27;s Delta box stamped panels. However, in spite of many innovative solutions from Chris Mehew, the team&#x27;s was unable to improve the reliability of the engine to a commercially saleable level. They quickly realized that an engine generating 1,100 °C exhaust temperatures was not the item to place under a petrol tank.

The team&#x27;s project, renamed NRS 588, did win the 1992 Isle of Man TT, ridden by Steve Hislop, North West 200, and Ulster Grand Prix races ridden by Robert Dunlop. Whilst in Northern Ireland, the team met Gordon Blair, an automotive engineer from Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. Blair commented that the Japanese had abandoned development of the motorcycle variant of the Wankel engine on two main counts: 1. As the team had realised, there was just too much heat to be confined in a motorcycle chassis. 2. The pollution created by the engine burning lubrication oil and fuel was too great to meet the impending pollution regulations without a large and costly exhaust scrubbing system. In his TV Series on British industry, Sir John Harvey-Jones commented that the company was governed more by heart than head, and the racing team were the only ones worth saving.

The F1 was succeeded by the restyled and slightly less costly F1 Sport. In 2005, a group of former Norton employees were reported to have built nine F1 Sport models from existing stocks of parts.

In 1996, Seifert and ex-Norton engineer Richard Negus registered Norton Motors Ltd in England. The following year Seifert, on behalf of Norton Motors (Deutschland) GmbH registered the Norton trademark in some European countries (Italy, Germany, Switzerland, France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands).

===Aviation engines===
In 1984, Teledyne Continental Motors licensed the Norton rotary technology for light aircraft engines. Norton continued to develop the engine for use in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).

In 1991, MidWest acquired the rights for light aviation use and based at Staverton Airport developed the MidWest AE series aero engine from the Norton twin-rotor engine.

A David Garside led management buyout of the UAV engine part of Norton led to the formation of &quot;UAV Engines Ltd&quot; in 1992, which leased part of the Shenstone site.

==North American ownership==
Chief Executive Phillippe LeRoux attempted to diversify the company to a group with interests in property and leisure. At this point the Department of Trade and Industry started to investigate improprieties in the investments of financier Philippe LeRoux and his associates following which LeRoux resigned his position as Chief Executive.

In a move to manage an outstanding debt of £7 million, in 1991 David MacDonald was appointed Chief Executive at the behest of the Midland Bank. McDonald sold the company to the Canadian company &quot;Wildrose Ventures&quot; in 1993 for around half a million pounds.

Head of Wildrose Ventures Nelson Skalbania reformed the company as Norton Motors (1993) Ltd., putting his daughter Rosanda in place as General Manager at the Shenstone site. The new ownership attempted to reclaim from public exhibition premises and place for auction with Sothebys ten historic motorcycles, estimated at the time to be worth £50,000, including a 1904 Triumph first exhibited in 1938, which had been variously distributed to National Motor Museum, Beaulieu, Science Museum, London and Coventry Transport Museum.

This proved controversial as the museums had assumed the loans had been made on a permanent basis, and former Chief Executive David MacDonald stated &quot;Without doubt anything which existed before 1984 does not belong to the present company. The assets were simply not transferred&quot;.

Wildrose Ventures was ordered by the Alberta Stock Exchange to cease trading. In 1994 ownership of the company reverted to Aquilini Investments as Skalbania was unable to repay the money he had borrowed to purchase the company. The Skalbania connection was reported as being severed by July of that year

Aquilini formed &quot;Norton Motors, International&quot;, whose principal shareholder was &quot;Global Coin Corporation&quot;, an Aquilini controlled company. To hide its assets from creditors Norton was transferred to the &quot;Norton Acquisition Corporation&quot; and then to &quot;Hallmark Properties&quot;, which changed its name to &quot;Norton Motorcycles Inc&quot;. All of these were Aquilini controlled companies.

Joseph Novogratz entered an agreement with Robin Herd of March Engineering to use the name March when the company was liquidated and formed March Motors Limited, a UK company, in 1995. The following year the company was transferred to Minnesota. The company engaged Melling Consultancy Design (MCD), run by ex-F1 engineer Al Melling, to design a range of motorcycles, the flagship model being the v8 Nemesis. Aquilini approached March for using the Norton name for the bikes. A joint venture was set up, Norton Motors International Inc, with all of Aquilini Norton assets, including the Shenstone factory, transferred to the new company.

The new model line-up was presented at an investors meeting in London&#x27;s Dorchester Hotel in December 1997 including prototypes of the four-cylinder Manx and the Nemesis. Production was due to start at Shenstone in late 1998. Production was subsequently delayed and investors lost faith in the project. By November 1999 Norton Motors International were bankrupt. Melling and Norton ended up in court over the Nemesis prototype.

Freedom Motorcycles were developing a v-twin cruiser. In July 2002 Global Coin issued them with a licence to use the Norton trademark in North America with an option to buy the trademark for $2.5 million. Freedom set up a subsidiary company Norton Motor Co. The legal right of Global Coin to issue the licence was put into doubt, and in March 2003 the company relinquished the right to use the Norton name in return for an undisclosed cash payment. The company changed its name to Viper Motorcycles.

In the 1990s Kenny Dreer of Vintage Rebuilds of Portland, Oregon started remanufacturing Commandos with an updated specifications and capacity increased to 880cc, calling the bikes the Norton Commando VR880. In 1999 Dreer received a cease and desist notice from Aquilini claiming Dreer had no right to use the names and logos of Norton and Commando on the VR880. A 4-year legal battle followed, the result of which was Dreers&#x27; company, renamed to Norton Motorsports in 2000, acquired the rights to the Norton trademarks. Dreer finalised a deal with Seifert to obtain the European rights to the Norton name, giving Norton Motorsports worldwide rights to the name. However the costs to obtain the trademarks put the company in a poor financial situation.

The VR880 had taken the Commando to the limit of its development and donor bikes were getting more difficult to obtain. Dreer wanted to build a more modern replacement for the Commando and development of the 952 started. Further development of the 952 led to the 961 and prototypes of the 961 were well received by the motorcycling press in 2006, but Norton Motorsports were unable to raise the finance to put the bike into production. Dreer&#x27;s investor/business partner Oliver Curme put the business up for sale in 2008.

An agreement was made with for MV to acquire the Norton name. Designer Massimo Tamburini started work on modern Commando twin. However the deal was vetoed by the bankers Gevi SpA, who controlled 57.75% of MV.

Norton Rotary Engineering Ltd had been established at Shenstone, their main business being the supplying of part and servicing of rotary Nortons. They were put up for auction in November 2003, and all the parts, technical drawings and intellectual property were purchased by Norton Motors Ltd. In March 2004 Norton Motors Ltd opened premises in Rugeley, Staffordshire to service the needs of rotary owners.

==The Donington Park revival==
After fifteen years of US ownership the Norton brand was secured by Stuart Garner, a UK businessman and owner of Norton Racing Ltd. Garner established a new Norton factory at Donington Park to develop the Dreer-based machine. The new Norton was a 961 cc (), air- and oil-cooled pushrod parallel twin with a gear-driven counterbalancer and a 270° crank (a concept pioneered on the Yamaha TRX850). The machine, a single-seat roadster styled after the earlier Commando models, has a claimed rear-wheel power output of , giving a top speed of over .

The new operation at Donington Park began limited production of a motorcycle based on the Kenny Dreer 961 Commando. The new motorcycle only shared the outline of the Dreer bike; all aspects of the motorcycle were re-designed in order to move into production. An updated and revised version of the rotary machine first produced in the 1980s is also being developed. The company logo was altered by &quot;doing away with the double crossing of the &#x27;t, in use since 1924, thereby &quot;honouring the very first configuration of the identity, designed by [James] Norton and his daughter.&quot;

In January 2011 it was announced designer Pierre Terblanche had departed Piaggio/Moto Guzzi to join Norton. In August 2011 UK minister Vince Cable announced that the Government was underwriting a £7.5 million bank loan to Norton, to promote secure cash flow for their export sales. Garner responded that this finance would allow Norton to double annual production from 500 to 1,000 machines.

On 29 January 2020, it was announced that the company had gone into administration. Administrators BDO were appointed by Metro Bank. The company had been in court over £300,000 of unpaid taxes due to HM Revenue and Customs, from an original amount of £600,000, with company representatives stating that £135,000 in &quot;outstanding research and development tax relief&quot; was overdue and would substantially reduce the amount owed. HMRC gave the company more time to pay and the court case was adjourned until mid-February. There were reports that there had been fraudulent wrongdoing which affected hundreds of pension holders who invested in the company, Norton customers, and staff; government ministers had endorsed Norton as millions of pounds of government grants and loans were provided. An associated hotel business owned by Stuart Garner also went in administration and was run temporarily by an outside hotel chain.

On 17 April 2020, it was reported that India&#x27;s TVS Motor Company had acquired the business in a cash deal. In the short term, they intended to continue production of motorcycles at Donington Park using the same staff. Former CEO Stuart Garner would not be involved in the new business.

In late 2021, TVS announced the opening of a new manufacturing facility at Monkspath, Solihull, to be staffed initially by 100+ workers to produce luxury hand-crafted motorcycles.

In February 2022, former CEO Stuart Garner admitted taking circa £11 million from three pension schemes intended for employees, where Garner was the sole trustee, to invest in the business. At Derby Crown Court on 31 March 2022, Garner was sentenced to eight months prison, suspended for two years.

On 24 July 2023, it was announced that UK MPs were launching an inquiry into the prosecution of the pension fraud case. It was stated that the inquiry would summon key representatives from the UK&#x27;s financial regulators to give evidence on the case.

==Donington Hall==

Norton acquired Donington Hall near the village of Castle Donington, North West Leicestershire as its new corporate headquarters in March 2013. This office and engineering facility is situated behind Donington Hall in a modern building complex, known as Hastings House. The Donington Hall site includes 26 country acres surrounded by parkland and ancient deer park.

Norton Motorcycles purchased Donington Hall (formerly the headquarters of British Midland International) from British Airways for an undisclosed sum, and announced that it would vacate the current Norton factory at Donington Park, which had about 40 employees. Shifting operations from Donington Park would be carried out in phases so as to not interfere with either production or distribution of Norton&#x27;s bikes.
== TVS acquisition ==
On 17 April 2020 TVS motor company announced the acquisition of the brand in an all-cash deal for a reported £16 million.

In December 2020, new Norton motorcycles rolled off the production line after nearly 12 months of inactivity, with interim CEO John Russell announcing “The first bikes to be built will be 40 Commandos. It&#x27;s a bike people love.”

In June 2021, TVS announced the appointment of Dr Robert Hentschel as chief executive officer (CEO) of Norton Motorcycles. Dr Robert Hentschel joined Norton from Valmet Automotive Holding GmbH &amp; Co KG, where he served as managing director since 2017. Before that, he headed Ricardo Deutschland and Hentschel System and was also Director of Lotus Engineering.

<doc id="343196" wikidata="Q239476" url="?curid=343196" title="Jerry Hall">
<text>Jerry Faye Hall (born July 2, 1956) is an American model and actress. She began modeling in the 1970s and became one of the most sought-after models in the world. She transitioned into acting, appearing in the 1989 film &quot;Batman&quot;. Hall was the long-term partner of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, with whom she has four children. She was the fourth wife of Rupert Murdoch until they divorced in 2022.

==Early life==
Hall was born in Gonzales, Texas, to Marjorie (née Sheffield), a medical records librarian, and John P. Hall. She is of English, Irish, and Dutch descent. 

Hall graduated from North Mesquite High School early at 16. While in high school, she also took classes at Eastfield College in archery, tennis, and gymnastics.

She has a twin sister, Terry, whose jobs have included working in a photography and printmaking shop, real-estate investing, and real-estate broker. They have three older sisters, including Rosy Hall, one of the first Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders.

In the TV series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, Hall discovered that she was descended from Humphrey Best, an associate of American pioneer Daniel Boone.

==Career==
===Modeling===
Jerry Hall and her twin sister Terry were in the French Riviera sunbathing on a Saint Tropez beach when fashion agent Claude Haddad discovered them. She moved to Paris- where she shared an apartment with singer Grace Jones and Jessica Lange. Her modeling career began when she appeared in the guise of a mermaid on the cover of Roxy Music&#x27;s album &quot;Siren&quot; (1975).

By 1977, Hall had been on 40 magazine covers- including Italian &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;. She was earning modeling fees in excess of $1,000 per day. Her long- blonde hair and height of six feet quickly made her one of the most visible and photographed models of the day.

In 2016, Hall won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Fashion Group International Dallas.

Hall was also a muse for artists Francesco Clemente, Ed Ruscha- and Lucian Freud. Hall modeled for Andy Warhol many times.

===Acting===

Hall acted in &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; (1980) and director Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; (1989).

She costarred in an NBC pilot, &quot;She&#x27;s With Me&quot;, opposite Dinah Manoff, and penned by &quot;Married... with Children&quot; creators Ron Leavitt and Michael G. Moye. The unsold pilot aired July 20, 1986.

She made her professional stage debut playing Cherie in a revival of &quot;Bus Stop&quot; (a role played by Marilyn Monroe in the film adaptation) in the Theaterfest summer stock (hosted at Montclair State University) in July 1988. She reprised the role for her London West End stage début in 1990 at the Lyric Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue.

In 1990, she joined many other guests for Roger Waters&#x27; massive performance of &quot;The Wall&quot; in Berlin.

She featured in commercials for Bovril.

==Personal life==

Hall started dating musician Bryan Ferry in 1975, leaving him for Mick Jagger in 1977. Hall and Jagger lived together at Downe House, Richmond Hill, in Greater London, which Jagger purchased in the early 1990s. They separated in August 1999. Jagger and Hall held a Hindu wedding ceremony on November 21, 1990, in Bali, Indonesia. The putative marriage was later declared null and void &quot;ab initio&quot; by the High Court of England and Wales in 1999, ruling that the &quot;marriage&quot; was not legally valid according to either Indonesian or English law. The couple have four children together: Elizabeth Scarlett (born 1984), James Leroy (born 1985), Georgia May (born 1992), and Gabriel Luke (born 1997). James had a twin that died in utero when Hall was five months pregnant.

On March 4, 2016, Hall married media business magnate Rupert Murdoch in a ceremony at the Church of England church of St Bride&#x27;s, Fleet Street, eight weeks after announcing their engagement with a listing in Murdoch&#x27;s &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper. Hall filed for divorce on July 1, 2022, citing irreconcilable differences; the divorce was finalized in August 2022.

<text>Zimbabwe Rhodesia (), alternatively known as Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, also informally known as Zimbabwe or Rhodesia, was a short-lived sovereign state that existed from 1 June 1979 to 18 April 1980, though it lacked international recognition. Zimbabwe Rhodesia was preceded by another state named the Republic of Rhodesia and was briefly under a British-supervised transitional government sometimes referred to as a reestablished Southern Rhodesia, which according to British constitutional theory had remained the lawful government in the area after Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965. Following the 1980 Southern Rhodesian general election, the country was granted internationally-recognized independence within the Commonwealth as the Republic of Zimbabwe.

==Background==

Under pressure from the international community, an &quot;Internal Settlement&quot; was drawn up between the Smith administration of Rhodesia and moderate African nationalist parties. Meanwhile, the government continued to battle armed resistance from the Patriotic Front, a coalition of two African Leadership parties: the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU) and the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU). The liberation war was a proxy conflict between the West and East.

The &quot;Internal Settlement&quot;, signed in March 1978, led to the creation of an interim government in which Africans were included in leading positions for the first time, while creating an independent civil service, judiciary, police force, and army. The settlement also created an executive council composed of Ian Smith and three black individuals (Muzorewa, Sithole, and Chirau), and a ministerial council, while Smith retained his title as Prime Minister. It was also stated that the primary job of this new government is to draw up a constitution for the country, hold elections in April 1979, and arrange a ceasefire with the Patriotic Front. A further goal of the agreement was said to be the hope of ending the country&#x27;s civil war. Following the election, Muzorewa remarked that he didn&#x27;t want the country to be &quot;a sham, a fraud, a hollow shell with the mere trappings of independence&quot; or the country to &quot;ever to become another banana republic.&quot;

Furthermore, a goal of the settlement was for Rhodesia to receive international recognition and have the sanctions imposed on the country due to Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 to be removed. Following the settlement, Muzorewa attempted to convince the British government to recognize the transitional government, but they did not do so. In the same vein, some believed that the settlement was &quot;sufficient&quot; grounds for recognition of Rhodesia and lifting sanctions. Later in 1978, the removal of sanctions was agreed to by the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate, with the caveat that they could only be lifted &quot;once elections were held&quot;. The settlement also reportedly resulted in the release of political prisoners. However, the country&#x27;s civil service, judiciary, police and armed forces continued to be administered by the same officials as before, of whom most were White Zimbabweans, due to the composition of the upper-middle class of the period. 

The new state did not gain international recognition. The Commonwealth Secretariat claiming that the &quot;so-called &#x27;Constitution of Zimbabwe Rhodesia would be &quot;no more legal and valid&quot; than the UDI constitution it replaced, The U.N. Security Council, in Resolution 448 condemned the general election in April 1979 as &quot;null and void&quot; and described the country as an &quot;illegal racist regime&quot; which was attempting to retain and extend &quot;racist minority rule and...preventing the accession of Zimbabwe to independence and genuine majority rule.&quot; It also called on all states to recognize the government and to strictly follow mandatory sanctions against the country. As noted by &quot;Time&quot; in June 1979, United States President Jimmy Carter believed that the elections which installed the government in were neither &quot;fair or free,&quot; because they were held under a constitution that reserved &quot;a disproportionate share of power for the white minority.&quot; He later, in November 1979, continued sanctions until the negotiations conducted by the United Kingdom to end the &quot;peaceful resolution&quot; of the conflict in Rhodesia had come to a close.

==Nomenclature==
As early as 1960, African nationalist political organizations in Rhodesia agreed that the country should use the name &quot;Zimbabwe&quot;; they used that name as part of the titles of their organisations. The name &quot;Zimbabwe&quot;, broken down to &quot;Dzimba dzamabwe&quot; in Shona (one of the two major languages in the country), means &quot;houses of stone&quot;. Meanwhile, the white Rhodesian community was reluctant to drop the name &quot;Rhodesia&quot;, hence a compromise was met.

The Constitution named the new state as &quot;Zimbabwe Rhodesia&quot;, with no reference to its status as a republic in its name. Although the official name contained no hyphen, the country&#x27;s name was hyphenated in some foreign publications as &quot;Zimbabwe-Rhodesia&quot;. The country was also nicknamed &quot;Rhobabwe&quot;, a blend of &quot;Rhodesia&quot; and &quot;Zimbabwe&quot;. It had first been used in the late 1960s.

After taking office as Prime Minister, Abel Muzorewa sought to drop &quot;Rhodesia&quot; from the country&#x27;s name. The name &quot;Zimbabwe Rhodesia&quot; had been criticised by some black politicians like Senator Chief Zephaniah Charumbira, who said it implied that Zimbabwe was &quot;the son of Rhodesia&quot;. ZANU–PF, led by Robert Mugabe in exile, denounced what it described as &quot;the derogatory name of &#x27;Zimbabwe Rhodesia. The proposed changes to the name were not implemented.

The government also adopted a new national flag, featuring the same Zimbabwe soapstone bird, on 2 September of that year. In addition, it announced changes to public holidays, with Rhodes Day and Founders Day being replaced by two new holidays, both of which were known as Ancestors Day, while Republic Day and Independence Day were to be replaced by President&#x27;s Day and Unity Day, celebrated on 25 and 26 October of that year.

In response, the Voice of Zimbabwe radio service operated by ZANU–PF from Maputo in Mozambique, carried a commentary entitled &quot;The proof of independence is not flags or names&quot;, dismissing the changes as aimed at &quot;strengthening the racist puppet alliance&#x27;s position at the Zimbabwe conference in London&quot;.

The national airline, Air Rhodesia, was also renamed Air Zimbabwe.
However, no postage stamps were issued; issues of 1978 still used &quot;Rhodesia&quot;, and the next stamp issues were in 1980, after the change to just &quot;Zimbabwe,&quot; and were inscribed accordingly.

==Government of Zimbabwe Rhodesia==
Zimbabwe Rhodesia&#x27;s short-lived government was elected prior to the creation of the state, with the 1979 Rhodesian general election, the first in which a majority of elected representatives were black. Adapting the constitution of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI), Zimbabwe Rhodesia was governed by a Prime Minister and Cabinet chosen from the majority party in a 100-member House of Assembly. A 40-member Senate acted as the upper House, and both together chose a figurehead President in whose name the government was conducted.

===Legislative Branch===

Of the 100 members of the House of Assembly, 72 were &quot;common roll&quot; members for whom the electorate was every adult citizen. All of these members were black Africans. Those on the previous electoral roll of Rhodesia (due to education, property and income qualifications for voter rolls) elected 20 members; although this did not in theory exclude non-whites, very few black Africans met the qualification requirements. A delimitation commission sat in 1978 to determine how to reduce the previous 50 constituencies to 20. The remaining eight seats for old voter role non-constituency members were filled by members chosen by the other 92 members of the House of Assembly once their election was complete. In the only election held by Zimbabwe Rhodesia, Bishop Abel Muzorewa&#x27;s United African National Council (UANC) won a majority in the common-roll seats, while Ian Smith&#x27;s Rhodesian Front (RF) won all of the old voter roll seats. Ndabaningi Sithole&#x27;s Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) won 12 seats.

The Senate of Zimbabwe Rhodesia had 40 members. Ten members each were returned by the old voter roll members of the House of Assembly and the common roll members, and five members each by the Council of Chiefs of Mashonaland and Matabeleland. The remaining members were directly appointed by the President under the advice of the Prime Minister.

===Executive Branch===
The President of Zimbabwe Rhodesia was elected by the members of the Parliament, sitting together. At the election on 28 May 1979, Josiah Zion Gumede of the United African National Council (UANC) and Timothy Ndhlovu of the United National Federal Party (UNFP) were nominated. Gumede won by 80 votes to Ndhlovu&#x27;s 33.

Starting with 51 seats out of 100, Abel Muzorewa of the UANC was appointed as Prime Minister, and also appointed Minister of Combined Operations and Defence. He formed a joint government with Ian Smith, the former Prime Minister of Rhodesia, who was a Minister without Portfolio. Muzorewa also attempted to include the other African parties who had lost the election. Rhodesian Front members served as Muzorewa&#x27;s ministers of justice, agriculture, and finance, with David Smith continuing in the role of Minister of Finance, while P. K. van der Byl, the former Minister of Defence, serving as both Minister of Transport and Minister of Power and Posts.

==End of Zimbabwe Rhodesia==
The Lancaster House Agreement, signed on 21 December 1979, stipulated that control over the country be returned to the United Kingdom in preparation for elections to be held in the spring of 1980. Before the negotiations had ended, on 11 December 1979, the law was passed which declared that &quot;Zimbabwe Rhodesia shall cease to be an independent State and become part of Her Majesty&#x27;s dominions&quot;. In response, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed Order 1979, on 14 December, establishing the offices of Governor and Deputy Governor of Southern Rhodesia, filled by Lord Soames and Sir Antony Duff respectively, creating a &quot;permanent government&quot; for the country.

Although the name of the country formally reverted to Southern Rhodesia at this time, the name &quot;Zimbabwe Rhodesia&quot; remained in many of the country&#x27;s institutions, such as the Zimbabwe Rhodesia Broadcasting Corporation. On 18 April 1980, Southern Rhodesia became the independent Republic of Zimbabwe within the Commonwealth of Nations.

<doc id="343201" wikidata="Q1413396" url="?curid=343201" title="Thought-terminating cliché">
<text>A thought-terminating cliché (also known as a semantic stop-sign, a thought-stopper, bumper sticker logic, or cliché thinking) is a form of loaded language, often passing as folk wisdom, intended to end an argument and quell cognitive dissonance. Its function is to stop an argument from proceeding further, ending the debate with a cliché rather than a point. Some such clichés are not inherently terminating. They only become so when used to intentionally dismiss dissent or justify fallacious logic.

The term was popularized by Robert Jay Lifton in his 1961 book &quot;Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism,&quot; who referred to the use of the cliché, along with &quot;loading the language&quot;, as &quot;the language of non-thought&quot;.

== Origin and definitions ==
The earliest recorded definition of the term was published in Robert Jay Lifton&#x27;s book &quot;Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism&quot; in 1961 wherein he was describing the structure of language used by the Chinese Communist Party, defining the term as &quot;the start and finish of any ideological analysis&quot;. It was listed as the sixth (of eight) totalistic themes. The term is written under the sixth (of eight) criteria for thought reform &#x27;Loading the Language&#x27;, of which various authors and scholars also consider the term to be a form of loaded language.

Charles &#x27;Chaz&#x27; Bufe in his book &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous: Cult or Cure?&quot; (1997) broadly put the use of the cliché as &quot;thought-stopping phrases (that) include any use of the language, especially repeated phrases, to ward off forbidden thoughts&quot; in describing his interactions with the Alcoholics Anonymous aid movement. Author, show-host and doctor Robert &#x27;Bo&#x27; Bennett described the term as a substitute for &quot;a person&#x27;s actual position or argument with a distorted, exaggerated, or misrepresented version of the position of the argument&quot; in his 2017 book &quot;Logically Fallacious&quot;, along with a proposed logical form of the cliché; &quot;Person 1 makes claim Y. Claim Y sounds catchy. Therefore, claim Y is true.&quot;

The &quot;Southern California Law Review&quot;, Volume 51, Part 1, describes the use of such clichés as &quot;to capture the vehicles of thought and communication; &#x27;Doctrine over reality&#x27; (which includes the rewriting of history and reinterpretation of one&#x27;s past)&quot; and as a property of &quot;ideological totalists&quot;.

Bennett explains that exceptions are made to the use of phrases that would otherwise be considered thought-terminating if they are used in addition to evidence or strong claims.

=== Examples ===
* &quot;It&#x27;s not that deep.&quot; – dismisses attempts to expose faulty logic by asserting that logic isn&#x27;t necessary in this particular case.
* &quot;Lies of the devil.&quot; – used as a response to any fact that threatens the integrity of an individual or group
* &quot;Stop thinking so much.&quot; – redirects attention from the topic, idea, or argument at hand to the alleged overuse of thought itself
* &quot;It&#x27;s all good.&quot; – nullifies, without evidence, any possible debate by asserting the issue is already settled
* &quot;Here we go again.&quot; – implies that the redundant, cyclical nature of a given disagreement means it will never be resolved
* &quot;So what? What effect does my action have?&quot; – used to dismiss an individual&#x27;s involvement in a larger cause on the grounds that one person is too insignificant to ever have a meaningful impact
* &quot;Let&#x27;s agree to disagree.&quot; – used to stop discussion of an issue rather than attempt to resolve it; may, however, instantiate a dialectic
* &quot;.&quot; – implies that things are unchangeable, therefore there is no point in further discussion

== Politics ==
Two criticisms made by various journalists are that the cliché tends to halt debate and restrict or censor freedom of speech, or tends to be synonymous with language that would be used by totalitarian states as Lifton originally identified with Communist China. Chancellor Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany is remarked to have employed such clichés and platitudes to justify his actions prior to and during the events of World War II.

In Joan Didion&#x27;s essay &quot;Good Citizens&quot;, included in her 1979 collection &quot;The White Album&quot;, Didion writes of the clichés used by the people she sees as comprising 1960s &quot;liberal Hollywood&quot;: &quot;It is a way of talking that tends to preclude further discussion, which may well be its intention.&quot;

David Volodzko in &quot;The Diplomat&quot; in 2015 characterized China&#x27;s justification for persecuting Tibetans, Uyghurs, Falun Gong, artists, and journalists (including Liu Xiaobo), summed up as &quot;for security reasons&quot;, as a thought-terminating cliché, going on to say &quot;that&#x27;s every bit as vapid as &#x27;God moves in a mysterious way&#x27; or &#x27;support our troops&#x27;. What it really means is that the Party is more important than the people.&quot;

== Religion ==
An example of the cliché in use provided by Chaz Bufe is &quot;the admonition given to Catholic schoolchildren to recite the Hail Mary or rosary to ward off &#x27;impure thoughts&#x27;. The use of repetitive chanting by the Hare Krishnas serves the same thought-stopping purpose.&quot; Christian author Ann Morisy criticized the Christian Church for their uses of such clichés coinciding with their doctrines that intentionally reduce the possibility of dialogue, stating that failure to move beyond them risks falling prey &quot;to a new version of gnosticism&quot; along with alienating those not of the faith. Scientology has also been criticized for using protocols, language and lexicons that use thought-terminating clichés to condition its members or to reaffirm a confirmation bias, which makes it difficult for members to think &quot;outside the box&quot;.

== Fictional applications ==

*George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; – The totalitarian state Oceania implements Newspeak, a &quot;pared-down version of English in which &#x27;dangerous&#x27; words like &#x27;freedom&#x27; no longer exist&quot;. Kathleen Taylor suggests in that the words that remain as a result of the diminishing of the English language are ideologically loaded, and are &quot;clear examples of Lifton&#x27;s thought-terminating clichés&quot;.
*Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot; – The &quot;Utopian&quot; Society uses thought-terminating clichés more conventionally, most notably regarding the drug soma as well as modified versions of real-life platitudes, such as, &quot;A doctor a day keeps the jim-jams away.&quot;

<text>The University of Zimbabwe (UZ) is a public university in Harare, Zimbabwe. It was opened in 1952 as the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and was initially affiliated with the University of London. It was later renamed the University of Rhodesia, and adopted its present name upon Zimbabwe&#x27;s independence in 1980. UZ is the oldest university in Zimbabwe.

The university has eleven faculties (with faculties of Agriculture Environment and Food Systems, Arts and Humanities, Business Management Sciences and Economics, Computer Engineering Informatics and Communications, Education, Engineering and Built Environment, Law, Science, Social and Behavioural Sciences, Veterinary Sciences and Medicine and Health Sciences) offering a wide variety of degree programmes and many specialist research centres and institutes. The university is accredited through the National Council for Higher Education, under the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education. English is the language of instruction. The university has faced criticism for awarding fraudulent degrees to members of the Robert Mugabe regime, most notably First Lady Grace Mugabe.

== History ==
===Background===
In 1945, Manfred Hodson (after whom a residence hall is now named) formed the &quot;Rhodesia University Association&quot;, inspired by the promise of £20,000 by Robert Jeffrey Freeman for establishing such a university. The following year, the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly adopted a motion proposed by Hodson for the establishment of a university college to serve the needs of Southern Rhodesia and neighbouring territories. The Governor of Southern Rhodesia established the Rhodesia University Foundation Fund in 1947. The Legislative Assembly accepted an offer of land in Mount Pleasant from the City of Salisbury (now Harare) for the construction of the campus in 1948. Four years later a bill was enacted for the incorporation and constitution of the university. First classes began for some 68 students on a temporary site at 147 Baker Avenue (now Nelson Mandela Avenue). Independent of the initiatives of Hodson and the Legislative Assembly, the Central African Council&#x27;s Commission on Higher Education, led by Sir Alexander Carr-Saunders (after whom another residence is now named), recommended the establishment of a university college to serve the newly established Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, with its first preference being to integrate with the Southern Rhodesian initiative.

===Establishment===
Construction began on the Mount Pleasant site, funded by grants from both the British Government and the Government of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland; other grants came from Anglo American Corporation, the British South Africa Company, the Rhodesia Selection Trust, the Beit Trust, the Ford Foundation and the Dulverton Trust, and in July 1953 Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother laid the foundation stone. In 1955, the British Government formally adopted the institution, establishing the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (UCRN) by Royal Charter. The college was admitted to the privilege of Special Relation with the University of London the following year, and in 1957 all activities were transferred to the Mount Pleasant campus. The following year the college was granted pieces of land upon which the college farm and the Lake Kariba Research Station were constructed. In 1963 the Medical School opened and was affiliated to the University of Birmingham. After the dissolution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the University College continued as an independent institution of higher education and research, open to all races. In 1970 a phased termination of the associations with the Universities of London and Birmingham began.

===Post independence===
Following Zimbabwe&#x27;s independence after the Rhodesian Bush War, the university was renamed University of Zimbabwe in 1980. In 1981, the first black principal, Walter Kamba, was appointed and in 1982 the royal charter was replaced by an act of Parliament. Student numbers rose from 1,000 in 1980 to 2,000 by 1985. In December 1998, the university hosted the Eighth Assembly of the World Council of Churches (WCC). The Assembly, the WCC&#x27;s chief governing body, met in the Great Hall on the UZ campus.

On 5 October 1989, thousands of students at the university gathered to protest the arrests of two student leaders. Hundreds of riot police arrived, clashing with the protestors, several of whom were injured and more than 50 of whom were arrested and faced up to five years in prison. By noon that day, all of the university&#x27;s 8,000 students were ordered to leave campus, and riot police arrived, blocking entrances to campus and preventing students from entering.

The University of Zimbabwe Act was controversially amended in 1990, giving the government more powers and, according to many faculty, students and observers, attacking academic freedom. The late 1980s and most of the 1990s saw a rise in student protest, resulting in several closures and mass expulsions. Despite the ongoing tensions, the university continued to grow and the student population had reached 8,000 by 1995 and 10,139 by 2001. As the 2000s began, the university struggled to meet lecturers&#x27; and professors&#x27; expectations on salary levels, leading to numerous strikes. Many donors, including the Government of Sweden, which had previously been a major financer of UZ, cut or cancelled their aid. As the economic crisis grew in Zimbabwe, UZ began to fail to recruit lecturers and professors to fill vacancies. By 2007, the shortage of staff was preventing the teaching and examination of some programmes. Problems with water and electricity supply, as well as maintenance of infrastructure became critical by the late 2000s. The decline of UZ culminated in the university&#x27;s failure to re-open for the 2008–2009 academic year. The university briefly opened in early 2009, but no classes were held due to strike action by lecturers. The institution was closed again in late February, following demonstrations by students against new, hard currency fees.

===Controversy over fraudulent degrees===

The university has faced criticism for awarding a fraudulent degree to a member of the Mugabe regime; in 2014, Grace Mugabe was given a doctorate in sociology, only two months after being registered on the programme, although a dissertation does not exist in the university archives. On 20 November 2017, the University of Zimbabwe students boycotted writing exams citing that the former first lady Grace Mugabe&#x27;s controversial PhD should be revoked. They also protested and declared that they would not write examinations until Robert Mugabe resigned. The 93 year old leader and then chancellor of the university resigned the following afternoon on 21 November 2017 as head of state and government. Many claimed that the University of Zimbabwe&#x27;s students will go down in history as those who gave the Mugabe regime the &#x27;final push&#x27; of his 37-year reign as Zimbabwe&#x27;s leader.

==Campus==
The main campus of the University of Zimbabwe is located in the affluent Mount Pleasant suburb in northern Harare. The campus spans in the southern part of Mount Pleasant, forming the main portion of a special section of land reserved for educational purposes located between Mount Pleasant Drive, Upper East Road, Churchill Avenue, and Teviotdale Road. Other institutions located within this zone include the Ministry of Education Audio-Visual Centre, Mount Pleasant School, and the Zimbabwe School Examinations Council headquarters. There are 171 buildings on the main campus, including academic facilities, all but two of the student residence halls, and much of the staff housing. The main campus also features sporting facilities and the College Green, a grassy space located near the centre of campus close to the academic buildings that is a popular site for social events. Roughly a third of the campus is a seasonal wetland that is unsuitable for construction and remains undeveloped.

In addition to the Mount Pleasant campus, the university has facilities in several different locations throughout Zimbabwe. In Harare alone, UZ has 46 buildings located outside the Mount Pleasant campus. The university&#x27;s main satellite campus, is located at the Parirenyatwa Hospital in central Harare, houses the College of Health Sciences. Besides the medical school, additional university properties within Harare include blocks of flats for staff and student housing in The Avenues, Avondale, and Mount Pleasant. Outside Harare, UZ has facilities in Bulawayo, Kariba, and Teviotdale. The university operates the Lake Kariba Research Station, located in the Nyamhunga suburb of Kariba, Mashonaland West, as well as the University of Zimbabwe Farm, also known as Thornpark Estate, which lies approximately 8 kilometers away from the Mount Pleasant campus, on Mazowe Road in Teviotdale, Mazowe District, Mashonaland Central. The farm, in size, is used by the UZ Faculty of Agriculture for teaching and research. Several of Zimbabwe&#x27;s newer universities began as colleges and satellite campuses of UZ, such as Bindura University of Science Education, Chinhoyi University of Technology, and Zimbabwe Open University.

==Academics==

===Undergraduate===
The basic format of undergraduate learning at UZ is lectures, by professors or lecturers and tutorials by lecturers of teaching assistants. Many programmes also have laboratory-based practical work and field schools. Tests and assignments on course content are graded for a theory coursework grade. Practical work, where applicable, is graded for a practical coursework grade. Theory, and in some cases practical, examinations are administered.

The degree programmes follow the Course Unit model, and in many programmes it is possible for students to select some of the courses from a range of options. Honours degrees have a compulsory project course that the students must complete individually, with different projects carried out by each student.

The undergraduate programmes offered lead to Bachelor, Bachelor (Honours) and Intercalated bachelor&#x27;s degrees. Registered bachelor&#x27;s degree programmes are in arts, business studies and computer science, tourism and hospitality management, education, adult education, science education, nursing science, science, social work, dental surgery, medicine and surgery and veterinary science. Registered undergraduate Bachelor (Honours) programmes are in agriculture, agricultural engineering, applied environmental science, arts, accountancy, business studies, law, engineering, mining engineering, surveying, medical laboratory sciences, nursing science, pharmacy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, science, economics, politics and administration, psychology, rural and urban planning, and sociology. Registered intercalated programmes are in anatomy, human physiology, veterinary anatomy, veterinary physiology and veterinary biochemistry.

===Postgraduate===
The University of Zimbabwe offers postgraduate honours degrees, two types of master&#x27;s degree and doctoral degrees. Postgraduate honours programmes, also known as &quot;special honours&quot; programmes last are for one-year duration and incorporate coursework, examinations and a compulsory project module. Master&#x27;s degrees by coursework and project are designated M.A. or MSc and are of one to two years duration. They incorporate coursework and project modules. Master&#x27;s degrees by research thesis only are designated M.Phil. and require a minimum of two years study. The doctoral programme, D.Phil., is by research thesis only. Students who are carrying out an M.Phil. study, but have not yet submitted their thesis, may apply to their faculty to upgrade their study to the D.Phil. programme.

===Suspension of programmes===
Due to the heavy staff vacancies that UZ began suffering from in the 2000s, many programmes and specialisations have been suspended.

=== Rankings ===
Although UZ has not generally featured in major international rankings such as the Times Higher Education Supplement QS World University Rankings or the Academic Ranking of World Universities, the World Universities Ranking placed the university number 14 in Africa in 2007, after various South African universities, the American University in Cairo and the University of Dar-es-Salaam, and number 3,549 out of 9,760 accredited universities in the world. By 2008, UZ had slid to number 17 in Africa and number 4,001 globally. In 2010, according to University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP), University of Zimbabwe is the best university in Zimbabwe and 1340th university in the world.

== Administration and organisation ==

===Central governance===

The titular head of the university is the Chancellor, who is the President of Zimbabwe. The university is governed by a University Council, comprising the university&#x27;s chief officers, representatives of the Senate, staff and students, nominees of the Minister of Higher and Tertiary Education and representatives form various sectors of commerce and civil society. The chief executive of the university is the Vice-Chancellor, who is appointed by the Chancellor after consultation with the Minister of Higher and Tertiary Education and the University Council. The Vice-Chancellor is assisted by one or more Pro–Vice-Chancellors, appointed by the University Council with the approval of the Minister of Higher Education Innovation Science and Technology Development.

The academic authority of the university is vested in the Senate, comprising the university&#x27;s chief officers, the deans of faculties, all full professors, the chairmen of departments and staff and student representatives. The university is divided into faculties, managed by an executive dean and governed by a Faculty Board comprising all professors and lecturers.

===Faculties===
There are twelve academic faculties:

===Colleges===
The university used to have one college, the College of Health Sciences which is now called the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences. However, many of Zimbabwe&#x27;s public universities started as colleges of the University of Zimbabwe:

===Trans-disciplinary institutes===
The university has two trans-disciplinary research institutes: the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) and the Institute of Environmental Studies (IES).

===Affiliated institutions===
There are numerous education institutions affiliated to the University of Zimbabwe, including teacher training colleges and the School of Social Work.

===Academic year===
The academic year runs from August to June, with graduation normally in September. As from February 2016, the university introduced a second intake, with an academic year that runs from February to December.

==Student life==
===Residences===
On the main campus there are five residences for women: Swinton Hall, Complexes 1, 4 and 5 and Carr-Saunders, and four residences for men: Manfred Hodson Hall, Complex 2, Complex 3 and Manfred Hodson Annex (formerly New Hall). There is also the Medical Residence at the Medical School campus and Mount Royal Residence in the Avenues, in central Harare. The residences were closed in June 2007, with the university authorities citing maintenance and sanitation problems but were reopened in 2014.

=== Sports, clubs, and traditions ===
The university has a target of at least one current or former UZ student representing the country in a medal winning sports team in international competitions annually. Sport at UZ is centred around the Sports Pavilion, which was donated by National Breweries. Sports offered at the university include athletics, basketball, cricket, football, field hockey, rugby, and tennis. UZ has frequently won the Zimbabwe Universities Sports Association Games. In its early years, men&#x27;s hockey was the premier sport, with a team in Salisbury&#x27;s &quot;First League&quot; in 1960 The University of Zimbabwe Football Club plays in Zimbabwe&#x27;s Division two and is the former home of Manchester City striker and Zimbabwe national football team captain Benjani Mwaruwari. The club was for a time coached by former President Canaan Banana. When Zimbabwe hosted the All-Africa Games in 1995, UZ was the games village. Maintenance of sporting facilities is the responsibility of the Director: Sport, but in recent years accessing funds from the State Procurement Board has been a challenge. Other popular and successful sporting disciplines at UZ are Basketball, Vollyeball, Rugby and Handball whom are all playing in the Harare professional leagues. In October 2015, the Sports Department organised a Handball festival in celebration of the university&#x27;s 6oth anniversary and this festival has become an annual event ever since and the biggest handball festival in the country.

In most departments there are subject–related clubs or societies, for example the Kirk Biological Society and the AIESEC and Students Institution for Success Club. In 2005, UZ won the Students in Free Enterprise World Cup held in Ontario, Canada. There are also non–academic clubs such as Rotaract

=== Gender ===
The gender gap in enrollment at UZ, like at African universities, became a concern by the mid-1990s and in 1995 an affirmative action programme was built into the university&#x27;s policy. However, many female students feel inhibited from taking male-dominated courses or taking part in student politics. Women are intimidated by gender–related violence and sexual exploitation.

==Notable people==

=== Principals and vice-chancellors ===

The first head of the university was William Rollo, who served as interim Principal from 1953 to 1955. The first substantive Principal was Walter Adams, who served from 1955 until 1966 and was later Director of the London School of Economics (he was knighted in 1970). Adams was succeeded by Terence Miller, who lasted a mere two years, as his racially progressive views brought him into conflict with the Rhodesian government. His successor, Scottish theologian Robert Craig, served from 1969 to 1980. Leonard J. Lewis served as Principal for roughly a year during the transition to Zimbabwe&#x27;s independence. He was succeeded in 1981 by law professor Walter Kamba, who became Vice-Chancellor, the post created to replace that of Principal. Like Miller, Kamba clashed with the government and announced his resignation at the 1992 graduation ceremony, in a speech that cited government interference in the university and threats to academic freedom. He was succeeded by Gordon Chavunduka until 1996, and then by Graham Hill from 1997 to 2002. Levi Nyagura, the longest-serving Vice-Chancellor, held the office from 2003 to 2018, when he was suspended on charges that he unprocedurally awarded a doctoral degree to former First Lady Grace Mugabe. President Emmerson Mnangagwa appointed soil scientist professor Paul Mapfumo as acting Vice-Chancellor in August 2018 and substantive in June 2019.

<doc id="343207" wikidata="Q7247" url="?curid=343207" title="Ruzi Ying">
<text>Ruzi Ying (; 5 – February or March 25 CE), personal name Liu Ying (), was a ruler of the Han dynasty of China and the last of the Western Han dynasty. He was the titular ruler of the Han Empire from 6 CE to 9 CE, even though he did not officially ascend to the throne and only assumed the title of crown prince. After Emperor Ai and Emperor Ping died without heirs, Wang Mang chose the youngest of the available successors in order to maintain his power in the government. The child Ying was soon deposed by Wang Mang who declared the Xin dynasty in place of the Han. During the Xin dynasty, Ying was under effective house arrest—so much so that as an adult, he did not even know the names of common animals. Before and after the Xin dynasty was overthrown in 23 CE, a number of ambitious individuals claimed to be restoring the Han dynasty. In 25 CE, a rebellion against the Gengshi Emperor used Liu Ying as a focus, and when the rebellion was defeated, Liu Ying was killed. He is often viewed as an innocent child who was the victim of tragic circumstances.

== Choice as the titular ruler ==
In 5 CE, Wang Mang, then already nearly unlimited in power as the imperial regent and fearful that the 13-year-old Emperor Ping, once grown-up, would retaliate against him for having slaughtered his uncles in 3 CE, murdered Emperor Ping by poisoning him. Because the young emperor had not had any children by his wife Empress Wang (Wang Mang&#x27;s daughter) or any of his concubines, there was no heir. Emperor Ping&#x27;s grandfather, Emperor Yuan, had no surviving male issue. Of his three sons, Emperor Cheng had no issue, and sons of the other two, Liu Kang, Prince of Dingtao (劉康) and Liu Xing, Prince of Zhongshan (劉興), had succeeded to the imperial throne (as Emperor Ai and Emperor Ping, respectively) and died without issue. The descendants of Emperor Ping&#x27;s great-grandfather Emperor Xuan were therefore considered as possible successors.

There were 53 great-grandsons of Emperor Xuan then still living by this stage, but they were all adults, and Wang Mang disliked that situation. He wanted a child whom he could control. Therefore, he declared that it was inappropriate for members of the same generation to succeed each other (even though Emperor Ping had succeeded his cousin Emperor Ai several years earlier). He then considered the 23 great-great-grandsons of Emperor Xuan—all of whom were infants or toddlers.

While the examination process was proceeding, the mayor of South Chang&#x27;an submitted a rock with a mysterious red writing on it -- &quot;Wang Mang, the Duke of Anhan, should be emperor.&quot; (During his regency, Wang, building a personality cult about himself, had made it an open secret that he encouraged the manufacturing of false prophecies that would call for him to have more and more power; this appears to be one of those instances.) Wang had his political allies force his aunt, Grand Empress Dowager Wang Zhengjun, to issue an edict granting him the title of &quot;Acting Emperor&quot; (假皇帝), with the commission to rule as emperor until a great-great-grandson of Emperor Xuan could be selected and raised.

On 17 April 6 CE, Acting Emperor Wang selected Ying, then just one year old, as the designated successor to Emperor Ping, claiming that soothsayers told him that Ying was the candidate most favoured by the gods. He gave Ying the epithet &quot;Ruzi&quot;—the same epithet that King Cheng of Zhou had when he was in his minority and under the regency of Ji Dan, the Duke of Zhou—to claim that he was as faithful as the Duke of Zhou. However, Emperor Ruzi did not ascend the throne, but was given the title of crown prince. Empress Wang, who was only 14, was given the title empress dowager.

== Brief &quot;reign&quot; ==
Several members of the imperial Liu clan were suspicious of Acting Emperor Wang&#x27;s intentions. They started or assisted in several failed rebellions against Wang:

* In 6 CE, Liu Chong (劉崇), the Marquess of Anzhong, made an attack against Wancheng (宛城, in modern Nanyang, Henan). His attack failed, but historians did not specify what happened to him, only that as punishment, Wang had his house filled with filthy water.
* In 7 CE, Zhai Yi (翟義), the governor of the Commandery of Dong (roughly modern Puyang, Henan) and Liu Xin (劉信), the Marquess of Yanxiang (and the father of Liu Kuang (劉匡), the Prince of Dongping (roughly modern Tai&#x27;an, Shandong) started the largest of these rebellions. They were joined by agrarian rebellion leaders Zhao Peng (趙朋) and Huo Hong (霍鴻) from the area immediately west of the capital Chang&#x27;an. They declared Liu Xin emperor. Wang Mang responded by sending messengers around the nation to pledge that he would in fact return the throne to Emperor Ruzi once Ruzi was an adult. Wang&#x27;s armies defeated Zhai and Liu&#x27;s armies in the winter of 7 CE, and Zhai was captured and executed by drawing and quartering. Liu fled and was never captured. Zhao and Huo were also eventually defeated and executed.
* In 9 CE (after Wang Mang had usurped the throne), Liu Kuai (劉快), the Marquess of Xuxiang, attacked the Fuchong dukedom of his brother Liu Ying (劉殷), the former Prince of Jiaodong. He was defeated and died while fleeing from the battle.

After Zhai and Liu Xin were defeated, Wang became even more satisfied that the empire was entirely under his control, and decided to finally seize the throne and start a new dynasty. In the winter of 8 CE, a prophecy written on a casket was presented by Ai Zhang (哀章). The prophecy was said to be a divine decree from Emperor Gao (Liu Bang) stating that the throne should be given to Wang, and that Empress Dowager Wang (who was Wang Mang&#x27;s own daughter) should follow this divine will. Wang issued a decree accepting the position of emperor and establishing the Xin dynasty.

== Life during the Xin dynasty ==
In the spring of 9 CE, Wang Mang, now emperor, made the former Emperor Ruzi the Duke of Ding&#x27;an (and made his daughter, the former Empress Dowager, Duchess Dowager). The dukedom allegedly included 10,000 households, in which Han emperors were to be enshrined in temples, and Han calendars and uniforms would be allowed. However, Wang did not actually follow through on these promises. Indeed, he never allowed the Duke of Ding&#x27;an to rule his dukedom, but effectively put the child duke under house arrest under heavy guard. Not even his wet nurses were allowed to stay with him. As a grown man, Ying did not even know of such common animals as cattle, horses, sheep, chickens, dogs, and pigs. Wang gave his granddaughter to the Duke of Ding&#x27;an in marriage. She was the daughter of his son Wang Yu (王宇), whom he had forced to commit suicide in 3 CE after Wang Yu, unhappy with his dictatorial rule, had conspired with Emperor Ping&#x27;s uncles from the Wei clan in order to overthrow him. Other than this, not much is known about the Duke of Ding&#x27;an&#x27;s life during the Xin dynasty.

== Death ==
After the Xin dynasty was overthrown in 23 CE and Wang Mang was killed, the imperial descendant Liu Xuan (劉玄) became emperor as the Gengshi Emperor. However, due to Gengshi Emperor&#x27;s incompetence, conspiracies and rebellions arose throughout the empire, seeking to displace him.

Two co-conspirators started one of these rebellions in 25 CE—Fang Wang (方望), the former strategist for the local warlord Wei Xiao (隗囂), and a man named Gong Lin (弓林)—and their group of several thousand men, after kidnapping Ying, occupied Linjing (臨涇, in modern Qingyang, Gansu). In February or March 25, Gengshi Emperor sent his prime minister Li Song (李松) to attack them, and wiped out this rebel force, killing Liu Ying.

<doc id="343209" wikidata="Q7288281" url="?curid=343209" title="Ralph Wilson">
<text>Ralph Cookerly Wilson Jr. (October 17, 1918 – March 25, 2014) was an American businessman and sports executive. He was best known as the founder and owner of the Buffalo Bills, a team in the National Football League (NFL). He was one of the founding owners of the American Football League (AFL), the league with which the NFL merged in 1970, and was the last of the original AFL owners to own his team. At the time of his death he was the oldest owner in the NFL, at age 95. His 54 years of ownership was the third longest tenure by one owner in league history behind George Halas and Art Rooney. Wilson was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2009.

==Career==
Wilson grew up in Detroit, Michigan, the son of salesman Ralph Wilson Sr. and his wife Edith Cole.

Choosing to go out of state to attend the University of Virginia (where he joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity), Wilson returned to Michigan for graduate school at the University of Michigan Law School. He was a 1936 graduate of Detroit University School, now University Liggett School. Before Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served in the Atlantic and Pacific Theaters. After the war ended, he took over his father&#x27;s insurance business and invested in Michigan area mines and factories. He eventually purchased several manufacturing outlets, construction firms, television and radio stations, and founded Ralph Wilson Industries.

Wilson got wind of Lamar Hunt&#x27;s plans for a new league, the American Football League, to challenge the NFL. He tried to put together a team in Miami, but was turned down. His next choice was Buffalo, where the AFL&#x27;s first choice of owner, Pat McGroder, had declined to start a team. In September 1959, Wilson sent Hunt a telegram with the words, &quot;Count me in with Buffalo.” He named his new team the Bills, after a previous team that had played in the All-America Football Conference from 1946 to 1949. On October 28, 1959, the Buffalo Bills officially became the seventh AFL team. Wilson made professional football a resounding success in a &quot;small market&quot;, signing such stars as Cookie Gilchrist, Jack Kemp, and Tom Sestak and Hall of Famers Billy Shaw and O. J. Simpson.

He was a guiding force in AFL policies that ensured success, such as gate and television revenue sharing. As one of only three AFL owners to be on relatively solid financial ground (along with Hunt and Bud Adams), Wilson lent the financially troubled Oakland Raiders $400,000 and was also willing to lend money to Billy Sullivan of the New England Patriots. Wilson helped keep those franchises afloat, likely saving the entire league from folding (the AFL was unique among professional football leagues in that not a single AFL franchise folded in its history). In November 1963, Wilson along with then Raiders general manager Al Davis lobbied successfully to have AFL games postponed the Sunday after President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination; NFL games were played as scheduled.

Wilson was most concerned about his team&#x27;s financial solvency and was largely indifferent to the Bills&#x27; on-field success; O. J. Simpson later noted of his contract negotiations with the Bills that when Simpson&#x27;s agent told Wilson of Simpson&#x27;s potential to make the team a championship contender, Wilson shot back &quot;What good would a championship do me? All that means is everybody wants a raise.&quot;

In 1989, after league commissioner Pete Rozelle announced his retirement, Wilson was on the six-member committee who was tasked with nominating potential candidates for the open position. Wilson&#x27;s nominee, his former quarterback Jack Kemp, declined to pursue the post, as he had already taken a position in the U.S. Cabinet. (The job ultimately went to league attorney Paul Tagliabue.)

After the original naming rights deal on the Bills&#x27; current stadium expired in 1998, the facility&#x27;s name was changed from Rich Stadium to Ralph Wilson Stadium; it would not receive a new naming rights deal until 2016, after his death and the subsequent sale of the team. According to an article on msn.com, Wilson, described as &quot;stubborn&quot;, turned down numerous naming rights deals for the stadium.

Wilson was one of the league&#x27;s most outspoken owners, even near the end of his life. Wilson voted against the Cleveland Browns&#x27; relocation to Baltimore in 1995. He publicly rebuked NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue in an open letter in 1998 over league policy, which disallowed criticism of referees, after poor officiating had a direct impact on a Bills loss that season. He was one of two owners (the Cincinnati Bengals&#x27; Mike Brown being the other) to oppose the league&#x27;s former (pre-2011) collective bargaining agreement. (Wilson and Brown were commended for their foresight when the agreement later led to the 2011 NFL Lockout.) He also negotiated a deal to have his team play home games in Toronto from 2008 until 2014.

Wilson retired from the position of president in 2001, giving operational control to general manager Tom Donahoe; Wilson retook control of the team&#x27;s operations in 2006. Wilson again retired as team president, this time surrendering all control of the team&#x27;s operations to Russ Brandon, on January 1, 2013. He continued to consult with Brandon on team and league operations up until his death.

Wilson maintained a permanent residence in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan with his wife, Mary McLean, whom he met in 1989. He had three daughters from his first marriage to Janet McGregor Wilson, two of whom became involved in team business: Linda Wilson Bogdan (1948–2009), Pro Football&#x27;s first female scout, was the franchise&#x27;s Corporate Vice President until her death. Another daughter, Christy Wilson Hofmann, served as a consultant in the area of merchandising. The third daughter, Edith Wilson (1951–2020) was never involved with the franchise. The highest ranking relative in the organization was Mary Owen, Wilson&#x27;s niece, who served as Vice President of Strategic Planning until the team was sold. Wilson and his first wife divorced in 1970 after 26 years of marriage and shortly after their youngest daughter, Edith, turned 19.

Beginning in the 1990s, Wilson maintained a small, but very valuable, art collection, including works by Claude Monet, Édouard Manet and Alfred Sisley; this collection was valued in the tens of millions of dollars.

Wilson was a 1992 inductee of the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame. He was a 33rd degree Scottish Rite Freemason.

===Declining health and death===
Wilson broke his hip in a fall at his home in July 2011, causing him to miss the Bills&#x27; home opener for the first time in franchise history. The injury resulted in him needing to use a wheelchair. He issued a statement saying that he was undergoing physical therapy and hoped to attend at least one game during the season. Wilson also stated that he was &quot;very surprised&quot; by the team&#x27;s 41–7 victory over Kansas City in Week 1. He was hospitalized in August and early September 2012 with an unspecified infection and missed attending games in the entire 2012 season. In April 2013, Wilson was reported as &quot;doing really well,&quot; with a statement that he hoped to make the 2013 home opener.

Wilson died at his home on March 25, 2014, of natural causes at the age of 95. His estate held the franchise in trust until its sale to Buffalo Sabres owners Terry and Kim Pegula in September 2014. The proceeds from the sale were used to form an endowment for the Ralph C. Wilson Jr. Foundation, which funds charitable causes in the Buffalo and Detroit areas, in accordance with Wilson&#x27;s instructions for the money set forth prior to his death. The donation amounted to $1.2 billion and would be given away over the next two decades. The organization was overseen for a few months by his niece Mary Owen until its sale to the Pegulas was completed on October 8, 2014.

==Pro Football Hall of Fame==
On January 31, 2009, Wilson was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame along with former Buffalo Bills defensive end Bruce Smith. The Hall of Fame game, played the day after the 2009 inductions, strayed from the usual AFC–NFC format and instead was contested by two original American Football League teams: the Buffalo Bills and the Tennessee Titans (formerly the Houston Oilers). This matchup was announced after Wilson was elected. Like Wilson, Titans owner Bud Adams was the only owner his team has ever had, and the two were the only living members of the &quot;Foolish Club&quot;, the founders of the original eight AFL teams. Wilson and Adams are two of only four men who have owned a professional football franchise continuously for fifty years (George Halas, who owned the Chicago Bears from 1920 until his death in 1983, is the third, and William Clay Ford Sr., Wilson&#x27;s neighbor, who owned the Detroit Lions from 1961 to 2014, is the fourth).

The Hall of Fame game on Sunday, August 9, was a kickoff to the 2009 season, which would have been the 50th season of play for the AFL, if the NFL had not merged with it. Wilson was officially inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday, August 8, 2009, with ESPN icon Chris Berman acting as his &quot;presenter&quot;. Wilson was scheduled to receive his Hall of Fame ring in a halftime ceremony during the Bills game against the Cleveland Browns on October 11, 2009. However, Wilson cancelled the event at the last moment, without notifying the press or fans, and no explanation was given. It was widely speculated that Wilson cancelled the event out of fear of being booed by Bills fans for the team&#x27;s chronic poor performance on the field and a series of highly unpopular managerial decisions. He was eventually presented with the ring on November 1.

Wilson donated US$2.5 million to the construction of a &quot;Pro Football Research and Preservation Center&quot; at the Hall of Fame; the facility was named in Wilson&#x27;s honor on August 13, 2012.

==Thoroughbred racing==
Wilson was also involved for a number of years in the sport of Thoroughbred horse racing both as a breeder and as an owner in France and the United States. He bred Santa Anita Derby winner Jim French, as well as two-year-old European superstar Arazi, winner of the 1991 Breeders&#x27; Cup Juvenile and European Horse of the Year. Another horse, Outta Here, raced in the 2003 Kentucky Derby and finished in seventh place.

<doc id="343210" wikidata="Q1680207" url="?curid=343210" title="Princess (car)">
<text>The Princess is a large family car produced in the United Kingdom by the Austin-Morris division of British Leyland from 1975 until 1981 (1982 in New Zealand). The car inherited a front-wheel drive / transverse engine configuration from its predecessor, the Austin/Morris 1800 range. This was still unusual in Europe for family cars of this type and gave the Princess a cabin space advantage when compared with similarly sized cars from competing manufacturers.

The car, which had the design code ADO71, was originally marketed as the Austin / Morris / Wolseley 18–22 series. Ahead of the October 1975 London Motor Show the range was rebranded &quot;Princess&quot;. This was effectively a new marque created by British Leyland, although the &quot;Princess&quot; name had previously been used for the Austin Princess limousine from 1947 to 1956, and the Vanden Plas Princess. The Princess is often referred to, incorrectly, as the Austin Princess. Although this name was not used in the UK market, it was used in New Zealand. The car was later revamped as the Austin Ambassador, a hatchback, which was produced from 1981 until 1984 and only available in Britain and Ireland.

Princess sales, although initially strong, were tailing off by the end of the 1970s. Some competitors had added a fifth door as a &quot;hatchback&quot;, something the Princess lacked (though Harris Mann originally designed the car with a hatch) and the large family car sector fell victim to a poor economic climate further compounded by the OPEC oil crisis. The Princess was somewhere between the Ford Cortina and Ford Granada in terms of size, being designed to compete with more expensive versions of the Cortina as well as entry-level versions of the Granada. British Leyland restyled the Princess with a separate boot so that it would not compete with their existing SD1 and Maxi designs.

The limousine version was devised in late 1975 and produced on a small scale by Woodall Nicholson. Based on the top of the range Princess 2200 HLS, stretched at the B-pillar to allow more room for the rear compartment, the front door remained unchanged, making the car look oddly proportioned from the side. The Princess 2200 HLS Limousine was produced between 1975 and 1979, and was mostly sold to local borough councils (as a mayoral car) and to the funeral sector. The Princess limousine was a lower cost alternative to the Daimler DS420 for local government use.

Total production amounted to 224,942 units, with most examples scrapped by the 1990s.


==Launch of the Austin / Morris / Wolseley 18–22 series==
The car was launched on 26 March 1975 as the 18–22 series, &quot;the car that has got it all together&quot;. The number designation 18–22 referred to the engine sizes available carried forward from the 1800 cc BMC B-series and 2200 cc E-series-engined BMC ADO 17 &quot;Landcrab&quot;. For the first six months of production three badge-engineered versions were produced: Austin, Morris and Wolseley. The Austin model bore the original &quot;design intent&quot;, featuring trapezoidal headlights and a simple horizontally-vaned grille with added &quot;Austin&quot; script to the lower right side. The Morris and Wolseley cars bonnets had a raised &quot;hump&quot; permitting a larger, styled grille for each model; the Morris one was a simple chrome rectangle with &quot;Morris&quot; script in the lower right-hand corner, while Wolseleys had a chrome grille with the traditional illuminated Wolseley badge in the middle, with narrower vertical bars either side set back within the chromed surround. Both of these versions had four round headlights, and the Wolseley model was only available with the six-cylinder engine and luxury velour trim. Apart from their bonnet and headlamp designs, and of course their badging, the Austin and Morris models were virtually identical.

===Models===
===Styling===
The exterior styling was distinctive, innovative, and somewhat divisive. &quot;The Wedge&quot;, as it was often nicknamed, was indeed very wedge-shaped; the styling was all angles and slanting panels. This was very much a 1970s design as created by Italian stylists (see Lamborghini Countach for example). Within BL the car was often referred to as &quot;The Anteater&quot;. The designer, Harris Mann, was also responsible for the Triumph TR7, another wedge-shaped car, as was his original design for the Austin Allegro, although by the time that design had been readied for production nearly all the angular styling features had been lost.

The Princess, unlike the Allegro, made it to regular production relatively unscathed and unaltered from Harris&#x27;s original plan. The bonnet (hood) was a little higher, to allow for taller engines, but the biggest change from Harris&#x27;s design involved the rear. Harris had intended the design to be a five-door hatchback, but management decided that the Austin Maxi should be the only hatchback in the range, making that its unique selling point, and besides, they thought the Princess&#x27;s prospective buyers would dislike a hatchback – despite the fact that in the Rover division the larger Rover SD1 was being given a hatchback design. Consequently, the Princess received fixed rear glass and a separate boot, belying its appearance. An estate version was also proposed, but never reached production.

===Mechanical details===
The base engine fitted was the 1798 cc B-series pushrod straight-4. The lay-out closely followed that of the predecessor model, but access to the alternator/water pump was greatly improved by exploiting the car&#x27;s longer nose to fit a front-mounted radiator. The basic design of the engine dated back to 1947 and the unit with a claimed output of 84 bhp was notably lacking in power, although torque was reasonable. The larger engine, fitted to upper models in the range, was a 2227 cc E-series SOHC straight-6. This was very smooth and a much more modern engine, with a published output figure of 110 bhp, but was still not hugely powerful. The Princess was a big car, and the engine choice gave lacklustre performance, not helped by the provision of only a 4-speed manual gearbox (a Borg-Warner automatic transmission was an option). Suspension used BL&#x27;s Hydragas system.

===Performance and price comparison===
A six-cylinder car was road tested by Britain&#x27;s &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine in March 1975 at the time of the model&#x27;s launch. It recorded a maximum speed of 104 mph (167 km/h) and reached 60 mph (97 km/h) from a standing start in 13.5 seconds. The top speed was marginally lower than the 109 mph (175 km/h) achieved by a recently tested Ford Consul 2500 L and a full three seconds slower to 60 mph than the Ford which managed the standing start test in just 10.4 seconds. The 2200 also fell slightly behind the Fiat 132GLS 1800 in these comparisons. At the same time its overall fuel consumption at 20.7 mpg was usefully superior to the Ford&#x27;s 18.1 mpg. The lighter Fiat was more frugal with fuel than either of the other two. On price, the Austin&#x27;s domestic market recommended retail prices including taxes of £2,424 was significantly higher than the £2,221 charged for the Ford.

Although its performance figures on paper were a little underwhelming, the testers were impressed with the roominess and roadholding of the Austin 2200. They found it quiet and comfortable, the driving position in particular representing a vast improvement over the car&#x27;s predecessor. They mentioned in passing that the boot/trunk on the test car &quot;leaked slightly&quot;, but did not labour the point.

The Princess was similar in size to the Ford Cortina, and was marketed by British Leyland as a rival to the larger engined versions of the Cortina, as well as smaller engined versions of the Ford Granada.

== Princess ==
After the publication of the Ryder Report in March 1975, one of its key recommendations was to consolidate the many British Leyland brands into a single &quot;Leyland Cars&quot; organisation with a common dealer network for all marques and models. By September 1975, the process of unifying Austin and Morris dealerships was advanced sufficiently, while the Wolseley marque was to be abandoned. Thus the policy of selling seven 18–22 series models under three different marques was changed and the range was reduced to four models all sold under the Princess name. All cars now used the Austin versions flat bonnet and horizontally-vaned grille, a crown badge was affixed to the point of the bonnet and the script word &quot;Princess&quot; was affixed to the grille replacing the &quot;Austin&quot; script, the thick vinyl-clad C-pillars and the boot. The 1800 models bore the twin headlights, with the 2200 models sporting the wedge-shaped headlights Harris Mann had designed the car to be seen with.

Build quality of the Princess was affected by poor quality control and constant industrial disputes; it gained a reputation for unreliability it could never shake off, even though quality improved in later years. The styling, praised upon introduction, was soon labelled &quot;ugly&quot;. To quote a phrase in &quot;Parker&#x27;s Car Price Guide&quot; from the 1990s, &quot;an early critic suggested that the people responsible for designing the front and rear of the car were not speaking to one another&quot;.

===Models===

==Princess 2==

In July 1978, the Princess was given a revamp and renamed the Princess 2. The main change was the replacement of the 1800 cc B-series engine with the new O-series engine. The new engine was offered in two sizes: 1695 cc and 1993 cc. Since there was an 1800 cc tax barrier for company cars at the time, the 1700 cc O-series engine was developed to take advantage of that, whilst the 2000 cc engine was developed for the private motorists who wanted something different from the hugely popular Ford Cortina. The L and HL models had the twin headlamps and the HLS models got the trapezoids. The car had perhaps reached its pinnacle when the prestigious &quot;Motoring Which&quot; publication described the Princess 2200 HLS automatic model as &quot;An excellent car, marred only by poor reliability&quot;.

Production of the Princess ceased in November 1981.

The basic Princess design lived on in revised form until 1984 as the Austin Ambassador.

==New Zealand – Austin Princess==
In New Zealand the car was officially sold as the Austin Princess. Assembled in the New Zealand Motor Corporation&#x27;s plant in Nelson, it was introduced to the market in 1977 and utilized the Austin 1800 B-series engine.

In early 1979 the car was re-engined with the BL O-series OHC motor. Due to a conflict of the Austin Princess and Morris Marina competing in the same market sector in New Zealand, the Princess got a 2.0 L unit mounted transversely, while the Marina (which was face-lifted at that time and renamed in NZ as &quot;Morris 1700&quot;) received the 1.7 L unit mounted longitudinally.

Being competitively priced, the Princess proved a popular car on the New Zealand market, and proved to be a good alternative to the rear-wheel-drive Ford Cortina, Mitsubishi Sigma and Holden Commodore ranges.

Local production of the car ended in June 1982, when the completely knocked-down kits of the car had been used up. The Austin Princess R, the last model sold there, was still on new-car price lists in 1983, and was available only in black to commemorate the end of local assembly of a long line of Austin cars.

== Torcars Princess Estate ==

The Princess designer Harris Mann intended it to be a hatchback and Torcars created a conversion designed to meet the growing demand for fifth-door saloons which was dealer approved. The Torcars Princess Estate was available in 1800 or 2200 engine sizes, with manual or automatic gearboxes.

The original sleek wedge profile was completely retained but the tailgate revealed an enormous loadspace accessible by probably the largest estate car aperture available on any European car at the time. With the rear seat lowered there is a load length of nearly , a load width averaging , a load height of nearly , and an overall carrying capacity of 54 cubic feet (assuming Dunlop Denovo run-flat wheels and tyres are fitted, obviating the need for a spare wheel).

Also included as standard items not available on the standard Princess were a wash-wipe system for the rear screen and a fully carpeted luggage area.

<text>The Austin Princess is a series of large luxury cars that were made by Austin and its subsidiary Vanden Plas from 1947 to 1968. The cars were also marketed under the Princess and Vanden Plas marque names.

The Princess name was also used as follows:
* From October 1959, the name Princess was used on a deluxe version of BMC&#x27;s full-sized executive cars badged as an Austin Westminster, Vanden Plas Princess and Wolseley 6/99-6/110
* From October 1962, Princess was used on a deluxe version of the Austin/Morris 1300.
* From September 1975, Princess was used as a name for mass-produced family cars in Leyland&#x27;s 1800/2200 former Austin/Morris/Wolseley range.

==Naming==

The first &quot;Austin Princess&quot; A120 was launched in 1947 as the most expensive flagship model in the Austin range at the same time as the A110 Austin Sheerline (designed during the war) which body was built on the same chassis at Longbridge, the A110 produced 10 less horsepower being fitted with a single carburettor. Both cars always had bodies that were massive and heavy in appearance. The Princess (model code A120) featured a body by the coachbuilder Vanden Plas and was a large saloon or limousine. The car was offered with two distinct interiors. The &quot;DM&quot; or limousine type had a sliding glass partition between the driver and rear passengers plus picnic tables, and the &quot;DS&quot; was the saloon. The saloons were successful as a top-executive car, many Princesses (and Sheerlines, for that matter) were bought for civic ceremonial duties or by hire companies as limousines for hire. The standard saloon weighed almost two tons, was 16 ft 9 inches long and 6 feet 1¼ inches wide on a 10-foot 1¼-inch (the short) wheelbase.

The Princess model was updated over the years through Mark I (A120), Mark II (A135) and Mark III versions, the largest variation being the introduction of the long-wheelbase version in 1952 with a longer body and seven seats: apart from that the bodywork and running gear hardly changed, nor did the D-Series 4-litre straight-6 engine. The radiator was fairly upright in old-fashioned style and the car had separate front wings, but these cars were always more modern in style than the equivalent-sized Bentley Mark VI or Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud and, for the saloon, the price was just a little more than two-thirds of the Rolls-Royce.

From August 1957 the Austin part of the badging was dropped so it could be sold by Nuffield dealerships as &quot;Princess&quot;. From May 1960, the Vanden Plas name was added in front of &quot;Princess&quot;.

==Austin Princess I, II and III==

In 1947, Austin produced two virtually identical chassis, one for the A110 (later A125 Sheerline, built entirely by Austin at their Longbridge factory) and the A120 (later A135) chassis used by Vanden Plas to produce the Princess at their Kingsbury works (North London). Although Vanden Plas was by now wholly owned by Austin and much of the running gear and instrumentation was the same in the two cars, the Princess was the Austin flagship, with a higher specification leather, wool and burr walnut interior.

The original Princess was powered by a 3.5-litre straight-six engine. This was enlarged to a 4.0-litre unit without further modifications. The Princess was often built to order. Customers could specify the colour required and a range of different setups were available. These included triple or single carburettors and twin or single exhaust systems. Whilst the sportier multiple carb version performed better, it achieved only 12 to 14 mpg. The single carburettor version gave slightly better fuel consumption. Performance was good for a car of its size, with a top speed of and acceleration from 0 to 60 mph in 20 seconds. In 1950, the Limousine version was introduced. The chassis length and passenger area were enlarged to enable a pair of drop down seats to be mounted on the rear of the front seats and a glass division was standard.

These early cars are now extremely rare, especially the saloon versions. Many of the saloons were converted for use as taxis in the late 1950s, fitted with Perkins diesel engines for better economy. The 3993cc 6-cylinder engine was also fitted, as a petrol option seldom taken up, to the Austin and Morris normal-control (i.e. &quot;bonneted&quot;) WEK and WFK commercial vehicles.

During the life of this model (in 1952), Austin became part of the British Motor Corporation (BMC).

==Austin Princess IV and Princess IV==

The Austin Princess IV was introduced in 1956. Offered in Saloon (DS7) and Touring Limousine (DM7) models, this replacement for the former Sheerline and A135 only stayed in the catalogue until 1959; 199 were built.

The engine was the Austin D-Series straight six with redesigned cylinder head and was fitted with twin SU HD6 carburettors. The power output was 150 bhp. A GM Hydramatic automatic gearbox and Girling power-assisted steering were fitted as standard.

The luxurious interior now featured redesigned dashboard with instruments directly in front of the driver rather than in the centre.

The last A135 Mark 3 had been priced at five times the price of an Austin A30. The new IV had to be priced at 6.5 times the price of an Austin A30, at which price there was almost no demand. The name was shortened in August 1957 when the car lost its &quot;Austin&quot; designation, now being branded simply as the Princess IV so it might be sold by either Morris or Austin dealers. &quot;The Times&quot; tested the Princess IV and reported on it at some length in early February 1959.

The Princess IV was discontinued in 1959 and replaced in the catalogue by a much smaller model, an upgraded Austin Westminster (Pininfarina-designed Vanden Plas Princess see below), which retailed at little more than 40 per cent of the Mark IV&#x27;s price.

An Austin Princess IV was road tested by &quot;The Autocar&quot; magazine on 3 October 1958, as No.1703 in the series. The engine was rated at 150 bhp (gross) and it returned a maximum speed of 98.7 mph, under the test conditions prevailing.
==Austin Princess, Princess and Vanden Plas Princess Long Wheelbase Limousine (or Saloon)==
The Austin A135 Princess Long Wheelbase Saloon (DS6) and Limousine (DM4) were introduced in 1952. The GM Hydramatic 4-speed automatic transmission and Hydrosteer power steering from Princess IV were fitted from 1956 as options. The marque name was changed from Austin to Princess in August 1957, and then to Vanden Plas from July 1960. The long wheelbase models continued to be built by hand in limited numbers as the Vanden Plas Princess 4-litre Limousine, until 1968. All now being parts of British Leyland, the Jaguar Mark X-based Daimler DS420 was initially produced at the Vanden Plas works in Kingsbury, North London then replaced the Vanden Plas Princess within the new, slightly rationalised range. This had been foreseen in 1966 when British Motor Holdings (BMH) had brought BMC and Jaguar together, and stopped development at Vanden Plas of the potential successor car. The limousine was luxuriously appointed with much polished wood, optional mohair rugs and radio with controls in the armrest. Among the long list of available extras were monograms and a flagstaff. The driving compartment was separated from the rear of the car by a division with an optional telephone for the passengers to communicate with the driver. The driving seat was finished in leather and the rear seats were usually trimmed in &#x27;West of England&#x27; cloth, the usual arrangement on many luxury cars of the time. Though not as durable as leather, cloth was considered kinder to passengers&#x27; clothes. To increase seating capacity two occasional seats could be folded out of the floor.

The car had independent coil suspension at the front with semi elliptic leaf springs and anti-roll bar at the rear. The cam and peg type steering gear had optional power assistance.

An Austin A135 Princess Long-wheelbase Limousine tested by &quot;The Motor&quot; magazine in 1953 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 23.3 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £2480 including taxes.

An automatic Limousine was tested by the British magazine &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1962 and had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 23.5 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £3,473 including taxes.

==Popular culture==
At the height of Beatlemania, Austin Princess limousines were the Beatles&#x27; preferred mode of transport. According to their chauffeur/roadie, Mal Evans, the Princess was chosen because the wide coach doors opened allowing the Beatles to dive into the car to escape crowds of fans.

John Lennon owned a 1956 Austin Princess Hearse which he bought secondhand from a mortuary in 1971 to use as his personal limousine for a few years. The hearse was famously used by Lennon and Yoko Ono in the 1972 promotional film &quot;Imagine&quot; that accompanied the album. Shortly after filming he customized the hearse by adding five airline seats in the rear of the hearse, (complete with ashtray arms).

A 1964 Austin Princess was used during the state funeral of Winston Churchill, carrying his coffin through London from Festival Pier to Waterloo Station. The hearse survives and has been restored and put back into funeral service.

On March 20, 1974, Princess Anne was returning to Buckingham Palace from a film premiere in a 1969 Austin Vanden Plas Princess Limousine when a lone gunman attempted to kidnap her. Several shots were fired into the car causing the Princess&#x27; bodyguard and chauffeur to both be shot and injured, but Princess Anne was fortunately unharmed despite being manhandled by the assailant. (This particular Austin Vanden Plas Princess was one of the last Princess limousines to roll off the production line in 1969 and delivered to the Royal Mews in 1972. As they went out of production, two were put aside for the use of junior members of the Royal Family for official engagements.)


==Vanden Plas Princess 1100/1275/1300==
The Vanden Plas Princess 1100 was launched in 1963 as a luxury variant of the BMC ADO16. Production of the Princess 1100 and subsequent 1275 and 1300 models ended in 1974 with 43,741 examples produced.


==Princess (ADO71)==

The final use of the &quot;Princess&quot; name was for the Princess 1800 / 2200 of 1975–78 and the Princess 2 1700 / 2000 / 2200 of 1978–81. This was not badged as an Austin on the home market (although it was badged as such in New Zealand), but was sometimes confused with one because for the first year of its life it was marketed (variously) as the Austin, Morris, and Wolseley 18–22 Series. It was succeeded by the Austin Ambassador in 1982 and thus marked the end of the Princess marque, although the Vanden Plas name continued as the most luxurious trim level in the Rover SD1 range.

<doc id="343218" wikidata="Q234122" url="?curid=343218" title="Marilyn vos Savant">
<text>Marilyn vos Savant ( ; born Marilyn Mach; August 11, 1946) is an American magazine columnist who has the highest recorded intelligence quotient (IQ) in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;, a competitive category the publication has since retired. Since 1986, she has written &quot;Ask Marilyn&quot;, a &quot;Parade&quot; magazine Sunday column wherein she solves puzzles and answers questions on various subjects, and which popularized the Monty Hall problem in 1990.

==Biography==
Marilyn vos Savant was born Marilyn Mach on August 11, 1946, in St. Louis, Missouri, to parents Joseph Mach and Marina vos Savant. Savant says one should keep premarital surnames, with sons taking their father&#x27;s and daughters their mother&#x27;s. The word &quot;&quot;, meaning someone of learning, appears twice in her family: her grandmother&#x27;s name was Savant; her grandfather&#x27;s, vos Savant. She is of Italian, Czechoslovak, German, and Austrian ancestry, being descended from the physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach.

As a teenager Savant worked in her father&#x27;s general store and wrote for local newspapers using pseudonyms. She married at 16 and divorced 10 years later. Her second marriage ended when she was 35.

She went to Meramec Community College and studied philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis but quit two years later to help with a family investment business. Savant moved to New York City in the 1980s to pursue a career in writing. Before starting &quot;Ask Marilyn&quot;, she wrote the &quot;Omni I.Q. Quiz Contest&quot; for &quot;Omni&quot;, which included intelligence quotient (IQ) quizzes and expositions on intelligence and its testing.

Savant married Robert Jarvik (one of the co-developers of the Jarvik-7 artificial heart) on August 23, 1987, and was made Chief Financial Officer of Jarvik Heart, Inc. She has served on the board of directors of the National Council on Economic Education, on the advisory boards of the National Association for Gifted Children and the National Women&#x27;s History Museum, and as a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. Toastmasters International named her one of &quot;Five Outstanding Speakers of 1999&quot;, and in 2003 she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from The College of New Jersey.

==Rise to fame and IQ score==
Savant was listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; under &quot;Highest IQ&quot; from 1985 to 1989 and entered the Guinness Book of World Records Hall of Fame in 1988. Guinness retired the &quot;Highest IQ&quot; category in 1990 after concluding IQ tests were too unreliable to designate a single record holder. The listing drew nationwide attention.

Guinness cited vos Savant&#x27;s performance on two intelligence tests, the Stanford-Binet and the Mega Test. She took the 1937 Stanford-Binet, Second Revision test at age 10: she says her first test was in September 1956 and measured her mental age at 22 years and 10 months, yielding a 228 score. This figure was listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;; it is also listed in her books&#x27; biographical sections and was given by her in interviews.

The second test reported by Guinness was the Mega Test, taken in the mid-1980s. The Mega Test yields IQ standard scores obtained by multiplying the subject&#x27;s normalized z-score, or the rarity of the raw test score, by a constant standard deviation and adding the product to 100, with Savant&#x27;s raw score reported by Hoeflin to be 46 out of a possible 48, with a 5.4 z-score, and a standard deviation of 16, arriving at a 186 IQ. The Mega Test has been criticized by professional psychologists as improperly designed and scored, &quot;nothing short of number pulverization&quot;.

Savant sees IQ tests as measurements of a variety of mental abilities and thinks intelligence entails so many factors that &quot;attempts to measure it are useless&quot;. 
She has held memberships with the high-IQ societies Mensa International and the Mega Society.

==&quot;Ask Marilyn&quot;==
Following her listing in the 1986 &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, &quot;Parade&quot; ran a profile of her along with a selection of questions from &quot;Parade&quot; readers and her answers. &quot;Parade&quot; continued to get questions, so &quot;Ask Marilyn&quot; was made.

She used her column to answer questions on many chiefly academic subjects; solve logical, mathematical, or vocabulary puzzles posed by readers; answer requests for advice with logic; and give self-devised quizzes and puzzles. Aside from the weekly printed column, &quot;Ask Marilyn&quot; was a daily online column that added to the printed version by resolving controversial answers, correcting mistakes, expanding answers, reposting previous answers, and solving additional questions. No new columns have been published online since October 30, 2022.

Three of her books (&quot;Ask Marilyn&quot;, &quot;More Marilyn&quot;, and &quot;Of Course, I&#x27;m for Monogamy&quot;) are compilations of questions and answers from &quot;Ask Marilyn&quot;. &quot;The Power of Logical Thinking&quot; includes many questions and answers from the column.

==Famous columns==

===Monty Hall problem===

Savant was asked the following question in her September 9, 1990, column:
This question is called the Monty Hall problem due to its resembling scenarios on the game show &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, hosted by Monty Hall. It was a known logic problem before it was used in &quot;Ask Marilyn&quot;. She said the selection should be switched to door #2 because it has a probability of success, while door #1 has just . To summarize, of the time the opened door #3 will indicate the location of the door with the car (the door you had not picked and the one not opened by the host). Only of the time will the opened door #3 mislead you into changing from the winning door to a losing door. These probabilities assume you change your choice each time door #3 is opened, and that the host always opens a door with a goat. This response provoked letters from thousands of readers, nearly all arguing doors #1 and #2 each have an equal chance of success. A follow-up column reaffirming her position served only to intensify the debate and soon became a feature article on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;Parade&quot; received around 10,000 letters from readers who thought that her workings were incorrect.

Under the &quot;standard&quot; version of the problem, the host always opens a losing door and offers a switch. In the standard version, Savant&#x27;s answer is correct. However, the statement of the problem as posed in her column is ambiguous. The answer depends on what strategy the host is following. If the host operates under a strategy of offering a switch only if the initial guess is correct, it would clearly be disadvantageous to accept the offer. If the host merely selects a door at random, the question is likewise very different from the standard version. Savant addressed these issues by writing the following in &quot;Parade&quot; magazine, &quot;the original answer defines certain conditions, the most significant of which is that the host always opens a losing door on purpose. Anything else is a different question.&quot;

She expounded on her reasoning in a second follow-up and called on schoolteachers to show the problem to classes. In her final column on the problem, she gave the results of more than 1,000 school experiments. Most respondents now agree with her original solution, with half of the published letters declaring their authors had changed their minds.

===&quot;Two boys&quot; problem===

Like the Monty Hall problem, the &quot;two boys&quot; or &quot;second-sibling&quot; problem predates &quot;Ask Marilyn&quot;, but generated controversy in the column, first appearing there in 1991–1992 in the context of baby beagles:

When Savant replied &quot;one out of three&quot;, readers wrote the odds were 50–50. In a follow-up, she defended her answer, saying, &quot;If we could shake a pair of puppies out of a cup the way we do dice, there are four ways they could land&quot;, in three of which at least one is male, but in only one of which none are male.

The confusion arises here because the bather is not asked if the puppy he is holding is a male, but rather if either is a male. If the puppies are labeled (A and B), each has a 50% chance of being male independently. This independence is restricted when at least A or B is male. Now, if A is &quot;not&quot; male, B &quot;must&quot; be male, and if B is &quot;not&quot; male, A &quot;must&quot; be male. This restriction is introduced by the way the question is structured and is easily overlookedmisleading people to the erroneous answer of 50%. See Boy or Girl paradox for solution details.

The problem re-emerged in 1996–97 with two cases juxtaposed:

Savant agreed with the teacher, saying the chances were only 1 out of 3 that the woman had two boys, but 1 out of 2 the man had two boys. Readers argued for 1 out of 2 in both cases, prompting follow-ups. Finally, she began a survey, asking female readers with exactly two children, at least one of them male, to give the sex of both children. Of the 17,946 women who responded, 35.9%, about 1 in 3, had two boys.

==Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem==
A few months after Andrew Wiles said he had proved Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, Savant published the book &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Famous Math Problem&quot; (October 1993), which surveys the history of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem as well as other mathematical problems. Reviewers questioned her criticism of Wiles&#x27; proof, asking whether it was based on a correct understanding of mathematical induction, proof by contradiction, and imaginary numbers.

Especially contested was Savant&#x27;s statement that Wiles&#x27; proof should be rejected for its use of non-Euclidean geometry. Savant stated that because &quot;the chain of proof is based in hyperbolic (Lobachevskian) geometry&quot;, and because squaring the circle is seen as a &quot;famous impossibility&quot; despite being possible in hyperbolic geometry, then &quot;if we reject a hyperbolic method of squaring the circle, we should also reject a hyperbolic proof of Fermat&#x27;s last theorem.&quot;

Specialists flagged discrepancies between the two cases, distinguishing the use of hyperbolic geometry &quot;as a tool&quot; for proving Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem from its use &quot;as a setting&quot; for squaring the circle: squaring the circle in hyperbolic geometry is a different problem from that of squaring it in Euclidean geometry, whereas Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem is not inherently geometry specific. Savant was criticized for rejecting hyperbolic geometry as a satisfactory basis for Wiles&#x27; proof, with critics pointing out that axiomatic set theory (rather than Euclidean geometry) is now the accepted foundation of mathematical proofs and that set theory is sufficiently robust to encompass both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry as well as adding numbers.

Savant retracted the argument in a July 1995 addendum, saying she saw the theorem as &quot;an intellectual challenge&#x27;to find another proof using only tools available to Fermat in the 17th century. However, Wiles&#x27; original proof, presented in 1993, was found to contain an error during the peer review process, necessitating a subsequent correction by Wiles and Richard Taylor, which ultimately led to the acceptance of the proof in 1994.

The book came with a glowing introduction by Martin Gardner, which had been based on an earlier draft of the book that did not contain any of the contentious views.

<doc id="343225" wikidata="Q213926" url="?curid=343225" title="Sea ice">
<text>Sea ice arises as seawater freezes. Because ice is less dense than water, it floats on the ocean&#x27;s surface (as does fresh water ice). Sea ice covers about 7% of the Earth&#x27;s surface and about 12% of the world&#x27;s oceans. Much of the world&#x27;s sea ice is enclosed within the polar ice packs in the Earth&#x27;s polar regions: the Arctic ice pack of the Arctic Ocean and the Antarctic ice pack of the Southern Ocean. Polar packs undergo a significant yearly cycling in surface extent, a natural process upon which depends the Arctic ecology, including the ocean&#x27;s ecosystems. Due to the action of winds, currents and temperature fluctuations, sea ice is very dynamic, leading to a wide variety of ice types and features. Sea ice may be contrasted with icebergs, which are chunks of ice shelves or glaciers that calve into the ocean. Depending on location, sea ice expanses may also incorporate icebergs.

== General features and dynamics ==

Sea ice does not simply grow and melt. During its lifespan, it is very dynamic. Due to the combined action of winds, currents, water temperature and air temperature fluctuations, sea ice expanses typically undergo a significant amount of deformation. Sea ice is classified according to whether or not it is able to drift and according to its age.

=== Fast ice versus drift (or pack) ice ===

Sea ice can be classified according to whether or not it is attached (or frozen) to the shoreline (or between shoals or to grounded icebergs). If attached, it is called landfast ice, or more often, fast ice (as in &quot;fastened&quot;). Alternatively and unlike fast ice, drift ice occurs further offshore in very wide areas and encompasses ice that is free to move with currents and winds. The physical boundary between fast ice and drift ice is the &quot;fast ice boundary&quot;. The drift ice zone may be further divided into a &quot;shear zone&quot;, a &quot;marginal ice zone&quot; and a &quot;central pack&quot;. Drift ice consists of &quot;floes&quot;, individual pieces of sea ice or more across. There are names for various floe sizes: &quot;small&quot; – ; &quot;medium&quot; – ; &quot;big&quot; – ; &quot;vast&quot; – ; and &quot;giant&quot; – more than . The term &quot;pack ice&quot; is used either as a synonym to &quot;drift ice&quot;, or to designate drift ice zone in which the floes are densely packed. The overall sea ice cover is termed the ice canopy from the perspective of submarine navigation.

=== Classification based on age ===
Another classification used by scientists to describe sea ice is based on age, that is, on its development stages. These stages are: &quot;new ice&quot;, &quot;nilas&quot;, &quot;young ice&quot;, &quot;first-year&quot; and &quot;old&quot;.

==== New ice, nilas and young ice ====
&quot;New ice&quot; is a general term used for recently frozen sea water that does not yet make up solid ice. It may consist of frazil ice (plates or spicules of ice suspended in water), slush (water saturated snow), or &quot;shuga&quot; (spongy white ice lumps a few centimeters across). Other terms, such as grease ice and pancake ice, are used for ice crystal accumulations under the action of wind and waves. When sea ice begins to form on a beach with a light swell, ice eggs up to the size of a football can be created.

&quot;Nilas&quot; designates a sea ice crust up to in thickness. It bends without breaking around waves and swells. Nilas can be further subdivided into &quot;dark nilas&quot; – up to in thickness and very dark and &quot;light nilas&quot; – over in thickness and lighter in color.

&quot;Young ice&quot; is a transition stage between nilas and first-year ice and ranges in thickness from to , Young ice can be further subdivided into &quot;grey ice&quot; – to in thickness and &quot;grey-white ice&quot; – to in thickness. Young ice is not as flexible as nilas, but tends to break under wave action. Under compression, it will either raft (at the grey ice stage) or ridge (at the grey-white ice stage).

==== First-year sea ice ====

&quot;First-year sea ice&quot; is ice that is thicker than &quot;young ice&quot; but has no more than one year growth. In other words, it is ice that grows in the fall and winter (after it has gone through the &quot;new ice – nilas – young ice&quot; stages and grows further) but does not survive the spring and summer months (it melts away). The thickness of this ice typically ranges from to . First-year ice may be further divided into &quot;thin&quot; ( to ), &quot;medium&quot; ( to ) and &quot;thick&quot; (&gt;).

==== Old sea ice ====
&quot;Old sea ice&quot; is sea ice that has survived at least one melting season (&quot;i.e.&quot; one summer). For this reason, this ice is generally thicker than first-year sea ice. The thickness of old sea ice typically ranges from 2 to 4 m. Old ice is commonly divided into two types: &quot;second-year ice&quot;, which has survived one melting season and &quot;multiyear ice&quot;, which has survived more than one. (In some sources, &quot;old ice&quot; is more than two years old.) Multi-year ice is much more common in the Arctic than it is in the Antarctic. The reason for this is that sea ice in the south drifts into warmer waters where it melts. In the Arctic, much of the sea ice is land-locked.

=== Driving forces ===
While fast ice is relatively stable (because it is attached to the shoreline or the seabed), drift (or pack) ice undergoes relatively complex deformation processes that ultimately give rise to sea ice&#x27;s typically wide variety of landscapes. Wind is the main driving force, along with ocean currents. The Coriolis force and sea ice surface tilt have also been invoked. These driving forces induce a state of stress within the drift ice zone. An ice floe converging toward another and pushing against it will generate a state of &quot;compression&quot; at the boundary between both. The ice cover may also undergo a state of &quot;tension&quot;, resulting in divergence and fissure opening. If two floes drift sideways past each other while remaining in contact, this will create a state of &quot;shear&quot;.

=== Deformation ===
Sea ice deformation results from the interaction between ice floes as they are driven against each other. The result may be of three types of features: 1) &quot;Rafted ice&quot;, when one piece is overriding another; 2) &quot;Pressure ridges&quot;, a line of broken ice forced downward (to make up the &quot;keel&quot;) and upward (to make the &quot;sail&quot;); and 3) &quot;Hummock&quot;, a hillock of broken ice that forms an uneven surface. A &quot;shear ridge&quot; is a pressure ridge that formed under shear – it tends to be more linear than a ridge induced only by compression. A &quot;new ridge&quot; is a recent feature – it is sharp-crested, with its side sloping at an angle exceeding 40 degrees. In contrast, a &quot;weathered ridge&quot; is one with a rounded crest and with sides sloping at less than 40 degrees. Stamukhi are yet another type of pile-up but these are grounded and are therefore relatively stationary. They result from the interaction between fast ice and the drifting pack ice.

&quot;Level ice&quot; is sea ice that has not been affected by deformation and is therefore relatively flat.

=== Leads and polynyas ===
Leads and polynyas are areas of open water that occur within sea ice expanses even though air temperatures are below freezing. They provide a direct interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere, which is important for the wildlife. Leads are narrow and linear, varying in width from meters to kilometers. During the winter, the water in leads quickly freezes up. They are also used for navigation purposes – even when refrozen, the ice in leads is thinner, allowing icebreakers access to an easier sail path and submarines to surface more easily. Polynyas are more uniform in size than leads and are also larger – two types are recognized: 1) &quot;Sensible-heat polynyas&quot;, caused by the upwelling of warmer water and 2) &quot;Latent-heat polynyas&quot;, resulting from persistent winds from the coastline.

==Formation==

Only the top layer of water needs to cool to the freezing point. Convection of the surface layer involves the top , down to the pycnocline of increased density.

In calm water, the first sea ice to form on the surface is a skim of separate crystals which initially are in the form of tiny discs, floating flat on the surface and of diameter less than . Each disc has its c-axis vertical and grows outwards laterally. At a certain point such a disc shape becomes unstable and the growing isolated crystals take on a hexagonal, stellar form, with long fragile arms stretching out over the surface. These crystals also have their c-axis vertical. The dendritic arms are very fragile and soon break off, leaving a mixture of discs and arm fragments. With any kind of turbulence in the water, these fragments break up further into random-shaped small crystals which form a suspension of increasing density in the surface water, an ice type called frazil or grease ice. In quiet conditions the frazil crystals soon freeze together to form a continuous thin sheet of young ice; in its early stages, when it is still transparent – that is the ice called &quot;nilas&quot;. Once nilas has formed, a quite different growth process occurs, in which water freezes on to the bottom of the existing ice sheet, a process called &quot;congelation&quot; growth. This growth process yields first-year ice.

In rough water, fresh sea ice is formed by the cooling of the ocean as heat is lost into the atmosphere. The uppermost layer of the ocean is supercooled to slightly below the freezing point, at which time tiny ice platelets (frazil ice) form. With time, this process leads to a mushy surface layer, known as grease ice. Frazil ice formation may also be started by snowfall, rather than supercooling. Waves and wind then act to compress these ice particles into larger plates, of several meters in diameter, called pancake ice. These float on the ocean surface and collide with one another, forming upturned edges. In time, the pancake ice plates may themselves be rafted over one another or frozen together into a more solid ice cover, known as consolidated pancake ice. Such ice has a very rough appearance on top and bottom.

If sufficient snow falls on sea ice to depress the freeboard below sea level, sea water will flow in and a layer of ice will form of mixed snow/sea water. This is particularly common around Antarctica.

Russian scientist Vladimir Vize (1886–1954) devoted his life to study the Arctic ice pack and developed the &quot;Scientific Prediction of Ice Conditions Theory&quot;, for which he was widely acclaimed in academic circles. He applied this theory in the field in the Kara Sea, which led to the discovery of Vize Island.

==Yearly freeze and melt cycle==

The annual freeze and melt cycle is set by the annual cycle of solar insolation and of ocean and atmospheric temperature and of variability in this annual cycle.

In the Arctic, the area of ocean covered by sea ice increases over winter from a minimum in September to a maximum in March or sometimes February, before melting over the summer. In the Antarctic, where the seasons are reversed, the annual minimum is typically in February and the annual maximum in September or October. The presence of sea ice abutting the calving fronts of ice shelves has been shown to influence glacier flow and potentially the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet.

The growth and melt rate are also affected by the state of the ice itself. During growth, the ice thickening due to freezing (as opposed to dynamics) is itself dependent on the thickness, so that the ice growth slows as the ice thickens. Likewise, during melt, thinner sea ice melts faster. This leads to different behaviour between multiyear and first year ice. In addition, melt ponds on the ice surface during the melt season lower the albedo such that more solar radiation is absorbed, leading to a feedback where melt is accelerated. The presence of melt ponds is affected by the permeability of the sea ice (i.e. whether meltwater can drain) and the topography of the sea ice surface (i.e. the presence of natural basins for the melt ponds to form in). First year ice is flatter than multiyear ice due to the lack of dynamic ridging, so ponds tend to have greater area. They also have lower albedo since they are on thinner ice, which blocks less of the solar radiation from reaching the dark ocean below.

==Physical properties==
Sea ice is a composite material made up of pure ice, liquid brine, air, and salt. The volumetric fractions of these components—ice, brine, and air—determine the key physical properties of sea ice, including thermal conductivity, heat capacity, latent heat, density, elastic modulus, and mechanical strength. Brine volume fraction depends on sea-ice salinity and temperature, while sea-ice salinity mainly depends on ice age and thickness. During the ice growth period, its bulk brine volume is typically below 5%. Air volume fraction during ice growth period is typically around 1–2 %, but may substantially increase upon ice warming. Air volume of sea ice in can be as high as 15 % in summer and 4 % in autumn. Both brine and air volumes influence sea-ice density values, which are typically around 840–910 kg/m3 for first-year ice. Sea-ice density is a significant source of errors in sea-ice thickness retrieval using radar and laser satellite altimetry, resulting in uncertainties of 0.3–0.4 m.

==Monitoring and observations==

Changes in sea ice conditions are best demonstrated by the rate of melting over time. A composite record of Arctic ice demonstrates that the floes&#x27; retreat began around 1900, experiencing more rapid melting beginning within the past 50 years. Satellite study of sea ice began in 1979 and became a much more reliable measure of long-term changes in sea ice. In comparison to the extended record, the sea-ice extent in the polar region by September 2007 was only half the recorded mass that had been estimated to exist within the 1950–1970 period.

Arctic sea ice extent ice hit an all-time low in September 2012, when the ice was determined to cover only 24% of the Arctic Ocean, offsetting the previous low of 29% in 2007. Predictions of when the first &quot;ice free&quot; Arctic summer might occur vary.

Antarctic sea ice extent gradually increased in the period of satellite observations, which began in 1979, until a rapid decline in southern hemisphere spring of 2016.

=== Effects of climate change ===
Sea ice provides an ecosystem for various polar species, particularly the polar bear, whose environment is being threatened as global warming causes the ice to melt more as the Earth&#x27;s temperature gets warmer. Furthermore, the sea ice itself functions to help keep polar climates cool, since the ice exists in expansive enough amounts to maintain a cold environment. At this, sea ice&#x27;s relationship with global warming is cyclical; the ice helps to maintain cool climates, but as the global temperature increases, the ice melts and is less effective in keeping those climates cold. The bright, shiny surface (albedo) of the ice also serves a role in maintaining cooler polar temperatures by reflecting much of the sunlight that hits it back into space. As the sea ice melts, its surface area shrinks, diminishing the size of the reflective surface and therefore causing the earth to absorb more of the sun&#x27;s heat. As the ice melts it lowers the albedo thus causing more heat to be absorbed by the Earth and further increase the amount of melting ice. Though the size of the ice floes is affected by the seasons, even a small change in global temperature can greatly affect the amount of sea ice and due to the shrinking reflective surface that keeps the ocean cool, this sparks a cycle of ice shrinking and temperatures warming. As a result, the polar regions are the most susceptible places to climate change on the planet.

Furthermore, sea ice affects the movement of ocean waters. In the freezing process, much of the salt in ocean water is squeezed out of the frozen crystal formations, though some remains frozen in the ice. This salt becomes trapped beneath the sea ice, creating a higher concentration of salt in the water beneath ice floes. This concentration of salt contributes to the salinated water&#x27;s density and this cold, denser water sinks to the bottom of the ocean. This cold water moves along the ocean floor towards the equator, while warmer water on the ocean surface moves in the direction of the poles. This is referred to as &quot;conveyor belt motion&quot; and is a regularly occurring process.

==Modelling==
In order to gain a better understanding about the variability, numerical sea ice models are used to perform sensitivity studies. The two main ingredients are the ice dynamics and the thermodynamical properties (see Sea ice emissivity modelling, Sea ice growth processes and Sea ice thickness). There are many sea ice model computer codes available for doing this, including the CICE numerical suite.

Many global climate models (GCMs) have sea ice implemented in their numerical simulation scheme in order to capture the ice–albedo feedback correctly. Examples include:
* The Louvain-la-Neuve Sea Ice Model is a numerical model of sea ice designed for climate studies and operational oceanography developed at Université catholique de Louvain. It is coupled to the ocean general circulation model OPA (Ocean Parallélisé) and is freely available as a part of the Nucleus for European Modeling of the Ocean.
* The MIT General Circulation Model is a global circulation model developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology includes a package for sea-ice. The code is freely available there.
* The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research develops the Community Sea Ice Model.
* CICE is run by the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The project is open source and designed as a component of GCM, although it provides a standalone mode.
* The Finite-Element Sea-Ice Ocean Model developed at Alfred Wegener Institute uses an unstructured grid.
* The neXt Generation Sea-Ice model (neXtSIM) is a Lagrangian model using an adaptive and unstructured triangular mesh and includes a new and unique class of rheological model called Maxwell-Elasto-Brittle to treat the ice dynamics. This model is developed at the Nansen Center in Bergen, Norway.

The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project offers a standard protocol for studying the output of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. The coupling takes place at the atmosphere-ocean interface where the sea ice may occur.

In addition to global modeling, various regional models deal with sea ice. Regional models are employed for seasonal forecasting experiments and for process studies.

==Ecology==
Sea ice is part of the Earth&#x27;s biosphere. When sea water freezes, the ice is riddled with brine-filled channels which sustain sympagic organisms such as bacteria, algae, copepods and annelids, which in turn provide food for animals such as krill and specialised fish like the bald notothen, fed upon in turn by larger animals such as emperor penguins and minke whales.

A decline of seasonal sea ice puts the survival of Arctic species such as ringed seals and polar bears at risk.

== Extraterrestrial presence ==

Other element and compounds have been speculated to exist as oceans and seas on extraterrestrial planets. Scientists notably suspect the existence of &quot;icebergs&quot; of solid diamond and corresponding seas of liquid carbon on the ice giants, Neptune and Uranus. This is due to extreme pressure and heat at the core, that would turn carbon into a supercritical fluid.

<doc id="343226" wikidata="Q60343" url="?curid=343226" title="Rudolf Lange">
<text>Rudolf Lange (18 April 1910 – 23 February 1945) was a German SS-&quot;Standartenführer&quot; and police official during the Nazi era. After the invasion of the Soviet Union, he served in &quot;Einsatzgruppe A&quot; before becoming a commander of the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; (SiPo) and &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD) forces in Riga, &quot;Generalbezirk Lettland&quot; (today, Latvia). He participated in the January 1942 Wannsee Conference, at which the genocidal Final Solution to the Jewish Question was planned, and was largely responsible for implementing the murder of Latvia&#x27;s Jewish population during the Holocaust. He died at the Battle of Poznań in the closing months of the Second World War in Europe.

== Early life ==
Lange was born in Weißwasser, then in Prussian Silesia, but now located in Saxony. His father was a railway construction supervisor and the family were evangelical Protestants. Lange finished high school in Staßfurt in 1928 and studied law at the University of Halle, the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the University of Jena. While at school, he joined the anti-democratic and antisemitic fencing fraternity, &quot;Germania&quot;, and received several dueling scars. He passed his first state law examination in July 1932 and served his legal clerkship in Staßfurt, Magdeburg, Torgau and Naumburg. He completed his dissertation on the &quot;instruction right of the employer&quot; and received a doctor of law degree in December 1933 just after joining the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) on 14 November of that year. He completed his legal training at the Gestapo office of Halle in 1935, and passed the second state law examination on 18 August 1936.

== SS career in Germany ==
In September 1936, Lange was hired as a probationary employee by the Gestapo office in Berlin. On 1 May 1937, he was admitted to the Nazi Party (membership number 4,922,869). Determined to build a career with the police, he left the SA and transferred to the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) (member number 290,308). In August 1937, he became a government lawyer in the civil service system and, on 30 September 1937, he was assigned to the staff of the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD), the SS intelligence service. Lange adopted the SS ideology wholeheartedly and left the evangelical Protestant church in 1937.

In May 1938, just after the &quot;Anschluss&quot; with Austria, Lange was transferred to the new Gestapo office in Vienna to supervise the takeover of the Austrian police system. There, he met and worked with Franz Walter Stahlecker, who later became his commanding officer in Riga. Lange was commissioned an &quot;Untersturmführer&quot; on 6 July 1938 and, later the same year, he was promoted to &quot;Sturmführer&quot;. In Vienna, his duties involved &quot;fighting the enemy&quot;, specifically Jews and the Catholic Church. He was involved in the persecution of Viennese Jews, including the brutal attacks, arrests and looting of property that occurred during the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; pogrom of November 1938. In June 1939, Lange was transferred to Stuttgart as the deputy head of the Gestapo regional headquarters.

In September 1939, the security and police agencies of Nazi Germany (with the exception of the Orpo) were consolidated into the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) of the SS, headed by Reinhard Heydrich. The Gestapo became &quot;Amt IV&quot; (Office IV) of the RSHA and Heinrich Müller became the Gestapo chief under Heydrich. Lange&#x27;s career continued to advance in the new RSHA organization. In April 1940, he was promoted to &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot;. From May to July 1940, he served as the acting head of the state police offices in Weimar and Erfurt. This was followed by an appointment as the deputy head of the office of the Inspector of the SiPo and SD in &quot;Wehrkreis&quot; (military district) IX, headquartered in Kassel. On 17 September 1940, Lange was assigned as the deputy head of the Gestapo in Berlin under Walter Blume. On 20 April 1941, he was promoted to SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot;.

== Mass murderer in Latvia ==

On 5 June 1941, Lange was ordered to Pretzsch and the command staff of &quot;Einsatzgruppe A&quot;, headed by now SS-&quot;Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Polizei&quot; Stahlecker. Lange was a &quot;Teilkommando&quot; (detachment) leader in &quot;Einsatzkommando 2&quot;, or EK2. He was one of the few people aware of the &quot;Führerbefehl&quot; or &quot;fundamental orders&quot; for the so-called &quot;Jewish problem&quot; in Latvia. According to Lange himself:From the very beginning, the goal of EK2 was that radical solution of the Jewish problem by killing all Jews.

On 3 December 1941, he was promoted as commander of EK2, replacing Eduard Strauch. At the same time, he was also made the commander of the SiPo and SD in the newly established &quot;Generalbezirk Lettland&quot;, with the title &quot;Kommandanteur des Sicherheitspolizei und SD&quot; (KdS). He was in charge of Department IV of the SD. The department was the &quot;hub of the whole SD organization in Latvia, the other departments served it.&quot; Matters of formal rank and titles were never clear in the Nazi occupation regime for Latvia, as the lines of authority within agencies and the relationship between one agency and others were &quot;ambiguous, overlapping, and unclear&quot;. Nevertheless, Lange is widely recognized as one of the primary perpetrators of the Holocaust in Latvia.

His headquarters were in Riga, on Reimersa Street. From the beginning of his involvement in Latvia, Lange gave orders to squads of Latvians, such as the Arajs Kommando, that the Germans had organised to carry out massacres in the smaller cities. According to one historian, Viktors Arājs was &quot;held on a short leash&quot; by Lange. Another local organisation receiving orders from Lange was the Vagulāns Kommando, which was responsible for the Jelgava massacres in July and August 1941. Lange also personally supervised executions conducted by the Arājs commando. He appears to have ordered that all the SD officers should personally participate in the killings.

After the Nazi regime decided to deport Jews from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia to the east, Lange was in charge of receiving the deportees coming to Riga. In this connection, on 8 November 1941, he issued detailed instructions to Hinrich Lohse, who was &quot;Reichskommissar Ostland&quot;, regarding the transport of 50,000 Jews to the east, with 25,000 going to Riga and 25,000 to Belarus. At the same time, Lange was organising the construction of the Salaspils concentration camp, originally intended to accommodate these deportees. Because the Salaspils camp would not be ready by the time the Jews would arrive, Lange decided to send the transports to an abandoned estate near Riga called Jungfernhof or Jumpravmuiza, which would be set up as Jungfernhof concentration camp.

In November 1941 Lange was involved in the planning and carrying out the murder of 24,000 Latvian Jews from the Riga ghetto which occurred on 30 November and 8 December 1941. This crime has come to be known as the Rumbula massacre. In addition to the Latvian Jews, another 1,000 Jews from Germany were also murdered. They had been brought to Latvia on the first train of deportees, which arrived on 29 November 1941. Following the 29 November train, more rail transports of Jews began arriving in Riga from Germany, starting on 3 December 1941. The Jews on the first few transports were not immediately housed in the ghetto, but were left at Jungfernhof concentration camp. In May 1942, Lange issued orders to SS-&quot;Obersturmführer&quot; Günter Tabbert to kill the surviving Jews in the Daugavpils ghetto. Only about 450 Jews survived in Daugavpils after this action, which involved killing of the sick, children, infants and hospital workers. In addition to Tabbert, the Arajs Kommando of native Latvians was responsible for a major part of these killings.

Lange was promoted to SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; in November 1943. During the war years, he was awarded the Iron Cross, 1st and 2nd class. He remained the commander of the SiPo and SD in Latvia until January 1945. During his tenure, he continued killing operations against Jews, partisans and political opponents, some of which involved in the use of gas vans. One of his last actions in Riga was in &quot;Sonderaktion 1005&quot;, the operation that used prisoners to exhume mass graves and burn the bodies of the victims of Nazi atrocities in an attempt to prevent the advancing Soviet forces from discovering them.

== Wannsee Conference ==
Lange was invited to the Wannsee Conference in January 1942 by SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Heydrich, the conference organizer. Lange, then an SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot;, was the lowest-ranking officer present and, at 31, the youngest attendee. The minutes of the meeting specifically noted that Lange was there as the representative (&quot;Vertreter&quot;) of the commander (&quot;Befehlshaber&quot;) of SiPo and SD forces in the &quot;Reichskommissariat Ostland&quot;, who at the time was SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Franz Walter Stahlecker. Stahlecker was not invited because he was not familiar with the realities of the Jewish deportations and was not located in Riga. Heydrich viewed Lange&#x27;s first-hand experience in conducting the mass murder of deported Jews, in Latvia, as valuable for the conference. Instead of Lange, Heydrich could have invited either Karl Jäger or Erich Ehrlinger, who commanded the SiPo and SD in Lithuania and Belarus respectively, and were responsible for similar massacres. He chose Lange because Riga was the main deportation destination, and because Lange&#x27;s doctorate and legal acumen made him seem more intellectual than the other two men. In Ian Kershaw&#x27;s biography &quot;Hitler 1936-1945 Nemesis&quot;, in the section of the book covering the beginnings of the Holocaust and the Wannsee Conference, the SS major is twice mistakenly referred to as Dr. &quot;Otto Lange&quot;.

== Death ==
Toward the end of January 1945, Lange was appointed Commander (&quot;Befehlshaber&quot;) of the SiPo and the SD of Reichsgau Wartheland. Its capital city of Posen lay on the main route between Warsaw and Berlin and had to be taken by the Soviet Red Army before their assault on the German capital could begin. Soon after he reached the city, it was surrounded by the Red Army and was declared a &quot;fortress city&quot; (&quot;Festung&quot;) by Adolf Hitler. Lange, who could not have any doubts about his fate if taken prisoner, directed the police under his command with fanaticism. He was wounded during the Battle of Poznań and the siege of the city by Soviet forces, and he was promoted to SS-&quot;Standartenführer&quot; on 30 January 1945. At Hitler&#x27;s behest, on 6 February, he was awarded the German Cross in gold. The final assault on the city&#x27;s citadel came on 23 February 1945, after a last-ditch defence by the remnants of the German garrison. Reports of the exact circumstances of Lange&#x27;s death vary, but he is said to have been killed on or around that date, either in combat or by suicide, and is buried in the military cemetery in Poznań.

== Character ==
Lange was said to have been a favourite student of Reinhard Heydrich and Heinrich Himmler. He demanded unconditional obedience from his subordinates. Joseph Berman, a survivor of one of the concentration camps administered by Lange, described him as follows:As far as Lange is concerned, he was the biggest murderer I have ever known. To write a book about him would definitely not be enough. As he is dead, it is no use talking about him. I would, however, mention that he was one of the most notorious anti-Semites in the 20th century. He hated Jews so much that he could not look at them; one never wanted to pass him either in the motor pool or anywhere else.

Lange made himself one of the most feared officials among those responsible for the Riga ghetto. He supervised the arrival of the transports, aided by SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Gerhard Maywald, whom historian Gertrude Schneider, a survivor of the Riga ghetto, describes as Lange&#x27;s &quot;sidekick&quot;. Lange personally shot a young man, Werner Koppel, who he felt was not opening a railway car door fast enough. Schneider described Lange&#x27;s appearance:Even though he was somewhat smaller and darker than the blond, blue-eyed Maywald, he looked very handsome in his fur-collared uniform coat and seemed every inch an officer and a gentleman. It never occurred to the newcomers to suspect such a man of being a murderer.

<text>Wednesbury ( ) is a market town in the Sandwell district, in the county of the West Midlands, England - historically in Staffordshire. It is located near the source of the River Tame, and is part of the Black Country. Wednesbury is situated 5 miles (8km) south-east of Wolverhampton, 3 miles (4.4km) south-west of Walsall, and 7 miles (11.8km) north-west of Birmingham. At the 2021 Census, the town&#x27;s built-up area had a population of 20,313.

==History==
===Medieval and earlier===

The substantial remains of a large ditch excavated in St Mary&#x27;s Road in 2008, following the contours of the hill and predating the Early Medieval period, has been interpreted as part of a hilltop enclosure and possibly the Iron Age hillfort long suspected on the site. The first authenticated spelling of the name was Wodensbyri, written in an endorsement on the back of the copy of the will of Wulfric Spot, dated 1004. Wednesbury (&quot;Woden&#x27;s borough&quot;) is one of a number of places in England to be named after the pre-Christian deity Woden, the leader of the Old English pantheon. 

During the Anglo-Saxon period there are believed to have been two battles fought in Wednesbury, in 592 and 715. According to The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; there was &quot;a great slaughter&quot; in 592 and &quot;Ceawlin was driven out&quot;. Ceawlin was a king of Wessex and the second Bretwalda, or overlord of all Britain. The 715 battle was between Mercia (of which Wednesbury was part) and the kingdom of Wessex. Both sides allegedly claimed to have won the battle, although it is believed that the victory inclined to Wessex.

Wednesbury was fortified by Æthelflæd (Ethelfleda), daughter of Alfred the Great and known as the Lady of Mercia. She erected five fortifications to defend against the Danes at Bridgnorth, Tamworth, Stafford and Warwick, with Wednesbury in the centre. Wednesbury&#x27;s fort would probably have been an extension of an older fortification and made of a stone foundation with a wooden stockade above. Earthwork ramparts and water filled ditches would probably have added to its strength. A plaque on the gardens between Ethelfleda Terrace and St Bartholomew&#x27;s church states that the gardens there – created in the 1950s – used stone from the , or fighting platform, of the old fort. Exploration of the gardens reveals several dressed stones, which appear to be those referred to on the plaque.

In 1086, the Domesday Book describes Wednesbury (&quot;Wadnesberie&quot;) as being a thriving rural community encompassing Bloxwich and Shelfield (now part of Walsall). During the Middle Ages the town was a rural village, with each family farming a strip of land with nearby heath being used for grazing. The town was held by the king until the reign of Henry II, when it passed to the Heronville family. 

Medieval Wednesbury was very small, and its inhabitants would appear to have been farmers and farm workers. In 1315, coal pits were first recorded, which led to an increase in the number of jobs. Nail making was also in progress during these times. William Paget was born in Wednesbury in 1505, the son of a nail maker. He became Secretary of State, a Knight of the Garter and an Ambassador. He was one of executors of the will of Henry VIII.

It was historically when in Staffordshire a part of the Hundred of Offlow.

===Post-Medieval===
In the 17th century Wednesbury pottery – &quot;Wedgbury ware&quot; – was being sold as far away as Worcester, while white clay from Monway Field was used to make tobacco pipes.

By the 18th century the main occupations were coal mining and nail making. With the introduction of the first turnpike road in 1727 and the development of canals and later the railways came a big increase in population. In 1769 the first Birmingham Canal was cut to link Wednesbury&#x27;s coalfields to the Birmingham industries. The canal banks were soon full of factories. 

In 1743 the Wesleys and their new Methodist movement were severely tested. Early in the year, John and Charles Wesley preached in the open air on the Tump. They were warmly received and made welcome by the vicar. Soon afterwards another preacher came and was rude about the current state of the Anglican clergy. This angered the vicar, and the magistrates published a notice ordering that any further preachers were to be brought to them. When Wesley next came his supporters were still there but a crowd of others heckled him and threw stones. Later the crowd came to his lodgings and took him to the magistrates, but they declined to have anything to do with Wesley or the crowd. The crowd ill-treated Wesley and nearly killed him but he remained calm. Eventually they came to their senses and returned him to his hosts.

Soon afterward the vicar asked his congregation to pledge not to associate with Methodists, and some who refused to pledge had their windows smashed. Others who hosted Methodist meetings had the contents of their houses destroyed. This terrible episode came to an end in December when the vicar died. After that mainstream Anglican and Methodist relations were generally cordial. Methodism grew strongly and Wesley visited often, almost until his death. Francis Asbury, Richard Whatcoat and the Earl of Dartmouth are among those who attended Methodist meetings, all to have a profound effect on the United States.

A steam tram service opened to Dudley, also serving Tipton, on 21 January 1884. The line was electrified in 1907 but discontinued in March 1930 on its replacement by Midland Red buses.

Wednesbury was incorporated as a municipal borough, with its headquarters at Wednesbury Town Hall, in 1886, the district contained only the civil parish of Wednesbury, on 1 April 1966 the district was abolished and merged with the County Borough of West Bromwich and the County Borough of Walsall. The parish was also abolished on 1 April 1966 and merged with West Bromwich and Walsall. In 1961 the parish had a population of 34,511.

In 1887, Brunswick Park was opened to celebrate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee.

====20th and 21st centuries====
On the evening of 31 January 1916, Wednesbury was hit by one of the first wave of German Zeppelins aimed at Britain during the First World War. Joseph Smith and his three children were killed in their house in the King Street area. His wife survived, having left the house to investigate the cause of a loud noise at a nearby factory, caused by the first bombs falling.

The first council houses in Wednesbury were built in the early 1920s, but progress was slow compared to nearby towns including Tipton and West Bromwich. By 1930, a mere 206 families had been rehoused from slums. However, the building of council houses quickened at the start of the 1930s; the 1,000th council house was occupied before the end of 1931. By 1935, some 1,250 older houses had been demolished or earmarked for demolition. By 1944 there were more than 3,000 council properties; by 1959, more than 5,000. The largest development in Wednesbury was the Hateley Heath estate in the late 1940s and early 1950s, which straddled the border of Wednesbury and West Bromwich.

In 1947, the Corporation granted a licence for the operation of a cinema, on the condition that no children under 15 were to be admitted on Sundays. The cinema operator challenged this decision in court, claiming that the imposition of the condition was outside the corporation&#x27;s powers. The court used this case to establish a general test for overturning the decision of a public body in this type of case, which is now known as &quot;Wednesbury unreasonableness&quot;.

The borough of Wednesbury ceased to exist in 1966. Much of its area was absorbed into West Bromwich and small parts went into the County Borough of Walsall. The Wednesbury section of Hateley Heath was absorbed into West Bromwich, and Wednesbury gained the Friar Park estate from West Bromwich. The Dangerfield Lane estate (developed during the interwar and early postwar years) was absorbed into Darlaston, which was now part of an expanded Walsall borough. In 1974 West Bromwich amalgamated with Warley (i.e. Oldbury, Rowley Regis and Smethwick) to form the present-day borough of Sandwell. Wednesbury has the postcode &quot;WS10&quot;, shared with Darlaston in the borough of Walsall.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Wednesbury&#x27;s traditional industry declined and unemployment rose, but since 1990 new developments such as a new light industrial estate, a retail park and the pedestrian-only Union Street have given a new look to the town. The traditional market is still a feature of the bustling centre, and the streets around Market Place are now a protected conservation area.

In the late 1980s, land near junction 9 of the M6 motorway was designated as the location for a retail development. Swedish furniture retailer Ikea was the first to move in; its superstore opened in January 1991. In the 1990s the retail park grew to include several more large units, but most of these were empty by 2009 due to the recession. However, most of the units were occupied again by 2012 and the retail is home to numerous retailers. The retail park was expanded in 2017 with the construction of more retail units and &#x27;eateries&#x27;, and the car park was remodelled to create more parking spaces.

Wednesbury was the scene of two major tragedies during the second half of the 20th century. On 21 December 1977, four siblings aged between 4 and 12 years died in a house fire in School Road, Friar Park, at the height of the national firefighters strike. The house was demolished soon afterwards, leaving a gap in a terrace of council houses. On 24 September 1984, four pupils and a teacher from Stuart Bathurst RC High School were killed when their minibus was struck by a roll of steel which fell from the back of a lorry, on Wood Green Road close to the park keepers house.

For well over 100 years, Wednesbury was dominated by the huge Patent Shaft steel works, which opened during the 19th century and closed in 1980. The factory was demolished in 1983, and within a decade had been developed for light industry and services. The iron gates of the factory still exist and are mounted on the traffic island at Holyhead Road and Dudley Street.

The town&#x27;s current bus station was opened in the autumn of 2004 on the site of its predecessor.

In 2003, Wednesbury Museum and Art Gallery staged &quot;Stuck in Wednesbury&quot;, the first show in a public gallery of the Stuckism international art movement.

The archives for Wednesbury Borough are held at Sandwell Community History and Archives Service in Smethwick.

==Oakeswell Hall==
Second in importance to Wednesbury manor house was Oakeswell Hall, built c. 1421 by William Byng. The property descended to the family of Jennyns. By 1662 the house was known as Okeswell or Hopkins New Hall Place (it being adjacent to the Hopkins family&#x27;s New Hall Fields). Richard Parkes, a Quaker ironmaster, bought it in 1707 and moved in the following year. During the late 18th and early 19th centuries it was a farmhouse. Between 1825 and 1962 it had several different owners, including Joseph Smith (the first town clerk) who greatly restored it. In 1962 it was demolished.

Dr Walter Chancellor Garman (1860–1923), a general practitioner, and his wife, Margaret Frances Magill lived at Oakeswell Hall. Their children included the Garman sisters who were associated with the Bloomsbury group. There were nine children, seven sisters and two brothers: Mary (1898), Sylvia (1899), Kathleen (1901), Douglas (1903), Rosalind (1904), Helen (1906), Mavin (1907), Ruth (1909) and Lorna (1911).

== Demography ==
At the 2021 census, Wednesbury&#x27;s built-up area population was recorded as having a population of 20,313. Of the findings, the ethnicity and religious composition of the wards separately were:

The religious composition of the built-up area at the 2021 Census was recorded as:

==Roads==
Wednesbury is on Thomas Telford&#x27;s London to Holyhead road, built in the early 19th century. The section between Wednesbury and Moxley was widened in 1997 to form a dual carriageway, completing the Black Country Spine Road that had been in development since 1995 when the route between Wednesbury and West Bromwich had opened, along with a one-mile route to the north of Moxley linking with the Black Country Route. The original plan was for a completely new route between Wednesbury and Moxley, but this was abandoned as part of cost-cutting measures, as were the planned grade-separated junctions, which were abandoned in favour of conventional roundabouts.

The bus station, rebuilt in 2004, is in the town centre near the swimming baths with links to Wolverhampton, West Bromwich, Walsall and Dudley where connections can be made to the Merry Hill Shopping Centre. The previous direct link to Merry Hill was withdrawn due to traffic congestion as was the direct link to Birmingham.

==Railways==

Wednesbury was first connected to the rail network in the mid-19th century, and has been served by heavy and light rail for all but six years since then.

Since 1999, Wednesbury has been served by the West Midlands Metro light rail (tram) system, with stops at Great Western Street and Wednesbury Parkway. The maintenance depot is also here. It runs from Wolverhampton to Birmingham, and the line for a proposed extension to Brierley Hill is currently being cleared ready for the new track bed and electrification. It will use sections of the South Staffordshire Line alongside freight traffic which will run from Walsall to Brierley Hill via Wednesbury Town and Dudley but freight traffic may start later than the metro due to relaying of the track and assessing the space required for the joint line to work. It may also be used by tram-trains which can run on heavy rail.

The South Staffordshire Line between Walsall and Stourbridge served Wednesbury until 1993. Passenger services were withdrawn after Wednesbury railway station closed in 1964 under the Beeching Axe, but a steel terminal soon opened on the site and did not close until December 1992, with the railway closing on 19 March 1993 after serving the town for some 150 years.

Until 1972, the town was served by the former Great Western Railway line between Birmingham and Wolverhampton at Wednesbury Central station. Passenger trains were withdrawn at this time, with Wednesbury-Birmingham section of the line through West Bromwich closing. The Bilston-Wolverhampton section survived for another decade before closing over the winter of 1982/83. The final section between Wednesbury and Bilston, serving a scrapyard at Bilston, remained open until 30 August 1992, before the line was closed to allow for the creation of the Midland Metro, which opened in May 1999.

Wednesbury&#x27;s rail links are set to improve further with the completion of a new Metro line running to Brierley Hill via Tipton and Dudley, making use of the disused South Staffordshire Line. Originally planned to open in 2023, the project was put back due to lack of funds and is now being built in two parts with Part One (to Dudley) now expected to open in 2025. The completion of the extension depends upon funds being available.

==Notable employers==

===Former===
Patent Shaft (part of the Cammel Laird group) steelworks was erected on land off Leabrook Road near the border with Tipton in 1840, serving the town for 140 years before its closure on 17 April 1980 – an early casualty of the recession. Demolition of the site took place in 1983.

Metro Cammell (Metropolitan Company) set up business after acquiring all of the assets of the Patent Shaft in 1902, in 1919 Vickers ltd acquired the shares of The Metropolitan Company ltd, in 1929 Vickers ltd and Cammel laird and Co merged their interests to form The Metropolitan Cammel Carriage and Wagon works Co ltd, where it produced railway coach bodies, turntables, Bridges, railway wagons and pressings at the Old Park works. The plant remained opened until 1964. The work and its workers were transferred to the Washwood heath works Birmingham.

The site was sold to The Rubbery Owen group.

F.H. Lloyd steelworks was formed at a site on Park Lane near the boundaries with Walsall and Darlaston during the 1880s, and provided employment for some 100 years. However, F.H. Lloyd was hit hard by the economic problems of the 1970s and early 1980s, and went out of business in 1982. Triplex Iron Foundry of Tipton then took the site over, but the new owners kept the factory open for just six years and it was then sold to Swedish home products company IKEA in 1988, being demolished almost immediately to make way for the superstore, which opened in January 1991.

A Cargo Club supermarket-style retail warehouse, part of the Nurdin and Peacock group, opened in July 1994. It was one of three Cargo Club stores in Britain, and the venture was not a success: by the end of 1995 it had been shut down following heavy losses.

===Current===
Property developers J.J. Gallagher had purchased the bulk of the Lloyd site in 1988 and once mineshafts were filled in, decontamination was completed the land was suitable for mass retail development. IKEA purchased the former F.H. Lloyd steel plant from Triplex in 1988, and opened one of its first British stores on the site in January 1991, just 14 months after the development had been given the go-ahead.

Morrisons opened a supermarket in the town centre on 4 November 2007, creating some 350 new jobs. A number of council bungalows and a section of the town centre shops had been demolished to make way for it. 

Quantum print and packaging Limited employs 30 people since relocating to Wednesbury in 2013 from their Willenhall base.
The Factory occupies a 30000 sq ft site in the town centre,

In 2016, successful German supermarket chain Lidl opened a new distribution centre just off Wood Green Road, on land near Junction 9 Retail Park. 

==Cock-fighting ballad==
A ballad about cock-fighting in the town called &quot;Wedgebury Cocking&quot; or &quot;Wednesbury Cocking&quot; became well known in the 19th century. It begins:

 &quot;At Wednesbury there was a cocking,&quot;
&quot;A match between Newton and Skrogging;&quot;

&quot;The colliers and nailers left work,&quot;

&quot;And all to Spittles&#x27; went jogging&quot;

&quot;To see this noble sport.&quot;

&quot;Many noted men there resorted,&quot;

&quot;And though they&#x27;d but little money,&quot;

&quot;Yet that they freely sported.&quot;
