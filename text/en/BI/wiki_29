<text>Carolynn Marie Hill (born January 3, 1961) is an American rock climber. Widely regarded as one of the leading competition climbers, traditional climbers (and particularly big wall climbers), sport climbers, and boulderers in the world during the late 1980s and early 1990s, she is famous for making the first free ascent of the difficult sheer rock face of &quot;The Nose&quot; on El Capitan in Yosemite Valley, and for repeating it the next year in less than 24 hours. She has been described as both one of the best female climbers in the world and one of the best climbers in the history of the sport. Hill was the first-ever female in history to redpoint a , and graded sport climbing route. Hill shaped rock climbing for women and became a public spokesperson, helping it gain wider popularity and arguing for sex equality. Hill has publicized climbing by appearing on television shows and documentaries and writing an autobiography, &quot;Climbing Free: My Life in the Vertical World&quot;. 

Hill was a gymnast early in life, nearly broke a world record lifting weights, and ran competitively. She took to climbing at a young age, showing a natural aptitude for the activity, and became a part of the climbing community in Southern California and Camp 4 in Yosemite Valley. She traveled around the United States during the early 1980s climbing increasingly difficult routes and setting records for first female ascents and for first ascents. From 1986 to 1992 Hill was one of the world&#x27;s most accomplished competition climbers, winning over thirty international titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1992, Hill left competitive climbing and returned to traditional climbing. She set for herself the challenge of free climbing &quot;The Nose&quot; of El Capitan, her greatest climbing feat. Hill continues to climb and has not stopped taking on ambitious climbs. As of 2013, she was a sponsored athlete for the Patagonia gear and clothing company and owned a small business that offered climbing courses.

==Early years==

===Childhood===
Born in Detroit, Michigan, Hill grew up in Fullerton, California. She is the fifth of seven children; her mother was a dental hygienist and her father an aerospace engineer. She was an active child who climbed everything from trees to street lights. Starting at age eight, she learned gymnastics but disliked the way girls &quot;had to smile and do cutesy little routines on the floor&quot;. Thus, even though she was part of a successful YMCA gymnastics team that competed in southern California and performed in halftime shows for the California Angels, she quit at the age of 12. In her autobiography, Hill describes feeling &quot;resistant to rules&quot;, an attitude she identified as both normal for her age and influenced by the era in which she grew up: &quot;My awareness of issues like women&#x27;s rights and the struggle for racial freedom began to grow&quot;. She even questioned the chores assigned in her family, noting the differences between the boys and girls—the boys had weekly tasks while the girls had daily tasks. During high school, Hill took up gymnastics again and became one of the top gymnasts in her state, a skill that eventually contributed to her climbing success. In particular, the ability to conceptualize a series of complex movements as small, distinct ones and to thrive under pressure gave Hill a significant edge.

===Introduction to climbing===
In 1975, Hill&#x27;s sister, Kathy Hill and her sister&#x27;s fiancé, Chuck Bludworth, took her on her first climbing trip; she was hooked, leading from the first day. For Hill, this activity became an escape from the emotional turmoil of her parents&#x27; divorce, and &quot;by her late teens she identified less with her imperfect family in Orange County than with an &#x27;imperfect family of friends&#x27; at climbing areas&quot;. Hill took her first trip to Yosemite, a central destination for climbers, at the age of 16, where she was introduced to the climbers at Camp 4. There she met Charlie Row, her first boyfriend. Their romance flourished; with him she climbed her first 5.11 and first big wall.

As a young teenager, Hill climbed in southern California, primarily in Joshua Tree National Park. She earned money for day trips out to the park by working at a Carl&#x27;s Jr. Bludworth initially taught her climbing culture; he subscribed to magazines and read books which Hill then devoured. She was influenced in particular by Yvon Chouinard&#x27;s ethic of &quot;leaving no trace&quot; on the rock. Moreover, the climbing of Beverly Johnson captured her imagination, particularly Johnson&#x27;s 10-day solo of Dihedral Wall on El Capitan. As Hill explains in her autobiography, &quot;I was awed, but not just by the know-how and hard work she&#x27;d put into her ascent. It was the courage and confidence that it took to put herself on the line, to do something on the cutting edge—to climb one of the world&#x27;s greatest big walls in one of the most challenging ways possible: solo. She had succeeded and she&#x27;d given women climbers like me enormous confidence to be ourselves and not feel limited by being a minority in a male-dominated sport.&quot;
Hill attended Fullerton College in the late 1970s, but she did not have a strong interest in any academic subject; instead she was focused on climbing. In the summers of 1976–78 and the early 1980s Hill frequently camped at Camp 4 in Yosemite Valley, becoming part of the climbing community centered there and joining the search and rescue team. In her autobiography, Hill describes the community as &quot;a ragged occupying army, annoying park rangers by eluding camp fees, overstaying their welcome, and comporting themselves like gypsies&quot;. As Hill describes it, climbing in the late 1970s and early 1980s was &quot;something that people who were outcasts in society did, people who were not conformists&quot;. As she had earlier, Hill worked in order to be able to climb. One summer, she writes, she survived in Camp 4 on only $75. In her autobiography, she describes how climbers eked out a life at the camp, recycling cans to pay for climbing ropes and subsisting on condiments and left-over food from tourists. However, Hill remembers &quot;these dirt-poor days ... [as] among the best and the most carefree of my life, and though my friends were often scoundrels, I felt their friendship convincingly.&quot;

Beverly Johnson had previously started to bridge the gender gap at Camp 4, but it remained strongly male-dominated. The community was particularly homosocial; its major historian calls it &quot;edgy&quot; rather than &quot;oppressive&quot; and argues that there was pressure on women to perform to men&#x27;s standards and that &quot;women had to contend with an army of men trying to maintain Camp 4 as a guy&#x27;s domain&quot;. There was no coherent female climbing community; rather, female climbers tended to adopt the masculine attitudes of their compatriots. In her autobiography, Hill writes that climbing &quot;back then was directed by a fraternity of men, and there was little encouragement of, or frankly, inclination for women to participate. Yet women climbers were out there.&quot; For example, from age 18 to 22, Hill climbed with Mari Gingery every weekend, completing an ascent of &quot;The Nose&quot; and then the first female-only ascent of &quot;The Shield&quot; on El Capitan over a period of six days.

Hill learned the essence of her climbing technique from the Stonemasters group during this time. She adopted the attitudes of traditional climbing, a style of climbing which emphasizes using removable protection rather than bolts (which scar the rock) and rewards climbers who climb a new route from bottom to top without stopping or starting over. She also became a dedicated free climber, which emphasizes climbing an entire route without hanging on the rope or relying on equipment to skip difficult sections. Early on she was a fearless climber but after &quot;a few death-defying experiences on routes with long run-outs&quot; she learned to be wary of falling.

Hill climbed with and became involved with climber John Long at the end of the 1970s. Their relationship began in the summer of 1978 when she heard him recite a poem he had written about a female climber and what kind of man she wanted.Hill and Long climbed together and worked out together, lifting weights and running. It was at his suggestion that she attempted to break the world record for the bench press in her weight class (); however, while she could easily lift while training, in competition she froze. Hill and Long spent the winter of 1981 in Las Vegas, Nevada, climbing during the day and working nights at &quot;dead end jobs&quot; like pizza waitress.

The following year Hill and Long moved from Las Vegas to Santa Monica, California, where she attended Santa Monica College (SMC) and majored in biology. She was recruited by the track coach even though she had no competitive running experience. After training for a few months, she placed third in the 1500 meters and fourth in the 3000 meters at the state meet, helping SMC to win the state championship. To make ends meet, she worked at an outdoor store, as a gym teacher, and occasionally appeared on daredevil television shows.

In 1983, Hill was interviewed by &quot;Ultrasport&quot;. They offered her a free flight to New York for the interview and as part of the trip she was taken to the Shawangunks, a famous nearby climbing area. Finding she liked the climbing environment and yearning for some new challenges, she decided to stay and moved to New Paltz, New York. At the same time, Long was preparing for a journey to Borneo and embarking on a career as a writer. The couple went their separate ways but remained friends. After moving to New York, Hill attended the State University of New York at New Paltz and graduated with a degree in biology in 1985.

==Climbing career==

Hill started to participate in climbing competitions in the mid-1980s, but one of her first significant accomplishments was in 1979. She became the first person to free climb &quot;Ophir Broke&quot; in Ophir, Colorado, which has a difficulty rating of 5.12d and was the hardest route ever climbed by a woman at that time. It was the hardest crack climb in Colorado at the time and there were only one or two harder ones in Yosemite. Long was amazed by her feat. He has said &quot;that&#x27;s when I knew for certain that this woman had extraordinary talent&quot;. The regional guidebook credits Long with the first free ascent of the route; Hill speculates the reason for this is that at the time she was an unknown climber and known only as Long&#x27;s partner and protege. In her autobiography, Hill explains that it was during this climb that she realized it is not a person&#x27;s size or strength but ability to be creative on the rock that is important: &quot;The big lesson for me ... was to realize that despite what appeared to be a limitation due to my small stature, I could create my own method of getting past a difficult section of rock. John&#x27;s size and power enabled him to make long reaches and explosive lunge moves that were completely out of my range. I, on the other hand, often found small intermediate holds that John couldn&#x27;t even imagine gripping ... Short or tall, man or woman, the rock is an objective medium that is equally open for interpretation by all.&quot;

Living near the Shawangunks during her college years, Hill pioneered many new free climbing routes. In 1984 at The Gunks she performed an on-sight first ascent of &quot;Yellow Crack&quot; (5.12c) and &quot;Vandals&quot; (5.13a); &quot;Vandals&quot; was the most difficult route on the East Coast at the time and the area&#x27;s first climb of its grade. Her lead of &quot;Yellow Crack&quot; was a very dangerous ascent, her climbing partner at the time Russ Ruffa calling it &quot;one of the boldest leads I&#x27;ve ever seen ... I had tried leading it. I knew you had to totally commit to doing the moves, otherwise the chance of surviving would be minimal. Those are the moments that really stand out—when you see someone totally on the edge.&quot; It was her climb of &quot;Vandals&quot; that led Hill to reconsider her climbing style; rather than begin the climb again every time she fell or leaned on the rope for support, she hung on the rope in her harness to gain more information about the climb. As she writes in her autobiography, &quot;In one moment I had, to some degree, thrown out years of climbing philosophy ... The subtle advantage of hanging on the rope to figure out the crux moves gave me the added information that helped me learn and eventually succeed on the route. The old style of climbing suddenly seemed rigid, limited, and contrived.&quot; That year, she performed a series of impressive feats, leading &quot;Tourist Treat&quot; on-sight with only one fall, &quot;perhaps the most difficult first ascent in the north country at the time&quot;. She was arguably &quot;the best climber in the Gunks&quot;, as local climbing legend Kevin Bein called her, and &quot;no man was climbing significantly better&quot; than her.

===Competitive career===
As a result of Hill&#x27;s impressive climbs in The Gunks, she was invited to climb in Europe in 1986. The French Alpine Club invited a group of elite American climbers to climb in the Verdon Gorge, Fontainebleau, and Buoux. Hill felt an immediate affinity for French culture and climbing. She particularly enjoyed climbing on the limestone common in France because it has many pockets and edges, producing &quot;wildly acrobatic climbs&quot; with low risk. Moreover, these types of climbs are ideal for people of small stature, like Hill. She tried sport climbing in France for the first time that year. Inspired and intrigued by European climbing culture, she returned later and took part in Arco e Bardonecchia Sportroccia &#x27;86, the second edition of the first international sport climbing competition, which later became the Rock Master annual event. The event was divided into two stages, one in Arco and one in Bardonecchia, Italy. She competed against other women on extremely difficult routes, gaining points for style and speed. She lost to Catherine Destivelle in a &quot;disputed ruling&quot; but won in the following year. Destivelle in her autobiography, reckons she won that year because she planned to climb fast from the beginning, as speed was decisive in case of equality, which she doubts Hill was aware of when starting the competition. In an interview, Hill has said that this first competition was &quot;disorienting&quot; because she did not understand the language, the &quot;format&quot; or the &quot;judging&quot; nor did the organizers of the competition. &quot;There were a lot of politics involved, a lot of nationalism and disorganization. The rules seemed to change during the event. I remember asking about the disparity between prize money for men and women. The only response I got was, &#x27;If the women climb without their tops, then we&#x27;ll pay them the same.&#x27;&quot; However, she continued with competition climbing because she found it stimulating to climb with &quot;other strong women&quot;. In one interview, Hill said that &quot;if there wasn&#x27;t a Catherine Destivelle or Luisa Iovane ... or whoever there, then it would be anticlimactic.&quot; Destivelle became Hill&#x27;s main competition in the late 1980s while Isabelle Patissier emerged to challenge her in the early 1990s.

She became a professional climber in 1988 and the subsequent interviews, photoshoots and media appearances led to her becoming a spokesperson for climbing. As Hill explained, competition climbing is &quot;such a different activity than going out and climbing on rock ... You&#x27;re in front of all these people ... You&#x27;re there to &quot;perform&quot;.&quot; From the beginning of her sport climbing career, Hill was aware that the sport was evolving and growing. For example, she pointed out in an interview that some competition organizers would chop down trees and alter rocks just for the sake of a competition; she could foresee that competitions would all eventually take place on artificial walls for environmental reasons.

Throughout the early 1980s, Hill had remained a traditionalist, but after her 1986 trip to Europe, she started adopting many sport climbing techniques. For instance, she had resisted hang-dogging (hanging on the rope at any point during the climb), holding with the philosophy that it was cheating, but after experimenting with it during her ascent of &quot;Vandals&quot;, she found it a useful way to learn challenging climbs. During the mid-1980s, there was great tension in the climbing community between traditionalists and new sport climbers. There was even a &quot;Great Debate&quot; in 1986 at the American Alpine Club at which a panel of all-star participants—including Hill—were invited to discuss the merits of the two different styles, especially sport climbing that required the insertion of fixed bolts into the rock. Hill has argued that &quot;the purpose of climbing is to adapt yourself to the rock. You work on yourself to overcome the obstacle of the rock ... I believe climbers should leave the rock as unaltered as possible ... you have a responsibility not only to put in safe bolts but to put them in logical places—to do the least possible alteration of the rock to establish the best possible experience for others&quot;.
From 1986 to 1992 Hill was one of the world&#x27;s top sport climbers, winning over thirty international titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1990, at the final stage of the World Cup Final, she was one of three competitors and the only woman to reach the top of the wall—and the only climber to complete the hardest move. As Joseph Taylor writes in his history of climbers of Yosemite, &quot;at that moment Lynn Hill was arguably the best climber in the world, male or female&quot;. Hill describes this as her most satisfying win because her competition—Isabelle Patissier—received information on how to do the final climb from the men who had already finished it. Moreover, Hill was starting with zero points in the competition because she had made a mistake in the previous competition, so she had to win big or not at all (the World Cup consisted of a series of competitions in which the participants were given points for a variety of climbing techniques). &quot;It took all of my effort and concentration to pull through the route. The moves I had to make were really spectacular, but I managed to do them. I was so excited to get to the top ... I proved a point about women and what we&#x27;re capable of—a lot of the best men had fallen off that route.&quot; As a professional climber, Hill was able during this time to support herself by doing what she loved; she made approximately half of her income from climbing competitions and half from sponsorships.

In January 1990, Hill set another landmark by becoming the first woman to redpoint a 5.14 (that is, she practiced free climbing the route before she was able to successfully climb it), &quot;Masse Critique&quot; in Cimaï, France. J.B. Tribout, who first ascended the route, challenged Hill, saying no woman would ever be able to climb it—Hill completed it in fewer tries than Tribout, after &quot;nine days of exhausting effort&quot;. In 1992, it was described as the hardest rock climb ever made by a woman.

Hill has experienced only one major accident in her climbing career. On May 9, 1989, she fell during a climb in Buoux, France; after being distracted when starting to tie a safety rope (with her intended bowline), she fell 72 ft (22 m) into a tree, and was knocked unconscious, dislocated her left elbow and broke a bone in her foot. She had been training hard for the World Cup and had to stop competing for a few months to recover; she was devastated to miss the first World Cup in the sport. However, only six weeks after her fall, she was back climbing.

===&quot;The Nose&quot;===
Hill did not regard sport climbing to be real climbing and felt out of place on the professional indoor climbing World Cup circuit, so she left in 1992 and went back to traditional rock climbing. As she explained in an interview, &quot;the thing I didn&#x27;t like too much towards the end was how focused it was on just indoor climbing and training. I didn&#x27;t start out training on artificial walls, and that&#x27;s not really ever something that I wanted to do as a full-time profession&quot;. In her autobiography, she also comments on the &quot;bad sportsmanship, rule bending, and monumental egos that infested the competitions&quot;. She looked for different challenges and set herself the task of free climbing (that is, using climbing aids only to protect her from falls) &quot;The Nose&quot;, a famous route on El Capitan in Yosemite Valley.

Asked why she was motivated to climb &quot;The Nose&quot;, Hill has said:
Hill first attempted to free climb &quot;The Nose&quot; in 1989 with Simon Nadin, a British climber she had met at the World Cup that year. Although he had never climbed big walls, she felt at ease around him and both had a background in traditional climbing; they both shared a desire to free climb &quot;The Nose&quot; and agreed within hours of meeting to try the feat together. Their attempt to free climb &quot;The Nose&quot; failed. Four years later, in 1993, together with her partner Brooke Sandahl, she became the first person to ever free climb the route. Hill&#x27;s original climbing grade for the &quot;Free Nose&quot; was 5.13b. One of the most difficult pitches—&quot;Changing Corners&quot;—she rated at a 5.13b/c, but she wrote in her autobiography that &quot;rating the difficulty of such a pitch is almost impossible&quot; and &quot;the most accurate grade would be to call it &#x27;once, or maybe twice, in a lifetime&#x27;&quot;. The rock face is nearly blank and there are next to no holds; to ascend the section, Hill had to use a &quot;carefully coordinated sequence of opposite pressures between [her] feet, hands, elbows, and hips against the shallow walls of the corner&quot; as well as turn her body completely around.

The next year, in 1994 she surpassed this achievement, by becoming the first person to free climb the entire route in a single 24-hour period. Usually the climb takes four to six days (Hill had previously done it in four) and most climbers are aid climbing; that is, most climbers allow themselves to use mechanical aids to assist their climbing rather than just their own skill and bodies.

Hill wanted to join her effort with that of making a film that &quot;would convey the history and spirit of climbing&quot;. Hill started endurance training in the spring for her summer ascent of &quot;The Nose&quot;, aiming to be able to on-sight a 5.13b after climbing all day. She trained in Provence and tested herself against &quot;Mingus&quot; in the Verdon Gorge, making the first on-sight free ascent of the route without a fall while simultaneously being the first woman to on-sight a 5.13b.

In her autobiography, Hill explains how she had &quot;underestimated&quot; how complicated climbing &quot;The Nose&quot; in a day would be with a film crew. Endless complications arose, such as the American coproducer backing out at the last minute, the soundman and cameraman refusing to rappel down the summit because they were afraid, and minor technical problems such as dead batteries. Hill herself had to coordinate many of the logistics because the producer had abandoned the project. Her first attempt to free climb &quot;The Nose&quot; in a day was plagued with problems. She ran out of chalk after 22 pitches, very nearly ran out of water and was taxed by the intense heat. She tried again soon after. On September 19 at 10 pm, she and her partner Steve Sutton, began the ascent again, this time without a film crew. After 23 hours, she had free climbed the entire route. In his book on the changing culture of Yosemite climbers, Joseph Taylor explains that Hill&#x27;s ascent of &quot;The Nose&quot; demonstrates how climbing in the Yosemite Valley had altered from its origins in 1960s counterculture to become a &quot;consumable experience&quot;. Hill staged what he describes as a &quot;spectacle&quot;, filming the event &quot;to capture the spontaneity of her one-day ascent&quot;, but she was only successful when not surrounded by a film crew.

The &quot;Free Nose&quot; and the &quot;Free Nose in a day&quot; remained unrepeated over 10 years after Hill&#x27;s first ascents—despite numerous attempts by some of the best big wall climbers in the world. Over time, a consensus grade of 5.14a/b has emerged for the most difficult pitch, known as pitch 27 or &quot;Changing Corners&quot;, a fact which cements her Free Nose ascents as two of the most impressive achievements in climbing history. At the time, climbing legend Yvon Chouinard called it &quot;the biggest thing that has ever been done on rock&quot; and Alexander Huber later wrote that this climb &quot;passed men&#x27;s dominance in climbing and left them behind&quot;. He also regarded her statement upon completing the climb of &quot;It goes, boys!&quot; as reasonable although other climbers regarded it as provocative.
&quot;The Nose&quot; saw a second free ascent in 1998, when Scott Burke summitted after 261 days of effort. Then, on October 14, 2005, the team of Tommy Caldwell and Beth Rodden also free climbed &quot;The Nose&quot;, and on October 16, 2005, Caldwell did it in less than 12 hours.

===World traveler===

In 1995, Hill joined The North Face climbing team and was paid to travel around the world to climb. She first visited Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s Karavshin Valley to climb with Alex Lowe, Kitty Calhoun, Jay Smith, Conrad Anker, Greg Child, Dan Osman, and Chris Noble. They camped for a month and were cut off from the world, without even a radio. In her autobiography, Hill writes that &quot;such isolation made me feel vulnerable&quot;. Hill was not used to mountain climbing (as opposed to rock climbing) and the unpredictability of it unnerved her, with its increased risk of storms and rock slides. Furthermore, she liked focusing on the style of ascending rather than just summitting; she realized on this trip that her style of free climbing was not conducive to summitting or mountain climbing. Rather than pursue ever higher climbs, therefore, she chose to climb in new places, such as Morocco, Vietnam, Thailand, Scotland, Japan, Madagascar, Australia, and South America; many of these climbs were filmed and helped promote climbing in general.

Hill started offering climbing camps in five locations in the United States in 2005, with plans for more. For US$2,000, participants received five days of an &quot;immersive adventure camp&quot;, including one-on-one coaching from Hill and other famous climbers. As of 2012 Hill was living in Boulder, Colorado, and still travelling widely. From Boulder she runs a small business offering climbing courses and also works as a technical adviser for various climbing gear companies. As of 2013, Hill was a sponsored athlete for the Patagonia gear and clothing company. While Hill used to easily obtain sponsorships, in 2010 she said in an interview that she was &quot;too old&quot; to obtain shoe sponsorships.

===Gender politics===
Hill repeatedly tells a story from when she was 14 years old and bouldering in Joshua Tree: she succeeded on a route when a man came over and commented how surprised he was that she could do the route because even he could not. &quot;I thought, well, why would you expect that you automatically could do it? Just because I was a small girl, was I not to be able to do it? It was a memorable experience because it occurred to me then that other people had a different view of what I should or shouldn&#x27;t be capable of doing. I think that people should just do whatever they can do or want to do. It shouldn&#x27;t be a matter of if they&#x27;re a man or a woman. It shouldn&#x27;t be a matter of one&#x27;s sex.&quot;

Long an advocate for gender equality in climbing, Hill has argued that men and women can climb the same routes: &quot;I think they should have women compete on the same climbs as the men, and if the women can&#x27;t do the climbs, then they shouldn&#x27;t be competing&quot;. For example, she argued that both sexes compete on the same routes in World Cup competitions. However, Hill later revised her view, noting that while she could and did compete with men &quot;spectators want to see people get to the top. And since most women aren&#x27;t climbing at the same level as the top men, it&#x27;s necessary to design a route that&#x27;s a little easier for women&quot;. In answer to a question about whether or not women &quot;will ever equal or surpass men in climbing&quot;, Hill gave a detailed response, focused on body composition, size, and psychology, explaining that climbing &quot;favors people with high strength-to-weight ratios[s]&quot;, less body fat, and greater height, articulating that such characteristics often favor men but that women &quot;have the advantage of being relatively light, with the capacity for tremendous endurance&quot;. She explained that &quot;theoretically somebody as short as me could be the best in the world because it doesn&#x27;t depend so much on height now ... And it&#x27;s a psychological thing more than a physical thing.&quot;

Hill experienced discrimination throughout her climbing career and in an interview with John Stieger in &quot;Climbing&quot;, she pointed out that despite her success and prowess at climbing, this was a problem for her. She pointed to sexist remarks from male climbers who believed particular routes were impossible for female climbers and the fact that &quot;there&#x27;s a lot less importance and prestige placed on women in climbing, no matter what your ability is&quot;. Hill has also commented extensively about how American culture encourages women to be passive and to forego developing muscles, which makes it harder for them to excel at climbing. She lamented this trend and was happy that her family and friends had allowed her to be the &quot;tomboy&quot; she wanted to be. Hill has explained that when competing she is not competing against men or women but with people&#x27;s expectations of what women can do.

Hill has been credited with bringing many women into rock climbing. The 1980s saw a large influx of women into the sport, in part because more women were visible in it and in part because Title IX funding mandated equal access for boys and girls to athletic programs in public schools. In answer to a question about her position as a role model for women climbers, Hill responded that she felt &quot;responsible to communicate something that touches people, that inspires them, that gives them a sense of passion&quot;. Climber John Long explains that Hill &quot;was a prodigy and everyone knew as much ... Twenty years ago, no female had ever climbed remotely as well as the best guys, so when Lynn began dusting us off—which she did with maddening frequency—folks offered up all kinds of fatuous explanations. Some diehards refused to believe a woman, and a five-foot article at that, could possibly be so good. Out at Josh, it was said Lynn shone owing to quartz monzonite&#x27;s superior friction, which catered to her bantam weight. In Yosemite, her success apparently hinged on midget hands, which fit wonderfully into the infernal thin cracks. On limestone, she could plug three fingers into pockets where the rest of us managed two. In the desert Southwest, she enjoyed an alliance with coyotes—or maybe shape-shifters. Even after a heap of World Cup victories, it still took the climbing world an age to accept Lynn as the Chosen One, and perhaps her legacy was never established, once and for all, till she free climbed the Nose.&quot;

==Media==

Hill has participated in various television productions, such as &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot;, which she won four seasons in a row, from 1980 to 1984; she beat Olympic athletes at rope climbing and cross-country running. It was rock climbing legend and personal hero Beverly Johnson who first asked Hill to compete. The inaugural year of the competition, the first prize for the men in the competition was US$15,000 and for the women, US$5,000. Angered, Hill asked for parity, arguing that since the women were competing in four events and the men six, the women should at least be awarded $10,000. She proposed a boycott to the other female competitors, negotiating a deal with the producer that the prize money would be raised the next year and she could compete again. In her autobiography, Hill writes that she heard a rumor that NBC canceled the women&#x27;s half of the show because the producers could not find anyone to beat her. She &quot;became increasingly aware of how few women were pushing the limits of climbing and endurance like I was, and of how my passion had led me very much into a man&#x27;s world&quot;. During the early 1980s Hill also appeared on &quot;The Guinness Game&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible!&quot;, and &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe it or Not&quot;. She describes her feat of climbing over a hot-air balloon at 6,000 feet for &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible!&quot; as &quot;perhaps the most ridiculous stunt I ever did&quot;. Despite the earlier television appearances Hill attributes her fame to a 1982 poster for the company Patagonia that showed a photograph of her climbing.

In 1999, Hill appeared in &quot;Extreme&quot;, an IMAX film on adventure sports. For that production, she and Nancy Feagin had been filmed the previous May crack climbing in Indian Creek Valley in Utah. She also appeared in &quot;Vertical Frontier&quot;, a documentary about competitive climbing in California&#x27;s Yosemite Valley.

In 2002, Hill collaboratively wrote an autobiography, &quot;Climbing Free: My Life in the Vertical World&quot;, with mountaineer and writer Greg Child, published by W.W. Norton &amp; Company. As she describes the process, &quot;He would take my writings and organize them, and he encouraged me to elaborate on certain elements. He emphasized that telling the story is what&#x27;s important, so he really helped me think about what I wanted to say, and figure out who my audience was.&quot; Hill explained in an interview that writing about past events was easier because she had had time to reflect on them. She wanted to &quot;convey the history and culture of free climbing&quot;, specifically how it became as specialized as it is today. She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer, both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman: &quot;And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently. I think the book is important from that stand point [&quot;sic&quot;], because I am a woman, and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing, or the history of climbing, out there.&quot; Writing about climbing in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was dominated by men. As accomplished American climber and writer Rachel de Silva explains, the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the first women-centric climbing books appeared.

==Personal life==
Hill met fellow Gunks climber Russ Raffa on her first trip to New York and by 1984 he had become &quot;her constant companion&quot;. On October 22, 1988, the two married At the same time, Hill moved to Grambois, France, to pursue her climbing career; she settled there because of the world-class climbing areas in the Lubéron region and the many friends she had there. While living and climbing in Europe, Hill became fluent in both French and Italian.

Hill met her partner as of 2004, chef Brad Lynch, on a climbing trip in Moab, Utah, and at the age of 42, she gave birth to a son. Hill has spoken frequently about how having a child lessened the amount of time she had for climbing but not her love for it. As she said in one interview, &quot;I feel that right now, it doesn&#x27;t have to be all about me and my experiences. I was ready to begin a new role; to face new challenges and adventures as a mother. It&#x27;s a good learning experience adjusting to the sacrifices that need to be made.&quot;

In 2015 she was inducted into the Boulder (Colorado) Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>Gerhard Berger (; born 27 August 1959) is an Austrian former racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to . Berger won 10 Formula One Grands Prix across 14 seasons.

Berger competed in Formula One for 14 seasons, twice finishing third overall in the championship in and with Ferrari. With 210 starts, Berger is amongst the most experienced Formula One drivers of all time. His first and last victories were also the first and last victories for the Benetton team, with eleven years separating them. He was also a race winner with Ferrari and with McLaren. When at McLaren, Berger drove alongside Ayrton Senna, contributing to the team&#x27;s and constructors&#x27; titles. Berger retired in with 10 wins, 12 pole positions, 21 fastest laps and 48 podiums in Formula One. 

Berger returned to Formula One in as the co-owner of Toro Rosso, before selling his 50% share back to Red Bull at the end of the season.

==Career==

===Early years===

Gerhard Berger was born in Wörgl, Austria. His father Johann worked in his own truck company with Gerhard later working for his father and before being promoted to a driver. Berger, a multiple race winner in European Formula Three, moved up to Formula One in driving for the ATS team.

Berger was fortunate to be alive after a serious road accident shortly after entering Formula One. A week after the 1984 season ended, he was driving home in his BMW 323i through the hills above Salzburg when his car was rammed from behind, resulting in it cartwheeling off a cliff. Berger, at that time not wearing the seatbelt, was thrown clear of the BMW through the rear window. By chance, the first car on the crash scene was occupied by two surgeons who specialised in back injuries. The doctors realised the extent of his injuries (a broken neck and some damaged bones in his back) and made sure he was not moved until special equipment arrived. Following emergency surgery, and a stay in hospital in Innsbruck, he made a full recovery.

A full season for Arrows followed in , though both Berger and teammate Thierry Boutsen were hampered by the Arrows A8 which was not the best chassis on the grid and did not allow either to exploit the immense power of the BMW M12 engine. Although he had some good drives (including running 6th in France), Berger would finish the season in 20th place having scored 3 points in the last two races of the year in South Africa and Australia.

It was not until joining Benetton in that his F1 career took off. Finally in a car that allowed him to exploit both his talent and the exceptional power of the BMW turbo engine ( in qualifying in 1986), coupled with a clever Pirelli tyre strategy, Berger won his first Grand Prix in Mexico using the Benetton B186. Berger was also on course for an easy victory at his home race, the 1986 Austrian Grand Prix before being forced into the pits from a comfortable lead with a flat battery. Berger out-qualified teammate Teo Fabi 12–4 in 1986 though Fabi, who as a Rookie had qualified on the pole for the 1983 Indianapolis 500, took pole at the faster Österreichring and Monza circuits. Berger established himself as a very fast driver in Formula One that year, recording the fastest speed trap of the season, clocking an incredible 351.22 km/h (218.23 mph) at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. This remains the fastest straight line speed attained by a turbocharged car in the first turbo era.

Berger was also successful in Group A touring cars during this time, racing for the German Schnitzer BMW team, driving the BMW 635 Csi in the European Touring Car Championship. He won the 1985 Spa 24 Hours partnering Italian touring car ace Roberto Ravaglia and fellow Formula One driver, Marc Surer of Switzerland.

Until the mid-1980s when teams began stopping their drivers competing in other categories of racing (primarily due to the risk involved), it was not uncommon for a Grand Prix driver to race in sports and touring cars. However, by 1985 Formula One drivers were not permitted race in any other category within 24 hours of the start of a Grand Prix. At the season ending 1985 Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide, Berger had to obtain permission from the FIA, FOCA, and from Arrows team to race in a Group A touring car race which was a support category for the weekend. He needed the permission as the Grand Prix was scheduled to start at 2 pm on Sunday, 3 November and the Group A race was to start at 3 pm on the Saturday. Driving an ex-Schnitzer BMW 635 CSi (that had finished 2nd behind his own at the Spa 24 Hours) for Australian racing legend and millionaire Bob Jane, Berger qualified 2nd on the grid but his race lasted just 3 laps before he was punted into the gravel trap at the end of the pit straight by the Holden Commodore V8 of local veteran John Harvey.

===Ferrari===
For the 1987 season, Berger signed for Ferrari, partnering the Italian Michele Alboreto and replacing Stefan Johansson. After mechanical failures robbed him of the chance to perform, Berger came on strongly in the latter half of 1987, winning the final two rounds of the season. The 1987 Ferrari F1/87 benefitted from the work of ex-McLaren designer John Barnard although the car was designed by Austrian Gustav Brunner. Ferrari were back competing for race honours for the first time since mid-1985 from the Hungarian Grand Prix onwards. Berger was running a close second to Nigel Mansell at the Hungaroring before he was forced to retire. At Estoril for the Portuguese Grand Prix Berger dominated the race from pole position before spinning in the latter stages to finish second after pressure from Alain Prost. The Austrian then looked to be heading for a second consecutive victory at the Hermanos Rodriguez circuit for the Mexican Grand Prix as he once again dominated the race but mechanical problems forced him to retire when leading. Success at both Suzuka and Adelaide for the Japanese and the Australian Grands Prix, including pole positions in both events and the fastest lap in Adelaide, ensured Ferrari and Berger went into the winter season with boosted confidence and both team and driver were tipped as favourites for the 1988 Championship. As he had done to Fabi in 1986, Berger out-qualified teammate Alboreto 12–4 in 1987. Berger&#x27;s wins also gave Ferrari its first back to back victories since the late Gilles Villeneuve won the Monaco and Spanish Grands Prix in .

In , the McLaren team, with twice World Champion Alain Prost and the sensationally fast Ayrton Senna dominated the season, winning 15 of the 16 rounds. The Honda V6 turbo engine in the McLaren MP4/4, and Lotus&#x27;s 100T had superior fuel efficiency to the Ferrari, which caused both Berger and Alboreto to often drive much slower than possible in races. Berger was the only driver to break the McLaren stranglehold in 1988, winning the Italian Grand Prix after Senna tangled with Jean-Louis Schlesser, who had temporarily replaced Nigel Mansell (who was sick with chicken pox) in the Williams-Judd. Alboreto made it a Ferrari 1–2, finishing only half a second behind the Austrian. This was a particularly poignant victory for the team, as it came just weeks after the death of Enzo Ferrari. Berger was also the only non-McLaren to take pole in 1988 when he sat on pole for the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. It was also the only race where both Ferrari cars were on the front row, with Alboreto qualifying only 0.199 behind his teammate.

The Ferrari F1/87/88C proved troublesome for both Berger and teammate Alboreto especially in terms of fuel consumption from the 1.5 litre turbo engine (Ferrari, unlike the Japanese, had not built a new engine for the season to cope with the lower fuel limit of 150 litres and the lower 2.5 Bar turbo limit, instead fronting with an updated version of their 1987 engine). At the very wet British Grand Prix for instance, Berger led the opening laps from Senna having already attained pole position, consequently building a large cushion over the rest of the field before having to slow just to finish (at the halfway mark he was in 2nd place, 50 seconds in front of 3rd placed Nigel Mansell). Ultimately he finished in 9th position, having fallen from 5th after running out of fuel coming out of the Woodcote chicane on the last lap, with Alboreto already having run out of fuel 3 laps from the finish. In the space of 200 metres Berger was passed by Nelson Piquet (Lotus), Derek Warwick and Eddie Cheever (Arrows) and Riccardo Patrese (Williams). Both Ferrari drivers were often forced to use the lowest turbo boost setting they had (approximately 2.0 bar) and reduce their engine&#x27;s revs in order to get the cars to the finish of a race. Until changes were made to the Ferrari&#x27;s V6 engine late in the season, this meant that Berger and Alboreto were often vulnerable to attack from the leading atmospheric cars, with Berger estimating that he could often only use of the car&#x27;s available during a race if he wanted to finish.

Berger was leading the final race of the season at Adelaide ahead of Prost and Senna before he clashed with former Ferrari driver René Arnoux in the Ligier while trying to lap the Frenchman. Before the race Berger, apparently with the full support of the team, told the McLaren drivers who qualified 1–2 in front of him that he was going to go all out and run as fast as he could without worrying about running out of fuel to give a good show for the fans. He did just that and after passing Senna for 2nd on lap 3, he set numerous fastest laps before finally catching and passing Prost on lap 14. From there he put some 5 seconds between himself and Prost before being taken out by Arnoux on lap 28. Berger out-qualified Alboreto in all 16 events for the 1988 Formula One calendar and in the eight races where they were both classified as finishers, finished behind Alboreto only once in France, spelling the end for the Italian after five seasons with the Maranello outfit.

For 1989, Berger was joined at Ferrari by Nigel Mansell. The Ferrari 640 with its V12 engine was fast but fragile, thanks in part to its revolutionary semi-automatic gearbox designed by John Barnard. At the Brazilian Grand Prix, Berger tangled with Senna at the first corner as the Brazilian found himself trapped between Riccardo Patrese&#x27;s Williams-Renault to the left and Berger&#x27;s Ferrari to the right, with the three drivers dicing for the lead. Berger was lucky to escape alive from a crash during the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola&#x27;s Tamburello corner, where he went straight on into the wall at almost . The car spun multiple times along the wall before catching fire. It took 16 seconds for a rescue crew to reach the Ferrari and put the fire out. Suffering remarkably few injuries, notably burns to his hands and some broken ribs, Berger was able to make it back to the cockpit at the Mexican Grand Prix after missing just the Monaco Grand Prix. Berger attributed this to Ferrari&#x27;s unique semi-automatic paddle-shift gearbox, saying that his return would have been delayed if Ferrari still used the traditional gear stick transmission used in all other F1 cars in 1989.

With the exception of the Australian Grand Prix where both Ferrari drivers had poor qualifying sessions, Berger featured in the top four in qualifying and races in all of the remaining Grands Prix but poor reliability and accidents meant that he only finished three races all year (by mid-season the problem with the semi-automatic transmission was found to be not enough power from the battery which was fixed with the help of team sponsor, electrical experts Magneti Marelli). His first points of the year didn&#x27;t come until he finished in second place in Round 12 at the Italian Grand Prix. He won the next race in Portugal which was overshadowed by the accident involving Mansell and Senna, and then finished second at the next race in Spain. These races were in fact his only points scored for the year but was still enough to give him 7th in the championship after being 3rd in 1988. The improvement in form from Ferrari came too late though. At the British Grand Prix it was announced that Alain Prost would leave McLaren at the end of the season to join the Scuderia while Berger decided to sign for McLaren who, with their Honda V10 engines, was at the time the best and fastest team in Grand Prix racing.

===McLaren===
From 1990 to 1992 Berger joined Ayrton Senna at McLaren. His arrival was met with great anticipation as he had proven great form for Benetton and Ferrari. A McLaren-Honda seemed to offer Berger a genuine chance at the world championship for the first time. However, although generally quicker than his predecessor Alain Prost in relation to Senna in qualifying (he often qualified 2nd behind Senna), he was rarely able to match the Brazilian&#x27;s pace during races. He took three wins in these three seasons, gifted the 1991 Japanese Grand Prix by Senna; as well as victories in Canada and Australia in 1992. During his three years at McLaren, Berger also obtained four pole positions and out-qualified Senna 8 times.

His debut at McLaren ruffled feathers, as he outqualified Senna for the 1990 United States Grand Prix obtaining pole position. Initially, Berger complained of a lack of space in the McLaren MP4/5B for the 1990 season, which had been designed in 1988/89 for the shorter Senna and Prost. At the 1990 Canadian Grand Prix Berger finished first, around 45 seconds ahead of the eventual winner Senna, but was penalized by one minute for creeping at the start before the green lights. Berger also started from pole position at the 1990 Mexican Grand Prix. In 1990 Berger failed to win a race for his new team, while teammate Senna won the Drivers&#x27; Championship for the second time.

Towards the end of 1991, Berger found his form in the McLaren MP4/6 – a car he was able to fit in better than the MP4/5B, out-qualifying teammate Senna at the Portuguese, Spanish and the title deciding Japanese Grands Prix (claiming pole position in the latter two events).

In 1992, Berger won the 1992 Canadian Grand Prix having overtaken Riccardo Patrese&#x27;s Williams and attacking teammate Senna before the Brazilian retired. During the 1992 Portuguese Grand Prix, Berger was involved in an incident with the Williams of Patrese. Patrese did not realize that Berger was heading towards the pitlane touched the McLaren&#x27;s rear wheel and went airborne, narrowly missing a bridge, before coming to a halt in front of the armco of the pitlane. Berger then went on to win the Australian Grand Prix for the second time after a battle with Patrese. Berger therefore won his last race for McLaren and McLaren&#x27;s last race with Honda engines. A lucrative offer from Ferrari proved too tempting for Berger who announced before the 1992 Belgian Grand Prix that he would be returning to the struggling Italian outfit.

===Return to Ferrari===
Berger was persuaded by Ayrton Senna (who told him that Honda would leave Formula One at the end of the 1992 season, leaving McLaren without a works engine for the 1993 season) and also by his countryman Niki Lauda to return to the Italian team in 1993 as Lauda felt Berger brought valuable experience with him from his partnership with Senna. The active ride suspension made the car unpredictable to drive and the Ferrari F93A failed to record a single victory and spent the majority of the season competing for the lower points. Berger&#x27;s best result was third position at the 1993 Hungarian Grand Prix. Berger had a number of spectacular incidents during the season including a clash with Michael Andretti at the start of the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix and a dramatic impact with the armco at the 1993 Portuguese Grand Prix having just exited the pits. The 1993 Monaco Grand Prix was perhaps where Berger displayed his fighting qualities best of all, obtaining second fastest lap before he attempted an opportunistic move on Damon Hill&#x27;s Williams at Loews hairpin while challenging for second position. The Austrian was forced to retire.

In 1994, Berger recovered from the deaths of close friend Senna and countryman Roland Ratzenberger at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, to score an emotional win at Hockenheim for the 1994 German Grand Prix in the Ferrari 412T, the first win for Ferrari since the 1990 Spanish Grand Prix. Berger also scored two pole positions in 1994, the first at Hockenheim and then at Estoril for the 1994 Portuguese Grand Prix where he retired from while leading. Berger was also in the lead at the final round at the 1994 Australian Grand Prix when he made a mistake, letting his former teammate Nigel Mansell pass and win for Williams.

A final season with the team in 1995 saw Berger score a number of podiums and was in a race winning position at the 1995 San Marino Grand Prix having qualified second before stalling in the pits but the fastest lap was a mere consolation. A particularly audacious pass on Damon Hill in Canada was just one example of his strong racecraft. Berger produced another aggressive drive for third having received a 10-second stop-go penalty for a jump start and then climbing up through the field from 14th position at the 1995 German Grand Prix, making a number of overtakings on the way. At Monza both Ferrari drivers were in contention for the win, when an on-board camera on Jean Alesi&#x27;s Ferrari fell into the path of Berger and smashed the Austrian&#x27;s front suspension after damaging Alesi&#x27;s car. The departure of both Alesi and Berger from Ferrari to Benetton also spelt the end of the number 27 and 28 era for Ferrari that stretched back to 1981 with Gilles Villeneuve and Didier Pironi only interrupted by the signing of 1989 world champion Alain Prost for the 1990 season.

===Final seasons with Benetton===
With the arrival of Michael Schumacher at Ferrari in 1996, Berger moved back to Benetton, although the team lost the competitiveness of the previous years. He could have remained at Maranello, but felt that the new Ferrari V10 engine would take too much time to develop. Berger spent his final two years in the sport at the team he drove for in 1986 while also sporting a revised helmet design, with the Austrian flag being rotated horizontally. 1996 proved to be a disappointing season for the Austrian, the handling characteristics of the Benetton B196 not being to his taste. Berger nearly won the German Grand Prix for the second time in his career before his Renault V10 engine blew up, handing victory to Damon Hill in the Williams. Berger&#x27;s main problem for the early part of 1996 was his driving position that prevented a smooth airflow into the airbox. Consequently, Berger was significantly slower down the straights than teammate Jean Alesi.

The Benetton B197 had a lacklustre opening to the 1997 season at Melbourne but the team and Berger bounced back at the 1997 Brazilian Grand Prix, with Berger finishing second having overtaken Mika Häkkinen and Michael Schumacher. Berger then scored Benetton&#x27;s final Grand Prix victory at the age of 37, again at Hockenheim, coming back after a 3 race layoff following a sinusitis surgery and the death of his father in a light aircraft accident. As well as the victory, Berger also claimed pole position and fastest lap during the 1997 German Grand Prix. He announced his decision to leave Benetton at the end of the season during the same weekend. He eventually retired at the end of the season, his final race seeing him finish a very close fourth in Jerez only seconds behind the victor Mika Häkkinen. In his final season as a Formula One driver, Berger and Alesi out-qualified each other 7 times each with the Austrian missing three races due to illness. Rumours of a Ferrari return for 1998 were false. Sauber offered Berger a drive for 1998 to partner Alesi, but the Austrian turned down the offer for a number of reasons, not least because of the new regulations for grooved tyres which the Austrian did not find inspiring.

==Off-track activities==
===Berger and Senna===
During the years that Berger was at McLaren (1990–1992), he became most famous for his humorous side. Popular accounts tell of many ingenious practical jokes thought up by the Austrian to break through to his serious, focused and unyielding teammate Ayrton Senna. Senna accepted the challenge and as both were spurred on by team manager Ron Dennis, the practical joking escalated. Accounts tell of an incident at Monza where Senna had been showing off his new tailor-made briefcase while riding in a helicopter with Berger. Having been made of carbon fibre composite, Senna argued that it was virtually indestructible. Berger opened the door of the helicopter and threw the briefcase out, to Senna&#x27;s disbelief. Berger asserted that he only sought to innocently test the hypothesis.

Berger later recounted further events before the 1990 Australian Grand Prix. &quot;After dinner, we started to throw people in the swimming pool, all dressed. As I was good at defending myself, I escaped from the bath, but many people got wet. Senna ran away to avoid us from getting him, however, later, I went to his room and he awkwardly threw a glass of water at me. For a Tyrolean, that was nothing, but it did mean that the game was now on. With a hose, we improvised an extension to the fire extinguisher and we put it under his room door at three in the morning. We invited some people to watch and when we pushed the lever, Senna flew out of the window like a rocket. It looked like a bomb had exploded inside the room. The confusion woke many people up, who started to scream at Senna for making so much noise. He was terribly embarrassed.&quot;

In an Australian hotel room, Berger filled Senna&#x27;s bed with frogs. An infuriated Senna confronted Berger, who replied, &quot;Did you find the snake?&quot; Senna retaliated by putting strong-smelling French cheese in the air conditioning unit of Berger&#x27;s room.

On another occasion, Senna and Brazilian compatriot Maurício Gugelmin decided to fill Berger&#x27;s shoes with shaving foam on a fast train ride to a dinner in Japan. The Austrian was forced to attend the dinner wearing a tuxedo with running shoes. A further incident followed in which Berger replaced Senna&#x27;s passport photo with what Ron Dennis described as &quot;an equivalent-sized piece of male genitalia&quot; (although other media accounts refer to a black pair of breasts, while Berger contends he snipped a woman spreading her legs in a &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine he had taken). Senna&#x27;s fame meant he rarely had his passport checked, but on a later trip to Argentina, Berger&#x27;s prank resulted in officials holding the Brazilian for 24 hours. In response to this gag, Senna superglued all of Berger&#x27;s credit cards together.

The strong connection between Senna and Berger has extended beyond the Brazilian&#x27;s death in 1994. Berger later acted as an advisor to Bruno Senna, Ayrton&#x27;s nephew, who made his Formula One debut with the HRT F1 Team in the 2010 World Championship, and subsequently switched to Williams.

===Other pranks===
Berger&#x27;s pranks continued at his new team for 1993, Scuderia Ferrari. Specifically, at the Fiorano Circuit a day before the launch of that season&#x27;s new F1 car, Berger and his then new teammate, Jean Alesi, decided to take a nearby roadcar for a spin. Unbeknownst to them, that roadcar was team director Jean Todt&#x27;s new specially made Lancia Y10. Because of the view that Alesi was driving conservatively, Berger decided to apply the handbrake causing the Lancia to flip upon their return to the pits, skidding upside down centimeters away from their yet-to-be unveiled new F1 car. Alesi was sent to the hospital. Later when Todt enquired about his roadcar, Berger conceded the two had put some &quot;slight curb marks on the roof&quot;.

==After retirement from racing==
A hugely popular figure in Formula One, Berger was up until 2003 regularly seen in the pitlane in his new capacity as Competitions Director at BMW, overseeing their successful return to Formula One in 2000.

Berger was the first to drive a F1 car on the new Shanghai Grand Prix circuit when he demonstrated a 2003 Ferrari F2003-GA.

On 25 April 2004, 10 years after Ayrton Senna&#x27;s death, Berger drove the JPS Lotus Renault 97T, which Senna had used in the 1985 championship, for three laps at Imola before the start of the 2004 San Marino Grand Prix.

In February 2006, he acquired 50% of Scuderia Toro Rosso in a deal which saw Red Bull boss Dietrich Mateschitz purchase half of Berger Logistik, a road haulage company founded by Berger&#x27;s father Johann in 1961. His Toro Rosso team won their first Grand Prix with Sebastian Vettel taking the win. He sold his share back to Mateschitz in November 2008.

In 2012 Berger was appointed President of the FIA Single Seat Commission. He left the role in December 2014.

In March 2017, Berger became chairman of ITR, the promoter of the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters.

==Helmet==

Berger&#x27;s helmet originally was blue with yellow lines and azure and white details near the visor. In 1986, during his first spell at Benetton he used a different design that complimented the livery of the Benetton BMW. In 1987 his helmet was dark grey-blue, featuring the Austrian flag on either side. For the 1995 Portuguese Grand Prix Berger sported a helmet featuring flags of multiple nations. The top was painted to resemble the Austrian flag and &quot;NO WAR IN THE WORLD&quot; at the rear. The special design was a result of a winning entrant for a one-off competition. In 1996 Berger modified his original design with the Austrian flag rotated horizontally.

<doc id="343845" wikidata="Q60533247" url="?curid=343845" title="ACH Network">
<text>In the United States, the ACH Network is the national automated clearing house (ACH) for electronic funds transfers established in the 1960s and 1970s. It is a financial utility owned by US banks, and is one of the largest payments networks in the United States, both by volume and by customer reach; virtually every bank account in the US, whether personal or commercial, is connected to the network. 

ACH has a wide variety of consumer and enterprise applications, processing financial transactions for consumers, businesses, and federal, state, and local governments. ACH processes large volumes of credit and debit transactions in batches. ACH credit transfers include direct deposit for payroll, Social Security, and other benefit payments, tax refunds, and vendor payments. ACH direct debit transfers include consumer payments on insurance premiums, mortgage loans, and other kinds of bills.

The rules and regulations that govern the ACH network are established and maintained by the nonprofit National Automated Clearinghouse Association (Nacha). 

In 2018, the network processed 23billion transactions with a total value of $51.2trillion. Contrast this with the card payment networks in the US, which in the same time period processed under $10 trillion in payments.

==History==
The ideas leading to the ACH arose in the late 1960s, evolving from the existing US paper checks system. One early predecessor was a US federal initiative used to help United States Air Force personnel get their paychecks on time. The success of this initiative led to an expansion to other employees and the government adopted it as a major payroll standard.

Separately in 1968 a group of check clearinghouse associations set up The Special Committee on Paperless Entries (SCOPE) to build an automated payment system after concerns for the number of checks being cleared for payrolls. The participants were exchanging physical checks, and using magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) technology to extract the check information for the end recipient of the check, which led to the insight that a central system could use MICR to extract check data, and then exchange that &quot;information&quot; between participants, instead of the physical checks themselves.

This led to the first ACH association, formed in California in 1972. Other regional ACH associations followed. The difficulty in compliance between different organizations led them to unite to form National Automated Clearinghouse Association (Nacha) in 1974.

As with all social networks, ACH faced a chicken-or-the-egg problem in that it was difficult to convince consumers to want to move funds via this method if banks didn&#x27;t support it, and it was difficult to convince banks to join the network if customers weren&#x27;t clamoring to use ACH. Arguably the single most important event in the history of the development of ACH was the United States Social Security Administration trialing direct deposit of Supplemental Security Income via the ACH network in 1975. This meant that joining the network enabled banks&#x27; customers to receive Social Security benefits via direct deposit instead of via paper check, which drove many US banks to quickly sign up with the network.

Nacha consolidated and added new rules which led to ACH. As computer and telecommunication technology advanced over the next few years, the system continued to develop. By 1978, electronic funds transfers were available.

From the late 1980s through to the 2000s, the system continued to develop with a number of enhancements. In 2001, there was a major reorganization of Nacha which led to financial institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation becoming direct members, making it much easier for the ACH network to be used by banks; that same year internet payments also went into effect, which would go on to be a big part of ACH payments.

Today, all US banks and credit unions are members of the network.

==Uses of the ACH payment system==

* Bank treasury management departments sell this service to business and government customers
* Business-to-business payments
* Direct debit payment of consumer bills such as mortgages, loans, utilities, insurance premiums, rents, and any other regular payment
* Direct deposit of payroll, Social Security and other government payments, and tax refunds
* E-commerce payments
* Federal, state, and local tax payments
* Non-immediate transfer of funds between accounts at different financial institutions (when a real-time transfer is required, a wire transfer using a system such as the Federal Reserve&#x27;s Fedwire is employed instead)

==Types of ACH transactions==
ACH is the only major payment system in the United States that features both &quot;push&quot; (or ACH credit) and &quot;pull&quot; (or ACH debit) transactions.

===ACH debit transaction===
The payee&#x27;s sending institution creates, batches, and transmits an ACH debit transaction to the payor&#x27;s receiving institution. The ACH debit transaction instructs the receiving institution to withdraw and transmit the funds from the payor&#x27;s bank account to the sending institution.
The receiving institution must send the return to the sending institution by the end of the following business day if it is unable to debit the funds from the payor&#x27;s account, such if the account was not found, the account was closed, or the account was frozen.
For an ACH debit transaction, the sending institution may be a third-party bank, rather than the payee&#x27;s bank.

===ACH credit transaction===
The payor&#x27;s sending institution creates, batches, and transmits an ACH credit to the payee&#x27;s receiving institution. The ACH credit transaction instructs the receiving institution to credit the funds to the payee&#x27;s bank account.
The receiving institution must send the return to the sending institution by the end of the following business day if it is unable to credit the funds to the payee&#x27;s account, such if the account was not found, the account was closed, or the account was frozen.

For an ACH credit, the sending institution may not be a third-party bank, rather than the payor&#x27;s bank.

==Payment flow==
In both ACH debit and ACH credit scenarios, the transaction is started by an originator. In the case of ACH debit, that is likely a business, &quot;pulling&quot; funds from the bank account of a customer, and in the case of ACH credit, this is likely a customer, &quot;pushing&quot; funds from their bank account to the business&#x27;s.

The originator gives their instructions to their bank, or originating depository financial institution (ODFI). The ODFI either credits or debits their customer&#x27;s account, depending on the flow, and forwards the transaction to an ACH operator.

The Federal Reserve&#x27;s FedACH and the The Clearing House Payments Company&#x27;s privately owned Electronic Payments Network (EPN) are the two ACH operators in the United States.

The operator routes the transaction to the receiving depository financial institution (RDFI). As there are just two operators in the US, if the ODFI and RDFI do not use the same ACH operator, the ODFI&#x27;s operator routes the transaction to the RDFI&#x27;s operator, who routes it to the RDFI.

The RDFI then either debits or credits (depending on the flow) the bank account of its own customer.

== Types of ACH settlements==
There are two types of ACH settlements.

=== Next-day ACH===
ACH debits and credits are transactions that are created, batched, and transmitted to an ACH operator, typically by way of a financial institution&#x27;s connection to the ACH Network.

With next-day ACH, each ACH transaction is cleared overnight. The sending institution (called the Originating Depository Financial Institution) sends the transaction to the receiving institution (called the Receiving Depository Financial Institution). When the receiving institution receives the transaction, it has until the end of the next working day to send a rejection to the sending institution. If the sending institution does not receive a return from the receiving institution by the morning of the third business day, then the transaction is deemed to be successful.

Waiting for a timeout for two business days is an antiquated feature of ACH that lingers on from the 1960s when the ACH system was designed and implemented. It is not as quick as real-time payment networks. Consequently, ACH debit or credit transactions can take four working days to complete.

=== Same-day ACH ===
With same-day ACH, settlement can happen the same day. The sending institution can transmit files to the receiving institution the same day, expediting the processing of ACH transactions. The receiving institution still has two business days in which to send a return, so there will still be a delay of two business days in same-day ACH debit transactions. On the other hand, ACH credit transactions can be credited on the same business day as long as the receiving institution receives the ACH transaction within the correct window.

Transactions exceeding $1,000,000 and international transactions are not eligible for same-day ACH.

Nacha instituted same-day ACH in four phases. As of September 15, 2017, banks were required to accept debit requests in the same three settlement windows. As of September 23, 2016, financial institutions were required to be able to process ACH credit requests to add funds to an account in all three settlement windows. As of March 16, 2018, banks were required to make funds available as fully settled completed transactions by 5:00p.m. local time for ACH credit transactions processed in the day&#x27;s first two settlement windows. As of March 20, 2020, the per-transaction limit was raised from $25,000 to $100,000. It was again raised to $1,000,000 as of March 18, 2022. 

==SEC codes==
Common Standard Entry Class (SEC) codes are as follows.

==Regulation==
The ACH network is governed by a myriad of rules and regulations mandated by various parties. Firstly, participants are bound by the rules of the National Automated Clearinghouse Association (Nacha), as well as by the direct regulatory oversight of the Federal Reserve Bank regulations such as Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Operating Circular #4. 

Several sections of the Uniform Commercial Code (notably 4 and 4a) also relate to the operation of the automated clearing house.

There also exist rules mandated by the ACH operators that financial institutions are required to follow in order to use those operators.

<text>A lawn mower (also known as a grass cutter or simply mower, also often spelled lawnmower) is a device utilizing one or more revolving blades (or a reel) to cut a grass surface to an even height. The height of the cut grass may be fixed by the mower&#x27;s design but generally is adjustable by the operator, typically by a single master lever or by a mechanism on each of the machine&#x27;s wheels. The blades may be powered by manual force, with wheels mechanically connected to the cutting blades so that the blades spin when the mower is pushed forward, or the machine may have a battery-powered or plug-in electric motor. The most common self-contained power source for lawn mowers is a small 4-stroke (typically one-cylinder) internal combustion engine. Smaller mowers often lack any form of self-propulsion, requiring human power to move over a surface; &quot;walk-behind&quot; mowers are self-propelled, requiring a human only to walk behind and guide them. Larger lawn mowers are usually either self-propelled &quot;walk-behind&quot; types or, more often, are &quot;ride-on&quot; mowers that the operator can sit on and control. A robotic lawn mower (&quot;lawn-mowing bot&quot;, &quot;mowbot&quot;, etc.) is designed to operate either entirely on its own or less commonly by an operator on a remote control.

Two main styles of blades are used in lawn mowers. Lawn mowers employing a single blade that rotates about a single vertical axis are known as rotary mowers, while those employing a cutting bar and multiple blade assembly that rotates about a single horizontal axis are known as cylinder or reel mowers (although in some versions, the cutting bar is the only blade, and the rotating assembly consists of flat metal pieces which force the blades of grass against the sharp cutting bar).

There are several types of mowers, each suited to a particular scale and purpose. The smallest types, non-powered push mowers, are suitable for small residential lawns and gardens. Electrical or piston engine-powered push-mowers are used for larger residential lawns (although there is some overlap). Riding mowers, which sometimes resemble small tractors, are larger than push mowers and are suitable for large lawns. However, commercial riding lawn mowers (such as zero-turn mowers) can be &quot;stand-on&quot; types and often bear little resemblance to residential lawn tractors, being designed to mow large areas at high speed in the shortest time possible. The largest multi-gang (multi-blade) mowers are mounted on tractors and are designed for large expanses of grass such as golf courses and municipal parks, although they are ill-suited for complex terrain.

== History ==
=== Invention ===
The lawn mower was invented in 1830 by Edwin Beard Budding of Stroud, Gloucestershire, England. Budding&#x27;s mower was designed primarily to cut the grass on sports grounds and extensive gardens, as a superior alternative to the scythe, and was granted a British patent on August 31, 1830.

Budding&#x27;s first machine was wide with a frame made of wrought iron. The mower was pushed from behind. Cast-iron gear wheels transmitted power from the rear roller to the cutting cylinder, allowing the rear roller to drive the knives on the cutting cylinder; the ratio was 16:1. Another roller placed between the cutting cylinder and the main or land roller could be raised or lowered to alter the height of cut. The grass clippings were hurled forward into a tray-like box. It was soon realized, however, that an extra handle was needed in front to help pull the machine along. Overall, these machines were remarkably similar to modern mowers.

Two of the earliest Budding machines sold went to Regent&#x27;s Park Zoological Gardens in London and the Oxford colleges. In an agreement between John Ferrabee and Edwin Budding dated May 18, 1830, Ferrabee paid the costs of enlarging the small blades, obtained letters of patent and acquired rights to manufacture, sell and license other manufacturers in the production of lawn mowers. Without patent, Budding and Ferrabee were shrewd enough to allow other companies to build copies of their mower under licence, the most successful of these being Ransomes of Ipswich, which began making mowers as early as 1832.

His machine was the catalyst for the preparation of modern-style sporting ovals, playing fields (pitches), grass courts, etc. This led to the codification of modern rules for many sports, including for football, lawn bowls, lawn tennis and others.
=== Further improvements ===

It took ten more years and further innovations to create a machine that could be drawn by animals, and sixty years before a steam-powered lawn mower was built. In the 1850s, Thomas Green &amp; Son of Leeds introduced a mower called the Silens Messor (meaning silent cutter), which used a chain drive to transmit power from the rear roller to the cutting cylinder. These machines were lighter and quieter than the gear-driven machines that preceded them, although they were slightly more expensive. The rise in popularity of lawn sports helped prompt the spread of the invention. Lawn mowers became a more efficient alternative to the scythe and domesticated grazing animals.

Manufacture of lawn mowers took off in the 1860s. By 1862, Ferrabee&#x27;s company was making eight models in various roller sizes. He manufactured over 5000 machines until production ceased in 1863. The first grass boxes were flat trays but took their present shape in the 1860s. James Sumner of Lancashire patented the first steam-powered lawn mower in 1893. His machine burned petrol and/or paraffin (kerosene) as fuel. These were heavy machines that took several hours to warm up to operating pressure. After numerous advances, these machines were sold by the Stott Fertilizer and Insecticide Company of Manchester and Sumner. The company they both controlled was called the Leyland Steam Motor Company.

Around 1900, one of the best known English machines was the Ransomes&#x27; Automaton, available in chain- or gear-driven models. Numerous manufacturers entered the field with petrol (gasoline) engine-powered mowers after the start of the 20th century. In 1902, The first was produced by Ransomes. JP Engineering of Leicester, founded after World War I, produced a range of very popular chain-driven mowers. About this time, an operator could ride behind animals that pulled the large machines. These were the first riding mowers.

The first United States patent for a reel lawn mower was granted to Amariah Hills on January 12, 1868. In 1870, Elwood McGuire of Richmond, Indiana designed a human-pushed lawn mower, which was very lightweight and a commercial success. John Burr patented an improved rotary-blade lawn mower in 1899, with the wheel placement altered for better performance. Amariah Hills went on to found the Archimedean Lawn Mower Co. in 1871.

In the United States, gasoline-powered lawn mowers were first manufactured in 1914 by Ideal Power Mower Co. of Lansing, Michigan, based on a patent by Ransom E. Olds. Ideal Power Mower also introduced the world&#x27;s first self-propelled, riding lawn tractor in 1922, known as the &quot;Triplex&quot;. The roller-drive lawn mower has changed very little since around 1930. &quot;Gang mowers&quot;, those with multiple sets of blades to cut a wider swath, were built in the United States in 1919 by the Worthington Mower Company.
== Atco Ltd and the first motor mower ==

In the 1920s one of the most successful companies to emerge during this period was Atco, at that time a brand name of Charles H Pugh Ltd. The Atco &#x27;Standard&#x27; motor mower, launched in 1921 was an immediate success. Just 900 of the 22-inch-cut machines were made in 1921, each costing £75. Within five years, annual production had accelerated to tens of thousands. Prices were reduced and a range of sizes were available, making the Standard the first truly mass-produced engine-powered mower.
=== Rotary mowers ===
Rotary mowers were not developed until engines were small enough and powerful enough to run the blades at sufficient speed. Many people experimented with rotary blade mowers in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and Power Specialties Ltd. introduced a gasoline-powered rotary mower. Kut Kwick replaced the saw blade of the &quot;Pulp Saw&quot; with a double-edged blade and a cutter deck, converting the &quot;Pulp Saw&quot; into the first ever out-front rotary mower.

One company that produced rotary mowers commercially was the Australian Victa company, starting in 1952. Its mowers were lighter and easier to use than similar ones that had come before. The first Victa mowers were made at Mortlake, an inner suburb of Sydney, by local resident Mervyn Victor Richardson. He made his first model out of scrap in his garage. The first Victa mowers were then manufactured, going on sale on 20 September 1952. The new company, Victa Mowers Pty Ltd, was incorporated on 13 February 1953.

The venture was so successful that by 1958 the company moved to much larger premises in Parramatta Road, Concord, and then to Milperra, by which time the mower incorporated an engine, designed and manufactured by Victa, which was specially designed for mowing, rather than employing a general-purpose engine bought from outside suppliers. Two Victa mowers, from 1958 and 1968 respectively, are held in the collection of the National Museum of Australia. The Victa mower is regarded as something of an Australian icon, appearing en masse, in simulated form, at the opening of the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000.

The hover mower, first introduced by Flymo in 1964, is a form of rotary mower using an air cushion on the hovercraft principle.

=== By rotation ===
==== Cylinder or reel mowers ====

A cylinder mower or reel mower carries a fixed, horizontal cutting blade at the desired height of cut. Over this is a fast-spinning reel of blades which force the grass past the cutting bar. Each blade in the blade cylinder forms a helix around the reel axis, and the set of spinning blades describes a cylinder.

Of all the mowers, a properly adjusted cylinder mower makes the cleanest cut of the grass, and this allows the grass to heal more quickly. The cut of a well-adjusted cylinder mower is straight and definite, as if cut with a pair of scissors. This clean cut promotes healthier, thicker and more resilient lawn growth that is more resistant to disease, weeds and parasites. Lawn cut with a cylinder mower is less likely to result in yellow, white or brown discolouration as a result of leaf shredding. While the cutting action is often likened to that of scissors, it is neither necessary nor desirable for the blades of the spinning cylinder to contact the horizontal cutting bar. When the reel touches the cutting bar the work required by the mower increases dramatically. When the gap between the blades is less than the thickness of the grass blades, a clean cut can still be made without additional friction. When the gap is greater than the thickness of the grass blades, grass will slip through the gap uncut. Reel mowers also have more difficulty mowing over uneven terrain.

There are many variants of the cylinder mower. Push mowers have no engine and are usually used on smaller lawn areas where access is a problem, where noise pollution is undesirable and where air pollution is unwanted. As the mower is pushed along, the wheels drive gears which rapidly spin the reel. Typical cutting widths are . Advances in materials and engineering have resulted in these mowers being very light and easy to operate and manoeuvre compared with their predecessors while still giving all the cutting advantages of professional cylinder mowers. Their distinct environmental benefits, both in noise and air pollution, are also strong selling points, something not lost on many international zoos, animal sanctuaries and exclusive hotel groups.

The basic push mower mechanism is also used in gangs towed behind a tractor. The individual mowers are arranged in a &quot;v&quot; behind the tractor with each mower&#x27;s track slightly overlapping that of the mower in front of it. Gang mowers are used over large areas of turf such as sports fields or parks.

A gasoline engine or electric motor can be added to a cylinder mower to power the cylinder, the wheels, the roller, or any combination of these. A typical arrangement on electric powered machines for residential lawns is for the motor to power the cylinder while the operator pushes the mower along. The electric models can be corded or cordless. On petrol machines the engine drives both the cylinder and the rear roller. Some variants have only three blades in a reel spinning at great speed, and these models are able to cut grass which has grown too long for ordinary push mowers. One type of reel mower, now largely obsolete, was a powered version of the traditional side-wheel push mower, which was used on residential lawns. An internal combustion engine sat atop the reel housing and drove the wheels, usually through a belt. The wheels in turn drove the reel, as in the push mower.
Greens mowers are used for the precision cutting of golf greens and have a cylinder made up of at least eight, but normally ten, blades. The machine has a roller before and after the cutting cylinder which smooths the freshly cut lawn and minimizes wheel marks. Due to the weight, the engine also propels the mower. Much smaller and lighter variants of the roller mower are sometimes used for small patches of ornamental lawns around flower beds, and these have no engine.

Riding reel mowers are also produced. Typically, the cutting reels are ahead of the vehicle&#x27;s main wheels, so that the grass can be cut before the wheels push the grass over onto the ground. The reels are often hydraulically powered.

The main parts of a cylinder or reel mower are:

* Blade reel/cylinder: Consists of numerous (3 to 7) helical blades that are attached to a rotating shaft. The blades rotate, creating a scissor-like cutting motion against the bed knife.
* Bed knife: The stationary cutting mechanism of a cylinder/reel mower. This is a fixed horizontal blade that is mounted to the frame of the mower.
* Body frame: The main structural frame of the mower onto which the other parts of the mower are mounted.
* Wheels: Help propel the mower in action. Generally, reel mowers have two wheels.
* Push handle: The &quot;power source&quot; of a manually operated reel mower. This is a sturdy T-shaped, rectangular, or trapezoidal handle that is connected to the frame, wheels and blade chamber.
* Motor: The power source of a reel mower that is powered by gasoline or electricity.
==== Rotary mowers ====
A rotary mower rotates about a vertical axis with the blade spinning at high speed relying on impact to cut the grass. This tends to result in a rougher cut and bruises and shreds the grass leaf resulting in discolouration of the leaf ends as the shredded portion dies. This is particularly prevalent if the blades become clogged or blunt. Most rotary mowers need to be set a little higher than cylinder equivalents to avoid scalping and gouging of slightly uneven lawns, although some modern rotaries are fitted with a rear roller to provide a more formal striped cut. These machines will also tend to cut lower () than a standard four-wheeled rotary.

The main parts of a rotary mower are:

* Cutter deck housing: Houses the blade and the drive system of the mower. It is shaped to effectively eject the grass clippings from the mower.
* Blade mounting and drive system: The blade of a rotary mower is usually mounted directly to the crankshaft of its engine, but it can be propelled by a hydraulic motor or a belt pulley system.
* Mower blade: A blade that rotates in a horizontal plane (about a vertical axis). Some mowers have multiple blades. The blade features edges that are slightly curved upward to generate a continuous air flow as the blade rotates (as a fan), thus creating a sucking and tearing action.
* Engine/motor: May be powered by gasoline or electricity.
* Wheels: Generally four wheels, two front and two rear. Some mowers have a roller in place of the rear wheels.
=== By energy source ===

==== Gasoline (petrol) ====
Extensive grass trimming was not common before the widespread application of the vertical shaft single cylinder gasoline/petrol engine. In the United States this development paralleled the market penetration of companies such as the Briggs &amp; Stratton company of Wisconsin.

Most rotary push mowers are powered by internal combustion engines. Such engines are usually four-stroke engines, used for their greater torque and cleaner combustion (although a number of older models used two-stroke engines), running on gasoline (petrol) or other liquid fuels. Internal combustion engines used with lawn mowers normally have only one cylinder. Power generally ranges from four to seven horsepower. The engines usually have a carburetor and require a manual pull crank to start them, although an electric starter is offered on some models, particularly large riding and commercial mowers. Some mowers have a throttle control on the handlebar with which the operator can adjust the engine speed. Other mowers have a fixed, pre-set engine speed. All are equipped with a governor (often centrifugal/mechanical or air vane style) to open the throttle as needed to maintain the pre-selected speed when the force needed to cut the thicker or taller grass is encountered. Gasoline mowers have the advantages over electric mowers of greater power and distance range. They do create a significant amount of pollution due to the combustion in the engine, and their engines require periodic maintenance such as cleaning or replacement of the spark plug and air filter, and changing the engine oil. California passed Assembly Bill 1356 an air pollution control law on October 9, 2021. The California bill barred sales of spark ignited (gasoline fueled) internal combustion engines less than 25HP used for farm or construction machines as of January 1, 2024. The California bill does not ban turf care machines larger than 25HP or those powered by compression ignition (diesel) engines. 

==== Electricity ====
Electric mowers are further subdivided into corded and cordless electric models. Both are relatively quiet, typically producing less than 75 decibels, while a gasoline lawn mower can be 95 decibels or more.

Corded electric mowers are limited in range by their trailing power cord, which may limit their use with lawns extending outward more than 100–150 feet (30–45 m) from the nearest available power outlet. There is the additional hazard with these machines of accidentally mowing over the power cable, which stops the mower and may put users at risk of receiving a dangerous electric shock. Installing a residual-current device (GFCI) on the outlet may reduce the shock risk.

Cordless electric mowers are powered by a variable number (typically 1–4) of 12-to-80-volt rechargeable batteries. Typically, more batteries mean more run time and/or power (and more weight). Batteries can be in the interior of the lawnmower or on the outside. If on the outside, the depleted batteries can be quickly swapped with recharged batteries. Cordless mowers have the maneuverability of a gasoline-powered mower and the environmental friendliness of a corded electric mower, but they are more expensive and come in fewer models (particularly the self-propelling type) than either. The eventual disposal of worn-out batteries is problematic (though some manufacturers offer to recycle them), and the motors in some cordless mowers tend to be less powerful than gasoline motors of the same total weight (including batteries).

==== Propane ====
Lawn mowers powered by propane were also manufactured by Lehr.

==== By hand ====
In hand-powered lawn mowers, the reel is attached to the mower&#x27;s wheels by gears, so that when the mower is pushed forward, the reel spins several times faster than the plastic or rubber-tired wheels turn. Depending on the placement of the reel, these mowers often cannot cut grass very close to lawn obstacles.
=== Other notable types ===
====Hover mowers====
Hover mowers are powered rotary push lawn mowers that use an impeller above the spinning blades to drive air downward, thereby creating an air cushion that lifts the mower above the ground. The operator can then easily move the mower as it floats over the grass. Hover mowers are necessarily light in order to achieve the air cushion and typically have plastic bodies with an electric motor. The most significant disadvantage, however, is the cumbersome usability in rough terrain or on the edges of lawns, as the lifting air-cushion is destroyed by wide gaps between the chassis and the ground. Hover mowers are built to operate on steep slopes, waterfronts, and high-weeded areas, so they are often used by golf course greenskeepers and commercial landscapers. Grass collection is often available, but can be poor in some models. The quality of cut can be inferior if the grass is pushed away from the blade by the cushion of air.

====Robotic mowers====
==== Tractor pulled mowers ====

Tractor pulled mowers are usually in the form of an attachment to a tractor. The attachments can simply function by the movement of the tractor similar to manual push cylinder mowers, but also sometimes may have powered moving blades. They are commonly mounted on either the side or the back of the tractor.

====Riding lawn mowers====
Riding mowers (U.S. and Canada) or ride-on mowers (U.K. and Canada) are a popular alternative for large lawns. The operator is provided with a seat and controls on the mower and literally rides on the machine. Most use the horizontal rotating blade system, though usually with multiple blades. A common form of ride-on mower is the lawn tractor. These are usually designed to resemble a small agricultural tractor, with the cutting deck mounted amidships between the front and rear axles.

The drives for these mowers are in several categories. The most common transmission for tractors is a manual transmission. The second most common transmission type is a form of continuously variable transmission, called hydrostatic transmission. These transmissions take several forms, from pumps driving separate motors, which may incorporate a gear reduction, to fully integrated units containing a pump, motor and gear reduction. Hydrostatic transmissions are more expensive than mechanical transmissions, but they are easier to use and can transmit greater torque to the wheels compared to a typical mechanical transmission. The least common drive type, and the most expensive, is electric.

There have been a number of attempts to replace hydrostatic transmissions with lower cost alternatives, but these attempts, which include variable belt types, e.g. MTD&#x27;s &quot;Auto Drive&quot;, and toroidal, have various performance or perception problems that have caused their market life to be short or their market penetration to be limited.

Riding lawn mowers can often mount other devices, such as rototillers/rotavators, snow plows, snow blowers, yard vacuums, occasionally even front buckets or fork-lift tines (these are more properly known as &quot;lawn tractors&quot; in this case, being designed for a number of tasks). The ability to tow other devices is because they have multiple gears, often up to 5 or 6 and variable top speeds. Compact utility tractors equipped with a belly mower can look similar to riding lawn mowers, but they are typically larger, equipped with diesel engines, and feature a three-point hitch and rollover protection structure; these features are generally absent on riding lawn mowers.

The deck of a rotary mower is typically made of steel. Lighter steel is used on less expensive models, and heavier steel on more expensive models for durability. Other deck materials include aluminium, which does not rust and is a staple of higher priced mowers, and hard composite plastic, which does not rust and is lighter and less expensive than aluminium. Electric mowers typically have a plastic deck.

Riding mowers typically have an opening in the side or rear of the housing where the cut grass is expelled, as do most rotary lawn mowers. Some have a grass catcher attachment at the opening to bag the grass clippings. 

====Mulching mowers====
Mulching mowers use special mulching blades which are available for rotary mowers. The blade is designed to keep the clippings circulating underneath the mower until the clippings are chopped quite small. Other designs have twin blades to mulch the clippings to small pieces. This function has the advantages of forgoing the additional work collecting and disposing of grass clippings while reducing lawn waste in such a way that also creates convenient compost for the lawn, forgoing the expense and adverse environmental effect of fertilizer.

Mower manufacturers market their mowers as side discharge, 2-in-1, meaning bagging and mulching or side discharging and mulching, and 3-in-1, meaning bagging, mulching, and side discharge. Most 2-in-1 bagging and mulching mowers require a separate attachment to discharge grass onto the lawn. Some side discharge mower manufacturers also sell separate &quot;mulching plates&quot; that will cover the opening on the side discharge mower and, in combination with the proper blades, will convert the mower to a mulching mower. These conversions are impractical when compared with 2- or 3-in-1 mowers which can be converted in the field in seconds. There are two types of bagging mowers. A rear bag mower features an opening on the back of the mower through which the grass is expelled into the bag. Hi-vac mowers have a tunnel that extends from the side discharge to the bag. Hi-vac is also the type of grass collection used on some riding lawn mowers and lawn tractors and is suitable for use in dry conditions but less suitable for long wet lush grass as they often clog up. Mulching and bagging mowers are not well suited to long grass or thick weeds. In some ride-on mowers, the cut grass is dropped onto the ground and then collected by a set of rotating bristles, allowing even long, wet grass to be collected.

Rotary mowers with internal combustion engines come in three price ranges. Low priced mowers use older technology, smaller motors, and lighter steel decks. These mowers are targeted at the residential market and typically price is the most important selling point.

====Professional mowers====
Professional grass-cutting equipment, used by large establishments such as universities, sports stadiums and local authorities, usually take the form of much larger, dedicated, ride-on platforms or attachments that can be mounted on, or behind, a standard tractor unit (a &quot;gang-mower&quot;). Either type may use rotating-blade or cylindrical-blade type cutters, although high-quality mowed surfaces demand the latter. Wide-area mowers (WAMs) are commercial grade mowers which have decks extended to either side, many to . These extensions can be lowered for large area mowing or raised to decrease the mower&#x27;s width and allow for easy transport on city roads or trailers. Commercial lawn-mowing companies have also enthusiastically adopted types such as the zero-turn mower (in both ride-on and stand-on versions), which allow high speed over the grass surface, and rapid turnaround at the end of rows, as well as excellent maneuverability around obstacles.

Mowers mounted on a tractor&#x27;s three-point hitch may be known as &quot;finish mowers&quot; used for maintaining lawn, &quot;flail mowers&quot; used for maintaining rough grass on rough surfaces, or &quot;brush mowers&quot; used for cutting brush and small trees.

== Safety issues ==
Rotary mowers can throw out debris with extreme velocity and energy. Additionally, the blades of a self-powered push mower (gasoline or electric) can injure a careless or inattentive user; consequently, many come equipped with a dead man&#x27;s switch to immediately disable the blade rotation when the user is no longer holding the handle. In the United States, over 12,000 people per year are hospitalized as a result of lawn mower accidents. In 2016, 86,000 adults and 4,500 children were admitted to the emergency room for lawnmower injuries. The vast majority of these injuries can be prevented by wearing protective footwear when mowing. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children be at least 12 years old before they are allowed to use a walk-behind lawn mower and at least 16 years of age before using a riding mower and that they &quot;should not operate lawn mowers until they have displayed the necessary levels of judgment, strength, coordination, and maturity&quot;. Persons using a mower should wear heavy footwear, eye protection, and hearing protection in the case of engine-powered mowers.

== Environmental and occupational impact ==
A 2001 study showed that some mowers produce the same amount of pollution (emissions other than carbon dioxide) in one hour as driving a 1992 model vehicle for . Another estimate puts the amount of pollution from a lawn mower at four times the amount from a car, per hour, although this report is no longer available. Beginning in 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency set standards for lawn equipment emissions and expects a reduction of at least 35 percent.

Gas powered lawn mowers produce GHG emissions. A minimum-maintained lawn management practice with clipping recycling, and minimum irrigation and mowing, is recommended to mitigate global warming effects from urban turfgrass system. 

Battery-powered lawn mowers offer cleaner alternatives to consumers by producing zero emissions, being more efficient, and eliminating risks of spilled gasoline. Gasoline-powered lawnmowers are not regulated to have emission-capturing technology. 

Mowers can create significant noise pollution, and could cause hearing loss if used without hearing protection for prolonged periods of time. Lawn mowers also present an occupational hearing hazard to the nearly one million people who work in lawn service and ground-keeping. One study assessed the occupational noise exposure among groundskeepers at several North Carolina public universities and found noise levels from push lawn mowers measured between 86 and 95 decibels (A-weighted) and from riding lawn mowers between 88 and 96 dB(A); both types exceeded the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Recommended Exposure Limit of 85 dB(A).

The risk of hearing loss and noise pollution can be reduced by using battery-operated mowers or appropriate hearing protection such as earplugs or earmuffs.

It is possible for a lawn mower to damage the underlying soil, the roots of the grass, and the mower itself if the blades cut through the grass and collide with the underlying ground. Therefore, it is important to adjust mower height properly and choose the right tires for a lawn mower to prevent any marking or digging.

<doc id="343858" wikidata="Q465695" url="?curid=343858" title="Kathie Lee Gifford">
<text>Kathryn Lee Gifford (née Epstein; born August 16, 1953) is an American television presenter, singer, songwriter, actress, and author. From 1985 to 2000, she and Regis Philbin hosted the talk show &quot;Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot;. Gifford is also known for her 11-year run with Hoda Kotb, on the fourth hour of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show (2008–2019)&quot;.&quot; She has received 11 Daytime Emmy nominations and won her first Daytime Emmy in 2010 as part of the &quot;Today&quot; team.

Gifford&#x27;s first television role was as Tom Kennedy&#x27;s singer/sidekick on the syndicated version of &quot;Name That Tune&quot; in the 1977–1978 season. She also occasionally appeared on the first three hours of &quot;Today&quot; and was a contributing NBC News correspondent.

Kathie Lee married Paul Johnson, a composer, arranger, producer and publisher of Christian music, in 1976, and they divorced in 1982. She married sportscaster and former NFL player Frank Gifford in 1986. In 2015, Frank Gifford died from complications of CTE, often caused by contact sports-related injuries. Kathie Lee has released studio music albums and several books, her music and writings feature spiritual and uplifting themes.

==Early life and beginnings==
Gifford was born Kathryn Lee Epstein in Paris, France, to American parents, Joan (born Cuttell; January 20, 1930 – September 12, 2017), a singer, and Aaron Epstein (March 19, 1924 – November 19, 2002), a musician and former US Navy Chief Petty Officer. Aaron Epstein was stationed with his family in France at the time of Gifford&#x27;s birth. Gifford grew up in Bowie, Maryland, and attended Bowie High School.

Gifford&#x27;s paternal grandfather was a Russian Jew from Saint Petersburg and her paternal grandmother had Native American ancestry. Her mother, a relative of writer Rudyard Kipling, was of French Canadian, German and English descent.

After seeing the Billy Graham-produced film &quot;The Restless Ones&quot; at age 12, Gifford became a born-again Christian. She told interviewer Larry King, &quot;I was raised with many Jewish traditions and raised to be very grateful for my Jewish heritage.&quot;

During high school, Gifford was a singer in a folk group, &quot;Pennsylvania Next Right&quot;, which performed frequently at school assemblies. After high school graduation in 1971, Gifford attended Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, studying drama and music. During a summer in the early 1970s, she was a live-in secretary/babysitter for Anita Bryant at her home in Miami. Her first regular appearances on national TV were as a singer on the game show &quot;Name That Tune&quot;, hosted by Tom Kennedy in the late 1970s, in which she would sing small portions of songs that contestants would have to identify.

==Career==

===Early career===

Gifford&#x27;s career took off in 1978 when she joined the cast of the short-lived &quot;Hee Haw&quot; spinoff, &quot;Hee Haw Honeys&quot;. She was also a correspondent and substitute anchor on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; in the early 1980s.

===&quot;Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot;===
On June 24, 1985, Gifford replaced Ann Abernathy as co-host of &quot;The Morning Show&quot; on WABC-TV with Regis Philbin. The program went into national broadcast in 1988 as &quot;Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot;, and Gifford became well known across the country. Throughout the 1990s, morning-TV viewers watched her descriptions of life at home with her sportscaster husband Frank, son Cody, and daughter Cassidy.

In 1990, when TV Guide held a poll for readers to select the most beautiful woman on television, &quot;Live!&quot; presented a week-long mock campaign to garner votes for Gifford. Gifford wound up winning the poll, receiving more than four times as many votes as the runners-up, Jaclyn Smith and Nicollette Sheridan.

Philbin and Gifford were jointly nominated eight years in a row (1993 to 2000) for Outstanding Talk Show Host during the Daytime Emmy Awards. Gifford decided to leave the show in 2000. She explained that filling in for Carol Burnett on Broadway and guest-hosting &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; had inspired her to pursue more challenging work. The day after she hosted &quot;Late Show&quot; on February 24, 2000, she told Regis she had decided to leave &quot;Live!&quot;. Her last episode aired on July 28, 2000.

===&quot;Today with Kathie Lee and Hoda&quot;===
On March 31, 2008, NBC announced that Gifford was to join its morning show, &quot;Today&quot;, as co-host of the fourth hour titled &quot;Today with Kathie Lee and Hoda&quot;, alongside Hoda Kotb. This marked her return to morning television; in many markets, she aired directly after her old show, currently called &quot;Live with Kelly and Mark&quot;. Because the fourth hour of &quot;Today&quot; airs live at 10:00 am ET, and &quot;Live with Kelly and Ryan&quot; airs live at 9:00 am ET, Gifford&#x27;s hour did not compete directly with her former show in most markets. Kotb and Gifford replaced Ann Curry and Natalie Morales. In the weeks prior to Gifford&#x27;s arrival, ratings indicated 1.9 million viewers of the fourth hour of &quot;Today&quot;. As of 2014, the fourth hour of &quot;Today&quot; with Gifford and Kotb averaged 2.15 million total viewers, an increase of 13 percent over the 2008 ratings. On December 11, 2018, it was announced that she would be leaving &quot;Today&quot; in April 2019. Her final Today Show appearance was on April 5, 2019, with a party, including a video by her children Cody and Cassidy Gifford. In 2019, they won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Informative Talk Show Host.

===Other media appearances and projects===

Gifford has made guest appearances in films and television series, and has several independently released albums on CD, including 2000&#x27;s &quot;The Heart of a Woman&quot;, featuring the single &quot;Love Never Fails&quot;.

She appeared as a spokesperson for Slim Fast diet shakes after her son Cody was born. She also was the face of Carnival Cruise Lines in the late 1980s and early 1990s, singing &quot;If my friends could see me now!&quot; In 1991 she christened the Carnival Ecstasy, the 2nd of the Fantasy Class of cruise ships. In 1994, she appeared as herself in an episode of the NBC sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.

She did a number of voice overs most notably as Echidna in the 1998 TV series &quot;Hercules&quot; and in Higglytown Heroes as the Mail Carrier Hero in 2004.

In September 2005 she became a special correspondent on &quot;The Insider&quot;, a syndicated entertainment magazine television show, ending her relationship with that program upon her co-hosting role with &quot;Today&quot;.

She played the role of Miss Hannigan in a concert performance of &quot;Annie&quot; at Madison Square Garden in December 2006.

On an episode that aired March 27, 2010, she guest starred on &quot;The Suite Life on Deck&quot;, along with her real-life daughter, Cassidy.

She appeared as herself in the 2015 television film &quot;Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!&quot;.

She has written numerous autobiographical books, &quot;Just When I Thought I&#x27;d Dropped my Last Egg: Life and Other Calamities&quot; in 2010, &quot;The Rock, the Road and the Rabbi&quot; in March 2018, and &quot;It’s Never Too Late: Make the Next Act of Your Life the Best Act of Your Life&quot; in 2020. Her book regarding the Christian faith, &quot;The Jesus I Know: Honest Conversations and Diverse Opinions about Who He Is&quot; was released in 2021. She has also written a number of children&#x27;s books.

=== Current career ===
Gifford left &quot;Today&quot; in order to pursue a movie career as an actress, director, and producer. In 2018, she filmed &quot;Then Came You&quot; in which she co-stars with Craig Ferguson. That same year, she also filmed a Hallmark Christmas movie for Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries called &quot;A Godwink Christmas&quot;. Gifford intends to make movies about the experiences of losing a loved one and being a widow, which she considers an underrepresented topic in Hollywood. Gifford has several projects in the works including sequels to &quot;Then Came You&quot;.

On April 28, 2021, Gifford was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to the television industry. Her star is located at 6834 Hollywood Boulevard, only five stars away from that of her former co-host Regis Philbin.

===Musical theatre===
In the late 1990s, Gifford began working in musical theatre. She contributed a number of musical numbers to &quot;Hats&quot;, and wrote and produced &quot;Under The Bridge&quot;, based upon the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Family Under The Bridge&quot; by Natalie Savage Carlson. In 2000 she released the album &quot;The Heart of a Woman&quot; on Universal.

Gifford wrote the book and lyrics for &quot;Saving Aimee&quot;, a stage musical about evangelist Aimee McPherson, which premiered in 2007 at the Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia. The premiere starred actress Carolee Carmello in the lead role. The show, retitled as &quot;&quot;, ran on Broadway from November 15, 2012, through December 9, 2012, with Carmello reprising her role as McPherson. On April 30, 2013, Carmello received her third Tony Award nomination for the performance.

On April 16, 2007, Gifford was a guest presenter at the Washington, D.C. Helen Hayes Award Ceremony, honoring contributions and professional accomplishments in theatre.

In 2008, Gifford and David Friedman wrote a junior high school musical entitled &quot;Key Pin It Real&quot;. The play depicts a coming-of-age story about a young girl named Key Pin. The first production took place in December 2008 in Kendallville, Indiana, at East Noble High School.

In 2011, Gifford was working on a musical adaptation of &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; with John McDaniel; McDaniel is composing music while Gifford is writing lyrics.

==Other endeavors==
===Charity===
Gifford is a celebrity ambassador for the non-profit organization Childhelp. She regularly makes appearances at fund raisers and events for the child abuse prevention and treatment organization and is an ardent supporter.

Frank and Kathie Lee Gifford raised the money to build and continued to financially support two shelters in New York City for babies born with HIV, or a congenital crack cocaine addiction. These shelters were named in honor of her children, Cody and Cassidy.

===Labor rights activity===
In 1996 Gifford was earning $9 million annually licensing her name to a brand of clothing sold at Walmart. Part of the proceeds went to charity. Charles Kernaghan&#x27;s human rights group called the National Labor Committee reported that sweatshop labor was being used in manufacturing the Kathie Lee Gifford branded clothing.

Gifford called Kernaghan&#x27;s report &quot;a vicious attack&quot; on an episode of &quot;Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot;. Gifford explained during this broadcast that she was not responsible for the contract manufacturers that made her products.
Kernaghan in his congressional testimony of April 1996, said that to make Gifford&#x27;s clothing, girls as young as 15 worked for 31 cents an hour, 75 hours a week. Kernaghan reported that a worker in Honduras smuggled a piece of clothing out of the factory, which had a Kathie Lee label on it. One of the workers, Wendy Diaz, came to the United States to testify about the conditions under which she worked. She commented, &quot;I wish I could talk to [Kathie Lee]. If she&#x27;s good, she will help us.&quot;

Gifford later contacted federal authorities to investigate the issue and worked with US federal legislative and executive branch agencies to support and enact laws to protect children against sweatshop conditions. She appeared with President Bill Clinton at the White House in support of the government&#x27;s initiatives to counter international sweatshop abuses.

==Personal life==

Kathie Lee married Paul Johnson, a composer/arranger/producer/publisher, in 1976. They gained fame in Christian music, appearing on covers of Christian magazines. The marriage was strained from the start and in 1981, Johnson moved out of their residence in Woodland Hills, California. The couple divorced in 1982.

On October 18, 1986, Kathie Lee married a second time, this time to Frank Gifford, an American football player and television sports commentator. It was his third marriage after marriages with Maxine Avis Ewart and Astrid Lindley. With Ewart he had three children.

Kathie Lee was 23 years younger than Frank Gifford. They had two children together, Cody Newton Gifford (born March 22, 1990) and Cassidy Erin Gifford (born August 2, 1993). They also shared the same birthday of August 16. Frank Gifford died on August 9, 2015, from natural causes at their Greenwich, Connecticut, home at the age of 84.

In 2017, Kathie Lee Gifford released the song &quot;He Saw Jesus&quot;, co-written with songwriter Brett James, which she dedicated to her late husband. All proceeds from the song went to the international evangelical Christian humanitarian aid charity Samaritan&#x27;s Purse.

<text>Calvary Baptist Church is an Independent Baptist church, located at 123 West 57th Street between the Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) and Seventh Avenue, near Carnegie Hall in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. , the church is at a temporary location while its building at 123 West 57th Street is being demolished and replaced.

==History==
The church was founded in 1847, and its first sanctuary was at 50 West 23rd Street, completed in 1854. It then moved to a red sandstone Gothic church designed by John Rochester Thomas at its current location, which was built in 1883–1884. It also had a chapel at 223 West 67th Street, which was later used by St. Matthew&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church.

In 1923, Calvary became one of the earliest churches to operate its own radio station and has since maintained a long tradition of widely followed religious broadcasts. &quot;Tell It From Calvary&quot; is a radio show that the church still produces weekly; it is heard on WMCA.

The building at 123 West 57th Street was an early example of an urban high-rise, or &quot;skyscraper&quot;, church, a 16-story building which also included the Hotel Salisbury, an apartment hotel. Planning for the edifice began in 1929, with the design credited to the firm of Jardine, Hill &amp; Murdock, and the building was dedicated in 1931. Two Steinway grand pianos were donated to the church by pianist Van Cliburn, who attended periodically while living in the hotel.

Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton have worshipped at Calvary. Billy Graham and Billy Sunday have preached there.

In early 2020, Calvary Baptist Church and the Salisbury Hotel closed. The Gothic Revival edifice was planned to be demolished to make way for a new office building with space for the church. Following a delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, Alchemy Properties acquired the church in July 2021, and demolition began in 2022. During the renovation, Calvary gathered every Sunday at 10 a.m. on the Manhattan campus of Hunter College, as well as online.

<doc id="343865" wikidata="Q1974036" url="?curid=343865" title="Mexican blind lizard">
<text>The Mexican blind lizard (Anelytropsis papillosus) is a species of legless lizard in the family Dibamidae, and the only species in the genus Anelytropsis. It is endemic to Mexico. They look like Amphisbaenia, but are in fact, only distantly related.

==Etymology==
Although early authors did not discuss the etymology, the generic name, &quot;Anelytropsis&quot;, is presumed to be based on the Greek words: &quot;ana&quot; = up opon; &quot;elytron&quot; = shield; &quot;ops&quot; = eye, in reference to the eyes which are concealed by ocular scales. The trivial name or specific epithet, &quot;papillosus&quot;, is Latin and refers to the minute papillae present on the scales in the anterior areas of the mouth and nose (rostral scale, first labial scale, and loreal).

==Description==
The Mexican blind lizard is a limbless lizard, adapted for burrowing. The head is discernible from the cylindrical body by only a slightly greater width. There are no ear openings and each eye is entirely concealed under a single ocular plate. There are three large plates on the top of the head. The scales on the body are &quot;scincoid&quot;, smooth with rounded edges, and may occur in even or odd numbered rows. It is a small species, ranging 20 - 50 cm. in total length. The tail is about one fourth of the total length of the lizard. Anelytropsis are brownish to flesh-colored, with some individuals exhibiting patches of pale scales producing a faint piebald appearance.

==Distribution==
&quot;Anelytropsis papillosus&quot; is endemic to Mexico. It is known from northeastern regions of the country at elevations from 300 to 2300 meters, including southern Tamaulipas, eastern San Luis Potosí, northern Hidalgo and Querétaro, northern and central Veracruz, and extreme northern Oaxaca. Considering the fact that several confirmed localities are extremely close to state boundaries, its rarity, and its fossorial and secretive behavior, some authors have speculated it should be anticipated in areas west of the confirmed distribution, specifically southern Nuevo Leon, extreme eastern Guanajuato, and eastern Puebla.

==Ecology and natural history==

Very little information has been published on the ecology and natural history of this rare and enigmatic species. Hobart M. Smith reported finding two specimens in rotten logs near ant nests and noted they were &quot;apparently&quot; feeding on termites or ants in the logs.

Collector&#x27;s accounts of finding two specimens in San Luis Potosí, on separate occasions, stated that both lizards intensely bit the collectors fingers continuously for about three or four minutes when first handled. Then each lizard engaged in thanatosis (death feigning behavior), at which time the lizards were relaxed but slightly rigid with their mouths half open, one for about two or three minutes, the other for a briefer length of time but subsequently, it suddenly lashed its body and autotomized about half of its tail.

===Habitat===

Locality records for the fossorial &quot;Anelytropsis papillosus&quot; do not correlate to surface vegetation communities or typical biogeographic patterns. It has been reported from a remarkably wide spectrum of habitats, from Chihuahuan Desert scrub flats on the Mexican Plateau, to cloud forest in the Sierra Madre Oriental (El Cielo Biosphere Reserve), and tropical deciduous forest on the coastal plain in Tamaulipas. Pine -oak forest, tropical thorn forest, and semiarid deciduous vegetation have also been identified as collecting sites. It has been found under boulders, rocks, and stones, under fallen logs, burrowing in rotten logs, and under dead yucca trees. The distribution of the species falls mostly within the Mexican ecoregions of the tropical Veracruz moist forests, the Sierra Madre Oriental pine–oak forests, and southwestern portions of the Meseta Central matorral.

==Conservation status==
The Mexican Federal Government list &quot;Anelytropsis papillosus&quot; as a threatened species and it is protected by Mexican law. In a conservation evaluation using Environmental Vulnerability Scores (EVS) [low, 3–9; medium, 10–13; high, 14–20], &quot;Anelytropsis papillosus&quot; was rated 10, a species of medium vulnerability. Conversely, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species ranked &quot;Anelytropsis papillosus&quot; as a species of least concern.

<text>Garden of the Gods (Arapaho: &quot;Ho3o’uu Niitko’usi’i&quot;) is a public park located in Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States. of the park was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1971.

== Name ==
The area now known as Garden of the Gods was first called Red Rock Corral by the Europeans. In August 1859, two surveyors who helped to found Colorado City explored the site. One of the surveyors, Melancthon S. Beach, suggested it would be a &quot;capital place for a beer garden&quot;. His companion, the young Rufus Cable, awestruck by the impressive rock formations, exclaimed, &quot;Beer garden! Why, it is a fit place for the Gods to assemble. We will call it the Garden of the Gods.&quot; However, an 1893 issue of the &quot;Colorado Transcript&quot; reported that Helen Hunt Jackson assigned the name &quot;the Garden of the Gods&quot;:Riding past the cabin of a prospector from the South in one of the early days of the settlement, she was attracted by a beautifully kept garden in which two negro servants, a man and a woman, were working. In answer to a question the man informed her that his name was Jupiter, and the woman&#x27;s Juno, whereupon she exclaimed: &quot;Then, this must be the Garden of the Gods.&quot;The name &quot;Garden of the Gods&quot; was also later given to a section of the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, California, filled with large sandstone rock formations, because of the area&#x27;s resemblance to Colorado&#x27;s Garden of the Gods. The story goes that back in the early days of Hollywood, a movie producer seeking a rocky filming location made a comment to the effect of, &quot;Who needs to go all the way to Colorado—we have our own &#x27;Garden of the Gods&#x27; here!&quot; The Iverson family took the comment to heart and began calling their own collection of rock formations the &quot;Garden of the Gods,&quot; and the name stuck. Today the main section of Chatsworth&#x27;s Garden of the Gods has also been preserved as a park.

== History ==
The garden&#x27;s red rock formations were created millions of years ago during a geological upheaval event called the Laramide Orogeny. Archaeological evidence shows that prehistoric people visited Garden of the Gods about 1330 BC. At about 250 BC, Native American people camped in the park; they are believed to have been attracted to wildlife and plant life in the area and used overhangs created by the rocks for shelter. Many native peoples have reported a connection to Garden of the Gods: Apache, Cheyenne, Comanche, Kiowa, Lakota, Pawnee, Shoshone and Ute people.

Multiple American Indian Nations traveled through Garden of the Gods. The Utes&#x27; oral traditions tell of their creation at the Garden of the Gods, and petroglyphs have been found in the park that are typical of early Utes. The Utes found red rocks to have a spiritual connection and camped near Manitou Springs and the creek near Rock Ledge Ranch bordering Garden of the Gods. The Old Ute Trail went past Garden of the Gods to Ute Pass and led later explorers through Manitou Springs. Starting in the 16th century, Spanish explorers and later European American explorers and trappers traveled through the area, including Lt. John C. Frémont and Lt. George Frederick Ruxton, who recorded their visits in their journals.

In 1879 AD, Charles Elliott Perkins, a friend of William Jackson Palmer, purchased of land that included a portion of the present Garden of the Gods. Upon Perkins&#x27; death, his family gave the land to the City of Colorado Springs in 1909, with the provision that it would be a free public park. Palmer had owned the Rock Ledge Ranch and upon his death it was donated to the city.

Helen Hunt Jackson wrote of the park, &quot;You wind among rocks of every conceivable and inconceivable shape and size... all bright red, all motionless and silent, with a strange look of having been just stopped and held back in the very climax of some supernatural catastrophe.&quot;

In 1995, the Garden of the Gods Visitor and Nature Center was opened just outside the park.

== Geological formations ==

The outstanding geologic features of the park, including Steamboat Rock, the Three Graces, and Balanced Rock, are the ancient sedimentary beds of deep-red, pink and white sandstones, conglomerates and limestone that were deposited horizontally, but have now been tilted vertically and faulted into &quot;fins&quot; by the immense mountain building forces caused by the uplift of the Rocky Mountains and the Pikes Peak massif. The following Pleistocene Ice Age resulted in erosion and glaciation of the rock, creating the present rock formations. Evidence of past ages can be read in the rocks: ancient seas, eroded remains of ancestral mountain ranges, alluvial fans, sandy beaches and great sand dune fields.

== Ecology ==
The Garden of the Gods Park is a rich ecological resource. Retired biology professor Richard Beidleman notes that the park is &quot;the most striking contrast between plains and mountains in North America&quot; with respect to biology, geology, climate, and scenery. The skull of a dinosaur was found in the park in 1878, and was identified in 2006 as a unique species, &quot;Theiophytalia kerri&quot;. A subspecies of honey ant not previously recorded was also discovered in 1879 and named after the park. Mule deer, bighorn sheep and fox are common. The park is also home to more than 130 species of birds, including white-throated swifts, swallows and canyon wrens.

== Recreation ==
The Garden of the Gods Park is popular for hiking, technical rock climbing, road and mountain biking and horseback riding. It attracts more than two million visitors a year, making it the city&#x27;s most visited park. There are of trails. Annual events including summer running races, recreational bike rides and Pro Cycling Challenge Prologue also take place in this park.

The main trail in the park, the Perkins Central Garden Trail, is paved and wheelchair-accessible, running &quot;through the heart of the park&#x27;s largest and most scenic red rocks&quot;. The trail begins at the North Parking lot, the main parking lot off of Juniper Way Loop.

Because of the unusual and steep rock formations in the park, it is an attractive destination for rock climbers. Rock climbing is permitted, with annual permits obtained at the City of Colorado Springs&#x27; website. Climbers are required to follow the &quot;Technical Climbing Regulations and Guidelines&quot;, which includes using proper equipment, climbing in parties of two or more, and a ban on staining chalks. Precipitation makes rocks unstable and therefore climbing is not allowed when the rocks are wet or icy. There are fines for unregistered climbers and possibly rescue costs. Several fatalities have occurred over the years, often when unlawful climbers fail to use proper safety equipment, or, more rarely, when a lawful climber falls due to equipment failure or user error.

== Visitor and nature center ==
The Garden of the Gods Visitor and Nature Center is located at 1805 N. 30th Street and offers a view of the park. The center&#x27;s information center and 30 educational exhibits are staffed by Parks, Recreation and Culture employees of the City of Colorado Springs. A short movie, &quot;How Did Those Red Rocks Get There?&quot;, runs every 20 minutes. A portion of the proceeds from the center&#x27;s privately owned store and cafe support the non-profit Garden of the Gods Foundation; the money is used for maintenance and improvements to the park.

Natural history exhibits include minerals, geology, plants and local wildlife, as well as Native Americans who visited the park. Programs include nature hikes and talks, a Junior Ranger program, narrated bus tours, movies, educational programs and special programs.

==Hours and admission==
Both the Garden of the Gods Park and the Visitor and Nature Center are free to the public. Park hours are:

* 5:00a.m. to 10:00p.m. from May1 to October31, and

<doc id="343870" wikidata="Q1007776" url="?curid=343870" title="Gallotia">
<text>The genus Gallotia are the lacertids (wall lizards) of the Canary Islands. This genus consists of a group that has been evolving there ever since the first islands emerged from the sea over 20 million years ago. The endemic species and subspecies of this group have a number of characteristics that make them quite special within their family (Lacertidae); their only close relatives are the sandrunner lizards (&quot;Psammodromus&quot;) of the western Mediterranean region. &quot;Gallotia&quot; are characteristic for eating significant quantities of plants, and several lineages are often presented as classic examples for insular gigantism. However, a find of an even larger &quot;Gallotia&quot; species from the early Miocene of mainland Europe casts doubt on this assumption. Instead the ancestor of all modern &quot;Gallotia&quot; species of the Canary islands was probably already very large but carnivorous (Černaňský et al., 2016).

==Systematics and biogeography==
This genus can be broadly divided into two groups - lineages originating from the colonization of the earliest Canary Islands of Lanzarote, Fuerteventura and Gran Canaria, probably between 10-20 million years ago, and a lineage that colonised the younger western islands probably less than 10 million years ago (Cox et al., 2010). Both lineages contain large and small species.

MtDNA analyses indicate that Lanzarote and Fuerteventura were colonized first and this led to the small body-sized &quot;G. atlantica&quot; which is present today (Cox et al., 2010). Gran Canaria was the next island to have been colonized from Lanzarote/Fuerteventura, giving rise to the large body-sized species, &quot;G. stehlini&quot; (Cox et al., 2010). Finally, the clade that colonized the younger western islands was likely to have originated from Lanzarote/Fuerteventura. This western island clade diverged into two groups, all of which colonized Tenerife, La Palma, La Gomera and El Hierro, leading to 1) a medium-bodied (e.g., &quot;G. caesaris&quot; from El Hierro) and 2) a large bodied &quot;giant&quot; species (e.g., &quot;G. simonyi&quot; from El Hierro) on each of these islands (note that &quot;G. intermedia&quot; from Tenerife belongs to the &quot;giant&quot; group, but present-day individuals are not that large). The giant species now exist, at best, in small relict populations, while &quot;G. auritae&quot; may be extinct on La Palma.

Prehistoric remains were assigned to the taxa &quot;G. goliath&quot; and &quot;G. maxima&quot;, the former supposedly occurring on several islands, the latter only on Tenerife. It was eventually determined, however, that &quot;G. maxima&quot; is a junior synonym of &quot;G. goliath&quot;, and that the latter was very close to &quot;G. simonyi&quot;; supposed &quot;G. goliath&quot; specimens from El Hierro, La Gomera, and La Palma are probably just extremely large individuals of, respectively, &quot;G. simonyi&quot;, &quot;G. bravoana&quot;, and &quot;G. auaritae&quot; (Barahona &quot;et al.&quot; 2000). However, a mummified giant specimen from Tenerife yielded ancient DNA remains, and by analysis of this, it was concluded that &quot;G. goliath&quot; is a valid species that probably was restricted to Tenerife, and apparently was closer to &quot;G. intermedia&quot; than to &quot;G. simonyi&quot; (Maca-Meyer &quot;et al.&quot; 2003).

<doc id="343872" wikidata="Q452354" url="?curid=343872" title="Gertrude Jekyll">
<text>Gertrude Jekyll ( ; 29 November 1843 – 8 December 1932) was a British horticulturist, garden designer, craftswoman, photographer, writer and artist. She created over 400 gardens in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States, and wrote over 1000 articles for magazines such as &quot;Country Life&quot; and William Robinson&#x27;s &quot;The Garden&quot;. Jekyll has been described as &quot;a premier influence in garden design&quot; by British and American gardening enthusiasts.

== Early life ==
Jekyll was born at 2 Grafton Street, Mayfair, London, the fifth of the seven children of Captain Edward Joseph Hill Jekyll, Esquire, an officer in the Grenadier Guards, and his wife Julia, &quot;née&quot; Hammersley. In 1848 her family left London and moved to Bramley House in Surrey. She never married and had no children.

Her younger brother, Walter Jekyll (an Anglican priest; sometime Minor Canon of Worcester Cathedral and Chaplain of Malta), was a friend of Robert Louis Stevenson, who borrowed the family name for his 1886 novella &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;.

== Themes ==
Jekyll was one half of one of the most influential and historical partnerships of the Arts and Crafts movement, thanks to her association with the English architect Edwin Lutyens, for whose projects she created numerous landscapes and who designed her home Munstead Wood, near Godalming in Surrey. (In 1900, Lutyens and Jekyll&#x27;s brother Herbert designed the British Pavilion for the Paris Exposition.)

Jekyll is remembered for her outstanding designs and subtle, painterly approach to the arrangement of the gardens she created, particularly her &quot;hardy flower borders&quot;. Her work is known for its radiant colour and the brush-like strokes of her plantings; it is suggested by some that the Impressionistic-style schemes may have been due to Jekyll&#x27;s deteriorating eyesight, which largely put an end to her career as a painter and watercolourist. Her artistic ability had been evident when she was a child and she had trained as an artist.
She was one of the first of her profession to take into account the colour, texture, and experience of gardens as aspects of her designs. Jekyll&#x27;s theory of how to design with colour was influenced by painter J. M. W. Turner and by Impressionism, and by the theoretical colour wheel. Her focus on gardening began at South Kensington School of Art,
where she became interested in the creative art of planting, and more specifically, gardening. In 1904, Jekyll returned to her childhood home in the village of Bramley to design a garden for Millmead House in Snowdenham Lane.

Not wanting to limit her influence to teaching the practice of gardening, Jekyll incorporated in her work the theory of gardening and an understanding of the plants themselves. Her writing was influenced by her friend Theresa Earle who had published her &quot;Pot-pourri&quot; books. In works like &quot;Colour Schemes for the Flower Garden&quot; (reprinted 1988) she put her imprint on modern uses of &quot;warm&quot; and &quot;cool&quot; flower colours in gardens. Her concern that plants should be displayed to best effect even when cut for the house, led her to design her own range of glass flower vases.

Later in life, Jekyll collected and contributed a vast array of plants solely for the purpose of preservation to numerous institutions across Britain. At the time of her death, she had designed over 400 gardens in Britain, Europe and a few in North America. Jekyll was also known for her prolific writing. She wrote fourteen books, ranging from &quot;Wood and Garden&quot; and her most famous book, &quot;Colour in the Flower Garden,&quot; to memoirs of her youth.

She was also interested in traditional cottage furnishings and rural crafts, and concerned that they were disappearing. Her book &quot;Old West Surrey&quot; (1904) records many aspects of 19th-century country life, with over 300 photographs taken by Jekyll.

== Gardens ==

From 1881, when she laid out the gardens for Munstead House, built for her mother by John James Stevenson, Jekyll provided designs or planned planting for some four hundred gardens. More than half were directly commissioned, but many were created in collaboration with architects such as Lutyens and Robert Lorimer. Most of her gardens are lost. A small number have been restored, including her own garden at Munstead Wood, the gardens of Hestercombe House and The Croft in Brook, Surrey, and those of Woolverstone House and the Manor House in Upton Grey that she designed for the magazine editor Charles Holme. Miss Jekyll designed the plans at Durmast House and Gardens and has recently been restored, including a Summer House designed by her long standing friend, Sir Edward Lutyens.

== Awards ==
Jekyll was awarded the Victoria Medal of Honour of the Royal Horticultural Society in 1897 and the Veitch Memorial Medal of the society in 1929. Also in 1929, she was given the George Robert White Medal of Honor of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society.

== Death and burial ==

Jekyll died on 8 December 1932 at her home, Munstead Wood, in Surrey. She was buried in the churchyard of St John the Baptist, Busbridge, Godalming, next to her brother, Herbert Jekyll, and his wife, the artist, writer and philanthropist Dame Agnes Jekyll. The Jekyll family memorial was designed by Edwin Lutyens.

==Legacy==
In 1907, Jekyll donated her collection of traditional household items and objects relating to &quot;Old Surrey&quot; to the Surrey Archaeological Society. Much of this donation is still on display at Guildford Museum. In 1911, the Corporation of Guildford built an extension to the museum to house the collection. Some artefacts associated with her life and work are also housed there.

On 29 November 2017, a Google Doodle was released honouring Jekyll on what would have been her 174th birthday.

In 2023, the National Trust bought her home Munstead Wood through a private sale.

<text>Acanthodactylus is a genus of lacertid lizards, commonly referred to as fringe-fingered lizards, fringe-toed lizards (though the latter common name is also used for the New World lizard genus &quot;Uma&quot;), and spiny-toed lizards.

==Geographic range==
The approximately 40 species in the genus &quot;Acanthodactylus&quot; are native to a wide area in North Africa, southern Europe and Western Asia; across the Sahara Desert, to the Iberian Peninsula, and east through the Arabian Peninsula, to Afghanistan and western India.

==Habitat==
Though lizards of the genus &quot;Acanthodactylus&quot; prefer dry and sparsely vegetated regions, they are not strictly tied to an arid terrain; so it is not uncommon to come across them in various environments.

==Description==
Members of the genus &quot;Acanthodactylus&quot; possess the following combination of traits:
*Lacking occipital scales,
*Flat ventral scales, 
*Fingers with three or four series of scales, 
*Toes with comb-like projections, 
*Femoral pores present, 
*Parietal foramen present.

The coloration and pattern of spots of &quot;Acanthodactylus&quot; is extremely variable, so it is unsurprising that zoologists have, at one time or another, classified every variety as a separate species.

==Behavior==
Every saurian of the genus &quot;Acanthodactylus&quot; is very aggressive and gets continuously involved in skirmishes with other members of its species. The males strenuously defend the borders of their territories.

==Reproduction==
&quot;Acanthodactylus&quot; are oviparous. The number of eggs in a clutch ranges from 3 to 7. The total length of a sexually mature adult of the genus is, on average, .

==Classification==
Genus &quot;Acanthodactylus&quot; 

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Acanthodactylus&quot;.

<text>Adolfus is a genus of lizards of the family Lacertidae. The genus is endemic to subsaharan Africa.

==Etymology==
The generic name, &quot;Adolfus&quot;, is in honor of German explorer Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg.

==Description==
&quot;Adolfus&quot; are typically relatively large lacertids measuring in snout–vent length (SVL), except for the much smaller &quot;Adolfus masavaensis&quot; measuring only . The tail is cylindrical, without lateral fringes, and relatively long, about 1.7–2 times SVL. There is no sexual dimorphism. Based on &quot;Adolfus jacksoni&quot;, the clutch size is 3–5 eggs.

==Habitat==
&quot;Adolfus&quot; inhabit forest, forest clearings, and grasslands. &quot;A. jacksoni&quot; inhabits also urban environments. &quot;Adolfus alleni&quot; has been recorded as high as above sea level.

==Species==
The following species are recognized as being valid:
*&quot;Adolfus africanus&quot; 
*&quot;Adolfus alleni&quot; 
*&quot;Adolfus jacksoni&quot; 
*&quot;Adolfus kibonotensis&quot; 
*&quot;Adolfus masavaensis&quot;

<text>Darevskia is a genus of wall lizards of the family Lacertidae. Member species are native to the Caucasus, Iran and Turkey, living in forest and grassy habitats with numerous rock outcrops. Among rock lizards, seven parthenogenetic species are known.

==Description==
&quot;Darevskia&quot; species are small lizards with a head and body length of , and with a tail length about two times longer. The body is usually flattened, the head is pointed in shape and in most species flattened in a vertical plane, which allows lizards to hide in narrow crevices between stones and rocks. Rock lizards have relatively long legs with special calluses on the inner surfaces of the paws and sharp claws, thanks to which they quickly move along the vertical rough surfaces of rocks and stones.

The color of rock lizards varies from different tones of green to sand. Females are usually colored paler than males. On the dorsal side of the body, rock lizards have an occipital stripe composed of a set of black or brown spots and a wide line of the lizard&#x27;s main color, and dark patterns on the sides of the body. In some species, blue or violet spots with white circles in the center and / or monotonous blue-violet spots at the junction of the abdominal scutes with trunk scales are located on the anterior third of the body. Most types of rock lizards are characterized by a diverse color of the abdominal side of the body, ranging from various shades of pink, red and orange to yellow and green.

==Etymology==
The generic name, &quot;Darevskia&quot;, is in honor of Russian herpetologist Ilya Sergeyevich Darevsky.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
In 1830, a professor at Kazan University, Eduard Friedrich Eversmann (1794–1860) made an expedition to the North Caucasus. As a result of which he described two new species: a meadow lizard, &quot;Lacerta praticola&quot; , and a rock lizard &quot;Lacerta saxicola&quot; . At that time, European scientists did not recognize the independence of the species &quot;L. saxicola&quot;, considering it as part of the European &quot;L. muralis&quot; . But at the beginning of the XX century between the two zoologists Lajos Méhelÿ (1862–1953) and George Albert Boulenger (1858–1937) there was a lengthy discussion about the taxonomic position of &quot;L. saxicola&quot;, which was resolved in favor of the former, and &quot;L. saxicola&quot; and subspecies were further considered separately from &quot;L. muralis&quot;. For several decades, scientists from different countries studied the monophyletic group of rock lizards independently, highlighting new subspecies, simplifying some taxa and describing new species. It was on this group of lizards that the phenomenon of parthenogenesis in amniotic vertebrates was first discovered by the Russian zoologist Ilya Sergeyevich Darevsky (1924–2009), who also made a significant contribution to understanding the ecology, systematics, and morphology of rock lizards. In 1997, the Spanish scientist named the genus of rock lizards &quot;Darevskia&quot; and designated the type species as &quot;D. saxicola&quot;.

==Cladistics==
According to Arribas (1997), the genus &quot;Darevskia&quot; includes four groups (clades), combining species by origin and kinship: “raddei”, “rudis”, “saxicola” and “caucasica”. Subsequently, three more clades were identified: “praticola”, “chlorogaster”, and “defilippii”. In total, the genus includes 35 species, 7 of which breed parthenogenetically, and 22 subspecies.

==Species==

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Darevskia&quot;.

== Distribution ==
Rock lizards are common in Abkhazia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Iran, Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia (Adygea, Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, Krasnodar Territory, Republic of Crimea, North Ossetia-Alania, Stavropol Territory and Chechnya), in Turkey and South Ossetia. It is worth noting that the boundaries of the range of some species are not reliably known, but the expected areas of their encounters coincide with the already indicated distribution sites for the whole genus

== Habitat ==
Rock lizards are found in various high-altitude zones from above sea level and occupy a variety of landscapes: mountain-steppe, forest-steppe, mountain meadow, mountain forest, anthropogenic and coastal. By confinement to one or another habitat, they can be conditionally divided into several groups:

1) Lizards living in the forest, according to the occupied microreliefs, are divided into: adhering to rock outcrops (&quot;D. raddei, D. brauneri)&quot; and independent of them, able to live in habitats in which there are no rocks, using rodent burrows as shelters, deciduous litter, cavities in trees and bark (e.g. &quot;D. chlorogaster, D. armeniaca&quot;).

2) Inhabitants in areas of bedrock outcrops and clayey cliffs in alpine and subalpine meadows. As shelters, they often use rodent burrows, cavities between stones and cracks in the rocks. These habitats are adhered to by &quot;D. alpina&quot; and &quot;D. mixta, D. armeniaca&quot; and &quot;D. valentini&quot;.

3) Rock lizards of dry and moderately dry landscapes (alpine steppes) of rocks and their feet on slopes with dry-loving shrubbery and grassy vegetation, road slopes. Such habitats have a large number of crevices and voids serving as shelters for lizards. Such species are found in such landscapes as: &quot;D. rudis, D. portschinski, D. daghestanica, D. raddei, D. saxicola&quot;.

4) Occupying anthropogenic habitats: an abandoned building, walls in cities, abandoned temples, monasteries, etc., where their number often exceeds that in natural habitats. For example, &quot;D. armeniaca, D. lindholmi, D. dahli&quot;.

Rock lizards are found at heights of 0 – 3000 m above sea level. Zonal and geographical distribution is determined by the amount of precipitation, average annual temperature, duration of the adverse season, and exposure of the slope. For example, &quot;D. daghestanica&quot; on the southern slope of the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range (South Ossetia) is distributed at altitudes of above sea level, and on the northern slopes (Dagestan) at above sea level.

==Nutrition==
Rock lizards feed on various invertebrates with a body size from a few millimeters to : spiders, diptera, lepidoptera, hymenoptera, cockroaches, orthoptera, semi-rigid-winged, coleoptera, wood lice, worms, slugs, marine and freshwater amphipods, caddis flies, chironomids and sometimes parts of plants. Also, particular cases of cannibalism were recorded when adults ate juvenile individuals.

Despite the diversity of the food supply, rock lizards can develop preferences for feeding on invertebrates of a certain group (for example, flying forms of ants), which is caused by seasonal changes in the availability or abundance of this type of prey. Even after a significant reduction in the density of invertebrates of this group, lizards continue to hunt for them for some time in the presence of more accessible food objects.

== Population density and spatial structure of the population ==
Rock lizards are extremely rare on their own, usually forming settlements. The population density of parthenogenetic rock lizards can vary in a wider range than that of bisexual species: up to 200 individuals per 1 km of the route in unisexual species and up to 80 individuals in bisexual species, which is explained by the fact that parthenogenetic species are less aggressive and have a high population growth rate.

Rock lizards are characterized by complex and diverse social systems, which, in particular, are characterized by stable long-term friendly relations between the male and the female and territorial or hierarchical relations between individuals of the same sex.

The basis of the settlements of bisexual rock lizards are sedentary males and females with individual sites, often overlapping. In a number of species, some males possess territories protected from other males. The territories of males never overlap, but their centers of activity, primarily associated with basking, coincide with the centers of activity of females that live within their territories.

The study of the social behavior and spatial structure of rock lizard populations has been the subject of a number of scientific papers published based on the results of many years of research

==Activity==
The seasonal activity of rock lizards is determined by temperature indicators. Therefore, species living at different heights differ in terms of exit from wintering shelters, mating period, laying of eggs, hatching of young individuals and time of leaving for wintering. Around the end of February until the end of May, exit from wintering shelters occurs, and the active period is from 6–7 months (in the mountains) and up to 9–10 months (in the valleys and on the seashore). During this period, mature individuals mate, and females lay eggs. Hibernation takes place from late September to mid November.

The beginning and end of the daily activity of the lizard is determined by the lighting conditions within the individual area, and in some individuals it can start early in the morning, while individuals living on the slopes of the northern exposure or in deep forest valleys are active for several hours in the middle of the day [4]. After heating (basking), the body temperature of the lizard reaches about , and it begins a routine activity aimed at supporting the body. Late in the evening, when the heat subsides, the animals return to the basking places and stay there for some time, after which they go to their night shelters.

== Reproduction ==
Rock lizards reach maturity in the second (females) and third (males) year of life with a total life expectancy of up to 13 years. Mating of some species of rock lizards occurs after the first molt, approximately 3–5 weeks after leaving wintering (&quot;D. brauneri)&quot;, in others, immediately after leaving wintering shelter (&quot;D. valentini)&quot;. Egg laying begins in the second half of June and lasts until early August. Clutch size is usually 2 to 7 eggs. The incubation period lasts approximately 55–65 days. Young animals with a snout-to-vent length (SVL) of about are born in late summer.

==The evolution and origin of parthenogenetic species of Darevskia==
Separation of the genus &quot;Darevskia&quot; from the subfamily Lacertinae occurred approximately 12-16 million years ago, in the middle of the Miocene. Presumably, the ancestral form of the genus &quot;Darevskia&quot; penetrated the territory of the Western Caucasus in the Middle Miocene or in the Middle Pliocene, when there was a land connection between Asia Minor and the Balkans.

The genus of rock lizards has 7 parthenogenetic species: &quot;D. armeniaca, D. bendimahiensis, D. dahli, D. rostombekovi, D. sapphirina, D. unisexualis&quot; and &quot;D. uzzelli&quot;, resulting from the hybridization of males and females of different bisexual species. Moreover, &quot;D. valentini&quot; and &quot;D. portschinskii&quot; always enter as paternal species, and &quot;D. mixta, D. nairensis, D. raddei&quot; always enter as maternal species. From the point of view of the classical concept of a species, homosexual taxa cannot be assigned a species status due to the lack of exchange of genetic material between individuals within the same population. However, on the basis of morphological and cytogenetic characters, they are assigned a species rank.

The appearance of parthenogenetic species is usually associated with the last, Wurm glaciation. Parthenogenetic rock lizards appeared about 10 thousand years ago when, due to the formation of mountain glaciers, the habitats of the parent bisexual species were disturbed, which led to the overlap of their ranges and the hybridogenic formation of parthenogenetic individuals better adapted to the conditions of short summers and long winters. Due to the doubled reproduction rate and successful resettlement, same-sex populations later began to exist independently of the parent species.

Hybridization occurs in places where the ranges of parthenogenetic and bisexual species overlap, resulting in the appearance of triploid sterile females and a small number of males, with changes in the reproductive system (malfunctions in the formation of reproductive products, hermaphroditism). Nevertheless, presumably, these males are able to give offspring, which leads to the appearance of tetraploid hybrids. Sometimes males emerge from unfertilized eggs laid by parthenogenetic females. Like males of hybrid origin, they have reproductive disorders, which may not interfere with their offspring. A small amount of parthenogenetic female males emerging from clutches is explained by frequently occurring mutations incompatible with life.

Despite the fact that as a result of parthenogenesis, individuals are born that receive hereditary material only from the mother&#x27;s body, a small intraspecific genetic diversity has been revealed due to mutational processes, genetic instability and the appearance of same-sex species as a result of repeated and independent crossing of parental species among themselves.

<text>Gastropholis is a genus of Equatorial African lacertid lizards of the family Lacertidae which is distributed in southern Liberia, Ivory Coast and Ghana, western Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Democratic Republic of Congo, eastern Kenya, Tanzania and south to northeastern Mozambique.

==Etymology==
&quot;Gastropholis&quot; is derived from the ancient Greek words &quot;gaster&quot; (γαστήρ) which means &quot;belly, stomach&quot; and, &quot;pholis&quot; (φολῐ́ς), a &quot;horny scale of a reptile&quot;. The common name of these lizards is Keel-bellied Lizards.

==Habitat and natural history==
Not much is known but all species of this genus are diurnal, arboreal and often secretive. They inhabit forests, woodland and thicket of coastal plains from sea level to 2000 m altitude. Usually they live high up in the trees 10 m or more above ground level and hide in holes or under loose bark. For sun-basking and feeding (insects and other arthropods, also smaller lizards) they move on branches using their prehensile tails as balancing organs.

Eggs are laid in moist tree holes. &quot;Gastropholis prasina&quot; is known to produce clutches of five-ten eggs. At 26-29 °C incubation temperature the eggs hatched after 61 days.

==Diagnosis==
&quot;Gastropholis&quot; shares with the other genera of Equatorial African lacertids (EAL; &quot;Adolfus&quot;, &quot;Congolacerta&quot;, &quot;Holaspis&quot;) the consistently absent parietal foramen, the parietal scale extending to the edge of the parietal table and a single postnasal scale.

The species of &quot;Gastropholis&quot; are characterized by a high ventral scale count (10-14 rows, other EAL only 6 rows transversely), keeled ventrals (smooth in all other EAL), and a long prehensile tail. &quot;Gastropholis&quot; species are the largest of the EAL clade with adult snout-vent lengths of 80–110 mm.
They are well adapted for climbing with their long limbs, hooked claws and long tails. For a key to the species of &quot;Gastropholis&quot; see Arnold (1989).

==Species==
Four species are recognized:
*&quot;Gastropholis echinata&quot; 
*&quot;Gastropholis prasina&quot; - green keel-bellied lizard
*&quot;Gastropholis tropidopholis&quot; 
*&quot;Gastropholis vittata&quot; - keelbelly ground lizard

<text>Holaspis is a genus of equatorial African lizards in the family Lacertidae. These lizards are capable of gliding flight for distances of 30 meters (98 feet).

==Etymology==
The Neo-Latin word &quot;&quot;Holaspis&quot; &quot; is derived from the Greek words &quot;&quot;aspis&quot;, ἀσπίς (= a buckler, or round shield) and &quot;holos&quot;&quot;, ὅλος, ὅλως (= whole, all, complete). It refers to the head scalation with frontoparietal and occipital scales all fused.

==Description==
In morphology-based parsimony and compatibility analyses Arnold (1989) recognized a clade called the &quot;Equatorial African group&quot; including &quot;Adolfus&quot;, &quot;Gastropholis&quot;, and &quot;Holaspis&quot;. In all lacertids of this clade the parietal foramen is consistently absent, the parietal scale extends to the edge of the parietal table, and the postnasal scale is single.
In &quot;Holaspis&quot; the head and body are very depressed, frontoparietal and occipital scales are all fused to shields, the tail is depressed with lateral fringes of scales, and the third and fourth toes of the forefoot are fused for nearly their entire joint. There are two longitudinal rows of smooth broad band-like scales down the vertebral line of the back and on the tail. The ventral scales are smooth.
The collar is composed of 9 to 15 small scales. 16 to 24 femoral pores are present, more developed in males. Maximum total length (including tail) in both species is , and maximum snout-vent-length (SVL) is . There is no sexual dimorphism in SVL, but males have larger heads and their tail base is wider.

Dorsally the ground colour is black. On the head from the tip of the snout to the nape of the neck there is a yellow to yellow greenish median line. On each side of the back outside the large dorsal scales there runs a turquoise to sky blue longitudinal stripe which fuses on the tail base. From there it travels as a clear blue stripe partly interrupted onto the tip of the tail. 
The pattern of the flanks differs in the two species: In &quot;H. guentheri&quot; there are two yellowish brown to greyish lines on the flanks while in &quot;H. laevis&quot; there runs only one broader yellowish brown to red brown or usually beige stripe from the tip of the snout to the hind limb. The wide tail scales on the sides are yellow to orange-coloured.

The number of light or dark stripes is the only known external morphological difference between the two species. As Arnold (1989) wrote:
H. guentheri: &quot;A dark vertebral stripe on body and three dark stripes on each side&quot;.
H. laevis: &quot;A dark vertebral stripe and two dark stripes on each side&quot;.

Ventrally the lizards are coloured yellow or orange to greenish-orange, partly with a mother-of-pearl shimmer. Males are often more brightly coloured. Juveniles resemble their parents but the coloured dorsal stripes are narrower and less intensely coloured. Ventrally the juveniles are pitch-black in contrast to the adults.

==Species==
Two species are recognized as being valid. Formerly &quot;H. laevis&quot; was a subspecies of &quot;H. guentheri&quot;.
==Habitat and natural history==
&quot;Holaspis&quot; are diurnal, arboreal, extremely agil lacertids and able to move on vertical and overhanging surfaces with body and tail pressed closely to the surface. They live on larger trees at least above the forest floor in primary forest, man-influenzed areas and even in Eucalyptus forest with smooth bark but are not found in closed forest. The serrated tail is considered as an additional tree climbing adaption to increase grip.

They are active hunters of small insects and other arthropods like ants, grasshoppers and spiders, often investigating crevices in which they also frequently hide.

Not much is known about the reproduction in nature. More than one clutch/year is produced. Females lay two eggs under loose bark or in leaf litter. Specimen from northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo laid eggs in June and females from Nyasaland caught on 3 August held two well developed eggs.

==Flight==
The species of &quot;Holaspis&quot; are unique among lacertids in being capable of gliding flight between trees up to 30 m distance. Adaptions for gliding are the flat body and tail, the fused fingers and their low body mass. Their bones are packed full of air spaces, making the lizard&#x27;s skeleton feather light for gliding.

Like many other lacertids, &quot;Holaspis&quot; flattens its body when basking by rotating the dorsal ribs forward. In &quot;Holaspis&quot; however, this same behaviour was exapted for flight, spreading and flattening the body until it is round like a coin.

They are less specialized for flight than species of the agamid genus &quot;Draco&quot; or gekkonid genus &quot;Ptychozoon&quot;.

==Vivarium keeping==
&quot;Holaspis&quot; species are occasionally kept as pets. But &quot;Holaspis guentheri&quot; and &quot;H. laevis&quot; are often confused in pet trade or generally named &quot;H. guentheri&quot; because &quot;H. laevis&quot; was formerly only a subspecies of &quot;H. guentheri&quot;. Nearly all &quot;Holaspis&quot; in the pet trade are &quot;H. laevis&quot;. For discrimination of the two species see &quot;Description&quot;. Captive breeding resulted in an increase of information on the biology of &quot;Holaspis&quot;.

<doc id="343885" wikidata="Q946579" url="?curid=343885" title="Latastia">
<text>Latastia is a genus of lizards of the family Lacertidae. Species of this genus are distributed in Africa (Egypt, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Cameroon, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Zambia, Senegal, Zimbabwe, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Tanzania) but one subspecies (&quot;Latastia longicaudata andersonii&quot;) lives in Yemen. Collectively, they are known as long-tailed lizards.

==Etymology==
Jacques von Bedriaga named this genus in honor of French herpetologist Fernand Lataste.

==Diagnosis==
Species of &quot;Latastia&quot; are medium to large-sized lacertids with long cylindrical tails. The unregenerated tail is up to 3.2 times longer than head and body. Eyes with movable lids. The nostril is surrounded by 3-5 scales and usually reaches the first supralabial. The collar is well marked. Ventral plates smooth and in 6 longitudinal series (sometimes 8-10 with outer plates small). The dorsal scales are homogenous, small and granular or imbricate. There are no expanded scales along the mid-back line as in &quot;Philochortus&quot;. Femoral pores are present on the inside of the thighs, more prominent in males. Tail base in males much broader than in females.

==Habitat and natural history==
Most long-tailed lizards of the genus &quot;Latastia&quot; inhabit well vegetated sandy or gravelly plains and large wadis in western and eastern Africa. They can be found in semidesert scrubland and deciduous &quot;Acacia&quot;-&quot;Commiphora&quot; bushland where scrubby undergrowth is plentiful, in moist savanna and high grassland or in millet fields. &quot;Latastia boscai boscai&quot; and &quot;L. b. burii&quot; are known to occur in stony and rocky localities. Species of &quot;Latastia&quot; are distributed from sea level to 2000 m altitude.
They are diurnal, heliophilous and terrestrial, extremely wary fast-running lacertids which wander over large territories but forage mostly within vegetation cover during the heat of the day. They dart out into the sun to capture insects and other arthropods, after which they retreat into shady areas beneath bushes (thermoregulation). All species lay eggs but clutch details are known only for &quot;L. longicaudata&quot;. The population in Senegal (&quot;L. l. longicaudata&quot;) produces clutches of 5-7 eggs between July and September while females of &quot;L. l. revoili&quot; in southeastern Kenya lay only 3-4 eggs/clutch. Hatchlings appear during the wet season.

==Species==

The genus is composed of 10 recognized species. Subspecies are described for &quot;Latastia boscai&quot;, &quot;L. doriai&quot;, and &quot;L. longicaudata&quot;.

*&quot;Latastia boscai&quot; – Eritrea long-tailed lizard, Bosca&#x27;s long-tailed lizard
**&quot;L. b. boscai&quot; 
**&quot;L. b. arenicola&quot; 
**&quot;L. b. burii&quot; 
*&quot;Latastia caeruleopunctata&quot; – Parker&#x27;s long-tailed lizard
*&quot;Latastia cherchii&quot; 
*&quot;Latastia doriai&quot; – Doria&#x27;s long-tailed lizard
**&quot;L. d. doriai&quot; 
**&quot;L. d. martensi&quot; 
**&quot;L. d. scorteccii&quot; 
*&quot;Latastia johnstoni&quot; – Johnston&#x27;s long-tailed lizard, Nyasaland long-tailed lizard
*&quot;Latastia longicaudata&quot; – southern long-tailed lizard, common long-tailed lizard
**&quot;L. l. longicaudata&quot; 
**&quot;L. l. andersonii&quot; 
**&quot;L. l. lanzai&quot; 
**&quot;L. l. revoili&quot; 
*&quot;Latastia ornata&quot; 
*&quot;Latastia petersiana&quot; – Peters&#x27;s long-tailed lizard
*&quot;Latastia siebenrocki&quot; – Siebenrock&#x27;s long-tailed lizard
*&quot;Latastia taylori&quot; – Taylor&#x27;s long-tailed lizard

&quot;Latastia petersiana&quot; is the new name for &quot;Latastia carinata&quot; .

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Latastia&quot;.

<doc id="343893" wikidata="Q2070539" url="?curid=343893" title="Philochortus">
<text>Philochortus is a genus of lizards of the family Lacertidae. Species of this genus are distributed in Egypt, Algeria, Libya, Mali, Niger, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Eritrea, Somalia, Kenya, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia.

==Etymology==
&quot;Philochortus&quot; means grass-loving (Greek: &quot;philos&quot; = friend, &quot;chortos&quot; = grass). The common name of &quot;Philochortus&quot; species is therefore grass-loving lizards, or shield-backed ground lizards because of their typical back scalation and terrestrial habitat.

==Diagnosis==
Species of &quot;Philochortus&quot; are medium to large-sized lacertids with long cylindrical tails. The unregenerated tail is up to 3.25 times longer than head and body. Eyes with movable lids. The nostril is pierced between two shields and usually bordered by the first supralabial or narrowly separated from it. The collar is well marked. The ventral plates are smooth, feebly imbricate and arranged in 6 longitudinal series. The dorsal scales are smooth or keeled. Back with 2 to 6 longitudinal series of enlarged plate-like scales along the dorsal mid-line. This is the main difference to &quot;Latastia&quot;. Femoral pores are present on the inside of the thighs, more prominent in males. Tail base in males much broader than in females.

==Habitat and natural history==
The natural history of all species of &quot;Philochortus&quot; is only poorly known. Many of the species inhabit semiarid, arid or hyperarid regions, mountainous areas as well as plains from sea level up to altitude (&quot;P. neumanni)&quot;. Most species prefer sparsely vegetated, open and sandy or fairly rocky localities (&quot;P. neumanni)&quot; and can be found in &quot;Acacia&quot;-&quot;Commiphora&quot; deciduous bushland and semidesert bushland vegetation types. But &quot;P. zolii&quot; and &quot;P. neumanni&quot; can be found also in marginal unattended cultivated areas with &quot;Desmostachya bipinnata&quot; grass and other scrub and well vegetated natural habitats.

The species of &quot;Philochortus&quot; are diurnal, sun-loving active predators on insects and other arthropods, egg-laying and terrestrial but &quot;P. zolii&quot; is an avid climber. The long stiff tail is aiding in balance on vegetation. They dig burrows in the soil below clumps of grasses or small bushes.

==Species==
The following seven species are recognized as being valid.
*&quot;Philochortus hardeggeri&quot; – Hardegger&#x27;s orangetail lizard, Hardegger&#x27;s shield-backed lizard
*&quot;Philochortus intermedius&quot; – southern orangetail lizard, Boulenger&#x27;s shield-backed lizard
*&quot;Philochortus neumanni&quot; – Neumann&#x27;s orangetail lizard
*&quot;Philochortus phillipsi&quot; – Phillips&#x27;s shield-backed lizard
*&quot;Philochortus rudolfensis&quot; – southern shield-backed lizard
*&quot;Philochortus spinalis&quot; – Peters&#x27;s shield-backed lizard, Eritrea orangetail lizard 
*&quot;Philochortus zolii&quot; 

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Philochortus&quot;.

<doc id="343894" wikidata="Q221659" url="?curid=343894" title="Podarcis">
<text>Podarcis is a genus of lizards, known colloquially as wall lizards, in the family Lacertidae. Its members look very similar to lizards of the genus &quot;Lacerta&quot;, to which they were considered to belong until the 1970s. While similar externally and ecologically, &quot;Podarcis&quot; form a distinct group differing from &quot;Lacerta&quot; by the construction of the skull and the hemipenis, and by the processes of the caudal vertebrae. Wall lizards are native to Europe and northern Africa, and most species are restricted to the Mediterranean region. Wall lizards diversified and hybridized during the Messinian salinity crisis. The Italian wall lizard and the common wall lizard have been introduced to North America, where they have become intermediate hosts for some Acuariidae larvae.

==Species and subspecies==
The genus &quot;Podarcis&quot; contains the following 27 species which are recognized as being valid. A few of the many recognized subspecies are also listed here.
*Bocage&#x27;s wall lizard, &quot;Podarcis bocagei&quot; 
*Carbonell&#x27;s wall lizard, &quot;Podarcis carbonelli&quot; 
*Cretan wall lizard, &quot;Podarcis cretensis&quot; 
*Erhard&#x27;s wall lizard, &quot;Podarcis erhardii&quot;

<text>Poromera is a genus of lizard in the family Lacertidae. The genus &quot;Poromera&quot; is monotypic, containing the single species, Poromera fordii, commonly known as the West African striped lizard. The species is endemic to western Central Africa.

==Etymology==
&quot;Poromera&quot; is derived from the Greek words &quot;póros&quot; (πόρος) which means &quot;pore&quot; or &quot;duct&quot; and &quot;mērós&quot; (μηρός) which means &quot;thigh&quot;. &quot;Poromera&quot; refers to the long series of femoral pores on the thighs of this species.

The specific name, &quot;fordii&quot;, is in honor of Dr. Henry A. Ford, a medical missionary in Gabon, who collected specimens for the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences.

==Description==
The body of &quot;P. fordii&quot; is moderately or rather feebly depressed, the head feebly depressed. The head-shields are normal. The nostril is pierced between the nasal, two postnasals, and the first upper labial. The lower eyelid is scaly. The distinct collar contains 12-14 pointed, strongly keeled plates. The back is covered with large, platelike, subimbricate scales with strong keels forming 6 or 8 continuous lines, the sides with small juxtaposed scales. The ventral plates are pointed, imbricate, keeled and arranged in 8 (or 10) longitudinal and 22-27 transversal rows. Males have a large preanal plate which is bordered by a semicircle of pointed keeled scales, while in females the preanal region is covered with pointed keeled scales (sexual dimorphism). The digits are slightly compressed, with tubercular lamellae interiorly. The 10-15 femoral pores on each side form a long series and are more developed in males. The caudal scales are pointed and very strongly keeled. The tail is cylindrical and very long, 2 to 2.5 times as long as the head and body.

Snout-vent-length is up to ; total length is almost .

The ground colour of the body is dark olive above, often turning to bronze or copper-coloured posteriorly. Two light dorsal streaks, bright greenish or bluish white, sometimes edged with black anteriorly originate from the middle of the posterior border of the parietal shield. The streaks often disappear on the posterior part of the back. The back between the light streaks is sometimes blackish, which shade is continued as a stripe to the base of the tail. On the posterior back and tail base traces of a light vertebral streak are sometimes present in the young. The upper lip is bluish green. The tail is uniform brownish or reddish brown in the young, sometimes with a dorsal series of black spots. The lower parts of body are coloured greenish white in front and salmon-pink behind.

==Geographic range and habitat==
&quot;P. fordii&quot; is distributed in westerns parts of Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea (Fernando Po Island), Gabon and south to Democratic Republic of Congo (western Bas-Congo) from almost sea level up to altitude in Cameroon. It is a diurnal, semiarboreal forest species that can be found in flimsy, grassy and lower vegetation often near permanent streams.

==Reproduction==
The West African striped lizard presumably lays eggs.

==Diet==
The diet of &quot;P. fordii&quot; consists of insects and other arthropods.

<text>Pseuderemias is a genus of lizards of the family Lacertidae. Common names for the genus are false sand lizards or racerunners.

==Distribution==
Species of this genus are distributed from southeastern Egypt (Gebel Elba region) along coastal regions of the Red Sea in Sudan to Eritrea, eastern Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia and northern Kenya. The center of the diversification of this genus is Somalia.

==Diagnosis==
&quot;Pseuderemias&quot; are small to medium-sized dorso-laterally compressed lacertids with very narrow snouts. Each nostrils is surrounded by four nasal scales and is not reached by the first supralabial. The upper head shields are smooth, rugose or pitted. The eyes have movable lids. There is no vertebral series of enlarged scales down the middle of the back, the dorsal scales are roughly homogeneous. A collar is present. The ventral scales are smooth and arranged in six to ten longitudinal rows. The toes are strongly compressed and the subdigital lamellae are keeled. The tail is long, up to three times as long as head and body. Femoral pores are present.

The ground colour is greyish or light brown to brownish red, brick red, dark brown or almost black. On the back there are usually some creme or whitish stripes and/or dots which are arranged in longitudinal lines. Some species like &quot;P. erythrosticta&quot; lack stripes and are spotted with dark dots. Hatchlings are generally more intensely striped than adults.

==Habitat and natural history==
Only one species (&quot;P. mucronata&quot;) reaches north to Egypt and inhabits along the Red Sea coastal dunes and sandy plains with fairly good vegetation cover. Other species are distributed in low-lying, arid Somali-Masai &quot;Acacia&quot;-&quot;Commiphora&quot; deciduous bushland and semi-desert shrubland vegetation in eastern Africa.

Little is known of the natural history of &quot;Pseuderemias&quot; species. They are small diurnal, active, terrestrial lacertids that feed on small insects and other arthropods and lay eggs.

==Species==
Seven species are recognized.
*&quot;Pseuderemias brenneri&quot; – Brenner&#x27;s racerunner, Brenner&#x27;s sand racer
*&quot;Pseuderemias erythrosticta&quot; – Boulenger&#x27;s racerunner
*&quot;Pseuderemias mucronata&quot; – Sinai racerunner, Blanford&#x27;s sand racer
*&quot;Pseuderemias savagei&quot; (
*&quot;Pseuderemias septemstriata&quot; 
*&quot;Pseuderemias smithii&quot; – Smith&#x27;s racerunner, Smith&#x27;s sand racer
*&quot;Pseuderemias striatus&quot; – Peters&#x27;s sand lizard, Peters&#x27;s sand racer

<text>Takydromus is a genus of lizards, commonly called grass lizards or oriental racers. Species of the genus &quot;Takydromus&quot; are endemic to a large part of Asia. Members of this genus are noticeable because of their slender appearance and their agile movements. The word &quot;takydromus&quot; derives from Greek ταχυδρόμος (&quot;takhudromos&quot;), &quot;fast-running&quot;, from ταχύς (&quot;takhus&quot;), &quot;swift&quot; + δρόμος (&quot;dromos&quot;), &quot;course, race&quot;.

==Description==
Members of the genus &quot;Takydromus&quot; are extremely slender in appearance. The tail is about 2 to 5 times as long as the snout-vent length. The basic colour is normally brown, often with lateral stripes and dark spots. The dorsal scales are keeled and large. These keels form continuous longitudinal rows. The toes contain lamellae. The collar may be reduced or completely absent.

==Distribution and habitat==
The lizard genus &quot;Takydromus&quot; is found in Japan, in the Amur region of Russia, and throughout entire eastern Asia to Indonesia. These lizards are mainly terrestrial although some species can be found on trees. Some members of this genus are found both on rocks and in relatively damp forests. Other species inhabit open grasslands.

==Reproduction==
Females of species of &quot;Takydromus&quot; lay 1–10 eggs per clutch and up to 6 clutches per year.

==Species==
The genus &quot;Takydromus&quot; belongs to the lizard subfamily Lacertinae, tribe Lacertini, and contains the following species:
*&quot;Takydromus albomaculosus&quot; 
*&quot;Takydromus amurensis&quot; – Amur grass lizard
*&quot;Takydromus dorsalis&quot; – Sakishima grass lizard
*&quot;Takydromus formosanus&quot; – Formosa grass lizard 
*&quot;Takydromus hani&quot; – southeast Asian green grass lizard
*&quot;Takydromus haughtonianus&quot; – Goalpara grass lizard
*&quot;Takydromus hsuehshanensis&quot; 
*&quot;Takydromus intermedius&quot; 
*&quot;Takydromus khasiensis&quot; – Java grass lizard, Khasi Hills long-tailed lizard 
*&quot;Takydromus kuehnei&quot; 
*&quot;Takydromus luyeanus&quot; 
*&quot;Takydromus madaensis&quot; – Ma Da grass lizard
*&quot;Takydromus sauteri&quot; – Koshun grass lizard
*&quot;Takydromus septentrionalis&quot; – China grass lizard
*&quot;Takydromus sexlineatus&quot; – Asian grass lizard, six-striped long-tailed grass lizard, long-tailed grass lizard
*&quot;Takydromus sikkimensis&quot; – Sikkim grass lizard
*&quot;Takydromus smaragdinus&quot; – green grass lizard
*&quot;Takydromus stejnegeri&quot; 
*&quot;Takydromus sylvaticus&quot; – Chung-an ground lizard
*&quot;Takydromus tachydromoides&quot; – Japanese grass lizard
*&quot;Takydromus toyamai&quot; – Miyako grass lizard 
*&quot;Takydromus viridipunctatus&quot; 
*&quot;Takydromus wolteri&quot; – mountain grass lizard
*&quot;Takydromus yunkaiensis&quot; – Yunkai grass lizard

<text>The Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, or Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) for short, is an economic agreement between the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Central People&#x27;s Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, signed on 29 June 2003. A similar agreement, known as the Mainland and Macau Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, was signed between the Government of the Macau Special Administrative Region and the Central People&#x27;s Government on 18 October 2003.

Regular supplements have been signed between the Mainland and Hong Kong governments, including Supplement VIII (also referred to as CEPA VIII), which was signed on 13 December 2011 and implemented from 1 April 2012. The most recent supplement, Supplement X, was signed on 29 August 2013.

The two agreements and additional supplements were signed in the Chinese language; the Chinese text is therefore the authoritative text. The Hong Kong government generally provides a courtesy English translation, as English is one of the official languages of Hong Kong.

In the full name of &quot;CEPA&quot;, the &quot;Mainland&quot; refers to the customs territory of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

On October 9, 2024, the Ministry of Commerce of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government signed a revision of the CEPA Service Trade Agreement yesterday, further lowering or eliminating the entry threshold for Hong Kong service providers. At the same time, new arrangements such as &quot;Hong Kong Capital, Hong Kong Law&quot; and &quot;Hong Kong Capital, Hong Kong Arbitration&quot; were introduced in the pilot cities of the Greater Bay Area to facilitate Hong Kong investors. The revised agreement will officially take effect on March 1, 2025.

== Objectives ==
CEPA is a free trade agreement pursuant to which qualifying products, companies and residents of Hong Kong enjoy preferential access to the mainland Chinese market. Many of the preferences surpass the concessions made by China upon its accession to the World Trade Organization.

The CEPA document identifies the following objectives:

&quot;To strengthen trade and investment cooperation between Mainland China and Hong Kong and promote joint development of the two sides, through the implementation of the following measures:

# progressively reduce or eliminate tariffs and non-tariff barriers on substantially all the trade in goods between the two sides;
# progressively achieve liberalization of trade in services through reduction or elimination of substantially all discriminatory measures;
# promote trade and investment facilitation.&quot;

<text>Heloderma is a genus of toxicoferan lizards that contains five species, all of which are venomous. It is the only extant genus of the family Helodermatidae.

==Description==
The genus &quot;Heloderma&quot; contains the Gila monster (&quot;H. suspectum&quot;) and four species of beaded lizards. Their eyes are immobile and fixed in their heads. The Gila monster is a large, stocky, mostly slow-moving reptile that prefers arid deserts. Beaded lizards are seen to be more agile and seem to prefer more humid surroundings. The tails of all species of &quot;Heloderma&quot; are used as fat-storage organs. The scales of the head, back, and tail are bead-like, containing osteoderms for better protection. The scales of the belly are free from osteoderms. Most species are dark in color, with yellowish or pinkish markings.

==Venom==
The venom glands of &quot;Heloderma&quot; are located at the end of the lower jaws, unlike snakes&#x27; venom glands, which are located behind the eyes. Also, unlike snakes, the Gila monster and beaded lizards lack the musculature to inject venom immediately. They have to chew the venom into the flesh of a victim. &quot;Heloderma&quot; venom is used only in defense. Venom glands are believed to have evolved early in the lineage leading to the modern helodermatids, as their presence is indicated even in the 65-million-year-old fossil genus &quot;Paraderma&quot;. In general, one adult helodermatid has around 15 to 20 mg of venom, while the estimated lethal dose for humans is 5 to 8 mg.

Venom production among lizards was long thought to be unique to this genus, but researchers studying venom production have proposed many others also produce some venom, all placed in the clade Toxicofera, which includes all snakes and 13 other families of lizards. However, except for snakes, helodermatids, and possibly varanids, envenomation is not considered medically significant for humans.

==Diet==
Helodermatids are carnivorous, preying on rodents and other small mammals, and eating the eggs of birds and reptiles.

==Reproduction==
All species of &quot;Heloderma&quot; are oviparous. The Gila monster typically lays six eggs, and the beaded lizards up to about 18 eggs . Comparing the different species, all eggs have a similar size, as are their hatchlings.

==Taxonomy==

Family Helodermatidae

The four subspecies of beaded lizards were elevated to full species in 2013.


Members of the genus &quot;Heloderma&quot; have many extinct relatives in the Helodermatidae, whose evolutionary history may be traced back to the Cretaceous period, such as &quot;Estesia&quot;. The genus &quot;Heloderma&quot; has existed since the Miocene, when &quot;H. texana&quot; lived, and fragments of osteoderms from the Gila monster have been found in late Pleistocene (8,000-10,000 years ago) deposits near Las Vegas, Nevada. Because the helodermatids have remained relatively unchanged morphologically, they are occasionally regarded as living fossils. Although the beaded lizards and the Gila monster appear closely related to the monitor lizards (varanids) of Africa, Asia, and Australia, the wide geographical separation and unique features not found in the varanids indicate they are better placed in a separate family.

The type species is &quot;Heloderma horridum&quot;, which was first described in 1829 by Arend Wiegmann. Although he originally assigned it the generic name &quot;Trachyderma&quot;, he changed it to &quot;Heloderma&quot; six months later, which means &quot;studded skin&quot;, from the Ancient Greek words &quot;hêlos&quot; (ηλος)—the head of a nail or stud—and &quot;derma&quot; (δερμα), meaning skin.

Conrad, 2008 and Estes et al., 1988 (using morphological data) place the Helodermatidae within Varanoidea along with &quot;Lanthanotus borneensis&quot; and &quot;Varanus&quot;. However, Estes et al., 1988 understood the Helodermatidae as having split earlier from &quot;Lanthanotus&quot; and &quot;Varanus&quot;, whereas Conrad, 2008 groups them at the same branch point.

In contrast, molecular studies have identified &quot;Heloderma &quot;as being within the Anguioidea along with Anguidae and Xenosauridae, but specifically sister to Anguidae.

== In captivity ==

&quot;H. horridum&quot;, &quot;H. exasperatum&quot;, and &quot;H. suspectum&quot; are frequently found in captivity and are well represented in zoos throughout much of the world. The other two species of &quot;Heloderma&quot;, &quot;H. alvarezi&quot; and &quot;H. charlesbogerti&quot;, are extremely rare, and only a few captive specimens are known.

<doc id="343934" wikidata="Q5264355" url="?curid=343934" title="Design life">
<text>The design life of a component or product is the period of time during which the item is expected by its designers to work within its specified parameters; in other words, the life expectancy of the item. Engineers follow a theory to calculate the life expectancy from expected conditions, uses and physical properties. It is not always the actual length of time between placement into service of a single item and that item&#x27;s onset of wearout.

Another use of the term design life deals with consumer products. Many products employ design life as one factor of their differentiation from competing products and components. A disposable camera is designed to withstand a short life, whilst an expensive single-lens reflex camera may be expected to have a design life measured in years or decades.

==Long design lives==

Some products designed for heavy or demanding use are so well-made that they are retained and used well beyond their design life. Some public transport vehicles come into this category, as do a number of artificial satellites and spacecraft. In general, entry-level products—those at the lowest end of the price range fulfilling a certain specification—will tend to have shorter design lives than more expensive products fulfilling the same function, since there are savings to be made in using designs that are cheaper to implement, or, conversely, costs to be passed onto the customer in engineering to provide a safe margin leading to an increased working life. This economic truism leads to the phenomenon of products designed (or appearing to be designed) to last only so long as their warranty period.

==Obsolescence==
Design life is related to but distinct from the concept of planned obsolescence. The latter is the somewhat more nebulous notion that products are designed so as to become obsolete—at least in the eyes of the user—before the end of their design life. Two classic examples here are digital cameras, which become genuinely obsolete as a result of the very rapid rate of technological advances, although still in perfect working order; and non-digital cameras, which are perceived as obsolete after a year or so as they are no longer &quot;the latest design&quot; although actually capable of years of useful service.

<doc id="343939" wikidata="Q861619" url="?curid=343939" title="Education in Sweden">
<text>Education in Sweden is mandatory for children between ages 5/6 and 15/16 depending on when in the year they were born. The school year in Sweden runs from mid-late August to early/mid-June. The Christmas holiday from mid-December to early January divides the Swedish school year into two terms.

Preschool is free for all families. The year children turn six they start the compulsory preschool class (), which acts as a transition phase between preschool and comprehensive schools. Children between ages 5/6 and 15/16 attend comprehensive school where a wide range of subjects are studied. All students study the same subjects, with exception for different language choices. The majority of schools are run municipally, but there are also privately owned schools, known as independent schools.

Almost all students continue studying in three-year-long upper secondary schools where most students choose one out of 18 national programmes, some of which are vocational and some preparatory. For students not fulfilling the requirements for the national programmes, introductory programmes are available where students work to satisfy the requirements for the national programmes. In 2018, 16% of students finishing year 9 of comprehensive school were not eligible for national programmes.

The higher education system is compatible with the rest of Europe through the Bologna Process where degrees are divided into three cycles: basic level, advanced level and doctoral level. There are two degrees available in each cycle of different lengths. Universities have no tuition fees for Swedish citizens (as well for citizens of European Economic Area сountries), and student aid is available from the government.

==Diagram==
==History==
According to Lars Petterson, the number of students grew slowly, 1900–1947, then shot up rapidly in the 1950s, and declined after 1962. The pattern of birth rates was a major factor. In addition Petterson points to the opening up of the gymnasium from a limited upper social base to the general population based on talent. In addition he points to the role of central economic planning, the widespread emphasis on education as a producer of economic growth and the expansion of white collar jobs. During the nineteenth century, as demand for education increased, more women entered the teaching force in many Western countries, including Sweden. By 1900, 66 percent of Sweden&#x27;s teachers were women, many of whom worked in isolated rural areas.

===Primary school===

In 1842, the Swedish parliament enacted the first national school act for primary schooling. While it did not make schooling compulsory for children, it made it mandatory for parishes to establish at least one primary school (&quot;folkskola&quot;). These primary school provided a basic education, focusing on reading, writing, math and religious knowledge. During the latter half of the nineteenth century, an increasing number of children attended these schools, and by the turn of the century most children attended these schools. The amount and content of teaching remained varied, but with the national curriculum of 1919 (1919 års undervisningsplan) a stricter national framework was enacted. The &quot;folkskola&quot; remained the basis for the Swedish educational system until the introduction of the 9-year comprehensive school in 1962.

The 1962 curriculum included two different study paths, vocational and preparatory; this was however abolished in the 1969 revision. In 1980 came another major revision increasing the emphasis on theoretical subjects. In 1994 the grading system was changed and in the latest revision from 2011 the grading system was changed yet again, this time also introducing grades from year 6.

===Secondary school===
In 1905 was introduced for students wanting to continue studying after &quot;.&quot; It had varying length between three and six years.

In 1968 was introduced with a similar structure to the current version. There were 22 different programmes, some of which were vocational and some preparatory. These programmes lasted between two and four years, something that was changed in 1991, making all programmes three years long.

== Preschool ==
Preschool is offered to all children whose parents are working, studying, unemployed or on parental leave from the age of one. From the age of three, all children are eligible for at least three hours of preschool education every day for free. Fees for children being at preschool for more than three hours a day or under three years of age are based on family income and number of children. Prices range from free to a maximum of 1 425 SEK (€135 or US$150) per month with exact rates set by the municipality.

It is intended to free up parents to work, establishing a foundation for children going into comprehensive schooling and promote fundamental values such as the equal value of all people. This is achieved through pedagogical activities prepared by preschool teachers often involving things such as play, singing and drawing. The preschool teachers should incorporate multiple educational moments each day.

== Comprehensive school ==
The educational system in Sweden is based on a nine-year long comprehensive school (), with mandatory attendance between six–seven and fifteen–sixteen years of age.

=== Subjects ===
In the Swedish compulsory school each student takes 16 compulsory subjects which are, sorted by time allocated: Swedish, mathematics, physical education, English, handicrafts, music, visual arts, technology, physics, chemistry, biology, history, social studies, religion, geography and home economics. All of these subjects are taken in all three school stages, lower stage (grades 1–3), middle stage (grade 4–6), and upper stage (grades 7–9).

In sixth grade students can also choose a non-compulsory foreign language course. Over 85% of grade 9 students studied a third language in 2017. All schools have to offer the three languages Spanish, French, and German. Many schools also offer additional help in the core subjects English and Swedish instead of the language course. Taking the language course can improve the students&#x27; final grade significantly and can be required for some more competitive upper secondary schools.

There is also a compulsory, non-graded student&#x27;s choice subject () where the student can choose from various activities facilitated by the school. Students&#x27; choice has been criticized for potentially being a bad use of the students&#x27; and teachers&#x27; time.

===Grading===
In Sweden students start receiving grades from year 6 with proposals of changing it to year 4. Before grade 6 students receive an Individual Development Plan (, IUP) containing the teachers&#x27; assessment of the students&#x27; knowledge. Students have regular development talks with their teachers discussing how to improve based on their IUP and grades.

The grading system in compulsory school uses the grades A, B, C, D, and E as passing grades and F as failing. B and D work as filling grades, for when a student has not reached all objectives for C or A but has reached most of them. If the student cannot be graded, e.g. due to extensive truancy, the student will receive a dash instead of an F. A dash is not considered a grade. If a student is on the verge of receiving an F in a certain subject or course, the teacher responsible for that subject will notify the student and the student&#x27;s parents. If a student is given an F, they will receive a written review of how to improve themselves.

The pupil&#x27;s total score, which is used for application to upper secondary schools, is calculated by taking the pupil&#x27;s subject grades and numerically adding them together, with the following letter to number conversion: E = 10, D = 12.5, C = 15, B = 17.5, and A = 20. This yields a maximum possible score of 340 for students taking 17 subjects. Pupils can have either 16 or 17 grades depending on if they take an additional language course on top of the 16 compulsory subjects. Pupils who do not study a foreign language or instead study extra Swedish or English will only have 16 grades and cannot receive a score higher than 320.

The sixteen subjects used to calculate the total must include the three core subjects – English, Swedish, and mathematics. If the pupil fails any of the core subjects, they lack qualification to attend secondary school. However, the student can still attend the secondary school introduction program (), either to gain competence in the core subjects and start a secondary school programme or gain skills to enter employment.

=== National tests ===
In grades 3, 6 and 9 national tests are administered to all students in the Swedish grundskola. The primary aim of these tests are to ensure all students are assessed equivalently. The test results should be given special consideration by teachers when setting the students final grade.

In grade 3 the tests are framed around a story involving two children encountering mathematics and Swedish in everyday situations to make the test situation less intimidating. Only Swedish and mathematics have national tests in year 3. The results from the tests are not used for grading, as students do not receive grades before year 6.

In grade 6 and 9 there are tests for all three core subjects, Swedish, mathematics and English. These tests consist of both oral and written components. In grade 9 one science subject (physics, biology or chemistry) and one social science subject (civics, religion, geography or history) are tested as well.

The National Agency for Education also provide tests similar to the national tests for the purpose of assisting teachers with assessing students. These are sometimes confused for national tests; however, these tests are not mandatory and available for a greater variety of year levels and subjects.

The tests and mark schemes have been spread on the internet before the test date several times, resulting in widespread cheating. In these cases, substitute tests are to be used; however, these tests have been accused of not giving results consistent with the non-substitute tests by the Swedish Teachers&#x27; Union and cannot be used in Statistics Sweden&#x27;s reports. The Swedish National Audit Office published a report regarding &quot;the unauthorised dissemination of national tests&quot; in 2018. The audit found the Swedish National Agency for Education&#x27;s new guidelines for handling the national tests satisfactory, but implemented too late. The report recommended the Swedish School Inspectorate to monitor individual schools&#x27; compliance with these new guidelines.

=== Violence guidelines ===
In 2014, the National Agency for Education published guidelines to staff on how to act during incidents of armed violence. In the 2012–2017 period, the number of reports of physical violence in schools increased 129% and reports of threats increased by 46% in the same period according to the Swedish Work Environment Authority. The latter reports include all reported physical violence and threats, not only armed violence.

=== Other types of primary education ===
There are various types of primary education including Sámi schools, with special accommodations for the indigenous Sámi people, special needs schools for students with intellectual disabilities, and special schools for students with other disabilities such as deafness.

There is also komvux, adult education at the primary or secondary level, and introductory programmes for students who have failed compulsory education. Homeschooling is only permitted for students who for some reason, usually severe sickness, cannot participate in normal classroom education.

==Upper secondary education==
Upper secondary school, called &quot;gymnasieskola&quot;, usually lasts for three years. It is elective, but with a 99% enrollment rate. It is divided into 18 different national programmes with different educational focus. The system is course-based with the same courses being used for multiple programmes. There are also introductory programmes for students who do not satisfy the requirements for the national programmes. A significant number of these students are immigrants learning Swedish.

=== National programmes ===
The national programmes are divided into two categories: preparatory and vocational. All national programmes give basic qualification to attend university, but preparatory programs typically also satisfy the additional requirements needed to study university courses in specific subject areas.

In 2018 approximately one third of students studying a national programme were studying a vocational programme, while two thirds were studying a preparatory programme.
=== Courses ===
All students take at least 2500 points worth of courses. Some of these courses are universal for students in all programmes. These courses are the Level 1 courses in each of the following subjects: English, Swedish, mathematics, religion, civics, natural science and physical education. In preparatory programmes additional English, Swedish and mathematics are also included as core courses.

There are also programme-specific and orientation-specific courses. Orientation-specific courses are the courses that a student elects to take by selecting an orientation within their programme. Finally, individually selected courses are courses that the student freely selects for themselves.

=== Diploma project ===
In all programs in upper secondary school, all students are required to do a diploma project. The diploma project is a project where the students are required to plan, execute and reflect on a bigger project related to something they have been studying. This project has two grading options, which is receiving an E (pass) or F (fail). The diploma project is not included in the students&#x27; merit value that is used towards further education.

=== Eligibility ===
To be eligible for upper secondary education, the pupil needs to pass 8 of the subjects for the vocational programmes and 12 for preparatory programmes. Of those 8 or 12, 3 must be the subjects mathematics, Swedish and English. For the social science programme, the subjects of geography, social studies, history, and religion must be included among the 12 passed subjects. For the natural science programme, the natural science subjects must be included.

In 2018, 15.6% of pupils who left compulsory education did not qualify to proceed to upper secondary education. This is a significant increase from 2011, the first year with the current syllabus, where 12.3% of pupils did not qualify. The group not mastering compulsory education is predominantly boys and pupils with foreign origin.

Pupils who did not qualify for upper secondary education can still proceed to an introductory programme () which helps students gain eligibility for the national programmes.

===Admittance===
The prospective student applies to attend a certain program at a certain school, competing for entrance based upon his or her elementary school grades. In a few cases, such as the arts program () at certain schools, the student applies for both the program and the orientation. Some programmes, generally the arts programmes and certain more specialized programmes or orientations, have some form of entrance exam in addition to the elementary school grades.

=== Introductory programmes ===
Introductory programmes are for students who did not qualify for the national programmes, most often by failing Swedish, English or mathematics. There are different types of introductory programmes, the most common of which being language introduction for immigrants learning Swedish and individual alternative, a highly individualized programme intended to help students who did not satisfy the eligibility requirements for the national programmes gain eligibility.

==Higher education==

After upper secondary school, students can apply to university in order to receive tertiary education. General academic degrees are offered by public universities and university colleges that tend to attract students on a regional basis. Besides general academic degrees, the higher education system also provides a number of professional degrees at a bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s level in fields such as engineering, law and medicine. Independently from the Bologna Process-compatible university system, there is a system of higher vocational education where subject areas such as business finance and administration, IT, and hospitality and tourism are taught.
=== Types of degrees ===
Swedish degrees are incorporated in the Bologna Process, the European higher education framework. In this system degrees are divided into three cycles, corresponding to bachelor&#x27;s level, master&#x27;s level and doctoral level. In Sweden, there are two general qualifications for each cycle of different lengths and various professional degrees and various professional degrees at bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s level.

==== Diagram ====
==== Basic level () ====
To be admitted to a programme at the basic level, a student must complete an education at the level or its equivalent. The degrees that can be obtained at the basic level are:

* Higher Education Diploma (), two years, 120 higher education credits
* Degree of Bachelor (), three years, 180 higher education credits

====Advanced level ()====
To be admitted to a programme at the advanced level, a student must have obtained a three-year Swedish degree at the basic level or a corresponding degree from another country or some corresponding qualification. The degrees that can be obtained at the advanced level are:

* Degree of Master (one year) (), one year, 60 higher education credits
* Degree of Master (two years) (), two years, 120 higher education credits

Both degrees require completing a thesis.

The Degree of Master (two years) is a new degree that is intended to be closely linked to continuing education at the graduate level.

====Doctoral level ()====
To be admitted to a programme at the doctoral level, a student must have obtained a Swedish degree at the advanced level or completed at least four years of full-time study with at least one year at the advanced level or a corresponding degree from another country or equivalent knowledge. The degrees that can be obtained at the doctoral level are:

* Degree of Licentiate (), two years, 120 higher education credits
* Degree of Doctor (PhD, ), four years, 240 higher education credits

Postgraduate academic titles are associate professor () and professor.

===Grading===

The grading system used vary between different universities and university colleges. There are currently five different systems in use, all of which are criteria-referenced. The three most common systems are the seven-grade scale (A–F, Fx), the three-grade scale VG, G, U which is very similar to the pre-2011 compulsory and upper secondary grade system, and the pass or fail system G/U. The grades from all systems can be converted to the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) for grade comparison with other universities across Europe.

===Language requirements===
Before being accepted to a higher education programme in Sweden, all applicants must demonstrate a minimum proficiency in Swedish and English. For international applicants, the Test in Swedish for University Studies is used to test Swedish language proficiency and Test of English as a Foreign Language or the Cambridge First Certificate in English exam may be used for English.

=== SweSAT ===
The Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test () is a standardised test used as one of the means to gain admission to higher education in Sweden. The test itself is divided into a mathematical section and a verbal section, which both contain four subdivisions, for a total of 160 multiple-choice questions. Apart from the English language reading comprehension test, all sections are taken in Swedish. To gain admittance to courses or programmes using the SweSAT, students need to independently fulfill the eligibility requirements.

===Student aid===
Swedish students receive help from the National Board of Student Aid (CSN) while studying. CSN is a Swedish governmental authority which issues financial aid for studies. This includes loans and grants for students studying in Sweden or abroad.

As of autumn semester 2011, higher education is free of charge only for Swedish, EU/EEA, and Swiss citizens.

===Anti discrimination work===
All universities are required to have guidelines on how to handle cases of discrimination. They are also required to work together with the equality ombudsman to ensure admission, tuition and examinations are fair.

=== Higher vocational education ===
Post-secondary vocational education usually consists of many one- to two-year-long subject specific programmes consisting of roughly three quarters theoretical work and one quarter workplace experience. Higher vocational schools cooperate with various employers to improve the students&#x27; employment prospects. The system is independent from the other types of higher education in that it is not Bologna compatible, does not award a bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s degree (while professional degrees do) and is not taught by universities or university colleges.

==Independent schools==
Prior to the 1990s, there were only a handful of private schools in Sweden, mostly tuition-funded boarding schools, of which Sigtunaskolan and Lundsbergs skola are the most well known. A major education reform in 1992 allowed privately run schools offering primary or secondary education to receive public funding for each student at a level similar to what public schools receive. These are called independent schools of free schools (), and there were around 900 of them.

The independent schools, similar to charter schools in the United States or academies in the United Kingdom, are funded with public money () from the local municipality based on the number of pupils they have enrolled, in the same way Swedish public schools are. Consequently, they are not allowed to discriminate or require admission examinations, nor are they allowed to charge the students any additional fees. They are, however, allowed to accept private donations. Regional economic differences directly affect how much money each municipality can provide per pupil.

Anyone can start an independent for-profit school, or a chain of such schools, in Sweden. Many of them offer an alternate pedagogy (such as Montessori), or a foreign/international, religious or special needs (such as hearing-impaired) profile. There are also several secondary schools with an elite sports profile. Internationella Engelska Skolan and Kunskapsskolan are the two largest independent school chains. In 2008, more than 10% of Swedish pupils were enrolled independent schools.

In 2023, Minister for Schools Lotta Edholm launched an investigation into friskolor, after calling into question its profit-making model. In recent years there had been a drop in educational standards with inequality rising. 15% of primary pupils (up to 16-year-old) and 30% of all upper school pupils went to friskolor. One major issue was the claim that some friskolor awarded pupils grades that were too high, distorting the grading system.

===Opinions===
The independent school system has divided public opinion in Sweden, especially regarding religious schools and for-profit schools. During the 2018 election several parties, including the Moderate Party and Social Democratic Party, suggested some kind of profit limit, while the Liberals and Centre Party opposed such a limit. A ban on religious independent schools has also been suggested with support from the Left Party and Social Democratic Party, while the Moderates, Green Party, Christian Democrats and Centre party are satisfied with the current system banning religious elements in the classroom, but allowing them during breaks or before lessons start.

The Swedish model has been put forward as a possible model for similar solutions in both the United Kingdom and the United States, where Per Unckel, County Governor of Stockholm and former Conservative Minister of Education, in 2009 summarized the advantages of the Swedish system in an opinion piece produced by the Libertarian think tank Pacific Research Institute: &quot;Education is so important that you can’t just leave it to one producer. Because we know from monopoly systems that they do not fulfill all wishes&quot;.

In February 2013, &quot;The Guardian&quot; published an article by a former political advisor to the Swedish Ministry of Education, Karin Svanborg-Sjövall, on the independent school system: &quot;Sweden proves that private profit improves services and influences policy. Even education unions came on board when private provision was introduced into Swedish schools&quot;, citing the paper on average educational performance produced by research institute under the Swedish Ministry of Employment, IFAU, which found &quot;that an increase in the share of independent-school students improves average performance at the end of compulsory school as well as long-run educational outcomes&quot;. However, in June 2015, another article by the education correspondent from &quot;The Guardian&quot; quoted then Education Minister, Gustav Fridolin, as saying that the system was &quot;a political failure&quot; and stated that standards in learning had dropped dramatically over the years and were in a state of &quot;crisis&quot;.

==PISA and PIRLS results==
Sweden came in first in the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund 2008 ranking of early childhood education.

Swedish results in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) were in 2015 close to the OECD average. Swedish scores had declined between 2006 and 2012, which was heavily reported and adopted as an important talking point for many political parties, including the Alliance and the Social Democratic Party.

In the 2015 PISA report, Swedish scores increased for the first time since the programme started in 2006. Both the Moderate Party and the Social Democratic Party have suggested actions to improve education and increase PISA scores in the future.

Sweden’s performance in the international fourth-grade reading assessments (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study, PIRLS) dropped by 19 points from 2001 (561) to 2011 (542) and recovered by 13 points in 2016 (555).

The influx of immigrants to Swedish schools has been reported as a major contributor to why Sweden&#x27;s score dropped more than any other European country by a National Agency of Education report.

However, this does not account for the entirety of the drop in results. In the spring of 2021, the nationwide newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot; published a series of articles describing major flaws in the testing carried out by the National Agency for Education. A comparatively large number and range of students had, in violation of the intention of the tests, been exempted from testing, generating a result showing a positive trend. An investigation into how this could have happened despite several officials at the Ministry for Education having raised questions concerning the testing methods is taking place. Some MPs have called for the resignation of the Minister for Education, who in turn has directed the liability for testing towards the school authority.

<doc id="343940" wikidata="Q1462173" url="?curid=343940" title="Alfred-Maurice de Zayas">
<text>Alfred-Maurice de Zayas (born 31 May 1947) is a Cuban-born American lawyer and writer, active in the field of human rights and international law. From 1 May 2012 to 30 April 2018, he served as the first UN Independent Expert on the Promotion of a Democratic and Equitable International Order, appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council.

==Early life and education==
De Zayas was born in Havana, Cuba and grew up in Chicago, Illinois (US). He earned his &quot;juris doctor&quot; degree from Harvard Law School, then a doctorate of philosophy in modern history from the University of Göttingen (Germany).

He was a Fulbright Fellow at the University of Tübingen in Germany and research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law in Heidelberg, Germany. He worked with the United Nations from 1981 to 2003 as a senior lawyer with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Chief of Petitions. 
Since 1996, de Zayas has been married to Carolina Jolanda Edelenbos, a Dutch national and UN official, with whom he had a son, Stefan (deceased).

==Scholarly work==

De Zayas&#x27; work focuses &quot;inter alia&quot; on the judicial protection of peoples and minorities. He has written and lectured extensively on human rights, including the jurisprudence of the United Nations Human Rights Committee, the Armenian genocide, the Holocaust,&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1017/S0165070X11100066&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the US-run detention centers at Guantanamo Bay, ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, the expulsion of Eastern European Germans after the Second World War, the invasion of Cyprus by Turkey in 1974, the rights of minorities, the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the rights of indigenous peoples. 

In 1994, he co-authored with Prof. Cherif Bassiouni, &quot;The Protection of Human Rights in the Administration of Criminal Justice&quot;, published by Transnational Publishers.

De Zayas, in collaboration with Justice Jakob Möller, authored the book &quot;United Nations Human Rights Committee Case Law 1977-2008&quot; (2009), published by N. P. Engel Verlag. The first Chairman of the Human Rights Committee, Andreas Mavrommatis, wrote a preface for the handbook. In a review published in the &quot;UN Special&quot; magazine, former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Bertrand Ramcharan wrote: &quot;It is staggering how much the Human Rights Committee has influenced the human rights jurisprudence of the world, as is striking from reading this exceedingly important book... From the outset of its work in 1977 there have been two Secretariat pioneers in developing the case law of the Committee when it considers petitions from individuals claiming violations of their rights: Jakob Möller (Iceland) and Alfred de Zayas (USA). Möller was the first Chief of the Petitions branch of what is today the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and de Zayas was his colleague, who eventually succeeded him as Chief.&quot;

De Zayas has written scholarly articles that were published in the &quot;Harvard International Law Journal&quot;, the &quot;UBC Law Review&quot;, the &quot;International Review of the Red Cross&quot;, the &quot;Criminal Law Forum&quot;, the &quot;Refugee Survey Quarterly&quot;, the &quot;Netherlands International Law Review&quot;, The &quot;International Commission of Jurists Review&quot;, the &quot;Historical Journal&quot;, &quot;Politique internationale&quot;, the &quot;German Yearbook of International Law&quot;, &quot;Canadian Human Rights Yearbook&quot; and the &quot;East European Quarterly&quot;.

He has co-authored and co-edited books such as &quot;The International Human Rights Monitoring Mechanisms&quot;. De Zayas has published chapters in books &quot;Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe&quot; co-edited by Steven Várdy and Hunt Tooley. In &quot;International Humanitarian Law: Origins&quot;, edited by John Carey, de Zayas wrote the chapter &quot;Ethnic Cleansing, Applicable Norms, Emerging Jurisprudence, Implementable Remedies&quot;. His chapter in Spanish &quot;El crimen contra la paz&quot; was published in the book &quot;La Declaración de Luarca sobre el Derecho Humano a la Paz&quot;, edited by Carmen Rosa Rueda Castañón and Carlos Villán Durán.

===On the 1944–50 expulsion of Germans===
De Zayas&#x27; work into the expulsion of Germans from areas of eastern Germany and Eastern Europe at the end of World War II is extensive. De Zayas was reportedly the first American historian to address this topic. &quot;Deutsche Welle&quot; reported in 2007: &quot;He wrote the first scholarly work on German expellees to appear in English, breaking what had long been a taboo topic.&quot; The German Federal Minister Heinrich Windelen wrote in the foreword to de Zayas&#x27;s book &quot;Anmerkungen zur Vertreibung&quot;: &quot;It is thanks to De Zayas that the debate on The Expulsion has been reopened [...] In the subsequent period, a number of authors have drawn on the work of De Zayas. Thus, he has contributed significantly to the fact that discussion of The Expulsion is no longer considered taboo.&quot; According to a doctoral thesis on the historiography of the expulsion, &quot;de Zayas was one of the earliest &#x27;respectable&#x27; academics to take up the cause of the expellees... De Zayas does not mention the Holocaust, the Jews, or any other minority ethnic groups that suffered under the Nazis except in passing.&quot; However, Professor Doerr in the &quot;Dalhousie Review&quot; notes: &quot;De Zayas does not ignore the enormity of the crimes committed by Germans during the course of the war, nor does he deny that an anti-German feeling was natural and that punishment was justified, He does, however, question whether one set of crimes justified a second... whether revenge ... was not only extended to the guilty but to the innocent, whether expulsion itself was a crime ...While critical of western leadership, de Zayas leaves no doubt about the agents of the crime-- the Soviet leaders. ...Praised must be de Zayas&#x27;s reopening of this largely neglected aspect of modern German history.&quot; The 1999 University of Hertfordshire doctoral dissertation of Robert Bard, &quot;Historical Memory of the expulsion of ethnic Germans in Europe 1944–1947&quot;, cites de Zayas 58 times and comments approvingly on the historical analysis of &quot;Nemesis at Potsdam&quot; and &quot;A Terrible Revenge&quot;. He observes: &quot;De Zayas&#x27; senior position with the UN Human Rights Commission, his position as a United States citizen (not a German) and his indisputable humanitarian credentials meant that de Zayas&#x27; work was taken seriously in Germany and America.&quot;

In 1975, de Zayas published a study in the &quot;Harvard International Law Journal&quot;, questioning the legality of the expulsion of possibly as many as 15 million Germans from their homes after World War II, invoking the Atlantic Charter, the Hague Conventions, and the Nuremberg Principles.

====&quot;Nemesis at Potsdam&quot;====
The article was followed by his first book &quot;Nemesis at Potsdam&quot; (Routledge und Kegan Paul, 1977) which focused on what, if any, responsibility the British and U.S. governments had for decisions which purportedly led to the expulsions of these ethnic Germans. The book had a preface by Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s political advisor, Robert Daniel Murphy, a participant at the Potsdam conference.

British historian Tony Howarth reviewed it in the &quot;Times Educational Supplement&quot; as &quot;a lucid, scholarly and compassionate study&quot;. Nuremberg prosecutor Ben Ferencz wrote in the &quot;American Journal of International Law&quot; that it was &quot;a persuasive commentary on the suffering which becomes inevitable when humanitarianism is subordinated to nationalism&quot;. The &quot;New Statesman&quot; reviewer stated: &quot;in his well researched, closely reasoned work, de Zayas leaves little doubt that there have been few historical parallels to this record of modern mass atrocity&quot;.

In the same year, an enlarged German edition was published by the legal publisher C.H. Beck, becoming a bestseller.

====&quot;The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau&quot;====
His second book (written with Walter Rabus), &quot;The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau&quot;, was published in Germany by Universitas/, in 1979, and the English translation by de Zayas himself by the University of Nebraska Press in 1989. The book describes some of the work of the &quot;Wehrmacht-Untersuchungsstelle&quot;, a special section of the legal department of the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot;, which investigated Allied and German war crimes. The authors argue that the Bureau carefully investigated war crimes and was largely free of Nazi ideology. De Zayas worked with the 226 extant volumes (about half of the total, the rest apparently having been burned in Langensalza, Germany, near the end of the war.). The book was savagely attacked in the media of the Soviet Union and its satellites.

In a review of the book in the &quot;Cambridge Law Journal&quot;, Professor of International Law at the University of Cambridge and judge at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) Christopher Greenwood considered the book to be &quot;excellent&quot; and that &quot;the authors deserve the gratitude of all those interested in the laws of war but unable to read German for bringing out an English edition.&quot; He goes on to add that &quot;Throughout the book the authors emphasize that all the cases they examined have to be seen against the background of the Holocaust and the atrocities committed by the German armed forces and SS.&quot;

In the &quot;Fletcher Forum&quot;, Alfred Rubin stated that &quot;De Zayas is undoubtedly one of the world&#x27;s leading legal scholars addressing forced population transfers ... [his] work provides massive confirmation of the truism that atrocities are committed in war by all sides, that many go unpunished, and some are part of national policy...the possibility that truth might be misused in argument by the devil is not a reason to suppress truth. I have no personal doubt that this book is a useful attempt to preserve an important truth. By writing it, the author – whose own humanitarian sympathies are beyond question, as is Levie&#x27;s scholarly detachment --has done a service to scholarship.&quot; Dieter Fleck, in &quot;Archiv des Voelkerrechts&quot;, underlined that &quot;this well-written book is based on thorough research of original sources.&quot; The British novelist Philip Kerr took the WUSt functionaries as subject of his novel &quot;A Man without Breath&quot;, published 2013 by Penguin; in the &quot;Author&#x27;s note&quot; (p. 463) Kerr writes: &quot;The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau continued to exist until 1945. Anyone who wishes to know more about its work should consult the excellent book of the same name by Alfred de Zayas.&quot;

In the &quot;Historical Journal&quot; (Cambridge), vol. 35, 1992, de Zayas published a detailed analysis of the working methods of The Wehrmacht Bureau on War Crimes. The &quot;FAZ&quot; favourably reviewed the article: &quot;Following careful study of the records, cross-checking in foreign archives and more than three hundred interviews with surviving witnesses and military judges, de Zayas arrives at the conclusion that the investigations are reliable.&quot; The International Committee of the Red Cross has republished parts of &quot;The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau&quot; in its teaching manual &quot;How does Law Protect in War&quot;, edited by Marco Sassoli and Antoine Bouvier.

====&quot;A Terrible Revenge&quot;====
His third book was &quot;A Terrible Revenge, The Ethnic Cleansing of the East European Germans, 1944–1950&quot;, published in Germany in 1986, and in the United States in 1993 by Palgrave Macmillan under the title &quot;The German Expellees&quot;. According to PhD candidate Robert Bard, this book &quot;was, as [de Zayas] says, written &#x27;to generate interest in this hitherto ignored tragedy [the German ethnic expulsions] and lead to a new respect for these forgotten victims and to more compassion and understanding for our neighbours.&#x27; De Zayas in his introduction states that the book originated in a 1981 &#x27;prime-time television broadcast in Germany&#x27; which dealt with the expulsions, and in which he took part.&quot;

The book was described as &quot;problematic&quot; by historians Konrad Jarausch and Michael Geyer. Historians Dan Diner and Joel Golb write that the tendency of &quot;allow[ing] the Germans to perceive themselves also as victims&quot; is &quot;manifest in the work of the best-selling author Alfred-Maurice de Zayas&quot;. Nottingham Trent University Bill Niven writes that de Zayas is &quot;often cited in support of the comparability thesis&quot;, i.e. the argument that crimes committed by Germany during the war were equivalent to crimes committed against it. A review in the scholarly journal &quot;Central European History&quot; describes it as having a &quot;distinctively revisionist flavour&quot;.

By contrast, Andreas Hillgruber wrote in the &quot;Historische Zeitschrift&quot;: &quot; His succinct and incisive recounting of the events are summarized in ten historical and six international law theses, that precisely because of their lucidity and balance deserve a permanent place in the historiography of the expulsions.&quot; Gotthold Rhode wrote in the &quot;FAZ&quot;: &quot;de Zayas lets the victims themselves tell their story, providing reports that were hitherto unknown... the book has the character of a new &#x27;Documentation on the Expulsions&#x27; and contains descriptions of cruelties and suffering that four decades after the events boggle the mind.&quot; Henry Stanhome in the London &quot;Times&quot; wrote: &quot;De Zayas&#x27;s moving plea is that one&#x27;s home should be a human right. As frontiers once more shift in Eastern Europe and families flee in Bosnia, he could hardly have chosen a better moment to deliver it.&quot; (18 November 1993) &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;: &quot;This relatively unknown holocaust claimed more than two million lives...De Zayas... has uncovered testimony in German and American archives detailing these atrocities, adding a new chapter to the annals of human cruelty. His carefully documented book serves as a reminder that many different peoples have been subjected to &#x27;ethnic cleansing&#x27;&quot;. (July 1994). Twenty years later Matthias Stickler reviewed a revised edition in the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;: &quot;Es vermittelt anschaulich, gut lesbar, quellenorientiert und ohne Polemik Grundwissen zu einem nach wie vor wichtigen Thema&quot; (&quot;the book imparts knowledge on a still very relevant topic vividly, in straightforward language, based on reliable sources and without polemics).&quot; Historian Ernest Fisher reviewed it in the United States Army magazine &quot;Army&quot;: &quot;The author has given the history of these expulsions a dramatic immediacy through a series of eyewitness accounts ... The remarkable sequel to this recital of inhumanity is that this displaced population has, in the 50 years since the war, managed to find a new home in a reunited Germany where nearly 20 percent of the population is made up of first- or second-generation descendants of these exiled millions.&quot; De Zayas&#x27; book &quot;Nemesis at Potsdam&quot; likewise received a positive review in the &quot;Neue Zürcher Zeitung&quot; by historian Patrick Sutter.

====&quot;Genocide as State Secret&quot;====
His 2011 book &quot;Völkermord als Staatsgeheimnis&quot; (&quot;Genocide as State Secret&quot;) with a substantive preface by Karl Doehring, Director of the Max Planck Institute for International Law in Heidelberg, explored the issue of who knew what when about the Holocaust. He is the first historian to have reviewed the issue in the light of published and unpublished Nuremberg documents, and in the light of interviews with Nuremberg prosecutors and defense attorneys, Holocaust survivors as well as German military judges and politicians. He argued that the policy of exterminating the Jews was &quot;geheime Reichssache&quot; (secret Reich business), and treated pursuant to Hitler&#x27;s Order Nr. 1 (Führerbefehl Nr. 1) as a &quot;state secret&quot;. Accordingly, although there were diffuse rumors about killings, no one except a very limited number of persons knew exactly what was going on, neither the industrialization of the killing nor the number of victims.

German historian Martin Moll wrote that de Zayas&#x27; book ignored the fact that in other research, scholars have found convincing evidence that knowledge of murders was partial but present. Overall, he found the book to be &quot;a hard-to-read, confusing, poorly argued book that lags far behind the differentiated state of research represented primarily by [Peter] Longerich&quot;.

The review by Bernward Dörner in the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; described it as an &quot;attempt to deny contemporary perceptions of genocide&quot;, while the French-German Historian Alfred Grosser strongly criticized the Dörner review as political and &quot;completely one-sided&quot;, accusing the reviewer of ideological bias and unhistorical approach. Grosser cited the reviewer&#x27;s own words on &quot;strategy&quot;: &quot;The question of contemporary perception of the Holocaust is of strategic importance. Because if it had actually been the case that the genocide could have remained secret, this would severely limit the shared responsibility of the German population in the genocide.&quot; In other words, as the title of Grosser&#x27;s article implies (&quot;the return of collective guilt&quot;), it is a question of instrumentalizing guilt for political purposes, and Zayas was not playing the game.

The journal of the Institute on the Holocaust and Genocide in Jerusalem, &quot;Genocide Prevention Now&quot;, observed in its review: &quot;As the footnotes abundantly manifest, de Zayas is keenly aware of the secondary literature in the field. He takes issue with some of the conclusions of historians like Goldhagen, Gellately, Longerich and Bankier, and tends to agree with the analysis of Michael Marrus, Gordon Craig, Peter Hoffmann and Hans Mommsen. But while he carefully considers the opinions of other scholars, he does not rehash what is already in the secondary literature – he takes a fresh look at the evidence, poses new questions – and proposes possible answers, avoiding guessing and extrapolation. He places the evidence in historical context, avoiding the anachronisms that some historians indulge in.&quot;

== Activism ==

De Zayas was co-president, with Jacqueline Berenstein-Wavre, of the Association Suisses et Internationaux de Genève (ASIG) from 1996 to 2006.

Since the 1990s, de Zayas has also focused on the genocides against the Armenians, Greeks of Pontus and Assyro-Chaldeans under the Ottoman Empire before, during, and after the First World War. He advocates the creation of a Constitutional Convention for Cyprus and published a proposal for this together with Malcolm Shaw and Andreas Auer. He has argued for the recognition of &quot;the human right to peace&quot;.

In 2018 de Zayas sent a Memorandum to Gary W. B. Chang, Jeannette H. Castagnetti, and Members of the Judiciary for the State of Hawaii, speaking out against the continued prolonged U.S. occupation of The Hawaiian Kingdom.

He has called for a peaceful solution to the dispute between India and Pakistan in accordance with pertinent UN resolutions and the right of self-determination of the Kashmiris.

He has advocated the rights of many minorities and indigenous peoples to autonomy and self-determination in United Nations fora and before parliamentarians in the European Parliament, including the Armenians of Nagorno Karabagh, the Sahrawi population of Western Sahara, the Tamils of Sri Lanka, the Bubis of Equatorial Guinea, the Catalans of Spain, and the Igbos and Ogonis of Nigeria. de Zayas is an advocate of reviewing certain decolonization issues in the light of the UN Charter and General Assembly resolutions. In particular, he has criticized the Spanish amalgamation of the distinct Bubi people of Bioko Island with the people of another Spanish colony, Equatorial Guinea.
Since his early retirement from the UN in 2003, de Zayas has been a vocal critic of the 2003 Iraq War He has criticised indefinite detention in Guantanamo, secret CIA prisons, and extreme poverty.

In 2015, he sparked a condemnation from UN Watch for saying the November 2015 Paris attacks were caused by the United States, Western colonialism, capitalism, and &quot;Israeli settlers&quot; and &quot;a response to grave injustices and ongoing abuses perpetrated by the dominant, primarily developed countries, against populations of less developed countries&quot;.

On 29 September 2017, de Zayas, and another UN independent commissioner, David Kaye, issued a statement saying that the Spanish government was &quot;violating fundamental individual rights, limiting the flow of public information at such a critical moment for the Spanish democracy&quot; during the 2017 Catalan independence referendum. According to Spanish newspaper Okdiario, Catalan President Carles Puigdemont paid de Zayas €100 000 to support the Catalan independence process.

De Zayas is a registered Republican voter, although he supported Bernie Sanders in 2016, and Tulsi Gabbard (via write-in) in 2020. Writing in 2018 in the Canadian magazine &quot;Humanist Perspectives&quot;, he warned about the growing radicalism of the Antifa movement in Germany, reminiscent of the Nazi SA of the 1930s: &quot;A new wave of totalitarianism is sweeping through Germany with the collusion of the mainstream media, which ... seldom criticize Antifa&quot; and downplay their anti-democratic violence. On several occasions de Zayas has been invited as an expert before German courts and before the Rechtsausschuss (legal committee) of the German Bundestag, invited by the CDU/CSU.

He joined the board of trustees of the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD)&#x27;s &quot;Desiderius Erasmus Foundation&quot; think tank in 2018. In 2019, he spoke before the Menschenrechtsausschuss (Human Rights Committee) of the Bundestag, in March on the issue of humanitarian aid and in September on the issue of impunity. On this occasion De Zayas was invited as an expert by the AfD to speak on multilateralism in the 21st century, a lecture which he gave in the aula maxima of the University of Tuebingen in May 2019.

==United Nations Independent Expert==
De Zayas was appointed as &quot;Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order&quot; by the U.N. Human Rights Council at its 19th Session, which concluded on 23 March 2012.

He presented his first report to the UN Human Rights Council at its 21st session in September 2012, calling for uniform application of international law. On 10 September 2013, he presented his second report to the Human Rights Council A/HRC/24/38, and, in October 2013 his second report to the GA . A/68/284, to the UN General Assembly exploring initiatives and enforcement mechanisms to further advance a democratic and equitable international order, in particular through a World Parliamentary Assembly.
On 10 September 2014, de Zayas presented his third report on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order to the Human Rights Council. During its 27th session in September 2014, the Human Rights Council extended his mandate through 2018 pursuant to resolution A/HRC/RES/27/9.

On 27 October 2014, he presented his third report to the General Assembly on the right to self-determination (A/69/272) In the press release issued the following day, he stated: &quot;The realization of the right of self-determination is essential to maintaining local, regional and international peace and must be seen as an important conflict-prevention strategy.&quot;

On 10 September 2015, he presented his fourth report to the council on the adverse human rights impacts of free trade and investment agreements on a democratic and equitable international order, and on 26 October 2015 to the General Assembly on the issue of investor state dispute settlement. The main observations of these reports were reported by news outlets such as Reuters, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, and &quot;The Independent&quot;. In 2015, the US based magazine of global politics, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, consulted with the UN Independent Expert on the application of the right to self-determination in the Indonesian region of West Papua.

During his mandate, he addressed multiple contemporary world issues, welcoming the Arms Trade Treaty and urging States to regulate not only trade but also production of arms.
In 2015, following a press release, de Zayas urged trade negotiators to address the Doha Round commitments to promote equal and fair trade at the Tenth Ministerial Conference in Nairobi, Kenya.&quot;The Guardian&quot; published his op-ed on adverse human rights impacts of free trade and investment agreements.

In the following year, the UN Independent Expert on the Promotion of a Democratic and Equitable International Order submitted his report on the adverse impact of World Bank policies on human rights and the realisation of a democratic and equitable international order to the UN Human Rights Council. On 21 July 2017, de Zayas presented his last report to the UN General Assembly on the human rights impact of IMF policies and practice. The report was sent to the UN Human Rights Council on 25 January 2018. On 15 March 2018, he formulated his 23 principles of international order.

In 2017, a 1982 photo of de Zayas in blackface which he had posted on his website was described as &quot;racist and offensive&quot; by UN Watch.

On 25 February 2018, The UN Independent Expert issued a memorandum that states: &quot;I have come to understand that the lawful political status of the Hawaiian Islands is that of a sovereign nation-state in continuity; but a nation state that is under a strange form of occupation by the United States resulting from an illegal military occupation and fraudulent annexation. As such, international laws (The Hague and Geneva Conventions) require that governance and legal matters within the occupied territory of the Hawaiian Islands must be administered by the application of laws by the occupied state (in this case, the Hawaiian Kingdom) not the domestic laws of the occupier (the United States).&quot;

===Report on Venezuela===

In late 2017 de Zayas visited Venezuela. In a February 2018 interview with Telesur, de Zayas, said &quot;I’ve compared the statistics of Venezuela with those of other countries and there’s no humanitarian crisis&quot;. He said that Venezuela&#x27;s economic problems were caused by the &quot;economic war&quot; and &quot;economic sanctions placed by the U.S., Canada and the European Union&quot;. De Zayas&#x27; report, published in August 2018, found internal overdependence on oil, poor governance and corruption had damaged the Venezuelan economy, but that &quot;economic warfare&quot; was a major factor in the crisis. He recommended economic sanctions be investigated by the International Criminal Court as possible crimes against humanity under Article 7 of the Rome Statute. The report was received positively by the Venezuelan government.

More than eighty Venezuelan organizations questioned de Zayas&#x27; conclusions that there was not a humanitarian crisis in the country. In a public statement, the organizations said that before finishing his mission in Venezuela and without having processed the information provided by the organizations, de Zayas formed an opinion prematurely and assumed the government&#x27;s point of view, which blames the &quot;economic warfare&quot; and &quot;blockade&quot; for the food and medical supplies shortages. The organizations said that in two years, among twenty two experts from twelve international organizations, de Zayas&#x27; report was the only one to say there was no humanitarian crisis in the country. Alí Daniels, director of the NGO &quot;Acceso a la Justicia&quot; (Access to Justice), said that Venezuelan and Ecuadorian organizations said that, since the mission was not prepared according to independence standards of the United Nations, it could not reach valid or acceptable conclusions for the UN Human Rights Council. Daniels argued that this lack of balance was demonstrated in Zayas&#x27; report, where twelve pages are dedicated to Venezuela and only two and a half to Ecuador.

During the 167th session of the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights, during a discussion of health and nutrition in Venezuela, the Venezuelan state representative screened an interview by state broadcaster Telesur with de Zayas, in which he stated there was not a humanitarian crisis in the country. Nutrition expert Susana Raffalli, advisor to PROVEA and Caritas Organization of Venezuela, said de Zayas used poor evidence to support his claim, and that by then four United Nations rapporteurs had already declared that there was a &quot;grave&quot; situation in the country. Raffali said that de Zayas was only one out of forty rapporteurs, and that during his visit to the country and after meeting with civil society organizations, de Zayas only took pictures of the counter of the charcuterie in front of his hotel.

==Literary works==

Apart from his scholarly work in the fields of history and law, de Zayas has published poetry in English, French, German, Spanish, and Dutch, has translated the poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke into English, French, and Spanish, and has translated works by Joseph von Eichendorff Zayas has published many anti-war poems, including &quot;Beatitudes&quot; in Sam Hamill&#x27;s &quot;Poets Against the War&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse&quot; and &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;, published in Esoteric Magazine, &quot;Panem et circensis&quot; published in Esoteric Magazine.&quot;Manichaean games&quot;, published in Ex Tempore.

As a member of the International Rainer Maria Rilke Society of Sierre, Switzerland, de Zayas published the first English-language translation of Rilke&#x27;s &quot;Larenopfer&quot;, 90 poems dedicated to Rilke&#x27;s homeland of Bohemia and his home city of Prague Zayas has lectured on Rilke in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Canada. On 2 May 2011, he delivered a lecture at the Salon du Livre de Genève (Geneva bookfair) on &quot;Rilke, poète de la Heimat&quot;

<doc id="343947" wikidata="Q7295524" url="?curid=343947" title="Rate My Professors">
<text>Rate My Professors (RMP) is a review site founded in May 1999 by John Swapceinski, a software engineer from Menlo Park, California, which allows anyone to assign ratings to professors and campuses of American, Canadian, and United Kingdom institutions. The site was originally launched as TeacherRatings.com and converted to RateMyProfessors in 2001. RMP was acquired in 2005 by Patrick Nagle and William DeSantis. Nagle and DeSantis later resold RMP in 2007 to Viacom&#x27;s MTVU, MTV&#x27;s College channel. Viacom owned and operated RateMyProfessors.com for a decade. Cheddar announced its acquisition of RMP from Viacom in 2018. Cheddar was acquired by internet service provider Altice USA in 2019. Cheddar was then sold to media company Archetype in December 2023. RMP is the largest online destination for professor ratings. The site includes 8,000+ schools, 1.7 million professors, and over 19 million ratings.

== Ratings and reviews ==
On RMP, users may post a rating and review of any professor that is already listed on the site. Furthermore, users may create a listing for any individual not already listed. To be posted, a rater must rate the course and/or professor on a 1-5 scale in the following categories: &quot;overall quality&quot; and &quot;level of difficulty&quot;. The rater may also share if he or she would take the professor again, if the class was taken for credit, if attendance was mandatory, if the textbook was used, and what grade he or she received in the course; additionally, the rater may include comments of up to 350 characters in length. Since the website does not require users to create an account, non-students or even professors themselves can post ratings. Raters may also select up to 3 tags (from a list of 20) that describe the professor.

According to the website&#x27;s help page, &quot;a professor’s Overall Quality rating should reflect how well a professor teaches the course material, and how helpful he/she is both inside and outside of the classroom&quot;. The professor&#x27;s Overall Quality rating determines whether his/her name is accompanied by a smiley face (meaning &quot;Good Quality&quot;), a frowny face (&quot;Poor Quality&quot;), or an in-between, expressionless face (&quot;Average Quality&quot;).

== Correlation with in-class student evaluations ==

Using data for 426 instructors at the University of Maine, [researchers] examined the relationship between RMP indices and formal in-class student evaluations of teaching (SET). This study found that the two primary RMP indices correlated weakly with their respective SET items. First, RMP &quot;overall quality&quot; showed a correlation of only r = .68 with SET item &quot;Overall, how would you rate the instructor?&quot; Second, RMP &quot;ease&quot; showed a correlation of r = .44 with SET item &quot;How did the work load for this course compare to that of others of equal credit?&quot; Further, RMP &quot;overall quality&quot; (r = .57) and RMP &quot;ease&quot; (r = .51) were each correlated with its corresponding SET factor derived from a principal components analysis of all 29 SET items. The researchers concluded &quot;While these RMP/SET correlations should give pause to those who are inclined to dismiss RMP indices as meaningless, the amount of variance left unexplained in SET criteria limits the utility of RMP.&quot; Formal in-class evaluations can only be completed by students who are registered in the course, whereas on RMP, anyone can post ratings, whether or not they have taken the course.

== Criticism ==

===Stanford Law School and Reputation Protection===
Two Stanford law professors argue that a legal framework for protecting online platform reputation should be responsive to the
changing set of practices ushered in by the Internet and capable of resolving conflicts in a fair and satisfactory way. In light of recent failed lawsuits against online content providers, the professors advocate for &quot;a new regime requiring such platforms to formulate an appropriate information policy providing transparency rules, including disclosing how aggregate evaluations are made and providing for a right to respond, to achieve a new body of communication “netiquette” for social evaluation in the online era.&quot;

===No guarantee of authenticity of users&#x27; student-status===

As RMP does not require users to create accounts or log in before posting, there is no guarantee that the reviews are actually posted by students who have taken the course. Professors who research controversial political subjects, particularly female professors and professors of color, often face harassment on RMP, when people who dislike their political opinions or scholarship can post abusive reviews by pretending to be students. For example, the RMP page of Rutgers University professor Audrey Truschke, a historian of Islamic India, is routinely used by those critical of her to post demeaning and degrading reviews calling for her dismissal by Rutgers.

===Positive correlation between ease of class and rating of professor===
Research on in-class evaluations shows that professor ratings increase when students rate the course as easy. The same relationship has been shown for RMP. In an article in the journal Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education, Clayson investigated what RMP actually rates and concluded that &quot;students will give higher evaluations to instructors they judge as being
easy. There is also a suggestion in these findings that, if students like an instructor (for whatever reason), then the easiness of the class becomes relatively irrelevant.&quot;. Clayson concluded that &quot;the majority of the evidence indicates that [ratemyprofessors.com] is biassed by a halo effect, and creates what most accurately could be called a &#x27;likeability&#x27; scale.&quot; Other analyses of RMP class ratings have come to similar conclusions, and some have concluded that professor attractiveness is also positively correlated with evaluation scores on RMP. Felton et al. evaluated RMP ratings and found that &quot;the hotter and easier professors are, the more likely they’ll get rated as a good teacher.&quot;

===Evaluation bias issues===

A frequent criticism of RMP is that there is little reason to think that the ratings accurately reflect the quality of the professors rated. Another criticism is that ratings have been shown to reflect gender bias toward the professors evaluated. Furthermore, at RMP, &quot;easiness&quot;, &quot;clarity&quot;, and &quot;helpfulness&quot; are the only components taken into consideration and are not considered well-designed evaluations. Edward Nuhfer argues that both Pickaprof.com and RMP &quot;are transparently obvious in their advocacy that describes a &#x27;good teacher&#x27; as an easy grader. Additionally, presenter Phil Abrami ... rated RMP as &#x27;The worst evaluation I&#x27;ve seen&#x27; during a panel discussion on student evaluations at the 2005 annual AERA meeting.&quot;

===Multiple ratings per person===

Single individuals are able to make multiple separate ratings of a single professor on RMP. RMP admits that while it does not allow such multiple ratings from any one IP address, it has no control over raters who use several different computers, or those that &quot;spoof&quot; IP addresses. Also, there is no way of knowing that those who rate a professor&#x27;s course have actually taken the course in question, making it possible for professors to rate themselves and each other.

===Rating relevancy===

Critics stated that a number of the ratings focus on qualities they see as irrelevant to teaching, such as physical appearance. In late June 2018, several academics criticized the website&#x27;s &quot;hotness&quot; score for contributing to sexism in academia. On 28 June, RateMyProfessors responded that while the feature was intended to &quot;reflect a dynamic/exciting teaching style,&quot; it was often misused; the hotness rating was removed immediately.
RateMyProfessors lets the student identify the course that they took with the professor and combines the ratings for all courses taught by the professor instead of providing separate ratings averages for each course taught.

===Permanent vs adjunct faculty===

Adjunct faculty are not always readily identifiable or verifiable, as such professors may work at multiple universities, change universities frequently, or maintain employment outside an academic setting.

== Data breach ==
On January 11, 2016, RMP notified its users via email (and with a small notification link on its website) that a decommissioned version of RMP&#x27;s website suffered a data breach affecting email addresses, passwords, and registration dates. According to the California Department of Justice website, the security breach occurred six weeks earlier on or about November 26, 2015.

== Website features ==

===Professor Notes===

After mtvU took over the website, a notes feature was added that allows professors to register with the website (using a &quot;.edu&quot; e-mail address) in order to reply to students&#x27; comments. Another option, called &quot;Professors Strike Back&quot;, featured videos of professors responding to their ratings on RMP. Additionally, in 2015, the site debuted a new series &quot;Professors Read Their Ratings&quot; in which professors read and react to their RMP ratings. Students may also submit videos to RMP.

== Recognition ==
In 2008 RMP was recognized by &quot;Time Magazine&quot; as one of the 50 best websites of 2008.

In 2008, student evaluations of Professors from RMP accounted for 25% of a school&#x27;s rating in Forbes annual &quot;America&#x27;s Best Colleges&quot; listing. However, this is no longer true.

In 2015, the site won two People&#x27;s Choice Webby Awards after an extensive site overhaul.

== Competitors ==
The rating company has a variety of competitors. RateMyTeachers, a similar teacher rating forum was launched by Patrick Nagle in 2001.

<text>The Indian Army (ISO: ) is the land-based branch and largest component of the Indian Armed Forces. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army, and its professional head is the Chief of Army Staff (COAS). The Indian Army was established on 1 April 1895 alongside the long established presidency armies of the East India Company, which too were absorbed into it in 1903. Some princely states maintained their own armies which formed the Imperial Service Troops which, along with the Indian Army formed the land component of the Armed Forces of the Crown of India, responsible for the defence of the Indian Empire. The Imperial Service Troops were merged into the Indian Army after independence. The units and regiments of the Indian Army have diverse histories and have participated in several battles and campaigns around the world, earning many battle and theatre honours before and after Independence.

The primary mission of the Indian Army is to ensure national security and national unity, to defend the nation from external aggression and internal threats, and to maintain peace and security within its borders. It conducts humanitarian rescue operations during natural calamities and other disturbances, such as Operation Surya Hope, and can also be requisitioned by the government to cope with internal threats. It is a major component of national power, alongside the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force. The independent Indian army has been involved in four wars with neighbouring Pakistan and one with China. Other major operations undertaken by the army include Operation Vijay, Operation Meghdoot, and Operation Cactus. The army has conducted large peacetime exercises such as Operation Brasstacks and Exercise Shoorveer, and it has also been an active participant in numerous United Nations peacekeeping missions. The Indian Army was a major force in the First and Second World Wars, particularly in the Western Front and the Middle Eastern theatre during World War I, and the South-East Asian Theatre and the East African and North African campaigns during World War II.

The Indian Army is operationally and geographically divided into seven commands, with the basic field formation being a division. The army is an all-volunteer force and comprises more than 80% of the country&#x27;s active defence personnel. It is the largest standing army in the world, with 1,237,117 active troops and 960,000 reserve troops. The army has embarked on an infantry modernisation program known as Futuristic Infantry Soldier As a System (F-INSAS), and is also upgrading and acquiring new assets for its armoured, artillery, and aviation branches.

== History ==
Until the independence of India, the &quot;Indian Army&quot; was a British-commanded force defined as &quot;the force recruited locally and permanently based in India, together with its expatriate British officers&quot;; the &quot;British Army in India&quot; referred to British Army units posted to India for a tour of duty. The &quot;Army of India&quot; meant the combined Indian Army and the British Army in India.

=== Background ===


In 1776, a Military Department was created within the government of the East India Company at Calcutta. Its main function was to record orders that were issued to the army by various departments of the East India Company for the territories under its control.

With the Charter Act 1833, the Secretariat of the government of the East India Company was reorganised into four departments, including a Military Department. The army in the presidencies of Bengal, Bombay and Madras functioned as respective Presidency Armies until 1 April 1895, when they were unified into a single force known as the Indian Army. For administrative convenience, it was divided into four commands, namely Punjab (including the North West Frontier), Bengal, Madras (including Burma), and Bombay (including Sind, Quetta and Aden).

The Indian Army was a critical force for maintaining the primacy of the British Empire, both in India and throughout the world. Besides maintaining internal security, the Army fought in many other theatres: Third Anglo-Afghan war; the Boxer Rebellion in China; in Abyssinia and in the First and Second World Wars.

=== World wars ===


The Kitchener Reforms brought the British Army to a new century. In the 20th century, the Indian Army was a crucial adjunct to the forces of the British Empire in both world wars. 1.3 million Indian soldiers served in World War I (1914–1918) with the Allies, in which 74,187 Indian troops were killed or missing in action. In 1915 there was a mutiny by Indian soldiers in Singapore. The United Kingdom made promises of self-governance to the Indian National Congress in return for its support but reneged on them after the war, following which the Indian Independence movement gained strength.

The &quot;Indianisation&quot; of the Indian Army began with the formation of the Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College at Dehradun, in March 1912, to provide education to the scions of aristocratic and well-to-do Indian families and to prepare selected Indian boys for admission into the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Cadets were given a King&#x27;s commission, after passing out, and were posted to one of the eight units selected for Indianisation. Because of the slow pace of Indianisation, with just 69 officers being commissioned between 1918 and 1932, political pressure was applied, leading to the formation of the Indian Military Academy in 1932 and greater numbers of officers of Indian origin being commissioned. On the eve of World War II, the officer corps consisted of roughly 500 Indians holding regular commissions against approximately 3,000 British officers.

In World War II Indian soldiers fought alongside the Allies. In 1939, British officials had no plan for expansion and training of Indian forces, which comprised about 130,000 men (in addition there were 44,000 men in British units in India in 1939), whose mission was internal security and defence against a possible Soviet threat through Afghanistan. As the war progressed, the size and role of the Indian Army expanded dramatically, and troops were sent to battlefronts as soon as possible. The most serious problem was the lack of equipment. Indian units served in Burma, wherein 1944–45, five Indian divisions were engaged along with one British and three African divisions. Even larger numbers operated in the Middle East. Some 87,000 Indian soldiers died in the war. By the end of the war, it had become the largest volunteer army in history, rising to over 2.5 million men in August 1945.

In the African and Middle East campaigns, captured Indian troops were given a choice to join the German Army, to eventually &quot;liberate&quot; India from Britain, instead of being sent to POW camps. These men, along with Indian students who were in Germany when the war broke out, made up what was called the Free India Legion. They were originally intended as pathfinders for German forces in Asia but were soon sent to help guard the Atlantic Wall. Few who were part of the Free India Legion ever saw any combat, and very few were ever stationed outside Europe. At its height, the Free India Legion had over 3,000 troops in its ranks.

Indian POWs also joined the Indian National Army, which was allied with the Empire of Japan. It was raised by a former colonel of the Indian Army, General Mohan Singh, but was later led by Subhas Chandra Bose and Rash Bihari Bose. With the fall of Singapore in 1942, about 40,000 Indian soldiers were captured. When given the choice, over 30,000 joined the Indian National Army. Those who refused became POWs and were mostly shipped to New Guinea. After initial success, this army was defeated, along with the Japanese; but it had a huge impact on the Indian independence movement.

=== Indian independence ===
Upon the Partition of India and Indian independence in 1947, four of the ten Gurkha regiments were transferred to the British Army. The rest of the Indian Army was divided between the newly created Union of India and the Dominion of Pakistan. The Punjab Boundary Force, which had been formed to help police Punjab during the partition period, was disbanded. Headquarters Delhi and the East Punjab Command were formed to administer the area.

The departure of virtually all senior British officers following independence, and their replacement by Indian officers, meant many of the latter held acting ranks several ranks above their substantive ones. For instance, S. M. Shrinagesh, the ground-forces commander of Indian forces during the first Indo-Pak War of 1947–49 (and the future third COAS), was first an acting major-general and then an acting lieutenant-general during the conflict while holding the substantive rank of major, and only received a substantive promotion to lieutenant-colonel in August 1949. Gopal Gurunath Bewoor, the future ninth COAS, was an acting colonel at his promotion to substantive major from substantive captain in 1949, while future Lieutenant General K. P. Candeth was an acting brigadier (substantive captain) at the same time. In April 1948, the former Viceroy&#x27;s Commissioned Officers (VCO) were re-designated Junior Commissioned Officers, while the former King&#x27;s Commissioned Indian Officers (KCIO) and Indian Commissioned Officers (ICO), along with the former Indian Other Ranks (IOR), were respectively re-designated as Officers and Other Ranks.

Army Day is celebrated on 15 January every year in India, in recognition of Lieutenant General K. M. Cariappa&#x27;s taking over as the first &quot;Indian&quot; Chief of the Army Staff and Commander-in-Chief, Indian Army from General Sir Roy Bucher, on 15 January 1949. With effect from 26 January 1950, the date India became a republic, all active-duty Indian Army officers formerly holding the King&#x27;s Commission were recommissioned and confirmed in their substantive ranks.

=== Conflicts and operations ===
==== First Kashmir War (1947) ====
Immediately after independence, tensions between India and Pakistan erupted into the first of three full-scale wars between the two nations over the then princely state of Kashmir. The Maharaja of Kashmir wanted to have a standstill position. Since Kashmir was a Muslim majority state, Pakistan wanted to make Kashmir a Pakistani territory. As a result, Pakistan invaded Kashmir on 22 October 1947, causing Maharaja Hari Singh to look to India, specifically to Lord Mountbatten of Burma, the governor-general, for help. He signed the Instrument of Accession to India on 26 October 1947. Indian troops were airlifted to Srinagar from dawn on 27 October. This contingent included General Thimayya who distinguished himself in the operation and in the years that followed became a Chief of the Indian Army. An intense war was waged across the state and former comrades found themselves fighting each other. Pakistan suffered significant losses. Its forces were stopped on the line formed which is now called the Line of Control (LOC).

An uneasy peace, sponsored by the UN, returned by the end of 1948, with Indian and Pakistani soldiers facing each other across the Line of Control, which has since divided Indian-held Kashmir from that part held by Pakistan. Several UN Security Council resolutions were passed, with Resolution 47 calling for a plebiscite to be held in Kashmir to determine accession to India or Pakistan, only after Pakistan withdrew its army from Kashmir. A precondition to the resolution was for Pakistan and India to return to a state of &quot;as was&quot; before the conflict. Pakistan would withdraw all tribesmen and Pakistani nationals brought in to fight in Kashmir. Pakistan refused to pull back, and there could be no further dialogue on fulfilling the UN resolution. Tensions between India and Pakistan, largely over Kashmir, have never been eliminated.

==== Annexation of Hyderabad (1948) ====

After the partition of India, Hyderabad State, a princely state under the rule of the Nizam of Hyderabad, chose to remain independent. The ensuing stand-off between the Government of India and the Nizam ended on 12 September 1948, when India&#x27;s then Deputy Prime Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ordered Indian troops to secure Hyderabad State. During five days of fighting, the Indian Army, backed by an Indian Air Force squadron of Hawker Tempest aircraft, routed the Hyderabad State forces. Five Indian Army infantry battalions and one armoured squadron were engaged in the operation. The following day, Hyderabad was proclaimed part of India. Major General Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri, who led the operation, and accepted the surrender of the Nizam&#x27;s forces on 18 September 1948, was appointed the military governor of Hyderabad, to restore law and order, and served until 1949.

==== Assistance during the Korean War (1950–1953) ====
During the Korean War, although deciding against sending combat forces, India sent its 60th Parachute Field Ambulance unit to aid the UN troops fighting against the North Korean invasion of South Korea, as part of the 1st Commonwealth Division. In the aftermath of the war, an Indian infantry brigade formed the Custodian Force of India, some of whose soldiers were also part of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which assisted in the exchange of prisoners of war and was headed by Lieutenant General K. S. Thimayya.

==== Annexation of Goa, Daman and Diu (1961) ====
Even though the British and French vacated all their colonial possessions in the Indian subcontinent, Portugal refused to relinquish control of its colonies of Goa, Daman, and Diu. After repeated attempts by India to negotiate were spurned by Portuguese prime minister and dictator, António de Oliveira Salazar, on 12 December 1961 India launched Operation Vijay to capture the Portuguese colonies, which was accomplished by small contingents of Indian troops. After a brief conflict that lasted twenty-six hours—during which 31 Portuguese soldiers were killed, the Portuguese Navy frigate NRP Afonso de Albuquerque was destroyed, and over 3,000 Portuguese were captured—Portuguese General Manuel António Vassalo e Silva surrendered to Major General Kunhiraman Palat Kandoth of the Indian Army. Goa, Daman, and Diu became a part of the Republic of India.

==== Sino-Indian War (1962) ====

The cause of this war was a dispute over the sovereignty of the widely separated Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh border regions. Aksai Chin, claimed by India as part of Kashmir, and by China as part of Xinjiang, contains an important road link that connects the Chinese regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. China&#x27;s construction of this road was one of the triggers of the conflict.

Small-scale clashes between Indian and Chinese forces broke out as India insisted on the disputed McMahon Line being regarded as the international border between the two countries. Chinese troops claimed not to have retaliated to the cross-border firing by Indian troops, despite sustaining losses. China&#x27;s suspicion of India&#x27;s involvement in Tibet created more rifts between the two countries.

In 1962, the Indian Army was ordered to move to the Thag La ridge, located near the border between Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh and about north of the disputed McMahon Line. Meanwhile, Chinese troops had also made incursions into Indian-held territory, and tensions between the two reached a new high when Indian forces discovered the road constructed by China in Aksai Chin. After a series of failed negotiations, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army attacked Indian Army positions on the Thag La ridge. This move by China caught India by surprise, and on 12 October Nehru gave orders for the Chinese to be expelled from Aksai Chin. However, poor coordination among various divisions of the Indian Army, and the late decision to mobilise the Indian Air Force in vast numbers, gave China a crucial tactical and strategic advantage over India. On 20 October, Chinese soldiers attacked India from both the northwest and northeast; and captured large portions of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh.

As the fighting moved beyond disputed territories, China called on the Indian government to negotiate; however, India remained determined to regain lost territory. With no agreement in sight, China unilaterally withdrew its forces from Arunachal Pradesh. The reasons for the withdrawal are disputed, with India claiming various logistical problems for China and diplomatic support from the United States, while China stated that it still held territory it had staked a claim on. The dividing line between the Indian and Chinese forces was named the Line of Actual Control.

The poor decisions made by India&#x27;s military commanders, and the political leadership, raised several questions. The Henderson-Brooks and Bhagat committee was soon set up by the government of India to determine the causes of the poor performance of the Indian Army. Its report criticised the decision not to allow the Indian Air Force to target Chinese transport lines, out of fear of a Chinese aerial counterattack on Indian civilian areas. Much of the blame was placed on the then–defence minister, Krishna Menon, who resigned from his post soon after the war ended. Despite frequent calls for its release, the Henderson-Brooks report remains classified. Neville Maxwell has written an account of the war.

==== Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 ====
A second confrontation with Pakistan took place in 1965. Although the war is described as inconclusive, India had the better of the war and was the clear winner in tactical and strategic terms. Pakistani president Ayub Khan launched Operation Gibraltar in August 1965, during which Pakistani paramilitary troops infiltrated into Indian-administered Kashmir and attempted to ignite anti-India agitation in Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistani leaders believed that India, which was still recovering from the Sino-Indian War, would be unable to deal with a military thrust and a Kashmiri rebellion. India reacted swiftly and launched a counter-offensive against Pakistan. In reply, on 1 September Pakistan launched Operation Grand Slam, invading India&#x27;s Chamb-Jaurian sector. In retaliation, the Indian Army launched a major offensive all along its border with Pakistan, with Lahore as its prime target.

Initially, the Indian Army met with considerable success in the northern sector. After launching prolonged artillery barrages against Pakistan, India was able to capture three important mountain positions in Kashmir. By 9 September, the Indian Army had made considerable inroads into Pakistan. India had its largest haul of Pakistani tanks when an offensive by Pakistan&#x27;s 1st Armoured Division was blunted at the Battle of Asal Uttar, which took place on 10 September near Khemkaran. The biggest tank battle of the war was the Battle of Chawinda, the largest tank battle in history after World War II. Pakistan&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Asal Uttar hastened the end of the conflict.

At the time of the ceasefire declaration, India reported casualties of about 3,000. On the other hand, it was estimated that more than 3,800 Pakistani soldiers were killed in the conflict. About 200–300 Pakistani tanks were either destroyed or captured by India. India lost a total of 150-190 tanks during the conflict. The decision to return to pre-war positions, following the Tashkent Declaration, caused an outcry in New Delhi. It was widely believed that India&#x27;s decision to accept the ceasefire was due to political factors, not military, since it was facing considerable pressure from the United States and the United Nations to cease hostilities.

==== 1967 Sino-Indian conflict ====
The 1967 Sino-Indian skirmish, also known as the Cho La incident, was a military conflict between Indian troops and members of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army who, on 1 October 1967, invaded Sikkim, which was then a protectorate of India. On 10 October, both sides clashed again. Defence minister Sardar Swaran Singh assured the Indian people that the government was taking care of developments along the border. Indian losses were 88 killed, and 163 wounded, while Chinese casualties were 300 killed and 450 wounded in Nathula, and 40 in Chola. The Chinese Army left Sikkim after this defeat.

==== Operation against the Naxalites during 1971 ====

Under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, during the president&#x27;s rule in 1971, the Indian Army and the Indian police launched Operation Steeplechase, a gigantic &quot;counter-insurgency&quot; operation against the Naxalites, which resulted in the death of hundreds of Naxalites and the imprisonment of more than 20,000 suspects and cadres, including senior leaders. The army was also assisted by a brigade of para commandos and the Indian paramilitary. The operation was organised in October 1969, and Lieutenant General J.F.R. Jacob was told by Govind Narain, the Home Secretary, that &quot;there should be no publicity and no records&quot;. Jacob&#x27;s request to be presented with written orders was also refused by the then Army Chief Sam Manekshaw.

==== Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 ====

An independence movement broke out in East Pakistan which was crushed by Pakistani forces. Due to large-scale atrocities committed against them, thousands of Bengalis took refuge in neighbouring India causing a major refugee crisis there. In early 1971, India declared its full support for the Bengali freedom fighters, known as Mukti Bahini, and Indian agents were extensively involved in covert operations to aid them.

On 20 November 1971, the Indian Army moved 14 Punjab Battalion of the 45th Cavalry regiment, into Garibpur, a strategically important town in East Pakistan, near India&#x27;s border, and successfully captured it. The following day, more clashes took place between Indian and Pakistani forces. Wary of India&#x27;s growing involvement in the Bengali rebellion, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) launched a preemptive strike on 10 Indian air bases—at Srinagar, Jammu, Pathankot, Amritsar, Agra, Adampur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Uttarlai, and Sirsa—at 17:45 hours on 3 December. However, this aerial offensive failed to accomplish its objectives and gave India an excuse to declare a full-scale war against Pakistan the same day. By midnight, the Indian Army, accompanied by the Indian Air Force, launched a major three-pronged assault into East Pakistan. The Indian Army won several battles on the eastern front including the decisive Battle of Hilli. The operation also included a battalion-level airborne operation on Tangail, which resulted in the capitulation of all resistance within five days. India&#x27;s massive early gains were attributed largely to the speed and flexibility with which Indian armoured divisions moved across East Pakistan.

Pakistan launched a counterattack against India on the western front. On 4 December 1971, A Company of the 23rd Battalion of India&#x27;s Punjab Regiment intercepted the Pakistani 51st Infantry Brigade near Ramgarh, Rajasthan. The Battle of Longewala ensued, during which A Company, though outnumbered, thwarted the Pakistani advance until the Indian Air Force directed its fighters to engage the Pakistani tanks. By the time the battle had ended, 38 Pakistani tanks and 100 armoured vehicles were either destroyed or abandoned. About 200 Pakistani troops were killed in action, while only two Indian soldiers died. Pakistan suffered another major defeat on the western front at the Battle of Basantar, which was fought from 4 to 16 December. During the battle, about 66 Pakistani tanks were destroyed and 40 more were captured. Pakistani forces destroyed only 11 Indian tanks. By 16 December, Pakistan had lost sizeable territory on both the eastern and western fronts.

On 16 December 1971, under the command of Lt. General J. S. Arora, elements of the three corps of the Indian Army that had invaded East Pakistan entered Dhaka as a part of the Indo-Bangladesh allied force and forced Pakistani forces to surrender, one day after the conclusion of the Battle of Basantar. After Pakistan&#x27;s Lt General A. A. K. Niazi signed the Instrument of Surrender, India, as a part of the allied forces, took more than 90,000 Pakistani prisoners of war. By the time of the signing, 11,000 Pakistani soldiers had been killed in action, while India suffered 3,500 battle-related deaths. In addition, Pakistan lost 220 tanks during the battle compared to India&#x27;s 69.

In 1972, the Simla Agreement was signed between the two countries, although subsequent incidences of heightened tensions have resulted in continued military vigilance on both sides.

==== Siachen conflict (1984) ====

The Siachen Glacier, although a part of the Kashmir region, was not demarcated on maps prepared and exchanged between the two sides in 1947. In consequence, before the 1980s neither India nor Pakistan maintained a permanent military presence in the region. However, beginning in the 1950s, Pakistan began sending mountaineering expeditions to the glacier. By the early 1980s, the Government of Pakistan was granting special expedition permits to mountaineers and United States Army maps showed Siachen as a part of Pakistan. This practice gave rise to the term &quot;oropolitics&quot;.

India, possibly irked by these developments, launched Operation Meghdoot in April 1984. An entire battalion of the Kumaon Regiment was airlifted to the glacier. Pakistani forces responded quickly, and clashes between the two followed. The Indian Army secured the strategic Sia La and Bilafond La mountain passes, and by 1985 more than of territory claimed by Pakistan was under Indian control. The Indian Army continues to control all of the Siachen Glacier and its tributary glaciers. Pakistan has made several unsuccessful attempts to regain control over Siachen. In late 1987, Pakistan mobilised about 8,000 troops and garrisoned them near Khapalu, aiming to capture Bilafond La. However, they were repulsed by Indian Army personnel guarding Bilafond. During the battle, about 23 Indian soldiers lost their lives, while more than 150 Pakistani troops perished. Further unsuccessful attempts to reclaim positions were launched by Pakistan in 1990, 1995, 1996, and 1999, most notably in Kargil in the latter year.
India continues to maintain a strong military presence in the region, despite inhospitable conditions. The conflict over Siachen is regularly cited as an example of mountain warfare. The highest peak in the Siachen Glacier region, Saltoro Kangri, could be viewed as strategically important for India because of its height, which would enable Indian forces to monitor Pakistani or Chinese movements in the area. Maintaining control over Siachen poses several logistical challenges for the Indian Army. Several infrastructure projects were constructed in the region, including a helipad at an elevation of . In 2004, the Indian Army was spending an estimated US$2 million a month to support its personnel stationed in the region.

==== Counter-insurgency activities ====

The Indian Army has played a crucial role in fighting insurgents and terrorists within the nation. The army launched Operation Blue Star and Operation Woodrose in the 1980s to combat Sikh insurgents. The army, along with some paramilitary forces, has the prime responsibility of maintaining law and order in the troubled Jammu and Kashmir region, under Northern Command. The Indian Army sent a contingent to Sri Lanka in 1987 as a part of the Indian Peace Keeping Force. The Indian Army also successfully conducted Operation Golden Bird in 1995, as a counter-insurgency operation in northeast India.

==== Kargil war (1999) ====
In 1998, India carried out nuclear tests; and a few days later, Pakistan responded with nuclear tests of its own, giving both countries nuclear deterrence capability, although India had tested a hydrogen bomb, which Pakistan lacked. Diplomatic tensions eased after the Lahore Summit was held in 1999. However, the sense of optimism was short-lived. In mid-1999, Pakistani paramilitary forces and Kashmiri insurgents captured the deserted, but strategic, Himalayan heights in the Kargil district of India. These had been vacated by the Indian Army during the onset of the inhospitable winter and were to be reoccupied in spring. The troops that took control of these areas received important support, of both arms and supplies, from Pakistan. Some of the heights under their control, which also included the Tiger Hill, overlooked the vital Srinagar–Leh Highway (NH 1A), Batalik, and Dras.

Once the scale of the Pakistani incursion was realised, the Indian Army quickly mobilised about 200,000 troops, and Operation Vijay was launched. However, since the heights were under Pakistani control, India was at a clear strategic disadvantage. From their observation posts, the Pakistani forces had a clear line-of-sight to lay down indirect artillery fire on NH 1A, inflicting heavy casualties on the Indians. This was a serious problem for the Indian Army as the highway was its main supply route. Thus, the Indian Army&#x27;s priority was to recapture peaks near NH 1A. This resulted in Indian troops first targeting the Tiger Hill and Tololing complex in Dras. This was soon followed by more attacks on the Batalik–Turtok sub-sector, which provided access to Siachen Glacier. Point 4590, which had the nearest view of the NH 1A, was successfully recaptured by Indian forces on 14 June.

Though most of the posts in the vicinity of the highway were cleared of the enemy by mid-June, some posts near Dras endured sporadic shelling until the end of the war. Once the NH 1A area was cleared, the Indian Army turned to drive the invading force back across the Line of Control. The Battle of Tololing, among others, slowly tilted the war in India&#x27;s favour. Nevertheless, some Pakistani posts put up a stiff resistance, including Tiger Hill (Point 5140), which fell only later in the war. As the operation was fully underway, about 250 artillery guns were brought in to clear the infiltrators in posts that were in the line-of-sight. At many vital points, neither artillery nor air power could dislodge the Pakistan soldiers, who were out of visible range. The Indian Army mounted some direct frontal ground assaults, which were slow and took a heavy toll, given the steep ascents that had to be made on peaks as high as . Two months into the conflict, Indian troops had slowly retaken most of the ridges they had lost. According to official accounts, an estimated 75%–80% of the enemy-occupied area, and nearly all the high ground, was back under Indian control.

Following the Washington Accord of 4 July, where Sharif agreed to withdraw Pakistani troops, most of the fighting came to a gradual halt; but some Pakistani forces remained in positions on the Indian side of the LOC. In addition, the United Jihad Council (an umbrella group for all extremists) rejected Pakistan&#x27;s plan for a draw-down, deciding instead to fight on. The Indian Army launched its final attacks in the last week of July. As soon as the Dras sub-sector had been cleared of Pakistani forces, the fighting ceased on 26 July, which has since been celebrated as Kargil Vijay Diwas (Kargil Victory Day) in India. By the end of the war, India had resumed control of all the territory south and east of the Line of Control, as was established in July 1972 per the Shimla Accord. By the time all hostilities had ended, the number of Indian soldiers killed during the conflict stood at 527, while more than 700 regular members of the Pakistani Army had been killed. The number of Islamist fighters, also known as Mujahideen, killed by Indian armed forces during the conflict stood at about 3,000.

==== 2016 Surgical Strikes on Kashmir and the 2016–2018 India-Pakistan conflict ====
On 18 September 2016, a &quot;fedayeen&quot; attack was made by four armed militants on an army base near the town of Uri. Nineteen Indian Army soldiers were killed. India accused Jaish-e-Muhammad, a Pakistan-based terrorist organisation. On 29 September 2016, the India Army announced that it conducted &quot;surgical strikes&quot; against militant launch pads across the Line of Control, in Pakistani-administered Kashmir, and inflicted &quot;significant casualties&quot;. Indian media reported the casualty figures variously from 35 to 70 killed. Partial footage of the strikes was released to the Indian media on 27 June 2018 as proof of the strike. The incident triggered the 2016–2018 India-Pakistan border conflict, which ended on 16 June 2018 with both India and Pakistan agreeing on a ceasefire.

==== 2019 India–Pakistan border skirmishes ====
Following the 14 February 2019 Pulwama attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 40 Indian Central Reserve Police Force personnel. Responsibility for the attack was claimed by a Pakistan-based militant group, Jaish-e-Mohammed. India blamed Pakistan for the attack and promised a robust response, while the latter condemned the attack and denied having any connection to it.

Twelve days later, in the early morning of 26 February 2019, India carried out a cross-border airstrike near Balakot, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.

After over a month-long skirmish, both Indian Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan agreed on a peace offer on 22 March 2019 ending hostilities and vowed to fight against terrorism together.

==== United Nations peacekeeping missions ====

India has been the largest troop contributor to UN peacekeeping missions since its inception. So far, India has taken part in 43 Peacekeeping missions, with a total contribution exceeding 160,000 troops and a significant number of police personnel having been deployed. In 2014, India was the third largest troop contributor (TCC), with 7,860 personnel deployed, of which 995 were police personnel, including the first UN Female Formed Police Unit, serving with ten UN peacekeeping missions. , 157 Indians have been killed during such missions. The Indian army has also provided paramedical units to facilitate the withdrawal of the sick and wounded.

==== Indo-China Doklam issue ====
=== Major exercises ===
==== Operation Brasstacks ====

Operation Brasstacks was launched by the Indian Army in November 1986 to simulate a full-scale war on India&#x27;s western border. The exercise was the largest ever conducted in India; it included nine infantry, three mechanised, three armoured divisions, and one air assault division, as well as three independent armoured brigades. Amphibious assault exercises were also conducted with the Indian Navy. Brasstacks also allegedly incorporated nuclear attack drills. It led to tensions with Pakistan and a subsequent rapprochement in mid-1987.

==== Exercise Nomadic Elephant ====

Since 2004, and every year since, the Indian Army has been conducting training exercises with the Mongolian Army. In 2012, the exercise took place in Belgaum; in June 2013, it was held in Mongolia. The aim of the exercises is to enhance counterinsurgency and counter-terrorism operations, and to train in conducting peacekeeping operations under the mandate of the United Nations.

==== Exercise Ashwamedha ====

Indian Army tested its network-centric warfare capabilities in the Ashwamedha exercise. The exercise was held in the Thar desert, and over 300,000 troops participated. Asymmetric warfare capability was also tested by the Indian Army during the exercise.

==== Exercise Yudh Abhyas ====


The Yudh Abhyas exercise is an ongoing series, since 2005 of joint exercises between the Indian and United States armies, agreed upon under the New Framework of the India-US Defence Relationship. Commencing at the platoon level, the exercise has graduated to a command post (CPX) and field training exercise (FTX).

The seventh edition of Yudh Abhyas began on 5 March 2012, in two locations under the Southwestern Command. The US Army contingent is from the US Army Pacific (USARPAC), part of the United States Pacific Command (USPACOM). The command post exercise has an engineer brigade headquarters, with its planners drawn from both countries, while the field training exercise comprises troops of the United States&#x27; 2nd Squadron, 14th Cavalry Regiment, from the 25th Infantry Division, Hawaii, along with a Stryker platoon, and a similarly sized Indian Army contingent of mechanised infantry. Several key surveillance, communications, and IED detection and neutralisation technologies, available to both sides, were fielded in the exercise.

The eighth edition of Yudh Abhyas was conducted from 3 to 17 May 2013 as a U.S.-Army-Pacific-sponsored bilateral training exercise with the Indian Army, an exercise that focused on the two countries&#x27; cultures, weapons training, and tactics. Units from the United States included the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, from Fort Bragg, N.C., and the 3rd Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment. Units from India were the Indian Army&#x27;s 99th Mountain Brigade; the 2nd Battalion, 5th Gurka Rifles; the 50th Independent Parachute Brigade; and the 54th Engineers Regiment.

==== Exercise Shakti ====

The Shakti exercise is an ongoing series, since 2011, of joint exercises between the Indian and French armies. The exercise is conducted to practice and validate anti-terrorist operations in snowbound and mountainous areas. The first joint exercise was held in India in October 2011 and the second one in September 2013. The theme of the exercise is to conduct joint platoon-level counter-insurgency operations in high-altitude mountainous terrain under the UN Charter, thus emphasising the shared concerns of both countries regarding global terrorism. An added aim of the exercise is to qualitatively enhance knowledge of each other&#x27;s military procedures, thus increasing the scope for interoperability and the ability to respond to a common threat. The twelve-day exercise with the French Army is scheduled to be conducted in multiple modules in order to achieve complete integration between the two contingents at every stage.

==== Exercise Shoorveer ====

From the first week of April to the first week of May 2012, the Indian Army launched a massive summer exercise in the Rajasthan desert, involving over 50,000 troops and several hundred artillery pieces and infantry combat vehicles, as part of its efforts to shore up its battle worthiness on the western front, the border with Pakistan. The exercise, code-named &quot;Shoorveer&quot;, was being conducted by the Jaipur-based South Western Command. This was the largest ever exercise conducted by the Indian army since 1947. The collective training started with the honing of basic battle procedures and tactical drills.

Several field firings were carried out to check the accuracy and lethality of weapon systems. Many innovations, adopted by units and formations to enhance combat power, were tested in the field. The troops built on the training momentum gradually, with increasing combat tempo, to set the stage for a major joint army–air force exercise in the latter part of the exercise.

==== Exercise Rudra Akrosh ====

In May 2012, the Indian Army conducted several war games aimed (according to officials) at validating &quot;the operational and transformational effectiveness of various formations under the Western Army Command&quot;. The exercise involved approximately 20,000 troops and support from the Indian Air Force.

==== Exercise Shatrujeet ====

In April 2016, the Indian Army conducted a major exercise called Shatrujeet, with the elite Mathura-based Strike Corps in the desert area of the Mahajan Field Firing Range in Rajasthan, whose object was to evaluate the capability to strike deep into enemy territory, to deliver a quick, lethal strike against the enemy in an integrated air-land battle environment, with co-ordination among all the forces in a nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare scenario.

== Mission and doctrine ==

Initially, the army&#x27;s main objective was to defend the nation&#x27;s frontiers. However, over the years, the army has also taken up the responsibility of providing internal security, especially against insurgencies in Kashmir and Northeast India. Currently, the army is also looking at enhancing its special forces capabilities. With India&#x27;s increasing international role, and the requirement to protect its interests in far-off countries becoming important, the Indian Army and the Indian Navy are jointly planning to set up a marine brigade.

The current combat doctrine of the Indian Army is based on effectively utilising holding formations and strike formations. In the case of an attack, the holding formations would contain the enemy and strike formations would counter-attack to neutralise enemy forces. In the case of an Indian attack, the holding formations would pin enemy forces down, whilst the strike formations would attack at a point of India&#x27;s choosing. The Indian Army is large enough to devote several corps to the strike role.
== Organisation ==
=== Leadership ===

The troops are organized into 40 Divisions in 14 Corps. Army headquarters is located in the Indian capital, New Delhi, and it is under the overall command of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS).

=== Command structure ===

The army operates six operational commands and one training command. Each command is headed by General Officer Commanding-in-Chief with the rank of Lieutenant General. Each command directly reports to Army HQ in New Delhi. These commands are given below in order of creation, with location (city) and commanders listed. There is also the Army Training Command abbreviated ARTRAC. Besides these, army officers may head tri-service commands such as the Strategic Forces Command and Andaman and Nicobar Command, as well as institutions such as the Integrated Defence Staff.

=== Combat Arms ===

Not to be confused with the field corps listed above, the corps mentioned below are divisions entrusted with specific pan-Army tasks.

The Indian Territorial Army has battalions affiliated with different infantry regiments and some department units that are from the Corps of Engineers, Army Medical Corps, or the Army Service Corps. They serve as a part-time reserve. On 4 June 2017, the chief of staff announced that the Army was planning to open combat positions to women, who would first be appointed to positions in the military police.

==== Armoured Corps ====
There are 65 armoured regiments in the Indian Army. These include the President&#x27;s Bodyguard and the 61st Cavalry as well as the following historic regiments dating back to the nineteenth century or earlier: 1st (Skinner&#x27;s) Horse, the 2nd Lancers (Gardner&#x27;s Horse), the 3rd Cavalry, the 4th (Hodson&#x27;s) Horse, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 8th Light Cavalry, the 9th (Deccan) Horse, the 14th (Scinde) Horse, the 17th (Poona) Horse, the 15th Lancers, the 16th Light Cavalry, the 18th Cavalry, the 20th Lancers and the 21st (Central India) Horse. A substantial number of additional units designated as either &quot;Cavalry&quot; or &quot;Armoured&quot; Regiments have been raised since Independence.

==== Mechanised Infantry ====
The Mechanised Infantry is the newest combat arm of the Indian Army. Often referred to as &quot;tomorrow&#x27;s arm in today&#x27;s army&quot;, it is formed of two regiments—The Brigade of the Guards and Mechanised Infantry Regiment—and comprises 50 Mechanised Infantry battalions in all. It is the brainchild of General Krishnaswamy Sundarji (28 April 1930 – 8 February 1999), who was the Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army from 1986 to 1988. During the late 70s, as part of Indian Army modernisation, there was an urgent need to re-calibrate the Indian Mechanised Forces, which led to the forming of Mechanised Infantry units to further the shock-action, fire-power, flexibility, and mobility of armoured formations by including ground-holding ability. The Mechanised Infantry regiments were first created with carefully selected existing Infantry battalions, based on their operational performance. As the need for more mechanised battalions grew, the elite Brigade of The Guards was also converted to the mechanised profile. The two regiments along with the Armoured Corps form part of the Indian Army&#x27;s elite &quot;Mechanised Forces&quot;.

There are 50 mechanised infantry battalions in the Army. Of these, 10 are for reconnaissance and support battalions (5 wheeled and 5 tracked) and 40 are standard mechanised infantry battalions (10 wheeled and 30 tracked).

The Standard and Recce &amp; Support Tracked battalions are equipped with BMP-2 while the Wheeled ones are equipped with Jeep (mounted ATGM launchers) and BRDM-2. The recce and support battalions also included 4 ATGM battalions (including 17 Guards battalion). These were later converted to R&amp;S battalions.

==== Infantry ====


Upon its inception, the Indian Army inherited the British Army&#x27;s organisational structure, which is still maintained today. Therefore, like its predecessor, an Indian infantry regiment&#x27;s responsibility is not to undertake field operations but to provide battalions and well-trained personnel to the field formations. As such, it is common to find battalions of the same regiment spread across several brigades, divisions, corps, commands, and even theatres. Like its British and Commonwealth counterparts, troops enlisted within the regiment are immensely loyal, take great pride in the regiment to which they are assigned, and generally spend their entire career within the regiment.

Most Indian Army infantry regiments recruit based on certain selection criteria, such as region (for example, the Assam Regiment), caste/community (Jat Regiment), or religion (Sikh Regiment). Most regiments continue the heritage of regiments raised under the British Raj, but some have been raised after independence, some of which have specialised in border defence, in particular the Ladakh Scouts, the Arunachal Scouts, and the Sikkim Scouts.

Over the years there have been fears that troops&#x27; allegiance lay more with their regiments and the regions/castes/communities/religions from which they were recruited, as opposed to the Indian union as a whole. Thus some &quot;all India&quot; or &quot;all class&quot; regiments have been created, which recruit troops from all over India, regardless of region, caste, community, or religion: such as the Brigade of the Guards (which later converted to the Mechanised Infantry profile) and the Parachute Regiment.

==== Artillery ====
The Regiment of Artillery is the second-largest arm of the Indian Army, constituting nearly one-sixth of the Army&#x27;s total strength. Originally raised in 1935 as part of the Royal Indian Artillery of the British Indian Army, the Regiment is now tasked with providing the Army&#x27;s towed and self-propelled field artillery, including guns, howitzers, heavy mortars, rockets, and missiles.

As an integral part of nearly all combat operations conducted by the Indian Army, the Regiment of Artillery has a history of being a major contributor to its military success. During the Kargil War, it was the Indian Artillery that inflicted the most damage. Over the years, five artillery officers have gone on to the Army&#x27;s highest post as Chief of Army Staff.

For some time, the Regiment of Artillery commanded a significantly larger share of the Army&#x27;s personnel than it does now, as it was also responsible for air defence artillery and some aviation assets. The 1990s saw the formation of the Corps of Army Air Defence and the coalescing of all aviation assets into the Army Aviation Corps. The arm is now focused on field artillery and supplies regiments and batteries to each of the operational commands. The home of the Regiment is in Nashik, Maharashtra, where their headquarters is located, along with the service&#x27;s museum. The School of Artillery of the Indian Army is located nearby, in Devlali.

After suffering consistent failure to import or produce modern artillery for three decades, the Regiment of Artillery is finally going ahead with procurement of brand new 130-mm and 155-mm guns. The Army is also putting large numbers of rocket launchers into service, with 22 regiments to be equipped with the indigenously developed Pinaka multi barrel rocket launcher by the end of the next decade.

==== Corps of Engineers ====

The Indian Army Corps of Engineers has a long history dating back to the mid-18th century. The earliest existing subunit of the Corps (18 Field Company) dates back to 1777, while the Corps officially recognises its birth as 1780, when the senior-most group of the Corps, the Madras Sappers, were raised. The Corps consists of three groups of combat engineers, namely the Madras Sappers, the Bengal Sappers, and the Bombay Sappers. A group is roughly analogous to a regiment of the Indian infantry, each group consisting of several engineer regiments. The engineer regiment is the basic combat-engineer unit, analogous to an infantry battalion.

==== Corps of Signals ====

Indian Army Corps of Signals is a corps and the arm of the Indian Army which handles its military communications. It was formed on 15 February 1911 as a separate entity under Lieutenant Colonel S. H. Powell and went on to make important contributions during World War I and World War II. On 15 February 2011, the corps celebrated the 100th anniversary of its raising.

==== Army Aviation Corps ====

The Army Aviation Corps, formed on 1 November 1986, is the aviation arm of the Indian Army. It is headed by a Director-General with the rank of Lieutenant General at Army HQ in New Delhi.

==== Corps of Army Air Defence ====

The Corps of Army Air Defence (abbreviated AAD) is an active corps of the Indian Army, and a major combat formation tasked with the air defences of the country from foreign threats. The Corps is responsible for the protection of Indian air space from enemy aircraft and missiles, especially those below 5,000 feet.

The history of the AAD dates back to 1939, during the times of the British Raj in India. The corps actively took part in the Second World War, fighting on behalf of the British Empire. Post-independence, the corps has participated in all the wars involving India, starting with the 1947 Indo-Pakistani War, up to the 1999 Kargil conflict. The corps enjoyed autonomous status from 1994, after the bifurcation of the Corps of Air Defence Artillery from the Army&#x27;s artillery regiment. A separate training school, the Army Air Defence College (AADC), was established to train its personnel.

=== Services ===
==== Recruitment and training ====
Pre-commission training of Gentlemen Cadets is carried out at the Indian Military Academy at Dehradun and the Officers Training Academy at Chennai. There are also specialised training institutions such as the Army War College, at Mhow, Madhya Pradesh; the High Altitude Warfare School (HAWS), at Gulmarg, Jammu and Kashmir; the Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School (CIJW), in Vairengte, Mizoram; and the College of Military Engineering (CME), in Pune.

The Army Training Command (ARTRAC), at Shimla, supervises training of personnel.

In 2020 a &#x27;Tour of Duty&#x27; scheme was proposed for voluntary recruitment into the forces for civilians, to enable them to join for three years of short service. The scheme is on a trial basis and will start with a test group of 100 officers and 1000 jawans.

===== Agnipath Scheme =====

Agnipath Scheme is a new scheme introduced by the Government of India on 14 June 2022, for recruitment of soldiers below the rank of commissioned officers into the three services of the armed forces. All recruits will be hired only for a four-year period. Personnel recruited under this system are to be called &quot;Agniveers&quot; (), which will be a new military rank. The introduction of the scheme has been criticized for lack of consultation and public debate. The scheme was implemented in September 2022.

This scheme will bypass many things including long tenures, pension and other benefits which were there in old system. Opposition parties in India have criticised and expressed concerns about the consequences of the new scheme. They have asked the scheme to be put on hold and that the scheme be discussed in the Parliament.

==== Intelligence ====
The Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI) is an intelligence-gathering arm of the Indian Army. The MI (as it is commonly referred to) was constituted in 1941. It was initially created to check corruption in the Army&#x27;s ranks. With time, its role has evolved into cross-border intelligence, intelligence sharing with friendly nations, infiltrating insurgent groups, and counterterrorism.

In the late 1970s, the MI was embroiled in the Samba spy scandal, wherein three Indian Army officers were falsely implicated as Pakistani spies. The organisation has since emerged from the scandal as a prime intelligence organisation of the Indian Army.

, the MI has seen many of its roles taken away by the newly created National Technical Research Organisation and the Defence Intelligence Agency. Since it was set up in 2004 as a premier scientific agency under the National Security Adviser in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, it also includes the National Institute of Cryptology Research and Development (NICRD), which is the first of its kind in Asia.

==== STEAG ====
The Signals Technology Evaluation and Adaptation Group (STEAG), a specialist technical unit tasked with investigating and evaluating cutting-edge communication technologies, was founded by the Indian Army on 18 March 2024. It will prioritize the development of specialized technologies for both wired and wireless systems, such as 5G and 6G networks, quantum technologies, artificial intelligence, machine learning, software-defined radios (SDR), electronic exchanges, mobile communications, and Electronic Warfare (EW) systems. In order to find appropriate defense applications, the unit will work with industry and academics to utilize state-of-the-art technology. In addition to developing and evaluating key Information and Communications Technology (ICT) solutions, STEAG will do technical scouting and provide user interface assistance by maintaining and upgrading modern technologies.

=== Field formations ===
Below are the basic field formations of the Indian Army:

*Command: Indian Army has six operational commands and one training command. Each one is headed by a general officer commanding-in-chief (GOC-in-C), known as the army commander, who is among the senior-most Lieutenant General officers in the army.
*Corps: A command generally consists of two or more corps. Indian Army has 14 Corps each one commanded by a general officer commanding (GOC), known as the corps commander, who holds the rank of Lieutenant General. Each corps is composed of three or four divisions. There are three types of corps in the Indian Army: Strike, Holding and Mixed. The Corps HQ is the highest field formation in the army.
* Division: Each division is headed by GOC (division commander) in the rank of major general. It usually consists of three to four Brigades. Currently, the Indian Army has 40 Divisions including four RAPIDs (Re-organised Army Plains Infantry Division), 18 Infantry Divisions, 12 Mountain Divisions, three Armoured Divisions and three Artillery Divisions.
* Brigade: A brigade generally consists of around 3,000 combat troops with supporting elements. An Infantry Brigade usually has three Infantry battalions along with various Support Elements. It is commanded by a brigade commander who is a Brigadier, equivalent to a brigadier general in some armies. In addition to the Brigades in various Army Divisions, the Indian Army also has five Independent Armoured Brigades, 15 Independent Artillery Brigades, seven Independent Infantry Brigades, one Independent Parachute Brigade, three Independent Air Defence Brigades, two Independent Air Defence Groups and four Independent Engineer Brigades. These Independent Brigades operate directly under the Corps Commander (GOC Corps).
* Battalion: Composed of four rifle companies. Commanded by a battalion commander who is a Colonel and is the Infantry&#x27;s main fighting unit. Every infantry battalion also possesses one Ghatak Platoon.
* Company: Composed of three platoons. Commanded by a company commander who is a major or lieutenant-colonel.
* Battery: Comprising either 3 or 4 sections, in artillery and air defence units. Every battery has two officers, the senior of which is the Battery Commander.
* Platoon: Composed of three sections. Commanded by a platoon commander who is a JCO.
* Section: Smallest military outfit, with a strength of 10 personnel. Commanded by a section commander of the rank of Havaldar.

=== Indian Army forts ===
* Fort William, Kolkata: Garrison of Eastern Army Command
* Fort St George, Chennai: Garrison of ATNK&amp;K Army Area
* OD Fort, Allahabad, Ordnance Depot

== Personnel ==
The Indian Army is a voluntary service, and although a provision for military conscription exists in the Indian constitution, conscription has never been imposed. , the Indian Army has a sanctioned strength of 49,932 officers (42,253 serving, being 7,679 under strength), and 1,215,049 enlisted personnel (1,194,864 serving, being 20,185 under strength). Recently, it has been proposed to increase the strength of the army by more than 90,000, to counter the increasing presence of Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, in 2020 the army had a strength of 1,237,000 active personnel and 960,000 reserve personnel. Of those in reserve, 300,000 are first-line reserves (within 5 years of active service), 500,000 are committed to return if called until the age of 50, and 160,000 were in the Indian Territorial Army, with 40,000 in regular establishment. This makes the Indian Army the world&#x27;s largest standing volunteer army.

=== Rank structure ===

The ranks of the Indian Army for the most part follow the British Army tradition.

Commissioned Officers
Commissioned officers are the leaders of the army and command units from platoon/company to brigade, division, corps, and above.

Indian Army officers are continually put through different courses of training, and assessed on merit, for promotions and appointments. Substantive promotions up to lieutenant colonel, or equivalent, are based on time in service, whereas those for the colonel and above are based on selection, with promotion to colonel being also based on time served.


Other Ranks
=== Uniforms ===

To make themselves less of a target, the forces of the East India Company in India dyed their white summer tunics to neutral tones initially a tan called khaki (from the Hindi word for &quot;dusty&quot;). This was a temporary measure that became standard in the Indian service in the 1880s. Only during the Second Boer War in 1902, did the entire British Army standardise on dun for Service Dress. The Indian Army uniform standardised on dun for khaki.

The service dress consists of a dark green coloured short-sleeved shirt with matching dark green trousers. Officers can add a four pocket tunic worn over a peach coloured button down shirt and black tie. The Winter &quot;Angola&quot;, meaning Angora wool, version substitutes a light brown/dark khaki long-sleeved button up shirt. It is accompanied by beret or peaked cap depending on the regiment the soldier belongs to. Organizational headwear, sashes, belts, spats, medals, lanyards, and other achievements are added for ceremonial duties. A black version is worn by the Armoured Corps.

The 2006 standard issued camouflage uniform of the Indian Army was the PC-DPM which consists of French Camouflage Europe Centrale featuring a forest camouflage pattern and is designed for use in woodland environments being printed on BDU. The Desert variant issued in 2006 was based on the French Camouflage Daguet printed on BDU, which features a desert camouflage pattern, is used by artillery and infantry posted in dusty, semi-desert, and desert areas of Rajasthan and its vicinity. Starting in 2022, a digital pixelated camouflage pattern uniform designed by NIFT has been adopted, while the uniform style is similar to the US Marine MMCUU uniform.

The new camouflage pattern retains the mix of colours including olive green and earthen, and has been designed keeping in mind aspects like areas of deployment of the troops and climatic conditions they operate in. According to the officials, the fabric of the new material makes it lighter, sturdier, more breathable, and more suitable for the different terrains that the soldiers are posted in.

The new uniform, unlike the old one, has a combat T-shirt worn underneath and a jacket over it. Also, unlike the older uniform, the shirt will not be tucked in. The jacket has angular top pockets, lower pockets with vertical openings, knife pleats at the back, a pocket on the left sleeve &amp; a pen holder on the left forearm, and improved-quality buttons. The trousers will be adjustable at the waist with elastic and buttons, and has a double layer at the groin. For the caps, the girth will be adjustable, and the logo of the Army will be of better quality than earlier.

The new uniforms would not be available in the open market. The uniforms will be barcoded and QR coded to maintain their uniqueness and will be available only through the ordnance chain or military canteens. To control random proliferation, they will come in over a dozen pre-stitched standard sizes. The new uniform will be made available in a phased manner to the nearly 1.2 million personnel of the Indian Army.

The modern Indian Army wears distinctive parade uniforms characterised by variegated turbans and waist-sashes in regimental colours. The Gurkha and Garhwal Rifles and the Assam, Kumaon, and Naga Regiments wear broad-brimmed hats of traditional style. Traditionally, all rifle regiments (the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles, the Garhwal Rifles, all Gorkha Rifles, and the Rajputana Rifles), as well as the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry, wear rank badges, buttons, and wire-embroidered articles in black, instead of the usual brass (or gold) colour, as the original role of the rifle regiments was camouflage and concealment.

=== Medals and awards ===
The medals awarded by the President of India for gallantry displayed on the battlefield, in order of precedence, are Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra.

The medals awarded by the President for gallantry displayed away from the battlefield, in order of precedence, are Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra.

Many of the recipients of these awards have been Indian Army personnel.

=== Women ===
The role of women in the Indian Army began when the Indian Military Nursing Service was formed in 1888. Nurses served in World Wars I and II, where 350 Indian Army nurses either died, were taken prisoner of war, or declared missing in action; this includes nurses who died when SS Kuala was sunk by Japanese Bombers in 1942. In 1992, the Indian Army began inducting women officers in non-medical roles.

=== Agnipath Recruiting Scheme ===

The Agnipath Scheme (also spelled Agneepath Scheme) (, ) is a tour of duty style scheme approved by the Government of India on 14 June 2022 and implemented in the country a few months later in September 2022, for recruitment of soldiers below the rank of commissioned officers into the three services of the armed forces.&lt;section begin=&quot;Lead&quot; /&gt; All recruits will be hired only for a four-year period however 25% will be eligible for advancement into career status. Personnel recruited under this system are to be called &quot;Agniveers&quot; (), which will be a new military rank. The introduction of the scheme has been criticised for lack of consultation and public debate. Initial training will last six months and the remaining three years and six months will be service time.

== Equipment ==

Most of the army equipment is imported, but efforts are being made to manufacture indigenous equipment. The Defence Research and Development Organisation has developed a range of weapons for the Indian Army, including small arms, artillery, radars, and the Arjun tank. All Indian military small-arms are manufactured under the umbrella administration of the Ordnance Factories Board, with principal firearm manufacturing facilities in Ichhapore, Cossipore, Kanpur, Jabalpur, and Tiruchirapalli. The Indian Small Arms System (INSAS) rifle, which has been successfully deployed since 1997, is a product of Rifle Factory Ishapore, while ammunition is manufactured at Khadki, and possibly at Bolangir.

In 2014, Army chief General Bikram Singh said that if given sufficient budget support, the Indian Army might be able to acquire half the ammunition needed to fight in a major conflict by the next year.

=== Aircraft ===
The Army Aviation Corps is the main body of the Indian Army for tactical air transport, reconnaissance, and medical evacuation, while the Indian Air Force&#x27;s helicopter assets are responsible for assisting army troop transport and close air support. The Aviation Corps operates approximately 150 helicopters. The Indian army had projected a requirement for a helicopter that can carry loads of up to to heights of on the Siachen Glacier in Jammu and Kashmir. Flying at these heights poses unique challenges due to the rarefied atmosphere. The Indian Army will induct the HAL Light Utility Helicopter to replace its ageing fleet of Chetaks and Cheetahs, some of which were deployed more than three decades ago.

On 13 October 2012, the defence minister gave control of attack helicopters to the Indian Army, which had formerly rested the Indian Air force.

=== Future developments ===
The major ongoing weapons programmes of the Indian Army are as follows:

==== Infantry ====
* F-INSAS is the Indian Army&#x27;s principal infantry modernisation programme, which aims to modernise the army&#x27;s 465 infantry and paramilitary battalions by 2020. The programme aims to upgrade the infantry to a multi-calibre rifle with an under-barrel grenade launcher, as well as bulletproof jackets and helmets. The helmet would include a visor, flashlight, thermal sensors, night vision devices, and a miniature computer with an audio headset. There would also be a new lightweight and waterproof uniform, which would help the soldier in carrying extra loads and fighting in an NBC environment.
*In 2008, the Cabinet Committee on Security approved raising two new infantry mountain divisions (with around 15,000 combat soldiers each) and an artillery brigade. These divisions were likely to be armed with ultralight howitzers. In July 2009, it was reported that the Army was advocating a new artillery division. The proposed artillery division, to be under the Kolkata-based Eastern Command, was to have three brigades – two armed with 155 mm howitzers and one with the Russian &quot;Smerch&quot; and indigenous &quot;Pinaka&quot; multiple-launch rocket systems.
*In February 2024, reports emerged for the formation of a new Corps under the Central Command for deployment along Line of Actual Control (LAC). The XVIII Corps will consist of at least one division (with around 15,000 to 18,000 combat soldiers each) and three independent brigades. This includes 14 RAPID Division, 9 Mountain Brigade, 136 Mountain Brigade and 119 Mountain Brigade. This move will convert HQ Uttar Bharat from a Static Formation into &#x27;Full-fledged Combat Arm&#x27;. This move is in a proposal stage in the Army and will be forwarded to the Ministry of Defence for clearance.
*In April 2024, Indian Army proposed two new formations. One of them was the creation of an &quot;adversial force&quot; acting as opposing force which will represent an enemy force in wargames. The other one is a &quot;test-bed brigades or formation&quot; which will enhance the efficiency of testing new weapons for procurement.
*The Indian Army is also preparing to form Integrated Battle Groups and replace the traditional formations of Divisions and Brigades.

==== Small Arms ====
*The Indian Army has 70,000 Sig Sauer SIG 716 assault rifles on order for its frontline troops engaged in counter-militancy operations.
*To meet the needs of the rest of its soldiers, the army has selected the Russian 7.62 mm AK-203 assault rifle as a &quot;Make in India&quot; project to manufacture 650,000 rifles through a government-to-government agreement. To be manufactured by Indo-Russia Rifles Private Limited (IRRPL)
*Army has 550 units of indigenous ASMI (for Para SF) submachine guns and another 550 units of Taurus T9 on order.
*Earlier development efforts of the DRDO to meet the Indian Army&#x27;s small arms requirements—namely the Excalibur rifle, which was meant to replace the INSAS rifle in service; the Multi Caliber Individual Weapon System (MCIWS); and the Modern Sub Machine Carbine, a combined venture of ARDE &amp; OFB to develop an assault carbine for the Indian Army based on a platform of experiences from the INSAS rifle—have been halted.

==== Mechanised Forces ====
* India is currently re-organising its mechanised forces to achieve strategic mobility and high-volume firepower for rapid thrusts into enemy territory. 
* India proposes to progressively deploy as many as 248 Arjun main battle tanks (MBT) and to develop and deploy the Arjun MK-1A variant, as well as 1,657 Russian-made T-90S MBTs.

<text>Epydoc is a documentation generator that processes its own lightweight markup language Epytext for Python documentation strings. As opposed to freeform Python docstrings, reStructuredText (both also supported) and other markup languages for docstrings, Epytext supports linking between different pieces of documentation. The project Epydoc is inactive since February 2009. Epydoc is released under the MIT license.

There are several tools for rendering Epytext. Most commonly, the codice_1 program is used to render Epytext as a series of HTML documents for display on the Internet, or as a PDF document for printing. Epydoc also supports viewing the rendered documentation within Python using a GUI. The syntax is uncomplicated enough for the programmer to read the raw Epytext docstrings embedded in the source code directly.

<text>Heavy bombers are bomber aircraft capable of delivering the largest payload of air-to-ground weaponry (usually bombs) and longest range (takeoff to landing) of their era. Archetypal heavy bombers have therefore usually been among the largest and most powerful military aircraft at any point in time. In the second half of the 20th century, heavy bombers were largely superseded by strategic bombers, which were often even larger in size, had much longer ranges and were capable of delivering nuclear bombs.

Because of advances in aircraft design and engineering — especially in powerplants and aerodynamics — the size of payloads carried by heavy bombers has increased at rates greater than increases in the size of their airframes. The largest bombers of World War I, the Zeppelin-Staaken Riesenflugzeuge of Germany, could carry a payload of up to of bombs; by the latter half of World War II, the Avro Lancaster (introduced in 1942) routinely delivered payloads of (and sometimes up to ) and had a range of , while the B-29 (1944) delivered payloads in excess of and had a range of . By the late 1950s, the jet-powered Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, travelling at speeds of up to (more than double that of a Lancaster), could deliver a payload of , over a combat radius of .

During World War II, mass production techniques made available large, long-range heavy bombers in such quantities as to allow strategic bombing campaigns to be developed and employed. This culminated in August 1945, when B-29s of the United States Army Air Forces dropped atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan.

The arrival of nuclear weapons and guided missiles permanently changed the nature of military aviation and strategy. After the 1950s intercontinental ballistic missiles and ballistic missile submarines began to supersede heavy bombers in the strategic nuclear role. Along with the emergence of more accurate precision-guided munitions (&quot;smart bombs&quot;) and nuclear-armed missiles, which could be carried and delivered by smaller aircraft, these technological advancements eclipsed the heavy bomber&#x27;s once-central role in strategic warfare by the late 20th century. Heavy bombers have, nevertheless, been used to deliver conventional weapons in several regional conflicts since World War II (for example, B-52s in the Vietnam War).

Heavy bombers are now operated only by the air forces of the United States, Russia and China. They serve in both strategic and tactical bombing roles.

==History==

===World War I===

The first heavy bomber was designed as an airliner. Igor Sikorsky, an engineer educated in St Petersburg, but born in Kiev of Polish-Russian ancestry designed the Sikorsky Ilya Muromets to fly between his birthplace and his new home. It did so briefly until August 1914, when the Russo-Balt wagon factory converted to a bomber version, with British Sunbeam Crusader V8 engines in place of the German ones in the passenger plane. By December 1914 a squadron of 10 was bombing German positions on the Eastern Front and by summer 1916 there were twenty. It was well-armed with nine machine guns, including a tail gun and initially was immune to German and Austro-Hungarian air attack. The Sikorsky bomber had a wingspan just a few feet shorter than that of a World War II Avro Lancaster, while being able to carry a bomb load of only 3% of the later aircraft.

The Handley Page Type O/100 owed a lot to Sikorsky&#x27;s ideas; of similar size, it used just two Rolls-Royce Eagle engines and could carry up to of bombs. The O/100 was designed at the beginning of the war for the Royal Navy specifically to sink the German High Seas Fleet in Kiel: the Navy called for “a bloody paralyser of an aircraft” Entering service in late 1916 and based near Dunkirk in France, it was used for daylight raids on naval targets, damaging a German destroyer. But after one was lost, the O/100 switched to night attacks.

The uprated Handley Page Type O/400 could carry a bomb, and wings of up to 40 were used by the newly formed, independent Royal Air Force from April 1918 to make strategic raids on German railway and industrial targets. A single O/400 was used to support T. E. Lawrence&#x27;s Sinai and Palestine Campaign.

The Imperial German Air Service operated the Gotha bomber, which developed a series of marques. The Gotha G.IV operated from occupied Belgium from the Spring of 1917. It mounted several raids on London beginning in May 1917. Some reached no further than Folkestone or Sheerness on the Kent Coast. But on June 13, Gothas killed 162 civilians, including 18 children in a primary school, and injured 432 in East London. Initially, defence against air attack was poor, but by May 19, 1918, when 38 Gothas attacked London, six were shot down and another crashed on landing.

German aircraft companies also built a number of giant bombers, collectively known as the Riesenflugzeug. Most were produced in very small numbers from 1917 onwards and several never entered service. The most numerous were the Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI of which 13 saw service, bombing Russia and London: four were shot down and six lost on landing. The R.VIs were larger than the standard Luftwaffe bombers of World War II.

The Vickers Vimy, a long-range heavy bomber powered by two Rolls-Royce Eagle engines, was delivered to the newly formed Royal Air Force too late to see action (only one was in France at time of the Armistice with Germany). The Vimy&#x27;s intended use was to bomb industrial and railway targets in western Germany, which it could reach with its range of and a bomb load of just over a ton. The Vickers Vimy is best known as the aircraft that made the first Atlantic crossing from St John&#x27;s Newfoundland to Clifden in Ireland piloted by the Englishman John Alcock and navigated by Scot Arthur Whitten Brown on June 14, 1919.

===Strategic bomber theory===

Between the wars, aviation opinion fixed on two tenets. The first was that “the bomber will always get through.” The speed advantage of biplane fighters over bombers was insignificant, and it was believed that they would never catch them. Furthermore, there was no effective method of detecting incoming bombers at sufficiently long range to scramble fighters on an interception course. In practice, a combination of new radar technology and advances in monoplane fighter design eroded this disadvantage. Throughout the war, bombers continually managed to strike their targets, but suffered unacceptable losses in the absence of careful planning and escort fighters. Only the later de Havilland Mosquito light bomber was fast enough to evade fighters. Heavy bombers needed defensive armament for protection, which reduced their effective bomb payload.

The second tenet was that strategic bombing of industrial capacity, power generation, oil refineries, and coal mines could win a war. This was certainly vindicated by the firebombing of Japanese cities and the two atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, as Japan&#x27;s fragile housing and cottage industry made themselves easily vulnerable to attack, thus completely destroying Japanese industrial production (see Air Raids on Japan). It was less evident that it held true for the bombing of Germany. During the war, German industrial production actually &quot;increased&quot;, despite a sustained Allied bombing campaign.

As the German Luftwaffe&#x27;s main task was to support the army, it never developed a successful heavy bomber. The prime proponent of strategic bombing, Luftwaffe Chief of Staff General Walther Wever, died in an air crash in 1936 on the very day that the specification for the Ural bomber (later won by the Heinkel He 177 which saw only limited use against the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom) was published. After Wever&#x27;s death, Ernst Udet, development director at the Air Ministry steered the Luftwaffe towards dive bombers instead.

===World War II===
When Britain and France declared war on Germany in September 1939, the RAF had no heavy bomber yet in service; heavy bomber designs had started in 1936 and ordered in 1938.

The Handley Page Halifax and Avro Lancaster both originated as twin-engine &quot;medium&quot; bombers, but were rapidly redesigned for four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines and rushed into service once the technical problems of the larger Rolls-Royce Vulture emerged in the Avro Manchester. The Halifax joined squadrons in November 1940 and flew its first raid against Le Havre on the night of 11–12 March 1941. British heavy bomber designs often had three gun turrets with a total of 8 machine guns.

In January 1941, the Short Stirling reached operational status and first combat missions were flown in February. It was based on the successful Short Sunderland flying boat and shared its Bristol Hercules radial engines, wing, and cockpit with a new fuselage. It carried up to of bombs—almost twice the load of a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress—but over just a radius. Due to its thick, short wing it was able to out-turn the main German night fighters, the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and the Junkers Ju 88. Heavy bombers still needed defensive armament for protection, even at night. The Stirling&#x27;s low operational ceiling of just —also caused by the thick wing—meant that it was usually picked on by night fighters; within five months, 67 of the 84 aircraft in service had been lost. The bomb bay layout limited the size and types of bombs carried and it was relegated to secondary duties such as tug and paratrooper transport.

Due to the absence of British heavy bombers, 20 United States Army Air Corps Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses were lent to the RAF, which during July 1941 commenced daylight attacks on warships and docks at Wilhelmshaven and Brest. These raids were complete failures. After eight aircraft were lost due to combat or breakdown and with many engine failures, the RAF stopped daylight bombing by September. It was clear that the B-17C model was not combat ready and that its five machine guns provided inadequate protection.

Combat feedback enabled Boeing engineers to improve the aircraft; when the first model B-17E began operating from English airfields in July 1942, it had many more defensive gun positions including a vitally important tail gunner. Eventually, U.S. heavy bomber designs, optimized for formation flying, had 10 or more machine guns and/or cannons in both powered turrets and manually operated flexible mounts to deliver protective arcs of fire. These guns were located in tail turrets, side gun ports either just behind the bombardier&#x27;s clear nose glazing as &quot;cheek&quot; positions, or midway along the rear fuselage sides as &quot;waist&quot; positions. U.S. bombers carried .50 caliber machine gun, and dorsal (spine/top of aircraft) and ventral (belly/bottom of aircraft) guns with powered turrets. All of these machine guns could defend against attack when beyond the range of fighter escort; eventually, a total of 13 machine guns were fitted in the B-17G model. In order to assemble combat boxes of several aircraft, and later combat wings formed of a number of boxes, assembly ships were used to speed up formation.

Even this extra firepower, which increased empty weight by 20% and required more powerful versions of the Wright Cyclone engine, was insufficient to prevent serious losses in daylight. Escort fighters were needed but the RAF interceptors such as the Supermarine Spitfire had very limited endurance. An early raid on Rouen-Sotteville rail yards in Brittany on August 17, 1942, required four Spitfire squadrons outbound and five more for the return trip.
The USAAF chose to attack aircraft factories and component plants. On August 17, 1943, 230 Fortresses attacked a ball-bearing plant in Schweinfurt and again two months later, with 291 bombers, in the second raid on Schweinfurt. The works was severely damaged but at a huge cost: 36 aircraft lost in the first raid, 77 in the second. Altogether 850 airmen were killed or captured; only 33 Fortresses returned from the October raid undamaged

With the arrival of North American P-51 Mustangs and the fitting of drop tanks to increase the range of the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt for the Big Week offensive, between February 20–25, 1944, bombers were escorted all the way to the target and back. Losses were reduced to 247 out of 3,500 sorties, still devastating but accepted at the time.

The Consolidated B-24 Liberator and later version of the Fortress carried even more extensive defensive armament fitted into Sperry ball turrets. This was a superb defensive weapon that rotated a full 360 degrees horizontally with a 90-degree elevation. Its twin M2 Browning machine guns had an effective range of . The Liberator was the result of a proposal to assemble Fortresses in Consolidated plants, with the company returning with its own design of a longer-range, faster and higher-flying aircraft that could carry an extra ton of bombs. Early orders were for France (delivered to the RAF after the fall of France) and Britain, already at war, with just a batch of 36 for the USAAF.

Neither the USAAF nor the RAF judged the initial design suitable for bombing and it was first used on a variety of VIP transport and maritime patrol missions. Its long range, however, persuaded the USAAF to send 177 Liberators from Benghazi in Libya to bomb the Romanian oilfields on August 1, 1943, in Operation Tidal Wave. Due to navigational errors and alerted German flak batteries and fighters, only half returned to base although a few landed safely at RAF bases in Cyprus and some in Turkey, where they were interned. Only 33 were undamaged. Damage to the refineries was soon repaired. 

By October 1942, a new Ford Motor Company plant at Willow Run Michigan was assembling Liberators. Production reached a rate of over one an hour in 1944 helping the B-24 to become the most produced US aircraft of all time. It became the standard heavy bomber in the Pacific and the only one used by the RAAF. The SAAF used Liberators to drop weapons and ammunition during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944.

The Avro Manchester was a twin-engine bomber powered by the ambitious 24-cylinder Rolls-Royce Vulture, but was rapidly redesigned for four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines due to technical problems with the Vulture which caused the aircraft to be unreliable, under-powered and hastened its withdrawal from service. Reaching squadrons early in 1942, the redesigned bomber with four Merlin engines and longer wings was renamed Avro Lancaster; it could deliver a load of bombs or up to with special modifications. The Lancaster&#x27;s bomb bay was undivided, so that bombs of extraordinary size and weight such as the 10-ton Grand Slam could be carried.

Barnes Wallis, deputy chief aircraft designer at Vickers, spent much time thinking about weapons that might shorten the war. He conceived his “Spherical Bomb, Surface Torpedo” after watching his daughter flip pebbles over water. Two versions of the &#x27;bouncing bomb&#x27; were developed: the smaller Highball was to be used against ships and attracted essential British Admiralty funding for his project. A flying torpedo, of which half was Torpex torpedo explosive, it was developed specifically to sink the Tirpitz which was moored in Trondheim fjord behind torpedo nets. Development delays in the &#x27;bouncing bomb&#x27; meant that another Barnes Wallis invention, the 5-ton Tallboy was deployed instead; two Tallboys dropped by Avro Lancasters from altitude hit at near-supersonic speed and capsized the Tirpitz on November 12, 1944. Upkeep, the larger version of the bouncing bomb, was used to destroy the Mohne and Eder dams by Lancasters from the specially recruited and trained No. 617 Squadron RAF, often known as &quot;the Dam Busters&quot;, under Wing Commander Guy Gibson.

In March and April 1945, as the war in Europe was ending, Lancasters dropped Grand Slams and Tallboys on U-boat pens and railway viaducts across north Germany. At Bielefeld more than of railway viaduct was destroyed by Grand Slams creating an earthquake effect, which shook the foundations.

The Boeing B-29 Superfortress was a development of the Fortress, but a larger design with four Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone engines of much greater power, enabling it to fly higher, faster, further and with a bigger bomb load. The mammoth new Wright radial engines were susceptible to overheating if anything malfunctioned, and technical problems with the powerplant seriously delayed the B-29&#x27;s operational service debut. The aircraft had four remotely operated twin-gun turrets on its fuselage, controlled through an analog computer sighting system; the operator could use any of a trio of Perspex ball stations. Only the tail gunner manually controlled his gun turret station in the rear of the airplane.

B-29s were initially deployed to bases in India and China, from which they could reach Japan; but the logistics (including transport of fuel for the B-29 fleet over the Himalayan range) of flying from these remote, primitive airfields were complicated and costly. The island of Saipan in the Marianas was assaulted to provide Pacific air bases from which to bomb Japanese cities. Initial high-level, daylight bombing raids using high-explosive bombs on Japanese cities with their wood and paper houses produced disappointing results; the bombers were then switched to low-level, nighttime incendiary attacks for which they had not originally been designed (one variant, the B-29B was specially modified for low altitude night missions by removal of armament and other equipment). Japan burned furiously from the B-29 incendiary raids. On August 6, 1945, B-29 Enola Gay dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Three days later, B-29 Bockscar dropped another on Nagasaki. The war ended when Japan announced its surrender to the Allies on August 15, and the Japanese government subsequently signed the official instrument of surrender on September 2, 1945.

===After World War II===
After World War II, the name &quot;strategic bomber&quot; came into use, for aircraft that could carry aircraft ordnances over long distances behind enemy lines. They were supplemented by smaller fighter-bombers with less range and lighter bomb load, for tactical strikes. Later these were called &quot;strike fighters&quot;, &quot;attack aircraft&quot; and &quot;multirole combat aircraft&quot;.

When North Korea attacked South Korea in 1950 the USAF responded with daylight bomber raids on supply lines through North Korea. B-29 Superfortresses flew from Japan on behalf of the United Nations, but the supply line for North Korea&#x27;s army from the Soviet Union was physically and politically out of reach: North Korea for the most part lacked worthwhile strategic targets of its own. The Soviet-backed Northern forces easily routed the South Korean army. The distance to North Korea was too great for fighter escorts based in Japan, so the B-29s flew alone. In November, Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15s flown by Soviet pilots started to intercept the US bombers over North Korea. The MiG-15 was specifically designed to destroy US heavy bombers; it could out-perform any fighter deployed by United Nations air forces until the capable F-86 Sabre was produced in greater numbers and brought to Korea. After 28 B-29s were lost, the bombers were restricted to night interdiction and concentrated on destroying supply routes, including the bridges over the Yalu river into China.

By the 1960s, manned heavy bombers could not match the intercontinental ballistic missile in the strategic nuclear role. More accurate precision-guided munitions (&quot;smart bombs&quot;), nuclear-armed missiles or bombs were able to be carried by smaller aircraft such as fighter-bombers and multirole fighters. Despite these technological innovations and new capabilities of other contemporary military aircraft, large strategic bombers such as the B-1, B-52 and B-2 have been retained for the role of carpet bombing in several conflicts. The most prolific example (in terms of total bomb tonnage) is the U.S. Air Force B-52 Stratofortress during the 1960s–early 1970s Vietnam War era, in Operation Menu, Operation Freedom Deal, and Operation Linebacker II. In 1987 the Soviet Tu-160—the heaviest supersonic bomber/aircraft currently in active service—entered service; it can carry twelve long-range cruise missiles.

The 2010 New START agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation defined a &quot;heavy bomber&quot; by two characteristics:
*range greater than 
*equipped for long-range nuclear &quot;air-launched cruise missiles&quot; (ALCMs), defined as an air-to-surface cruise missile of a type flight-tested from an aircraft or deployed on a bomber after 1986.

<doc id="343963" wikidata="Q5117216" url="?curid=343963" title="St Dunstan's Church, Mayfield">
<text>St Dunstan&#x27;s, Mayfield in Mayfield, East Sussex, was founded in 960 CE by St Dunstan, who was then Archbishop of Canterbury. The church is a listed building. As of 2023, the vicar was Fr Michael Asquith.

== History ==
It is reported that the church was originally a log church which lasted until it was replaced by a stone structure in the 12th century by the Normans. In 1389 this church was virtually destroyed by fire. Only the tower, the lancet window in the west wall and the base of the north aisle survive to this day. The local congregation probably used the private chapel at the Archiepiscopal Palace nearby until the church was rebuilt between 1410 and 1420.

The Church was damaged again in 1621 when it was struck by lightning. The importance of the iron industry in the area is seen inside the church, where 2 cast iron tomb slabs are set in the floor of the nave. The oldest part of the church is the Tower (13th C) which houses a small domestic area, the bells and the clock. Other parts of the church are mainly 17th C with alterations throughout the centuries. The church is considered to be in good repair with all due care given to daily maintenance. Considerable improvements have been made over the past 20 years to provide what has been described as ‘a stunning worship space’.

Further work was carried out during the reign of Henry VIII: the nave roof was raised and the clerestory was added. In 1657 a clock was installed by Thomas Punnett.

In the South Porch moulded corbels support a quadripartite rib vault. A newel staircase gives access to the Parvise Room above. This was used as either an oratory for a chantry priest, or as a sacristan. During the 19th century it was used as a cloakroom for the girls&#x27; school held in the church.

The nave has four tomb slabs of Sussex iron. The best preserved belong to Thomas Sands, a wine cooper of London and his grandson, also named Thomas Sands. The font dates from 1666 and the initials of the vicar at the time, Robert Peck is carved on the octagonal bowl. The 17th century pulpit is decorated with Jacobean strap-carvings.

While many of the choir stalls dated back to the 16th century, some repair work was carried out by the Mayfield School of Carving in the early 20th century. They also provided the Lady Chapel screen, which is an excellent example of linenfold carving. The choir stall were replaced in 2016 by new movable stalls in oak and at the same time the east end was reordered.

The perpendicular east window has Munich glass donated by the Treherne family in 1869. In 1894 the old reredos carved by Walter Gale, the village schoolmaster in 1750 was replaced. The Pope was said to enjoy this eastern facing window as it represented to him, a gateway between eastern and western culture. (reference required)

A window at the west end of the church celebrates the life of Lt Gen Sir John Bagot Glubb, known as Glubb Pasha, soldier, scholar and author, who led and trained Transjordan&#x27;s Arab Legion between 1939 and 1956.

During the 1970s cracks in the tower walls meant that it was forbidden to ring all the bells at once. It was fourteen years before the tower could be restored at a cost of £140,000. The bells were retuned at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The oldest bell had been founded by Thomas Giles in 1602 and other founders included Brian Eldredge, Richard Phelps, John Waylett and John Taylor.

In the year 2000, a joint concert of 100 Belfries was held at the French Festival “Rencontres en Pays de Bray” in Normandy and Mayfield, being performed simultaneously in the churches of Notre-Dame, Neufchatel and St Dunstan, Mayfield and broadcast by the BBC.

Many of the memorials in the church belong to the Baker and Kirby families. These were local ironmaster families.
Georgina Weldon is interred in the Dalrymple family vault.

== Music ==
St Dunstan&#x27;s has a long tradition of Anglican Music. In fact, it is noted in 1731 that St Dunstan&#x27;s was renown for its &quot;skillfull singing of the same Psalms&quot;, from the installed gallery at the west end of the church. The Choir has grown to be one of the largest and highest regarded church choirs in the Diocese, regularly travelling outside of the parish to sing at Cathedrals and Churches around the UK.

=== The Choir ===
The choir sings Choral Eucharist every Sunday in term time, and additionally Choral Evensong once a month, usually on the Last Sunday of the month.  Their schedule also includes singing at weddings and funerals when requested in addition to leading Advent and Christmas Carol services. The choir also maintains a strong junior presence, and draws children and young people from the surrounding area through a reputation for high quality music making and education. Many choristers and choir members have gone on to sing with choirs such as Salisbury Cathedral Choir, Ex Cathedra, The Holst Singers and The Sixteen. Some have even continued to study music at institutions such as Oxford, Cambridge, The Royal Academy of Music and Royal Birmingham Conservatoire.

In June 2019 the choir joined with Salisbury Cathedral Choir for services at Salisbury Cathedral, which included Charles-Marie Widor’s &quot;Messe&quot; and an Easter Cantata by Bach with period orchestra.

The choir has been fortunate to work with some of the country’s leading church musicians and commissioned two anthems by Malcolm Archer which were premiered by the choir under the direction of the composer.

Recent events have included a liturgical performance of excerpts from three of J.S Bach’s Advent Cantatas including ‘&quot;Wachet Auf’&quot; with the Mayfield Festival Baroque Orchestra in December 2021, singing Choral Evensong at Chichester Cathedral where they sang the rarely-performed &quot;Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis in G&quot; by Henry Smart in February 2022, and a performance of G.F Handel&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Messiah&quot;&#x27; with the London Mozart Players in December 2023. Recent visits to other cathedral&#x27;s include: Southwark Cathedral, Rochester Cathedral and Westminster Abbey where the choir sang an evensong for World Humanities Day, in the presence of Their Royal Highnesses The Crown Prince Alexander and Crown Princess Katherine of Serbia in August 2023.

=== The Walker Organ ===

In 1997, a new Walker Organ was installed in St Dunstan&#x27;s. This has widened the repertoire of potential music, and also facilitated an expansion of organ recitals to include Dame Gillian Weir, John Scott, Simon Preston and Olivier Latry, and in the 2018 festival James O’Donnell, organist and master of the choristers of Westminster Abbey. The previous organ built by Browne of Canterbury, was bought second-hand by subscription in 1864, and was enlarged at a cost of over £200 in 1900. Positioned in the South Chancel, it featured 13 stops and a Gothic Fronted case, and was significantly more compact than the organ which replaced it in 1997.

When the replacement Walker Organ was commissioned for St. Dunstan&#x27;s, a considerable amount of money had to be raised for the purchase of the organ, and so a National Lottery grant was bid for. While the application for the bid was taking place, the congregation of St. Dunstan&#x27;s managed to raise the amount necessary for the purchase of the organ, but because the wheels in motion for the bid had already started, Mayfield had to accept the money from the National Lottery Grant anyway. This money was put in an Organ Fund, which is overseen by the Organ Trust, and is used for tuning, and keeping the organ in fine fettle. A specification can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register (NPOR) here.

=== Mayfield Festival of The Arts ===
Founded in 1970 by Kenneth Pont, the then director of music at St Dunstan&#x27;s Parish Church, The Mayfield Festival of Music and the Arts is a bi-ennal festival, with most concerts take place in the 15th century St Dunstan&#x27;s church or in the Old Palace, one of six Sussex mansions which belonged to the See of Canterbury. It also contains a fine concert hall built in 1930 by Adrian Gilbert Scott. The buildings now house Mayfield Girls School, whose choirs regularly provide additional sopranos for festival choral works. It began as part of an attempt to raise funds for the building of St Dunstan&#x27;s church hall. The guiding spirit was the vicar, Canon Donald Carter, who, along with the parish church organist, Kenneth Pont, organised a series of events to fill a fortnight. Even though the hall was never built the festival has continued ever since.

Audiences come together from all over the South-East to hear performances in these historic settings. Programmes have included performances by names such as John Ogdon, Peter Donohoe, Paul Tortelier, Igor Oistrakh, James Galway, Evelyn Glennie, Victoria de los Angeles, Dame Janet Baker, Emma Kirkby, Sir Thomas Allen, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Stephen Kovacevich (in the 2018 Festival) and Joanna Macgregor (in the 2022 Festival).

In 1976, Sir David Willcocks began an association with the festival and conducted one of the two large-scale choral works at every Festival until 2002. His fifteen appearances with the Mayfield Festival Choir included the Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor, the Verdi Requiem, Elgar&#x27;s The Dream of Gerontius and Mozart&#x27;s Grand Mass in C minor.

Kenneth Pont retired as Festival Director in 2004 and was succeeded by Neil Mackie CBE. In 2014 Jeremy Summerly was appointed the Festival&#x27;s Artistic Director. He is Director of Music at St Luke&#x27;s Chelsea and a broadcaster for BBC Radios 3 and 4. He founded the Oxford Camerata in 1984 who regularly perform at the festival. At the 2022 Festival, along with the Mayfield Consort, they gave a memorable performance of Thomas Tallis&#x27; Spem in Alium as part of their English Choral Masterpieces concert.

In 2018 the Festival held a competition for composers to write a cantata based on the life of Saint Dunstan. The new cantata was designed to be ready for performance in 2020 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Festival. The competition was won by Nicholas O’Neill, composer-in-residence and chorus master of the Parliament Choir. Interspersed within the Cantata is a Mass setting composed by then St Dunstan&#x27;s Director of Music, Andrew Benians, and a set of Evening Canticles by the Festival&#x27;s founder, Kenneth Pont. Jeremy Summerly wrote the libretto and composed a Prologue based on plainchant attributed to St Dunstan. The delayed première of the Cantata of St Dunstan eventually took place as part of the opening concert of the 2022 Festival, in the presence of the Lord Lieutenant of East Sussex.

<doc id="343968" wikidata="Q1195543" url="?curid=343968" title="TVB">
<text>Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB; ) is a television broadcasting company based in Hong Kong. The company operates five free-to-air terrestrial television channels in Hong Kong, with TVB Jade as its main Cantonese language service, and TVB Pearl as its main English service. TVB is headquartered at TVB City at the Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate.

TVB commenced broadcasting on 19 November 1967. The company was incorporated on 26 July 1965 and was co-founded by Sir Run Run Shaw, who was chairman from 1980 to 2012, together with Sir Douglas Clague and Harold Lee Hsiao-wo of the Lee Hysan family. When TVB first began broadcasting it was commonly known and promoted as &quot;Wireless Television&quot; () in Chinese to distinguish it from the then cable television broadcaster, Rediffusion Television (), which later became ATV (). It is still usually referred to with that name, although ATV later switched to &quot;wireless&quot; (free-to-air) broadcasting as well.

TVB is known primarily for its dramas, and produces the Miss Hong Kong and Miss Chinese International pageants. It has historically been the leading television broadcaster in Hong Kong.

==History==
=== Origins ===
The government set up a working party in the early 1960s to study the idea of setting up a second television station in Hong Kong, where the only television at that time was the wired, subscription-supported Rediffusion Television. There was debate as to whether the second station should be set up as a Crown corporation, like the BBC; a purely commercial enterprise; or a combination of the two. Another challenge lay in procuring enough content for the new station. In 1962, Director of Information Services J. L. Murray stated that while English programming could be purchased from other countries, &quot;no country is producing a mass of suitable pre-recorded material in Chinese&quot;. Even though Hong Kong was already regarded as a centre for film production, it was considered a challenge to source enough Chinese-language content for another television station, as most of it would need to be produced in Hong Kong.

Regardless, there was commercial interest in the concept. A government franchise for a new wireless (free-to-air) television station was opened for tenders on 6 February 1965 and closed on 6 August 1965. On 25 January 1966 it was announced that Television Broadcasts Limited had won the franchise.

=== Opening ===
The new Television Broadcasts Limited station at 77 Broadcast Drive in Kowloon Tong, Kowloon was officially opened by Governor David Trench on 19 November 1967. The governor spoke of the potential for television to better society, stating that the new station would play a significant role in &quot;helping and enlighting our people&quot;, calling television &quot;one of the most potent means of disseminating information there is&quot;.

The first images shown on the station were a live transmission of the Macau Grand Prix, which began broadcasting at 9:00 am that day and was interrupted by footage of the opening of the new station. The first colour broadcast was then made, a feature called &quot;London Calling Hongkong&quot; which constituted greetings from former governors Alexander Grantham and Robert Black. Following this was a piano recital by Chiu Yee-ha, who had also performed at the opening of the Hong Kong City Hall.

The new station broadcast both Cantonese-language and English-language channels. The Cantonese channel, called TVB Jade, began regular service on 4:30 pm that day on Channel 21, while the English service (TVB Pearl) began at 6:00 pm on Channel 25. The inaugural programming lineup included &quot;Enjoy Yourself Tonight&quot;, a Chinese language variety show, and &quot;Meet The Press&quot;, an English current affairs programme.

=== Infrastructure development ===
Hong Kong&#x27;s mountainous topography posed a challenge to TVB, which was Hong Kong&#x27;s first television station broadcast wirelessly, using a terrestrial television transmitter instead of a complex coaxial cable network. A network of transmitters, built atop various mountains, helped provide coverage to the territory. The main transmitter was built at Temple Hill, above Kowloon, to reach most of the main populated centre of Hong Kong as well as parts of the New Territories. Two broadcast relay stations were came into operation on 15 May 1968: one at Lamma Island expanded coverage to Pok Fu Lam, Aberdeen, Repulse Bay, and parts of Stanley, while another at Castle Peak covered Tuen Mun, Yuen Long, and Ping Shan.

A third booster station, located on Cloudy Hill, was activated in June 1968 and brought TVB reception to Fanling, Taipo, and Sheung Shui.

== Development ==
* TVB receives praise for its programming from a wide range of demographics, including the middle class, as was the case with its 2004 historical drama series &quot;War and Beauty&quot;. Its programme line-up features a steady stream of soap operas, variety shows and other populist fare.
* TVB has been criticised for signing exclusive contracts with many local celebrities which restrict them from appearing on other local television stations. Hong Kong Cable Television claims it is unfair competition (although Asia Television, another major television station in Hong Kong, disagrees). In fact, many artists do not have exclusive contracts with TVB and are free to show up in programmes produced by other local television stations or out-sourcing production houses.
* The annual TVB Music Awards ceremony is one of the biggest for Cantopop personalities. It is widely rumoured that TVB distributes the awards to those who are obedient to the company&#x27;s demands, and the Independent Commission Against Corruption has investigated the arrangement of the awards.

== Location ==
TVB was originally located on Broadcast Drive in Kowloon Tong, and was neighbours with RTHK and ATV. By the late 1980s, the company had out-grown the facility at Broadcast Drive, and built a new studio complex, named T.V. City, at 220 Clear Water Bay Road in November 1988. The first TVB City was in fact the old Shaw Movie Town complex used by Shaw Brothers since 1958. The old Broadcast Drive headquarters was later converted into apartments. The first TVB City is now used by Celestial Pictures.

To cope with future development and expansion, TVB began planning in 1998 to develop a replacement facility at the Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate. The new HK$2.2 billion TVB City came into full operation in October 2003. The new headquarters are built on by far the largest piece of land ever leased by the then Hong Kong Industrial Estates Corporation and the first service-providing company in the area. It has a building area of over 110,000 square metres, 30% more than that of the previous facilities at Clear Water Bay. Studio 1 in TVB City, which can seat an audience of six hundred and thirty, is the largest television production studio among commercial television stations in Asia.

== News operation ==
TVB broadcasts several news programmes, such as News at 6:30 (Jade) and News at 7:30 (Pearl). It also operates its own news channel, TVBN. () and TVBN2 (), through TVB Network Vision ().

== Controversy and criticism ==
Since the 4 June rally in 2009, TVB has been increasingly criticised for its pro-China bias. Netizens of HKGolden and LIHKG have called it &quot;CCTVB&quot;, as a reference to China&#x27;s state-controlled broadcaster CCTV.

During the 2014 and 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, TVB&#x27;s programmes, most especially its news reports were accused of providing biased coverage of the protests, with a pro-China slant. As a result of public boycotts, numerous brands officially pulled out of advertising contracts with TVB, including Pocari Sweat and Pizza Hut.

A group of TVB shareholders issued a public letter addressed to the board of directors of TVB in 2023, accusing TVB of misleading its shareholders on the official name of the company that holds executive power; investment failure in SMI and State Reserve Energy Bonds, which resulted in a loss of $HK1bn for the company. It also questioned the company&#x27;s investment on its eCommerce platform &quot;Ztore&quot; as the online platform requires improvement and investment in logistics and warehouse, &quot;Sales of &#x27;Ztore&#x27; increased as it placed a lot of ads on TVB, however this might result in huge loss for TVB.

, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated TVB to be &quot;Captured Private Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

<text>A medium bomber is a military bomber aircraft designed to operate with medium-sized bombloads over medium range distances; the name serves to distinguish this type from larger heavy bombers and smaller light bombers. Mediums generally carried about two tons of bombs, compared to light bombers that carried one ton, and heavies that carried four or more.

The term was used prior to and during World War II, based on available parameters of engine and aeronautical technology for bomber aircraft designs at that time. After the war, medium bombers were replaced in world air forces by more advanced and capable aircraft.

==History==
In the early 1930s many air forces were looking to modernize their existing bomber aircraft fleets, which frequently consisted of older biplanes. The new designs were typically twin-engined monoplanes, often of all-metal construction, and optimized for high enough performance and speed to help evade rapidly evolving fighter aircraft designs of the time. Some of these bombers, such as the Heinkel He 111, Junkers Ju 86, Savoia-Marchetti SM.79, Douglas B-18, and Armstrong Whitworth Whitley were developed from or in conjunction with existing airliners or transport aircraft.

The World War II-era medium bomber was generally considered to be any level bomber design that delivered about of ordnance over ranges of about . Typical heavy bombers were those with a nominal load of or more, and light bombers carried up to 2,000 lb (907 kg).

These distinctions were beginning to disappear by the middle of World War II, when the average fighter aircraft could now carry a 2,000 lb (907 kg) bombload. Advances in powerplants and designs eventually allowed light bombers, tactical bombers, and later jet fighter-bombers to take over the roles performed by mediums.

After the war, use of the term generally vanished; some of this was due to mass demobilization of the participant air forces&#x27; existing equipment, and the fact that several of the most-produced medium bomber types were now technologically obsolescent. Although a number of later aircraft were designed in this performance and load-carrying range, they were henceforth referred to as tactical bombers or strike aircraft instead. Examples of post-war mediums include the English Electric Canberra (along with its derived U.S. counterpart, the Martin B-57) and the Soviet Ilyushin Il-28 &quot;Beagle&quot;.

Subsequent to World War II, only the U.S. Strategic Air Command ever used the term &quot;medium bomber&quot; in the 1950s to distinguish its Boeing B-47 Stratojets from somewhat larger contemporary Boeing B-52 Stratofortress &quot;heavy bombers&quot; in bombardment wings (older B-29 and B-50 heavy bombers were also redesignated as &quot;medium&quot; during this period). This nomenclature was purely semantic and bureaucratic, however as both the B-47 and B-52 strategic bombers were much larger and had far greater performance and load-carrying ability than any of the World War II-era heavy or medium bombers. Similarly, the Royal Air Force referred at times to its V bomber force as medium bombers, but this was in terms of range rather than load-carrying capacity.

Although the term is no longer used, development of aircraft that fulfil a &#x27;medium bomber&#x27; mission in all but name continued and these have been employed in various post-World War II conflicts; examples include dedicated tactical bombers such as the Su-24, Su-34, F-111, J-16 and F-15E which have greater payload and range capability than fighter-bombers, but less than heavier strategic bombers.
