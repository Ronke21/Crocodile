<text>Harriet Ruth Harman, Baroness Harman, (born 30 July 1950), is a British politician and solicitor who served as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and Chair of the Labour Party from 2007 to 2015 and Leader of the House of Commons and Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal from 2007 to 2010. She also briefly served as Leader of the Opposition in 2010 and 2015 after the resignations of Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband respectively. She was Member of Parliament (MP) for Camberwell and Peckham (formerly Peckham) from 1982 to 2024, during which time she held various Cabinet and Shadow Cabinet positions, and was appointed to the House of Lords as a life peer in 2024.

Born in London to a doctor and a barrister, Harman was privately educated at St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School before going on to study politics at the University of York. After working for Brent Law Centre, she became a legal officer for the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL), a role in which she was found in contempt of court following action pursued by Michael Havers, a former Attorney General. She successfully took a case, &quot;Harman v United Kingdom&quot;, to the European Court of Human Rights, which found that Havers had breached her right to freedom of expression.

Harman was elected as MP for Peckham at a 1982 by-election. She was made a shadow social services minister in 1984 and a shadow health minister in 1987. Under John Smith, she was Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury and, under Tony Blair, as Shadow Employment Secretary, Shadow Health Secretary and Shadow Social Security Secretary respectively. Following the 1997 general election victory, she was appointed Secretary of State for Social Security and the first ever Minister for Women, until 1998 when she left the Cabinet. In 2001, she was appointed Solicitor General for England and Wales, until 2005 when she became Minister of State for Constitutional Affairs. She ran in the 2007 deputy leadership election and defeated five other candidates, ultimately defeating health secretary Alan Johnson, by a narrow margin. Gordon Brown, who was elected as party leader, appointed her Leader of the House of Commons, Lord Privy Seal, Minister for Women and Equality and Chairman of the Labour Party.

Upon defeat at the 2010 general election, Brown resigned as party leader and Harman, as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, became the acting leader of the Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition until the election of Ed Miliband. She subsequently served as Shadow Deputy Prime Minister, combining the position with that of Shadow International Development Secretary from 2010 to 2011 and then Shadow Culture, Media and Sport Secretary from 2011 to 2015. In 2014, Harman expressed regret after it was revealed that the Paedophile Information Exchange had affiliated status within the NCCL while she had been legal officer. Following Labour&#x27;s defeat at the 2015 general election, Miliband resigned as Leader of the Labour Party and Harman again became acting party leader and Leader of the Opposition. She also resigned as deputy leader, prompting a concurrent deputy leadership election. Harman stood down as an MP at the 2024 general election and was appointed to the House of Lords later that year.

==Early life and career==
Harriet Ruth Harman was born at 108 Harley Street in London, and privately educated at St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School. She is a daughter of John Bishop Harman, a Harley Street doctor, and his wife Anna , a barrister, who gave up practising when she had children and who was the Liberal Party candidate for Hertford in the 1964 general election. They both had non-conformist backgrounds – Harman&#x27;s paternal grandfather Nathaniel Bishop Harman, an ophthalmic surgeon, was a prominent Unitarian and the Spicer family were well-known Congregationalists. Her paternal aunt was Elizabeth Pakenham, Countess of Longford (née Harman), the wife of former Labour minister Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford, and her cousins include the writers Lady Antonia Fraser, Lady Rachel Billington and Thomas Pakenham, Earl of Longford. Her great-grandfather was Arthur Chamberlain, an industrialist. Harman is a great-great-niece of the Liberal statesman Joseph Chamberlain, and is a cousin once removed of former prime minister Neville Chamberlain and former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain. She is also related to Liberal politician Richard Chamberlain, MP. Through her uncle Lord Pakenham she is related by marriage to former prime minister David Cameron, whom she faced as Leader of the Opposition. Her cousin Rachel Billington is also godmother to former prime minister Boris Johnson.

Harman gained a 2:1 BA in Politics from the University of York. During her time at York, she was a member of Goodricke College and was involved with student politics. After York, Harman went on to qualify as a solicitor and worked for Brent Law Centre in London. Between 1978 and 1982, she was employed as a legal officer for the National Council for Civil Liberties. In this capacity, and just before becoming MP for Peckham in a by-election in 1982, she represented a prisoner who was kept in solitary confinement against the Home Office. However, she was found in contempt of court for sharing documents she had read aloud in the courtroom with a journalist. The contempt of court action was pursued by Michael Havers, a former Attorney General for England and Wales. Harman was thus the subject of numerous parliamentary questions and debates before she became an MP, including at a PMQ in February 1982. Harman subsequently took the case to the European Court of Human Rights, successfully arguing Havers had breached her right to freedom of expression. The case is considered a significant case in British public law.

Harman was later involved in a European Court of Human Rights case against MI5. During a 1984 television interview by Cathy Massiter, it was revealed personal files were held by MI5 on Harman and on the (by then former) General Secretary of the NCCL, Patricia Hewitt. They successfully argued that there had been an infringement of their rights because MI5 was not a legally constituted and democratically accountable organisation, this being the minimum standard in democracy. The success of the case led to enactment of the Security Service Act 1989.

==Opposition Member of Parliament==
Harry Lamborn, the Labour MP for Peckham, died on 21 August 1982. In the subsequent by-election held on 28 October 1982, Harman was elected to succeed Lamborn with 11,349 votes (50.34%), a majority of 3,931 over Social Democratic candidate Dick Taverne, a former Labour MP for Lincoln. The Conservative Party candidate was John Redwood, who came third, and went on to be elected MP for Wokingham in 1987.

In 1984, Harman became a Shadow Social Services minister and served as a Shadow Health minister in 1987. Following the 1992 general election she entered the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury (1992–1994) and later served as Shadow Employment Secretary (1994–1995), Shadow Health Secretary (1995–1996) and Shadow Social Security Secretary (1996–1997).

==Labour in Government==

===Under Tony Blair===
Following Labour&#x27;s victory in the 1997 general election, she became Secretary of State for Social Security and the first ever Minister for Women. She was given the task of reforming the Welfare State. During this time, her more notable policies included introducing a minimum income guarantee and winter fuel payments for the elderly. It was later ruled that the fuel payments policy breached European sex discrimination laws in that men had to wait five years longer to receive them than women. The policy was amended so both sexes qualified at age 60. She also headed up New Labour&#x27;s controversial cut to single parent benefit despite the majority of those affected being women. There was public outcry at this perceived attacked on the living standards of some of the poorest women and children. According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, a group of women protesters shouted &quot;Labour scum&quot; as the measure was approved in Parliament – albeit with a rebellion of 47 Labour MPs and the abstention of many others. Harman was sacked from the position in 1998. According to many in the media, this was the result of a series of public rows with junior minister Frank Field, though others also cited her decision to cut benefits to lone parents as a factor. Harman voted with the party on all but a few instances during its period in government.

Harman made a return to the front bench following the 2001 general election, with her appointment to the office of Solicitor General, thus becoming the first female Solicitor General. In accordance with convention, she was appointed as Queen&#x27;s Counsel, although she had previously had no rights of audience in the higher courts, did not obtain them and never presented a case during her time as Solicitor General, or at all.

Following the 2005 general election, she became a Minister of State in the Department for Constitutional Affairs with responsibilities including constitutional reform, legal aid and court processes and she represented Lord Falconer in the House of Commons on the frontbench.

On 16 March 2006, Harman relinquished her ministerial responsibilities for electoral administration and reform of the House of Lords. She stated that this was to avoid any potential conflict of interest after her husband Jack Dromey, the Treasurer of the Labour Party, announced that he would be investigating a number of loans made to the Labour Party that had not been disclosed to party officers. She retained her other responsibilities.

====Deputy Leadership election====
Harman announced her intention to stand for Deputy Leadership of the Labour Party when John Prescott stood down. She commissioned an opinion poll which found that she would be the most electorally popular potential deputy leader, a point she used in her campaign.

While she supported the Iraq War, during the Deputy Leadership campaign, she said that she would not have done so had she known about the lack of concrete evidence of weapons of mass destruction.

Harman did not have the support of any major unions, and helped to fund her campaign by taking out a personal loan of £10,000 and a £40,000 extension to her mortgage. Harman failed to report some donations and loans on time, and was subject to an Electoral Commission inquiry for breaches of electoral law. The commission said that her &quot;failure to report on time is a serious matter&quot; though the case was not handed over to the police.

On 24 June 2007, in a close contest Harman was elected Deputy Leader. Alan Johnson had led in all but the first of the previous rounds, but when second-preference votes had been redistributed after the fourth round, Harman as elected with 50.43% of the vote to Johnson&#x27;s 49.56%

====Campaign donations====

In November 2007, it emerged that property developer David Abrahams&#x27; secretary Janet Kidd had donated £5,000 to Harman&#x27;s successful deputy leadership bid. After an investigation by &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; newspaper into other donations made by people associated with Abrahams, and Prime Minister Gordon Brown&#x27;s assertion that all such monies would be returned, Harman issued a statement saying she accepted the donation on 4 July &quot;in good faith,&quot; had registered the monies with the Electoral Commission and the Register of Members&#x27; Interests, and that she &quot;was not aware of any funding arrangements... between David Abrahams and Janet Kidd&quot;.

===Under Gordon Brown===
Harman was known as a long-term supporter of Gordon Brown and is regarded as a personal friend. On 28 June 2007, after she became Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and Brown was appointed prime minister, Harman joined Brown&#x27;s Cabinet as Leader of the House of Commons, Lord Privy Seal and Minister for Women and Equality, and was also Chairman of the Labour Party. Unlike the previous Deputy Leader, John Prescott, Harman was not made Deputy Prime Minister.

When Harman, as Leader of the House of Commons, stood in for Gordon Brown during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions on Wednesday 2 April 2008 (due to the Prime Minister attending a NATO summit in Romania), she became the first female Labour Minister to take Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions. She subsequently repeated this during Brown&#x27;s absences.

Harman attacked the Conservative Party at the Labour Party Conference 2007, referring to them as the &quot;nasty party&quot; and suggesting that there would be little competition at the next election.

On 1 April 2008 the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; reported that Harman had decided to wear a kevlar-reinforced stab vest while touring her Peckham constituency under police guard. On 2 April &quot;The Guardian&quot; relayed information from the Metropolitan Police that &quot;the type of Met Vest she wore over her jacket protected her from knife attacks and bullets, and, for her at least, was optional&quot;. Harman compared the decision to wearing a hard hat while touring a building site, which led the BBC&#x27;s John Humphrys to respond, during an interview for BBC Radio 4, &quot;You wear a hard hat on a building site because... there is the danger that something might drop on your head. You don&#x27;t need to wear a bullet-proof vest on the streets of London, do you!&quot; Harman told the BBC that the neighbourhood police team she was with put on their stab vests and gave her one to wear as well.

In April 2008, Harman&#x27;s blog was hacked and changed to state that she had joined the Conservative Party. Harman later admitted when questioned by &quot;Sky News&quot; that the incident was a result of her using &quot;Harriet&quot; and &quot;Harman&quot; as her username and password. The hacker was Conservative Kemi Badenoch, who was elected as MP for Saffron Walden in 2017. Badenoch confessed to the hacking in an April 2018 interview with &quot;Core Politics&quot; and later offered Harman an apology, which she accepted.

===Use of statistics===
During the late-2000s recession, and following a government report which suggested that women were twice as likely to lose their jobs as men and feared losing their jobs more than men, Harman stated: &quot;We will not allow women to become the victims of this recession&quot;. However, some statistics contradicted her position, including the Office for National Statistics report on the issue which stated &quot;the economic downturn in 2008 has impacted less on women in employment than men&quot;. According to the ONS, men were losing their jobs at twice the rate of women. The Government Equalities Office insisted the ONS figures did not render pointless its efforts to help women.

In June 2009, Sir Michael Scholar, head of the UK Statistics Authority, wrote to Harman to warn her that different headline figures used by the ONS and Government Equalities Office with regards to pay differentiation between men and women might undermine public trust in official statistics. The GEO&#x27;s headline figure was 23%, which was based on median hourly earnings of all employees, not the 12.8%, based on median hourly earnings of full-time employees only, used by the ONS. Scholar wrote: &quot;It is the Statistics Authority&#x27;s view that use of the 23% on its own, without qualification, risks giving a misleading quantification of the gender pay gap&quot;.

===Expenses===
In January 2009, Harman proposed a rule change to exempt MPs&#x27; expenses from the Freedom of Information Act. Her parliamentary order aimed to remove &quot;most expenditure information held by either House of Parliament from the scope of the Freedom of Information Act&quot;. It meant that, under the law, journalists and members of the public would no longer be entitled to learn details of their MP&#x27;s expenses. Labour MPs were to be pressured to vote for this measure by use of a three line whip. Her proposal was withdrawn when the Conservative Party said they would vote against, and in light of an online campaign by mySociety. The failure of the motion led to the disclosure of expenses of British members of parliament.

In December 2010, it emerged that Harman was amongst 40 MPs who had secretly repaid wrongly claimed expenses between 2008 and 2010. In November 2010, Harman&#x27;s parliamentary private secretary Ian Lavery had blocked a motion designed to allow the repayments to be made public.

=== Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 ===

Harman allegedly blocked a series of votes to liberalise Britain&#x27;s abortion laws via the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill (now Act). The pro-choice amendments proposed by Diane Abbott MP, Katy Clark MP and John McDonnell MP included NC30 Amendment of the Abortion Act 1967: Application to Northern Ireland. It was reported that the Labour Government at the time asked MPs not to table these pro-choice amendments (and at least until Third Reading) and then allegedly used parliamentary mechanisms in order to prevent a vote accordingly.

===Equality Bill===

As part of a proposed Equality Bill, Harman announced a consultation on changing the existing discrimination laws, including options for reverse discrimination in employment. Under the proposals, employers would be legally allowed to discriminate in favour of a job candidate on the basis of their race or gender where the candidates were otherwise equally qualified. Employers would not be required to use these powers, but would be able to do so without the threat of legal action for discriminatory practices. The white paper also proposed measures to end age discrimination, promote transparency in organisations and introduce a new equality duty on the public sector.

It was argued by critics that these changes could face a challenge under Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, race, colour, language, religion and on several other criteria. Michael Millar, writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, was of the opinion that &quot;the Equality Bill before parliament today gives employers the right to choose an ethnic minority candidate or female candidate over a white male, specifically because they are an ethnic minority or female.&quot;

Harman also commissioned a report on allowing political parties to draw up all-black shortlists designed to increase the number of black MPs in Westminster. A further report proposed extended the arrangement allowing all-women shortlists beyond 2015 which will fail to have any impact in the 2010 general election. These proposals are supported by members of the three major parties, though no others allow discrimination in their shortlists. Inside the Labour Party, Harman has said she does &quot;not agree with all-male leaderships&quot; because men &quot;cannot be left to run things on their own&quot;; and that, consequently, one of Labour&#x27;s top two posts should always be held by a woman. She had also stated that the collapse of Lehman Brothers might have been averted had it been &#x27;Lehman Sisters&#x27;. These comments caused accusations of sexism and &quot;insidious bigotry&quot;.

==Return to Opposition==

Following the resignation of Gordon Brown as prime minister and Leader of the Labour Party on 11 May 2010, Harman automatically became the temporary leader of the party as well as the Leader of the Opposition, entitling her to the salary and government car that come with the role. Although she was informally described in the media as &#x27;Acting&#x27; Leader, she was fully Leader by the terms of the party&#x27;s constitution, albeit on a temporary basis, as was the case with Margaret Beckett in 1994.

Following Brown&#x27;s resignation, she quickly announced that she would remain Deputy Leader rather than standing for election as Leader. Her only public explanation was the assertion that: &quot;You can&#x27;t run for leader at the same time as being deputy leader&quot;.

She nominated Diane Abbott, MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, to prevent the election from being all male. But she nonetheless asserted her intention to remain neutral throughout the contest and said, &quot;This is a very crucial period and we have got five fantastic candidates. All of them would make excellent leaders of the party.&quot;

Following Ed Miliband&#x27;s election as leader, she returned to her role as Deputy Leader, shadowing Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister and with the title of Deputy Leader of the Opposition. When Miliband assigned portfolios on 8 October 2010, he appointed her Shadow Secretary of State for International Development. In 2010, Harman referred to Danny Alexander as a &quot;ginger rodent&quot; in a speech to the Labour Party conference. This was greeted with cheers and laughter from the conference, but the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party described them as gingerism and &quot;anti-Scottish&quot;. Harman apologised for the offence caused. In 2011, Harman was moved to become Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. In 2014, she accused Nick Clegg of turning into a Tory during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions.

===Paedophilia support allegations and age of consent scandal ===
In March 2014, an article from the Daily Mail exposed that a 1979 letter from paedophile group supporter contained Ms Harman&#x27;s initials. Harman denied allegations that she had supported the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) when the advocacy group was affiliated with Liberty, while she was the pressure group&#x27;s Legal Officer from 1978 to 1982. Both the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; also claimed that Jack Dromey MP (her partner) and former Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt had offered support to apologists for the sexual abuse of children while they were working for NCCL. &quot;The Guardian&quot; also states that in an NCCL briefing note dated 1978, Harman urged amendments to a 1978 Child Protection Bill declaring that &quot;images of children should only be considered pornographic if it could be proven the subject suffered&quot;, which Harman says was an argument intended to protect from &quot;unintended consequences&quot; such as parents being prosecuted for taking pictures of their children on the beach or in the bath.
Most of the controversy comes after the NCCL passed motion 39 in support of PIE&#x27;s rights.

Motion 39 stated: 
In a television interview, Harman said she had &quot;nothing to apologise for,&quot; stating: &quot;I very much regret that this vile organisation, PIE, ever existed and that it ever had anything to do with NCCL, but it did not affect my work at NCCL.&quot; Harman stated that while she did support the equalisation of the age of consent for gay men she had never campaigned for the age of consent to go below the age of 16 and accused the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; of trying to make her &quot;guilty by way of association&quot;. Ed Miliband backed Harman and stated that she had &quot;huge decency and integrity&quot;.

===2015 general election===
In the 2015 general election, Harman lead the Woman to Woman campaign involved a pink battle bus visiting constituencies. Following the poor election result and Ed Miliband&#x27;s resignation, Harman again became acting leader of the Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition after announcing she would stand down from the role once a leadership election had taken place. While interim leader, she made the decision for Labour to abstain, rather than oppose, the Welfare Reform and Work Bill 2015, leading to 48 Labour MPs defying the whip. Harman also made the decision that Labour would vote for having a European Union membership referendum, reversing Labour&#x27;s pre-election opposition to an EU referendum. After standing down, she became Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights in October 2015.

As the holder of the record as longest-ever continuously serving female MP in the House of Commons, Harman was dubbed the &quot;Mother of the House&quot; by Prime Minister Theresa May on 13 June 2017.

On 10 September 2019, Harman announced that she would stand to be the next Speaker of the House of Commons following the announcement by the current Speaker John Bercow of his intention to resign on 31 October 2019. She withdrew from the vote after the second ballot, having the lowest votes of all of the surviving candidates.

In December 2021, Harman announced she would be stepping down as an MP at the 2024 general election.

===View on S&amp;M===

Harman supported an amendment to the Domestic Abuse Bill 2019 to implement the verdict of &quot;R v Brown&quot;. &quot;R v Brown&quot; revisited the conviction of the earlier Operation Spanner, in which five men were convicted of engaging in homosexual sadomasochistic practices with consensual partners. Operation Spanner occurred in the 1980s and had been since criticised for its attitudes towards homosexuality. &quot;R v Brown&quot; re-affirmed that adults cannot consent to actual bodily harm. The changes would prevent use of the rough sex murder defence, believing people should be prosecuted for murder even if they did not intend to kill their partners.

Harman wrote to the Attorney General to complain about an unduly lenient sentence of a man whose partner died while engaging in erotic strangulation. The sentence had been reduced from seven years to four years eight months in light of the man&#x27;s guilty plea and self-referral to the police.
===Investigation into Boris Johnson===
Harman chaired the Privileges Committee of the House of Commons over the investigation into Boris Johnson&#x27;s breach of lockdown rules during the COVID-19 pandemic, concerning four specific assertions made by the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions about &quot;the legality of activities in 10 Downing Street and the Cabinet Office under Covid regulations&quot;, events commonly referred to as Partygate. The investigation is concerned with whether Johnson misled the Commons when he made these statements.

The Committee published their final report on 15 June. Johnson resigned over the investigation after having been sent a draft copy of the committee&#x27;s report. The Committee had voted on the final report text and unanimously supported it. They concluded that Johnson had deliberately misled the House, a contempt of Parliament. They said that, had he still been an MP, they would have recommended a 90 day suspension. If that had happened, it would have been the second longest suspension since 1949.

The Committee concluded that Johnson&#x27;s actions were &quot;more serious&quot; because they were committed when he was prime minister. They noted that there was no precedent for a PM being found to have deliberately misled Parliament. The report stated that Johnson tried to &quot;rewrite the meaning&quot; of COVID rules &quot;to fit his own evidence&quot; for example that &quot;a leaving gathering or a gathering to boost morale was a lawful reason to hold a gathering.&quot; They concluded he was guilty of further contempts of Parliament and that he breached confidentiality requirements by criticising the Committee&#x27;s provisional findings when he resigned. They said he was complicit in a &quot;campaign of abuse&quot; against those investigating him.

The Commons debated the report on 19 June 2023. Labour forced a vote and the Commons voted 354 to 7 in support, with a large number of abstentions. This was an absolute majority of the Commons. 118 Conservative MPs, including 15 ministers, voted for the report and 225 abstained. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had earlier said he had other commitments, and did not attend the debate and refused to say how he would have voted.

==Peerage==
After standing down as an MP, Harman was nominated for a life peerage in the 2024 Dissolution Honours. She was created &quot;Baroness Harman, of Peckham in the London Borough of Southwark&quot;, on 19 August 2024. In 2025, Harman proposed an amendment to Labour&#x27;s House of Lords (Hereditary Peers) Bill that would mandate the government to introduce proposals to remove the right for 26 Church of England bishops to sit in the Lords &quot;ex officio&quot; as Lords Spiritual. This amendment is in line with Labour&#x27;s manifesto commitment to proceed with wider reforms of the upper chamber.

== In popular culture ==
Harman was portrayed by Deborah Findlay in the 2015 Channel 4 television film &quot;Coalition&quot;.

==Personal life==
Harman married Jack Dromey in 1982 in Brent, after meeting him on the picket line of the Grunwick dispute in 1977; she was legal advisor to the Grunwick Strike Committee. They had three children: Harry (born February 1983), Joseph (born November 1984) and Amy (born January 1987). Harry and Amy have Harman&#x27;s surname. Labour colleague Patricia Hewitt is godmother to one of her children. She sent Harry to the grant-maintained Roman Catholic London Oratory School and Joseph to the state selective St Olave&#x27;s Grammar School, Orpington.

Harman has owned a number of houses and properties, including her home in Herne Hill, south London and a house in Suffolk.

Harman is a committed feminist, having said, &quot;I am in the Labour Party because I am a feminist. I am in the Labour Party because I believe in equality.&quot; In 2017, her book &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Work&quot; was published. It is her personal examination of women&#x27;s progressive politics over the last thirty years.

In late 1988, Harman was absent from the Commons for some time and on 26 December it was reported that she was suffering pneumonia brought on by psittacosis.

In 2012, Harman was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Southwark.

===Motoring convictions===
In 2003, Harman was fined £400 and banned from driving for seven days after being convicted of driving at on a motorway, above the speed limit.

In 2007, Harman was issued with a £60 fixed penalty notice and given three penalty points on her licence for driving at in a temporary zone. Harman paid the fine several months late and avoided appearing at Ipswich magistrates court. Harman was again caught breaking the speed limit the following April, this time in a 30 mph zone, receiving a further 3 points on her driving licence.

In January 2010 Harman pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention in relation to an incident on 3 July 2009 where she struck another vehicle whilst driving using a mobile phone, she admitted the offence in court. Harman was fined £350, ordered to pay £70 costs, a £15 victim surcharge and had three points added to her licence. Road safety organisation Brake criticised the leniency of the punishment and decision to drop the charge of driving whilst using a mobile phone. The judge defended the decision stating: &quot;Ms Harman&#x27;s guilty plea to driving without due care and attention included her admitting that she had been using a mobile phone at the time&quot;.

<text>Macrina the Younger (; c. 327 – 19 July 379) was an early Christian consecrated virgin. Macrina was elder sister of Basil the Great, Gregory of Nyssa, Naucratius and Peter of Sebaste. Gregory of Nyssa wrote a work entitled &quot;Life of Macrina&quot; in which he describes her sanctity and asceticism throughout her life. Macrina lived a chaste and humble life, devoting her time to prayer and the spiritual education of her younger brother Peter.

She is regarded as a saint in the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Anglican churches.

==Family==
Macrina was born at Caesarea, Cappadocia. Her parents were Basil the Elder and Emmelia, and her grandmother was Macrina the Elder. Among her nine siblings were two of the three Cappadocian Fathers, her younger brothers Basil the Great and Gregory of Nyssa, as well as Peter of Sebaste and the famous Christian jurist Naucratius. Her father arranged for her to marry, but her fiancé died before the wedding. After having been betrothed, Macrina did not believe it was appropriate to marry another man, but saw Christ as her eternal bridegroom. 

Macrina had a profound influence on her brothers and her mother with her adherence to an ascetic ideal. In Gregory of Nyssa&#x27;s &quot;Life of Macrina&quot; he remembers her as a child who was devoted to study of the scriptures, especially the Wisdom of Solomon, and those parts of it which have an ethical bearing, &quot;such parts as you would think were incomprehensible to young children were the subject of the girl&#x27;s studies&quot;.

Macrina, who resolved never to leave her mother, moved with her to one of their rural estates and lived within a community of virgins who came from both an aristocratic and a non-aristocratic background. All members were free, and slaves got the same rights and obligations as their masters. The death of the brother Naucratius shocked her mother and gave to Macrina a priority role in the domestic life.

In 379, Macrina died at her family&#x27;s estate in Pontus, which with the help of her younger brother Peter she had turned into a convent of virgins. Gregory of Nyssa composed a &quot;Dialogue on the Soul and Resurrection&quot; &quot;(peri psyches kai anastaseos)&quot;, entitled &quot;ta Makrinia&quot; (P.G. XLVI, 12 sq.), to commemorate Macrina, in which Gregory purports to describe the conversation he had with the dying Macrina, in a literary form modelled on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedo&quot;. Even when dying, Macrina continued to live a life of sanctity, as she refused a bed, and instead chose to lie on the ground. Her feast day is 19 July.

==Legacy==
Macrina is significant in that she set the standard for being a holy Early Christian woman. She contributed to her brother&#x27;s writings and his belief that virginity reflected the &quot;radiant purity of God&quot;.

Universalists, including Thomas Allin and J. W. Hanson, claim Macrina as a committed universalist, citing passages from the &quot;Dialogue on the Soul and Resurrection&quot; which they believe demonstrate her conviction that all sinners and demons will at last be purified and confess Christ. This claim to her Universalism is questionable, due to her plea for Election to Salvation at the end of her life. This suggests a more nuanced Eschatology, such as the Universal Reconciliation of Maximus the Confessor.

Macrina is honored in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 19 July.

<doc id="354366" wikidata="Q1002812" url="?curid=354366" title="Metropolitan borough">
<text>A metropolitan borough (or metropolitan district) is a type of local government district in England. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts within metropolitan counties. All of the metropolitan districts have been granted or regranted royal charters giving them borough status (and in some cases, they also have city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. Metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as local enterprise partnerships and combined authorities and combined county authorities, with most of the latter having a directly elected metropolitan mayor.

==History==
===London metropolitan boroughs (1900–1965)===
The term &quot;metropolitan borough&quot; was first used for administrative subdivisions of the County of London between 1900 and 1965. There were 28 of these metropolitan boroughs, which were replaced by a new system of larger London boroughs in 1965, when the County of London was replaced by Greater London.

===Current metropolitan boroughs===
The current metropolitan boroughs originated as metropolitan districts created in 1974 as subdivisions of new metropolitan counties, created to cover the six largest urban areas in England outside Greater London. The new districts replaced the previous system of county boroughs, municipal boroughs, and urban and rural districts.

Metropolitan districts were originally parts of a two-tier structure of local government, and shared power with metropolitan county councils. They differed from non-metropolitan districts in the division of powers between district and county councils. Metropolitan districts were local education authorities, and were also responsible for social services and libraries. In non-metropolitan counties these services were (and are) the responsibility of county councils.

Many metropolitan districts were boroughs from their establishment on 1 April 1974; others gained borough status later.

In 1986 the metropolitan county councils were abolished under the Local Government Act 1985 and most of their functions were devolved to the metropolitan boroughs, making them, to a large extent, unitary authorities in all but name. At the same time some of the functions of the abolished metropolitan county councils were taken over by joint bodies such as passenger transport authorities, and joint fire, police and waste disposal authorities.

==Metropolitan district councils==
The metropolitan districts are administered by metropolitan district councils. They are the principal local authorities in the six metropolitan counties and are responsible for running most local services, such as schools, social services, waste collection, and roads.

The 36 metropolitan boroughs are:

<text>An Olympic medal is awarded to successful competitors at one of the Olympic Games. There are three classes of medal to be won: gold, silver, and bronze, awarded to first, second, and third place, respectively. The granting of awards is laid out in detail in the Olympic protocols.

Medal designs have varied considerably since the Games in 1896, particularly in the size of the medals for the Summer Olympic Games. The design selected for the 1928 Games remained until its replacement at the 2004 Games in Athens, where the use of the Roman Colosseum was replaced by the Greek Panathenaic Stadium, appropriate to represent Olympic values. The medals of the Winter Olympic Games never had a common design, but regularly feature snowflakes and the event where the medal has been won.

In addition to generally supporting their Olympic athletes, some countries provide sums of money and gifts to medal winners, depending on the classes and number of medals won. In the 2024 Paris Games, 33 countries confirmed that they would award prizes to medallists, with 15 awarding cash prizes over $100,000.

==Introduction and early history==
The olive wreath was the prize for the winner at the Ancient Olympic Games. It was an olive branch, off the wild-olive tree that grew at Olympia, intertwined to form a circle or a horse-shoe. According to Pausanias, it was introduced by Heracles as a prize for the winner of the running race to honour Zeus.

When the modern Olympic Games began in 1896 medals started to be given to successful olympian competitors. However, gold medals were not awarded at the inaugural Olympics in 1896 in Athens, Greece. The winners were instead given a silver medal and an olive branch, whilst runners-up received a laurel branch and a copper or bronze medal. 

The 1900 Summer Olympics is unique in being the only Olympic Games to feature rectangular medals, which were designed by . Gilt silver medals were awarded for 1st place in shooting, lifesaving, automobile racing and gymnastics. Second place silver medals were awarded in shooting, rowing, yachting, tennis, gymnastics, sabre, fencing, equestrian and athletics. Third place bronze medals were awarded in gymnastics, firefighting and shooting. In many sports, however, medals were not awarded. With most of the listed prizes being cups and other trophies. 

The custom of the sequence of gold, silver, and bronze for the first three places in all events dates from the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri in the United States. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has retroactively assigned gold, silver and bronze medals to the three best-placed athletes in each event of the 1896 and 1900 Games. If there is a tie for any of the top three places all competitors are entitled to receive the appropriate medal according to IOC rules. Some combat sports (such as boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling) award two bronze medals per competition, resulting in, overall, more bronze medals being awarded than the other colours.

Medals are not the only awards given to competitors; every athlete placed first to eighth receives an Olympic diploma. Also, at the main host stadium, the names of all medal winners are written onto a wall. Finally, as noted below, all athletes receive a participation medal and diploma.

==Production and design==

The IOC dictates the physical properties of the medals and has the final decision about the finished design. Specifications for the medals are developed along with the National Olympic Committee (NOC) hosting the Games, though the IOC has brought in some set rules:
*Recipients: The top three competitors receive medals
*Shape: Usually circular, featuring an attachment for a chain or ribbon
*Diameter: A minimum of 60 mm
*Thickness: A minimum of 3 mm
*Material:
**First place (the gold medal): It is composed at least 92.5% of silver, plated with 6 grams of gold; the metal value was about US$494 in 2010. At the 2020 Summer Olympics held in 2021 in Tokyo, Japan, the medal at then-current prices was worth about $800.
**Second place (the silver medal): 92.5% silver; the metal value was about US$260 in 2010. At the Tokyo games, the medal was worth $460.
**Third place (the bronze medal): In 2010 it was 97% copper with 0.5% tin and 2.5% zinc; the metal value was about US$3 in 2010. At the Tokyo games it was 95% copper and 5% zinc with a metal value of about $5.
*Event details: The sport for which the medal has been awarded should be written on the medal.

The first Olympic medals in 1896 were designed by French sculptor Jules-Clément Chaplain and depicted Zeus holding Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, on the obverse and the Acropolis on the reverse. They were made by the Paris Mint, which also made the medals for the 1900 Olympic Games, hosted by Paris. This started the tradition of giving the responsibility of minting the medals to the host city. For the next few Olympiads, the host city also chose the medal design. Until 1912 the gold medals were made of solid gold.

===&quot;Trionfo&quot;===
In 1923 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) launched a competition for sculptors to design the medals for the Summer Olympic Games. Giuseppe Cassioli&#x27;s &quot;Trionfo&quot; design was chosen as the winner in 1928. The obverse brought back Nike but this time as the main focus, holding a winner&#x27;s crown and palm with a depiction of the Colosseum in the background. In the top right section of the medal, a space was left for the name of the Olympic host and the Games numeral. 

The reverse features a crowd of people carrying a triumphant athlete. His winning design was first presented at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. The medals for the 1960 Games in Rome inverted the design, with the obverse featuring the crowd and the reverse featuring Nike. The competition saw this design used for 40 years until the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich became the first Games with a different design for the reverse side of the medal.

Cassioli&#x27;s design continued to inspire the obverse of the medal for many more years, though recreated each time, with the Olympic host and numeral updated. The obverse remained true to the &quot;Trionfo&quot; design until the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, where the IOC allowed an updated version to be created. For the next few events , they mandated the use of the Nike motif but allowed other aspects to change.

The trend ended after 2000, due to the negative reaction to the medal design for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. The designer of the 2000 medal (Wojciech Pietranik) had originally featured the Sydney Opera House on the obverse instead of the traditional Roman Colosseum but the International Olympic Committee decided that the Colosseum should remain. The Greek press criticised the design for ignorance of the birthplace of the Olympic Games, pointing out that the long-standing feature on the front of medals was mistakenly depicting the Roman Colosseum rather than the Greek Parthenon. The Sydney Organising Committee decided to continue with the design as it was, noting that there was insufficient time to complete another version and that it would be too costly. After 76 years a new style by designer Elena Votsi depicting the Panathenaic Stadium was introduced at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. This new obverse design remains in use.

===Custom reverse designs===
The German Olympic Committee, Nationales Olympisches Komitee für Deutschland, was the first Summer Games organisers to elect to change the reverse of the medal. The 1972 design was created by Gerhard Marcks, an artist from the Bauhaus, and features mythological twins Castor and Pollux. Since then the Organising Committee of the host city has been given the freedom of the design of the reverse, with the IOC giving final approval.

===Comparison between Summer and Winter===
The IOC has the final decision on the specifications of each design for all Olympic medals, including the Summer Games, Winter Games, Summer Paralympic Games and Winter Paralympic Games. There has been a greater variety of design applications for the Winter Games; unlike with the Summer Games, the IOC never mandated one particular design. The medal at the inaugural 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix, France did not even feature the Olympic rings. Nike was featured on the medals of the 1932 and 1936 Games but has only appeared on one medal design since then. One regular motif is the use of the snowflake, while laurel leaves and crowns appear on several designs. The Olympic motto &quot;Citius, Altius, Fortius&quot; features on four Winter Games medals but does not appear on any Summer Games medal.

For three events in a row, hosts of the Winter Games included different materials in the medals: glass (1992), sparagmite (1994), and lacquer (1998). It was not until the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China that a Summer Olympic host chose to use something different, in this case, jade. While every Summer Olympic medal except for the 1900 Games has been circular, the shapes of the Winter Games have been considerably more varied. The designs for the Winter Games medals are also generally larger, thicker, and heavier than those for the Summer Games.

==Participation medals==
Since the beginning of the modern Olympics the athletes and their support staffs, event officials, and certain volunteers involved in planning and managing the games have received commemorative medals and diplomas. Like the winners&#x27; medals, these are changed for each Olympic Festival, with different ones issued for the summer and winter games.

==Presentation==

The presentation of the medals and awards varied significantly until the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles brought in what has now become standard. Before 1932 all the medals were awarded at the closing ceremony, with the athletes wearing evening dress for the first few Games. Originally the presenting dignitary was stationary while the athletes filed past to receive their medals. The victory podium was introduced upon the personal instruction in 1931 of Henri de Baillet-Latour, who had seen one used at the 1930 British Empire Games. The winner is in the middle at a higher elevation, with the silver medallist to the right and the bronze to the left. At the 1932 Winter Olympics, medals were awarded in the closing ceremony, with athletes for each event in turn mounting the first-ever podium. At the 1960 Summer Olympics, competitors in the Stadio Olimpico received their medals immediately after each event for the first time; competitors at other venues came to the Stadio Olimpico the next day to receive their medals. Later Games have had a victory podium at each competition venue.

The 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy were the first in which the medals were placed around the neck of the athletes. The medals hung from a chain of laurel leaves, while they are now hung from a coloured ribbon. When Athens hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics the competitors on the podium also received an olive wreath crown. In the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, each medalist received a wooden statuette of the Olympic logo.

It is customary for many medals at the Winter Olympics to be presented in a separate ceremony on the evening of or the evening after competition. At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the &quot;medals plaza&quot; was popularized as a way for the public to see presentations that would have otherwise taken place at far-flung, low-capacity or high-altitude venues and to have an evening program that often included musical performances.

<text>The Carrizal seedeater (Amaurospiza carrizalensis) is a species of bird in the family Cardinalidae, the cardinals or cardinal grosbeaks. It is endemic to Venezuela.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The Carrizal seedeater was described based on three specimens collected in 2001. The researchers who determined that it was a new species, Miguel Lentino and Robin L. Restall, named it Carrizal blue seedeater, but the &quot;blue&quot; was dropped by taxonomic organizations to avoid conflict with what was then the blue seedeater (&quot;Amaurospiza concolor&quot;).

==Description==

The Carrizal seedeater is long and weighs . The male is a glossy dark slaty blue that is darker on the face and underparts. The female&#x27;s upperparts are warm brown and the underparts yellow-buff, darker on the flanks.

==Distribution and habitat==

The specimens of Carrizal seedeater were collected on Isla Carrizal in the Caroni River of northern Venezuela. Construction of the Tocoma Dam, which began in 2006, flooded the island. The species has since been found elsewhere in the Caroni River watershed. It is known only from stands of spiny &quot;Guadua&quot; and &quot;Ripidocladus&quot; species of bamboo in deciduous forest.

==Behavior==
===Feeding===

The crops of the Carrizal seedeater specimens contained beetles and vegetable matter.

===Breeding===

No information has been published about the Carrizal seedeater&#x27;s breeding phenology.

===Vocalization===

The Carrizal seedeater&#x27;s song is &quot;a pleasant whistled warble, &#x27;sweet sweet pit-swee pit-swoo&#x27;&quot; .

==Status==

The IUCN has not assessed the Carrizal seedeater. However, researchers consider it Critically Endangered. It is known from fewer than 20 locations across a very small area. &quot;Effective protection of potentially suitable habitat is considered essential if this species is to survive in the future.&quot;

<text>A thermal column (or thermal) is a rising mass of buoyant air, a convective current in the atmosphere, that transfers heat energy vertically. Thermals are created by the uneven heating of Earth&#x27;s surface from solar radiation, and are an example of convection, specifically atmospheric convection. 

==Thermals on Earth==

The Sun warms the ground, which in turn warms the air directly above. The warm air near the surface expands, becoming less dense than the surrounding air. The lighter air rises and cools due to its expansion in the lower pressure at higher altitudes. It stops rising when it has cooled to the same temperature, thus density, as the surrounding air.

Associated with a thermal is a downward flow surrounding the thermal column. The downward-moving exterior is caused by colder air being displaced at the top of the thermal.

The size and strength of thermals are influenced by the properties of the lower atmosphere (the &quot;troposphere&quot;). When the air is cold, bubbles of warm air are formed by the ground heating the air above it and can rise like a hot air balloon. The air is then referred to as unstable, as it&#x27;s suitable for forming thermals. If there is a warm layer of air higher up, an inversion can prevent thermals from rising high and the air is said to be stable, as mature thermals can&#x27;t form.

Thermals are often indicated by the presence of visible isolated cumulus clouds at the top of the thermal. Cumulus clouds are formed by the rising air in a thermal as it ascends and cools, until the water vapor in the air begins to condense into visible droplets. When a steady wind is present, thermals and their respective cumulus clouds can align in rows oriented with wind direction, sometimes referred to as &quot;cloud streets&quot; by soaring and glider pilots. 

The condensing water releases latent heat energy allowing the air to rise higher. Very unstable air can reach the level of free convection (LFC), rising to great heights, condensing large quantities of water and forming convective clouds causing showers or even thunderstorms. The latter are dangerous to any aircraft flying through or nearby.

Thermals are one of the many sources of lift used by soaring birds and gliders to soar.

==Thermals beyond Earth==
Thermals are also seen elsewhere in the solar system. On Mars, for example, thermals are often seen in the form of dust devils, carrying dust instead of water vapor. Thermals are also seen on the sun, typically forming hexagonal convective prisms (Bénard cells).

<doc id="354374" wikidata="Q1346592" url="?curid=354374" title="Parallel text">
<text>A parallel text is a text placed alongside its translation or translations. Parallel text alignment is the identification of the corresponding sentences in both halves of the parallel text. The Loeb Classical Library and the Clay Sanskrit Library are two examples of dual-language series of texts. Reference Bibles may contain the original languages and a translation, or several translations by themselves, for ease of comparison and study; Origen&#x27;s Hexapla (Greek for &quot;sixfold&quot;) placed six versions of the Old Testament side by side. A famous example is the Rosetta Stone, whose discovery allowed the Ancient Egyptian language to begin being deciphered.

Large collections of parallel texts are called parallel corpora (see text corpus). Alignments of parallel corpora at sentence level are prerequisite for many areas of linguistic research. 
During translation, sentences can be split, merged, deleted, inserted or reordered by the translator. This makes alignment a non-trivial task.

Parallel texts may be used in language education.

==Types of parallel corpora==

Parallel corpora can be classified into four main categories:
* A &quot;parallel corpus&quot; contains translations of the same document in two or more languages, aligned at least at the sentence level. These tend to be rarer than less-comparable corpora.
* A &quot;noisy parallel corpus&quot; contains bilingual sentences that are not perfectly aligned or have poor quality translations. Nevertheless, most of its contents are bilingual translations of a specific document.
* A &quot;comparable corpus&quot; is built from non-sentence-aligned and untranslated bilingual documents, but the documents are topic-aligned.
* A &quot;quasi-comparable corpus&quot; includes very heterogeneous and non-parallel bilingual documents that may or may not be topic-aligned.

==Noise in corpora==

Large corpora used as training sets for machine translation algorithms are usually extracted from large bodies of similar sources, such as databases of news articles written in the first and second languages describing similar events.

However, extracted fragments may be noisy, with extra elements inserted in each corpus. Extraction techniques can differentiate between bilingual elements represented in both corpora and monolingual elements represented in only one corpus in order to extract cleaner parallel fragments of bilingual elements. Comparable corpora are used to directly obtain knowledge for translation purposes. High-quality parallel data is difficult to obtain, however, especially for under-resourced languages.

== Bitext ==

In the field of translation studies a bitext is a merged document composed of both source- and target-language versions of a given text.

Bitexts are generated by a piece of software called an &quot;alignment tool&quot;, or a &quot;bitext tool&quot;, which automatically aligns the original and translated versions of the same text. The tool generally matches these two texts sentence by sentence. A collection of bitexts is called a &quot;bitext database&quot; or a &quot;bilingual corpus&quot;, and can be consulted with a search tool.

===Bitexts and translation memories===

&quot;Bitexts&quot; have some similarities with translation memories. The most salient difference is that a translation memory loses the original context, while a bitext retains the original sentence order. That said, some implementations of translation memory, such as Translation Memory eXchange (TMX), a standard XML format for exchanging translation memories between computer-assisted translation (CAT) programs, allow preserving the original order of sentences.

Bitexts are designed to be consulted by a human translator, not by a machine. As such, small alignment errors or minor discrepancies that would cause a translation memory to fail are of no importance.

In his original 1988 article, Harris also posited that bitext represents how translators hold their source and target texts together in their mental working memories as they progress. However, this hypothesis has not been followed up.

Online bitexts and translation memories may also be called online bilingual concordances. Several are available on the public Web, including Linguée, Reverso, and Tradooit.

<doc id="354376" wikidata="Q1631506" url="?curid=354376" title="Houston Symphony">
<text>The Houston Symphony is an American orchestra based in Houston, Texas. The orchestra is resident at the Jesse H. Jones Hall for the Performing Arts.

==History==
The first concert of what was to become the Houston Symphony took place on June 21, 1913, sponsored by the Houston philanthropist Ima Hogg. Initially, the orchestra was composed of only 35 part-time musicians. Despite its small stature and budget, the orchestra and its first conductor, Julien Paul Blitz, enjoyed a good response and continued to perform. He conducted until 1916, then Paul Bergé, until the orchestra disbanded in 1918.

The orchestra reformed in 1930, still as a semi-professional orchestra, and gave its first full season of concerts the following year conducted by Uriel Nespoli. In the spring of 1936, the symphony society officially became the Houston Symphony Society. Ernst Hoffmann began his tenure that year with increased support from the Society and began hiring professional musicians. The orchestra continued to expand over the next several decades, and its first 52-week contract was signed in 1971.

In 1946, the present-day Houston Symphony Chorus was founded as the Houston Chorale, and the chorus has performed with the Houston Symphony since then.

Leopold Stokowski was music director from 1955 to 1961. During his tenure, the Houston Symphony gave the American premiere of the Symphony no. 11 of Dmitri Shostakovich, and subsequently made the first commercial recording of the work. When Stokowski invited African-American opera singer Shirley Verrett to sing with the Houston Symphony in the early 1960s, he was forced to rescind his invitation when the orchestra board refused to accept a black soloist. Stokowski later made amends by giving her a prestigious date with the Philadelphia Orchestra.

The orchestra performed in either the City Auditorium or the Music Hall until the construction in 1966 of the Jesse H. Jones Hall for the Performing Arts. In 2001, the orchestra lost millions of dollars&#x27; worth of instruments, music, and archives when Tropical Storm Allison flooded the basement levels of Jones Hall. In 2003, the musicians went on strike for 24 days, and the settlement included a pay cut for the musicians and a reduction in the size of the orchestra.

Hans Graf was the music director of the orchestra from 2001 to 2013, the longest tenure of any Houston Symphony music director. In September 2009, the orchestra announced the conclusion of his tenure as music director at the end of the 2012–2013 season, upon which Graf took the title of conductor laureate of the orchestra.

Andrés Orozco-Estrada became music director in September 2014, with an initial contract of five years. In March 2017, the orchestra announced an extension of Orozco-Estrada&#x27;s contract through the 2021–2022 season. Orozco-Estrada and the orchestra have recorded commercially for the PENTATONE label. Orozco-Estrada concluded his Houston music directorship at the close of the 2021–2022 season.

Juraj Valčuha first guest-conducted the orchestra in 2011. He returned as a guest conductor twice, in April 2018 and in March 2021. In July 2021, the orchestra announced the appointment of Valčuha as its next music director, effective with the 2022–2023 season.

Past executive directors and chief executive officers of the orchestra have included John Mangum, who held the post from January 2018 to July 2024. In January 2025, the orchestra announced the appointment of Gary Ginstling as its next executive director and chief executive officer, effective 3 February 2025.

<text>The gens Aemilia, originally written Aimilia, was one of the greatest patrician families at ancient Rome. The gens was of great antiquity, and claimed descent from Numa Pompilius, the second King of Rome. Its members held the highest offices of the state, from the early decades of the Republic to imperial times. The Aemilii were almost certainly one of the &quot;gentes maiores&quot;, the most important of the patrician families. Their name was associated with three major roads (the &quot;Via Aemilia&quot;, the &quot;Via Aemilia Scauri&quot;, and the &quot;&quot;), an administrative region of Italy, and the Basilica Aemilia at Rome.

==Origin==
Several stories were told of the foundation of the Aemilii, of which the most familiar was that their ancestor, Mamercus, was the son of Numa Pompilius. In the late Republic, several other gentes claimed descent from Numa, including the Pompilii, Pomponii, Calpurnii, and Pinarii. A variation of this account stated that Mamercus was the son of Pythagoras, who was sometimes said to have taught Numa. However, as Livy observed, this was not possible, as Pythagoras was not born until more than a century after Numa&#x27;s death, and was still living in the early days of the Republic.

This Mamercus is said to have received the name of &quot;Aemilius&quot; because of the persuasiveness of his language (), although such a derivation is certainly false etymology. A more likely derivation is from &quot;aemulus&quot;, &quot;a rival&quot;. According to a different legend, the Aemilii were descended from Aemylos, a son of Ascanius, four hundred years before the time of Numa Pompilius. Still another version relates that the gens was descended from Amulius, the wicked uncle of Romulus and Remus, who deposed his brother Numitor to become king of Alba Longa.

In the late Republic, a number of minor families claimed descent from the figures of Rome&#x27;s legendary past, including through otherwise unknown sons of Numa. Modern historians dismiss these as late inventions, but the claim of the Aemilii was much older, and there was no corresponding need to demonstrate the antiquity of a gens that was already prominent at the beginning of the Republic. In any case, the Aemilii, like Numa, were almost certainly of Sabine origin. The praenomen &quot;Mamercus&quot; is derived from &quot;Mamers&quot;, a god worshipped by the Sabelli of central and southern Italy, and usually regarded as the Sabellic form of Mars. At Rome, this name, and its diminutive, &quot;Mamercinus&quot;, were known primarily as cognomina of the Aemilii and the Pinarii, although the Aemilii continued to use it as a praenomen. A surname of the later Aemilii, &quot;Regillus&quot;, seems to be derived from the Sabine town of Regillum, better known as the ancestral home of the Claudia gens, and perhaps alludes to the Sabine origin of the Aemilii.

The roots of the Aemilia gens was also connected to the very founding of Rome through the claim that it descended from Aemilia, the daughter of Aeneas and Lavinia.

==Praenomina==
The Aemilii regularly used the praenomina &quot;Lucius, Manius, Marcus,&quot; and &quot;Quintus&quot;, and occasionally &quot;Mamercus&quot;. The Aemilii Mamercini also used &quot;Tiberius&quot; and &quot;Gaius&quot;, while the Aemilii Lepidi, who had a particular fondness for old and unusual names, used &quot;Paullus&quot;, presumably with reference to the family of the Aemilii Paulli, which had died out nearly a century earlier. An obscure family of uncertain date seems to have used &quot;Caeso&quot;. The daughters of the Aemilii are known to have used the numerical praenomina &quot;Prima&quot;, &quot;Secunda&quot;, and &quot;Tertia&quot;, although these were frequently treated as cognomina, and placed at the end of the name.

==Branches and cognomina==
The oldest &quot;stirps&quot; of the Aemilii bore the surname &quot;Mamercus&quot;, together with its diminutive, &quot;Mamercinus&quot;; these appear somewhat interchangeably in early generations. This family flourished from the earliest period to the time of the Samnite Wars. Several other important families, with the surnames &quot;Papus, Barbula, Paullus&quot;, and &quot;Lepidus&quot;, date from this period, and were probably descended from the Mamercini. The most illustrious of the family was undoubtedly Mamercus Aemilius Mamercinus, three times dictator in the second half of the fifth century BC.

The Aemilii Papi occur in history for about a century and a half, from the time of the Samnite Wars down to the early second century BC. Their surname, &quot;Papus&quot;, like &quot;Mamercus&quot;, appears to be of Oscan origin. The name &quot;Aemilius Papus&quot; occurs again in the time of the emperor Hadrian, but properly speaking these appear to have belonged to the Messia gens, and probably claimed descent from the more illustrious Aemilii through a female line.

&quot;Barbula&quot;, or &quot;little beard&quot;, occurs as the surname of one branch of the Aemilii, which appears in history for about a century beginning in the time of the Samnite Wars, and accounting for several consulships.

&quot;Paullus&quot;, occasionally found as &quot;Paulus&quot;, was an old praenomen, meaning &quot;little&quot;. As a praenomen, its masculine form had fallen into disuse at Rome, although the feminine form, &quot;Paulla&quot;, in various orthographies, was very common. As a surname, &quot;Paullus&quot; appeared in many families down to the latest period of the Empire, but none were more famous than the Aemilii Paulli. This family was descended from Marcus Aemilius Paullus, consul in 302 BC, and vanished with the death of Lucius Aemilius Paullus, the conqueror of Macedonia, in 160 BC. His sons, though grown, were adopted into the families of the Fabii Maximi and the Cornelii Scipiones. The Aemilii Lepidi revived the name toward the end of the Republic, when it was fashionable for younger branches of aristocratic families to revive the surnames of older, more illustrious stirpes.

The cognomen &quot;Lepidus&quot; belongs to a class of surnames derived from the habits of the habits of the bearer, and evidently referred to someone with a pleasant demeanor. The Aemilii Lepidi appear only a generation after the Aemilii Paulli, beginning with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, consul in 285 BC, and produced many illustrious statesmen down to the first century AD. In the final decades of the Republic, they revived a number of names originally belonging to older stirpes of the Aemilian gens, including &quot;Mamercus&quot; as a praenomen, &quot;Regillus&quot; as a cognomen, and &quot;Paullus&quot; as both. The last generations were related by marriage to the imperial family.

The Aemilii Scauri flourished from the beginning of the second century BC to the beginning of the first century AD. Their surname, &quot;Scaurus&quot;, referred to the appearance of the feet or ankles; Chase suggests &quot;swollen ankles&quot;.

The cognomina &quot;Regillus&quot; and &quot;Buca&quot; apparently belonged to short-lived families. &quot;Regillus&quot; appears to be derived from the Sabine town of Regillum, perhaps alluding to the Sabine origin of the gens. The Aemilii Regilli flourished for about two generations, beginning at the time of the Second Punic War. &quot;Buca&quot;, probably the same as &quot;Bucca&quot;, referred to someone with prominent cheeks, or perhaps someone known for shouting or wailing. The Aemilii Buci are known chiefly from coins, and seem to have flourished toward the end of the Republic.

As with other prominent gentes of the Republic, there were some Aemilii whose relationship to the major families is unclear, as the only references to them contain no surname. Some of these may have been descended from freedmen, and been plebeians. Aemilii with a variety of surnames are found in imperial times.

<text>Burbage is a large village and civil parish, now generally considered a suburb of the neighbouring town of Hinckley. It is in the Borough of Hinckley and Bosworth in Leicestershire, England, near the border with Warwickshire.

==History==
The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;valley/brook with a fortification&#x27;.

Leofric, Earl of Mercia, gave the village of Burbage to Coventry Abbey in 1043. At that time it was valued at two shillings. By the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, its value had risen to £4. There were 1¼ hides of land (around ) with two ploughs. Twenty villagers held two smallholdings, with two slaves and eight ploughs. Burbage also had a meadow, measuring a furlong in length and width (about 40,500 square metres). The village also owned woodland half a league by four furlongs (2.2 square kilometres).

In 1564 the diocesan returns show a population of 57 families within Burbage and six at Sketchley.
Burbage, for many centuries a small farming community, remained very thinly populated. In the census of 1801 there were 1098 inhabitants. It was not until the twentieth century that the population exceeded 2000.

During the English Civil War the village&#x27;s proximity to Hinckley drew it to the attention of raiding parties from the local parliamentary garrisons in north Warwickshire. A list of claims submitted by the constables of Burbage and Sketchley to the Warwickshire county committee, in June 1646, reveals that Captain Flower&#x27;s troop from the Coventry garrison took twenty strikes of provender valued at £1, sent off to Stoney Stanton, and availed themselves of free quarter worth £18.10. Captain Willington&#x27;s cornet from the Tamworth garrison took a mare, saddle and bridle from John Watkin, while Captain Willington&#x27;s soldiers took a horse worth £5 from Thomas Bodington.(SP28/161)

Burbage was also the birthplace, in 1608, of John Cook. Cook went on to become Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth of England and lead the prosecution of King Charles I for High Treason, resulting in Charles&#x27; execution and, ultimately, his own.

By 1953, the population had risen to 3,983, and by 1958 there were more than 5,000 on the electoral roll; this rapid growth was largely due to the expansion of Sketchley Hill housing estates.

In 2001 the population of Burbage was 14,324.

==Parish council==

Burbage Parish Council is the parish council of Burbage. The parish council is split into five local wards which include:

*Lash Hill
*Sketchley
*St Catherine&#x27;s
*Stretton
*Tilton

=== Current composition ===
=== Election history ===
Burbage Parish Council is made up of 20 councilors and five wards. The last election for the council was in 2023. It is all made up of Liberal Democrats.

==People==
The leading barrister and judge Ann Curnow QC was born here, and so was the mathematician R. Cotes (1682–1716).

== Burbage today ==

Burbage is effectively a suburb of the larger urban area of Hinckley, having been incorporated officially in the Hinckley Urban District in 1936. The old Burbage village is now a small part of a large parish which also includes Sketchley Village and some large and small residential estates. It is considered by some to be a commuter location for large parts of Leicestershire, Warwickshire and the West Midlands. This is probably due to the fact it is less than a mile from the M69 (which links that M6 to the M1) and the A5.

Burbage has a small library which was threatened with closure in 2015, due to a cost-cutting strategy by the county council. In 2016, a group of community volunteers from the area were successful in submitting plans to take control of the running of the library. The group also gained CIO (charitable incorporated organisation) status and have since made improvements to the library&#x27;s facilities.

Burbage Community Arts Festival (BCAF) is held annually in May over a period of two weeks. BCAF is a registered charity run by volunteers. The festival provides opportunities for members of the community young and old to participate in and enjoy various aspects of the performance, visual and literary arts including opportunities in music, dance, painting and sculpture. BCAF also brings professional entertainment to the community in the form of drama, music, comedy and theatre. The Festival first began in 1998 and has been staged successfully every year since.

There is a primary school, an infant school, a junior school and a high school. The 1st Britannia Scout Group (which includes Beaver Scout, Cub Scout, Scout and Explorer Scout sections) on Britannia Fields, There is a farmers market every first Saturday of the month running 9:00 am to 1:00 pm.

The nearest railway station is Hinckley which is about from Burbage centre, on the boundary between Burbage and Hinckley.

A yearly summer street carnival and fete is organised by the Burbage Carnival Committee, whose purpose is to raise funds to donate to local good causes. This has been a very popular community event and has raised over 1/2 million pounds for good causes. The carnival committee also runs the Burbage Bonfire and Fireworks Display held on Britannia Fields – all to support local charities.

The Freestyle Burbage community events project, a crowdsourced and crowdfunded programme of events organised and run by local residents, was started in 2013 by residents in the Sketchley Hill and Lash Hill area. It folded in 2018 due to lack of support.

The highest rank local football team is called FC Burbage who play at various venues around the village. Mini soccer through to open age and veterans football are teams who play for this large grass root club, founded in 2011 by 3 local dads wanting to provide a safe and fun game for local children. The club is still Chaired by one of the original 3 founders, with growing team numbers for both boys, girls men and women to all get involved. With over 350+ players this is a large grass roots club..

== Burbage Common and Woods==

Burbage Common and Woods are in the northeast corner of the Parish. This is a country park run by Hinckley &amp; Bosworth Borough Council. Its history as a grazing area dates back to at least the Domesday Book of 1086. It is now a park popular with, amongst others, birdwatchers, walkers and horseriders. It is free to enter and is open dawn to dusk every day.

<text>Telecommunications towers in the United Kingdom are operated mainly by Arqiva. Arqiva operates the transmitters for UK terrestrial TV and most radio broadcasting, both analogue and digital. BT also operates a number of telecommunications towers in the UK.
==BT==

BT&#x27;s towers were, at one time, the backbone for a national line-of-sight microwave telecommunications network. One of the most famous of these is the BT Tower in London. However, the introduction of fibre optic network technology rendered these microwave towers largely obsolete for their original purpose. Nowadays they tend to be used mainly for relatively low capacity fixed links to customer sites and mobile telephony.

===List of BT towers===
BT Group owns at least 200 radio masts and towers in Britain. Of these, fourteen are reinforced concrete towers. The rest are of steel lattice construction.

Seven of the fourteen are of similar design, known as the &#x27;Chilterns&#x27; type, after the first one which was built at Stokenchurch on the Chiltern Hills.
They are identical except for their heights, which vary considerably. They are at:
The other seven are:

==Mobile phone==
Below the level of the major telecommunications towers, mobile phone operators run roughly 23,000 base stations. In urban areas, these are almost all rooftop sites or microcells, but in rural areas these are often on towers, frequently owned by BT or Arqiva. The Sitefinder database is an incomplete list of mobile phone base stations in the UK.

Since the discontinuation of the Ofcom sitefinder website in 2015, Estate Systems Ltd have developed a comprehensive site www.mastdata.com for use by the public and mobile operators (subject to a fee) which locates masts within the UK including Northern Ireland.

Arqiva sold its mast business for telecoms to Cellnex. They no longer operate in this area.

==Military==
There are also numerous military communications sites in the UK, operated by various wings of the armed forces. Many of the masts and towers at military sites are now marketed to commercial site sharers by Arqiva.

==History==
The first UK microwave relay towers were built in about 1952 for a television link between Manchester and Kirk o&#x27;Shotts near Glasgow. A chain of 14 towers, known as &quot;Backbone&quot;, running from the Chilterns to Scotland and intended primarily for national defence in the Cold War, was first mentioned publicly in the 1955 Defence White Paper. It announced &quot;The Post Office are planning to build up a special network, both by cable and radio, designed to maintain long distance communication in the event of an attack&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t actually built until the early 1960s, by which time the original Backbone concept had become absorbed into a much larger microwave network built for a mixture of civil and defence traffic including voice, telegraphy, television and radar.

<doc id="354386" wikidata="Q1012476" url="?curid=354386" title="Youghal">
<text>Youghal ( ; ) is a seaside resort town in County Cork, Ireland. Located on the estuary of the River Blackwater, the town is a former military and economic centre. Located on the edge of a steep riverbank, the town has a long and narrow layout. As of the 2022 census, the population was 8,564. The town is in a civil parish of the same name.

As a historic walled seaport town on the coastline of East Cork, and close to a number of beaches, it has been a tourist destination since the mid-19th century. There are a number of historic buildings and monuments within the town&#x27;s walls, and Youghal is among a small number of towns designated as &quot;Irish Heritage Ports&quot; by the Irish Tourist Board.

==Name==
The name &quot;Youghal&quot; comes from the Irish &quot;Eochaill&quot; meaning &quot;yew woods&quot;, which were once common in the area. Older anglicisations of this name include &quot;Youghall&quot;, &quot;Yoghel&quot; and &quot;Yochil&quot;.

==History and architecture==
Youghal received its charter of incorporation in 1209, but the history of settlement on the site is longer, with Viking settlements dating back to the 11th century, the Church of Coran in the town&#x27;s western suburbs dating from the 5th century, and evidence of Neolithic habitation at nearby Newport.

Older buildings in the town include Sir Walter Raleigh&#x27;s home &quot;Myrtle Grove&quot; and the St Mary&#x27;s Collegiate Church, thought to have been founded by St Declán around 450. The church was rebuilt in Irish Romanesque style in about 750, and a great Norman nave was erected in about 1220. It is one of the few remaining medieval churches in Ireland to have remained in continuous use as a place of worship. The Vikings used Youghal as a base for their raids on monastic sites along the south coast of Ireland, and a stone in St Mary&#x27;s Collegiate Church bears the ancient etched outline of a longboat. Since the 16th-century Plantation of Munster it has been the place of worship of the Church of Ireland congregation of Youghal and its surrounding areas.

The Sack of Youghal took place on 13 November 1579. As the centre of English power in south Munster the town was badly damaged during the Second Desmond Rebellion when it was sacked by the forces of Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond, who massacred the garrison, hanged the English officials, and looted the homes of Youghal&#x27;s townspeople. The revenge killings that followed this included that of a priest, Daniel O&#x27;Neilan, OSF, on 28 March 1580. He was fastened round the waist with a rope and thrown with weights tied to his feet from one of the town-gates at Youghal, finally fastened to a mill-wheel and torn to pieces.
Taken prisoner following the Siege of Dunboy 1602, the Jesuit lay brother Dominic Collins was brought to his native Youghal in chains. And, after telling a Youghal crowd (in English, Irish and Spanish) that he was happy to die for the Catholic faith, he was hanged on 31 October 1602. He was beatified in 1992, as one of the 24 Irish Catholic Martyrs.

The first record of the walls is a charter of 1275, granted by King Edward I, for their repair and extension.
Clock Gate Tower – In 1777, the town&#x27;s Clock Gate Tower was built on the site of Trinity Castle, part of the town&#x27;s fortifications. It was used as a prison during the rebellion of 1798. The military hanged suspects from a pole lashed from the lower windows to the corner of the first house on South Main Street (now Luigi&#x27;s). Thomas Gallagher was one of those hanged for trying to seduce a soldier from allegiance to his regiment. Numerous forms of torture were conducted therein including thumb screws, pitch-cap, rack and flogging. The Clock Gate served the town as gaol and public gallows until 1837.

Tynte&#x27;s Castle – a late 15th-century urban tower house. It is almost the only fortified relic of the era now in Youghal. It was built by the Walsh family in 1602 and leased by the corporation to the Tynte family towards the end of the reign of King James I. It is shown in a map of Youghal dated 1663 as one of the defences of the town. The building was passed down through the Tynte family and is now the property of the McCarthy family.
Alms Houses – the 17th-century almshouses were constructed by Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork in 1602 for widows. Each tenant received two shillings a week, enough to sustain her. Around the same time (1612), Sir Richard Boyle built a hospital and a free school. For his efforts in colonising Munster, Sir Richard Boyle was granted the title and dignity Lord Boyle in 1616. When a poll tax of two shillings was introduced in 1697, those living by alms were exempt. Boyle&#x27;s tomb is in St Mary&#x27;s Collegiate Church.
Youghal Town Hall – A new town hall was erected by the corporation, to replace an earlier tholsel, in 1779. It contained a corn exchange, council house, custom house and grand jury room.

Water Gate – The town&#x27;s Water Gate was built in the 13th century to provide access through the town walls to the docks. Also known as Cromwell&#x27;s Arch, it was from here that Oliver Cromwell left Ireland in 1650, having overwintered in the town after his campaign in Ireland.

Youghal was the first town in Ireland or Britain to have a Jewish mayor when William Annyas was elected to that position in 1555; and the town&#x27;s small but significant Huguenot settlement provided a number of mayors such as Richard Paradise (1683), Edward Gillett (1721) and Joseph Labatte (1752)

Youghal Priory – In 1350, the monastery of St John the Evangelist was founded. It was an affiliated branch of the wealthy Benedictine Priory of St John of Waterford. The main priory building appears to have been intended to combine a fortress with a religious retreat. Oliver Cromwell fixed his residence at the Priory of St John&#x27;s on the main street in winter 1649.

Myrtle Grove – When Sir Walter Raleigh reputedly brought the first potatoes from Virginia to Ireland in 1585, he planted them at his home at Myrtle Grove, Youghal. For the following two years he was mayor of the town. Queen Elizabeth I granted him of land in Youghal. He lived at Myrtle Grove, where he entertained the poet Edmund Spenser. In the gardens are four yew trees said to have been planted by Raleigh. Raleigh made his final trip from Cork to the West Indies in 1617.
Red House – The Red House is an early 18th-century brick townhouse which was built for the Uniacke family, a merchant family in Youghal. It was completed in 1703.

Youghal Lighthouse – In 1202, the Geraldine proprietors of the town built a lighthouse on the cliff at the west side of the mouth&#x27;s harbour. The original tower was seven-and-a half metres (25&#x27;) tall and three metres (10&#x27;) in diameter. They also endowed a nunnery called the Chapel of St Anne under the condition that the nuns should see that the light was regularly maintained. The nuns did so until the reformation in the 1530s, when the lighthouse and the convent were confiscated. The beacon was discontinued in about 1542. The current lighthouse, made from granite imported from Scotland, was designed by George Halpin and work began on its construction in 1848. It was not until February 1852 that the harbour light was first displayed. The lantern is above sea level.

===Port and harbour===
According to Geoffrey Keating (Seathrún Céitinn), in late March 830 there was a &quot;great convulsion of nature&quot; in the province of Munster. This changed the flow of the River Blackwater moving its mouth from Whiting Bay and forming the harbour of Youghal. 1,010 people were lost by a fierce storm when the sea broke its banks. Soon afterwards in 853 a detachment from the Viking invasion built a fortress in Youghal and laid the foundation of a commercial seaport. In 1130, St Bernard writes of Lismore as the capital city of Munster and describes Youghal as the port of Lismore.
Youghal was incorporated in 1209 by King John and the town was colonised with men-at-arms, traffickers and other adventurers from Bristol. By 1223 Youghal had gained such importance as a commercial port that it merited a &#x27;road highway&#x27;. In 1291 several Flemish merchants were recorded as trading to Youghal. For their encouragement King Edward I granted special privileges to continue until All Saints Day (1 November). Large quantities of silver coinage of the Youghal region from the 14th century have been found indicating the high levels of traffic in the region. On 14 February 1301 King Edward I, when going into battle with Scotland, required two boats from all Irish and English ports. But three boats were required from Youghal, further indicating its size and importance.

In 1353, the freeman of Youghal were allowed freedom in trade in different staples throughout England and Wales for wool, leather, woolfels and lead. In 1360 Writs signed by Almaricus de St Åland, Justiciary of Ireland, were directed to Sovereign and Bailiffs of Youghal, ordering them to prevent persons from going to foreign parts. In 1373 King Edward III commanded the Keeper of the port to press and detain ships in the port for the purposes of conveying James Le Botiller, Earl of Ormond, whenever the Earl may come to the port on the King&#x27;s services. In 1376 the same King granted the Mayor of Youghal privileges for services against rebels in Cork. In the same year the merchants and commons of Youghal complained to Edward about the dangers of having to go to Cork to pay customs, and succeeded in arranging a new customs system for paying in Youghal.
The Dublin Parliament passed an Act concerning the imports, customs and mines in 1585 which made Youghal one of the privileged ports. Wine could then be discharged at Youghal, Cork, Waterford, Dublin, Limerick, Drogheda and Galway. Discharge at any other location, unless occasioned by stress of weather, meant forfeiting half to Queen Elizabeth I and half to the seizer. In early 1600 Youghal was elevated to the rank of &#x27;staple town&#x27;, receiving the exclusive rights to carry on the wool trade with Bristol, Liverpool, Chester and Milford. During the 17th century Youghal was one of Ireland&#x27;s main ports, far more important than Cork Harbour which was described as &#x27;a port near Youghal.&#x27; In 1603 King James I made a visit and was proclaimed on the quay in Youghal. In 1631 pirates of all nations swarmed the seas entering Youghal on several occasions. The most notorious of them was Nutt, who had three ships under his command.

By 1640 tobacco, originally introduced by Raleigh, had so fixed itself on the habits of the people, that it now formed one of the staples of trade at Youghal port. Oliver Cromwell, having regained Dublin, Wexford and Waterford for the English rule, arrived in Youghal on 6 December 1649. After resting for the winter in Youghal, Cromwell and his army crossed the Blackwater at Mallow and went on to yield Kilkenny and Clonmel before returning to Youghal and later England where Charles II had arrived. 1683 and 1684 saw great sickness and death in Youghal. In 1689 by order of King James II colonisers with a &quot;zealous attachment to the Protestant religion&quot; were rounded up and detained in castles in Youghal where they were held for 12 months before being released to flee back to England.

In 1695, having made an ingenious sundial, a schoolmaster was admitted as a freeman of Youghal. When Protestants of France were compelled to leave their own country by Louis XIV in 1697 many came to Ireland and settled in Youghal, bringing industry, intelligence and wealth. By 1716 Youghal council began inserting covenants into leases of ground skirted by the waterside, binding the leases to build quays. Gradually great enclosures from the sea were made which doubled the area of the town.

In the 1700s the Red House, a William and Mary style house, was built; it still survives with many original features.

In 1727, the Irish were permitted to trade in the town as scarcity and famine swept the country. There were riots in Youghal as people sought to prevent the export of corn to England and other parts of Ireland. Great sickness and mortality continued through 1734. In 1736 and 1745 the town walls were extensively repaired and in 1745 the Sally-port was remade.
Trade in Youghal varied greatly. In 1753 no corn, meal salt or flour was imported into Youghal from March to November of that year. In 1754 exports were 65 quarters of beans. 1755 saw exports of 214 quarters of barley, and 70 quarters of beans. Exports in 1756 were 450 quarters of Barley, 45 barrels of Oatmeal and imports were 6 barrels of beer. In 1757 exports were 495 quarters of Oats, 20 barrels of Oatmeal and imports were 11.25 barrels of beer. Works had commenced at this time on improving navigation of the Blackwater (1755) and a petition had been sent to Parliament to open roads from Lismore, Cappoquin and Clogheen to Youghal.

In 1762 a French privateer took six ships near the harbour. The commander landed 24 passengers on the Island of Ballycotton and took the remainder with him as recruits for Colonel Owen&#x27;s regiment. The cutter &quot;Expedition&quot; was sent in pursuit but did not come up with them. By 1780 wool combining business was carried on with great spirit in Youghal, where the Annals tell us &quot;great fortunes were realised&quot;. Exports from Youghal were extensive in 1781, with more oats being exported than from any other port in Ireland. Nealson&#x27;s Quay was built and commenced the following year. Grattan Street was opened along the quay that had been embanked.

In 1833, nine ships and 440 colliers entered the harbour. In 1834, there were 250 fishing boats in the harbour employing 2,500 men. Salmon was plentiful and was sold for 1d per pound weight. After many years of discussion and feasibility testing, the steamer &quot;The Star&quot; commenced plying on the Blackwater in June 1843. It was hoped that opening the Blackwater would reduce trade costs with Lismore, Fermoy, Mitchelstown and Mallow. On an objection from the Duke of Devonshire – who owned the weir at Lismore – and some other gentlemen, the river was not opened beyond Lismore, and so the steamer service ceased in 1850. The following year the Youghal Fisheries District had over 500 registered vessels employing over 2,700 men.

From the 18th century onwards, and as with nearby Ardmore, some larger ships were unable to get into Youghal Harbour, because of a shallow sandbar at its mouth.
A cross-river passenger ferry continued from Youghal to the opposite side of the harbour. The ferry capsized on 30 September 1876 and 14 people died. In 1882 a decision of the House of Lords established the claim of the Duke of Devonshire to exclusive fishery rights to the river Blackwater and Youghal Bay out to Capel Island. The duke&#x27;s claim was founded on a grant given to Sir Walter Raleigh by Elizabeth I, which he sold shortly afterward to the Boyle family.

In the 1950s, most exterior shots of &quot;New Bedford&quot; in John Huston&#x27;s movie adaptation of &quot;Moby Dick&quot; were filmed in Youghal, as New Bedford itself had changed too much in the intervening century to be usable for this purpose.

Youghal International College, a private international (Spanish) school, was opened in Youghal in 1992.
Youghal was formerly a strong manufacturing town, but Ireland&#x27;s economic success since the mid-1990s to a large extent bypassed the town, and the infrastructural deficit is a major constraint to its growth. In April 2011 it was reported that all the town&#x27;s large factories had closed over the past decade, leaving at least 2,000 people jobless, and with unemployment approaching 20%, young people were leaving in search of work and workers commuting from Youghal to Cork and Waterford.

==Government and politics==
The town was governed by the nine-member Youghal Town Council. Since the 2014 local elections and the abolition of the town councils under the Local Government Reform Act 2014, the town is represented by the East Cork Municipal District Council on Cork County Council which has 6 elected councillors representing the district.

Youghal is within the Cork East Dáil constituency.

==Tourism==
===Beaches===

Youghal adjoins a number of beaches including the beach to the west of the town. In 2011 Youghal&#x27;s three beaches, Front Strand, Claycastle and Redbarn, were awarded blue flags for water cleanliness and availability of amenities. Ballyvergan Marsh, the largest freshwater coastal marsh in County Cork which accommodates a number of plant and bird species, stretches along Claycastle Beach and on towards Redbarn Beach.

In the mid-20th century Youghal was a popular seaside resort, with thousands taking the train to the beach. According to &quot;An A to Z of Youghal: The history and people of Eochaill&quot;, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle vacationed in Youghal with his wife and created the character of &quot;Inspector Youghal&quot; of the CID for &quot;The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone&quot;. While the closing of the railway line in the 1970s triggered a period of decline in Youghal, there has been increased investment since the 1990s to restore the town&#x27;s facilities and popularity.

Redbarn beach is overlooked by a resort and residential area that includes a hotel, swimming pool, shop, sauna, crêperie, outdoor bar, café, caravan park and several self-catering holiday homes. Along the coast of this beach is a promenade, starting at the Quality Hotel and ending around the Aura swimming pool.

===Amenities and events===
Amenities in Youghal include an 18-hole golf course, floodlit tennis courts, GAA pitches, soccer pitches, 18-hole pitch and putt course, rugby pitches, greyhound racing, an indoor family entertainment centre with bowling, laser and a soft play area for children, squash and badminton courts, a leisure centre with a swimming pool, gyms, art galleries, a snooker club, a birdwatching hide at Ballyvergan Marsh, and a museum.

Youghal was declared one of the tidiest towns in Cork (and nationally) in the 2012 IBAL anti-litter league (run in conjunction with the Department of the Environment).

In 1914 the Youghal Pipe Band was founded. In 1984, the band was featured on the BBC programme &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot;, and in 1993 were invited to perform in Larmor, Brittany, France. Between 1995 and 1997, Youghal Pipe Band took part in competition for the first time, winning several awards. In 1969, St Mary&#x27;s Brass and Reed Band was founded, and went on to win competitions such as the South of Ireland Band Championships.

Youghal hosted the Irish Ironman Triathlon in 2019, 2022 and 2023.

==Transport==
Cork Airport is the nearest airport, and is located 54 km (34 miles) from Youghal. Bus Éireann operate a service between Youghal and Cork city. Other Bus Éireann services run to Ardmore, Dungarvan, Kilmac and Waterford City.

Youghal railway station, which opened on 1 May 1860, was closed to passenger services on 4 February 1963, and closed completely (including to goods traffic) on 30 August 1982.

<doc id="354390" wikidata="Q849653" url="?curid=354390" title="Battle of Thapsus">
<text>The Battle of Thapsus was a military engagement that took place on April 6, 46 BC near Thapsus (in modern Tunisia). The forces of the Optimates, led by Quintus Caecilius Metellus Scipio, were defeated by the forces of Julius Caesar. It was followed shortly by the suicides of Scipio and his ally, Cato the Younger, the Numidian king Juba, and his Roman peer Marcus Petreius.

==Prelude==
In 49 BC, the last civil war of the Roman Republic was initiated after Julius Caesar, who saw that his political enemies in Rome were looking to arrest and prosecute him, defied senatorial orders to disband his army following the conclusion of hostilities in Gaul. He crossed over the Rubicon river with the 13th Legion, a clear violation of Roman Law, and marched to Rome. The Optimates fled to Greece under the command of Pompey since they had not organised an army and were incapable of defending the city of Rome itself against Caesar. Led by Caesar, the Populares followed, but were greatly outnumbered and defeated in the Battle of Dyrrhachium. Still outnumbered, Caesar recovered and went on to decisively defeat the Optimates under Pompey at Pharsalus. Pompey then fled to Egypt, where to Caesar&#x27;s consternation, Pompey was assassinated. The remaining Optimates, not ready to give up fighting, regrouped in the African provinces of Mauretania. Their leaders were Marcus Cato (the younger) and Caecilius Metellus Scipio. Other key figures from the nobility in the resistance were Titus Labienus, Publius Attius Varus, Lucius Afranius, Marcus Petreius and the brothers Sextus and Gnaeus Pompeius (Pompey&#x27;s sons). King Juba I of Numidia was a valuable local ally. After the pacification of the Eastern provinces, and a short visit to Rome, Caesar followed his opponents to Africa.

==African campaign leading up to Thapsus==
Caesar had gathered six legions around Lilybaeum in Sicily. Four more legions were on their way from Rome. Despite the weather being far from optimal, Caesar embarked his six legions and sailed for Africa. He reached the African coast on 28 December, landing near Hadrumetum. However, a storm had scattered his transports, leaving him with just 3000 infantry and 150 cavalry. Hadrumetum was held by a strong Optimate garrison under Gaius Considius Longus and Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso. Caesar made camp south of the city and tried to negotiate with Considius, but the Optimate commander refused to read his message. Caesar launched several probing attacks on the city, but found out he had neither the men nor the materiel to take it. When his scouts reported that a large force of enemy cavalry was en route he decided to march south. The enemy cavalry force, mainly Numidian light cavalry, harassed his army all the way to Ruspina; they tried to pin Caesar&#x27;s army in place, surround him, and then wear down his men and destroy his army just like they had done to Curio. Caesar was a much better and far more experienced commander than Curio and kept his forces moving using his cavalry to keep the Numidians at bay while his legionaries marched on to Ruspina. On 29 December Caesar reached Ruspina.

===Ruspina===

Caesar made Ruspina his base of operations. On January 1, he took some of his men and moved on to Leptis where he was joined by some of his scattered transports bringing much needed reinforcements. On January 4, Caesar marched out from Ruspina on a foraging expedition. He marched out with half his force; 9000 legionaries in 30 understrength cohorts. When his scouts reported the enemy was nearby he ordered his cavalry and archers to join him from Ruspina. Caesar then awaited the Optimate forces. A battle was fought; the Optimates, led by Petreius and Labienus, almost overcame Caesar&#x27;s force, but in the end Caesar was able to extract his men and return to Ruspina.

Caesar decided to stay in camp around Ruspina, improve its defences and wait for more troops to arrive. The Optimates were gathering their forces near Hadrumetum; Scipio and the main army arrived bringing up their forces to 40,000 heavy infantry (about eight legions), a powerful cavalry force and many thousands of light infantry. Meanwhile, one of Caesar&#x27;s admirals, Sallust, had captured a large Optimate grain supply on the Cercina islands and the XIII and XIV legions had arrived in Ruspina. With these reinforcements Caesar went on the offensive. He defeated the Optimates&#x27; Gallic and Germanic auxiliary cavalry in a skirmish near Ruspina; Labienus and the Optimates&#x27; right wing cavalry had charged some of Caesar&#x27;s Spanish auxiliaries, but he had advanced too far from the main army. Caesar sent his left wing cavalry round to Labienus&#x27; rear catching him in a pincer. Labienus&#x27; Numidian cavalry was able to extract themselves, but his Gallic and Germanic horsemen were surrounded and slaughtered. In response the Optimates called on king Juba I of Numidia to join them with his army.

===Uzitta===
Caesar kept the initiative by marching on Uzitta, a major water source for the Optimates, and tried to force his enemy to do battle. Despite Juba&#x27;s arrival, bringing his forces up to thirteen legions, Scipio refused to attack Caesar&#x27;s positions. He tried to lure Caesar from his camp by torturing some of his captives, including the commander of the XIV legion, in front of Caesar&#x27;s camp, but Caesar did not fall for the ruse. Two more veteran legions, the IX and X, arrived, bolstering Caesar&#x27;s numbers. Caesar started building two long lines of fortifications from his camp to Uzitta. When they were finished he constructed a number of catapults and scorpions and started bombarding Uzitta. This caused some of the Optimates, mainly Gaetulians but also some legionaries from the Optimates&#x27; IV and VI legion, to change sides. Still the Optimates refused to do battle on Caesar&#x27;s terms so he retreated back to Ruspina. Two more legions, the VII and VIII, arrived, bringing up his numbers to twelve legions. Supply problems forced Caesar to march his entire army south-west foraging. He sent his fleet under Cispius and Aquila to blockade Hadrumetum and Thapsus. Caesar foraged the area around Aggar and Zeta. The Optimates shadowed him with their army using their superior cavalry numbers to harass Caesar while foraging.

==Preliminary operations==
In the beginning of February, Caesar arrived at Thapsus and besieged the city, surrounding it with a double line of circumvallation. His fleet had already arrived and was blockading Thapsus from the sea. Outside of the city was the Marsh of Moknine; leaving only two landward approaches to the city. Caesar blocked the southern approach with fortifications and defended these with three cohorts of troops. This forced his opponents to either attack the fortifications or march round the Marsh of Moknine and advance at his army via the eastern approach. The Optimates, led by Metellus Scipio, decided not to attack Caesar&#x27;s southern fortifications, but march to the eastern approach. Scipio ordered Afranius and a few soldiers to take up positions opposite the fortifications and further ordered Juba and Labienus to camp their Numidian cavalry to the south of the marshes. The main army marched all the way to the eastern approach and started building a camp opposite Caesar&#x27;s. To cover his workforce Scipio drew up the rest of his army in battle formation. Caesar knew that the Optimates&#x27; soldiers were tired from marching all day and drew up his well rested army to face them.

==Opposing forces==
Caesar had twelve legions at Thapsus: five newly raised legions; Legio XXV, XXVI, XXVIII, XXIX and XXX, and seven veteran legions; Legio V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XIII and XIV. Caesar&#x27;s veteran legions had been campaigning for many years and all of them were understrength. He also had a large number of archers, slingers and 3000–5000 cavalry. All in all Caesar had around 60,000–70,000 soldiers when he arrived at Thapsus.

The Optimates had eight Roman and three Numidian legions; around 55,000 legionaries. They also had 14,000–16,000 cavalry, c. 20,000 light infantry and 60 elephants. Their army totaled around 90,000 soldiers.

==Battle==
Scipio had drawn up his legions in three lines in the centre with his cavalry and light infantry on the flanks. He put his elephants in front of the flanks. Caesar had left two recently recruited legions to continue the siege of the city. He had also drawn up his legions in three lines; Legio VII and X on the right, VIII and IX on the left, the XIII and XIV with three newly recruited legions in the centre (he had placed a recruit legion on either side of the XIII and XIV – mixing recruit and veteran legion was one of Caesar&#x27;s trademarks), he had put his slingers, archers and the cavalry on the flanks, the V legion was split in two and kept as a reserve behind the flanks to counter the elephants. Caesar&#x27;s position was typical of his style, with him commanding the right. The two armies faced each other waiting for one to move with neither side committing to battle for some time, Caesar&#x27;s soldiers noticed something odd in the line up of the opposing legions, shifting nervously as troops moved out of the fortifications.

A trumpeter of the VII sounded the attack and Caesar, seeing his right surge forward, ordered a general advance. Caesar&#x27;s archers on the right flank attacked the elephants opposing them, causing them to panic and turn and trample their own men. The elephants on the other flank charged against Caesar&#x27;s left flank. Caesar&#x27;s light infantry and cavalry moved out of the elephants&#x27; path clearing their way to the detachment (five cohorts) of Legio V Alaudae which was placed behind the flank. The five cohorts sustained the charge with such bravery that afterwards the legion was awarded an elephant as a symbol. The legionaries of the fifth stabbed their pila at the elephants eyes and weak spots and blasted away on their trumpets frightening the beasts, causing them to turn back and run towards their own lines. They crashed into their own right flank. After the loss of the elephants, Metellus Scipio started to lose ground, his left broke first the rest followed. Caesar&#x27;s cavalry outmaneuvered its enemy, destroyed the fortified camp, and forced its enemy into retreat. During the battle the garrison of Thapsus sallied out, attacking Caesar&#x27;s siege works, but they were forced back by the two legions Caesar had left to continue the siege. Having done so these legionaries marched south to reinforce the troops fortified opposite Afranius and Juba&#x27;s camp and together they attacked and overran Afranius&#x27; camp. They then prepared to attack the Numidians. Before they could do so Juba&#x27;s allied troops abandoned the site and the battle was decided. Caesar proceeded to the Optimates&#x27; camp and found it already stormed. Here he lost control of his own men who started slaughtering their opponents. 

Around ten thousand enemies were killed, those surviving the battle being put to the sword by the furious soldiers in spite of Caesar&#x27;s repeated orders to spare them, which were ignored. Plutarch reports that according to some sources Caesar had an epileptic seizure just before he ordered his lines forward, causing confusion and orders to be disobeyed.

==Aftermath==
Scipio, Labienus, Juba, Afranius and Petreius managed to escape from their defeat at the Battle of Thapsus. Labienus, with Sextus Pompeius and Varus, fled to Gnaeus Pompeius who was raising forces on the Iberian Peninsula. Afranius and Faustus Cornelius Sulla (Sulla&#x27;s surviving son) collected several survivors and started to pillage eastern Mauretania (its king had sided with Caesar). They were caught by Publius Sittius (a Roman mercenary commander working for king Bocchus II, the king of eastern Mauretania, and an ally of Caesar) and were executed a few days later. Juba and Petreius fled to Numidia, but with Sittius closing in on them (Sittius had defeated the Numidian army under Suburra) they decided to commit suicide by dueling each other so they could die in an honorable way; Petreius managed to kill Juba in the duel and then had a slave kill him. Following the battle, Caesar renewed the siege of Thapsus, which eventually fell. He then proceeded to Utica, where Cato was garrisoned. On news of the defeat of his allies, Cato committed suicide. Caesar was upset by this and is reported by Plutarch to have said: &quot;Cato, I must grudge you your death, as you grudged me the honour of saving your life.&quot; Scipio also tried to escape to Roman Hispania; he gathered a small fleet and the remaining Optimate leadership around him and set sail for the Iberian Peninsula. Bad weather forced them to return to the African coast, where they were caught off Hippo Regius by Sittius and his fleet. After losing the subsequent naval engagement Scipio also committed suicide by stabbing himself with his sword.

The battle preceded peace in Africa—Caesar pulled out and returned to Rome on July 25 of the same year. However, Caesar&#x27;s opposition was not done yet; Titus Labienus, the sons of Pompey, Varus and several others managed to gather another army in Baetica in Hispania Ulterior. The civil war was not finished, and the Battle of Munda would soon follow. The Battle of Thapsus is generally regarded as marking the last large scale use of war elephants in the West.

<doc id="354393" wikidata="Q1747183" url="?curid=354393" title="List of Roman civil wars and revolts">
<text>This list of Roman civil wars and revolts includes civil wars and organized civil disorder, revolts, and rebellions in ancient Rome (Roman Kingdom, Roman Republic, and Roman Empire) until the fall of the Western Roman Empire (753 BC – AD 476). For the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantine Empire after the division of the Empire in West and East, see List of Byzantine revolts and civil wars (AD 330–1453). For external conflicts, see List of Roman external wars and battles. 

From the establishment of the Roman Republic in 509 BC until the 1st century BC, there were a sparse number of civil wars. But with the Crisis of the Roman Republic (134–44 BC), a period of considerable political instability began. The cause of the late Roman Republican civil wars is contested, as is whether the wars were the cause of, or caused by, the end of the Roman Republic. Regardless, a nearly constant stream of civil wars marked the end of the Roman Republic and heralded the rise of the Roman Empire in 27 BC. The first century of Empire was marked by widespread revolt through territory Rome had captured in the preceding centuries. The second century AD was relatively peaceful, with a limited number of revolts. Political instability returned to the Empire with the Crisis of the Third Century (235–284 AD), which saw at least 26 civil wars in just 50 years as usurpers sought the imperial throne. The fourth and fifth centuries AD were characterized by a regular rising of usurpers. The overthrow of the last Western Roman emperor in AD 476 by the Germanic king Odoacer marked the final civil war or revolt, as well as the end of the Western Roman Empire. 

Because the study of Roman civil war has been deeply influenced by historic Roman views on civil war, not all entries on this list may be considered civil wars by modern historians. Implicit in most Roman power struggles was a propaganda battle, which impacted how the struggle would be chronicled and referred to. For example, historians Lange &amp; Vervaet suggest that the crisis after Caesar&#x27;s assassination might be better understood as an internal emergency. Conversely, some revolts on this list may be properly considered to be civil wars, but were not referred to as such by Roman chroniclers. As Lange &amp; Vervaet note, &quot;civil war often refuses to speak its name.&quot;

<text>Bank switching is a technique used in computer design to increase the amount of usable memory beyond the amount directly addressable by the processor instructions. It can be used to configure a system differently at different times; for example, a ROM required to start a system from diskette could be switched out when no longer needed. In video game systems, bank switching allowed larger games to be developed for play on existing consoles.

Bank switching originated in minicomputer systems. Many modern microcontrollers and microprocessors use bank switching to manage random-access memory, non-volatile memory, input-output devices and system management registers in small embedded systems. The technique was common in 8-bit microcomputer systems. Bank-switching may also be used to work around limitations in address bus width, where some hardware constraint prevents straightforward addition of more address lines, and to work around limitations in the ISA, where the addresses generated are narrower than the address bus width. Some control-oriented microprocessors use a bank-switching technique to access internal I/O and control registers, which limits the number of register address bits that must be used in every instruction.

Unlike memory management by paging, data is not exchanged with a mass storage device like disk storage. Data remains in quiescent storage in a memory area that is not currently accessible to the processor (although it may be accessible to the video display, DMA controller, or other subsystems of the computer) without the use of special prefix instructions.

== Technique ==
Bank switching can be considered as a way of extending the address space of processor instructions with some register. Examples:
*The follow-on system to a processor with a 12 bit address has a 15 bit address bus, but there is no way to directly specify the high three bits on the address bus. Internal bank registers can be used to provide those bits.
*The follow-on system to a processor with a 15 bit address has an 18 bit address bus, but legacy instructions only have 15 address bits; internal bank registers can be used to provide those bits. Some new instructions can explicitly specify the bank.
*A processor with a 16-bit external address bus can only address 216 = 65536 memory locations. If an external latch was added to the system, it could be used to control which of two sets of memory devices, each with 65536 addresses, could be accessed. The processor could change which set is in current use by setting or clearing the latch bit. &lt;br&gt;The latch can be set or cleared by the processor in several ways; a particular memory address may be decoded and used to control the latch, or, in processors with separately-decoded I/O addresses, an output address may be decoded. Several bank-switching control bits could be gathered into a register, approximately doubling the available memory spaces with each additional bit in the register. &lt;br&gt;Because the external bank-selecting latch (or register) is not directly connected with the program counter of the processor, it does not automatically change state when the program counter overflows; this cannot be detected by the external latch since the program counter is an internal register of the processor. The extra memory is not seamlessly available to programs. Internal registers of the processor remain at their original length, so the processor cannot directly span all of bank-switched memory by, for example, incrementing an internal register. Instead the processor must explicitly do a bank-switching operation to access large memory objects. There are other limitations. Generally a bank-switching system will have one block of program memory that is common to all banks; no matter which bank is currently active, for part of the address space only one set of memory locations will be used. This area would be used to hold code that manages the transitions between banks, and also to process interrupts.

Often a single database spans several banks, and the need arises to move records between banks (as for sorting). If only one bank is accessible at a time, it would be necessary to move each byte twice: first into the common memory area, perform a bank switch to the destination bank, and then actually to move the byte into the destination bank. If the computer architecture has a DMA engine or a second CPU, and its bank access restrictions differ, whichever subsystem can transfer data directly between banks should be used.

Unlike a virtual memory scheme, bank-switching must be explicitly managed by the running program or operating system; the processor hardware cannot automatically detect that data not currently mapped into the active bank is required. The application program must keep track of which memory bank holds a required piece of data, and then call the bank-switching routine to make that bank active. However, bank-switching can access data much faster than, for example, retrieving the data from disk storage.

== Microcomputer use ==
Processors with 16-bit addressing (8080, Z80, 6502, 6809, etc.) commonly used in early video game consoles and home computers can directly address only 64 KB. Systems with more memory had to divide the address space into a number of blocks that could be dynamically mapped into parts of a larger address space. Bank switching was used to achieve this larger address space by organizing memory into separate banks of up to 64 KB each. Blocks of various sizes were switched in and out via bank select registers or similar mechanisms. Cromemco was the first microcomputer manufacturer to use bank switching, supporting 8 banks of 64 KB in its systems.

When using bank switching some caution was required in order not to corrupt the handling of subroutine calls, interrupts, the machine stack, and so on. While the contents of memory temporarily switched out from the CPU was inaccessible to the processor, it could be used by other hardware, such as video display, DMA, I/O devices, etc. CP/M-80 3.0 released in 1983 and the Z80-based TRS-80s the Model 4 and Model II supported bank switching to allow use of more than the 64 KB of memory that the 8080 or Z80 processor could address.

Bank switching allowed extra memory and functions to be added to a computer design without the expense and incompatibility of switching to a processor with a wider address bus. For example, the C64 used bank switching to allow for a full 64 KB of RAM and still provide for ROM and memory-mapped I/O as well. The Atari 130XE could allow its two processors (the 6502 and the ANTIC) to access separate RAM banks, allowing programmers to make large playfields and other graphic objects without using up the memory visible to the CPU.

==Microcontrollers==
Microcontrollers (microprocessors with significant input/output hardware integrated on-chip) may use bank switching, for example, to access multiple configuration registers or on-chip read/write memory. An example is the PIC microcontroller. This allows short instruction words to save space during routine program execution, at the cost of extra instructions required to access relatively infrequently used registers, such as those used for system configuration at start-up.

== The IBM PC ==

In 1985, the companies Lotus and Intel introduced Expanded Memory Specification (EMS) 3.0 for use in IBM PC compatible computers running MS-DOS. Microsoft joined for versions 3.2 in 1986 and 4.0 in 1987 and the specification became known as Lotus-Intel-Microsoft EMS or LIM EMS. It is a form of bank switching technique that allows more than the 640 KB of RAM defined by the original IBM PC architecture, by letting it appear piecewise in a 64 KB &quot;window&quot; located in the Upper Memory Area. The 64 KB is divided into four 16 KB &quot;pages&quot; which can each be independently switched. Some computer games made use of this, and though EMS is obsolete, the feature is nowadays emulated by later Microsoft Windows operating systems to provide backwards compatibility with those programs.

The later eXtended Memory Specification (XMS), also now obsolete, is a standard for, in principle, simulating bank switching for memory above 1 MB (called &quot;extended memory&quot;), which is not directly addressable in the Real Mode of x86 processors in which MS-DOS runs. XMS allows extended memory to be copied anywhere in conventional memory, so the boundaries of the &quot;banks&quot; are not fixed, but in every other way it works like the bank switching of EMS, from the perspective of a program that uses it. Later versions of MS-DOS (starting circa version 5.0) included the EMM386 driver, which simulates EMS memory using XMS, allowing programs to use extended memory even if they were written for EMS. Microsoft Windows emulates XMS also, for those programs that require it.

== Video game consoles ==
Bank switching was also used in some video game consoles. The Atari 2600, for instance, could only address 4 KB of ROM, so later 2600 game cartridges contained their own bank switching hardware in order to permit the use of more ROM and thus allow for more sophisticated games (via more program code and, equally important, larger amounts of game data such as graphics and different game stages). The Nintendo Entertainment System contained a modified 6502 but its cartridges sometimes contained a megabit or more of ROM, addressed via bank switching called a Multi-Memory Controller. Game Boy cartridges used a chip called MBC (Memory Bank Controller), which not only offered ROM bank switching, but also cartridge SRAM bank switching, and even access to such peripherals as infrared links or rumble motors. Bank switching was still being used on later game systems. Several Sega Mega Drive cartridges, such as Super Street Fighter II were over 4 MB in size and required the use of this technique (4 MB being the maximum address size).
The GP2X handheld from Gamepark Holdings uses bank switching in order to control the start address (or memory offset) for the second processor.

== Video processing ==
In some types of computer video displays, the related technique of double buffering may be used to improve video performance. In this case, while the processor is updating the contents of one set of physical memory locations, the video generation hardware is accessing and displaying the contents of a second set. When the processor has completed its update, it can signal to the video display hardware to swap active banks, so that the transition visible on screen is free of artifacts or distortion. In this case, the processor may have access to all the memory at once, but the video display hardware is bank-switched between parts of the video memory. If the two (or more) banks of video memory contain slightly different images, rapidly cycling (page-flipping) between them can create animation or other visual effects that the processor might otherwise be too slow to carry out directly.

== Alternative and successor techniques ==
Bank switching was later supplanted by segmentation in many 16-bit systems, which in turn gave way to paging memory management units. In embedded systems, however, bank switching is still often used for its simplicity, low cost, and often better adaptation to those contexts than to general purpose computing.

<text>Cicely Margot Lefort (née Gordon, 30 April 1899 – February 1945) served in the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) and in France for the United Kingdom&#x27;s clandestine Special Operations Executive (SOE) during the Second World War. The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance in occupied Europe against the Axis powers, especially Nazi Germany. SOE agents allied themselves with French Resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England.

Lefort arrived in France in June 1943 and was a courier, code named &quot;Alice&quot;, for SOE&#x27;s Jockey network (or circuit). She was arrested by the Gestapo in September 1943 and deported to Ravensbrück concentration camp, where she was later executed.

==Early life==
Cicely Margot Gordon (often mistakenly called &quot;Cecily&quot;) was born in London on 30 April 1899 to Margaret Humble Close Gordon (Lefort gave a decoy maiden name – &quot;MacKenzie&quot; – when she joined SOE). Although married to Christian Frederic Gordon, her mother claimed Cicely&#x27;s father was her husband&#x27;s older cousin Lord Granville Gordon with whom she was in love. Subsequently, Cicely became the centre of a notorious paternity suit, which resulted in her mother fleeing and taking her to France rather than relinquishing custody. Growing up in France, Lefort joined the French nursing corps during World War One. While serving as a nurse&#x27;s aid, she met her future husband, Dr Ernest Marie Alix Lefort, a soldier and patient in her hospital. They married on 17 June 1924 and resided in an apartment in Paris and a villa near the fishing village of St. Cast along the north coast of Brittany, France. A sportswoman, Lefort enjoyed horseback riding and sailing yachts. An acquaintance recalled that Lefort &quot;had a lot of class ...[was] very smart and cultivated ...[with] friends in high society&quot;.

==Espionage service==
In 1939, Alix Lefort was called up for service in the French army as a medical officer. After the fall of France and at his urging, Lefort escaped to Great Britain via Jersey Island, to avoid arrest as a British National, while her husband remained in France. Later, Lefort spoke with SOE&#x27;s Naval officer Captain Peter Harratt and arranged for her villa in Brittany, which possessed a secure, hidden bay to be made available to the SOE. The villa became part of the Var escape line run by SOE agent Erwin Deman, which enabled nearly 70 men and women to enter and to exit occupied France without capture.

In June 1941, Lefort joined the British Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force as Aircraft Woman #452845 and served as a policewoman. Her fluency in French brought her to the attention of the SOE, and in January 1943, she volunteered to be a field agent with the F Section (France) of the Special Operations Executive based in London. Lefort was subsequently seconded to the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY). As women serving in the British armed services were barred by statute from armed combat, there was, according to Sarah Helm, &quot;no legal authority for servicewomen to carry out the kind of guerilla work SOE had in mind.&quot; Consequently, women agents were also seconded as members of the FANY, which as a civilian organization was not subject to either armed forces rules or statutes. In February 1943, Lefort began her training at Wanborough House as a field agent. Her training reports were mixed. One Instructor, Lieutenant Tongue, wrote: &quot;This student looks vague; mixed quite well; is interested in the course and could be relied on to be loyal but doubt if she has enough initiative to achieve much.&quot; At the next level of instruction, L/Cpl Gordon reported: &quot;Very ladylike, very English in spite of French background, has a wide circle of friends amongst quite well known and influential people, politicians, gens du monde, artists of the Salon School, all very respectable. Inclined to blurt out things in a rather embarrassing way, which she probably would not have said if she thought first.&quot; In May, she received appointment to an Honorary Commission of Assistant Section Officer in the WAAF.

===France===
On the night of 16 June 1943, with fellow SOE agents Diana Rowden and Noor Inayat Khan, she was flown to a landing field in the Loire Valley where they were met by Henri Dericourt. The assistant F Section Head, Vera Atkins, worried about Lefort&#x27;s poor French accent and Rowden&#x27;s English looks. The Lysander pilot, Bunny Rymills, also felt Lefort&#x27;s French &quot;didn&#x27;t seem that hot.&quot; Her field name was &quot;Alice,&quot; her operational codename was &quot;Teacher,&quot; and her cover name was &quot;Cecile Marguerite Legrand&quot;.

Upon arrival in France, Lefort took a seven-mile bicycle ride to the village of Angers and then caught a train to Paris and then took another to Montelimar where she would serve as courier for the &quot;Jockey network&quot; run by Francis Cammaerts. Geographically, Jockey extended down the left bank of the Rhone between Vienne and Aries and eastwards to the Isere Valley along the Mediterranean north to Lyon and across the Swiss and Italian borders. As his courier, Cammaerts noted that Lefort &quot;conducted various missions, [collected] information to be sent secretly to London, [looked] for dropping grounds for supplying arms and explosives, [acted as] courier, etc&quot;. With the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943, the Jockey network received more supplies and increased its sabotage of railway lines, power stations and other industrial targets. During a large air drop on 13 August 1943, Lefort was responsible for bringing the plane over the zone and carrying the principal light on the ground to help the pilot locate the drop zone. Her leader, Francis Cammaerts, commented that Lefort &quot;was very shy and I think too frail for this hard work she very courageously carried out&quot;.

===Arrest, imprisonment &amp; death===
The increase in sabotage activities drew greater German attention to the Jockey area, and Cammaerts warned the circuit to be very careful and avoid areas such as his former headquarters in Montelimar. Stuck late at night and ignoring the warning, Lefort and the Jockey Circuit sabotage instructor, Pierre Reynaud, on 15 September 1943, went to the home of Raymond Daujat, the local resistance leader in Montelimar. Possibly tipped off, the Gestapo sent some SS men to the house to arrest whoever was there; Reynaud and Daujat escaped while Lefort was arrested hiding in the cellar. Cammaerts, very security conscious, was incensed about Lefort&#x27;s mistake that led to her capture. Her arrest forced him to disperse his network, immediately relocating himself and his associates to safer places in anticipation that Lefort might reveal secrets to the Germans under interrogation or torture. He would later say that she &quot;ought never to have been sent to France.&quot;

Lefort was sent first to a prison in Lyon and then north to the Fresnes prison in Paris where she was brutally interrogated. On 1 February 1944, Lefort was deported to Ravensbruck concentration camp with several hundred other women and while on the trip dropped a note to her husband saying: &quot;Left for Germany, in the convoy of women. Good health, good morale. Warn the Red Cross to send shoes, warm clothes, and food&quot;. In the summer of 1944, Lefort sent another message to her husband, giving Ravensbruck as her address, which he duly passed on to the SOE. Lefort arrived at the camp on 3 February, was given the prison number 27.962 and a stitched red political triangle on her prison clothes. While imprisoned, Lefort was discovered to have had either stomach cancer or stomach ulcers, and was successfully operated on by the camp Doctor, Percival Treite. Lefort subsequently &quot;thrived&quot; on a thick porridge and vegetable soup in Treite&#x27;s belief this would cure her. Upon her return to the main camp, Lefort – along with other prisoners – was made to do hard labour, and by January 1945, she was suffering from extreme malnutrition, diarrhoea and exhaustion.

In early 1945, Lefort volunteered for transfer to the Uckermark death complex, believing rumors that it was for sick prisoners with better medical facilities, no work requirement and no morning roll call. Located approximately one half-mile from the main camp, Uckermark was the former youth detention camp or Jugendlager, and was converted into an extermination center under the supervision of SS-Obersturmführer Johann Schwarzhuber – the recently arrived deputy commandant of Ravensbrück. A fellow inmate, Sylvia Salvesen, recalled Lefort approaching her about the transfer and wanting her approval: &quot;She blurted all this out in a rush, nervous and excited. Her eyes were terror-stricken and she was nervous of my answer.&quot; Despite Salvesen&#x27;s warning, Lefort and two other English prisoners, Mary O&#x27;Shaughnessy and Mary Young went to the camp. Another British inmate nurse, Mary Lindell De Moncy, told Atkins that she had sent recall messages to the three Englishwomen to return to the main camp, but while O&#x27;Shaughnessy did so, Lefort refused to leave Young, who was in a very bad condition. According to O&#x27;Shaughnessy, sometime in February 1945, Lefort&#x27;s name was called out from a selection list during a morning roll and was taken away to be gassed. She and the other prisoners were placed in trucks and transported to the main camp (Ravensbrück) where prisoners were gassed in groups of about 150.

After the war, Dr. Lefort, Atkins and civil and legal authorities questioned several witnesses in an unsuccessful attempt to establish a precise date for Lefort&#x27;s death. Consequently, Lloyd&#x27;s of London, the official executor of Lefort&#x27;s will, accepted the date of 1 May 1945 for &quot;official purposes as the date of her presumed death.&quot;

==Aftermath==
Three other female members of the SOE were executed by either shooting or hanging at Ravensbrück in February 1945: Denise Bloch, Lilian Rolfe, and Violette Szabo. Lefort was among 12 female British SOE F-Section agents who were executed at concentration camps. The War Office describes their deaths as Killed in Action.

Schwarzhuber was convicted by the British at the Hamburg Ravensbrück trials. He was hanged by Albert Pierrepoint in Hameln prison on 3 May 1947.

==Honours==
In September 1945, Major General Colin Gubbins, Head of SOE, recommended that Lefort be appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE):
This officer (C.M. Lefort) was landed in France by aircraft in June 1943 as courier to an important circuit in the South East. She worked with tireless energy and devotion for three months, often in conditions of grave danger and rendered valuable assistance to her commanding officer. She travelled (sic) extensively throughout South Eastern France carrying messages to the various groups of the organization and showed great coolness and presence of mind in passing many police controls.
 On 10 September 1943, S/O LEFORT was arrested by the Gestapo. Although severely interrogated and ill-treated she gave no vital information away. She was last heard of in a concentration camp in Germany, and is still missing.
 For her courage, perseverance and devotion to duty it is recommended that this officer be appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (Military Division)
Lefort was Mentioned in Despatches for her services on 13 June 1946 and honoured by the government of France with a posthumous Croix de Guerre on 14 January 1948. She is listed on the Runnymede Memorial in Surrey, England, the Tempsford Memorial close to RAF Tempsford, and on the &quot;Roll of Honor&quot; on the Valençay SOE Memorial in Valençay, France. she is also listed on the FANY memorial at St Paul&#x27;s Church, Knightsbridge, London and on a memorial plaque to the four executed SOE agents at Ravensbruck concentration Camp.

<text>São Luís (; &quot;Saint Louis&quot;) is the capital and largest city of the Brazilian state of Maranhão. The city is located on Upaon-açu Island or Ilha de São Luís, in the Baía de São Marcos (&quot;Saint Mark&#x27;s Bay&quot;), an extension of the Atlantic Ocean which forms the estuary of Pindaré, Mearim, Itapecuru and other rivers. Its coordinates are 2.53° south, 44.30° west. São Luís has the second largest maritime extension within Brazilian states. Its maritime extension is 640 km (397 miles). The city proper has a population of some 1,037,775 people (2022 IBGE census). The metropolitan area totals 1,536,017, ranked as the 15th largest in Brazil.

São Luís, created originally as &quot;Saint-Louis-de-Maragnan&quot;, is the only Brazilian state capital founded by France (see France Équinoxiale) and it is one of the three Brazilian state capitals located on islands (the others are Vitória and Florianópolis). The historic center of the city (dating from the 17th century) has its original street plan preserved and was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.

The city has two major sea ports: Madeira Port and Itaqui Port, through which a substantial part of Brazil&#x27;s iron ore, originating from the (pre)-Amazon region, is exported. The city&#x27;s main industries are metallurgical with Alumar, and Vale. São Luís is home of the Federal University of Maranhão and Estadual University of Maranhão.

São Luís was the home town of famous Brazilian samba singer Alcione, Brazilian writers Aluísio Azevedo, Ferreira Gullar and Josué Montello, Belgian-naturalised soccer player Luís Oliveira, and the musician João do Vale, a (MPB) singer.

== History ==

Originally, the town was a large village of the Tupinambá tribe. The first Europeans to settle it were the French, in 1612, who intended to make it the center of a colony named Equinoctial France, under the command of Daniel de la Touche, Seigneur de la Ravardière, and Admiral François de Razilly. They built a fort named &quot;Saint-Louis de Maragnan&quot; after King Louis XIII and his Saintly ancestor Louis IX, the construction of which marked the date of foundation of the city, September 8. Portugal conquered the settlement in 1615 in the battle of Guaxenduba and renamed the city &quot;São Luís&quot;.

Because there had been little time for the French to build a city, there is some controversy as to the actual date of the founding of the city, whether by the French or the Portuguese.

In November 1641, the city was invaded by the Dutch. However, they abandoned Maranhão in 1644.

In 1677, the city was made the seat of the new Roman Catholic Diocese of São Luís do Maranhão.

Only when those invasions ceased permanently did the colonial government decide to create the state of Grão-Pará e Maranhão, independent from the rest of the country. By that time, the economy was based on agriculture, particularly the exportation of sugar cane, cacao and tobacco. Conflicts amongst the local elites would lead to the Beckman&#x27;s Revolt. This started due to the struggle between Jesuits and landowners, the first against the Indian slavery and the others against the unfair treatment given by the Portuguese authorities; the situation lead to an uprising against the Portuguese, led by the brothers Manoel and Tomás Beckman and lasted till the intervention of Portuguese troops under the command of the general Gomes Freire de Andrade. After few skirmishes, the rebels were defeated and the Beckman brothers arrested and, after a brief trial, were hanged, drawn and quartered. The last words of Manuel Beckman at the gallows were &quot;Pelo Povo do Maranhão morro contente&quot; (&quot;By the Maranhão people I die happy&quot;). The phrase decorates the main hall of State Council Building.

Soon after the outbreak of the American Civil War, the region started to provide cotton to Great Britain. The wealth generated by this activity was used to modernize the city; to bring religious men to come and teach in its schools; and supplement the water supply. The city came to be the third most populous city in the country. By the end of the 19th century, agriculture was in decay and since then the city&#x27;s population has been searching for other ways to make a living.

Nowadays, São Luís has the largest and best preserved heritage of colonial Portuguese architecture of all Latin America. The island is known as the &quot;Island of Love&quot; and as &quot;the Brazilian Athens&quot;, due to its many poets and writers, such as Sotero dos Reis, Aluísio Azevedo, Graça Aranha, Gonçalves Dias (the most famous), Josué Montello, Ferreira Gullar, among others. The city is also known as &quot;the Brazilian Jamaica&quot; because of the popularity of Reggae Music.

The ancestral composition of São Luís, according to an autosomal DNA study, is 42% European, 39% Native American and 19% African.

== Economy ==
Until the mid-nineteenth century, Maranhão&#x27;s economy was one of the most prosperous in the country. However, after the Civil War in the United States of America, when it lost space in the export of cotton, the state went into decline. Only after the end of the 1960s did the state begin to receive incentives and emerge from seclusion, by way of road and rail connections with other regions.

In the late eighteenth century, increased international demand for cotton to meet the English textile industry coupled with reduced production because of the Revolutionary War in the United States provided the perfect setting to stimulate cotton production in Maranhão. Shipping companies and Southampton &amp; Company Maranha Maranha Shipping Company, shipping steam, which performed the transportation of cotton from the states of Georgia and Alabama, began operating in St. Louis shaft - London, leading to production of Caxias and Baixada Maranhão. By the early twentieth century, St. Louis still exporting cotton to England by sea, through the lines and Booth Red Cross Line Line (the extended route to Iquitos) and company-Maranha Liverpool Shipping Company.

During this golden period of the Maranhão economy São Luís had a lively cultural effervescence. The city had more in common with the European capitals than the other Brazilian cities. It was the first to receive an Italian opera and received the latest news about French literature every week. The rich cotton producers and local businessmen sent their children to study in Recife, Salvador, Rio de Janeiro and as far as Europe.

The opening of the Port of Alumar, Port of Itaqui and Port of Ponta da Madeira, currently the second deepest in the world, second only to the Rotterdam, is one of the busiest in the country. It serves as a gateway for industrial production and iron ore arriving from the Carajás Railway, operated by Companhia Vale do Rio Doce and also exports soybeans grown in southern Maranhão and central Brazil, transported by the Carajás Railway and North-South Railway. The port&#x27;s proximity to strategic markets in Europe and North America has led it to become an attractive option for exporting goods, but suffers from increased coastal shipping.

The São Luís economy is based on aluminum processing (ALUMAR), pelleting industry (VALE), food production and tourism. São Luís has the largest GDP in the state, hosting two public universities (and UFMA UEMA) and various educational institutions and private colleges. According to the latest data from the IBGE survey, São Luís has a GDP of R$9,340,944,000.00, occupying 14th position amongst state capitals.

In neighbouring Alcântara there is the Alcântara Space Center.

== Geography ==

The island of Upaon-Açu is located between two large estuarine systems that are the bays of São Marcos on the west side and São José on the east in the central region of Golfão Maranhense. The two bays are interconnected in the southwest by the channels of the Strait of Mosquitoes and Strait of Coqueiros (separating the island of Upaon-Açu from the island of Tauá-Mirim).

In the São Marcos bay, the watershed of the Mearim river and its tributaries flows, while in the São José/Arraial bay the watersheds of the Itapecuru and Munim rivers break. In this region, the amplitude of the tides can exceed seven meters. The region presents numerous streams and tidal channels. Several agents have modeled relief such as those of climatic, hydrological and oceanographic origin, as well as intense wind, marine and fluvial activity, with vegetation characterized by remnants of the Amazonian Forest, Mangroves and Campo de Perizes, an extensive fluvial plain with predominantly herbaceous, located on the mainland.

The climate is characterized as hot, semi-humid, tropical of equatorial zone, with two distinct seasons that go from damp (January to June) the drought (July to December), with average rainfall of 2,200 mm per year. Some of the conservation units of the island are: APA das Reentrancias Maranhenses; APA of Upaon-Açu-Miritiba-Alto Preguiças, APA of Itapiracó; APA of the Maracanã Region; and the Bacanga State Parks, the Jansen Lagoon and the Rangedor.

On the Strait of Mosquitoes, there are road and railroad bridges linking the mainland to Upaon-Açu Island: the Marcelino Machado bridge, BR-135, composed of two parallel inlet and outlet bridges (456 and 454 meters in length); the metal bridge Benedito Leite, belonging to the São Luís-Teresina Railway; the duplicate bridge belonging to the Carajás Railway; the metal bridge that supports the Italuís waterway, which carries water from the river Itapecuru to the city of São Luís.

There is also a ferry service, between São Luís and Alcântara; and São Luís International Airport.

The municipality contains part of the Upaon-Açu/Miritiba/Alto Preguiças Environmental Protection Area, created in 1992.
The city is home to the Sítio Rangedor State Park, formerly the fully protected Sítio Rangedor Ecological Station.
The municipality also contains a small part of the Baixada Maranhense Environmental Protection Area, a sustainable use conservation unit created in 1991 that has been a Ramsar Site since 2000.
The Bacanga State Park is just south of the city.

The city of São Luís experiences a very marginal dry-summer tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification: As), bordering on a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification: Am). The city possesses a short dry season from August to November. During this period when the equatorial rainband associated with the highly seasonalized positioning of the Intertropical Convergence Zone is not over the city, warm to hot temperatures and abundant equatorial sunshine prevail. Conversely, the humid, rainy wet season dominates the remaining majority of the year, with abundant cloud cover prevalent and heavy rains falling from January to June, with the heaviest rainfall and highest cloud cover from January to May. The cloudiest month of the year is March with a monthly average of 107.2 hours of bright sunshine throughout the month, while the sunniest month of the year is August with a monthly average of 260.3 hours of sunshine throughout the month.

It also has some cultural peculiarities namely:

=== Tambor de Crioula ===
Tambor de Crioula is an Afro-Brazilian dance in which gaily clad women court a bateria of tambors (a row of drums). Whirling and gyrating in time to the music they negotiate for prime position in the centre of the bateria. The House of Tambor de Crioula is a museum dedicated to preserving and spreading the cultural manifestation.

=== Tambor de Mina ===
Not to be confused with the above, Tambor de Mina is the local variant of the Afro-Brazilian religion. Casa das Minas (Querebentã de Tói Zomadônu or House of Minas), the oldest temple (&quot;terreiro&quot;), which must have been founded in São Luís in the 1840s, by African women.

=== Bumba Meu Boi ===

The Bumba Meu Boi is a popular farce which takes its form as a grand musical pantomime. Practice is a public affair and begins directly after Easter reaching its climax in June when literally hundreds of groups perform on a nightly basis for popular acclaim. Set personalities and characters play out a comedic tragedy with a metaphor for social harmony at its heart. Settlers, the infamous &quot;Coroneis&quot;, Indians, spirit workers, African slaves and forest spirits are enacted though costumes, choreography and music - all performed amongst the all-night revelry. The crowd joins in with singing, dancing and dependent on the groups sotaque (or style) the playing of matracas (two wooden blocks, held in each hand and struck together repeatedly). Like the festival of Sao João and its requisite Forró dance in the North-Eastern states further south Bumba Meu Boi is a harvest festival but with the bull as its centre-piece.

=== Capoeira ===
The São Luís form of capoeira is said to be akin to the kind of capoeira now recognized as &#x27;traditional bahian capoeira&#x27; that predated the Bahian Angola/regional polemic which split the capoeira world in the 1950s.

=== Historic centre ===
The Historic Centre of São Luís was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. It differs from other historic centers in Brazil due to the quantity and density of sobrados, the Portuguese urban town house; the largest collection of exterior azulejos in Brazil; and it is a rare example of a Portuguese colonial planned city in Brazil on a grid. Starting in 1989 there has been an extensive program to restore and renovate the colonial era buildings of the city&#x27;s historical center. Notable examples of historic properties are the Metropolitan Cathedral of Our Lady of Victory, the Church of Pantaleão, the Fort of Santo Antônio da Barra de São Luís, and the Ribeirão and Pedras fountains.

<text>The Battle of Blore Heath took place during the English Wars of the Roses on 23 September 1459, at Blore Heath, Staffordshire. Blore Heath is a sparsely-populated area of farmland two miles east of the town of Market Drayton in Shropshire, and close to the village of Loggerheads, Staffordshire.

== Background ==

After the First Battle of St Albans in 1455, an uneasy peace held in England. Attempts at reconciliation between the houses of Lancaster and York enjoyed marginal success. However, both sides became increasingly wary of each other and by 1459 were actively recruiting armed supporters. Queen Margaret of Anjou continued to raise support for King Henry VI amongst noblemen, distributing an emblem of a silver swan to knights and squires enlisted by her personally, whilst the Yorkist command under the Duke of York was finding plenty of anti-royal support despite the severe punishment for raising arms against the king.

The Yorkist force based at Middleham Castle, Yorkshire (led by the Earl of Salisbury) needed to link up with the main Yorkist army at Ludlow Castle in Shropshire. As Salisbury marched south-west through the Midlands, the queen ordered Lord Audley to intercept them.

==Battle==

Audley chose the barren heathland of Blore Heath to set up an ambush. On the morning of 23 September 1459 (Saint Thecla&#x27;s day), a force of some 10,000 men took up a defensive position behind a &#x27;great hedge&#x27; on the south-western edge of Blore Heath facing the direction of Newcastle-under-Lyme to the north-east, the direction from which Salisbury was approaching.

Yorkist scouts spotted Lancastrian banners over the top of a hedge and immediately warned Salisbury. As they emerged from the woodland, the Yorkist force of some 5,000 men realized that a much larger enemy force was awaiting their arrival. Salisbury, instead of disbanding or withdrawing his army, immediately arranged his troops into battle order, just out of range of the Lancastrian archers. To secure his right flank, he arranged the supply wagons in a defensive laager, a circular formation to provide cover to the men. Fearing a rout, Yorkist soldiers are reported to have kissed the ground beneath them, supposing that this would be the ground on which they would meet their deaths.

The two armies were separated by about 300 metres on the barren heathland. A steep-sided, wide and fast-flowing brook ran between them. The brook made Audley&#x27;s position seemingly impenetrable.

Initially, both leaders attempted to parley in an attempt to avoid bloodshed. In keeping with many late medieval battles, the conflict opened with an archery duel between the longbows of both armies. At Blore Heath, that proved inconclusive because of the distance between the two sides.

Salisbury, aware that any attack across the brook would be suicidal, employed a ruse to encourage the enemy to attack him. He withdrew some of his middle-order just far enough that the Lancastrians believed them to be retreating. The Lancastrians launched a cavalry charge. After they had committed themselves, Salisbury ordered his men to turn back and catch the Lancastrians as they attempted to cross the brook. It is possible that the order for the Lancastrian charge was not given by Audley, but it had the effect of turning the balance in favour of Salisbury. The charge resulted in heavy casualties for the Lancastrians.

The Lancastrians withdrew and then made a second assault possibly in an attempt to rescue casualties. The second attack was more successful with many Lancastrians crossing the brook. That led to a period of intense fighting in which Audley himself was killed, possibly by Sir Roger Kynaston of Myddle and Hordley.
The Earl of Salisbury, which knew the sleights, strategies and policies of warlike affairs, suddenly returned, and shortly encountered with the Lord Audley and his chief captains, ere the residue of his army could pass the water. The fight was sore and dreadful. The earl desiring the saving of his life, and his adversaries coveting his destruction, fought sore for the obtaining of their purpose, but in conclusion, the earl&#x27;s army, as men desperate of aid and succour, so eagerly fought, that they slew the Lord Audley, and all his captains, and discomfited all the remnant of his people...

The death of Audley meant that Lancastrian command fell to the second-in-command, Lord Dudley, who ordered an attack on foot with some 4,000 men. As this attack also failed, some 500 Lancastrians joined the enemy and began attacking their own side. At this point, all remaining Lancastrian resistance collapsed, and the Yorkists had only to advance to complete the rout.

The rout continued through the night, with the Yorkists pursuing the fleeing enemy for miles across the countryside.

At least 2,000 Lancastrians were killed, with the Yorkists losing nearly 1,000.

== Aftermath ==
Salisbury was concerned that Lancastrian reinforcements were in the vicinity and was keen to press on southwards towards Ludlow. He made his camp on a hillside by Market Drayton that later took the name Salisbury Hill. According to Gregory&#x27;s Chronicle, Salisbury employed a local friar to remain on Blore Heath throughout the night and to periodically discharge a cannon to deceive any Lancastrians nearby into believing that the fight was continuing.

Audley is buried in Darley Abbey, Derbyshire.

== Commemorations ==

Audley&#x27;s Cross was erected at Blore Heath after the battle to mark the spot where Audley was slain. It was replaced with a stone cross in 1765.

The battle was commemorated by a re-enactment each year in September at Blore Heath until 2010.

<doc id="354408" wikidata="Q165648" url="?curid=354408" title="Arshile Gorky">
<text>Arshile Gorky ( ; born Vostanik Manoug Adoian, ; April 15, 1904 – July 21, 1948) was an Armenian-American painter who had a seminal influence on Abstract Expressionism. He spent the last years of his life as a national of the United States. Along with Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, Gorky has been hailed as one of the most powerful American painters of the 20th century. The suffering and loss he experienced in the Armenian genocide had crucial influence at Gorky&#x27;s development as an artist.

==Early life==
Vostanik Adoian was born in the village of Khorgom (today&#x27;s Dilkaya), situated on the shores of Lake Van in the Ottoman Empire (modern-day Turkey). His birthdate is often cited as April 15, 1904, but the year might have been 1902 or 1903. Toward the end of his life, he was particularly vague about his date of birth, changing it from year to year. In 1908, his father emigrated to the United States to avoid the draft, leaving his family behind in the town of Van. He settled in Providence, Rhode Island.
In 1915, he fled Lake Van during the Armenian genocide and escaped with his mother and three sisters into Russian-controlled territory. In the aftermath of the genocide, his mother died of starvation in Yerevan in 1919. Arriving in America in 1920, at the age of 16, he was reunited with his father, but they never grew close.

In the process of reinventing his identity, he changed his name to &quot;Arshile Gorky&quot;, claiming to be a Georgian noble (taking the Georgian name Arshile/Archil), and even telling people he was a relative of the Russian writer Maxim Gorky.

==Career==
In 1923, Gorky enrolled in the recently founded New England School of Art in Boston, eventually becoming a part-time instructor. During the early 1920s he was influenced by Impressionism, although later in the decade he produced works that were more postimpressionist. During this time he was living in New York and was influenced by Paul Cézanne. In 1925, he was asked by Edmund Greacen of the Grand Central Art Galleries to teach at the Grand Central School of Art; Gorky accepted and remained with them until 1931. His notable students included Revington Arthur.

In 1927, Gorky met Ethel Kremer Schwabacher and developed a lifelong friendship. Schwabacher was his first biographer. Gorky said:
The stuff of thought is the seed of the artist. Dreams form the bristles of the artist&#x27;s brush. As the eye functions as the brain&#x27;s sentry, I communicate my innermost perceptions through the art, my worldview.

In 1931, Gorky sent a group of works ranging in price from $100 to $450 to the Downtown Gallery in New York. (The artist&#x27;s name was spelled &quot;Archele Gorki&quot; in the gallery&#x27;s records. Most of Gorky&#x27;s works from this period were unsigned.) The exact nature of their relationship is unknown. Mrs. John D. Rockefeller (Abby Aldrich Rockefeller) purchased from the gallery a Cézannesque still life by Gorky titled &quot;Fruit&quot;. Gorky may have been introduced to the gallery owner by Stuart Davis who regularly exhibited there.

In 1935, Gorky became one of the first artists employed by the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project. This later came to include such artists as Alice Neel, Lee Krasner, Jackson Pollock, Diego Rivera and Mark Rothko.

In 1935, Gorky signed a three-year contract with the Guild Art Gallery (37 West Fifty-seventh Street, New York). Co-owned by Anna Walinska and Margaret Lefranc, but funded and directed by Lefranc, the gallery organized the artist&#x27;s first solo exhibition in New York, &quot;Abstract Drawings by Arshile Gorky&quot;.

Notable paintings from this time include &quot;Landscape in the Manner of Cézanne&quot; (1927) and &quot;Landscape, Staten Island&quot; (1927–1928). At the close of the 1920s and into the 1930s he experimented with cubism, eventually moving to surrealism. The painting illustrated above, &quot;The Artist and His Mother&quot;, (ca. 1926–1936) is a memorable, moving and innovative portrait. His &quot;The Artist and His Mother&quot; paintings are based on a childhood photograph taken in Van in which he is depicted standing beside his mother. Gorky made two versions; the other is in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. The painting has been likened to Ingres for simplicity of line and smoothness, to Egyptian funerary art for pose, to Cézanne for flat planar composition, to Picasso for form and color.

&quot;Nighttime, Enigma, Nostalgia&quot; (1930–1934) are the series of complex works that characterize this phase of his painting. The canvas &quot;Portrait of Master Bill&quot; appears to depict Gorky&#x27;s friend, Willem de Kooning. De Kooning said: &quot;I met a lot of artists – but then I met Gorky ... He had an extraordinary gift for hitting the nail on the head; remarkable. So I immediately attached myself to him and we became very good friends. It was nice to be foreigners meeting in some new place.&quot; However recent publications contradict the claim that the painting is of de Kooning but is actually a portrait of a Swedish carpenter Gorky called Master Bill who did some work for him in exchange for Gorky giving him art lessons.
When Gorky showed his new work to André Breton in the 1940s, after seeing the new paintings and in particular &quot;The Liver Is the Cock&#x27;s Comb&quot;, Breton declared the painting to be &quot;one of the most important paintings made in America&quot; and he stated that Gorky was a Surrealist, which was Breton&#x27;s highest compliment. The painting was shown in the Surrealists&#x27; final show at the Galérie Maeght in Paris in 1947.

Michael Auping, a curator at the Modern Art Museum in Fort Worth, saw in the work a &quot;taut sexual drama&quot; combined with nostalgic allusions to Gorky&#x27;s Armenian past. The work in 1944 shows his emergence in the 1940s from the influence of Cézanne and Picasso into his own style, and is perhaps his greatest work. It is over six feet high and eight feet wide, depicting &quot;an abstract landscape filled with watery plumes of semi-transparent color that coalesce around spiky, thorn like shapes, painted in thin, sharp black lines, as if to suggest beaks and claws.&quot;

==Personal life==
Artist Corinne Michelle West was Gorky&#x27;s muse and probably his lover, although she refused to marry him when he proposed several times.

In 1941, Gorky met and married Agnes Ethel Magruder (1921–2013), daughter of Admiral John Holmes Magruder, Jr. (1889–1963). Gorky soon nicknamed her &quot;Mougouch&quot;, an Armenian term of endearment. They had two daughters, Maro and Yalda (renamed Natasha some months later). Maro Gorky became a painter, and married the British sculptor and writer Matthew Spender, son of the poet Sir Stephen Spender.

From 1946, Gorky suffered a series of crises: his studio barn burned down (destroying his library and thirty of his paintings); he underwent a colostomy for cancer; Mougouch had an affair with Roberto Matta. In 1948, Gorky&#x27;s neck was broken and his painting arm temporarily paralyzed in a car accident, and his wife left him, taking their children with her. She later married British writer Xan Fielding.

On July 21, 1948, after telling a neighbor and one of his students that he was going to kill himself, Gorky was found hanged in his barn studio. On a nearby wooden crate he had written &quot;Goodbye My Loveds&quot;. Gorky is buried in North Cemetery in Sherman, Connecticut.
==Legacy==

Gorky&#x27;s contributions to American and world art are difficult to overestimate. His work as lyrical abstraction was a &quot;new language. He &quot;lit the way for two generations of American artists&quot;. The painterly spontaneity of mature works like &quot;The Liver is the Cock&#x27;s Comb&quot; (1944), &quot;One Year the Milkweed&quot; (1944), and &quot;The Betrothal II&quot; (1947) immediately prefigured Abstract expressionism, and leaders in the New York School have acknowledged Gorky&#x27;s considerable influence. Gorky had a distinct, signature style and was known for his draftsmanship. He used twisted but elegant lines to bring in &#x27;biomorphic&#x27; forms in his abstract paintings along with an overlay of colours to create a complex landscape of lines and colours on the canvas.

His oeuvre synthesizes Surrealism and the sensuous color and painterliness of the School of Paris with his own highly personal formal vocabulary. His paintings and drawings hang in every major American museum including the National Gallery of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan, Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art in Eugene, and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York (which maintains the Gorky Archive), and in many worldwide, including the Tate in London.

A selection of Gorky&#x27;s letters were translated and published by Karlen Mooradian in &quot;Arshile Gorky Adoian and The Many Worlds of Arshile Gorky&quot; in 1980. Matthew Spender (1999) and Nouritza Matossian (2000) concluded from their research that the translations of Gorky&#x27;s letters to his younger sister, Vartoosh, published by her son, Mooradian, had been embellished and some of these letters were fabricated by Mooradian. The most accurate translations of Gorky&#x27;s letters to family and friends were published at &quot;Goats on the Roof: A Life in Letters and Documents&quot; (2009), edited by Spender with translations by Father Krikor Maksoudian.

Fifteen of Gorky&#x27;s paintings and drawings were destroyed in the crash of American Airlines Flight 1 in 1962.

In June 2005, the family of the artist established the Arshile Gorky Foundation, a not-for-profit corporation formed to further the public&#x27;s appreciation and understanding of the life and artistic achievements of Gorky. The foundation is working on a catalogue raisonné of the artist&#x27;s entire body of work. In October 2009, the foundation relaunched its website to provide accurate information on the artist, including a biography, bibliography, exhibition history, and list of archival sources.
&quot;Without Gorky&quot; is a documentary film about the artist, made by Cosima Spender, his granddaughter.

In October 2009, the Philadelphia Museum of Art held a major Arshile Gorky exhibition: &quot;Arshile Gorky: A Retrospective&quot;. On June 6, 2010, an exhibit of the same name opened at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in Los Angeles. In 2021, during routine maintenance of &quot;The Limit,&quot; a hidden painting was discovered underneath; both paintings were exhibited and included in the latest catalogue of his work.

In 2015, a fountain monument commemorating Gorky was erected in Edremit, a town near his birthplace. After the town&#x27;s People&#x27;s Democracy Party administration was replaced by government appointees the water supply to the fountain was cut off, the taps were broken off, and signs with Gorky&#x27;s biography in four languages – Armenian, Kurdish, English and Turkish – were removed from the monument.

Gorky&#x27;s estate has been represented by Hauser &amp; Wirth since 2016. It previously worked with Gagosian Gallery.

In October 2023 a potential work by Gorky, partially covered in white household paint by the artist himself, was the subject of an episode in the BBC art history series &quot;Fake or Fortune?&quot;

<doc id="354409" wikidata="Q7592927" url="?curid=354409" title="St Cyprian's School">
<text>St Cyprian&#x27;s School was an English preparatory school for boys, which operated in the early 20th century in Eastbourne, East Sussex. Like other preparatory schools, its purpose was to train pupils to do well enough in the examinations (usually taken around the age of 13) to gain admission to leading public schools, and to provide an introduction to boarding school life.

==History==
St Cyprian&#x27;s was founded in 1899 by Lewis Vaughan Wilkes and his wife Cicely Comyn, a newly married couple in their twenties. It originally operated in a large house in Carlisle Road, but by 1906 had grown sufficiently to move into new purpose-built facilities with extensive playing fields behind Summerdown Road. The school ran with the prevailing ethos of Muscular Christianity which had typified private education since the time of Thomas Arnold of Rugby, and placed much emphasis on developing self-reliance and integrity (&quot;Character&quot;). In these and many other respects St Cyprian&#x27;s was little different from the other leading prep schools of the time. The school submitted itself annually to an independent academic assessment, conducted by Sir Charles Grant Robertson fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. The school uniform was a green shirt with a pale blue collar, corduroy breeches and a cap with a Maltese Cross for a badge.
The high success rate in achieving scholarships to leading public schools including Eton and Harrow attracted ambitious parents. However, the Wilkeses appreciated that public school scholarships were really intended for talented children from less well-off families, and so they provided places at St Cyprian&#x27;s at significantly reduced fees for deserving cases, in the hope that they would attain these scholarships. Two further features distinguished St Cyprian&#x27;s. The first was the proximity to South Downs, which was fully exploited to give opportunities to the boys for running wild, studying natural history, walking, picnics, riding and even golf on the adjacent links. The second was the overwhelming impact of Mrs Wilkes (known as &quot;Mum&quot;). She was in total control of the school and in the days before female emancipation this made a great impression on her charges. The resulting ambivalence was exacerbated by a fiery temper and by the way her mood flipped between firm discipline and generous indulgence. Mrs Wilkes was a great believer in history teaching and saw the Harrow History Prize as an opportunity to bring it into the classics-dominated curriculum. Mrs Wilkes also taught English, and stimulated generations of writers with her emphasis on clear, high quality writing. In addition to Mrs Wilkes, a major influence was the second master R. L. Sillar, who joined the school staff soon after it opened and stayed for 30 years. With his interest in natural history, his skill at shooting, his art teaching and his magic lantern shows he broadened the curriculum considerably and is revered in Old Boy&#x27;s accounts. 

In its fortieth year, the school building was gutted by fire on 14 May 1939, and a housemaid died in a fall from an upper window. Emergency accommodation was arranged at Ascham St. Vincent&#x27;s School, the buildings of a preparatory school in Eastbourne which had recently closed. On 20 July 1939, St Cyprian&#x27;s moved to Whispers, near Midhurst in West Sussex. It stayed there for 18 months until the building was requisitioned by the army during World War II. As a result of this double blow, numbers dwindled and after a brief combination with Rosehill School in Gloucestershire the remaining boys went with the then-headmaster, W. J. V. Tomlinson (Bill), to join the old rival Summer Fields School, in Oxford. The school playing fields were sold to Eastbourne College.

In April 1997, Eastbourne Civic Society (now The Eastbourne Society), in conjunction with the County Borough of Eastbourne, erected a blue plaque at the house in Summerdown Road which was connected with the school and which was Mrs Wilkes&#x27;s residence in later years.

==Accounts and recollections==
The school&#x27;s three most prominent writers included accounts of the school in their works. Connolly recalled his time at St Cyprian&#x27;s in &quot;Enemies of Promise&quot;, published in 1938 with the name of the school disguised as &quot;St. Wulfric&#x27;s&quot;. With wry humour, he mocked the Wilkes and the ethos of &quot;Character building&quot;, writing &quot;We called the headmistress Flip and the headmaster Sambo. Flip, around whom the whole system revolved, was able, ambitious, temperamental and energetic.&quot; Connolly questioned the practice of British parents sending young children to boarding preparatory schools but concluded &quot;Yet St [Cyprian&#x27;s] where I now went was a well run and vigorous example which did me a world of good.&quot;

His friend, George Orwell, disagreed and wrote disparagingly and bitterly of the school in the quasi-autobiographical essay &quot;Such, Such Were the Joys&quot;, first published in the &quot;Partisan Review&quot; (Sept.- Oct. 1952). By Orwell&#x27;s own admission this was too libelous to print and under British libel laws could not be published while the people described in it were still living. It appeared in print in the United States in 1952 with the name of the school changed to &quot;Crossgates&quot;, but not in the United Kingdom until after the death of Mrs. Wilkes. The thrust of Orwell&#x27;s criticism was directed at the system of boarding school education that sent children away from their homes when they were no more than 7 or 8 years old, and at the unreflective elitism and classism of Britain before the First World War. This is evident from one of the closing passages of Orwell&#x27;s essay.&quot;How would St Cyprian&#x27;s appear to me now, if I could go back, at my present age, and see it as it was in 1915? What should I think of Sambo and Flip, those terrible, all-powerful monsters? I should see them as a couple of silly, shallow, ineffectual people, eagerly clambering up a social ladder which any thinking person could see to be on the point of collapse.&quot;

Orwell attacked the presence of &quot;nouveaux riches&quot; and aristocrats at the school, who he thought received preferential treatment. In contrast, Gavin Maxwell&#x27;s parents had chosen the school because it was less elitist and aristocratic than older prep schools. Maxwell found the school tough, but left primarily because he felt he was the target of resentment because of his aristocratic parents with their Scottish estates. Longhurst, who had great admiration for the school and for Mrs. Wilkes, described these authors&#x27; accounts of the school as unrecognizable, and would frequently defend &quot;a very fine school&quot; in response to reviewers of Orwell&#x27;s work. His views were shared by W J L Christie, Indian Civil Service, who wrote a riposte to Orwell in defence of the school in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (owned and edited by Douglas Blackwood). Both were particularly incensed by what in their opinion were totally inaccurate accusations against the Wilkeses.

Cecil Beaton, who was at the school with Orwell, had a different reaction, describing the work as &quot;Hilariously funny – but exaggerated&quot;. Orwell&#x27;s essay has been dissected in detail and its reliability questioned by Pearce.

Nearly all accounts of former pupils declare that the school gave them a good start in life but views of Mrs. Wilkes vary. David Ogilvy is critical, but Alaric Jacob praises her teaching, and Foote, Rivett-Carnac, and Wright refer to her with great affection. It was Connolly who, after reading his parents&#x27; papers, wrote apologetically: &quot;The Wilkes were true friends and I had caricatured their mannerisms ... and read mercenary motives into much that was just enthusiasm&quot; and he described Mrs. Wilkes as &quot;a warm-hearted and inspired teacher&quot;.

Walter Christie&#x27;s cap and other items are currently displayed at the Chalk Farm Hotel in Willingdon.

<doc id="354411" wikidata="Q4745375" url="?curid=354411" title="American Whig–Cliosophic Society">
<text>The American Whig–Cliosophic Society, sometimes abbreviated as Whig-Clio, is a political, literary, and debating society at Princeton University and the oldest debate union in the United States. Its precursors, the American Whig Society and the Cliosophic Society, were founded at Princeton in 1769 and 1765. 

The Society frequently hosts events open to all Princeton students, as well as to faculty and community members. These include the Society&#x27;s monthly Senate Debates on topics related to national or campus policy, lectures, discussion dinners with guest speakers, and social events. The Society also oversees four subsidiary groups: the International Relations Council (IRC), Princeton&#x27;s Model Congress (PMC), Princeton Debate Panel (PDP), and Princeton Mock Trial (PMT).

The two original societies continue as &quot;houses&quot; within the larger American Whig–Cliosophic Society, with Whig considered the more liberal house and Clio the more conservative.

== History ==
=== Origins and early years ===
The American Whig-Cliosophic Society has its ancestry in the literary institutions of the Plain-Dealing Club (Whig) and the Well-Meaning Club (Clio), both formed around 1765. An intense rivalry between these clubs led to their suppression by the university in 1769. Persuasion from William Paterson and other alumni led to president John Witherspoon to permit successor organizations. Shortly thereafter, the American Whig Society formed on June 24, 1769 by James Madison, Philip M. Freneau, and Hugh Henry Brackenridge; the Cliosophic Society formed on June 8, 1770 by Nathan Perkins, Robert Stewart, John Smith, and Issac Smith. 

Whig derived its name from the &quot;American Whig&quot; used in essays by William Livingston, a trustee of the college, while Clio derived its name from Paterson. Both societies were assigned rooms in Nassau Hall. 

The societies in their early years served as institutions for members to practice oratory skills, engage in discussions about contemporary issues, and engage in literary activities. Before the American Revolution, they provided future leaders like James Madison, Aaron Burr, and others a place to develop these skills. However, much of the history of the society&#x27;s other activities during this time were lost in a fire in 1802; the only documents remaining from this period relate to the recurring &quot;Paper Wars,&quot; where members of each society would deride each other through verse. The societies became dormant during the Revolution, with Clio resuming in 1781 and Whig in 1782. From this point until around the 1880s when the societies had their greatest influence on Princeton campus life. 

To one historian, the societies &quot;functioned as colleges within the College of New Jersey,&quot; with each respective society having its officers, traditions, curriculum, bylaws, libraries, and diplomas. Talented members were given exclusive opportunities to deliver special addresses and speak in debates. Meetings were held to allow members to practice ahead of these events. Admittance was selective, focusing on academically accomplished students, and much of the societies&#x27; efforts were focused on glory and high achievement over the rest of the student body. The societies served the additional purpose of providing social opportunities to students who were under a rigorous and tightly controlled schedule.


=== 19th and 20th centuries ===
The societies moved to the university&#x27;s new library building, Stanhope Hall, in 1805.

In the decades before the Civil War, the societies frequently debated the subject of slavery. Despite their regional differences, both societies voted regularly in support of slavery&#x27;s continuation and opposition to emancipation. The subject united the two societies, which otherwise often disagreed. Clio&#x27;s members were usually northerners, while Whigs typically came from the southern states.

Competition from eating clubs, sports teams, and other student activities eventually drew members away from the societies. Prompted by declining memberships, the societies were merged to form the American Whig–Cliosophic Society in 1928. 

The Society&#x27;s first female president was Tina Ravitz in 1975. 

=== Contemporary times ===
The organization&#x27;s modern role is to serve as an umbrella organization for political and debating activity at Princeton, as well as host speakers, dinners, lectures, and social events.

In 2024, the society voted to adopt a policy of institutional neutrality based on the University of Chicago&#x27;s Kalven Report and banned considering a speaker&#x27;s political, ideological, and religious beliefs when inviting them. The society held a candidate forum for the 2024 Democratic primary in New Jersey&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, the first event of its kind in the society&#x27;s history. 

== Symbols ==
Originally, the Whig and Cliosophic debating societies&#x27; unofficial colors were red and blue. However, its colors changed after the Civil War when Princeton University adopted orange and black as its colors.

== Subsidiaries ==
=== Princeton Debate Panel ===

The Princeton Debate Panel (PDP) is a collegiate debating society that competes in sanctioned debates by the American Parliamentary Debate Association (APDA) league, of which it was a founding member. In the APDA, PDP has won the Team of the Year award a record eight times and the Speaker of the Year Award a record nine times. PDP hosts a high school and a collegiate tournament during the academic year. 

=== Princeton Mock Trial ===

Princeton Mock Trial (PMT) is a mock trial program that competes with three teams. In the American Mock Trial Association, it ranked 67th in the 2023–2024 season, 124th in the 2022–2023 season, and 175th in the 2021–2022 season. It ranked 2nd in the American Mock Trial Association National Championship in 2014. It annually hosts two Moot Court tournaments for local high schools.

=== International Relations Council ===
The International Relations Council (IRC) is a forum for international issues on campus. It houses the Princeton Model United Nations program, which hosts a high school conference, Princeton Model United Nationals Conference and a collegiate conference, Princeton Diplomatic Invitational. The program also features the Princeton Model UN Travel Team, which competes on the regional and international collegiate circuits.

=== Model Congress ===
Princeton Model Congress (PMC) hosts an annual model congress conference in Washington D.C. for high schoolers. The conference simulates all three branches of federal government and draws approximately 1,200 participants.

=== Honorary Debate Panel ===

The Honorary Debate Panel (WCHDP) sponsors and promotes prize debates at Princeton University. Annually-held debates and oratory contests include the Lynde Prize Debate, the Class of 1876 Memorial Prize for Debate in Politics, the Maclean Prize and Junior Orator Awards, the Walter E. Hope Prizes in Speaking and Debating, the Spencer Trask Medals for Debating, and the William Rusher ’44 Prize in Debating.

== Membership ==
To become a member, Princeton students are required to attend and sign in at three Whig-Clio events. Members of Whig-Clio subsidiaries are automatically considered members in the American Whig–Cliosophic Society.

== Awards ==
The James Madison Award for Distinguished Public Service is a longstanding tradition and the highest distinction bestowed by the Whig-Cliosophic Society to individuals committed to the &quot;betterment of society&quot; who have confronted &quot;some of society’s biggest challenges&quot;. The first woman recipient was Golda Meir in December 1974. The full list of recipients is below. 

In March 2021, the Society voted to revoke Senator Ted Cruz&#x27;s award after he attempted to overturn the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election based on false claims of voter fraud. The Society reversed course a month later and decided not to revoke the award. 
== Governing council ==
The Governing Council is the primary decision-making body of the Society when the Assembly, the body that includes all undergraduate members in good standing, is not in session. It consists of the executive officers, non-executive officers, and subsidiary heads. The executive officers, who include the President, Vice President, Secretary, President of the Senate, Director of Program, Speaker of the Whig Party, and Chair of the Cliosophic Party, are elected by the members of the Society to one-year terms and each have one vote on the Council. The Council is responsible for confirming events, appointing non-executive officers, and making other important decisions for the Society. A quorum for binding decisions is at least half of the voting members, and votes are typically conducted by secret ballot. The Council&#x27;s decisions can be overturned by the Assembly or deemed unconstitutional by the Constitutional Compliance Committee. The current Governing Council is led by President Samuel Kligman. 

== Notable members ==

The Society has had many notable members throughout its history. In politics and government, members have included U.S. Presidents James Madison and Woodrow Wilson; Vice Presidents Aaron Burr and George M. Dallas; and Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito, Oliver Ellsworth, and William Paterson. Influential scholars such as John Rawls and Joseph Nye have also been members. The society has also included renowned writers and journalists, including F. Scott Fitzgerald and Booth Tarkington. Other prominent members have included Adlai Stevenson II, Ted Cruz, Ralph Nader, and Paul Sarbanes. 

==Controversies==
In 2018, Whig-Clio co-presidents disinvited conservative University of Pennsylvania law professor Amy Wax after she had made controversial remarks about the quality of her Black students. 

In 2020, a conservative member of the society stated that he had proposed inviting &quot;The&quot; &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist George Will and federal judge Neomi Rao to speak at the society, but its governing council had voted not to.

<text>Gen Digital Inc. (formerly Symantec Corporation and NortonLifeLock Inc.) is a multinational software company co-headquartered in Tempe, Arizona and Prague, Czech Republic. The company provides cybersecurity software and services. Gen is a Fortune 500 company and a member of the S&amp;P 500 stock-market index. The company also has development centers in Pune, Chennai and Bangalore. Its portfolio includes Norton, Avast, LifeLock, Avira, AVG, ReputationDefender, and CCleaner.

On October 9, 2014, Symantec declared it would split into two independent publicly traded companies by the end of 2015. One company would focus on security, the other on information management. On January 29, 2016, Symantec sold its information-management subsidiary, named Veritas, and which Symantec had acquired in 2004, to The Carlyle Group. On August 8, 2019, Broadcom announced they would be acquiring the Enterprise Security software division of Symantec for $10.7 billion. After the acquisition, Symantec became known as NortonLifeLock. After completing its merger with Avast in September 2022, the company adopted the name Gen Digital.

==History==
===1982 to 1989===
Founded in 1982 by Gary Hendrix with a National Science Foundation grant, Symantec was originally focused on artificial intelligence-related projects, including a database program. Hendrix hired several Stanford University natural language processing researchers as the company&#x27;s first employees.

In 1984, it became clear that the advanced natural language and database system that Symantec had developed could not be ported from DEC minicomputers to the PC. This left Symantec without a product, but with expertise in natural language database query systems and technology. As a result, later in 1984, Symantec was acquired by another, smaller software startup company, C&amp;E Software, founded by Denis Coleman and Gordon Eubanks and headed by Eubanks. C&amp;E Software developed a combined file management and word processing program called Q&amp;A.

The merged company retained the name Symantec. Eubanks became its chairman, Vern Raburn, the former president of the original Symantec, remained as president of the combined company. The new Symantec combined the file management and word processing functionality that C&amp;E had planned, and added an advanced Natural Language query system (designed by Gary Hendrix and engineered by Dan Gordon) that set new standards for ease of database query and report generation. The natural language system was named &quot;The Intelligent Assistant&quot;. Turner chose the name of Q&amp;A for Symantec&#x27;s flagship product, in large part because the name lent itself to use in a short, easily merchandised logo. Brett Walter designed the user interface of Q&amp;A (Brett Walter, director of product management). Q&amp;A was released in November 1985.

In 1986, Vern Raburn and Gordon Eubanks swapped roles, and Eubanks became CEO and president of Symantec, while Raburn became its chairman. After this change, Raburn had little involvement with Symantec, and in a few years, Eubanks added chairmanship to his other roles. After a slow start for sales of Q&amp;A in the fall of 1985 and spring of 1986, Rod Turner, a Symantec Sr. Executive, signed up a new advertising agency called Elliott/Dickens, embarked on an aggressive new advertising campaign, and came up with the &quot;Six Pack Program&quot; in which all Symantec employees, regardless of role, went on the road, training and selling nationwide in the United States. Turner named it Six Pack because employees were to work six days a week, see six dealerships per day, train six sales representatives per store and stay with friends free or at Motel 6. Simultaneously, a promotion was run jointly with SofSell (which was Symantec&#x27;s exclusive wholesale distributor in the United States for the first year that Q&amp;A was on the market). This promotion was very successful in encouraging dealers to try Q&amp;A.

During this time, Symantec was advised by its board members Jim Lally and John Doerr that if it would cut its expenses and grow revenues enough to achieve cash flow break-even, then Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers would back the company in raising more venture capital. To accomplish this, the management team worked out a salary reduction schedule where the chairman and the CEO would take zero pay, all vice presidents would take a 50% pay cut, and all other employees&#x27; pay was cut by 15%. Two employees were laid off. Eubanks also negotiated a sizable rent reduction on the office space the company had leased in the days of the original Symantec. These expense reductions, combined with strong international sales of Q&amp;A, enabled the company to attain break-even.

The significantly increased traction for Q&amp;A from this re-launch grew Symantec&#x27;s revenues substantially, along with early success for Q&amp;A in international markets (uniquely a German version was shipped three weeks after the United States version, and it was the first software in the world that supported German Natural Language) following Turner&#x27;s having emphasized establishing international sales distribution and multiple language versions of Q&amp;A from the initial shipment.

In 1985, Rod Turner negotiated the publishing agreement with David Whitney for Symantec&#x27;s second product, which Turner named NoteIt (an annotation utility for Lotus 1-2-3). It was evident to Turner that NoteIt would confuse the dealer channel if it was launched under the Symantec name because Symantec had built up interest by that stage in Q&amp;A (but not yet shipped it), and because the low price for the utility would not be initially attracted to the dealer channel until demand had been built up. Turner felt that the product should be marketed under a unique brand name.

Turner and Gordon E. Eubanks Jr., then chairman of Symantec Corporation, agreed to form a new division of Symantec, and Eubanks delegated the choice of name to Turner. Turner chose the name Turner Hall Publishing, to be a new division of Symantec devoted to publishing third-party software and hardware. The objective of the division was to diversify revenues and accelerate the growth of Symantec. Turner chose the name Turner Hall Publishing, using his last name and that of Dottie Hall (Director of Marketing Communications) to convey the sense of a stable, long-established, company. Turner Hall Publishing&#x27;s first offering was Note-It, a notation utility add-in for Lotus 1-2-3, which was developed by David Whitney, and licensed to Symantec. Its second product was the Turner Hall Card, which was a 256k RAM, half slot memory card, initially made to inexpensively increase the available memory for Symantec&#x27;s flagship product, Q&amp;A. The Turner Hall division also marketed the card as a standalone product. Turner Hall&#x27;s third product, also a 1-2-3 add-in was SQZ! a Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet compression utility developed by Chris Graham Synex Systems. In the summer of 1986 Eubanks and Turner recruited Tom Byers from Digital Research, to expand the Turner Hall Publishing product family and lead the Turner Hall effort.

By the winter of 1986–87, the Turner Hall Publishing division had achieved success with NoteIt, the Turner Hall Card and SQZ!. The popularity of these products, while contributing a relatively small portion of revenues to Symantec, conveyed the impression that Symantec was already a diversified company, and indeed, many industry participants were under the impression that Symantec had acquired Turner Hall Publishing. In 1987, Byers recruited Ted Schlein into the Turner Hall Product Group to assist in building the product family and in marketing.

Revenues from Q&amp;A, and Symantec&#x27;s early launch into the international marketplace, combined with Turner Hall Publishing, generated the market presence and scale that enabled Symantec to make its first merger/acquisition, in February 1987, that of Breakthrough Software, maker of the TimeLine project management software for DOS. Because this was the first time that Symantec had acquired a business that had revenues, inventory, and customers, Eubanks chose to change nothing at BreakThrough Software for six months, and the actual merger logistics started in the summer of 1987, with Turner being appointed by Eubanks as general manager of the TimeLine business unit, Turner was made responsible for the successful integration of the company into Symantec and ongoing growth of the business, with P&amp;L. There was a heavy emphasis placed on making the minimum disruption by Eubanks and Turner.

Soon after the acquisition of TimeLine/Breakthrough Software, Eubanks reorganized Symantec, structuring the company around product-centric groups, each having its development, quality assurance, technical support, and product marketing functions, and a general manager with profit and loss responsibility. Sales, finance, and operations were centralized functions that were shared. This structure lent itself well to Symantec&#x27;s further growth through mergers and acquisitions. Eubanks made Turner general manager of the new , and simultaneously of the Q&amp;A Product Group, and made Tom Byers general manager of the Turner Hall Product Group. Turner continued to build and lead the company&#x27;s international business and marketing for the whole company.

At the TimeLine Product Group, Turner drove strong marketing, promotion and sales programs to accelerate momentum. By 1989 this merger was very successful—product group morale was high, TimeLine development continued apace, and the increased sales and marketing efforts applied built the TimeLine into the clear market lead in PC project management software on DOS. Both the Q&amp;A and TimeLine product groups were healthily profitable. The profit stream and merger success set the stage for subsequent merger and acquisition activity by the company, and indeed funded the losses of some of the product groups that were subsequently acquired. In 1989, Eubanks hired John Laing as VP worldwide sales, and Turner transferred the international division to Laing. Eubanks also recruited Bob Dykes to be executive vice president for operations and finance, in anticipation of the upcoming IPO. On June 23, 1989, Symantec had its IPO.

===1990 to 1999===
In May 1990, Symantec announced its intent to merge with and acquire Peter Norton Computing, a developer of various utilities for DOS. Turner was appointed as product group manager for the Norton business, and made responsible for the merger, with P&amp;L responsibility. Ted Schlein was made product group manager for the Q&amp;A business.

The Peter Norton group merger logistical effort began immediately while the companies sought approval for the merger, and in August 1990, Symantec concluded the purchase—by this time the combination of the companies was already complete. Symantec&#x27;s consumer antivirus and data management utilities are still marketed under the Norton name. At the time of the merger, Symantec had built upon its Turner Hall Publishing presence in the utility market, by introducing Symantec Antivirus for the Macintosh (SAM), and Symantec Utilities for the Macintosh (SUM). These two products were already market leaders on the Mac, and this success made the Norton merger more strategic. Symantec had already begun the development of a DOS-based antivirus program one year before the merger with Norton. The management team had decided to enter the antivirus market in part because it was felt that the antivirus market entailed a great deal of ongoing work to stay ahead of new viruses. The team felt that Microsoft would be unlikely to find this effort attractive, which would lengthen the viability of the market for Symantec. Turner decided to use the Norton name for obvious reasons, on what became the &quot;Norton Antivirus&quot;, which Turner and the Norton team launched in 1991. At the time of the merger, Norton revenues were approximately 20 to 25% of the combined entity. By 1993, while being led by Turner, Norton product group revenues had grown to approximately 82% of Symantec&#x27;s total.

At one time Symantec was also known for its development tools, particularly the THINK Pascal, THINK C, Symantec C++, Enterprise Developer and Visual Cafe packages that were popular on the Macintosh and IBM PC compatible platforms. These product lines resulted from acquisitions made by the company in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These businesses and the Living Videotext acquisition were consistently unprofitable for Symantec, and these losses diverted expenditures away from both the Q&amp;A for Windows and the TimeLine for Windows development efforts during the critical period from 1988 through 1992. Symantec exited this business in the late-1990s as competitors such as Metrowerks, Microsoft and Borland gained significant market share.

In 1996, Symantec Corporation was accused of misleading financial statements in violation of GAAP.

===2000 to present===

From 1999 to April 2009, Symantec was led by CEO John W. Thompson, a former VP at IBM. At the time, Thompson was the only African-American leading a major US technology company. He was succeeded in April 2009 by the company&#x27;s long-time Symantec executive Enrique Salem. Under Salem, Symantec completed the acquisition of Verisign&#x27;s Certificate Authority business, dramatically increasing their share of that market.

In 2009, Symantec released a list of the then &quot;100 dirtiest websites&quot;, which contain the most malware as detected by Norton Safe Web.
Salem was abruptly fired in 2012 for disappointing earnings performance and replaced by Steve Bennett, a former CEO of Intuit and GE executive. In January 2013, Bennett announced a major corporate reorganization, with the goal of reducing costs and improving Symantec&#x27;s product line. He said that sales and marketing &quot;had been high costs but did not provide quality outcomes&quot;. He concluded that &quot;Our system is just broken&quot;.

Robert Enderle of CIO.com reviewed the reorganization and noted that Bennett was following the General Electric model of being product-focused instead of customer-focused. He concluded &quot;Eliminating middle management removes a large number of highly paid employees. This will tactically improve Symantec&#x27;s bottom line but reduce the skills needed to ensure high-quality products in the long term.&quot;

In March 2014, Symantec fired Steve Bennett from his CEO position and named Michael Brown as interim president and chief executive. Including the interim CEO, Symantec has had 3 CEOs in less than two years. On September 25, 2014, Symantec announced the appointment of Michael A. Brown as its president and chief executive officer. Brown had served as the company&#x27;s interim president and chief executive officer since March 20, 2014. Mr. Brown has served as a member of the company&#x27;s board of directors since July 2005 following the acquisition of VERITAS Software Corporation. Mr. Brown had served on the VERITAS board of directors since 2003.

In July 2016, Symantec introduced a product to help carmakers protect connected vehicles against zero-day attacks. The Symantec Anomaly Detection for Automotive is an IoT product for manufacturers and uses machine learning to provide in-vehicle security analytics. Greg Clark assumed the position of CEO in August 2016.

In November 2016, Symantec announced its intent to acquire identity theft protection company LifeLock for $2.3 billion.

In August 2017, Symantec announced that it had agreed to sell its business unit that verifies the identity of websites to Thoma Bravo. With this acquisition, Thoma Bravo plans to merge the Symantec business unit with its own web certification company, DigiCert.

On January 4, 2018, Symantec and BT (formerly British Telecom) announced their partnership that provides new endpoint security protection.

In May 2018, Symantec initiated an internal audit to address concerns raised by a former employee, causing it to delay its annual earnings report.

In August 2018, Symantec announced that the hedge fund Starboard Value had put forward five nominees to stand for election to the Symantec board of directors at Symantec&#x27;s 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. This followed a Schedule 13D filing by Starboard showing that it had accumulated a 5.8% stake in Symantec. In September 2018, Symantec announced that three nominees of Starboard were joining the Symantec board, two with immediate effect (including Starboard Managing Member Peter Feld) and one following the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

On May 9, 2019, Symantec announced that Clark would be stepping down and that board member Rick Hill, previously put forward by Starboard, had been appointed interim president and CEO. Vincent Pilette also joined Symantec as its new CFO.

On August 8, 2019, Broadcom announced they would be acquiring the Enterprise software division of Symantec for $10.7 billion. This is after having attempted to purchase the whole company. The Norton family of products will remain in the Symantec portfolio. The sale closed on November 4, 2019, and subsequently, the company adopted the NortonLifeLock name and relocated its headquarters from Mountain View, California to LifeLock&#x27;s offices in Tempe, Arizona.

In 2021, a crypto-miner was added to the Norton 360 product, called Norton Crypto. Once activated by the user, Norton Crypto mines Ethereum (ETH) using the installed machine&#x27;s graphics card while idle. The program also creates a secure wallet on the same machine. Norton announced it was permanently disabling the feature on September 14, 2022, due to the Ethereum merge.

===Demerger===

On October 9, 2014, Symantec declared that the company would separate into two independent publicly traded companies by the end of 2015. Symantec will continue to focus on security, while a new company will be established focusing on information management. Symantec confirmed on January 28, 2015, that the information management business would be called Veritas Technologies Corporation, marking a return of the Veritas name. In August 2015, Symantec agreed to sell Veritas to a private equity group led by The Carlyle Group for $8 billion. The sale was completed by February 2016, turning Veritas into a privately owned company.

==Security concerns and controversies==

===Restatement===
On August 9, 2004, the company announced that it discovered an error in its calculation of deferred revenue, which represented an accumulated adjustment of $20 million.

===Endpoint bug===
The arrival of the year 2010 triggered a bug in Symantec Endpoint. Symantec reported that malware and intrusion protection updates with &quot;a date greater than December 31, 2009, 11:59 pm [were] considered to be &#x27;out of date.&#x27;&quot; The company created and distributed a workaround for the issue.

===Scan evasion vulnerability===
In March 2010, it was reported that Symantec AntiVirus and Symantec Client Security were prone to a vulnerability that might allow an attacker to bypass on-demand virus scanning, and permit malicious files to escape detection.

===Denial-of-service attack vulnerabilities===
In January 2011, multiple vulnerabilities in Symantec products that could be exploited by a denial-of-service attack, and thereby compromise a system, were reported. The products involved were Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition Server and Symantec System Center.

The November 12, 2012, Vulnerability Bulletin of the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) reported the following vulnerability for older versions of Symantec&#x27;s Antivirus system: &quot;The decomposer engine in Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) 11.0, Symantec Endpoint Protection Small Business Edition 12.0, Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition (SAVCE) 10.x, and Symantec Scan Engine (SSE) before 5.2.8 does not properly perform bounds checks of the contents of CAB archives, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted file.&quot;

The problem relates to older versions of the systems and a patch is available. US-CERT rated the seriousness of this vulnerability as a 9.7 on a 10-point scale. The &quot;decomposer engine&quot; is a component of the scanning system that opens containers, such as compressed files, so that the scanner can evaluate the files within.

===Scareware lawsuit===
In January 2012, James Gross filed a lawsuit against Symantec for distributing fake scareware scanners that purportedly alerted users of issues with their computers. Gross claimed that after the scan, only some of the errors and problems were corrected, and he was prompted by the scanner to purchase a Symantec app to remove the rest. Gross claimed that he bought the app, but it did not speed up his computer or remove the detected viruses. He hired a digital forensics expert to back up this claim. Symantec denied the allegations and said that it would contest the case. Symantec settled a $11 million fund (up to $9 to more than 1 million eligible customers representing the overpaid amount for the app) and the case was dismissed in court.

===Source code theft===
On January 17, 2012, Symantec disclosed that its network had been hacked. A hacker known as &quot;Yama Tough&quot; had obtained the source code for some Symantec software by hacking an Indian government server. Yama Tough released parts of the code and threatened to release more. According to Chris Paden, a Symantec spokesman, the source code that was taken was for Enterprise products that were between five and six years old.

On September 25, 2012, an affiliate of the hacker group Anonymous published source code from Norton Utilities. Symantec confirmed that it was part of the code that had been stolen earlier, and that the leak included code for 2006 versions of Norton Utilities, pcAnywhere and Norton Antivirus.

===Verisign data breach===
In February 2012, it was reported that Verisign&#x27;s network and data had been hacked repeatedly in 2010, but that the breaches had not been disclosed publicly until they were noted in an SEC filing in October 2011. Verisign did not provide information about whether the breach included its certificate authority business, which was acquired by Symantec in late 2010. Oliver Lavery, director of security and research for nCircle, asked rhetorically, &quot;Can we trust any site using Verisign SSL certificates? Without more clarity, the logical answer is no.&quot;

===pcAnywhere exploit===
On February 17, 2012, details of an exploit of pcAnywhere were posted. The exploit would allow attackers to crash pcAnywhere on computers running Windows. Symantec released a hotfix for the issue twelve days later.

===Hacking of &quot;The New York Times&quot; network===
According to Mandiant, Symantec security products used by &quot;The New York Times&quot; detected only one of 45 pieces of malware that were installed by Chinese hackers on the newspaper&#x27;s network during three months in late 2012. Symantec responded:

&quot;Advanced attacks like the ones the &quot;New York Times&quot; described in the following article, &lt;http://nyti.ms/TZtr5z&gt;, underscore how important it is for companies, countries and consumers to make sure they are using the full capability of security solutions. The advanced capabilities in our [E]ndpoint offerings, including our unique reputation-based technology and behavior-based blocking, specifically target sophisticated attacks. Turning on only the signature-based anti-virus components of [E]ndpoint solutions alone [is] not enough in a world that is changing daily from attacks and threats. We encourage customers to be very aggressive in deploying solutions that offer a combined approach to security. Anti-virus software alone is not enough&quot;.

===Intellectual Ventures suit===
In February 2015, Symantec was found guilty of two counts of patent infringement in a suit by Intellectual Ventures Inc and ordered to pay $17 million in compensation and damages, In September 2016, this decision was reversed on appeal by the Federal Circuit.

===Sustaining digital certificate security===
On September 18, 2015, Google notified Symantec that the latter issued 23 test certificates for five organizations, including Google and Opera, without the domain owners&#x27; knowledge. Symantec performed another audit and announced that an additional 164 test certificates were mis-issued for 76 domains and 2,458 test certificates were mis-issued for domains that had never been registered. Google requested that Symantec update the public incident report with proven analysis explaining the details on each of the failures.

The company was asked to report all the certificates issued to the Certificate Transparency log henceforth. Symantec has since reported implementing Certificate Transparency for all its SSL Certificates. Above all, Google has insisted that Symantec execute a security audit by a third party and to maintain tamper-proof security audit logs.

===Google and Symantec clash on website security checks===
On March 24, 2017, Google stated that it had lost confidence in Symantec, after the latest incident of improper certificate issuance. Google says millions of existing Symantec certificates will become untrusted in Google Chrome over the next 12 months. According to Google, Symantec partners issued at least 30,000 certificates of questionable validity over several years, but Symantec disputes that number. Google said Symantec failed to comply with industry standards and could not provide audits showing the necessary documentation.

Google&#x27;s Ryan Sleevi said that Symantec partnered with other CAs (CrossCert (Korea Electronic Certificate Authority), Certisign Certificatadora Digital, Certsuperior S. de R. L. de C.V., and Certisur S.A.) who did not follow proper verification procedures leading to the misissuance of certificates.

Following discussions in which Google had required that Symantec migrate Symantec-branded certificate issuance operations a non-Symantec-operated &quot;Managed Partner Infrastructure&quot;, a deal was announced whereby DigiCert acquired Symantec&#x27;s website security business. In September 2017, Google announced that starting with Chrome 66, &quot;Chrome will remove trust in Symantec-issued certificates issued prior to June 1, 2016&quot;. Google further stated that &quot;by December 1, 2017, Symantec will transition issuance and operation of publicly-trusted certificates to DigiCert infrastructure, and certificates issued from the old Symantec infrastructure after this date will not be trusted in Chrome.&quot; Google predicted that toward the end of October 2018, with the release of Chrome 70, the browser would omit all trust in Symantec&#x27;s old infrastructure and all of the certificates it had issued, affecting most certificates chaining to Symantec roots. Mozilla Firefox planned to distrust Symantec-issued certificates in Firefox 63 (released on October 23, 2018), but delivered the change in Firefox 64 (released on December 11, 2018). Apple has also planned to distrust Symantec root certificates. Subsequently, Symantec exited the TLS/SSL segment by selling the SSL unit to Digicert for $950 million in mid 2017.

=== Norton Crypto ===
On July 20, 2021, Norton LifeLock released Norton Crypto, which would&#x27;ve mined Ethereum in the background in exchange for periodic payments. This drew criticism from users, as this was installed automatically, and many users reported having diffuculty uninstalling the program.

===Columbia patent-infringement lawsuit===
In May 2022, Columbia University won $185 million judgement against NortonLifeLock Inc. in a patent-infringement lawsuit. The jury found that Norton willfully infringed the patents related to antivirus fighting malware.

<text>Cruise is the phase of aircraft flight that starts when the aircraft levels off after a climb, until it begins to descend for landing. Cruising usually comprises the majority of a flight, and may include small changes in heading (direction of flight), airspeed, and altitude.

== Airliner cruise == 
Commercial or passenger aircraft are usually designed for optimum performance around their cruise speed (VC) and cruise altitude. Factors affecting optimum cruise speed and altitude include payload, center of gravity, air temperature, and humidity. Cruise altitude is usually where the higher ground speed is balanced against the decrease in engine thrust and efficiency at higher altitudes. Common narrowbodies like the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737NG cruise at , while modern widebodies like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 cruise at . The typical cruising altitude for commercial airliners is .
The speed which covers the greatest distance for a given amount of fuel is known as the maximum range speed. This is the speed at which drag is minimised.

For jet aircraft, &quot;long-range cruise&quot; speed (LRC) is defined as the speed which gives 99% of the maximum range, for a given weight. This results in a increase in speed. It is also a more stable speed than maximum range speed, so gives less autothrottle movement. However, LRC speed does not take account of winds, or time-related costs other than fuel, so it has little practical value. Instead, the speed for most economical operation (ECON) is adjusted for wind and the cost index (CI), which is the ratio of time cost to fuel cost. A higher cost index results in a higher ECON speed. Cost index can be given in &quot;Boeing&quot; or &quot;English&quot; units as , equivalent to . A typical cost index in these units might be anywhere from 5 to 150. Alternatively cost index can be given in metric or &quot;Airbus&quot; units of .

In the presence of a tailwind, ECON airspeed can be reduced to take advantage of the tailwind, whereas in a headwind, ECON speed will be increased to avoid the penalty of the headwind. In the presence of a tailwind, LRC speed may give a higher fuel burn than ECON. As the aircraft consumes fuel, its weight decreases and the ECON speed decreases. This is because a heavier aircraft should fly faster to generate the required lift at the most efficient lift coefficient. ECON speed will also be higher at higher altitudes because the density of the air is lower.

==Propeller aircraft==

For propeller aircraft, drag is minimised when the lift-to-drag ratio is maximised. However, the speed for this is typically regarded as too slow, so propeller aircraft typically cruise at a significantly faster speed. Combustion engines have an optimum efficiency level for fuel consumption and power output. Generally, gasoline piston engines are most efficient between idle speed and 30% short of full throttle. Diesels are most efficient at around 90% of full throttle.

==Altitude==

As the aircraft consumes fuel, its weight decreases and the optimum altitude for fuel economy increases. For traffic control reasons it is usually necessary for an aircraft to stay at a cleared flight level. On long-haul flights, the pilot may ask air traffic control to climb from one flight level to a higher one, in a manoeuvre known as a step climb.

<text>Peter Norton (born November 14, 1943) is an American programmer, software publisher, author, and philanthropist. He is best known for the computer programs and books that bear his name and portrait. Norton sold his software business to Symantec Corporation (now Gen Digital) in 1990.

Norton was born in Aberdeen, Washington, and raised in Seattle. He attended Reed College and later worked on mainframes and minicomputers for companies like Boeing and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Norton founded Peter Norton Computing in 1982, pioneering IBM PC compatible utilities software. His first computer book, &quot;Inside the IBM PC: Access to Advanced Features &amp; Programming,&quot; was published in 1983. By 1988, Norton Computing had grown to $15 million in revenue with 38 employees. In 1990, Norton Computing released the Norton Backup program, and in 1990, Norton sold the company to Symantec for $70 million.

Norton later chaired Acorn Technologies and eChinaCash. He has a significant personal art collection and has been involved in various philanthropic endeavors, including the Peter Norton Family Foundation. He has also donated art to numerous museums and universities.

== Early life ==
Norton was born in Aberdeen, Washington, and raised in Seattle. He attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon, and majored in math and philosophy. He graduated in 1965. Before he became involved with microcomputers, he spent a dozen years working on mainframes and minicomputers for companies including Boeing and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. His earliest low-level system utilities were designed to allow mainframe programmers access to a block of RAM that IBM normally reserved for diagnostics.

== Career ==
=== Utility software ===
When the IBM PC made its debut in 1981, Norton was among the first to buy one. After he was laid off during an aerospace industry cutback, he took up microcomputer programming to make ends meet. One day he accidentally deleted a file. Rather than re-enter the data, as most would have, he decided to write a program to recover the information from the disk. His friends were delighted with the program and he developed a group of utility programs that he sold – one at a time – to user groups. In 1982, he founded Peter Norton Computing with $30,000 and an IBM computer. The company was a pioneer in IBM PC compatible utilities software. Its 1982 introduction of the Norton Utilities included Norton&#x27;s UNERASE tool to retrieve erased data from MS-DOS and IBM PC DOS formatted disks.

In 1984, Norton Computing reached $1 million in revenue, and version 3.0 of the Norton Utilities was released. Norton had three clerical people working for him. He was doing all of the software development, all of the book writing, all of the manual writing and running the business. He hired his fourth employee and first programmer, Brad Kingsbury, in July 1985. In late 1985, Norton hired a business manager to take care of the day-to-day operations.

In 1985, Norton Computing produced the Norton Editor, a programmer&#x27;s text editor created by Stanley Reifel, and Norton Guides, a terminate-and-stay-resident program which showed reference information for assembly language and other IBM PC internals, but could also display other reference information compiled into the appropriate file format. Norton Commander, a file managing tool for DOS, was introduced in 1986.

Norton Computing revenue rose to $5 million in 1986, $11 million in 1987, and $15 million in 1988. Its products won several utility awards, and it was ranked 136th on the 1988 &quot;Inc.&quot; magazine list of the 500 fastest-growing private companies in America, with 38 employees. Norton himself was named &quot;Entrepreneur of the Year&quot; by Arthur Young &amp; Co. (1988 High Technology Award Winner Greater Los Angeles Region) and &quot;Venture&quot; magazine.

On April 12, 1989, Norton appointed Ron Posner chief executive of Norton Computing. Norton continued as chairman. Posner&#x27;s goal was to rapidly grow the company into a major software vendor. Soon after his arrival, Posner hired a new president, a new chief financial officer, and added a vice president of sales.

In March 1990, Norton Computing released the Norton Backup program dedicated to backing up and restoring hard disks. Norton Utilities for the Macintosh was launched in July.

In 1989, Norton Computing had $25 million in sales. In August 1990, Norton sold it to Symantec for $70 million. Posner orchestrated the merger. Norton was given one-third of Symantec&#x27;s stock, worth about $60 million, and a seat on Symantec&#x27;s board of directors. The acquired company became a division of Symantec and was renamed Peter Norton Computing Group. About one-third of Norton Computing&#x27;s 115 employees were laid off after the merger. The Norton brand name lives on in such Symantec products as Norton AntiVirus, Norton 360, Norton Internet Security, Norton Personal Firewall, Norton SystemWorks (which now contains a current version of the Norton Utilities), Norton AntiBot, Norton AntiSpam, Norton GoBack (formerly Roxio GoBack), Norton PartitionMagic (formerly PowerQuest PartitionMagic), and Norton Ghost. Norton&#x27;s image was used on the packaging of all Norton-branded products until 2001.

=== Author ===
Jerry Pournelle wrote in 1985 that Norton had &quot;remarkable talents for explaining the complex with clarity&quot;. Norton marketed his early software in person, leaving behind little pamphlets with technical notes at users group meetings and computer stores. A publisher saw his pamphlets, and saw that he could write about a technical subject. The publisher called him and asked him if he wanted to write a book. Norton&#x27;s first computer book, &quot;Inside the IBM PC: Access to Advanced Features &amp; Programming (Techniques)&quot;, was published in 1983. Eight editions of this bestseller were published, the last in 1999. Norton wrote several other technical manuals and introductory computing books. He began writing monthly columns in 1983 for &quot;PC Magazine&quot; and later &quot;PC Week&quot; magazine as well, which he wrote until 1987. He soon became recognized as a principal authority on IBM personal computer technology.

In September 1983, Norton started work on &quot;The Peter Norton Programmer&#x27;s Guide to the IBM PC&quot;. The book was a popular and comprehensive guide to programming the original IBM PC platform (covering BIOS and MS-DOS system calls in great detail). The first (1985) edition was nicknamed &quot;the pink shirt book&quot;, after the pink shirt that Norton wore for the cover photo, and Norton&#x27;s crossed-arm pose on that cover is a U.S. registered trademark.

 The second (1988) edition, renamed &quot;The New Peter Norton Programmer&#x27;s Guide to the IBM PC &amp; PS/2&quot;, again featured the crossed arms, pink shirt cover image. Richard Wilton co-authored the second edition. This was followed by the third (1993) edition of &quot;the Norton book&quot;, renamed &quot;The Peter Norton PC Programmer&#x27;s Bible&quot;, co-authored with Wilton and Peter Aitken. Later editions of &quot;Peter Norton&#x27;s Inside the PC&quot;, a broad-brush introduction to personal computer technology, featured Norton in his crossed-arm pose on the cover, wearing a white shirt.

===Later career===
In 2002, Acorn Technologies lured Norton out of a 10-year business hibernation. Norton has a &quot;significant investment&quot; in the company and serves as Chairman of Acorn&#x27;s board of directors.

Norton is chairman of eChinaCash, a company he founded in 2003. Posner is CEO.

== Personal life ==
Norton spent around five years in a Buddhist monastery in the San Francisco Bay area during the 1970s. In 1983, Norton married Eileen Harris, a woman who grew up in Watts, California. They lived in the Los Angeles area where they had two children.

In the summer of 1990, they vacationed on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Massachusetts. They enjoyed it enough to return the following year and look for a house there. They purchased Corbin House, an 1891 eight-bedroom Queen Anne house in Oak Bluffs, originally built for lock and hardware industrialist Philip Corbin. They also purchased a nearby house to be close on hand to the redesign and renovation of the main house. The renovation was completed in 1994. &quot;My children are half-black, and we thought Oak Bluffs would give them an opportunity to summer around other kids like them,&quot; Norton said in a 2007 interview with Laura D. Roosevelt for &quot;Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Magazine,&quot; alluding to Oak Bluff&#x27;s century-old reputation as a popular summer spot among upper-class black people.

In 2000, the couple divorced. Norton afterward lived much of the time in New York. In February 2001, a fire caused by faulty wiring destroyed the Martha&#x27;s Vineyard home; Norton had it rebuilt to almost exactly as it was before the fire. Meanwhile, he began a relationship with New York financier Gwen Adams, originally from the Virgin Islands who lived in the area. The couple spends ten weeks of summer in the Corbin-Norton House annually. In May 2007, they married in a church in nearby Edgartown; the ceremony was performed by their neighbor, scholar and author Henry Louis Gates Jr.

== Philanthropy ==
In 1989 Peter and Eileen Norton founded the Peter Norton Family Foundation, which gave financial support to visual and contemporary non-profit arts organizations, as well as human social services organizations. The foundation was dissolved as part of the divorce, and two successor foundations were created. 

Norton serves on the boards of the California Institute of Technology, California Institute of the Arts, Crossroads School (Santa Monica, California), and the Museum of Modern Art in New York (since 1999). He is a trustee emeritus of Reed College.

In 2003, Norton became the chairman of the board of MoMA PS1 in Long Island City, New York. In 2004, he re-joined the Whitney Museum of American Art&#x27;s board after leaving it in 1998. He also serves on the executive committee of the Guggenheim Museum’s International Directors’ Council, the museum&#x27;s primary acquisition committee, and on the board of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

With his first wife, Norton accumulated one of the largest modern contemporary art collections in the United States. Many of the pieces are on loan all over the world at any given time; many were on view at Symantec Corporation. The foundation and the Norton Family Office are located in Santa Monica. &quot;ARTnews&quot; magazine regularly lists Norton among the world&#x27;s top 200 collectors.

In 1999, Norton purchased letters written to Joyce Maynard by reclusive author J. D. Salinger for $156,500. (Salinger had a year-long affair with Maynard in 1972 when she was 18.) Maynard said she was forced to auction the letters for financial reasons. Norton announced that his intention was to return the letters to Salinger.

In 1999 Norton donated $600,000 to the Signature Theatre Company (New York City) which renamed its home Off Broadway theatre at 555 West 42nd Street to &quot;Signature Theatre Company at the Peter Norton Space.&quot; It maintained that name until the theatre moved to a new venue in 2012.

In March 2015, Norton organized a second major art donation project: he donated numerous pieces from his personal art collection to museums internationally. The Rose Art Museum received 41 artworks, ranging from prints, sculptures, photography, and other mixed media.

In April 2016, Norton donated an additional 100+ pieces from his personal art collection to selected university art museums, namely, 75 pieces to the University of California, Riverside ARTSblock organization and 68 pieces to Northwestern University&#x27;s Block Museum.

<doc id="354422" wikidata="Q1762079" url="?curid=354422" title="Burmese Days">
<text>Burmese Days is the first novel by English writer George Orwell, published in 1934. Set in British Burma during the waning days of empire, when Burma was ruled from Delhi as part of British India, the novel serves as &quot;a portrait of the dark side of the British Raj.&quot; At the centre of the novel is John Flory, &quot;the lone and lacking individual trapped within a bigger system that is undermining the better side of human nature.&quot; The novel describes &quot;both indigenous corruption and imperial bigotry&quot; in a society where, &quot;after all, natives were natives—interesting, no doubt, but finally...an inferior people&quot;.

&quot;Burmese Days&quot; was first published &quot;further afield,&quot; in the United States, because of concerns that it might be potentially libelous; that the real provincial town of Katha had been described too realistically; and that some of its fictional characters were based too closely on identifiable people. A British edition, with altered names, appeared a year later. Nonetheless, Orwell&#x27;s harsh portrayal of colonial society was felt by &quot;some old Burma hands&quot; to have &quot;rather let the side down&quot;. In a letter from 1946, Orwell wrote, &quot;I dare say it&#x27;s unfair in some ways and inaccurate in some details, but much of it is simply reporting what I have seen&quot;.

==Background==

Orwell spent five years from 1922 to 1927 as a police officer in the Indian Imperial Police force in Burma (now Myanmar). The British had gradually annexed Burma in stages, and it was not until 1885, when they captured the royal capital of Mandalay, that Burma as a whole could be declared part of the British Empire. Migrant workers from India and China supplemented the native Burmese population. Although Burma was the wealthiest country in Southeast Asia under British rule, much of the wealth was in the hands of Europeans. As colony it was seen very much as a backwater. Under the British administration, the people of Burma were at the bottom of social hierarchy, with Europeans at the top, Indians, Chinese, and Christianised minorities in the middle, and Buddhist Burmese at the bottom.

The image which Britons were meant to uphold in these communities was a huge burden and the majority of them carried expectations all the way from Britain with the intention of maintaining their customs and rule. Among its exports, Burma&#x27;s up-country forests produced 75 per cent of the world&#x27;s teak. When Orwell came to the Irrawaddy Delta in January 1924 to begin his career as an imperial policeman, the delta was Burma&#x27;s leading exporting region, providing three million tons of rice annually, half the world&#x27;s supply. Orwell served in a number of locations in Burma. After a year of training in Mandalay and Maymyo, his postings included Myaungmya, Twante, Syriam, Moulmein, and Kathar. It also included Insein, situated north of Rangoon, the site of the colony&#x27;s most secure prison, and now Myanmar&#x27;s most notorious jail.

&quot;Burmese Days&quot; was several years in the writing. Orwell drafted it in Paris from 1928 to 1929. He revised it in 1932 at Southwold while doing up the family home during the summer holidays. By December 1933 he had typed the final version, and in 1934 delivered it to his agent, Leonard Moore, who submitted it to Victor Gollancz, the publisher of Orwell&#x27;s previous book. Gollancz, already fearing prosecution from having published another author&#x27;s work, turned it down because he was worried about charges of libel. Heinemann and Cape turned it down for the same reason. After demanding alterations, Harper &amp; Brothers was prepared to publish it in the United States, where it appeared in 1934. In the spring of 1935, Gollancz declared that he was prepared to publish a British edition provided Orwell could demonstrate he had not named real people. To that end, extensive checks were made in colonial lists before Gollancz brought out the English version on 24 June 1935. Nonetheless, many of the main European names appearing in the novel have since been identified in the &quot;Rangoon Gazette&quot; as belonging to real people, with the name &quot;U Po Kyin&quot; in particular belonging to a Burmese officer who was at the Police Training School in Mandalay with Orwell.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Burmese Days&quot; is set in 1920s British Burma, in the fictional district of Kyauktada, based on Katha (formerly spelled Kathar), a town where Orwell served. Like the fictional town, it is the head of a branch railway line above Mandalay on the Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy) River. As the story opens, U Po Kyin, a corrupt Burmese magistrate, is planning to destroy the reputation of the Indian, Dr Veraswami. The doctor hopes for help from his friend John Flory who, as a &quot;pukka sahib&quot; (European white man), has higher prestige. Dr Veraswami also desires election to the town&#x27;s European Club, of which Flory is a member, expecting that good standing among the Europeans will protect him from U Po Kyin&#x27;s intrigues. U Po Kyin begins a campaign to persuade the Europeans that the doctor holds anti-British opinions in the belief that anonymous letters with false stories about the doctor &quot;will work wonders&quot;. He even sends a threatening letter to Flory.

John Flory, a jaded 35-year-old teak merchant with a birthmark on his face in the shape of a ragged crescent, spends three weeks of every month acquiring jungle timber. Friendless among his fellow Europeans and unmarried, but with a Burmese mistress, he has become disillusioned with life in an expatriate community centred round the local European Club in a remote provincial town. At the same time, he has become so embedded in Burma that it is impossible for him to leave and return to England. Flory has one good friend, the Indian, Dr Veraswami, whom he often visits for what the Doctor delightedly calls &quot;cultured conversation&quot;. But when Flory dismisses the British as mere moneymakers, living a lie, &quot;the lie that we&#x27;re here to uplift our poor black brothers instead of to rob them,&quot; he provokes consternation in the doctor, who defends the British as the efficient administrators of an unrivalled empire. Toward his mistress, Flory is emotionally ambivalent: &quot;On the one hand, Flory loves Burma and craves a partner who will share his passion, which the other local Europeans find incomprehensible; on the other hand, for essentially racist reasons, Flory feels that only a European woman is acceptable as a partner&quot;.

Flory&#x27;s wish seems to be answered with the arrival of Elizabeth Lackersteen, the orphaned niece of Mr Lackersteen, manager of the local timber firm. Flory rescues her when she believes she is about to be attacked by a small water buffalo. He is immediately taken with her and they spend some time together, culminating in a highly successful shooting expedition. Flory shoots a leopard, promising the skin to Elizabeth as a trophy. Lost in romantic fantasy, Flory imagines Elizabeth to be the sensitive object of his desire, the European woman who will &quot;understand him and give him the companionship he needed&quot;. He turns Ma Hla May, his pretty, scheming Burmese mistress, out of his house. However, whereas Flory extols the virtues of the rich culture of the Burmese, the latter frighten and repel Elizabeth, who regards them as &quot;beastly.&quot; Worse still is Flory&#x27;s interest in high art and literature, which reminds Elizabeth of her pretentious mother who died in disgrace in Paris of ptomaine poisoning as a result of living in squalid conditions while masquerading as a Bohemian artist. Despite these reservations, of which Flory is entirely unaware, she is willing to marry him to escape poverty, spinsterhood, and the unwelcome advances of her perpetually inebriated uncle.

Flory is about to ask her to marry him, but they are interrupted first by her aunt and secondly by an earthquake. Mrs Lackersteen&#x27;s interruption is deliberate because she has discovered that a military police lieutenant named Verrall is arriving in Kyauktada. As he comes from an extremely good family, she sees him as a better prospect as a husband for Elizabeth. Mrs Lackersteen tells Elizabeth that Flory is keeping a Burmese mistress as a deliberate ploy to send her to Verrall. Indeed, Flory had been keeping a mistress, but had dismissed her almost the moment Elizabeth had arrived. Elizabeth is appalled and falls at the first opportunity for Verrall, who is arrogant and ill-mannered to all but her. Flory is devastated and after a period of exile attempts to make amends by delivering to her the leopard skin. A bungled curing process has left the skin mangy and stinking and the gesture merely compounds his status as a poor suitor. When Flory delivers it to Elizabeth she accepts it regardless of the fact that it stinks and he talks of their relationship, telling her he still loves her. She responds by telling him that unfortunately the feelings aren&#x27;t mutual and leaves the house to go horse riding with Verrall. When Flory and Elizabeth part ways, Mrs Lackersteen orders the servants to burn the reeking leopard skin, representing the deterioration of Flory and Elizabeth&#x27;s relationship.

U Po Kyin&#x27;s campaign against Dr Veraswami turns out to be intended simply to further his aim of becoming a member of the European Club in Kyauktada. The club has been put under pressure to elect a native member and Dr Veraswami is the most likely candidate. U Po Kyin arranges the escape of a prisoner and plans a rebellion for which he intends that Dr Veraswami should get the blame. The rebellion begins and is quickly put down, but a native rebel is killed by acting Divisional Forest Officer, Maxwell. Uncharacteristically courageous, Flory speaks up for Dr Veraswami and proposes him as a member of the club. At this moment the body of Maxwell, cut almost to pieces with &quot;dahs&quot; by two relatives of the man he had shot, is brought back to the town. This creates tension between the Burmese and the Europeans which is exacerbated by a vicious attack on native children by the spiteful and racist timber merchant, Ellis. A large but ineffectual anti-British riot begins and Flory becomes the hero for bringing it under control with some support by Dr Veraswami. U Po Kyin tries to claim credit but is disbelieved and Dr Veraswami&#x27;s prestige is restored.

Verrall leaves Kyauktada without saying goodbye to Elizabeth and she falls for Flory again. Flory is happy and plans to marry Elizabeth. However, U Po Kyin has not given up. He hires Flory&#x27;s former Burmese mistress to create a scene in front of Elizabeth during the sermon at church. Flory is disgraced and Elizabeth refuses to have anything more to do with him. Overcome by the loss and seeing no future for himself, Flory kills first his dog, and then himself.

Dr Veraswami is demoted and sent to a different district and U Po Kyin is elected to the club. U Po Kyin&#x27;s plans have succeeded and he plans to redeem his life and cleanse his sins by financing the construction of pagodas. He dies of apoplexy before he can start building the first pagoda and his wife envisages him returning to life as a frog or rat. Elizabeth eventually marries Macgregor, the senior official in town and much older. She plays her role as a deputy commissioner&#x27;s wife happily, in contempt of the natives who in turn live in fear of her; fulfilling her destiny as a standard bearer of the British Empire and &quot;burra memsahib&quot; (&quot;wife of the big man&quot;).

==Characters==
* John (in some editions, James) Flory: referred to as just &quot;Flory&quot; throughout the novel. He is the central character, a timber merchant in his mid-thirties. He has a long, dark blue birthmark that stretches from his eye to the side of his mouth on his left cheek, and he tries to avoid showing people the left side of his face as he thinks the birthmark is hideous. Whenever he is ashamed or looks down upon himself he remembers his birthmark, a symbol of his weakness. He is very friendly with the Indian Dr Veraswami, and appreciates Burmese culture. This brings him into conflict with members of the club, who dislike his slightly radical views. Because of his rather shy personality and the fact that he dislikes quarrels, he is an easy target in arguments, especially with Ellis. This discourages him from fully advocating for the Burmese. He suffers a great deal emotionally because he is infatuated with Elizabeth. All he can think about is Elizabeth but they have conflicting interests and she does not reciprocate the love. Flory supports the Burmese whereas Elizabeth regards them as beasts. Flory wants Elizabeth to appreciate him, especially with his hindering birthmark, yet he wants to support the Burmese. Due to his indecisive personality he is caught between supporting the Burmese and the English. After Elizabeth leaves Flory the second time, he commits suicide.
* Elizabeth Lackersteen: An unmarried English girl who has lost both her parents and comes to stay with her remaining relatives, the Lackersteens, in Burma. Before her flighty mother died, they had lived together in Paris. Her mother fancied herself an artist, and Elizabeth grew to hate the Bohemian lifestyle and cultural connections. Elizabeth is 22, &#x27;tallish for a girl, slender&quot;, with fashionably short hair and wears tortoise shell glasses. Throughout the novel, she seeks to marry a man because her aunt keeps pressuring her and she idolises wealth and social class, neither of which she could achieve without a husband during this time period. When she first meets Flory, he falls in love because he values white women over Burmese women. After leaving Flory for the first time, she courts Verrall, who leaves her abruptly without saying goodbye. The second time she leaves Flory (and following his suicide), she marries Deputy Commissioner MacGregor.
* Mr Lackersteen: Elizabeth&#x27;s uncle and Mrs Lackersteen&#x27;s husband. Lackersteen is the manager of a timber firm. He is a heavy drinker whose main object in life is to have a &quot;good time&quot;. However his activities are curtailed by his wife who is ever watching &quot;like a cat over a bloody mousehole&quot; because ever since she returned after leaving him alone one day to find him surrounded by three naked Burmese girls, she does not trust him alone. Lackersteen&#x27;s lechery extends to making sexual advances towards his niece, Elizabeth.
* Mrs Lackersteen: Elizabeth&#x27;s aunt and Mr Lackersteen&#x27;s wife. Mrs Lackersteen is &quot;a woman of about thirty-five, handsome in a contourless, elongated way, like a fashion plate&quot;. She is a classic memsahib, the title used for wives of officials in the Raj. Neither she nor her niece have taken to the alien country or its culture. (In &quot;Burmese Days&quot; Orwell defines the memsahib as &quot;yellow and thin, scandal mongering over cocktails—living twenty years in the country without learning a word of the language.&quot;). And because of this, she strongly believes that Elizabeth should marry an upper-class man who can provide her with a home and accompanying riches. She pesters Elizabeth into finding a husband: first she wants her to wed Verrall, then after he leaves, Flory.
* Dr Veraswami: An Indian doctor and a good friend of Flory. He has nothing but respect for the Britons living in Burma and often makes a point of vocally expressing his support for British colonial rule when he can, even though many in the European community, including Ellis, don&#x27;t respect him. Veraswami and Flory often discuss various topics, with Veraswami presenting the British point of view and Flory taking the side of the Burmese. Dr Veraswami is targeted by U Po Kyin in pursuit of membership of the European club. Dr Veraswami wants to become a member of the club so that it will give him prestige which will protect him from U Po Kyin&#x27;s attempts to exile him from the district. Because he respects Flory, he does not pester him to get him admitted into the club. Eventually U Po Kyin&#x27;s plan to exile Dr Veraswami comes through. He is sent away to work in another run-down hospital elsewhere.
* U Po Kyin: A corrupt and cunning magistrate who is hideously overweight, but perfectly groomed and wealthy. He is 56 and the &quot;U&quot; in his name is his title, which is an honorific in Burmese society. He feels he can commit whatever wicked acts he wants—cheat people of their money, jail the innocent, abuse young girls—because although, &quot;According to Buddhist belief those who have done evil in their lives will spend the next incarnation in the shape of a rat, frog, or some other low animal&quot;, he intends to provide against these sins by devoting the rest of his life to good works such as financing the building of pagodas, &quot;and balance the scales of karmic justice&quot;. He continues his plans to attack Dr Veraswami, instigating a rebellion as part of the exercise, to make Dr Veraswami look bad and eliminate him as a potential candidate of the club, so he can secure the membership for himself. He believes his status as a member of the club will cease the intrigues that are directed against him. He loses pre-eminence when Flory and Vereswami suppress the riot. After Flory dies, Kyin becomes a member of the European Club. Shortly after his admission into the club he dies, unredeemed, before the building of the pagodas. &quot;U Po has advanced himself by thievery, bribery, blackmail and betrayal, and his corrupt career is a serious criticism of both the English rule that permits his success and his English superiors who so disastrously misjudge his character&quot;.
* Ma Hla May: Flory&#x27;s Burmese mistress who has been with him for two years before he meets Elizabeth. Ma Hla May believes herself to be Flory&#x27;s unofficial wife and takes advantage of the privileges that come along with being associated with the European community in Burma. Flory has been paying her expenses throughout their time together. However, after he becomes enchanted with Elizabeth, he informs her that he no longer wants anything to do with her. Ma Hla May is distraught and repeatedly blackmails him. Once thrown out of Flory&#x27;s house, the other villagers dissociate themselves from her and she cannot find herself a husband to support her. Encouraged by U Po Kyin, who has an alternate agenda to ruin Flory&#x27;s reputation within the club, she approaches Flory in front of the Europeans and creates a dramatic scene so everyone knows of his intimacy with her. This outburst taints Elizabeth&#x27;s perception of Flory for good. Eventually she goes to work in a brothel elsewhere.
* Ko S&#x27;la: Flory&#x27;s devoted servant since the day he arrived in Burma. They are close to the same age and Ko S’la has since taken care of Flory. Though he serves Flory well, he does not approve of many of his activities, especially his relationship with Ma Hla May and his drinking habits. He believes that Flory should get married. Flory has remained in the same reckless state that he was in upon arriving in Burma. In Ko S’la&#x27;s eyes, Flory is still a boy. Ko S’la, on the other hand, has moved on with his life as he has taken wives and fathered five children. He pities Flory due to his childish behaviour and his birthmark.
* Lieutenant Verrall: A military policeman who has a temporary posting in the town. He is everything that Flory is not—young, handsome, privileged. He is the youngest son of a peer and looks down on everyone, making no concessions to civility and good manners. His only concern while in town is playing polo. He takes no notice of a person&#x27;s race, everyone is beneath him. Verrall is smug and self-centered. Encouraged by her aunt, Elizabeth pursues Verrall as a suitor, but he uses her only for temporary entertainment. In the end, he vanishes from town without a word to Elizabeth.
* Mr Macgregor: Deputy Commissioner and secretary of the club. He is upright and well-meaning, although also pompous and self-important. U Po Kyin contacts Mr Macgregor through anonymous letters as he continues his attacks on Dr Veraswami to gain a position in the club. As one of the only single men left in the town, he marries Elizabeth.
* Ellis: A spiteful and violent racist who manages a timber company in upper Burma. He is a vulgar and rude member of the club who likes to stir up scandals. Ellis firmly maintains that the Burmese people are completely incapable of ruling the country themselves. His hatred of the Burmese culture causes some clashes with Flory due to Flory&#x27;s friendliness with the Burmese, especially Dr Veraswami. Ellis is in support of U Po Kyin&#x27;s plan to ruin the reputation of Dr Veraswami and needs no evidence whatsoever of Dr Veraswami&#x27;s guilt.
* Francis and Samuel: Francis is a Eurasian clerk to an Indian money lender, whilst Samuel is a clerk to some of the pleaders. Both are sons of Christian missionaries, the book explores attitudes towards their mixed heritage.

==Style==
Orwell biographer D. J. Taylor notes that &quot;the most striking thing about the novel is the extravagance of its language: a riot of rococo imagery that gets dangerously out of hand.&quot;

Another of Orwell&#x27;s biographers, Michael Shelden, notes that Joseph Conrad, Somerset Maugham and E. M. Forster have been suggested as possible influences, but believes also that &quot;the ghost of Housman hangs heavily over the book.&quot; The writers Stansky and Abrahams, while noting that the character Flory probably had his roots in Captain Robinson, a cashiered ex-officer whom Orwell had met in Mandalay, &quot;with his opium-smoking and native women&quot;, affirmed that Flory&#x27;s &quot;deepest roots are traceable to fiction, from Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Lord Jim&quot; through all those Englishmen gone to seed in the East which are one of Maugham&#x27;s better-known specialities.&quot;

Jeffrey Meyers, in a 1975 guide to Orwell&#x27;s work, wrote of the E. M. Forster connection that, &quot;&quot;Burmese Days&quot; was strongly influenced by &quot;A Passage to India&quot;, which was published in 1924 when Orwell was serving in Burma. Both novels concern an Englishman&#x27;s friendship with an Indian doctor, and a girl who goes out to the colonies, gets engaged and then breaks it off. Both use the Club scenes to reveal a cross-section of colonial society, and both measure the personality and value of the characters by their racial attitudes...But &quot;Burmese Days&quot; is a far more pessimistic book than &quot;A Passage to India&quot;, because official failures are not redeemed by successful personal relations.&quot;

Orwell himself was to note in &quot;Why I Write&quot; (1946) that &quot;I wanted to write enormous naturalistic novels with unhappy endings, full of detailed descriptions and arresting similes, and also full of purple passages in which my words were used partly for the sake of their sound. And in fact my first complete novel, &quot;Burmese Days&quot;...is rather that kind of book.&quot;

==Themes==
===Colonialism===

Each of the characters in the novel hold differing views towards colonialism, influenced by their background and status in society. According to University of Singapore scholar Steven L. Keck, the novel&#x27;s depiction of colonialism led it to become &quot;a part of the mythology of imperial experience not only for Burma, but for the British Empire as a whole&quot;. &quot;Burmese Days&quot; takes place during a period of Burmese history when it was under British colonial rule, and Orwell intended the novel to serve as a critique of colonialism, both in the effects it had on the Burmese and the British. Colonial society in Burma is depicted as being divided on racial lines, &quot;with [the Europeans] exploiting both the land and peoples of Burma, while finding that the cost of exile and isolation was to fight a continuous battle against despair&quot;; the Burmese and Indians, on the other hand, are depicted as both supportive and opposed to colonial rule. Keck speculated that the fact that the Saya San peasant rebellion was ongoing during the period influenced Orwell&#x27;s pessimistic attitude towards colonialism.

&quot;Burmese Days&quot; frequently uses characters in the novel to illustrate larger arguments about colonial rule. When Flory, someone who had grown disillusioned with colonialism, enters into a debate with Dr Veraswami about British colonial rule, each makes several points about the effects of colonialism in Burma. Flory charges that the British are only interested in Burma due to the economic opportunities the colony provides, and are living a &quot;lie that we&#x27;re here to uplift our poor black brothers rather than to rob them&quot;. Dr Veraswami counters that British rule has improved Burma, pointing to the levels of infrastructure, healthcare and education in the colony. Veraswami also notes how if it were not a British colony, he would not have been able to become a doctor in Burma. Their argument continues, but are unable to come to an agreement and ends inconclusively.

The novel also explored the status of Burma as being part of the British Raj instead of being a separate colony. Burmese scholar Maung Htin Aung, in an article written about &quot;Burmese Days&quot;, claimed that the novel served as a &quot;valuable historical document&quot; due to the fact that it &quot;recorded vividly the tensions that prevailed in Burma, and the mutual suspicion, despair and disgust that crept into Anglo-Burmese relations as the direct result of the Government of India Act leaving out Burma from the course of its reforms&quot;.

===Isolation===

The character of Flory, a &quot;Pukka sahib&quot;, serves as an emblematic depiction of the isolation faced by the European community in colonial-era Burma, a topic Orwell also explored in his short story &quot;Shooting an Elephant&quot;. He is torn between his fascination with Burmese culture, which sees him attempt to befriend several Burmese, and his role as a colonial teak merchant (ensuring that, as a member of the ruling class, he can never become intimately familiar with such a culture). He also defends the Burmese and sympathises with various issues they face in the argument with Dr Veraswami, confirming his disillusion with colonialism which isolates him from the European community. Flory aims to satisfy both the Burmese and the Europeans while ultimately pleasing neither, further confirming his isolation.

===Racism===
The theme of racism frequently appears in &quot;Burmese Days&quot;, being depicted in the interactions between the three primary ethnic groups in Burma- the Europeans, Indians and Burmese. The European gentleman&#x27;s club in which Flory spends a significant portion of the novel in, holds a debate on whether or not to admit a &quot;native&quot; (referring to Burmese people) into the club, with the violent and spiteful racist Ellis immediately objecting and declaring that he will never share a club with &quot;natives&quot;. Racism remains a strong theme throughout the novel, with the European community in Burma frequently expressing racist attitudes towards the Indians and Burmese they interact with. In the view of Keck, the depiction of racism in &quot;Burmese Days&quot; has been cited by numerous historians &quot;as a means to explore some of the more important features of modern history&quot;.

==Reactions==
Harpers brought out &quot;Burmese Days&quot; in the US on 25 October 1934, in an edition of 2,000 copies. In February 1935, just four months after publication, 976 copies were remaindered. The only American review that Orwell himself saw, in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, by Margaret Carson Hubbard, was unfavourable: &quot;The ghastly vulgarity of the third-rate characters who endure the heat and talk ad nausea of the glorious days of the British Raj, when fifteen lashes settled any native insolence, is such that they kill all interest in their doings.&quot; A positive review however came from an anonymous writer in the &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot;, for whom the central figure was, &quot;analyzed with rare insight and unprejudiced if inexorable justice&quot;, and the book itself praised as full of &quot;realities faithfully and unflinchingly realised.&quot;

On its publication in Britain, &quot;Burmese Days&quot; earned a review in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; from Cyril Connolly as follows:

Burmese Days is an admirable novel. It is a crisp, fierce, and almost boisterous attack on the Anglo-Indian. The author loves Burma, he goes to great length to describe the vices of the Burmese and the horror of the climate, but he loves it, and nothing can palliate for him, the presence of a handful of inefficient complacent public school types who make their living there... I liked it and recommend it to anyone who enjoys a spate of efficient indignation, graphic description, excellent narrative, excitement, and irony tempered with vitriol.

Orwell received a letter from the anthropologist Geoffrey Gorer as follows

Will you allow me to tell you how very much indeed I admire your novel &quot;Burmese Days&quot;: it seems to me an absolutely admirable statement of fact told as vividly and with as little bitterness as possible.

It was as a result of these responses that Orwell renewed his friendship with Connolly, which was to give him useful literary connections, a positive evaluation in &quot;Enemies of Promise&quot; and an outlet on &quot;Horizon&quot;. He also became a close friend of Gorer.

Twelve years after its publication, Edmund Wilson mentioned the book favourably in a review of &quot;Animal Farm&quot; in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;: &quot;There is a novel of [Orwell&#x27;s] called &quot;Burmese Days,&quot; a title deceptively suggestive of reminiscences by a retired official, which is certainly one of the few first-hand and really excellent pieces of fiction that have been written about India since Kipling... This book ... attracted, so far as I remember, no attention whatever when it came out over here, but it ought certainly to be republished...&quot;

In 2013, the Burmese Ministry of Information named the new translation (by Maung Myint Kywe) of &quot;Burmese Days&quot; the winner of the 2012 Burma National Literature Award&#x27;s &quot;informative literature&quot; (translation) category. The National Literary Awards are the highest literary awards in Burma.

<doc id="354424" wikidata="Q7561744" url="?curid=354424" title="Sonia Orwell">
<text>Sonia Mary Brownell (25 August 1918 – 11 December 1980), better known as Sonia Orwell, was the second wife of writer George Orwell. Sonia is believed to be the model for Julia, the heroine of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

Sonia worked with the Information Research Department (IRD), a propaganda department of the British Foreign Office, which helped to increase the international fame of &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. With her support, the IRD was able to translate &quot;Animal Farm&quot; into over 16 languages, and for British embassies to disseminate the book in over 14 countries for propaganda purposes. Soon after her husband&#x27;s death, Sonia sold the film rights to &quot;Animal Farm&quot; to a pair of movie executives, unaware they were agents of the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). This deal resulted in the creation of the propaganda film &quot;Animal Farm&quot; (1954), which became the first feature-length animated film made in Britain.

==Early life==
Brownell was born in Calcutta, British India, the daughter of a British colonial official. Her father died when she was four years old. When she was six, she was sent to the Sacred Heart Convent in Roehampton (now part of Roehampton University), in England. She left at 17 and, after learning French in Switzerland, took a secretarial course. As a young woman, Brownell was responsible for transcribing and editing the copy text for the first edition of the Winchester &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, as assistant to the eminent medievalist at Manchester University, Eugène Vinaver.

==Orwell==
Brownell first met Orwell when she worked as the assistant to Cyril Connolly, a friend of his from Eton College, at the literary magazine &quot;Horizon&quot;. After the death of his first wife Eileen O&#x27;Shaughnessy, Orwell became desperately lonely. On 13 October 1949, he married Brownell, only three months before his death from tuberculosis.

George Orwell&#x27;s friends, as well as various Orwell experts, have noted that Brownell helped Orwell through the painful last months of his life and, according to Anthony Powell, cheered Orwell up greatly. However, others have argued that she may have also been attracted to him primarily because of his fame. Orwell biographer Bernard Crick told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; he did not think that Brownell &quot;had much influence on his life&quot; and asserted that &quot;it was more or less an accident that they married.&quot;

==&quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;==
T. R. Fyvel, who was a colleague and friend of George Orwell during the last decade of the writer&#x27;s life, and other friends of Orwell, have said that Sonia was the model for Julia, the heroine of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, the &quot;girl from the fiction department&quot; who brings love and warmth to the middle-aged hero, Winston Smith.

As Orwell wrote in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, &quot;the girl from the fiction department... was looking at him... She was very young, he thought, she still expected something from life... She would not accept it as a law of nature that the individual is always defeated... All you needed was luck and cunning and boldness. She did not understand that there was no such thing as happiness, that the only victory lay in the far future, long after you were dead.&quot;

==Archivist==
Together with David Astor and Richard Rees, George Orwell&#x27;s literary executor, Brownell established the George Orwell Archive at University College London, which opened in 1960.

Brownell was fiercely protective of Orwell&#x27;s estate and edited, with Ian Angus, &quot;The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell&quot; (4 volumes, Secker &amp; Warburg, London, 1968).

==After Orwell==
Brownell married Michael Pitt-Rivers in 1958, and had affairs with several British painters, including Lucian Freud, William Coldstream and Victor Pasmore. Her marriage to Pitt-Rivers ended in divorce in 1965. She also had an affair with the French phenomenological philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty, whom she described as her true love; she hoped he would leave his wife for her.

Brownell had several godchildren and was very close to some of them. Her godson Tom Gross has written in &quot;The Spectator&quot; magazine that &quot;although Sonia had no children of her own, she became almost like a second mother to me.&quot;

Sonia was also close friends with many writers and artists, including Pablo Picasso, who drew a sketch in her honour, which he marked &quot;Sonia.&quot;

==Death==
Brownell died penniless in London of a brain tumour in December 1980, having spent a fortune trying to protect Orwell&#x27;s name and having been swindled out of her remaining funds by an unscrupulous accountant.

Her friend, the painter Francis Bacon, paid off her outstanding debts. At her funeral, Tom Gross read the same passage from Ecclesiastes, chapter 12 verses 1-7 about the breaking of the golden bowl, that she had asked Anthony Powell to read at Orwell&#x27;s funeral thirty years earlier.

<doc id="354425" wikidata="Q753123" url="?curid=354425" title="La sonnambula">
<text>La sonnambula (; &quot;The Sleepwalker&quot;) is an opera semiseria in two acts, with music in the &quot;bel canto&quot; tradition by Vincenzo Bellini set to an Italian libretto by Felice Romani, based on a scenario for a &quot;ballet-pantomime&quot; written by Eugène Scribe and choreographed by Jean-Pierre Aumer called &quot;La somnambule, ou L&#x27;arrivée d&#x27;un nouveau seigneur&quot;. The ballet had premiered in Paris in September 1827 at the height of a fashion for stage works incorporating somnambulism.

The role of Amina was originally written for the soprano sfogato Giuditta Pasta and the tenor Giovanni Battista Rubini, but during Bellini&#x27;s lifetime another soprano sfogato, Maria Malibran, was a notable exponent of the role. The first performance took place at the Teatro Carcano in Milan on 6 March 1831.

The majority of twentieth-century recordings have been made with a soprano cast as Amina, usually with added top-notes and other changes according to tradition, although it was released in soprano sfogato voice (not be confused with the modern mezzo, nonexistent at the time) who sang soprano and contralto roles unmodified.

The phrase (&quot;I did not believe I would see you fade so soon, oh flower&quot;) from Amina&#x27;s final aria is inscribed on Bellini&#x27;s tomb in the Catania Cathedral in Sicily.

== Composition history ==

Returning to Milan after the &quot;I Capuleti e i Montecchi&quot; performances in March 1830, little occurred until the latter part of April when Bellini was able to negotiate a contracts with both the Milan house for the autumn of 1831 and another for the 1832 Carnival season at La Fenice in Venice; these operas were to become &quot;Norma&quot; for La Scala and &quot;Beatrice di Tenda&quot; for Venice. Writing to his uncle in Sicily, the composer reported that &quot;I shall earn almost twice as much as if I had composed [only for the Venetian impresario]&quot;.

However, there was also a contract for a second Milan house for the following winter season for as-yet an unnamed opera, but it had already been agreed that Giuditta Pasta, who had achieved success in Milan in 1829 and 1830 appearing in several major operas, would be the principal artist.

Then Bellini experienced the re-occurrence of an illness which had emerged in Venice due to pressure of work and the bad weather, and which consistently recurred after each opera. The gastro-enteric condition—which he described as &quot;a tremendous inflammatory gastric bilious fever&quot;— resulted in his being cared for by friends. It was not until the summer, when he went to stay near Lake Como, that the pressure to decide upon a subject for the following winter&#x27;s opera became more urgent. That Pasta owned a house near Como and would be staying there over the summer was the reason that Felice Romani traveled to meet both her and Bellini.

By 15 July they had decided on a subject for early 1831, but it was uncertain as to whether Pasta was interested in singing a trousers role, that of the protagonist, Ernani, in an adaptation of Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Hernani&quot;, later set to music by Giuseppe Verdi in 1844. With both men having various other commitments, by the end of November 1830 nothing had been achieved in the way of writing either the libretto or the score of &quot;Ernani&quot; but, by January, the situation and the subject had changed. Bellini wrote that &quot;[Romani] is now writing ...It must go on stage on 20 February at the latest.&quot;

That music which he was beginning to use for &quot;Ernani&quot; was transferred to &quot;Sonnambula&quot; is not in doubt, and, as Weinstock comments, &quot;he was as ready as most other composers of his era to reuse in a new situation musical passages created for a different, earlier one&quot;.

During Bellini&#x27;s lifetime another , Maria Malibran, was to become a notable exponent of the role of Amina.

== Performance history ==

=== 19th century ===

With its pastoral setting and story, &quot;La sonnambula&quot; was an immediate success and is still regularly performed. The title role of Amina (the sleepwalker) with its high tessitura is renowned for its difficulty, requiring a complete command of trills and florid technique, but it fitted Pasta&#x27;s vocal capabilities, her soprano also having been described as a &quot;soprano sfogato&quot;, one which designates a contralto who is capable—by sheer industry or natural talent—of extending her upper range and being able to encompass the coloratura soprano tessitura.

The opera&#x27;s premiere performance took place on 6 March 1831, a little later than the original date. Its success was partly due to the differences between Romani&#x27;s earlier libretti and this one, as well as &quot;the accumulation of operatic experience which both [Bellini] and Romani had brought to its creation.&quot; Press reactions were universally positive, as was that of the Russian composer, Mikhail Glinka, who attended and wrote overwhelmingly enthusiastically:
:Pasta and Rubini sang with the most evident enthusiasm to support their favourite conductor [&quot;sic&quot;]; the second act the singers themselves wept and carried the audience along with them.

After its premiere, the opera was performed in London on 28 July 1831 at the King’s Theatre and in New York on 13 November 1835 at the Park Theatre. Herbert Weinstock provides a comprehensive year-by-year listing of performances following the premiere and then, with some gaps, all the way up to 1900.

Later, it was a vehicle for showcasing Jenny Lind, Emma Albani and—in the early 20th century—for Lina Pagliughi and Toti Dal Monte.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===

Weinstock gave an account of performances starting in 1905. Stagings were presented as frequently as every two years in one European or North American venue or another, and they continued through the 1950s &quot;bel canto&quot; revivals up to the publication of his book in 1971. The opera was rescued from the ornamental excesses and misrepresentations more similar to the baroque style than the &quot;bel canto&quot; of Bellini when it was sung by Maria Callas in the now-famous 1955 production by Luchino Visconti at La Scala.

Contributing to the revivals were Joan Sutherland&#x27;s taking the role of Amina at Covent Garden in 1961 and at the Metropolitan Opera in 1963, where the role become one of her most significant successes.

While not part of the standard repertory, &quot;La sonnambula&quot; is performed reasonably frequently in the 21st century. It has been given three productions with Natalie Dessay, the first at the Santa Fe Opera in 2004, the second in Paris in January/February 2010, and the third at the Metropolitan Opera in 2009, a production which was revived in Spring 2014 with Diana Damrau singing the role of Amina. A production was mounted by The Royal Opera in London in 2011, by the Salzburger Landestheater in Salzburg 2015, and by the Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz in Munich in 2015/2016. The first mezzo-soprano to record the role was Frederica von Stade in 1980, followed by Cecilia Bartoli.

:Place: Switzerland
:Time: Indeterminate

=== Act 1 ===
&quot;Scene 1: A village, a mill in the background&quot;

As the betrothal procession of Amina and Elvino approaches, the villagers all proclaiming joy for Amina, Lisa, the proprietress of the inn, comes outside expressing her misery: / &quot;All is joy and merriment... I alone am miserable&quot;. She is consumed with jealousy for she had once been betrothed to Elvino and had been abandoned by him in favour of Amina. The lovelorn Alessio arrives, but she rejects his advances. All assembled proclaim the beauty of Amina: / &quot;In Switzerland there is no flower sweeter, dearer than Amina&quot;. Then Amina comes out of the mill with her adoptive mother, Teresa, the mill owner. Amina thanks her, also expressing her thanks to her assembled friends for their kind wishes. (Aria: / &quot;How brightly this day dawned for me&quot;.) Additionally, she thanks Alessio, who tells her that he has composed the wedding song and organised the celebrations; she wishes him well in his courtship of Lisa, but Lisa cynically rejects the idea of love. Elvino arrives, exclaiming / &quot;Forgive me my beloved&quot;, and explaining that he had to stop on his way at his mother&#x27;s grave to ask her blessing on Amina. As they exchange vows, the notary asks what she brings to the partnership: &quot;Only my heart&quot; she answers at which Elvino&#x27;s exclaims: &quot;Ah the heart is everything!&quot;. (Elvino&#x27;s aria, then Amina, then all express their love and their joy: / &quot;Here, receive this ring that the beloved spirit who smiled upon our love wore at the altar&quot;.)

The sound of horses&#x27; hooves and a cracking whip is heard. A stranger arrives, asking the way to the castle. Lisa points out that it is getting late and he will not reach it before dark and she offers him lodging at her inn. When he says that he knows the inn, all are surprised. (Rodolfo&#x27;s aria: / &quot;O lovely scenes, again I see you, / where in serenity I spent the calm and happy days of my earliest youth&quot;.) The newcomer, who surprises the villagers by his familiarity with the locality, asks about the celebrations and admires Amina, who reminds him of a girl he had loved long ago. ( / &quot;You can&#x27;t know how those dear eyes gently touch my heart, what adorable beauty&quot;.) He admits to having once stayed in the castle, whose lord has been dead for four years. When Teresa explains that his son had vanished some years previously, the stranger assures them that he is alive and will return. As darkness approaches the villagers warn him that it is time to be indoors to avoid the village phantom: / &quot;When the sky is dark at night, and the moon&#x27;s rays are weak, at the gloomy thunder&#x27;s sound [...] a shade appears.&quot; Not being superstitious, he assures them that they will soon be free of the apparition. Elvino is jealous of the stranger&#x27;s admiration of Amina; he is jealous even of the breezes that caress her, but he promises her he will reform. (Duet finale, Elvino and Amina: / &quot;I envy the wandering breeze that plays with your hair, your veil&quot;).

&quot;Scene 2: A room in the inn&quot;

Lisa enters Rodolfo&#x27;s room to see if all is well. She reveals that his identity is known to all as Rodolfo, the long-lost son of the count. She advises him that the village is preparing a formal welcome; meanwhile she wishes to be the first to pay her respects. She is flattered when he begins a flirtation with her, but runs out at the sound of people approaching, dropping her handkerchief which the Count picks up. He sees the approaching phantom whom he recognises as Amina. She enters the room, walking in her sleep, all the while calling for Elvino and asking where he is. Realising that her nocturnal wanderings have given rise to the story of the village phantom, Rodolfo is about to take advantage of her helpless state. But then he is struck by her obvious innocence and refrains: (Scene: first Rodolfo: / &quot;God! What am I doing?&quot;; then, separately, Amina: / &quot;How happy all the people are, accompanying us to the church&quot;; then together.) Amina continues her sleepwalk and falls asleep on the sofa, but Rodolfo hears the sound of people approaching and, with no other way out, he climbs out of the window.

Amina continues to sleep on the sofa as the villagers arrive at the inn. Lisa enters and points to Amina, who wakes up at the noise. Elvino, believing her faithless, rejects Amina in fury. Only Teresa, her adoptive mother, believes in her innocence: Ensemble finale, first Amina / &quot;In my thought or in my words never, never have I sinned&quot;; then Elvino: / &quot;Heaven keep you from feeling ever the pain that I feel now!&quot;; then the people and Teresa, the former proclaiming her treachery, Teresa pleading for her to be allowed to explain. Elvino then exclaims that there will be no wedding, and each expresses his or her emotional reaction to this discovery.

=== Act 2 ===
&quot;Scene 1: A wood&quot;
On their way to ask the count to attest to Amina&#x27;s innocence, the villagers rest in the woods and consider how they will express their support to him: (Chorus: / &quot;Here the wood is thick and dark&quot;). Amina and Teresa arrive and are on a similar mission, but Amina is despondent, although Teresa encourages her daughter to continue. They then see Elvino coming in the wood looking downcast and sad. He continues to reject Amina, even when the townspeople come in with the news that the count says that she is innocent. Elvino is not convinced and takes back the ring, though he is unable to tear her image from his heart: (Aria, then chorus: / &quot;Why cannot I despise you, faithless, as I should?&quot;)

&quot;Scene 2: The village, as in act 1&quot;

Lisa, Alessio, Elvino and the villagers are in the square. Elvino declares that he will renew his vows and proceed to marry Lisa. She is delighted. As they are about to go to the church, Rodolfo enters and tries to explain that Amina is innocent because she did not come to his room awake – she is a somnambulist, a sleepwalker: (Duet, first Elvino / &quot;I cannot deny, my lord, what my eyes have seen&quot;; then Rodolfo / &quot;Certain people when they sleep go about as if awake&quot;.) Elvino refuses to believe him and calls upon Lisa to leave, but at that moment Teresa begs the villagers to be quiet, because Amina has at last fallen into an exhausted sleep.

Learning of the impending marriage, Teresa confronts Lisa, who says that she has never been found alone in a man&#x27;s room. Teresa produces the handkerchief Lisa had accidentally dropped in the Count&#x27;s room. The Count is unwilling to say what he thinks of this, but continues to insist on Amina&#x27;s virtue. Elvino demands proof and Rodolfo, seeing the sleeping Amina walking across the high, dangerously unstable mill bridge, warns that to wake her would be fatal. All watch as she relives her betrothal and her grief at Elvino&#x27;s rejection, taking the withered flowers in her hand. (Aria: Amina / &quot;I had not thought I would see you, dear flowers, perished so soon&quot;.) Then as she reaches the other side safely, the distraught Elvino calls to her and she is taken into his arms. Rodolfo hands him the ring which he places on her finger, at which time she awakens and is amazed by what has happened. All rejoice. In an aria finale, Amina expresses her joy: / &quot;Human thought cannot conceive of the happiness that fills me&quot;.

<text>L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore (; The Elixir of Love) is a (comic melodrama, opera buffa) in two acts by the Italian composer Gaetano Donizetti. Felice Romani wrote the Italian libretto, after Eugène Scribe&#x27;s libretto for Daniel Auber&#x27;s (1831). The opera premiered on 12 May 1832 at the Teatro della Canobbiana in Milan.

== Background ==

Written in haste in a six-week period, &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; was the most often performed opera in Italy between 1838 and 1848 and has remained continually in the international opera repertory. Today it is one of the most frequently performed of all Donizetti&#x27;s operas: it appears as number 13 on the Operabase list of the most-performed operas worldwide in the five seasons between 2008 and 2013. There are a large number of recordings. It contains the popular tenor aria &quot;Una furtiva lagrima&quot;, a &quot;romanza&quot; that has a considerable performance history in the concert hall.

Donizetti insisted on a number of changes from the original libretto by Scribe. The best known of these was the insertion of &quot;Una furtiva lagrima&quot; and the duet between Adina and Nemorino in the first act, &quot;Chiedi all&#x27;aura lusinghiera&quot;. The melody to the duet &quot;Io son ricco e tu sei bella&quot; in act 2, scene 1 recurs in the final scene of the opera sung by Dulcamara as a solo aria with new scabrous lyrics.

The central narrative theme, the triumph of sincerity, is essential to the Romantic outlook; musically, in Donizetti&#x27;s hands, the treatment became more romantic than in the Auber version: &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; features three big duets between the tenor and soprano. There is also personal history in this opera. Donizetti&#x27;s military service was bought by a rich woman, so that, unlike his brother Giuseppe (also a well known composer), he did not have to serve in the Austrian army.

== Performance history ==
The premiere of &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; took place at the Teatro della Canobbiana, Milan, on 12 May 1832. Today, the opera is part of the standard repertory. Enrico Caruso played in the role of Nemorino for the first time in February 1901 at La Scala with the conductor Arturo Toscanini. The audience reception caused Caruso and the orchestra to repeat &quot;Una furtiva lagrima&quot; three times. Toscanini stated after the performance that: &quot;Per Dio! Se questo Napoletano continua a cantare così, farà parlare di sè il mondo intero&quot; (Heavens! If this Neapolitan continues to sing like this, he will be talked about all over the world).

== Synopsis ==

:Place: A small village in the Basque Country, Spain
:Time: The end of the 18th century

=== Act 1 ===
Nemorino, a poor peasant, is in love with Adina, a beautiful landowner, who torments him with her indifference. When Nemorino hears Adina reading to her workers the story of Tristan and Isolde, he is convinced that a magic potion will help him to gain Adina&#x27;s love. The self-important Sergeant Belcore appears with his regiment and immediately sets about courting Adina in front of everyone. Nemorino becomes anxious (although Adina meanwhile secretly derides Belcore&#x27;s complacency) and, alone with Adina, reveals his love for her. Adina rebuffs him, saying that she wants a different lover every day and that Nemorino would do well to follow her example. Nemorino declares that his feelings will never change. The traveling quack doctor, Dulcamara (the self-proclaimed Dr. Encyclopedia), arrives, selling his bottled cure-all to the townspeople. Nemorino innocently asks Dulcamara if he has any of Isolde&#x27;s love potion. Despite failing to recognize the name &quot;Isolde&quot;, Dulcamara&#x27;s commercial talents nevertheless enable him to sell a bottle of the &quot;elixir&quot; – in reality only cheap red wine – to Nemorino, who pays for it with all the cash at his disposal.
To make a safe escape, Dulcamara tells Nemorino the potion needs 24 hours to take effect – by which time, the doctor will be long gone. Nemorino drinks the potion in haste in order to watch the effect the following day. Emboldened by the &quot;elixir&quot; (in fact, drunk), Nemorino feigns indifference when he encounters Adina, as he expects that the elixir will facilitate his conquest of Adina the next day. She becomes increasingly annoyed; perhaps she has feelings for Nemorino after all? Belcore returns and proposes marriage to Adina. Still riled by Nemorino and wishing to give him a lesson, Adina falsely promises to marry Belcore in six days&#x27; time. Yet, Nemorino only laughs in response: such confidence is sustained in the belief in the magic potion. However, when Belcore learns that his regiment must leave the next morning, Adina promises to marry him before his departure. This panics Nemorino, who cries out for Dr. Dulcamara to come to his aid. Adina, meanwhile, invites everyone to the wedding.

=== Act 2 ===
Adina and Belcore&#x27;s wedding party is in full swing. Dr. Dulcamara encourages Adina to sing a duet with him to entertain the guests. The notary arrives to make the marriage official. Adina is annoyed to see that Nemorino has not appeared, for the whole deal has been intended only to punish him. While everyone goes to witness the signing of the wedding contract, Dulcamara stays behind, helping himself to food and drink. Having seen the notary, Nemorino appears, depressed, as he believes that he has lost Adina. He sees Dulcamara and frantically begs him for a more powerful, faster-acting elixir. Although Dulcamara is proud to boast of his philanthropy, upon discovering that Nemorino now has no money he changes his tune and marches off, refusing to supply him anything. Belcore emerges, musing about why Adina has suddenly put off the wedding and signing of the contract. He spots Nemorino and asks his rival why he is depressed. When Nemorino says he needs cash, Belcore suggests joining the army, as he&#x27;ll receive funds on the spot. Belcore tries to excite Nemorino with tales of military life, while Nemorino only thinks of getting the potion and thus winning Adina, if only for a day before departure. Belcore produces a contract, which Nemorino signs in return for the money. Nemorino privately vows to rush and buy more potion, while Belcore muses about how sending Nemorino off to war has so easily dispatched his rival.

After the two men have left, Giannetta gossips with the women of the village. Swearing them all to secrecy, she reveals that Nemorino&#x27;s uncle has just died and left his nephew a large fortune. However, neither Nemorino nor Adina is yet aware of this. Nemorino enters, having spent his military signing bonus on – and consumed – a large amount of the fake elixir from Dr. Dulcamara. Hoping to share his fortune, the women approach Nemorino with overly friendly greetings. So out of character is this that Nemorino takes it as proof of the elixir&#x27;s efficacy. Adina sees Nemorino with the women, is rattled by his newfound popularity, and asks Dr. Dulcamara for an explanation. Unaware that Adina is the object of Nemorino&#x27;s affection, Dulcamara explains that Nemorino spent his last penny on the elixir and joined the army for money to get more, so desperate was he to win the love of some unnamed cruel beauty. Adina immediately recognises Nemorino&#x27;s sincerity, regrets her behaviour and realises that she has loved Nemorino all along. Although Dulcamara seizes the opportunity to try to sell her some of his potion to win back Nemorino, Adina declares that she has full confidence in her own powers of attraction.

Nemorino appears alone, pensive, reflecting on a tear he saw in Adina&#x27;s eye when he was ignoring her earlier. Solely based on that, he convinces himself that Adina loves him. She enters and asks why he has chosen to join the army and leave the village. When Nemorino explains that he was seeking a better life, Adina responds that he is loved and that she has purchased back his military contract from Sergeant Belcore. She offers the cancelled contract to Nemorino and reassures him that, if he stays, he will be happy. As he takes the contract, Adina turns to leave. Nemorino believes she is abandoning him and flies into a desperate fit, vowing that if he is not loved he might as well go off and die a soldier. Deeply moved by his fidelity, Adina finally declares that she will love Nemorino forever. Nemorino is ecstatic. Adina begs him to forgive her, which he does with a kiss. Belcore returns to see Nemorino and Adina in an embrace. When Adina explains that she loves Nemorino, the Sergeant takes the news in stride, noting that there are plenty of other women in the world. Adina and Nemorino learn about the inheritance from his uncle. Dulcamara returns and boasts of the success of his elixir: Nemorino is now not only loved but also rich. Dulcamara exults in the boost this will bring to the sales of his product. As Dulcamara prepares to leave, everyone queues up to buy the elixir and to hail Dulcamara as a great physician.

<doc id="354428" wikidata="Q153093" url="?curid=354428" title="Reformation Day">
<text>Reformation Day is a Protestant Christian religious holiday celebrated on 31 October in remembrance of the onset of the Reformation.

According to Philip Melanchthon, 31 October 1517 was the day Martin Luther nailed his &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot; on the door of the All Saints&#x27; Church in Wittenberg, Electorate of Saxony, in the Holy Roman Empire. Historians and other experts on the subject argue that Luther may have chosen All Hallows&#x27; Eve on purpose to get the attention of common people, although that has never been proven. Available data suggest that 31 October was the day when Luther sent his work to Albert of Brandenburg, the Archbishop of Mainz. This has been verified; it is now regarded as the start of the Reformation alongside the unconfirmed (Melanchthon appears to be the only source for that) nailing of the &quot;Ninety-five Theses/grievances&quot; to All Saints&#x27; Church&#x27;s door on the same date.

The holiday is significant for the Lutheran and Reformed Churches, although other Protestant communities also tend to commemorate the day. The Roman Catholic Church recognized it only recently, and often sends its official representatives in ecumenical spirit to various commemoration events held by Protestants. It is lawfully and officially recognized in some states of Germany and sovereign countries of Slovenia and Chile. In addition, countries like Switzerland and Austria provide specifics in laws pertaining to Protestant churches, while not officially proclaiming it a nationwide holiday.

==History==

In 1516–1517, Johann Tetzel, a Dominican friar and papal commissioner for indulgences, was sent to Germany to raise money to rebuild St Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome.

On 31 October 1517, Martin Luther wrote to Albrecht, Archbishop of Mainz and Magdeburg, protesting against the sale of indulgences. He enclosed in his letter a copy of his &quot;Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences&quot;, which came to be known as the &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot;. Hans Hillerbrand writes that Luther had no intention of confronting the church, but saw his disputation as a scholarly objection to church practices, and the tone of the writing is accordingly &quot;searching, rather than doctrinaire&quot;. Hillerbrand writes that there is nevertheless an undercurrent of challenge in several of the theses, particularly in Thesis 86, which asks: &quot;Why does the pope, whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest Crassus, build the basilica of St. Peter with the money of poor believers rather than with his own money?&quot;

Luther objected to a saying attributed to Johann Tetzel that &quot;As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory [also attested as &#x27;into heaven&#x27;] springs.&quot; He insisted that, since forgiveness was God&#x27;s alone to grant, those who claimed that indulgences absolved buyers from all punishments and granted them salvation were in error. Christians, he said, must not slacken in following Christ on account of such false assurances.

According to Philipp Melanchthon, writing in 1546, Luther &quot;wrote theses on indulgences and posted them on the church of All Saints on 31 October 1517&quot;, an event now seen as sparking the Reformation. Some scholars have questioned Melanchthon&#x27;s account, since he did not move to Wittenberg until a year later and no contemporaneous evidence exists for Luther&#x27;s posting of the theses. Others counter that such evidence is unnecessary because it was the custom at Wittenberg university to advertise a disputation by posting theses on the door of All Saints&#x27; Church, also known as &quot;Castle Church&quot;.

The &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot; were quickly translated from Latin into German, printed, and widely copied, making the controversy one of the first in history to be aided by the printing press. Within two weeks, copies of the theses had spread throughout Germany; within two months throughout Europe.

Luther&#x27;s writings circulated widely, reaching France, England, and Italy as early as 1519. Students thronged to Wittenberg to hear Luther speak. He published a short commentary on Galatians and his &quot;Work on the Psalms&quot;. This early part of Luther&#x27;s career was one of his most creative and productive. Three of his best-known works were published in 1520: &quot;To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation&quot;, &quot;On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church&quot;, and &quot;On the Freedom of a Christian&quot;.

The parish order for the New Church in Regensburg states that the Reformation of the city is to be observed the first Sunday after 15 October, every year. This document may be from 1567, however the dating is uncertain. The 1569 church order in Pomerania states that the Reformation was to be observed on St. Martin&#x27;s Day, which falls on 11 November. The hundredth anniversary of the Reformation, celebrated throughout the Protestant areas of Germany, was observed from 31 October to 1 November 1617, but a standard annual observance began much later, sometime after the two hundredth anniversary commemoration in 1717. The first annual observance was instituted by John George II, Elector of Saxony in his domains in 1667.

== Significance ==
It is celebrated among various Protestants, especially by Lutheran and Reformed Churches. Due to ecumenical movements, some other Christian groups now tend to acknowledge or co-participate in church services celebrating Reformation Day. That includes the Roman Catholic Church, as well as various Protestant denominations that are neither Lutheran or Reformed, i.e. those that lack a direct connection to religious events of the 16th century Europe.

In the United States, churches often transfer the holiday, so that it falls on the Sunday (called Reformation Sunday) on or before 31 October, with All Saints&#x27; Day moved to the Sunday on or after 1 November.

== Roman Catholic attitudes ==
On 31 October 1999, the Lutheran World Federation and the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity signed the &quot;Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification&quot;, regarding a resolution on some points of doctrinal disagreement between mainline Lutheran Churches and the Catholic Church (See also Criticism of Protestantism). The World Methodist Council formally recognized the &quot;Declaration&quot; in 2006.

In 2013, the Joint International Commission between representatives of the Lutheran World Federation and the Catholic Church published a report entitled &quot;From Conflict to Communion&quot;, anticipating the forthcoming &quot;Lutheran-Catholic Common Commemoration of the Reformation in 2017&quot;, which noted that &quot;in 2017, Lutheran and Catholic Christians will commemorate together the 500th anniversary of the beginning of the Reformation&quot;. The &quot;common commemoration&quot; was a year-long remembrance concluded on Reformation Day 2017.

== Anniversaries ==

In Germany, with wars related to the Reformation reaching into 1648, and continued Catholic–Protestant animosity all over Europe well into the early 20th century, most of the following Reformation anniversaries were tainted by a degree of anti-Catholicism and nationalism. In 1617, the celebration of faith concentrated on Lutheran orthodoxy, while in 1717, the event was more focused on the liberation from the papal rule. Luther was celebrated as God&#x27;s elected tool against the slavery of the new Roman Babylon. In 1817, the victory over Napoleon influenced the celebrations and led to the anniversary&#x27;s national orientation: Luther became the German hero and the ideal role model for the bourgeoisie; he was depicted time and again in festive parades and popular prints. The &quot;German Luther&quot; also drew wide attention in 1917 during the First World War when nationalist themes were still recurring; at the same time, serious research of Luther&#x27;s theology gained increasing importance.

When the Lutheran areas of West Germany celebrated the Reformation anniversary in 1967, 450 years after the posting of the theses, the event took place during an &quot;ice age&quot; in the relationship between the state and the Church in East Germany. This became clear through the attempt to secularise the Reformation with the concept of the &quot;early bourgeois revolution&quot; and through the pointed marginalisation of events organised by the Church, for example by means of holding celebrations of the October Revolution at exactly the same time. In the Federal Republic of Germany, there were only local celebrations organised by the churches of the respective states. A central church event in Wittenberg on 31 October 1967 was held in order to keep up at least a pretence of an all-German Evangelical Church.

===50th anniversary===
According to some sources, Reformation Day has been commemorated since 1567. Exact dates for the holiday varied until after the two hundredth celebration in 1717 when 31 October became the official date of celebration in Germany and later expanded internationally.

=== Centenary ===

In 1617, the celebration of faith concentrated on Lutheran orthodoxy. In early 1617, the Lutheran duke and elector John George I of Saxony received a politically delicate dispatch. The University of Wittenberg asked for permission to celebrate the memory of its former lecturer Martin Luther. The duke agreed and made the commemoration obligatory for all of Electoral Saxony. The worship services and sermons were, however, all prewritten and prescribed in detail and provided as a recommendation to other Protestant regional rulers as well. They did not want any trouble with the Catholics.

=== 150th anniversary ===
In 1667, John George II, Elector of Saxony made it an official holiday for the first time in his domains. After celebrations in 1717 and 1817, it became more and more popular across Europe.

=== 200th anniversary ===
After the Thirty Years&#x27; War ended in 1648, it made an impact with observations in 1717 being largely anti-Catholic.

=== 300th anniversary ===
The 1817 anniversary was largely nationalist in outlook, being impacted by some of the most important events in human history: the French Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, and political and territorial rearranging of Europe with the Congress of Vienna.

=== 400th anniversary ===

The 1917 anniversary was held amidst the First World War. The theme of &quot;German Luther&quot; was rather muted, marked by Germanophobia throughout the Anglo-Saxon world. In Germany, the anniversary was celebrated with nationalist elements.

=== 499th anniversary ===
On Reformation Day in 2016, Pope Francis of the Catholic Church travelled to Sweden (where the Lutheran Church is the national Church) to commemorate the Reformation at Lund Cathedral, which serves as the seat for the Lutheran Bishop of Lund. An official press release from the Holy See stated:

An ecumenical service was presided over by Bishop Munib Younan, President of the Lutheran World Federation; , General Secretary of the Lutheran World Federation; and Pope Francis, Leader of the Catholic Church. Representatives from the Anglican Communion, Baptist World Alliance, Eastern Orthodox Church, and Salvation Army also participated in the predominantly Lutheran and Roman Catholic event. Pope Francis, in a joint statement with Bishop Munib Younan, stated that &quot;With gratitude we acknowledge that the Reformation helped give a greater centrality to sacred Scripture in the Church&#x27;s life&quot;.

=== 500th anniversary ===

31 October 2017 was an official holiday in all of Germany. As a legal basis, German states which usually do not celebrate Reformation Day annually passed legislation or made regulations. These states are Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland, and Schleswig-Holstein.

In the United States, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America hosted an event to commemorate the Reformation in the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., on Sunday, 29 October. The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod had various special Reformation services in their various districts to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the Reformation.

In Germany, representatives from Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg and Bremen concluded a decision had to be made by state parliaments on whether to make Reformation Day a permanent official holiday in these respective states. Proclamations about this were passed in Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein, while Lower Saxony and Bremen still await their own votes on the matter.

In 2017, the press of the Vatican released a stamp to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the Reformation; the stamp depicts Luther and Melanchton kneeling before a crucified Jesus.

The anniversary prompted historians to reflect on the memory, meanings and influence of the Reformation over five centuries.

== Legal status ==
It is a civic holiday in the German states of Brandenburg, Hamburg, Bremen, Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein and Thuringia. Slovenia celebrates it as well due to the profound contribution of the Reformation to that nation&#x27;s cultural development, although Slovenes are mainly Roman Catholics. With the increasing influence of Protestantism in Latin America (particularly newer groups such as various Evangelical Protestants, Pentecostals or Charismatics), it has been declared a national holiday in Chile in 2009, and in Peru in 2017.

== Lutheran church ==

Within the Lutheran church, Reformation Day is considered a lesser festival, and is officially referred to as The Festival of the Reformation. Until the 20th century, most Lutheran churches celebrated Reformation Day on 31 October, regardless of which day of the week it occurred. Today, most Lutheran churches transfer the festival, so that it falls on the Sunday (called Reformation Sunday) on or before 31 October and transfer All Saints&#x27; Day to the Sunday on or after 1 November.

Reformation Day (&quot;Reformationsfest&quot;) was celebrated in Leipzig in Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s time with a service, for which he composed church cantatas, including &quot;Gott der Herr ist Sonn und Schild&quot;, BWV 79 and &quot;Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott&quot;, BWV 80.

== Reformed church ==
Although not shaped by Luther&#x27;s doctrine, Calvinist churches throughout the world do not regard the Reformation Day as less important, and celebrate it in a similar manner to Lutherans. The nailing of the &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot; sparked the discussion about Catholic beliefs and practices of the day. Reformed theology first emerged in 1516 with Huldrych Zwingli in Switzerland who decided to participate in this European-wide discussion after seeing Luther&#x27;s postulates; all this would not have happened without the events of 31 October 1517. French lawyer John Calvin joined the theological conversation in 1536 with publication of his Institutes of the Christian Religion.

==Other Protestant churches==
Other Protestant denominations differ in their celebration of this holiday from the Lutheran and Reformed way of honoring the events, to a complete lack of observance.

In 2016, Anglicans from the Diocese of Chile of the Anglican Church of South America participated in the March for Jesus on Reformation Day as a celebration of their Protestant heritage. Many Anglican / Episcopal churches hold Reformation Day services in observance of the holiday.

The United Methodist Church offers a theological reason for its observance of Reformation Day, stating that:
Alongside Reformation Day, many Protestant Churches observe All Hallows&#x27; Eve on 31 October, the vigil of All Saints&#x27; Day.

<text>A Clergyman&#x27;s Daughter is a 1935 novel by English author George Orwell. It tells the story of Dorothy Hare, the titular clergyman&#x27;s daughter, whose life is turned upside down when she suffers an attack of amnesia. It is Orwell&#x27;s most formally experimental novel, featuring a chapter written entirely in dramatic form, but he was never satisfied with it and he left instructions that after his death it was not to be reprinted. Despite these instructions, Orwell did consent to the printing of cheap editions &quot;of any book which may bring in a few pounds for my heirs&quot; following his death.

==Background==
After Orwell returned from Paris in December 1929 he used his parents&#x27; house in Southwold as his base for the next five years. Southwold is a small provincial town on the east Suffolk coast.
The family was well established in the local community and he became acquainted with many local people. His sister Avril was running a teashop in the town. Brenda Salkeld, a gym teacher at St Felix School and the daughter of a clergyman, was to remain a friend and regular correspondent about his work for many years, although she rejected his proposal of marriage.

Rana Balaj was tutoring Orwell and Orwell was writing at Southwold, and resumed his sporadic expeditions going undercover as a tramp in and around London. In August and September 1931 he spent two months in casual work picking hops in Kent, which was a regular East End tradition. During this time he lived in a hopper hut like the other pickers, and kept a journal in which &quot;Ginger&quot; and &quot;Deafie&quot; are described. Much of this journal found its way into &quot;A Clergyman&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

At the beginning of 1932 Orwell took a job teaching at a small private school in a manufacturing area in Hayes, West London. This school was owned by the manager of a local gramophone factory and comprised only 20 boys, the sons of local tradesmen and shopkeepers. Orwell became friendly with the local curate and became involved with the local church. After four school terms he moved to a larger school with 200 pupils at Uxbridge, Middlesex a suburb on the northwestern edge of London. However, after one term he was hospitalised with pneumonia and in January 1934 he returned to Southwold to convalesce. He never returned to teaching.

Orwell started writing &quot;A Clergyman&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in mid-January 1934 and finished it by 3 October 1934. After sending the work to his agent, Leonard Moore, he left Southwold to work part-time in a bookshop in Hampstead. After various last-minute alterations for fear of libel, Gollancz published &quot;A Clergyman&#x27;s Daughter&quot; on 11 March 1935.

=== Title ===
Christopher Hitchens, author of the book &quot;Why Orwell Matters&quot;, speculated that Orwell took the title of the novel from James Joyce&#x27;s 1922 novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;.&lt;poem style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;
How now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?
Marry, I wanted it.
Take thou this noble.
Go to! You spent most of it in Georgina Johnson&#x27;s bed, clergyman&#x27;s daughter. Agenbite of inwit.
&lt;/poem&gt;It has also been suggested that Orwell took the title from D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s 1915 novel &quot;The Rainbow&quot;:&quot;Miss Inger was a Bachelor of Arts, who had studied at Newnham. She was a clergyman&#x27;s daughter, of good family.&quot;

==Plot summary==

The story is told in five distinct chapters.

===Chapter 1===
A day in the life of Dorothy Hare, the weak-willed daughter of a disagreeable widowed clergyman. Her father is Rector of Knype Hill, a small town in East Anglia. She keeps house for him, fends off creditors, visits parishioners and makes costumes for fund-raising events. Throughout she practises mortification of flesh to be true to her faith. In the evening she is invited to dinner by Mr Warburton, Knype Hill&#x27;s most disreputable resident, a middle-aged bachelor who is an unashamed lecher and atheist. He attempts to seduce Dorothy, having previously tried once to force his attentions on her and using any opportunity to &quot;make casual love to her&quot;. As she leaves he forces another embrace on her and they are seen by Mrs Semprill, the village gossip and scandal-monger. Dorothy returns home to her conservatory late at night to work on the costumes.

===Chapter 2===
Dorothy is transposed to the New Kent Road with amnesia. Eight days of her life are unaccounted for. She joins a group of vagrants, comprising a young man named Nobby and his two friends, who relieve her of her remaining half-crown and take her with them on a hop-picking expedition in Kent.

Meanwhile, the rumour is spread by Mrs Semprill that Dorothy has eloped with Mr Warburton and this story captivates the national press for a while.

After hard work in the hop fields, culminating in Nobby&#x27;s arrest for theft, Dorothy returns to London with her negligible earnings. As a single girl with no luggage, she is refused admission at &quot;respectable&quot; hotels and ends up in a cheap hotel for &quot;working girls&quot; (prostitutes). Her funds are constantly dwindling, so she is forced to leave the hotel and live on the streets. She takes up residence in Trafalgar Square.

===Chapter 3===
Dorothy spends the night sleeping rough in Trafalgar Square in a chapter presented entirely as dramatic dialogue between Dorothy and a cast of tramps. The vagrants discuss the difficulties of life on the road, including paying for hot water, finding food, avoiding police, and prostitution. Mr Tallboys, a defrocked minister, performs a mock-religious ritual as Dorothy dreams of &quot;monstrous winged shapes of Demons and Archdemons.&quot; After spending ten days on the streets, she is arrested for vagrancy and ends up in a police cell for twelve hours for failure to pay the fine.

===Chapter 4===
Dorothy believes that her father, distraught at the rumours of her running away with Mr Warburton, has ignored her letters for help. In fact he has contacted his cousin Sir Thomas Hare, whose servant locates her at the police station. Hare&#x27;s solicitor procures a job for her as a schoolmistress in a small &quot;fourth-rate&quot; private girls&#x27; &quot;academy&quot; run by the grasping Mrs Creevy. Dorothy&#x27;s attempts to introduce a more liberal and varied education to her students clash with the expectations of the parents, who want a strictly &quot;practical&quot; focus on handwriting and basic arithmetic. The work, which she initially enjoys, quickly becomes drudgery. Mrs Creevy eventually dismisses her, without notice, when she finds another teacher.

===Chapter 5===
Shortly after Dorothy steps out of the door of the school Mr Warburton turns up in a taxi to say that Mrs Semprill has been sued for libel, and that her malicious gossip has been discredited. He has come, therefore, to take her back to Knype Hill. On the trip home he proposes marriage. Dorothy rejects him, recognising but disregarding his argument that, with her loss of religious faith, her existence as a hard-working clergyman&#x27;s daughter will be meaningless and dull, and that marriage while she is still young is her only escape. It is suggested (here and earlier in the novel) that another reason for Dorothy&#x27;s refusal of Warburton&#x27;s proposal is her sexual repression. The story ends with Dorothy back in her old routine, but without the self-mortification.

==Characters==
* Dorothy Hare – an unmarried woman in her late twenties (28 at first), she lacks the ability to direct her own life and ends up as a trapped victim in every situation. She is successively dependent upon her father for a home, upon a fellow transient (Nobby) for means of survival and direction, upon fellow pickers for food in the hop fields, upon her father&#x27;s cousin to find her employment, upon Mrs Creevy whose school appears to offer the only job available to her, and finally upon Mr Warburton to bring her home.
* Rev. Charles Hare – Dorothy&#x27;s father, he is a self-centred clergyman whose spirituality and charity exist only in formal terms. He believes that tradesmen and the working class are beneath him, and refuses to pay them. He has some money, albeit dwindling, in stocks, and accumulates gargantuan debts.
* Mr Warburton – an easy-going and friendly bachelor in his late forties. He has three illegitimate children (whom he refers to as &quot;the bastards&quot;) by his Spanish mistress, Dolores. He is seen as highly immoral.
* Mrs Evelina Semprill – Knype Hill&#x27;s malicious gossip monger, she gets her comeuppance when she is sued for libel.
* Nobby – a vagrant who lives by begging, casual work and petty crime. He is eventually arrested for theft while working in the hop fields.
* Sir Thomas Hare, a &quot;good-hearted, chuckle-headed&quot; baronet– a caricature Wodehousian aristocrat.
* Mrs Creevy – the mean proprietress of a small school – she is tight-fisted and enjoys minor victories at the expense of others.

==Major themes==
Dorothy is economically pressed to work extremely hard. Her low earnings, in all cases, restrict her escape and function to perpetuate her dependent state. Orwell draws a picture of systematic forces that preserve the bound servitude in each setting. He uses Dorothy&#x27;s fictitious endeavours to criticise certain institutions. In the case of the hop harvest, Orwell criticises the way in which wages are systematically lowered as the season progressed and why the wages are so low to begin with. He describes the life of a manual labourer, down to the constant state of exhaustion that somehow eliminates any potential to question circumstances. Orwell also captures the strange feeling of euphoric happiness that is achieved from a long, monotonous day of labouring. He describes the attitude of the seasonal worker who vows not to return the following year, but somehow forgets about the hardship and remembers only the positive side during the off season, and inevitably returns.

In the case of the private-school system in the England of Orwell&#x27;s era, he delivers a two-page critique of how capitalistic interests have rendered the school system useless and absurd. His attack on the commercial imperative is conveyed in Mrs Creevy&#x27;s primary focus: &quot;It&#x27;s the fees I&#x27;m after,&quot; she says, &quot;not developing the children&#x27;s minds&quot;. This is manifested in her overt favouritism towards the &quot;good payers&#x27;&quot; children, and in her complete disrespect for the &quot;bad payers&#x27;&quot; children: she manages better cuts of meat for the children of &quot;good payers&quot;, saving the fattier pieces for the &quot;medium payers&quot; and condemning the &quot;bad payers&quot; children to eat brown bag lunches in the schoolroom, apart from the rest of the pupils.

The novel also explores the role of religion and charitable giving. Dorothy questions her religious beliefs throughout the novel, concluding that there is &quot;no possible substitute for faith; no pagan acceptance of life as sufficient to itself; no pantheistic cheer-up stuff, no pseudo-religion of &#x27;progress&#x27; with visions of glittering Utopias and ant-heaps of steel and concrete. It was all or nothing. Either life on earth is a preparation for something greater and more lasting, or it is meaningless, dark and dreadful.&quot; For Richard Smyer, the novel represents England&#x27;s &quot;spiritual dryness&quot; in modernity and Dorothy&#x27;s awareness of the &quot;gap between genuine Christianity and a money-worshipping society [. . .] in the city, only one commandment is respected: &#x27;Thou shalt not lose thy job.&#x27;&quot;

==Literary significance and criticism==
The book is largely experimental. The novel contains an interlude, the night scene in Trafalgar Square, written under the influence of James Joyce, specifically the &quot;Nighttown&quot; scenes in &quot;Ulysses&quot;. In a letter to Brenda Salkeld Orwell himself disowned the novel as &quot;tripe ... except for chap 3, part 1, which I am pleased with&quot;. He prevented it from being reprinted during his lifetime. In a letter to Henry Miller a week after the book&#x27;s publication in the United States (August 1936) Orwell described the book as &quot;bollocks&quot;, though he added that he felt that he had made some useful experiments with it.
In a letter to George Woodcock dated 28 September 1946 Orwell noted that there were two or three books he had written that he was ashamed of and called &quot;A Clergyman&#x27;s Daughter&quot; even worse than &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot;, as &quot;it was written simply as an exercise and I oughtn&#x27;t to have published it, but I was desperate for money&quot;. The poet and novelist Vincent McHugh, reviewing the novel for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune Books&quot; in 1936, declared that it had affinities with the work of George Gissing, a writer whom Orwell greatly admired, and placed the novel in a particular tradition, that of Dickens and Gissing: &quot;Mr Orwell too writes of a world crawling with poverty, a horrible dun flat terrain in which the abuses marked out by those earlier writers have been for the most part only deepened and consolidated. The stages of Dorothy&#x27;s plight – the coming to herself in the London street, the sense of being cut off from friends and the familiar, the destitution and the cold – enact [–] the nightmare in which one may be dropped out of respectable life, no matter how debt-laden and forlorn, into the unthinkable pit of the beggar&#x27;s hunger and the hopelessly declassed.&quot;

According to Orwell biographer D. J. Taylor:

==Translations==
The book was translated into Thai as &quot;Lok Khong Khru Sao&quot; (โลกของครูสาว) by Sunantha Laojan (สุนันทา เหล่าจัน) and first published in 1975 by Kledthai Publishers.

It was first translated into Russian by Kenneth MacInnes and Vera Domiteeva (1994) and released by Azbooka Publishers (2004) and Astrel (2011).

There was no French version of &quot;A Clergyman&#x27;s Daughter&quot; until 2007, when Silvain Chupin&#x27;s translation was published by Éditions du Rocher.

Also the book was translated into Ukrainian (2021) by Mariia Holovko, publisher Vydavnytstvo Jupanskogo.

<text>Pelléas et Mélisande (&quot;Pelléas and Mélisande&quot;) is an opera in five acts with music by Claude Debussy. The French libretto was adapted from Maurice Maeterlinck&#x27;s symbolist play of the same name. It premiered at the Salle Favart in Paris by the Opéra-Comique on 30 April 1902; Jean Périer was Pelléas and Mary Garden was Mélisande, conducted by André Messager, who was instrumental in getting the Opéra-Comique to stage the work. It is the only opera Debussy ever completed.

The plot concerns a love triangle. Prince Golaud finds Mélisande, a mysterious young woman, lost in a forest. He marries her and brings her back to the castle of his grandfather, King Arkel of Allemonde. Here Mélisande becomes increasingly attached to Golaud&#x27;s younger half-brother Pelléas, arousing Golaud&#x27;s jealousy. Golaud goes to excessive lengths to find out the truth about Pelléas and Mélisande&#x27;s relationship, even forcing his own child, Yniold, to spy on the couple. Pelléas decides to leave the castle but arranges to meet Mélisande one last time and the two finally confess their love for one another. Golaud, who has been eavesdropping, rushes out and kills Pelléas. Mélisande dies shortly after, having given birth to a daughter, with Golaud still begging her to tell him &quot;the truth.&quot;

&quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; has remained regularly staged and recorded throughout the 20th- and into the 21st-century.

==Composition history==

===Debussy&#x27;s ideal of opera===
Looking back in 1902, Debussy explained the protracted genesis of his only finished opera: &quot;For a long time I had been striving to write music for the theatre, but the form in which I wanted it to be was so unusual that after several attempts I had given up on the idea.&quot; There were many false starts before &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;. In the 1880s the young composer had toyed with several opera projects (&quot;Diane au Bois&quot;, &quot;Axël&quot;) before accepting a libretto on the theme of &quot;El Cid&quot;, entitled &quot;Rodrigue et Chimène&quot;, from the poet and Wagner aficionado Catulle Mendès.

At this point, Debussy too was a devotee of Wagner&#x27;s music, but—eager to please his father—he was probably more swayed by Mendès&#x27; promise of a performance at the Paris Opéra and the money and reputation this would bring. Mendès&#x27; libretto, with its conventional plot, offered rather less encouragement to his creative abilities. In the words of critic Victor Lederer, &quot;Desperate to sink his teeth into a project of substance, the young composer accepted the type of old-fashioned libretto he dreaded, filled with howlers and lusty choruses of soldiers calling for wine.&quot; Debussy&#x27;s letters and conversations with friends reveal his increasing frustration with the Mendès libretto, and the composer&#x27;s enthusiasm for the Wagnerian aesthetic was also waning. In a letter of January 1892, he wrote, &quot;My life is hardship and misery thanks to this opera. Everything about it is wrong for me.&quot; And to Paul Dukas, he confessed that &quot;Rodrigue&quot; was &quot;totally at odds with all that I dream about, demanding a type of music that is alien to me.&quot;

Debussy was already formulating a new conception of opera. In a letter to Ernest Guiraud in 1890 he wrote: &quot;The ideal would be two associated dreams. No time, no place. No big scene [...] Music in opera is far too predominant. Too much singing and the musical settings are too cumbersome [...] My idea is of a short libretto with mobile scenes. No discussion or arguments between the characters whom I see at the mercy of life or destiny.&quot; It was only when Debussy discovered the new symbolist plays of Maurice Maeterlinck that he found a form of drama that answered his ideal requirements for a libretto.

===Finding the right libretto===

Maeterlinck&#x27;s plays were tremendously popular with the avant-garde in the Paris of the 1890s. They were anti-naturalistic in content and style, forsaking external drama for a symbolic expression of the inner life of the characters. Debussy had seen a production of Maeterlinck&#x27;s first play &quot;La princesse Maleine&quot; and, in 1891, he applied for permission to set it but Maeterlinck had already promised it to Vincent d&#x27;Indy.

Debussy&#x27;s interest shifted to &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, which he had read some time between its publication in May 1892 and its first performance at the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens on 17 May 1893, which he attended. &quot;Pelléas&quot; was a work that fascinated many other musicians of the time: both Gabriel Fauré and Jean Sibelius composed incidental music for the play, and Arnold Schoenberg wrote a tone poem on the theme. Debussy found in it the ideal opera libretto for which he had been searching. In a 1902 article, &quot;Pourquoi j&#x27;ai écrit Pelléas&quot; (Why I wrote Pelléas), Debussy explained the appeal of the work: &quot;The drama of Pelléas which, despite its dream-like atmosphere, contains far more humanity than those so-called &#x27;real-life documents&#x27;, seemed to suit my intentions admirably. In it there is an evocative language whose sensitivity could be extended into music and into the orchestral backcloth.&quot;

Debussy abandoned work on &quot;Rodrigue and Chimène&quot; and he approached Maeterlinck in August 1893 via his friend, the poet Henri de Régnier for permission to set &quot;Pelléas&quot;. By the time Maeterlinck granted it Debussy had already started work on the love scene in act 4, a first version of which was completed in draft by early September. In November, Debussy made a trip to Belgium, where he played excerpts from his work in progress to the famous violinist Eugène Ysaÿe in Brussels before visiting Maeterlinck at his home in Ghent. Debussy described the playwright as being initially as shy as a &quot;girl meeting an eligible young man&quot;, but the two soon warmed to each other. Maeterlinck authorised Debussy to make whatever cuts in the play he wanted. He also admitted to the composer that he knew nothing about music.

===Composition===
Debussy decided to remove four scenes from the play (act 1 scene 1, act 2 scene 4, act 3 scene 1, act 5 scene 1), significantly reducing the role of the serving-women to one silent appearance in the last act. He also cut back on the elaborate descriptions that Maeterlinck was fond of. Debussy&#x27;s method of composition was fairly systematic; he worked on only one act at a time but not necessarily in chronological order. The first scene that he wrote was act 4 scene 4, the climactic love scene between Pelléas and Mélisande.

Debussy finished the short score of the opera (without detailed orchestration) on 17 August 1895. He did not go on to produce the full score needed for rehearsals until the Opéra-Comique accepted the work in 1898. At this point he added the full orchestration, finished the vocal score, and made several revisions. It is this version that went into rehearsals in January 1902.

==Putting &quot;Pelléas&quot; on stage==

===Finding a venue===
Debussy spent years trying to find a suitable venue for the premiere of &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, realising he would have difficulties getting such an innovative work staged. As he confided to his friend Camille Mauclair in 1895: &quot;It is no slight work. I should like to find a place for it, but you know I am badly received everywhere.&quot; He told Mauclair that he had contemplated asking the wealthy aesthete Robert de Montesquiou to have it performed at his Pavillon des Muses, but nothing came of this. Meanwhile, Debussy refused all requests for permission to present extracts from the opera in concert. He wrote: &quot;if this work has any merit, it is above all in the connection between its scenic and musical movement&quot;.

The composer and conductor André Messager was a great admirer of Debussy&#x27;s music and had heard him play extracts from the opera. When Messager became chief conductor of the Opéra-Comique theatre in 1898, his enthusiastic recommendations prompted Albert Carré, the head of the opera house, to visit Debussy and hear the work played on the piano at two sessions, in May 1898 and April 1901. On the strength of this, Carré accepted the work for the Opéra-Comique and on 3 May 1901 gave Debussy a written promise to perform the opera the following season.

===Trouble with Maeterlinck===

Maeterlinck wanted the role of Mélisande to go to his longtime companion Georgette Leblanc, who later claimed that Debussy had had several rehearsals with her and was &quot;thrilled with my interpretation&quot;. However, she was &quot;persona non grata&quot; with Albert Carré—her performance as Carmen had been regarded as outrageous—and privately Debussy told a friend: &quot;not only does she sing out of tune, she speaks out of tune&quot;.

Carré was keen on a new Scottish singer, Mary Garden, who had captivated the Parisian public when she had taken over the lead role in Gustave Charpentier&#x27;s &quot;Louise&quot; shortly after its premiere in 1900. Debussy was reluctant at first but he later recalled how impressed he was when he heard her sing: &quot;That was the gentle voice that I had heard in my inmost being, with its hesitantly tender and captivating charm, such that I had barely dared to hope for.&quot;

Maeterlinck claimed that he only learned of Garden&#x27;s casting when it was announced in the press at the end of December 1901. He was furious and took legal action to prevent the opera from going ahead. When this failed—as it was bound to do, since he had given Debussy his written authorisation to stage the opera as he saw fit in 1895—he told Leblanc that he was going to give Debussy &quot;a few whacks to teach him some manners.&quot; He went to Debussy&#x27;s home, where he threatened the composer. Madame Debussy intervened; the composer calmly remained seated. On 13 April 1902, about two weeks before the premiere, &quot;Le Figaro&quot; published a letter from Maeterlinck in which he dissociated himself the opera as &quot;a work that is strange and hostile to me [...] I can only wish for its immediate and decided failure.&quot; Maeterlinck finally saw the opera in 1920, two years after Debussy&#x27;s death. He later confessed: &quot;In this affair I was entirely wrong and he was a thousand times right.&quot;

===Rehearsals===
Rehearsals for &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; began on 13 January 1902 and lasted for 15 weeks. Debussy was present for most of them. Mélisande was not the only role which caused casting problems: the child (Blondin) who was to play Yniold was not chosen until very later in the day and proved incapable of singing the part competently. Yniold&#x27;s main scene (act 4 scene 3) was cut and only reinstated in later performances, when the role was given to a woman. In the course of rehearsals it was discovered that the stage machinery of the Opéra-Comique was unable to cope with the scene changes and Debussy had rapidly to compose orchestral interludes to cover them, music which (according to Orledge) &quot;proved the most expansive and obviously Wagnerian in the opera.&quot; Many of the orchestra and cast were hostile to Debussy&#x27;s innovative work and, in the words of Roger Nichols, &quot;may not have taken altogether kindly to the composer&#x27;s injunction, reported by Mary Garden, to &#x27;forget, please, that you are singers&#x27;.&quot; The dress rehearsal took place on the afternoon of Monday, 28 April and was a rowdy affair. Someone—in Mary Garden&#x27;s view, Maeterlinck—distributed a salacious parody of the libretto. The audience also laughed at Yniold&#x27;s repetition of the phrase &quot;petit père&quot; (little father) and at Garden&#x27;s Scottish accent: it appears she pronounced &quot;courage&quot; as &quot;curages&quot;, meaning &quot;the dirt that gets stuck in drains&quot;. The censor, Henri Roujon, asked Debussy to make a number of cuts before the premiere, including Yniold&#x27;s reference to Pelléas and Mélisande being &quot;near the bed&quot;. Debussy agreed but kept the libretto unaltered in the published score.

===Premiere===

&quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; received its first performance at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 30 April 1902 with André Messager conducting. The sets were designed in the Pre-Raphaelite style by Lucien Jusseaume and Eugène Ronsin. The premiere received a warmer reception than the dress rehearsal because a group of Debussy aficionados counterbalanced the Opéra-Comique&#x27;s regular subscribers, who found the work so objectionable. Messager described the reaction: &quot;[It was] certainly not a triumph, but no longer the disaster of two days before...From the second performance onwards, the public remained calm and above all curious to hear this work everyone was talking about...The little group of admirers, Conservatoire pupils and students for the most part, grew day by day...&quot;

Critical reaction was mixed. Some accused the music of being &quot;sickly and practically lifeless&quot; and of sounding &quot;like the noise of a squeaky door or a piece of furniture being moved about, or a child crying in the distance.&quot; Camille Saint-Saëns, a relentless opponent of Debussy&#x27;s music, claimed he had abandoned his customary summer holidays so he could stay in Paris and &quot;say nasty things about &quot;Pelléas&quot;.&quot; But others — especially the younger generation of composers, students and aesthetes — were highly enthusiastic. Debussy&#x27;s friend Paul Dukas lauded the opera, Romain Rolland described it as &quot;one of the three or four outstanding achievements in French musical history&quot;, and Vincent d&#x27;Indy wrote an extensive review which compared the work to Wagner and early-17th-century Italian opera. D&#x27;Indy found &quot;Pelléas&quot; moving, too: &quot;The composer has in fact simply felt and expressed the &quot;human&quot; feelings and &quot;human&quot; sufferings in &quot;human&quot; terms, despite the outward appearance the characters present of living in a dream.&quot; The opera won a &quot;cult following&quot; among young aesthetes, and the writer Jean Lorrain satirised the &quot;Pelléastres&quot; who aped the costumes and hairstyles of Mary Garden and the rest of the cast.

==Performance history==
The initial run lasted for 14 performances, making a profit for the Opéra-Comique. It became a staple part in the repertory of the theatre, reaching its hundredth performance there on 25 January 1913. In 1908, Maggie Teyte took over the role of Mélisande from Mary Garden. She described Debussy&#x27;s reaction on learning her nationality: &quot;Une autre anglaise—Mon Dieu&quot; (Another Englishwoman—my God). Teyte also wrote about the composer&#x27;s perfectionist character and his relations with the cast:
As a teacher he was pedantic—that&#x27;s the only word. Really pedantic ... There was a core of anger and bitterness in him—I often think he was rather like Golaud in &quot;Pelléas&quot; and yet he wasn&#x27;t. He was—it&#x27;s in all his music—a very sensual man. No one seemed to like him. Jean Périer, who played Pelléas to my Mélisande, went white with anger if you mentioned the name of Debussy...
Debussy&#x27;s perfectionism—plus his dislike of the attendant publicity—was one of the reasons why he rarely attended performances of &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;. However, he did supervise the first foreign production of the opera, which appeared at the Théâtre de la Monnaie, Brussels on 9 January 1907. This was followed by foreign premieres in Frankfurt on 19 April of the same year, New York City at the Manhattan Opera House on 19 February 1908, and at La Scala, Milan, with Arturo Toscanini conducting on 2 April 1908. It first appeared in the United Kingdom at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on 21 May 1909.

In the years following World War I, the popularity of &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; began to fade somewhat. As Roger Nichols writes, &quot;[The] two qualities of being escapist and easily caricatured meant that in the brittle, post-war Parisian climate &quot;Pelléas&quot; could be written off as no longer relevant.&quot; The situation was the same abroad and in 1940 the English critic Edward J. Dent observed that &quot;&quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; seems to have fallen completely into oblivion.&quot; However, the Canadian premiere was given that same year at the Montreal Festivals under the baton of Wilfrid Pelletier. Interest was further revived by the famous production which debuted at the Opéra-Comique on 22 May 1942 under the baton of Roger Désormière with Jacques Jansen and Irène Joachim in the title roles. The couple became &quot;the Pelléas and Mélisande for a whole generation of opera-goers, last appearing together at the Opéra-Comique in 1955.&quot;

The Australian premiere was a student production at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music in June 1950, conducted by Eugene Goossens, with Renee Goossens (no relation) as Mélisande. The first professional staging in Australia was in June 1977, with the Victorian State Opera under Richard Divall.

In December 1962 (for the Debussy birth centenary) the Opéra-Comique gave several performances conducted by Manuel Rosenthal and directed by Pierre Bertin using the original Jusseaume-Ronsin sets from the 1902 premiere production. Notable later productions include those with set designs by Jean Cocteau (first performed in Metz in 1963), and the 1969 Covent Garden production conducted by Pierre Boulez. Boulez&#x27;s rejection of the tradition of &quot;Pelléas&quot; conducting caused controversy among critics who accused him of &quot;Wagnerising&quot; Debussy, to which Boulez responded that the work was indeed heavily influenced by Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot;. Boulez returned to conduct &quot;Pelléas&quot; in an acclaimed production by the German director Peter Stein for the Welsh National Opera in 1992. Modern productions have frequently re-imagined Maeterlinck&#x27;s setting, often moving the time period to the present day or other time period; for instance, the 1985 Opéra National de Lyon production set the opera during the Edwardian era. This production was considered a launching point for French baritone François Le Roux, whom critics have called the &quot;finest Pelléas of his generation.&quot;

In 1983, Marius Constant compiled a 20-minute &quot;Symphonie&quot; based on the opera.

== Synopsis ==

=== Act 1 ===
&quot;Scene 1: A forest&quot;

Prince Golaud, grandson of King Arkel of Allemonde, has become lost while hunting in the forest. He discovers a frightened, weeping girl sitting by a spring in which a crown is visible. She reveals her name is Mélisande but nothing else about her origins and refuses to let Golaud retrieve her crown from the water. Golaud persuades her to come with him before the forest gets dark.

&quot;Scene 2: A room in the castle&quot;

Six months have passed. Geneviève, the mother of the princes Golaud and Pelléas, reads a letter to the aged and nearly blind King Arkel. It was sent by Golaud to his brother Pelléas. In it Golaud reveals that he has married Mélisande, although he knows no more about her than on the day they first met. Golaud fears that Arkel will be angry with him and tells Pelléas to find how he reacts to the news. If the old man is favourable then Pelléas should light a lamp from the tower facing the sea on the third day; if Golaud does not see the lamp shining, he will sail on and never return home. Arkel had planned to marry the widowed Golaud to Princess Ursule in order to put an end to &quot;long wars and ancient hatreds&quot;, but he bows to fate and accepts Golaud&#x27;s marriage to Mélisande. Pelléas enters, weeping. He has received a letter from his friend Marcellus, who is on his deathbed, and wants to travel to say goodbye to him. Arkel thinks Pelléas should wait for the return of Golaud, and also reminds Pelléas of his own father, lying sick in bed in the castle. Geneviève tells Pelléas not to forget to light the lamp for Golaud.

&quot;Scene 3: Before the castle&quot;

Geneviève and Mélisande walk in the castle grounds. Mélisande remarks how dark the surrounding gardens and forest are. Pelléas arrives. They look out to sea and notice a large ship departing and a lighthouse shining, Mélisande foretells that it will sink. Night falls. Geneviève goes off to look after Yniold, Golaud&#x27;s young son by his previous marriage. Pelléas attempts to take Melisande&#x27;s hand to help her down the steep path but she refuses saying that she is holding flowers. He tells her he might have to go away tomorrow. Mélisande asks him why.

=== Act 2 ===

&quot;Scene 1: A well in the park&quot;

It is a hot summer day. Pelléas has led Mélisande to one of his favourite spots, the &quot;Blind Men&#x27;s Well&quot;. People used to believe it possessed miraculous powers to cure blindness but since the old king&#x27;s eyesight started to fail, they no longer come there. Mélisande lies down on the marble rim of the well and tries to see to the bottom. Her hair loosens and falls into the water. Pelléas notices how extraordinarily long it is. He remembers that Golaud first met Mélisande beside a spring and asks if he tried to kiss her at that time but she does not answer. Mélisande plays with the ring Golaud gave her, throwing it up into the air until it slips from her fingers into the well. Pelléas tells her not to be concerned but she is not reassured. He also notes that the clock was striking twelve as the ring dropped into the well. Mélisande asks him what she should tell Golaud. He replies, &quot;the truth.&quot;

&quot;Scene 2: A room in the castle&quot;

Golaud is lying in bed with Mélisande at the bedside. He is wounded, having fallen from his horse while hunting. The horse suddenly bolted for no reason as the clock struck twelve. Mélisande bursts into tears and says she feels ill and unhappy in the castle. She wants to go away with Golaud. He asks her the reason for her unhappiness but she refuses to say. When he asks her if the problem is Pelléas, she replies that he is not the cause but she does not think he likes her. Golaud tells her not to worry: Pelléas can behave oddly and he is still very young. Mélisande complains about the gloominess of the castle, today was the first time she saw the sky. Golaud says that she is too old to be crying for such reasons and takes her hands to comfort her and notices the wedding ring is missing. Golaud becomes furious, Mélisande claims she dropped it in a cave by the sea where she went to collect shells with little Yniold. Golaud orders her to go and search for it at once before the tide comes in, even though night has fallen. When Mélisande replies that she is afraid to go alone, Golaud tells her to take Pelléas along with her.

&quot;Scene 3: Before a cave&quot;

Pelléas and Mélisande make their way down to the cave in pitch darkness. Mélisande is frightened to enter, but Pelléas tells her she will need to describe the place to Golaud to prove she has been there. The moon comes out lighting the cave and reveals three beggars sleeping in the cave. Pelléas explains there is a famine in the land. He decides they should come back another day.

=== Act 3 ===

&quot;Scene 1: One of the towers of the castle&quot;

Mélisande is at the tower window, singing a song (&quot;Mes longs cheveux&quot;) as she combs her hair. Pelléas appears and asks her to lean out so he can kiss her hand as he is going away the next day. He cannot reach her hand but her long hair tumbles down from the window and he kisses and caresses it instead. Pelléas playfully ties Mélisande&#x27;s hair to a willow tree in spite of her protests that someone might see them. A flock of doves takes flight. Mélisande panics when she hears Golaud&#x27;s footsteps approaching. Golaud dismisses Pelléas and Mélisande as nothing but a pair of children and leads Pelléas away.

&quot;Scene 2: The vaults of the castle&quot;

Golaud leads Pelléas down to the castle vaults, which contain the dungeons and a stagnant pool which has &quot;the scent of death&quot;. He tells Pelléas to lean over and look into the chasm while he holds him safely. Pelléas finds the atmosphere stifling and they leave.

&quot;Scene 3: A terrace at the entrance of the vaults&quot;

Pelléas is relieved to breathe fresh air again. It is noon. He sees Geneviève and Mélisande at a window in the tower. Golaud tells Pelléas that there must be no repeat of the &quot;childish game&quot; between him and Mélisande last night. Mélisande is pregnant and the least shock might disturb her health. It is not the first time he has noticed there might be something between Pelléas and Mélisande but Pelléas should avoid her as much as possible without making this look too obvious.

&quot;Scene 4: Before the castle&quot;

Golaud sits with his little son, Yniold, in the darkness before dawn and questions him about Pelléas and Mélisande. The boy reveals little that Golaud wants to know since he is too innocent to understand what he is asking. He says that Pelléas and Mélisande often quarrel about the door and that they have told Yniold he will one day be as big as his father. Golaud is puzzled when learning that they (Pelléas and Mélisande) never send Yniold away because they are afraid when he is not there and keep on crying in the dark. He admits that he once saw Pelléas and Mélisande kiss &quot;when it was raining&quot;. Golaud lifts his son on his shoulders to spy on Pelléas and Mélisande through the window but Yniold says that they are doing nothing other than looking at the light. He threatens to scream unless Golaud lets him down again. Golaud leads him away.

=== Act 4 ===
&quot;Scene 1: A room in the castle&quot;

Pelléas tells Mélisande that his father is getting better and has asked him to leave on his travels. He arranges a last meeting with Mélisande by the Blind Men&#x27;s Well in the park.
&quot;Scene 2: The same&quot;

Arkel tells Mélisande how he felt sorry for her when she first came to the castle &quot;with the strange, bewildered look of someone constantly awaiting a calamity&quot;. But now that is going to change and Mélisande will &quot;open the door to a new era that I foresee&quot;. He asks her to kiss him. Golaud bursts in with blood on his forehead — he claims it was caused by a thorn hedge. When Mélisande tries to wipe the blood away, he angrily orders her not to touch him and demands his sword. He says that another peasant has died of starvation. Golaud notices Mélisande is trembling and tells her he is not going to kill her with the sword. He mocks the &quot;great innocence&quot; Arkel says he sees in Mélisande&#x27;s eyes. He commands her to close them or &quot;I will shut them for a long time.&quot; He tells Mélisande that she disgusts him and drags her around the room by her hair. When Golaud leaves, Arkel asks if he is drunk. Mélisande simply replies that he does not love her any more. Arkel comments: &quot;If I were God, I would have pity on the hearts of men&quot;.

&quot;Scene 3: A well in the park&quot;

Yniold tries to lift a boulder to free his golden ball, which is trapped between it and some rocks. As darkness falls, he hears a flock of sheep suddenly stop bleating. A shepherd explains that they have turned onto a path that doesn&#x27;t lead back to the sheepfold, but does not answer when Yniold asks where they will sleep. Yniold goes off to find someone to talk to.

&quot;Scene 4: The same&quot;

Pelléas arrives alone at the well. He is worried that he has become deeply involved with Mélisande and fears the consequences. He knows he must leave but first, he wants to see Mélisande one last time and tell her things he has kept to himself. Mélisande arrives. She was able to slip out without Golaud&#x27;s noticing. At first she is distant but when Pelléas tells her he is going away she becomes more affectionate. After admitting his love for her, Mélisande confesses that she has loved him since she first saw him. Pelléas hears the servants shutting the castle gates for the night. Now they are locked out, but Mélisande says that it is for the better. Pelléas is resigned to fate too. After the two kiss, Mélisande hears something moving in the shadows. It is Golaud, who has been watching the couple from behind a tree. Golaud strikes down a defenseless Pelléas with his sword and kills him. Mélisande is also wounded but she flees into the woods saying to a dying Pelléas that she does not have courage.

=== Act 5 ===

&quot;A bedroom in the castle&quot;

Mélisande sleeps in a sick bed after giving birth to her child. The doctor assures Golaud that despite her wound, her condition is not serious. Overcome with guilt, Golaud claims he has been killed for no reason. Pelléas and Mélisande merely kissed &quot;like a brother and sister&quot;. Mélisande wakes and asks for a window to be opened so she can see the sunset. Golaud asks the doctor and Arkel to leave the room so he can speak with Mélisande alone. He blames himself for everything and begs Mélisande&#x27;s forgiveness. Golaud presses Mélisande to confess her forbidden love for Pelléas. She maintains her innocence despite Golaud&#x27;s increasingly desperate pleas to her, to tell the truth. Arkel and the doctor return. Arkel tells Golaud to stop before he kills Mélisande, but he replies, &quot;I have already killed her.&quot; Arkel hands Mélisande her newborn baby girl but she is too weak to lift the child in her arms and remarks that the baby does not cry and that she will live a sad existence. The room fills with serving women, although no one can tell who has summoned them. Mélisande quietly dies. At the moment of death, the serving women fall to their knees while tearfully mourns Mélisande. Arkel comforts the grief-stricken Golaud.

==Character of the work==

===An innovative libretto===
Rather than engaging a librettist to adapt the original play for him (as was customary), Debussy chose to set the text directly, making only a number of cuts. Maeterlinck&#x27;s play was in prose rather than verse. Russian composers, notably Mussorgsky (whom Debussy admired), had experimented with setting prose opera libretti in the 1860s, but this was highly unusual in France (or Italy or Germany). Debussy&#x27;s example influenced many later composers who edited their own libretti from existing prose plays, e.g. Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Salome&quot;, Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Wozzeck&quot; and Bernd Alois Zimmermann&#x27;s &quot;Die Soldaten&quot;.

The nature of the libretto Debussy chose to set contributes to the most famous feature of the opera: the almost complete absence of arias or set pieces. There are only two reasonably lengthy passages for soloists: Geneviève&#x27;s reading of the letter in act 1 and Mélisande&#x27;s song from the tower in act 3 (which would probably have been set to music in a spoken performance of Maeterlinck&#x27;s play in any case). Instead, Debussy set the text one note to a syllable in a &quot;continuous, fluid &#x27;&#x27;, somewhere between chant and recitative&quot;.

===Debussy, Wagner and French tradition===

 reveals Debussy&#x27;s deeply ambivalent attitude to the works of the German composer Richard Wagner. As Donald Grout writes: &quot;it is customary, and in the main correct, to regard as a monument to French operatic reaction to Wagner&quot;. Wagner had revolutionised 19th-century opera by his insistence on making his stage works more dramatic, by his increased use of the orchestra, his abolition of the traditional distinction between aria and recitative in favour of what he termed &quot;endless melody&quot;, and by his use of leitmotifs, recurring musical themes associated with characters or ideas. Wagner was a highly controversial figure in France. Despised by the conservative musical establishment, he was a cult figure in &quot;avant-garde&quot; circles, particularly among literary groups such as the Symbolists, who saw parallels between Wagner&#x27;s concept of the leitmotif and their use of the symbol. The young Debussy joined in this enthusiasm for Wagner&#x27;s music, making a pilgrimage to the Bayreuth Festival in 1888 to see &quot;Parsifal&quot; and and returning in 1889 to see . Yet that same year he confessed to his friend Ernest Guiraud his need to escape Wagner&#x27;s influence.

Debussy was well aware of the dangers of imitating Wagner too closely. Several French composers had tried to write their own Wagnerian music dramas, including Emmanuel Chabrier (&quot;Gwendoline&quot;) and Ernest Chausson (). Debussy was far from impressed by the results: &quot;We are bound to admit that nothing was ever more dreary than the neo-Wagnerian school in which the French genius had lost its way among the sham Wotans in Hessian boots and the Tristans in velvet jackets.&quot; Debussy strove to avoid excessive Wagnerian influence on from the start. The love scene was the first music he composed but he scrapped his early drafts for being too conventional and because &quot;worst of all, the ghost of old Klingsor, alias R.Wagner, kept appearing.&quot;

However, Debussy took several features from Wagner, including the use of leitmotifs, though these are &quot;rather the &#x27;idea-leitmotifs&#x27; of the more mature Wagner of than the &#x27;character-leitmotifs&#x27; of his earlier music-dramas.&quot; Debussy referred to what he felt were Wagner&#x27;s more obvious leitmotifs as a &quot;box of tricks&quot; () and claimed there was &quot;no guiding thread in &quot; as &quot;the characters are not subjected to the slavery of the leitmotif.&quot; Yet, as Debussy admitted privately, there are themes associated with each of the three main characters in .

The continuous use of the orchestra is another feature of Wagnerian music drama, yet the way Debussy writes for the orchestra is completely different from , for example. In Grout&#x27;s words, &quot;In most places the music is no more than an iridescent veil covering the text.&quot; The emphasis is on quietness, subtlety and allowing the words of the libretto to be heard. Debussy&#x27;s use of declamation is un-Wagnerian as he felt Wagnerian melody was unsuited to the French language. Instead, he stays close to the rhythms of natural speech, making part of a tradition which goes back to the French Baroque of Rameau and Lully as well as the experiments of the very founders of opera, Peri and Caccini.

Like the subject of is a love triangle set in a vaguely Medieval world. Unlike the protagonists of , the characters rarely seem to understand or be able to articulate their own feelings. The deliberate vagueness of the story is paralleled by the elusiveness of Debussy&#x27;s music.

==Subsequent opera projects==
&quot;Pelléas&quot; was to be Debussy&#x27;s only completed opera. For this reason it has sometimes been compared to Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;. As Hugh Macdonald writes: &quot;Both operas were much-loved only children of doting creators who put so much into their making that there could be no second child to follow after.&quot; This was not for want of trying on Debussy&#x27;s part, and he worked hard to create a successor. Details of several opera projects survive. The most substantial surviving musical sketches are for two works based on short stories by Edgar Allan Poe: &quot;Le diable dans le beffroi&quot; and &quot;La chute de la maison Usher&quot;.

Debussy also planned a version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot; with a libretto by Paul-Jean Toulet, but the poet&#x27;s opium addiction meant he was too lazy to write the text. Two other projects suggest Debussy intended to challenge German composers on their own ground. &quot;Orphée-Roi&quot; (&quot;King Orpheus&quot;) was to be a riposte to Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; which Debussy considered to &quot;treat only the anecdotal, lachrymose aspect of the subject&quot;. But, according to Victor Lederer, for &quot;shock value, neither [&quot;As You Like It&quot; nor &quot;Orphée&quot;] tops the Tristan project of 1907 [...] According to Léon Vallas, one of Debussy&#x27;s early biographers, its &#x27;episodic character... would have been related to the tales of chivalry, and diametrically opposed to the Germanic conception of Wagner.&#x27; That Debussy entertained, if only for a few weeks, the idea of writing an opera based on the Tristan legend is quite incredible. He knew Wagner&#x27;s colossal &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; as well as anyone, and his confidence must have been great indeed if he felt up to treating the subject.&quot; However, nothing came of any of these schemes, partly because the rectal cancer which afflicted Debussy from 1909 meant that he found it increasingly hard to concentrate on sustained creative work. &quot;Pelléas&quot; would remain a unique opera.

==Recordings==

The earliest recording of &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; is a 1904 Gramophone &amp; Typewriter disc recording of Mary Garden singing the passage &quot;Mes longs cheveux&quot;, with Debussy accompanying her on the piano. The first recording of extended excerpts from the opera was made by the Grand Orchestre Symphonique du Grammophone under conductor Piero Coppola in 1924 and remade with the electrical process for improved sound in 1927. The 1942 recording conducted by Roger Désormière, the first note-complete version, is considered a reference by most critics.

<text>The Masurians or Mazurs (; ; Masurian: &quot;Mazurÿ&quot;), historically also known as Prussian Masurians (Polish: &quot;Mazurzy pruscy&quot;), are an ethnic group originating from the region of Masuria, within the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, Poland. They number around 5,000–15,000 people. In the 2011 Polish census, 1,376 individuals declared themselves to be Masurian as either a first or a secondary identification. Before World War II and its post-war expulsions, Masurians used to be a more numerous ethnic group found in the southern parts of East Prussia for centuries following the 16th century Protestant Reformation. Today, most Masurians live in what is now Germany and elsewhere.

Masurians are mostly descendants of colonists from Mazovia, but many of them have their roots in Germany, Lithuania, France, Austria, Scotland, the Netherlands and Russia. Some research also indicate the admixture of the remains of the Old Prussians. These settlers moved to the Duchy of Prussia during and after the Protestant Reformation. They spoke the Masurian dialects. Since the mid-19th century, High German was increasingly used among Masurians as opposed to Low German used by most of East Prussia&#x27;s German population. Many Masurians were often bilingual in German and Polish languages. In the 19th century, the Masuria region of East Prussia was named after the Masurians.

Like most of the East Prussian population, they favored Protestantism and adopted Lutheranism in 1525 when Albert, Duke of Prussia secularized the duchy and converted. Roman Catholic Warmiaks and Masovians were not affected, as they inhabited parts that formally belonged to the Kingdom of Poland.

After World War II, many Masurians were classified as Germans and therefore mostly expelled along with them or emigrated after 1956 from what was now Poland to post-war Germany. Although most of them left for the West, some also ended up in East Germany. Conclusion of the war and ensuing resettlements saw an ethnic conflict between leaving Masurians and incoming Kurpie mainly on religious (Protestant–Catholic) grounds.

==History==
In the Middle Ages, the inhabitants of the Duchy of Masovia were called &quot;Mazur(z)y&quot; in Polish. Between the 14th and 17th centuries, Polish settlers from northern Masovia moved to the southern territories of the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights (these lands had previously belonged to the Baltic Old Prussians, whom the Teutonic Knights had conquered in the 13th and 14th centuries). The northern part of this state was soon settled by settlers from Germany and thus became Germanised. On the other hand, Protestants coming from the Duchy of Masovia, which was independent until 1526, partially Polonised a southern part of the Duchy of Prussia, later Kingdom of Prussia. Only in Allenstein, now Olsztyn, Catholics remained, because it belonged to the Prince-Bishopric of Ermland or Warmia.

Because of the influx of Masovians into the southern lakeland, the area started to be known as &quot;Masuria&quot; from the 18th century. During the Protestant Reformation, the Masurians, like most inhabitants of Ducal Prussia, became Lutheran Protestant, while the neighboring Masovians remained Roman Catholic. In 1525, the Duchy of Prussia, a Polish fief until 1657, was founded from the secularized order&#x27;s territory and became the first ever officially Protestant state. The small minority of Protestant Masovians in southern Catholic Masovia inside Poland emigrated later to Prussian Masuria. Masuria became part of the Kingdom of Prussia at the Kingdom&#x27;s founding in 1701, and part of the Prussian-led German Empire at the Empire&#x27;s founding in 1871.

Masurians referred to themselves in the 19th century as &quot;Polish Prussians&quot; or as &quot;Staroprusaki&quot; (Old Prussians).
Masurians showed considerable support for the Polish uprising in 1831, and maintained many contacts with Russian-held areas of Poland beyond the border of Prussia, the areas being connected by common culture and language; before the uprising people visited each other&#x27;s country fairs and much trade took place, with smuggling also widespread. Some early writers about Masurians – like Max Toeppen – postulated them as mediators between German and Slav cultures.

During the 1840s, the folklorist Gustaw Gizewiusz (Gustav Gisevius) collected Masurian folk songs which were later included in Oskar Kolberg&#x27;s compilation &quot;Dzieła Wszystkie&quot;.

===Masurians in the nineteenth century===

According to Andrzej Chwalba or Henryk Samsonowicz, Polish national activists and Masurians already were engaged in cooperation in 1848 when Poles from Pomerania supported Masurian attempts to elect their representative Gustaw Gizewiusz who defended the use of Polish language and traditions. For Piotr Wandycz the events of 1848 led to Polish national awakening in Masuria. 
By contrast, Andreas Kossert writes that Polish interest in Masuria was inspired by a single poem published in 1872, &quot;O Mazurach&quot; by Wojciech Kętrzyński and that the unsuccessful attempts to create a Polish national spirit in Masuria were financed by Polish Nationalists from Posen (Poznan), Lemberg (Lviv) and Warsaw.

Beginning in the 1870s, Imperial German officials restricted the usage of languages other than German in Prussia&#x27;s eastern provinces. The German authorities undertook several measures to Germanise the Masurians or to separate them culturally from neighboring Poles by creating a separate identity. After 1871 Masurians who expressed sympathy for Poland were deemed &quot;national traitors&quot; by German nationalists (this increased especially after 1918). According to Wojciech Wrzesinki, Masurians did not receive any assistance or help from Polish movements at the time. According to Stefan Berger, after 1871 the Masurians in the German Empire were seen in a view that while acknowledging their &quot;objective&quot; Polishness (in terms of culture and language) they felt &quot;subjectively&quot; German and thus should be tightly integrated into the German nation-state; to Berger this argument went directly against the German nationalist demands in Alsace where Alsacians were declared German despite their &quot;subjective&quot; choice. Berger concludes that such the arguments of German nationalists were simply aimed at gathering as much territory as possible into the German Reich.

===Masurians in the twentieth century===

Before World War I many Masurians emigrated to the Ruhr Area, especially to Gelsenkirchen. Here, Masurians were not distinguished apart from the Poles and both groups were seen as inferior to Germans, culturally or even racially. Despite those official efforts, German scholars usually considered Masurians as a group of Poles. In all German geographical atlases published at the beginning of the 20th century, the southern part of East Prussia was marked as an ethnically Polish area, with the number of Poles estimated at 300,000.

There was resistance among the Masurians towards Germanization efforts, the so-called Gromadki movement was formed which supported use of Polish language and came into conflict with German authorities; while most of its members viewed themselves as loyal to the Prussian state, some of them joined the Pro-Polish faction of Masurians. In general, popular resistance against linguistic Germanisation cannot be easily equated with anti-German sentiment or a strong attachment to the Polish national movement. Most of Masuria&#x27;s small Polish-speaking intelligentsia remained decisively pro-Prussian, often adhering to an older, multi-ethnic model of Prussian identity, centred on loyalty to their king, not so much on the German language. This ethnically, but not nationally Polish identity was a repeated source of consternation for Polish national activists, and decidedly pro-Polish political parties and press never gained widespread influence among the general populace. Richard Blanke summarised this long-standing attachment, going back to the late Middle Ages, as &quot;Masurians became Prussian, in other words, before the Bretons (not to mention the Alsatians) became French.&quot;

The Masurians evinced strong support for Germany during World War I. In 1920, the League of Nations supervised the East Prussian plebiscite – with British, French and Italian troops stationed in Masuria – to determine the new border between the Second Polish Republic and German East Prussia. The plebiscite was organized by the local German authorities. Polish ethnographer Adam Chętnik stated that the German authorities performed abuses and falsifications during the plebiscite, and Stefan Berger writes that the Masurians were subjected to huge psychological pressure and physical violence by German side to vote for Germany. Kossert admits irregularities during the referendum, but asserts that in general, its results truthfully reflected the overwhelmingly pro-German sentiment in southern East Prussia. In Masuria proper the vast majority (99.32%) opted to remain in Prussia. Attempts to create schools teaching Polish in interwar Germany were met with terror and violence.

The time of the liberal Weimar republic saw a strong trend of conversion from the Polish language to the German language among the Masurians.

Support for the Nazi Party was high in Masuria, especially in elections in 1932 and 1933. Nazis used the Masurian dialect for their political rallies during the campaigning. The government of Nazi Germany changed the names of several Masurian towns and villages from their original Slavic or Baltic Prussian names to new German names in 1938. During World War II the Nazis persecuted and killed Polish speakers in Masuria and imprisoned Polish teachers as well as children who learned Polish. The Nazis believed that in future, the Masurians as a separate non-German entity would disappear, while those who would cling to their &quot;foreignness&quot;, as one Nazi report mentioned, would be deported. Poles and Jews were considered by Nazis to be &quot;untermenschen&quot;, subject to slavery and extermination, and Nazi authorities murdered Polish activists in Masuria. Those who were not killed were arrested and sent to concentration camps.

In 1943, &quot;Związek Mazurski&quot; was reactivated secretly by Masurian activists of the Polish Underground State in Warsaw and led by Karol Małłek. Związek Mazurski opposed Nazi Germany and asked Polish authorities during the war to liquidate German property after victory over Nazi Germany to help in agricultural reform and settlement of Masurian population, Masurians opposed to Nazi Germany requested to remove German heritage sites &quot;regardless of their cultural value&quot;. Additionally a Masurian Institute was founded by Masurian activists in Radość near Warsaw in 1943. Andreas Kossert regards these claims as a presumption completely disregarding the actual conditions of the Masurian people.

Along with the majority of ethnic German East Prussians, many Masurians fled to western Germany as the Soviet Red Army approached East Prussia in 1945 in the final European campaigns of World War II. The post-war Potsdam Conference placed Masuria – and the rest of southern East Prussia – under Polish administration. Many Masurians who were classified as Germans were expelled with military force. After 1956, many who had remained in Poland emigrated to West Germany. As of 2003, approximately 5,000 Masurians still lived in the area, many of them as members of the German minority. Speculations about the reasons of this emigration vary, from the economic situation and the undemocratic – communist – system in Poland to the shrinking prospect of a return of Masuria to Germany.

&quot;Mazur&quot; remains the 14th most common surname in Poland, with almost 67,000 people bearing the name. According to ethnographer Adam Chętnik, the Masurians were most closely related to the Kurpie branch of the Poles. A group of Masurians migrated south and became one of the main components of the Lasowiacy, who live in the northern part of the Subcarpathian Voivodeship.

<doc id="354436" wikidata="Q15849" url="?curid=354436" title="José Manuel Barroso">
<text>José Manuel Durão Barroso (; born 23 March 1956) is a Portuguese politician and law professor. He previously served from 2002 to 2004 as the 114th prime minister of Portugal and from 2004–2014 as the 11th president of the European Commission.

He has been one of the revolving door cases at the EU, which received the most media attention because only two months after the cooling off period, Barroso accepted a position as &quot;senior adviser&quot; and &quot;non-executive chairman&quot; of Goldman Sachs International and became subject of an ethics inquiry.

==Early life and education==

José Barroso was born in Lisbon to Luís António Saraiva Barroso and his wife Maria Elisabete de Freitas Durão.

Durão Barroso (as he is known in Portugal) graduated from the Faculty of Law of the University of Lisbon. He subsequently obtained a Diploma in European Studies from the European University Institute, and received a MA degree with honours in both Political Science and Social Sciences from the University of Geneva in Switzerland.

Barroso became politically active in his late teens, during the Estado Novo regime in Portugal, before the Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974. In his university days, he was one of the leaders of the underground Maoist MRPP (Re-Organized Movement of the Proletariat Party, later Portuguese Workers&#x27; Communist Party (PCTP/MRPP), Communist Party of the Portuguese Workers/Revolutionary Movement of the Portuguese Proletariat). In an interview with the newspaper &quot;Expresso&quot;, he said that he had joined MRPP to fight the only other student body movement, also underground, which was controlled by the Portuguese Communist Party. Despite this justification, there is a very famous political 1976 interview recorded by the Portuguese state-run television channel, RTP, in which Barroso, as a politically minded student during the post-Carnation Revolution turmoil known as PREC, criticises the bourgeois education system which &quot;throws students against workers and workers against students.&quot;

==Career==
His academic career began as an assistant professor in the Faculty of Law of the University of Lisbon. Barroso did PhD research at Georgetown University and Georgetown&#x27;s Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service in Washington, D.C., but his CV does not list any doctoral degree (except honorary). Back in Lisbon, Barroso became director of the Department for International Relations at Lusíada University (Universidade Lusíada).

In December 1980, Barroso joined the right-of-centre PPD (Democratic Popular Party, later PPD/PSD-Social Democratic Party), where he remains to the present day.

In 1985, under the PSD government of Aníbal Cavaco Silva, prime minister of Portugal, Barroso was named Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Home Affairs. In 1987 he became a member of the same government as he was elevated to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (answering to the Minister of Foreign Affairs), a post he was to hold for the next five years. In this capacity, he was the driving force behind the Bicesse Accords of 1990, which led to a temporary armistice in the Angolan Civil War between the ruling MPLA and the opposition UNITA. He also supported independence for East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, then a province of Indonesia by force. In 1992, Barroso was promoted to the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs, and served in this capacity until the defeat of the PSD in the 1995 general election.

===Prime minister of Portugal, 2002–2004===
In 1995, while in opposition, Barroso was elected to the Assembly of the Republic as a representative for Lisbon. He became chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1998 he graduated from the Georgetown Leadership Seminar. In 1999 he was elected president of the PSD, succeeding Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa (a professor of law), and thus became Leader of the Opposition. Parliamentary elections in 2002 gave the PSD enough seats to form a coalition government with the right-wing Portuguese People&#x27;s Party, and Barroso subsequently became Prime Minister of Portugal on 6 April 2002.

As prime minister, facing a growing budget deficit, he made a number of difficult decisions and adopted strict reforms. He vowed to reduce public expenditure, which made him unpopular among leftists and public servants. His purpose was to lower the public budget deficit to a 3% target (according to the demands of EU rules), and official data during the 2002–2004 period stated that the target was being attained.
In March 2003, Barroso hosted U.S President George W. Bush, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar in the Portuguese island of Terceira, in the Azores. The four leaders finalised the controversial US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq. Under Barroso&#x27;s leadership, Portugal became part of the &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; for the invasion and occupation of Iraq, sending non-combat troops. On 30 January 2003, Barroso signed &quot;The letter of the eight&quot; supporting US. policy on Iraq.
Barroso did not finish his term as he had been nominated as president of the European Commission on 5 July 2004. Barroso arranged with Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio to nominate Pedro Santana Lopes as a substitute prime minister of Portugal. Santana Lopes led the PSD/PP coalition for a few months until early 2005, when new elections were called. When the Portuguese Socialist Party won the elections it produced an estimation that by the end of the year the budget deficit would reach 6.1%, which it used to criticise Barroso&#x27;s and Santana Lopes&#x27;s economic policies.

===President of the European Commission, 2004–2014===


 


In 2004, the proposed European Constitution and now the Treaty of Lisbon included a provision that the choice of the president must take into account the result of Parliamentary elections and the candidate supported by the victorious European political party in particular. That provision was not in force in the nomination in 2004, but the centre-right European People&#x27;s Party (EPP), who won the elections, pressured for a candidate from its own ranks. In the end, Barroso, as EPP candidate, was chosen by the European Council.
During his first presidency, the following issues were on the Commission&#x27;s agenda: Turkey applying for EU membership, the reform of the institutions (Treaty of Lisbon), the Bolkestein directive, aimed at creating a single market for services within the EU, Lisbon Strategy, Galileo positioning system, Doha Development Agenda negotiations, European Institute of Innovation and Technology and an EU climate change package.

The EPP again endorsed Barroso for a second term during the 2009 European election campaign and, after the EPP again won the elections, was able to secure his nomination by the European Council on 17 June 2009. On 3 September 2009, Barroso unveiled his manifesto for his second term. On 16 September 2009, Barroso was re-elected by the European Parliament for another five years. Since he completed his second term he became only the second Commission president to serve two terms, after Jacques Delors. That Commission&#x27;s term of office ran until 31 October 2014.

Barroso visited Ireland to persuade Irish citizens to approve the Treaty of Lisbon in the country&#x27;s second referendum due to be held the following month. Barroso was greeted by Irish Minister for Defence Willie O&#x27;Dea and Peter Power, the Minister of State for Overseas Development, as he got off his plane at Shannon Airport on the morning of 19 September 2009 before briefly meeting with the joint committee of the Oireachtas and meeting and greeting people at functions in Limerick&#x27;s City Hall, University of Limerick (UL) and the Savoy Hotel. He told &quot;The Irish Times&quot; in an interview referenced internationally by Reuters that he had been asked if Ireland would split from the European Union. He also launched a €14.8 million grant for former workers at Dell&#x27;s Limerick plant, described as &quot;conveniently opportune&quot; by former Member of the European Parliament and anti-Lisbonite Patricia McKenna.

On 12 September 2012, Barroso called for the EU to evolve into a &quot;federation of nation-states&quot;, necessary to combat the continent&#x27;s economic crisis. He said he believed Greece would be able to stay in the eurozone if it stood by its commitments. Barroso also heralded the legislative proposal published the same day for European Banking Supervision.
He was once appointed Acting Commissioner for Inter-Institutional Relations and Administration in Maroš Šefčovič&#x27;s stead, from 19 April 2014 – 25 May 2014 while he was on electoral campaign leave for the 2014 elections to the European Parliament. He ultimately decided to not take up his seat.

===Controversies===
In 2005, &quot;Die Welt&quot; reported that Barroso had spent a week on the yacht of the Greek shipping billionaire Spiro Latsis. It emerged soon afterward that this had occurred only a month before the Commission approved 10  million euros of Greek state aid for Latsis&#x27;s shipping company – though the state aid decision had been taken by the previous European Commission before Barroso took up his post. In response to this revelation, Nigel Farage MEP of the UK Independence Party persuaded around 75 MEPs from across the political spectrum to back a motion of no confidence in Barroso, so as to compel him to appear before the European Parliament to be questioned on the matter. The motion was tabled on 12 May 2005, and Barroso appeared before Parliament as required at a debate on 26 May 2005. The motion itself was heavily defeated.

In response to criticism for his choice of a less fuel efficient Volkswagen Touareg, amid EU legislation of targets drastically to reduce car emissions, Barroso dismissed this as &quot;overzealous moralism&quot;.

In April 2008, amid sharp food price rises and mounting food vs fuel concerns, Barroso insisted that biofuel use was &quot;not significant&quot; in pushing up food prices. The following month, he announced a study that would look into the issue. The backdoor approval of the GE potato, by President Barroso, has met a wave of strong opposition from EU member-states. The governments of Greece, Austria, Luxembourg, Italy, Hungary and France have all publicly announced that they will not allow the GE potato to be grown in their countries.

Barroso has expressed criticism of national governments arguing &quot;Decisions taken by the most democratic institutions in the world are very often wrong.&quot;

In December 2013 Barroso said that Europe was not the cause of the problems for Ireland; Ireland caused a problem for Europe. Following the bailout exit, in December 2013, the Irish government&#x27;s bid to get backdated funding for the banking sector was rejected as the head of the European Commission blamed the Irish banks, regulators, and government for the difficulties in the country. Barroso said the problems in the Irish banks caused a &quot;major destabilisation&quot; in the euro, rather than structural problems with the currency itself, &quot;I am saying this because it would be wrong to give the impression that Europe has created a problem for Ireland and now Europe has to help Ireland. In fact, it was the banking sector in Ireland—it was one of the biggest problems in the world in terms of banking stability what happened in Ireland.&quot;

===Post Brussels, 2015-present===
Barroso is a policy fellow at the Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination at Princeton University and the Frederick H. Schultz Class of 1951 Visiting Professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton&#x27;s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs Woodrow Wilson School, where he teaches with Wolfgang F. Danspeckgruber on the EU in International Affairs.

Barroso has been a professor at Portuguese Catholic University since 2015. He has taught at the Institute of Political Studies, at the Catholic Global School of Law, and at the Catholic Lisbon School of Business and Economics, and directs the Center for European Studies from the same institution. In February 2015, he was appointed visiting professor at the University of Geneva and taught at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies.

In July 2016, Barroso became senior adviser and non-executive chairman and senior adviser of London-based Goldman Sachs International (GSI), the bank&#x27;s largest subsidiary. At the time of his appointments, this was regarded as quite controversial, and later led Barroso&#x27;s successor Jean-Claude Juncker to launch an ethics investigation. Barroso was heavily criticised for taking the position only two months after the 18-month &quot;cooling-off&quot; period for EU officials after they leave their posts. Barroso&#x27;s move was especially sensitive because Goldman Sachs played a questionable role in the 2007–2008 financial crisis that nearly broke the euro. Furthermore, Barroso announced his move to the London-based subsidiary of Goldman Sachs shortly after the Brexit referendum. The European Commission agreed to an unprecedented ethics inquiry into the move. The independent panel concluded there were &quot;not sufficient grounds to establish a violation of the duty of integrity and discretion&quot; and accepted Barroso&#x27;s assurances that he would not be lobbying on behalf of the bank&#x27;s clients.

In 2020, Barroso was selected as chair of the board at GAVI, succeeding Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.

In addition, Barroso has held several paid and unpaid positions, including:
* International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity (led by Gordon Brown), Member (since 2015)
* Bilderberg Meetings, Member of the Steering Committee (since 2014)
* Chatham House, Member of the Panel of Senior Advisers
* European Business Summit (EBS), Honorary Chairman of the Honorary Committee (since 2014)
* Europaeum, Member of the Board of Trustees (since 2014)
* European Movement International, Member of the Honorary Council
* Kofi Annan Foundation, Member of the Electoral Integrity Initiative (EII) (since 2016)
* Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, Member of the Honorary Senate
* Women Political Leaders Global Forum (WPL), Member of the Global Advisory Board
* Sunhak Peace Prize Selection Committee, chair.
* UEFA Foundation for Children, Member of the Board of Trustees (2014–2017)

==Personal life==
In 1980, he married Maria Margarida Pinto Ribeiro de Sousa Uva, with whom he has three sons. Sousa Uva died from uterine cancer in August 2016, at the age of 60.

Apart from Portuguese, Barroso is fluent in French, speaks Spanish and English and has taken a course to acquire a basic knowledge of German.

<doc id="354439" wikidata="Q723776" url="?curid=354439" title="Orfeo ed Euridice">
<text>&#x27; (; French: &quot;&quot;&#x27;; English: &quot;Orpheus and Eurydice&quot;) is an opera composed by Christoph Willibald Gluck, based on the myth of Orpheus and set to a libretto by Ranieri de&#x27; Calzabigi. It belongs to the genre of the &quot;azione teatrale&quot;, meaning an opera on a mythological subject with choruses and dancing. The piece was first performed at the Burgtheater in Vienna on 5 October 1762, in the presence of Empress Maria Theresa. &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; is the first of Gluck&#x27;s &quot;reform&quot; operas, in which he attempted to replace the abstruse plots and overly complex music of &quot;opera seria&quot; with a &quot;noble simplicity&quot; in both the music and the drama.

The opera is the most popular of Gluck&#x27;s works, and was one of the most influential on subsequent German operas. Variations on its plot—the underground rescue mission in which the hero must control, or conceal, his emotions—can be found in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;, and Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;.

Though originally set to an Italian libretto, &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; owes much to the genre of French opera, particularly in its use of accompanied recitative and a general absence of vocal virtuosity. Indeed, twelve years after the 1762 premiere, Gluck re-adapted the opera to suit the tastes of a Parisian audience at the Académie Royale de Musique with a libretto by Pierre-Louis Moline. This reworking was given the title &quot;Orphée et Eurydice&quot;, and several alterations were made in vocal casting and orchestration to suit French tastes.

==Background==

Francesco Algarotti&#x27;s &quot;Essay on the Opera&quot; (1755) was a major influence in the development of Gluck&#x27;s reformist ideology. Algarotti proposed a heavily simplified model of &quot;opera seria&quot;, with the drama pre-eminent, instead of the music or ballet or staging. The drama itself should &quot;delight the eyes and ears, to rouse up and to affect the hearts of an audience, without the risk of sinning against reason or common sense&quot;. Algarotti&#x27;s ideas influenced both Gluck and his librettist, Calzabigi. Calzabigi was himself a prominent advocate of reform, and he stated, &quot;If Mr Gluck was the creator of dramatic music, he did not create it from nothing. I provided him with the material or the chaos, if you like. We therefore share the honour of that creation.&quot;

Other influences included the composer Niccolò Jommelli and his &quot;maître de ballet&quot; at Stuttgart, Jean-Georges Noverre. Noverre&#x27;s &quot;Lettres sur la danse&quot; (1760) called for dramatic effect over acrobatic ostentation; Noverre was himself influenced by the operas of Rameau and the acting style of David Garrick. The considerable quantity of ballet in &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; is thought to be due to his influence. Jommelli himself was noted for his blending of all aspects of the production: ballet, staging, and audience.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
&quot;The first lines of arias, choruses, etc., are given in Italian (1762 version) and French (1774 version).&quot;
===Act 1===
A chorus of nymphs and shepherds join Orfeo around the tomb of his wife Euridice in a solemn chorus of mourning; Orfeo is only able to utter Euridice&#x27;s name (Chorus and Orfeo: &quot;Ah, se intorno&quot;/&quot;Ah! Dans ce bois&quot;). Orfeo sends the others away and sings of his grief in the aria &quot;Chiamo il mio ben&quot;/&quot;Objet de mon amour&quot;, the three verses of which are preceded by expressive recitatives. This technique was extremely radical at the time and indeed proved overly so for those who came after Gluck: Mozart chose to retain the unity of the aria. Amore (Cupid) appears, telling Orfeo that he may go to the Underworld and return with his wife on the condition that he not look at her until they are back on earth (1774 only: aria by Amour, &quot;Si les doux accords&quot;). As encouragement, Amore informs Orfeo that his present suffering shall be short-lived with the aria &quot;Gli sguardi trattieni&quot;/&quot;Soumis au silence&quot;. Orfeo resolves to take on the quest. In the 1774 version only he delivers an ariette (&quot;L&#x27;espoir renaît dans mon âme&quot;) in the older, showier, Italian style, originally composed for an occasional entertainment, &quot;Il Parnaso confuso&quot; (1765), and subsequently re-used in another one, &quot;Le feste d&#x27;Apollo&quot; (1769).

===Act 2===
In a rocky landscape, the Furies refuse to admit Orfeo to the Underworld, and sing of Cerberus, its canine guardian (&quot;Chi mai dell’Erebo&quot;/&quot;Quel est l&#x27;audacieux&quot;). When Orfeo, accompanied by his lyre (represented in the opera by a harp), begs for pity in the aria &quot;Deh placatevi con me&quot;/&quot;Laissez-vous toucher&quot;, he is at first interrupted by cries of &quot;No!&quot;/&quot;Non!&quot; from the Furies, but they are eventually softened by the sweetness of his singing in the arias &quot;Mille pene&quot;/&quot;Ah! La flamme&quot; and &quot;Men tiranne&quot;/&quot;La tendresse&quot;, and let him in (&quot;Ah, quale incognito affetto&quot;/&quot;Quels chants doux&quot;). In the 1774 version, the scene ends with the &quot;Dance of the Furies&quot; (No. 28).

The second scene opens in Elysium. The brief ballet of 1762 became the four-movement &quot;Dance of the Blessed Spirits&quot; (with a prominent part for solo flute) in 1774. This is followed (1774 only) by a solo which celebrates happiness in eternal bliss (&quot;Cet asile&quot;), sung by either an unnamed Spirit or Euridice, and repeated by the chorus. Orfeo arrives and marvels at the purity of the air in an arioso (&quot;Che puro ciel&quot;/&quot;Quel nouveau ciel&quot;). But he finds no solace in the beauty of the surroundings, for Euridice is not yet with him. He implores the spirits to bring her to him, which they do (Chorus: &quot;Torna, o bella&quot;/&quot;Près du tendre objet&quot;).

===Act 3===

On the way out of Hades, Euridice is delighted to be returning to earth, but Orfeo, remembering the condition related by Amore in act 1, lets go of her hand and refusing to look at her, does not explain anything to her. She does not understand his action and reproaches him, but he must suffer in silence (Duet: &quot;Vieni, appaga il tuo consorte&quot;/&quot;Viens, suis un époux&quot;). Euridice takes this to be a sign that he no longer loves her, and refuses to continue, concluding that death would be preferable. She sings of her grief at Orfeo&#x27;s supposed infidelity in the aria &quot;Che fiero momento&quot;/&quot;Fortune ennemie&quot; (in 1774, there is a brief duet before the reprise). Unable to take any more, Orfeo turns and looks at Euridice; again, she dies. Orfeo sings of his grief in the famous aria &quot;Che farò senza Euridice?&quot;/&quot;J’ai perdu mon Eurydice&quot; (&quot;What shall I do without Euridice?&quot;/&quot;I have lost my Euridice&quot;) Orfeo decides he will kill himself to join Euridice in Hades, but Amore returns to stop him (1774 only: Trio: &quot;Tendre Amour&quot;). In reward for Orfeo&#x27;s continued love, Amore returns Euridice to life, and she and Orfeo are reunited. After a four-movement ballet, all sing in praise of Amore (&quot;Trionfi Amore&quot;). In the 1774 version, the chorus (&quot;L’Amour triomphe&quot;) precedes the ballet, to which Gluck had added three extra movements.

==Performance history==

The opera was first performed in Vienna at the Burgtheater on 5 October 1762, for the name day celebrations of the Emperor Francis I. The production was supervised by the reformist theatre administrator, Count Giacomo Durazzo. Choreography was by Gasparo Angiolini, and set designs were by Giovanni Maria Quaglio the Elder, both leading members of their fields. The first Orfeo was the famous castrato Gaetano Guadagni. &quot;Orfeo&quot; was revived in Vienna during the following year, but then not performed until 1769. For the performances that took place in London in 1770, Guadagni sang the role of Orpheus, but little of the music bore any relation to Gluck&#x27;s original, with J. C. Bach – &quot;the English Bach&quot; – providing most of the new music. Haydn conducted a performance of the Italian version at Eszterháza in 1776.

During the early 19th century, Adolphe Nourrit became particularly well known for his performances of Orpheus at the Paris Opera. In 1854 Franz Liszt conducted the work at Weimar, composing a symphonic poem of his own to replace Gluck&#x27;s original overture. Typically during the 19th century and for most of the 20th century, the role of &quot;Orfeo&quot; was sung by a female contralto, and noted interpreters of the role from this time include Dame Clara Butt and Kathleen Ferrier, and the mezzo-sopranos Rita Gorr, Marilyn Horne, Dame Janet Baker, Susanne Marsee, and Risë Stevens (at the Metropolitan Opera). Among conductors, Arturo Toscanini was a notable proponent of the opera. His November 1952 radio broadcast of act 2 was eventually released on LP and CD.

In 2017 the Lyric Opera of Chicago presented a new production by choreographer John Neumeier which fuses the musical and ballet elements of the opera and features the Joffrey Ballet. The production uses the 1774 &quot;Paris version&quot; (albeit with a rearranged finale), with the part of Orfeo being sung by a tenor. The main characters are presented in a modern setting with Orfeo as a choreographer, Euridice as his principal dancer, and Amour as his assistant. The same production was staged by the Los Angeles Opera in 2018 and by the Staatsoper Hamburg and the Festspielhaus Baden-Baden in 2019.

==Revised versions==
===1769 Parma version===
In 1769 for &quot;Le feste d&#x27;Apollo&quot; at Parma which was conducted by the composer, Gluck transposed part of the role of Orfeo up for the soprano castrato Giuseppe Millico, maintaining a libretto in Italian. After not having been performed for a very long time, this version was finally given its first modern revival on 13 November 2014 at the &quot;&quot; in Herne, with a countertenor in the title role.

===Gluck&#x27;s 1774 Paris Opera version===
Gluck revised the score again for a production by the Paris Opera premiering on 2 August 1774 at the second Salle du Palais-Royal. Renamed &quot;Orphée et Eurydice&quot;, this version had a French libretto by Pierre-Louis Moline, which expanded as well as translated Calzabigi&#x27;s original. Gluck composed additional music and made other adjustments such as shifting Orpheus down to a high tenor, or &quot;haute-contre&quot;, from castrato, to suit the convention in French opera for heroic characters (the French almost never used castratos). The opera now had more ballet sequences, conforming to Paris taste, including the long &quot;Dance of the Furies&quot; originally written for Gluck&#x27;s ballet &quot;Don Juan&quot; and the &quot;Dance of the Blessed Spirits&quot; for flute and strings. (By 1825 operatic castrati themselves had virtually vanished, and performances of the original version for castrato became increasingly rare. The modern practice of approximating castrati by using countertenors as replacements dates back only to 1950.)

===Berlioz&#x27;s 1859 version for mezzo-soprano===
From 1784 to 1859 the Parisian &quot;&quot; (concert pitch) rose steadily from 820 to 896 cycles per second, thus Gluck&#x27;s French version for &quot;haute-contre&quot; became increasingly impractical. When Adolphe Nourrit sang the role at the Opéra in 1824 his music was altered. Giacomo Meyerbeer suggested to the French mezzo-soprano Pauline Viardot that she should perform the role of Orfeo. The composer Hector Berlioz was a close friend of Viardot and the leading expert in France on the music of Gluck. He knew the score of &quot;the largely forgotten Italian original as thoroughly as he knew the French&quot;, and agreed to prepare a version of the opera – in four acts – with Viardot&#x27;s voice in mind: thus, he did not simply &quot;return to the original contralto version, but rearranged and retransposed the Paris version into keys more suitable for a mezzo&quot;. In his adaptation, Berlioz used the key scheme of the 1762 Vienna score while incorporating much of the additional music of the 1774 Paris score. He returned to the Italian version only when he considered it to be superior either in terms of music or in terms of the drama. He also restored some of the more subtle orchestration from the Italian version and resisted proposals by Viardot and the theatre&#x27;s director Léon Carvalho to modernize the orchestration. In the end Camille Saint-Saëns, who was acting as Berlioz&#x27;s assistant on the project, did some of the minor rewriting which Berlioz had declined to do.

The Berlioz version was first presented at the Théâtre Lyrique on 18 November 1859 with Viardot as Orphée, Marie Sasse as Eurydice, Marie Ernestine Marimon as L&#x27;Amour, Mlle Moreau as L&#x27;Ombre, and Adolphe Deloffre as the conductor. The sets were designed by Charles-Antoine Cambon and Joseph Thierry, and the choreography was by Lucien Petipa. (The seventeen-year-old Jules Massenet was the orchestra&#x27;s timpanist. During the rehearsals Berlioz had complimented the young player on the accuracy of his tuning.) The production was a popular and critical success, filling the house every night, and was given a total of 138 times by the company.
===Subsequent versions===
By 1860 most theaters in Paris had lowered concert pitch to &quot;diapason normal&quot;. This was not as low as in Gluck&#x27;s time: &quot;a Commission had lately recommended that the pitch in France should be lowered from an A of 896 to 870 vibrations.&quot; Still this was apparently enough that later in the 19th century the role of Orpheus came to be sung almost as frequently by a tenor as by a contralto.

Berlioz&#x27;s version is one of many which combine the Italian and French scores, although it is the most influential and well regarded. Since about 1870 three-act adaptations of the Berlioz score, translating it back into Italian and restoring much of the music from the 1774 French version which Berlioz had left out, were common. An 1889 edition for contralto, published by Ricordi, became the most popular. On occasion the role of Orfeo has even been transposed down an octave for a baritone to sing. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Hermann Prey are two notable baritones who have performed the role in Germany. Fischer-Dieskau recorded the opera several times; his recordings are still available commercially.

==&quot;Orfeo&quot; and the reform==
The opera was the first by Gluck showing signs of his ambition to reform &quot;opera seria&quot;. Self-contained arias and choruses make way for shorter pieces strung together to make larger structural units. Da capo arias are notable by their absence; Gluck instead uses strophic form, notably in act one&#x27;s &quot;Chiamo il mio ben così&quot;, where each verse is interposed with dramatic recitative, – that is, &quot;stromentato&quot;, where the voice is accompanied by part or all of the orchestra – and rondo form, such as in act three&#x27;s famous &quot;Che farò senza Euridice?&quot;. Also absent is traditional &quot;secco&quot; recitative, where the voice is accompanied only by the basso continuo. On the whole, old Italian operatic conventions are disregarded in favour of giving the action dramatic impetus. The complexity of the storyline is greatly reduced by eliminating subplots. Gluck was influenced by the example of French &quot;tragédies en musique&quot;, particularly those of Rameau. Like them, the opera contains a large number of expressive dances, extensive use of the chorus and accompanied recitative. The &quot;coup de théâtre&quot; of opening the drama with a chorus mourning one of the main characters is very similar to that used in Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Castor et Pollux&quot; (1737). Other elements do not follow Gluck&#x27;s subsequent reforms; for instance, the brisk, cheerful overture does not reflect the action to come. The role of Orfeo calls for an especially gifted actor, so that the strophic &quot;Chiamo il mio ben così&quot; does not become dull, and so that tragic import can be given both to this aria and to &quot;Che farò senza Euridice?&quot;, both of which are based on harmonies that are not obviously mournful in nature. The first Orfeo, Gaetano Guadagni, was reputedly a fine actor who had certainly taken lessons while in London from the Shakespearian actor David Garrick. Guadagni was apparently also able to project a moving and emotive tone without raising his voice. Indeed, Gluck faced criticism of &quot;Che farò senza Euridice?&quot; on the grounds that it was emotionally uninvolved; he responded by pointing out the absolute necessity of fine execution of the aria: &quot;make the slightest change, either in the movement or in the turn of expression, and it will become a saltarello for marionettes&quot;.

Gluck&#x27;s reforms, which began with &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;, have had significant influence throughout operatic history. Gluck&#x27;s ideals heavily influenced the popular works of Mozart, Wagner, and Weber, with Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot; vision especially influenced by that of Gluck. Old-style &quot;opera seria&quot; and the domination of embellishment-orientated singers came to be increasingly unpopular after the success of Gluck&#x27;s operas as a whole and &quot;Orfeo&quot; in particular. In &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; the orchestra is far more predominant than in earlier opera, most notably in Orfeo&#x27;s &quot;arioso&quot; &quot;Che puro ciel&quot;. Here the voice is reduced to the comparatively minor role of recitative-style declamation, while the oboe carries the main melody, supported by solos from the flute, cello, bassoon, and horn. There is also accompaniment from the strings (playing in triplets) and the continuo in the most complex orchestration that Gluck ever wrote.

==Orchestration==
Gluck made a number of changes to the orchestration of &quot;Orfeo&quot; when adapting it from the original Italian version to the French version of 1774. Cornetts and &quot;chalumeaux&quot; are replaced by more common and modern oboes and clarinets, while the part played by trombones considerably decreases, possibly due to a lack of technical ability on the part of the French trombonists. Cornetts were instruments that were typically used for church music, and &quot;chalumeaux&quot; were predominant only in chamber music: both cornetts and &quot;chalumeaux&quot; were unpopular in France in 1774. In many ways the change from &quot;chalumeau&quot; to oboe corresponds to that from castrato to high tenor. Neither castrato nor &quot;chalumeau&quot; were to survive.

In both the Italian and French version Orfeo&#x27;s lyre is represented by the harp, and it was this use of the instrument in 1774 that it is usually thought introduced the harp to French orchestras. Each verse of the strophic &quot;Chiamo il mio ben cosi&quot; is accompanied by different solo instruments. In Vienna these were flute, horns, and English horns, but in 1774 Gluck was required to change this orchestration to that of a single horn and two clarinets, again replacing uncommon instruments with those in far more widespread usage. During the aria &quot;Chiamo il mio ben cosi&quot; and the interspersing recitatives Gluck added another offstage orchestra consisting of strings and &quot;chalumeaux&quot;, in order to provide an echo effect.

==Scores and librettos==
For the original 1762 Italian version, &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice, azione teatrale&quot; in three acts, the libretto was published by van Ghelen (Vienna, 1762) and the full score by Duchesne (Paris, 1764). Many 18th-century manuscript copies of the full score may be found in libraries, including the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna, the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek in Vienna, the Bibliothèque Nationale (BNF) in Paris, the Bibliothèque-Musée de l&#x27;Opéra in Paris, and the British Library in London. A critical edition, edited by Anna Amalie Abert and Ludwig Finscher, was published in 1963 as part of Bärenreiter&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (&quot;Complete Works&quot;).

For the 1774 French version, &quot;Orphée et Eurydice, tragédie opéra&quot; in three acts, the libretto was published by Delormel (Paris, 1774) and the full score by Lemarchand (Paris, 1774). A critical edition, edited by musicologist Ludwig Finscher, was published in 1967 as part of Bärenreiter&#x27;s &quot;Sämtliche Werke&quot;. Substantial fragments of autograph scores are in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris and the Bibliothèque-Musée de l&#x27;Opéra in Paris.

==Recordings==

There have been numerous recordings of the different versions, especially of the Berlioz adaptation featuring a female Orfeo. The British contralto Kathleen Ferrier and American mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne were especially notable interpreters. In recent years, recordings and stage productions of the Vienna version of the opera have featured countertenors in the role of Orpheus. Countertenors Derek Lee Ragin, Jochen Kowalski, René Jacobs, James Bowman, and Michael Chance have recorded &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;. The role of Orfeo has also been performed and recorded by tenors and even baritones such as Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, who has made three recordings of the role. Until recent times, most recordings of all versions were cut or altered in some way.

Recordings of the French version for tenor are still relatively rare due to a lack of genuine &quot;haute-contres&quot;: there is one from the mid-1950s starring Léopold Simoneau opposite his wife Pierrette Alarie, and Nicolai Gedda also recorded the role in 1955. (Simoneau&#x27;s version has been available on CD, although not at present, but Gedda&#x27;s recording had its premiere CD release in 2009.) In 2002 haute-contre Jean-Paul Fouchécourt added his version, while Marc Minkowski brought out a period instrument performance with Richard Croft in the title role in 2004. In April 2010, a concert performance recorded in Madrid two years earlier by &quot;tenore di grazia&quot; Juan Diego Flórez, was finally released. There is also a DVD of the 1993 Australian Opera production, directed by Stefanos Lazaridis, with Australian &quot;haute-contre&quot; David Hobson as Orphée.

In 2018 Erato released a recording using the score as performed in Italian at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples in 1774. The theatre had adapted the score to include additions by Johann Christian Bach and variations for soprano coloratura. In this recording Philippe Jaroussky sings Orfeo and Amanda Forsythe is Euridice.

<text>Alceste, Wq. 37 (the later French version is Wq. 44), is an opera by Christoph Willibald Gluck from 1767. The Italian libretto was written by Ranieri de&#x27; Calzabigi and based on the play &quot;Alcestis&quot; by Euripides. The premiere took place on 26 December 1767 at the Burgtheater in Vienna.

==The famous preface==
When Gluck published the score of &quot;Alceste&quot; in Vienna in 1769, he added a famous preface in Italian almost certainly written by Calzabigi, which set out their ideals for operatic reform, whose programmatic points follow those exposed by Francesco Algarotti in his &quot;Saggio sopra l&#x27;opera in musica&quot; (&quot;Essay on opera in music&quot;, 1755), namely:
* no da capo arias,
* no opportunity for vocal improvisation or virtuosic displays of vocal agility or power,
* no long melismas,
* a more predominantly syllabic setting of the text to make the words more intelligible,
* far less repetition of text within an aria,
* a blurring of the distinction between recitative and aria, declamatory and lyrical passages, with altogether less recitative,
* accompanied rather than secco recitative,
* simpler, more flowing melodic lines,
* an overture that is linked by theme or mood to the ensuing action.

&quot;Alceste&quot; also has no role for the castrato voice, although Gluck would return to using a castrato in his next opera, &quot;Paride ed Elena&quot;, and even rewrite the tenor role of Admetus for the soprano castrato Giuseppe Millico, in the 1770 revival of &quot;Alceste&quot; in Vienna.

==Recomposition in 1776 for Paris==
Gluck recomposed and lengthened &quot;Alceste&quot; to a French libretto by François-Louis Gand Le Bland Du Roullet for performances at the Paris Opera, retaining the three-act structure. Hercules was added as a pivotal character in Act III, as was a scene at the Gates of Hell. The premiere took place on 23 April 1776 in the second Salle du Palais-Royal.

==Performance history==
With the presentations in Paris, &quot;Alceste&quot; became an essentially new work, the translation from Italian to French necessitating several changes in the musical declamation of text, and certain scenes significantly reorganized to new or altered music. Some of the changes were made upon the advice of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, one of Gluck&#x27;s greatest French admirers, but the bulk of the adaptation was the work of French aristocrat Du Roullet, with improvements by the composer.

Gluck fought several efforts to make the new version of &quot;Alceste&quot; conform to French tastes, resisting pressure to end the opera with an extended ballet. The new libretto does, however, introduce several subsidiary characters for dramatic variety, and, following the example of Euripides, on whose work the libretto is loosely based, even calls in Hercules in the final act.
 Berlioz made adjustments to the opera for a staging in 1861 that starred Pauline Viardot at the Paris Opéra. This was remounted, with further rearrangements, in 1866, starring Marie Battu.

The first British performance, which was sung in Italian, took place at the King&#x27;s Theatre, London on 30 April 1795, starring Brigida Banti. The work was given in French during the Coronation Season of 1937 at the Royal Opera House, conducted by Philippe Gaubert with Germaine Lubin as Alceste. More recent productions in Britain have included those at the Glyndebourne Festival conducted by Vittorio Gui, with Magda Laszlo (1953 and 1954) and Consuelo Rubio (1958) as Alceste; by Scottish Opera in 1974, conducted by Alexander Gibson with the title role shared between Júlia Várady and Ann Murray; and by the Royal Opera in 1981, conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras, with Janet Baker in the title role.

In 1954, Carlo Maria Giulini conducted &quot;Alceste&quot; at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, with Maria Callas in the title role. Though the Paris revision of the opera was performed (with a few additions from the original Vienna edition), the performances were sung in Italian. Subsequent productions there were conducted by Gianandrea Gavazzeni (1972) and Riccardo Muti (1987) with the title role sung by Leyla Gencer and Rosalind Plowright, respectively. In 2015 the opera was given for the first time by the Teatro La Fenice in Venice, directed by Pier Luigi Pizzi, in its unabridged Italian version, also including the parts that Gluck himself had cut at the Vienna premiere out of practical necessities.

The Metropolitan Opera gave &quot;Alceste&quot; in three different seasons, with four sopranos starring in eighteen performances. Its premiere on 24 January 1941, sung in French, featured Marjorie Lawrence. There were four more performances that season, two starring Lawrence and two Rose Bampton. In 1952 the opera was given in English, with Kirsten Flagstad in the title role. On 6 December 1960 Eileen Farrell made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Alceste, also in English. She sang the role eight times that season, and her last performance, on 11 February, remains the last time &quot;Alceste&quot; was seen at the Met.

Lyric Opera of Chicago opened its 1990 season with performances conducted by Gary Bertini with Jessye Norman as Alceste. Catherine Naglestad appeared in ten performances with the Stuttgart State Opera in 2006, and this production was filmed. &quot;Alceste&quot; was given by Santa Fe Opera in August 2009 with Christine Brewer in the title role. A production at the Teatro Real Madrid in 2014, conducted by Ivor Bolton, featured Angela Denoke as Alceste; the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, presented the work in 2019, conducted by Antonello Manacorda, with Dorothea Röschmann in the title role.

Nowadays the opera is usually given in the Paris version musically, with the libretto sometimes back-translated into Italian.

==Influence on Mozart==
In &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, written in 1787, twenty years after &quot;Alceste&quot; and the year Gluck died Mozart used a similar chord progression, as well as texture and orchestration, for the Commendatore speaking to Don Giovanni in the garden scene that Gluck used for the line of the High Priest when saying that Alceste will die if no one takes her place. Hector Berlioz claimed that this section of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; was &quot;heavily in-inspired or rather plagiarized&quot;. Berlioz discussed the authenticity of some of the arias. For example, when Gluck went to Vienna, an aria was added to act 3. Berlioz came to the conclusion that Gluck was under so much pressure that he let it happen. Berlioz notes Gluck added corrections during rehearsals, and misunderstandings in the score, due to what Berlioz calls Gluck&#x27;s &quot;happy-go-lucky&quot; style of writing.

==Roles==

==Synopsis==
Original version in Italian
:Place: Classical Pherae, Thessaly

===Act 1===
A herald announces to the people of Thessaly that King Admeto is gravely ill and that there is little hope. Evandro calls upon all to pray to the oracle at the temple of Apollo. Alceste joins them and asks Apollo for pity. The oracle says Admeto can be rescued if another voluntarily sacrifices his life. This causes great consternation. Alone, Alceste agonizes whether to give her life for that of her husband.

===Act 2===
In a dense forest dedicated to the gods of the underworld, Ismene asks Alceste why she is leaving her husband and children. Alceste tells Ismene of her intentions. Meanwhile, Admeto has a miraculous recovery to the joy of all Thessaly. Evandro tells him that someone has apparently sacrificed himself for the king. When Alceste appears, he questions her until she confesses. The desperate king hurries into the temple to plead with the gods. However, Alceste says good-bye to the children.

===Act 3===
The decision of the gods is not revoked. The people lament the approaching death of Alceste. Having said good-bye to Alceste, Admeto decides to follow her into death. Then the heavens open, Apollo descends and proclaims that the gods have given them their lives as a reward for their steadfast love.

==Synopsis, with French Version Edits ==
Paris version

The overture is stately, noble, and tragic, looking ahead to some of Mozart&#x27;s minor-key works. The choir propels much of the action in the first two acts, and Gluck&#x27;s vocal settings are particularly elegant, taking advantage of the French language&#x27;s smooth rhythms, although the writing is rather static in its sad dignity.

===Act 1===
King Admetus is dying, and his people are in despair. The god Apollo refuses their animal sacrifice, proclaiming that Admetus will live only if another person is sacrificed in his place. Queen Alceste believes she is the victim Apollo has in mind, but declares she will surrender her life only for love. (Aria: &quot;Divinites du Styx&quot;)

===Act 2===
The people celebrate the king&#x27;s recovery. Admetus does not realize that Alceste has volunteered to die in his place, and his wife won&#x27;t give herself up until the record is set straight. When he learns the truth, Admetus believes that Alceste is in effect abandoning him, and would prefer to die himself.

===Act 3===
The people, sorrowing again, prepare the royal couple&#x27;s children for sacrifice in their place. Admetus&#x27; friend Hercules arrives and promises to conquer death on his behalf, and travels to Hades. Meanwhile, Alceste has already arrived at the gates of hell; Admetus tries to dissuade her, but she is sacrificing herself for love, rather than as some heroic act. She dies, but Hercules rescues her—except that now Alceste seems nearly insane. Apollo arrives, promises Hercules immortality, and leaves Admetus and Alceste in a world that seems devoid of death. The work ends with a joyful chorus.

<doc id="354444" wikidata="Q1361941" url="?curid=354444" title="Armide (Lully)">
<text>Armide is an opera in five acts by Jean-Baptiste Lully. The libretto by Philippe Quinault is based on Torquato Tasso&#x27;s poem &quot;La Gerusalemme liberata&quot; (&quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot;). The work is in the form of a tragédie en musique, a genre invented by Lully and Quinault.

Critics in the 18th century regarded &quot;Armide&quot; as Lully&#x27;s masterpiece. It continues to be well-regarded, featuring some of the best-known music in French baroque opera and being arguably ahead of its time in its psychological interest. Unlike most of his operas, &quot;Armide&quot; concentrates on the sustained psychological development of a character – not Renaud, who spends most of the opera under Armide&#x27;s spell, but Armide, who repeatedly tries without success to choose vengeance over love.

==Performance history==
&quot;Armide&quot; was first performed on 15 February 1686 by the Paris Opera at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal, with scenery by Bérain, in the presence of the Grand Dauphin. The subject for the opera was chosen for Lully by King Louis XIV of France.
However, the king would not attend the première or any of the following performances, possibly because Lully was involved in a homosexual scandal. The opera was well received by the Parisians and was revived by the Paris Opera in 1703, 1713–14, 1724, 1746–47, 1761, and 1764. Between 1686 and 1751 &quot;Armide&quot; was mounted in Marseilles, Brussels, Lyon, Lunéville and perhaps Metz, and was also produced abroad in The Hague, Berlin (with revisions by Carl Heinrich Graun) and apparently, in two concert performances, in Rome.

On 5 November 2005, almost 320 years later, Opera Atelier of Toronto gave &quot;Armide&quot; its North American premiere under conductor Andrew Parrott and music director David Fallis.

==Synopsis==
During the First Crusade, Armide ensnares her enemy the Christian knight Renaud with her magic spells. At the moment she raises her dagger to kill him, she finds herself falling in love with him. She casts a spell to make him love her in return. Upon returning to her castle, she cannot bear that Renaud&#x27;s love is only the work of enchantment. She calls on the Goddess of Hate to restore her hatred for Renaud, but fails to escape from her feelings of love for him. The Goddess condemns Armide to eternal love. Before Armide can return to Renaud, two of his fellow soldiers reach Renaud and break Armide&#x27;s spell. Renaud manages to escape from Armide, who is left enraged, despairing, and hopeless.

==History and analysis==

Roughly eight decades following Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;, Jean-Baptiste Lully produced &quot;Armide&quot; with his longtime collaborator, playwright Jean-Philippe Quinault. Together they had developed the &quot;tragédie en musique,&quot; or &quot;tragédie lyrique,&quot; which served as a new form of opera that combined elements of classical French drama with ballet, the French song tradition, and a new form of recitative. &quot;Armide&quot; was one of Lully&#x27;s last operas and is therefore extremely developed in style.

The opera&#x27;s instrumental overture is divided into two parts, all with the same highly professional sound, as if to accompany the entrance of a highly revered authority. It is in fact, according to the &quot;Norton Anthology of Western Music,&quot; a &quot;majesty suitable to the king of France, whose entrance into the theater the overture usually accompanied when he was in attendance&quot;. At points it is playful and bouncy, while always remaining ceremonious. The first section of the overture is in duple meter and comparatively sounds slower than the second section, when the meter changes into compound. These two different styles switch off until the conclusion of the piece (in duple meter).

The most famous moment in the opera is Act II, scene 5, a monologue by the enchantress Armide, considered &quot;one of the most impressive recitatives in all of Lully&#x27;s operas&quot;. Armide, accompanied by only continuo, alternates between glorying in her own power and succumbing to piercing angst. Clutching a dagger, she expresses her unyielding desire to kill the knight Renaud, who has foiled her plan to keep the knights of the Crusades in captivity. Though not elaborate in terms of orchestration, the techniques of dramatic interpretation of rhythm, impressive use of stressing on downbeats, and exaggerated use of rests beautifully complicate this piece.

Renaud had taken on the heroic and courageous duty of freeing these knights, much to the vexation of Armide, who now plans to murder him as quickly and swiftly as she can, while he is fast asleep under her magical spell. A stark sense of hesitation washes over her, and her voice grows softer and more full of doubt as she finds herself unexpectedly falling in love with her sworn enemy. Her passion for revenge, to which she was originally so committed, gives way to her new-found love: &quot;Let us get on with it… I tremble! Let us avenge… I sigh! / My rage is extinguished when I approach him / He seems to be made for love.&quot; The exaggerated use of rests is exemplified perfectly here, in measures 38–42, amidst her rage and vengefulness. Armide is struck by her contradictory and confusing feelings of love, and the use of ellipses conveys this dramatic hesitation and inner turmoil.

She reaches a decision far more humane than murdering Renaud, by casting a further spell to make him fall in love with her. The bass amplifies and is much more emphatic in this part, while the supporting dynamic harmony permits a more melodic style. The idea is elaborated with accompanying music that evokes love and idealism, similar to the structure of a minuet. Repetition is also prevalent with the orchestra first introducing the entire melody, and Armide echoing its sentiment. A variation begins with Armide&#x27;s changing emotions, resulting in a dance-like feel that contains orchestral preludes and a pair of recitative styles.
==Film==
A segment in the 1987 anthology film &quot;Aria&quot; is based loosely on the plot of &quot;Armide&quot;. Directed by Jean-Luc Godard, it is set in a gym and uses a selection of music from Philippe Herreweghe&#x27;s first recording of the opera with Rachel Yakar in the title role. (&quot;Ah! Si la liberté...&quot;, &quot;Enfin, il est en ma puissance&quot;, &quot;Venez, venez, Haine implacable&quot;).

<doc id="354455" wikidata="Q156780" url="?curid=354455" title="Jorge Sampaio">
<text>Jorge Fernando Branco de Sampaio (; 18 September 1939 – 10 September 2021) was a Portuguese lawyer and politician who was the 18th President of Portugal from 1996 to 2006. Sampaio was a member of the Socialist Party, a party which he led between 1989 and 1992. He served as the Mayor of Lisbon from 1990 to 1995 and High-Representative for the United Nations&#x27; Alliance of Civilizations between 2007 and 2013.

Sampaio was an opponent to the dictatorship of Estado Novo. He participated in the student crisis in the 1960s and worked as a lawyer for political prisoners. During his presidency, Portugal relinquished its last colony, Macau, to China. Sampaio also played an important role in the 1999 East Timorese crisis.

==Early life==
Sampaio was born in Lisbon on 18 September 1939 into a middle-class family. The Sampaio family lived in the United States and the United Kingdom for some years due to the professional activity of his father Arnaldo Sampaio (1908–1984), a physician who was recognized for promoting the National Vaccination Program. Jorge Sampaio&#x27;s mother was Fernanda Bensaúde Branco (1908–2000), daughter of Sara Bensliman Bensaúde, who was a Sephardi Jew from Morocco and died in 1976. Sampaio&#x27;s maternal grandfather (1880–1940) was an officer of the Portuguese Navy and later served as Foreign Minister of Portugal, and his maternal great-granduncle was the businessman (1835–1922). Sampaio did not consider himself a Jew and was agnostic.

In an interview for the daily newspaper &quot;Público&quot;, Sampaio said he recalled his parents &quot;putting tapes on the windows, because it was feared that Hitler would come down that way [to Portugal]&quot;. His brother is psychiatrist and academic (born 1946).

Sampaio grew up in a manor house in Sintra. He attended Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s School in São Bento, Lisbon. In the 1947–1948 school year, the Sampaio family—except Daniel—moved to the United States and settled in Baltimore, where his father taught at Johns Hopkins University. Sampaio enrolled at the YMCA, where he practiced boxing and swimming; he also attended piano lessons at the Peabody Institute and participated in its orchestra. At the end of the school year, Sampaio returned to his aunt&#x27;s and uncle&#x27;s house in Lisbon, and soon after to Sintra when his parents returned from the US. In 1949, Jorge Sampaio attempted to enroll at Colégio Militar, but failed, so he enrolled at Liceu Pedro Nunes. After finishing the fifth grade, Sampaio chose a set of subjects that gave him access to the law course at Liceu Passos Manuel.

==Political career==
Jorge Sampaio started his political career as a student of the Faculty of Law of the University of Lisbon. Sampaio had a key role in student resistance and the 1960s academic crisis protesting against the fascist Estado Novo regime, and led the Lisbon students union between 1960 and 1961. Following his graduation in 1961, Sampaio started a career as a lawyer before entering politics following his father&#x27;s advice, and often defended political prisoners. He was in charge of the defense of the accused in famous cases such as the assault on Beja Barracks and those arrested during the protest. The documents that opposed the exile of Mário Soares, who Sampaio would later succeed in the presidency of the Republic, were in his office. He also worked as a director for the Portuguese Bar Association. In the 1970s, he was a co-founder of Movimento de Esquerda Socialista (MES).

===Carnation Revolution and political beginnings===
On 25 April 1974, during the Carnation Revolution, Sampaio was awakened by a friend&#x27;s telephone call; he went to his office to gather information but returned home when the Armed Forces Movement ordered via radio no-one should leave their homes. Sampaio originated the slogan &quot;25 de Abril, sempre!&quot; (&quot;Always the 25 of April!&quot;).

In May 1974, Sampaio co-founded the Movement of Socialist Left (&quot;Movimento de Esquerda Socialista (MES)&quot;) but soon after abandoned the political project when, in the first MES congress in December, he strongly opposed its Marxist-Leninist ideology. On 28 September 1974, Sampaio participated in the barricades to prevent the arrival of citizens at a demonstration in support of General António de Spínola, then-president of the Republic, in an act known as the &quot;demonstration of the silent majority&quot;.

After the failed communist coup of 25 November 1975, Sampaio founded &quot;Intervenção Socialista&quot; (IS) (Socialist Intervention) in an attempt to unify the left but with little success. In 1978, IS was absorbed by the &quot;Partido Socialista&quot; (PS) (&quot;Socialist Party&quot;) and Sampaio joined that party, where he was associated with its left-most wing.

Sampaio was first elected to the Assembly of the Republic in the 1979 legislative election as a deputy for Lisbon, an office he successively held until 1991. Between 1979 and 1984, Sampaio was the first Portuguese member of the European Commission for Human Rights of the Council of Europe. Between 1987 and 1988, he was president of the parliamentary bench of the PS. On 18 November 1988, Jorge Sampaio became a candidate for Secretary-General of the PS, and on 16 January 1989, after defeating Jaime Gama, he succeeded Vítor Constâncio, who resigned. Sampaio led the PS until 1992, when António Guterres defeated him by winning the primaries, after being presented as an alternative following the party&#x27;s poor results in the 1991 legislative election.

===Mayor of Lisbon===
Also in 1989, Sampaio was elected the 62nd Mayor of Lisbon with a left-wing coalition the PS led after winning 49.1% of the vote against PSD candidate Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. This alliance was the first between the PS and the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) after the Carnation Revolution, and was joined by the PEV, the UDP, the MDP/CDE and the PSR, and inaugurated a policy of municipal alliances with the PCP at Sampaio&#x27;s initiative, which the PS did not support.

Sampaio&#x27;s mandate as mayor of Lisbon saw the conclusion of the &quot;Plano Estratégico e do Plano Diretor Municipal&quot; (PDM) and of the &quot;Plano Especial de Realojamento&quot; (PER), the consolidation and inauguration of Lisbon as European Capital of Culture in 1994, the reconstruction of Chiado district that burned down in 1988, and the opening of the Chiado and Music museums.

Sampaio was re-elected for a second term as mayor in 1993. In February 1995, he announced his intention to run for the following year&#x27;s presidential election, which he confirmed in July. Due to his candidacy, Sampaio resigned from his mayoral post and was succeeded by João Soares on 15 November, the day he presented his candidacy before the Constitutional Court.

==Presidency (1996–2006)==
===First term: 1996–2001===
The electoral campaign began on 31 December 1995; throughout the campaign, polls favored Sampaio over the other candidate, former Prime Minister Aníbal Cavaco Silva. Sampaio won the election with 3,035,056 votes (52.66%) and was sworn in on 9 March 1996 in a ceremony at the Assembly of the Republic, succeeding Mário Soares. There was also a historic coincidence: it was the first time the sitting president and prime minister were members of the same political party.

On 13 April, Sampaio was admitted to Lisboan Santa Cruz hospital to undergo heart surgery and was discharged 12 days later. On 27 July, he was again admitted to the hospital for open heart surgery. Due to this, Sampaio requested leave for a temporary impediment at the Constitutional Court; it was the first-such incident. Sampaio was replaced by the President of the Assembly Almeida Santos.

On 19 May 1996, during the 1996 Taça de Portugal Final at Estádio Nacional, a S. L. Benfica cheerleader launched a rocket that killed a Sporting CP fan. Sampaio called for an emergency meeting at halftime in which he tried to cancel the second half of the match. In May 1998, Sampaio inaugurated Expo &#x27;98 in Lisbon.

In 1998, Sampaio became the first president to call referenda: the first was held on 28 June about abortion and the second was held on 8 November about regionalization.

====East Timorese struggle====
Upon becoming president in 1996, Sampaio and the government of António Guterres began to work on the independence of East Timor, which was then a province of Indonesia. In Oslo in 1999, in a CNN debate on the situation in Timor with Nobel Peace Prize winners José Ramos-Horta and bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, Sampaio&#x27;s intervention had international repercussions due to his confrontation with the Indonesian ambassador to the United Nations (UN) Nugroho Wisnumurtio. Sampaio supported the independence of East Timor.

After the resignation of Indonesia&#x27;s President Suharto in 1998 and the succession of B. J. Habibie, Portuguese and international diplomacy led to the holding in East Timor of an independence referendum for the province. The plebescite was held on 30 August 1999 and was followed by a campaign of extreme violence and terror by pro-Indonesian militias, and Portugal put pressure on the international community, especially the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton, to take a position. A crisis cabinet was convened at Belém Palace. Sampaio and the Portuguese government made contacts for an international peacekeeping force to enter the territory. On 15 September 1999, the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1264 was adopted and the International Force East Timor was established.

Former President of East Timor José Ramos-Horta said Sampaio &quot;was a great defender of the East Timorese cause and played a crucial role in the political and diplomatic solution that led to independence&quot;. Sampaio visited East Timor for the first time in February 2000; he was the first Portuguese head of state to do so but his visit was shortened when he learned of the death of his mother. Sampaio returned to East Timor in 2002 following the country&#x27;s Independence with Xanana Gusmão as president. East Timor was also the destination for Sampaio&#x27;s last official trip in 2006.

====End of Portuguese sovereignty over Macau====

In 1999, negotiations for the transfer of sovereignty over Macau to China came to an end and on 19 December, the transfer was completed with the Chinese president Jiang Zemin. Shortly before midnight, Sampaio made a farewell speech, ending 442 years of Portuguese colonialism in Macau. Sampaio&#x27;s participation in the ceremony was doubtful in March of that year because Sampaio refused to take part without the resolution of questions about the territory&#x27;s future.

===Second term: 2001–2006===
On 19 October 2000, Sampaio announced his candidacy in the 2001 presidential election. Sampaio won the election, defeating Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral with 2,401,015 votes (55.55%).

In 2001, while the September 11 attacks on the United States were underway, Sampaio was having lunch with a guest at Belém Palace and had to immediately cancel. In early September 2002, discussions about a possible invasion of Iraq began; from that moment, as Sampaio acknowledged in an interview in 2016, he did not agree with Durão Barroso&#x27;s position Portugal should participate and was strongly opposed to sending troops to Iraq. Sampaio thought the Azores summit would have the objective of avoiding war, according to the prime minister, but as president, Sampaio was not competent to decide on foreign policy.

The defeat of the Socialist Party in the municipal elections of 2001 ended the government of António Guterres, who resigned. Instead of appointing the new leader of the PS Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues as head of government, after a round of consultations with the parliamentary parties, Sampaio dissolved the Assembly and called elections for March 2002. José Manuel Barroso won the legislative election and Sampaio nominated him as the new prime minister.

In February 2002, in an interview for the BBC, Sampaio said Portugal would hold a new referendum to decriminalize abortion. In the same interview, he defended the government&#x27;s decision to decriminalize the use of certain drugs, a proposal several European leaders criticized. Sampaio also stated Europe should commit itself more energetically to resolve the crisis in the Middle East, and that the Palestinians and Israelis should return to negotiations.

On 4 April 2002, Sampaio said he welcomed the peace accords that ended the Angolan Civil War, saying it &quot;opens the way to reconciliation among Angolans and general elections&quot;.

In October 2003, Sampaio invited the presidents of Finland and Germany, and the soon-to-be EU members Hungary, Latvia, and Poland to Arraiolos to discuss the consequences of the 2004 enlargement of the European Union and plans for a Constitution for Europe.

In 2004, Sampaio refused to hold an early election following the resignation of Social Democratic Party Prime Minister Durão Barroso. Sampaio&#x27;s refusal was met with protests from all left-wing parties and the resignation of socialist leader Ferro Rodrigues. Sampaio appointed Pedro Santana Lopes as Prime Minister on 9 July 2004. On 30 November, Sampaio said the new cabinet was not achieving the desired stability and he dissolved the Parliament and called another election for February 2005. Following the PS&#x27;s absolute majority in this election, Sampaio appointed José Sócrates Prime Minister.

Sampaio&#x27;s successor was chosen in the presidential election on 22 January 2006. Aníbal Cavaco Silva, who Sampaio defeated in 1996, succeeded him on 9 March 2006. During his ten years in office, Sampaio convened the Portuguese Council of State 22 times, mainly to manage the Macau issue. , it is the highest number of conventions of any Portuguese president.

==Post-presidential career==
As a former President, Jorge Sampaio became a member of the Portuguese Council of State in 2006. He was also member of the Club de Madrid, an organization of more than 80 former democratic statespersons.

In May 2006, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Sampaio as his first Special Envoy for the Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis. On 26 April 2007, new UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon designated Sampaio as High Representative for the Alliance of Civilizations, a position he held until February 2013, when Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser succeeded him.

In 2010, Sampaio participated in the jury for Fondation Chirac&#x27;s Conflict Prevention Prize. From 2013, he led the Global Platform for Syrian Students to boost the academic training of young people in Syria after the outbreak of the country&#x27;s civil war and refugee crisis. On 26 August 2021, in an article in the newspaper &quot;Público&quot;, Sampaio announced the Global Platform for Syrian Students was creating academic training for female Afghan students amid the Taliban&#x27;s seizure of power in Afghanistan.

==Personal life ==
Jorge Sampaio married twice. In 1967, he married Karin Schmidt Dias, a physician and daughter of anthropologist and German-born pianist (née Schmidt), with whom he had no children. The couple divorced in 1971.

On 6 April 1974, Sampaio married , with whom he had two children: Vera Ritta de Sampaio was born in 1975 and André Ritta de Sampaio was born in 1980.

Sampaio played piano from childhood and was a member of Sporting CP, in which his membership number was 3,109. He supported bullfighting, and collected records and paintings. He was shy, cried easily, was discreet, had a poor temper, and was altruistic. He also had a British accent and red hair he inherited from a paternal great-grandfather.

==Death and funeral==
In August 2021, while on vacation in Algarve, Sampaio began to feel unwell and was transferred by helicopter to Lisbon. On 27 August, he was admitted to Santa Cruz hospital, where he died of respiratory failure on 10 September 2021, eight days before his 82nd birthday. On that day, the Council of Ministers decreed three days of national mourning would begin on 11 September. The next day, the funeral procession transited Lisbon City Hall, where the mayor Fernando Medina received him. The final destination was the Royal Riding Arena of the National Coach Museum, where the mortuary chapel was installed and his coffin was flanked with wreaths of red carnations.

On Sunday 12 September, Sampaio&#x27;s state funeral was held at Jerónimos Monastery and was attended by the highest national institutions, including UN Secretary-General and former Prime Minister António Guterres. Also present were foreign leaders such as the King of Spain Felipe VI, the Prime Minister of Cape Verde Ulisses Correia e Silva, the President of the Parliament of East Timor Aniceto Guterres Lopes, and delegates of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries. Later, in a private ceremony, Sampaio was buried at Alto de São João Cemetery, Lisbon.

<text>Francis Hutcheson (13 August 1721 – 5 September 1784) was an Irish violinist, composer, physician and lecturer in chemistry. His surname was often misspelled as &quot;Hutchinson&quot;. He published his music under the pseudonym &quot;Francis Ireland&quot;.

==Early life==
Francis Hutcheson was born in Dublin. His parents were the philosopher Francis Hutcheson and his wife Mary (née Wilson)

His father was appointed to the Chair of Moral Philosophy in the University of Glasgow in 1729, necessitating a family move. Hutcheson studied in Glasgow University, graduating M.A. there in 1744, and M.D. in 1750.

His father died in 1746, leaving the younger Hutcheson property in Ballyhackamore and Drumalig, Saintfield, County Down, as well as County Longford. Hutcheson senior also left his son the task of organising his papers for publication. With the help of his father&#x27;s colleague Rev. William Leechman, this task was completed in 1755 with the publishing of &quot;A System of Moral Philosophy&quot;, dedicated to Edward Synge

==Medical and scientific life in Dublin==
Francis Hutcheson was admitted to the Royal College of Physicians in Dublin in January 1754 and was appointed to the Meath Hospital. He was also appointed to lecture in chemistry in Trinity College, Dublin on 12 July 1760. He received the degree of Doctor in Physics from Trinity on 22 November 1761. Not only did he lecture the undergraduates, but in a form of early public engagement ran courses for the general public. Hutcheson resigned his post at Trinity College on 3 November 1767, the day after being elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.

Hutcheson (styled as &quot;Fra. Hutchison&quot;) was one of 49 physicians and chirurgeons who declared their public support for the construction of a Publick Bath in Dublin in May 1771 and named Achmet Borumborad as a well qualified individual for carrying such a scheme into existence.
He was then appointed consulting physician to the Rotunda Hospital in 1774, a post that he retained until 1784. He was also a member of the Board of Governors during this time. He was president of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in 1777 and 1780.

==Musical career==
Francis Hutcheson was a keen violinist, and is probably the &quot;Dr Hutchinson&quot; who was a founder member of the Musical Academy, founded by Lord Mornington in Dublin in 1757 in whose orchestra he played violin. There is also a &quot;Dr Hutchinson&quot; (one of four &quot;Gentlemen of Approved Taste&quot;) listed as a member of an organising committee for fundraising concerts in aid of the Rotunda Hospital.

Under the pseudonym &quot;Francis Ireland&quot;, he composed glees, catches, and madrigals. These are mostly written for three voices (three sopranos or two sopranos and a bass). It is alleged he adopted this pseudonym for fear of public knowledge of his composing adversely affecting his professional prospects.

The Noblemen&#x27;s and Gentlemen&#x27;s Catch Club awarded prizes to three of his works: &quot;As Colin One Evening&quot; (1771), &quot;Jolly Bacchus&quot; (1772), and &quot;Where Weeping Yews&quot; (1773). Thomas Warren&#x27;s series &quot;A Collection of Catches, Canons and Glees&quot; (London, c.1763–94) includes eleven glees and eight catches of his composition. Hutcheson&#x27;s work also appeared in other collections including Henry Mountain&#x27;s &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Catch Book&quot; (Dublin, c.1790).

The Grove Dictionary (1900) describes Hutcheson as producing &quot;many vocal compositions of considerable merit&quot; and says that his &quot;beautiful madrigal, &#x27;Return, return, my lovely maid,&#x27; is universally admired&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Hutcheson lived in 32 Stafford Street, Dublin. He married Miss Sarah Card. They had three daughters and one son, also called Francis. This son was later Rev. Dr Francis Hutcheson, the Rector of Donaghadee.

Francis Hutcheson died in Dublin aged 63.

<text>The acorn woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus) is a medium-sized woodpecker with a length of around , and an average weight of . It is found across Central America, as well as North into the western United States and South into parts of Colombia.

==Taxonomy==
The acorn woodpecker was formally described in 1827 by the English naturalist William Swainson under the binomial name &quot;Picus formicivorus&quot; from a specimen collected in Mexico. The specific epithet combines the Latin &quot;formica&quot; meaning &quot;ant&quot; with &quot;-vorus&quot; meaning &quot;eating&quot;. The type locality is Temascaltepec in Mexico. The acorn woodpecker is one of 24 species now placed in the genus &quot;Melanerpes&quot; that was introduced by Swainson in 1832. Within &quot;Melanerpes&quot; the acorn woodpecker is sister to a clade containing two South American species: the white woodpecker (&quot;Melanerpes candidus&quot;) and the white-fronted woodpecker (&quot;Melanerpes cactorum&quot;).

Seven subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;M. f. bairdi&quot; Ridgway, 1881 – Oregon (USA) to north Baja California (Mexico)
* &quot;M. f. angustifrons&quot; Baird, SF, 1870 – south Baja California (Mexico)
* &quot;M. f. formicivorus&quot; (Swainson, 1827) – southwest USA to southeast Mexico
* &quot;M. f. albeolus&quot; Todd, 1910 – east Chiapas (southeast Mexico) to Belize and northeast Guatemala
* &quot;M. f. lineatus&quot; (Dickey &amp; Van Rossem, 1927) – Chiapas (south Mexico) to north Nicaragua
* &quot;M. f. striatipectus&quot; Ridgway, 1874 – Nicaragua to west Panama
* &quot;M. f. flavigula&quot; (Malherbe, 1849) – Colombia

==Description==
The adult acorn woodpecker has a brownish-black head, back, wings and tail, white forehead, throat, belly and rump. The eyes are initially dark in fledglings, turning to white within a few months. There is a small part on the small of their backs where there are some greenish feathers. The bird is mostly black, with adult males have a red cap starting at the forehead, whereas females have a black area between the forehead and the cap. The white neck, throat, and forehead patches are distinctive identifiers. When flying, they take a few flaps of their wings and drop a foot or so. White circles on their wings are visible when in flight. Acorn woodpeckers have a call that sounds almost like they are laughing.

=== Distribution and habitat ===
The acorn woodpecker&#x27;s habitat is forested areas with oaks in the coastal areas and foothills of Oregon, California, and the southwestern United States, south through Central America to Colombia. This species may occur at low elevations in the north of its range, but rarely below in Central America, and it breeds up to the timberline. Nests are excavated in a cavity in a dead tree or a dead part of a tree.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
Acorn woodpeckers are cooperative breeders, living and breeding in family groups of up to 15 individuals. Field studies have shown that within the same population, groups range from monogamous pairs to polygynandrous breeding collectives consisting of coalitions of up to 8 males and 4 females, along with nonbreeding &quot;helpers at the nest&quot; that are offspring from prior breeding events. Regardless of composition, all breeder males (who are usually brothers or fathers and their sons) compete for matings with all breeder females (who are sisters or a mother and her daughter), the latter of which lay their eggs communally in the same nest cavity. There is considerable variability within and among populations, suggesting extraordinary social plasticity. Cooperative breeding, defined as more than two birds taking care of nestlings in the nest, is a relatively rare evolutionary trait that is thought to occur in only nine percent of bird species. Most cooperative breeding species have helpers at the nest, but acorn woodpeckers are unusual in exhibiting both helping at the nest and cooperative polygamy (polygynandry). It is generally believed that limited territories are a key driver of cooperative breeding behavior in birds, and in the case of the acorn woodpecker, the availability of acorn storage granaries (see below) is a key limited resource.

Breeding coalitions consist of up to eight cobreeding males and up to four joint-nesting females. However, most nests consist of only a single breeder female and 1 to 3 cobreeder males. Nesting groups can also contain up to ten offspring helpers. As mentioned above, the breeder males are often brothers, and the females are usually sisters. However, reproductive vacancies—formed when all the breeders of one sex die—are filled by unrelated birds from elsewhere, so inbreeding is rare, despite the high degree of relatedness among most group members.

In groups with more than one breeding female, the females lay their eggs in a single nest cavity. A female usually destroys any eggs in the nest before she starts to lay. Once all the females start to lay, they stop removing eggs. Although multiple paternity and maternity are common within groups containing multiple cobreeders, no extra-group paternity has been detected.

===Food and feeding===
Acorn woodpeckers, as their name implies, depend heavily on acorns for food. Acorns are such an important resource to the California populations that acorn woodpeckers may nest in the fall to take advantage of the fall acorn crop, a rare behavior in birds. Acorns are stored in small holes drilled especially for this purpose in &quot;granaries&quot; or &quot;storage trees&quot;—usually snags, dead branches, utility poles, or wooden buildings. Storage holes—always in dead tissue such as bark or dead limbs—are used year after year, and granaries can consist of thousands of holes, each of which may be filled by an acorn in the autumn. Access to acorn crops influences the composition of acorn woodpecker communities. In one study in Old Mexico, there were about 90% of non-breeding adults per social unit in 1976, a year of a poor acorn crop. The following year, 1977, there was a significant increase in acorn production and a correlating decrease in non-breeding adults per unit.

Although acorns are an important back-up food resource, acorn woodpeckers primarily feed on insects, sap, and fruit. They can be seen sallying from tree limbs to catch insects, eating fruit and seeds, and drilling holes to drink sap.

The woodpeckers then collect acorns and find a hole that is just the right size for the acorn. As acorns dry out, they are moved to smaller holes and granary maintenance requires a significant amount of the bird&#x27;s time. The acorns are visible, and a group defends its granary against potential cache robbers like Steller&#x27;s jays and western scrub-jays.

In some more tropical parts of its range the acorn woodpecker does not construct a &quot;granary tree&quot;, but instead stores acorns in natural holes and cracks in bark. If the acorn crop is poor and birds cannot find enough to store, the woodpeckers will move to other areas over the winter.
==Threats and status==
Acorn woodpeckers, like many other species, are threatened by habitat loss and degradation. Competition for nest cavities by non-native species is an ongoing threat in urbanized areas. Conservation of this species is dependent on the maintenance of functional ecosystems that provide the full range of resources upon which the species depends. These include mature forests with oaks capable of producing large mast crops and places for the woodpeckers to nest, roost, and store mast. Residents are encouraged to preserve mature oak and pine-oak stands of trees and to provide dead limbs and snags for nesting, roosting, and granary sites to help preserve the acorn woodpecker&#x27;s population.

==Popular culture==
Walter Lantz is believed to have patterned the call of his cartoon character Woody Woodpecker on that of the acorn woodpecker, while patterning his appearance on that of the pileated woodpecker, which has a prominent crest.

<text>LBC (originally the London Broadcasting Company) is a British phone-in and talk radio station owned and operated by Global and based in its headquarters in London. It was the UK&#x27;s first licensed commercial radio station, and began to broadcast on Monday 8 October 1973, a week ahead of Capital Radio. 

The launch of LBC also saw the beginning of Independent Radio News broadcasting, as LBC provided the service to independent local radio stations nationwide. LBC broadcast only to London until 2006, at which time it became available, via digital radio, in some other parts of the country. It has been available nationwide since 2014, with the letters now standing for Leading Britain&#x27;s Conversation. LBC has a like-branded sister station, LBC News, dedicated to rolling news, travel and weather.

==History==
===Launch and early history===
The station was originally based in studios on Gough Square, off Fleet Street in the City of London.
David Jessel was LBC&#x27;s original breakfast presenter; he opened the station just before 6 a.m. on Monday 8 October 1973. The original station had several presenters who became household names in the British media. These include Adrian Love, Jon Snow, Peter Allen, Rosie Boycott, and Bel Mooney. For 10 years from 1975 the breakfast show &quot;AM&quot; was presented by Bob Holness and Douglas Cameron. LBC&#x27;s late-evening interview and phone-in programme between 9p.m. (later 10p.m.) and 1a.m. was called &quot;Nightline &quot;and at various times was hosted by Adrian Love, Robin Houston, Monty Modlyn, Jeremy Beadle and Tommy Boyd. There was also a character called &quot;Mr Nasty&quot; (played by John Forrest), who argued over the telephone with children. Beadle and Forrest went on to star in the Granada Television series &quot;Fun Factory&quot;.

===Changes of ownership===
Originally owned by a consortium led by the Canadian Selkirk Communications of Vancouver, British Columbia with a 47% stake, LBC was sold in 1987, beginning a turbulent commercial history. The new owners were media company Darling Downs, later renamed Crown Communications, owned by Australian entrepreneur David Haynes. Crown sold the station&#x27;s original base in Gough Square near Fleet Street in the City of London and relocated to Hammersmith; and in 1989 split the station into two separate services, the news and comment station LBC Crown FM, and the phone-in London Talkback Radio on AM. The transition was not initially well received, and substantially increased costs, pushing the company into the red. In 1993, the company was sold to Shirley Porter&#x27;s Chelverton Investments, after Crown fell into financial difficulties.

===London News Radio===
On the morning of Friday, 3 September 1993, the Radio Authority announced it would not renew the company&#x27;s two licences, LBC Newstalk and London Talkback Radio, awarding the frequencies instead to London News Radio, a consortium led by former LBC staff and backed by Guinness Mahon. Staff at the station were in shock, not least because while they had received a tip-off from the &quot;Financial Times&quot; that they looked set to lose one of their frequencies, they did not expect to lose both. This was one of only a handful of times the UK media regulator had declined to renew the licence of an incumbent station. The prospective loss of the franchise brought Chelverton to the brink of collapse, and London News Radio (soon itself taken over by Reuters) bought LBC to keep it on air until the official handover date of October 1994.

London News Radio operated the station from LBC&#x27;s former studios in Hammersmith as London News 97.3, a rolling news and travel information service on the FM band, and the phone-in-driven service London News Talk 1152 on the MW band. These names were simplified slightly in mid-1995 to News 97.3 and News Talk 1152 respectively, but between October 1994 and July 1996 the LBC name was not used on-air at all.

===Return of LBC===
Reuters then brought in additional shareholders, and between 1996 and 2002 LBC was part of London News Radio Limited, a company owned jointly by ITN, Daily Mail and General Trust, Reuters, and the GWR Group. This new consortium revived the LBC name on 1152AM on 1 July 1996. At the end of 1996, the FM service was relaunched as News Direct 97.3FM. Production for the station was moved to the basement of ITN&#x27;s multimedia building in Gray&#x27;s Inn Road.

===Chrysalis===
In 2002, the company was bought for £23.5m by the media company Chrysalis, which trumpeted its purchase with the promise that it would lift the listenership to at least one million from around 700,000 (LBC had enjoyed an audience of more than two million in the early 1980s). Production was moved to Chrysalis&#x27;s base in North Kensington, and the formatting of the two frequencies was swapped, the talk format moving to FM and the news format to AM.

On 13 January 2004, then British Prime Minister Tony Blair presented an hour-long phone-in show on the station, taking pre-booked calls from LBC 97.3 listeners. His appearance was part of the &quot;Big Conversation&quot; initiative to promote government as being more accessible and in touch with the people. During the 1011a.m. show, a caller said that he had been denied access to his children for five years and asked what Blair was planning to do about other fathers in a similar situation. Blair assured the caller he would look into his case personally. It later transpired that the caller was in fact Fathers 4 Justice member Ron Davis, who in May of that year was arrested for entering Parliament and throwing a condom containing purple powder over Blair and nearby Cabinet members. Davis said the attack was in response to the Prime Minister&#x27;s failure to contact him or look into the matters discussed on LBC 97.3.

Mark Flanagan, the station&#x27;s Managing Director, left Chrysalis in 2005 to set up a political consultancy company, and was replaced by David Lloyd. He introduced a podcasting service called LBC Plus, and a number of premium-rate promotional opportunities to replace falling advertising revenues experienced by the radio sector.

In January 2006, LBC Plus launched as a paid subscription service providing podcasts; eventually this became a free catch-up service.

In September 2006, LBC 97.3 became available in some other parts of the country on the digital DAB platform, after Chrysalis bought out its partners and closed the Digital News Network rolling news station, which had previously been carried on the MXR multiplex. Each multiplex region − the North West, West Midlands, Yorkshire, North East, South Wales, and the West − broadcast the London LBC transmission, augmented with occasional bulletins of regional news and travel information.

===Global Radio===
In February 2007, Chrysalis confirmed media speculation that it was reviewing the entire radio operation at its investors&#x27; request. Further media speculation from &quot;The Guardian&quot; suggested that the group had little option, due to shareholder pressure, to sell its radio arm, including LBC, raising up to £200 million for new acquisitions, while &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; suggested that it could be the subject of a management buyout. Subsequently, it was announced on 25 June 2007 that LBC along with its sister stations The Arrow, Heart, and Galaxy network were to be sold for £170 million to Global Radio by the Chrysalis Group, whose Chrysalis Radio operation closed down. In December 2008 the station moved to the Capital London studios in Leicester Square.

In April 2007, a new marketing slogan for (what was then called) LBC 97.3 was introduced − &quot;London&#x27;s Biggest Conversation&quot;, a play on the station&#x27;s initials.

The radio station became involved in the MMR vaccine controversy after a broadcast by Jeni Barnett on 7 January 2009 in which she debated the alleged dangers of MMR vaccine with callers. It became the subject of media controversy, first because her views were criticised as irresponsible by medical journalist Dr Ben Goldacre, and then because LBC and Global Radio threatened legal action against Goldacre for copyright infringement after he refused to remove the audio of the show from his blog, which resulted in its being made available at Wikileaks and elsewhere and the preparation of transcripts of the broadcast. David Aaronovitch in &quot;The Times&quot; argued for &quot;a class action against LBC for permitting a presenter to inflict her preposterous prejudices on her listeners, to the detriment of someone else&#x27;s kids.&quot; Norman Lamb MP tabled an Early Day Motion criticising Barnett and LBC for the likely effect of the broadcast on public health.

Towards the end of October 2012, the station ceased DAB broadcasts to some parts of the country as regional DAB multiplexes in England and Wales were shut down.

Since 2013 LBC has broadcast a consumer law show, called &quot;The Consumer Hour&quot; that focused on providing information, advice, and support to listeners on various consumer-related topics, such as personal finance, product safety, and consumer rights. The show was initially hosted by Clive Bull with listeners&#x27; questions answered by guest consumer lawyer Dean Dunham; since 2020 Dunham has solely presented the show.

On 30 January 2014, LBC announced its intention to begin broadcasting nationally on DAB at 7a.m. on 11 February 2014 under a new slogan, &quot;Leading Britain&#x27;s Conversation&quot;, with new jingles composed by David Arnold and performed by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. LBC took up the slot previously occupied by Jazz FM (and briefly Birdsong), and dropped the &quot;97.3&quot; from the station name to reinforce the notion that it now had national coverage.

In a 2023 poll by YouGov, 14% of respondents ranked LBC as a trusted news brand. A further 14% of respondents did not trust LBC. The remaining respondents were either neutral or did not answer.

As of September 2024, LBC and LBC London broadcast to a combined weekly audience of 4.1 million, according to RAJAR.

<doc id="354468" wikidata="Q4259103" url="?curid=354468" title="Leap, County Cork">
<text>Leap (; or &quot;An Léim&quot;) is a village in County Cork, Ireland, situated at the north end of Glandore harbour, several miles inland from the seacoast. It is on the N71 road which runs through West Cork from Cork city. The village is in the parish of Kilmacabea which also includes Glandore village.

==Name and history==
The Irish name of the village, &quot;Léim Uí Dhonnabháin&quot;, means &quot;O&#x27;Donovan&#x27;s Leap&quot; and is reputedly derived from the story of a chieftain called O&#x27;Donovan, who was pursued by English soldiers, but escaped them by jumping across a ravine on the western side of the village.

In 1684, Jeremiah O&#x27;Donovan (MP Baltimore), Lord of Clan Loughlin, obtained letters patent from Charles II of England. His extensive landholdings in the surrounding countryside were erected into the Manor of O&#x27;Donovan&#x27;s Leap, or the Manor of the Leap.

==Amenities==
The village has four bars (of which two serve food and one which is a music venue) and a fast food diner. Connolly&#x27;s of Leap has been a bar since 1810. The local Anglican community is serviced by Leap Church. The village also has a furniture and hardware store, a petrol station/shop and a hairdresser and a beauty salon.

An amenity park was opened in 2021.

There are bus services to Skibbereen and Cork city.

<doc id="354469" wikidata="Q569535" url="?curid=354469" title="Red-bellied woodpecker">
<text>The red-bellied woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus) is a medium-sized woodpecker of the family Picidae. It breeds mainly in the eastern United States, ranging as far south as Florida and as far north as Canada. Though it has a vivid orange-red crown and nape it is not to be confused with the red-headed woodpecker, a separate species of woodpecker in the same genus with an entirely red head and neck that sports a solid black back and white belly. The red-bellied earns its name from the pale reddish tint on its lower underside.

==Taxonomy==
The English naturalist Mark Catesby described and illustrated the red-bellied woodpecker in his book &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot; which was published between 1729 and 1732. Catesby used the English name &quot;The Red-bellied Wood-pecker&quot; and the Latin &quot;Picus ventre rubro&quot;. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he included the red-bellied woodpecker, coined the binomial name &quot;Picus carolinus&quot; and cited Catesby&#x27;s book. Linnaeus specified the type locality as &quot;America septentrionali&quot; (North America). The locality is now restricted to South Carolina. The red-bellied woodpecker is one of 24 species now placed in the genus &quot;Melanerpes&quot; that was introduced by the English ornithologist William Swainson in 1832. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
Adults are mainly light gray on the face and underparts; they have black and white barred patterns on their back, wings and tail. Adult males have a red cap going from the bill to the nape; females have a red patch on the nape and another above the bill. The reddish tinge on the belly that gives the bird its name is difficult to see in field identification. White patches become visible on the wings in flight. Red-bellied woodpeckers are long, have a wingspan of , and weigh .

===Vocalizations===
Red-bellied woodpeckers are noisy birds, and have many varied calls. Calls have been described as sounding like &#x27; or &#x27; with an alternating &#x27; sound. Males tend to call and drum more frequently than females, but both sexes call. The drum sounds like 6 taps. Often, these woodpeckers &quot;drum&quot; to attract mates. They tap on hollow trees, and even on aluminum roofs, metal guttering and transformer boxes in urban environments, to communicate with potential partners. Babies have a high-pitched begging call of &#x27;. They will continue to give a begging call whenever they see their parents for a while after fledging.


==Behavior and ecology==
These birds mainly search out arthropods on tree trunks. They may also catch insects in flight. They are omnivores, eating insects, fruits, nuts and seeds. Their breeding habitat is usually deciduous forests. They nest in the decayed cavities of dead trees, old stumps, or in live trees that have softer wood such as elms, maples, or willows; both sexes assist in digging nesting cavities. Areas around nest sites are marked with drilling holes to warn others away. 

Though the species is not globally threatened, it depends on large trees for nesting. In areas that are extensively deforested, the birds will sometimes utilize gardens, but for the most part they simply will not be present in any numbers.

===Breeding===
In early May, the red-bellied woodpeckers begin breeding activities by drumming patterns, such as slow taps followed by short rapid drumming. The red-bellied woodpeckers use vocal signals to attract and communicate with potential mates. A low &quot;&quot;grr, grr&quot; sound is observed in a pair of woodpeckers from the start of courtship until the end of the breeding season. In an intraspecific conflict, red-bellied woodpeckers usually make a loud &quot;chee-wuck, chee-wuck, chee-wuck&quot;&quot; sound. As indicated by Kilham 1983, the red-bellied woodpecker drums with its bill during conflict situation and taps to maintain pair bonding. An example of a conflict event would be competing for the same mate. Nevertheless, red-bellied woodpeckers are known to be in monogamous relationships. They have been known to rapidly peck on aluminum gutters of houses to produce a loud noise in order to attract females.

Woodpeckers depend on dead and drying wood for nesting purposes. The male red-bellied woodpecker takes the initiative in locating a nest hole. He will then seek approval from his mate by mutual tapping. The red-bellied woodpecker excavates holes in trees for nesting and roosting. By excavating cavities, they play an important role in forest communities for other species as well. For example, squirrels and bats use these cavities as shelter. The female red-bellied woodpecker accepts the nesting site by completing the excavation and entering the nest hole.

Researchers have documented that red-bellied woodpeckers tend to nest in clear areas with only a few trees. Studies have indicated that close canopy areas do not impact the bird&#x27;s nesting behavior; however, further studies are needed and are in progress. Red-bellied woodpeckers breed once per year and are territorial during the nesting season. A pair begins nesting in April or May holding a year-round territory and showing high site fidelity.

Red-bellied woodpeckers depend on dead trees for nesting. Recent studies have shown that these woodpeckers experienced low breeding due to cutting sites of dead trees; however, predators are still of main concern. The juvenile red-bellied woodpecker is ready to fledge at 24 to 26 days of age. Natal dispersal has been observed in juvenile red-bellied woodpeckers. The juvenile red-bellied woodpecker remains in its natal area for approximately 27 weeks after fledging. In some cases, the woodpecker may return to its natal area for breeding, depending on predation levels and food resources.

==Food and feeding==

As with all animals, foraging plays an important role in an animal&#x27;s ability to survive and reproduce. The red-bellied woodpecker expresses foraging behavior by catching or storing food. The woodpecker uses its bill as a chisel, drilling into bark or probing cracks on trunk of trees. In this manner, it is able to pull out beetles and other insects from the tree with the help of its long tongue. This behavior is also seen in storing food from other animals by hiding food behind bark or deep in cracks of a tree. According to studies from Williams (1975), Breitwisch (1977), and Williams and Batzil (1979), the red-bellied woodpecker spent 20% to 69% of its time foraging on dead or decaying trees. In addition, Breitwisch (1977) observed red-bellied woodpeckers primarily gleaning and probing to find food in South Florida pine habitat. The red-bellied woodpecker relies on snags or dying trees for foraging and nesting. It is a major predator of the invasive emerald ash borer in the U.S. Midwest, removing up to 85 percent of borer larvae in a single infested ash tree. The red-bellied woodpecker has also been observed, on occasion, foraging on the ground amongst groups of northern flicker woodpeckers.

==Predation==

Predators of adult red-bellied woodpeckers include birds of prey such as sharp-shinned hawks and Cooper&#x27;s hawks, black rat snake, and house cats. Known predators of nestlings and eggs include red-headed woodpeckers, owls, pileated woodpeckers, eastern gray squirrels, fox squirrels, gray rat snakes, and black rat snakes. When approached by a predator, red-bellied woodpeckers either hide from it or harass it with alarm calls. They defend their nests and young aggressively, and may directly attack predators that come near the nest.

<doc id="354470" wikidata="Q799721" url="?curid=354470" title="Baebia gens">
<text>The gens Baebia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome. The first member of the gens who obtained the consulship was Gnaeus Baebius Tamphilus, in 182 BC. During the later Republic, the Baebii were frequently connected with the patrician family of the Aemilii.

==Praenomina==
The main praenomina of Baebii during the Republic were &quot;Quintus&quot;, &quot;Gnaeus&quot;, &quot;Marcus&quot;, and &quot;Lucius&quot;, all of which were common names throughout Roman history. In addition to these, they occasionally used &quot;Gaius&quot; and &quot;Aulus&quot;. Other names occur under the Empire.

==Branches and cognomina==
The cognomina of the Baebii are &quot;Dives&quot;, &quot;Herennius&quot;, &quot;Sulca&quot;, and &quot;Tamphilus&quot;. The last, borne by the oldest family of the Baebii appearing in history, is the only surname which appears on coins, where it is written &quot;Tampilus&quot;. All of the consuls and most of the praetors of this gens during the Republic belonged to this branch of the family. Chase describes their surname as one of considerable curiosity, suggested by some scholars to be of Greek origin, but perhaps an Oscan name sharing a common root with the Tampia gens, who may have been of Sabine origin. Certainly &quot;Herennius&quot;, borne as a surname by one of the Baebii, was originally an Oscan praenomen. In imperial times, one family of the Baebii settled around Saguntum, the Spanish town over which the Second Punic War had begun.

==Members==
===Baebii Tamphili===
* Quintus Baebius Cn. f. Tamphilus, an envoy sent to Hannibal at Saguntum in 219 BC, and then to Carthage.
* Quintus Baebius (Tamphilus), tribune of the plebs in 200 BC, opposed a motion to declare war on Philip V of Macedon, and accused the Senate of warmongering; perhaps the eldest brother of the consular Baebii.
* Gnaeus Baebius Q. f. Cn. n. Tamphilus, praetor in 199 BC, was assigned to Cisalpine Gaul, where he was defeated by the Insubres; the consul Lucius Cornelius Lentulus replaced him, and sent Baebius to Rome. Consul in 182, Baebius fought against the Ligures with some success.
* Marcus Baebius Q. f. Cn. n. Tamphilus, consul in 181 BC.
* Gnaeus Baebius (Cn. f. Q. n.) Tamphilus, praetor &quot;urbanus&quot; in 168 BC. The following year, he was one of five legates sent into Illyricum.
* Marcus Baebius Q. f. Tamphilus, &quot;triumvir monetalis&quot; in 137 BC.
* (Marcus) Baebius (Tamphilus), tribune of the plebs in 103 BC, attempted to veto the agrarian law of his colleague, Saturninus, who had proposed that veterans should be granted parcels of land in the province of Africa. Baebius was stoned and forced to flee. He may be the same Marcus Baebius who was put to death by Marius in 87 BC.
* Gaius Baebius Tamphilus, appears on a coin of uncertain date.

===Other Baebii of the Republic===
* Quintus Baebius Herennius, tribune of the plebs in 216 BC. He was a relative by marriage of Gaius Terentius Varro, and actively supported his candidacy for the consulship against the senatorial elite, who objected to Varro&#x27;s humble origins. According to Livy, Baebius criticized the emergence of a new elite forged from the patricians and plebeian &quot;nobiles&quot;, altering the traditional social structure.
* Lucius Baebius Dives, probably the same Lucius Baebius who was sent by Scipio Africanus as one of the ambassadors to Carthage in 203 BC. He was afterwards left by Scipio in command of the camp. Praetor in 189 BC, received Hispania Ulterior as his province, but was attacked by the Ligures on his journey, and died at Massilia.
* Marcus Baebius, one of the three commissioners sent into Macedonia in 186 BC, to investigate the charges brought by the Maronitae and others against Philip.
* Quintus Baebius Sulca, one of the ambassadors sent to Ptolemy VI Philometor of Egypt in 173 BC. He had probably been praetor in 175.
* Lucius Baebius, one of three commissioners sent into Macedonia in 169 BC, to inspect the state of affairs there, before Lucius Aemilius Paullus invaded the country.
* Aulus Baebius, a prefect under the command of Lucius Aemilius Paullus in 167 BC. He was left in command of a garrison at Demetrias, and became involved in the internal political struggles of the Aetolian League. He used Roman soldiers to surround a meeting of the Aetolian Senate, and allowed Aetolian soldiers to massacre five hundred and fifty attendees. Proscriptions and exiles followed. Paullus may have been complicit, for he received complaints circumspectly, took no action against the Aetolian leaders, and censured Baebius only for allowing Roman soldiers to take part. Baebius was afterwards condemned at Rome.
* Gaius Baebius, tribune of the plebs in 111 BC, bribed by Jugurtha to quash the investigation of Gaius Memmius.
* Gaius Baebius, appointed by Lucius Julius Caesar in 89 BC as his successor in the command in the Social War.
* Marcus Baebius, put to death by Marius and Cinna when they entered Rome in 87 BC. Instead of being killed by any weapon, Baebius was literally torn to pieces by the hands of his enemies.
* Marcus Baebius, a brave man, slain by order of Lucius Calpurnius Piso in Macedonia, in 57 BC.
* Aulus Baebius, an eques of Asta, in Hispania, deserted the Pompeian party in the Spanish War in 45 BC, and went over to Caesar.
* Baebius, a senator who served under Publius Vatinius in Illyria. On the murder of Caesar, in 44 BC, the Illyrians rose against Vatinius, and cut off Baebius and five cohorts which he commanded.
* Gaius Baebius, one of the military tribunes in 31 BC.

===Baebii under the Empire===
* Gaius Baebius Atticus, &quot;eques&quot; and governor of Noricum.
* Baebius Massa, formerly governor of Baetica, for the maladministration of which he was condemned in AD 93. He avoided punishment through the favour of the emperor Domitian, under whom he became a notorious informer.
* Lucius Baebius Avitus, enrolled in the senate by Vespasian, and procurator of Lusitania.
* Lucius Baebius Honoratus, consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in AD 85.
* Publius Baebius Italicus, consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in AD 90.
* Lucius Baebius Tullius, consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in AD 95, and proconsul of Asia from 110 to 111.
* Quintus Baebius Macer, consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in AD 103, and &quot;praefectus urbi&quot; in 117.
* Baebius Marcellinus, aedile in 203 AD, was unjustly condemned to death under Septimius Severus, because by his baldness and senatorial rank, he vaguely resembled a man reported to have heard about a dream that the nurse of a certain Apronianus had once had, to the effect that Apronianus had become emperor.
* Lucius Baebius Juncinus, an equestrian officer, perhaps the father or grandfather of Lucius Baebius Aurelius Juncinus.
* Baebius Macrinus, a rhetorician, mentioned along with Julius Frontinus and Julius Granianus, as one of the teachers of the emperor Alexander Severus.
* Lucius Baebius Aurelius Juncinus, prefect of Egypt from AD 213 to 215.
* Baebius Macer, praetorian prefect during the reign of Valerian.
* Lucius Baebius Cassianus, of the &quot;tribus&quot; Voltinia in southern Gaul.
