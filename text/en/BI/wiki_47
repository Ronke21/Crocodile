<text>The everyday happenings of Weebl and sometimes Weebl&#x27;s friend, Bob (best known as Weebl and Bob, and renamed Wobbl and Bob for its DVD release) is a British animated cartoon series created by Jonti Picking and co-scripted by Chris Vick. It revolves around a &quot;grammatically challenged weeble&quot; and his friend Bob and their quest for pie.

==Description==

===Main summary===
The two main characters Weebl and Bob are best friends, but prone to harassing and insulting each other. Both are egg-shaped creatures with wide mouths that split their heads in half, and move by rolling, hopping or swaying back and forth. They mutter and &#x27;talk&#x27; in a way largely unintelligible to viewers while perfectly understood by one another and other characters, with visible speech balloons captioning their dialogue. Weebl is the larger of the two; it is revealed that Bob&#x27;s small stature is due to a cheese overdose in the 1980s. Many of their stories are centered around their love of pie, a devotion shared by most of the other characters in their world—these episodes generally depict one of their several (often failed) attempts to obtain it. Some episodes are a vehicle to introduce a new character into the storyline, while others are parodies of cultural phenomena, such as &quot;Hello Kitty&quot;, Japanese karate and ninja movies, &#x27;80s anti-drug documentaries, Michael Moore&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, the crime drama &quot;&quot;, the iPod &quot;silhouette&quot; ad campaign, the MTV show &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot;, the game show &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot;, Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot;, the video game &quot;Portal&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, the Academy Awards and even retailers such as PC World (&#x27;Pissy Werld&#x27; in the show), IKEA (or &#x27;PIKEA&#x27;) and Matalan (&#x27;Catalan&#x27;).

===History===

The first episode, &quot;Pie&quot;, was uploaded by Picking on June 6, 2002. By February 2007, more than 120 episodes had been released, together with 6 MTV-only episodes, 1 DVD-only cartoon, and an unofficial 30th birthday animation. Typical episodes are about two minutes in length and require three days of production time. The majority of episodes are animated by Weebl, whilst some recent episodes are animated by Nathan Malone, aka ZekeySpaceyLizard. The 100th web-released episode, which is a few minutes longer than normal cartoons, came out January 10, 2006.

Along with the normal episodes of Weebl and Bob, a few special feature episodes have been created by Weebl and Skoo in which Bob narrates a story. These are very sketchy as if they were hand-drawn and &#x27;animated&#x27; by Bob himself. There are also a few episodes that don&#x27;t feature Weebl and Bob characters at all, made by Skoo alone. A single episode titled &quot;Asshat&quot; was created (and &#x27;buggered up&#x27; by, among many things, turning Bob into a weird Scooby-Doo caricature) by Picking&#x27;s friend Rob Manuel, founder of b3ta. Three other guest-animated episodes include &quot;Merchandise,&quot; &quot;Birthday Wishes,&quot; and &quot;Thirty&quot; (the latter two made in celebration of Jonti Picking&#x27;s birthday on 17 May.).

Weebl&#x27;s production company Sumo Dojo worked on the Anchor Spreadable adverts in the UK. They were also involved in the release of the first year of Weebl and Bob on DVD in late 2004. The DVD includes a documentary narrated by Brian Blessed and an exclusive episode.

A related Flash game, titled &quot;Ultimate Pie Theft&quot;, was released in September 2006. It is a remake of the popular video game Pac-Man, except the player controls Wee Bull, who attempts to steal all of the pies belonging to Weebl, Bob, Hairy Lee and Chris the Ninja Pirate Mushroom. While doing so, the characters will continuously say one-liners such as &quot;Nooooo! Not the pie‼&quot;, and &quot;Why aren&#x27;t I eating pies when I move?&quot;.

===Episode structure===
The two main characters appear exclusively in the first episode, and most of the later episodes. The cartoon is minimalistic in style: it is presented on a plain magenta background, and the characters are white with dark grey outlines. Most of the episodes – usually the more recent cartoons – begin with Weebl singing a short song, usually about pie, his main love in life (an example of this &quot;This is a song/a song about pie/hope I get some before I die..&quot;). Bob moves on and off by rolling and remains typically to the right of the animation pane.

Both characters talk, but their voices are usually unintelligible. Picking achieves the sound by speaking without the use of his tongue, and constantly changing the speed of the audio recording; speech balloons are provided. In fact, in the episodes &quot;Asshat&quot; and &quot;Stains&quot;, it is implied that this is the only reason they can understand each other. This speech is generally punctuated, but capitals are not used, correct grammar and syntax are rarely employed (e.g. &quot;when come back bring pie!&quot;), and the speech bubbles are occasionally entirely inaccurate; another feature is the occasional addition of an &#x27;s&#x27; to nouns or verbs that do not require one (e.g. &quot;beefs come from here&quot;, or &quot;I have become a Goths&quot; &quot;Is that rights?&quot;).

The episodes are set to music (usually of the dance/electronica genre, though it differs considerably between episodes), with the characters sometimes talking in time to the rhythm. Earlier episodes mainly used songs from Picking&#x27;s music collection, but nowadays they are usually original pieces (sometimes listed in the credits).

=== Characters ===

==== Weebl Bull ====
Weebl, or Wobbl on MTV due to trademark reasons, is 29 years old (&quot;Factor&quot;) and is an egg-shaped character who loves pie to a very unhealthy extent. This is especially apparent as, in a reference to the film &quot;American Pie&quot; Weebl&#x27;s other friends aside from Bob are a whale, who has only been shown in &quot;Blockage&quot; and a Weighted Companion Cube (a reference to Portal) only seen in &quot;Cube&quot;. Weebl has shown romantic fixation towards Donkey, as well as a-ha&#x27;s Morten Harket (who &quot;makes [Weebl] moist in [his] special places&quot;).

Even though Weebl&#x27;s name is Weebl Bull, as he is Wee Bull&#x27;s son, he usually uses the surname Chauncey, probably because he hates his father (despite this, however, he has been credited as Weebl Bull in the episode &quot;CSI&quot;), he was also credited as prof. Heinz Weebl Ph.D on &quot;show&quot;. He also show signs of being illiterate (though this is probably just to make his ignorance and unintelligence more clear) as he cannot read (as seen in &quot;Record&quot; and &quot;Pastry&quot;) and, according to Bob, can only spell &quot;sign&quot; and &quot;beefs&quot; (&quot;Pikea&quot;). A little while after Bob made his blog, Weebl made his blog.

Weebl can be immature and arrogant in most parts, as in the cartoon &quot;Team Laser Explosion 3&quot; he boasted what a hero he was by accusing postmen of being evil, and also being apparently stubborn, he insisted on changing the team logo because it didn&#x27;t have pictures of him looking hot and sexy. He has at least 5 hats (revealed in &quot;Pastry&quot;). Also he is ignorant to listen to Bob such as in the episode &#x27;snails&#x27; where he shows that he doesn&#x27;t listen to Bob or let him finish his sentences. To add to that he has been in and caused Bob to go to prison with his &quot;Paris Hilton&quot; impression as shown in episode &quot;Bird&quot;

His last name was not revealed till the episode &#x27;CSI&#x27;, in which a set of opening credits reveal it, though a smart fan could have deduced it from Weebl&#x27;s father&#x27;s name, Wee Bull, or from a supposed e-mail with the subject &quot;Son. We need to talk. Love Wee Bull&quot;.

In various episodes Weebl states that he cannot move, unlike Bob who rolls or hops to get to places. He can only be seen rolling in the Wobbl and Bob DVD, during the cutscenes when a category is selected in the menu screen. Otherwise, it remains a mystery of how he moves, although Bob uses methods of transport to carry him around in several episodes, it says that Weebl invented sheep especially on the episode &#x27;gravy&#x27;.

==== Bob Bobertson ====
Bob is Weebl&#x27;s friend, and producer of many Flash animations throughout the series. He looks like Weebl except for the fact that he is smaller. Like Weebl, he also likes pie – and &#x27;butters&#x27; [sic] (see episode &quot;Pikea&quot;). His last name, Bobertson, is revealed in &quot;Show,&quot; and is shown again in &quot;Team Laser Explosion 3&quot;, when Weebl draws their new logo on the back of Bob&#x27;s will. His last name can also be seen in the credits of some of the &quot;made by Bob&quot; cartoons and on his blog. Bob also became a goth (because he was depressed about not having pie, and he found the cloak and the wig in a ditch) in the episode &quot;Gothic&quot; but that lasted only for that episode. During that episode he called himself &quot;Bob... Lord of the Dark... things&quot;.

Bob seems to show a fear of bees and, after Weebl&#x27;s bath water destroyed his computer in &quot;Upgrade&quot;, a fear of liquid. He is also allergic to cat fur (&quot;Dan&quot;), as characterized by pink spots, red eyes, and huge swelling lumps on his head. His new computer is apparently possessed by – and has affiliations with – the supernatural, as it gets demonic messages, shoots blood from the screen, makes groaning noises and came with an Angel of Death and an evil lamp (the reason being that &#x27;Pissy Werld&#x27;, the place from which it was purchased, is owned by a demon).

In the episode &quot;Joust&quot;, we are told that Bob was once married, to a &quot;Millionaire Supermodel Scientist,&quot; but Weebl destroyed the marriage with his constant demands for a duel. We are also told that his wife lost a toe in the duel, and that Bob retained the &quot;zombie toe,&quot; until that, too, left him. Bob also frequently visits a book club, and it is evident that he has not yet reached puberty (&quot;Pikea 2&quot;). Bob also knows nothing about farming emu.

Bob often questions and pities Weebl&#x27;s strange ways, though Bob himself does sometimes show a perverted nature, as seen on in &quot;Pieku&quot;, when he admitted he wasn&#x27;t wearing pants, and said &quot;lo! meet my penis!&quot; This, however, turned out to actually be &quot;pianist&quot;, as Weebl misheard Bob. Bob is also known to be slightly more intelligent than Weebl, often correcting or lecturing him. He dislikes bananas, shown in &quot;Romantic&quot;.

==== Regulars ====
&quot;These characters have appeared regularly throughout the series, and are usually older than the rest of the cast.&quot;

* Chris the Ninja Pirate – A mushroom who is an expert at martial arts, and who speaks and acts like a cross between a ninja and a pirate, and has been known to say &quot;Shiver-me shurikens!&quot;. First appeared in &quot;Yarr&quot;. He wears an eyepatch in normal clothing, but has been wearing a black ninja costume (which Sensei Carrotu thinks is &quot;very sexy&quot;) in recent episodes. After Donkey&#x27;s death, he went mad with grief, writing &quot;why?&quot; on the walls in feces and sculpting a model of Donkey out of his earwax. Now, whilst he seems to have mostly gotten over the death of his wife, he still apparently drinks a lot and thus his one visible eye has bags under it. He moved on in &#x27;Begins&#x27;, the latest Weebl and Bob, where he fell in love with Weebl&#x27;s mother, and was set to marry her, but ended up wedding Donkey&#x27;s alternate dimensional self.
* Donkey – Recently deceased spouse to Chris the Ninja Pirate who resembles a rocking horse. Was originally Weebl&#x27;s girlfriend until Chris stole her from him in &quot;Wrong&quot;. Her death was shown in the 100th episode after suffering from a serious accident as a result of both herself and Chris, in his words, &quot;doing position 97 near a porthole&quot;. In the same episode, Donkey said her only word: &quot;minge&quot; (about which Weebl and Bob speculate on what she could have meant, &quot;à la&quot; &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;; however, Chris proves that she just &quot;likes to swear like a fishwife&quot;). Her demise is more somber than the comedic deaths of some of the other characters, leading to a somewhat depressing funeral and, in &quot;Intervention&quot;, making Chris go insane with grief. Two days after episode 100 was released, Weebls-Stuff.com brought out a special T-shirt dedicated to Donkey reading &quot;Donkey 2002–2006. Rock in peace&quot;. Donkey has since been listed as a cast member in the credits of &quot;Goo-lien&quot;, although she did not appear in the episode. She makes a return in Body, just her bottom part appears though, and Weebl&#x27;s Mummy said that she chewed off Donkey&#x27;s head to make room.
* Hairy Lee – A hairy version of Weebl and an expert on hypnotism. He is probably a caveman, which would explain the hair and the fact he usually talks in grunts. First appeared in &quot;Hairy&quot;. Known as &quot;Baldie Lee&quot; in the 1980s prior to an overdose on cheese. However, prior to and following this event, he looked about the same. He may have just seemed bald in comparison with Weebl and Bob&#x27;s mullets, which were inexplicably destroyed near the end of the episode. This could be the reason as to why his name may be a play on words of the British soft cheese brand &quot;Dairylea&quot;. He played a female dancer&#x27;s &quot;Left Bum Cheek&quot; in DJ Pie Safety&#x27;s music video in &quot;DJ&quot;.
* Wee Bull – A bull, also Weebl&#x27;s arch-nemesis, and, revealed in &quot;Bull&quot;, his father. His name is a play on the word Weebl. Always seems to win every battle – apart from a Christmas short – against Weebl, who states &quot;damn you wee bull. you win this time&quot;. Popular with the ladies. Possibly descended from Wee Mammoth, he always talks by snorting. No words are formed, but everyone seems to understand him, much like Weebl&#x27;s and Bob&#x27;s slurred speech. He still loves Weebl however, and wants to talk, according to the subject line of an E-Mail he sends in the recent episode &#x27;Email&#x27; (&quot;Son, We Need To Talk. Love Wee Bull&quot;).
* The Monkey – A monkey bought by Weebl in &quot;Cleaner&quot;. He is best known for his posh accent and pooping everywhere. In the episodes &quot;Anywhere&quot; and &quot;Anyhoo&quot;, he boasts that he can go anywhere and is unstoppable, but in &quot;Anyhoo&quot; Bob is correct when he suggests surrounding monkey with toilets, as that is what he notorious for not using. This could be in relation to the fact that monkeys cannot be house-trained. Major appearances include &quot;Anywhere&quot; &quot;Anyhoo&quot; and &quot;Team Laser Explosion&quot; (in the latter, he plays the main villains). He has been regularly shown wearing a large foam &quot;We am de best&quot; cowboy hat. Monkey appears as the Grim Reaper (in his own words &quot;Death, stealer of pie&quot;) in the episodes &quot;Art&quot; and &quot;Halloween&quot;. He also portrays Santa Claus in an advent calendar short, as well as all the known villains of Team Laser Explosion. It was revealed in &quot;History 1&quot; that his ability to speak English was caused by touching a large black monolith with his tail (a reference to the film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;). However, since the &quot;History&quot; series isn&#x27;t necessarily part of the show&#x27;s continuity, this could be false.
* The Jams – Jam jars who try to overthrow the government and fight for freedom, though not very successfully. First appeared in &quot;Wrong&quot;, in which they distracted Weebl in order for Chris the Ninja Pirate to steal Donkey. Probably based on the popular band The KLF (also known as the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu — the JAMs), as they share the name and are a tad revolutionary, spreading political messages through music.

==== Major and popular characters ====
&quot;These characters shown below have been seen semi-regularly or been praised by fans.&quot;

* Angry Paul – Bob&#x27;s spoiled child, and the only character who dislikes pie. Blew up &quot;like a little firework&quot; after drinking too much of his Sunny Delight in &quot;Angry&quot;. Now he lives in a secret lab – located at 21 Wigmore Street – inside a strange machine that keeps him alive.
* Angry Pierre – Bob&#x27;s cousin and the French version of Angry Paul. Died from his family curse (spilling Orangina) in &quot;Bob&#x27;s Week in France Part 5&quot;.
* The Mysterious Chicken – A hovering roast chicken who dons sunglasses and has the mysterious powers of dancing and hiding things. He appeared mostly in older episodes but was seen recently as an employee of &quot;Pissy Werld&quot; and in the episode &quot;Changed&quot;, and the latest episode &quot;L.O.S.T&quot;. He sometimes is mistaken for a turkey, but then says &quot;I&#x27;m not a turkey, I&#x27;m a chicken.&quot; His parallel universe version is known as &quot;obvious chicken&quot;.
* Hand Boy – A talking hand, who was once involved with the police to help stop The Jams&#x27; protest. Beat off the monkey in the MTV episode &quot;Sex 1&quot;.
* Shopkeep – Northern-accented shopkeeper who appears in almost any shop that Weebl or Bob enter, although it is debatable whether all the appearances are the same person, or just happen to look and sound the same. Sports a top hat, a large moustache and square glasses. Appears in non shop-related roles in the episodes &quot;100&quot;, and &quot;The history of the world according to Weebl and Bob – the Industrial Revolution&quot;, pulling the &quot;porta-door 2000&quot; and inventing the steam engine respectively.
* Clive – TV face. Like Shopkeep, he has appeared in various roles. He speaks with an American accent (ironically, most Americans consider Clive a distinctly British name). Weebl referred to him as James in &quot;Chat&quot;, a possible reference to Clive James.
* Kevin – French stripper who stalks Bob, and stole one of Bob&#x27;s kidneys in &quot;Bob&#x27;s Week in France Part 3&quot;. Also claims he has &quot;a big willy&quot; and says he &quot;loves&quot; Bob. Disguised himself as a twig in &quot;Awards&quot;. Despite only having been seen three times, he is usually mentioned by Weebl (who he apparently knows) to annoy/ridicule Bob, as seen in &quot;Sweet&quot;.
* Vibro Egg – Father to the Mysterious Chicken, the Vibro Egg looks like a fried egg. He is self-proclaimed &quot;destroyer of worlds&quot; and &quot;breaker of hearts&quot;. He first appeared in the episode &quot;Egg,&quot; where he was struck by lightning (it&#x27;s dangerous to hold meetings near electric pylons). He returned in &quot;Joust 2&quot; as the blind (He doesn&#x27;t know why, it was a &quot;mysterious accident&quot;, but in reality was the lightning.) &quot;Eggsy Bit&quot; (a nod to &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot; host/rapper Xzibit), where he helped to &#x27;pimp&#x27; Bob&#x27;s car (improve it), sporting a tag reading &quot;Jim fixed it for me&quot; around his neck. Is seriously injured (and possibly killed) by Hairy Jam in the same episode.
* Bubble Boy – An odd-looking boy who appeared in &quot;Germs&quot; and lived in a bouncing bubble. He died by flooding his bubble with his own urine and subsequently drowning. (He refused to leave his bubble even while it was flooding because he was afraid of &quot;the germs !! &quot;) Luckily, he lived for a Weebl and Bob advent calendar cartoon, but was still bacteriophobic. He later appeared in a Christmas short. Bubble Boy is a reference to Blair Hayes&#x27; film, &quot;Bubble Boy&quot;, a comedy about a young man who was born without an immune system and has to live in a large plastic bubble to protect himself from germs.
* Apple Dave – A very strange rock star with the head of an apple. He likes to &quot;make your mum horny&quot;. He usually makes an appearance in order for Weebl to avoid answering a difficult/unexplanatory question. Apparently, Bob has no idea who he is, Weebl&#x27;s only spoke of him in the first place to change the subject of why he didn&#x27;t have a tan where a bikini top would be.
* The Wasp aka George W. Buzz – A wasp who originally appeared in the episode &quot;Sweet&quot;. Attempted to steal Weebl&#x27;s sugar lump posing first as Weebl and Bob&#x27;s neighbour, then as Bob&#x27;s uncle, and finally as &quot;a president&quot; of the unnamed country in which the animation is set.
* The Childs – Several Weeblesque children who appear regularly in the Weebl and Bob universe. They will follow whatever Hairy Lee says due to his powers of hypnotism. (As Weebl says, &quot;Kids will do anything for Hairy Lee!&quot; - a reference to the ads for Dairylea cheese, which assert that &quot;Kids will do anything for Dairylea!&quot;)
* DJ Pie Safety – A hip-hop rapper/DJ who teaches pie safety through song, such as waiting for the pie to cool down before eating it. A human character, portrayed by Jonti Picking himself.

==== Others ====
&quot;These characters have only appeared in just one or a few episodes.&quot;

* Hairy Jam – Jam jar mechanic, also called &quot;Damaged Jam&quot; in the Goovies. However, he is not good at his job, as his lack of mechanical skills and carelessness with tools always seem to get his customers killed/seriously injured. Does not seem to take interest in the other Jams&#x27; rebellion against the government, but has an obsession with baked beans, which, he claims, &quot;everyone loves&quot;. Like Hairy Lee, he is hairy all over. First appeared in &quot;Band&quot;, where he killed off three Jams, stating that he is high. Believes that hitting a car repeatedly with a hammer and filling it with beans gives the best cleaning results. Last seen as an employee at Pissy Werld (wearing a Tesco Value label), along with Shopkeep, The Mysterious Chicken and The Captain of the Farm.
* Elvis – A mysterious character who is two thirds donkey while the last third is &quot;mostly Elvis&quot;. Has appeared in two episodes, &quot;Elvis&quot; and &quot;Awards&quot;. Likes to say &quot;uh-huh-huh!&quot; Weebl finds himself physically attracted to Elvis, except for the face.
* Ladies – Female Weeblesque characters, only a bit smaller (bigger than Bob, though). They like shoes, pretty dresses, and Wee Bull (but mostly shoes). As for Weebl, they think he&#x27;s a pig.
* Banana – An enormous hallucinational, floating, sentient banana, usually appearing when other characters are under the influence of mind-altering substances. The Banana has commanded Weebl to do things against his will, often with comedic consequences.
* The Captain of the Farm – A fly who claims to be the captain of a farm floating on water. His first appearance was in &quot;Captain&quot;, He was previously angered when Weebl refused to recognize his authority. He has a sidekick called Horse (although the name could be false), who has a habit of popping up surprisingly from the corner of the screen whenever needed. Likes turd-based foods, as seen in the episode &quot;get well&quot; which is unfortunately a preference not shared by his crew. He was also seen in the episode &quot;upgrade pt2&quot; as an employee in &quot;Pissy Werld&quot;.
* The Lemon Curds – The law enforcement responsible for stopping The Jams&#x27; revolts. Their motto is &quot;to protect and serve&quot;, despite the fact that it is &quot;not very catchy&quot; and (their words) &quot;prefer the scout one&quot;.
* Hank – A talking pear who was hired to design the new Team Laser Explosion logo in &quot;Team Laser Explosion 3&quot;. However, his design was rejected by Weebl because he made Weebl feel bad, so Weebl&#x27;s own less-than-professional logo was used (however, Hank&#x27;s design was used as the TLE logo in &quot;Team Laser Explosion 4&quot;, which meant Weebl really liked it). Hank had his second appearance in the next episode, &quot;Get Well,&quot; a non-TLE episode. Weebl&#x27;s criticism makes Hank suicidal, and he tries to kill himself in both of the episodes in which he appears, but he never manages it; the first time he doesn&#x27;t fall far enough, and the second time his fall is broken by a pie. He was last seen as a mourner at Donkey&#x27;s funeral. He replaces most of his consonants with a &#x27;bl&#x27; sound.
* The Mexican – A sombrero-wearer with a Yorkshire accent who calls Bob a &quot;daft bugger&quot; in the first &quot;Bob&#x27;s Week in France&quot; episode. Won the award for best pie lover in the world &quot;...ever!&quot;. He also worked on Chris&#x27;s ship on Christmas 4. He is the only character other than Weebl who calls Bob &quot;wanker&quot;.
* Mr. Teeth – Appeared in the episode &quot;Wedding&quot; in which he was the fake vicar for Chris the Ninja Pirate and Donkey&#x27;s wedding, and in &quot;Funeral&quot;, leading Donkey&#x27;s memorial service. He is actually a dentist.
* Sensei Carrotu – Chris the Ninja Pirate&#x27;s former martial arts trainer, a floating carrot with a sweatband above his eyes. First appeared (and died in a &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; accident) in &quot;Quest&quot;. He apparently likes to see Chris the Ninja Pirate in his ninja suit, as he claims that it is &quot;very sexy&quot;.
* Holy Strawberry – The Jams&#x27; deceased mother. She is shown in the episode &quot;Hostage&quot;.
* Corn Guy – One of the people involved in the &quot;Pikea&quot; traffic jam. He was turned into popcorn later in the episode when the sun came out.
* Blind Date – The that Weebl arranges for Bob to cheer him up in &quot;Date&quot;. In the episode, Bob is not aware that his blind date is a literal blind date (who is dyslexic), until he meets his date. Blind Date is one of the few characters who opens their mouths while speaking.
* Thor – Also evidence of the Blind Date&#x27;s dyslexia, as the visually impaired typically use guide dogs [&quot;dog&quot; being &quot;god&quot; backwards].
* Birthday Fairy – A drunken fairy who shows up once a year to wish Jonti a happy birthday. Created by BlueHippo of the Weebl and Bob forums. The Birthday Fairy has appeared in the episodes &quot;Birthday Wishes&quot; and &quot;Thirty&quot;.
* Norris – A character in the episode &quot;Record&quot; who cannot be seen, but who keeps track of how many times Weebl has said &quot;toot&quot;. A reference to the founder of The Guinness Book of Records, the late Norris McWhirter.
* Cows – Several, identical cows, only appeared in one episode, &quot;Cows&quot;. According to Weebl &quot;Cows make the beef&quot;. When asked how, he answers he doesn&#x27;t know, but &quot;maybe, they are magic!&quot;. &quot;Beef Magic!&quot; &quot;Moodoo!&quot;. As one bit Bob, Weebl told him to &quot;Suck out the poison, quick!&quot;
* Evil Clown – A sinister clown who tells the viewers in an eerie voice to look at his &quot;lovely&quot; hat. He is surprised by the appearance of the banana, who thinks the hat is a fine one.
* Zombito – The remainder of Bob&#x27;s wife (a toe) after Weebl challenged her to a duel. It now belongs to Hand Boy.
* Pianist – Weebl is shocked when Bob introduces him, but only because he heard &quot;penis&quot; rather than &quot;pianist&quot; (and, indeed, this is what is written in Bob&#x27;s speech bubble). He can&#x27;t actually play so he just hums the tune.
* Manager – Appeared in &quot;Upgrade Pt2&quot;. He is the demon manager of &#x27;Pissy Werld&#x27;. He never speaks, but instead hisses, as wispy smoke comes out of his eyes. All the other employees of Pissy Werld seem to be afraid of him, as they run away when he comes in.
* Donkey Kong – A large, pixelated version of the famous video game character, who happens to be Donkey&#x27;s father, as revealed in the &quot;Funeral&quot; episode. Weebl and Bob are confused about his species, but Chris confirms that &quot;he doesn&#x27;t like to talk about it&quot;.
* Michael Moore – A large blob animated version of Michael Moore. Appeared at the end of &quot;Politics&quot;; a movie that Bob made for him.
* Stephen Hawking- An animated version of theoretical physicist, Stephen Hawking. His first appearance was in &quot;Balance&quot;, when he slid across the floor in his wheelchair once Bob slanted it with his weight. He claims that his brakes &quot;really suck&quot;. This is a possible reference to &quot;The Yard&quot;, a fan-made parody of the popular British kid&#x27;s show &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends&quot;. Additionally, he had a brief moment of ridicule from Weebl when he started typing rude words on his keyboard (&quot;Poo poo willy bums arses&quot;), random letters, and finally typing &quot;I&#x27;ve wet my pants&quot;.
* Barry Scott – Advertising &quot;Cillit Bang Pie Remover&quot; in &quot;Stains&quot; Apparently, he has a &quot;nice shiny tuppence!&quot;
* Cigar Man – Often appears in Bob&#x27;s cartoons, distinguished by a top hat and a monocle. Often burns people with his cigar (apparently much to his content), as seen in &quot;Ghosts&quot;, &quot;Doods&quot; and &quot;Colds&quot;.
* The Beggar – Lives in Chris The Ninja Pirate&#x27;s house. He believes that &quot;owls are made of the bits left over when they make toilet seats&quot;.
* The Emailman – Explains, through the gift of song, what the &#x27;e&#x27; stands for in &#x27;email&#x27;. He looks like Postman Pat, and is one of the only Weebl and Bob characters drawn with colour. Apparently he is &quot;not to be trusted. He&#x27;s just a disgruntled Postman&quot;.
* Sean Harris – Emails Weebl asking for a character with his name to be in the show. His voice is heard offscreen, and Weebl and Bob tell him that he &quot;has problems&quot;, after he wet himself &quot;again&quot;, no one likes him because &quot;he smells of the wee&quot; and ugly. Could possibly be a reference to the lead singer of British metal band Diamond Head, but this is impossible to verify.
* Weebl and Bob before 1984 – The episode &quot;Cheese&quot; shows Weebl and Bob before 1984. Weebl and Bob were much different in these ways; they both had mullets, Bob was much larger and they were intelligible. Weebl&#x27;s yo-yo string had broken, and they needed something to do. They called their friend, Baldy Lee, who is Hairy Lee and still has hair, and brings cheese with him, which in the video is shown as a profane item, or a drug. All three of them eat the cheese, and seem fine at first and dance to the Chicken Dance. The next day Weebl and Bob turn into what we know of them today.
* Walrus – The Walrus that Weebl and Bob hit in the episode &quot;Pastry&quot;. The only thing he says is &quot;Ooh, me mansacks&quot;.
* Hambo – Appears in the Bob cartoons &quot;Hams&quot;, &quot;Colds&quot; and &quot;Restrooms&quot;, he constantly throws hams at people in order to cure them of their vegetarianism. He has a bandana round his head, possibly meaning his name is a pun on &quot;Rambo&quot;.
* Alternate Universe Weebl &amp; Bob – Accessible through the trans-dimensional portal under the stairs. Differentiated from Weebl &amp; Bob by their stylish hats, goatees, mountains of pie, and the fact that their speech is backmasked. Alternate Universe Bob is enrolled in Pastry Assassination classes.
* Dan De Zille – The disembodied head of a real person named Dan De Zille, incarnated as an extraterrestrial rocket ship. This &quot;character&quot; is unique as Dan bid his way onto the episode by ways of an eBay auction, with all profits going to charity. The winning bid was for the generous sum of £1,750 (About $3,500 USD). Dan appears in the appropriately named episode: &quot;Dan&quot;
* Spa Secretary- A female secretary for the spa. She has large breasts that Bob was hiding in. From the toon &quot;Spa&quot;.
* Dishonest Jim- He is never to be trusted. from the toon &quot;Snails&quot;.
* Hopey McChange-Pants- A politician in the land where Weebl and Bob takes place, inferred to be inclined for hope and change. Weebl doesn&#x27;t like him, but Bob does. Was on the cover of magazine &quot;Meat-Eaters Monthly&quot;. Was revealed to have been elected in the episode &quot;Begins&quot;.
* Oldy McDodderington- The candidate running against Hopey McChange-Pants. Is known for being senile, stupid, lying, and wetting himself. Lost to McChange-Pants.
* Mrs. Titty McGee- Old McDodderington&#x27;s running mate. Has brown hair, wears glasses, and &quot;fun bags&quot;.
* Mr. Poop-On-A-Stick- The mascot for Butch Man&#x27;s Knowledge College.
* Weebl&#x27;s Mummy- Appears in Petition, buried in concrete and wrapped in chains. She leaves jail, but just her top part. Returns in Body.

==== Team Laser Explosion characters ====
&quot;These characters are seen only in the &quot;Team Laser Explosion&quot; episodes.&quot;

* Team Laser Explosion – Weebl and Bob&#x27;s super alter-egos. Have their own Secret Fan Club. Weebl is Captain Laserous Explosion, and Bob is Boy Exploserous Laser. Both wield the much-feared Laser Pelvis Attack belt, which is also available to members of the Secret Fan Club. Their battle cry is &quot;to the skies!&quot;.
* Mayor Haggar – The Mayor, who appears as a sprite of Mike Haggar from &quot;Final Fight&quot;.
* Fire Thunder Squad – Team Laser Explosion&#x27;s arch enemies. Their members are Captain Thunderous Fire (Monkey) and The Pigeon (a pigeon). Bob believes that their logo is better than that of Team Laser Explosion. Their attacks include the self-explanatory Projectile Fire Breath, The Pigeon&#x27;s Double Poop combo attack, and very powerful Thunder Hat Wobble attack (which requires the user to be wearing a hat.)
* Sarcasm Stealth Squad – More enemies of Team Laser Explosion, known for filling the town pool with fish heads. Their members are El Sharp Tongue (Monkey again) and A Book (a book about sidekicks). A Book was killed by Weebl the day before its evil retirement. They have a better logo than Team Laser Explosion.
* Apple Squad – Appearing in the fourth Team Laser Explosion episode, this squad of villains references Apple Inc. The villains are Lord iEvil (not surprisingly, Monkey again) and a &quot;tiny, harmless&quot; iPod which can transform into a giant robot (unless the hold button is on). However, they were defeated by Bob&#x27;s &quot;Giant Denim Pocket Attack&quot; (encasing them in a giant blue denim pocket) causing the robot to scratch. Unfortunately, Lord iEvil couldn&#x27;t take it back because Weebl removed the warranty sticker, rendering it void.
* Napalm Waitress Force – Referred to by Weebl, but never physically seen, in the first Team Laser Explosion episode, when Bob remarks &quot;We live to serve&quot;. Weebl claims, &quot;No, that&#x27;s Napalm Waitress Force&quot;.
* Irony Force 5 – Their job is to make the hunter become the hunted.
* No Depth Perception Crew – Appearing in the fifth installment of Team Laser Explosion, their members include Lord Can&#x27;t See-a-lot (Monkey) and a pier arcade machine. Notorious for kidnapping the town&#x27;s cats and placing them in Bonsai trees (Lord Can&#x27;t See-a-lot believed the trees to be much bigger than they were, and also a lot further away). Foiled by Burly arcade worker man after setting off the anti-tamper device on the pier arcade machine.

==== Goo-ology ====
&quot;Goo-ology&quot; was a series of promotional shorts for Cadbury&#x27;s Creme Egg, parodying pivotal scenes from cult movies (&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein&quot;). This was followed by a similar segment entitled &quot;Goo&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, a parody of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; in which the winner was determined by a vote on YouTube.
* Creme Eggs – The creme eggs appear in the special creme egg episodes. They often play the bad guys and, as with the ad campaign, show excitement over being &#x27;gooed&#x27;.
* Twisted Bar – A monster created from deceased Creme Eggs to celebrate the release of the Creme Egg Twisted Bar.

== Reception ==
&quot;Weebl and Bob&quot; was &quot;one of the most popular ongoing series&quot; according to The &quot;Spokesman-Review&quot; in 2006 and the two characters were later dubbed &quot;online animation superstars&quot;

The series was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as follows: &quot;Another British creation Weebl and Bob are two wobbly eggs who like pie. That set-up took the animation through over 100 episodes, onto MTV in a series of licensed indents, and a made for DVD special.&quot;, while Screen Rant commented: &quot;The legs on this abstract series about 2 egg things with &quot;South Park&quot; Canadian style mouths who like pie were impressive. It was just as random and silly, but much more laid back than most other &#x27;random&#x27; comedies, with long aired out dialogue scenes, idly mumbling about pie, or other things, sometimes just gibberish. It was funny and full of charm and made for a unique watch.As the series continued &quot;Weebl and Bob&quot; got more ambitious, with the likes of their &quot;Sexyback&quot; and &quot;Portal&quot; parodies, as they were forced to compete with rivals from their own website, which was growing in notoriety thanks to a certain animal and a certain fungus...&quot;

<text>Datapoint Corporation, originally known as Computer Terminal Corporation (CTC), was a computer company based in San Antonio, Texas, United States. Founded in July 1968 by Phil Ray and Gus Roche, its first products were, as the company&#x27;s initial name suggests, computer terminals intended to replace Teletype machines connected to time sharing systems.

==Background==
From the mid-1960s, engineers (John) Phil Ray and Austin O. &quot;Gus&quot; Roche were working for General Dynamics Dynatronic Division in Florida, as part of a computing contract team for NASA working on the Apollo programme. At the time, mainframe computers were large room-filling pieces of equipment, from which data was output using noisy and slow Teletype terminals. On the advice of one of his tutors from the University of Texas, Ray and Roche decided to develop a quieter and smaller input device based on using a television set screen.

==Early history==
After finding San Antonio, Texas based backers, the pair incorporated Computer Terminal Corporation (CTC) there in July 1968. Based on a newly developed Texas Instruments chip, with a casing designed by an industrial designer in New York City, the company had developed three prototype Datapoint 3300 (deriving the name from the popular Teletype Model 33 teleprinter), it was an immediate hit at that year&#x27;s computer show.

However, the resultant orders left the company with several major problems: they had no production capacity, and no money with which to build a factory. In October 1969, the company raised US$4 million through an initial public offering (IPO). This enabled them to outsource production short term to a series of local manufacturers, including a motorcycle helmet manufacturer, before constructing their own manufacturing premises. Once in production, they began sourcing chips from both TI and Intel, running up large debts from both.

The Datapoint 3300 sold very successfully for a number of years. It was later rebadged as the DEC VT06 and the HP 2600A.

==Datapoint 2200 and the Intel 8008==
Having raised $4 million in an IPO in August 1969, selling over the counter for $8, by August 1970 the shares were selling at $45.

Ray and Roche wanted to develop a new, more intelligent terminal, and employed a trio of engineers who knew each other from their interests in amateur radio: Victor Poor, Harry Pyle and undergraduate Jonathan Schmidt. The company began development on the Datapoint 2200, its most popular product and credited by some historians as the invention of the personal computer.

While working his notice from Maryland-based Frederick Electronics during the 1969 Thanksgiving holiday, Poor and Pyle developed the underlying instruction set architecture of the processor on a living room floor. This enabled Phil Ray and Gus Roche to design and develop the mass-produced programmable 2200, which could load various emulations stored on cassette tapes. Some users of the terminals chose to use them as simple programmable computers instead.

The original 2200 processor board was a serial design using standard TTL and Intel shift registers for memory. 

In December 1969 Poor joined CTC as Technical Director, employing Pyle within his team and sponsoring Schmidt through his degree.

CTC did not believe it could meet its design goals for the CPU built from discrete TTL chips. Ray and Roche asked how much of their design could fit onto a microprocessor chip. Poor and Pyle developed a project that would cost $100,000 to place their architecture onto silicon and into production.

Ray and Roche arranged dinner with Robert Noyce, the President of Intel, along with the President of Texas Instruments. Having pre-drawn the schematic for the microprocessor on two postcards, Ray gave one to each of his guests, and then made a bet: that the first company to build a computer on a chip (microprocessor) would forgive Datapoint their outstanding invoice. In part this was fiscally driven, as both supplier debts were large, and the annulment of either would mean that CTC could avoid a follow-on offering. Noyce initially questioned the approach, suggesting that development of the microprocessor would reduce Intel&#x27;s sales of their dumb shift registers, but eventually agreed to the deal.

The result was the development of the Intel 8008 microprocessor by Ted Hoff and Stan Mazor of Intel. This design was rejected by Datapoint management, when the demonstration version was not performant and Intel could not meet Datapoint&#x27;s product launch date. Consequently, the 2200 was released using the conventional SSI/MSI chip technology of the time. Datapoint continued to produce processors that went into the Datapoint 6600 around 1982 and later series.

Thus, today&#x27;s overwhelmingly dominant instruction set architecture, used in Intel&#x27;s x86 family of processors as well as all compatible CPUs from AMD and others, traces its ancestry directly back to CTC. The 2200 had an optional disk drive using Shugart 8&quot; floppies, single-sided, single-density, and was the first commercial computer to include them.

The Datapoint 2200 became so popular that CTC later changed its name to Datapoint Corp.

At this time the 2200 processor also had access to an ARCNET card, contributed to by Victor Poor, now working for Datapoint. This was the first commercial local area network (LAN) card, with over ten thousand ARCNET LAN installations in use around the world. The ARCNET card in each 2200 allowed 2200&#x27;s running a program to access LAN-connected 2200s with attached storage (disk) or printers. This was the first true Distributed Processing over a LAN, as used in Australian Cotton (AusCot Syd), Commodities Trading Sydney, KPMG Sydney and many other small to medium-sized businesses. The LAN was later duplicated by IBM, Banyan, Novell and others using variants of media or methodology. In response, Datapoint offered the Token Ring LAN capability to Tandy for their TRS-80, but ARCNET never really gained any foothold again.

They then asked Schmidt to write the accompanying communications software.

In later years, after the death of John Phil Ray, his widow and fellow dinner guest Brenda Ray Coffee was deposed by Baker Botts, the attorneys for Texas Instruments, when TI and Intel were involved in their lawsuit as to which one &quot;invented&quot; the microprocessor.

==Boom period: 1973-1980==
Despite the success of the 2200, the company lacked the finances and skills to manage its own production, and was hence quickly running out of cash. After Ray and Roche investigated and then dismissed selling the company, they agreed to a deal to gain an investment from TRW. However, after realising that his company would be competing with major customer IBM, the President of TRW pulled out of the deal, and renegotiated it as the purchase of overseas manufacturing rights. Combined with other institutional share sales, this raised the required $7M to finance the development of a new product.

However, on investigative audit the new investors found that Datapoint&#x27;s corporate accounts hid various holes and challenges. After forcing the resignation of the company&#x27;s first chairman, San Antonio insurance salesman Gerald Mazur, they appointed Harold O&#x27;Kelley, who had an engineering background and had been a vice-president of the electronics firm Harris Corporation, and formally renamed the firm Datapoint.

O&#x27;Kelley immediately realised that the TRW deal was fatally flawed. Effectively, it allowed TRW to manufacture outside North America, but then import the product and sell directly against Datapoint in North America. After renegotiations, O&#x27;Kelley and TRW agreed a new contract which allowed TRW to market the product outside North America, but not to manufacture it. He then raised an additional $8 million via a third Wall Street-backed public offering, with a plan to raise sales from $18M to $100M within five years. As a result, under the chairmanship of O&#x27;Kelley, between 1973 and 1981, revenues grew at a 40% pace, with sales surpassing $100M in 1977, reaching $450M by 1981.

This growth was only enabled through the development of various products through the partnership between Ray, Roche, Poor and Pyle. These included Datashare, a concept that allowed many terminals to communicate with each other independent of a mainframe. In 1976, Datapoint introduced a machine that automatically routed outgoing telephone calls onto the cheapest available line, there by liberalising the US Telecoms market after the AT&amp;T breakup. It then introduced telephone directory software and word processing programs, as well as electronic mail functions.

Datapoint acquired pioneering hard disk drive manufacturer Data Disc in March 1977 for $2 million.

Other Datapoint inventions were ARCnet, invented in 1977, originally called ARC (Attached Resource Computer), which was an early token-passing local area network (LAN) protocol, and the PL/B high-level programming language, which was originally called &quot;Databus&quot; (from &quot;Datapoint business language&quot;) and ran under the &quot;Datashare&quot; multi-user interpreter. Later developments included a Mapped Intelligent Disc System (MIDS) which networked 2200 series terminals to a single mass storage disc operating system and enhanced Distributed Data Processing. Proprietary operating systems included DOS and RMS, and Datapoint later moved its hardware to be based on Intel 386 CPUs.

ARCnet was briefly superseded by ARCnetplus, which provided throughput of 20 Mbit/s and include options such as LiteLink which used infra-red technology to link systems in adjacent buildings. This was launched around the time 100 Mbit/s Ethernet arrived so never really took much market share, even though ARCnet used simple, slender co-axial cable, not Ethernet&#x27;s thick yellow cable, and despite having a slower transmission-speed had superior throughput, and was much simpler to configure and operate (servers could be connected and disconnected without taking the network down or reconfiguring).

Datapoint also developed and patented one of the earliest picture-in-picture implementations of videoconferencing called MINX (Multimedia Information Network eXchange). It was also part of the first video visitation and arraignment systems. It has been suggested they made more money from lawsuits over patent infringements than through sales of the product.

==Decline: 1980-1984==
By the early 1980s, Datapoint ranked as a Fortune 500 company. Lead times were extending rapidly as demand for Datapoint products increased, leading to delivery delays and unhappy customers. Pressure to increase sales led to some questionable orders being accepted. Compounding this, many of the orders were simply placed to guarantee availability of the product at a future point when it was expected that actual orders would be in place. When these actual orders never materialized, the excess capacity and inventories initiated a financial collapse. Additionally, some of the actual customers went broke before paying their bills due to the general business slowdown. Such factors forced Datapoint to reverse sales or to record substantial bad debts, which caused the company to lose $800 million of its market capitalization in a matter of a few months in early 1982. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ordered Datapoint to stop this practice.

After cancelling the ground breaking ceremony in a new headquarters building in March 1982, the factory in Waco, Texas, closed in early 1982, and all Waco production transferred to the newer Fort Worth factory. The Ft. Worth Factory closed in 1985 as the company continued in a virtual free-fall, leaving the San Antonio factory (aka &quot;9725&quot;) as the sole remaining factory in the US. Production shrank further and several San Antonio facilities were consolidated, with much factory space in 9725 being converted to offices to allow termination of office leases in the area. While numerous factory personnel moved from Waco to Ft. Worth, very few relocated from Ft. Worth to San Antonio, as the company was shrinking in size rapidly.

==Edelman takeover==
In December 1984, corporate raider Asher B. Edelman revealed that he had built up an 8% holding in Datapoint. In the same month Edelman offered $23 a share, or $416.3 million, to acquire the company. Datapoint&#x27;s board rejected the offer but began inviting takeover proposals from other interested parties. Edelman then withdrew his bid, and began directly seeking shareholders&#x27; consent to oust Datapoint&#x27;s board, replace them with his own designees and then sell the company to a third party or parties; his business takeover pattern deployed in other companies. Datapoint&#x27;s board resultantly changed the company&#x27;s bylaws to make the consent solicitation more difficult, a change Edelman later successfully blocked in court. In February 1985, Datapoint reported its predicted increased loss for the last quarter 1984, of $15.9 million. After a three-month fight, on March 16 the board of Datapoint agreed to restructure the company, led by the immediate resignation of O&#x27;Kelley and his replacement as chairman by Edelman, who dropped his legal challenges.

==Divestiture==
After the Edelman takeover, Datapoint spun off its service division into Intelogic Trace, Inc., which initially specialized in servicing Datapoint equipment but later broadened into supporting products from other vendors as well. Intelogic Trace declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and on April 6, 1995, its assets were sold to a company in Pennsylvania.

Datapoint itself weathered a subsequent battle for control of the company that triggered more attention from the SEC. In December 1999, all of Datapoint&#x27;s patented video communications technologies, along with all inventory and assets associated with the video business group was sold to one of its resellers, VUGATE. A handful of the loyal video group employees went to work for this company which was still selling the product as of 2021.

On May 3, 2000, Datapoint filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and was broken up:
*Datapoint UK Limited - on June 19, the company sold the Datapoint name and various operations to its European subsidiary for $49.3 million. The company changed its emphasis to call center equipment and largely pulled out of the computer market. Purchased by Alchemy Partners, in 2007 it acquired the assets of Touchbases&#x27; Avaya business to expand its footprint and extend into enterprise communications. Headquartered in Brentford, England, it has clients on 5,000 sites in 41 countries.
*Dynacore Holdings Corporation - on June 19, 2000, the remnant of Datapoint&#x27;s US operations changed its name to Dynacore Holdings Corporation and formed a subsidiary that pursued 14 lawsuits based on two patents granted to Datapoint regarding local area networks. With only $1.3 million left from the sale of its European operations after paying its debts and no products left to sell — its total revenues for the first half of 2001 dwindled to $9,000 and a year later fell to nothing — Dynacore searched for a company to buy. In February 2003, Dynacore engaged in a reverse takeover of The CattleSale Company. Asher Edelman now sits in CattleSale&#x27;s board of directors.
*Datapoint U.S.A., Inc. - in April 2003, Datapoint U.S.A., Inc. assumed control of all RMS Operating System based products from Datapoint Group(UK). Datapoint U.S.A., Inc. is based in San Antonio, TX and continues to provide RMS development, maintenance and support services to users worldwide. An office building and street in San Antonio still bear Datapoint&#x27;s name, but is not associated with the residual US company.

<text>A public health observatory is an organization or program that monitors and reports on the public health of a particular region or topic in order to inform health policy. Depending on the geographical area or focus of work, it may also be called a &quot;regional health observatory&quot;, &quot;urban health observatory&quot;, or &quot;national health observatory&quot;.

In 2016, a study in the &quot;European Journal of Public Health&quot; catalogued at least 150 public health observatories worldwide, and that their main functions were reporting on health, performing data analysis, and supporting evidence-based decision-making. A public health observatory does not generate primary data itself, and instead focuses on synthesizing and collecting existing data.

Environmental health, diet, recreation, outdoor education, exercise and other concerns are explored by some public health observatories.

== Examples ==

=== International ===
* The Global Health Observatory, established and operated by the World Health Organization (WHO).
* The Integrated African Health Observatory, also established and operated by the WHO.
* The European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies in Brussels.

=== Brazil ===
* The Observatory of Climate and Health (&quot;Observatório de Clima e Saúde&quot;) in Rio de Janeiro combines the monitoring of public health with monitoring of climate change and its effects.

=== France ===
The term is used in French (and has been since at least 1976) to denote any institution that compiles and presents data on a particular subject or for a particular area, generally established so that local or regional policymakers can make decisions with access to interpreted data appropriate to the scope of their geographical area. A survey in 1999 recorded that there were over 500 different observatories at the local, regional, and national levels, focusing on a variety of topics.
* The National Federation of Regional Health Observatories &quot;(FNORS - Fédération nationale des observatoires régionaux de la santé)&quot; has 16 member regional health observatories, or ORS &quot;(Observatoire regional de santé)&quot;.
* The first public health observatory in France, established in 1974, is the Regional Observatory of Health of Île-de-France (&quot;ORS d’Ile-de-France)&quot; in Paris. It is a member of FNORS.
* The Regional Observatory of Health for Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur in Marseille is a fully independent ORS.

=== Switzerland ===
* The Swiss Health Observatory (Obsan) in Neuchâtel is a joint project of the Swiss Federal Department of Home Affairs and the Conference of Cantonal Health Directors.

=== United Kingdom ===
From 1999 until 2013, there was a network of public health observatories in England until they were absorbed into Public Health England, which was itself moved into the UK Health Security Agency in 2021. There are currently operating health observatories in Wales and Scotland; there was at some point one in Ireland.

There are and were also some topic-specific observatories, such as the Child and Maternal Health Intelligence Network (ChiMat), still operating as of 2021; the Injury Observatory for Britain and Ireland (IOBI), the Mental Health Observatory, and the National Obesity Observatory are all no longer in operation.

The London Health Observatory pioneered methods in measuring social capital and how this affects healing and health in general.

<text>Says You! is a word game quiz show that airs weekly in the United States on public radio stations. Richard Sher created the show in 1996 with the guiding philosophy: &quot;It&#x27;s not important to KNOW the answers: it&#x27;s important to LIKE the answers.&quot; The first episode to broadcast on radio took place in Cambridge, Massachusetts in February 1997.

Recorded in front of live audiences in theaters around the United States, the show is produced in Boston, Massachusetts. Its format, emphasis on witty repartee, and its tagline—&quot;a game of bluff and bluster, words and whimsy&quot;—are reminiscent of the similarly long-running BBC program &quot;My Word!&quot; (1956–1990). The first ten seasons of &quot;Says You!&quot; aired in a half hour timeslot before expanding to one hour in 2006, though half hour versions were offered to stations who wanted them. Season 21 of &quot;Says You!&quot; marked the show&#x27;s 500th episode.

Richard Sher hosted &quot;Says You!&quot;&#x27;s first eighteen seasons, before his death on February 9, 2015. Original panelist Barry Nolan took over as host for the next two seasons, before returning to his seat as a panelist in early 2017. He was replaced as host by occasional panelist Gregg Porter of Seattle&#x27;s KUOW-FM, with author/public radio contributor Dave Zobel (who came on as a &quot;Says You!&quot; writer after Sher&#x27;s death) frequently guest hosting in 2018 and 2019 when Porter was absent or returning as a panelist. Porter left Says You! in the summer of 2019, with Zobel serving as permanent host until the end of season 25. Two final episodes hosted by former guest panelist Tom Bergeron and Richard Sher&#x27;s son Ben (who voiced the episode-ending Pipit &amp; Finch credit as a child and later served as a guest scorekeeper) were held in late 2022, but have yet to be posted online.

The COVID-19 pandemic forced taping for season 24 to conclude earlier than expected, with the last first-run episode with a live audience airing from Palo Alto, California on May 1, 2020. The remainder of the season and the entirety of season 25 consisted of new episodes recorded via Zoom or without a live audience, supplemented by reruns as well as 21 &quot;Back 9&quot; episodes, featuring nine rounds taken from three episodes apiece of early half-hour seasons. The final four first-run episodes featured a remote audience of ticket-buyers watching from home, with the last of these airing on August 13, 2021, with the season concluding primarily with &quot;Back 9&quot; re-airings. Stations that aired the half hour version of &quot;Says You!&quot; aired reruns from seasons 1–10 instead of &quot;Back 9&quot; episodes.

At the end of the 25th season, executive producer Laura Sher announced that production was ending and further seasons would consist of rebroadcasts. Seasons 26-27 aired from October 8th, 2021 until February 2023, primarily featuring episodes from the show&#x27;s eighth-twelfth seasons. Two final live episodes with studio audiences were held in Seattle &amp; San Francisco at the start of season 27, but have not been posted online. Starting on February 2023, &quot;Says You!&quot; episodes became exclusive to podcasting services, focusing on episodes from seasons 1-13. The show&#x27;s online store was closed in early 2024, and the last archival episode posted online was episode 33 of season 1 on June 28th, 2024.

Over 250 episodes can be heard for free on-demand via Public Radio Exchange, including all first-run and Back 9 episodes from seasons 18–25, and all of the succeeding seasons&#x27; reruns. Says You!&#x27;s website previously sold 370 episodes from seasons 1–6 and 11–20 in their online store, and episodes dating back to 2017 can be heard on major podcasting platforms.

== Format ==
The show features a regular group of panelists divided into two three-person teams. The two teams are made up of the show&#x27;s original cast members and (when necessary) occasional guest players. Teams answer a series of questions to earn up to 10 points for each correct—or humorously suitable—answer. As the host provides more clues, and/or panelists get extra help from their teammates, fewer points are awarded, while partially correct or objectively humorous responses may also receive lesser points. Score-keepers (usually children or teenagers) keep track of the score of each game. Despite the scoring, games do not have stakes beyond bragging rights, and ties (often the result of intentionally generous round 5 scoring) are not uncommon.

=== Rounds of the game ===
Rounds 1, 3, and 5 vary from week to week and consist of signature categories such as &quot;What&#x27;s the Difference?&quot;, &quot;Odd Man Out&quot;, &quot;Melded Movies&quot;, and &quot;Common Threads&quot;, as well as a variety of miscellaneous literary wordplay. Typically, six questions per round are asked, one aimed at each individual panelist, though assistance and interjections from their teammates are common. The host traditionally advises listeners to grab a pen &amp; paper to play along with the teams, as &quot;that&#x27;s how we do it here&quot;. On occasion, that week&#x27;s musical guest aids in a game themed around song lyrics, typically played as the final round. Some rounds reflected the culture, community names, and history of the location of that taping.

Rounds 2 and 4 are the Bluffing Rounds. Similar to the game show &quot;Liar&#x27;s Club&quot; and the radio show &quot;Call My Bluff&quot;, the three members of one team are given an obscure word (e.g. cacafuego); one of them gets the actual definition, and the other two must bluff with fake definitions composed during a brief musical interlude, traditionally provided by a live musical guest. The other team attempts to determine the correct definition from the three presented. Ten points are awarded for guessing or bluffing successfully. Select early episodes instead featured a &quot;Biofictionary&quot; round, where teams had to guess the claim to fame of a person rather than a word&#x27;s definition; this round was last held in season 11.

Compilation episodes occurred sporadically in early seasons, usually featuring rounds not included from a set of tapings, before the conceit returned via the &quot;Back 9&quot; episodes during the COVID-19 pandemic. To pad out the runtime of hour-long episodes, bonus content included a longer introduction, plugs from the host/panelists for their website, upcoming episodes, and ticket availability, as well as a mailbag segment where Richard Sher answered listener questions and issued corrections. Also commonly heard between rounds 4 and 5 was a &quot;Spotlight Round&quot;, which highlighted memorable rounds from earlier seasons, often suggested by listeners. Following Richard Sher&#x27;s death in 2015, Spotlight Rounds were often picked to honor him. The &quot;Back 9&quot; episodes featured nine rounds (six normal, three Bluffing) from assorted episodes of &quot;Says You!&quot; from seasons 1-7 featuring the original panelists

Through the show&#x27;s website, people could suggest questions and segments for the show, with frequent contributors nicknamed as &quot;Says You! Hall of Famers&quot;.

== Players ==
=== Hosts ===
* Richard Sher (creator, producer, host from 1996 to 2015)
* Barry Nolan (host from 2015 to 2017; regular panelist in other seasons)
* Gregg Porter (host from 2017 to 2019; recurring panelist from 2015 to 2018)

* Carolyn Faye Fox
* Tony Kahn
* Paula Lyons (wife of Arnie Reisman)
* Barry Nolan (host from 2015 to 2017; husband of Garland Waller)
* Arnie Reisman (husband of Paula Lyons)

The original panelists of &quot;Says You!&quot; are by far the most regularly appearing panelists in the show&#x27;s history, each appearing in over half of all episodes. Especially in earlier seasons, episodes usually featured Carolyn Faye Fox, Arnie Reisman, and Paula Lyons on one team and Tony Kahn, Francine Achbar, and Barry Nolan on the other team, with substitutions for panelist unavailability where needed. Crossovers between these panelist pairings on the same team only happened on rare occasions. The first team was typically introduced as sitting &quot;stereo left/right&quot; and the other was introduced as &quot;Team 2&quot;, but they were usually referred to by whoever the captains were on that episode afterwards. During Barry Nolan&#x27;s two seasons as host of &quot;Says You!&quot;, Murray Horwitz took his place as a regular panelist in most episodes, and remained a regular after Barry returned to the panel. Lenore Shannon is the most frequently heard non-regular panelist, appearing in over 70 episodes.

<text>Page Samuel McConnell (born May 17, 1963) is an American multi-instrumentalist, most noted for his work as the keyboardist and a songwriter for the band Phish.

McConnell joined Phish in 1985, and is the only member of its long-standing quartet lineup to not be an original member of the band. McConnell has been part of a number of other side projects, including leading the electronic jazz fusion band Vida Blue and acting as a session musician for the comedy rock duo Tenacious D. He released his debut solo album, &quot;Page McConnell,&quot; in 2007.

==Background==
McConnell was born on May 17, 1963, in Philadelphia. By age four, he began to learn to play the piano, and in 1969 his family relocated to Basking Ridge, New Jersey. He continued his musical studies, eventually playing in bands with friends by seventh grade. His father, Dr. Jack B. McConnell, worked at McNeil Laboratories and helped to develop Tylenol and the MRI. The elder McConnell then started a free health clinic, Volunteers in Medicine, that is staffed by retired health workers in Hilton Head, South Carolina. Jack McConnell died in February 2018.

McConnell spent a year at Gill St. Bernard&#x27;s School, in Gladstone, New Jersey before moving. McConnell spent his senior year of high school at Lawrence Academy, a boarding school in Groton, Massachusetts, and then attended Southern Methodist University from Fall 1982 to Spring 1984, where he joined Kappa Alpha Order and took a course called &quot;Imagination, Awareness, and Ideas&quot; taught by Donald Pasquella (based on Pasquella&#x27;s 1974 paper called &#x27;Imagination, Awareness, and Ideas: Helping The Student Become More Creative&#x27;), which McConnell later credited in his Goddard College senior study as &quot;the most important course I have ever taken.&quot; McConnell transferred to Goddard College in the fall of 1984 where he met his mentor, saxophonist Karl Boyle, and wrote his senior study, &quot;The Art of Improvisation&quot; under Boyle&#x27;s guidance. In his senior study, McConnell credited music teacher, Doug Freuler, for introducing him to jazz improvisation, and pianist Lar Duggan as “single most important person in helping me develop my improvisation”. McConnell graduated from Goddard in December 1987.

McConnell joined Phish in 1985 and played with the band for the first time on May 3 of that year. McConnell has written a number of Phish originals including &quot;Cars Trucks Buses,&quot; &quot;Magilla,&quot; &quot;Army of One,&quot; &quot;I Been Around,&quot; &quot;Windy City,&quot; &quot;Halfway to the Moon,&quot; &quot;If I Told You.&quot;, &quot;Things People Do.&quot;, and &quot;I Always Wanted It This Way&quot;. He has also coauthored numerous other songs with the band.

==Other musical projects==
In 1997, McConnell played keyboards on the title track of Scottish band Travis&#x27; debut album &quot;Good Feeling&quot;. The album was produced by Steve Lillywhite, who had produced Phish&#x27;s &quot;Billy Breathes&quot; album in 1996. In early 2001, McConnell recorded with Tenacious D on their debut album, later joining the band onstage that September for a show at the Higher Ground nightclub in Winooski, Vermont. That same year, with Oteil Burbridge and Russell Batiste, McConnell was a founding member of Vida Blue which performed from 2001 to 2004, and reformed to record an album in 2018.

After a two-year hiatus from the music industry during Phish&#x27;s hiatus, McConnell returned as a solo artist, recording an album of all new material in 2006. This eponymous album was released April 17, 2007 through Sony/BMG&#x27;s Legacy Recordings. On signing with Legacy, McConnell has stated, &quot;I know a lot of people on the internet, and that&#x27;s certainly an option – especially these days and especially if you&#x27;re catering to the Phish fans who already know who I am. But I wanted a little bit more than that... I was proud of the record, and I wanted as many people as possible to hear it when I was done with it.&quot;

McConnell headlined the High Sierra Music Festival in July 2007, which was held in Quincy, California. His touring band features multi-instrumentalist Jared Slomoff, guitarist Adam Zimmon, bassist Rob O&#x27;Dea, and drummer Gabe Jarrett. Said McConnell, &quot;I have a really good feeling about this group. It feels like a band, although it&#x27;s in its infancy right now. It really does feel like there is a collective consciousness.&quot;

From 2012 to 2015, McConnell toured on occasion with members of The Meters as The Meter Men.

<doc id="347232" wikidata="Q1141566" url="?curid=347232" title="Poplin">
<text>Poplin, also called tabinet (or tabbinet), is a fine (but thick) wool, cotton or silk fabric with crosswise ribs that typically give a corded surface. Nowadays, the name refers to a strong material in a plain weave of any fiber or blend.

Poplin traditionally consisted of a silk warp with a weft of worsted yarn. In this case, as the weft is in the form of a stout cord, the fabric has a ridged structure, like rep, which gives depth and softness to the lustre of the silky surface. The ribs run across the fabric from selvedge to selvedge. In Britain, woollen yarn from the spinners in Suffolk would be sent to Dublin to be woven with silk into tabinet.

Poplin is now made with wool, cotton, silk, rayon, polyester or a mixture of these. Since it has a plain under/over weave, the fabric displays a plain woven surface with no ribbing if the weft and warp threads are of the same material and size. Shirts made from this material are easy to iron and do not wrinkle easily.

Poplins are used for dress purposes, and for rich upholstery work which are formed by using coarse filling-yarns in a plain/hard weave.

The term &quot;poplin&quot; allegedly originates from &quot;papelino&quot;, a fabric made at Avignon, France, in the 15th century, and named for the papal (pope&#x27;s)residence there, and from the French &quot;papeline&quot; (a fabric, normally made with silk, of the same period). An alternative derivation associates &quot;poplin&quot; with products of the cloth industry of Poperinge in Flanders in present-day Belgium.

The most common usage of poplin until about the 20th century was to make silk, cotton or heavy-weight wool dresses, suitable for winter wear.

In the early 1920s, British-made cotton poplin was introduced to the United States, but the American market thought that the name had connotations of heaviness and arbitrarily renamed it &quot;broadcloth&quot;, a name that persists for a cotton or polyester-cotton blend fabric used for shirting. In Europe, &quot;broadcloth&quot; typically describes a densely-woven woolen fabric with a smooth finish.

<text>Wes Craven&#x27;s New Nightmare (also known simply as New Nightmare) is a 1994 American meta supernatural slasher film written and directed by Wes Craven, creator of 1984&#x27;s &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;. A standalone film and the seventh installment in the &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; franchise, it is not part of the same continuity as previous films, instead portraying Freddy Krueger as a fictional movie villain who invades the real world and haunts the cast and crew involved in the making of the films about him. In the film, Freddy is depicted as closer to what Craven originally intended, being much more menacing and much less comical, with an updated attire and appearance. The film stars Robert Englund, Heather Langenkamp, Miko Hughes, and John Saxon.

The film features various people involved in the motion picture industry portraying themselves, including Langenkamp, who is compelled by events in the narrative to reprise her role as Nancy Thompson. &quot;New Nightmare&quot; features several homages to the original film such as quotes and recreations of the most famous scenes. The film won an International Fantasy Film Award from Fantasporto for Best Screenplay by Craven.

&quot;New Nightmare&quot; was released on October 14, 1994, grossing $19.8 million at the box office on a budget of $8 million, making it the lowest-grossing film in the &quot;Nightmare&quot; series. However, it received positive reviews from critics, and is considered by many as one of the best &quot;Nightmare&quot; movies and one of Wes Craven&#x27;s most enduring films. It was followed by 2003&#x27;s &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;, a crossover with the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; franchise set in the same continuity as the other &quot;Nightmare&quot; films.

==Plot==
Heather Langenkamp lives in Los Angeles, California, with her husband, Chase, and their young son, Dylan. She is recognized for her role as Nancy Thompson in the &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; film series. One night, she has a nightmare in which her family is attacked by a set of animated Freddy Krueger claws from an upcoming &quot;Nightmare&quot; film. Waking up to an earthquake, she notices a cut on Chase&#x27;s finger similar to the one he had in her dream.

Heather receives frequent creepy phone calls from an obsessed fan who quotes Freddy Krueger&#x27;s nursery rhyme in Freddy&#x27;s voice. This coincides with a meeting with New Line Cinema, where she is asked to reprise her role as Nancy in a new &quot;Nightmare&quot; film. At home, Dylan has a traumatizing fit about Freddy. As Chase drives home from work, he falls asleep at the wheel and is slashed to death by Freddy&#x27;s claws. After his funeral, Heather has another Freddy nightmare, and her friend and former co-star, John Saxon, who played her father in the films, suggests she seek medical attention for Dylan.

Dylan&#x27;s health deteriorates as he becomes increasingly scared of Freddy and paranoid about going to sleep. Heather visits &quot;Nightmare&quot; creator Wes Craven, who admits to having precognitive nightmares. He explains that the films had kept trapped an ancient supernatural entity, which has been freed after the series ended with the release of &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead: The Final Nightmare&quot;. In the guise of Freddy, the entity is focusing on Heather, its primary foe, as killing her will allow it into the real world. Thus, Heather must agree to play Nancy again to stop it. Heather catches a glimpse of Wes&#x27;s script, which, inexplicably, is a written play-by-play of every dialogue and action she and everyone around her are taking. Robert Englund, who portrayed Freddy in the films, also appears to suffer nightmares and be haunted by the new Freddy, disappearing when Heather tries to contact him.

Heather takes Dylan to the hospital and returns home for his stuffed dinosaur while his babysitter, Julie, keeps watch. After Dylan falls asleep from the nurse&#x27;s sedative, Freddy brutally kills Julie. Sleepwalking, Dylan leaves the hospital, and Heather chases him home as Freddy taunts them. She realizes that reality is overlapping with the films; Saxon now addresses her as Nancy and acts as Don Thompson, and her street, house, and clothes all transform into Nancy&#x27;s. Once Heather embraces Nancy&#x27;s role, Freddy emerges into reality and abducts Dylan to his world. Heather follows them to a hellish construct of Freddy&#x27;s boiler room. After a fight, she and Dylan push Freddy into the furnace, destroying both the monster and its reality.

They emerge back into the real world from under his blankets, and Heather finds a copy of the events in Wes&#x27;s screenplay. Inside is a note from Wes thanking her for defeating Freddy and playing Nancy one last time. Her victory helps imprison the entity once more.

==Cast==

* Heather Langenkamp as herself and Nancy Thompson. Following her initial success in both the original &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; and &quot;The Dream Warriors&quot;, Langenkamp took on the role of Marie Lubbock in the ABC sitcom &quot;Just the Ten of Us&quot;. She was later stalked by an obsessed fan who was unhappy the series was cancelled, leading to her temporarily moving to England. In the film, Langenkamp&#x27;s character is also stalked through harassing phone calls.
* Robert Englund as himself and The Entity / &quot;Freddy Krueger&quot;. Englund&#x27;s performance as Freddy is notably toned down in this film compared to its predecessors, with less focus on comedic quips and more on the sinister aspect of his character. The Krueger costume was also altered to become darker with more &quot;organic&quot; makeup and a revised glove. In the film, Englund also plays himself as both an actor and painter. According to the 2010 documentary &quot;Never Sleep Again&quot;, a scripted but ultimately unfilmed sequence would have seen Englund transformed into a fly and trapped in the web of a giant &quot;Freddy-spider&quot; in an homage to the 1958 film &quot;The Fly&quot;. The sequence was not shot due to time and budgetary constraints.
* Miko Hughes as Dylan Porter. Hughes plays the son of Heather Langenkamp and Chase Porter whose mental health begins to deteriorate after his encounters with Freddy. 
* John Saxon as himself and Donald Thompson. Since his previous appearances in the &quot;Elm Street&quot; films, Saxon had kept himself busy primarily with lower budget movies and TV work; he was keen to appear in &quot;New Nightmare&quot; as he thought it likely to be the last film in the &quot;Elm Street&quot; saga. In the film, Saxon plays himself and gives onscreen daughter Langenkamp some advice about how to best treat her son Dylan. 
* Tracy Middendorf as Julie, Dylan&#x27;s babysitter and Heather&#x27;s best friend. According to Middendorf in the &quot;Never Sleep Again&quot; documentary, she was created in part to act as a red herring regarding Heather&#x27;s stalker. Film editor Patrick Lussier revealed in the same documentary that Julie was originally scripted to be working as an avatar for Freddy but this was ultimately changed to her being killed by him. Julie&#x27;s death mimics that of Tina Grey from the original film, with a rotating room again being used to simulate Freddy dragging her across the ceiling. 
* David Newsom as Chase Porter, Heather&#x27;s husband and a special effects artist working for New Line Cinema. The role of Chase was originally offered to Heather Langenkamp&#x27;s real life husband David LeRoy Anderson but he declined as it would be &quot;too close to the bone&quot;. Newsom recalled in 2010 how he looked nothing like a typical special effects artist, who tended to be bigger than him with longer hair.
* Fran Bennett as Dr. Christine Heffner, who initially suspects that Heather may be inadvertently harming her child herself. Wes Craven named Bennett&#x27;s character after former MPAA ratings chief Richard Heffner, with whom he had clashed many times over the content of his films. 
* Wes Craven as himself. Director Craven initially scripted himself as a man driven insane by nightmares, who had cut off his own eyelids to stay awake and was being driven by Michael Berryman&#x27;s character from &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot;. Craven decided to opt for a more comforting setting of being in an opulent house in the Hollywood Hills. 
* Robert Shaye as himself. Shaye appears as himself in order to convince Heather Langenkamp to take part in the new &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; film. Shaye would later remark in the &quot;Never Sleep Again&quot; documentary, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I did a particularly good job, but I was okay&quot;. Shaye had previously appeared as a bartender at an S&amp;M themed bar in &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, as a teacher in &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street 4&quot;, as a ticket seller in &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead&quot; and a funeral minister in the &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Nightmares&quot; episode &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; (credited as L.E Moko). 
* Marianne Maddalena as herself
* Sam Rubin as himself
* Sara Risher as herself
* Claudia Haro as a New Line Cinema receptionist
* Matt Winston and Rob LaBelle as Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Wilson and Terrance &quot;Terry&quot; Feinstein, two special effects workers
* W. Earl Brown as Morgue attendant
* Lin Shaye as Nurse with pill. Shaye played the teacher in the original film and, according to &quot;Never Sleep Again&quot;, was pleased to return as another &quot;generic public servant&quot;. 
* Nick Corri as himself. Corri played Rod in the original film and is silently present during the funeral scene.
* Tuesday Knight as herself. Knight played Kristen Parker in the fourth film and is silently present during the funeral scene.

==Production==

The film was written under the working title &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 7: The Ascension&quot;. Wes Craven set out to make a deliberately more cerebral film than recent entries to the franchise—which he regarded as being cartoonish, and not faithful to his original themes. The basic premise originated when Craven first signed on to co-write &quot;Dream Warriors&quot;, but New Line Cinema rejected it then.

In &quot;New Nightmare&quot;, Krueger was portrayed closer to what Craven had imagined: darker and less comical. To reinforce this, the character&#x27;s make-up and outfit were enhanced, with one of the most prominent differences being that he now wears a long blue/black trenchcoat. In addition, the signature glove was redesigned for a more organic look, with the fingers resembling bones and having muscle textures in between. While Robert Englund again plays the character, &quot;Freddy Krueger&quot; is credited as &quot;Himself&quot; in the end credits.

While earthquake scenes were already written into the film from the beginning, production of the film happened to take place concurrently with the 1994 Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles. As such, the production team decided to incorporate real footage of the earthquake&#x27;s structural damage into the film.

Craven had intended to ask Johnny Depp, whose feature film debut was in the first film, to make an appearance as himself, but was too timid to ask him. Upon running into each other after the film&#x27;s release, Depp said he would have been happy to do it had Craven asked.

Craven kept most of the wardrobe from the first film as souvenirs before New Line Cinema threw them all away, and reused some of it for &quot;New Nightmare&quot;.

Both New Line Executive Sara Risher and director Craven said that the shoot was relatively easy and free from complications. Reflecting on the filming in &quot;Never Sleep Again&quot; some sixteen years after the movie was released, Risher commented &quot;all of the other directors had to be guided through but Wes by then was the master&quot;. The film&#x27;s self-referential style would be explored further in the 1996 film &quot;Scream&quot;, also directed by Craven.

The film was made for the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the original film&#x27;s release. Both &quot;New Nightmare&quot; and the 1995 comedy film &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; were dedicated to the production designer of &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, Gregg Fonseca (1952 - 1994), who died shortly before the release of &quot;New Nightmare&quot;.

==Release==
===Home media===
This film was released on VHS by New Line Home Video on January 27, 1995. The DVD for the film was released on August 22, 2000, by New Line Home Entertainment.

==Reception==
===Box office===
On the film&#x27;s opening weekend it made $6.6 million, ranking third at the box office. It went on to gross $19.8 million worldwide, making it the poorest-performing film in the &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; film series. In the 2010 documentary &quot;Never Sleep Again&quot;, it is suggested that the film opening against &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; may also have damaged its potential box office.

===Critical response===

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 77% of 44 reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Wes Craven&#x27;s New Nightmare&quot; adds an unexpectedly satisfying - not to mention intelligent - meta layer to a horror franchise that had long since lost its way.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100 based on 21 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Several critics have subsequently said that &quot;New Nightmare&quot; could be regarded as a prelude to the &quot;Scream&quot; series—both sets of films deal with the idea of bringing horror films to &quot;real life&quot;, and both were directed by Wes Craven.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave &quot;New Nightmare&quot; three stars out of four and said, &quot;I haven&#x27;t been exactly a fan of the &quot;Nightmare&quot; series, but I found this movie, with its unsettling questions about the effect of horror on those who create it, strangely intriguing.&quot; Ebert&#x27;s review partner Gene Siskel was less complimentary of the film, giving it a thumbs-down rating on Siskel &amp; Ebert and stating that it was &quot;campy&quot; and he did not find Freddy a particularly compelling villain.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Owen Gleiberman gave &quot;New Nightmare&quot; a negative review, stating: &quot;After a good, gory opening, in which Freddy&#x27;s glove—newly designed with sinews and muscles—slashes the throat of the special-effects guy who&#x27;s been working on it, the movie succumbs to a kind of sterile inertia. &quot;Wes Craven&#x27;s New Nightmare&quot; isn&#x27;t about Freddy haunting a film set, which actually might have been fun. It&#x27;s about Heather Langenkamp, star of the original &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, being menaced for two long, slow hours by earthquakes, cracks in the wall, and other weary portents of doom.&quot; Gleiberman described the film as &quot;just an empty hall of mirrors&quot; that &quot;lacks the trancelike dread of the original&quot; and the &quot;ingeniously demented special effects&quot; of &quot;Dream Warriors&quot;. In a retrospective review, Vinnie Mancuso from Collider singled out the film as &quot;Craven&#x27;s meta-horror masterpiece&quot;. Kevin Sommerfield from the horror website Slasher Studios gave it four out of four stars and said, &quot;&quot;New Nightmare&quot; is that rare horror film in which everything works. The performances are pitch perfect, led by a tour-de-force performance by the amazing Langenkamp. The script has many twists and turns and the movie is quite possibly the best looking of the entire series.&quot;

&quot;New Nightmare&quot; is Robert Englund&#x27;s favorite &quot;Nightmare&quot; movie:&quot;I think it stands the test of time, a fun reunion with original cast members like Heather and John Saxon. Wes&#x27;s script is clever and original, the self-referencial horror story.&quot; Heather Langenkamp is also very supportive of the movie, saying:&quot;I was just really shocked that I was in the movie so much, I had totally forgotten I was the star of that movie. It was interesting because all my scenes are kind of alone, and I was acting against this tension and this idea of Freddy that we all had at that time. We all knew what I was afraid of and that Freddy might be back, but you never really saw Freddy that much, and I was really amazed that the movie was about Wes [Craven] creating this relationship with that idea that Freddy is here, and the audience has it too. It&#x27;s a really interesting concept, and it&#x27;s one of the only horror movies where the monster&#x27;s really in the background, at least until the end. But it&#x27;s all about our mentality about fear.&quot;

<text>Simon Sechter (11 October 1788 – 10 September 1867) was an Austrian music theorist, teacher, organist, conductor and composer. He was one of the most prolific composers who ever lived, although his music is largely forgotten and he is now mainly remembered as a strict music teacher, most notably of Anton Bruckner. He was a well respected music teacher during his life earning the praise of Beethoven, Schubert and Schumann.

Carl Christian Müller (18311914) compiled and adapted Sechter&#x27;s &quot;Die richtige Folge der Grundharmonien&quot; as &quot;The Correct Order of Fundamental Harmonies: A Treatise on Fundamental Basses, and their Inversions and Substitutes&quot; (Wm. A. Pond, 1871; G. Schirmer, 1898).

== Biography ==
Sechter was born in Friedberg (Frymburk), Bohemia, then part of the Austrian Empire, and moved to Vienna in 1804, succeeding Jan Václav Voříšek as court organist there in 1824. In 1810 he began teaching piano and voice at an academy for blind students. In 1828 the ailing Franz Schubert had one counterpoint lesson with him. In 1851 Sechter was appointed professor of composition at the Vienna Conservatory. His final years were spent in poverty due to his involvement in a son-in-law&#x27;s bankruptcy. He was succeeded at the Conservatory by Anton Bruckner, a former student whose teaching methods were based on Sechter&#x27;s.

== Teaching methods ==
Others whom Sechter taught include Henri Vieuxtemps, Franz Lachner, Eduard Marxsen (who taught Johannes Brahms piano and counterpoint), Johann Nepomuk Fuchs, Gustav Nottebohm, Anton Door, Karl Umlauf, Béla Kéler, Nina Stollewerk, Sigismond Thalberg, Adolf von Henselt, Anton de Kontski, Kornelije Stanković and Theodor Döhler.

Sechter had strict teaching methods. For instance, he forbade Bruckner to write any original compositions while studying counterpoint with him. The scholar Robert Simpson believes that &quot;Sechter unknowingly brought about Bruckner&#x27;s originality by insisting that it be suppressed until it could no longer be contained.&quot; Sechter taught Bruckner by mail from 1855 to 1861 and considered Bruckner his most dedicated pupil. Upon Bruckner&#x27;s graduation, Sechter wrote a fugue dedicated to his student.

In the three-volume treatise on the principles of composition, &quot;Die Grundsätze der musikalischen Komposition&quot;, Sechter wrote a seminal work that influenced many later theorists. Sechter&#x27;s ideas are derived from Jean-Philippe Rameau&#x27;s theories of the fundamental bass, always diatonic even when the surface is highly chromatic; music theory historians strongly associate Sechter with the Viennese conception of fundamental bass theory. Sechter was an advocate of just intonation over well-tempered tuning.

== As composer ==
Sechter was also a composer, and in that capacity he is mostly remembered for writing about 5,000 fugues (he tried to write at least one fugue every day), but he also wrote masses and oratorios. In addition he wrote five operas: &quot;Das Testament des Magiers&quot; (1842), &quot;Ezzeline, die unglückliche Gegangene aus Deli-Katesse&quot; (1843), &quot;Ali Hitsch-Hatsch&quot; (1844), &quot;Melusine&quot; (1851), and &quot;Des Müllers Ring&quot; (?). In 1823–24, he was one of the 51 composers who composed a variation on a waltz by Anton Diabelli for &quot;Vaterländischer Künstlerverein.&quot;

<doc id="347245" wikidata="Q4771131" url="?curid=347245" title="Antediluvian">
<text>The antediluvian (alternatively pre-diluvian or pre-flood) period is the time period chronicled in the Bible between the fall of man and the Genesis flood narrative in biblical cosmology. The term was coined by Thomas Browne (1605–1682). The narrative takes up chapters 1–6 (excluding the flood narrative) of the Book of Genesis. The term found its way into early geology and science until the late Victorian era. Colloquially, the term is used to refer to any ancient and murky period.

==Precedents==
The Eridu Genesis is alleged to be the direct antecessor to the biblical flood as well as other Near Eastern flood stories, and reflects a similar religious and cultural relevance to their religion. Much as the Abrahamic religions, ancient Sumerians divided the world between pre-flood and post-flood eras, the former being a time where the God walked the earth with humans. Humans ceased to be immortal ever since Adam and Eve sinned, the flood was then punishment for the descendants of man because of their evil.

==Timing the antediluvian period==

===The Biblical flood===

In the Christian Bible, Hebrew Torah and Islamic Quran, the antediluvian period begins with the Fall of the first man and woman, according to Genesis and ends with the destruction of all life on the earth except those saved with Noah in the ark (Noah and his wife, his three sons and their wives). According to Bishop Ussher&#x27;s 17th-century chronology, the antediluvian period lasted for 1656 years, from Creation (some say the fall of man) at 4004 BC to the Flood at 2348 BC. The elements of the narrative include some of the best-known stories in the Bible – the creation, Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel, followed by the genealogies tracing the descendants of Cain and Seth, the third mentioned son of Adam and Eve. (These genealogies provide the framework for the biblical chronology, in the form &quot;A lived X years and begat B&quot;.)

The Bible speaks of this era as being a time of great wickedness. There were Gibborim (giants) in the earth in those days as well as Nephilim; some Bible translations identify the two as one and the same. The Gibborim were unusually powerful; Genesis calls them &quot;mighty men which were of old, men of renown&quot;. The antediluvian period ended when God sent the Flood to wipe out all life except Noah, his family, and the animals they took with them. Nevertheless, the Nephilim (literally meaning &#x27;fallen ones&#x27;, from the Hebrew root n-f-l &#x27;to fall&#x27;) reappear much later in the biblical narrative, in Numbers (where the spies sent forth by Moses report that there were Nephilim or &quot;giants&quot; in the Promised Land).

===In early geology===
Early scientific attempts at reconstructing the history of the Earth were founded on the biblical narrative and thus used the term &quot;antediluvian&quot; to refer to a period understood to be essentially similar to the biblical one. Early scientific interpretation of the biblical narrative divided the antediluvian into sub-periods based on the six days of Creation:

* Pre-Adamitic (the first 5 days, Gen 1:1 to Gen 2:3)
** Primary (the formation of the physical universe and the earth)
** Secondary (creation of plants and animals)
* Adamitic (or Tertiary, from the Creation of man to the Great Flood; Gen 2:5 to Gen 7:8), corresponding to St. Augustine&#x27;s First Age of his Six Ages of the World

Prior to the 19th century, rock was classified into three main types: primary or primitive (igneous and metamorphic rock), secondary (sedimentary rock) and tertiary (sediments). The primary rocks (like granite and gneiss) are void of fossils and were thought to be associated with the very creation of the world in the primary Pre-Adamitic period. The secondary rocks, often containing copious fossils, though human remains had not been found, were thought to have been laid down in the secondary Pre-Adamitic period. The Tertiary rocks (sediments) were thought to have been put down after Creation and possibly in connection to a flood event, and were thus associated with the Adamitic period. The Post-Flood period was termed the Quaternary, a name still in use in geology.

As mapping of the geological strata progressed in the early decades of the 19th century, the estimated lengths of the various sub-periods were greatly increased. The fossil rich Secondary Pre-Adamitic period was divided up into the Coal period, the Lias and the Chalk period, later expanded into the now-familiar geologic time scale of the Phanerozoic. The term &quot;antediluvian&quot; was used in natural science well into the 19th century and lingered in popular imagination despite increasingly detailed stratigraphy mapping the Earth&#x27;s past, and was often used for the Pleistocene period, where humans existed alongside now extinct megafauna.

==The antediluvian world==
===Creationist interpretation===
Writers such as William Whiston (&quot;A New Theory of the Earth&quot;, 1696) and Henry Morris (&quot;The Genesis Flood&quot;, 1961) who launched the modern Creationist movement described the antediluvian period as follows:

* People lived much longer than those alive today, typically between 700 and 950 years, as reported in the genealogies of Genesis;
* The Earth contained many more people than it did in 1696. Whiston calculated that as many as 500 million humans may have been born in the antediluvian period, based on assumptions about lifespans and fertility rates;
* There were no clouds or rain. Instead, the Earth was watered by mists which rose from the Earth. (Another interpretation is that Earth was covered completely by a global cloud layer, which was the upper waters mentioned in the Creation. This is commonly called the vapor canopy view.)

However, there has since been debate among Creationists over the authenticity of arguments such as the one that there was no rain before the Flood and previous ideas about what the antediluvian world was like are constantly changing.

===In 19th-century science===
During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the understanding of the nature of early Earth went through a transformation from a biblical or deist interpretation to a naturalistic one. Even back in the early 18th century, Plutonists had argued for an ancient Earth, but the full impact of the depth of time involved in the Pre-Adamitic period was not commonly accepted until uniformitarianism as presented in Charles Lyell&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; of 1830. While each period was understood to be a vast aeon, the narrative of the pre-Adamitic world was still influenced by the biblical storyline of creation in this transition. A striking example is a description from &quot;Memoires of Ichtyosauri and Plesiosauri&quot;, 1839, describing fossil species in a world with land, sea and vegetation, but before the creation of a separate sun and moon, corresponding to the third day of creation in the Genesis narrative:

A modern naturalistic view of the ancient world, along with the abandonment of the term &#x27;antediluvian&#x27;, came about with the works of Charles Darwin and Louis Agassiz in the 1860s.

===The antediluvian monsters===

From antiquity, fossils of large animals were often quoted as having lived together with the giants from the Book of Genesis: e.g. the Tannin or &quot;great sea monsters&quot; of Gen 1:21. They are often described in later books of the Bible, especially by God himself in the Book of Job: e.g. Re&#x27;em in verse 39:9, Behemoth in chapter 40 and Leviathan in chapter 41. With the advent of geological mapping in the early 19th century, it became increasingly obvious that many of the fossils associated with the &quot;secondary&quot; (sedimentary) rock were neither those of giant humans nor of any extant animals. These included large animals such as ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, pliosaurs and the various giant mammals found when excavating the Catacombs of Paris. The geologists of the day increasingly came to use the term &#x27;antediluvian&#x27; only for the younger strata containing fossils of animals resembling those alive today.

==Other uses==
*The term is also used in the field of Assyriology for kings, according to some versions of the Sumerian king list, supposed to have reigned before the great flood.
*The adjective &quot;antediluvian&quot; is sometimes used figuratively to mean of great age or outmoded. H. P. Lovecraft was particularly fond of the term, using it frequently in his horror stories.
*In Charles Stross&#x27;s novel &quot;Saturn&#x27;s Children&quot;, the religious order who believe in evolution refer to the antediluvian period as the time in which man lived alongside Tyrannosaurs.
* &quot;&quot; is an 1882 book by Ignatius L. Donnelly that attempted to establish that all known ancient civilizations were descended from Atlantis. Many theories mentioned in the book are the source of modern-day concepts about Atlantis.
*In the tabletop role-playing game &quot;&quot;, the Antediluvians are the early vampires that lived in the pre-flood world and the supposed progenitors of the original clans.
*In the television series &quot;&quot;, Antedeluvian is a powerful vampiric Titan, formerly used by Vlad the Impaler. He returns in the second series as the primary Titan of Harrison Fears, an evil Seeker, to whom he power-bonds.

<text>Elkhorn is a census-designated place (CDP) in Jefferson County, Montana, United States, in the Elkhorn Mountains of the southwestern part of the state. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 10. The community is considered a ghost town, and two of its buildings are preserved as Elkhorn State Park.

==History==
Lodes of silver, described by geologists as supergene enrichments, were initially discovered in the Elkhorn Mountains by Peter Wys, a Swiss immigrant. Six years later, Anton Holter, a pioneer capitalist from Helena, began developing the mine. Over $14 million in silver was carried from the mine. In 1890, the Sherman Silver Purchase Act passed, creating a high demand for Elkhorn&#x27;s silver.

During this peak period, Elkhorn had 2,500 inhabitants, a school, a hotel, a church, stores, saloons, and brothels. Unlike most mining towns, Elkhorn was populated mostly by families of married European immigrants. In 1893, the Fraternity Hall was constructed for social gatherings, and still remains as one of the most well-preserved buildings in modern Elkhorn.

In the years following, the silver boom and Elkhorn&#x27;s prosperity began to lessen as the desire for silver decreased. A diphtheria epidemic struck Elkhorn in the winter of 1888–1889, resulting in many deaths, particularly of children. Soon after, railroad service to Elkhorn was halted and only a fraction of the original inhabitants remained.

The state of Montana designated Fraternity Hall and Gillian Hall as Elkhorn State Park in 1980.

==Geography==
Elkhorn is in eastern Jefferson County on the south side of the Elkhorn Mountains, in the valley of Elkhorn Creek. It can only be reached through its neighboring town, Boulder, by taking the I-15 exit for Boulder, continuing southeast on Montana Highway 69, then north on graveled county roads.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Elkhorn CDP has an area of , all land.

==Demographics==
While very few standing buildings remain of the original Elkhorn, a number of cabins have been reoccupied and refurbished. In 2010, there were 10 inhabitants.

==Education==
The school districts for the community are Boulder Elementary School District and Jefferson High School District

<doc id="347252" wikidata="Q2788284" url="?curid=347252" title="Drill (fabric)">
<text>Drill is stout, durable cotton fabric with a strong bias (diagonal) in the weave. It can be used unbleached, although it is more often bleached or dyed.

== Use in clothing ==

Light weight drill is used in clothing items such as shirts, safari jackets, blouses, and some types of sports clothing. The heavier weights were often used in corsets, and are commonly used in work clothing and uniforms.

The most common use of drill in uniforms and casual wear is in the form of khaki drill. Learning from this practice, British troops took to dyeing their white drill uniforms to obtain more serviceable campaign clothing; this practice became widespread during the crisis of the Indian Mutiny. Initially, improvised dyes produced clothing that ranged in shade from lavender grey to earth brown, although all were referred to as &quot;khaki&quot;. In the mid-1880s, standardised cotton drill uniforms were produced using a colourfast mineral dye of the shade now recognised universally as khaki. The fabric soon became a popular material for military uniforms, and in the United States following World War II, as veterans returned to college campuses, it became popular in casual dress as well 

==Other uses==
Drill is a versatile fabric that has been used in a variety of applications. Boat sail drill is a lightweight, unbleached drill used to make sails for sailing craft. Although duck (canvas) was more commonly used for these purposes, drill has also been used to make tarpaulins, tents, awnings and canopies, but the use of both fabrics has been supplanted in modern times with synthetic fabrics. Like duck, drill is used as a covering for furniture and cushions.

<doc id="347255" wikidata="Q1371658" url="?curid=347255" title="George Antonius">
<text>George Habib Antonius, CBE (hon.) (; October 9, 1891May 21, 1942) was a Lebanese author and diplomat who settled in Jerusalem. He was one of the first historians of Arab nationalism. Born in Deir al Qamar to a Lebanese Eastern Orthodox Christian family, he served as a civil servant in the British Mandate of Palestine. His 1938 book &quot;The Arab Awakening&quot; generated an ongoing debate over such issues as the origins of Arab nationalism, the significance of the Arab Revolt of 1916, and the machinations behind the post-World War I political settlement in West Asia and North Africa. In the book, he raised concern about the fate of religious coexistence in Palestine in the face of Zionist colonization, while also recognizing the horror of anti-Jewish Nazism. 

==Philosophy==
Antonius traced Arab nationalism to the reign of Mehmet Ali Pasha in Egypt. He argued that the Arab nation (which consists of racial and cultural-linguistic elements) has been &quot;dormant&quot; for centuries and that Protestant missionaries from the United States had a specific role in the renewal and &quot;awakening&quot; of the Arabic as a national language. He saw the role of the Syrian Protestant College as central to this development, although he notes that later on, by the end of the 19th century, that role has diminished, since the college initiated instruction in English. By then the torch of the movement had been passed to Arab intellectuals residing in the region of Syria and in Europe and to Arab officers in the Ottoman army who formed a secret society to ultimately promote Arab nationalist interests. These officers proved particularly useful later during World War I after the leadership of the movement openly shifted allegiance to support the Entente. Other than tracing the birth of the Arab national movement, Antonius also argued that it was Great Britain that dishonoured its prior commitments to the Arabs and instead pursued its own colonial interests at the expense of what Antonius calls the &quot;true will of the people,&quot; namely unity and independence of the would-be Arab state.

==Career==

Antonius graduated from Cambridge University and joined the newly formed British Mandate Administration in Palestine as the deputy in the Education Department. His wife, Katy, was a daughter of Faris Nimr Pasha, a wealthy Lebanese Christian and cultural activist. Antonius had a difficult relationship with the British. Despite his senior position he and his wife were refused membership in the Jerusalem sports club which had a &quot;No Natives&quot; policy.

In 1925, Antonius joined Gilbert Clayton in the newly formed Saudi Arabia, as his translator and advisor in the negotiations to agree on the boundaries of Saudi Arabia with Iraq, Transjordan and Yemen.

He resigned his position in 1930 to join the Institute of Current World Affairs in New York City. He was secretary general to the Arab Delegation to the London Conference (1939).

An annual lecture is given in his memory at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford.

==Personal life==
Antonius was the son-in-law of Faris Nimr who was a Lebanese journalist and founder of the newspaper &quot;Al Muqattam&quot;.

<doc id="347256" wikidata="Q319197" url="?curid=347256" title="Timon &amp; Pumbaa (TV series)">
<text>The Lion King&#x27;s Timon &amp; Pumbaa is an American animated buddy comedy television series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation. It was based on Disney&#x27;s 1994 animated feature film &quot;The Lion King&quot;, centering on Timon the meerkat and Pumbaa the warthog as they continue to live by their problem-free philosophy &quot;hakuna matata&quot;. Compared to most other &quot;The Lion King&quot; media, the tone of the series is more slapstick comedy-oriented.

Ernie Sabella reprised his role as Pumbaa for the show&#x27;s entire run, while Nathan Lane only reprised his role as Timon in ten episodes, the last of which being &quot;Paraguay Parable&quot;.

The show ran for three seasons, with the first two as part of the syndicated &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot; block, CBS, and the third season on Toon Disney. It aired from September 8, 1995, to September 24, 1999. It is the first &quot;Lion King&quot;-related media to feature on-screen appearances by humans. It is also the first of two television series to be based on the film, the second being &quot;The Lion Guard&quot; (2016–2019).

Bobs Gannaway and Tony Craig, who would later work on shows like &quot;101 Dalmatians: The Series&quot;, &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, and &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&quot;, served as the show&#x27;s executive producers for the first two seasons. As of Season 3, the series was produced by Chris Bartleman and Blair Peters, with Tedd and Patsy Cameron-Anasti (who have previously worked on &quot;DuckTales&quot; and &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; TV series) serving as the executive producers.

==Premise==
The show stars Timon, a meerkat, and Pumbaa, a warthog, both characters from &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Taking place after the events of the movie, Timon and Pumbaa continue to live according to the &quot;hakuna matata&quot; lifestyle, as they venture beyond the Pride Lands and go on adventures. From the jungles of Africa to other places around the world, the duo is shown being on various quests and misadventures, either in search for food, fun, valuables, and as well as escape from danger such as predators, encountering various new allies and enemies throughout their journey. Whereas the show focuses on Timon and Pumbaa, four episodes center respectively on Rafiki and the hyena trio Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed, named &quot;Rafiki Fables&quot; and &quot;The Laughing Hyenas&quot;, and two episodes are focused on Zazu. Simba makes appearances in some episodes, often accompanying Timon and Pumbaa.

==Episodes==

==Characters==
===Main===
* Timon (voiced in early episodes by Nathan Lane, reprising his role from &quot;The Lion King&quot;, Quinton Flynn in Season 1 and Kevin Schon in Seasons 2–3) is one of the show&#x27;s two main protagonists. Schon later provided Timon&#x27;s voice in &quot;The Lion Guard&quot;.
* Pumbaa (voiced by Ernie Sabella) is one of the show&#x27;s two main protagonists. Sabella reprises his role from &quot;The Lion King&quot;.

===&quot;The Lion King&quot; alumni===
The following additional characters from &quot;The Lion King&quot; appear in this series:
*Simba (voiced by Cam Clarke) was the protagonist of the original &quot;The Lion King&quot; film and best friend of Timon and Pumbaa and the son of the late Mufasa. He is the current king of the Pridelands after overthrowing his uncle Scar as revenge for Mufasa&#x27;s brutal demise Simba witnessed as a cub. In the series, he occasionally is the voice of reason around Timon and Pumbaa&#x27;s antics. Clarke later provided Simba&#x27;s singing voice in &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot;.
*Rafiki (voiced by Robert Guillaume) is a wise mandrill who gives good advice. Guillaume reprises his role from &quot;The Lion King&quot;.
*Zazu (voiced by Edward Hibbert) is a pompous hornbill who works as Simba&#x27;s majordomo as well as jungle administrator. Edward Hibbert later provided Zazu&#x27;s voice in &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot; and &quot;The Lion King 1½&quot;.
*Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed (voiced by Tress MacNeille, Rob Paulsen, and Jim Cummings respectively) are three buffoonish hyenas who are the late Scar&#x27;s former henchmen and are usually spending their time looking for food, though their attempts to get it tend to backfire. Cummings reprises his role of Ed from &quot;The Lion King&quot;, with Paulsen and MacNeille replacing Cheech Marin and Whoopi Goldberg as Banzai and Shenzi, respectively.
*Gopher (voiced by Ernie Sabella) is a mole, and chief lieutenant of Zazu.

===Supporting===
* Speedy (voiced by Corey Burton imitating Bing Crosby) is a laid-back blue snail who can talk and sing. Timon and Pumbaa originally planned to eat him, but ended up becoming friends with him instead. They often find themselves rushing to have to save Speedy from dangerous situations.
* Fred (voiced by S. Scott Bullock) is a maniacal meerkat who is an old friend of Timon. He loves to laugh and play around, as well as pulling practical jokes. He often uses Timon and Pumbaa as his victims, although they don&#x27;t find his jokes very funny.
* Boss Beaver (voiced by Brad Garrett) is a stereotypical beaver whose life philosophy is the exact opposite of Hakuna Matata. He values hard work and is sometimes too harsh on his employees. He also emphasizes the importance of safe work conditions.
* Irwin (voiced by Charlie Adler) is a dimwitted, accident-prone penguin whose bad luck seems to be terribly contagious. Timon and Pumbaa became his friends after they were stranded in Antarctica and Irwin had two extra tickets to a cruise ship. They will try to avoid him at all costs.

===Antagonists===
* Quint (voiced by Corey Burton) is Timon and Pumbaa&#x27;s human archenemy and the main antagonist of the series. He is a man of many disguises and his role varies from episode to episode, from mildly bothersome antagonist to full villain.
* Toucan Dan (voiced by Jeff Bennett) is a criminal toucan, wanted by the police. He is known for being a sly con-artist and always manages to trick Timon and Pumbaa (or, as seen in his debut episode, only Timon) into helping him in his schemes and cons.
* Cheetata and Cheetato (voiced by Rob Paulsen and Jim Cummings respectively) are a pair of sophisticated cheetahs who hunt for their prey, enemies of Timon and Pumbaa and of Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. Although hard to tell apart, aside from their voices, Cheetata appears to be more eager and aggressive while Cheetato seems more likely to think things through and is the most conniving.
* Mr. Bear (voiced by Jim Cummings) is a large brown bear with a very short temperament who Timon and Pumbaa often run into. He can be quite menacing and dangerous, but at least one episode shows that deep inside he is a nice guy.
* The Three Natives (voiced by Jeff Bennett) are a trio of natives who are really university students. Their &quot;chief&quot; is also a university student, and usually precedes what he says with &quot;Bungala bungala!&quot;
* Little Jimmy (voiced by Joe Alaskey) is a cute yet dangerous bluebird who is a criminal mastermind. He also has two voices: a cute, innocent voice to pass himself off as a hatchling and a gruff voice to prove his true maturity.

==History==
===Production===
On January 24, 1995, it was announced that a &quot;Lion King&quot; television series starring Timon and Pumbaa was set to premiere during the fall, as part of The Disney Afternoon. Gary Krisel, who was then president of Walt Disney Television Animation, found Timon and Pumbaa to be the best new comedy team to come on the scene for a long time and that they had the potential to be just as classic as Abbott and Costello, Hope and Crosby, Martin and Lewis, and Nichols and May.

Bobs Gannaway and Tony Craig were the supervising producers for the show, and instead of recreating the lush, lyrical tone of the movie weekly, they decided to shape the series in a more Tex Avery-ish vein. Gannaway explained that he and Craig wanted to expand on Timon and Pumbaa&#x27;s personalities as a comedy team to keep the series fresh and to keep the show interesting, they decided to not have Timon and Pumbaa be locked into the Serengeti, but allow them to explore the world and meet different kinds of animals. According to one of the show&#x27;s writers Kevin Campbell, at the beginning of the series, he and Gannaway made a giant list of puns using country names to open the doors on how many places they could go. After figuring out which funny animal or obstacle situation Timon and Pumbaa would face, they used a &quot;Which Animals Live Where&quot; atlas reference book to find where in the world an episode could take place and check a list of country puns they could pick.

The show was one of the last Disney productions to air on CBS, which had a cross-promotion agreement with Disney, as Disney bought ABC in 1996, the same year that this show (and all other Disney properties still airing on CBS at the time) left the network. Also, in 1995, Westinghouse acquired CBS outright for $5.4 billion. As one of the major broadcasting group owners of commercial radio and television stations (as Group W) since 1920, Westinghouse proceeded to transform itself from its legendary role as a diversified conglomerate with a strong industrial heritage into a media giant with its purchase of CBS. Music underscore by Stephen James Taylor featuring frequent use of a microtonal xylophone and pan pipes based on an African tribal tuning. 

===Animation===
Animation production was done by a consortium of overseas animation studios, including Walt Disney Animation Australia, Toon City, Wang Film Productions, Thai Wang Film Productions, Rough Draft Korea Co., Ltd., Sunmin Image Pictures Co., Sunwoo Animation, Koko Enterprises, Toonz Animation, Gnome Productions, Jaime Diaz Productions, Golden Key Animation, Project X Animation, Shanghai Morning Sun Animation and Studio B Productions.

===Broadcast===
The first two seasons of the show aired simultaneously on The Disney Afternoon and CBS, whereas the third and final season aired on Toon Disney. Reruns of the series aired on Disney Channel from 1997 to 2008. Reruns were shown on Toon Disney up until the channel&#x27;s demise on February 8, 2009. As a result, the show went off the air for three years. 

While the show aired on Disney Channel and Toon Disney, certain episodes from its original run were never re-aired or had scenes edited out, likely for content reasons. For example, &quot;Catch Me if You Kenya&quot; originally had a scene with the butterfly collector returning to his tree house from China and threatened Timon and Pumbaa to put them in a collection for releasing the butterflies. That scene was removed from reruns due to his clothing and appearance evoking Asian stereotypes. The scene was eventually reinstated when the show became available on the Disney+ streaming service since its launch on November 12, 2019. 

On March 23, 2012, the show returned to television when Disney Junior was launched as its own channel. However, only selected episodes were shown and some episodes were abruptly edited (presumably due to scenes being deemed inappropriate for preschoolers). As of 2014, the show was removed from the channel. In Russia, however, the show continued to air until the channel closed in 2022.

===Marketing===
Upon its premiere in the United States, the show was accompanied with a marketing campaign, which include promotional tie-ins with Burger King (the same promotional partner for the original theatrical and home video releases of &quot;The Lion King&quot;), KFC and Campbell&#x27;s through its Franco-American brand&#x27;s SpaghettiOs.

Three titles containing 21 episodes were released in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, Asia, the Middle East, South Africa, and South America each containing six episodes and a music video. These three titles were released on VHS, LaserDisc, Video CD and DVD. The first release, &quot;Around the World with Timon And Pumbaa&quot;, features an original story told through bridging sequences in which, after Pumbaa develops amnesia from a lightning strike, Timon tries to restore his friend&#x27;s memory through the episodes featured on that video.

==Impact and legacy==
Some of the show&#x27;s crew returned for &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride, The Lion King 1½,&quot; and &quot;The Lion Guard&quot;. Show writer Ford Riley went on to develop the latter, and has since been a series creator, writer and lyricist on many Disney properties. Kevin Schon, who voiced Timon in the series as of its second season, reprised his role as the character in &quot;The Lion Guard&quot; (as well as its pilot film), along with some other related media, such as &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. Edward Hibbert continued to voice Zazu in the two direct-to-video follow-ups to &quot;The Lion King&quot;.

Much of the show&#x27;s staff members (including executive producers Tony Craig and Bobs Gannaway) went on to work on &quot;House of Mouse&quot; and &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&quot;.

<text>George Alexander Aberle (April 15, 1908 – March 4, 1995), known as eden ahbez, was an American songwriter and recording artist of the 1940s to 1960s, whose lifestyle in California was influential in the hippie movement. He was known to friends simply as ahbe.

Ahbez composed the song &quot;Nature Boy&quot;, which became a No. 1 hit for eight weeks in 1948 for Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole. Living a bucolic life from at least the 1940s, he traveled in sandals and wore shoulder-length hair and beard, and white robes. He camped out below the first L in the Hollywood Sign above Los Angeles and studied Asian mysticism. He slept outdoors with his family and ate vegetables, fruit, and nuts. He claimed to live on $3 per week.

==Early life==
Ahbez was born in Brooklyn, New York to Jewish father George Philip Aberle and English mother Margaret Annie (Mason) Aberle. He spent his early years in the Brooklyn Hebrew Orphan Asylum of New York. He then traveled in an orphan train, was adopted in 1917 by a family in Chanute, Kansas, and raised under the name George McGrew.

During the 1930s, McGrew lived in Kansas City, Missouri, where he performed as a pianist and dance band leader. In 1941, he arrived in Los Angeles and began playing piano in the Eutropheon, a small health food store and raw food restaurant on Laurel Canyon Boulevard. The cafe was owned by John and Vera Richter, who followed a &quot;Naturmensch&quot; and &quot;Lebensreform&quot; philosophy influenced by the Wandervogel movement in Germany. He was a vegetarian. He recalled once telling a policeman: &quot;I look crazy but I&#x27;m not. And the funny thing is that other people don&#x27;t look crazy but they are.&quot;

Their followers, known as &quot;Nature Boys&quot; and who included Gypsy Boots (né Robert Bootzin), wore long hair and beards and ate only raw fruits and vegetables. During this period, he adopted the name &quot;eden ahbez&quot;, choosing to spell his name with lower-case letters, claiming that only the words God and Infinity were worthy of capitalization.

==Career==
In 1947, ahbez approached Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole&#x27;s manager backstage at the Lincoln Theater in Los Angeles and handed him the music for his song, &quot;Nature Boy&quot;. Cole began playing the song for live audiences to much acclaim, but needed to track down its author before releasing his recording of it. Publicity material for Cole&#x27;s single instead makes the claim that Johnny Mercer recommended ahbez to Cole on behalf of Capitol Records. Jack Patton, in turn, is said to have advised ahbez to bring &quot;Nature Boy&quot; to Capitol after befriending him at the restaurant where ahbez worked.

Ahbez was discovered living under the Hollywood Sign and became the focus of a media frenzy when Cole&#x27;s version of &quot;Nature Boy&quot; shot to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and remained there for eight consecutive weeks during the summer of 1948. In early 1948, RKO Radio Pictures paid ahbez $10,000 for the rights to &quot;Nature Boy&quot; to use as the theme song for their film &quot;The Boy with Green Hair&quot;, and he was credited as the song&#x27;s composer on the film&#x27;s opening titles.

Ahbez was covered simultaneously in &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazines. Frank Sinatra and Sarah Vaughan later released versions of the song. Ahbez faced legal action from a Yiddish music composer, Herman Yablokoff, who claimed that the melody to &quot;Nature Boy&quot; came from one of his songs, &quot;Shvayg mayn harts&quot; (&quot;Be Still My Heart&quot;). Ahbez claimed to have &quot;heard the tune in the mist of the California mountains&quot;. However, legal proceedings resulted in a payment to Yablokoff of $25,000 in an out-of-court settlement.

Ahbez continued to supply Cole with songs, including &quot;Land of Love (Come My Love and Live with Me)&quot;, which was also covered by Doris Day and The Ink Spots. In 1949, he gave Burl Ives the idea to cover Stan Jones&#x27; &quot;Ghost Riders in the Sky&quot; after overhearing Jones recording his own version of the song. He worked closely with jazz musician Herb Jeffries, and, in 1954, the pair collaborated on an album, &quot;The Singing Prophet&quot;, which included the only recording of Ahbez&#x27;s four-part &quot;Nature Boy Suite&quot;. The album was later reissued as &quot;Echoes of Eternity&quot; on Jeffries&#x27; United National label. In the mid-1950s, he wrote songs for Eartha Kitt, Frankie Laine, and others, as well as writing some rock-and-roll novelty songs. In 1957, his song &quot;Lonely Island&quot; was recorded by Sam Cooke, becoming the second and final Ahbez composition to hit the Top 40.

In 1959, he began recording instrumental music, which combined his signature somber tones with exotic arrangements and (according to the record sleeve) &quot;primitive rhythms&quot;. He often performed bongo, flute, and poetry gigs at beat coffeehouses in the Los Angeles area. In 1960, he recorded his only solo LP, &quot;Eden&#x27;s Island,&quot; for Del-Fi Records. This mixed beatnik poetry with exotica arrangements. Ahbez promoted the album through a coast-to-coast walking tour making personal appearances, but it sold poorly.

During the 1960s, ahbez released five singles. Grace Slick&#x27;s band the Great Society recorded a version of &quot;Nature Boy&quot; in 1966 and ahbez was photographed in the studio with Brian Wilson during a session for the &quot;Smile&quot; album in early 1967. Later that year, British singer Donovan sought ahbez in Palm Springs, California, and the two wanderers shared a reportedly &quot;near-telepathic&quot; conversation. In the 1970s, Big Star&#x27;s Alex Chilton recorded a version of &quot;Nature Boy&quot; with the photographer William Eggleston on piano. The song was finally released as a bonus track on the 1992 Rykodisc re-release of the album &quot;Third/Sister Lovers&quot;.

==Personal life==
Some time in 1947, he married Anna Jacobson a month after they met; the couple had a son, Tatha &quot;Zoma&quot; Om Ahbez, on October 9, 1948.

His wife Anna (née Annette Jacobson; October 16, 1915 – August 9, 1963) died, aged 47, of leukemia, and his son &quot;Zoma&quot; died unexpectedly in either 1965, 1969 or 1971. In 1974, ahbez was reported to be living in the Los Angeles suburb of Sunland, and he owned a record label named Sunland Records, for which he was recording under the name Eden Abba. From the late 1980s until his death, ahbez worked closely with Joe Romersa, an engineer/drummer in Los Angeles. The master tapes, photos, and final works of ahbez are in Romersa&#x27;s possession.

==Death==
Ahbez died on March 4, 1995, of injuries sustained in a car crash, at the age of 86. Another album, &quot;Echoes from Nature Boy&quot;, was released posthumously.

<doc id="347259" wikidata="Q356723" url="?curid=347259" title="Illuminates of Thanateros">
<text>The Illuminates of Thanateros (IOT) () is an international magical organization that focuses on practical group work in chaos magic. The idea was first announced in 1978, while the order proper was formed in 1987. This fraternal magical society has been an important influence on some forms of modern occultism. It has been described as &quot;an unprecedented attempt of institutionalising one of the most individualising currents in the history of ‘Western learned magic’.&quot;

The IOT has been described as &quot;the Order for &#x27;serious&#x27; Chaos Magicians in the same way that the OTO exists for &#x27;serious&#x27; Thelemites.&quot; The IOT is considered to be an occult or neoshamanic organization.

==Name==
The formal name of the group is &quot;The Magical Pact of the Illuminates of Thanateros&quot;. The name &quot;Thanateros&quot; is a combination of the names &quot;Thanatos&quot; and &quot;Eros&quot;, the Greek gods of death and sex, respectively. The idea is that sex and death represent the positive and negative methods of attaining &quot;magical consciousness&quot;. The word &quot;Illuminates&quot; refers to the claimed tradition of calling societies where those who have mastered the secrets of magic help bring others to mastership &quot;the Illuminati&quot;.

==History==
===Early===
In 1976, Ray Sherwin and Peter Carroll, two young British occultists interested in ritual magic, began to publish a magazine called &quot;The New Equinox&quot;. Both were connected with a burgeoning occult scene developing around The Phoenix, a metaphysical bookshop in London&#x27;s East End. Dissatisfied with the state of the magical arts and the deficiencies they saw in the available occult groups, they announced the creation of the Illuminates of Thanateros in a 1978 issue of their magazine. They described it as a new kind of magical order and a meritocracy with strict admission criteria, where membership was based on demonstrable magical ability, rather than on invitation by members. They described the IOT as a &quot;spiritual heir&quot; to the Zos Kia Cultus and a &quot;fusion of Thelemic Magick, Tantra, The Sorceries of Zos and Tao&quot;. Subsequently, the group has sought to legitimize itself less through tradition and more through results-based experimentation.
The group&#x27;s formation was heavily affected by anarchic and countercultural ideas and in their descriptions of the practice of chaos magic, &quot;chaos is depicted not simply as a cosmic force, but as a call to action and destabilization against the establishment and against reality itself.&quot; In contrast to established neopagan, occultist or esoteric Christian magical organizations, it took its experimentalist approach and many of its concepts from science, especially chaos theory, as many of its early members were scientists.

The group says about itself that in its early years, it was &quot;rarely more than a loose correspondence network and a few people meeting for rituals in East Morton&quot; and that the sustained organization was established only in 1987. By 1989 it had grown to 130 members worldwide. Members included Timothy Leary and Robert Anton Wilson, as well as William Burroughs.

===Ourano-Barbarian===

In early years the IOT developed their own magical language to use in rituals. Ourano-Barbarian is not spoken as an everyday language and its purpose is to distract the conscious mind and free the magician from the linear thought process while creating ritual proclamations and statements of intent. &quot;One theory is that by using nonunderstandable language in ritual situations, this type of language occupies the verbal parts of consciousness, allowing a certain amount of Freedom of Belief to arise in the rest of the brain&quot;.

===Ice magick schism===
In the early 1990s the order experienced a schism as a result of conflicts about the doctrine of &#x27;ice magick&#x27;, a major proponent of which was Ralph Tegtmeier.

Peter Carroll learned more about the racial doctrines that Tegtmeier was teaching, and criticized him for it. That led to an untenable conflict between Carroll and Tegtmeier, which culminated in Tegtmeier and all of his followers seceding. The vast majority of German and Swiss members left the order, which constituted about 30% of the order&#x27;s total membership. Ralph Tegtmeier and a few others were subsequently excommunicated.

===Recent===
After publishing &quot;Liber Kaos&quot;, Carroll retired from active participation in the order, though he remains on good terms with many of the longstanding members.

The group claims to have been &quot;constantly evolving&quot; and grown highly diverse, and has grown to include local representations in additional regions such as Bulgaria, France, Greece, Poland. It maintains various social media channels and regularly offers events that are open to non-members.

The order organizes local groups (Temples) and larger meetings where members can take part in magical work in group context: “IOT Temples are autonomous, provided they follow a few basic rules, which keep the IOT’s identity intact. This means that there isn’t a single type of work that all Temples will engage in – each is an affinity group with its own specifications. Throughout the Pact, the variety of working paradigms and magical models used is quite extensive”.

<doc id="347260" wikidata="Q3181006" url="?curid=347260" title="Lochaber">
<text>Lochaber ( ; ) is a name applied to a part of the Scottish Highlands. Historically, it was a provincial lordship consisting of the parishes of Kilmallie and Kilmonivaig. Lochaber once extended from the Northern shore of Loch Leven, a district called Nether Lochaber, to beyond Spean Bridge and Roybridge, which area is known as Brae Lochaber or &quot;Braigh Loch Abar&quot; in Gaelic. For local government purposes, the name was used for one of the landward districts of Inverness-shire from 1930 to 1975, and then for one of the districts of the Highland region from 1975 to 1996. Since 1996 the Highland Council has had a Lochaber area committee.

The main town of Lochaber is Fort William. Other moderate sized settlements in Lochaber include Mallaig, Ballachulish and Glencoe.

==Name==
William Watson outlined two schools of thought on this topic. He favoured the idea that &quot;Abar&quot; came from the Pictish and Welsh for &quot;river mouth&quot; and that &quot;Loch Abar&quot; meant the confluence of the Lochy and the Nevis as they flowed into Loch Linnhe, in Gaelic. He also conceded that &quot;abar&quot; might also come from the Gaelic , meaning &quot;mud&quot; or &quot;swampy place&quot;. Thus Lochaber could be the &quot;loch of swamps&quot;, a historic water feature that existed on the Blàr Mòr, where the area&#x27;s High School and Health Centre are situated today. Other experts favour the &quot;swamp&quot; derivation. A Lochaber person is called an Abrach.

==History==

Lochaber is first recorded in the &quot;Life of Columba&quot; written in c.690 by Adomnán, the Abbot of Iona Abbey. Although there are no known Pictish stones within the area, Ardnamurchan Point is believed to have marked the boundary between the lands ruled by the Picts to the north and east, and those ruled by migrating Irish clans in Dál Riata to the south.

Archaeological evidence of earlier structures supports the tradition that Inverlochy Castle was built on the site of an earlier Pictish settlement, described by the historian Hector Boece in 1526 as a &quot;city ... much frequented with merchants of France and Spain&quot;, but destroyed by the Vikings. Lochaber contains no early monastic locations, but the numerous placenames starting with the element &quot;Kil-&quot; or &quot;Cille-&quot; suggest early Christian sites dating from the period 600-900, while the placename element &quot;annat&quot; found near Corpach suggests the site of an early mother church. Placename evidence also suggests the presence of Viking settlements in the Morvern and Ballachulish areas, but nowhere north and east of Fort William.

Lochaber formed part of the Province of Moray from the early 12th century at the latest. It was first recorded as a provincial lordship at the end of the 13th century, but a &quot;Steward of Lochaber&quot; is recorded witnessing a charter sealed by Walter Comyn, Lord of Badenoch in 1234, suggesting that Lochaber had already been granted as a lordship by that date, and had probably, like Badenoch, been granted to Comyn by Alexander II in 1229.

It was therefore one of the seven lordships created within Moray by ca. 1230 that as well as Badenoch included The Aird, Glencarnie, Abernethy, Stratha&#x27;an and Strathbogie. The lordship was made up of the two parishes of Kilmallie and Kilmonivaig and had its &quot;caput&quot; at Inverlochy Castle.

Lochaber was one of the territories that King Robert the Bruce gave to his friend, Angus Òg Macdonald, Lord of the Isles, who fought by his side during the First Scottish War of Independence, including the successful Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. In turn, Angus Òg gave Ardnamurchan to his younger brother, Iain Sprangach MacDonald (first Chief of Clan MacDonald of Ardnamurchan), and he gave his illegitimate son, Iain Fraoch MacDonald the Chiefdom of Clan MacDonald of Glencoe. In 1376, King Robert II confirmed John of Islay, Lord of the Isles and son of Angus Òg MacDonald, control of Colonsay, Kintyre and Knapdale and granted Lochaber to John and his new wife Princess Margaret as a part of her dowry. In turn, John of Islay&#x27;s son, Reginald, (first Chief of Clanranald and Glengarry), through his first marriage of Amie MacRuari, were given charter to the old lands of Clann Ruaidhrí in Lochaber. Jogn of Islay&#x27;s other son, Donald of Islay, Lord of the Isles, gave the province to his brother, Alistair Carragh Macdonald, who became both the Lord of Lochaber and the 1st Chief of Clan MacDonald of Keppoch.

In the Middle Ages, Clan Cameron was the principal and dominant Scottish clan in Lochaber. Other important clans included: MacDonald of Keppoch, MacDonell of Glengarry, MacMillan and MacIntosh. To enforce Scots Law, the old province of Moray was also divided into shires (areas administered by a sheriff). The western parts of Moray, including the provincial lordships of Lochaber, Badenoch and the Aird were included in Inverness-shire, being the area administered by the Sheriff of Inverness. Over time the shires were given more administrative functions, whereas the old provinces and provincial lordships gradually lost their functions.

===Seventeenth to nineteenth centuries===
Some historians argue the late seventeenth-century Scottish Highlands were more peaceful than often suggested, in part because chiefs could be fined for crimes committed by their clansmen. The exception was Lochaber, identified as a refuge for cattle raiders and thieves by government officials, other chiefs and Gaelic poets. Four local clans were consistently named in such accounts: the Glencoe and Keppoch MacDonalds, the MacGregors and the Camerons. In September 1688, James VII outlawed the Keppoch MacDonalds for attacking his troops at the Battle of Mulroy, shortly before he was deposed by the November 1688 Glorious Revolution.

Beginning in 1740, Lochaber was the residence of Fr. Alexander Cameron, a nobleman from Clan Cameron and outlawed Roman Catholic priest of the Society of Jesus. For five years prior to the Uprising of 1745, Fr. Cameron&#x27;s secret residence was located under the cliff of a big boulder at Brae of Craskie in Glenannich, from which he and two other priests, Frs. John and Charles Farquarson, ran a highly successful vicariate in both Lochaber and Strathglass for the strictly illegal and underground Catholic Church in Scotland.

Many local residents took part in the Jacobite Rising of 1745, and the reprisals inflicted by government troops after the Battle of Culloden is still referred to in the Highlands and Islands as , or &quot;Year of the Pillaging&quot;. Thereafter, the local population was further reduced by the Highland Clearances and voluntary emigration, including the poet Ailean a&#x27; Ridse MacDhòmhnaill, who emigrated and settled in Mabou, Nova Scotia in 1816. In 1900, his son Canadian Gaelic poet Alasdair a&#x27; Ridse MacDhòmhnaill wrote, &quot;They say the best singers and &quot;Seanachies&quot; left Scotland. They left Lochaber for certain.&quot;

According to John Watts, after the estate clearances ordered by Laird Ranald George Macdonald at the height of the Highland Potato Famine and their assisted passage to Australia through the Highland and Island Emigration Society, Little River and Belmont were the main population centers in the Colony of Victoria for Roman Catholic Scottish Gaels from Lochaber and Moidart. The Gaels of Little River were joined in 1857 by their former parish priest from Scotland, Fr Ronald Rankin (c.1785-1863), who is best known as the author of the Scottish Gaelic Christmas carol Tàladh Chrìosda.

In 1879, a visitor to Canada from Scotland enthusiastically declared that the Lochaber dialect of the Scottish Gaelic language was better preserved, &quot;with the most perfect accent, and with scarcely any, if any, admixture of English&quot;, in Glengarry County and in Cornwall, Ontario than in Lochaber itself.

===Recent history===
In 2023, Lochaber, with Ben Nevis, was put forwarded as a potential new National Park, however it was not successful in its bid.

==Governance==
There has been no administrative area called Lochaber since 1996, but the Highland Council has a committee area called Lochaber. The committee comprises the councillors representing the two wards of Fort William and Ardnamurchan and Caol and Mallaig, which together cover broadly the same area as the pre-1996 Lochaber District.

===Administrative history===
The medieval lordship of Lochaber was never explicitly abolished, but more significant administrative functions were gradually given to other bodies, particularly the Sheriff of Inverness, the Commissioners of Supply for Inverness-shire established in 1667, and then the Inverness-shire County Council created in 1890. Lochaber&#x27;s main town of Fort William was governed as a police burgh with a town council from 1875.

A local government district called Lochaber was created in 1930, when Scotland&#x27;s parish councils were abolished. Instead of having parish councils, the landward (outside a burgh) area of each county was divided into landward districts, each with a district council. The Lochaber district created in 1930 covered the parts of the parishes of Kilmallie and Kilmonivaig which lay outside the burgh of Fort William, plus the three parishes of Arisaig and Moidart, Glenelg, and Small Isles. Although the Lochaber district created in 1930 did not include the burgh of Fort William, the district council nevertheless established its offices in the town.
Local government in Scotland was reformed again in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which abolished Scotland&#x27;s counties, burghs and landward districts and replaced them with a two-tier system of regions and districts. One of the new districts was also called Lochaber, covering the combined area of the former Lochaber district plus the burgh of Fort William from Inverness-shire, plus the Ardnamurchan district and the Ballachulish and Kinlochleven electoral divisions from Argyll. The post-1975 Lochaber District Council was a district-level authority, with regional-level functions provided by the Highland Regional Council, based in Inverness.

The boundaries of the district created in 1975 included Glen Coe, Nether Lochaber, the western part of the Rannoch Moor, the Road to the Isles, Moidart, Ardgour, Morvern, Sunart, Ardnamurchan, and the Small Isles (Rùm, Eigg, Muck and Canna).

Throughout the district council&#x27;s existence from 1975 to 1996 a majority of the seats were held by independents. The council was initially based at Tweeddale, before moving to the neighbouring Lochaber House in 1979, both being adjoining 1970s office buildings with shops on the ground floor on the High Street in Fort William. Tweeddale subsequently served as the area office for the Highland Regional Council.

The districts and regions created in 1975 were abolished in 1996, under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 and replaced with single-tier council areas. The Highland region became one of the new council areas.

==Cultural references==
The Shakespearean character Banquo was Thane of Lochaber and a kinsman of his friend Macbeth. His home is reputed to have been at Tor Castle above the River Lochy, near Seangan.

&quot;Lochaber No More&quot; is a traditional folk song, first compiled in 1760 — with additional lyrics penned by Allan Ramsay in the 1720s — but with a melody also known in Ireland (where it may very well have originated) as &quot;Lament for Limerick&quot; or &quot;Limerick&#x27;s Lamentation&quot;. The melody was also popular in England — used in &quot;Amintor&#x27;s Lamentation for Celia&#x27;s Unkindness&quot;, a broadside ballad from the 19th century. The phrase &quot;Lochaber no more&quot; is borrowed by The Proclaimers as the start of the bridge in their hit song about the Scottish clearances &quot;Letter From America&quot;.

According to legend, a glaistig, a ghostly woman-goat hybrid, once lived in the area.

===Columba===
Lochaber is mentioned by Adomnan of Iona in his biography of St Columba on two occasions. Both stories are related to Columba using his saintly blessing to raise people out of poverty and make them wealthier.

==Infrastructure==
===Hospital===
The main hospital in Lochaber is Belford Hospital in Fort William. In 2023 exploratory work began to replace the hospital, with construction expected to begin in the Blar Mhor area near Cao in 2025, with an estimated completion date of 2028. In 2024 funding issues resulted in a potential delay for the construction of the new hospital with protests taking place in Fort William.

===Hydroelectric scheme===

The Lochaber hydroelectric scheme is a hydroelectric power generation project constructed in the Lochaber area after World War I.

<doc id="347261" wikidata="Q6061487" url="?curid=347261" title="Inward investment">
<text>Inward investment is the injection of money from an external source into a region, in order to purchase capital goods for a branch of a corporation to locate or develop its presence in the region.

Foreign sources, such as transnational corporations or multinational corporations invest money by introducing new industrial sites to an area, in order to produce more of their product, sometimes in response to changes noticed in that area, such as a growing population or enhanced transport network. Inward investment creates jobs in an area and brings wealth into the economy.

Some places do however attract inward investment due to their relative remoteness, for example a company wanting to recruit personnel with relatively common skills might deliberately relocate to an area where wage rates are relatively low, a factor that could arise because of the absence of similar jobs or localised underemployment. Some international investors might seek to take advantage of relatively lax regulation through investing abroad.

Some economic development agencies, governments or local authorities are occasionally accused of concentrating on attracting &quot;inward&quot; investment to such an extent that they neglect to nurture home-grown small businesses or entrepreneurs with exciting ideas. As with much marketing effort, a balance is often required to maximise economic progress that is socially and environmentally appropriate.

Another aspect of inward investment is financial inward investment activity, which rather than focusing on attracting &quot;offshoot&quot; operations of overseas companies, focuses on encouraging global focused overseas venture capitalist and hedge-fund investment into companies in a country or region.

<doc id="347264" wikidata="Q544018" url="?curid=347264" title="Basement Jaxx">
<text>Basement Jaxx are an English electronic music duo consisting of Felix Buxton (born 30 April 1973) and Simon Ratcliffe (born 28 November 1972). The pair got their name from the regular club night they held in Brixton, London, UK. They first rose to popularity in the underground house scene of the mid-1990s, but would go on to find international chart success and win Best Dance Act at both the 2002 and 2004 BRIT Awards. Their most successful singles are &quot;Red Alert&quot;, &quot;Rendez-Vu&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, and &quot;Where&#x27;s Your Head At&quot;.

== History ==
===Background===
Felix Buxton&#x27;s father The Rev Derek Major Buxton (4 February 1931 - 17 March 2022) was a Leicestershire vicar, who was ordained on Sunday 18 December 1960 in Leicester Cathedral. His father was originally from Leigh, Staffordshire, the second son of James Buxton, who died in 1969. In the early 1960s, his father was the assistant Anglican chaplain of the University of Leicester, moving to Ibstock in May 1969. The Rev Buxton and wife Eileen moved from Ibstock (St Denys) with Heather, to St Paul&#x27;s Woodhouse Eaves and St Mary&#x27;s church in Woodhouse on 27 April 1987, with a ceremony conducted by the Bishop of Leicester, on Tuesday 5 May 1987. His father retired in April 1998.

Felix Buxton studied Engineering Design at the University of Exeter.

===1992–1998: Formation===
In 1992, Simon Ratcliffe began releasing white label records, gaining him the attention of several music producers including LTJ Bukem and Goldie. The success of these releases enabled him to buy a few electronic musical instruments and set up a basic studio in a friend&#x27;s mother&#x27;s basement.

Ratcliffe and Buxton first met in 1993 through a mutual friend in a pub in Clapham, London. The two bonded over an appreciation of New York house music. They released their first extended play called &quot;EP1&quot; via the British independent record label Wall of Sound, with the help of its founder Mark Jones. The album went on to sell over 1,000 copies and was played on American radio by Tony Humphries in New York City.

Basement Jaxx began in Brixton, South London, in 1994, where Ratcliffe and Buxton held a regular club night called Basement Jaxx. The night was also held in a variety of venues including The George IV, The Crypt and The Junction. They were joined by DJs including DJ Sneak, Daft Punk, and singer Corrina Joseph. They mutated the night into an equally popular club called Rooty, the namesake of their second album. Initially, the duo considered &quot;Underground Oasis&quot; as a name for the group, but the idea was scrapped reportedly after a friend informed them of a similarly named rock band that might &quot;get big&quot;.

An important milestone for Basement Jaxx&#x27;s career was their role as the opening act for successful French dance group Daft Punk&#x27;s Daftendirektour. It was around this time that Basement Jaxx began collaborating with vocalist Corrina Joseph, a collaboration that resulted in the single &quot;Fly Life&quot;, which was released by Virgin Records in 1997. Following the success of &quot;Fly Life&quot;, the duo signed a record deal with XL, with whom they released their subsequent six albums.

===1999–2001: &quot;Remedy&quot;===
In 1999, the group released their first full-length album, &quot;Remedy&quot;. It included the singles &quot;Red Alert&quot;, &quot;Jump n&#x27; Shout&quot;, &quot;Bingo Bango&quot;, and &quot;Rendez-Vu&quot;, which is Basement Jaxx&#x27;s highest UK Singles Chart entry to date, at number 4. Basement Jaxx also released &quot;Jaxx Unreleased&quot;, a compilation album of B-sides, remixes, and other assorted material, in 1999. 2000 saw them release &quot;Camberwell&quot;, another release of new material.

===2001–2004: &quot;Rooty&quot;===
Their next album, 2001&#x27;s &quot;Rooty&quot; included singles &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Jus 1 Kiss&quot;, &quot;Where&#x27;s Your Head At?&quot;, and &quot;Do Your Thing&quot;, which was featured in the film &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot; as well as Nickelodeon and Coca-Cola commercials. The music video for album opener &quot;Romeo&quot; is an homage to the Bollywood film style. &quot;Where&#x27;s Your Head At?&quot; became an international hit in 2002, also known for its inclusion on the &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; soundtrack. &quot;Do Your Thing&quot; was included in the video game &quot;SSX 3&quot;. &quot;Xxtra Cutz&quot; was released shortly after &quot;Rooty&quot;, containing B-sides from the album&#x27;s singles. &quot;Span Thang&quot; and &quot;Junction&quot;, two EPs, were released in 2001–2002.

Basement Jaxx decided to close the Rooty club in May 2001 after it became &quot;too popular.&quot;

===2003–2005: &quot;Kish Kash&quot; and &quot;The Singles&quot;===
In 2003, Basement Jaxx released their third full-length album, &quot;Kish Kash&quot;, which included contributions from Siouxsie Sioux, Lisa Kekaula (of the Bellrays), Me&#x27;shell Ndegeocello, Dizzee Rascal, Totlyn Jackson, JC Chasez and Phoebe. From this album, the tracks &quot;Lucky Star&quot;, &quot;Good Luck&quot;, and &quot;Plug It In&quot; were released as singles. The track &quot;Good Luck&quot; was re-released in 2004, after exposure from being the theme to BBC&#x27;s Euro 2004 coverage, and was also featured in the soundtrack of &quot;Just Married&quot; and &quot;Appleseed&quot;, an anime film released in 2004. &quot;Kish Kash&quot; was recognised the following year at the 47th Grammy Awards, winning Buxton and Ratcliffe the inaugural Best Electronic/Dance Album award.

Basement Jaxx&#x27;s manager, Andrew Mansi, says Astralwerks chose not to renew its U.S. licensing contract with the duo.

The duo produced &quot;Shake It&quot;, a song from JC Chasez&#x27;s &quot;Schizophrenic&quot;.

In 2005, the duo released the number 1 compilation &quot;The Singles&quot; along with a video collection on DVD, comprising all the singles from their previous three albums, some earlier releases (featured on &quot;Atlantic Jaxx Recordings: A Compilation&quot;), and two new tracks, &quot;Oh My Gosh&quot; and &quot;U Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot;, which were both released as singles. &quot;The Singles (Special Edition)&quot; was also released, which contained the original compilation along with a bonus disc entitled &quot;Bonus Traxx&quot;, containing many previously unreleased tracks, as well as remixes of existing Basement Jaxx songs. The duo appeared as a headline act on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury Festival in 2005 when Kylie Minogue was forced to pull out after being diagnosed with cancer. Basement Jaxx played with a live band made up of artists who recorded the album. Drumtech-trained Nathan &#x27;Tugg&#x27; Curran was on drums for Glastonbury and has remained a constant performer.

===2006–2010: &quot;Crazy Itch Radio&quot; and &quot;Scars&quot;===

Their fourth studio album, &quot;Crazy Itch Radio&quot;, was released on 4 September 2006 in the UK, simultaneously with its first single, &quot;Hush Boy&quot;. The album featured guest vocals by Martina Sorbara (credited as &quot;Martina Bang&quot;), Lily Allen, and Robyn. In 2006, Basement Jaxx were also one of the support acts for Robbie Williams on his &#x27;Close Encounters&#x27; tour. For Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s &quot;Bring Ya to the Brink&quot; in 2008, they produced and wrote the track &quot;Rocking Chair&quot;. They also released a trilogy of EPs of new material, entitled &quot;Planet&quot;.

In 2009, Buxton revealed in a BBC Radio 1 broadcast that Basement Jaxx&#x27;s forthcoming album &quot;Scars&quot; was completed and being mastered. Buxton stated that the tracks include guest appearances by Yoko Ono, Santigold, Lightspeed Champion, and Yo! Majesty. The band was also interested in getting Grace Jones to add vocals to the new album. The album was released in September 2009. The first single &quot;Raindrops&quot; preceded it in June 2009. The band recorded at the Bizspace centre in Coldharbour Lane, in Loughborough Junction.

Also in 2009, their album &quot;Zephyr&quot; was released.

In 2010, the duo released the non-album single &quot;Dracula&quot;.

===2011–present: &quot;Attack the Block&quot; and &quot;Junto&quot;===
2011 saw the duo collaborating twice: with Metropole Orkest for the live album &quot;Basement Jaxx vs. Metropole Orkest&quot;, and also with Stephen Price for the soundtrack to the 2011 film &quot;Attack the Block&quot;.

In November 2011, Simon revealed the pair were working on a new album – hinting that some tracks were already appearing in their DJ sets. At their first live show for several years at Chiswick House Festival in July 2012, the band performed some new material from their forthcoming album including the song &quot;Diamonds&quot;. Possible tracks that were predicted to appear on the album according to Pitchfork include &quot;Make.Believe&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Rock this Road Together&quot;, &quot;Back 2 the Wild&quot;, &quot;We R Not Alone&quot;, &quot;Galactical&quot;, &quot;Power 2 The People&quot;, &quot;Mermaid of Salinas&quot;, &quot;People of Planet Earth&quot;, and &quot;What a Difference Your Love Makes&quot;. The band ran a contest through graphic design firm JDO, where the band will use the graphic identity (including the album and single artwork designs) that the winner created for their upcoming album and consequent promotional items.

&quot;Back 2 the Wild&quot; was released as a single on 12 April 2013, with an accompanying video co-directed by Matt Maitland and Natalia Stuyk being uploaded to their YouTube account on 16 April, though the single ultimately did not appear on the upcoming album.

&quot;What a Difference Your Love Makes&quot; was released as a single on 30 September 2013. The single&#x27;s accompanying video was released on Vevo on 7 August 2013. It was directed by Damian Weilers and shot in South Africa. On 1 May 2014, Basement Jaxx released a new song for the album called &quot;Unicorn&quot; on SoundCloud.

On 19 May 2014, Basement Jaxx officially announced their seventh album, &quot;Junto&quot;, which was released on 25 August 2014 through Atlantic Jaxx and PIAS. In July, the duo released the first lead single off the album, &quot;Never Say Never&quot;. The music video, directed by Saman Kesh, is about the development of a &quot;twerking&quot; robot that is intended to save humanity from a world without dancing and features the robotic prototype simulation of human buttocks &quot;Shiri&quot; developed by the Japanese scientist Nobuhiro Takahashi.

==Other projects==

In addition to their own work, Basement Jaxx have become in-demand remixers. Their more prominent work includes remixes of &quot;4 My People&quot; by Missy &quot;Misdemeanor&quot; Elliott, &quot;Everyman… Everywoman…&quot; by Yoko Ono, &quot;Like I Love You&quot; by Justin Timberlake, and &quot;She Wants to Move&quot; by N.E.R.D, which was included as a B-side on the follow-up single &quot;Maybe.&quot; They also collaborated with Janet Jackson on unreleased songs for her &quot;Damita Jo&quot; album. Sophie Ellis-Bextor, as well as The Botz and Garold Marks, have stated they are fans and would like to collaborate with Basement Jaxx in the future.

In 2021, the duo remixed Australian singer Kylie Minogue&#x27;s 2020 single &quot;Say Something&quot;, which can currently be found on YouTube; additionally, it will be available on the deluxe version of Minogue&#x27;s latest album—entitled &quot;Disco: Guest List Edition&quot;—from 12 November 2021&quot;.&quot;

The duo were invited to write an exclusive piece of music to accompany a work of art they admired in London&#x27;s Tate Modern museum, Karel Appel&#x27;s &quot;Hip, Hip, Hoorah!&quot;. The work was initially not available for sale, but later appeared on the album &quot;Zephyr&quot;. In 2007, their track &quot;Close Your Eyes&quot;, sung by Linda Lewis, was featured in the Japanese CGI anime movie &quot;Vexille&quot;.

Felix Buxton appeared on &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; on 23 September 2013 – the opening episode of Series 27, on Noel Fielding&#x27;s team.

In 2019, the duo composed the music for the CITV animated series &quot;The Rubbish World of Dave Spud&quot;. The duo also collaborated with The Sydney Metropolitan Orchestra for a live re-imagining of some of their classic songs.

In 2021, they composed the title music for the CBeebies series &quot;What&#x27;s On Your Head?&quot;.

==Musical style==
In the past, Buxton&#x27;s father did not let him watch &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and played his children Austrian music and Japanese music instead. &quot;He was always very proud of that we didn&#x27;t watch &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. [...] He thought that made me hungry and want it more,&quot; he said. He was a big fan of American house music, which was difficult to get hold of in his hometown at the time. &quot;I used to listen to Choice FM where the legends of the scene could be heard and went to Blackmarket Records in London’s Soho to try and find the sounds I was looking for.&quot;

Basement Jaxx&#x27;s music has been described variously as house and big beat over the course of their career. Prince&#x27;s influence has also been found on their music. &quot;I remember when we first came to America, they had to work out which radio stations we could go to,&quot; Buxton says. &quot;They said that in a way we were a bit for urban stations, we were a bit for pop stations. They didn’t know where to place us and things were very segregated back then.&quot;

<doc id="347265" wikidata="Q815116" url="?curid=347265" title="Siege of Acre (1189–1191)">
<text>The siege of Acre was the first significant counterattack by Guy of Jerusalem against Saladin, leader of the Muslims in Syria and Egypt. This pivotal siege formed part of what later became known as the Third Crusade. The siege lasted from August 1189 until July 1191, in which time the city&#x27;s coastal position meant the attacking Latin force were unable to fully invest the city and Saladin was unable to fully relieve it with both sides receiving supplies and resources by sea. Finally, it was a key victory for the Crusaders and a serious setback for Saladin&#x27;s ambition to destroy the Crusader states.

==Background==
Egypt was ruled by the Shi&#x27;ite Fatimid dynasty from 969, independent from the Sunni Abbasid rulers in Baghdad and with a rival Shi&#x27;ite caliph—that is &quot;successor&quot; to the Muslim prophet Mohammad. Governance fell to the caliph&#x27;s chief administrator called the vizier. From 1121 the system fell into murderous political intrigue and Egypt declined from its previous affluent state. This encouraged Baldwin III of Jerusalem to plan an invasion that was only halted by the payment by Egypt of a tribute of 160,000 gold dinars. In 1163 the deposed vizier, Shawar, visited Zengi&#x27;s son and successor, Nur ad-Din, atabeg of Aleppo, in Damascus seeking political and military support. Some historians have considered Nur ad-Din&#x27;s support as a visionary attempt to surround the Crusaders, but in practice he prevaricated before only responding when it became clear that the Crusaders might gain an unassailable foothold on the Nile. Nur al-Din sent his Kurdish general, Shirkuh, who stormed Egypt and restored Shawar. However, Shawar asserted his independence and allied with Baldwin&#x27;s brother and successor Amalric of Jerusalem. When Amalric broke the alliance in a ferocious attack, Shawar again requested military support from Syria and Shirkuh was sent by Nur ad-Din for a second time. Amalric retreated, but the victorious Shirkuh had Shawar executed and was appointed vizier. Barely two months later he died to be succeeded by his nephew, Yusuf ibn Ayyub, who has become known by his honorific , &#x27;the goodness of faith&#x27;, which in turn has become westernised as Saladin. Nur al-Din died in 1174. He was the first Muslim to unite Aleppo and Damascus in the Crusade era. Some Islamic contemporaries promoted the idea that there was a natural Islamic resurgence under Zengi, through Nur al-Din to Saladin, although this was not as straightforward and simple as it appears. Saladin imprisoned all the Caliph&#x27;s heirs preventing them from having children, as opposed to having them all killed which would have been normal practice, to extinguish the bloodline. Assuming control after the death of his overlord, Nur al-Din, Saladin had the strategic choice of establishing Egypt as an autonomous power or attempting to become the preeminent Muslim in the Eastern Mediterraneanhe chose the latter.

As Nur al-Din&#x27;s territories fragmented after his death, Saladin legitimised his ascent through positioning himself as a defender of Sunni Islam subservient to both the Caliph of Baghdad and Nur al-Din&#x27;s son and successor, As-Salih Ismail al-Malik. In his early ascendency he seized Damascus and much of Syria, but not Aleppo. After the building a defensive force to resist a planned attack by the Kingdom of Jerusalem that never materialised his first contest with the Latin Christians was not a success. His overconfidence and tactical errors led to defeat at the Battle of Montgisard. Despite this setback, Saladin established a domain stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates through a decade of politics, coercion and low level military action. After a life-threatening illness, he determined to make good on his propaganda as the champion of Islam, embarking on heightened campaigning against the Latin Christians. King Guy responded by raising the largest army that Jerusalem had ever put in the field. However, Saladin lured the force into inhospitable terrain without water, surrounded the Latins with a superior force and routed them at the Battle of Hattin. Saladin offered the Christians the options of remaining in peace under Islamic rule or taking advantage of 40 days&#x27; grace to leave. As a result, much of Palestine quickly fell to Saladin including, after a short 5 day siege, Jerusalem. According to Benedict of Peterborough, Pope Urban III died of deep sadness on 19 October 1187 on hearing of the defeat. Pope Gregory VIII issued a papal bull named that proposed a further Crusade, later numbered the Third, to recapture Jerusalem. Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor died en route to Jerusalem, drowning in the Saleph River, and few of his men reached the Eastern Mediterranean.

==Tyre==

In Tyre, Conrad of Montferrat had entrenched himself and had successfully resisted Saladin&#x27;s assault at the end of 1187. The sultan then turned his attention to other tasks, but then tried to negotiate the surrender of the city by treaty, as in mid-1188 the first reinforcements from Europe arrived at Tyre by sea. Under the terms of the treaty, Saladin would, among other things, release King Guy, whom he had captured at Hattin. This would have escalated the conflict between Guy, who was blamed for the catastrophe of Hattin, and Conrad, who had successfully defended Tyre from the subsequent invasion. Guy was released and appeared before Tyre, but Conrad would not let him in, claiming that he was administering it until the kings should arrive from across the sea to settle the succession. This was in accordance with Baldwin IV&#x27;s will: he was the nearest paternal kinsman of Baldwin V. Guy left before appearing once again outside Tyre with his wife Queen Sibylla, who held the legal title to the kingdom, but he was again rejected by Conrad, and he set up his camp outside the gates of the city.

Acre was an important port, and Saladin and his advisors considered how to prepare for the possibility that the crusaders would attempt to capture the city. Opinion was split on whether the city&#x27;s fortification should be reinforced or whether they should destroy the city to prevent its capture. Saladin decided on the former option, and historian Hannes Möhring suggested the approach of destroying Acre to prevent it from being used by the crusaders would only have been effective if a similar approach was taken at other cities and ports along the coast.

In late spring 1188, William II of Sicily sent a fleet with 200 knights; on 6 April 1189, Ubaldo Lanfranchi, Archbishop of Pisa, arrived with 52 ships. Guy succeeded in bringing both contingents over to his side. In August, Conrad again refused him entry to the city, so he broke camp and made his way south to attack Acre; he and his troops travelled along the coast, while the Pisans and Sicilians went by sea. Guy urgently needed a firm base from which he could organize a counterattack on Saladin, and since he could not have Tyre, he directed his plans to Acre, () to the south. Thus Guy and Conrad were allies against Saladin.

==Beginning of the siege==
The port of Acre lay on a peninsula in the Gulf of Haifa. East of the old part of the city was the port, protected against the open sea, while to the west and south the coast was protected by a strong dyke wall. The peninsula was guarded on the mainland side by double barrier reinforced with towers. As one of Saladin&#x27;s main garrison nodes and arms depots, the force defending Acre was significant, consisting of several thousand troops. Guy&#x27;s army consisted of 7,000–9,000 infantry and 400–700 knights. Hattin had left the Kingdom of Jerusalem with few troops left to call upon. In such a scenario, Guy was totally dependent on aid from the plethora of small armies and fleets descending on the Levant from around Europe.

Initially Guy tried to surprise the garrison with an assault on the walls, but this failed and Guy established his camp outside the city, to wait for reinforcements, which began to arrive by sea a few days later. A Danish and Frisian fleet replaced that of the Sicilians, who withdrew when they heard news of the death of William II. French and Flemish soldiers also arrived under James of Avesnes, Henry I of Bar, Andrew of Brienne, Robert II of Dreux, and his brother Philip of Dreux, the Bishop of Beauvais. Germans under Louis III, Landgrave of Thuringia, and Otto I of Guelders and Italians under Archbishop Gerhard of Ravenna and Bishop Adelard of Verona also arrived. Louis of Thuringia was able to convince Conrad, his mother&#x27;s cousin, to send troops from Tyre as well. Armenian troops under Leo II of Cilicia also took part in the siege. When Saladin was informed about this development, he gathered his troops and marched to Acre, where he unsuccessfully attacked Guy&#x27;s camp on 15 September.

==Battle of Acre==
On 4 October, Saladin moved to the east of the city to confront Guy&#x27;s camp. The Crusader army had grown to 30,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry through reinforcements by the end of September. A Christian fleet of at least 102 ships blockaded the city. The Muslim army consisted of troops from Egypt, Kurd, Turkestan, Syria, and Mesopotamia.

The Muslims lay in a semicircle east of the city facing inwards towards Acre. The Crusader army lay in between, with lightly armed crossbowmen in the first line and the heavy cavalry in second. At the later Battle of Arsuf the Christians fought coherently; here the battle began with a disjointed combat between the Templars and Saladin&#x27;s right wing. The Crusaders were so successful that the enemy had to send reinforcements from other parts of the field. Thus the steady advance of the Christian centre against Saladin&#x27;s own corps, in which the crossbows prepared the way for the charge of the men-at-arms, met with no great resistance. Saladin&#x27;s centre and right flanks were put to flight.

But the victors scattered to plunder. Saladin rallied his men, and, when the Christians began to retire with their booty, let loose his light cavalry upon them. No connected resistance was offered, and the Turks slaughtered the fugitives until checked by the fresh troops of the Christian right flank. Guy&#x27;s reserves, who were in the Christian camp containing the Saracen garrison at Acre, were sent to reinforce the Christian line. The garrison at Acre realized that the Christian camp was undefended, so launched an attack into the Christian left flank&#x27;s rear. They fell upon the Templars, assisting the Saracen right wing and inflicting heavy casualties. Gerard de Ridefort, Grand Master of the Templars, was killed. Andrew of Brienne was also killed and Conrad had to be rescued by Guy. In the end, the Crusaders repulsed the relieving army. Christian casualties ranged from 4,000 or 5,000 to 10,000 men. Saladin could not push them back without another pitched battle.

==Double siege==
During the autumn, more European Crusaders arrived, allowing Guy to blockade Acre by land. News of the imminent arrival of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa reached the Crusaders, which not only raised the morale of the Christian soldiers, but also compelled Saladin to bring in so many more troops that he was able to surround both the city and the Crusader camp in two separate sieges.

On 30 October, 50 Muslim galleys broke through the Christian sea blockade and reinforced the city with the crews of the ships, some 10,000 men, as well as food and weapons. On 17 December, an Egyptian fleet arrived to re-establish control over the port and the road leading to it. In March 1190, when the weather was better, Conrad travelled to Tyre on his own ship and soon returned with supplies for the Crusaders, which helped the resistance against the Egyptian fleet on the shore. The building materials brought by Conrad were constructed into siege machinery, although these machines were lost when the Crusaders tried to assault the city on 6 May.

On 20 May, Saladin, who had continued to strengthen his army over the previous months, began an attack on the Christian camp, which lasted eight days before it could be repelled. On 25 July, against the orders of their commanders, the Christian soldiers attacked Saladin&#x27;s right flank and were defeated. Further reinforcements from France arrived in the Crusader camp over the summer, led by Henry II of Champagne, Theobald V of Blois, Stephen I of Sancerre, Raoul I of Clermont, John of Fontigny, Alain of Saint-Valéry, the Archbishop of Besançon, the Bishop of Blois, and the Bishop of Toul. Duke Frederick VI of Swabia arrived at the beginning of October with the rest of his father&#x27;s army, after the Holy Roman Emperor had drowned in the Saleph River on 10 June, and shortly afterwards English Crusaders arrived under Baldwin of Exeter, Archbishop of Canterbury. In October, the Count of Bar also arrived, and the Christians had a breakthrough in Haifa, which allowed more food to be brought to the camp at Acre.

Life in the city and the Christian camp quickly became difficult after their containment by Saladin. Food remained limited, the water supply became contaminated with human and animal corpses, and epidemics soon began to spread. Louis of Thuringia, sick with malaria, made plans to return home when the French arrived, and died in Cyprus on the way back on 16 October. At some point between late July and October, Guy&#x27;s wife Queen Sibylla died, a few days after both of their daughters, Alais and Marie. With her death, Guy lost his claim to the throne of Jerusalem, as Sibylla was the legal heiress. Her rightful heir was her younger half-sister, Isabella of Jerusalem. Guy, however, refused to step aside for her.

The barons of the kingdom used this opportunity to rid themselves of Guy, and arranged the marriage of Conrad to Isabella. However, Isabella was already married to Humphrey IV of Toron, and Conrad&#x27;s marital status was uncertain (he had wed a Byzantine princess in 1187, a few months before arriving at Tyre, and it was unclear whether she had annulled the marriage in his absence). Also, Sibylla&#x27;s first husband had been Conrad&#x27;s older brother William Longsword, which made a marriage between Isabella and Conrad incestuous under canon law. Patriarch Eraclius was sick, and his appointed representative Baldwin of Exeter died suddenly on 19 November. Therefore, it was Archbishop Ubaldo Lanfranchi of Pisa a papal legate, as well as Philip, Bishop of Beauvais, who gave their consent to divorce Isabella from Humphrey on 24 November. Conrad withdrew with Isabella to Tyre, but Guy still insisted that he was king: the succession was not settled finally until an election in 1192.

Saladin&#x27;s army was now so large that it was impossible for any more Crusaders to arrive by land, and winter meant that no more supplies or reinforcements could arrive by sea. Acre had a garrison of 20,000 men in the winter of 1190–1191. In the Christian camp, the leaders began to succumb to the epidemics. Theobald of Blois, Stephen of Sancerre and Frederick of Swabia died, on 20 January 1191. Henry of Champagne struggled with sickness for many weeks before recovering. Patriarch Eraclius also died during the siege, but the date is unknown.

On 31 December, another attempt to breach the walls failed, and on 6 January, the partial collapse of the walls led to many Christian attempts at overrunning the Muslim garrisons. On 13 February, Saladin succeeded in breaking through the Christian lines and reaching the city, so that he could replace the exhausted defenders with a new garrison; otherwise, the old garrison would have all died of disease. Conrad of Montferrat attempted an attack by sea on the Tower of Flies, but adverse winds and rocks below the surface prevented his ship getting close enough to do significant damage. In March, however, when the weather was better and ships could once again unload supplies on the coast, the danger of failure was again averted for the Christians. Duke Leopold V of Austria arrived and took control of the Christian forces. Ships also brought devastating news for Saladin. He had missed his chance to crush the remaining Christians and now King Richard the Lionheart and King Philip Augustus were on their way to the Holy Land, each accompanied by an army. Saladin&#x27;s chance for victory had slipped away.

==Kings at Acre==
King Philip II arrived on 20 April, and King Richard I on 8 June, after he had used the opportunity to conquer Cyprus along the way. Richard arrived with an English fleet of 100 ships (which carried 8,000 men) while Philip II arrived with a Genoese fleet under Simone Doria. Philip had used the time before Richard&#x27;s arrival to build siege engines like the trebuchet, and now that stronger leadership from Europe had arrived, it was the city and not the Christian camp that was besieged. When Richard arrived, he sought a meeting with Saladin, and an armistice of three days was agreed upon so that the meeting could take place. However, both Richard and Philip fell ill, and the meeting did not take place.

King Philip was eager to launch a siege on Acre, but King Richard was not ready to go along with the plan because he was still ill and some of his men had not arrived yet due to adverse winds. They hoped that the latter would arrive with the next fleet of ships and would bring material for building siege machinery. Philip continued the project by himself, and on 17 June, fired an attack on Acre with ballistas and engines. The defending army made diverse ways to make noise and send up smoke from the fires to let Saladin and the outer army know that, as arranged, they were supposed to come to the help of the town.
The siege machines broke holes into the walls of Acre, but every new breach led to an attack from Saladin&#x27;s army, giving the garrison of Acre an opportunity to repair the damage while the Christians were distracted. On 1 June, Philip of Alsace, Count of Flanders and Vermandois and one of the king&#x27;s most important men, died in the camp. This caused a major crisis for the French king, since Philip had no heirs and settling his inheritance was an urgent matter, yet a very difficult one so far away from France.

On 2 July, Richard deployed his own siege engines, including two enormous mangonels named God&#x27;s Own Catapult and Bad Neighbour (Malevoisine in the original French). On 3 July, a sufficiently large breach was again created in the walls, but the Christian attack was repelled. On 4 July, the city offered its surrender, but Richard rejected the conditions. This time Saladin did not make a large-scale attack on the Christian camp. On 7 July, the city sent an embassy to Saladin asking for assistance one last time, and threatened to surrender if he did not help. On 11 July, there was one final battle, and on 12 July, the city once more offered terms of surrender to the Crusaders, who found their offer acceptable this time. Conrad of Montferrat, who had returned to Tyre because of Richard&#x27;s support for Guy of Lusignan as king of Jerusalem, was recalled to act as negotiator, at Saladin&#x27;s request. Saladin was not personally involved in the negotiations, but accepted the surrender. The Christians entered the city and the Muslim garrison was taken into captivity. Conrad raised the banners of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, France, England, and the Duchy of Austria over the city.

Leopold of Austria left shortly after the capture of the city, after quarrelling with Richard: as the surviving leader of the German Imperial contingent, he had demanded the same position as Philip and Richard, but had been rejected and his flag torn down from the ramparts of Acre. On 31 July, Philip also returned home, to settle the succession in Vermandois and Flanders, and Richard was left solely in charge of the Christian expeditionary forces.

==Execution of the prisoners==

It was now up to Richard and Saladin to finalize the surrender of the city. The Christians began to rebuild Acre&#x27;s defenses, and Saladin collected money to pay for the ransom of the imprisoned garrison. On 11 August, Saladin delivered the first of the three planned payments and prisoner exchanges, but Richard rejected this because certain Christian nobles were not included. The exchange was broken off and further negotiations were unsuccessful. Richard had also insisted on the handover of Philip&#x27;s share of the prisoners, whom the French king had entrusted to his kinsman Conrad of Montferrat. Conrad reluctantly agreed, under pressure. On 20 August, Richard thought that Saladin had delayed too much, and had 2,700 of the Muslim prisoners from the garrison of Acre decapitated.

The Muslim nobles amongst the prisoners were not included in the executions. Saladin responded in kind, killing all of the Christian prisoners he had captured. On 22 August, Richard and his army left the city, given in custody to the crusaders Bertram de Verdun and Stephen Longchamp.

==Aftermath==
The capture of Acre and the execution of its garrison led to a change in Saladin&#x27;s approach. Saladin was more inclined to pre-emptively demolish (slight) fortifications, and instead focused on enhancing the defences of Jerusalem. Möhring suggests the execution of the garrison would have deterred other garrisons from defending against Richard.

The Crusader army marched south, with the sea to their right and Saladin&#x27;s army following them to their left. On 7 September, they met at the Battle of Arsuf, north of Jaffa, in which Saladin was defeated. Richard captured Jaffa on 10 September, but throughout the remainder of 1191 and into the summer of 1192, he was unable to realize his ultimate goal of recapturing Jerusalem. The dispute over the kingship of Jerusalem was resolved in April 1192, with the election of Conrad of Montferrat, but he was assassinated only days after his victory. The pregnant Queen Isabella was quickly married to Richard and Philip&#x27;s nephew, Henry of Champagne.

Meanwhile, Richard was informed that his brother, John Lackland, was attempting to usurp the throne in England. He arranged for a treaty with Saladin, and the Third Crusade came to an end when Richard left for England in late October. Philip of France meanwhile had come to terms with John and had closed the French harbours; Richard was forced to make his way across the Adriatic Sea and went ashore near Aquileia. Due to the coming winter, crossing the Alps proved to be impossible, and the king &quot;incognito&quot; passed through the Austrian capital Vienna shortly before Christmas, where he was recognized, captured and imprisoned by Duke Leopold at Dürnstein.

Leopold did not hesitate to gain the support of Emperor Henry VI. In March 1193 he delivered Richard to the emperor, who had him arrested at Trifels Castle. The king was charged with the murder of Conrad, who was Leopold&#x27;s cousin, and also with insulting the Austrian duke by throwing down his banner at Acre. Richard refused the accusations and was backed by Pope Celestine III, who threatened Henry with excommunication; nevertheless, Richard&#x27;s imminent extradition to Philip of France made him strike a ransom deal. He was released for an enormous price, and did not return to his own territories until 1194.

The Kingdom of Jerusalem was now relatively secure, with its new capital at Acre, from which a narrow strip along the Mediterranean coast was ruled. This second incarnation of the Kingdom of Jerusalem endured for another century.

<text>The Iranian revolution (, ), also known as the 1979 revolution, or the Islamic revolution of 1979 (, ) was a series of events that culminated in the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1979. The revolution led to the replacement of the Imperial State of Iran by the present-day Islamic Republic of Iran, as the monarchical government of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was superseded by the theocratic Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a religious cleric who had headed one of the rebel factions. The ousting of Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, formally marked the end of Iran&#x27;s historical monarchy.

Following the 1953 Iran coup, Pahlavi aligned Iran with the Western Bloc and cultivated a close relationship with the US to consolidate his power as an authoritarian ruler. Relying heavily on American support amidst the Cold War, he remained the Shah of Iran for 26 years, keeping the country from swaying towards the influence of the Eastern Bloc and Soviet Union. Beginning in 1963, Pahlavi implemented widespread reforms aimed at modernizing Iran through an effort that came to be known as the White Revolution. Due to his opposition to this modernization, Khomeini was exiled from Iran in 1964. However, as ideological tensions persisted between Pahlavi and Khomeini, anti-government demonstrations began in October 1977, developing into a campaign of civil resistance that included communism, socialism, and Islamism. In August 1978, the deaths of about 400 people in the Cinema Rex fire due to arson by Islamic militants—claimed by the opposition as having been orchestrated by Pahlavi&#x27;s SAVAK—served as a catalyst for a popular revolutionary movement across Iran, and large-scale strikes and demonstrations paralyzed the country for the remainder of that year.

On 16 January 1979, Pahlavi went into exile as the last Iranian monarch, leaving his duties to Iran&#x27;s Regency Council and Shapour Bakhtiar, the opposition-based prime minister. On 1 February 1979, Khomeini returned, following an invitation by the government; several million greeted him as he landed in Tehran. By 11 February, the monarchy was brought down and Khomeini assumed leadership while guerrillas and rebel troops overwhelmed Pahlavi loyalists in armed combat. Following the March 1979 Islamic Republic referendum, in which 98% approved the shift to an Islamic republic, the new government began drafting the present-day Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran; Khomeini emerged as the Supreme Leader of Iran in December 1979.

The success of the revolution was met with surprise around the world, as it was unusual. It lacked many customary causes of revolutionary sentiment, e.g. defeat in war, financial crisis, peasant rebellion, or disgruntled military. It occurred in a country experiencing relative prosperity, produced profound change at great speed, was very popular, resulted in a massive exile that characterizes a large portion of Iranian diaspora, and replaced a pro-Western secular and authoritarian monarchy with an anti-Western Islamic republic based on the concept of (Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist), straddling between authoritarianism and totalitarianism. In addition to declaring the destruction of Israel as a core objective, post-revolutionary Iran aimed to undermine the influence of Sunni leaders in the region by supporting Shi&#x27;ite political ascendancy and exporting Khomeinist doctrines abroad. In the aftermath of the revolution, Iran began to back Shia militancy across the region, to combat Sunni influence and establish Iranian dominance in the Arab world, ultimately aiming to achieve an Iranian-led Shia political order.

==Background (1891–1977)==

Reasons advanced for the revolution and its populist, nationalist, and later Shia Islamic character include:

# A backlash against imperialism;
# The 1953 Iranian &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;;
# A rise in expectations created by the 1973 oil revenue windfall;
# An overly ambitious economic program;
# Anger over a short, sharp economic contraction in 1977–1978; and
# Other shortcomings of the previous regime.

The Shah&#x27;s regime was seen as an oppressive, brutal, corrupt, and lavish regime by some of the society&#x27;s classes at that time. It also suffered from some basic functional failures that brought economic bottlenecks, shortages, and inflation. The Shah was perceived by many as beholden to—if not a puppet of—a non-Muslim Western power (i.e., the United States) whose culture was affecting that of Iran. At the same time, support for the Shah may have waned among Western politicians and media—especially under the administration of U.S. President Jimmy Carter—as a result of the Shah&#x27;s support for OPEC petroleum price increases earlier in the decade. When President Carter enacted a human-rights policy which said that countries guilty of human-rights violations would be deprived of American arms or aid, this helped give some Iranians the courage to post open letters and petitions in the hope that the repression by the government might subside.

The revolution that substituted the monarchy of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi with Islam and Khomeini is credited in part to the spread of the Shi&#x27;a version of the Islamic revival. It resisted westernization and saw Ayatollah Khomeini as following in the footsteps of the Shi&#x27;a Imam Husayn ibn Ali, with the Shah playing the role of Husayn&#x27;s foe, the hated tyrant Yazid I. Other factors include the underestimation of Khomeini&#x27;s Islamist movement by both the Shah&#x27;s reign—who considered them a minor threat compared to the Marxists and Islamic socialists—and by the secularist opponents of the government—who thought the Khomeinists could be sidelined.

=== Tobacco Protest (1891) ===
At the end of the 19th century, the Shi&#x27;a clergy (&quot;ulama&quot;) had a significant influence on Iranian society. The clergy first showed itself to be a powerful political force in opposition to the monarchy with the 1891 Tobacco protest. On 20 March 1890, the long-standing Iranian monarch Nasir al-Din Shah granted a concession to British Major G. F. Talbot for a full monopoly over the production, sale, and export of tobacco for 50 years.
At the time, the Persian tobacco industry employed over 200,000 people, so the concession represented a major blow to Persian farmers and bazaaris whose livelihoods were largely dependent on the lucrative tobacco business. The boycotts and protests against it were widespread and extensive as result of Mirza Hasan Shirazi&#x27;s &quot;fatwa&quot; (judicial decree). Within 2 years, Nasir al-Din Shah found himself powerless to stop the popular movement and cancelled the concession.

The Tobacco Protest was the first significant Iranian resistance against the Shah and foreign interests, revealing the power of the people and the &quot;ulama&quot; influence among them.

=== Persian Constitutional Revolution (1905–1911) ===

The growing dissatisfaction continued until the Constitutional Revolution of 1905–1911. The revolution led to the establishment of a parliament, the National Consultative Assembly (also known as the &quot;Majlis&quot;), and approval of the first constitution. Although the constitutional revolution was successful in weakening the autocracy of the Qajar regime, it failed to provide a powerful alternative government. Therefore, in the decades following the establishment of the new parliament, a number of critical events took place. Many of these events can be viewed as a continuation of the struggle between the constitutionalists and the Shahs of Persia, many of whom were backed by foreign powers against the parliament.

=== Reza Shah (1921–1941) ===

Insecurity and chaos that were created after the Constitutional Revolution led to the rise of General Reza Khan, the commander of the elite Persian Cossack Brigade who seized power in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in February 1921. He established a constitutional monarchy, deposing the last Qajar Shah, Ahmad Shah, in 1925 and being designated monarch by the National Assembly, to be known thenceforth as Reza Shah, founder of the Pahlavi dynasty.

There were widespread social, economic, and political reforms introduced during his reign, a number of which led to public discontent that would provide the circumstances for the Iranian Revolution. Particularly controversial was the replacement of Islamic laws with Western ones and the forbidding of traditional Islamic clothing, separation of the sexes, and veiling of women&#x27;s faces with the niqab. Police forcibly removed and tore the chadors off women who resisted his ban on the public hijab.

In 1935, dozens were killed and hundreds injured in the Goharshad Mosque rebellion. On the other hand, during the early rise of Reza Shah, Abdul-Karim Ha&#x27;eri Yazdi founded the Qom Seminary and created important changes in seminaries. However, he would avoid entering into political issues, as did other religious leaders who followed him. Hence, no widespread anti-government attempts were organized by the clergy during the rule of Reza Shah. However, the future Ayatollah Khomeini was a student of Sheikh Abdul Karim Ha&#x27;eri.

=== Anglo-Soviet invasion and Mohammad Reza Shah (1941–1951) ===

In 1941, an invasion of allied British and Soviet troops deposed Reza Shah, who was considered friendly to Nazi Germany, and installed his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as Shah. Iran remained under Soviet occupation until the Red Army withdrew in June 1946.

The post-war years were characterized by political instability, as the Shah clashed with the pro-Soviet Prime Minister Ahmad Qavam, the communist Tudeh Party grew in size and influence and the Iranian Army had to deal with Soviet-sponsored separatist movements in Iranian Azerbaijan and Iranian Kurdistan.

=== Mosaddegh and The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (1951–1952) ===

From 1901 on, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (renamed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1935), a British oil company, enjoyed a monopoly on sale and production of Iranian oil. It was the most profitable British business in the world. Most Iranians lived in poverty while the wealth generated from Iranian oil played a decisive role in maintaining Britain as a preeminent global power. In 1951, Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh pledged to throw the company out of Iran, reclaim the petroleum reserves and free Iran from foreign powers.

In 1952, Mosaddegh nationalized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and became a national hero. The British, however, were outraged and accused him of stealing. The British unsuccessfully sought punishment from the International Court of Justice and the United Nations, sent warships to the Persian Gulf, and finally imposed a crushing embargo. Mosaddegh was unmoved by Britain&#x27;s campaign against him. One European newspaper, the &quot;Frankfurter Neue Presse&quot;, reported that Mosaddegh &quot;would rather be fried in Persian oil than make the slightest concession to the British.&quot; The British considered an armed invasion, but U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill decided on a coup after being refused American military support by U.S. President Harry S. Truman, who sympathized with nationalist movements like Mosaddegh&#x27;s and had nothing but contempt for old-style imperialists like those who ran the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Mosaddegh, however, learned of Churchill&#x27;s plans and ordered the British embassy to be closed in October 1952, forcing all British diplomats and agents to leave the country.

Although the British were initially turned down in their request for American support by President Truman, the election of Dwight D. Eisenhower as U.S. president in November 1952 changed the American stance toward the conflict. This, paired with Cold War paranoia and fears of communist influence, contributed to American strategic interests. On 20 January 1953, U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother, C.I.A. Director Allen Dulles, told their British counterparts that they were ready to move against Mosaddegh. In their eyes, any country not decisively allied with the United States was a potential enemy. Iran had immense oil wealth, a long border with the Soviet Union, and a nationalist prime minister. The prospect of a fall into communism and a &quot;second China&quot; (after Mao Zedong won the Chinese Civil War) terrified the Dulles brothers. Operation Ajax was born, in which the only democratic government Iran ever had was deposed.

===Iranian coup d&#x27;état (1953)===

On 15 August 1953 a coup d&#x27;état was initiated to remove Mosaddegh, with the support of the United States, the United Kingdom and most of the Shia clergy. The Shah fled to Italy when the initial coup attempt on August 15 failed, but returned after a successful second attempt on August 19. Mosaddegh was removed from power and put under house arrest, while lieutenant general Fazlollah Zahedi was appointed as new Prime Minister by the Shah. The sovereign, who was mainly seen as a figurehead at the time, eventually managed to break free from the shackles of the Iranian elites and impose himself as an autocratic reformist ruler.

Pahlavi maintained a close relationship with the U.S. government, as both regimes shared opposition to the expansion of the Soviet Union, Iran&#x27;s powerful northern neighbor. Leftist and Islamist groups attacked his government (often from outside Iran as they were suppressed within) for violating the Iranian constitution, political corruption, and the political oppression, torture, and killings, by the SAVAK secret police.

=== White Revolution (1963–1979) ===
The White Revolution was a far-reaching series of reforms in Iran launched in 1963 by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and lasting until 1979. Mohammad Reza Shah&#x27;s reform program was built especially to weaken those classes that supported the traditional system. It consisted of several elements including land reform; sales of some state-owned factories to finance the land reform; the enfranchisement of women; nationalization of forests and pastures; formation of a literacy corps; and the institution of profit-sharing schemes for workers in industry.

The Shah pushed the White Revolution as a step toward westernization, and it was a way for him to legitimize the Pahlavi dynasty. Part of the reason for launching the White Revolution was that the Shah hoped to eliminate the influence of landlords and to create a new base of support among the peasants and the working class. Thus, the White Revolution in Iran was an attempt to introduce reform from above and preserve traditional power patterns. Through land reform, the essence of the White Revolution, the Shah hoped to ally himself with the peasantry in the countryside, and hoped to sever their ties with the aristocracy in the city.

What the Shah did not expect, however, was that the White Revolution led to new social tensions that helped create many of the problems that he was trying to avoid. The Shah&#x27;s reforms more than quadrupled the combined size of the two classes that posed the greatest challenges to his monarchy in the past — the intelligentsia, and the urban working class. Their resentment of the Shah also grew, as they were now stripped of organizations that had represented them in the past, such as political parties, professional associations, trade unions, and independent newspapers. The land reform, instead of allying the peasants with the government, produced large numbers of independent farmers and landless laborers who became loose political cannons, with no loyalty to the Shah. Many of the masses resented the increasingly corrupt government; their loyalty to the clergy, who were viewed as more concerned with the fate of the populace, remained consistent or increased. As Ervand Abrahamian pointed out: &quot;The White Revolution had been designed to preempt a Red Revolution. Instead, it paved the way for an Islamic Revolution.&quot; In theory, oil money funneled to the elite was supposed to be used to create jobs and factories, eventually distributing the money, but instead the wealth tended to remain concentrated in the hands of the very few at the top.

=== Rise and exile of Ayatollah Khomeini (1963–1979) ===


Post-revolutionary leader — Twelver Shia cleric Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini — first rose to political prominence in 1963 when he led opposition to the Shah and his White Revolution. Khomeini was arrested in 1963 after declaring the Shah a &quot;wretched, miserable man&quot; who &quot;embarked on the [path toward] destruction of Islam in Iran.&quot; Three days of major riots throughout Iran followed, with 15,000 dead from police fire as reported by opposition sources. However, anti-revolutionary sources conjectured that just 32 were killed.

Khomeini was released after eight months of house arrest and continued his agitation, condemning Iran&#x27;s close cooperation with Israel and its capitulations, or extension of diplomatic immunity, to American government personnel in Iran. In November 1964, Khomeini was re-arrested and sent into exile where he remained for 15 years (mostly in Najaf, Iraq), until the revolution.

==== Ideology of the Iranian revolution ====


In this interim period of &quot;disaffected calm,&quot; the budding Iranian revival began to undermine the idea of Westernization as progress that was the basis of the Shah&#x27;s secular reign, and to form the ideology of the 1979 revolution: Jalal Al-e-Ahmad&#x27;s idea of &quot;Gharbzadegi&quot;—that Western culture was a plague or an intoxication to be eliminated; Ali Shariati&#x27;s vision of Islam as the one true liberator of the Third World from oppressive colonialism, neo-colonialism, and capitalism; and Morteza Motahhari&#x27;s popularized retellings of the Shia faith all spread and gained listeners, readers and supporters.

Most importantly, Khomeini preached that revolt, and especially martyrdom, against injustice and tyranny was part of Shia Islam, and that Muslims should reject the influence of both liberal capitalism and communism, ideas that inspired the revolutionary slogan &quot;Neither East, nor West – Islamic Republic!&quot;

Away from public view, Khomeini developed the ideology of &quot;velayat-e faqih&quot; (guardianship of the jurist) as government, that Muslims—in fact everyone—required &quot;guardianship,&quot; in the form of rule or supervision by the leading Islamic jurist or jurists. Such rule was ultimately &quot;more necessary even than prayer and fasting&quot; in Islam, as it would protect Islam from deviation from traditional &quot;sharia&quot; law and in so doing eliminate poverty, injustice, and the &quot;plundering&quot; of Muslim land by foreign non-believers.

This idea of rule by Islamic jurists was spread through his book &quot;Islamic Government&quot;, mosque sermons, and smuggled cassette speeches by Khomeini among his opposition network of students (&quot;talabeh&quot;), ex-students (able clerics such as Morteza Motahhari, Mohammad Beheshti, Mohammad-Javad Bahonar, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, and Mohammad Mofatteh), and traditional businessmen (&quot;bazaari&quot;) inside Iran.

==== Opposition groups and organizations ====

Other opposition groups included constitutionalist liberals—the democratic, reformist Islamic Freedom Movement of Iran, headed by Mehdi Bazargan, and the more secular National Front. They were based in the urban middle class, and wanted the Shah to adhere to the Iranian Constitution of 1906 rather than to replace him with a theocracy, but lacked the cohesion and organization of Khomeini&#x27;s forces.

Communist groups—primarily the Tudeh Party of Iran and the Fedaian guerrillas—had been weakened considerably by government repression. Despite this the guerrillas did help play an important part in the final February 1979 overthrow delivering &quot;the regime its coup de grace.&quot; The most powerful guerrilla group—the People&#x27;s Mujahedin—was leftist Islamist and opposed the influence of the clergy as reactionary.

Some important clergy did not follow Khomeini&#x27;s lead. Popular ayatollah Mahmoud Taleghani supported the left, while perhaps the most senior and influential ayatollah in Iran—Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari—first remained aloof from politics and then came out in support of a democratic revolution.

Khomeini worked to unite this opposition behind him (except for the unwanted &#x27;atheistic Marxists&#x27;), focusing on the socio-economic problems of the Shah&#x27;s government (corruption and unequal income and development), while avoiding specifics among the public that might divide the factions—particularly his plan for clerical rule, which he believed most Iranians had become prejudiced against as a result of propaganda campaign by Western imperialists.

In the post-Shah era, some revolutionaries who clashed with his theocracy and were suppressed by his movement complained of deception, but in the meantime anti-Shah unity was maintained.

=== 1970–1977 ===
Several events in the 1970s set the stage for the 1979 revolution.

The 1971 2,500-year celebration of the Persian Empire at Persepolis, organized by the government, was attacked for its extravagance. &quot;As the foreigners reveled on drink forbidden by Islam, Iranians were not only excluded from the festivities, some were starving.&quot; Five years later, the Shah angered pious Iranian Muslims by changing the first year of the Iranian solar calendar from the Islamic &quot;hijri&quot; to the ascension to the throne by Cyrus the Great. &quot;Iran jumped overnight from the Muslim year 1355 to the royalist year 2535.&quot;

The oil boom of the 1970s produced an &quot;alarming&quot; increase in inflation, waste and an &quot;accelerating gap&quot; between the rich and poor, the city and the country, along with the presence of tens of thousands of unpopular skilled foreign workers. Many Iranians were also angered by the fact that the Shah&#x27;s family was the foremost beneficiary of the income generated by oil, and the line between state earnings and family earnings blurred. By 1976, the Shah had accumulated upward of $1 billion from oil revenue; his family – including 63 princes and princesses had accumulated between $5 and $20 billion; and the family foundation controlled approximately $3 billion. By mid-1977 economic austerity measures to fight inflation disproportionately affected the thousands of poor and unskilled male migrants settling in the cities working in the construction industry. Culturally and religiously conservative, many went on to form the core of the revolution&#x27;s demonstrators and &quot;martyrs&quot;.

All Iranians were required to join and pay dues to a new political party, the Rastakhiz Party —all other parties were banned. That party&#x27;s attempt to fight inflation with populist &quot;anti-profiteering&quot; campaigns—fining and jailing merchants for high prices – angered and politicized merchants while fueling black markets.

In 1977 the Shah responded to the &quot;polite reminder&quot; of the importance of political rights by the new American president, Jimmy Carter, by granting amnesty to some prisoners and allowing the Red Cross to visit prisons. Through 1977 liberal opposition formed organizations and issued open letters denouncing the government. Against this background a first crucial manifestation of public expression of social discontent and political protest against the regime took place in October 1977, when the German-Iranian Cultural Association in Tehran hosted a series of literature reading sessions, organized by the newly revived Iranian Writers Association and the German Goethe-Institute. In these &quot;Ten Nights&quot; (Dah Shab) 57 of Iran&#x27;s most prominent poets and writers read their works to thousands of listeners. They demanded the end of censorship and claimed the freedom of expression.

Also in 1977, the popular and influential modernist Islamist theorist Ali Shariati died under mysterious circumstances. This both angered his followers, who considered him a martyr at the hands of SAVAK, and removed a potential revolutionary rival to Khomeini. Finally, in October Khomeini&#x27;s son Mostafa died of an alleged heart attack, and his death was also blamed on SAVAK. A subsequent memorial service for Mostafa in Tehran put Khomeini back in the spotlight.

By 1977, the Shah&#x27;s policy of political liberalization was underway. Secular opponents of the Shah began to meet in secret to denounce the government. Led by the leftist intellectual Saeed Soltanpour, the Iranian Writers Association met at the Goethe Institute in Tehran to read anti-government poetry. Ali Shariati&#x27;s death in the United Kingdom shortly after led to another public demonstration, with the opposition accusing the Shah of murdering him.

The chain of events began with the death of Mostafa Khomeini, chief aide and eldest son of Ruhollah Khomeini. He mysteriously died at midnight on 23 October 1977 in Najaf, Iraq. SAVAK and the Iraqi government declared heart attack as the cause of death, though many attributed his death to SAVAK. Khomeini remained silent after the incident, while in Iran with the spread of the news came a wave of protest and mourning ceremonies in several cities. The mourning of Mostafa was given a political cast by Khomeini&#x27;s political credentials, their enduring opposition to the monarchy and their exile. This dimension of the ceremonies went beyond the religious credentials of the family.

== Approaching revolution (1978) ==
=== Beginning of protests (January) ===

On 7 January 1978, an article titled &quot;Iran and Red and Black Colonization&quot; appeared in the national daily &quot;Ettela&#x27;at&quot; newspaper. Written under a pseudonym by a government agent, it denounced Khomeini as a &quot;British agent&quot; and a &quot;mad Indian poet&quot; conspiring to sell out Iran to neo-colonialists and communists.

The developments initiated by seminaries in the city of Qom closing on 7 January 1978 were followed by the bazaar and seminary closing, and students rallied towards the homes of the religious leaders on the next day. On 9 January 1978, seminary students and other people demonstrated in the city, which was cracked down by the Shah&#x27;s security forces who shot live ammunition to disperse the crowd when the peaceful demonstration turned violent. Between 5–300 of the demonstrators were reportedly killed in the protest. 9 January 1978 (19 Dey) is regarded as a bloody day in Qom.

=== Consolidation of the opposition (February–March) ===

According to Shia customs, memorial services (&quot;chehelom&quot;) are held 40 days after a person&#x27;s death. Encouraged by Khomeini (who declared that the blood of martyrs must water the &quot;tree of Islam&quot;), radicals pressured the mosques and moderate clergy to commemorate the deaths of the students, and used the occasion to generate protests. The informal network of mosques and bazaars, which for years had been used to carry out religious events, increasingly became consolidated as a coordinated protest organization.

On 18 February, 40 days after the Qom protests, demonstrations broke out in various different cities. The largest was in Tabriz, which descended into a full-scale riot. &quot;Western&quot; and government symbols such as cinemas, bars, state-owned banks, and police stations were set ablaze. Units of the Imperial Iranian Army were deployed to the city to restore order. The death toll, according to the government was 6, while Khomeini claimed hundreds were &quot;martyred.&quot;

Forty days later, on 29 March, demonstrations were organized in at least 55 cities, including Tehran. In an increasingly predictable pattern, deadly riots broke out in major cities, and again 40 days later, on 10 May. It led to an incident in which army commandos opened fire on Shariatmadari&#x27;s house, killing one of his students. Shariatmadari immediately made a public announcement declaring his support for a &quot;constitutional government,&quot; and a return to the policies of the 1906 Constitution.

=== Government reaction ===
The Shah was taken completely by surprise by the protests and, to make matters worse, he often became indecisive during times of crisis; virtually every major decision he would make backfired on his government and further inflamed the revolutionaries.

The Shah decided to continue on his plan of liberalization and to negotiate rather than to use force against the still-nascent protest movement: he promised that fully democratic elections for the Majlis would be held in 1979; censorship was relaxed; a resolution was drafted to help reduce corruption within the royal family and the government; and protesters were tried in civilian courts rather than by military courts-martial and were quickly released.

Iran&#x27;s security forces had not received any riot-control training nor equipment since 1963. As a result, police forces were unable to control demonstrations, thus the army was frequently deployed. Soldiers were instructed not to use deadly force, yet there were instances of inexperienced soldiers reacting excessively, inflaming the violence without cowing the opposition, and receiving official condemnation from the Shah. The Carter administration in the US also refused to sell non-lethal tear gas and rubber bullets to Iran.

As early as the February riots in Tabriz, the Shah fired all SAVAK officials in the city as a concession to the opposition, and soon began to dismiss civil servants and government officials whom he felt the public blamed. In the first national concession, he replaced the hardline SAVAK chief General Nematollah Nassiri with the more moderate General Nasser Moghaddam. The government also negotiated with moderate religious leaders such as Shariatmadari, apologizing to him for the raid on his house.

==== Early summer (June) ====
By summer, the protests had stagnated, remaining at a steady rate for four months, with about 10,000 participants in each major city—with the exception of Isfahan, where protests were larger, and Tehran, where they were smaller—protesting every 40 days. This amounted to a small minority of the more than 15 million adults in Iran.

Against the wishes of Khomeini, Shariatmadari called for 17 June mourning protests to be carried out as a one-day stay. Although tensions remained in the milieu, the Shah&#x27;s policy appeared to have worked, leading Amuzegar to declare that &quot;the crisis is over.&quot; A CIA analysis in August concluded that Iran &quot;is not in a revolutionary or even a pre-revolutionary situation.&quot; These and later events in Iran are frequently cited as one of the most consequential strategic surprises that the United States has experienced since the CIA was established in 1947.

As a sign of easing of government restrictions, three prominent opposition leaders from the secular National Front—Karim Sanjabi, Shapour Bakhtiar, and Dariush Forouhar—were allowed to pen an open letter to the Shah demanding that he reign according to the constitution of Iran.

=== Renewed protests (August–September) ===

==== Appointment of Jafar Sharif-Emami as prime minister (11 August) ====
By August, the protests had &quot;kick[ed]…into high gear,&quot; and the number of demonstrators mushroomed to hundreds of thousands. In an attempt to dampen inflation, the Amuzegar administration cut spending and reduced business. However, the cutbacks led to a sharp rise in layoffs—particularly among young, unskilled, male workers living in the working-class districts. By summer 1978, the working class joined the street protests in massive numbers. In addition, it was the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, bringing a sense of increased religiosity among many people.

A series of escalating protests broke out in major cities, and deadly riots broke out in Isfahan where protesters fought for the release of Ayatollah Jalaluddin Taheri. Martial law was declared in the city on 11 August as symbols of Western culture and government buildings were burned, and a bus full of American workers was bombed. Due to his failure to stop the protests, Prime Minister Amuzegar offered his resignation.

The Shah increasingly felt that he was losing control of the situation and hoped to regain it through complete appeasement. He decided to appoint Jafar Sharif-Emami to the post of prime minister, himself a veteran prime minister. Emami was chosen due to his family ties to the clergy, although he had a reputation of corruption during his previous premiership.

Under the Shah&#x27;s guidance, Sharif-Emami effectively began a policy of &quot;appeasing the opposition&#x27;s demands before they even made them.&quot; The government abolished the Rastakhiz Party, legalized all political parties and released political prisoners, increased freedom of expression, curtailed SAVAK&#x27;s authority and dismissed 34 of its commanders, closed down casinos and nightclubs, and abolished the imperial calendar. The government also began to prosecute corrupt government and royal family members. Sharif-Emami entered into negotiations with Shariatmadari and National Front leader Karim Sanjabi to help organize future elections. Censorship was effectively terminated, and the newspapers began reporting heavily on demonstrations, often highly critically and negatively of the Shah. The Majlis (Parliament) also began issuing resolutions against the government.

==== Cinema Rex fire (19 August) ====
On 19 August, in the southwestern city of Abadan, four arsonists barred the door of the Cinema Rex movie theatre and set it on fire. In what would be the largest terrorist attack in history prior to the September 11 attacks in the US in 2001, 422 people inside the theatre were burned to death. Khomeini immediately blamed the Shah and SAVAK for setting the fire, and, due to the pervasive revolutionary atmosphere, the public also blamed the Shah for starting the fire, despite the government&#x27;s insistence that they were uninvolved. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets shouting &quot;Burn the Shah!&quot; and &quot;The Shah is the guilty one!&quot;

After the revolution, many claimed that Islamist militants had started the fire. After the Islamic republic government executed a police officer for the act, a man claiming to be the lone surviving arsonist claimed he was responsible for starting the fire. After forcing the resignation of the presiding judges in an attempt to hamper the investigation, the new government finally executed Hossein Talakhzadeh for &quot;setting the fire on the Shah&#x27;s orders,&quot; despite his insistence that he did it on his own accord as an ultimate sacrifice for the revolutionary cause.

==== Declaration of martial law and the Jaleh Square Massacre (8 September) ====


The 4th of September marked Eid al-Fitr, the holiday celebrating the end of the month of Ramadan. A permit for an open-air prayer was granted, in which 200,000–500,000 people attended. Instead, the clergy directed the crowd on a large march through the center of Tehran, while the Shah reportedly watched the march from his helicopter, unnerved, and confused. A few days later, even larger protests took place, and, for the first time, protesters called for Khomeini&#x27;s return and the establishment of an Islamic republic.

At midnight on 8 September, the Shah declared martial law in Tehran and 11 other major cities throughout the country. All street demonstrations were banned, and a night-time curfew was established. Tehran&#x27;s martial law commander was General Gholam-Ali Oveissi, who was known for his severity against opponents. However, the Shah made clear that once martial law was lifted, he intended to continue with the liberalization. He retained Sharif-Emami&#x27;s civilian government, hoping that protesters would avoid taking the streets.

However, 5,000 protesters took to the streets, either in defiance or because they had missed hearing the declaration, and faced off with soldiers at Jaleh Square. After the firing of warning shots failed to disperse the crowd, troops fired directly into the crowd, killing 64, while General Oveissi claimed that 30 soldiers were killed by armed snipers in surrounding buildings. Additional clashes throughout the day, which would be called Black Friday by the opposition, brought the opposition death toll to 89.

===== Reactions to Black Friday =====
The deaths shocked the country and damaged any attempt at reconciliation between the Shah and the opposition. Khomeini immediately declared that &quot;4,000 innocent protesters were massacred by Zionists,&quot; which gave him a pretext to reject any further compromise with the government.

The Shah himself was horrified by the events of Black Friday, and harshly criticized the events, though this did little to sway public perception of him as being responsible for the shooting. While martial law officially remained in effect, the government decided not to break up any more demonstrations or strikes (in effect, &quot;martial law without there exactly being martial law,&quot; according to Sharif-Emami), instead continuing to negotiate with protest leaders. Consequently, protest gatherings often took place without any serious intervention by soldiers.

=== Nationwide strikes (September–November) ===
Oil strikes started in fall of 1978 and led to a 4.8 million drop of crude oil production every day, which was about seven percent of the world&#x27;s supply. Prices rose from 13 dollars per barrel in 1979 to 34 dollars in 1980. While increased production from other countries, like Saudi Arabia, offset the decline in supply slightly there was still a 10 percent drop in available oil.

There were a variety of factors influencing the workers&#x27; decision to strike. The Shah&#x27;s regime had relaxed oppression in 1977, giving people more access to protest and organizing. At the same time, the economy had faltered after doing better in the early 70s. The strikes began when the workers at a refinery in Tehran called for higher wages and housing allowances. The government ignored the request, causing the workers to strike. The Shah&#x27;s government responded by killing dozens of strikers in an event known as Black Friday. One day after this massacre, strikes began in Tehran, Abadan, Isfahan, Shiraz, and Kermanshah. This began the first wave of strikes, which SAVAK reports to include 11,000 workers. The oil strikes of 1978 were imperative to the Iranian Revolution&#x27;s success, as they put extreme economic pressure on the Shah&#x27;s regime. Oil revenues are a significant part of the government&#x27;s income and regardless of the motivation behind those who strike, oil strikes will always threaten to destabilize Iranian regimes.

By late October, a nationwide general strike was declared, with workers in virtually all major industries walking off their jobs, most damagingly in the oil industry and the print media. Special &quot;strike committees&quot; were set up throughout major industries to organize and coordinate the activities.

The Shah did not attempt to crack down on strikers, but instead gave them generous wage increases, and allowed strikers who lived in government housing to remain in their homes. By the beginning of November, many important officials in the Shah&#x27;s government were demanding from the Shah forceful measures to bring the strikers back to work.

=== Khomeini moves to France (November) ===
Hoping to break Khomeini&#x27;s contacts with the opposition, the Shah pressured the Iraqi government to expel him from Najaf. Khomeini left Iraq, instead moving to a house bought by Iranian exiles in Neauphle-le-Château, a village near Paris, France. The Shah hoped that Khomeini would be cut off from the mosques of Najaf and be cut off from the protest movement. Instead, the plan backfired badly. With superior French telephone and postal connections (compared to Iraqi ones), Khomeini&#x27;s supporters flooded Iran with tapes and recordings of his sermons.

Worse for the Shah was that the Western media, especially the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), immediately put Khomeini into the spotlight. Khomeini rapidly became a household name in the West, portraying himself as an &quot;Eastern mystic&quot; who did not seek power, but instead sought to &quot;free&quot; his people from &quot;oppression.&quot; Many western media outlets, usually critical of such claims, became one of Khomeini&#x27;s most powerful tools.

In addition, the media coverage eroded the influence of other, more moderate clergy such as Ayatollah Shariatmadari and Ayatollah Taleghani. The BBC itself later issued a statement admitting to having a &quot;critical&quot; disposition to the Shah, saying that its broadcasts helped to &quot;change the collective perception of the population.&quot;

In November, secular National Front leader Karim Sanjabi flew to Paris to meet Khomeini. There the two signed an agreement for a draft constitution that would be &quot;Islamic and democratic&quot;. It signaled the now official alliance between the clergy and the secular opposition. To help create a democratic façade, Khomeini placed Westernized figures (such as Sadegh Ghotbzadeh and Ebrahim Yazdi) as the public spokesmen of the opposition, and never spoke to the media of his intentions to create a theocracy.

=== University of Tehran protest (5 November) ===
Street demonstrations continued at full force with little response from the military; by late October, government officials effectively even ceded the University of Tehran to student protesters. Worse, the opposition was increasingly becoming armed with weapons, firing at soldiers and attacking banks and government buildings in an attempt to destabilize the country.

On 5 November, demonstrations at University of Tehran became deadly after a fight broke out with armed soldiers. Within hours, Tehran broke out into a full-scale riot. Block after block of Western symbols such as movie theaters and department stores, as well as government and police buildings, were seized, looted, and burned. The British embassy in Tehran was partially burned and vandalized as well, and the American embassy nearly suffered the same fate. The event became known to foreign observers as &quot;The Day Tehran Burned.&quot;

Many of the rioters were young teenage boys, often organized by the mosques in southern Tehran, and encouraged by their mullahs to attack and destroy western and secular symbols. The army and police, confused about their orders and under pressure from the Shah not to risk initiating violence, effectively gave up and did not intervene.

=== Appointment of a military government (6 November) ===
As the situation on the streets spiraled out of control, many well known and reputable figures within the country began to approach the Shah, begging him to stop the chaos.

On 6 November, the Shah dismissed Sharif-Emami from the post of prime minister, and chose to appoint a military government in its place. The Shah chose General Gholam-Reza Azhari to be prime minister because of his mild-mannered approach to the situation. The cabinet he would choose was a military cabinet in name only and consisted primarily of civilian leaders.

The same day, the Shah made a speech on Iranian television. He referred to himself as &quot;Padeshah&quot; (&#x27;Master King&#x27;), instead of the more grandiose Shahanshah (king of kings), which he insisted on being called previously. In his speech he stated &quot;I have heard the voice of your revolution...this revolution cannot but be supported by me, the king of Iran&quot;. He apologized for mistakes that were committed during his reign, and promised to ensure that corruption would no longer exist. He stated he would begin to work with the opposition to bring democracy, and would form a coalition government. In effect, the Shah intended to restrain the military government (which he described as a temporary caretaker government) from carrying out a full crackdown.

The speech backfired when the revolutionaries sensed weakness from the Shah and &quot;smelled blood&quot;. Khomeini announced that there would be no reconciliation with the Shah and called on all Iranians to overthrow him.

Military authorities declared martial law in Khuzestan province (Iran&#x27;s main oil producing province) and deployed troops to its oil facilities. Navy personnel were also used as strikebreakers in the oil industry. Street marches declined, and oil production began increasing once again, nearly reaching pre-revolutionary levels. In a symbolic blow to the opposition, Karim Sanjabi, who had visited Khomeini in Paris, was arrested upon his return to Iran.

However, the government still continued the policy of appeasement and negotiation. The Shah ordered the arrest of 100 officials from his own government for charges of corruption, including former prime minister Amir Abbas-Hoveyda and former SAVAK head Nematollah Nassiri.

=== Muharram protests (early December) ===

Khomeini condemned the military government and called for continued protests. He and the protest organizers planned a series of escalating protests during the holy Islamic month of Muharram, to culminate with massive protests on the days of Tasu&#x27;a and Ashura, the latter commemorating the martyrdom of Imam Husayn ibn Ali, the third Shia Muslim imam.

While the military authorities banned street demonstrations and extended the curfew, the Shah faced deep misgivings about the potential violence.

On 2 December 1978, the Muharram protests began. Named for the Islamic month they began in, the Muharram protests were impressively huge and pivotal. Over two million protesters (many of whom were teenagers proselytized by the mullahs from the mosques of southern Tehran) took to the streets, crowding Shahyad Square. Protesters frequently went out at night, defying the set curfew, often taking to rooftops and shouting &quot;&quot;Allahu-akbar&quot;&quot; (&#x27;God is great&#x27;). According to one witness, many of the clashes on the street had an air of playfulness rather than seriousness, with security forces using &quot;kid gloves&quot; against the opposition. Nevertheless, the government reported at least 12 opposition deaths.

The protesters demanded that Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi step down from power and that Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini be returned from exile. The protests grew incredibly fast, reaching between six million and nine million in strength in the first week. About 5% of the population had taken to the streets in the Muharram protests. Both beginning and ending in the month of Muharram, the protests succeeded, and the Shah stepped down from power later that month.

After the success of what would become known as a revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Iran as its religious and political leader for life. Khomeini had been an opposition leader to Shah for many years, rising to prominence after the death of his mentor, renowned scholar Yazdi Ha&#x27;iri, in the 1930s. Even in his years in exile, Khomeini remained relevant in Iran. Supporting the protests from beyond Iran&#x27;s borders, he proclaimed that &quot;freedom and liberation from the bonds of imperialism&quot; was imminent.

==== Tasu&#x27;a and Ashura marches (10–11 December) ====
As the days of Tasu&#x27;a and Ashura (10 and 11 December) approached, to prevent a deadly showdown, the Shah began to draw back. In negotiations with Ayatollah Shariatmadari, the Shah ordered the release of 120 political prisoners and Karim Sanjabi, and on 8 December revoked the ban on street demonstrations. Permits were issued for the marchers, and troops were removed from the procession&#x27;s path. In turn, Shariatmadari pledged that to make sure that there would be no violence during the demonstrations.

On 10 and 11 December 1978, the days of Tasu&#x27;a and Ashura, between 6 and 9 million anti-Shah demonstrators marched throughout Iran. According to one historian, &quot;even discounting for exaggeration, these figures may represent the largest protest event in history.&quot; The marches were led by Ayatollah Taleghani and National Front leader Karim Sanjabi, thus symbolizing the &quot;unity&quot; of the secular and religious opposition. The mullahs and bazaaris effectively policed the gathering, and protesters who attempted to initiate violence were restrained.

More than 10% of the country marched in anti-Shah demonstrations on the two days, possibly a higher percentage than any previous revolution. It is rare for a revolution to involve as much as 1 percent of a country&#x27;s population; the French, Russian, and Romanian revolutions may have passed the 1 percent mark.

== Revolution (late 1978–1979) ==
Much of Iranian society was in euphoria about the coming revolution. Secular and leftist politicians piled onto the movement hoping to gain power in the aftermath, ignoring the fact that Khomeini was the very antithesis to all of the positions they supported. While it was increasingly clear to more secular Iranians that Khomeini was not a liberal, he was widely perceived as a figurehead, and that power would eventually be handed to the secular groups.

=== Demoralization of the army (December, 1978) ===
The military leadership was increasingly paralyzed by indecision, and rank-and-file soldiers were demoralized, having been forced to confront demonstrators while prohibited from using their own weapons (and being condemned by the Shah if they did). Increasingly, Khomeini called on the soldiers of the armed forces to defect to the opposition. Revolutionaries gave flowers and civilian clothes to deserters, while threatening retribution to those who stayed.

On 11 December, a dozen officers were shot dead by their own troops at Tehran&#x27;s Lavizan barracks. Fearing further mutinies, many soldiers were returned to their barracks. Mashhad (the second largest city in Iran) was abandoned to the protesters, and in many provincial towns demonstrators were effectively in control.

=== American and internal negotiations with the opposition (late December, 1978) ===

The Carter administration increasingly became locked in a debate about continued support for the monarchy. As early as November, ambassador William Sullivan sent a telegram to Carter (the &quot;Thinking the Unthinkable&quot; telegram). The telegram effectively declared his belief that the Shah would not survive the protests and that the US should consider withdrawing its support for his government and persuading the monarch to abdicate. The United States would then help assemble a coalition of pro-Western military officers, middle class professionals, and moderate clergy, with Khomeini installed as a Gandhi-like spiritual leader.

The telegram touched off a vigorous debate in the American cabinet, with some, such as National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, rejecting it outright. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance rejected a military crackdown; he and his supporters believed in the &quot;moderate and progressive&quot; intentions of Khomeini and his circle.

Increasing contact was established with the pro-Khomeini camp. Based on the revolutionaries&#x27; responses, some American officials (especially Ambassador Sullivan) felt that Khomeini was genuinely intent on creating a democracy. According to historian Abbas Milani, this resulted in the United States effectively helping to facilitate Khomeini&#x27;s rise to power.

The Shah began to search for a new prime minister, one who was a civilian and a member of the opposition. On 28 December, he secured an agreement with another major National Front figure, Shapour Bakhtiar. Bakhtiar would be appointed prime minister (a return to civilian rule), while the Shah and his family would leave the country. His royal duties would be carried out by a Regency Council, and three months after his departure a referendum would be submitted to the people deciding on whether Iran would remain a monarchy or become a republic. A former opponent of the Shah, Bakhtiar became motivated to join the government because he was increasingly aware of Khomeini&#x27;s intentions to implement hard-line religious rule rather than a democracy. Karim Sanjabi immediately expelled Bakhtiar from the National Front, and Bakhtiar was denounced by Khomeini (who declared that acceptance of his government was the equivalent of &quot;obedience to false gods&quot;).

=== The Shah leaves (16 January 1979) ===

The Shah, hoping to see Bakhtiar established, kept delaying his departure. Consequently, to the Iranian public, Bakhtiar was seen as the Shah&#x27;s last prime minister, undermining his support.

American General Robert Huyser, the Deputy Commander of NATO, entered Iran. While the option of a pro-Shah military coup still was a possibility, Huyser met with military leaders (but not the Shah) and established meetings between them and Khomeini allies for the purpose of agreeing on Bakhtiar&#x27;s transitional government. Ambassador Sullivan disagreed, and attempted to pressure Huyser to ignore the military and work directly with Khomeini&#x27;s opposition. Nevertheless, Huyser won out and continued to work with both the military and opposition. He left Iran on 3 February. The Shah was privately embittered by Huyser&#x27;s mission and felt that the United States no longer wanted him in power.

On the morning of 16 January 1979, Bakhtiar was officially appointed prime minister. The same day, a tearful Shah and his family left Iran for exile in Egypt, never to return.

=== Bakhtiar&#x27;s premiership and Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s return (January–February, 1979) ===
When the news of the Shah&#x27;s departure was announced from newspapers and news at 2 pm on Iran&#x27;s National Radio, there were spontaneous scenes of joy throughout the country. Millions poured onto the streets, and virtually every remaining sign of the monarchy was torn down by the crowds. Bakhtiar dissolved SAVAK and freed all remaining political prisoners. He ordered the army to allow mass demonstrations, promised free elections and invited the revolutionaries into a government of &quot;national unity&quot;.
Bakhtiar invited Khomeini back to Iran, with the intention of creating a Vatican-like state in the holy city of Qom, declaring that &quot;We will soon have the honor of welcoming home the Ayatollah Khomeini&quot;. On 1 February 1979 Khomeini returned to Tehran in a chartered Air France Boeing 747. The welcoming crowd of several million Iranians was so large he was forced to take a helicopter after the car taking him from the airport was overwhelmed by an enthusiastic welcoming crowd.

Khomeini was now not only the undisputed leader of the revolution, he had become what some called a &quot;semi-divine&quot; figure, greeted as he descended from his airplane with cries of &#x27;Khomeini, O Imam, we salute you, peace be upon you.&#x27; Crowds were now known to chant &quot;Islam, Islam, Khomeini, We Will Follow You&quot;, and even &quot;Khomeini for King&quot;. When asked by a reporter how he felt returning to his home country after a long exile, Khomeini replied &quot;Nothing&quot;.

On the day of his arrival Khomeini made clear his rejection of Bakhtiar&#x27;s government in a speech promising, &quot;I shall kick their teeth in. I appoint the government, I appoint the government in support of this nation&quot;. On 5 February at his headquarters in the Refah School in southern Tehran, he declared a provisional revolutionary government, appointed opposition leader Mehdi Bazargan (from the religious-nationalist Freedom Movement, affiliated with the National Front) as his own prime minister, and commanded Iranians to obey Bazargan as a religious duty:

Angered, Bakhtiar made a speech of his own. Reaffirming himself as the legitimate leader, he declared that:

=== Armed battles and collapse of the monarchy (February, 1979) ===
Tensions between the two rival governments increased rapidly. To demonstrate his support, Khomeini called for demonstrators to occupy the streets throughout the country. He also sent a letter to American officials warning them to withdraw support for Bakhtiar. Bakhtiar became increasingly isolated, with members of the government (including the entire Regency Council) defecting to Khomeini. The military was crumbling, with its leadership completely paralyzed, unsure of whether to support Bakhtiar or act on their own, and rank-and-file soldiers either demoralized or deserting.

On 9 February, a rebellion of pro-Khomeini air force technicians broke out at the Doshan Tappeh Air Base. A unit of the pro-Shah Immortal Guards attempted to apprehend the rebels, and an armed battle broke out. Soon large crowds took to the streets, building barricades and supporting the rebels, while Islamic-Marxist guerillas with their weapons joined in support.

The armed rebels attacked a weapons factory, capturing nearly 50,000 machine guns and distributing them to civilians who joined in the fighting. The rebels began storming police stations and military bases throughout Tehran. The city&#x27;s martial law commander General Mehdi Rahimi decided not to use his 30,000 loyal Immortal Guards to crush the rebellion for fear of producing civilian casualties.

The final collapse of the provisional non-Islamist government came at 2 pm on 11 February when the Supreme Military Council declared itself &quot;neutral in the current political disputes... in order to prevent further disorder and bloodshed.&quot; All military personnel were ordered back to their bases, effectively yielding control of the entire country to Khomeini. Revolutionaries took over government buildings, TV and radio stations, and palaces of the Pahlavi dynasty, marking the end of the monarchy in Iran. Bakhtiar escaped the palace under a hail of bullets, fleeing Iran in disguise. He was later assassinated by an agent of the Islamic republic in 1991 in Paris.

This period, from 1 to 11 February, is celebrated every year in Iran as the &quot;Decade of Fajr&quot;. 11 February is &quot;Islamic Revolution&#x27;s Victory Day&quot;, a national holiday with state sponsored demonstrations in every city.

=== Casualties ===

Some sources (such as Emadeddin Baghi, a researcher at the Martyrs Foundation) claim 2,781 protesters and revolutionaries were killed in 1978–79 during the revolution. Khomeini reported of a much larger number; he said that &quot;60,000 men, women and children were martyred by the Shah&#x27;s regime&quot;. In reference to this 60,000 figure, the military historian Spencer C. Tucker notes that &quot;Khomeini&#x27;s regime grossly overstated the revolution&#x27;s death toll for propaganda purposes&quot;. Tucker explains that the consensus of historians regarding estimated deaths during the Iranian Revolution (from January 1978 to February 1979), numbers between 532 and 2,781. According to the historian Ervand Abrahamian, the number executed by revolutionary courts as the revolution was consolidated (8,000 opponents between June 1981 and June 1985) exceeded those killed by the royalist government trying to stop the revolution. According to Tucker&#x27;s estimations, in the period of 1980 to 1985, between 25,000 and 40,000 Iranians were arrested, 15,000 Iranians were tried, and between 8,000 and 9,500 Iranians were executed.

=== Songs of Iranian Revolution ===
The songs most closely associated with the revolution are epic ballads, composed during and in support of the Islamic Revolution and in opposition to the Pahlavi dynasty. Before the revolution was consolidated, these chants were made by various political supporters, and were often recorded on cassette tapes in underground and home studios. In schools, these songs were sung by students as part of the celebrations of Fajr Decades. &quot;Iran Iran&quot; or &quot;Allah Allah&quot; chants are famous revolutionary songs.

== Women&#x27;s role ==

The Iranian Revolution was a gendered revolution; much of the new regime&#x27;s rhetoric was centered on the position of women in society. Beyond rhetoric, thousands of women were also heavily mobilized in the revolution itself, and different groups of women actively participated alongside their male counterparts. Not only participating through voting, women also contributed to the revolution through marches, demonstrations and chanting slogans. Women were involved in caring for the wounded, including doctors who responded to calls for help and opened their homes for those who needed assistance. While women themselves were often killed, tortured, arrested or injured and some were involved in guerilla activities, most contributed in non-violent ways. Many women were instrumental not only in being involved in the revolution themselves but in mobilizing men and other non-political women. Many women protested while carrying children and their presence was one of the main reasons for disarming soldiers (who were there on behalf of the regime) who were ordered to shoot if necessary.

=== Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s rhetoric on women&#x27;s participation ===
Ayatollah Khomeini asserted that &quot;You ladies here have proved that you are at the forefront of this movement. You have a great share in our Islamic movement. The future of our country depends on your support.&quot; He invoked the image of the hijab as a symbol of the revolution, saying that &quot;a nation whose respected women demonstrate in modest garb [&quot;hejab&quot;] to express their disgust with the Shah&#x27;s regime—such a nation will be victorious.&quot; He also said that &quot;women from all levels of society took part in the recent demonstrations, which we are calling the &#x27;referendum of the streets&#x27;... women fought side by side with men in the struggle for their independence and their liberty.&quot; Khomeini pleaded for women to participate in anti-Shah demonstrations in various cities. Furthermore, women later responded to Khomeini&#x27;s urgings to vote in favor of the Islamic Republic and the new constitution. Women were so pivotal to the revolution that in response to a suggestion from a top aide to ban women from coming to group audience, Khomeini said &quot;I threw the Shah out with these women, there&#x27;s no problem in their coming.&quot;

After the revolution, Khomeini credited much of the success of the movement to women, even commending the women for mobilizing men, &quot;you ladies have proved that you are in the vanguard of the movement, you have proved that you lead the men, men get their inspiration from you, the men of Iran have learnt lessons from the honourable ladies of Iran ... You are in the vanguard of the movement.&quot;

It has been argued that Khomeini and his fellow leaders danced around the issue of women&#x27;s rights and rather focused their rhetoric on mobilizing women through encouraging them to participate in protests and fueling their anti-Shah sentiments.

=== Variation within women&#x27;s participation ===
The contributions of women to the revolutions and the intentions behind these contributions are complex and layered. The motivations of women for being part of the revolutions were complex and varied among a plethora of religious, political and economic reasons and women participating were from various classes and backgrounds. Many Western educated upper-middle-class women from secular, urban and professional families were involved as well as many women from working-class and rural backgrounds. There were groups as varied as the Fida&#x27;iyan-i Khalq, and the Mujahedin were functioning as guerrilla units during the revolutions in opposition to the Shah&#x27;s regime. There were also other groups of women with various agendas that sometimes converged and sometimes diverged from the Islamic Republic&#x27;s political positions. For example, organized feminism, which was around since the Pahlavi dynasty, joined the revolutionary movement after the Shah dropped the cabinet position on Women&#x27;s Affairs to appease the Islamists. Members of the Women&#x27;s Organization of Iran marched in support for the revolution and it was important that women very much linked to the government also turned against the Shah&#x27;s regime. Yet, there was some tension later between feminists&#x27; dress and the revolution&#x27;s stance on women&#x27;s clothing and they began to feel uncomfortable at opposition events.

Some argue that this politicization and mobilization of women made it difficult for the new regime to push them out of the public and political spheres. The revolution resulted in an unprecedented opening for Iranian women into politics (mostly through demonstrations and voting), and some authors argue that this had a lasting impact on Iranian women&#x27;s political participation and role in the public sphere. Some women were also part of the inner circle of the leaders of the new regime such as Marzieh Hadidchi. Other than the politicization of women, there were particular circumstances during the revolution which pushed women into being involved with politics. For example, &quot;the combination of martial law with its curfew hours and the closing down of shops and workplaces, together with the cold of the fall and winter months resulted in the centers of political discussion often being within the home.&quot; Women engaged with news and media as well as political discussions alongside their male counterparts as &quot;the revolution was the only topic of interest to anyone, regardless of age or sex.&quot; During 1978 and 1979 there were many gatherings in women&#x27;s homes where they exchanged interpersonal news and anecdotes. These personal accounts were valuable in a time where the official coverage of news was not trusted by many people.

Women who were activists, religious women and women dissatisfied with the regime were able to unite under the anti-Shah umbrella. However, &quot;women were not united in their opinions of the revolution and its outcome as much as they were not united in their reasons for joining the revolution&quot;. Despite this mobilization and high participation rate of women, they were still kept out of leadership positions which were exclusive to men; women are thought to be part of the rank and file rather than the elite strata of the revolution.

=== Academic literature on women&#x27;s participation ===
While there has been some academic literature exploring individual narratives of women on the revolution, most of the academic work produced focuses on the effect of the revolution on women rather than the role of Iranian women during the revolution. Scholar Guity Nashat highlights this neglected aspect of the revolution, &quot;Although women&#x27;s participation in the events leading to the 11 February revolution was instrumental in its success, most studies have not addressed the reasons for their involvement or their contribution.&quot; Janet Baur argues the necessity of examining the daily lives of women, their living conditions and their relationship to other groups to understand their participation in the socio-political events of the revolution. She further explains that the cultural, ideological, social and material factors shaping the social life and class differences in the period just prior to the revolution need to be studied to understand how the Iranian women&#x27;s social consciousness developed and how it led them to take part in public protests. Caroline M. Brooks argues that women were left to express their concerns through the protest rather than in the Majlis. Thus, this created a &quot;dangerous bargaining position for activist women&quot; since rather than arguing their position through intellect they were only able to &quot;argue by numbers in the streets and be repelled by force&quot;.

There are some contesting understandings in academic literature regarding the reasons behind the mobilization of women. While some argue that the micro-level actions of women can be understood through religious and political ideologies, others argue that it is in fact the effect of manipulations of information, symbols and context which should be studied.

== Aftermath ==
From early 1979 to either 1982 or 1983 Iran was in a &quot;revolutionary crisis mode.&quot; After the system of despotic monarchy had been overthrown, the economy and the apparatus of government had collapsed, and military and security forces were in disarray. Yet, by 1982 Khomeini and his supporters had crushed the rival factions, defeated local rebellions and consolidated power.

At the same time, events that made up both the crisis and its resolution were the Iran hostage crisis, the invasion of Iran by Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq, and the presidency of Abolhassan Banisadr.

=== Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s consolidation of power ===

==== Conflicts among revolutionaries ====
Some observers believe &quot;what began as an authentic and anti-dictatorial popular revolution based on a broad coalition of all anti-Shah forces was soon transformed into an Islamic fundamentalist power-grab,&quot; and that except for his core supporters, the members of the coalition thought Khomeini intended to be more of a spiritual guide than a ruler. Khomeini was in his mid-70s, never held public office, had been out of Iran for more than a decade, and told questioners &quot;the religious dignitaries do not want to rule.&quot; However, nobody could deny the unanimous central role of the Imam, and the other factions were too small to have any real impact.

Another view is Khomeini had &quot;overwhelming ideological, political and organizational hegemony,&quot; and non-theocratic groups never seriously challenged Khomeini&#x27;s movement in popular support. Supporters of the new rule themselves have claimed that Iranians who opposed Khomeini were &quot;fifth columnists&quot; led by foreign countries attempting to overthrow the Iranian government.

Khomeini and his loyalists in the revolutionary organizations implemented Khomeini&#x27;s velayat-e faqih design for an Islamic republic led by himself as Supreme Leader by exploiting temporary allies such as Mehdi Bazargan&#x27;s Provisional Government of Iran, whom they later eliminated from Iran&#x27;s political stage one by one.

==== Organizations of the revolution ====

The most important bodies of the revolution were the Revolutionary Council, the Revolutionary Guards, Revolutionary Tribunals, Islamic Republican Party, and Revolutionary Committees (&quot;komitehs&quot;).

While the moderate Bazargan and his government (temporarily) reassured the middle class, it became apparent they did not have power over the &quot;Khomeinist&quot; revolutionary bodies, particularly the Revolutionary Council (the &quot;real power&quot; in the revolutionary state), and later the Islamic Republican Party. Inevitably, the overlapping authority of the Revolutionary Council (which had the power to pass laws) and Bazargan&#x27;s government was a source of conflict, despite the fact that both had been approved by and/or put in place by Khomeini.

This conflict lasted only a few months however. The provisional government fell shortly after American Embassy officials were taken hostage on 4 November 1979. Bazargan&#x27;s resignation was received by Khomeini without complaint, saying &quot;Mr. Bazargan ... was a little tired and preferred to stay on the sidelines for a while.&quot; Khomeini later described his appointment of Bazargan as a &quot;mistake.&quot;

The Revolutionary Guard, or &quot;Pasdaran-e Enqelab&quot;, was established by Khomeini on 5 May 1979, as a counterweight both to the armed groups of the left, and to the Shah&#x27;s military. The guard eventually grew into &quot;a full-scale&quot; military force, becoming &quot;the strongest institution of the revolution.&quot;

Serving under the Pasdaran were/are the &quot;Baseej-e Mostaz&#x27;afin&quot;, volunteers in everything from earthquake emergency management to attacking opposition demonstrators and newspaper offices. The Islamic Republican Party then fought to establish a theocratic government by &quot;velayat-e faqih&quot;.

Thousands of &quot;komiteh&quot; or Revolutionary Committees served as &quot;the eyes and ears&quot; of the new rule and are credited by critics with &quot;many arbitrary arrests, executions and confiscations of property&quot;.

Also enforcing the will of the government were the Hezbollahi (the Party of God), &quot;strong-arm thugs&quot; who attacked demonstrators and offices of newspapers critical of Khomeini.

Two major political groups that formed after the fall of the Shah that clashed with and were eventually suppressed by pro-Khomeini groups, were the moderate religious Muslim People&#x27;s Republican Party (MPRP) which was associated with Grand Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari, and the secular leftist National Democratic Front (NDF).

==== 1979 ethnic uprisings ====

Following the events of the revolution, Marxist guerrillas and federalist parties revolted in some regions comprising Khuzistan, Kurdistan and Gonbad-e Qabus, which resulted in fighting between them and revolutionary forces. These revolts began in April 1979 and lasted between several months to over a year, depending on the region.

=== Establishment of Islamic republic government ===
==== Referendum of 12 Farvardin ====
On 30 and 31 March (Farvardin 10, 11) a referendum was held over whether to replace the monarchy with an &quot;Islamic republic&quot;. Khomeini called for a massive turnout and only the National Democratic Front, Fadayan, and several Kurdish parties opposed the vote. The results showed that 98.2% had voted in favor of the Islamic Republic.

==== Writing of the constitution ====

In June 1979 the Freedom Movement released its draft constitution for the Islamic Republic that it had been working on since Khomeini was in exile. It included a Guardian Council to veto un-Islamic legislation, but had no guardian jurist ruler. Leftists found the draft too conservative and in need of major changes but Khomeini declared it &#x27;correct&#x27;. To approve the new constitution and prevent leftist alterations, a relatively small seventy-three-member Assembly of Experts for Constitution was elected that summer. Critics complained that &quot;vote-rigging, violence against undesirable candidates and the dissemination of false information&quot; was used to &quot;produce an assembly overwhelmingly dominated by clergy, all took active roles during the revolution and loyal to Khomeini.&quot;

Khomeini (and the assembly) now rejected the constitution – its correctness notwithstanding – and Khomeini declared that the new government should be based &quot;100% on Islam.&quot;

In addition to the president, the new constitution included a more powerful post of guardian jurist ruler intended for Khomeini, with control of the military and security services, and power to appoint several top government and judicial officials. It increased the power and number of clerics on the Council of Guardians and gave it control over elections as well as laws passed by the legislature.

The new constitution was also approved overwhelmingly by the December 1979 constitutional referendum, but with more opposition and smaller turnout.

=== Hostage crisis ===
In late October 1979, the exiled and dying Shah was admitted into the United States for cancer treatment. In Iran there was an immediate outcry, and both Khomeini and leftist groups demanded the Shah&#x27;s return to Iran for trial and execution. On 4 November 1979 youthful Islamists, calling themselves Muslim Student Followers of the Imam&#x27;s Line, invaded the US embassy compound in Tehran and seized its staff. Revolutionaries were angry because of how the Shah had left Iran which spawned rumors of another U.S.–backed coup in Iran that would re-install him. The occupation was also intended as leverage to demand the return of the Shah to stand trial in exchange for the hostages, and depose Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan, who they believed was plotting to normalize relations with the U.S. The students held 52 American diplomats hostage for 444 days, which played a role in helping to pass the constitution, suppressing moderates, and otherwise radicalising the revolution.

Holding the hostages was very popular and continued even after the death of the Shah. As Khomeini explained to his future President Banisadr, &quot;This action has many benefits. ... This has united our people. Our opponents do not dare act against us. We can put the constitution to the people&#x27;s vote without difficulty ...&quot;

With great publicity the students released documents from the American embassy, which they labeled a &quot;den of spies&quot;, showing that moderate Iranian leaders had met with U.S. officials (and did not release similar evidence of high-ranking Islamists having done the same). Among the casualties of the hostage crisis was Prime Minister Bazargan and his government, who resigned in November unable to enforce the government&#x27;s order to release the hostages.

The prestige of Khomeini and the hostage taking was further enhanced with the failure of a hostage rescue attempt, widely credited to divine intervention.

The hostage crisis ended with the signing of the Algiers Accords in Algeria on 19 January 1981. The hostages were formally released to United States custody the following day, just minutes after Ronald Reagan was sworn in as the new American president.

=== Suppression of opposition ===

Khomeini and his followers claimed sole credit for the revolution, sidelining other revolutionary groups. This was possible due to the regime’s control over public opinion and historical narrative. In early March 1979, Khomeini announced, &quot;do not use this term, &#x27;democratic.&#x27; That is the Western style,&quot; giving pro-democracy liberals (and later leftists) a taste of disappointments to come. In succession the National Democratic Front was banned in August 1979, the provisional government was disempowered in November, the Muslim People&#x27;s Republican Party was banned in January 1980, the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran guerrillas came under attack in February 1980, a purge of universities started in March 1980, and the liberal Islamist President Abolhassan Banisadr was impeached in June 1981.

After the revolution, human rights groups estimated the number of casualties suffered by protesters and prisoners of the new system to be several thousand. The first to be executed were members of the old system – senior generals, followed by over 200 senior civilian officials – as punishment and to eliminate the danger of a coup d&#x27;état. Brief trials lacking defense attorneys, juries, transparency or the opportunity for the accused to defend themselves were held by revolutionary judges such as Sadegh Khalkhali, the &quot;Sharia&quot; judge. By January 1980 &quot;at least 582 persons had been executed.&quot; Among those executed was Amir Abbas Hoveida, former Prime Minister of Iran. Between January 1980 and June 1981, when Bani-Sadr was impeached, at least 900 executions took place, for everything from drug and sexual offenses to &quot;corruption on earth&quot;, from plotting counter-revolution and spying for Israel to membership in opposition groups.

==== The 1981-1982 massacre ====

Between June 1981 and March 1982, the theocratic regime carried out the largest political massacre in Iranian history, targeting communists, socialists, social democrats, liberals, monarchists, moderate Islamists, and members of the Baha&#x27;i faith as part of the Iranian Cultural Revolution decreed by Khomeini on 14 June 1980 with the intent of &quot;purifying&quot; Iranian society of non-Islamic elements. Between June 1981 and June 1982, Amnesty International documented 2,946 executions, with several thousand more killed in the next two years according to the anti-government guerilla People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran. More recently, Rastyad Collective has verified the identities of more than 3,400 political dissidents who were executed between June 1981 and March 1982. These dissidents were sentenced to death by the Islamic Revolutionary Courts during show trials in more than eighty-five cities across the country on charges of spreading &quot;corruption on Earth&quot; (&quot;ifsad-fi-alarz&quot;), &quot;espionage&quot;, &quot;terrorism&quot;, or &quot;enmity against Allah&quot; (&quot;Moharebeh&quot;). Most victims of the 1981 massacre were young activists aged eleven to twenty-four. These activists were either high school students or had recently graduated from universities in Iran and abroad. During the massacre, hundreds of minors were also subjected to arbitrary detention, torture, and summary executions on ideologically motivated charges of &quot;ifsad-fi-alarz&quot; and &quot;moharebeh&quot; by the revolutionary courts. In July 2024, The Special Rapporteur published a landmark UN Report on the 1981 massacre and categorised the atrocity crimes committed in 1981 and 1982 as genocide and crimes against humanity. In this report, the Rapporteur called for the establishment of an independent and international accountability mechanism.

==== Closing of non-Islamist newspapers ====
In mid-August 1979, shortly after the election of the constitution-writing assembly, several dozen newspapers and magazines opposing Khomeini&#x27;s idea of theocratic rule by jurists were shut down. When protests were organized by the National Democratic Front (NDF), Khomeini angrily denounced them saying, &quot;we thought we were dealing with human beings. It is evident we are not.&quot;

Hundreds were injured by &quot;rocks, clubs, chains and iron bars&quot; when Hezbollahi attacked the protesters, and shortly after, a warrant was issued for the arrest of the NDF&#x27;s leader.

==== Muslim People&#x27;s Republican Party ====
In December the moderate Islamic party Muslim People&#x27;s Republican Party (MPRP) and its spiritual leader Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari had become a rallying point for Iranians who wanted democracy not theocracy. Riots broke out in Shariatmadari&#x27;s Azeri home region with members of the MPRP and Shariatmadari&#x27;s followers seizing the Tabriz television station and using it to &quot;broadcast demands and grievances.&quot; The regime reacted quickly, sending Revolutionary Guards to retake the TV station, mediators to defuse complaints and activists to stage a massive pro-Khomeini counter-demonstration. The party was suppressed, and in 1982 Shariatmadari was &quot;demoted&quot; from the rank of Grand Ayatollah and many of his clerical followers were purged.

==== Islamist left ====
In January 1980, Abolhassan Banisadr was elected president of Iran. Though an adviser to Khomeini, he was a leftist who clashed with another ally of Khomeini, the theocratic Islamic Republic Party (IRP) – the controlling power in the new parliament.

At the same time, erstwhile revolutionary allies of Khomeini – the Islamist modernist guerrilla group People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran (or MEK) – were being suppressed by Khomeini&#x27;s forces. Khomeini attacked the MEK, referring to them as &quot;monafeqin &quot;(hypocrites) and &quot;kafer&quot; (unbelievers). &quot;Hezbollahi&quot; people attacked meeting places, bookstores, and newsstands of Mujahideen and other leftists, driving them underground. Universities were closed to purge them of opponents of theocratic rule as a part of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, and 20,000 teachers and nearly 8,000 military officers deemed too westernized were dismissed.

By mid-1981 matters came to a head. An attempt by Khomeini to forge a reconciliation between Banisadr and IRP leaders had failed, and now it was Banisadr who was the rallying point &quot;for all doubters and dissidents&quot; of the theocracy, including the MEK.

When leaders of the National Front called for a demonstration in June 1981 in favor of Banisadr, Khomeini threatened its leaders with the death penalty for apostasy &quot;if they did not repent&quot;. Leaders of the Freedom Movement of Iran were compelled to make and publicly broadcast apologies for supporting the Front&#x27;s appeal. Those attending the rally were menaced by Hezbollahi and Revolutionary Guards and intimidated into silence.

On 28 June 1981, a bombing of the office of the IRP killed around 70 high-ranking officials, cabinet members and members of parliament, including Mohammad Beheshti, the secretary-general of the party and head of the Islamic Republic&#x27;s judicial system. The government arrested thousands, and there were hundreds of executions against the MEK and its followers. Despite these and other assassinations the hoped-for mass uprising and armed struggle against the Khomeiniists was crushed.

In May 1979, the Furqan Group (&quot;Guruh-i Furqan&quot;) assassinated an important lieutenant of Khomeini, Morteza Motahhari.

==Impacts==
=== International impact ===
Internationally, the initial impact of the revolution was immense. In the non-Muslim world, it changed the image of Islam, generating much interest in Islam—both sympathetic and hostile—and even speculation that the revolution might change &quot;the world balance of power more than any political event since Hitler&#x27;s conquest of Europe.&quot;

The Islamic Republic positioned itself as a revolutionary beacon under the slogan &quot;neither East nor West, only Islamic Republic&quot; (&quot;Na Sharq, Na Gharb, Faqat Jumhuri-e Islami,&quot; i.e., neither Soviet nor American / West European models) and called for the overthrow of capitalism, American influence, and social injustice in the Middle East and the rest of the world. Revolutionary leaders in Iran gave and sought support from non-Muslim activists such as the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Ireland and the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa, even favoring far-left revolutionaries over Islamist (but ideologically different and strategically harmful) causes such as the neighboring Afghan Mujahideen. The revolution itself was supported by the Palestine Liberation Organization. In terms of future relevance, the conflicts that originated from the Iranian Revolution continued to define geo-politics for the following decades.

In February 1981, the Iranian Republic supported Hunger strikes in the H-Block of the HM Prison Maze by Irish Republicans including Bobby Sands. Following the death of Sands in May 1981, the street in Tehran the British Embassy is on was renamed from &quot;Winston Churchill Street&quot; to &quot;Bobby Sands Street&quot;. The IRA saw the Iranian revolution as aspirational, an example of mass action as a way to meet goals. Both the Iranian government and their opposition supported the hunger strikes, creating a competition for the favor of the IRA. The support by the government came after the UK sided with Iraq and Saddam Hussein in the Iran–Iraq war. Oppositional groups like Mojahedin-e-Khalq claimed solidarity with the hunger strike and connected their Marxist influences. The Iranian government, Iranian leftist groups, and the IRA saw Britain as a colonizing force in both regions. For a time, Mojahedin-e-Khalq and the Provisional Sinn Féin (the political arm of the Provisional IRA) had consistent contact. Contact ended in June 1981 after fear of offending the Iranian Government.

The Islamic Republic changed the foreign policy of the Pahlavi dynasty by supporting third worldist movements like the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. The Pahlavis and South Africa had relations dating back to when Reza Shah went there in exile. After the first Shah&#x27;s ousting by the Soviets and British during World War II, he spent the remainder of his life in Johannesburg. Pre-revolution Iran provided 90% of South Africa&#x27;s oil. After the revolution, Iran cut South Africa off from its oil supply and financially supported the African National Congress. This was part of the larger want by Khomeini to support the &quot;downtrodden&quot; of the world, including, non-aligned countries. In 1980, the ANC attended the &quot;Gather of World Liberation&quot; hosted in Tehran for the third worldist movement. In 2015, the International Relations and Cooperation minister of South Africa said of Iran, &quot;The Islamic Republic stood by us during our darkest days, cutting ties with the apartheid regime. Your revolution was our revolution. You showed us that emancipation was possible, whatever the odds&quot;. A connection with the ANC continued even when tested during the apartheid era and the Iran–Iraq war. In 1985, Iran and South Africa traded weapons for oil. The belief in third-worldism seemed to have superseded the change in behavior by Iran.

=== Persian Gulf and the Iran–Iraq War ===

Supporters of the revolution both within and outside of Iran began calling for the overthrow of monarchies in the region and for them to be replaced by Islamic republics. This alarmed many of Iran&#x27;s neighbours, particularly Kuwait, Iraq and Saudi Arabia as well as Western nations dependent on Middle Eastern oil for their energy needs.

In September 1980, Iraq took advantage of the febrile situation and invaded Iran. At the centre of Iraq&#x27;s objectives was the annexation of the East Bank of the Shaat Al-Arab waterway that makes up part of the border between the two nations and which had been the site of numerous border skirmishes between the two countries going back to the late 1960s. The president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, also wanted to annex the Iranian province of Khuzestan, substantially populated by Iranian Arabs. There was also concern that a Shia-centric revolution in Iran may stimulate a similar uprising in Iraq, where the country&#x27;s Sunni minority ruled over the Shia majority.

Hussein was confident that with Iraq&#x27;s armed forces being well-equipped with new technology and with high morale would enjoy a decisive strategic advantage against an Iranian military that had recently had much of its command officers purged following the revolution. Iran was also struggling to find replacement parts for much of its US- and British-supplied equipment. Hussein believed that victory would therefore come swiftly.

However, Iran was &quot;galvanized&quot; by the invasion and the populace of Iran rallied behind their new government in an effort to repel the invaders. After some early successes, the Iraqi invasion stalled and was then repelled and by 1982, Iran had recaptured almost all of its territories. In June 1982, with Iraqi forces all but expelled from Iranian territory, the Iraqi government offered a ceasefire. This was rejected by Khomeini, who declared that the only condition for peace was that &quot;the regime in Baghdad must fall and must be replaced by an Islamic republic&quot;.

The war would continue for another six years during which time countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Gulf states provided financial assistance to Iraq in an effort to prevent an Iranian victory, even though their relations with Iraq were often hostile – Kuwait itself was invaded by Iraq two years after the peace agreement between Iraq and Iran was signed.

The war served in part as an opportunity for the government to strengthen revolutionary ardour and revolutionary groups; the Revolutionary Guard and committees at the expense of its remaining allies-turned-opponents, such as the MEK. While enormously costly and destructive, the war &quot;rejuvenate[d] the drive for national unity and Islamic revolution&quot; and &quot;inhibited fractious debate and dispute&quot; in Iran.

=== Foreign relations ===

The Islamic Republic of Iran experienced difficult relations with some Western countries, especially the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the Eastern Bloc nations led by the Soviet Union. Iran was under constant US unilateral sanctions, which were tightened under the presidency of Bill Clinton. Most European countries, despite their significant investments within Iran, stood in solidarity with the United States and also imposed economic sanctions on the theocratic regime. Britain suspended all diplomatic relations with Iran and did not re-open their embassy in Tehran until 1988. The European country that maintained the closest relations with the new Iranian government was Switzerland, which was neither a part of the European Economic Community or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Relations with the USSR became strained as well after the Soviet government condemned Khomeini&#x27;s repression of certain minorities after the revolution. Diplomatic relations between Iran and the apartheid government of South Africa were completely severed following Khomeini&#x27;s rise to power.

Israel had relations with Iran under the Shah, but relations were cut on 18 February 1979 when Iran adopted an anti-Zionist stance. The former Israeli embassy in Tehran was handed over to the PLO, and Iran has allied and funded several anti-Israeli Islamist militant groups since.

After the U.S. sanctions were tightened and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation and the People&#x27;s Republic of China became the main principal allies for Iran. Relations between the two countries improved after Vladimir Putin took office in 2000 and increasingly warmer in recent years following an international backlash over the annexation of Crimea in 2014 which led to sanctions by the Western powers. Russia had sought Iran on expanding arms trade over the past three decades especially with the cooperation with the Assad government during the Syrian civil war. Iran also began its economic cooperation with China that includes &quot;political, strategic and economic&quot; components between the two nations.

=== In the Muslim world ===

In the Muslim world, particularly in its early years, the revolution inspired enormous enthusiasm and redoubled opposition to western imperialism, intervention and influence. Islamist insurgents rose in Saudi Arabia (1979), Egypt (1981), Syria (1982), and Lebanon (1983).

In Pakistan, it has been noted that the &quot;press was largely favorable towards the new government&quot;; the Islamist parties were even more enthusiastic; while the ruler, General Zia-ul-Haq, himself on an Islamization drive since he took power in 1977, talked of &quot;simultaneous triumph of Islamic ideology in both our countries&quot; and that &quot;Khomeini is a symbol of Islamic insurgence.&quot; Some American analysts noted that, at this point, Khomeini&#x27;s influence and prestige in Pakistan was greater than Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s himself. After Khomeini claimed that Americans were behind the 1979 Grand Mosque seizure, student protesters from the Quaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad attacked the US embassy, setting it on fire and taking hostages. While the crisis was quickly defused by the Pakistan military, the next day, before some 120 Pakistani army officers stationed in Iran on the road to hajj, Khomeini said, &quot;it is a cause of joy that… all Pakistan has risen against the United States&quot; and the struggle is not that of the US and Iran but &quot;the entire world of disbelief and the world of Islam&quot;. According to journalist Yaroslav Trofimov, &quot;the Pakistani officers, many of whom had graduated from Western military academies, seemed swayed by the ayatollah&#x27;s intoxicating words.&quot;

Ultimately only the Lebanese Islamists succeeded. The Islamic revolutionary government itself is credited with helping establish Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq.

On the other side of the ledger, at least one observer argues that despite great effort and expense the only countries outside Iran the revolution had a &quot;measure of lasting influence&quot; on are Lebanon and Iraq. Others claim the devastating Iran–Iraq War &quot;mortally wounded ... the ideal of spreading the Islamic revolution,&quot; or that the Islamic Republic&#x27;s pursuit of an ideological rather than a &quot;nationalist, pragmatic&quot; foreign policy has weakened Iran&#x27;s &quot;place as a great regional power&quot;.

=== Domestic impact ===

Views differ on the impact of the revolution. For some it was &quot;the most significant, hopeful and profound event in the entirety of contemporary Islamic history&quot;, while other Iranians believe that the revolution was a time when &quot;for a few years we all lost our minds&quot;, and which &quot;promised us heaven, but... created a hell on earth.&quot;

Internally, Iran has had some success with the governmental promotion of Islam, and the elimination of secularism and American influence in government. Criticisms have been raised with regards to political freedom, governmental honesty and efficiency, economic equality and self-sufficiency, or even popular religious devotion. Opinion polls and observers report widespread dissatisfaction, including a &quot;rift&quot; between the revolutionary generation and younger Iranians who find it &quot;impossible to understand what their parents were so passionate about.&quot; To honor the 40th anniversary of revolution around 50,000 prisoners were forgiven by order Ali Khamenei to receive &quot;Islamic clemency&quot;. Many religious minorities such as Christians, Baháʼís, Jews and Zoroastrians have had to flee Iran since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

Literacy has continued to increase under the Islamic Republic. By 2002, illiteracy rates dropped by more than half. Maternal and infant mortality rates have also been cut significantly. Population growth was first encouraged but discouraged after 1988. Overall, Iran&#x27;s Human development Index rating has climbed significantly from 0.569 in 1980 to 0.732 in 2002, on a par with neighbouring Turkey. In the latest HDI, however, Iran has since fallen 8 ranks below Turkey.

=== Politics and government ===

Iran has elected governmental bodies at the national, provincial, and local levels. Although these bodies are subordinate to theocracy – which has veto power over who can run for parliament (or Islamic Consultative Assembly) and whether its bills can become law – they have more power than equivalent organs in the Shah&#x27;s government.

Iran&#x27;s Sunni minority (about 8%) has seen some unrest. Five of the 290 parliamentary seats are allocated to their communities.

The members of the Baháʼí Faith have been declared heretical and subversive. While persecution occurred before the revolution since then more than 200 Baháʼís have been executed or presumed killed, and many more have been imprisoned, deprived of jobs, pensions, businesses, and educational opportunities. Baháʼí holy places have been confiscated, vandalized, or destroyed. More recently, Baháʼís in Iran have been deprived of education and work. Several thousand young Baháʼís between the ages of 17 and 24 have been expelled from universities.

Whether the Islamic Republic has brought more or less severe political repression is disputed. Grumbling once done about the tyranny and corruption of the Shah and his court is now directed against &quot;the Mullahs.&quot; Fear of SAVAK has been replaced by fear of Revolutionary Guards, and other religious revolutionary enforcers. Violations of human rights by the theocratic government is said to be worse than during the monarchy, and in any case extremely grave. Reports of torture, imprisonment of dissidents, and the murder of prominent critics have been made by human rights groups.
Censorship is handled by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, without whose official permission, &quot;no books or magazines are published, no audiotapes are distributed, no movies are shown and no cultural organization is established. Men and women are not allowed to dance or swim with each other.&quot;

=== Women ===
Throughout the beginning of the 20th century and prior to the revolution, many women leaders emerged and demanded basic social rights for women. During the reign of Reza Shah, the government mandated the removal of the veil and promoted the education of young girls. However, the push-back of the Shia clerics made progress difficult, and the government had to contain its promotion of basic women&#x27;s rights to the norms of the patriarchal social hierarchy to accommodate the clerics. After the abdication of Reza Shah in 1941, the discipline of the government decreased, and women were able to further exercise their rights, including the ability to wear the veil if they wanted. More organization of women&#x27;s groups occurred in the 1960s and 70s, and they used the government&#x27;s modernization to define and advocate for women&#x27;s issues. During these decades, women became active in formerly male domains such as the parliament, the cabinet, armed forces, legal professions, and fields of science and technology. Additionally, women achieved the right to vote in 1963. Many of these achievements and rights that Iranian women had gained in the decades leading up to the revolution were reversed by the Islamic Revolution.

The revolutionary government rewrote laws in an attempt to force women to leave the workforce by promoting the early retirement of female government employees, the closing of childcare centers, enforcing full Islamic cover in offices and public places, as well as preventing women from studying in 140 fields in higher education. Women fought back against these changes, and as activist and writer Mahnaz Afkhami writes, &quot;The regime succeeded in putting women back in the veil in public places, but not in resocializing them into fundamentalist norms.&quot; After the revolution, women often had to work hard to support their families as the post-revolutionary economy suffered. Women also asserted themselves in the arts, literature, education, and politics.

Women – especially those from traditional backgrounds – participated on a large scale in demonstrations leading up to the revolution. They were encouraged by Ayatollah Khomeini to join him in overthrowing the Pahlavi dynasty. However, most of these women expected the revolution to lead to an increase in their rights and opportunities rather than the restrictions that actually occurred. The policy enacted by the revolutionary government and its attempts to limit the rights of women were challenged by the mobilization and politicization of women that occurred during and after the revolution. Women&#x27;s resistance included remaining in the work force in large numbers and challenging Islamic dress by showing hair under their head scarves. The Iranian government has had to reconsider and change aspects of its policies towards women because of their resistance to laws that restrict their rights.

Since the revolution, university enrollment and the number of women in the civil service and higher education has risen. and several women have been elected to the Iranian parliament.

=== Homosexuality ===

Homosexuality has a long history in pre-modern Iran. Sextus Empiricus asserts in his &quot;Outlines of Scepticism&quot; (written c. 200 CE) that the laws of the Parthian Empire were tolerant towards homosexual behaviour, and Persian men were known to &quot;indulge in intercourse with males.&quot; (1:152) These ancient practices continued into the Islamic period of Iran, with one scholar noting how &quot;...homosexuality and homoerotic expressions were tolerated in numerous public places, from monasteries and seminaries to taverns, military camps, bathhouses and coffee houses. In the early Safavid era (1501–1723), male houses of prostitution (&quot;amard khaneh&quot;) were legally recognized and paid taxes.&quot; It was during the late Qajar period that following modernization the society was heteronormalized. During the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, a faux same-sex wedding occurred between two young men with ties to the royal court, which became a source of shame and outrage for some citizens and was utilized by Islamists as further evidence of the &quot;immoral&quot; monarchy. This also tied the monarchy to the West, which had begun to be regarded in reactionary Islamic discourse as immoral due to &quot;...female nudity and open adult male homosexuality.&quot;.

When Ruhollah Khomeini came to power in 1979, he called for homosexuals to be &quot;exterminated&quot;, and one of his first political actions was to institute imprisonment, corporal punishment, and the death penalty for any sexual acts outside traditional Islamic heterosexual marriage. In a 1979 interview with The New York Times, a journalist asked Khomeini to justify the state-sanctioned shootings of homosexuals. In reply Khomeini compared them as well as other adulterers to gangrene, thieves, and murderers.

Iran is currently one of the world&#x27;s only jurisdictions to actively execute gay men. Amnesty International reports that approximately 5,000 homosexuals have been executed in Iran since the revolution, including two gay men executed in 2014, both hanged for engaging in consensual homosexual relations.

=== Economic impact ===

Iran&#x27;s post-revolutionary economy has a significant state-owned or parastatal sector, including businesses owned by the Revolutionary Guards and Bonyad foundations.

Since the revolution Iran&#x27;s GDP (PPP) has grown from $114 billion in 1980 to $858 billion in 2010. GDP per capita (PPP) has grown from $4,295 in 1980 to $11,396 in 2010.

Since the revolution Iran&#x27;s GDP (Nominal) has grown from $90.392 billion in 1979 to $385.874 in 2015. GDP per capita (nominal) has grown from $2290 in 1979 to $5470 in 2016. Real GNI per capita in 2011 constant international dollars decreased after the revolution and during the Iran-Iraq war from $7762 in 1979 to $3699 at the end of the war in 1989. After three decades of reconstruction and growth since then, it has not yet reached its 1979 level and has only recovered to $6751 in 2016. Data on GNI per capita in PPP terms is only available since 1990 globally. In PPP terms, GNI per capita has increased from Int. $11,425 in 1990 to Int. $18,544 in 2016. But most of this increase can be attributed to the rise in oil prices in the 2000s.

The value of Iran&#x27;s currency declined precipitously after the revolution. Whereas on 15 March 1978, 71.46 rials equaled one U.S. dollar, in January 2018, 44,650 rials amounted to one dollar.

The economy has become slightly more diversified since the revolution, with 80% of Iranian GDP dependent on oil and gas as of 2010. The Islamic Republic lags some countries in transparency and ease of doing business according to international surveys. Transparency International ranked Iran 136th out of 175 countries in transparency (i.e., lack of corruption) for its 2014 index; and the IRI was ranked 130th out of the 189 countries surveyed in the World Bank 2015 Doing Business Report.

===Islamic political culture===
It is said that there were attempts to incorporate modern political and social concepts into Islamic canon since 1950. The attempt was a reaction to the secular political discourse namely Marxism, liberalism and nationalism. Following the death of Ayatollah Boroujerdi, some of the scholars like Murtaza Mutahhari, Muhammad Beheshti and Mahmoud Taleghani found new opportunity to change conditions. Before them, Boroujerdi was considered a conservative Marja. They tried to reform conditions after the death of the ayatollah. They presented their arguments by rendering lectures in 1960 and 1963 in Tehran. The result of the lectures was the book &quot;An inquiry into principles of Mar&#x27;jaiyat&quot;. Some of the major issues highlighted were the government in Islam, the need for the clergy&#x27;s independent financial organization, Islam as a way of life, advising and guiding youth and necessity of being community. Allameh Tabatabei refers to velayat as a political philosophy for Shia and velayat faqih for Shia community. There are also other attempts to formulate a new attitude of Islam such as the publication of three volumes of Maktab Tashayyo. Also some believe that it is indispensable to revive the religious gathered in Hoseyniyeh-e-Ershad.

<doc id="347282" wikidata="Q854696" url="?curid=347282" title="List of current cardinals">
<text>Cardinals are senior members of the clergy of the Catholic Church. As titular members of the clergy of the Diocese of Rome, they serve as advisors to the pope, who is the bishop of Rome. They are typically ordained bishops and generally hold important roles within the church, such as leading prominent archdioceses or heading dicasteries within the Roman Curia. Cardinals are chosen by the pope and formally created in a consistory, and one of their foremost duties is the election of a new pope – invariably from among their number, although not strictly a requirement – when the Holy See is vacant (&quot;sede vacante&quot;), following the death or resignation of a pope. Collectively, they constitute the College of Cardinals.

Under current ecclesiastical law, as defined by the apostolic constitution &quot;Universi Dominici gregis&quot;, only cardinals who have not passed their 80th birthdays on the day on which the Holy See becomes vacant are eligible to take part in a papal conclave to elect a new pope. The same apostolic constitution specifies that no more than 120 cardinals may take part in a conclave, but makes no provision for there being more than 120 eligible cardinal electors, a number that has often been exceeded. Cardinals may be created &quot;in pectore&quot; (&#x27;in the breast&#x27;), in which case the pope does not reveal their identities; they are not entitled to the privileges of a cardinal until their names are published by the pope. The creations of any such cardinals whose names have not been revealed before the pope&#x27;s death or resignation automatically lapse.

&lt;section begin=&quot;as of&quot;/&gt;&lt;section end=&quot;as of&quot;/&gt; there are &lt;section begin=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;252&lt;section end=&quot;all&quot;/&gt; cardinals, &lt;section begin=&quot;electors&quot;/&gt;138&lt;section end=&quot;electors&quot;/&gt; of whom are cardinal electors. The most recent consistory for the creation of cardinals was held on 7 December 2024, when Pope Francis created 21 cardinals, including 20 cardinal electors. Christoph Schönborn was the most recent cardinal elector to turn 80, on 22 January 2025; Fernando Vérgez Alzaga will be the next cardinal elector to turn 80, on 1 March 2025. The most recent death of a cardinal was that of Angelo Amato on 31 December 2024, at the age of 86.

== Cardinals ==
The College of Cardinals is divided into three orders, with formal precedence in the following sequence:

# Cardinal bishops (CB): the six cardinals who are assigned the titles of the seven suburbicarian dioceses in the vicinity of Rome by the pope, plus a few other cardinals who have been exceptionally co-opted into the order, as well as patriarchs who head one of the Eastern Catholic Churches. The two most senior cardinal bishops, who are elected by the cardinal bishops from among themselves (excluding the Eastern Catholic patriarchs) and approved by the pope, are the dean and the vice dean, currently Giovanni Battista Re and Leonardo Sandri, respectively; among the cardinal electors, the senior cardinal bishop is Pietro Parolin.
# Cardinal priests (CP): bishops typically in charge of dioceses around the world, as well as former cardinal deacons who have opted to be elevated to the order. The most senior cardinal priest is the protopriest, currently Michael Michai Kitbunchu; among the cardinal electors, the senior cardinal priest is Vinko Puljić.
# Cardinal deacons (CD): bishops who work in the Roman Curia or the diplomatic service of the Holy See, and all other clergy, including priests who have been granted a dispensation not to be consecrated a bishop before becoming a cardinal. They have the choice () of opting to become cardinal priests after having been cardinal deacons for ten years. The most senior cardinal deacon is the protodeacon, currently Dominique Mamberti; he is also the senior cardinal deacon among the cardinal electors. The junior cardinal deacon among the electors is George Koovakad.

For cardinal bishops (excluding the Eastern Catholic patriarchs), the dean is first in precedence, followed by the vice dean and then, in order of appointment as cardinal bishops, by the remainder. For cardinal bishops who are Eastern Catholic patriarchs, for cardinal priests and for cardinal deacons, precedence is determined by the date of the consistory in which they were created cardinals and then by the order in which they appeared in the official announcement or bulletin.

All cardinals listed are members of the Latin Church unless otherwise stated. Cardinals belonging to institutes of consecrated life or to societies of apostolic life are indicated by the relevant post-nominal letters. Cardinals in charge of dioceses are classified under the country in which their diocese is located, although they may be citizens of a different country.

<doc id="347289" wikidata="Q52973" url="?curid=347289" title="Poznań Voivodeship">
<text>Poznań Voivodeship was the name of several former administrative regions (&quot;województwo&quot;, rendered as &quot;voivodeship&quot; and usually translated as &quot;province&quot;) in Poland, centered on the city of Poznań, although the exact boundaries changed over the years. Poznań Voivodeship was incorporated into the Greater Poland Voivodeship after the Polish local government reforms of 1998. 

==14th century to 1793==

Poznań Voivodeship () was established in 1320 and was part of the Greater Poland Voivodeship, until it was annexed by Prussia in 1793. It was in the rule of the Garczynski family for much of the 17th and 18th century. A notable voïvodie includes Stefan_Garczyński_(1690–1756), author, who was opposed to serfdom, amongst other social norms of the time.

==1793 to 1921==
Between 1793 and 1921, the territory formerly contained in Poznań Voivodeship was part of the following territories: South Prussia, the Poznań Department of the Duchy of Warsaw, the Grand Duchy of Posen, and the Province of Posen in Prussia.

==1921 to 1939==

After World War I, Poznań Voivodeship was created from the Prussian-German province of Poznań. The borders were changed in 1939: Bydgoszcz passed to the Pomeranian Voivodeship, but some Eastern areas were included. After the changes, the area was 28,089 km2 with a population of 2,339,600 people (see: Territorial changes of Polish Voivodeships on April 1, 1938).

* Regional capital: Poznań.
* Principal cities: Bydgoszcz, Gniezno, Inowrocław, Jarocin, Krotoszyn, Leszno, Miedzychód, Ostrów Wielkopolski, Rawicz.

==1939 to 1945==
During World War II, Poland was occupied by Nazi and Soviet forces and the territory annexed by Germany was named the Reichsgau Wartheland, which partially overlapped with the former Province of Posen and also had Poznań/Posen as its capital. 

==1945 to 1975==
After 1945, the administrative unit centered on Poznań was again known as Poznań Voivodeship. It was superseded by a redrawn Poznań Voivodeship and Kalisz, Konin, Piła and Leszno Voivodeships.

==1975 to 1998==

The Poznań Voivodeship () as redrawn in 1975 was again superseded by the Greater Poland Voivodeship, which was formed by the merger of five former Voivodeships.

Capital city: Poznań.

Major cities and towns (with populations in 1995):
* Poznań (581,800);
* Gniezno (71,000);
* Śrem (29,800);
* Września (28,600);
* Swarzędz (26,100);
* Środa Wielkopolska (21,400);
* Luboń (20,700);

<doc id="347297" wikidata="Q727270" url="?curid=347297" title="Designated hitter">
<text>The designated hitter (DH) is a baseball player who bats in place of another position player, most commonly the pitcher. Unlike other players in a team&#x27;s lineup, they generally only play as an offensive player and usually do not play defense as a fielder or a pitcher during a game. Due to their specialized offensive-only role, the designated hitter is generally expected to produce above average offensive stats and production compared to other players who play defense.

In Major League Baseball, the position is authorized by Rule 5.11 of the Official Baseball Rules. It was adopted by the American League in and by the National League in , making it universal in MLB. Within that time frame, nearly all amateur, collegiate, and professional leagues worldwide have adopted the designated hitter or some variant, except for Nippon Professional Baseball&#x27;s Central League.

==Major League Baseball rule==
The designated hitter is a player who does not play a position in the field, but instead replaces the pitcher in the batting order. However, a starting pitcher (but not relievers) may choose to also start as the designated hitter, so that the pitcher bats for himself. The DH may only be used for the pitcher (and not any other position player), as stated in Rule 5.11. Use of the DH is optional, but must be determined before the start of the game. If a team does not begin a game with a DH, the team&#x27;s pitchers (or pinch hitters) must bat for the entire game.

The designated hitter can be moved to a fielding position during the game. If the DH is moved to another position, his team forfeits the role of designated hitter, and the pitcher or another player (the latter possible only in case of a multiple substitution) would bat in the spot of the position player replaced by the former DH. If the designated hitter is moved to pitcher, any subsequent pitcher (or pinch-hitter thereof) would bat should that spot in the batting order come up again (except for a further multiple substitution). Likewise, if a pinch-hitter bats for a non-pitcher, and then remains in the game as the pitcher, the team would forfeit the use of the DH for the remainder of the game, and the player who was DH would become a position player (or exit the game).

The DH substitution rule has an exception: If a starting pitcher started simultaneously as the designated hitter, that player will remain as DH to bat for his relievers after being replaced as pitcher, likewise remaining as starting pitcher if he was pinch hit by a bench player who&#x27;d become the new designated hitter. The exception was added by MLB for the 2022 season, coincident with the introduction of the universal DH. It has been widely nicknamed the &quot;Ohtani rule&quot; as a nod to Shohei Ohtani, at the time a two-way star pitcher and hitter for the Los Angeles Angels who had sometimes batted for himself in the past, but had to leave games as hitter or move to another position on the field when relieved as pitcher due to the limitations of the old rule. The rule change was subsequently applied for international-level games, starting with the 2023 World Baseball Classic.

Unlike other positions, the DH is &quot;locked&quot; into the batting order. No multiple substitution may be made to alter the batting rotation of the DH. In other words, a double switch involving the DH and a position player (with the exception of players started as starting pitcher and designated hitter) is not legal. For example, if the DH is batting fourth and the catcher is batting eighth, the manager cannot replace both players so as to have the new catcher bat fourth and the new DH bat eighth. Once a team loses its DH under any of the scenarios already discussed, the double switch becomes fully available, and may well be used via necessity, should the former DH be replaced in the lineup.

=== Interleague play and exhibitions (until 2021) ===

In Major League Baseball, during interleague play between 1997 and 2021, the DH rule was applied to a game based on the rules of the home team&#x27;s league. If the game was played in an American League park, the designated hitter could be used; in a National League park, the pitcher must bat or else be replaced with a pinch-hitter. On June 12, 1997, San Francisco Giants outfielder Glenallen Hill became the first National League DH in a regular-season game, when the Giants met the American League Texas Rangers at The Ballpark in Arlington in interleague play.

At first, the DH rule was not applied to the World Series. From 1973 to 1975, all World Series games were played under National League rules, with no DH and the pitchers required to bat. For 1976, it was decided the DH rule would apply to all games in a World Series, regardless of venue, but only in even-numbered years. Cincinnati Reds first baseman Dan Driessen became the first National League player to act as a DH in any capacity (regular season or postseason) when he was listed as the DH in the first game (he was the DH in all four Series games that year). This practice lasted through 1985. Beginning in the 1986 World Series, the DH rule was used in games played in the stadium of the American League representative.

There was initially no DH in the All-Star Game. Beginning in 1989, the rule was applied only to games played in American League stadiums. During this era, if the All-Star Game was scheduled for an American League stadium, fans would vote for the DH for the American League&#x27;s starting lineup, while the National League&#x27;s manager decided that league&#x27;s starting DH. Since 2010, the designated hitter has been used by both teams regardless of where the game is played.

For the 2021 All-Star Game, MLB granted an exception to the normal designated hitter rule because Los Angeles Angels&#x27; Shohei Ohtani was selected as both starting designated hitter and starting pitcher. Ohtani started the game as both a pitcher and the DH and was replaced as pitcher after one inning but remained in the game as the DH without the American League having to forfeit the use of a DH. The American League would have lost the DH if either Ohtani, or a player replacing him at DH, had played a position in the field other than pitcher.

==Background and history==
The rationale for the designated hitter rule arose early in the history of professional baseball. During the 1880s, an increased emphasis on improving the specialized skill of pitching contributed to a decline in pitcher batting averages. In 1891, during negotiations surrounding the merger of the American Association and National League, team executives J. Walter Spalding of New York and William Chase Temple of Pittsburgh proposed competing ideas to eliminate the pitcher from the batting order. Temple&#x27;s proposal &quot;favored the substitution of another man to take the pitcher&#x27;s place at the bat when it came his turn to go there,&quot; while Spalding proposed removing the pitcher&#x27;s turn from the batting order, reducing its length to eight players. Temple&#x27;s proposal was voted down by a narrow margin prior to the 1892 season.

The idea of a designated hitter was raised by Philadelphia Athletics manager Connie Mack in 1906, however, his proposal received little support.

Pitchers rejected the idea of giving up hitting. In 1910, Addie Joss stated, &quot;if there is one thing that a pitcher would rather do than make the opposing batsmen look foolish, it is to step to the plate, especially in a pinch, and deliver the much-needed hit.&quot; A 1918 article in &quot;Baseball Magazine&quot; attributed to Babe Ruth stated, &quot;the pitcher who can&#x27;t get in there in the pinch and win his own game with a healthy wallop, isn&#x27;t more than half earning his salary in my way of thinking.&quot; Nevertheless, in the late 1920s, National League president John Heydler made several attempts to introduce a 10th-man designated hitter as a way to add more offense to the game. Several managers were interested in the idea and intended to implement it during spring training in 1929. However, Heydler&#x27;s proposal was not adopted as an official rule change, and he advised teams to have pitchers bat during spring training in order for them to prepare for the regular season.

Serious momentum to implement the designated hitter was absent until the pitching dominance of the late 1960s. In 1968, Bob Gibson led the major leagues with a live-ball era record 1.12 ERA. For the first time since 1908, the American and National Leagues had a collective batting average below .240; Carl Yastrzemski led the American League in hitting with only a .301 mark. After the season, in order to increase offensive output, the height of the pitcher&#x27;s mound was reduced from , and the upper limit of the strike zone was lowered from the top of a batter&#x27;s shoulders to his armpits. In 1969, the International League and four other minor leagues began a four-year trial period for the designated hitter. The American League allowed its use in spring training in 1971, however, when the minor league trial period ended, the American and National Leagues could not agree on implementation.

Like other experimental baseball rule changes of the 1960s and 1970s, the DH was embraced by Oakland Athletics owner Charlie O. Finley. On January 11, 1973, Finley and the other American League owners voted 8–4 to approve the designated hitter for a three-year trial run. The National League chose not to implement the DH; it was intended for the two leagues to agree on a common rule at the end of the American League&#x27;s trial. On April 6, 1973, Ron Blomberg of the New York Yankees became the first designated hitter in MLB history, facing Boston Red Sox right-hander Luis Tiant in his first plate appearance. Blomberg was walked on five pitches with the bases loaded in the first inning. As expected, the American League posted a higher batting average than the National League in 1973. This trend held in every season in which the American League employed the designated hitter but the National League did not between 1973 and 2021.

At the end of its three-year trial period, the American League kept the designated hitter, while the National League still refused to adopt it. In response to increases in American League attendance because of the DH, the National League held a vote on August 13, 1980, to determine whether or not to adopt it. A majority of the 12 member teams was necessary to pass the rule, and the measure was expected to pass. However, when the teams were informed that the rule would not take effect until the 1982 season, Philadelphia Phillies vice president Bill Giles was unsure of how the team owner, Ruly Carpenter, wanted him to vote. Unable to contact Carpenter, who was on a fishing trip, Giles was forced to abstain from voting. Prior to the meeting, Harding Peterson, general manager for the Pittsburgh Pirates, was told to side with the Phillies however they voted. The final tally was four teams voting for the DH (the Atlanta Braves, New York Mets, St. Louis Cardinals, and San Diego Padres), five votes against (the Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, Los Angeles Dodgers, Montreal Expos, and San Francisco Giants), and three abstentions (the Phillies, Pirates, and Houston Astros). Five days after that meeting, the Cardinals fired their general manager, John Claiborne, who was the leading proponent for the adoption of the DH rule, and the National League never held another vote on the issue.

The designated hitter was not used in the World Series from 1973 to 1975. Between 1976 and 1985, the DH was used in the World Series during even-numbered years, while pitchers batted in odd-numbered years. In 1986, the rule was changed to implement designated hitters only in World Series games in which the home team was from the American League. This rule was also adopted for interleague play during the regular season upon its introduction in 1997.

As time passed, the designated hitter rule enabled American League managers to employ diverse strategies in setting their teams&#x27; lineups. Managers could rotate the DH role among part-time players (for example, using a left-handed batter against a right-handed pitcher and vice versa), or they could employ a full-time designated hitter against all pitchers. Healthy regular lineup players gained the ability to take a partial day off by not playing the field, while aging, injured, and injury prone players gained the opportunity to bat without being exposed to re-injury while fielding. , only a handful of players compiled over 400 at-bats as a DH each year.

The Astros moved to the American League in 2013, giving each league 15 teams and requiring interleague play throughout the entire season. There was debate within MLB to unify the rules of the two leagues, with either the American League returning to its pre-1973 rules and having the pitcher hit or the National League adopting the DH. In January 2016, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred indicated that consideration was given to the National League adopting the DH for the 2017 season, when a new collective bargaining agreement would take effect. However, he later backtracked, saying that he did not envision such a change being made in the near future. Accordingly, the DH rule was not then adopted by the National League.

In 2020, as a health and safety measure due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the National League used the DH for the first time. For the first time since 1972 (the final year before the American League adopted the DH), the National League had the higher seasonal batting average of the two leagues. At least one of the proposals released during negotiations between MLB and the Major League Baseball Players&#x27; Association (MLBPA) regarding the 2021 season&#x27;s rules included the so-called &quot;universal DH,&quot; but an impasse led to a temporary return to National League pitchers hitting in that year.

On April 4, 2021, an American League team voluntarily declined to use a designated hitter in their starting lineup for the first time since 1976, when the Los Angeles Angels placed starting pitcher Shohei Ohtani second in the batting order. This was also the first time since 1903 that a pitcher had been listed as the second hitter in the starting lineup. On June 23, 2021, Ohtani made history again when, for the first time, an AL team did not use the designated hitter and an NL team did. While the Angels declined the DH privilege, the visiting Giants opted to use it, starting Alex Dickerson at DH.

On February 10, 2022, Manfred announced plans for a universal DH beginning with the 2022 season. The rule was ratified as part of a new collective bargaining agreement with the MLBPA on March 10, 2022, after which both leagues have continuously employed the designated hitter.

==Awards==

The Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America presents an annual award to the outstanding designated hitter of the season, called the Edgar Martínez Award. Renamed for the former Seattle Mariners DH after his retirement in 2004, the Outstanding DH Award was introduced in 1973 and has been handed out every season since, except 1994 due to a players&#x27; strike. Multiple winners include Edgar Martínez (five times) and David Ortiz (eight times, five consecutively).

DHs have generally not had much impact on the Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award or National Baseball Hall of Fame voting, because of the relative rarity of the full-time DH and the DH not contributing defense.

In 2021, Shohei Ohtani became the first everyday DH to win league MVP honors, having played in 126 of 155 games (81.29%) at DH. However, Ohtani&#x27;s MVP season was mainly due to his success as a two-way player, having also logged 23 games as a pitcher and seven games in the outfield. In 2023, Ohtani won his second MVP award, playing 134 of 135 games as a DH that season while also pitching in 23 of those games. In 2024, Ohtani, now playing in the National League with the Los Angeles Dodgers, won his second consecutive MVP award, the first time the award was given to a player who exclusively played as a DH. Due to Tommy John surgery on his pitching elbow, Ohtani only played as a DH throughout the 2024 season.

During the 1993 season Paul Molitor became the first player to win the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, while playing 137 of 160 games (85.63%) as a designated hitter. Hideki Matsui (2009), David Ortiz (2013), and Jorge Soler (2021) were the only other designated hitters to win World Series MVP. Soler was also the only DH to win the award while a member of a National League team, having played for the Atlanta Braves in their World Series-winning season. In games played on National League parks, Ortiz and Molitor played at first base, while Soler played in right field in their World Series MVP seasons. On the other hand, Matsui became the only World Series MVP to never play in the field that season, as he came in as a pinch hitter in the pitcher&#x27;s spot but was never moved to a fielding position via a double switch during games played in a National League park. Ortiz was also the first designated hitter to win the ALCS MVP in 2004, followed by Delmon Young in 2012, and Yordan Alvarez in 2021.

Among Hall of Famers, Paul Molitor and Jim Rice were, until 2014, the only inductees to even have played at least 25% of their games at DH, though Molitor played more games at DH than any other position during his career. In 2014, Frank Thomas became the first Hall of Famer who played the majority of his games at DH. In 2019, Edgar Martínez and Harold Baines were inducted into the Hall of Fame. Martinez played over 70% of his games at DH. Baines played 1,643 of his 2,830 games at DH; he played only 63 games in the field between 1989 and the end of his career in 2001. In 2022, David Ortiz became the first full-time DH to be elected to the Hall of Fame on his first ballot. Ortiz played 2,028 of his 2,306 career games (88%) at DH.

Prior to 2020, only one designated hitter Silver Slugger Award was awarded, and only American League players were the recipients due to the National League still awarding a pitcher Silver Slugger Award. In 2020, and since 2022, both American and National Leagues began awarding Silver Slugger Awards for designated hitters, the latter replacing the award given to pitchers. The first National League DH Silver Slugger Award was given to Marcell Ozuna in 2020. In 2018, J. D. Martinez became the first and to date only player to win two Silver Slugger Awards in the same season, winning as both a designated hitter and a left fielder.

==Debate==
There has been ongoing debate on the merits of the designated hitter rule. As noted before, the original rationale was to replace pitchers in the batting order because they were generally considered weak hitters, and usually batted ninth or pinch-hit for late in games when their team was trailing.

Critics have argued that use of the designated hitter causes asymmetry by separating players into offensive and defensive specialties akin to American football. They believe the rule effectively separates pitchers, other fielders, and designated hitters into separate roles that never coincide, potentially promoting &#x27;batting cage&#x27; players having extremely limited scope of experience. However, when the pitcher bats alongside everyone else, all nine players must take their turn at the plate and in the field, and the combined roles require that everyone knows other roles in addition to their own.

The designated hitter rule also changes managerial strategy in late innings. In the National League, a manager had to decide when to let a pitcher bat or remove him, as well as whom to pinch-hit and where or if that player should take the field afterward. When the decision to remove a pitcher is made, the manager may also elect to double switch, delaying the new pitcher&#x27;s turn at bat. A designated hitter reduces the need for late-inning pinch hitters.

Advocates of the designated hitter point to the extension of many careers it has enabled, and, in a few cases, &quot;created&quot; long, productive careers for players who are weak fielders or have a history of injuries, such as Cecil Fielder and David Ortiz. Hall of Fame members George Brett, Carl Yastrzemski, Paul Molitor, Harold Baines and Edgar Martínez continued their careers longer than they ordinarily would have without the rule. Barry Bonds, who spent his entire career in the National League and even won eight Gold Gloves earlier in his career, was used strictly as a DH later in his career when the San Francisco Giants played away interleague games because of his diminishing fielding skills. Some believe that extending careers of older players is more of a disadvantage than an advantage, filling spots that otherwise may have been taken by younger players who end up not finding a place in the major leagues.

Prior to the introduction of the universal DH, interleague play added a new wrinkle to the controversy, as the AL team always had the advantage. The NL team had to put a bench player into the lineup when the game was played in AL parks. Even though the AL team had to play without their DH in NL parks, that left them with a starting player available to pinch-hit and/or come in as a substitute player later in the game, as opposed to a bench player on the NL team. Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig once proposed that the road team&#x27;s rules should be followed for interleague games in order to combat this home team advantage, but the idea never received traction.

The decline of pitcher Chien-Ming Wang due to an interleague game injury has been cited in support of the designated hitter. On June 15, 2008, Wang, at the time one of the New York Yankees&#x27; best pitchers, was taken out of an interleague game versus the Houston Astros due to a right foot injury he sustained while running the bases, something he was not used to doing, since pitchers do not bat in the American League. Wang was diagnosed with a torn Lisfranc ligament and a partial tear of the peroneus longus of the right foot. The cast was removed on July 29, but the extensive rehabilitation process prevented Wang from being an effective pitcher afterwards at the major league level. Yankees part-owner Hank Steinbrenner showed frustration with pitchers having to bat in the National League and suggested that the league &quot;join the modern age&quot;.

==Outside of Major League Baseball==
===Nippon Professional Baseball===
Japan&#x27;s Pacific League adopted the designated hitter in 1975, just two years after its adoption in the American League. Japan&#x27;s Central League has not adopted the designated hitter – the only top-level professional league in the world to refrain from doing so as of 2024. When teams from different leagues play against each other in the Japan Series or interleague games, the DH rule is adopted if the Pacific League&#x27;s team hosts the game, similar to the MLB rules before the universal DH.

===Mexican League===
The Mexican League introduced the designated hitter in 1974, one year after the American League.

===Winter league baseball===
The Cuban National Series adopted the designated hitter in 1977.

===Minor League Baseball===
The DH is used for all Minor League Baseball (MiLB) games. Prior to the adoption of the DH by the National League in 2022, only Rookie and Single-A level leagues used the DH rule in all games, while Double-A and Triple-A games, when both teams were National League affiliates the designated hitter was not used. The reason for the difference was that as players get closer to reaching the majors, teams preferred to have the rules mimic those of the major league teams for which the players may soon be playing.

The Atlantic League, an independent minor league that became an MLB Partner League after the 2021 MiLB reorganization, implemented an experimental &quot;double-hook rule&quot; for its 2021 season. Under this rule, once a team removes its starting pitcher it loses the right to use a DH for the rest of the game. The &quot;double hook&quot; rule was modified for the 2022 Atlantic League season. The change allows a team whose starting pitcher who goes at least five innings to keep its DH.

===Amateur baseball===
In American high schools and other amateur baseball leagues that use National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) rules, a DH may bat in place of one player in any position, not just a pitcher. Many coaches use a designated hitter in place of the weakest hitter in the lineup, if they use one at all. In amateur baseball, many pitchers are also good hitters and will often play another position (or even DH) when not pitching.

In 2020, NFHS rules were modified to also add a &quot;Player/DH&quot; rule where a player may start the game with offensive and defensive roles, and be substituted out only on defense while remaining in the game on offense as a DH.

Japanese high school baseball is one of the few amateur baseball leagues in the world that has never used the designated hitter rule at all. In high school baseball in South Korea, the rule has been adopted since 2004. American Legion rules, on the other hand, allow the DH only to bat for the pitcher; prior to 1995, the use of the DH was not allowed in Legion baseball at all.

In college baseball, NCAA rules state that the designated hitter must hit for the pitcher, but in many instances the pitcher is also a good hitter, and the coach may elect to let the pitcher bat in the lineup. If the pitcher opts to bat for himself, he is treated as two separate positions – a pitcher and a designated hitter (abbreviated P/DH on the lineup card) – and may be substituted for as such (i.e. if he is removed as the pitcher, he may remain as the designated hitter and vice versa). However, if a player who starts a game as a P/DH is relieved as the starting pitcher, he may not return to the mound even if he remains in the game as the DH, and he may not play any other defensive position after being relieved as the pitcher unless he immediately moves to another defensive position, in which case the new pitcher must assume the spot in the batting order of the fielder the P/DH substituted for, and the DH is lost for the remainder of the game. Conversely, a player who begins the game as the DH, but not as the pitcher, may come into the game as a reliever and remain as the DH (in effect becoming a P/DH), be relieved on the mound later in the game but continue to bat as the DH.

In Little League Baseball, the DH is not used except in the Senior League (age 15–16) division, where the DH can bat in place of any defensive player. However, a league may adopt a rule which requires all players present and able to play to be listed in the batting order (such that the order contains more than nine players), and thus all players will have a turn to bat even when they are not assigned a fielding position. Players in the batting lineup without a position on the field are given the position designation &quot;extra hitter&quot; (EH), a position seen occasionally in other amateur organizations (both youth and adult) - and integrated as the &quot;10th man&quot; of Savannah Bananas exhibition ballgames since 2020 as part of the lineup alongside the DH.

<text>Levi Strauss ( ; born Löb Strauß, ; February 26, 1829 – September 26, 1902) was a German-born American businessman who founded the first company to manufacture blue jeans. His firm of Levi Strauss &amp; Co. (Levi&#x27;s) began in 1853 in San Francisco, California.

==Early life==
Levi Strauss was born to a Jewish family in Buttenheim on February 26, 1829, in the Franconia region of the Kingdom of Bavaria in the German Confederation. He was the son of Hirsch Strauss and Hirsch’s second wife, Rebecca Strauss (née Haas).

In 1847, aged 18, Strauss travelled with his mother and two sisters to the United States to join his brothers Jonas and Louis, who had begun a wholesale dry goods business in New York City called J. Strauss Brother &amp; Co., at 108 Liberty Street in Manhattan. After arriving in New York, Strauss worked as an itinerant peddler of goods from his brother&#x27;s store: kettles, blankets and sewing goods.

==Business career==
Levi&#x27;s sister Fanny and her husband David Stern moved to St. Louis, Missouri, while Levi went to live in Louisville, Kentucky, and sold his brothers&#x27; supplies there. Levi became an American citizen in January 1853.

The family decided to open a West Coast branch of their dry goods business in San Francisco, which was the commercial hub of the California gold rush. Levi was chosen to represent them, and he took steamships for San Francisco via Panama, where he arrived in early March 1854 and joined his sister&#x27;s family.

Strauss opened his wholesale business as Levi Strauss &amp; Co. and imported fine dry goods from his brothers in New York, including clothing, bedding, combs, purses, and handkerchiefs. He made tents and later jeans while he lived with Fanny&#x27;s growing family. Tailor Jacob W. Davis of Reno, Nevada, was one of his customers; in 1871, having invented a way to strengthen work pants using rivets, he went into business with Strauss to mass produce them. The next year, Davis asked Strauss to help him apply for a patent, and the patent (one-half assigned to Levi Strauss &amp; Co.) was issued in 1873.

==Death==
Levi Strauss was never married, and died on September 26, 1902 in San Francisco. His estate was worth about $30 million (equivalent to $ in ). Levi&#x27;s nephew Sigmund Stern&#x27;s only child, Elise Fanny Stern, married Walter A. Haas, the son of Abraham Haas, whose descendants are the current owners of Levi Strauss &amp; Co.

==Legacy==
Levi Strauss, a member of the Reform branch of Judaism, helped establish Congregation Emanu-El, the first Jewish synagogue in the city of San Francisco. He also gave money to several charities, including special funds for orphans. The Levi Strauss Foundation started with an 1897 donation to the University of California, Berkeley, that provided the funds for 28 scholarships.

The Levi Strauss museum in Buttenheim, Germany is located in the 1687 house where Strauss was born. There is also a visitors center at Levi Strauss &amp; Co. headquarters in San Francisco, which features historical exhibits.

In 1994, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

<text>Ezra Cornell (; January 11, 1807 – December 9, 1874) was an American businessman, politician, academic, and philanthropist. He was the founder of Western Union and a co-founder of Cornell University. He also served as president of the New York Agriculture Society and as a New York State Senator.

==Early life==
Cornell was born in Westchester Landing at what is now 1515 Williamsbridge Road in The Bronx in New York City to Elijah Cornell and Eunice (Barnard), a potter. He was raised near DeRuyter, New York. He was a cousin of Paul Cornell, the founder of Chicago&#x27;s Hyde Park neighborhood. He was also related to Ezekiel Cornell, a Revolutionary War general who represented Rhode Island in the Second Continental Congress from 1780 to 1782, and was a distant relative of William Cornell, who was an early settler from Rhode Island.

Cornell&#x27;s earliest American patrilineal ancestor, Thomas Cornell (1595–1655), was a Puritan and a follower of Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson before finally embracing Quakerism, the faith of his descendants.

==Career==
Cornell initially pursued a career in carpentry and traveled extensively throughout New York State in the profession. Upon first setting eyes on Cayuga Lake and Ithaca, New York in the spring of 1828, he decided that Ithaca would be his future home.

Cornell was hired as a mechanic by Otis Eddy to work at his cotton mill on Cascadilla Creek. On Eddy&#x27;s recommendation, Jeremiah S. Beebe then hired Cornell to repair and overhaul his plaster and flour mills on Fall Creek. During Cornell&#x27;s long association with Beebe, he designed and built a tunnel for a new mill race on Fall Creek, a stone dam on Fall Creek (which formed Beebe Lake), and a new flour mill. By 1832, Cornell was placed in charge of all Beebe&#x27;s concerns at Fall Creek.

In 1831, Cornell married Mary Ann Wood in Dryden, New York. The young and growing family needed more income than he could earn as manager of Beebe&#x27;s mills, so Cornell purchased rights in a patent for a new type of plow and began decades of traveling away from Ithaca. His territories for sales of the plow included the states of Maine and Georgia. He sold in Maine in the summer and the milder Georgia in the winter.

===Telegraph===
In 1842, Cornell happened into the offices of the &quot;Maine Farmer&quot;, where he saw an acquaintance, F.O.J. Smith, bent over some plans for a &quot;scraper&quot; as Smith called it. For services rendered, Smith had been granted a one-quarter share of the telegraph patent held by Samuel Morse, and was attempting to devise a way of burying the telegraph lines in the ground in lead pipe. Cornell devised a special kind of plow that would dig a ditch, lay the pipe and telegraph wire in the ditch, and cover it back up. It was later learned that condensation in the pipes and poor insulation of the wires impeded the electric current on the wires, so hanging the wire from telegraph poles became the accepted method.

Cornell made his fortune in the telegraph business as an associate of Samuel Morse. Cornell constructed and strung the poles for the Baltimore–Washington telegraph line, the first telegraph line of substance in the U.S. To address the problem of telegraph lines shorting out, Cornell invented using glass insulators at the point where telegraph lines are connected to supporting poles. After joining with Morse, Cornell supervised the development of many telegraph lines, including a portion of the New York, Albany &amp; Buffalo line in 1846 and the Erie and Michigan Telegraph Company, which connected Buffalo to Milwaukee along with his partners John James Speed and Francis Ormand Jonathan Smith. Cornell, Speed, and Smith also built the New York and Erie line, which competed with and paralleled the New York, Albany and Buffalo line in which Morse had a major share. The line was completed in 1849 and Cornell was made president of the company.

In 1848, Cornell&#x27;s sister, Phoebe, married Martin B. Wood and moved to Albion, Michigan. Cornell gave Wood a job constructing new lines and made Phoebe his telegraph operator, the first woman operator in the U.S. Cornell earned a substantial fortune when the Erie and Michigan line was consolidated with Hiram Sibley and his New York and Mississippi Company formed the Western Union company. Cornell received $2 million in Western Union stock.

===New York State Assembly===
Cornell was a Republican member of the New York State Assembly representing Tompkins County in 1862 and 1863 and a member of the New York State Senate from 1864 to 1867, where he served in the 87th, 88th, 89th, and 90th New York State Legislatures.

===Cornell Free Library===

Cornell retired from Western Union and turned his attention to philanthropy. He endowed the Cornell Free Library, the first public library for the citizens of Ithaca. The library was incorporated on April 5, 1864, and was formally presented to the town on December 20, 1866. The original library building stood at the corner of Tioga and Seneca street until it was demolished in 1960. The library evolved over time to serve the county as the Tompkins County Public Library.

To honor the 150th anniversary of his gift, a mural of Ezra Cornell was hung on the exterior wall of the current Tompkins County Public Library in October, 2016.

===Cornell University founder===

A lifelong enthusiast of science and agriculture, he saw great opportunity in the 1862 Morrill Land-Grant Acts to found a university that would teach practical subjects on an equal basis with the classics favored by more traditional institutions. Andrew Dickson White helped secure the new institution&#x27;s status as New York&#x27;s land-grant university, and Cornell University was founded and granted a charter through their efforts in 1865.

Cornell University derived far greater revenues than earlier land grant colleges, largely from real estate transactions directed by Ezra Cornell. Under the land-grant program, the federal government issued the colleges scrip, documents granting the right to select a parcel of land. These colleges generally promptly sold their scrip. Ezra Cornell, however, held most of the scrip, anticipating it would increase in price. He also redeemed some scrip for promising land or for rights in timber, including pine forest in Wisconsin. While the first land-grant colleges received around half a dollar per acre, Cornell netted an average of over $5 per acre in 1905. Because of these timber holdings, the town of Cornell, Wisconsin, is named for Cornell.

===Railroad business and letter writing===

Cornell entered the railroad business, but fared poorly due to the Panic of 1873. He began construction of a palatial Ithaca mansion, Llenroc, whose name was Cornell spelled in reverse, to replace his farmhouse, but died before it was completed. Llenroc was maintained by Cornell&#x27;s heirs for several decades until being sold to Cornell University&#x27;s chapter of the Delta Phi fraternity, which occupies it to this day; Forest Park, Cornell&#x27;s farmhouse, was sold to Cornell University&#x27;s Delta Tau Delta fraternity chapter but was later demolished.

A prolific letter writer, Cornell corresponded with a great many people and would write dozens of letters each week. This was due partly to his wide traveling and also to the many business associates he maintained during his years as an entrepreneur and later as a politician and university founder. Cornell University has made the approximately 30,000 letters in the Cornell Correspondence available online.

==Personal life==

Ezra Cornell was a birthright Quaker, but was later disowned by the Society of Friends for marrying outside the faith to a &quot;world&#x27;s woman&quot;, Mary Ann Wood, a Methodist, on March 19, 1831.

On February 24, 1832, Cornell wrote the following response to his expulsion from The Society of Friends due to his marriage: &quot;I have always considered that choosing a companion for life was a very important affair and that my happiness or misery in this life depended on the choice.&quot;

He died in 1874. Cornell is interred in Sage Chapel on Cornell&#x27;s campus along with Daniel Willard Fiske and Jennie McGraw. Cornell was originally laid to rest in Ithaca City Cemetery in Ithaca and later then moved to Sage Chapel.

His eldest son, Alonzo B. Cornell, was later governor of New York. Since its founding, the university&#x27;s charter specified that the eldest lineal descendant of Cornell is granted a life seat on Cornell University&#x27;s board of trustees, currently Charles Ezra Cornell. (Charles Ezra Cornell took the post on November 17, 1969.)

In 1990, G. David Low, graduate of Cornell University and Space Shuttle astronaut, took with him into outer space a pair of tan silk socks worn by Ezra Cornell on his wedding day in 1831.

<text>August Paul von Wassermann (21 February 1866 – 16 March 1925) was a German bacteriologist and hygienist.

Born in Bamberg, with Jewish origins, he studied at several universities throughout Germany, receiving his medical doctorate in 1888 from the University of Strassburg. In 1890 he began work under Robert Koch at the Institute for Infectious Diseases in Berlin. In 1906 he became director of the division for experimental therapy and serum research at the institute, followed by a directorship of the department of experimental therapy at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft for the Advancement of Science in Berlin-Dahlem (1913).

Wassermann developed a complement fixation test for the diagnosis of syphilis in 1906, just one year after the causative organism, &quot;Spirochaeta pallida&quot;, had been identified by Fritz Schaudinn and Erich Hoffmann. The so-called &quot;Wassermann test&quot; allowed for early detection of the disease (despite its nonspecific symptoms), and thus prevention of transmission. He attributed the development of the test to earlier findings of Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou (complement fixation reaction) and to a hypothesis introduced by Paul Ehrlich in his interpretation of antibody formation.

The Wassermann test remains a staple of syphilis detection and prevention in some areas, although it has often been replaced by more modern alternatives. With Wilhelm Kolle, he published the six-volume &quot;Handbuch der Pathogenen Mikroorganismen&quot; (Handbook of Pathogenic Microorganisms).

He was the first recipient of the Aronson Prize in 1921.

<text>Raymond Bonner is an American lawyer, journalist, author and bookstore owner. He has been a staff writer at &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and has contributed to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. He received an Emmy for a documentary he produced with Alex Gibney about the CIA&#x27;s torture program for 9/11 suspects. He is an owner of a bookstore, Bookoccino, in Sydney, Australia.

==Early life==
Bonner grew up in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, graduating from St. Louis Park High School in 1960. He earned a J.D. degree from Stanford University Law School in 1967. In 1968 he joined the U.S. Marine Corps, was a Judge Advocate, including a tour in Vietnam. Before taking up journalism, Bonner worked as a staff attorney with Ralph Nader&#x27;s Public Citizen Litigation Group; was the founder and director of the West Coast advocacy office of Consumers Union; and director of the consumer fraud/white collar crime unit of the San Francisco District Attorney&#x27;s office. 

==Legal career==
Prior to his career in journalism, Bonner worked as an attorney with the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the Consumers Union (establishing its West Coast Advocacy office), and as head of the white collar crime division of the San Francisco District Attorney&#x27;s Office.

He taught at the University of California, Davis School of Law. He was a founder, along with Trin Ostrander, of the Public Interest Clearing House at Hastings College of Law, which is today One Justice, the state-wide organization providing legal services to the rural poor.

==Journalism career==

===Reporting on El Salvador===
Bonner is best known as one of two journalists (the other being Alma Guillermoprieto of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;) who broke the story of the El Mozote massacre, in which some 900 villagers, mostly women, children and elderly, at El Mozote, El Salvador, were slaughtered by the Atlácatl Battalion, a unit of the Salvadoran army in December 1981. A &quot;New York Times&quot; staff reporter at the time, Bonner was smuggled by Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) rebels to visit the site approximately a month after the massacre took place.

When the &quot;Post&quot; and &quot;Times&quot; simultaneously broke the story on January 27, 1982, the US government and its allies at the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal dismissed its central claims as exaggerations. This whitewashing effort was initiated because Bonner&#x27;s report seriously undermined efforts by the Reagan administration to bolster the human rights image of the right-wing Salvadoran regime, which the US government was supporting with large amounts of military aid in an effort to destroy the FMLN. The Atlacatl Battalion that perpetrated the massacre was an elite Salvadoran army unit that had been trained in the US at US military bases, and armed and directed by US military advisors operating in El Salvador. This was part of a larger US effort to conceal from the public the human rights abuses of the Salvadoran regime and its role in supporting it. As a result of the controversy, escalated by the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, the &quot;New York Times&quot; removed Bonner from covering El Salvador and assigned him to the financial desk, and he eventually resigned. Also as a result of the controversy, according to journalists like Anthony Lewis and Michael Massing writing in the Columbia Journalism Review, &quot;other newspapers worried about looking soft on Communism and toned down their reporting from El Salvador.&quot; A forensic investigation of the massacre site years later confirmed the accuracy of his reporting.
Bonner revisited El Mozote in 20, the subject of a documentary with RetroReport and Frontline. ..As Massacre Survivors Seek Justice, El Salvador Grapples With 1,000 Ghosts, by Retro Report https://www.retroreport.org/video/as-massacre-survivors-seek-justice-el-salvador-grapples-with-1-000-ghosts

===Later work as journalist===
Starting years later, Bonner has written on contract for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, covering the Rwanda genocide, the Bosnian War, and the two terrorist bombings in Bali, Indonesia. He was also a staff writer at &quot;The New Yorker&quot; from 1988 to 1992, writing from Peru, Sudan, Indonesia, Kuwait, and Kurdistan. From 1988 to 2007, Bonner lived in Nairobi and then Warsaw, Vienna, and Jakarta.

Since 2007, he has written book reviews, principally about international security, for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;The Australian&quot;, &quot;The National Interest&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. He has also been a regular contributor to ProPublica and the atlantic.com
In 2018, Bonner purchased a Bookoccino, a bookstore in Avalon Beach, Australia, about an hour north of Sydney, which was on the verge of closing. He was joined in the venture by Sally Tabner, a local bibliophile. Under their ownership, Bookoccino has become a favourite coffee shop for the community, and drawing international lovers of books and ideas. Its events have become legendary, attracting some of the biggest names in literature, politics, and journalism, along with public intellectuals -- Geoffrey Robertson; Richard Flanagan; Geraldine Brooks; Lionel Shriver; Julia Baird; Richard Fidler; Ben Quilty; Leigh Sales; Mike Cannon-Brookes; Jill Abramson; David Sanger; Kathy Lette; Kate Legge; Samantha Power; Richard McGregor; Hugh White. (www.bookoccino.com.au)

===Illegal surveillance by FBI===
In 2008 the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that Bonner had been one of the four journalists whose telephone call records had been illegally obtained by the FBI between 2002 and 2006. During that time Bonner had been based in Jakarta, Indonesia, filing reports on detainee abuse and illegal surveillance.

==Pro bono work==
Bonner is the co-founder of OneJustice (formerly Public Interest Clearinghouse), an organization that expands the availability of legal services for Californians in need through innovative partnerships with nonprofits, law schools, and the private sector.

<text>The rapid plasma reagin test (RPR test or RPR titer) is a type of rapid diagnostic test that looks for non-specific antibodies in the blood of the patient that may indicate an infection by syphilis or related non-venereal treponematoses. It is one of several nontreponemal tests for syphilis (along with the Wassermann test and the VDRL test). The term &quot;reagin&quot; means that this test does not look for antibodies against the bacterium itself, &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot;, but rather for antibodies against substances released by cells when they are damaged by &quot;T. pallidum&quot; (cardiolipin and lecithin). Traditionally, syphilis serologic testing has been performed using a nontreponemal test (NTT) such as the RPR or VDRL test, with positive results then confirmed using a specific treponemal test (TT) such as TPPA or FTA-ABS. This method is endorsed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and is the standard in many parts of the world. After screening for syphilis, a titer can be used to track the progress of the disease over time and its response to therapy.
==Accuracy==
The RPR test is an effective screening test that is very good at detecting syphilis in people without symptoms. The NTT screening tests should always be followed up by a more specific treponemal test. Tests based on monoclonal antibodies and immunofluorescence, including &quot;T. pallidum&quot; hemagglutination assay (TPHA) and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) are more specific and more expensive. Nontreponemal tests (NTT) measure levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies produced by the host in response to lipoidal material (mostly cardiolipin) released from damaged host cells. It is also generally believed that some cardiolipin is released by the spirochetes.

==Alternatives==
Another test often used to screen for syphilis is the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) slide test. However, the RPR test is generally preferred due to its ease of use. Other types of tests are being evaluated as possible alternatives to standard manual RPR testing. One of these alternatives is a fully automated RPR syphilis analyzer. It also returns positive for other, non-venereal treponematoses. It has been recommended that a careful explanation of this fact be included with test results.

<text>The Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL) is a blood test for syphilis and related non-venereal treponematoses that was developed by the eponymous US laboratory. The VDRL test is used to screen for syphilis (it has high sensitivity), whereas other, more specific tests are used to diagnose the disease.

==History==
The VDRL type test was invented before World War I, with its first iteration being that developed by August Paul von Wasserman with the aid of Albert Neisser in 1906. The VDRL test, as it is largely still done today, was developed in 1946 by Harris, Rosenberg, and Riedel. The lab was renamed to the Treponemal Pathogenesis and Immunology Branch of the United States Public Health Service.

==Mechanism==
The VDRL is a nontreponemal serological screening for syphilis that is also used to assess response to therapy, to detect central nervous system involvement, and as an aid in the diagnosis of congenital syphilis. The basis of the test is that an antibody produced by a patient with syphilis reacts with an extract of ox heart (diphosphatidyl glycerol). It therefore detects anti-cardiolipin antibodies (IgG, IgM or IgA), visualized through foaming of the test tube fluid, or &quot;flocculation&quot;.

The rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test uses the same antigen as the VDRL, but in that test, it has been bound to several other molecules, including a carbon particle to allow visualization of the flocculation reaction without the need of a microscope. Many other medical conditions can produce false positive results, including some viruses (mononucleosis, hepatitis), drugs, pregnancy, rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and leprosy.

The syphilis anti-cardiolipin antibodies are beta-2 glycoprotein independent, whereas those that occur in antiphospholipid syndrome (associated to lupus for example) are beta-2 glycoprotein dependent, and this can be used to tell them apart in an ELISA assay. This test is very useful as the trend of titres are correlated to disease activity (i.e. falling titres indicate successful treatment). It has a very good sensitivity for syphilis, except in late tertiary form.

==Other tests==

There are a number of treponemal-specific tests such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption (FTA-ABS) test, &quot;T. pallidum&quot; hemagglutination assays (TPHA), and the microhemagglutination assay (MHA-TP).

The MHA-TP is used to confirm a syphilis infection after another method tests positive for the syphilis bacteria. The MHA-TP test detects antibodies to the bacteria that cause syphilis and can be used to detect syphilis in all stages, except during the first 3 to 4 weeks. This test is not done on spinal fluid. The MHA-TP test is rarely used any more. Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TP-PA) and the Toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST), which may be used to confirm a positive VDRL result, are more specific for syphilis than non-treponemal tests and in the presence of a positive test, more likely indicate active infection. Unfortunately, other treponemal infections such as yaws, bejel, and pinta and possibly nonpathogenic commensal treponemes can result in a positive. Not all these disease are venereal; it has been recommended that a careful explanation of this fact be included with test results.

<doc id="347322" wikidata="Q1061403" url="?curid=347322" title="Holotype">
<text>A holotype (Latin: &quot;holotypus&quot;) is a single physical example (or illustration) of an organism used when the species (or lower-ranked taxon) was formally described. It is either the single such physical example (or illustration) or one of several examples, but explicitly designated as the holotype. Under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), a holotype is one of several kinds of name-bearing types. In the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and ICZN, the definitions of types are similar in intent but not identical in terminology or underlying concept.

For example, the holotype for the butterfly &quot;Plebejus idas longinus&quot; is a preserved specimen of that subspecies, held by the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. In botany and mycology, an isotype is a duplicate of the holotype, generally pieces from the same individual plant or samples from the same genetic individual.

A holotype is not necessarily &quot;typical&quot; of that taxon, although ideally it is. Sometimes just a fragment of an organism is the holotype, particularly in the case of a fossil. For example, the holotype of &quot;Pelorosaurus humerocristatus&quot; (Duriatitan), a large herbivorous dinosaur from the early Cretaceous period, is a fossil leg bone stored at the Natural History Museum in London. Even if a better specimen is subsequently found, the holotype is not superseded.

==Replacements for holotypes==
Under the ICN, an additional and clarifying type could be designated an &quot;epitype&quot; under article 9.8, where the original material is demonstrably ambiguous or insufficient.

A &quot;conserved type&quot; (ICN article 14.3) is sometimes used to correct a problem with a name which has been misapplied; this specimen replaces the original holotype.

In the absence of a holotype, another type may be selected, out of a range of different kinds of type, depending on the case, a lectotype or a neotype.

For example, in both the ICN and the ICZN a neotype is a type that was later appointed in the absence of the original holotype. Additionally, under the ICZN the commission is empowered to replace a holotype with a neotype, when the holotype turns out to lack important diagnostic features needed to distinguish the species from its close relatives. For example, the crocodile-like archosaurian reptile &quot;Parasuchus hislopi&quot; Lydekker, 1885 was described based on a premaxillary rostrum (part of the snout), but this is no longer sufficient to distinguish &quot;Parasuchus&quot; from its close relatives. This made the name &quot;Parasuchus hislopi&quot; a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;. Indian-American paleontologist Sankar Chatterjee proposed that a new type specimen, a complete skeleton, be designated. The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature considered the case and agreed to replace the original type specimen with the proposed neotype.

The procedures for the designation of a new type specimen when the original is lost come into play for some recent, high-profile species descriptions in which the specimen designated as the holotype was a living individual that was allowed to remain in the wild (e.g. a new species of capuchin monkey, genus &quot;Cebus&quot;, the bee species &quot;Marleyimyia xylocopae&quot;, or the Arunachal macaque &quot;Macaca munzala&quot;). In such a case, there is no actual type specimen available for study, and the possibility exists that—should there be any perceived ambiguity in the identity of the species—subsequent authors can invoke various clauses in the ICZN Code that allow for the designation of a neotype. Article 75.3.7 of the ICZN requires that the designation of a neotype must be accompanied by &quot;a statement that the neotype is, or immediately upon publication has become, the property of a recognized scientific or educational institution, cited by name, that maintains a research collection, with proper facilities for preserving name-bearing types, and that makes them accessible for study&quot;, but there is no such requirement for a holotype.

<text>Genderblind, also known as CG6070, is a gene that was discovered in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; by University of Illinois at Chicago researcher David Featherstone. The gene encodes a member of the cystine/glutamate transporter family of proteins.

Genderblind protein is expressed in glial cells where it secretes the neurotransmitter glutamate and regulates the organization of glutamate receptors.

A mutation in Genderblind alters the sexual behavior of &quot;Drosophila&quot;, turning the flies bisexual. &quot;Drosophila&quot; given drugs to alter synapse strength, independent of the Genderblind mutation, allowed researchers to &quot;turn fly homosexuality on and off, within hours&quot;. The researchers believe this effect is due to the flies&#x27; altered response to pheromones.

<text>Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), was a landmark civil rights decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that ruled that laws banning interracial marriage violate the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Beginning in 2013, the decision was cited as precedent in U.S. federal court decisions ruling that restrictions on same-sex marriage in the United States were unconstitutional, including in the Supreme Court decision &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; (2015).

The case involved Richard Loving, a white man, and his wife Mildred Loving, a person of color. In 1959, the Lovings were convicted of violating Virginia&#x27;s Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which criminalized marriage between people classified as &quot;white&quot; and people classified as &quot;colored&quot;. Caroline County circuit court judge Leon M. Bazile sentenced them to prison but suspended the sentence on the condition that they leave Virginia and not return. The Lovings filed a motion to vacate their convictions on the ground that the Racial Integrity Act was unconstitutional, but Bazile denied it. After unsuccessfully appealing to the Supreme Court of Virginia, the Lovings appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear their case. 

In June 1967, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision in the Lovings&#x27; favor that overturned their convictions and struck down Virginia&#x27;s Racial Integrity Act. Virginia had argued before the Court that its law was not a violation of the Equal Protection Clause because the punishment was the same regardless of the offender&#x27;s race, and therefore it &quot;equally burdened&quot; both whites and non-whites. The Court found that the law nonetheless violated the Equal Protection Clause because it was based solely on &quot;distinctions drawn according to race&quot; and outlawed conduct—namely, that of getting married—that was otherwise generally accepted and that citizens were free to do. The Court&#x27;s decision ended all race-based legal restrictions on marriage in the United States.

==Background==
===Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States===
Anti-miscegenation laws had been in place in certain states since the colonial period. During the Reconstruction era in 1865, the Black Codes across the seven states of the lower South made interracial marriage illegal. The new Republican legislatures in six states repealed the restrictive laws. By 1894, when the Democratic Party in the South returned to power, restrictions were reimposed.

A major concern was how to draw the line between black and white in a society in which white men had many children with enslaved black women. On the one hand, a person&#x27;s reputation as black or white was usually what mattered in practice. On the other hand, most laws used a &quot;one drop of blood&quot; rule, which meant that one black ancestor made a person black in the view of the law. In 1967, 16 states still retained anti-miscegenation laws, mainly in the American South.

=== Plaintiffs ===

Mildred Delores Loving was the daughter of Musial (Byrd) Jeter and Theoliver Jeter. She self-identified as Indian-Rappahannock, but was also reported as being of Cherokee, Portuguese, and black American ancestry. During the trial, it seemed clear that she identified herself as Black, and her lawyer claimed that was how she described herself to him. However, upon her arrest, the police report identified her as &quot;Indian&quot; and by 2004, she denied having any Black ancestry.

Richard Perry Loving was a white man, the son of Lola (Allen) Loving and Twillie Loving. Their families both lived in Caroline County, Virginia, which adhered to strict Jim Crow segregation laws, but their town of Central Point had been a visible mixed-race community since the 19th century. 

Mildred became pregnant, and in June 1958, the couple traveled to Washington, D.C. to marry, thereby evading Virginia&#x27;s Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which made marriage between whites and non-whites a crime. A few weeks after they returned to Central Point, local police raided their home in the early morning hours of July 11, 1958, hoping to find them having sex, given that interracial sex was then also illegal in Virginia. When the officers found the Lovings sleeping in their bed, Mildred pointed out their marriage certificate on the bedroom wall. They were told the certificate was not valid in Virginia.

==Criminal proceedings==
The Lovings were charged under Section 20-58 of the Virginia Code, which prohibited interracial couples from being married out of state and then returning to Virginia, and Section 20-59, which classified miscegenation as a felony, punishable by a prison sentence of between one and five years.

On January 6, 1959, the Lovings pleaded guilty to &quot;cohabiting as man and wife, against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth&quot;. They were sentenced to one year in prison, with the sentence suspended on condition that the couple leave Virginia and not return together for at least 25 years. After their conviction, the couple moved to the District of Columbia.

===Appellate proceedings===
In 1963, frustrated by their inability to travel together to visit their families in Virginia, as well as their social isolation and financial difficulties in Washington, Mildred Loving wrote in protest to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Kennedy referred her to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The ACLU assigned volunteer cooperating attorneys Bernard S. Cohen and Philip J. Hirschkop, who filed a motion on behalf of the Lovings in Virginia&#x27;s Caroline County Circuit Court, that requested the court to vacate the criminal judgments and set aside the Lovings&#x27; sentences on the grounds that the Virginia miscegenation statutes ran counter to the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause.

On October 28, 1964, after waiting almost a year for a response to their motion, the ACLU attorneys filed a federal class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. This prompted the county court judge in the case, Leon M. Bazile (1890–1967), to issue a ruling on the long-pending motion to vacate. Echoing Johann Friedrich Blumenbach&#x27;s 18th-century interpretation of race, Bazile denied the motion with the words:

On January 22, 1965, a three-judge district court panel postponed decision on the federal class-action case while the Lovings appealed Judge Bazile&#x27;s decision on constitutional grounds to the Virginia Supreme Court. On March 7, 1966, Justice Harry L. Carrico (later Chief Justice of the Court) wrote an opinion for the court upholding the constitutionality of the anti-miscegenation statutes. Carrico cited as authority the Virginia Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Naim v. Naim&quot; (1955) and ruled that criminalization of the Lovings&#x27; marriage was not a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, because both the white and the non-white spouse were punished equally for miscegenation, a line of reasoning that echoed that of the United States Supreme Court in 1883 in &quot;Pace v. Alabama&quot;. However, the court did find the Lovings&#x27; sentences to be unconstitutionally vague, ordering that they be resentenced in the Caroline County Circuit Court. 

The Lovings, still supported by the ACLU, appealed the state supreme court&#x27;s decision to the Supreme Court of the United States, where Virginia was represented by Robert McIlwaine of the state&#x27;s attorney general&#x27;s office. The Supreme Court agreed on December 12, 1966, to accept the case for final review. The Lovings did not attend the oral arguments in Washington, but one of their lawyers, Bernard S. Cohen, conveyed the personal message he had been given by Richard Loving: &quot;Mr. Cohen, tell the Court I love my wife, and it is just unfair that I can&#x27;t live with her in Virginia.&quot;

==Precedents==

Before &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot;, there had been several cases on the subject of interracial sexual relations. Within the state of Virginia, on October 3, 1878, in &quot;Kinney v. The Commonwealth&quot;, the Supreme Court of Virginia ruled that the marriage legalized in Washington, D.C. between Andrew Kinney, a black man, and Mahala Miller, a white woman, was &quot;invalid&quot; in Virginia. In the national case of &quot;Pace v. Alabama&quot; (1883), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the conviction of an Alabama couple for interracial sex, affirmed on appeal by the Alabama Supreme Court, did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Interracial marital sex was deemed a felony, whereas extramarital sex (&quot;adultery or fornication&quot;) was only a misdemeanor.

On appeal, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the criminalization of interracial sex was not a violation of the Equal Protection Clause because whites and non-whites were punished in equal measure for the offense of engaging in interracial sex. The court did not need to affirm the constitutionality of the ban on interracial marriage that was also part of Alabama&#x27;s anti-miscegenation law, since the plaintiff, Mr. Pace, had chosen not to appeal that section of the law. After &quot;Pace v. Alabama&quot;, the constitutionality of anti-miscegenation laws banning marriage and sex between whites and non-whites remained unchallenged until the 1920s.

In &quot;Kirby v. Kirby&quot; (1921), Joe R. Kirby asked the state of Arizona for an annulment of his marriage. He charged that his marriage was invalid because his wife was of &quot;negro&quot; descent, thus violating the state&#x27;s anti-miscegenation law. The Arizona Supreme Court judged Mayellen Kirby&#x27;s race by observing her physical characteristics and determined that she was of mixed race, therefore granting Joe R. Kirby&#x27;s annulment.

&quot;Roldan v. Los Angeles County&quot; (1933), 129 Cal. App. 267, 18 P.2d 706, was a 1930s court case in California confirming that the state&#x27;s anti-miscegenation laws at the time did not bar the marriage of a Filipino and a white person. However, the precedent lasted barely a week before the law was specifically amended to illegalize such marriages.

In the &quot;Monks&quot; case (&quot;Estate of Monks&quot;, 4. Civ. 2835, Records of California Court of Appeals, Fourth district), the Superior Court of San Diego County in 1939 decided to invalidate the marriage of Marie Antoinette and Allan Monks because she was deemed to have &quot;one eighth negro blood&quot;. The court case involved a legal challenge over the conflicting wills that had been left by the late Allan Monks; an old one in favor of a friend named Ida Lee, and a newer one in favor of his wife. Lee&#x27;s lawyers charged that the marriage of the Monkses, which had taken place in Arizona, was invalid under Arizona state law because Marie Antoinette was &quot;a Negro&quot; and Alan had been white. Despite conflicting testimony by various expert witnesses, the judge defined Marie Antoinette Monks&#x27; race by relying on the anatomical &quot;expertise&quot; of a surgeon. The judge ignored the arguments of an anthropologist and a biologist that it was impossible to tell a person&#x27;s race from physical characteristics.

Monks then challenged the Arizona anti-miscegenation law itself, taking her case to the California Court of Appeals, Fourth District. Monks&#x27; lawyers pointed out that the anti-miscegenation law effectively prohibited Monks as a mixed-race person from marrying anyone: &quot;As such, she is prohibited from marrying a negro or any descendant of a negro, a Mongolian or an Indian, a Malay or a Hindu, or any descendants of any of them. Likewise ... as a descendant of a negro she is prohibited from marrying a Caucasian or a descendant of a Caucasian.&quot; The Arizona anti-miscegenation statute thus prohibited Monks from contracting a valid marriage in Arizona and was therefore an unconstitutional constraint on her liberty. However, the court dismissed this argument as inapplicable, because the case presented involved not two mixed-race spouses but a mixed-race and a white spouse: &quot;Under the facts presented the appellant does not have the benefit of assailing the validity of the statute.&quot; Dismissing Monks&#x27; appeal in 1942, the United States Supreme Court refused to reopen the issue.

The turning point came with &quot;Perez v. Sharp&quot; (1948), also known as &quot;Perez v. Lippold&quot;. In &quot;Perez&quot;, the Supreme Court of California ruled that California&#x27;s ban on interracial marriage violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.

==Supreme Court decision==

On June 12, 1967, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous 9–0 decision in favor of the Lovings. The Court&#x27;s opinion was written by chief justice Earl Warren, and all the justices joined it. 

The Court first addressed whether Virginia&#x27;s Racial Integrity Act violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which reads: &quot;nor shall any State ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&quot; Virginia state officials had argued that the Act did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it &quot;equally burdened&quot; both whites and non-whites, reasoning that the punishment for violating the statute was the same regardless of the offender&#x27;s race; for example, a white person who married a black person was subject to the same penalties as a black person who married a white person. The Court had accepted this &quot;equal application&quot; argument 84 years earlier in its 1883 decision &quot;Pace v. Alabama&quot;, but it rejected the argument in &quot;Loving&quot;.

The Court said that because Virginia&#x27;s Racial Integrity Act used race as a basis to impose criminal culpability, the Equal Protection Clause required the Court to scrutinize strictly whether the Act was constitutional:

Applying its strict scrutiny standard of review, the Court concluded that the Racial Integrity Act and its restrictions had no purpose other than &quot;invidious racial discrimination&quot; designed to &quot;maintain White Supremacy&quot;. The Court therefore ruled that the Act violated the Equal Protection Clause:

The Court ended its opinion with a short section holding that Virginia&#x27;s Racial Integrity Act also violated the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Due Process Clause. The Court said that the freedom to marry is a fundamental constitutional right, and it held that depriving Americans of it on an arbitrary basis such as race was unconstitutional:

The Court ended by ordering that the Lovings&#x27; convictions be reversed.

==Effects==

===For interracial marriage===
Despite the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision, anti-miscegenation laws remained on the books in several states, although the decision had made them unenforceable. State judges in Alabama continued to enforce its anti-miscegenation statute until 1970, when the Nixon administration obtained a ruling from a U.S. District Court in &quot;United States v. Brittain&quot;. In 2000, Alabama became the last state to adapt its laws to the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision, when 60% of voters endorsed a constitutional amendment, Amendment 2, that removed anti-miscegenation language from the state constitution.

After &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot;, the number of interracial marriages continued to increase across the United States and in the South. In Georgia, for instance, the number of interracial marriages increased from 21 in 1967 to 115 in 1970. At the national level, 0.4% of marriages were interracial in 1960, 2.0% in 1980, 12% in 2013, and 16% in 2015, almost 50 years after &quot;Loving&quot;.

===For same-sex marriage===
&quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; was discussed in the context of the public debate about same-sex marriage in the United States.

In &quot;Hernandez v. Robles&quot; (2006), the majority opinion of the New York Court of Appeals—that state&#x27;s highest court—declined to rely on the &quot;Loving&quot; case when deciding whether a right to same-sex marriage existed, holding that &quot;the historical background of &quot;Loving&quot; is different from the history underlying this case.&quot; In the 2010 federal district court decision in &quot;Perry v. Schwarzenegger&quot;, overturning California&#x27;s Proposition 8 which restricted marriage to opposite-sex couples, Judge Vaughn R. Walker cited &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; to conclude that &quot;the [constitutional] right to marry protects an individual&#x27;s choice of marital partner regardless of gender&quot;. On narrower grounds, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.

In June 2007, on the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Loving&quot;, Mildred Loving issued a statement in support of same-sex marriage.

Up until 2014, five U.S. Courts of Appeals considered the constitutionality of state bans on same-sex marriage. In doing so they interpreted or used the &quot;Loving&quot; ruling differently:

*The Fourth and Tenth Circuits used &quot;Loving&quot; along with other cases like &quot;Zablocki v. Redhail&quot; and &quot;Turner v. Safley&quot; to demonstrate that the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized a &quot;fundamental right to marry&quot; that a state cannot restrict unless it meets the court&#x27;s &quot;heightened scrutiny&quot; standard. Using that standard, both courts struck down state bans on same-sex marriage.
*Two other courts of appeals, the Seventh and Ninth Circuits, struck down state bans on the basis of a different line of argument. Instead of &quot;fundamental rights&quot; analysis, they reviewed bans on same-sex marriage as discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The former cited &quot;Loving&quot; to demonstrate that the Supreme Court did not accept tradition as a justification for limiting access to marriage. The latter cited &quot;Loving&quot; as quoted in &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; on the question of federalism: &quot;state laws defining or regulating marriage, of course, must respect the constitutional rights of persons&quot;.
*The only Court of Appeals to uphold state bans on same-sex marriage, the Sixth Circuit, said that when the &quot;Loving&quot; decision discussed marriage it was referring only to marriage between persons of the opposite sex.

In &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; (2015), the Supreme Court invoked &quot;Loving&quot;, among other cases, as precedent for its holding that states are required to allow same-sex marriages under both the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. The court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Obergefell&quot; cited &quot;Loving&quot; nearly a dozen times, and was based on the same principles – equality and an unenumerated right to marriage. During oral argument, the eventual author of the majority opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy, noted that the ruling holding racial segregation unconstitutional and the ruling holding bans on interracial marriage unconstitutional (&quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; in 1954 and &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; in 1967, respectively) were made about 13 years apart, much like the ruling holding bans on same-sex sexual activity unconstitutional and the eventual ruling holding bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional (&quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; in 2015, respectively).

=== For abortion ===
&quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; is embedded in a long line of cases concerning personal liberty in the realm of privacy, since &quot;Roe&quot; was based on individual liberty cases concerning privacy like &quot;Meyer v. Nebraska&quot; (1923), &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; (1965), &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; (1967) and &quot;Eisenstadt v. Baird&quot; (1972) and became a foundation for individual liberty cases concerning privacy like &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; (2003) and &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; (2015).

&quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court upheld the right to have an abortion as established by the &quot;essential holding&quot; of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (1973) and issued as its &quot;key judgment&quot; the restoration of the undue burden standard when evaluating state-imposed restrictions on that right.

In &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, which overturns &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Casey&quot;, the dissenting opinion holds that the same reasoning would have led &quot;Loving&quot; to be decided differently as well. This is in part because in 2022, a plurality of the court (Gorsuch, Barrett, Alito, Thomas) now self-identifies as, and interprets using, originalism.

==Codification==
In 2022, Congress codified the Supreme Court&#x27;s decisions in &quot;Loving&quot; and &quot;Obergefell&quot; in federal law by passing the Respect for Marriage Act. This act requires the U.S. federal government and all U.S. states and territories (though not tribes) to recognize the validity of same-sex and interracial civil marriages in the United States.

==In popular culture==
In the United States, June 12, the date of the decision, has become known as Loving Day, an annual unofficial celebration of interracial marriages. In 2014, Mildred Loving was honored as one of the Library of Virginia&#x27;s &quot;Virginia Women in History&quot;. In 2017, the Virginia Department of Historic Resources dedicated a state historical marker, which tells the story of the Lovings, outside the Patrick Henry Building in Richmond – the former site of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals.

The story of the Lovings became the basis of several films:
* The first, &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Loving&quot; (1996), was written and directed by Richard Friedenberg and starred Lela Rochon, Timothy Hutton, and Ruby Dee. According to Mildred Loving, &quot;not much of it was very true. The only part of it right was I had three children.&quot; 
* Nancy Buirski&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Loving Story,&quot; premiered on HBO in February 2012 and won a Peabody Award that year.
* &quot;Loving&quot;, a dramatized telling of the story based on Buirski&#x27;s documentary, was released in 2016. It was directed by Jeff Nichols and starred Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton as the Lovings. Negga received an Academy Award nomination for her performance.
* A four-part film, &quot;The Loving Generation&quot;, premiered on Topic.com in February 2018. Directed and produced by Lacey Schwartz Delgado and Mehret Mandefro, it explores the lives of biracial children born after the &quot;Loving&quot; decision.

In music, Nanci Griffith&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;The Loving Kind&quot; is named for the Lovings and includes a song about them. Satirist Roy Zimmerman&#x27;s 2009 song &quot;The Summer of Loving&quot; is about the Lovings and their 1967 case. The title is a reference to the Summer of Love.

A 2015 novel by the French journalist Gilles Biassette, &quot;L&#x27;amour des Loving&quot; (&quot;The Love of the Lovings&quot;, ), recounts the life of the Lovings and their case. A photo-essay about the couple by Grey Villet, created just before the case, was republished in 2017.

<text>Theodora Kroeber ( ; ; March 24, 1897 – July 4, 1979) was an American writer and anthropologist, best known for her accounts of several Native Californian cultures. Born in Denver, Colorado, Kroeber grew up in the mining town of Telluride, and worked briefly as a nurse. She attended the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), for her undergraduate studies, graduating with a major in psychology in 1919, and received a master&#x27;s degree from the same institution in 1920.

Married in 1920 and widowed in 1923, she began doctoral studies in anthropology at UC Berkeley. She met anthropologist Alfred Louis Kroeber during her studies, and married him in 1926. One of her two children with Kroeber was the writer Ursula K. Le Guin. The Kroebers traveled together to many of Alfred&#x27;s field sites, including an archaeological dig in Peru, where Theodora worked cataloging specimens. On their return, Alfred encouraged Theodora to continue her graduate work, but she declined, feeling she had too many responsibilities.

Kroeber began writing professionally late in her life, after her children had grown up. She published &quot;The Inland Whale&quot;, a collection of translated Native Californian narratives in 1959. Two years later she published &quot;Ishi in Two Worlds&quot;, an account of Ishi, the last member of the Yahi people of Northern California, whom Alfred Kroeber had befriended and studied between 1911 and 1916. This volume sold widely and received high praise from contemporary reviewers. Retrospective reviews were more mixed, noting Kroeber&#x27;s unflinching portrayal of Californian colonization but criticizing her perspective on Ishi&#x27;s treatment.

Nine years after Alfred&#x27;s death in 1960, Theodora Kroeber married artist John Quinn. Kroeber published several other works in her later years, including a collaboration with her daughter Ursula and a biography of Alfred Kroeber. She served as a regent of the University of California for a year before her death in 1979. She has been described as having influenced her husband&#x27;s anthropological work, and as having inspired interest in indigenous culture through &quot;Ishi in Two Worlds&quot;. A 1989 biography stated that her &quot;great strength was as an interpreter of one culture to another&quot;.

==Early life, education, and first marriage==
Theodora Covel Kracaw was born on March 24, 1897, in Denver, Colorado, and lived there for her first four years. She grew up in the mining town of Telluride, where her parents, Phebe Jane (née Johnston) and Charles Emmett Kracaw, owned a general store. Charles&#x27;s family were recent Polish migrants and Phebe had grown up in Wyoming. Theodora was the youngest of three Kracaw children; she had two brothers, five and ten years older than she was. All the children attended schools in Telluride. Theodora&#x27;s brothers became physicians. Theodora, who described herself as a shy and introverted person, said her childhood was happy. Her family name &quot;Kracaw&quot; led to her being nicknamed &quot;Krakie&quot; by her friends.

Kracaw graduated in 1915 as the valedictorian of her class at Telluride High School. After graduation, she worked as a volunteer nurse at Hadley Hospital in Colorado. In the same year, the family left Colorado and moved to Orland, California, since the lower altitude there was expected to benefit her father&#x27;s health, although it failed to do so. Kracaw enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), in 1915. She considered majoring in economics or English literature before deciding on psychology. She made lifelong friends during her undergraduate years, including Jean Macfarlane, whose interest in psychology drove Kracaw to select that discipline for her major. She graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1919 with a BA in psychology and began graduate study at UC Berkeley. Her master&#x27;s thesis studied ten families in San Francisco whose children were involved with a juvenile court. She volunteered as a probation officer and was required to meet and report on the families she was studying. She later wrote that she struggled to be objective in writing about these families. Kracaw received her master&#x27;s degree in clinical psychology in 1920.

In the summer of 1920, Kracaw married Clifton Spencer Brown, who was at UC Berkeley for graduate studies in law. Brown was contending with the effects of pneumonia he had contracted in France during World War I. They had two children, Clifton II and Theodore. The couple were visiting in Santa Fe when their home was lost in the 1923 Berkeley fire. Clifton left to return to Berkeley, but died en route in Denver in October 1923. Theodora and the children made their way back to Berkeley and the home of Brown&#x27;s widowed mother, who encouraged her to return to graduate school. While in Santa Fe, she had developed an interest in Native American art and culture, and she decided to study anthropology at UC Berkeley.

==Anthropological career and second marriage==
Theodora re-entered university in 1924. Having chosen to study anthropology, she consulted Alfred Kroeber, a leading American anthropologist of his generation and the head of the UC Berkeley anthropology department. Although she had previously taken classes from Alfred&#x27;s assistant Thomas Waterman, this was the first time Theodora met Alfred. At the time, anthropology was a new field and although women were admitted to help bolster class sizes to legitimize course offerings, they were resented. Male colleagues worried that women would be competition for the limited employment posts or research grants and lower the prestige of the profession. Thus, it became typical for women to be recruited, but their training and employment opportunities thereafter were restricted. During a seminar class Theodora took with Alfred, she and Julian Steward were assigned to evaluate Native American sport activities. She also took a course on symbolism with Robert Lowie.

Theodora and Alfred married on March 26, 1926. Steward, then also a graduate student at UC Berkeley, wrote that the marriage surprised their colleagues. Alfred, 21 years older than Theodora, had also been previously married; his wife had died of tuberculosis in 1913. Alfred adopted Theodora&#x27;s two sons, giving them his last name. The couple had two more children together: Karl and Ursula. Karl, Clifton, and Theodore later became professors, of English, history, and psychology, respectively, and Ursula became a well-known author under her married name Ursula K. Le Guin. In June 1926, the Kroebers left their children with Theodora&#x27;s mother and went on an eight-month field trip to an archaeological dig in Peru&#x27;s Nazca valley. It was Theodora&#x27;s first visit to an archaeological site; she also had not previously lived on a campsite. While there, she worked on recognizing and cataloging specimens. Also in 1926, she published her first academic work, a paper examining ethnological data analysis, in the journal &quot;The American Anthropologist&quot;. She accompanied Alfred on another trip to Peru in 1942 and other trips studying the Yurok and Mohave peoples, including to the Klamath River. She drew on these experiences in her 1968 book &quot;Almost Ancestors&quot;.

On their return from Peru, Alfred encouraged Theodora to continue working on her doctorate, but she declined, as she felt she had too many responsibilities. When they were not traveling, the Kroebers spent most of the year in a large redwood house, facing San Francisco Bay, to which Alfred was particularly attached. They both lived in the same house until their deaths. The redwood house has been described as the cornerstone of the Kroebers&#x27; lengthy marriage. They spent the summers in an old farmhouse they had bought in the Napa valley on a 40-acre ranch named &quot;Kishamish&quot;. Alfred&#x27;s friends among the Native Americans were frequent visitors to this house. During the academic year, Theodora kept in contact with Alfred&#x27;s academic acquaintances when the couple entertained them at their house in Berkeley.

==Writing career==
Kroeber began writing seriously once again after her husband had retired and her children were all grown, at approximately the same time that Ursula also began writing professionally. Between 1955 and 1956, a year the Kroebers spent at Stanford University, Theodora wrote a novel about Telluride. This work was never published, but helped her establish a habit of writing a little bit every day. In 1959, the year she turned 62, she published &quot;The Inland Whale&quot;, a retelling of California Native American legends that she had selected in the belief that they exhibited a certain originality. The book collected nine pieces that shared a theme of heroines: a section of authorial commentary was also included. One of these was a Yurok legend narrated to her by the Yurok Robert Spott, who had been among the visitors to Kishamish. The book was well-received, with critics identifying it as a notable work of comparative literature. One reviewer said Kroeber had made the legends accessible to a general audience by &quot;translating freely in her own sensitive, almost lyrical style&quot;.
===Ishi===
Kroeber spent 1960 and 1961 exploring the literature about Ishi, the last known member of the Yahi people, who had been found starving in Oroville, California, in 1911. Ishi had been brought to UC Berkeley, where he was studied and befriended by Alfred Kroeber and his associates. Ishi never shared his Yahi name; Alfred suggested to reporters that he be called &quot;Ishi&quot;, which meant &quot;man&quot; in the language of the Yana people, of which the Yahi were a subgroup. Ishi had died of tuberculosis in 1916. Theodora undertook to write an account of his life, believing that Alfred could not bring himself to do so. &quot;Ishi in Two Worlds&quot; was published in 1961, a year after Alfred&#x27;s death. Kroeber found the book&#x27;s challenging subject material to be difficult to write, as it recounted the extermination of the Yahi people as part of the California genocide and Ishi&#x27;s many years spent largely in solitude. She released a version of the story for children in 1964 titled &quot;Ishi: Last of His Tribe&quot;. She found this version even harder to write, as she struggled to present death to an audience largely shielded from it. This version was illustrated by Ruth Robbins: a review noted it was not another anthropological study, but discussed in simple language the cultural clashes which resulted from the Western expansion of the United States.

&quot;Ishi in Two Worlds&quot; became an immediate success and established Kroeber&#x27;s reputation for anthropological writing. Described as a &quot;modern classic&quot;, it was translated into nine languages and remained in print as of 2015. It sold half a million copies by 1976 and a million copies by 2001. The book generally received high praise upon publication: one reviewer said Kroeber had a talent for &quot;making us part of a life we never took part in&quot;. A 1979 commentary described it as the most widely read book about a Native American subject, calling it a &quot;beautifully written story&quot; that was &quot;evocative of Yahi culture&quot;. The story was adapted as a television film as &quot;&quot; in 1978, and as &quot;The Last of His Tribe&quot; in 1992.

Retrospective assessments of the book are more mixed. Thomas E. Simmons, a justice of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, wrote in 2019 that the book&#x27;s perspective on Ishi was &quot;empathetic yet deeply flawed&quot;, saying that it glossed over or did not take issue with the manner in which Ishi was presented as an exhibit. Writing in 1997, scholar Richard Pascal said the book, &quot;to its credit&quot;, did not evade the &quot;horrors inflicted upon the Yahi by the invading whites&quot;, an opinion echoed by historian James Clifford in 2013. Pascal nonetheless argued that the narrative&#x27;s goal was one of assimilation, and said it was &quot;colonizing &#x27;Ishi&#x27; in the name of American culture&quot;, and Clifford criticized the implicit assumption that coming into the care of Alfred Kroeber was the best outcome for Ishi.

Kroeber&#x27;s style continued to receive praise. Writing in 2010, historian Douglas Sackman compared &quot;Ishi in Two Worlds&quot; to &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, and stated that it spoke to the experiences of Native Americans in its exploration of &quot;the dark side of American expansion and the legacy of genocidal policies&quot; in the same way that Harper Lee&#x27;s book, published the previous year, examined racial prejudice and the legacy of slavery in the experience of African Americans. Clifford wrote that the account of Ishi&#x27;s life in San Francisco was written with &quot;skill and compassion&quot;, and added that &quot;[w]ith a generous appreciation of human complexity and an eye for the telling detail, [Kroeber] created a masterpiece&quot;. &quot;Ishi in Two Worlds&quot; &quot;wrapped up Ishi&#x27;s story in a humane, angry, lovely, bittersweet package&quot;, which remained the most detailed and complete account of Ishi&#x27;s life.

===Later writing===
Theodora published two papers in 1969, &quot;Shropshire Revisited&quot; and &quot;Life Against Death in English Poetry: A Method of Stylistic Definition&quot;, which she had written previously with Alfred. These both examined literary style in English poetry. Grace Buzaljko, editor for the UC Berkeley Department of Anthropology and subsequently author of a short biography of Theodora, described both Kroebers as &quot;superb stylists&quot;, Theodora having an inclination towards the &quot;personal and intense&quot;, which also made her anthropological writing accessible and enjoyable for a wide audience. Theodora edited Alfred&#x27;s &quot;An Anthropologist Looks at History&quot; (1963), wrote the forewords to two collections of Alfred&#x27;s writings which were unpublished until after his death, &quot;Yurok Myths&quot; (1976) and &quot;Karok Myths&quot; (1980), and collaborated with her daughter on &quot;Tillai and Tylissos&quot;, a poetry collection released in 1979. She also wrote a biography of her husband titled &quot;Alfred Kroeber: A Personal Configuration&quot;, published in 1970 by the University of California Press. It was widely praised by reviewers: Anthropologist George W. Stocking Jr. wrote that her &quot;gift for [evocative] and moving descriptive writing&quot; was frequently evident, and Buzaljko called it a &quot;sensitive biography with her inimitable phraseology and setting of mood&quot;. David G. Mandelbaum, a cultural anthropologist and former colleague of Alfred, stated that this biography was just as important a work from an anthropologist&#x27;s perspective as &quot;Ishi in Two Worlds&quot;. Reviews also discussed the biography&#x27;s illumination of Kroeber&#x27;s academic development and called it a work of value to anthropologists; others found it wanting as a scholarly biography.

Kroeber published several other works in the years that followed, including a short story and two novels along with her anthropological writings. After completing &quot;Ishi: Last of His Tribe&quot;, she collaborated with Robert Heizer, an anthropologist at UC Berkeley, to publish two pictorial accounts of Native Americans in California: &quot;Almost Ancestors&quot;, released in 1968, and &quot;Drawn from Life&quot;, released in 1976. These books collected images from several sources with text written by Kroeber, and were described by the &quot;American Anthropologist&quot; as examining social change among California&#x27;s Indian peoples in a literary style that was Kroeber&#x27;s own. Kroeber notes that the images included therein were poor, but defended their publication, writing &quot;Why offer so flawed and partial a record? It is all the record there is... We believe you will see through the pictures, imperfect as they are, to the living human beings who sat for them.&quot; Anthropologist Lowell Bean expressed disappointment in the quality of the illustrations, and wrote that the essays were &quot;oversimplified&quot;, but nonetheless found value in the illustrations, and commended the authors for &quot;painstaking efforts&quot;.
==Later life==
On December 14, 1969, Kroeber married John Quinn, who was working at the time for the Sierra Club. Quinn had been one of the editors for &quot;Almost Ancestors&quot;. Quinn, an artist and psychotherapist, was several decades younger than Kroeber. She reflected on the impact of age gaps within marriage in a 1976 essay, using her own experience of having been much younger than her second husband and older than her third husband. After their marriage, the couple moved into Theodora&#x27;s home on Arch Street in Berkeley. They also designed and built a home known as Quinnwood in Anchor Bay, California, where they lived part-time until 1978. Quinn encouraged her to complete her biography of Alfred, which she was having trouble with when she had met Quinn. Ten years later, when Kroeber&#x27;s health was declining, Quinn encouraged her to write a short autobiography, which was printed privately after her death.

Kroeber described her political views as those of an &quot;old thirties liberal&quot;. She was a lifelong supporter of the Democratic Party and a participant in peace rallies in her final years. In 1977 she was offered a position on the University of California Board of Regents by California Governor Jerry Brown. She held the position for a year before she resigned, stating that the position was exhausting her. Her last act in that position was to send a memorandum to the rest of the board, challenging the University&#x27;s involvement in research into nuclear weapons, and stating that the board had an &quot;unblushing commitment... to the development of science and the practice of war, of human and earth destruction&quot;. On July 4, 1979, she died of cancer in her Berkeley home.

==Legacy==
Berkeley anthropologist Albert Elsasser, writing an obituary of Kroeber in the &quot;American Anthropologist&quot;, described her as a pioneer of statistical analyses of cultural relationships in Polynesia, which she had analyzed in her 1926 paper. Her husband Alfred Kroeber later expanded upon those methods in his work on indigenous peoples in California. Elsasser wrote that Kroeber did not have an inclination for &quot;any discipline that stressed dry prose or statistics&quot;, and notes that it was not clear whether she wished to pursue a career in academia. Kroeber said she had no ambition &quot;in the public sense of ambition&quot;, and expressed no dissatisfaction at having left her graduate work. According to Elsasser, Kroeber had instead an appreciation for the &quot;aesthetic implications of [Alfred Kroeber&#x27;s] work with Indians&quot;, and he writes that manner of interacting with people likely had an influence on her husband&#x27;s work. UC Berkeley conducted an oral history with Kroeber in 1982.

Kroeber&#x27;s writing was nonetheless widely influential. Critics wrote of &quot;The Inland Whale&quot; that Kroeber had broken ground in getting oral traditions recognized for their literary worth. A 1980 obituary stated that &quot;Ishi in Two Worlds&quot; had probably been read by more people than had ever read Alfred Kroeber&#x27;s works. Sackman wrote that the book inspired greater interest in both Native American and environmental causes, and a 2002 commentary argued that had it not been for Kroeber&#x27;s book, Ishi&#x27;s story would never have come to wider attention. It has also been described as influencing the writing of her daughter Ursula, whose fiction frequently examines cultural contact. Buzaljko&#x27;s 1989 biography of Kroeber stated that her &quot;great strength was as an interpreter of one culture to another&quot;, going on to say that through her writing she demonstrated the connections between the history of California&#x27;s indigenous people and modern society.

<doc id="347344" wikidata="Q317654" url="?curid=347344" title="Raul Julia">
<text>Raúl Rafael Carlos Juliá y Arcelay (March 9, 1940 – October 24, 1994) was a Puerto Rican actor. He was known for his intense and varied roles on stage and screen. He started his career in the Public Theater before transitioning to film. He received numerous accolades including a Drama Desk Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award and nominations for four Tony Awards. In 2017, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named him one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.

Born in San Juan, Julia took an interest in acting while in school and pursued the career upon completion of his studies. After performing locally for some time, he was convinced by actor and entertainment personality Orson Bean to move to New York City. Julia, who had been bilingual since childhood, soon gained interest in Broadway and off-Broadway plays. He performed in mobile projects, including the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater. Julia was eventually noticed by producer Joseph Papp, who offered him work in the New York Shakespeare Festival. 

In 1978, Julia starred alongside Meryl Streep in a revival of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot; at the Delacorte Theater. He received four Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical nominations for &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; (1972), &quot;Where&#x27;s Charley?&quot; (1975), &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; (1977), and &quot;Nine&quot; (1982). Julia starred in the original Broadway production of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Betrayal&quot; (1979). He also starred in revivals of &quot;Design for Living&quot; (1984), &quot;Othello&quot; (1991), and his final Broadway role &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; (1994).

Julia gained prominence for his role as Gomez Addams in two film adaptations of &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. He received Golden Globe Award nominations for &quot;Tempest&quot; (1982), &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; (1985), and &quot;Moon Over Parador&quot; (1988). He is also known for his film roles in &quot;The Panic in Needle Park&quot; (1971), &quot;One from the Heart&quot; (1982), &quot;The Morning After&quot; (1986), &quot;Romero&quot; (1989), and &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; (1990). In 1994, Julia suffered several health afflictions, eventually dying after suffering a stroke. For his work in &quot;The Burning Season&quot;, he was posthumously awarded a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries, or Television Film.

==Early life and education==
Julia was born March 9, 1940, in Floral Park (Hato Rey), a suburb of San Juan, to Olga Arcelay and Raúl Juliá. He was the oldest of four brothers, and sisters Maria Eugenia Juliá and Olga Maria Juliá. His mother was a mezzo-soprano who sang in a church choir before marrying Julia&#x27;s father, who was an electrical engineer who graduated from Trine University. Julia&#x27;s brother, Rafa, died in a car accident when Juliá was 19 years old. Some relatives were also musicians, including his great aunt María González, whom he credited as the inspiration behind his artistic career. The family was Catholic. His direct paternal line goes back to his great-great-grandfather, Francisco Julia Brell, from Barcelona, Spain, settling in Manati, Puerto Rico in 1834.

Raúl&#x27;s father was the founder of La Cueva del Chicken Inn, a restaurant in San Juan. The building was originally a gas station and body shop before being remodeled after a similar restaurant in Madrid, Spain, called Las Cuevas de Luis Candelas, which is intended to mimic the structure of a gypsum cave. Julia&#x27;s father claimed that he had brought pizza to Puerto Rico, after he hired an Italian cook in New York City who could prepare pizza. The restaurant is also supposed to be the first to distribute chicken-in-a-basket within the archipelago, which Miriam Fitts helped him develop.

Julia was enrolled in the Colegio Espíritu Santo in Hato Rey, a Catholic private school, where most of the personnel spoke exclusively English. There, he participated in his first play in first grade, interpreting the devil, with his performance earning him participation in all subsequent school plays. After witnessing Errol Flynn&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, he decided to pursue an acting career.

During his childhood, Julia&#x27;s family followed a strict Jesuit practice, often taking homeless children into their household. His mother received recognition from the Catholic University of Ponce for these efforts.

By the seventh grade, Julia was able to speak English fluently and had gained interest in the works of William Shakespeare. Julia concluded his secondary education at Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola, where he would organize plays of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;King Lear&quot;, and &quot;The Tempest&quot;. Seeking to please his parents, he continued his education with a year at Fordham University, the well-known private Jesuit university in New York City, before returning home to enroll at the University of Puerto Rico, where he joined the Phi Sigma Alpha fraternity.

Julia continued acting in local plays and nightclubs as he earned a bachelor of arts degree. Julia eventually realized that he had no interest in pursuing the law career favored by his parents, choosing to act full-time despite having doubts that he could sustain himself working as an actor.

==Acting career==
===New York Shakespeare Festival===
Consequently, Julia began performing in several plays that were held in San Juan. He performed in a restaging of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, which was held in one of the municipality&#x27;s colonial castles in order to simulate the setting of the work. Other works included playing the role of Roderigo in &quot;Othello&quot; at a local drama production. Parallel to this, Julia began making presentations at the &quot;Ted Mack Amateur Hour&quot;. After joining a musical group named the Lamplighters, despite receiving opposition from his parents, he was recruited by Lillian Hurst to perform alongside her, eventually receiving work at a hotel named El Convento.

During this time, he began considering the possibility of moving to Europe to take acting classes. During one of their acts, Julia was approached by Orson Bean, who was on vacation in Puerto Rico and provided him with contact information, wanting him to travel to New York and work there. His parents were shocked by the proposal, but ultimately agreed to support his decision. Julia&#x27;s departure was postponed after his younger brother, Rafael, died in a traffic collision. During this time, he became engaged to Magda Vasallo Molinelli.

In 1964, when he was 24 years old, he traveled to New York City, arriving in the middle of a winter storm. After establishing residence in Manhattan, Julia worked at a variety of odd jobs to pay his expenses, going so far as to attend sales training (provided by a distributor) in the proper way to sell pens. When Hurst visited him, they attended a Broadway play, which prompted a discovery that surprised him—that it was possible to work as an actor full-time. As a result, Julia began seeking employment in both Broadway and Off-Broadway plays. Seeking to further improve his acting, he took lessons from Wynn Handman, who was recommended by Bean; his class included future fellow star Christopher Walken.

His first work was in a production of Pedro Calderón de la Barca&#x27;s &quot;Life Is a Dream&quot;, wherein he played Astolfo, thereby making himself eligible to receive his Actors Equity card from Actors&#x27; Equity Association. Initially, Julia received an allowance from his parents, but after hiring manager Jeff Hunter, he landed a role in a production of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, thereafter declining further financial assistance. He began performing with Phoebe Brand&#x27;s mobile theatre, presenting plays in low-income neighborhoods of New York. In 1965, he married Vasallo Molinelli.

In 1966, Julia was cast in the role of Macduff in a Spanish-language version of &quot;Macbeth,&quot; and also performed in &quot;The Ox Cart (La Carreta)&quot;, a stage play written by Puerto Rican playwright René Marqués. Míriam Colón Valle, who also participated in &quot;La Carreta&quot;, established the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater, where he performed. In 1967, the founder of the New York Shakespeare Festival (NYSF), Joseph Papp, attended a performance at Delacorte Theater, where Julia was reading patriotic Puerto Rican poetry. Subsequently, Papp offered him the role of Demetrius in a staging of &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;. After this play concluded, he contacted Papp who offered him the job of stage manager in NYSF&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. While performing this task, Julia also performed in some of the plays.

===Broadway and television===
In September 1968, after auditioning four times for the role, Julia debuted in his first Broadway play, performing as Chan in a staging of &quot;The Cuban Thing&quot;. The following year, he was cast in a production of Arthur Kopit&#x27;s &quot;Indians&quot;. During this time, Vasallo Molinelli and he were divorced. In 1970, Julia, in the role of Paco Montoya in &quot;The Castro Complex&quot;, received notably favorable reviews. While rehearsing for an off-Broadway play, he met Merel Poloway and began a relationship with her.

As he gained prominence on Broadway, Julia was cast in two television series, &quot;Love of Life&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. He disliked his role in &quot;Love of Life&quot;, only appearing on the show for a brief time. On &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, he was Rafael the Fix-It Man, a recurring character during the show&#x27;s third season. Raphael the Fix-It Man&#x27;s partner at the Fix-It Shop was Emilio Delgado&#x27;s character Luis, who after debuting with Julia, went on to a long tenure on the show. During 1971–1972, Julia earned roles in three films: &quot;The Organization&quot;, &quot;The Panic in Needle Park&quot;, and a film adaptation of &quot;Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me&quot;.

While working on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, Julia was contacted by Papp, who offered him the role of Proteus in &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;. For his performance in this play, Julia received his first nomination for a Tony Award and won the 1972 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance. In 1973, he interpreted Edmund in &quot;King Lear,&quot; followed by the role of Orlando in &quot;As You Like It&quot;. Julia noted that he cherished the roles he played in these Shakespeare plays, particularly the rhythm, music, and poetry present in them. He also acted in &quot;Via Galactica&quot;″s limited presentation on Broadway and, on television, played Dr. Greg Robinson, Jerry&#x27;s brother, in the &quot;Oh, Brother&quot; episode of &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;.

In 1974, Julia was cast as the titular role of Charley Wykeham in the comedy, &quot;Where&#x27;s Charley?&quot;, receiving his second Tony Award nomination for his performance. He subsequently joined Werner Erhard&#x27;s Erhard Seminars Training or &quot;est&quot;, an organization that promotes self-motivation, by participating in its seminars. In 1976, Julia played Mack the Knife in &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, interpreting the dialogue with a marked British accent. The performance earned him a third Tony Award nomination. He then returned to film as Italian car racer Franco Bertollini in &quot;The Gumball Rally&quot;.

That same year, Julia married Poloway in the Catskill Mountains. The ceremony was led by Swami Muktananda as part of a spiritual retreat. The couple had met the Swami through Erhard. After this retreat, Erhard founded The Hunger Project, claiming that after traveling to India, he felt motivated to found a nonprofit organization to eliminate world hunger through philanthropic galas. Julia joined the initiative at its conception, establishing a personal goal of raising $1 million for the organization. In 1978, his interpretation of the lead role in the 1924 theatrical version of &quot;Dracula&quot; was well received.

While performing as Dracula, Julia also played Petruchio in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; in 1978. His interaction with co-star Meryl Streep was tense at first, before developing into a friendship as the production advanced. In 1979, he starred as Othello opposite Richard Dreyfuss as Iago, later reviving the role in 1991 with Christopher Walken as Iago. Julia followed up his double-duty stage work with a role in Paul Mazursky&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;The Tempest&quot;, spending several months in Italy while exploring its culture. During this time, he received the script for &quot;Nine,&quot; the play that would garner him a fourth Tony Award nomination. In preparation for his role in Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Betrayal&quot;, Julia moved temporarily to London, hiring a dialect coach to train him in British pronunciation. Julia subsequently used a British or trans-Atlantic accent for most of his film work, including &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot;, &quot;The Addams Family&quot; films, and &quot;Street Fighter&quot;.

===Acting in Hollywood===
In 1982, Julia played Calibanos in Mazursky&#x27;s &quot;Tempest&quot; and Ray in the musical &quot;One from the Heart&quot;. In 1983, his first son with Poloway, Raul Sigmund Julia, was born. That year, he also starred in the public television film &quot;Overdrawn at the Memory Bank&quot;, which received a weak reception and was satirized on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. After not appearing in a film for two years, Julia played a political prisoner named Valentín in an adaptation of the Manuel Puig work &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot;. Valentín&#x27;s cellmate is a flamboyant homosexual (William Hurt), jailed for immoral behavior in Brazil, who passes the time by describing scenes from his favorite romantic movie to Valentín; slowly, the two form a bond based on mutual understanding and respect. In view of the uniqueness of the script, Julia agreed to begin filming before receiving his salary and traveled to South America, where he interviewed rebels and ex-prisoners to familiarize himself with their experiences and ideology. Upon its release, &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; was a commercial and critical success. For his performance, Julia received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award and won the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures award for best actor, along with co-lead actor William Hurt.

The following year, he appeared in his first Puerto Rican film, &quot;La Gran Fiesta&quot;, offering a monologue near the end of the film. In 1985, he starred as Major Sergius Saranoff in an adaptation of &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;. This was followed by the role of David Suárez in the romantic comedy &quot;Compromising Positions&quot;. In 1986, Julia played a hairdresser named Joaquin Manero in &quot;The Morning After&quot;. Following his usual procedure of practical preparation for a role, he took cosmetology lessons and worked at a hair salon for some time.

In 1987, Julia had the lead role in &quot;The Penitent&quot;. Later on that year, his second son with Poloway, Benjamín Rafael Juliá, was born. In 1988, Julia played a corrupt official in Paul Mazursky&#x27;s comedy, &quot;Moon over Parador&quot;, which received negative reviews from critics. The following year, he co-starred with Anthony Quinn in &quot;&quot;, a biographic film covering the life of Aristotle Onassis. In 1989, Julia was cast as San Salvadoran Archbishop Óscar Romero in the biographical movie, &quot;Romero&quot;. During his life, Romero had been a staunch advocate of human rights, often publicly denouncing violations of these rights, which prompted his assassination during a mass. Julia accepted the role based on its political nature, seeking to draw attention to the issues in that region of Central America. To prepare for the role, he read Romero&#x27;s diary and autobiography, as well as listening to or watching recordings of his messages and masses, which prompted him to rejoin the Catholic Church. Poloway, who is Jewish, and he decided not to raise their children in a particular religion, believing that they should make their own decisions after reaching adulthood. The government of El Salvador refused to allow distribution of the film because of its content, so the film received only clandestine circulation. Due to his activity between 1987 and 1989, Julia was ranked first in the &quot;Variety&quot; article &quot;List of Busiest Hollywood Actors&quot;. Julia then starred in the 1989 film adaptation of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, recreating the role of Macheath for the movie, which was renamed &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; for its American release.

In 1990, he was cast to as a lawyer in &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot;, receiving solid reviews for his performance. Prior to the filming, Julia spent time in courtrooms and studied the court system. Also in 1990, he appeared opposite Robert Redford in &quot;Havana&quot;, but chose to remain uncredited because the director, Sydney Pollack, refused to give him above-the-title credit. In 1991, when Joseph Papp died, Julia commented that the director was directly responsible for finding him roles besides that of &quot;stereotypical Latinos&quot;, such as the &quot;Latin lover&quot;. Julia was cast to play Gomez Addams in an adaptation of &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. He was attracted to the role because of the character&#x27;s irreverent portrayal, noting, &quot;even his depressions are wonderful&quot;. Since his earlier recollections of the role were of the Spanish-dubbed version of the first television series, he had to adapt the role directly from the original cartoons drawn by Charles Addams, receiving a nomination for a Saturn Award.

In 1992, Julia played the title role in a revival of &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; with Sheena Easton, a Broadway musical adaptation of the Miguel de Cervantes novel, &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. The play originated in 1965, with the main character played by Richard Kiley; one of his favorite actors, José Ferrer, had been considered for the title role at the time. Julia performed this role eight times per week. Subsequently, he reprised his role as Gomez Addams in &quot;Addams Family Values&quot;. In 1994, Julia played Chico Mendes in &quot;The Burning Season&quot; for HBO, for which he received critical acclaim. He familiarized himself with the role by analyzing interviews and footage from Mendes&#x27; Xapuri Rubber Tappers Union.

Despite his poor health, which began three years prior to his death, he completed &quot;The Burning Season&quot; and was eager to play M. Bison in &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, which was to be filmed in Australia in the autumn. Julia felt that this film would allow him to spend more time with his children, who were fans of the video-game franchise and helped him prepare for the role. He received his second Saturn Award nomination for his performance, which was considered the high point of the otherwise poorly received motion picture. This would be his final role in a major film, with his last work being a leading role in the television drama &quot;Down Came a Blackbird&quot;, which was filmed in Toronto, Ontario during September and October 1994. His poor health was apparent in these last three films because of his substantial weight loss.

==Health and death==
Unbeknownst to the public, Julia had suffered from stomach cancer for three years prior to his death and had undergone surgery for it in 1993. In early 1994, during the filming of &quot;The Burning Season&quot; in Mexico, he contracted food poisoning after consuming sushi. Julia was airlifted to a hospital in Los Angeles to receive medical attention. After recovering, he returned to Mexico to finish the film, although he had lost some weight and was physically weakened by his condition. In mid-October, Julia began feeling intense abdominal pain and was taken by ambulance to North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, Long Island. At first, he did not appear worried about his condition and was seen in his hospital bed eagerly reviewing the script for his upcoming role in &quot;Desperado&quot;, but his condition gradually worsened. On the night of October 20, 1994, Julia suffered a stroke, fell into a coma, and was put on life support. Four days later, on October 24, 1994, Julia died at the age of 54 from complications of a stroke, never having regained consciousness.

In accordance with Julia&#x27;s instructions, his body was transported to Puerto Rico. A state funeral was held in San Juan on October 27, 1994, with Julia&#x27;s body being escorted to the building of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, where a funeral ceremony was held. The service was attended by thousands of Puerto Ricans, with native &quot;plena&quot; music being played in the background. The burial ceremony was also attended by thousands, with &quot;La Borinqueña&quot; being sung by Lucecita Benítez prior to the procession. After stopping at San Ignacio de Loyola Church, the procession advanced to Buxeda Cemetery, where politician and activist Rubén Berríos offered the final words. As Julia&#x27;s coffin was lowered, a load of carnations was dropped from a helicopter while the crowd shouted &quot;¡Viva Puerto Rico Libre!&quot; Julia was a supporter of the Puerto Rican independence movement; on one occasion, he convinced his agent to allow him to do an advertising campaign on behalf of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company.

Subsequent memorial ceremonies were held at Joseph Papp Public Theater in New York and in Los Angeles, where several actors and personalities, including Rubén Blades and Edward James Olmos, expressed their grief. A mass in Miami and numerous private ceremonies were also held. The staff of Universal Pictures paid homage to him by dedicating &quot;Street Fighter&quot; to his memory, adding the phrase &quot;For Raúl. Vaya con Dios.&quot; in the film&#x27;s ending credits. Julia had been set to reprise his role as M. Bison in the video-game version of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; film, having already met with the production staff. The New York Shakespeare Festival bought an obituary notice in &quot;Variety&quot;, where his birth and death dates were accompanied by a quote from Shakespeare. The Puerto Rican Traveling Theater established the Raúl Juliá Training Unit, giving free acting classes to young actors.

For his performance in &quot;The Burning Season&quot;, Julia was posthumously awarded a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a CableACE Award, and an Emmy Award. Although he did not make his screen debut before 1950, Julia was a nominee for the American Film Institute&#x27;s AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Stars. Actors such as Helen Hunt and Jimmy Smits have cited him as a source of inspiration. On November 21, 1994, then-Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani declared that date Raul Julia Day. In 1996, he was inducted into the Theatre Hall of Fame on Broadway. The Puerto Rican Chamber of Commerce created the Raúl Juliá Scholarship Fund in 1997, intended to provide college education for teenagers.

==Humanitarian work==
During his lifetime, Julia continued the charitable work done by his parents during his childhood, engaging in social and educational activities. His contributions were acknowledged with an invitation to join the New York Council for the Humanities. Much of Julia&#x27;s charity work was focused on at-risk youth, the Latin American community, and the arts. Concerned about rising levels of violence among teenagers, he sponsored scriptwriting programs in high schools and supported young actors. To promote other Latin American artists, Julia actively lent his support to the Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors (HOLA) and co-founded Visiones Luminosas, an initiative to foster screenwriters. He continued to work in the NYSF, electing to donate his time.

In a similar fashion, Julia co-operated with independent filmmakers in Puerto Rico by acting in their productions for free or receiving a reduced salary. This constant involvement with the Latin American community earned him a posthumous Hispanic Heritage Award. Julia also promoted interracial acceptance and cooperation as a member of Racial Harmony and served as the chairman of the Joseph Papp Celebrity Coalition for Racial Harmony.

As part of his work for the Hunger Project, Julia made monthly donations to a food bank. He also promoted the program on television and radio and served as the narrator of bilingual videos about the Hunger Project. Julia somehow found time in his notoriously busy schedule to participate in multiple benefit galas on behalf of the organization as well. Due to this work, the project gave him their Global Citizen Award. His involvement was also recognized in &quot;Ending Hunger: An Idea Whose Time Has Come&quot;. On March 24, 1992, Julia received the Courage of Conscience Award. In 1994, the government of El Salvador recognized him for his human-rights activism, selecting him to serve as overseer of their general elections in representation of Freedom House. During his visit to the country, he visited the tomb of Romero, subsequently describing his experience in a piece published in &quot;Freedom Review&quot;.

In recognition of his wide-ranging impact, the National Endowment for the Hispanic Arts offers the Raul Julia Award for Excellence annually. In 2002, actress Sandra Bullock was presented with the award. She received it for her work as the executive producer of the &quot;George Lopez&quot; TV series, which offered work and exposition for Hispanic talent. In 2003, Daniel Rodríguez won the first Raul Julia Global Citizen Award from the New York-based Puerto Rico Family Institute, receiving the recognition for his charitable work.

<text>Muir Woods National Monument ( ) is a United States National Monument managed by the National Park Service and named after naturalist John Muir. It is located on Mount Tamalpais near the Pacific coast in southwestern Marin County, California. The Monument is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and is north of San Francisco. It protects , of which are old growth coast redwood (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;) forests, one of a few such stands remaining in the San Francisco Bay Area.

==Geography==
===Ecosystem===

The Muir Woods National Monument is an old-growth coastal redwood forest. Due to its proximity to the Pacific Ocean, the forest is regularly shrouded in a coastal marine layer fog, contributing to a wet environment that encourages vigorous plant growth. The fog is also vital for the growth of the redwoods as they use moisture from the fog during drought seasons, particularly during dry summers.

===Climate===
The monument remains cool and moist year round with daytime temperatures averaging between 40 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (). Rainfall is heavy during the winter and summers are almost completely dry with the exception of fog drip caused by the fog passing through the trees. Annual precipitation in the park ranges from 39.4 inches (1,000 mm) in the lower valley to 47.2 inches () higher up in the mountain slopes.

===Soils and bedrock===
The redwoods grow on brown humus-rich loam which may be gravelly, stony or somewhat sandy. This soil has been assigned to the Centissima series, which is always found on sloping ground. It is well drained, moderately deep, and slightly to moderately acidic.
It has developed from a mélange in the Franciscan Formation. More open areas of the park have shallow gravelly loam of the Barnabe series, or deep hard loam of the Cronkhite series.

==History==
One hundred fifty million years ago ancestors of redwood and sequoia trees grew throughout the United States. Today, the &quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot; can be found only in a narrow, cool coastal belt from Monterey County, California, in the south to Oregon in the north.

Before the logging industry came to California, there were an estimated 2 million acres (8,000 km2) of old growth forest containing redwoods growing in a narrow strip along the coast.

By the early 20th century, most of these forests had been cut down. Just north of the San Francisco Bay, one valley named Redwood Canyon remained uncut, mainly due to its relative inaccessibility.

This was noticed by William Kent, a rising California politician who would soon be elected to the U.S. Congress. He and his wife, Elizabeth Thacher Kent, purchased of land from the Tamalpais Land and Water Company for $45,000 in 1905 with the goal of protecting the redwoods and the mountain above them. The deal was facilitated by banker Lovell White and his activist wife, Laura Lyon White.

In 1907, a water company in nearby Sausalito planned to dam Redwood Creek, thereby flooding the valley. When Kent objected to the plan, the water company threatened to use eminent domain and took him to court to attempt to force the project to move ahead. Kent sidestepped the water company&#x27;s plot by donating of the redwood forest to the federal government, thus bypassing the local courts.

Muir Woods became a national monument on January 9th, 1908 before the National Park Service existed when it was signed into law under the Antiquities Act by president Theodore Roosevelt. Prior to this, Muir Woods was called &quot;Redwoods Canyon&quot; before it was bought by the Kent family. The family bought the area to protect and preserve it and worked to get President Roosevelt to declare it a monument. In legislation written to protect Muir Woods, it was described as, &quot;of extraordinary scientific interest and importance because of the primeval character of the forest in which it is located, and of the character, age and size of the trees&quot;. Once declared a national monument, Muir Woods was immediately protected and placed under the care of the United States Government. The Antiquities Act was the first of its kind to provide protection for natural resources.

The original suggested name of the monument was the Kent Monument but Kent insisted the monument be named after naturalist John Muir, whose environmental campaigns helped to establish the National Park system, and President Roosevelt agreed with this proposition.

Kent and Muir had become friends over shared views of wilderness preservation, but Kent&#x27;s later support for the flooding of Hetch Hetchy caused Muir to end their friendship.

In December 1928, the Kent Memorial was erected at the Kent Tree in Fern Canyon. This tree—a Douglas fir, not a redwood—was said to be Kent&#x27;s favorite. Due to its height of and location on a slope, the tree leaned towards the valley for more than 100 years. Storms in El Niño years of 1981 and 1982 caused the tree to tilt even more and took out the top of the tree. During the winter of 2002–03, many storms brought high winds to Muir Woods causing the tree to lean so much that a fissure developed in January 2003. This fissure grew larger as the tree slowly leaned more and more, forcing the closure of some trails. On March 18, 2003, at around 8:28 pm, the tree fell, damaging several other trees nearby. The closed trails have since been reconfigured and reopened.

In 1937, the Golden Gate Bridge was completed and park attendance tripled, reaching over 180,000. Muir Woods is one of the major tourist attractions of the San Francisco Bay Area, with 776,000 visitors in 2005.

President Franklin Delano Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945, shortly before he was to have opened the United Nations Conference on International Organization for which delegates from 50 countries met in San Francisco to draft and sign the United Nations Charter. On May 19, the delegates held a commemorative ceremony in tribute to his memory in Muir Woods&#x27; Cathedral Grove, where a dedication plaque was placed in his honor.

The monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 9, 2008.

==Biology==

===Flora===

The main attraction of Muir Woods are the coast redwood (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;) trees. They are known for their height, and are related to the giant sequoia of the Sierra Nevada. While redwoods can grow to nearly (), the tallest tree in the Muir Woods is . The trees come from a seed no bigger than that of a tomato seed. Most of the redwoods in the monument are between 500 and 800 years old. The oldest is at least 1,200 years old.

Other tree species grow in the understory of the redwood groves. Three of the most common are the California bay laurel, the bigleaf maple and the tanoak. Each of these species has developed a unique adaptation to the low level of dappled sunlight that reaches them through the redwoods overhead. The California bay laurel has a strong root system that allows the tree to lean towards openings in the canopy. The bigleaf maple, true to its name, has developed the largest leaf of any maple species. These large leaves allow it to capture more of the forest&#x27;s dim light. The tanoak has a unique internal leaf structure that enables it to make effective use of the light that filters through the canopy.

===Fish===

Redwood Creek provides a critical spawning and rearing habitat for coho or silver salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus kisutch&quot;) and steelhead (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;). Steelhead are listed as threatened species (2011) in the Central California Coast distinct population segment. Coho salmon are listed as endangered in their evolutionary significant unit (2011). The creek is near the southernmost limit of coho habitat and the fish have never been stocked, so they have a distinctive DNA. The Redwood Creek salmon are Central Coast coho salmon which have been listed as federally threatened species since October 2006 and as federally endangered species in June 2005. Coho migrate from the ocean back to freshwater for a single chance at reproduction, generally after two years in the ocean. The spawning migrations begin after heavy late fall or winter rains breach the sandbar at Muir Beach allowing the fish to move upstream (usually in December and January). No salmon were seen in the 2007–2008 winter run, nor the 2008–2009 winter run. Evidence points to exhaustion of smolt oversummering in the creek due to a loss of large woody debris and deep pools where young salmon can rest. Starting in 2009, the National Park Service began restoring Muir Beach to create a functional, self-sustaining ecosystem and improve visitor access. The intervention was almost too late, since the coho only has a three-year life span. But, as of January 2010, and for the first time in three years, an estimated 45 coho swam up Redwood Creek to spawn, creating 23 redds or clusters of eggs. In 2011, 11 live adult coho and 1 coho carcass was observed, along with three redds, a modest increase over the 2007–2008 spawning season. Statewide the coho population is 1% of its levels in the 1940s and the fish have vanished from 90% of the streams they formerly visited. The Watershed Alliance of Marin reported that no salmon returned to spawn in 2014, prompting concerns that the fish may now be extirpated from the creek.

===Birds===
Muir Woods is home to over 50 species of birds. This relatively low number is due to the lack of insects. The tannin in the trees repels the insects and the volume of flowers and fruits produced by plants below the canopy is limited by the shade of the redwoods.

It is occasionally possible to see northern spotted owls or pileated woodpeckers in the forest. While decreasing in numbers elsewhere, the spotted owls appear to be thriving in the monument and other evergreen forests in the area. A National Park Service monitoring project of the owls is ongoing within the monument. The project has found that adult owls are finding mates, raising young to adulthood and the young are having new broods of their own.
===Mammals===
The monument is home to a variety of mammals ranging in size from the small, four-inch long American shrew mole to the much larger black-tailed subspecies of mule deer, &quot;Odocoileus hemionus columbianus&quot;. The majority of the monument&#x27;s mammals are either nocturnal or are burrowing animals that live underground or in the forest floor&#x27;s dense plant litter. Most commonly seen are Sonoma chipmunks and western gray squirrels.

Bears historically roamed the area but were largely exterminated by habitat destruction. In 2003 a male black bear was spotted wandering in various areas of Marin County, including Muir Woods.

There are 11 species of bats that call the monument home, often using hollows burned into the redwoods by past fires as a maternity colony.

In November 2010 sea otters (&quot;Enhydra lutris&quot;) have been spotted swimming in the new stream channel constructed in the lagoon area of Redwood Creek.

==Recreation==

Muir Woods, part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, is a park which caters to pedestrians, as parking of vehicles is only allowed at the very entrance. Hiking trails vary in the level of difficulty and distance. Picnicking, camping and pets are not permitted.

As of 2015, the park sees up to 6000 visitors per day during peak times (April to October, Thanksgiving weekend, and Christmas through New Years), more than 80% of which arrive by car, and most of the rest with a tour bus or shuttle bus. Currently, parking is extremely limited and lots often fill early in the day. The county and the National Park Service introduced a reservation system in early 2018 which restricts the number of vehicles allowed to enter and park in Muir Woods every day. Residents of neighboring Mill Valley had protested against earlier plans to set up an additional parking lot, and together with a group named &quot;Mount Tam Task Force&quot; sued to prevent the building of a shuttle bus station.

===Facilities===
==== Parking and shuttle ====
Reservations are required for all vehicles and shuttle riders since 2018. Marin Transit operates a shuttle on all weekends and holidays and during select peak weekdays, providing service to Muir Woods from Sausalito, Marin City, or Mill Valley (Route 66); the National Park Service recommends that visitors use the shuttle when it is operating to avoid difficulties in finding parking.

The NPS requires reservations made in advance for all vehicles and shuttle riders; a parking reservation is $8.50 per vehicle while a spot on the shuttle is $3.25 per person. Furthermore, an entrance fee of $15.00 per person is charged in order to gain entry to Muir Woods. The shuttle service and park are open every day of the year including holidays. The park is open from 8:00 am and closes at sunset.

====Lodging and camping====
There are no camping or lodging facilities in Muir Woods. The monument is a day-use area only. There are camping facilities in the adjacent Mount Tamalpais State Park.

====Comfort facilities====
* Restrooms located in entrance plaza and cafe
* Muir Woods Trading Company cafe and gift shop – offers deli food items and souvenirs. The cafe also has a permanent display of historic photographs.
* The main trail (paved and boardwalk) through Muir Woods is a loop. A loop from the Visitor Center, through Founders Grove, to Bridge 2 and back is ADA accessible.

====Interpretive facilities====
* The Visitor Center, located in the entrance plaza, features permanent and changing exhibits on redwood ecology and conservation, as well as a store selling books and gift items.

===Activities===

====Hiking and biking====
 The paved/boardwalk main trail begins at the entrance plaza (Trail Map) and travels into the old growth redwood forest alongside Redwood Creek. Other unpaved walking trails extend from the main trail to connect with Mt. Tamalpais State Park trails outside of the monument boundaries.

Bicycles are only allowed on designated fire roads.

====Athletic events====
The annual Dipsea Race, a footrace which goes between Mill Valley and Stinson Beach, passes through Muir Woods on the second Sunday in June. The Double Dipsea, later in June and the Quad Dipsea, in November, follow the same course.

====Ranger-led activities====
Rangers and volunteers present 15-minute interpretive talks and guided one-hour tours when staffing permits. Program topics include redwood ecology and conservation, the impact of climate change, and the history of Muir Woods. Longer hikes or other special programs are offered several times per month, and require a reservation.

====Weddings and Special Events ====
Weddings, commercial filming, and special events are allowed in the monument only with a proper permit.

== Impact of tourism ==

=== Positive ===
In 2018, more than 17.5 million visitors visited Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Muir Woods National Monument, and Fort Point National Historic Site, and spent $1.2 billion in communities near the parks. The protections given to these areas by the federal government helped to  establish them as natural tourist destinations creating an attraction that brought positive externalities in the form of increased business to the surrounding communities.  According to the National Park Service, the spending and cash flow brought to the area through these visitors created 12,658 new local jobs and had a net benefit of $1.6 billion in additional revenue.

A peer-reviewed visitor spending analysis was conducted by economists Catherine Thomas and Egan Cornachione of the U.S. Geological Survey and Lynne Koontz of the National Park Service. The report shows $20.2 billion of direct spending by more than 318 million park visitors in communities within 60 miles of a national park. This spending supported 329,000 jobs nationally; 268,000 of those jobs are found in these gateway communities. The cumulative benefit to the U.S. economy was $40.1 billion.

=== Negative ===
The popularity of Muir Woods as a tourist destination has created a great deal of congestion and delay on the two lane California State Highway 1. As a result, many civilians and residents living near Muir Woods and affected by the increased traffic on the pathway to the national monument have voiced concern with the National Park Service. In response, policy was designed that would create a parking reservation system, detailed road shoulder parking limits and enhanced parking enforcement in order to combat the negative externalities caused by Muir Woods.

However, according to the Mount Tam Task Force, created to address the traffic concerns created by Muir Woods, the policy aimed towards fixing the issue has proved ineffective. The introduction of a website where all parking and shuttle reservations can be made, has helped to decongest the traffic to an extent. Despite the number of attending visitors trending downward at Muir Woods, parking and congestion remain a problem for tourists and locals alike.

== Surrounding ecosystems ==
According to the National Parks Conservation Association, in an attempt to protect the wildlife and environment of Muir Woods, which is given certain protections due to the Antiquities Act, it is necessary to take care of the ecosystems of surrounding areas outside of park boundaries that have impacts on the wildlife and ecosystems within the park. As a result, the park is involved in restoration and conservation efforts in Redwood Creek at the Banducci Flower Farm site, which is managed by the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and at Big Lagoon, which is outside the monument at Muir Beach, to improve ecosystem health and salmonid habitat. These efforts typically require a mixture of effort from the National Park Service, federal, state, and local governments; and even private landowners. The restoration efforts in surrounding areas outside of Muir Woods have helped to protect and restore the habitats of wildlife and fish such as coho salmon and the northern spotted owl.

The National Park Service and the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy have worked together to restore the last 1/2 mile of the Redwood Creek before it enters the Pacific Ocean. Before restoration efforts, the Redwood Creek mouth functioned poorly in conveying water and sediment from a nine square mile watershed to the ocean. The National Park Service claims that for over 100 years agriculture, logging, and road-building increased the erosion and degradation of the creek. As a result, local species of coho salmon and steelhead trout were threatened. Moreover, due to the poor state of Redwood Creek, even moderate and slight storms would cause flooding leaving residents flooded and local roads untraversable. While technically within the protected lands of Muir Woods, the poor state of Redwood Creek was having negative effects on wildlife and the ability to travel to Muir Woods. The efforts to restore Redwood Creek illustrate a way in which the government protection of Muir Woods leads to positive benefits for the surrounding area.

==Music==
American keyboardist and composer George Duke composed &quot;Muir Woods Suite&quot; in 1993. The Suite, a major orchestral piece, was premiered and recorded live at the Montreux Jazz Festival.
Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu composed a three movement solo classical guitar piece called &quot;In the Woods&quot; in 1995. The third movement of the piece is called Muir Woods and it was inspired in this forest.

==In fiction==
Characters played by James Stewart and Kim Novak visit the Muir Woods National Monument in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1958 film &quot;Vertigo&quot;; however, the scene was actually shot in Big Basin Redwoods State Park. The monument was a setting in &quot;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&quot; (2011), &quot;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&quot; (2014) and the first act of &quot;War for the Planet of the Apes&quot; (2017), though all three films were in fact filmed in British Columbia. Jack Kerouac discusses hiking though Muir Woods in his 1958 novel &quot;The Dharma Bums. It appears in the Big Hero 6: The Series&quot;, set in an alternate history that San Francisco was under much Japanese influence after the 1906 earthquake, as &quot;Muirahara Woods&quot; in the eponymous episode.

The palace gives its name to the Court of St James&#x27;s, which is the monarch&#x27;s royal court, and is located in the City of Westminster. Although no longer the principal residence of the monarch, it is the ceremonial meeting place of the Accession Council, the office of the Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps, and the London residence of several members of the royal family.

Built by order of King Henry VIII in the 1530s on the site of an isolated leper hospital dedicated to Saint James the Less, the palace was secondary in importance to the Palace of Whitehall for most Tudor and Stuart monarchs. Initially surrounded by a deer park and gardens, it was generally used as a hunting lodge and as a retreat from the formal court and occasionally as a royal guest house. After the Palace of Whitehall burned down, the palace took on administrative functions for the monarchy. It increased in importance during the reigns of the Hanoverian monarchs but began to be displaced by Buckingham Palace in the early 19th century. After decades of being used increasingly only for formal occasions, the move was formalised by Queen Victoria in 1837. 

The palace now houses a number of offices, official societies and collections, and all ambassadors and high commissioners to the United Kingdom are still accredited to the Court of St James&#x27;s. The palace&#x27;s Chapel Royal is still used for functions of the British royal family. Official receptions are also regularly hosted at the palace.

The palace was mainly built between 1531 and 1536 in red brick, and its architecture is primarily Tudor in style. The Queen&#x27;s Chapel was added in the 1620s, and Clarence House was built on palace grounds directly next to the Palace in the 1820s. A fire in 1809 destroyed parts of the palace, including the monarch&#x27;s private apartments, which were never replaced. Some 17th-century interiors survive, but most were remodelled in the 19th century.

==History==
===Tudors===
The palace was commissioned by Henry VIII on the remote site of a former leper hospital dedicated to Saint James the Less. He first used it as a hunting lodge for his newly enclosed deer park, St. James&#x27;s Park. The new palace, secondary in the king&#x27;s interest to Henry&#x27;s Whitehall Palace, was constructed between 1531 and 1536 as a smaller residence to escape formal court life. Much smaller than the nearby Whitehall, St James&#x27;s is arranged around four courtyards, the Colour Court, the Ambassador&#x27;s Court, the Engine Court, and the Friary Court. The four courts remain enclosed, except for Friary Court, which in modern times is only enclosed by apartments on three sides, with the fourth side open to Marlborough Road to accommodate public gatherings. The most recognisable feature of the palace is the north gatehouse; constructed with four storeys, the gatehouse has two crenellated flanking octagonal towers at its corners, and a central clock dominating the uppermost floor and gable; the clock is a later addition and dates from 1731, refurbished 1834. The palace is decorated with the initials &quot;H.A.&quot; for Henry and his second wife, Anne Boleyn. Henry had the palace constructed in red brick, with detail picked out in darker brick.

The palace was remodelled in 1544, with ceilings painted by Hans Holbein and was described as a &quot;pleasant royal house&quot;. Two of Henry VIII&#x27;s children died at Saint James&#x27;s, Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset, and Mary I. Elizabeth I often resided at the palace, and is said to have spent the night there while waiting for the Spanish Armada to sail up the Channel.

===Stuarts===

Prince Henry, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of King James and Anne of Denmark, lived at St James&#x27;s Palace until his death in 1612. The gardens were improved for him by Alphonsus Fowle. A riding school, one of the first in England, was built for Henry at St James&#x27;s Palace between 1607 and 1609, and then a library with sculptural decoration by Maximilian Colt. Henry also installed a menagerie with pet birds including a pair of ostriches.

Charles II was born at the palace on 29 May 1630; his parents were Charles I, who ruled the three kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland, and Henrietta Maria, the sister of the French king Louis XIII. James II, the second surviving son of King Charles I and Henrietta Maria, was born at the palace on 14 October 1633.

In 1638, Charles I gave the palace to Marie de Medici, the mother of Henrietta Maria. Marie remained in the palace for three years, but the residence of a Catholic former queen of France proved unpopular with parliament and she was soon asked to leave for Cologne. Charles spent his final night at St James&#x27;s before his execution. Oliver Cromwell then took it over, and turned it into barracks during the English Commonwealth period.

The palace was restored by Charles II following the demise of the Commonwealth, landscaping St James&#x27;s Park at the same time. Mary II and Anne, Queen of Great Britain, were both born at the palace. It became the principal residence of the monarch in London in 1698, during the reign of William III, after Whitehall Palace was destroyed by fire, and became the administrative centre of the monarchy, a role it retains, in part. Also, at the time of the loss of Whitehall, the Chapel Royal moved its base into the castle chapel at St. James&#x27;s.

===Hanoverians===

The first two monarchs of the House of Hanover used St James&#x27;s Palace as their principal London residence. George I and George II both housed their mistresses, the Duchess of Kendal and the Countess of Suffolk respectively, at the palace. In 1757, George II donated the Palace library to the British Museum; this gift was the first part of what later became the Royal Collection.

George III found St James&#x27;s unsuitable. The Tudor palace was regarded as uncomfortable and its now built up area as not affording its residents enough privacy, or the space to withdraw from the court into family life. In 1762, shortly after his wedding, George purchased Buckingham Housethe predecessor to Buckingham Palacefor his queen, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. In 1809, a fire destroyed part of St James&#x27;s Palace, including the monarch&#x27;s private apartments at the south-east corner. These apartments were not replaced, leaving the Queen&#x27;s Chapel isolated from the rest of the palace by an open area, where Marlborough Road now runs between the two buildings. The royal family began spending the majority of their time at Buckingham House, with St James&#x27;s used for only formal occasions; thrice-weekly levées and public audiences were still held there. In the late 18th century, George III refurbished the state apartments but neglected the living quarters. The last monarch to take up residence at St. James&#x27;s, at least part of the year, was William IV. He had earlier built Clarence House on adjacent palace grounds and connecting it to the palace. Queen Victoria formalised the move in 1837, ending the status of St James&#x27;s as the primary residence of the monarch; it became used during her reign as a venue for courts, levees and other ceremonies. It was nevertheless where Victoria married her husband, Prince Albert, in 1840, and where, eighteen years later, their eldest child, Princess Victoria married her husband, Prince Frederick of Prussia.

===20th century===
In 1912–1913 the palace was the venue for the international conference that arranged the treaty between the Balkan states and the Ottoman Empire following the two Balkan Wars. Edward VIII when Prince of Wales used the palace as his &#x27;town&#x27; residence until he moved into Marlborough House, and George VI as Duke of York resided there prior to his marriage in 1923. The Second Round Table Conference (September–December 1931), pertaining to Indian independence, was held at the palace. On 12 June 1941, Representatives of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and of the exiled governments of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Yugoslavia, as well as General Charles de Gaulle of France, met and signed the Declaration of St James&#x27;s Palace, which was the first of six treaties signed that established the United Nations and composed the Charter of the United Nations.

===Proclamation Gallery===

The Proclamation Gallery is a part of St James&#x27;s Palace, and it is used after the death of a reigning monarch. The Accession Council meets to declare the new monarch. Once the monarch has made a sacred oath to the council, the Garter King of Arms steps onto the Proclamation Gallery, which overlooks Friary Court, to proclaim the new monarch. Such an event last occurred on 10 September 2022 at the proclamation of King Charles III. To allow the Garter King of Arms and the trumpeters access to the balcony, workers removed the centre window the prior day and installed a temporary door.

==Today==

St James&#x27;s Palace is still a working palace, and the Royal Court is still formally based there, despite the monarch residing elsewhere. It is also the London residence of Princess Anne, Princess Beatrice, and Princess Alexandra. The palace is used to host official receptions, such as those of visiting heads of state, and charities of which members of the royal family are patrons. It forms part of a sprawling complex of buildings housing Court offices and officials&#x27; apartments. The immediate palace complex includes York House, the former home of Charles III and his sons, Princes William and Harry. Lancaster House, located next door, is used by HM Government for official receptions, and the attached Clarence House, the former home of the Queen Mother, is the residence of King Charles III and Queen Camilla. The palace also served as the official residence of Princess Eugenie until April 2018.

The nearby Queen&#x27;s Chapel, built by Inigo Jones, although since the 19th century across Marlborough Road, is still considered part of the Palace. While the Queen&#x27;s Chapel is open to the public at selected times, the Chapel Royal in the palace is not accessible to the public. They both remain active places of worship.

The offices of the Royal Collection Department, the Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps, the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, the Chapel Royal, the Gentlemen at Arms, the Yeomen of the Guard and the King&#x27;s Watermen are all housed at St James&#x27;s Palace. Since the beginning of the 2000s, the Royal Philatelic Collection has been housed at St James&#x27;s Palace, after spending the entire 20th century at Buckingham Palace.

On 1 June 2007, the palace, Clarence House and other buildings within its curtilage (other than public pavement on Marlborough Road) were designated as a protected site for the purposes of Section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, making it a specific criminal offence for a person to trespass into the site.

<text>The Opera Game was a chess game played in 1858 at an opera house in Paris. The American master Paul Morphy played against two amateurs: the German noble Karl II, Duke of Brunswick, and the French aristocrat Comte Isouard de Vauvenargues. It was played as a , with Duke Karl and Count Isouard jointly deciding each move for the black pieces, while Morphy controlled the white pieces by himself. The game was played in a box while an opera was performed on stage. Morphy quickly his opponents following rapid and of , including a queen sacrifice.

It is among the most famous of chess games. The game is often used by chess instructors to teach the importance of piece development, the value of sacrifices in mating , and other concepts. 
==The game==
White: Paul Morphy Black: Duke of Brunswick and Count Isouard Opening: Philidor Defence (&quot;ECO&quot; C41) Paris, October/November 1858

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6
:This is Philidor&#x27;s Defence, named after François-André Danican Philidor, the leading chess master of the second half of the 18th century and a pioneer of modern chess strategy. He was also a noted opera composer. It is a solid opening, but slightly passive, and it ignores the important d4-square. Most modern players prefer 2...Nc6 or 2...Nf6, Petrov&#x27;s Defence.

3. d4 Bg4
:Though common at the time, 3...Bg4 is now considered inferior. Bobby Fischer, in his analysis of the game, called it a weak move. Today 3...exd4 or 3...Nf6 are more commonly played. Philidor&#x27;s original idea, 3...f5, is a risky alternative.

4. dxe5 Bxf3
:If 4...dxe5, then 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8 6.Nxe5 and White wins a pawn and Black has lost the ability to castle, and White is threatening Nxf7+ winning the rook. If 4...Qe7, White remains a pawn up with 5.Qd5. Black, however, did have the option of 4...Nd7 5.exd6 Bxd6. In this position, Black is down a pawn but has some compensation in the form of better development.

5. Qxf3
:Steinitz&#x27;s recommendation 5.gxf3 dxe5 6.Qxd8+ Kxd8 7.f4 is also good, but Morphy prefers to keep the queens on. After Black recaptures the pawn on e5, White has a significant lead in development. A with the queen is the most natural as it keeps a healthy .

5...dxe5 6. Bc4 Nf6
:This seemingly sound developing move runs into a surprising . After White&#x27;s next move, both f7 and b7 will be under attack. Better would have been to directly protect the f7-pawn with 6...Qd7 or 6...Qf6, making White&#x27;s next move less potent.
7. Qb3 Qe7 (diagram)
:Black&#x27;s only reasonable move. White was threatening mate in two, for example, 7...Nc6 8.Bxf7+ Ke7 (or Kd7) 9.Qe6#. 7...Qd7 loses the rook to 8.Qxb7 followed by 9.Qxa8 (since 8...Qc6? would lose the queen to 9.Bb5).

:Although this move prevents immediate disaster, Black blocks the f8-bishop, impeding development and castling.

8. Nc3
:Morphy could have won a pawn by 8.Qxb7 Qb4+ 9.Qxb4 Bxb4+. White can also win more material with 8.Bxf7+ Qxf7 9.Qxb7, but Black has dangerous counterplay after 9...Bc5 and 10.Qxa8 0-0, or 10.Qc8+ Ke7 11.Qxh8 Bxf2+!. &quot;But that would have been a butcher’s method, not an artist&#x27;s.&quot; (Lasker). In keeping with his style, Morphy prefers rapid development and initiative over material.

8... c6
:The best move, allowing Black to defend his pawn while strengthening the , which have already been weakened by Black trading off his light-square bishop.

9. Bg5 b5?
:Black attempts to drive away the bishop and gain some , but this move allows Morphy a strong sacrifice to keep the initiative. This move loses but it is difficult to find anything better; for example 9...Na6 10.Bxf6 gxf6 11.Bxa6 bxa6 12.Qa4 Qb7 and Black&#x27;s position is very weak.

10. Nxb5!
:Morphy chooses not to retreat the bishop, which would allow Black to gain time for development. 

10... cxb5
:Black could have prolonged the game by playing 10...Qb4+, forcing the exchange of queens, but White wins comfortably after either 11.Nc3 or 11.Qxb4 Bxb4+ 12.c3!

11. Bxb5+
:Not 11.Bd5? Qb4+, unpinning the knight and allowing the rook to evade capture.

11... Nbd7 
:11...Kd8 holds out longer, but 12.0-0-0+ still gives White a winning attack.
12. 0-0-0 Rd8 (diagram)
:The combination of the pins on the knights and the open file for White&#x27;s rook will lead to Black&#x27;s defeat. 

13. Rxd7 Rxd7
:Removing another defender.

14. Rd1
:White&#x27;s piece activity is in marked contrast to Black&#x27;s passivity. Black&#x27;s d7-rook cannot be saved, since it is pinned to the king by the bishop and attacked by the rook, and though the knight defends it, the knight is pinned to the queen.

14... Qe6
:Qe6 is a futile attempt to unpin the knight (allowing it to defend the rook) and offer a queen trade, to take some pressure out of the white attack. Even if Morphy did not play his next crushing move, he could have always traded his bishop for the knight, followed by winning the rook.

15. Bxd7+ Nxd7
:If 15...Qxd7, then 16.Qb8+ Ke7 17.Qxe5+ Kd8 18.Bxf6+ gxf6 19.Qxf6+ Kc8 20.Rxd7 Kxd7 21.Qxh8 and White is clearly winning. Moving the king leads to mate: 15...Ke7 16.Qb4+ Qd6 (16...Kd8 17.Qb8+ Ke7 18.Qe8#) 17.Qxd6+ Kd8 18.Qb8+ Ke7 19.Qe8# or 15...Kd8 16.Qb8+ Ke7 17.Qe8#.

16. Qb8+!
:Morphy finishes with a queen sacrifice.

16... Nxb8 17. Rd8 

This mating pattern is sometimes called the &quot;opera mate&quot; in reference to this game. Other than the king, all of White&#x27;s remaining pieces play a role in the checkmate. Therefore, the position satisfies the definition of an economical mate. Economical mate is one of a few terms used by chess problem composers to describe the aesthetic properties of a checkmate position; related concepts include pure mate, model mate, and ideal mate. The final position nearly satisfies the criteria of a model mate, but fails for one reason: there are two reasons why the black king cannot be moved to the square f8. It is occupied by a bishop of the same color, and it is guarded by the white rook.

<text>Aelia Paetina or Paetina () was the second wife of the Roman Emperor Claudius. Her biological father was a consul of 4 AD, Sextus Aelius Catus, while her mother is unknown.

== Family ==
She was born into the family of the Aelii Tuberones, and thus apparently descended from the consul of 11 BC, Q. Aelius Tubero. Her father may have died when she was very young, as she was raised by a relative—Praetorian Guard Prefect Lucius Seius Strabo, the biological father of her adoptive brother Lucius Aelius Sejanus, commander of the Praetorian Guard under the Emperor Tiberius.

Aelia Paetina married the future Emperor Claudius in 28 as his second wife. Their only child was their daughter Claudia Antonia, born in 30. Claudius divorced Paetina after October of 31 AD, when her adoptive brother fell from power and was murdered. According to Suetonius, Claudius divorced Paetina for slight offenses. It has been further suggested by Leon that these slight offenses could more specifically refer to &quot;mental cruelty&quot; towards Claudius.

In 48, after the execution of Claudius’ third wife Valeria Messalina, Claudius considered marrying for the fourth time. Claudius’ freedman Tiberius Claudius Narcissus suggested to him a remarriage to Paetina, and reminded him they had a child together. Narcissus also stated that Paetina would cherish Antonia in addition to Claudia Octavia and Britannicus, Claudius’ children with Messalina. But another freedman, Gaius Julius Callistus, was against Claudius remarrying Paetina and stated to Claudius that he divorced her before; Callistus said that remarrying Paetina would make her more arrogant. Callistus suggested Lollia Paulina, Caligula&#x27;s third wife. The third freedman, Marcus Antonius Pallas, recommended Claudius&#x27; niece and Caligula&#x27;s sister Agrippina the Younger, who also had a child from a previous marriage, the future Emperor Nero. Ultimately, Agrippina was chosen.

==Cultural depictions==
Paetina was played by Liane Aukin in the 1976 television series &quot;I, Claudius&quot;.

<text>Call My Bluff is a British panel game show based on the short-lived US version of the same name. It was originally hosted by Robin Ray and later, most notably, by Robert Robinson. Its most prominent panellist was Frank Muir. The theme music for the show was &quot;Ciccolino&quot; by Norrie Paramor.

==Format==
The game comprised two teams of three (a captain and two guests) who would compete to earn points by identifying the correct definitions of obscure words. The teams took turns to give three definitions, one true and two bluffs, while the other team attempted to determine which was correct. If the correct choice was made the team earned one point, if not, the bluffing team earned one point. Both teams took turns bluffing and determining definitions.

Examples of words used in the show, taken from a 1972 book published in connection with it, include &quot;queach&quot;, &quot;strongle&quot;, &quot;ablewhacket&quot;, &quot;hickboo&quot;, &quot;jargoon&quot;, &quot;zurf&quot;, &quot;morepork&quot;, and &quot;jirble&quot;. The word &quot;queach&quot; was defined by the contestants as &quot;a malicious caricature&quot;, &quot;a cross between a quince and a peach&quot; and &quot;a mini-jungle of mixed vegetation&quot; (with the last definition being the true one).

==Broadcast history==
&quot;Call My Bluff&quot; originally aired on BBC2 from 17 October 1965 to 22 December 1988.

Robert Morley and Frank Muir captained the teams. Morley was later succeeded by Patrick Campbell, and Arthur Marshall took over in 1981 following Campbell&#x27;s death. Various celebrities also stood in as team captains, including Kenneth Horne, Kenneth Williams and Alan Melville. The original series finished after Marshall&#x27;s death, although a general change in the tone and atmosphere of broadcasting at the time may also have affected its temporary demise. For the majority of this run (from 1967 onwards) the host was Robert Robinson.

The show was resurrected in 1996 after an eight-year rest (apart from one special edition on 16 April 1994 for BBC Two&#x27;s thirtieth birthday, which still featured Robert Robinson, but this time with Joanna Lumley as a team captain opposite Frank Muir), now as a daytime series on BBC1. It began airing on 13 May 1996 with Alan Coren and Sandi Toksvig as the team captains and Bob Holness replacing Robinson as chairman.

In 2003, Toksvig was replaced by the journalist Rod Liddle, and newsreader Fiona Bruce took the chair. The series finished again on 18 June 2004.

&quot;Call My Bluff&quot; returned for a special during the BBC&#x27;s &quot;24 Hour Panel People&quot; in aid of &quot;Comic Relief 2011&quot;, with Alex Horne, Roisin Conaty, Russell Tovey, Tim Key, Sarah Cawood and David Walliams participating. The host was Angus Deayton.

<text>Johann &quot;Hans&quot; Joseph Kmoch (July 25, 1894 – February 13, 1973) was an Austrian-Dutch-American chess International Master (1950), International Arbiter (1951), and a chess journalist and author, for which he is best known.

== Playing career ==
Kmoch had most of his best competitive results between 1925 and 1931. He won at Debrecen 1925 with 10/13 over a field which had 12 of the world&#x27;s top 56 players; chessmetrics.com rates this as a 2696 performance. At Budapest 1926, he shared 3rd–5th places with 9/15 behind winners Ernst Gruenfeld and Mario Monticelli. Kmoch shared 2nd–3rd places at Kecskemét 1927 with 6/9 behind the winner, World Chess Champion Alexander Alekhine. At Vienna 1928, Kmoch placed 6th with 8/13 as Richard Reti won. Then at the Trebitsch Memorial, Vienna 1928, Kmoch shared 3rd–6th places with 6/10, half a point behind Gruenfeld and Sandor Takacs. At Brno 1928, Kmoch placed 3rd with 6/9, with Reti and Friedrich Saemisch winning. Kmoch won at Ebensee 1930 with 6/7, ahead of Erich Eliskases.

Kmoch represented Austria three times in chess Olympiads. His detailed results, according to olimpbase.org: at London 1927, he played board three and scored 6½/12 (+4−3=5); at Hamburg 1930, he was on board one, and scored 8/14 (+6−4=4), as Austria placed fourth; then at Prague 1931, Kmoch was on board three and scored 9/15 (+4−1=10). Overall, he scored 23½/41 (+14−8=19), for 57.3 percent.

His last good tournament result was 2nd at Baarn 1941 with 5½/7, behind Max Euwe. Kmoch stopped playing competitively after this tournament to focus on chess writing and management of chess events.

== Writing career ==
Kmoch had written for the magazine &quot;Wiener Schachzeitung&quot; from the early 1920s. His &quot;Die Kunst der Verteidigung&quot; (&quot;The Art of Defence&quot;) was the first chess book devoted to this subject. In 1930, Kmoch updated the Bilguier openings handbook, and wrote the tournament book for the Carlsbad 1929 event.

In 1929 and 1934, Kmoch served as Alexander Alekhine&#x27;s second in his world championship matches against Efim Bogoljubow. Kmoch and his Jewish wife Trudy lived in the Netherlands from 1932 to 1947. Kmoch also served as Alekhine&#x27;s second in the 1935 title match against Max Euwe, and he wrote a book on the match. In 1941, he wrote a book on the best games of Akiba Rubinstein.

After World War II ended, Kmoch and his wife moved to the United States, settling in New York City. Kmoch served as the Secretary and manager of the Manhattan Chess Club, and directed tournaments. He also wrote for &quot;Chess Review&quot;, then one of the leading American chess magazines.

In 1956, he wrote his most famous book, &quot;Pawn Power in Chess&quot; (German: &quot;Die Kunst der Bauernführung&quot;), which is notorious for its use of neologisms (&quot;ram&quot;, &quot;lever&quot;, &quot;sweeper&quot;, &quot;sealer&quot;, &quot;quartgrip&quot;, &quot;monochromy&quot;, etc.).

<text>A function key is a key on a computer or terminal keyboard that can be programmed to cause the operating system or an application program to perform certain actions, a form of soft key. On some keyboards/computers, function keys may have default actions, accessible on power-on.

Function keys on a terminal may either generate short fixed sequences of characters, often beginning with the escape character (ASCII 27), or the characters they generate may be configured by sending special character sequences to the terminal. On a standard computer keyboard, the function keys may generate a fixed, single byte code, outside the normal ASCII range, which is translated into some other configurable sequence by the keyboard device driver or interpreted directly by the application program. Function keys may have abbreviations or pictographic representations of default actions printed on/besides them, or they may have the more common &quot;F-number&quot; designations.

==History==
The Singer/Friden 2201 Flexowriter Programmatic, introduced in 1965, had a cluster of 13 function keys, labeled F1 to F13 to the right of the main keyboard. Although the Flexowriter could be used as a computer terminal, this electromechanical typewriter was primarily intended as a stand-alone word processing system. The interpretation of the function keys was determined by the programming of a plugboard inside the back of the machine.

Soft keys date to avionics multi-function displays of military planes of the late 1960s/early 1970s, such as the Mark II avionics of the F-111D (first ordered 1967, delivered 1970–1973). In computing use, they were found on the HP 9810A calculator (1971) and later models of the HP 9800 series, which featured 10 programmable keys in 5×2 block (2 rows of 5 keys) at the top left of the keyboard, with paper labels. The HP 9830A (1972) was an early desktop computer, and one of the earliest specifically computing uses. HP continued its use of function keys in the HP 2640 (1975), which used screen-labeled function keys, placing the keys close to the screen, where labels could be displayed for their function.

NEC&#x27;s PC-8001, introduced in 1979, featured five function keys at the top of the keyboard, along with a numeric keypad on the right-hand side of the keyboard.

Their modern use may have been popularized by IBM keyboards: first the IBM 3270 terminals, then the IBM PC. IBM use of function keys dates to the IBM 3270 line of terminals, specifically the IBM 3277 (1972) with 78-key typewriter keyboard or operator console keyboard version, which both featured 12 &quot;programmed function&quot; (PF) keys in a 3×4 matrix at the right of the keyboard. Later models replaced this with a numeric keypad, and moved the function keys to 24 keys at the top of the keyboard. The original IBM PC keyboard (PC/XT, 1981) had 10 &quot;function keys&quot; (F1–F10) in a 2×5 matrix at the left of the keyboard; this was replaced by 12 keys in 3 blocks of 4 at the top of the keyboard in the Model M (&quot;Enhanced&quot;, 1984).

==Schemes on various keyboards==
* Mac: The classic Mac OS supported system extensions known generally as FKEYS which could be installed in the System file and could be accessed with a Command-Shift-(number) keystroke combination (Command-Shift-3 was the screen capture function included with the system, and was installed as an FKEY); however, early Macintosh keyboards did not support numbered function keys in the normal sense. Since the introduction of the Apple Extended Keyboard with the Macintosh II, however, keyboards with function keys have been available, though they did not become standard until the mid-1990s. They have not traditionally been a major part of the Mac user interface, however, and are generally only used on cross-platform programs. According to the Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines, they are reserved for customization by the user. Current Mac keyboards include specialized function keys for controlling sound volume. The most recent Mac keyboards include 19 function keys, but keys F1–F4 and F7–F12 by default control features such as volume, media control, and Exposé. Former keyboards and Apple Keyboard with numeric keypad has the F1–F19 keys.
* Mac laptops: Function keys were not standard on Apple notebook hardware until the introduction of the PowerBook 5300 and the PowerBook 190. For the most part, Mac laptops have keys F1 through F12, with pre-defined actions for some, including controlling sound volume and screen brightness.
* Apricot PC/Xi: six unlabelled keys, each with an LED beside it which illuminates when the key can be used; above the keys is a liquid crystal display—the &#x27;microscreen&#x27;—that is used by programs to display the action performed by the key.
* Atari 8-bit computers: four dedicated keys (Reset, Option, Select, Start) at the right hand side or on the top of the keyboard; the XL models also had a Help key. Atari 1200XL has four additional keys labeled F1 through F4 with pre-defined actions, mainly related to cursor movement.
* Atari ST: ten parallelogram-shaped keys in a horizontal row across the top of the keyboard, inset into the keyboard frame instead of popping up like normal keys.
* BBC Micro: red/orange keys &quot;F&quot; to &quot;F&quot; in a horizontal row above the number keys on top of the computer/keyboard. The break, arrow, and copy keys could function as F10–F15. The case included a transparent plastic strip above them to hold a function key reference card.
* Coleco Adam: six dark brown keys in a horizontal row above the number keys, labeled with Roman numerals I–VI.
* VIC-20 and Commodore 64: F1/F2 to F7/F8 in a vertical row of four keys descending on the computer/keyboard&#x27;s right hand side, odd-numbered functions accessed unshifted, even-numbered shifted; orange, beige/brown, or grey key color, depending on VIC/64 model/revision.
* Commodore 128: essentially same as VIC-20/C64, but with (grey) function keys placed in a horizontal row above the numeric keypad right of the main QWERTY-keyboard; also had Help key.
* Commodore Amiga: ten keys arranged in a row of two five-key groups across the top of the keyboard (flush with the ordinary keyboard top row); function keys are 1½ times the width of ordinary keys. Like the Commodore 128, this also had a Help key.
* Graphing calculators, particularly those from Texas Instruments, Hewlett-Packard and Casio, usually include a row of function keys with various preassigned functions (on a standard hand-held calculator, these would be the top row of buttons under the screen). On low-end models such as the TI-83-series, these function mainly as an extension of the main keyboard, but on high-end calculators the functions change with the mode, sometimes acting as menu navigation keys as well.
* HP 2640 series terminals (1975): first known instance—late 1970s—of screen-labeled function keys (where keys are placed in proximity or mapped to labels on CRT or LCD screen).
* HP 9830: F1–F8 on two rows of four in upper left with paper template label. An early use of function keys (1972).
* IBM 3270: probably the origin of function keys on keyboards, circa 1972. On this mainframe keyboard early models had 12 function keys in a 3×4 matrix at the right of the keyboard; later that changed to a numeric keypad, and the function keys moved to the top of the keyboard, and increased to 24 keys in two rows.

* IBM 5250: early models frequently had a &quot;cmd&quot; modifier key, by which the numeric row keys emulate function keys; later models have either 12 function keys in groups of 4 (with shifted keys acting as F13–F24), or 24 in two rows. These keys, along with &quot;Enter&quot;, &quot;Help&quot;, and several others, generate &quot;AID codes&quot;, informing the host computer that user-entered data is ready to be read.
* IBM PC AT and PS/2 keyboard: F1 to F12 usually in three 4-key groups across the top of the keyboard. The original IBM PC and PC XT keyboards had function keys F1 through F10, in two adjacent vertical columns on the left hand side; F1|F2, F3|F4, ..., F9|F10, descending. Some IBM compatible keyboards, e.g., the Northgate OmniKey/102, also featured function keys on the left, which on examples with swapped left Alt and Caps Lock keys, facilitate fingers of a single hand simultaneously striking modifier key(s) and function keys swiftly and comfortably by touch even by those with small hands. Many modern PC keyboards also include specialized keys for multimedia and operating system functions.
* MCK-142 Pro: two sets of function keys: F1–F12 at the left side of the keyboard and additionally 24 user programmable PF keys located above QWERTY keys.
* NEC PC-8000 Series (1979): five function keys at the top of the keyboard, along with a numeric keypad on the right-hand side of the keyboard.
* Sharp MZ-700: blue keys F1 to F5 in a horizontal row across the top left side of the keyboard, the keys are vertically half the size of ordinary keys and twice the width; there is also a dedicated &quot;slot&quot; for changeable key legend overlays (paper/plastic) above the function key row.
* VT100 terminals: four function keys (PF1 - PF4) above the numeric keypad.

==Action on various programs and operating systems==

===Mac OS===
In the classic Mac OS, the function keys could be configured by the user, with the Function Keys control panel, to start a program or run an AppleScript.

macOS assigns default functionality to (almost) all the function keys from to , but the actions assigned by default to these function keys have changed a couple of times over the history of Mac products and corresponding Mac OS X versions. As a consequence, the labels on Macintosh keyboards have changed over time to reflect the newer mappings of later Mac OS X versions: for instance, on a 2006 MacBook Pro, functions keys , and are labelled for volume down/volume up, whereas on later MacBook Pros (starting with the 2007 model), the volume controls are located on function keys to where they are mapped to various functions.

Any recent version of Mac OS X or macOS is able to detect which generation of Apple keyboard is being used, and to assign proper default actions corresponding to the labels shown on this Apple keyboard (provided that this keyboard was manufactured &quot;before&quot; the release of the version of Mac OS X being used). As a result, default mappings are sometimes wrong (i.e., not matching the labels shown on the keyboard) when using a recent USB Apple keyboard on an older version of Mac OS X, which doesn&#x27;t know about the new function key mapping of this keyboard (e.g., because Mission control and Launchpad didn&#x27;t exist at that time, the corresponding labels shown on the keyboard can&#x27;t match the default actions assigned by older versions of Mac OS X, which were Exposé and Dashboard).

It can be noted that: 
* all function keys have been changed over time, to the exception of and who have always been mapped to brightness control.
* all Apple laptops after 2007 are missing any Num Lock key, even if they lack a keypad (the Num Lock was previously located on the key on older Apple laptops).
* the special key for ejection of disks (which was located at the right of the key on older Apple keyboards) has been removed from Apple computers since they don&#x27;t have an internal optical disk drive any more, to the exception of the MacBook Air 2010, which had disk ejection labelled on its key (for use in combination with an external USB SuperDrive).
* function keys to have no labels; they were only available on full keyboards of fixed Apple computers (iMac, Mac Pro, or Mac Mini). All laptop computers have always lacked these extra keys, as well as any recent fixed Apple computer equipped with wireless Apple keyboard.
* function key is mapped to show desktop (Mission Control shortcut) and function keys and are mapped by default to decrease/increase contrast (although nothing is labelled on these keys on Macintosh keyboards).
* on Boot Camp, function keys to are mapped to the corresponding IBM PC keys (which are located on the same place of the keyboard): Print Screen, Scroll Lock and Pause key
* on all versions of Mac OS X or macOS, software functions can be used by holding down the Fn key while pressing the appropriate function key, and this scheme can be reversed by changing the macOS system preferences.
* as of 2016, Apple has replaced the individual function keys with the touchbar on certain models of MacBook Pro.

===Windows/MS-DOS===
Under MS-DOS, individual programs could decide what each function key meant to them, and the command line had its own actions. For example, copied words from the previous command to the current command prompt.

Following the IBM Common User Access guidelines, the key gradually became universally associated with Help in most early Windows programs. To this day, Microsoft Office programs running in Windows list as the key for Help in the Help menu. Internet Explorer in Windows does not list this keystroke in the help menu, but still responds with a help window.

 is commonly used to activate a search function in applications, often cycling through results on successive presses of the key. + is often used to search backwards. Some applications such as Visual Studio support + as a means of searching for the currently highlighted text elsewhere in a document.

 is also commonly used as a reload key in many web browsers and other applications, while activates the full screen/kiosk mode on most browsers. Under the Windows environment, + is commonly used to quit an application; + will often close a portion of the application, such as a document or tab. generally activates the menu bar, while + activates a context menu. is used in many Windows applications such as Windows Explorer, Excel, Visual Studio and other programs to access file or field edit functions, such as renaming a file.

 is used in some applications to make the window &quot;fullscreen&quot;, like in &quot;3D Pinball: Space Cadet&quot;. In Microsoft IE, it is used to view the URL list of previously viewed websites.

Other function key assignments common to all Microsoft Office applications are: to check spelling, + to call the macros dialog, + to call the Visual Basic Editor and ++ to call the Script Editor. In Microsoft Word, + reveals formatting. In Microsoft PowerPoint, starts the slide show, and moves to the next pane.

 exits the MS-DOS Shell if it is running.

WordPerfect for DOS is an example of a program that made heavy use of function keys.

In Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7, opens Internet Explorer Developer Toolbar. highlights the URL in the address bar.

===BIOS/booting===
Function Keys are also heavily used in the BIOS interface. Generally during the power-on self-test, BIOS access can be gained by hitting either a function key or the key. In the BIOS keys can have different purposes depending on the BIOS. However, is the de facto standard for save and exit which saves all changes and restarts the system.

During Windows 10 startup, + is used to enter safe mode; in legacy versions of Microsoft Windows, the key was used alone.

<doc id="347386" wikidata="Q913760" url="?curid=347386" title="White eared pheasant">
<text>The white eared pheasant (Crossoptilon crossoptilon), also known as Dolan’s eared pheasant or Bee&#x27;s pheasant, is a species of &quot;eared pheasant&quot; that get its name because its colouration is white and has the prominent ear tufts of the genus, not because it has white ears. The indigenous people of Himalaya call it , meaning snow fowl. This gregarious bird lives in large flocks, foraging on alpine meadows close to or above the snowline throughout the year. &quot;C. crossoptilon&quot; is found in China(Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet) where it tends to inhabit mixed forests and can be found around Buddhist monasteries.

== Flight ==
White eared pheasants tend to fly a great deal more than their close relatives, such as the brown eared pheasant (&quot;C. mantchuricum&quot;) and the blue eared pheasant (&quot;C. auritum&quot;). All three species are capable of hovering or volplaning over deep snow, with the aid of their great, wide tails. Eared pheasants move across deep snow by whirring their wings and fluttering close to the ground, and supporting their weight on their rectrices. Eared pheasant flight was often described as poor by the hunter collectors of the 18th century, who used dogs to flush the birds from the ground for shooting. Eared pheasants do not waste their energy on flying when quadrupeds prey on them because they have adapted many defensive escape behaviors that do not require flight. They have a high aptitude for sustained flight — movements that only take them a few hundred yards at a time, but in the snowy seasons this is very useful. This ability to cover large distances by flight is reminiscent of ptarmigans, sage grouse, and Syrmaticus pheasants, all of which inhabit snowy regions and use sustained flight for feeding during winter. Characteristic of these species and &quot;C. crossoptilon&quot; is the lack of a prominent tailing wing notch.

== Diet ==
&quot;C. crossoptilon&quot; forages for tubers and roots in alpine meadows, often in the company of yaks or other hoofed stock. In winter, the white eared pheasant subsists on pine needles, juniper berries, wolf berries, and the desiccated seed pods of iris, lily, and allium. When hard-pressed during the most severe winter storms, which may blow for weeks at a time, eared pheasants may subsist upon pine pitch and deer, rabbit, and yak dung.

== Subspecies ==
While all known forms of white eared pheasant are very similar in phenotype, behavioral and genetic differences suggest much is available to learn about their systematic and behavioral ecology.

The Szechuan white eared pheasant, (&quot;C. c. crossoptilon)&quot;, is a galliform bird native to the Sichuan (Szechuan) region of China. It is a subspecies of white eared pheasant. This form inhabits high altitudes along exposed rockscapes and may descend to old-growth forests in winter. Its wings are dark-grey or violet.

This bird is predominantly white, including, as its name suggests, white ear tuffs, but is not as white in as many places of its body as its close relatives, the Tibetan white eared pheasant (&quot;C. c. drouyni)&quot; and the Yunnan white eared pheasant (&quot;C. c. lichiangnse)&quot;. It has black tail feathers and wingtips, and a patch of black at the top of its head. The primary feathers range from dark grey to brown. The part of its face not covered by feathers has red skin.

== Reproduction ==
The Szechuan white eared pheasant will not mate until it is two years old, then it will go into a heated breeding frenzy around the end of April. The breeding lasts until June and these pheasants usually produce four to seven eggs per clutch. The incubation period for eggs is 24–25 days.

Although not much sexual dimorphism exists among the Szechuan white eared pheasant, the cocks are considerably larger than the hens. They can reach a length of 86–96 cm and weigh 1400–2050 g for females and 2350–2750 g for males.

== Conservation status ==
The Szechuan white eared pheasant has now become a near-threatened species. Human development and encroaching on its habitat in agricultural China has reduced the range of the species, and hunting of these pheasants for food has threatened their numbers severely.

An estimated 6,700 to 33,000 individuals exist in the wild today. &quot;C. crossoptilon&quot; is informally protected by the area’s Tibetan Buddhist culture.

<text>The taille () was a direct land tax on the French peasantry and non-nobles in &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; France. The tax was imposed on each household and was based on how much land it held, and was paid directly to the state.

==History==
Originally only an &quot;exceptional&quot; tax (i.e. imposed and collected in times of need, as the king was expected to survive on the revenues of the &quot;domaine royal&quot;, or lands that belonged to him directly), the &quot;taille&quot; became permanent in 1439, when the right to collect taxes in support of a standing army was granted to Charles VII of France during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Unlike modern income taxes, the total amount of the &quot;taille&quot; was first set (after the Estates General was suspended in 1484) by the French king from year to year, and this amount was then apportioned among the various provinces for collection.

Exempted from the tax were clergy and nobles (except for non-noble lands they held in &quot;pays d&#x27;état&quot; [see below]), officers of the crown, military personnel, magistrates, university professors and students, and franchises (&quot;villes franches&quot;) such as Paris.

The provinces were of three sorts, the &quot;pays d&#x27;élection&quot;, the &quot;pays d&#x27;état&quot; and the &quot;pays d&#x27;imposition&quot;. In the &quot;pays d&#x27;élection&quot; (the longest held possessions of the French crown; some of these provinces had had the equivalent autonomy of a &quot;pays d&#x27;état&quot; in an earlier period, but had lost it through the effects of royal reforms) the assessment and collection of taxes were entrusted to elected officials (at least originally; later, these positions were bought), and the tax was generally &quot;personal&quot;, meaning it was attached to non-noble individuals. In the &quot;pays d&#x27;état&quot; (&quot;provinces with provincial estates&quot; Brittany, Languedoc, Burgundy, Auvergne, Béarn, Dauphiné, Provence, and such portions of Gascony as Bigorre, Comminges, and the Quatre-Vallées; these recently acquired provinces had been able to maintain a certain local autonomy in terms of taxation), the assessment of the tax was established by local councils and the tax was generally &quot;real&quot;, meaning that it was attached to non-noble lands (that is, even nobles possessing such lands were required to pay taxes on them). Finally, &quot;pays d&#x27;imposition&quot; were recently conquered lands which had their own local historical institutions (they were similar to the &quot;pays d&#x27;état&quot; under which they are sometimes grouped), although taxation was overseen by the royal intendant.

In an attempt to reform the fiscal system, new administrative divisions were created in the 16th century. The &quot;Recettes générales&quot;, commonly known as &quot;généralités&quot; and overseen in the beginning by &quot;receveurs généraux&quot; or &quot;généraux conseillers&quot; (royal tax collectors), were initially only taxation districts. Their role steadily increased and by the mid 17th century, the généralités were under the authority of an &quot;intendant&quot;, and they became a vehicle for the expansion of royal power in matters of justice, taxation, and policing. By the outbreak of the Revolution, there were 36 généralités; the last two were created as recently as 1784.

Until the late 17th century, tax collectors were called &quot;receveurs royaux&quot;. In 1680, the system of the &quot;Ferme Générale&quot; was established, a franchised customs and excise operation in which individuals bought the right to collect the &quot;taille&quot; on behalf of the king, through six-year adjudications (some taxes, including the &quot;aides&quot; and the &quot;gabelle&quot;, had been farmed out in this way as early as 1604). The major tax collectors in that system were known as the &quot;fermiers généraux&quot; (&quot;farmers-general&quot;, in English).

== Collection ==

Efficient tax collection was one of the major causes for French administrative and royal centralization in the Early Modern period. The &quot;taille&quot; became a major source of royal income (roughly half in the 1570s), the most important direct tax of pre-Revolutionary France, and provided for the growing cost of warfare in the 15th and 16th centuries. Records show the &quot;taille&quot; increasing from 2.5 million livres in 1515 to six million after 1551; in 1589 the &quot;taille&quot; reached a record 21 million livres (a period of high inflation), before dropping.

The &quot;taille&quot; was only one of a number of taxes. There also existed the &quot;taillon&quot; (a tax for military expenditures), a national salt tax (the gabelle), a tax on consumer goods usually used to pay for fortifications (the maltôte), national tariffs (the &quot;aides&quot;) on various products (including wine), local tariffs on specialty products (the &quot;douane&quot;) or levied on products entering the city (the &quot;octroi&quot;) or sold at fairs, and local taxes. Finally, the church benefited from a mandatory tax or tithe called the &quot;dîme&quot;.

Louis XIV created several additional tax systems, including the &quot;capitation&quot; (begun in 1695) which touched every person including nobles and the clergy (although exemption could be bought for a large one-time sum) and the &quot;dixième&quot; (1710–1717, restarted in 1733), which was a true tax on income and on property value and was meant to support the military. Every Frenchman, except the Dauphin of France and paupers were subject to the capitation tax. Noble capitation was assessed by the intendant of the generality, and at first it was established that the nobility pay 1/90 of their annual income. This was not always the case, however, as many of the nobility had the means to lobby against the tax, and regularly appeal the assessments. As capitation was paid at the place of residence, rich landlords with many estates, and those who lived in Paris or at the Court of Versailles, could evade it. The duc d&#x27;Orleans famously bragged about setting his own rate: &quot;I work things out with the intendants; I pay more or less what I like.&quot;

In 1749, under Louis XV, a new tax based on the &quot;dixième&quot;, the &quot;vingtième&quot; (or &quot;one-twentieth&quot;), was enacted to reduce the royal deficit, and this tax continued through the ancien régime. This tax was based solely on revenues (5% of net earnings from land, property, commerce, industry and from official offices), and was meant to reach all citizens regardless of status, but the clergy, the regions with &quot;pays d&#x27;état&quot; and the parlements protested; the clergy won exemption, the &quot;pays d&#x27;état&quot; won reduced rates, and the parlements halted new income statements, effectively making the &quot;vingtième&quot; a far less efficient tax than it was designed to be. The financial needs of the Seven Years&#x27; War led to a second (1756–1780), and then a third (1760–1763) &quot;vingtième&quot; being created. In 1754 the &quot;vingtième&quot; produced 11.7 million livres.

The &quot;taille&quot; was used very heavily by the French to fund their many wars like the Hundred Years&#x27; War and the Thirty Years&#x27; War. It eventually became one of the most hated taxes of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;.

<text>Emperor Wu of Jin (; 236 – 16 May 290), personal name Sima Yan (), courtesy name Anshi (安世), was a grandson of Sima Yi, nephew of Sima Shi and son of Sima Zhao. He became the first emperor of the Jin dynasty after forcing Cao Huan, last emperor of the state of Cao Wei, to abdicate to him. He reigned from 266 to 290, and after conquering the state of Eastern Wu in 280, was the emperor of a reunified China. Emperor Wu was also known for his extravagance and sensuality, especially after the unification of China; legends boasted of his incredible potency among ten thousand concubines.

Emperor Wu was commonly viewed as generous and kind, but also wasteful. His generosity and kindness undermined his rule, as he became overly tolerant of the noble families&#x27; (世族 or 士族, a political/bureaucratic landlord class from Eastern Han to Tang dynasty) corruption and wastefulness, which drained the people&#x27;s resources. Further, when Emperor Wu established the Jin Dynasty, he was concerned about his regime&#x27;s stability, and, believing that the predecessor state, Cao Wei, had been doomed by its failures to empower the princes of the imperial clan, he greatly empowered his uncles, his cousins, and his sons with authority, including independent military authority. This ironically led to the destabilization of the Western Jin, as the princes engaged in an internecine struggle known as the War of the Eight Princes soon after his death, and then the &quot;Five Barbarians&quot; uprisings that destroyed the Western Jin and forced its successor, Eastern Jin, to relocate to the region south of the Huai River.

==Life before establishment of the Jin Dynasty==
Sima Yan was born to Sima Zhao and his wife Wang Yuanji, daughter of the Confucian scholar Wang Su, in 236, as their oldest son. At that time, Sima Zhao was a mid-level official in the government of Cao Wei and a member of a privileged clan, as the son of the general Sima Yi. After Sima Yi seized power from the regent Cao Shuang in February 249 in the Incident at the Gaoping Tombs, Sima Zhao became more influential in the state. After his father&#x27;s death in September 251, Sima Zhao became the assistant to his brother, the new regent Sima Shi. After Sima Shi died in March 255, Sima Zhao became regent and the paramount authority in the Wei government.

Sima Yan&#x27;s first important appearance in history was in 260, when forces loyal to his father, led by Jia Chong, defeated an attempt by the Wei emperor Cao Mao to take back power and killed Cao Mao. At that time, as a mid-level army general, he was commissioned by his father to escort the new emperor Cao Huan (then still known as Cao Huang) from his dukedom to the capital Luoyang; Sima Yan went to Ye to receive Cao. After his father was created the Duke of Jin on 9 December 263 in light of the army&#x27;s conquest of Shu Han, he was named heir. However, at times Sima Zhao hesitated as to whether Sima Yan or his brother Sima You would be the more appropriate heir—as Sima You was considered talented and had also been adopted by Sima Shi, who had no biological sons of his own, and Sima Zhao, remembering his brother&#x27;s role in the Simas&#x27; takeover of power, thought it might be appropriate to return power to his branch of the clan. However, a number of high level officials favored Sima Yan, and Sima Zhao agreed. After Sima Zhao was created the King of Jin on 2 May 264 (thus reaching the penultimate step towards usurpation), Sima Yan was created the Crown Prince of Jin in June 265.

On 6 September 265, Sima Zhao died without having formally taken imperial authority. Sima Yan became the King of Jin by the next day. On 4 February 266, he forced Cao Huan to abdicate, ending the state of Cao Wei. Four days later, on 8 February 266, he declared himself emperor of the Jin dynasty.

==As Emperor of Jin==

===Early reign: establishment of the Jin political system===
Emperor Wu immediately sought to avoid what he saw as Cao Wei&#x27;s fatal weakness—lack of power among the imperial princes. In February 266, immediately after taking the throne, he made princes of many of his uncles, cousins, brothers, and sons, each with independent military commands and full authority within their principalities. This system, while it would be scaled back after the War of the Eight Princes and the loss of northern China, would remain in place as a Jin institution for the duration of the dynasty&#x27;s existence, and would be adopted by the succeeding Southern dynasties as well.

Another problem that Emperor Wu saw with Cao Wei&#x27;s political system was its harshness in penal law, and he sought to reform the penal system to make it more merciful—but the key beneficiaries of his changes turned out to be the nobles, as it quickly became clear that the mercy was being dealt out in an unequal manner. Nobles who committed crimes often received simple rebukes, while there were no meaningful reductions in penalties for commoners. This led to massive corruption and extravagant living by the nobles, while the poor went without government assistance. For example, in 267, when several high level officials were found to have worked in conjunction with a county magistrate to seize public land for themselves, Emperor Wu refused to punish the high level officials while punishing the county magistrate harshly.

Emperor Wu faced two major military issues almost immediately—incessant harassment from the rival Eastern Wu&#x27;s forces, under emperor Sun Hao, and tribal rebellions in Qin (秦) and Liang (涼) provinces (modern Gansu). Most officials were more concerned about the Xianbei, Qiang and other tribes in northwestern China and also with the Xiongnu in modern Shanxi, who were resettled there after the dissolution of their state by Cao Cao in 216 under the watchful eyes of Chinese officials, and were feared for their military abilities. These officials advised Emperor Wu to try to suppress the tribes before considering conquests of Eastern Wu. Under the encouragement of the generals Yang Hu and Wang Jun and the strategist Zhang Hua, however, Emperor Wu, while sending a number of generals to combat the tribes, prepared the southern and eastern border regions for war against Eastern Wu throughout this part of his reign. He was particularly encouraged by reports of Sun Hao&#x27;s cruelty and ineptitude in governing Eastern Wu; indeed, the officials in favor of war against Eastern Wu often cited this as reason to act quickly, as they argued that Eastern Wu would be harder to conquer if and when Sun Hao was replaced. However, after a major revolt by the Xianbei chief Tufa Shujineng started in 270 in Qin Province, Emperor Wu&#x27;s attention became concentrated on Tufa, as Tufa was able to win victory after victory over Jin generals. In 271, the Xiongnu noble Liu Meng rebelled in Bing province as well, and while his rebellion did not last long, this took Emperor Wu&#x27;s attention away from Eastern Wu. In 271, Jiao Province (交州, modern northern Vietnam), which had paid allegiance to Jin ever since the start of his reign, was recaptured by Eastern Wu. In 272, the Eastern Wu general Bu Chan, in fear that Sun Hao was going to punish him on the basis of false reports against him, tried to surrender the important city of Xiling (西陵, in modern Yichang, Hubei) to Jin, but Jin relief forces were stopped by the Eastern Wu general Lu Kang, who then recaptured Xiling and killed Bu. In light of these failures, Yang took another tack—he started a détente with Lu and treated the Eastern Wu border residents well, causing them to view Jin favorably.

When Emperor Wu ascended the throne in February 266, he honored his mother Wang Yuanji as empress dowager. In 266, he also honored his aunt Yang Huiyu (Sima Shi&#x27;s wife) an empress dowager, in recognition of his uncle&#x27;s contributions to the establishment of the Jìn Dynasty. He made his wife Yang Yan empress the same year. In 267, he made her oldest living son, Sima Zhong crown prince—based on the Confucian principle that the oldest son by an emperor&#x27;s wife should inherit the throne—a selection that would, however, eventually contribute greatly to political instability and the Jin Dynasty&#x27;s decline, as Crown Prince Zhong appeared to be developmentally disabled and unable to learn the important skills necessary to govern. Emperor Wu further made perhaps a particularly fateful choice on Crown Prince Zhong&#x27;s behalf—in 272, he selected Jia Nanfeng, the strong-willed daughter of the noble Jia Chong, to be Crown Prince Zhong&#x27;s princess. Crown Princess Jia would, from that point on, have the crown prince under her own tight control. Before Empress Yang died in 274, she was concerned that whoever the new empress would be, she would have ambitions to replace the crown prince, and therefore Empress Yang asked Emperor Wu to marry her cousin Yang Zhi. He agreed.

In 273, Emperor Wu would undertake a selection of beautiful women from throughout the empire—a warning sign of what would eventually come. He looked most attentively at the daughters of high officials, but he also ordered that no marriages take place across the empire until the selection process was done.

===Middle reign: unification of the Chinese empire===
In 276, Emperor Wu suffered a major illness—which led to a succession crisis. Crown Prince Zhong would be the legitimate heir, but both the officials and the people hoped that Emperor Wu&#x27;s capable brother, Sima You, the Prince of Qi, would inherit the throne instead. After Emperor Wu became well, he divested some military commands from officials that he thought favored Prince You, but otherwise took no other punitive actions against anyone.

Later that year, Yang Hu reminded Emperor Wu of his plan to conquer Eastern Wu. Most of the officials, still concerned with Tufa&#x27;s rebellion, were opposed, but Yang was supported by Du Yu and Zhang. Emperor Wu considered their counsel seriously but did not implement it at this time.

Also in 276, pursuant to his promise to the deceased Empress Yang, Emperor Wu married his cousin Yang Zhi and made her empress. The new Empress Yang&#x27;s father, Yang Jun, became a key official in the administration and became exceedingly arrogant.

In 279, with the general Ma Long having finally put down Tufa&#x27;s rebellion, Emperor Wu concentrated his efforts on Eastern Wu, and commissioned a six-pronged attack led by his uncle Sima Zhou, Wang Hun, Wang Rong, Hu Fen (胡奮), Du Yu, and Wang Jun, with the largest forces under Wang Hun and Wang Jun. Each of the Jin forces advanced quickly and captured the border cities that they were targeting, with Wang Jun&#x27;s fleet heading east down the Yangtze and clearing the river of Eastern Wu fleets. The Eastern Wu chancellor Zhang Ti (張悌) made a last-ditch attempt to defeat Wang Hun&#x27;s force, but was defeated and killed. Wang Hun, Wang Jun, and Sima Zhou each headed for Jianye, and Sun Hao was forced to surrender in spring 280. Emperor Wǔ made Sun Hao the Marquess of Guiming. The integration of former Eastern Wu territory into Jin appeared to have been a relatively smooth process.

After the fall of Eastern Wu, Emperor Wu ordered that provincial governors no longer be in charge of military matters and become purely civilian governors, and that regional militias be disbanded, despite opposition by the general Tao Huang and the key official Shan Tao. This would also eventually prove to create problems later on during the upheaval of the Five Barbarians, as the regional governors were not able to raise troops to resist quickly enough. He also rejected advice to have the non-Han gradually moved outside of the empire proper.

===Late reign: setting the stage for disasters===
In 281, Emperor Wu took 5,000 women from Sun Hao&#x27;s palace into his own, and thereafter became even more concentrated on feasting and enjoying the women, rather than on important matters of state. It was said that there were so many beautiful women in the palace that he did not know whom he should have sexual relations with; he therefore rode on a small cart drawn by goats, and wherever the goats would stop, he would stop there, as well. Because of this, many of the women planted bamboo leaves and salt outside their bedrooms—both items said to be favored by goats. Empress Yang&#x27;s father Yang Jun and uncles Yang Yao (楊珧) and Yang Ji (楊濟) became effectively in power.

Emperor Wu also became more concerned about whether his brother Prince You would seize the throne if he died. In January 283, he sent Prince You to his principality, even though there was no evidence that Prince You had such ambitions. Princess Jingzhao and Princess Changshan kow-towed and begged Emperor Wu to rescind his order, but he merely grew angry and demoted Princess Changshan&#x27;s husband in retaliation. Many officials, including Emperor Wu&#x27;s friend Cao Zhi, opposed the idea; Emperor Wu ordered these officials to be put on trial; Cao Zhi was relieved of his posts and sent back to his residence. Prince You, in anger, grew ill and died in April.

Following previous Roman embassies in 166 and 226, the &quot;Book of Jin&quot; and &quot;Wenxian Tongkao&quot; record another embassy from &quot;Da Qin&quot; appearing in China during the reign of Emperor Wu. These histories assert that it arrived in 284 and presented tributary gifts to the emperor.

As Emperor Wu grew ill in 289, he considered whom to make regent. He considered both Yang Jun and his uncle Sima Liang the Prince of Ru&#x27;nan, the most respected of the imperial princes. As a result, Yang Jun became fearful of Sima Liang and had him posted to the key city of Xuchang. Several other imperial princes were also posted to other key cities in the empire. By 290, Emperor Wu resolved to let Yang and Sima Liang both be regents, but after he wrote his will, the will was seized by Yang Jun, who instead had another will promulgated in which Yang alone was named regent. Emperor Wu died soon thereafter, leaving the empire in the hands of a developmentally disabled son and nobles intent on shedding each other&#x27;s blood for power, and while he would not see the disastrous consequences himself, the consequences would soon come.

<text>Saint Piran&#x27;s Flag () is the flag of Cornwall. The earliest known description of the flag, referred to as the Standard of Cornwall, was written in 1838. It is used by all Cornish people as a symbol of their identity.

The flag is attributed to Saint Piran, a 5th-century Cornish abbot. But the white cross and black background design is also the coat of arms of the Saint-Perran (or Saint-Pezran) family from Cornouaille in Brittany, recorded from the 15th century.

==Origins==

The earliest known evidence of this flag was recorded by Davies Gilbert in his 1838 work: &quot;The History of Cornwall&quot;, in which he gives reference to

a white cross on a black ground [that] was formerly the banner of St Perran and the Standard of Cornwall; probably with some allusion to the black ore and the white metal of tin

The fact that Gilbert identifies it as being &quot;formerly&quot; a standard of Cornwall implies that he believed it to have been used before 1838. However, Gilbert did not leave a record of his background research, and referred only to his &quot;recollection&quot;.

One of the oldest depictions of the flag can be seen in a stained glass window at Westminster Abbey. It was unveiled in 1888, in memory of the famous Cornish inventor and engineer Richard Trevithick. The window depicts St Michael at the top and nine Cornish saints, Piran, Petroc, Pinnock, Germanus, Julian, Cyriacus, Constantine, Nonna and Geraint in tiers below. The head of St Piran appears to be a portrait of Trevithick himself, and the figure carries the banner of Cornwall.

==Clues to its origin==

Saint Piran&#x27;s Flag has similarities to the old Breton flag and the flag of Saint David. The cultural links between Brittany, Wales and Cornwall are well recorded. Saint Piran&#x27;s Flag is the negative image of the old Breton flag, a black cross on a white field. The flag of Saint David shares a black background with Saint Piran&#x27;s Flag, but is surmounted by a gold, rather than a white, cross.

It has also been suggested that it may have been based on the arms of the Earl of Cornwall, or the later Duchy of Cornwall; based on the arms of other Cornish families; or be linked with the black and white livery of the Knights of St John.

==French and Breton family arms==
The arms of the Saint-Peran family in Brittany, show a white cross pattée on a black field.
Several other French and Breton families also had coats of arms that bear a striking resemblance to the St Piran&#x27;s flag:

* &quot;Saint Peran&quot; or &quot;Saint Pezran&quot; (= Piran) of Brittany (from Glomel, in Cornouaille), is described as, &quot;sable à croix patée d&#x27;argent&quot;.
* Geoffroy le Borgne of Brittany is described as .
* Rossillon de Gex, coat of arms described: .
* Brunet, de la Besse, coat of arms described: .
* Arnèke Family coat of arms.
* Rouvroy de Saint-Simon of Picardy, described: .

==Myths about the origins==

There are a very large number of modern legends about the origins of the flag.

An article in the old &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot; on &quot;Cornish Wrestling&quot; stated that the flag was carried by the Cornish contingent at the Battle of Agincourt (1415). However, the reference given by the &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot; seems to have been confused with one that comes from a 1590 poem entitled &quot;Poly-Olbion&quot; by Michael Drayton. It states that the banner carried by the Cornish men at Agincourt depicted two Cornish wrestlers in a hitch.

==Usage==

The flag is often displayed on bumper stickers, and flying from buildings, including those of Cornwall Council. It is flown at most Cornish gatherings, such as the Gorsedh Kernow, St Piran&#x27;s Day (5 March), Camborne&#x27;s Trevithick Day (April), Padstow&#x27;s &#x27;Obby &#x27;Oss festival (May), Helston&#x27;s Flora Day (May), and at Cornish rugby matches. It is regularly seen around Cornwall on car stickers with the word (Cornish for Cornwall), and is used around the world as a symbol of the Cornish diaspora or overseas Cornish associations. It has been adapted for use in the logos of a number of organisations, such as the Cornwall district of the Methodist Church, is used by a variety of Cornish businesses such as Ginsters, and is seen on the design of the Cornish All Blacks rugby shirts as well as the Cornish Pirates rugby logo.

At the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant in June 2012, the flag was flown on the Royal Rowing Barge alongside the flags representing England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and the City of London. One of the largest flags in the pageant was also St Piran&#x27;s Flag, flown by the St Ives mackerel lugger &quot;Barnabas&quot;.

The flags of Smith Island, Maryland and Tangier, Virginia incorporate St. Piran&#x27;s cross in the upper-left canton in recognition of the early settlers who came to the islands from Cornwall and Devon.

The flag can be seen in &quot;Doc Martin&quot;, which is set in the fictional Cornwall fishing village of Portwenn and filmed in the real-life one of Port Isaac.
