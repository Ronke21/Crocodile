<text>Dolichovespula maculata is a species of wasp in the genus &quot;Dolichovespula&quot; and a member of the eusocial, cosmopolitan family Vespidae. It is taxonomically an aerial yellowjacket but is known by many colloquial names, primarily bald-faced hornet, but also including bald-faced aerial yellowjacket, bald-faced wasp, bald hornet, white-faced hornet, blackjacket, white-tailed hornet, spruce wasp, and bull wasp. Technically a species of yellowjacket wasp, it is not one of the true hornets, which are in the genus &quot;Vespa&quot;. Colonies contain 400 to 700 workers, the largest recorded colony size in its genus, &quot;Dolichovespula&quot;. It builds a characteristic large hanging paper nest up to in length. Workers aggressively defend their nest by repeatedly stinging invaders.

The bald-faced hornet is distributed throughout the United States and southern Canada, but is most common in the Southeastern United States. Males in this species are haploid and females are diploid. Worker females can, therefore, lay eggs that develop into males.

==Taxonomy and phylogenetics==
The bald-faced hornet gets its name from the characteristic white markings on its face, as the word &quot;bald&quot; in English is derived from the word &quot;piebald&quot;. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1763 &quot;Centuria Insectorum&quot;. &quot;D. maculata&quot; is part of the cosmopolitan family Vespidae, in the genus &quot;Dolichovespula&quot;. Its black and white coloring differentiates it from its mostly black and yellow congenerics.

==Description==

The bald-faced hornet is distinguished from other yellowjackets by its striking black-and-white coloring. It has a white or &quot;bald-faced&quot; head, which is the source of its colloquial name. This wasp also has three white stripes at the end of its body and is notably larger than other species of &quot;Dolichovespula&quot;, as adults average about in length. Queen and worker wasps have similar morphologies. Queens are always larger than workers in their colonies, though size distributions can vary in different nests, and workers in one colony might be as large as a queen in a different one.

&quot;D. maculata&quot; creates egg-shaped, paper nests up to in diameter and in length. Nests are layered hexagonal combs covered by a mottled gray paper envelope. Bald-faced hornets create this paper envelope by collecting and chewing naturally occurring fibers. The wood fiber mixes with their saliva to become a pulpy substance that they can then form into place.

==Distribution==

The bald-faced hornet lives in North America, including Canada, the Rocky Mountains, the western coast of the United States, and most of the eastern United States. It is most common in the Southeastern United States.

&quot;D. maculata&quot; is found in forested areas and in vegetation in urban areas. Nests are generally located in trees and bushes, but occasionally are found under rock overhangs or the sides of buildings. Vertical distribution of nests has been recorded from heights of above ground level.

==Behavior==
Bald-faced hornets are omnivorous, and considered to be beneficial due to their predation of flies, caterpillars, and spiders. Their aggressive defensive nature, though, makes them a threat to humans who wander too close to a nest or when a nest is constructed too close to human habitation. They vigorously defend the nest, with workers stinging repeatedly, as is common among social bees and wasps. The bald-faced hornet has a unique defense in that it can squirt or spray venom from the stinger into the eyes of vertebrate nest intruders. The venom causes immediate watering of the eyes and temporary blindness.

==Colony cycle==
The life cycle of a colony can be divided into the founding stage, the ergonomic stage, and the reproductive stage. Colonies show annual cycling. New nests are generally founded during spring and early summer by a single queen, though temporal specifics vary depending on location. In Washington, nest initiation occurs during mid-May, and workers emerge during mid-June. Large-cell building starts during mid-July, and the first queens emerge during mid-August. The colony terminates during mid-September, for a life cycle around 4 months (122 days). Lower latitudes correlate with longer life cycles. In Indiana, colonies have been observed to begin in early May and terminate in late September, a life cycle of 5 months (153 days), and in Central California, nests are initiated as early as the end of March. These nests survive between 155 and 170 days. Active colonies have been observed in central Pennsylvania as late as mid-October. On October 28, 2022, an active colony was encountered on the Middle Fork Willamette River in western Oregon.

===Founding stage===
The colony is founded by a single overwintered, inseminated queen. She rears the first generation of workers on her own until they are functional. Colonies pass through the foundation over a typical period of 23–24 days. After the queen lays her eggs, 6 days are needed for them to hatch. They grow as larvae for 8 days, then an additional 9–10 days to mature into adult workers.

===Ergonomic and reproductive stage===
During the ergonomic stage, the colony&#x27;s activities are concerned with cell building and worker production. The queen devotes herself entirely to laying eggs, while the workers take over all other necessary housekeeping tasks. Sometime before the midpoint of colony life, the colony begins to invest energy in producing reproductives, marking the transition into the reproductive stage, during which both workers and reproductives are raised. Production of both castes limits the size of the workforce, but an early switching time is highly adaptive for social-wasp colonies in limiting the risk of total loss.
In a sampling of 50 colonies taken in Maryland in 1977, workers were produced from mid-April to early October, and reproductives were produced from mid-July through the end of November. Onset of male output usually precedes that of queen output in social wasps, but &quot;D. maculata&quot; is an exception.

Energy investment by workers required to produce reproductives is considerable. Newly emerged males and queens are no more functional than pupae; both depend heavily on solid prey brought in by workers, thus competing with larvae for food resources. As a result, worker quantity must remain high to maintain reproductive output. Workers must maintain food stores and defend the nest, and colonies whose work force diminishes too early in the colony&#x27;s life cycle can suffer a greater overall loss in reproductives.

==Social organization==

===Caste structure and distribution===

A colony is divided into haploid males, female workers, and the queen. All females are born with reproductive capacities. &quot;Dolichovespula&quot; is unique from its sister group &quot;Vespula&quot; in that some of the workers create haploid offspring that develop into males. Caste systems are determined by larval feeding regimens. G. T. Felippotti et al examined caste distribution among females in five small-cell colonies and six large-cell colonies. Small-cell colonies had one queen and 17–21 female workers. Large-cell colonies had two to six queens and 10–52 workers. Morphological comparisons revealed that queens are always larger than workers in the same colonies.

===Cuticular hydrocarbons===
Cuticular hydrocarbons serve as a barrier to moisture diffusion, so prevent dehydration in wasps. Cuticular hydrocarbon profiles vary over species and nests, and they are a proposed mechanism for nest-mate recognition. Worker and queen cuticular lipids have similar components, but their distributions differ dramatically, implying that cuticular hydrocarbons also play a role in caste differentiation.

===Cuticular hydrocarbon profile and dimorphism among castes===
The following lipid profiles were determined from specimens collected in the summer and early fall of northeastern Georgia in 1989. The dominant hydrocarbons recovered from the cuticles of workers were n-alkanes and methyl- and dimethyl-branched alkanes with a C27 or a C29 backbone. The major lipids and their distributions in workers were: n-heptacosane (28%), 11-13-methylheptacosane (15%) 3,13-dimethylheptacosane (11%), and 13 and 15-methylnonacosane (10%). Nonacosene composed 34% of cuticular lipids in the queen. The average chain length of identified cuticular lipids is 28.0 in queens and 27.5 in workers.

==Kin selection==

===Genetic relatedness within various classes===
In &quot;D. maculata&quot;, queens mate with only one male, which results in a relatedness of 0.75 between workers, whereas the relatedness between the queen and worker is only 0.5.

===Kin recognition and discrimination===
Gynes in &quot;D. maculata&quot; have the ability to discriminate between fragments of natal comb and foreign comb. Recognition does not depend upon presence of viable brood in the comb fragment. The physical nature of cues mediating natal comb recognition is unknown, though some researchers propose that distinct cuticular hydrocarbon profiles allow wasps to recognize nestmates.

===Worker-queen conflict===

&quot;D. maculata&quot; is characterized by low paternity, worker reproduction, and queen-worker conflict. Divergent genetic interests between workers and their queen cause intranest struggle for control, which disrupts social organization. Because of haplodiploidy, workers are unable to mate, but their unfertilized eggs become males. Workers and their queens are most related to their own sons. Natural selection then favors those workers that produce their own sons rather than rearing the queen&#x27;s brood. In a sampling of seven &quot;D. maculata&quot; nests, 20.9% of males were produced by workers. The percentage of males that were workers&#x27; sons did not correlate with the time during which nests were collected or colony size. Because worker relatedness is so high in &quot;D. maculata&quot;, workers are more related to other workers&#x27; sons than to the queen&#x27;s own sons, so worker policing of egg production does not occur. An explanation for the queen&#x27;s near monopoly on male production is that worker production is costly, so reduces total colony reproduction. The cost toward worker production acts as a selective pressure on the workers, so they are more likely to exercise reproductive restraint.

Workers in reproductive nests may kill their queen so they can reproduce. When researchers examined a collection of 19 &quot;D. maculata&quot; nests during the reproductive phase of their life cycle, they found that 14 nests did not have a queen. Matricide might occur after a sufficient workers have been raised and queen-destined eggs have been laid. However, matricide has not been directly observed and other causes of death are possible.

==Diet==
Diet in &quot;D. maculata&quot; varies depending on an individual&#x27;s life cycle stage and geographic location. Adult yellowjackets, like true hornets, are predatory, and prey upon several insect types. They have been observed consuming meat, spiders, fruit, and insects. Adults also drink flower nectar, which they feed to their larvae.

== Parasites ==
Female bee moths (&quot;Aphomia sociella&quot;) have been known to lay their eggs in bald-faced hornet nests. The hatched larvae then proceed to feed on the eggs, larvae, and pupae left unprotected by the wasps. This infestation can destroy large parts of the nest as the larvae tunnel throughout it looking for food.

==Life cycle==

Each spring, queens that matured and were fertilized at the end of the previous season begin new colonies. A queen selects a location for her nest, begins building it, lays a first batch of eggs, and feeds this first group of larvae. These become workers and assume the chore of expanding the nest. They chew up wood, which mixes with a starch in their saliva. They then spread it around with their mandibles and legs, and it dries into a papery structure. The workers guard the nest and feed on nectar, tree sap and fruit pulp (particularly that of apples). They also prey on insects and other arthropods, chewing them up and feeding them to the larvae. They have been known to scavenge raw meat. In late summer and early fall, the queen begins to lay eggs that become drones and new queens. After pupation, these fertile males and females fly off to mate. Fertilized queens then overwinter and start new colonies during the next year. Males and workers die in the end of the cycle. The old queen, if not killed by workers, dies with them around mid-autumn.

<doc id="347613" wikidata="Q281579" url="?curid=347613" title="Germ cell">
<text>A germ cell is any cell that gives rise to the gametes of an organism that reproduces sexually. In many animals, the germ cells originate in the primitive streak and migrate via the gut of an embryo to the developing gonads. There, they undergo meiosis, followed by cellular differentiation into mature gametes, either eggs or sperm. Unlike animals, plants do not have germ cells designated in early development. Instead, germ cells can arise from somatic cells in the adult, such as the floral meristem of flowering plants.

==Introduction==
Multicellular eukaryotes are made of two fundamental cell types: germ and somatic cells. Germ cells produce gametes and are the only cells that can undergo meiosis as well as mitosis. Somatic cells are all the other cells that form the building blocks of the body and they only divide by mitosis. The lineage of germ cells is called the germline. Germ cell specification begins during cleavage in many animals or in the epiblast during gastrulation in birds and mammals. After transport, involving passive movements and active migration, germ cells arrive at the developing gonads. In humans, sexual differentiation starts approximately 6 weeks after conception. The end-products of the germ cell cycle are the egg or sperm.

Under special conditions &quot;in vitro&quot; germ cells can acquire properties similar to those of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The underlying mechanism of that change is still unknown. These changed cells are then called embryonic germ cells. Both cell types are pluripotent in vitro, but only ESCs have proven pluripotency in vivo. Recent studies have demonstrated that it is possible to give rise to primordial germ cells from ESCs.

==Specification==
There are two mechanisms to establish the germ cell lineage in the embryo. The first way is called preformistic and involves that the cells destined to become germ cells inherit the specific germ cell determinants present in the germ plasm (specific area of the cytoplasm) of the egg (ovum). The unfertilized egg of most animals is asymmetrical: different regions of the cytoplasm contain different amounts of mRNA and proteins.

The second way is found in mammals, where germ cells are not specified by such determinants but by signals controlled by zygotic genes. In mammals, a few cells of the early embryo are induced by signals of neighboring cells to become primordial germ cells. Mammalian eggs are somewhat symmetrical and after the first divisions of the fertilized egg, the produced cells are all totipotent. This means that they can differentiate in any cell type in the body and thus germ cells. Specification of primordial germ cells in the laboratory mouse is initiated by high levels of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, which activates expression of the transcription factors Blimp-1/Prdm1 and Prdm14.

It is speculated that induction was the ancestral mechanism, and that the preformistic, or inheritance, mechanism of germ cell establishment arose from convergent evolution. There are several key differences between these two mechanisms that may provide reasoning for the evolution of germ plasm inheritance. One difference is that typically inheritance occurs almost immediately during development (around the blastoderm stage) while induction typically does not occur until gastrulation. As germ cells are quiescent and therefore not dividing, they are not susceptible to mutation.

Since the germ cell lineage is not established right away by induction, there is a higher chance for mutation to occur before the cells are specified. Mutation rate data is available that indicates a higher rate of germ line mutations in mice and humans, species which undergo induction, than in C. elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, species which undergo inheritance. A lower mutation rate would be selected for, which is one possible reason for the convergent evolution of the germ plasm. However, more mutation rate data will need to be collected across several taxa, particularly data collected both before and after the specification of primordial germ cells before this hypothesis on the evolution of germ plasm can be backed by strong evidence.

==Migration ==

Primordial germ cells, germ cells that still have to reach the gonads (also known as PGCs, precursor germ cells or gonocytes) divide repeatedly on their migratory route through the gut and into the developing gonads.

===Invertebrates===
In the model organism &quot;Drosophila&quot;, pole cells passively move from the posterior end of the embryo to the posterior midgut because of the infolding of the blastoderm. Then they actively move through the gut into the mesoderm. Endodermal cells differentiate and together with Wunen proteins they induce the migration through the gut. Wunen proteins are chemorepellents that lead the germ cells away from the endoderm and into the mesoderm. After splitting into two populations, the germ cells continue migrating laterally and in parallel until they reach the gonads. Columbus proteins, chemoattractants, stimulate the migration in the gonadal mesoderm.

===Vertebrates===
In the aquatic frog &quot;Xenopus&quot; egg, the germ cell determinants are found in the most vegetal blastomeres. These presumptive PGCs are brought to the endoderm of the blastocoel by gastrulation. They are determined as germ cells when gastrulation is completed. Migration from the hindgut along the gut and across the dorsal mesentery then takes place. The germ cells split into two populations and move to the paired gonadal ridges. Migration starts with 3-4 cells that undergo three rounds of cell division so that about 30 PGCs arrive at the gonads. On the migratory path of the PGCs, the orientation of underlying cells and their secreted molecules such as fibronectin play an important role.

Mammals have a migratory path comparable to that in &quot;Xenopus&quot;. Migration begins with 50 gonocytes and about 5,000 PGCs arrive at the gonads. Proliferation occurs also during migration and lasts for 3–4 weeks in humans.

PGCs come from the epiblast and migrate subsequently into the mesoderm, the endoderm and the posterior of the yolk sac. Migration then takes place from the hindgut along the gut and across the dorsal mesentery to reach the gonads (4.5 weeks in human beings). Fibronectin maps here also a polarized network together with other molecules. The somatic cells on the path of germ cells provide them attractive, repulsive, and survival signals. But germ cells also send signals to each other.

In reptiles and birds, germ cells use another path. PGCs come from the epiblast and move to the hypoblast to form the germinal crescent (anterior extraembryonic structure). The gonocytes then squeeze into blood vessels and use the circulatory system for transport. They squeeze out of the vessels when they are at height of the gonadal ridges. Cell adhesion on the endothelium of the blood vessels and molecules such as chemoattractants are probably involved in helping PGCs migrate.

====The &quot;Sry&quot; gene of the Y chromosome====
The Sex-determining Region of the Y chromosome (&quot;SRY&quot;) directs male development in mammals by inducing the somatic cells of the gonadal ridge to develop into a testis, rather than an ovary. &quot;Sry&quot; is expressed in a small group of somatic cells of the gonads and influences these cells to become Sertoli cells (supporting cells in testis). Sertoli cells are responsible for sexual development along a male pathway in many ways. One of these ways involves stimulation of the arriving primordial cells to differentiate into sperm. In the absence of the &quot;Sry&quot; gene, primordial germ cells differentiate into eggs. Removing genital ridges before they start to develop into testes or ovaries results in the development of a female, independent of the carried sex chromosome.

====Retinoic Acid and Germ cell differentiation====
Retinoic acid (RA) is an important factor that causes differentiation of primordial germ cells. In males, the mesonephros releases retinoic acid. RA then goes to the gonad causing an enzyme called CYP26B1 to be released by sertoli cells. CYP26B1 metabolizes RA, and because sertoli cells surround primordial germ cells (PGCs), PGCs never come into contact with RA, which results in a lack of proliferation of PGCs and no meiotic entry. This keeps spermatogenesis from starting too soon. In females, the mesonephros releases RA, which enters the gonad. RA stimulates Stra8, a critical gatekeeper of meiosis (1), and Rec8, causing primordial germ cells to enter meiosis. This causes the development of oocytes that arrest in meiosis I.

==Gametogenesis==
Gametogenesis, the development of diploid germ cells into either haploid eggs or sperm (respectively oogenesis and spermatogenesis) is different for each species but the general stages are similar. Oogenesis and spermatogenesis have many features in common, they both involve:
*Meiosis
*Extensive morphological differentiation
*Incapacity of surviving for very long if fertilization does not occur

Despite their homologies they also have major differences:
*Spermatogenesis has equivalent meiotic divisions resulting in four equivalent spermatids while oogenic meiosis is asymmetrical: only one egg is formed together with a first and second polar bodies.
*Different timing of maturation: oogenic meiosis is interrupted at one or more stages (for a long time) while spermatogenic meiosis is rapid and uninterrupted.

==Oogenesis==
After migration primordial germ cells will become oogonia in the forming gonad (ovary). The oogonia proliferate extensively by mitotic divisions, up to 5-7 million cells in humans. But then many of these oogonia die and about 50,000 remain. These cells differentiate into primary oocytes. In week 11-12 &quot;post coitus&quot; the first meiotic division begins (before birth for most mammals) and remains arrested in prophase I from a few days to many years depending on the species. It is in this period or in some cases at the beginning of sexual maturity that the primary oocytes secrete proteins to form a coat called zona pellucida and they also produce cortical granules containing enzymes and proteins needed for fertilization. Meiosis stands by because of the follicular granulosa cells that send inhibitory signals through gap junctions and the zona pellucida. Sexual maturation is the beginning of periodic ovulation. Ovulation is the regular release of one oocyte from the ovary into the reproductive tract and is preceded by follicular growth. A few follicle cells are stimulated to grow but only one oocyte is ovulated. A primordial follicle consists of an epithelial layer of follicular granulosa cells enclosing an oocyte. The pituitary gland secrete follicle-stimulating hormones (FSHs) that stimulate follicular growth and oocyte maturation. The thecal cells around each follicle secrete estrogen. This hormone stimulates the production of FSH receptors on the follicular granulosa cells and has at the same time a negative feedback on FSH secretion. This results in a competition between the follicles and only the follicle with the most FSH receptors survives and is ovulated. Meiotic division I goes on in the ovulated oocyte stimulated by luteinizing hormones (LHs) produced by the pituitary gland. FSH and LH block the gap junctions between follicle cells and the oocyte therefore inhibiting communication between them. Most follicular granulosa cells stay around the oocyte and so form the cumulus layer. Large non-mammalian oocytes accumulate egg yolk, glycogen, lipids, ribosomes, and the mRNA needed for protein synthesis during early embryonic growth. These intensive RNA biosynthese are mirrored in the structure of the chromosomes, which decondense and form lateral loops giving them a lampbrush appearance (see Lampbrush chromosome). Oocyte maturation is the following phase of oocyte development. It occurs at sexual maturity when hormones stimulate the oocyte to complete meiotic division I. The meiotic division I produces 2 cells differing in size: a small polar body and a large secondary oocyte. The secondary oocyte undergoes meiotic division II and that results in the formation of a second small polar body and a large mature egg, both being haploid cells. The polar bodies degenerate. Oocyte maturation stands by at metaphase II in most vertebrates. During ovulation, the arrested secondary oocyte leaves the ovary and matures rapidly into an egg ready for fertilization. Fertilization will cause the egg to complete meiosis II. In human females there is proliferation of the oogonia in the fetus, meiosis starts then before birth and stands by at meiotic division I up to 50 years, ovulation begins at puberty.

===Egg growth===

A 10 - 20 μm large somatic cell generally needs 24 hours to double its mass for mitosis. By this way it would take a very long time for that cell to reach the size of a mammalian egg with a diameter of 100 μm (some insects have eggs of about 1,000 μm or greater). Eggs have therefore special mechanisms to grow to their large size. One of these mechanisms is to have extra copies of genes: meiotic division I is paused so that the oocyte grows while it contains two diploid chromosome sets. Some species produce many extra copies of genes, such as amphibians, which may have up to 1 or 2 million copies. A complementary mechanism is partly dependent on syntheses of other cells. In amphibians, birds, and insects, yolk is made by the liver (or its equivalent) and secreted into the blood. Neighboring accessory cells in the ovary can also provide nutritive help of two types. In some invertebrates some oogonia become nurse cells. These cells are connected by cytoplasmic bridges with oocytes. The nurse cells of insects provide oocytes macromolecules such as proteins and mRNA. Follicular granulosa cells are the second type of accessory cells in the ovary in both invertebrates and vertebrates. They form a layer around the oocyte and nourish them with small molecules, no macromolecules, but eventually their smaller precursor molecules, by gap junctions.

===Mutation and DNA repair===

The mutation frequency of female germline cells in mice is about 5-fold lower than that of somatic cells, according to one study.

The mouse oocyte in the dictyate (prolonged diplotene) stage of meiosis actively repairs DNA damage, whereas DNA repair was not detected in the pre-dictyate (leptotene, zygotene and pachytene) stages of meiosis. The long period of meiotic arrest at the four chromatid dictyate stage of meiosis may facilitate recombinational repair of DNA damages.

==Spermatogenesis==

Mammalian spermatogenesis is representative for most animals. In human males, spermatogenesis begins at puberty in seminiferous tubules in the testicles and go on continuously. Spermatogonia are immature germ cells. They proliferate continuously by mitotic divisions around the outer edge of the seminiferous tubules, next to the basal lamina. Some of these cells stop proliferation and differentiate into primary spermatocytes. After they proceed through the first meiotic division, two secondary spermatocytes are produced. The two secondary spermatocytes undergo the second meiotic division to form four haploid spermatids. These spermatids differentiate morphologically into sperm by nuclear condensation, ejection of the cytoplasm and formation of the acrosome and flagellum.

The developing male germ cells do not complete cytokinesis during spermatogenesis. Consequently, cytoplasmic bridges exist during interphase to ensure connection between the clones of differentiating daughter cells. These bridges are called a syncytium, and feature a TEX14 and KIF23 ring in their centre. In this way the haploid cells are supplied with all the products of a complete diploid genome. Sperm that carry a Y chromosome, for example, are supplied with essential molecules that are encoded by genes on the X chromosome.

Success of germ cell proliferation and differentiation is also ensured by a balance between germ cell development and programmed cell death. Identification of «death triggering signals» and corresponding receptor proteins is important for the fertilization potential of males. Apoptosis in germ cells can be induced by variety of naturally occurring toxicant. Receptors belonging to the taste 2 family are specialized to detect bitter compounds including extremely toxic alkaloids. So taste receptors play a functional role for controlling apoptosis in male reproductive tissue.

===Mutation and DNA repair===

The mutation frequencies for cells throughout the different stages of spermatogenesis in mice is similar to that in female germline cells, that is 5 to 10-fold lower than the mutation frequency in somatic cells Thus low mutation frequency is a feature of germline cells in both sexes. 
Homologous recombinational repair of double-strand breaks occurs in mouse during sequential stages of spermatogenesis, but is most prominent in spermatocytes. The lower frequencies of mutation in germ cells compared to somatic cells appears to be due to more efficient removal of DNA damages by repair processes including homologous recombination repair during meiosis. Mutation frequency during spermatogenesis increases with age. The mutations in spermatogenic cells of old mice include an increased prevalence of transversion mutations compared to young and middle-aged mice.

==Diseases==
Germ cell tumor is a rare cancer that can affect people at all ages. As of 2018, germ cell tumors account for 3% of all cancers in children and adolescents 0–19 years old.

Germ cell tumors are generally located in the gonads but can also appear in the abdomen, pelvis, mediastinum, or brain. Germ cells migrating to the gonads may not reach that intended destination and a tumor can grow wherever they end up, but the exact cause is still unknown. These tumors can be benign or malignant.

On arrival at the gonad, primordial germ cells that do not properly differentiate may produce germ cell tumors of the ovary or testis in a mouse model.

==Induced differentiation ==
Inducing differentiation of certain cells to germ cells has many applications. One implication of induced differentiation is that it may allow for the eradication of male and female factor infertility. Furthermore, it would allow same-sex couples to have biological children if sperm could be produced from female cells or if eggs could be produced from male cells. Efforts to create sperm and eggs from skin and embryonic stem cells were pioneered by Hayashi and Saitou&#x27;s research group at Kyoto University. These researchers produced primordial germ cell-like cells (PGLCs) from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and skin cells in vitro.

Hayashi and Saitou&#x27;s group was able to promote the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into PGCs with the use of precise timing and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4). Upon succeeding with embryonic stem cells, the group was able to successfully promote the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into PGLCs. These primordial germ cell-like cells were then used to create spermatozoa and oocytes.

Efforts for human cells are less advanced due to the fact that the PGCs formed by these experiments are not always viable. In fact Hayashi and Saitou&#x27;s method is only one third as effective as current in vitro fertilization methods, and the produced PGCs are not always functional. Furthermore, not only are the induced PGCs not as effective as naturally occurring PGCs, but they are also less effective at erasing their epigenetic markers when they differentiate from iPSCs or ESCs to PGCs.

There are also other applications of induced differentiation of germ cells. Another study showed that culture of human embryonic stem cells in mitotically inactivated porcine ovarian fibroblasts (POF) causes differentiation into germ cells, as evidenced by gene expression analysis.

<text>John Parker Hale (March 31, 1806November 19, 1873) was an American politician and lawyer from New Hampshire. He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1843 to 1845 and in the United States Senate from 1847 to 1853 and again from 1855 to 1865. He began his congressional career as a Democrat, but helped establish the anti-slavery Free Soil Party and eventually joined the Republican Party.

Born in Rochester, New Hampshire, Hale established a legal practice in Dover, New Hampshire after graduating from Bowdoin College. Hale won election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 1832 and served as the United States Attorney for New Hampshire under President Andrew Jackson and President Martin Van Buren. He won election to the United States House of Representatives in 1842 but was denied the party&#x27;s nomination in 1844 due to his opposition to the annexation of Texas. After losing his seat, he continued to campaign against slavery and won election to the Senate in 1846 as an Independent Democrat. In the Senate, he strongly opposed the Mexican–American War and continued to speak against slavery.

Hale helped establish the anti-slavery Free Soil Party and was a candidate for the party&#x27;s presidential nomination in 1848, but the 1848 Free Soil Convention instead nominated former President Van Buren. He won the party&#x27;s presidential nomination in 1852, receiving 4.9% of the popular vote in the general election. After the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, Hale joined the nascent Republican Party and returned to the Senate. He served until 1865, at which point he accepted an appointment from President Abraham Lincoln to serve as the Minister to Spain. He held that post until he was recalled in April 1869, at which point he retired from public office.

==Early years==
Hale was born in Rochester, Strafford County, New Hampshire, the son of John Parker Hale and Lydia Clarkson O&#x27;Brien. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy and graduated in 1827 from Bowdoin College, where he was a classmate of Franklin Pierce and a prominent member of the Athenian Society, a literary club. He began his law studies in Rochester with Jeremiah H. Woodman and continued them with Daniel M. Christie in Dover. He passed the bar examination in 1830 and practiced law in Dover. He married Lucy Lambert, the daughter of William Thomas Lambert and Abigail Ricker.

==Start of political career==
In March 1832, Hale was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives as a Democrat. In 1834, President Andrew Jackson appointed him as U.S. District Attorney for New Hampshire. This appointment was renewed by President Martin Van Buren in 1838, but in 1841, Hale was removed on party grounds by President John Tyler, a Whig.

Hale was elected as a Democrat to the Twenty-eighth Congress, serving from March 4, 1843, to March 3, 1845. There he spoke out against the gag rule that had been approved by Congress on December 12, 1838. This rule had been created by another New Hampshire representative, Charles G. Atherton and was intended to put a stop to anti-slavery petitions.

==Anti-slavery transition==
Hale supported the Democratic candidates James K. Polk and George M. Dallas in the 1844 presidential election, and was renominated for his congressional seat without opposition. Before the congressional election, Texas annexation was adopted by the Democratic Party as part of its platform. In December 1844 the New Hampshire Legislature passed resolutions instructing its senators and congressmen to favor Texas annexation. Instead, Hale made a public statement opposing annexation on anti-slavery grounds.

The Democratic state convention was then reassembled in Concord under Pierce&#x27;s leadership for the purpose of stripping Hale of his congressional nomination. The reassembled convention branded him a traitor to the party, and in February 1845 his name was stricken from the Democratic ticket. In the subsequent election, Hale ran as an independent. Hale, the replacement Democratic candidate, and the Whig candidate failed to obtain a majority, so the district was unrepresented.

==Anti-slavery governing coalition==
In the face of an apparently invincible Democratic majority, Hale set out to win New Hampshire over to the anti-slavery cause. He addressed meetings in every town and village in the state, carrying on a remarkable campaign known as the &quot;Hale Storm of 1845,&quot; which included a June 5, 1845 debate between Pierce and Hale at the North Church in Concord. In 1846, Hale was able to use New Hampshire&#x27;s unusual electoral rules to his advantage. Under the state constitution, candidates for Governor and State Senate required a majority of the vote to win; if no candidate won a majority, the General Court would pick among the top two candidates.

The strong performance of the anti-slavery Free Soil Party resulted in no majority winner in the 1846 gubernatorial election or in seven out of twelve State Senate seats. Accordingly, Hale&#x27;s coalition of Whigs, Liberty Party members and Independent Democrats were able to join to win control of state government after the election. The coalition selected seven Whig candidates to fill the State Senate vacancies, ensuring coalition control of the chamber. It then elected Whig Anthony Colby as Governor (despite him winning just 32% of the vote to Democrat Jared W. Williams&#x27;s 48%), Liberty Party member Joseph Cilley to a vacancy in the U.S. Senate, and Hale as Speaker of the State House. When Cilley&#x27;s term expired in 1847, Hale was elected as his successor.

==United States Senate==
===First term as Senator===
Hale was elected June 9, 1846, as an Independent Democratic Candidate to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1847, to March 3, 1853, later becoming a Free Soiler.

He was among the strongest opponents of the Mexican–American War in the Senate and is considered &quot;the first U.S. Senator with an openly anti-slavery (or abolitionist) platform&quot;.

Hale was the only Senator to vote against the resolution tendering the thanks of Congress to Winfield Scott and Zachary Taylor for their victories in the Mexican–American War. In 1849, he was joined in the Senate by anti-slavery advocates Salmon P. Chase and William H. Seward, and was later joined by Charles Sumner in 1851.

Hale also opposed flogging and the spirit ration in the United States Navy, and secured the abolition of flogging in September 1850.

In 1851, Hale served as counsel in the trials of anti-slavery activists that arose out of their forcible rescue of fugitive slave Shadrach Minkins from the custody of the United States Marshal in Boston.

===Presidential candidate===
Hale was an unsuccessful candidate for President of the United States on the Free Soil ticket in 1852, finishing behind Democratic candidate Franklin Pierce and Whig candidate Winfield Scott.
In March 1853, Hale was succeeded in the Senate by Democrat Charles G. Atherton and began practicing law in New York City.

===Return to the Senate===
Following the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, Democrats were again ousted in New Hampshire. Hale was elected to the Senate as a member of the new Republican Party in 1855, replacing Jared W. Williams, who had been appointed following the death of Charles G. Atherton. James Bell, a fellow Republican, was elected to New Hampshire&#x27;s other Senate seat in the same election. Hale entered the Senate on July 30, 1855, was re-elected in 1859, and served until March 3, 1865.
Hale served as the chair of the Senate Republican Conference until 1862. That year, Hale succeeded in repealing the Navy&#x27;s spirit ration, which he had attempted during his first Senate term.

==Minister to Spain==
President Lincoln nominated Hale to the post of minister to Spain and he served in that capacity 1865–1869. Hale attributed his April 1869 recall to a quarrel with Horatio J. Perry, his secretary of legation. Perry had accused Hale of violating his diplomatic privilege of importing free of duty merchandise for his official or personal use by putting some goods up for sale and pocketing the proceeds. Hale&#x27;s answer was that he had been misled about the rules by a commission merchant friendly to Perry. Perry was himself removed from his post in June 1869.

== Death and burial ==
Hale died in Dover, New Hampshire on November 19, 1873. He was buried at Pine Hill Cemetery in Dover.

==Legacy==
Hale&#x27;s Federal style house, built in 1813, is now part of the Woodman Institute Museum. New Hampshire Historical Marker No. 264 on Central Avenue in Dover marks the site of his home.

Longtime Washington journalist Benjamin Perley Poore wrote that Hale, as Senator in the late 1850s, &quot;never failed to command attention&quot;:The keen shafts of the Southerners, aimed at him, fell harmlessly to his feet, and his wonderful good nature disarmed malicious opposition. Those who felt that he had gone far astray in his political opinions did not accuse him of selfish motives, sordid purposes, or degraded intrigues. His was the &quot;chasseur&quot; style of oratory—now skirmishing on the outskirts of an opponent&#x27;s position, then rallying on some strange point, pouring in a rattling fire, standing firm against a charge, and ever displaying a perfect independence of action and a disregard of partisan drill.

Hale is one of several prominent New Hampshire politicians with a statue at the New Hampshire State House Complex in Concord. Portraits of President Lincoln and John P. Hale hang next to each other in the chamber of the New Hampshire House of Representatives.

==Family==
On September 2, 1834, Hale married Lucy Hill Lambert (1814–1902) in Berwick, Maine. They were the parents of two daughters, Elizabeth (Lizzie) (1835–1895) and Lucy (1841–1915).

Elizabeth Hale first married Edward Kinsley (1825–1888). Their only child died shortly after birth. Her second husband was William Henry &#x27;Harry&#x27; Jacques (1847–1916).

Lucy Lambert Hale was secretly betrothed in 1865 to John Wilkes Booth, Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s assassin. Booth had a picture of Lucy Hale with him when he was shot and killed by Sergeant Boston Corbett on April 26, 1865. Lucy Hale eventually married Senator William E. Chandler.

<doc id="347618" wikidata="Q1346974" url="?curid=347618" title="Sesshō and Kampaku">
<text>In Japan, was a regent who was named to act on behalf of either a child emperor before his coming of age, or an empress regnant. The was theoretically a sort of chief advisor for the Emperor, but was in practice the title of both first secretary and regent who assisted an adult Emperor. The duties of the &quot;Sesshō&quot; and &quot;Kampaku&quot; were to convey to the Emperor the policies formulated by the and other senior officials of the , and to convey the Emperor&#x27;s decisions to them. As regents of the Emperor, the &quot;Sesshō&quot; and &quot;Kampaku&quot; sometimes made decisions on behalf of the Emperor, but their positions were not defined by law and they had no specific political authority. The two titles were collectively known as , and the families that exclusively held the titles were called ( family).

During the Heian period (794–1185), from the middle of the 9th century, the Fujiwara clan began to marry off their daughters to the Emperor and assume the positions of &quot;Sesshō&quot; and &quot;Kampaku&quot;, thereby excluding other clans from the political centre and increasing their political power. From the 10th century, the Fujiwara clan monopolized the &quot;Sesshō&quot; and &quot;Kampaku&quot;, and at the end of the 10th century, around the time of Fujiwara no Michinaga and Fujiwara no Yorimichi, the power of the Fujiwara clan reached its zenith. In the mid-11th century, Emperor Go-Sanjo ran his own government, and the next Emperor, Shirakawa, abdicated to become Cloistered Emperor, beginning the cloistered rule. From then on, the cloistered rule of Cloistered Emperor took root, and the de facto Fujiwara regime, which used the positions of &quot;Sesshō&quot; and &quot;Kampaku&quot;, was over, and the &quot;Sesshō&quot; and &quot;Kampaku&quot; lost their real political power and became mere names.

During the Kamakura period (1185–1333), when the warrior class seized power and the Kamakura shogunate was established, the Fujiwara were divided into : the Konoe, Kujō, Nijō, Ichijo, and Takatsukasa families. From then on, these five families served as &quot;Sesshō&quot; and &quot;Kampaku&quot; on a rotating basis.

Toyotomi Hideyoshi was the first person in history to become a &quot;Kampaku&quot; who was not a noble by birth; his nephew Toyotomi Hidetsugu also became a &quot;Kampaku&quot;. Hideyoshi obtained this title, the highest position in the aristocracy, by being adopted into the Konoe family and formally becoming an aristocrat. A retired was called , which came to commonly refer to Toyotomi Hideyoshi.

Both and were styled as or in historical pronunciation; translated as &quot;(Imperial) Highness&quot;, as were Imperial princes and princesses.

==History==
In earlier times, only members of the Imperial Family could be appointed . The reports that Emperor Ōjin was assisted by his mother, Empress Jingū, but it is doubtful if it is a historical fact. The first historical was Prince Shōtoku, who assisted Empress Suiko.

The Fujiwara clan was the primary holder of the and titles. More precisely, those titles were held by the Fujiwara Hokke (northern Fujiwara family) and its descendants, to which Fujiwara no Yoshifusa belonged.

In 858, Fujiwara no Yoshifusa became . He was the first not to be a member of the Imperial house. In 887, Fujiwara no Mototsune, the nephew and adopted son of Yoshifusa, was appointed to the newly created office of .

In the 12th century, there were five families among the descendants of Yorimichi called : the Konoe family, Kujō family, Ichijō family, Takatsukasa family and Nijō family. Both the Konoe and Kujō families were descendants of Fujiwara no Yorimichi, through Fujiwara no Tadamichi. The other three families were derived from either the Konoe or Kujō families. Until the Meiji Restoration of 1868, those five families held those title exclusively with the two exceptions of Toyotomi Hideyoshi and his nephew Toyotomi Hidetsugu.

The offices and titles of and were abolished by the declaration of the Imperial Restoration in 1868 during the Meiji Restoration in order to reorganize the government structure. The office and title of was stipulated under the former Imperial Household Law in 1889 and also under the new Imperial Household Law in 1948. Under these laws, the officeholder of is restricted to a member of the Japanese Imperial family. Crown Prince Hirohito, before becoming Emperor Shōwa, was from 1921 to 1926 for the mentally disabled Emperor Taishō. He was called .

The area of Taikō in Nagoya is named after the title, although it refers to Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The main street is Taikō-dōri, which is served by the subway Taiko-dori Station.

<doc id="347636" wikidata="Q27236" url="?curid=347636" title="Sedge warbler">
<text>The sedge warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus) is an Old World warbler in the genus &quot;Acrocephalus&quot;. It is a medium-sized warbler with a brown, streaked back and wings and a distinct pale supercilium. Sedge warblers are migratory, crossing the Sahara to get from their European and Asian breeding grounds to spend winter in Africa. The male&#x27;s song is composed of random chattering phrases and can include mimicry of other species. The sedge warbler is mostly insectivorous.

==Taxonomy==
The sedge warbler was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Motacilla schoenobaenus&quot;. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; that was introduced in 1811 by Johann Andreas Naumann and his son Johann Friedrich Naumann. British ornithologists did not distinguish the species from the Eurasian reed warbler until the 18th century. The genus name &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; is from Ancient Greek , &quot;highest&quot;, and , &quot;head&quot;. It is possible that the Naumanns thought &quot;akros&quot; meant &quot;sharp-pointed&quot;. The specific &quot;schoenobaenus&quot; is from Ancient Greek , &quot;reed&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, &quot;to tread&quot;. It is a translation of the old Swedish name for the bird, &quot;Sävstigare&quot;. The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
This is a medium-sized warbler, long and weighing around . It has a streaked brown back and wings, and pale underparts. The rump is warm brown and unstreaked, contrasting with the duller wings. The forehead is flattened, the crown is streaked with black, and the bill is strong and pointed. There is a prominent whitish supercilium. The legs are greyish.

The plumage of the sexes is identical, although they can be told apart when caught for ringing by the presence of a brood patch or cloacal protuberance. Juvenile birds have dark spots on the breast. They can be easier to confuse with aquatic warblers due to an apparent pale central crown stripe contrasting with the darker edges. Other similar species include moustached warblers and Pallas&#x27;s grasshopper warblers. The oldest recorded sedge warbler was a bird ringed in Finland which reached the age of 10 years, 1 month. The typical lifespan is 2 years.

The song is varied, rushed and chattering, with sweeter phrases and some mimicry, typical of the &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; warblers. It is composed of phrases in random order, so that it is never the same. Male sedge warblers which have the widest repertoire mate with the largest number of females.

==Distribution and habitat==
The sedge warbler has a large range and an estimated Global Extent of Occurrence of 10 million square kilometres, with a large global population including between 8.8 million and 15 million birds in Europe. Data analysis by the British Trust for Ornithology has shown that fluctuations in the sedge warbler population stem from the adult survival rate, due to changes in rainfall on the birds&#x27; wintering grounds. Global changes in population have not been measured, but the sedge warbler&#x27;s status is designated &#x27;of least concern&#x27; by BirdLife International.

 It breeds across Europe and western and central Asia and is migratory. After feeding up post-breeding, they migrate quickly across southern Europe and the Sahara from August to September. Studies in Nigeria and Uganda suggest that sedge warblers return to spend winter at the same sites, year after year.

All sedge warblers spend winter in sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east, and as far south as the eastern Cape Province of South Africa and northern Namibia. The routes taken on the southward migration, and their eventual wintering grounds, correspond to the birds&#x27; breeding grounds. Birds ringed in the United Kingdom and Netherlands are later found from south-west Iberia to Italy; birds from Sweden are recovered in central Europe and Italy; while Finnish birds are found in north-east Italy and Malta east to the Aegean region. Sedge warblers from the former Soviet Union take routes via the eastern Mediterranean Sea and Middle East.

Loss of wetland areas for feeding on migration, and the expansion of the Sahara Desert, pose threats to the sedge warbler&#x27;s breeding population. Birds begin leaving Africa in late February, fatten up at wetlands before and probably after crossing the Sahara, and arrive in Europe from March onwards.

Unlike other members of the &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; genus, the sedge warbler&#x27;s range stretches from the Arctic to mid-latitudes. It is adapted to cool, cloudy and moist conditions. Though it is often found in wetlands, it can breed or more away from water. During the breeding season, this is a species found in reedbeds, often with scrub, ditches and habitats away from water including hedgerows, patches of stinging nettles, and arable crops. On the African wintering grounds, habitats such as reeds at wetlands, papyrus, grass, sedge and reedmace and tall elephant grass are used. It can be found at altitudes of above sea level in Ethiopia.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===

Male sedge warblers commence singing only a few hours after arriving on their breeding territory. The song is given from a bare perch such as a reed stem or bush, or from cover and during routine flights within their territory. Song-flights are also performed: while singing, the bird takes off, rises to a height of around and then after a short circling flight, makes a slow, &#x27;parachuting&#x27; descent, often with the wings held up in a &#x27;v&#x27; shape. The song has the function of attracting a mate, rather than keeping other males away, and is stopped as soon as a mate is found. Contact calls are described as &quot;chirr&quot; or &quot;kerr&quot;; and these calls are repeated quickly to form a rattling alarm call.

Studies have found that early-arriving males occupy the best breeding territories. A study in Nottinghamshire, England, showed that a third of males which returned bred within 50 m or less of their previous breeding site, and only 14% bred further than away. Another study conducted in the Nida River valley in Poland showed that individual males tend to show the biggest shifts in territory location in the first two seasons of life (up to &gt;400 m). This seems to be caused by an increasing early arrival on the breeding grounds in the first years. Hence, they find more potential territories left unoccupied by conspecifics upon arrival, causing them to shift to better quality ones.

Pairs are usually social monogamous, but not strictly so. Males commonly practice promiscuity, and part of the males settle a new territory and resume territorial behavior whilst the female incubates the first clutch. When successfully pairing with another female the male will usually take part in rearing both broods.

If eggs or chicks are predated, the female will often leave the male, who then resumes singing and pairs with another female. Hybridisation with the Eurasian reed warbler has been recorded.

The male defends a territory of around 0.1 to 0.2 hectares; in a study at Zaanstad, Netherlands, 68 territories were studied, with an average size of 1064 metres square one year, and 904 m sq the next. The nest, built by the female, is in vegetation on the ground or up to a height of . The cup-shaped structure has an outer layer of grass, stems and leaves, plus spiders&#x27; webs, with a thick, finer layer inside including reed flowers, animal hair and plant down. It is woven around vertical plant stems. From 3 to 5 greenish-yellow and brown-mottled eggs are laid, measuring 18 x 13 mm and weighing 1.6 g each. They are incubated by the female for 14 days; the chicks are altricial and naked. Both male and female care for the chicks, which fledge after 13–14 days. After leaving the nest, young sedge warblers continue begging for food from their parents for 1 to 2 weeks after learning to fly.

===Food and feeding===
Prey taken by sedge warblers includes mayflies, dragonflies and damselflies, grasshoppers, bugs, lacewings, moths, beetles and flies. Vegetable material includes elderberries and blackberries. On their wintering grounds food includes non-biting midges and flowers and berries from the toothbrush tree.

In late July, prior to migration, it appears that sedge warblers seek out sites with large numbers of plum-reed aphids and stay there longer than at other places; ringing studies show that birds may move considerable distances (e.g. from southern England to northern France) in search of food before beginning their actual migration. In Portugal, the aphid supply dries up too early for sedge warblers to utilise it, so many birds do not stop off there and are already heavy with fat when they pass through. Birds with the heaviest fat reserves built up before migration are capable of non-stop flights from Africa to southern Britain, or from Uganda to Iraq, for example. Some double their normal weight when &#x27;fuelling&#x27; for migration. Lighter birds are forced to make the journey in several shorter parts.

Sedge warblers feed in low, thick vegetation, especially reeds and rushes, but also in arable fields and around bushes. A study at Attenborough, Nottinghamshire in England, found that the habitats used for foraging during the breeding season were 47% marshland, mostly &quot;Glyceria&quot; grasses, 26% shrub, 21% field vegetation and 6% woodland. Feeding techniques include &#x27;picking&#x27; insects from vegetation while perched or sometimes hovering, and &#x27;leap-catching&#x27;, when the bird grabs flying insects as it flies between perches. Sedge warblers tend to hop between plant stems and pick insects from underneath leaves; they take advantage of the low temperatures around dusk and dawn which make their prey less mobile.

<text>The aquatic warbler (Acrocephalus paludicola) is an Old World warbler in the genus &quot;Acrocephalus&quot;. It breeds in temperate eastern Europe and western Asia, with an estimated population of 11,000-15,000 pairs. It is migratory, wintering in west Africa. After many years of uncertainty, the wintering grounds of much of the European population were finally discovered in Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary, Senegal, with between 5,000 and 10,000 birds present at this single site. Its south-westerly migration route means that it is regular on passage as far west as Great Britain and Ireland.

This small passerine bird is a species found in wet sedge beds with vegetation shorter than . Drainage has meant that this species has declined, and its stronghold is now the Polesie region of eastern Poland and south Belarus, where 70% of the world&#x27;s population breeds. 3–5 eggs are laid in a nest in low vegetation. This species is highly promiscuous, with most males and females having offspring with multiple partners.

This is a medium-sized warbler. The adult has a heavily streaked brown back and pale underparts with variable streaking. The forehead is flattened, and the bill is strong and pointed. There is a prominent whitish supercilium and crown stripe.

It can be confused with the juvenile sedge warbler, which may show a crown stripe, but the marking is stronger in this species, which appears paler and spiky-tailed in flight. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are unstreaked on the breast below. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous, but will take other small food items, including berries.

The song is a fast, chattering &quot;ja-ja-ja&quot; punctuated with typically acrocephaline whistles.

The genus name &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;akros&quot;, &quot;highest&quot;, and &quot;kephale&quot;, &quot;head&quot;. It is possible that Naumann and Naumann thought &quot;akros&quot; meant &quot;sharp-pointed&quot;. The specific &quot;paludicola&quot; is Latin, from &quot;paludis&quot;, &quot;swamp&quot;, and &quot;colere&quot;, &quot;to inhabit&quot;.
== Conservation ==
The aquatic warbler is the rarest and the only internationally threatened passerine bird found in mainland Europe. Apart from a very small remnant population in Western Siberia, its breeding grounds are completely confined to Europe.

The main threat the species is facing is the loss/degradation of habitat due to draining of wetlands, the decline of traditional, extensive agriculture and overgrowing of the species&#x27; habitat with reeds and bushes or trees. Under the auspices of the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), also known as the Bonn Convention, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) concerning Conservation Measures for the Aquatic Warbler was concluded and came into effect on 30 April 2003. The MoU covers 22 range States (Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russian Federation, Senegal, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine and United Kingdom). As of August 2012, 16 range States have signed the MoU. This instrument provides the basis for governments, NGO&#x27;s and scientists to work together to save the species and their habitat.

Much of the funding for habitat protection for this species has come from the EU&#x27;s LIFE programme.

=== Conservation methods ===
The main method employed to protect the species from extinction is habitat restoration. Bushes, reeds and trees are cut down. An adequate level of water regulation is achieved through hydraulic equipment installation.

In order to protect the bird&#x27;s offspring, farmers need to select optimal grassland mowing time (as late as 15 of August) and choose environment-friendly mowing technologies. As the late-cut grass isn&#x27;t suitable for feeding making these measures economically unfavorable, farmers who agree to help out receive state issued compensations. The unusable late-cut grass is taken to processing plants that recycle it into biofuel/grass pellets. 

=== Translocations ===
Due to small and fragmented populations of aquatic warbler within Lithuania, translocation to the Žuvintas biosphere reserve in Lithuania became necessary as a method to reverse declining genetic diversity in the region.

During the species&#x27; first translocation In June 2018, the Lithuanian Baltic Environmental Forum (BEF) successfully translocated, raised, and released 49 aquatic warbler chicks from Zvanec Belarus to the Žuvintas biosphere reserve in Lithuania. By the end of the 2019 summer breeding season, 11 (22%) of the translocated birds returned to the Žuvintas biosphere reserve.

In the summer of 2019, the BEF successfully translocated, raised, and released an additional 50 birds from Zvanec Belarus to the Žuvintas biosphere reserve.

<text>Lyman Louis Lemnitzer (29 August 1899 – 12 November 1988) was a United States Army general who served as the fourth chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1960 to 1962. He then served as the Supreme Allied Commander Europe of NATO from 1963 to 1969. As chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Lemnitzer was responsible for drafting Operation Northwoods, a proposed plan to create support for military action against Cuba, by orchestrating false flag terrorism acts in the United States. 

==Early life and education==
Lemnitzer was born on August 29, 1899, in Honesdale, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Honesdale High School in 1917.

He then entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, from which he graduated in 1920 with a commission as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps.
==Early career==
Lemnitzer graduated from the Coast Artillery School in 1921, and then served at Fort Adams in Rhode Island and in the Philippines. He was an instructor at West Point from 1926 to 1930.

Lemnitzer served again in the Philippines from 1934 to 1935, and graduated from the United States Army Command and General Staff College in 1936. He was an instructor at the Coast Artillery School, and graduated from the United States Army War College in 1940.

At the start of World War II Lemnitzer served with the 70th Coast Artillery Regiment and then the 38th Coast Artillery Brigade. In May 1941, Lemnitzer, then a colonel, was assigned to the War Plans Division of the Army staff, and then to the staff of the Army Ground Forces.

==World War II==
Lemnitzer was promoted to brigadier general in June 1942 and commanded the 34th Coast Artillery Brigade. He was subsequently assigned to General Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s staff, where he helped plan the invasions of North Africa and Sicily and was promoted to major general in November 1944. Lemnitzer was one of the senior officers sent to negotiate the Italian fascist surrender during the secret Operation Sunrise and the German surrender in 1945.

==Postwar career==
Following the end of World War II, Lemnitzer was assigned to the Strategic Survey Committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and was later named deputy commandant of the National War College. In 1950, at the age of 51, Lemnitzer took parachute training and was placed in command of the 11th Airborne Division. He was assigned to Korea in command of the 7th Infantry Division in November 1951 and was promoted to lieutenant general in August 1952.
Lemnitzer was promoted to the rank of general and named commander-in-chief of Far East Command and of the Eighth Army in March 1955. He was the final officer to hold the title of Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers which oversaw the postwar occupation of Japan. He was appointed vice chief of staff of the Army in June 1957, chief of staff of the Army in July 1959. He was appointed chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September 1960 allowing to remain on active duty despite having reached the mandatory retirement age of 60. As chairman, Lemnitzer was involved in the Bay of Pigs crisis and the early years of United States involvement in the Vietnam War. He was also required to testify before the United States Senate Foreign Affairs Committee about his knowledge of the activities of Major General Edwin Walker, who had been dismissed from the Army over alleged attempts to promote his political beliefs in the military.

As chairman, Lemnitzer approved the plans known as Operation Northwoods in 1962, a proposed plan to discredit the Castro regime and create support for military action against Cuba by orchestrating false flag acts of terrorism and developing &quot;a Communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washington&quot;. Lemnitzer presented the plans to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara on13 March 1962. It is unclear how McNamara reacted, but three days later President John F. Kennedy told the general that there was no chance that the US would take military action against Cuba. Within a few months, after the refusal to endorse Operation Northwoods, Lemnitzer was denied another term as chairman.

In November 1962, Lemnitzer was appointed as commander of U.S. European Command and as NATO&#x27;s Supreme Allied Commander Europe, which was a positional demotion from being chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. His time in command saw the Cyprus crisis of 1963–1964 and the withdrawal of NATO forces from France in 1966. Known somewhat for his eccentric personality, instead of carrying in place a regulation M1911 semi-automatic pistol which was commonly used by general officers, General Lemnitzer preferred to carry a long-barrelled M-16 Rifle as his personal firearm. Lemnitzer is the only person to serve as chairman of the Joint Chiefs Staff and then serve in another U.S. military command after his term as chairman ended.

==Later life and death==

Lemnitzer retired from the military in July 1969. His 14-year tenure as a four star general on active duty is the second longest at that rank in the history of the U.S. Army, after General William T. Sherman who held that rank from 1869 to 1884. He was the only person in history to serve as Army Chief of Staff, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and as Supreme Allied Commander for NATO.

General Lemnitzer is one of only four officers in the history of the United States Army to have actively served as a general during three major wars (World War II, Korea and Vietnam). The others were Winfield Scott (War of 1812, Mexican War, Civil War), Douglas MacArthur (World War I, World War II and Korea) and Lewis Hershey (World War II, Korea, Vietnam).

In 1975, President Gerald Ford appointed Lemnitzer to the Commission on CIA Activities within the United States, also known as the Rockefeller Commission, to investigate whether the CIA had committed acts that violated US laws, and allegations that E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis (of Watergate fame) were involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

Lemnitzer died at Walter Reed Army Medical Center on 12 November 1988, and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His wife, Katherine Tryon Lemnitzer (1901–1994), is buried with him.

==Awards and decorations==
Lemnitzer was awarded numerous military awards and decorations including but not limited to:
;Foreign decorations
Lemnitzer was a Freemason. His portrait as Supreme Allied Commander Europe shows him wearing a masonic ring.

<doc id="347649" wikidata="Q11680900" url="?curid=347649" title="Imperial Court in Kyoto">
<text>The Imperial Court in [[Kyoto]] was the nominal ruling government of Japan from 794 AD until the Meiji period (1868–1912), after which the court was moved from Kyoto (formerly Heian-kyō) to Tokyo (formerly Edo) and integrated into the Meiji government. Upon the court being moved to Kyoto from Nagaoka by Emperor Kanmu (737–806), the struggles for power regarding the throne that had characterized the Nara period diminished. Kyoto was selected as the location for the court because of its &quot;proper&quot; amount of rivers and mountains which were believed to be the most auspicious surroundings for the new capital. The capital itself was built in imitation of Chang&#x27;an, the Chinese capital of the Tang dynasty, closely following the theories of yin-yang. The most prominent group of people within the court was the civil aristocracy (kuge) which was the ruling class of society that exercised power on behalf of the emperor.

Kyoto&#x27;s identity as a political, economic, and cultural centre started to be challenged in the post-1185 era with the rise of the shogunate system which gradually seized governance from the emperor. Minamoto no Yoritomo was the first to establish the post of the shōgun as hereditary, receiving the title in 1192. After Yoritomo launched the shogunate, true political power was in the hand of the &quot;shōguns&quot;, who were mistaken several times for the emperors of Japan by representatives of Western countries. The Kamakura shogunate (or Kamakura bakufu) would go on to last for almost 150 years, from 1185 to 1333.

<doc id="347650" wikidata="Q138123" url="?curid=347650" title="Abdul Ali Mazari">
<text>[[Ustad]] Abdul Ali Mazari (; 5 June 194613 March 1995) was a Hazara politician and leader of the Hezbe Wahdat during and following the Soviet–Afghanistan War,who advocated for a federal system of governance in Afghanistan. He believed that this would end political and ethnic division in Afghanistan by guaranteeing rights to every ethnic group. He was allegedly captured and murdered by the Taliban during negotiations in 1995. He was commonly known as Baba Mazari for his leadership of Hezbe Wahdat within the Hazara community.

In 2016, he was posthumously given the title &quot;Martyr for National Unity of Afghanistan&quot; and had a statue erected in his honor by the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Shortly after reclaiming power, the Taliban demolished the statue.

== Early life ==
Abdul Ali Mazari, son of Haji Khudaidad, was born in 1946 in the Charkent district of Balkh province, south of the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif. He began his primary schooling in theology at the local school in his hometown, then went to Mazar-e-Sharif and later to Qom, Iran and Najaf, Iraq.

== Mujahideen commander and politician ==
After the Saur Revolution on 27 April 1978, Mazari fled to Najaf, later to Syria, and then to Pakistan temporarily. During the Soviet–Afghan War, Mazari returned to Afghanistan and gained a prominent place in the mujahideen resistance movement. During the first years of the resistance, he lost his young brother, Muhammed Sultan, during a battle against the Afghan Army. He soon lost his sister and other members of his family in the resistance. His uncle, Muhammad Jafar, and his son, Muhammad Afzal, were imprisoned and executed by the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. His father, Haji Khudaidad, and his brother, Haji Muhammad Nabi, were killed as well in the war.

Abdul Ali Mazari was one of the founding members and the first leader of the Hezb-e Wahdat. In the first party congress in Bamyan, he was elected leader of the Central Committee and in the second congress, he was elected Secretary General. Mazari&#x27;s initiative led to the creation of the &quot;Jonbesh-e Shomal&quot; (Northern Movement), in which the country&#x27;s most significant military forces joined ranks with the rebels, leading to a coup d&#x27;état and the eventual downfall of the Communist regime in Kabul.

After the 1992 fall of Kabul, the Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement, the Peshawar Accords, which created the Islamic State of Afghanistan and appointed an interim government for a transitional period to be followed by general elections. According to Human Rights Watch:
The sovereignty of Afghanistan was vested formally in the Islamic State of Afghanistan, an entity created in April 1992, after the fall of the Soviet-backed Najibullah government. ... With the exception of Pashtun warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar&#x27;s Hezb-e Islami, all of the parties... were ostensibly unified under this government in April 1992. ... Hekmatyar&#x27;s Hezbe Islami, for its part, refused to recognize the government for most of the period discussed in this report and launched attacks against government forces but the shells and rockets fell everywhere in Kabul resulting in many civilian casualties.
Although Hezb-e Wahdat initially participated in the Islamic State and held some posts in the government, conflict soon broke out between the Hazara Hezb-e Wahdat of Mazari and the Pashtun Ittihad-e Islami of Abdur Rasul Sayyaf. The Islamic State&#x27;s defense minister Ahmad Shah Massoud tried to mediate between the factions with some success, but the cease-fire remained only temporary. In June 1992, the Hezb-e Wahdat and the Ittihad-i Islami engaged in violent street battles against each other. With the support of Saudi Arabia, Sayyaf&#x27;s forces repeatedly attacked the western suburbs of Kabul resulting in heavy civilian casualties. Likewise, Mazari&#x27;s Iran-supported forces that were also accused of attacking civilian targets in the west. Mazari acknowledged taking Pashtun civilians as prisoners, but defended the action by saying that Sayyaf&#x27;s forces took Hazaras first, adding that the prisoners taken by his forces were housed, fed, given water, and not tortured. While there is disagreement as to who started the conflict, it is well-documented that there were heavy civilian casualties and human rights abuses on all sides. In January 1993, faced with an offensive by Jamiat forces against both parties, Mazari&#x27;s group and Hekmatyar&#x27;s group began cooperating with one another.

In September 1994, following accusations against Abdul Ali Mazari of committing a coup within the party&#x27;s leadership, senior Hezb-e Wahdat member Muhammad Akbari separated from Mazari to form the National Islamic Unity Party of Afghanistan, which aligned itself with the Taliban and gained the support of the majority of party members in the Hazara hinterland and some surrounding regions, particularly in Panjab district, Waras district, Uruzgan province, Helmand province, and Sar-e pol province. Although Mazari&#x27;s influence was heavily reduced by the split, he was able to retain the allegiance of the majority of Hezb-e Wahdat members in western Kabul, Yakawlang district, Wardak province, and Mazar-i-Sharif city.

== Death ==

According to &quot;Hazara Press&quot;, On March 12, 1995, the Taliban requested a meeting with Mazari and a delegation from the Islamic Wahdat Central Party Abuzar Ghaznawi, Ekhlaasi, Eid Mohammad Ibrahimi Behsudi, Ghassemi, Jan Mohammad, Sayed Ali Alavi, Bahodari, and Jan Ali in Chahar Asiab, near the city of Kabul. On their arrival, the group was abducted and tortured. A Western journalist reported seeing Mazari in the Taliban captivity with his hands and feet bound. The following day Mazari was killed and his body was found in Ghazni. The Taliban issued a statement that Mazari had attacked the Taliban guards while being flown to Kandahar. Later, his body and those of his companions were handed over to Hezb-e Wahdat, mutilated and showing signs of torture.

According to the Taliban&#x27;s &quot;Al Somood&quot; magazine, claims of him being killed deliberately are false, and he died in an accident involving a helicopter crash near Ghazni. Taliban-affiliated researcher Mustafa Hamid described the Taliban&#x27;s version of events surrounding the death of Abdul Ali Mazari in detail, stating that it began with Mazari and a group accompanying him being detained by the Taliban during a routine inspection of taxis passing through a village on the outskirts of Kabul. At the request of Taliban officials, he was thereafter placed on a helicopter leaving Kabul. Having become suspicious of the Taliban&#x27;s intentions, Mazari and his partners snatched the weapon of one of the Taliban guards whilst mid-flight, killing another one of the guards and injuring the pilot. This caused the Helicopter to violently crash over the province of Ghazni, killing everyone on board. The crash of the aircraft attracted the attention of a nearby Taliban patrol, who found Mazari&#x27;s deceased body onboard. However, locals denied seeing any evidence of a helicopter crash, and the Taliban did not publicly disclose the exact location of the crash.

Mazari&#x27;s body, after being handed over by the Taliban, was carried by his followers on foot from Ghazni across Hazarajat to Mazar-e-Sharif (at the time under the control of his ally Abdur Rashid Dustom) in heavy snow over forty days. Hundreds of thousands attended his funeral in Mazar-e-Sharif. Mazari was officially named &quot;Martyr for National Unity of Afghanistan&quot; in 2016 by the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and a statue of him was erected in Bamiyan, a Hazara cultural hub. Shortly after retaking power, the Taliban demolished the statue and renamed Bamiyah square, which had been named in his honor. This prompted outcry from the Hazara population, who see Mazari as a beloved figure.

<text>The marsh warbler (Acrocephalus palustris) is an Old World warbler currently classified in the family Acrocephalidae. It breeds in temperate Europe and the western Palearctic and winters mainly in southeast Africa. It is notable for incorporating striking imitations of a wide variety of other birds into its song.

The marsh warbler breeds in a variety of mostly damp habitats, but in Africa winters mainly in dry, well-vegetated areas. It is common over much of its breeding range and expanding its distribution in some areas. However, in Britain it is now virtually extinct as a breeding bird, though the reasons for its decline are unclear. This insectivorous warbler can be easily confused with several close relatives, but the imitative song of the male is highly distinctive.

==Taxonomy==
The marsh warbler was formally described in 1798 by the German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein under the scientific name &quot;Motacilla s. Sylvia palustris&quot;.
The type locality is Germany. The marsh warbler is now one of around 40 species placed in the genus &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; that was introduced by Johann Andreas Naumann and his son Johann Friedrich Naumann in 1811. The genus name &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; is . It is possible that the Naumanns thought &quot;akros&quot; meant . The specific is from Latin and means . The species is considered as monotypic, and there is no significant geographical variation.

==Description==
This is a medium-sized warbler. It is very similar in appearance to several other acrocephaline warblers, such as the reed warbler which also occurs in wetlands and has a similar breeding range. The male&#x27;s distinctive song is useful for identification, as no other member of the genus mimics other birds to any significant extent. The marsh warbler also tends to avoid the stands of pure reed which are the reed warbler&#x27;s favoured habitat. The sexes are alike in appearance. Hybridisation with both reed warbler and Blyth&#x27;s reed warbler has been occasionally recorded.

The marsh warbler is best known for the highly imitative song uttered by males, and very occasionally by females. Each male marsh warbler incorporates imitations of a wide range of other birds into its song. Other passerines are most commonly imitated, but the calls of other kinds of bird such as waders, hornbills and pigeons have been noted too. On average, each male bird incorporates imitations of 75 other species into its song, with rather more African than northern species mimicked. All learning seems to take place in the summer the bird is hatched in Europe or Asia, and in its first winter in Africa. The calls of birds heard in subsequent years are not added to the warbler&#x27;s repertoire. Females may utter a simple, non-imitative song, and a range of other calls are also known.

==Distribution and habitat==

The marsh warbler breeds in the middle latitudes of Europe and western Asia, from the English Channel to about 70 degrees east. It mainly occupies areas with a continental climate, but breeds, or has bred, in Britain and northern France as well. It is principally a bird of the lowlands, but occurs at altitudes of up to 3000m in Georgia. In recent decades it has expanded its range to the north, with increasing numbers of birds breeding in Scandinavia and north-west Russia. Singing males are occasionally heard in Ireland, most recently in 2017.

In western Europe the marsh warbler breeds mainly in rank vegetation on damp or seasonally flooded soils, and is particularly attracted to tall herbaceous vegetation such as nettles, meadowsweet, willowherbs and to young osiers and other low woody plants. It may breed in urban brownfield sites with suitable vegetation, for instance in Berlin, and also occasionally in arable crops. In the eastern part of its range, it breeds on dry hillsides with shrubs and in open woodland, as well as the kind of damper habitats it frequents in the west.

The marsh warbler winters mainly in south-east Africa, from Cape Province north to Zambia and Malawi. It makes use of a range of well-vegetated habitats, from moist scrub to dense thickets and woodland edge, at altitudes up to 2400m. Marsh warblers tend to migrate from Europe to Africa via the Middle East, with many crossing Arabia and arriving in Africa on Sudan&#x27;s Red Sea coast. Adults usually leave their breeding grounds soon after their young are independent, with their offspring following about two weeks later. On the Red Sea coast most birds arrive from mid-August to mid-September, with numbers of adults peaking in August and of young birds in September. Birds tend to spend much of the autumn somewhere in north-east or east Africa, before continuing south to arrive on their wintering grounds in December or January.

In spring, marsh warblers leave their wintering grounds in March or April. They are thought to follow broadly similar routes to their autumn migration. Birds breeding in south-east Europe, for instance on the Black Sea coast, may arrive there by late April. In other parts of their range, the majority of birds do not arrive until mid-May. On the western and northern edge of their range, such as in England, birds do not tend to arrive until the end of May or early June.

As a vagrant, the species has been recorded as far away as Iceland and Madeira.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===

The species is usually monogamous. Marsh warblers tend to choose new mates each year and do not necessarily return to breed in the same area as previous years. On their breeding grounds they are territorial, with territories often grouped into loose colonies. In Africa, they are essentially solitary, and may defend territories to some extent. The nest is a cup, made mostly from leaves and plant stems, and is usually in dense vegetation, at varying heights. Three to six eggs are laid. Both sexes bring food to the nestlings. In continental Europe at least, the species has a short breeding season, of 52–55 days. In some areas, such as Bulgaria, marsh warblers suffer significant levels of parasitism by common cuckoos.

===Food and feeding===
The marsh warbler is mostly insectivorous, but also takes some spiders and small numbers of snails. It generally gleans insects from vegetation but sometimes catches them on the ground or in mid-air. In autumn small numbers of berries may be eaten. There have been no detailed studies of the bird&#x27;s diet in Africa, though foraging techniques during winter are known to be very similar to those in other seasons.

==Conservation==
Globally, the population is believed to be increasing, and the IUCN categorises the species as of least concern. It is estimated to have a total population of 10 to 27 million individuals.

In Britain the species was never widespread, and disappeared from many areas from the 1930s onwards. By the 1970s marsh warblers bred in significant numbers only in Worcestershire, where 40-70 pairs were recorded each year. This population was effectively extinct by the end of the 1990s. From the 1970s and 1980s onwards, a very small population slowly developed in south-east England. However, this population is also now close to extinction. The reasons for the population decline in Britain are not completely understood, despite there appearing to be much suitable habitat. The Biodiversity Action Plan for the species further comments that it is not clear what can be done to conserve the species apart from protecting habitat at known breeding sites and protecting birds from egg collectors and from disturbance.

<text>Blyth&#x27;s reed warbler (Acrocephalus dumetorum) is a species of reed warbler belonging to the family Acrocephalidae, which also includes the tree warblers. Blyth&#x27;s reed warbler breeds across the Palearctic zoogeographical region and winters in South Asia. The species has been expanding its range westwards in Europe.

==Taxonomy==
Blyth&#x27;s reed warbler was first formally described in 1849 by the English zoologist Edward Blyth with its type locality given as India. It is classified in the reed warbler genus &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; which was formerly included in the polyphyletic family Sylviidae but is now included in the family Acrocephalidae.

==Etymology==
Blyth&#x27;s reed warbler is named in honour of Edward Blyth, its describer. The genus name &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;akros&quot;, &quot;highest&quot;, and &quot;kephale&quot;, &quot;head&quot;. It is possible that Naumann and Naumann thought &quot;akros&quot; meant &quot;sharp-pointed&quot;. The specific &quot;dumetorum&quot; is from Latin &quot;dumetum&quot;, &quot;thicket&quot;.

==Description==

Blyth&#x27;s reed warbler is between in length and weighs between . It is a slim warbler with relatively short wings and a long bill. The plumage is rather plain with few distinguishing features and has been described as lacking in &quot;warmer&quot; tones observed in related species. The upperparts are plain olive brown, with less olive on the short, rounded wings. There is a short whitish supercilium running between the base of the bill and the eye, with a dusky stripe through the eye. The underparts are plain and off-white in colour. The rather long, thick bill is greyish brown with a pale pinkish-brown base on the lower mandible, which is the colour of the feet and legs.

==Vocalisations==
Blyth&#x27;s reed warbler has a variable song in which harsh sounds like ticks, chaks and churrs are mixed in with melodious whistles and mimicry.

==Distribution and habitat==
Blyth&#x27;s reed warbler breeds from the Baltic Sea in eastern Europe almost as far as Lake Baikal in Siberia, with a southern isolated population in Central Asia. It winters in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar. This species was a rare vagrant to western Europe, although it has been spreading and increasing in numbers in the region, and was found to have bred in the Netherlands in 2022 and in Scotland in 2024. 

In the breeding season, the species prefers the edges of, and clearings within, damp broadleaved woodland, as well as wooded gullies, parks and gardens, scrub and coniferous forest. In the winter, it is found in trees in both wet and dry habitats.

==Biology==
Blyth&#x27;s reed warbler breeds between late May and July. They are typically monogamous, but polygyny has been recorded. They are solitary and territorial; in Finland territories are between . The pair builds a nest that is a compact cup made up of plant material and spiders&#x27; webs and place it above the ground. Between 3 and 6 eggs are laid, and both the male and the female (but predominantly the female) incubate them for 12 to 13 days. The chicks are fed by both parents, and fledging occurs when the chicks are 11 to 13 days old. They remain dependent on their parents for a further 10 to 22 days. The male will on occasion leave the brood after they have fledged; when this happens he is likely looking for another female to breed with, and the first female is left to care for the first brood by herself.

<text>The 38 (Sd.Kfz. 138/2), originally the 38(t), known mostly post-war as , was a German light tank destroyer of the Second World War based on a modified Czechoslovakian Panzer 38(t) chassis.

German armoured forces in World War II created a variety of vehicles by mounting anti-tank guns on the chassis of obsolete tanks. These machines performed better than expected, but were still vulnerable due to their high vehicle profiles and open-topped turrets. Allied bombings took a heavy toll on German production facilities and further increased the need for an easily produced, yet effective light tank destroyer to replace vehicles like the StuG III and Marder series (Marder I, II, and III). Prototypes of the 38 were ready by 1944, and mass production began in April of that year. The 38 was covered entirely with sloped armour and possessed a compact form and low silhouette, giving it much improved defensive ability over other self-propelled guns. Armament consisted of a 7.5 cm Pak 39 L/48 gun and a remote-controlled MG 34. It featured a wide body to accommodate the four-man crew, as well as a strengthened lower hull with enlarged wheels, guide rollers, and tracks.

 38s first entered service in July 1944 and would eventually be assigned to a number of units, including infantry, and divisions. The 38 equipped the (tank destroyer battalions) of the infantry divisions, giving them some limited mobile anti-armor capability. BMM and Škoda continually modified and improved the 38 during production of the more than 2,800 vehicles built. Owing to the ease of production and high operating rates, the 38 came to serve as Germany&#x27;s main tank destroyer in the latter period of the war, making an important contribution on both the Eastern and Western Fronts.

==Name==
The name (German for &quot;chaser&quot;) was never an official or suggestive name used for this vehicle. It was the designation for a related prototype, the E-10. The Škoda factory for a very short period confused the two names in its documentation and the very first unit equipped with the vehicle thus for a few weeks applied the incorrect name until matters were clarified. However, there exists a briefing paper from Heinz Guderian to Hitler saying that an unofficial name, , had spontaneously been coined by the troops. Post-war historians basing themselves on this statement made the name popular in their works.

The &quot;t&quot; in the original designation stands for &quot;&quot; (German for Czech).

==Development==
When Alketts factory for production of Sturmgeschütz III was damaged in a bomb raid on Berlin, on November 26 1943, it become necessary to find alternatives. Boehmisch-Mährische Machinenfabrik was considered but it could not produce the, for that time, heavy chassis of the Sturmgeschütz and it was decided to base a new design on the Panzer 38(t) which they already produced. On 17 December the design drawings for the new vehicle was presented and by January 24 1944 a wooden mock up was ready.

The new Sturmgeschütz was built on the Panzer 38(t)&#x27;s widened and lengthened chassis with modified suspension (larger road-wheels from the Praga TNH n.A prototype reconnaissance tank) and up-rated engine. The new engine was a 160 PS Praga AC/2 6-cylinder engine coupled to a Praga-Wilson gearbox (5 forward and 1 reverse gear). The chassis was modified to accommodate a larger gun and thicker armour than the Panzer 38(t) tank. Its combat weight was 16 metric tons (versus 9.8-tonnes for the Pz 38(t)) and it could travel at a maximum speed of 42 km/h. It had a sloped armour front plate of sloped back at 60 degrees from the vertical - equivalent in protection to about - carried a reasonably powerful 75 mm gun, was mechanically reliable, small and easily concealed. It was also cheap to build.

The Jagdpanzer 38 succeeded the open-top III (based on the same chassis). Starting from April 1944, about 2,584 were built until the end of the war. The older III series retained the same vertically sided chassis as Panzer 38(t). In the 38, the lower hull sides slope 15 degrees outward to make a roughly hexagonal shape when viewed from front or rear. This increased the available interior space and enabled a fully enclosed casemate-style fighting compartment. Because of the fully enclosed armour, it was 5 tonnes heavier than the III. To compensate for the increased weight, track width was increased from 293 mm to 350 mm.

===Production===

The initial production 38 did not sit even with the ground because the gun, transmission and thicker frontal armour weighed the front down. The leaf springs were strengthened from June 1944, which levelled the vehicle. From May–July 1944, accessibility was improved by adding hatches: the commander&#x27;s smaller hatch opening to the rear, one in the right rear corner for radiator access and one in the left rear corner for fuel tank access. From August 1944, lighter inner and outer mantlets reduced the weight by . These were more conical than the half cone shaped initial mantlets. Also from August 1944, new rear idler wheels were introduced that had 8, 6, and 4 (not necessarily in that order) lightening holes instead of 12. These simplified the manufacturing process. In September 1944, the front 16 spring leaves were increased in thickness to per leaf (the rear 16 remained 7 mm thick). Also in September, the side Schürzen&#x27;s front and rear tips were bent inward to prevent them from catching bushes and being torn off. It was discovered that the driver&#x27;s periscope housing acted as a shot trap, preventing incoming shells from bouncing off the front glacis.

The protruding housing was removed, instead the periscope was inserted into vertical cuts to the front armour from October 1944. Also from October 1944, a flame reducing muffler was introduced, which reduced visibility and backfiring. A head cushion was added to the commander&#x27;s hatch from October 1944. At the same time, the road wheel rims were riveted instead of bolted. To cope with the heavy front, and the necessity to traverse the vehicle to aim, the gear ratio was lowered from 1:7.33 to 1:8 to reduce the stress on final gears from January 1945. A buttoned-down 38 was blind to its right side. Since side armour (same as late model Panzer II&#x27;s side armour) was adequate to protect the crew only from fairly small-calibre guns, it was important to face the threat frontally. Hence, the commander&#x27;s field of view was planned to be improved by installing a rotating periscope in the Jagdpanzer 38 Starr, just as the Sturmgeschutz III and Elefant had evolved from a single pair of periscopes to all around vision blocks. However, the 38 came too late to see the action in the field.
After the war, Czechoslovakia continued to build the type (versions ST-I and ST-III for training version, about 180 units built) and exported 158 vehicles (version G-13) to Switzerland. Most vehicles in today&#x27;s collections are of Swiss origin.

By order of Adolf Hitler in November 1944, a number of 38s were refurbished straight from the factory with a Koebe flamethrower and accompanying equipment instead of the normal gun. The flame projector, encased in a metal shield reminiscent of that of a gun barrel, was very prone to damage. Fewer than 50 of these vehicles, designated 38, were completed before the end of the war, but they were used operationally against Allied forces on the Western Front.

Further variants were a 38 carrying the sIG 33/2 Howitzer, of which 30 were produced before the end of the war, and the 38, a light recovery vehicle of which 170 were produced. Plans were made to produce other variants, including an assault gun version of the 38 carrying a 105 mm StuH 42 main cannon, a version mounting the 7.5 cm KwK 42 L/70 gun from the Panther, and an anti-aircraft variant mounted with a Flak turret. The war ended before these proposed models were put into production. Prototypes were also developed for the 38 , this was a simplified version of the Jagdpanzer 38 and also a step towards the E-10. The design removed the recoil absorber from the main 7.5 cm Pak 39 gun, instead attaching the gun to the chassis, and using the 38&#x27;s bulk and suspension to absorb the recoil. Three prototypes were built as were eleven pre-production vehicles, of which one was fitted with a diesel engine. Hitler ordered the one prototype committed to combat to be destroyed rather than let it be captured on 31 March 1945. The army requested on 29 April that the gun sights and traversing gear from the nine pre-production vehicles at the Milowitz proving ground, which it deemed not combat worthy, be removed and sent back to the factory to allow combat-ready vehicles to be completed.

===Variants===

* 38 - Command variant. Fitted with a 30W FuG 8 radio set.
* 38 - 38 modified with a Koebe flamethrower in place of the main gun. Deployed on the Western Front, with first use during the Battle of the Bulge (20 in 352nd and 353rd attached to Army Group G). Less than 50 units produced.
* 38(t) 75mm L/70 - Prototype version experimenting with mounting the 7.5cm KwK 42 L/70 gun from the Panther. 3 prototypes built, but the long gun and extra weight caused even bigger problems driving the vehicles. A proposal by Krupp to modify the 38 with a superstructure to the rear to mount the gun, but no more development was done on this idea.
* 38 - A simplified version of the Jagdpanzer 38, which attached the 7.5cm Pak 39 gun to the chassis, fitted with a Tatra diesel engine. 10 were built, 9 converted back to normal Jagdpanzer 38. The remaining prototype was destroyed at the end of the war.
* 38(t) 105mm StuH 42/2 L/28 - A proposed version of the 38 Starr armed with a 10.5 cm howitzer.
*ST-I - Post-war Czech designation for new manufactured or repaired 38. 249 in service, together with 50 ST-III/CVP driver training vehicles (Unarmed chassis, some with a superstructure). Prototype developments included the Praga VT-III armoured recovery vehicle and PM-I flamethrower tank.
*PM1 - Prototype ST-I variant armed with a flamethrower and machinegun. Only 3 were built between 1949 and 1956

*G13 - Post war version of the 38 built for Switzerland, armed with a StuK 40 gun.

===Designs based on chassis===
*Bergepanzer 38 - A light recovery vehicle, issued to units along with the Jagdpanzer 38. 170 units produced. A prototype was developed to fit the design with a 2cm Flak 38.
*15 cm Schweres Infanteriegeschütz 33/2 (Sf) auf Jagdpanzer 38 - This self-propelled assault gun was developed using the hull of the 38(t) recovery vehicle with a 15 cm sIG 33/2 mounted in a lightly armoured casemate; the vehicle&#x27;s enclosed firing compartment was protected by 10 mm of armoured plate on the front and flanks. Developed by BMM in Prague and intended as a replacement for the battlefield attrition in Grille self-propelled howitzers. Some sources indicated a high probability that the gun was produced at the Alkett plant in Berlin-Marienfelde. 30 built between December 1944 and February 1945.
*Vollkettenaufklärer 38 - Reconnaissance vehicle based on the Bergepanzer 38. Several prototypes tested, mounting single or twin 2cm Flak 38, and in one case a 7.5 cm K51 L/24 gun.
*Vollkettenaufklärer 38 Kätzchen - A fully tracked reconnaissance vehicle based on the Jagdpanzer} 38. Prototypes were built by BMM and ordered into production, but never built. The prototypes were believed to have been destroyed before the end of the war.
*Flakpanzer 38 Kugelblitz - A proposal to mount the turret from a Flakpanzer IV Kugelblitz on a Jagdpanzer 38 chassis. No production due to the war situation.
*Panzerjäger 38 with Panzer IV turret - a Krupp proposal to mount the turret of a Panzer IV with a 7.5 cm KwK 40 or 8 cm PAW 600 gun on the chassis of Panzerjäger 38. The proposal was not pursued.
*Jagdpanzer 38 D - A larger version of the &quot;Panzerjager&quot; 38(t); prototype only, though mass production was planned.

==Performance==
The Jagdpanzer 38 fit into the lighter category of German tank destroyers that began with the Panzerjäger I, continued with the Marder series, and ended with the Jagdpanzer 38. The 75 mm Pak 39 L/48 gun of the Jagdpanzer 38 was a modified version of the 75 mm StuK 40 L/48 used in the &quot;StuG III&quot; and &quot;StuG IV&quot; assault guns. With this gun, the Jagdpanzer 38 was able to destroy nearly all Allied or Soviet tank types in service at long ranges (except heavy tanks), and its fully enclosed armour protection made it a safer vehicle to crew than the open-topped Marder II or Marder III series.

The vehicle could carry two different armour-piercing shells for the Pak 39 gun: the Pzgr. 40 high-velocity tungsten cored round, which fired a projectile at 930 m/s that could penetrate 120 mm of armour at 500 meters and 97 mm at 1,000 meters, striking at a 30-degree angle, but was often in scarce supply; and the Pzgr. 39 armour-piercing, capped, ballistic capped shell (APCBC) with explosive filler and a tracer element, launching a heavier projectile at 750 m/s that could pierce of armour at 500 meters and 95 mm at 1,000 meters. Based on tests using Pzgr. 39 ammunition, with correct range estimation and competent gunnery, a 99% chance of a first-shot hit at 500 m and a 71% chance at 1,000 m was estimated. The vehicle also carried standard high-explosive rounds and the Gr. 38 HL/C high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round designed with a shaped charge, but this was less effective and accurate against armoured targets than AP rounds.

The Jagdpanzer 38 was one of the most common late-war German tank destroyers. It was available in relatively large numbers and was generally mechanically reliable. Like some other late-war German SPGs, the Jagdpanzer 38 mounted a remote-control machine gun mount that could be fired from within the vehicle. This proved popular with crews, though to reload the gun, a crewmember needed to expose himself to enemy fire.

The vehicle&#x27;s small size made it easier to conceal than larger vehicles. A self-propelled gun such as this was not intended for a mobile, meeting engagement or the typical Wehrmacht blitzkrieg style of warfare. Instead, a light self-propelled gun like the 38 excelled when emplaced along pre-determined lines of sight where the enemy was expected to approach and when used in defensive positions to support a prepared ambush. The 38 is similar in its dimensions and vertical profile to the minuscule and undergunned Panzer II, a prewar tank. However, by 1944, the majority of tanks were much larger and heavier; a 38 waiting motionless in an ambush position was a much smaller target to detect and hit than many other armoured fighting vehicles of the time. Its main failings were comparatively thin side armour, limited ammunition storage, poor gun traverse, and a poor internal layout that made operating the vehicle difficult, as well as leaf springs and drive wheels that were prone to failure due to the increased weight. Using the 38 and similar vehicles according to a defensive doctrine would offset some of the disadvantages of poor side armour and limited gun traverse.

==Operational history==
: The 38 first entered service with the &quot;Heeres Panzerjäger-Abteilung&quot; 731 in July 1944. This unit was sent to Army Group North on the Eastern Front. One report from the Eastern Front described how a company of Jagdpanzer 38 destroyed 20 enemy tanks without any losses.
: 75 38s were used by the Royal Hungarian Army. 
: After King Michael&#x27;s Coup in 1944, Romania had captured two Hetzers and had used them for a while before they were confiscated by the Red Army. While Romania was still an Axis power, Germany had decided to give them 15 Jagdpanzer 38s. In the meantime, the Royal Coup had happened, so Romania never received the vehicles. As part of a proposed joint production of the Mareșal and Jagdpanzer 38, Germany even gave Romania the licence to produce the Jagdpanzer 38. It&#x27;s not known whether any examples were produced in Romania.
: One captured by the Home Army, nicknamed &quot;Chwat&quot; (&quot;daredevil&quot;), during the Warsaw Uprising. At least two captured vehicles, used by the Polish People&#x27;s Army, post-war.
: 249 vehicles of the ST-I variant were used.
: 158 vehicles of the G-13 version were used.

==Survivors==

Due to the large number produced, the 38 is probably the most abundant World War II German tank destroyer remaining today, though many survivors are actually post-war Swiss G-13 and Czech ST-I variants. In addition to the numerous examples in museums, there are 38s of various conditions in private collections. In 2007, a 38 was recovered from the Baltic Sea in Jurata, Poland. As of 2012, it was being restored in Gdańsk.

<text>The great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) is an insectivorous bird in the family Acrocephalidae. It is a medium-sized passerine bird and the largest of the European warblers. It breeds throughout mainland Europe and the Western Palearctic and migrates to sub-Saharan Africa in the winter. It favours reed beds during the breeding season, while living in reed beds, bush thickets, rice fields, and forest clearings during the winter. It exhibits relatively low sexual dimorphism, and the sexes are similar in appearance. This species mates both polygynously and monogamously.

==Taxonomy==
The great reed warbler was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the thrushes in the genus &quot;Turdus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Turdus arundinaceus&quot;. He specified the type locality as Northern Europe. Linnaeus based his entry on the &quot;Turdus musicus palustris&quot; or &quot;Bruch Beiden Rohr Drossel&quot; that had been described in 1750 by the German naturalist Jacob Theodor Klein in his book &quot;Historiae avium prodromus&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;arundinaceus&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;like a read&quot; (hence &quot;of the reeds&quot;), from &quot;arundo&quot;, &quot;arundinis&quot; meaning &quot;reed&quot;. The great reed warbler is now one of 42 species placed in the genus &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; that was introduced in 1811 by the German naturalist Johann Andreas Naumann and his son Johann Friedrich Naumann.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;A. a. arundinaceus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Europe to north Iran and northwest Arabia
* &quot;A. a. zarudnyi&quot; Hartert, EJO, 1907 – southeast European Russia and north Iran to northwest Mongolia and northwest China

== Description ==
The thrush-sized warbler is one of the largest species of the former family, the Old World warblers and it stands as one of the largest species in the family Acrocephalidae. It measures in length, in wingspan and weighs . The adult has unstreaked brown upperparts and dull buffish-white chin and underparts. The forehead is flattened, and the bill is strong and pointed. It looks very much like a giant common reed warbler (&quot;Acrocephalus scirpaceus&quot;), but with a stronger supercilium. The sexes are identical, as with most old world warblers, but young birds are richer buff below.

The warbler&#x27;s song is very loud and far-carrying. The song&#x27;s main phrase is a chattering and creaking &quot;carr-carr-cree-cree-cree-jet-jet&quot;, to which the whistles and vocal mimicry typical of marsh warblers are added.

==Distribution and habitat==

The great reed warbler breeds in Europe and the west Palearctic. It does not breed in Great Britain - where it is replaced by the closely related common reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus scirpaceus&quot; - but is an irregular visitor. Its population has in recent decades increased around the eastern Baltic Sea, while it has become rarer at the western end of its range. It is a migratory bird, wintering in tropical Africa. This bird migrates north at a rather late date, and some birds remain in their winter quarters until the end of April.

The mtDNA haplotype data indicate that during the last glacial period there were two allopatric populations of great reed warbler. The great reed warblers in southwestern and southeastern Europe were at that time apparently separated by the Vistulian-Würm ice sheets and the surrounding barren lands. Though the data are insufficient to robustly infer a date for this separation, it suggests the populations became separated around 80,000 years ago – coincident with the first major advance of the ice sheets. The populations must have expanded their range again at the start of the Holocene about 13,000 years ago, but even today the western birds winter in the west and the eastern birds in the east of tropical Africa.

During 2017–2019, miniature data loggers were used to track migratory flights of great reed warblers, over the Mediterranean Sea and Sahara Desert, between their breeding grounds at Lake Kvismaren, Sweden, and their winter quarters in sub-Saharan Africa. When over the Sahara Desert, some birds would ascend to altitudes exceeding 5 km. As of 2023, these are the highest recorded avian ascents. 

For comparison, such altitudes are comparable to those of the summits of the highest mountains in Africa and Europe. Possible explanations for such high--altitude ascents include avoidance of predation, reduction of risk of hyperthermia and dehydration, and extension of the visual horizon. 

This passerine bird is found in large reed beds, often with some bushes. On their breeding grounds, they are territorial. In their winter quarters, they are frequently found in large groups, and may occupy a reed bed to the exclusion of other birds. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous, but it will take other prey items of small size, including vertebrates such as tadpoles.

The great reed warbler undergoes marked long-term population fluctuations, and it is able to expand its range quickly when new habitat becomes available. This common and widespread bird is considered a species of least concern by the IUCN. Population size can be calculated with a suitability model, but direct counts of territorial males in suitable habitat and sampling the population sex-ratio can be a proper alternative to inference-rich predictive modeling based on imperfect habitat-extrapolation of densities of reed warblers at large spatial scales.

==Behaviour==

===Diet===
The great reed warbler has a primarily carnivorous diet. Observation of prey collection specifically during breeding season has shown the retrieval of insect larvae, moths, dragonflies, damselflies, beetles, spiders, small fish, and frogs. It has also been reported to eat fruit during non-breeding seasons. Nestlings typically feed on diptera and arachnids, though this may not be their preferred food.

===Communication and courtship===


Male great reed warblers have been observed to communicate via two basic song types: short songs about one second in length with few syllables, and long songs of about four seconds that have more syllables and are louder than the short variety. It has been observed that long songs are primarily used by males to attract females; long songs are only given spontaneously by unpaired males, and cease with the arrival of a female. Short songs, however, are primarily used in territorial encounters with rival males.

During experimental observation, male great reed warblers showed reluctance to approach recordings of short songs, and when lured in by long songs, would retreat when playback was switched to short songs.

Traditionally, monogamous species of genus &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; use long, variable, and complex songs to attract mates, whereas polygynous varieties use short, simple, stereotypical songs for territorial defence. There is evidence that long songs have been evolved through intersexual selection, whereas short songs have been evolved through intrasexual selection. The great reed warbler is a notable example of these selective pressures, as it is a partial polygynist and has evolved variable song structure (both long and short) through evolutionary compromise.

In addition to communication, the great reed warbler&#x27;s song size has been implicated in organism fitness and reproductive success. Though no direct relationship has been found between song size and either territory size or beneficial male qualities, such as wing length, weight, or age, strong correlation has been observed between repertoire size and territory quality. Furthermore, partial correlation analysis has shown that territory quality has significant effect on the number of females obtained, while repertoire length is linked to the number of young produced.

===Mating system and sexual behavior===

Great reed warbler females lay 3–6 eggs in an open cup-nest in reeds. Some pairs of warblers are monogamous, but others are not, and unpaired, so-called &quot;satellite&quot; males still father some young. Great reed warblers defend their nests using graded alarm calls, directed towards a wide range of enemies, although these alarm calls might reveal the whereabouts of the nest to brood parasites.

A long-term study of the factors that contribute to male fitness examined the characteristics of males and territories in relation to annual and lifetime breeding success. It showed that the arrival order of the male was the most significant factor for predicting pairing success, fledgling success, and number of offspring that survive. It also found that arrival order was closely correlated with territory attractiveness rank. Females seem to prefer early arriving males that occupy more attractive territories. These females also tend to gain direct benefits through the increased production of fledglings and offspring that become adults. In addition, male song repertoire length is positively correlated to annual harem size and overall lifetime production of offspring that survive. Song repertoire size alone is able to predict male lifetime number of surviving offspring. Females tend to be attracted to males with longer song repertoires since they tend to sire offspring with improved viability. In doing so, they gain indirect benefits for their own young.

Great reed warblers have a short, polygynous breeding cycle in which the male contributes little to parental care. They defend large territories in reed beds where there is reduced visibility, which may allow males to practice deception by moving and attracting a second female. This second female may not realize that the male has already mated. Polygyny of the great reed warbler was assessed in another study that showed the importance of female choice. The differences in territory characteristics seemed to be more important. However, there is also a strong correlation between males and their territory characteristics. Models based on the polygyny threshold and sexy son hypotheses predict that females should gain evolutionary advantage in either short-term or long-term in this mating system, yet the study did not support this. The data showed that secondary females had greatly reduced breeding success.

<text>The thick-billed warbler (Arundinax aedon) breeds in the temperate east Palearctic, from south Siberia to west Mongolia. It is migratory, wintering in tropical South Asia and South-east Asia. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.

This passerine bird is a species found in dense vegetation such as reeds, bushes and thick undergrowth. Five or six eggs are laid in a nest in a low tree.

This is a large warbler, at long, which is nearly as big as the great reed warbler. The adult has an unstreaked brown back and buff underparts, with few obvious distinctive plumage features. The forehead is rounded, and the bill is short and pointed. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are richer buff below. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous, but will take other small prey items.

The song is fast and loud, and similar to the marsh warbler, with much mimicry and typically acrocephaline whistles added.

It was sometimes placed in the monotypic genus &quot;Phragmaticola&quot; (or &quot;Phragamaticola&quot;) and for a long time as &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; and in 2009 suggested as being within the &quot;Iduna&quot; clade. However, a 2014 phylogeny study based on more loci indicated that it did not fit into the &quot;Iduna&quot; clade, and therefore suggested a resurrection of the genus &quot;Phragamaticola&quot; or &quot;Arundinax&quot;; the latter, being the older available genus name, has priority.

The genus &quot;Arundinax&quot; is from Latin &quot;arundo, arundinis&quot; meaning &quot;reed&quot; and Ancient Greek &quot;anax&quot; which means &quot;master&quot;. The specific &quot;aedon&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;aedon&quot; and means nightingale. In Greek mythology, Aëdon was changed into a nightingale after killing her own son while attempting to murder one of the sons of her sister Niobe.

<text>The paddyfield warbler (Acrocephalus agricola) is a species of marsh warbler (family Acrocephalidae). It was formerly included in the &quot;Old World warbler&quot; assemblage. The Manchurian reed warbler (&quot;A. tangorum&quot;) was (and sometimes still is) included in &quot;A. agricola&quot; as a subspecies.

The genus name &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;akros&quot;, &quot;highest&quot;, and &quot;kephale&quot;, &quot;head&quot;. It is possible that Naumann and Naumann thought &quot;akros&quot; meant &quot;sharp-pointed&quot;. The specific &quot;agricola&quot; is from Latin and means &quot;farmer&quot;.

It breeds in the temperate central Palearctic. It is migratory, wintering in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. It is a rare vagrant to western Europe although there are small breeding populations along the western shores of the Black Sea around the border between Bulgaria and Romania. This passerine bird is a species found in low vegetation such as long grass, reeds and rice. 4–5 eggs are laid in a nest in grass.

At long with a wingspan of , the paddyfield warbler is close in size to the Eurasian reed warbler but with shorter bill and wingspan. The adult has an unstreaked pale brown back and buff underparts, with a warm brown rump. There is a clearer whitish supercilium and the bill is short and pointed. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are richer buff below. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous.

The song is fast and similar to marsh warbler, with much mimicry and typically acrocephaline whistles added. Its song is weaker and more rhythmic than that of its relative.

<doc id="347689" wikidata="Q6812674" url="?curid=347689" title="Melissa Del Valle">
<text>Melissa Del Valle (born June 2, 1969, in New York) is an American multiple champion in women&#x27;s boxing. She was inducted into the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame in 2023.

A member of a sports-minded family of Puerto Rican decent. Del Valle took up boxing in the early 1990s, while her older brother Lou Del Valle was making a name for himself as a light-welterweight boxer.

Then fighting under her married name of Melissa Salamone, she won the New York state Golden Gloves title at 132 pounds in 1996 and 1997. In the latter year, she added the national amateur lightweight title, sweeping all five scorecards in the finals on July 19, 1997.

She then announced she was joining the professional ranks, debuting on September 5, 1997, with a first-round knockout of Marsha Evans. She followed that up with several more impressive victories, and one year and one week later, she earned her first title shot. On September 12, 1998, Del Valle won a 10-round unanimous decision over Melinda Robinson to claim the vacant WIBF super featherweight title.

She fought and won six non-title bouts over the next 11 months, then defended her title against fellow unbeaten Lena Akesson on August 14, 1999, in Miami Beach, Florida. Despite suffering a cut over one eye and an early knockdown, She rallied late to win a close but unanimous decision.

Personal problems then kept her out of the ring for nearly a year before she challenged Laura Serrano on August 5, 2000, in Connecticut for the IBA version of the super featherweight title. After 10 rounds, the fight was ruled a draw, but most spectators believed Serrano had won. Del Valle, in an act of candor that won her a great deal of respect, also admitted she thought Serrano beat her.

The controversial Serrano fight did not slow down Del Valle, however, and she won seven straight fights to earn yet another title shot, on June 21, 2002, against Ada Vélez for the WIBA super bantamweight title. This was the featured event on an all-women&#x27;s card featuring several of the sport&#x27;s top boxers. Del Valle rose to the occasion, taking Velez&#x27; title by winning seven of the 10 rounds on two cards and nine of 10 on the other.

Over a three-month period in 2003, Del Valle challenged four of the top fighters in women&#x27;s boxing, suffering her first three losses in the process. On July 10, she fell to 27-1-1 by losing a close decision over six rounds to Kelsey Jeffries. On August 9, she faced junior lightweight world champion Isra Girgrah, taking the fight on short notice. Girgrah was given the decision, but most observers thought Del Valle won, and Girgrah promised her a rematch in the future.

Three weeks later, Del Valle moved back down to the super featherweight ranks once again and challenged Chevelle Hallback for her IBA title in Savannah, Georgia. Hallback defeated her over 10 rounds, handing Del Valle her third straight loss. But she got back on the winning track on October 11, when she handed undefeated Kelli Cofer her first loss in a six-round fight in Greensboro, North Carolina. The win over Cofer improved her career record to 28 wins, three losses and one draw, with 11 knockouts.

Del Valle is also noteworthy as the answer to a handful of boxing trivia questions. She and her brother are the only brother and sister to both win world boxing titles; Lou Del Valle was WBA light-heavyweight champion from 1997 to 1998. She was also the first women&#x27;s boxer to fight on the same card as her (then) husband, Craig Salamone. The two appeared together on a card in Atlanta, Georgia, on November 21, 1997.

She is known by the nickname &quot;Honey Girl&quot;, in deference to her brother, who calls himself &quot;Honey Boy&quot; because of a reputation for being able to slip punches from opponents.

<doc id="347706" wikidata="Q878956" url="?curid=347706" title="Ernest Gruening">
<text>Ernest Henry Gruening ( ; February 6, 1887 – June 26, 1974) was an American journalist and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, Gruening was the governor of the Alaska Territory from 1939 until 1953, and a United States Senator from Alaska from 1959 until 1969.

Born in New York City, Gruening pursued a career in journalism after graduating from Harvard Medical School. After working for various newspapers in New York and Boston, he served in various roles during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was appointed as Governor of Alaska in 1939 and became a prominent advocate of Alaska statehood; known as &quot;the Father of Alaska statehood&quot;.

Gruening became one of Alaska&#x27;s inaugural pair of senators, along with Bob Bartlett, after Alaska gained statehood in 1959. Gruening was a prominent opponent of the Vietnam War, and with Oregon&#x27;s Wayne Morse, was one of just two senators to vote against the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution which allowed the bombing of North Vietnam. In 1968, Mike Gravel defeated Gruening in the Democratic Senate primary, and Gruening&#x27;s attempt to win re-election as an independent was unsuccessful.

==Early life==

Gruening was born in New York City to a Jewish family, the son of Phebe (Fridenberg) and Emil Gruening, a German-born eye and ear surgeon, who had fought in the American Civil War, and was present when Confederate General Robert E. Lee signed the surrender which ended the war. Gruening attended The Hotchkiss School, and he graduated from Harvard University in 1907 and from Harvard Medical School in 1912 at the age of 25. He then forsook medicine to pursue journalism, finding it more exciting. Initially a reporter for the &quot;Boston American&quot; in 1912, he went on to become copy desk editor and rewrite man for the &quot;Boston Evening Herald&quot; and, from 1912 to 1913, an editorial writer. He also worked for the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; and the &quot;Boston Journal&quot; at various points. For four years, Gruening was, consecutively, managing editor of the &quot;Boston Evening Traveller&quot; and the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;. After serving in World War I, Gruening became the editor of &quot;The Nation&quot; from 1920 to 1923 and the editor of the &quot;New York Post&quot; for four months in 1934. During his time in New York, he also worked for the Spanish-language publication &quot;La Prensa&quot;.

==Political career==
Intrigued with New Deal politics, he switched careers. Gruening was appointed to the U.S. delegation to the 7th Inter-American Conference in 1933, Director of the Division of Territories and Island Possessions of the Department of the Interior, 1934–1939, and Administrator of the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration, 1935–1937. He was a member of the Alaska International Highway Commission from 1938 to 1942. In 1939, Gruening was appointed Governor of the Territory of Alaska, and served in that position for 13 1/2 years. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions of 1952, 1956, and 1960, and was elected to the United States Senate in 1958, serving for 10 years.

One of Gruening&#x27;s areas of expertise was Mexico. In 1928, he published the most comprehensive book on the country, which is still recommended by the U.S. State Department and Mexican officials today. For this work, the best written by a non-Mexican on Mexico, he received the Order of the Aztec Eagle from the Mexican government.

Despite having been born outside of Alaska, he was a fervent supporter of the territory&#x27;s statehood, serving as one of its first senators after statehood. He gave the keynote speech in 1955 at the Alaskan Constitutional Convention entitled &quot;Let Us End American Colonialism!&quot; in which he outlined the ways in which the United States mirrored the actions of the British Empire in North America before the Revolutionary War in relation to the territory of Alaska. Gruening&#x27;s argument was that Alaska had been a colony of the U.S., but one that, from its purchase, had been promised statehood. With his assistance and support, Alaska entered the Union four years later, in 1959.

== Governorship ==

Ernest Gruening served as the 7th governor of the Alaskan territory from 1939 to 1953. During his term, he continued to write letters to the editor at &quot;The New Republic&quot;. One such letter examined that publication&#x27;s recent discussion of state legislation affecting veterans. Gruening&#x27;s letter included information on the steps taken by his territorial government benefiting veterans in the state. His plan, the Territorial Veterans&#x27; Act, provided for loans up to $10,000 for veterans at a four percent interest rate, half the established rate in Alaska of eight percent.

A significant issue during Gruening&#x27;s tenure as territorial governor, particularly in 1946, was a tuberculosis rate so high it caused him to declare a state of emergency. The territory had as many as 4000 patients and only 289 hospital beds. Alaska spent one-tenth of its annual budget increasing awareness about TB, yet the death rate was still eight times the United States average.

Another concern during Gruening&#x27;s time as governor was the possible effect on wildlife caused by large numbers of soldiers arriving prior to the United States entry into World War II, and which would only increase during the conflict. While he fully supported military presence and activities, after so many soldiers had been in the state long enough to gain resident hunting licenses (significantly cheaper than nonresident licenses) Gruening worried wildlife populations would suffer. Because of this, he began to focus on instituting new regulations to protect Alaska&#x27;s animals and environment from the over-harvesting that he saw as inevitable.

===World War II===

In the spring of 1940, Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler invaded Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. Meanwhile, in September of that year, the Japanese invaded and conquered French Indochina. There had been growing concern in Alaska over the lack of military defense, as it was vulnerable to Axis invasion. Gruening had been pushing for defense facilities in Alaska since his appointment to the governorship, and because of recent actions from Germany and Japan, Congress designated funds to build army forts and airfields in the territory. By 1941, there were 3,000 U.S. Armed Forces soldiers stationed around Alaska. With the attack on Pearl Harbor, Gruening prepared for Alaska to be next. Plans were made for blackouts and civilian defense forces, whose first assignment was &quot;around-the-clock protection for radio stations, telephone exchanges, oil tanks, public utilities, and docks, and to be vigilant against possible sabotage.&quot; The armed forces expanded their operations in Alaska, slowly moving toward the Aleutian Chain, the most accessible route from Asia. The Japanese did reach Alaska in June 1942, bombing Dutch Harbor and landing on the islands of Attu and Kiska, the only continental U.S. locations captured in World War II.

In connection with World War II but preceding U.S. involvement, Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes developed a plan to resettle refugees fleeing the European continent in sparsely-populated Alaska. Many of Alaska&#x27;s infrastructure difficulties were caused by low population, both in overall numbers and density. An influx of immigrants would help solve some of the problems, but Gruening, Alaskans, and 64.7% of Americans, as a &quot;Fortune&quot; survey in 1938 showed, opposed accepting more immigrants and moving them to Alaska. While that suggestion was gaining force in 1938, before Gruening became the territorial governor, it continued throughout World War II.

Gruening was instrumental in passing America&#x27;s first anti-discrimination law, the Alaska Equal Rights Act of 1945.

== U.S. Senate ==
Gruening served Alaska in the United States Senate from January 3, 1959 (the day that Alaska became the 49th state to join the Union) to January 3, 1969 (the tenth anniversary of statehood), defeating Territorial Governor Mike Stepovich for the seat in 1958. He then defeated future U.S. Senator Ted Stevens in 1962, winning re-election to a full term. He was defeated for re-election in 1968 by fellow Democrat Mike Gravel. When Gravel won the Democratic primary, Gruening ran in the general election as an independent, taking third place, behind Gravel and former Anchorage mayor Republican Elmer E. Rasmuson. He continued his active political involvement as president of an investment firm and as a legislative consultant. He died on June 26, 1974.

After the 1964 Alaska earthquake, Gruening was part of the efforts to rebuild Anchorage, along with Representative Ralph Rivers, Governor Bill Egan and Senator Bob Bartlett.

Gruening&#x27;s most notable act as an officeholder was being one of only two senators, along with Wayne Morse of Oregon, to vote against the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution which passed on August 7, 1964. It authorized an expansion of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. He was also responsible for introducing a set of congressional resolutions to establish the nationwide 911 number.

In 2006, Norman Jacques, a former state senator from Rhode Island, called the &quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot; saying he was putting the chair used by Gruening on the U.S. Senate floor up for auction. When Gruening left, he was given the option to buy his seat, and he did. It sat in his dining room, unused as it was so uncomfortable. The friendship that developed between Gruening and Jacques from the time Jacques was protesting against the Vietnam War draft made him present at the sale of some of Gruening&#x27;s property after his death and acquire the chair. At the time of the call, Jacques was moving and felt his Winnebago was &quot;no place for a chair of such stature&quot; and that it should be returned to Alaska.

=== Vietnam War ===
In the May 5, 1969 issue of &quot;The Nation,&quot; Ernest Gruening wrote: &quot;It is, and for some time has been, obvious that the most important issue facing our nation is to get out of the war in Southeast Asia. All our other issues and problems are slighted, impaired and unresolved until we halt the fighting, stop the... continuing drain of blood and treasure, and turn to the long-neglected and pressing needs at home.&quot;

Gruening&#x27;s negative opinion on the Vietnam War is clearly summarized here; he was a vocal opponent of the war throughout U.S. presence in Southeast Asia at the time. In the article, Gruening notes that his 30-page speech, including exhibits, on March 10, 1964, was the first piece of opposition out of Congress regarding the Vietnam War. He was against the bloodshed, against the expense, against the number of refugees resulting from combat, and against how it had changed the worldview on the morality of the United States. He focused on combatting the mindset that since the U.S. was involved in Vietnam, it might as well stay. Gruening suggested that the U.S. entrance into the Southeast Asian theatre was misguided and called for an apology.

In an article about his debate with Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs William P. Bundy regarding Vietnam, Gruening continued the fight against U.S. involvement in the region and its consequences by stating, &quot;After you have been bombing villagers with napalm, it&#x27;s going to be very difficult to persuade people that you are their friend.&quot;

However, Isaac Camacho, who became the first American to escape from a Viet Cong POW camp, said that whilst he was a prisoner, Gruening&#x27;s anti-war rhetoric was used by his VC interrogators as propaganda. Camacho said that he found this &quot;very demoralizing.&quot;

==Family==
While Gruening was not an Alaska resident when he was appointed governor, he lived in Alaska after leaving office. Remaining in Juneau, he spent most of his later years living with his wife, Dorothy, in a cabin at Mile 26 of the Glacier Highway. The cabin is currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Though only one of his three sons reached adulthood, Gruening&#x27;s descendants have managed to establish roots in Alaska after him, mostly in Juneau. In 1980, Gruening&#x27;s grandson, Clark Gruening (who grew up in Juneau but moved to Anchorage following college, serving from there for two terms in the Alaska House of Representatives), defeated incumbent Gravel for the Democratic nomination in the U.S. Senate primary.

Another grandson, Winthrop H. &quot;Win&quot; Gruening, was the longtime head of The Alaska Committee, organized in Juneau in 1995 to lobby for keeping Juneau as Alaska&#x27;s capital. Win Gruening also had a long career in banking in Juneau, originally with B. M. Behrends Bank, which called itself the oldest bank in Alaska prior to being absorbed by KeyBank, and with KeyBank following the acquisition. His daughter, Caroline Gruening, enjoyed success in basketball, playing guard for Juneau-Douglas High School and Santa Clara University.

== Tributes ==

The Ernest Gruening Building, a classroom building on the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus, is named in his honor. The structure is eight stories tall and 72,000 square feet, making it the first on the college campus to be over three stories. In 1977, Alaska donated a statue of Ernest Gruening to the United States Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall Collection. Ernest Gruening Middle School in the Eagle River community of Anchorage, Alaska is named in his honor. Numerous roads and streets in Alaska are named for him as well. As per his wishes, his cremated ashes were scattered on Mount Ernest Gruening near his Alaska home.

<text>John Campbell Greenway (July 6, 1872 – January 19, 1926) was an American businessman and senior officer of the U.S. Army Reserve who served with Colonel Theodore Roosevelt in the Spanish–American War and commanded infantry in World War I. He was the husband of U.S. congresswoman Isabella Greenway.

== Early life and education ==

John Campbell Greenway was born in Huntsville, Alabama, to Dr. Gilbert C. and Alice White Greenway. On both sides, he was a direct descendant of a line of notable Americans dating to before, and during, the American Revolutionary War including William Campbell, Isaac Shelby, Samuel McDowell, Ephraim McDowell, and Addison White. He attended Phillips Academy, Andover, attended Episcopal High School, attended the University of Virginia before completing a PhB in 1895 from the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University. He was a member of the Book and Snake secret society, president of his class, and a member of noted the Yale Football teams from 1892 to 1895 that went a combined 52–1–2 and were national champions four years in a row. Immediately following graduation, he joined the Carnegie Steel Company where he worked briefly before being commissioned in the 1st Volunteer Cavalry of the U.S. Volunteers at the outset of the Spanish–American War.

After being removed from active duty at the end of the Spanish–American War in 1899, Greenway returned to steel and mining and held executive positions in a number of mine, steel, and railroad companies. He supervised development of United States Steel&#x27;s open pit Canisteo Mine and Trout Lake Washing Plant in Coleraine, Minnesota, one of the first large-scale iron ore benefication plants in the world. Following the successful commissioning of the Trout Lake plant, in 1911 Greenway was recruited by the Calumet and Arizona Mining Company (led by former US Steel executives, the combined entity created by J.P. Morgan which included Carnegie Steel) to develop their newly acquired New Cornelia Mine in Ajo, Arizona. He developed the Ajo townsite and developed the New Cornelia into the first large open pit copper mine in Arizona. He also served one year as a regent of the University of Arizona before the United States entered World War I.

== Military career ==

=== Spanish–American War ===

Greenway volunteered for service in 1898 and joined Roosevelt&#x27;s Rough Riders in the Spanish–American War. Originally commissioned a second lieutenant, he was then promoted to brevet then acting captain in the field by Colonel Roosevelt.

Greenway earned a Silver Star for his courageous service at the Battle of San Juan Hill. He is referenced on numerous occasions by Roosevelt in his book &quot;The Rough Riders&quot; and a book of Greenway&#x27;s own correspondence was turned into a book entitled &quot;It Was the Grandest Sight I Ever Saw: Experiences of a Rough Rider As Recorded in the Letters of Lieutenant John Campbell Greenway&quot;. In his book, &quot;The Rough Riders&quot;, Roosevelt said about Lieutenant Greenway:
&quot;&quot;A strapping fellow, entirely fearless, modest and quiet, with the ability to take care of the men under him so as to bring them to the highest point of soldierly perfection, to be counted upon with absolute certainty in every emergency; not only doing his duty, but always on the watch to find some new duty which he could construe to be his, ready to respond with eagerness to the slightest suggestion of doing something, whether it was dangerous or merely difficult and laborious&quot;.&quot;

=== World War I ===
Greenway was returned to active service as a lieutenant colonel at the dawn of America entering World War I. Originally based at Toul Sector, he partook in the Battle of Cantigny, the first large-scale counterattack on German lines by the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) with the 1st Battalion of the 26th Infantry, 1st Division, commanded by Major Theodore Roosevelt Jr., the son of his commander during the Spanish–American War, Theodore Roosevelt. During the war, Greenway would fight in numerous battles including Battle of Saint-Mihiel and the Battle of Château-Thierry. He was especially praised for his heroic conduct in battle and was cited for bravery at Cambrai. France awarded him the Croix de Guerre, the Legion of Honor, and the Ordre de l&#x27;Étoile Noire for commanding the 101st Infantry, 26th Division, during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. He also received a Distinguished Service Cross and the World War I Victory Medal.

In late 1918, Colonel Greenway was severely gassed by German forces and honorably discharged from active service by the Army, though he remained active in the U.S. Army Reserve. He arrived back in Arizona in early 1919 to resume his role in the mining industries there.

=== Aftermath ===
In 1919 Greenway was promoted to the rank of colonel of the infantry, and three years later he was promoted to brigadier general. His post-war military career included work with Theodore Roosevelt Jr. for the Office of Naval Intelligence, the oldest branch of America&#x27;s United States Intelligence Community.

== Personal life ==

He was married to Isabella Munro-Ferguson, who served in the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat from 1933 to 1937 and was the first congresswoman from Arizona. They had one child, Jack. Greenway&#x27;s brother, James C. Sr., married Harriet Lauder Greenway of the Lauder Greenway Family. His nephews include renowned ornithologist and Naval Intelligence Officer James Cowan Greenway and arts patron G. Lauder Greenway, longtime chairman of the Metropolitan Opera Guild, New York.

== Legacy ==
In 1930 Arizona placed Gutzon Borglum&#x27;s statue of Greenway in the U.S. Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall Collection. The statue remained there until being replaced in 2015 by one of Barry Goldwater; the Greenway statue was moved to the Polly Rosenbaum Archives and History Building near the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix. There is another casting of the Borglum statue in Tucson.

A Charles Henry Niehaus statue of Greenway&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, Dr. Ephraim McDowell, was placed in the National Statuary Hall in 1929 by Kentucky, making them the only direct relatives to have shared the honor.

Greenway Road in Phoenix, Arizona, Greenway High School in Phoenix, Greenway Public Schools in Coleraine, Minnesota, and Greenway Township, Itasca County, Minnesota are named in his honor.

<text>The huia ( ; ; Heteralocha acutirostris) is an extinct species of New Zealand wattlebird, endemic to the North Island of New Zealand. The last confirmed sighting of a huia was in 1907, although there was another credible sighting in 1924.

It was already a rare bird before the arrival of Europeans, confined to the Ruahine, Tararua, Rimutaka and Kaimanawa mountain ranges in the south-east of the North Island. It was remarkable for its pronounced sexual dimorphism in bill shape; the female&#x27;s beak was long, thin and arched downward, while the male&#x27;s was short and stout, like that of a crow. Males were long, while females were larger at . The sexes were otherwise similar, with orange wattles and deep metallic, bluish-black plumage with a greenish iridescence on the upper surface, especially about the head. The tail feathers were unique among New Zealand birds in having a broad white band across the tips.

The birds lived in forests at both montane and lowland elevations – they are thought to have moved seasonally, living at higher elevations in summer and descending to lower elevations in winter. Huia were omnivorous and ate adult insects, grubs and spiders, as well as the fruits of a small number of native plants. Males and females used their beaks to feed in different ways: the male used his bill to chisel away at rotting wood, while the female&#x27;s longer, more flexible bill was able to probe deeper areas. Even though the huia is frequently mentioned in biology and ornithology textbooks because of this striking dimorphism, not much is known about its biology; it was little studied before going extinct.

The huia is one of New Zealand&#x27;s best-known extinct birds because of its bill shape and beauty, as well as its special place in Māori culture and oral tradition. The bird was regarded by Māori as (sacred), and the wearing of its skin or feathers was reserved for people of high status.

==Taxonomy and etymology==

The genus name, &quot;Heteralocha&quot;, derives from Ancient Greek &quot;ἕτερος&quot; &quot;different&quot; and &quot;ἄλοχος&quot; &quot;wife&quot;. It refers to the striking difference in bill shape between male and female. The specific name, &quot;acutirostris&quot;, derives from Latin &quot;acutus&quot;, meaning &quot;sharp pointed&quot;, and &quot;rostrum&quot;, meaning &quot;beak&quot;, and refers to the beak of the female.

John Gould described the huia in 1836 as two species: &quot;Neomorpha acutirostris&quot; based on a female specimen, and &quot;N. crassirostris&quot; based on a male specimen—the epithet &quot;crassirostris&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;crassus&quot;, meaning &quot;thick&quot; or &quot;heavy&quot;, and refers to the male&#x27;s short bill. In 1840, George Robert Gray proposed the name &quot;N. gouldii&quot;, arguing that neither of Gould&#x27;s names was applicable to the species. In 1850, Jean Cabanis replaced the name &quot;Neomorpha&quot;, which had been previously used for a cuckoo genus, with &quot;Heteralocha&quot;. In 1888 Sir Walter Buller wrote: &quot;I have deemed it more in accordance with the accepted rules of zoological nomenclature to adopt the first of the two names applied to the species by Mr Gould; and the name &quot;Neomorpha&quot; having been previously used in ornithology, it becomes necessary to adopt that of &quot;Heteralocha&quot;, proposed by Dr Cabanis for this form.&quot;

The huia appears to be a remnant of an early expansion of passerines in the country of New Zealand and is the largest of the three members of the family Callaeidae, the New Zealand wattlebirds; the others are the saddleback and the kōkako. The only close relative to the family is the stitchbird; their taxonomic relationships with other birds remain to be determined. A molecular study of the nuclear RAG-1 and c-mos genes of the three species within the family proved inconclusive, the data providing most support for either a basally diverging kōkako or huia.

==Description==
The huia had black plumage with a green metallic tinge and distinctive rounded bright orange wattles at the gape. In both sexes, the eyes were brown; the beak was ivory white, greyish at the base; the legs and feet were long and bluish grey while the claws were light brown. Huia had twelve long glossy black tail feathers, each tipped for with a broad band of white. Immature huia had small pale wattles, duller plumage flecked with brown, and a reddish-buff tinge to the white tips of the tail feathers. The beak of the young female was only slightly curved. Māori referred to certain huia as &quot;huia-ariki&quot;, &quot;chiefly huia&quot;. The &quot;huia-ariki&quot; had brownish plumage streaked with grey, and the feathers on the neck and head were darker. This variant may have been a partial albino, or perhaps such birds were simply of great age. Several true albino huia were recorded. A white specimen painted by John Gerrard Keulemans around 1900 may have been the result of progressive greying or leucism, rather than albinism; the current whereabouts of this specimen are unknown.

Although sexual dimorphism in bill shape is found in other birds, such as the riflebirds, sicklebills and other wood-excavating birds including some species of woodpecker, it was most pronounced in the huia. The beak of the male was short at approximately and slightly arched downwards and robust, very similar to that of the closely related saddleback, while the female&#x27;s beak was finer, longer at around , and decurved (curved downward) like that of a hummingbird or honeyeater. The difference was not only in the bone; the rhamphotheca grew way past the end of the bony maxilla and mandible to produce a pliable implement able to deeply penetrate holes made by wood-boring beetle larvae. The skulls and mandibles of the huia and saddleback are very similar, the latter essentially miniatures of the former.

There are two possible explanations for the evolution of this sexual difference in bill shape. The most widely supported is that it allowed birds of different sexes to utilise different food sources. This divergence may have arisen because of a lack of competitors in these foraging niches in the North Island forest ecosystems. The other idea is that the ivory-coloured bill, which contrasted sharply with the bird&#x27;s black plumage, may have been used to attract a mate. In animals that use sexually dimorphic physical traits to attract a mate, the dimorphic feature is often brightly coloured or contrasts with the rest of the body, as with the huia. It has been suggested that as the female was the main provider of food for the chicks by regurgitation, this sex evolved the longer bill to obtain the protein-rich invertebrate diet required for the chicks.

Another, less obvious aspect of the huia&#x27;s sexual dimorphism was the minor size difference between the sexes. Males were long, while females were larger at . Additionally, the tail of the male was about in length and the wingspan was between , while the female&#x27;s tail was and the female&#x27;s wingspan was .

==Distribution and habitat==

Subfossil deposits and midden remains reveal that the huia was once widespread in both lowland and montane native forest throughout the North Island, extending from the northernmost tip at Cape Reinga to Wellington and the Aorangi Range in the far south. Only a few huia are known from the extensive pitfall deposits in the karst of the Waitomo Caves area and they are also rare or absent in fossil deposits in the central North Island and Hawke&#x27;s Bay; it seems to have preferred habitats that are not well sampled by the deposits known at present. The huia vanished from the northern and western North Island following Māori settlement in the 14th century, due to over-hunting, forest clearance, and introduced kiore preying on nests. By the time of European settlement in the 1840s it was only found south of a line from the Raukumara Range in the east, across the Kaimanawa Range, to the Turakina River in the Rangitikei in the west. In the south, its range extended to the Wairarapa and the Rimutaka Range east of Wellington. Reports collected by Walter Buller and a single &quot;waiata&quot; (Māori song) suggest that the huia was once also found in the Marlborough and Nelson districts of the South Island; however, it has never been identified in the rich fossil deposits south of Cook Strait, and there is no other evidence of the species&#x27; presence.

The huia inhabited both of the two principal forest types in New Zealand. They were primarily found in broadleaf-podocarp forests where there was a dense understorey, but occasionally also in southern beech (&quot;Nothofagus&quot;) forest. The species was observed in native vegetation including mataī (&quot;Prumnopitys taxifolia&quot;), rimu (&quot;Dacrydium cupressinum&quot;), kahikatea (&quot;Dacrycarpus dacrydioides&quot;), northern rātā (&quot;Metrosideros robusta&quot;), maire (&quot;Nestegis&quot;), hinau (&quot;Elaeocarpus dentatus&quot;), tōtara (&quot;Podocarpus totara&quot;), rewarewa (&quot;Knightia excelsa&quot;), māhoe (&quot;Melicytus ramiflorus&quot;), and taraire (&quot;Beilschmiedia tarairi&quot;), and at sea level in karaka (&quot;Corynocarpus laevigatus&quot;) trees at Cape Turakirae. It was never seen in burnt forest or land cleared for farming.

==Ecology and behaviour==
===Movements===

The huia&#x27;s movements are little known, but it was most likely sedentary. The huia is thought to have undertaken seasonal movements, living in montane forests in the summer and moving down into lowland forests in the winter to avoid the harsher weather and cold temperatures of higher altitudes. Like the surviving New Zealand wattlebirds, the saddleback and the kōkako, the huia was a weak flier and could only fly for short distances, and seldom above tree height. More often it would use its powerful legs to propel it in long leaps and bounds through the canopy or across the forest floor, or it would cling vertically to tree trunks with its tail spread for balance.

===Feeding and ecology===
The huia, with the previously endangered saddleback, were the two species of classic bark and wood probers in the arboreal insectivore guild in the New Zealand avifauna. Woodpeckers do not occur east of Wallace&#x27;s line; their ecological niche is filled by other groups of birds that feed on wood-boring beetle larvae, albeit in rotting wood. The woodpecker-like role was taken on by two species in two different families in the New Zealand mixed-podocarp and &quot;Nothofagus&quot; forests; one was the huia and the other was the Kākā.

The huia foraged mainly on decaying wood. Although it was considered a specialist predator of the larvae of the nocturnal huhu beetle (&quot;Prionoplus reticularis&quot;), it also ate other insects—including wētā—insect larvae, spiders, and fruit.

Insects and spiders were taken from decaying wood, from under bark, mosses and lichens, and from the ground. Huia foraged either alone, in pairs, or in small flocks of up to five, which were probably family groups. The sexual dimorphism of the bill structure gave rise to feeding strategies that differed radically between the sexes. The male used its adze-like bill to chisel and rip into the outer layers of decaying wood, while the female probed areas inaccessible to the male, such as the burrows of insect larvae in living wood. The male had well-developed cranial musculature allowing rotten wood to be chiselled and pried apart by &quot;gaping&quot; motions. There are corresponding differences in the structure and musculature of the head and neck between males and females. Huia had very well developed depressor jaw muscles, and an occipital crest that provided extra surface for muscle attachment, allowing the jaw to be opened with considerable force. Once the bird had secured a meal, it flew to a perch with the insect in its feet. The huia stripped its meal of any hard parts, then tossed the remainder up, caught, and swallowed it.
Pairs did not cooperate in feeding, at least not in a strict sense. All such reports are based on a misunderstanding of an account by ornithologist Walter Buller of a pair kept in captivity obtaining wood-boring beetle larvae. According to this misunderstanding, which has become part of ecological folklore, the male would tear at the wood and open larval tunnels, thus allowing the female to probe deeply into the tunnels with her long, pliant bill. Rather, the divergent bills represent an extreme example of niche differentiation, reducing intraspecific competition between the sexes. This allowed the species to exploit a wide range of food sources in different microhabitats.

The New Zealand forest relies heavily on frugivorous birds for seed dispersal: about 70% of the woody plants have fruits that are probably dispersed by birds, which included the huia. The range of fruits eaten by the huia is difficult to establish: hinau (&quot;Elaeocarpus dentatus&quot;), pigeonwood (&quot;Hedycarya arborea&quot;) and various species of &quot;Coprosma&quot; are recorded by Buller, and they were also recorded as eating the fruits of kahikatea (&quot;Dacrycarpus dacrydioides&quot;). The extinction of the huia and other frugivorous New Zealand bird species including the moa and piopio, and the diminishing range of many others, including the kiwi, weka, and kōkako, has left few effective seed dispersers in the New Zealand forest. For plants with fruit greater than 1 cm in diameter, kererū are the sole remaining dispersers in the ecosystem, and they are rare or extinct in some areas. This depletion of avifauna in the forest ecosystem may be having major impacts on processes such as forest regeneration and seed dispersal.

===Voice===
Like so many other aspects of its biology, the vocalisations of the huia are not well known, and present knowledge is based on very few accounts. The calls were mostly a varied array of whistles, &quot;peculiar and strange&quot;, but also &quot;soft, melodious and flute-like&quot;. An imitation of the bird&#x27;s call survives as a recording of 1909 huia search team member Henare Hamana whistling the call (see &quot;External links&quot;). Huia were often silent. When they did vocalise, their calls could carry considerable distances – some were audible from up to away through dense forest. The calls were said to differ between sexes, though there are no details. Calls were given with the bird&#x27;s head and neck stretched outward and its bill pointing 30 to 45 degrees from the vertical. Most references describe huia calls as heard in the early morning; one records it as the first bird to sing in the dawn chorus, and captive birds were known to &quot;wake the household&quot;. Like the whitehead, huia behaved unusually before the onset of wet weather, being &quot;happy and in full song&quot;. The bird&#x27;s name is onomatopoeic: it was named by Māori for its loud distress call, a smooth, unslurred whistle rendered as &quot;uia, uia, uia&quot; or &quot;where are you?&quot;. This call was said to be given when the bird was excited or hungry. Chicks had a &quot;plaintive cry, pleasant to the ear&quot;, would feebly answer imitations by people, and were very noisy when kept in tents.

===Commensals and parasites===
A species of parasitic phtilopterid louse, &quot;Rallicola extinctus&quot;, was only known to live on the huia, and apparently became extinct with its host. In 2008, a new species of feather mite, &quot;Coraciacarus muellermotzfeldi&quot;, was described from dried corpses found in the feathers of a huia skin held by a European museum. While the genus &quot;Coraciacarus&quot; has a wide range of hosts globally, the presence of a representative of the genus on a passerine bird was an &quot;enigmatic phenomenon&quot;. The discoverers suggested the mite could have been horizontally transferred from one of the two native, migratory species of cuckoo (Cuculiformes).

===Social behaviour and reproduction===

A quiet, social bird, the huia was monogamous, and pairs probably paired for life. The bird was usually found in breeding pairs, although sometimes groups of four or more were encountered. Walter Buller records that a tame pair would always keep close to each other, constantly uttering a &quot;low affectionate twitter&quot;, even when in captivity. There are records of this same pair and a further, wild pair &quot;hopping from branch to branch and fanning their tails, then meeting to caress each other with their bills&quot; and uttering these noises. The male is said to have fed the female in courtship. It is thought that these behaviours may have been a sexual display. The claim that the male fed the female while she was incubating and on the nest &quot;lacks evidence&quot;. When the male of this captive pair was accidentally killed, the female &quot;manifesting the utmost distress pined for her mate and died 10 days afterwards&quot;. A Māori man in the 19th century recalled: &quot;I was always told by my old people that a pair of huia lived on most affectionate terms ... If the male died first, the female died soon after of grief&quot;. The huia had no fear of people; females allowed themselves to be handled on the nest, and birds could easily be captured by hand.

Little is known about the huia&#x27;s reproduction, as only two eggs and four nests were ever described. The only known huia egg to still exist is in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. The breeding season for mating, building nests, laying eggs and raising young is thought to have been late spring (October–November). It is thought they nested solitarily; pairs are said to have been territorial and the birds would remain on their territories for life. Huia appear to have raised just one brood per season; the number of eggs in a clutch is variously described as being 3–5, 4, 2–4 and 1–4. These eggs were greyish with purple and brown speckles, and measured . Incubation was mostly by the female, though there is evidence that the male also had a small role, as rubbed-bare brooding patches that were smaller than those of females were discovered on some males in November. The incubation period is unknown. Eggshells were apparently removed from the nest by adults. The brood size was usually one or two, though there were occasional records of up to three chicks in a single nest. Nests were constructed in varying places: in dead trees, the crooks of large branches, tree hollows, on branches, or &quot;on or near the ground&quot;, and some nests were covered with hanging vegetation or vines. The nest itself was a large saucer-shaped structure, up to 350 mm in diameter and 70 mm deep, with thick walls of dry grass, leaves and &quot;withered stems of herbaceous plants&quot;. A central small, shallow cup of soft materials such as grass and fine twigs cushioned and insulated the eggs. After hatching, young remained in the family group and were fed by the adults for three months, by which time they appeared adult.

==Relationship with humans==

===In culture===

In Māori culture, the &quot;white heron and the Huia were not normally eaten but were rare birds treasured for their precious plumes, worn by people of high rank&quot;. The bold and inquisitive nature of the huia made it particularly easy to capture. Māori attracted the huia by imitating its call and then captured it with a &quot;tari&quot; (a carved pole with a noose at the end) or snare, or killed it with clubs or long spears. Often they exploited the strong pair bond by capturing one of a pair, which would then call out, attracting its mate, which could be easily captured. Opinion on the quality of huia meat as food varied wildly; although not usually hunted for this purpose, the huia was considered &quot;good eating&quot; in pies or curried stew by some, but a &quot;tough morsel&quot; and &quot;unfit to eat&quot; by others.

Although the huia&#x27;s range was restricted to the southern North Island, its tail feathers were valued highly and were exchanged among tribes for other valuable goods such as pounamu and shark teeth, or given as tokens of friendship and respect. Through this trade, the feathers reached the far north and the far south of New Zealand. They were stored in intricately carved boxes called &quot;waka huia&quot;, which were hung from the ceilings of chiefs&#x27; houses. Huia feathers were worn at funerals and used to decorate the heads of the deceased. The &quot;marereko&quot;, described by Edward Robert Tregear as an &quot;ancient war-plume&quot;, consisted of twelve huia feathers. The highly valued &quot;pōhoi&quot; was an ornament made from the skin of the huia: the bird was skinned with the beak, skull and wattles attached and the legs and wings removed, carefully dried, and the resulting ornament worn from the neck or ears. Dried huia heads were also worn as pendants called &quot;ngutu huia&quot;. A captured huia would be kept in a small cage so that its tail feathers could be plucked as they grew to full size.

The bird was also kept by Māori as a pet, and like the tūī, it could be trained to say a few words. There is also a record of a tame huia kept by European settlers in a small village in the Forty-Mile Bush in the 19th century.

New Zealand has released several postage stamps portraying the huia. The New Zealand sixpence coin, minted between 1933 and 1966, featured a female huia on the reverse.

The degree to which the huia was known and admired in New Zealand is reflected in the large number of suburban and geographical features which are named after the species. There are several roads and streets named after the huia in the North Island, with several in Wellington (including Huia Road in Days Bay – not far from where one of the last sightings of this species occurred in the early 1920s in the forests of East Harbour Regional Park) and also in Auckland, where there is even a Huia township in West Auckland (although the township is named after a Waikato Tainui chief of the same name). A river on the west coast of the South Island and the Huiarau Ranges in the central North Island are also named after the bird. The species was once found living in great abundance in the forests of these mountains: &quot;Huiarau&quot; means &quot;a hundred huia&quot;. Businesses include the public swimming pool in Lower Hutt, a Marlborough winery, and Huia Publishers, which specialises in Māori writing and perspectives. The name was first given to a child in the late 19th century, to the son of members of a lower North Island &quot;iwi&quot; concerned about the bird&#x27;s rapid decline, and although uncommon, it is still used today in New Zealand as a name for girls and more rarely for boys (e.g. Huia Edmonds), of both European and Māori descent. Huia also featured extensively in contemporary art and handcrafts, commonly seen in gift shops the around the country. In 2020 Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern wore upcycled Huia feather earrings during a public COVID-19 announcement causing demand to soar.

Tail feathers of the extinct huia are very rare and they have become a collectors&#x27; item. In May 2024 a single huia feather sold at auction in Auckland for NZ$46,521.50, making it the most expensive feather ever sold in the world. The previous record was another huia feather sold in 2010.

In the 2016 New Zealand film &quot;Hunt for the Wilderpeople&quot; two of the characters encounter a huia, and eventually set out to obtain proof of their sighting. Reviewers asserted that in the film the huia is significant as a &quot;uniquely indigenous&quot; symbol that &quot;represents harmony with nature and the wild.&quot;

===Extinction===

The huia was found throughout the North Island before humans arrived in New Zealand. Māori are estimated to have arrived around 750 years ago, and by the arrival of European settlers in the 1840s, habitat destruction, hunting, and introduced rats had reduced the bird&#x27;s range to the southern North Island. However, Māori hunting pressures on the huia were limited to some extent by traditional protocols. The hunting season was from May to July when the bird&#x27;s plumage was in prime condition, while a &quot;rāhui&quot; (hunting ban) was enforced in spring and summer. After European settlement the huia&#x27;s numbers began to decline more quickly, due mainly to two well-documented factors: widespread deforestation and over-hunting.

Like the extinctions of other New Zealand birds such as the piopio in the 19th century, the decline of the huia was poorly studied. Massive deforestation occurred in the North Island at this time, particularly in the lowlands of southern Hawkes Bay, the Manawatū and the Wairarapa, as land was cleared by European settlers for agriculture. The huia was particularly vulnerable to this as it could only live in old-growth forest where there were abundant rotting trees filled with wood-boring insect larvae. It seems it could not survive in regenerating, secondary forests. Although the mountainous part of its former range was not deforested, the lowland forests of the valleys below were systematically destroyed. The destruction of this part of its habitat would have undoubtedly had a severe impact on huia populations, but its removal would have been particularly dire if they did in fact descend to the lowlands as a winter refuge to escape snow at higher altitudes as some researchers including Oliver have surmised.

It appears that predation by invasive mammalian species including ship rats, cats, and mustelids was an additional factor in the decline in huia numbers – the introduction of these animals by New Zealand acclimatisation societies peaked in the 1880s and coincided with a particularly sharp decline in huia populations. Because it spent a lot of time on the ground, the huia would have been particularly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Another hypothetical cause of extinction is exotic parasites and disease introduced from Asia with the common myna.

Habitat destruction and the predations of introduced species were problems faced by all New Zealand birds, but in addition the huia faced massive pressure from hunting. Due to its pronounced sexual dimorphism and its beauty, huia were sought after as mounted specimens by wealthy collectors in Europe and by museums all over the world. These individuals and institutions were willing to pay large sums of money for good specimens, and the overseas demand created a strong financial incentive for hunters in New Zealand. This hunting was initially by naturalists. Austrian taxidermist Andreas Reischek took 212 pairs as specimens for the Natural History museum in Vienna over a period of 10 years, while New Zealand ornithologist Walter Buller collected 18 on just one of several expeditions to the Rimutaka Ranges in 1883. Others keen to profit soon joined in. Buller records that also in 1883, a party of 11 Māori obtained 646 huia skins from the forest between the Manawatū Gorge and Ākitio. Several thousand huia were exported overseas as part of this trade. Infrastructure development within lowland forest did not help the situation: hundreds of huia were shot around road and rail construction camps. 

The rampant and unsustainable hunting was not just financially motivated: it also had a more philosophical, fatalistic aspect. The conventional wisdom among New Zealand Europeans in the 19th century was that things colonial, whether they were plants, animals or people, were inferior to things European. It was widely assumed that the plants and animals of New Zealand&#x27;s forest ecosystems would be quickly replaced by more vigorous and competitive European species. This assumption of inevitable doom led to a conclusion that the conservation of native biota was pointless and futile; Victorian collectors instead focused their efforts on acquiring a good range of specimens before the rare species disappeared altogether.

There were some attempts to conserve the huia, but they were few, poorly organised and poorly enforced legally: the conservation movement in New Zealand was still very much in its infancy. There were successive sharp declines in numbers of huia in the 1860s and in the late 1880s, prompting the chiefs of the Manawatū and the Wairarapa to place a rāhui on the Tararua Range. In February 1892, the Wild Birds Protection Act was amended to include the huia, making it illegal to kill the bird, but enforcement was not taken seriously. Island sanctuaries were set up for endangered native birds after this act, but the new bird sanctuaries, including Kapiti Island, Little Barrier Island and Resolution Island, were never stocked with huia. Although attempts were made to capture birds for transfer, no huia were ever transferred. The Kapiti Island attempt is documented as being particularly poorly managed. A live pair destined to be transferred to the island in 1893 was instead appropriated by Buller, who bent the law to take them back to England as a present for Lord Rothschild, along with the last collected live pair of laughing owls.

The Duke and Duchess of York (later George V and Queen Mary) visited New Zealand in 1901. At an official Māori welcome in Rotorua, a guide took a huia tail feather from her hair and placed it in the band of the Duke&#x27;s hat as a token of respect. Many people in England and New Zealand wanted to emulate this royal fashion and wear huia feathers in their hats. The price of tail feathers was soon pushed to £1, making each bird worth £12, and some feathers sold for as much as £5. Female huia beaks were also set in gold as jewellery. Shooting season notices ceased listing the huia as a protected species in 1901, and a last-ditch attempt to reinforce government protection failed when the solicitor general ruled that there was no law to protect feathers.

The decline of the huia over the southern half of the North Island occurred at markedly different rates in different locations. Areas where dramatic declines were observed in the 1880s included the Puketoi Range, the Hutt Valley and Tararuas, and the Pahiatua-Dannevirke area. The species was abundant in a few places in the early 20th century between Hawke&#x27;s Bay and the Wairarapa; a flock of 100–150 birds was reported at the summit of the Akatarawa–Waikanae track in 1905; they were still &quot;fairly plentiful&quot; in the upper reaches of the Rangitikei River in 1906 – and yet, the last confirmed sighting came just one year later.

The last official, confirmed huia sighting was made on 28 December 1907 when W. W. Smith saw three birds in the forests of the Tararua Ranges. Unconfirmed, &quot;quite credible&quot; reports suggest that extinction for the species came a little later. A man familiar with the species reported seeing three huia in Gollans Valley behind York Bay (between Petone and Eastbourne on Wellington Harbour), an area of mixed beech and podocarp forest well within the bird&#x27;s former range, on 28 December 1922. Sightings of the huia were also reported there in 1912 and 1913. Despite this, naturalists from the Dominion Museum in Wellington did not investigate the reports. The last credible reports of huia come from the forests of Te Urewera National Park, with one from near Mt Urutawa in 1952 and final sightings near Lake Waikareiti in 1961 and 1963. The possibility of a small huia population still surviving in the Urewera ranges has been proposed by some researchers, but is considered highly unlikely. No recent expeditions have been mounted to find a living specimen.

Students at Hastings Boys&#x27; High School organised a conference in 1999 to consider cloning the huia, their school emblem. The tribe Ngāti Huia agreed in principle to support the endeavour, which would be carried out at the University of Otago, and a California-based Internet start-up volunteered $100,000 of funding. However, Sandy Bartle, curator of birds at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, said that the complete huia genome could not be derived from museum skins because of the poor state of the DNA, and cloning was therefore unlikely to succeed.

<doc id="347715" wikidata="Q1800396" url="?curid=347715" title="Nino Benvenuti">
<text>Giovanni &quot;Nino&quot; Benvenuti (born 26 April 1938) is an Italian former professional boxer and actor. He held world titles in two weight classes, having held the undisputed super-welterweight championship from June 1965 to June 1966 and the undisputed middleweight championship twice, from April to September 1967, and from March 1968 to November 1970. As an amateur welterweight boxer he won the Italian title in 1956–60, the European title in 1957 and 1959, and an Olympic gold medal in 1960, receiving the Val Barker trophy for boxing style. In 1961, having an amateur record of 120-0, he turned professional and won world titles in the light-middleweight division and twice in the middleweight division. Near the end of his boxing career he appeared in two Italian films, &quot;Sundance and the Kid&quot; (1969) and then in &quot;Mark Shoots First&quot; (1975).

Inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1992. He currently ranks No.32 in BoxRec&#x27;s ranking of the greatest pound for pound boxers of all time. In 1968, Benvenuti was voted Fighter of the Year by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine. In 2011, &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine ranked him as seventh on their list of the &quot;10 best middleweight title holders of the last 50 years.&quot;

==Professional boxing career==
On 20 January 1961, Benvenuti made his professional boxing debut, beating Ben Ali Allala by decision in six rounds. He then won 29 fights in a row before challenging for the Italian middleweight title, on 1 March 1963, in Rome against Tommaso Truppi. His winning streak extended to 30 when he knocked out Truppi in round eleven. His winning streak reached 46 wins in a row when he met former world junior middleweight champion Denny Moyer on 18 September 1964, beating Moyer on points in ten rounds.

After reaching 55 wins in a row, including a five-round knockout of Truppi in a rematch, he met world jr. middleweight champion Sandro Mazzinghi in Milan, on 18 June 1965. This was a fight the Italian public clamoured for: both men were Italian, both men claimed to be the best in their division, and they had expressed the desire to fight each other. Benvenuti became the world junior middleweight champion with a sixth-round knockout win. It was common, at that era, for world champions to fight for regional belts after winning the world title, so on 15 October 1965, he added the European belt at the middleweight division, with a sixth-round knockout of Luis Folledo.

A rematch with Mazzinghi took place on 17 December 1965, and Benvenuti retained the world junior middleweight crown after winning a fifteen-round decision. After three non-title wins, including a twelve-round decision over Don Fullmer and a fourteen-round knockout in Germany of Jupp Elze (Benvenuti&#x27;s first professional fight abroad), he travelled to South Korea, where he lost his world junior middleweight title against Ki-Soo Kim, who won by decision in fifteen rounds on 25 June 1966, breaking Benvenuti&#x27;s record of 65 consecutive wins. Frustrated by what he perceived as an unjust decision to favour the local boxer, Benvenuti decided to drop the junior middleweight and concentrate on the middleweight division instead.

Benvenuti beat Emile Griffith by decision in fifteen rounds at New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden on 17 April 1967, in what was the beginning of their trilogy of fights, to win the world middleweight title. On a rematch at Shea Stadium on 29 September 1967, he lost by a decision in fifteen rounds.

On 4 March 1968, Benvenuti and Griffith completed their trilogy, once again at Madison Square Garden, with Benvenuti knocking Griffith down in round nine and winning a fifteen-round decision to regain the world middleweight title. On 14 December 1968, in San Remo, he and Fullmer met once again, and Benvenuti retained the world middleweight title with a fifteen-round decision. On 26 May 1969, Benvenuti lost a ten-round decision to former world light heavyweight champion Dick Tiger in a light heavyweight, non-title match. Benvenuti broke his right hand while landing a head punch in the first round, but chose to continue fighting &quot;like a cripple&quot; rather than quit.

The most curious defence of Benvenuti&#x27;s active reign, took place on 4 October 1969, when he retained the world middleweight title with a seven-round disqualification win over American Fraser Scott at the Stadio S. Paolo in Naples. From the first round, Scott was warned repeatedly, and with increasing intensity from the referee, about attempted butting. Scott, a young fighter unschooled in the European insistence on what his trainer referred to as &quot;that...Olympic stand-up style&quot;, knowing only the battle plan he went in with and speaking no Italian, did not understand the warnings at first, then was unable to alter his approach; to the American, he was merely &quot;ducking&quot; Benvenuti&#x27;s shots. The bout was foul-filled even without this added controversy; Scott would later accuse Benvenuti of having tried to thumb him, and during the sixth round, the fighters&#x27; legs became entangled as they wrestled, causing both to crash to the canvas. Round seven saw the stoppage, the referee asserting &quot;attempted butting&quot;, Fraser Scott and corner forever insisting he had &quot;ducked&quot;.

On 22 November 1969, he beat former world welterweight champion Luis Rodriguez by knockout in 11 rounds to, once again, retain his world middleweight title.

On 13 March 1970, in a non-title bout, Benvenuti was knocked out in the eighth round by unknown American Tom Bethea in Australia. The upset defeat caused Bethea to earn a world title shot at Benvenuti&#x27;s title. Benvenuti avenged the defeat when the two met again in Umag with an eighth-round knockout.

On 7 November 1970 Benvenuti lost his title in Rome after being knocked out in round twelve by rising star Carlos Monzón.

In 1971, after losing a ten-round decision to José Chirino, a fighter he had picked due to his fighting style&#x27;s similarities with Monzón, Benvenuti got a rematch with Monzón for the world middleweight title in Monte Carlo on 8 May 1971. Monzón won again in round three when Benvenuti‘s corner threw in the towel. Realizing that he no longer had the stamina to compete with champions of a new generation like Monzón, Benvenuti announced his retirement.

Benvenuti had a record of 82 wins, 7 losses and 1 draw (tie) in 90 professional boxing bouts, with 35 wins by knockout. In 1992 he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Post-boxing==
After retiring from boxing Benvenuti became a successful businessman, TV pundit and city counsellor for sport in Trieste. He opened a high-class restaurant and maintained a strong friendship with his former rivals Monzón and Griffith. In 1980 Benvenuti asked Griffith to be the godfather of one of his sons, and later helped him financially when Griffith was in trouble. Monzón was a guest at Benvenuti&#x27;s television show several times, and, when he was accused of murdering his wife in 1988, Benvenuti became one of his most loyal supporters, visiting him in jail in Argentina. Benvenuti was a pallbearer at Monzón’s funeral in 1995.

==Retirement and personal life==
Nino Benvenuti was born in Isola d&#x27;Istria, at that time in Italy (now in Slovenia). After the war, his family fled to Italy due to the consequences of the war treaty and the hostilities created by the Yugoslav government.

In 1961 Benvenuti married Giuliana Fonzari; they had four sons and adopted a Tunisian girl. They later divorced, and Benvenuti married Nadia Bertorello, with whom he had one daughter.

==Professional boxing record==

==Awards==
On 7 May 2015, in the presence of the President of Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI), Giovanni Malagò, was inaugurated in the Olympic Park of the Foro Italico in Rome, along &quot;Viale delle Olimpiadi&quot;, the Walk of Fame of Italian sport, consisting of 100 tiles that chronologically report names of the most representative athletes in the history of Italian sport. On each tile is the name of the sportsman, the sport in which he distinguished himself and the symbol of CONI. One of the tiles is dedicated to Nino Benvenuti.

<doc id="347717" wikidata="Q7888074" url="?curid=347717" title="United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1979">
<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1979 with the song &quot;Mary Ann&quot;, written by Peter Morris, and performed by the band Black Lace. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final.

==Before Eurovision==
===&quot;A Song for Europe 1979&quot;===
&quot;A Song for Europe 1979&quot; was planned to take place at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 8 March 1979.

After a day&#x27;s rehearsals a strike by the BBC technicians stopped the show about an hour before transmission. Audio recordings of the songs were voted on by 14 regional juries: Bristol, Bangor, Leeds, Norwich, Newcastle, Aberdeen, Birmingham, Belfast, Cardiff, Plymouth, Glasgow, Southampton, and London. The jury in Manchester could not be contacted and since the winner had a more than 12 point winning margin, their scores were not included. This led to an immaterial tie for second place. The Manchester votes were later verified and added to the scores, demoting the song &quot;Call My Name&quot; down to third place. The following day, the 12 songs were broadcast on Terry Wogan&#x27;s Radio 2 show and a recap of the top places, plus an interview with the winners took place on the BBC TV Show Nationwide the same evening.

==At Eurovision==
Black Lace were the winners of &quot;A Song for Europe 1979&quot; with &quot;Mary Ann&quot; and went on to place 7th at the 1979 Eurovision Song Contest in Jerusalem.

This was also the only Eurovision between and in which Terry Wogan did not provide either the television or radio commentary. Wogan had originally been scheduled to provide the television commentary but opted out of going to Israel following comments he made of the winner &quot;A-Ba-Ni-Bi&quot; sounding like &quot;I Wanna Be a Polar Bear&quot;. Instead his Radio 2 colleague John Dunn provided the television commentary. Ray Moore provided the radio commentary on both BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2.

<doc id="347721" wikidata="Q704886" url="?curid=347721" title="South West Africa campaign">
<text>The South West Africa campaign was the conquest and occupation of German South West Africa by forces from the Union of South Africa acting on behalf of the British imperial government at the beginning of the First World War. The South African Prime Minister Louis Botha took the unusual move of leading his troops into battle as commander-in-chief, to the frustration of his cabinet.

==Background==

The outbreak of hostilities in Europe in August 1914 had been anticipated and government officials of South Africa were aware of the significance of their common border with the German colony. Prime Minister Louis Botha informed London that South Africa could defend itself and that the Imperial Garrison might depart for France; when the British government asked Botha whether his forces would invade German South West Africa, the reply was yes. South African troops were mobilised along the border between the two countries under the command of General Henry Lukin and Lieutenant-Colonel Manie Maritz early in September 1914. Shortly afterwards another force occupied the port of Lüderitz. The news about the start of the First World War reached German South West Africa on 2 August 1914 via radio-telegraphy. The information was transmitted from the Nauen station via a relay station in Kamina and Lomé in Togo to the radio station in Windhoek.

==Boer revolt==

There was considerable sympathy among the Boer population of South Africa for the German cause. Only twelve years had passed since the end of the Second Boer War, in which Germany had offered the two Boer republics unofficial support in their war with the British Empire. Lieutenant-Colonel Manie Maritz, heading commando forces on the border of German South West Africa, declared that

Maritz and several other high-ranking officers rapidly gathered forces with a total of about 12,000 rebels in the Transvaal and Orange Free State, ready to fight for the cause in what became known as the Boer revolt (also sometimes referred to as the Maritz rebellion). The government declared martial law on 14 October 1914 and forces loyal to the government under the command of generals Louis Botha and Jan Smuts proceeded to destroy the rebellion. Maritz was defeated on 24 October and took refuge with the Germans; the rebellion was suppressed by early February 1915. The leading Boer rebels received terms of imprisonment of six and seven years and heavy fines; two years later they were released from prison, as Botha recognised the value of reconciliation.

==German and South African hostilities==

A first attempt to invade German South West Africa from the south failed at the Battle of Sandfontein, close to the border with the Cape Colony, where on 26 September 1914 German colonial forces defeated the Union Defence Force (UDF), although the surviving UDF troops were left free to return to South Africa. To disrupt South African plans to invade German South West Africa again, the Germans invaded South Africa and the Battle of Kakamas took place over the fords at Kakamas, on 4 February 1915 for control of two fords over the Orange River. The South Africans prevented the Germans from gaining control of the fords and crossing the river.
By February 1915, with the home front secure, the South Africans were ready to invade again. Botha, as a senior and experienced military commander, took command of the invasion, with Smuts commanding the southern forces while he led the northern forces. Botha arrived at the German colonial town of Swakopmund on the coast, on 11 February to take direct command on the northern contingent and continued to build up his invasion force at Walfish Bay (Walvis Bay) a South African enclave about halfway along the coast of German South West Africa. In March he advanced from Swakopmund along the Swakop valley with its railway line and captured Otjimbingwe, Karibib, Friedrichsfelde, Wilhelmsthal and Okahandja, reaching the capital Windhuk on 5 May 1915.

The Germans offered terms under which they would surrender but Botha refused them. On 12 May Botha declared martial law and having cut the colony in half, divided his forces into four contingents under Coen Brits, Lukin, Manie Botha and Myburgh. Brits went north to Otjiwarongo, Outjo and Etosha Pan which cut off German forces in the interior from the coastal regions of Kunene and Kaokoveld. The other three columns fanned out into the north-east. Lukin went along the railway line running from Swakopmund to Tsumeb. The other two columns advanced on Lukin&#x27;s right flank, Myburgh to Otavi junction and Manie Botha to Tsumeb and the line&#x27;s terminus. The men who commanded these columns, having fought in Boer commandos, moved rapidly. The German forces in the north-west made a stand at the Battle of Otavi on 1 July but were beaten and surrendered at Khorab on 9 July 1915.
Smuts landed with another South African force at the naval base at Lüderitzbucht (Lüderitz Bay). Having secured the town Smuts advanced inland, capturing Keetmanshoop on 20 May. Here he met two columns that had advanced over the border from South Africa, one from the coastal town of Port Nolloth and the other from Kimberley. Smuts advanced north along the railway line to Berseba and after two days fighting captured Gibeon on 26 May. The Germans in the south were forced to retreat northwards towards their capital and Botha&#x27;s forces. Within two weeks the German forces in the south were faced with certain destruction and Governor Sietz surrendered at Korab, north of Windhoek, on 9 July 1915. When the Germans provided lists of the names of approximately 2,200 troops under their command, Botha told the German delegation that he had been tricked, as he knew that the Germans had 15,000 men. Victor Franke, the German commander, replied, &quot;If we had 15,000 men then you wouldn&#x27;t be here and we wouldn&#x27;t be in this position&quot;.

==German and Portuguese hostilites==

Before an official declaration of war between Germany and Portugal (March 1916), in the German campaign in Angola German and Portuguese troops fought several times on the border between German South West Africa and Portuguese Angola. The Germans won most of these clashes and were able to occupy the Humbe region in southern Angola until Portuguese control was restored a few days before the successful South African campaign defeated the Germans. The German offensive into Angola spurred the native Ovambo to revolt against Portuguese rule. The ensuing Ovambo Uprising was not fully suppressed by Portuguese and British forces until after the end of World War One.

==Aftermath==

===Casualties===
South African casualties were died of injury or illness and German casualties were field guns and 22 machine-guns captured.

===Post-war===

After defeating the German force in South West Africa, South Africa occupied the colony and then administered it as a League of Nations mandate territory from 1919. Although the South African government desired to incorporate South West Africa into its territory, it never officially did so, although it was administered as the de facto fifth province, with the white minority having representation in the whites-only Parliament of South Africa, as well as electing their own local administration the SWA Legislative Assembly. The South African government also appointed the SWA administrator, who had extensive powers. When the League was superseded by the United Nations in 1946, South Africa refused to surrender the mandate as a trust territory, and the United Nations General Assembly revoked it. In 1971 the International Court of Justice issued an &quot;advisory opinion&quot; declaring South Africa&#x27;s administration to be illegal.

<text>Kingston Lacy is a country house and estate near Wimborne Minster, Dorset, England. It was for many years the family seat of the Bankes family who lived nearby at Corfe Castle until its destruction in the English Civil War after its incumbent owners, Sir John Bankes and Dame Mary, had remained loyal to Charles I.

The house was built between 1663 and 1665 by Ralph Bankes, son of Sir John Bankes, to a design by the architect Sir Roger Pratt. It is a rectangular building with two main storeys, attics and basement, modelled on Chevening in Kent. The gardens and parkland were laid down at the same time, including some of the specimen trees that remain today. Various additions and alterations were made to the house over the years and the estate remained in the ownership of the Bankes family from the 17th to the late 20th century.

The house was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1958 and the park and gardens are included in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens at Grade II. The house was bequeathed to the National Trust in 1982 after the death of Henry John Ralph Bankes, along with Corfe Castle. The house and gardens are open to the public.

==History==
The Kingston Lacy estate originally formed part of a royal estate within the manor of Wimborne. The original house stood to the north of the current house. It was built in the medieval period and was used as a hunting lodge in connection with the deer park to its northwest. Leased to those who found favour with the monarch, lessees included the de Lacys, Earls of Lincoln, who held it in addition to estates at Shapwick and Blandford Forum. In the 15th century the property was leased to John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset, whose daughter Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII, was brought up at Kingston Lacy.
By the 18th century the house was in ruins. In 1603 James I gave the lands to Sir Charles Blount. In 1636, his son sold the estate to Sir John Bankes, who had been appointed attorney general to Charles I in 1634. Sir John was born in Cumberland, but through his extensive legal works had acquired sufficient funds to purchase the Corfe estate. During the Civil War, the Bankes family remained loyal to the crown; Sir John died at Oxford in December 1644, the King having retired there for the winter.

Left to fend for herself during two sieges, his wife Mary Bankes defended Corfe Castle, but it eventually fell to the Parliamentary forces. In March 1645 Parliament voted to slight the castle, and it was left in its present ruinous state. Although deprived of their castle, the Bankes family owned some of the surrounding Dorset countryside and coastline. The masonry from the destroyed castle was used by local villagers to rebuild their own residences.

Sir Ralph died in 1677, and his widow let the house to James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormond from 1686 until he died there on 21 July 1688. John Bankes the Elder regained the property in 1693, and with his wife Margaret, daughter of Sir Henry Parker of Honington Hall, completed most of his father&#x27;s original development plan. In 1772 the house passed to his second son Henry who remodelled it, built a servants&#x27; wing, and enclosed the parkland for better agricultural management.

The 1784 Enclosure Act allowed Henry Bankes the Younger, grandson of Ralph Bankes, to create the current estate and parkland footprint. He demolished the hamlet of Kingston which was situated adjacent to the 16th-century Keeper&#x27;s Lodge, diverted the Blandford road (now the B3082) and converted former agricultural land to parkland. He undertook further minor alterations in the 1820s, before he became a Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Corfe Castle. He was a trustee for the British Museum and its parliamentary advocate, and some of his collections which were once part of the house, are now in the museum. Bankes entertained his friends at the house, including William Pitt the Younger and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.

Bankes&#x27; son, the explorer and adventurer William John Bankes, commissioned his friend Charles Barry to encase the red brick hall in stone, and enlarge his other property Soughton Hall. Barry remodelled Kingston Lacy between 1835 and 1838. The work involved facing the brick with Chilmark stone, adding a tall chimney at each corner, and lowering the ground level on one side to expose the basement level and form a new principal entrance. He planted beech tree avenues along the Blandford Road, of which some survives.
William John Bankes collected most of the house&#x27;s antiquities. He travelled extensively in the Middle East and Asia, amassing the world&#x27;s largest individual collection of Ancient Egyptian antiques. Most notable is the Philae obelisk which stands prominently in the grounds of the house. When in Genoa he acquired the 1606 &quot;Portrait of Maria di Antonio Serra&quot; by Sir Peter Paul Rubens. In 1841, after being caught in a homosexual scandal that could have resulted in a trial and his execution, William John fled the country for Italy. His art collection was left at Kingston Lacy, where his notes and drawings remained for many years in a cabinet, unpublished and forgotten.

During William John&#x27;s absence the estate was managed by his brother, George Bankes, who inherited it on his brother&#x27;s death just a year before his own in 1857. His youngest grandson Walter Ralph inherited the estate in 1869, and later in life married Henrietta, and had a son: Henry John Ralph Bankes. After Walter&#x27;s death in 1902, his widow undertook the last major developments to the estate, including construction of the church (1907), new entrance lodges (1912–13) and numerous estate cottages. In 1923 control passed to Ralph Bankes, the seven times great-grandson of the original creator. During the Second World War an extensive military encampment was established in the south-east quarter of the park, which was only restored after the National Trust took ownership. Ralph Bankes died in 1981 and the Kingston Lacy estate, including 12 working farms, and Corfe Castle were bequeathed to the National Trust. The gift was formally accepted on 19 August 1982, the largest bequest that it had ever accepted.

==Architecture==

After the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, the Bankes family regained their properties. Rather than rebuild Corfe Castle, the eldest son Ralph Bankes built a house on their other Dorset estate near Wimborne Minster. In 1663, he commissioned Sir Roger Pratt to design a new house to be known as Kingston Hall on the current site, based on Clarendon House which he had visited several times. Construction started the same year, and was completed by 1665.

The design, like Pratt&#x27;s other large country house Horseheath Manor in Cambridgeshire, was much influenced by Chevening. Like that house, the hall is two storeys high, though the great stair has been moved from the centre of the house&quot; Instead the great stair and the back stairs are situated symmetrically on either side of the hall, on the main long axis of the house.

Pratt&#x27;s original plans have been lost, but extensive notes on his intentions have survived. On each of the two main floors he placed identical apartments about square at the four corners, each with two square closets at their outer end. This provided flexibility of use for the rooms. Two of the inner closets housed servants&#x27; stairs. The two ends of the bedroom floor were connected by a balcony supported by columns which may have served the additional purpose of helping support the north side of the cupola.

Built of red brick with Chilmark and Portland stone dressings, the house has a compact, rectangular plan and has two main floors, plus a basement and an attic floor lit by dormer windows. On the south façade, there are eight casement windows in the basement and nine sash windows on each of the ground floor and first floor. The bay with the three central windows projects forwards slightly, and the central ground floor window is pedimented. The lead-covered hipped roof has a central flat section, surrounded by a balustrade with a cupola rising from its centre. The dormer windows are in a central, balustraded terrace of three, with an outlying window on either side. The house is entered from the north through a later mid-19th-century porte-cochère, while to the south there is a stone-flagged terrace with balustrade extending the full width of the building, and broad shallow steps leading down to the lawns. The east façade has a triple-arched loggia with access to the garden, while to the west there is access to the later 18th-century laundry and kitchen garden.

The interiors were influenced by Inigo Jones, but executed by his heir John Webb, a fact confirmed many years later when the National Trust discovered Webb&#x27;s plans during their formal takeover of the estate. The interiors mostly date from about 1835. The hall has a barrel-vaulted high ceiling with painted decoration and the dining room has panelled walls, tapestries and a decorated plaster ceiling. The library has a ceiling painting attributed to Guido Reni. The staircase is of white marble with turned balusters and a relief frieze, its ornamented ceiling being attributed to Giorgione.

Sited centrally within the grounds, externally the new house was provided with of formal gardens and pleasure grounds; some of these were enclosed by walls, while a series of wide avenues radiated throughout the surrounding of parkland. The house is a Grade I listed building having been so designated on 18 March 1955.

==Collections==

On display in the house is an important collection of fine art and antiquities built up by many generations of the Bankes family, the core having been assembled by Sir Ralph Bankes in Gray&#x27;s Inn before the house was built. One of the rooms, the Spanish room (named by reason of the paintings of Bartolomé Esteban Murillo which hang there), has walls hung with gilded leather. It was recently restored at a cost of several hundred thousand pounds over a five-year period. Other important collections include paintings of the Bankes family stretching back over 400 years. Other artworks include &quot;The Judgement of Solomon&quot; by Sebastiano del Piombo and works by Diego Velázquez, Anthony van Dyck, Titian and Jan Brueghel the Younger. A portrait of Nicolò Zen the younger by Titian was discovered in the collection in 2008.

Apart from the Spanish Room, the library is the most atmospheric of rooms, upon the wall of which are hung the huge keys of the destroyed Corfe Castle, handed back to Mary Bankes after her defence of Corfe Castle during the Civil War. The state bedroom is extremely ornate and has housed such important guests as Kaiser Wilhelm II who stayed with the family for a week in 1907. The main staircase is beautifully carved from stone and features three huge statues which look out onto the gardens from their seats. These depict Sir John Bankes and Lady Bankes, the defenders of Corfe Castle, and their patron, Charles I.

==Gardens==
The land surrounding Kingston Lacy was registered as being of special historic interest in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens in 1986, it being &quot;parkland developed in the seventeenth, late eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, together with late nineteenth-century formal gardens and informal pleasure grounds.&quot; The estate comprises about of parkland and other ornamental land and about of gardens. The site slopes gently towards the southwest and includes the summit of the Iron Age hillfort of Badbury Rings towards its northwest extremity, and within the estate is part of the Roman road from Dorchester to Old Sarum.

The estate has two main entrances on Blandford Road, each with a lodge and ornate gateway. The broad drives sweep round to a carriage-turning area by the north façade of the house. The park is mainly pastureland with informal plantings of specimen trees, designed to create pleasant vistas. There are two water features to the northeast of the house.

The formal gardens and pleasure grounds are situated close to the house, with an area of informal pleasure grounds extending to the south-east. Two features are the Cedar Walk and the Lime Walk, both majestic avenues to the south of the house, as well as a plantation known as Blind Wood. There is a terrace in front of the house with urns and vases, overlooking an extensive lawned area. Other features include a Victorian fernery and a sunken garden. To the west of the house, there is a rose garden with a central circular lawn. The kitchen garden lies to the south of the pleasure grounds and is now a commercial nursery. The house and gardens are open to the public and in 2019 received about 410,000 visitors.

<doc id="347725" wikidata="Q1566316" url="?curid=347725" title="Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907">
<text>The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 are a series of international treaties and declarations negotiated at two international peace conferences at The Hague in the Netherlands. Along with the Geneva Conventions, the Hague Conventions were among the first formal statements of the laws of war and war crimes in the body of secular international law. A third conference was planned for 1914 and later rescheduled for 1915, but it did not take place because of the start of World War I.

==History==
The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 were the first multilateral treaties that addressed the conduct of warfare and were largely based on the Lieber Code, which was signed and issued by US President Abraham Lincoln to the Union Forces of the United States on 24 April 1863, during the American Civil War. The Lieber Code was the first official comprehensive codified law that set out regulations for behavior in times of martial law; protection of civilians and civilian property and punishment of transgression; deserters, prisoners of war, hostages, and pillaging; partisans; spies; truces and prisoner exchange; parole of former rebel troops; the conditions of any armistice, and respect for human life; assassination and murder of soldiers or citizens in hostile territory; and the status of individuals engaged in a state of civil war against the government.

As such, the code was widely regarded as the best summary of the first customary laws and customs of war in the 19th century. It was welcomed and adopted by military establishments of other nations. The 1874 Brussels Declaration, which was never adopted by all major nations, listed 56 articles that drew inspiration from the Lieber Code. Much of the regulations in the Hague Conventions borrowed heavily from the Lieber Code.

The Hague Convention of 1899 was notably attended by the Korean Empire as an independent country, prior to its loss of independence in 1905 that prevented it from attending the Hague Convention of 1907.

==Subject matter==
Both conferences included negotiations concerning disarmament, the laws of war and war crimes. A major effort in both conferences was the creation of a binding international court for compulsory arbitration to settle international disputes, which was considered necessary to replace the institution of war.

This effort failed at both conferences. Instead, a voluntary forum for arbitration, the Permanent Court of Arbitration, was established. Most of the countries present, including the United States, Great Britain, Russia, France, China and Persia, favoured a process for binding international arbitration, but the provision was vetoed by a few countries, led by Germany.

==Hague Convention of 1899==

The First Hague Conference came from a proposal on 24 August 1898 by Russian Tsar Nicholas II. Nicholas and Count Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov, his foreign minister, were instrumental in initiating the conference. The conference opened on 18 May 1899, the Tsar&#x27;s birthday. The treaties, declarations, and final act of the conference were signed on 29 July of that year, and they entered into force on 4 September 1900. What is referred to as the Hague Convention of 1899 consisted of three main treaties and three additional declarations:
; (I) Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes
:This convention included the creation of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which exists to this day. The section was ratified by all major powers and many smaller powers26 signatories in total. All signatories would ratify by 1904, except the Ottoman Empire which ratified in 1907.
; (II) Convention with respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land
:This voluminous convention contains the laws to be used in all wars on land between signatories. It specifies the treatment of prisoners of war, includes the provisions of the Geneva Convention of 1864 for the treatment of the wounded, and forbids the use of poisons, the killing of enemy combatants who have surrendered, looting of a town or place, and the attack or bombardment of undefended towns or habitations. Inhabitants of occupied territories may not be forced into military service against their own country and collective punishment is forbidden.
; (III) Convention for the Adaptation to Maritime Warfare of the Principles of the Geneva Convention of 22 August 1864
:This convention provides for the protection of marked hospital ships and requires them to treat the wounded and shipwrecked sailors of all belligerent parties. It too was ratified by all major powers.
; (IV,1) Declaration concerning the Prohibition of the Discharge of Projectiles and Explosives from Balloons or by Other New Analogous Methods
:This declaration provides that, for a period of five years, in any war between signatory powers, no projectiles or explosives would be launched from balloons, &quot;or by other new methods of a similar nature&quot;. The declaration was ratified by all the major powers except the United Kingdom and the United States.
; (IV,2) Declaration concerning the Prohibition of the Use of Projectiles with the Sole Object to Spread Asphyxiating Poisonous Gases
:This declaration states that, in any war between signatory powers, the parties will abstain from using projectiles &quot;the sole object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases&quot;. Ratified by all major powers, except the United States.
; (IV,3) Declaration concerning the Prohibition of the Use of Bullets which can Easily Expand or Change their Form inside the Human Body such as Bullets with a Hard Covering which does not Completely Cover the Core, or containing Indentations
:This declaration states that, in any war between signatory powers, the parties will abstain from using &quot;bullets which expand or flatten easily in the human body&quot;. This directly banned soft-point bullets (which had a partial metal jacket and an exposed tip) and &quot;cross-tipped&quot; bullets (which had a cross-shaped incision in their tip to aid in expansion, nicknamed &quot;dum dums&quot; from the Dum Dum Arsenal in India). It was ratified by all major powers, except the United States.

==Hague Convention of 1907==

The Second Hague Conference, in 1907, resulted in conventions containing only few major advancements from the 1899 Convention. However, the meeting of major powers did prefigure later 20th-century attempts at international cooperation.

The second conference was called at the suggestion of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt in 1904. It was postponed because of the war between Russia and Japan. The Second Peace Conference was held from 15 June to 18 October 1907. The intent of the conference was to expand upon the 1899 Hague Convention by modifying some parts and adding new topics; in particular, the 1907 conference had an increased focus on naval warfare.

The British attempted to secure the limitation of armaments, but these efforts were defeated by the other powers, led by Germany, which feared a British attempt to stop the growth of the German fleet. As Britain had the world&#x27;s largest navy, limits on naval expansion would preserve that dominant position. Germany also rejected proposals for compulsory arbitration. However, the conference did enlarge the machinery for voluntary arbitration and established conventions regulating the collection of debts, rules of war, and the rights and obligations of neutrals.

The treaties, declarations, and final act of the Second Conference were signed on 18 October 1907; they entered into force on 26 January 1910. The 1907 Convention consists of thirteen treaties—of which twelve were ratified and entered into force—and one declaration:
; (I) Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes
:This convention confirms and expands on Convention (I) of 1899. As of February 2017, this convention is in force for 102 states, and 116 states have ratified one or both of the 1907 Convention (I) and the 1899 Convention (I), which together are the founding documents of the Permanent Court of Arbitration.
; (II) Convention respecting the Limitation of the Employment of Force for Recovery of Contract Debts
: This convention requires debts between contracting parties to be settled by arbitration (as set out in Convention I) rather than war, unless the debtor refuses to negotiate or reneges on an agreed settlement.
; (III) Convention relative to the Opening of Hostilities
:This convention sets out the accepted procedure for a state making a declaration of war. It provides the basis on which, in international law, war reparations may be demanded.
; (IV) Convention respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land
:This convention confirms, with minor modifications, the provisions of Convention (II) of 1899. All major powers ratified it.
; (V) Convention relative to the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in case of War on Land
; (VI) Convention relative to the Legal Position of Enemy Merchant Ships at the Start of Hostilities
; (VII) Convention relative to the Conversion of Merchant Ships into War-ships
; (VIII) Convention relative to the Laying of Automatic Submarine Contact Mines
; (IX) Convention concerning Bombardment by Naval Forces in Time of War
; (X) Convention for the Adaptation to Maritime Warfare of the Principles of the Geneva Convention (of 6 July 1906)
:This convention updated Convention (III) of 1899 to reflect the amendments that had been made to the 1864 Geneva Convention. Convention (X) was ratified by all major states except Britain. It was subsequently superseded by the Second Geneva Convention.
; (XI) Convention relative to Certain Restrictions with regard to the Exercise of the Right of Capture in Naval War
; (XII) Convention relative to the Establishment of an International Prize Court
:This convention would have established the International Prize Court for the resolution of conflicting claims relating to captured ships during wartime. It is the one convention that never came into force. It was ratified only by Nicaragua.
; (XIII) Convention concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War
; (XIV) Declaration Prohibiting the Discharge of Projectiles and Explosives from Balloons
:This declaration extended the provisions of Declaration (IV,1) of 1899 to the close of the planned Third Peace Conference (which never took place). Among the major powers, this was ratified only by China, Britain, and the United States.

At the same time an International socialist Congress was standing in Stuttgart, in which the British delegate Harry Quelch labelled the Hague Convention a &quot;thieves&#x27; supper&quot;. German authorities were swift in expelling Quelch from the country for his remarks, an action which boosted British esteem in the eyes of their radical peers.

===Participants===

The Brazilian delegation was led by Ruy Barbosa, whose contributions are seen today by some analysts as essential for the defense of the principle of legal equality of nations. The British delegation included Sir Edward Fry, Sir Ernest Satow, the 11th Lord Reay (Donald James Mackay) and Sir Henry Howard as delegates, and Eyre Crowe as a technical delegate. The Russian delegation was led by Friedrich Martens. The Uruguayan delegation was led by José Batlle y Ordóñez, a defender of the idea of compulsory arbitration.

With Louis Renault and Léon Bourgeois, Paul Henri d&#x27;Estournelles de Constant was a member of the French delegation for both the 1899 and 1907 delegations. He later won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1909 for his efforts. The U.S. representative, with the rank of ambassador, was former American Bar Association president U. M. Rose. The main representative of the Chinese Empire was Lu Zhengxiang, who would become Prime Minister of the Republic of China in 1912. Also in attendance on behalf of China was former U.S. Secretary of State John Watson Foster. China&#x27;s main military representative was Colonel Ding Shiyuan, whose suggestion regarding the need for a more specific legal definition of &quot;war&quot; was rejected by most of the Western participants.

Though not negotiated in The Hague, the Geneva Protocol to the Hague Conventions is considered an addition to the Conventions. Signed on 17 June 1925 and entering into force on 8 February 1928, its single article permanently bans the use of all forms of chemical and biological warfare in interstate armed conflicts. The protocol grew out of the increasing public outcry against chemical warfare following the use of mustard gas and similar agents in World War I, and fears that chemical and biological warfare could lead to horrific consequences in any future war. The protocol has since been augmented by the Biological Weapons Convention (1972) and the Chemical Weapons Convention (1993).

==Legacy==
Many of the rules laid down at the Hague Conventions were violated in World War I. The German invasion of neutral Luxembourg and Belgium in August 1914 in order to outflank France, for instance, was a violation of Convention (V) of 1907, which states that belligerents must not violate neutral territory and move troops across said territory. Poison gas was introduced and used by all major belligerents throughout the war, in violation of the Declaration (IV, 2) of 1899 and Convention (IV) of 1907, which explicitly forbade the use of &quot;poison or poisoned weapons&quot;.

Writing in 1918, the German international law scholar and neo-Kantian pacifist Walther Schücking called the assemblies the &quot;international union of Hague conferences&quot;. Schücking saw the Hague conferences as a nucleus of a future international federation that was to meet at regular intervals to administer justice and develop international law procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes, asserting that &quot;a definite political union of the states of the world has been created with the First and Second Conferences&quot;.

After World War II, the judges of the military tribunal of the Trial of German Major War Criminals at Nuremberg Trials found that by 1939, the rules laid down in the 1907 Hague Convention &quot;IV – Laws and Customs of War on Land&quot; were recognized by all civilized nations and were regarded as declaratory of the laws and customs of war. Under this post-war decision, a country did not have to have ratified the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare in order to be bound by them. (Germany was in any case a signatory since 1909.)

Although their contents have largely been superseded by other treaties, the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 continue to stand as symbols of the need for restrictions on war and the desirability of avoiding it altogether. Since 2000, Convention (I) of 1907 on the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes has been ratified by 20 additional states.

<doc id="347726" wikidata="Q1780096" url="?curid=347726" title="Schematron">
<text>Schematron is a rule-based validation language for making assertions about the presence or absence of patterns in XML trees. It is a structural schema language expressed in XML using a small number of elements and XPath languages. In many implementations, the Schematron XML is processed into XSLT code for deployment anywhere that XSLT can be used.

Schematron is capable of expressing constraints in ways that other XML schema languages like XML Schema and DTD cannot. For example, it can require that the content of an element be controlled by one of its siblings. Or it can request or require that the root element, regardless of what element that is, must have specific attributes. Schematron can also specify required relationships between multiple XML files. Constraints and content rules may be associated with &quot;plain-English&quot; (or any language) validation error messages, allowing translation of numeric Schematron error codes into meaningful user error messages. Users of Schematron define all the error messages themselves. 

The current ISO recommendation is &quot;Information technology, Document Schema Definition Languages (DSDL)&quot;, Part 3: &quot;Rule-based validation, Schematron&quot; (ISO/IEC 19757-3:2020).

== Uses ==
Constraints are specified in Schematron using an XPath-based language that can be deployed as XSLT code, making it practical for applications such as the following:
; Adjunct to Structural Validation: By testing for co-occurrence constraints, non-regular constraints, and inter-document constraints, Schematron can extend the validations that can be expressed in languages such as DTDs, RELAX NG or XML Schema.
; Lightweight Business Rules Engine: Schematron is not a comprehensive, Rete rules engine, but it can be used to express rules about complex structures with an XML document.
; XML Editor Syntax Highlighting Rules: Some XML editors use Schematron rules to conditionally highlight XML files for errors. Not all XML editors support Schematron.

== Versions ==
Schematron was invented by Rick Jelliffe while at Academia Sinica Computing Centre, Taiwan. He described Schematron as &quot;a feather duster to reach the parts other schema languages cannot reach&quot;.

The most common versions of Schematron are:
* Schematron 1.0 (1999)
* Schematron 1.3 (2000): This version used the namespace &quot;http://xml.ascc.net/schematron/&quot;. It was supported by an XSLT implementation with a plug-in architecture.
* Schematron 1.5 (2001): This version was widely implemented and can still be found.
* Schematron 1.6 (2002): This version was the base of ISO Schematron and obsoleted by it.
* ISO Schematron (2006): This version regularizes several features, and provides an XML output format, Schematron Validation Report Language (SVRL). It uses the new namespace &quot;http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron&quot;.
* ISO Schematron (2010)
* ISO Schematron (2016): This version added support for XSLT2.
* ISO Schematron (2020): This version added support for XSLT3.

== Schematron as an ISO Standard ==
Schematron has been standardized by the ISO as &quot;Information technology, Document Schema Definition Languages (DSDL)&quot;, Part 3: &quot;Rule-based validation, Schematron&quot; (ISO/IEC 19757-3:2020).

This standard is currently not listed on the ISO Publicly Available Specifications list. Paper versions may be purchased from ISO or national standards bodies.

Schemas that use ISO/IEC FDIS 19757-3 should use the following namespace:

http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron 
== Sample rule ==
Schematron rules can be created using a standard XML editor or XForms application. The following is a sample schema:

&lt;schema xmlns=&quot;http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron&quot;&gt;
 &lt;pattern&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Date rules&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;rule context=&quot;Contract&quot;&gt;
 &lt;assert test=&quot;ContractDate &gt; current-date()&quot;&gt;ContractDate should be
 in the past because future contracts are not allowed.&lt;/assert&gt;

This rule checks to make sure that the XML element has a date that is before the current date. If this rule fails the validation will fail and an error message which is the body of the assert element will be returned to the user.

== Implementation ==
Schematron schemas are suitable for use in XML Pipelines, thereby allowing workflow process designers to build and maintain rules using XML manipulation tools. The W3C&#x27;s XProc pipelining language, for example, has native support for Schematron schema processing through its &quot;validate-with-schematron&quot; step.

Since Schematron schemas can be transformed into XSLT stylesheets, these can themselves be used in XML Pipelines which support XSLT transformation. An Apache Ant task can be used to convert Schematron rules into XSLT files.

There exists also native Schematron implementation, like the Java implementation from Innovimax/INRIA, QuiXSchematron, that also do streaming.

<text>Lap-Chee Tsui (; born 21 December 1950) is a Chinese-born Canadian geneticist and served as the 14th Vice-Chancellor and President of the University of Hong Kong.

==Personal life==
He grew up in Kowloon, Hong Kong and attended .

He studied Biology at the New Asia College of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and was awarded a B.Sc. and a M.Phil. in 1972 and 1974, respectively. Upon the recommendation of his mentor at the CUHK, he continued his graduate education in the United States and received his Ph.D. from the University of Pittsburgh in 1979. He became Postdoctoral Investigator and Postdoctoral Fellow in 1979 at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee, then joined the Department of Genetics of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto in 1981.

==Career==

From 1981 to 2002, Tsui continued his research and teaching in the Hospital for Sick Children and the University of Toronto alternatively. Prior to his appointment as the Vice-Chancellor, he was Geneticist-in-Chief and Head of the Genetics and Genomic Biology Program of the Research Institute at the Hospital for Sick Children and co-founder (with Dr. Steve Scherer) of The Centre for Applied Genomics. He was also the holder of the H.E. Sellers Chair in Cystic Fibrosis and University Professor at the University of Toronto. He was the President of Human Genome Organisation (HUGO), the international organisation of scientists involved in the Human Genome Project, from 2000 to 2002.

He has also served on the editorial boards for 20 international peer-reviewed scientific journals, numerous scientific review panels, and many national and international advisory committees, including the Medical Research Council of Canada, Canadian Genome Research Task Force Committee (Chair), Scientific Steering Committee of the National Institute of Biological Science, Scientific Advisory Committee of the China National Center for Biotechnology Development and Human Genome Organisation. He is currently member of the Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission, Council for Sustainable Development and Executive Committee, and Executive Committee of the Commission on Strategic Development of the Hong Kong SAR Government.

He was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) in May 2002 and assumed office as the fourteenth Vice-Chancellor of the university with effect from 1 September 2002. As of October 2011, he had decided not to seek re-appointment. He served until

==Academic contributions==
Tsui became internationally acclaimed in 1989 when he and his team identified the defective gene, namely Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), that causes cystic fibrosis, which is a major breakthrough in human genetics. He has also made significant contributions to the study of the human genome, especially the characterisation of chromosome 7, and, identification of additional disease genes.

==Honours and awards==

Tsui has received numerous awards and honours for his outstanding work over the years. His honours include the titles of Distinguished Scientist of the Medical Research Council of Canada, Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, Fellow of the Royal Society of London, Fellow of Academia Sinica, Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences (US), Honorary Fellow of Royal College of Physicians (UK) and Honorary Fellow of World Innovation Foundation.

In addition to many national and international prizes, including the Killam Prize by the Canada Council for the Arts, Gairdner International Award, Elliott Cresson Medal of Franklin Institute, and Mead Johnson Award, he was awarded honorary doctoral degrees by the University of Toronto, University of King&#x27;s College, University of New Brunswick, Chinese University of Hong Kong, St. Francis Xavier University, York University, Tel Aviv University and University of Western Ontario.

In 1991, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, and in October 2007, he was decorated as Knight of the Légion d&#x27;Honneur of France.
He also received the Order of Ontario and the title of Justice of the Peace (HKSAR) from the Hong Kong SAR Government. In 2012, he was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame. He is an inductee into the Etobicoke Hall of Fame.

In 2006, the fifth floor of the University of Toronto&#x27;s Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research was named after Tsui Lap-chee to honour his research work.

==Controversy==

Tsui became the centre of controversy following Chinese Vice-Premier Li Keqiang&#x27;s visit to the centenary ceremony of Hong Kong University on 18 August 2011. During the Vice Premier&#x27;s visit, police used what a review concluded was unnecessary and unjustifiable force to push some students into a stairwell away from the Vice-Premier. Tsui was later accused by the students of pandering to the Chinese central government and failing to protect both the freedom of speech and expression, as well as academic freedoms of students.

In a statement to the HKU community, Tsui admitted that the security arrangements could have been better planned and organised. He also apologised to the university&#x27;s students and alumni for not having been able to prevent the unfortunate incident. He assured them that &quot;the University campus belongs to students and teachers and it will always remain a place for freedom of expression.&quot;

<doc id="347729" wikidata="Q1429120" url="?curid=347729" title="Wilton House">
<text>Wilton House is an English country house at Wilton near Salisbury in Wiltshire, which has been the country seat of the Earls of Pembroke for over 400 years. It was built on the site of the medieval Wilton Abbey. Following the dissolution of the monasteries, Henry VIII presented Wilton Abbey and its attached estates to William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke. The house has literary associations. Shakespeare&#x27;s theatre company performed there (&quot;As You Like It&quot; may have been the chosen work), and there was an important literary salon culture under its occupation by Mary Sidney, wife of the second Earl.

The present Grade I listed house is the result of rebuilding after a 1647 fire, although a small section of the house built for William Herbert survives; alterations were made in the early 19th and early 20th centuries. The house stands in gardens and a park which are also Grade I listed. While still a family home, the house and grounds are open to visitors during the summer months.

==Tudor phase==
William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke, the scion of a distinguished family in the Welsh marches, was a favourite of King Henry VIII. Following a recommendation to Henry by King Francis I of France, whom Herbert had served as a soldier of fortune, he was granted arms. In 1538, he married Anne Parr, daughter of Sir Thomas Parr of Kendal and sister of the future queen consort Catherine Parr (1543–1547) and Sir William Parr, 1st Baron Parr of Kendal (later Marquess of Northampton).

Following the dissolution of the monasteries, Henry presented Wilton Abbey and its attached estates to Herbert. The granting of such an estate was an accolade and evidence of his position at court. The first grants, dated March and April 1542, include the site of the late monastery, the manor of Washerne adjoining, and also the manors of Chalke. These were given to &quot;William Herbert, Esquire and Anne his wife for the term of their lives with certain reserved rents to King Henry VIII.&quot; When Edward VI re-granted the manors to the family, it was explicitly &quot;to the aforenamed Earl, by the name of Sir William Herbert, knight, and the Lady Anne his wife and the heirs male of their bodies between them lawfully begotten.&quot;

Herbert built Wilton House, probably on the same site as the abbey, between 1544 and 1563. According to John Aubrey&#x27;s &quot;Brief Life&quot;, Herbert was briefly dispossessed under Mary I of England:&quot;In Queen Mary&#x27;s time, upon the return of the Catholique religion, the nunnes came again to Wilton Abbey; and this William, Earl of Pembroke, came to the gate which lookes towards the court by the street, but now is walled up, with his cappe in his hand, and fell upon his knees to the Lady Abbess and nunnes, crying peccavi. Upon Queen Mary&#x27;s death, the Earl came to Wilton (like a tygre) and turned them out crying, &#x27;Out, ye whores! to worke, to worke—ye whores, goe spinne!&quot;

The Wilton Circle were an influential group of 16th-century English poets, led by Mary Sidney and based at Wilton. Sidney turned Wilton into a &quot;paradise for poets&quot;, and the circle included Edmund Spenser, Michael Drayton, Sir John Davies, Abraham Fraunce, and Samuel Daniel.

They are described as &quot;the most important and influential literary circle in English history&quot; and Mary Sidney has been called a &quot;patroness of the muses&quot;.

==Hans Holbein==
It has long been claimed, without proof, that Hans Holbein the Younger re-designed the abbey as a rectangular house around a central courtyard, which is the core of the present house. Holbein died in 1543, so his designs for the new house would have had to be very speedily executed. However, the highly ornamented entrance porch to the new mansion, removed from the house around 1800 and later transformed into a garden pavilion, is to this day known as the &quot;Holbein Porch&quot; – a perfect example of the blending of the older Gothic and the brand-new Renaissance style.

Whoever the architect, a great mansion arose, an early prodigy house by a courtier of the Tudors. Today only one other part of the Tudor mansion survives: the great tower in the centre of the east facade. With its central arch (once giving access to the court beyond) and three floors of oriel windows above, the tower is slightly reminiscent of the entrance at Hampton Court. It is flanked today by two wings in a loose Georgian style, each topped by an Italianate pavilion tower.

==Royal court at Wilton in 1603==

The Tudor house built by William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke, in 1551 lasted 80 years. King James, Anne of Denmark, and Prince Henry stayed at Wilton in November and December 1603, due to plague in London and gave an audience to two Venetian ambassadors, Nicolò Molin and Piero Duodo. The court at Wilton was entertained by John Heminges and the King&#x27;s Men who were paid £30 for a play on 2 December. They are said to have performed &quot;As You Like It&quot;.

==Inigo Jones==
On the succession of the 4th Earl in 1630, he decided to pull down the southern wing and erect a new complex of staterooms in its place. It is now that the second great name associated with Wilton appears: Inigo Jones.

The architecture of the south front is in severe Palladian style, described at the time as in the &quot;Italian Style;&quot; built of the local stone, softened by climbing shrubs, it is quintessentially English to our eyes today. While the remainder of the house is on three floors of equal value in the English style, the south front has a low rusticated ground floor, almost suggesting a semi-basement. Three small porches project at this level only, one at the centre, and one at each end of the facade, providing small balconies to the windows above. The next floor is the piano nobile, at its centre the great double-height Venetian window, ornamented at second floor level by the Pembroke arms in stone relief. This central window is flanked by four tall sash windows on each side. These windows have low flat pediments. Each end of the facade is defined by &quot;corner stone&quot; decoration giving a suggestion that the single-bay wings project forward. The single windows here are topped by a true pointed pediment.

Above this floor is a further almost mezzanine floor, its small unpedimented windows aligning with the larger below, serve to emphasise the importance of the piano nobile. The roofline is hidden by a balustrade. Each of the terminating &#x27;wings&#x27; is crowned by a one-storey, pedimented tower resembling a Palladian pavilion. At the time, his style was an innovation. Just thirty years earlier, Montacute House, exemplifying the English Renaissance, had been revolutionary; only a century earlier, the juxtaposing mass of wings that is Compton Wynyates, one of the first houses to be built without complete fortification, had just been completed and was considered modern.

Attributing the various architectural stages can be difficult, and the degree to which Inigo Jones was involved has been questioned. Queen Henrietta Maria, a frequent guest at Wilton, interrogated Jones about his work there. At the time (1635) he was employed by her, completing the Queen&#x27;s House at Greenwich. It seems at this time Jones was too busy with his royal clients and did no more than provide a few sketches for a mansion, which he then delegated for execution to an assistant Isaac de Caus (sometimes spelt &#x27;Caux&#x27;), a Frenchman and landscape gardener from Dieppe.

A document that Howard Colvin found at Worcester College library in Oxford in the 1960s confirmed not only de Caus as the architect, but that the original plan for the south facade was to have been over twice the length of that built; what we see today was intended to be only one of two identical wings linked by a central portico of six Corinthian columns. The whole was to be enhanced by a great parterre whose dimensions were 1,000 feet by 400 feet. This parterre was in fact created and remained in existence for over 100 years. The second wing however failed to materialise – perhaps because of the 4th Earl&#x27;s quarrel with King Charles I and subsequent fall from favour, or the outbreak of the Civil War; or simply lack of finances.

It is only now that Inigo Jones may have taken a firmer grip on his original ideas. Seeing De Caus&#x27; completed wing standing alone as an entirety, it was considered too plain – De Caus&#x27; original plan was for the huge facade to have a low pitched roof, with wings finishing with no architectural symbols of termination. The modifications to the completed wing were of a balustrade hiding the weak roof line and Italianate, pavilion-like towers at each end. The focal point became not a portico but the large double height Venetian window. This south front (&quot;illustration above&quot;), has been deemed an architectural triumph of Palladian architecture in Britain, and it is widely believed that the final modifications to the work of De Caus were by Inigo Jones himself.

Within a few years of the completion of the new south wing in 1647, it was ravaged by fire. The seriousness of the fire and the devastation it caused is now a matter of some dispute. The architectural historian Christopher Hussey has convincingly argued that it was not as severe as some records have suggested. What is definite is that Inigo Jones now working with another architect John Webb (his nephew by marriage to Jones&#x27; niece) returned once again to Wilton. Because of the uncertainty of the fire damage to the structure of the house, the only work that can be attributed with any degree of certainty to the new partnership is the redesign of the interior of the seven state-rooms contained on the piano nobile of the south wing; and even here the extent of Jones&#x27; presence is questioned. It appears he may have been advising from a distance, using Webb as his medium.

==The state rooms==
The seven state rooms contained behind the quite simple Mannerist south front of Wilton House are equal to those in any of the great houses of Britain. State rooms in English country houses were designed, named, and reserved for the use of the visiting members of the royal family. State rooms usually occupy an entire facade of a house, and are nearly always of an odd number because the largest and most lavish room (at Wilton the famed Double Cube Room) is placed at the centre of the facade, with symmetrical sequences of smaller (but still very grand) rooms leading from the central room to either side, ending at the state bedrooms, which are at either end of the facade. The central salon was a gathering place for the court of the honoured guest. The comparatively smaller rooms in between the central room and the state bedrooms were designated for the sole use of the occupant of each bedroom, and would have been used for private audiences, withdrawing rooms, and dressing rooms. They were not for public use.

In most English houses today the original intention has been lost, and these rooms have usually become a meaningless succession of drawing rooms; this is certainly true at both Wilton House and Blenheim Palace. The reason for this is that, over time, the traditional occupants of the state bedrooms began to prefer the comfort of a warmer, more private bedroom on a quiet floor with an en-suite bathroom. By the Edwardian Period, large house-parties had adapted the state rooms to use as salons for playing bridge, dancing, talking, and generally amusing themselves.

The magnificent state rooms at Wilton, designed by Inigo Jones and one or another of his partners, are:
* The Single Cube Room: This room is a complete cube , wide and high, has gilded and white pine panelling, and is carved from dado to cornice. The white marble chimney piece was designed by Inigo Jones himself. The room has a painted ceiling, on canvas, by the Mannerist Italian painter Cavalier D&#x27;Arpino, representing &quot;Daedalus and Icarus&quot;. This room, hung with paintings by Lely and Van Dyck, is the only room thought to have survived the fire of 1647, and thus the only remaining interior of Jones and De Caus.
* The Double Cube Room: The great room of the house. It is , and . It was created by Inigo Jones and Webb circa 1653. The pine walls, painted white, are decorated with great swags of foliage and fruit in gold leaf. The gilt and red velvet furniture complements the collection of paintings by Van Dyck of the family of Charles I and the family of his contemporary Earl of Pembroke. Between the windows are mirrors by Chippendale and console tables by William Kent. The coffered ceiling, painted by Thomas de Critz, depicts the story of Perseus. Here again is another anomaly which makes one question the true involvement of Jones: the great Venetian window, centrepiece of the south front and centrepiece of the double cube room, is not the dead centre of the room&#x27;s outer wall; the other windows in the room are not symmetrically placed; and the central fireplace and Venetian window are not opposite each other as the proportions of a room designed as an architectural feature in itself would demand.
* The Great Anteroom: Before the modifications to the house in 1801, a great staircase of state led from this room to the courtyard below: this was the entrance to the state apartments. Here hangs one of Wilton&#x27;s greatest treasures: the portrait of his mother by Rembrandt.
* The Colonnade Room: This was formerly the state bedroom. The series of four gilded columns at one end of the room would have given a theatrical touch of importance to the now-missing state bed. It is furnished today with 18th-century furniture by William Kent. The room is hung with paintings by Reynolds and has a ceiling painted in an 18th-century theme of flowers, monkeys, urns, and cobwebs.

Other rooms are:
* The Corner Room: The ceiling in this room, representing the conversion of Saint Paul, was painted by Luca Giordano. The walls of the room are covered in red damask and adorned with small paintings by, among others, Rubens and Andrea del Sarto.
* The Little Ante Room: The white marble fireplace in this room, with inserts of black marble, is almost certainly by Inigo Jones. The panels in the ceiling were painted by Lorenzo Sabbatini (1530–1577) and therefore are far older than this part of the house; again there are paintings by Van Dyck and Teniers.
* The Hunting Room: This room, not shown to the public, is used as a private drawing room by the Herbert family. It is a square room with white panelling and gilded mouldings. The greatest feature of the room is the set of panels depicting hunting scenes by Edward Pierce painted circa 1653. These panels are set into the panelling rather than framed in the conventional sense.

Inigo Jones was a friend of the Herbert family. It has been said that Jones&#x27; original studying in Italy of Palladio and the other Italian masters was paid for by the 3rd Earl, father of the builder of the south front containing the state rooms. There are in existence designs for gilded doors and panels at Wilton annotated by Jones. It seems likely that Jones originally sketched some ideas for de Caus, and following the fire conveyed through Webb some further ideas for tidying the house and its decorations. Fireplaces and decorative themes can be executed at long distance. The exact truth of the work by Jones will probably never be known.

In 1705, following a fire, the 8th Earl rebuilt some of the oldest parts the house, making rooms to display his newly acquired Arundel marbles, which form the basis for the sculpture collection at Wilton today. Following this Wilton remained undisturbed for nearly a century.

==19th century and James Wyatt==
The 11th Earl (1759–1827) called upon James Wyatt in 1801 to modernise the house, and create more space for pictures and sculptures. The final of the three well-known architects to work at Wilton (and the only one well documented) was to prove the most controversial. His work took eleven years to complete.

James Wyatt was an architect who often employed the neo-classical style, but at Wilton for reasons known only to architect and client he used the Gothic style. Since the beginning of the 20th century his work at Wilton has been condemned by most architectural commentators. The negative points of his &#x27;improvements&#x27; to modern eyes are that he swept away the Holbein porch, reducing it to a mere garden ornament, replacing it with a new entrance and forecourt. This entrance forecourt created was entered through an &#x27;arc de triumph&#x27; which had been created as an entrance to Wilton&#x27;s park by Sir William Chambers circa 1755. The forecourt was bounded by the house on one side, with wings of fake doors and windows extending to form the court, all accessed by Chambers&#x27;s repositioned arch, crowned by a copy of the life-size equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius. While not altogether displeasing as an entrance to a country house, the impression created is more of a hunting estate in Northern France or Germany.
The original Great Hall of the Tudor house, the chapel and De Caus-painted staircase to the state apartments were all swept away at this time. A new Gothic staircase and hall were created in the style of Camelot. The Tudor tower, now the last remnant of William Herbert&#x27;s house, escaped unscathed except for the addition of two &#x27;medieval&#x27; statues at ground floor level.

There was however one huge improvement created by Wyatt – the cloisters. This two-storeyed gallery which was built around all four sides of the inner courtyard, provided the house with not only the much needed corridors to link the rooms, but also a magnificent gallery to display the Pembroke collection of classical sculpture. Wyatt died before completion, but not before he and Lord Pembroke had quarrelled over the designs and building work. The final touches were executed by Wyatt&#x27;s nephew Sir Jeffry Wyatville. Today nearly two hundred years later Wyatt&#x27;s improvements do not jar the senses as much as they did those of the great architectural commentators James Lees-Milne and Sir Sacheverell Sitwell writing in the 1960s. That Wyatt&#x27;s works are not in the same league of style as the south front, and the Tudor tower, is perhaps something for future generations to judge.

==Secondary rooms==
Wilton is not the largest house in England by any means: compared to Blenheim Palace, Chatsworth, Hatfield and Burghley House, its size is rather modest. However, aside from the magnificent state rooms, a number of secondary rooms are worthy of mention:
* The Front Hall: redesigned by Wyatt, access is gained from this room to the cloisters through two Gothic arches. The room is furnished with statuary; the dominating piece a larger than life statue of William Shakespeare designed by William Kent in 1743. It commemorates an unproved legend that Shakespeare came to Wilton and produced one of his plays in the courtyard.
* The Upper Cloisters: designed by Wyatt but completed circa 1824 by Wyatville in the Gothic style contain neoclassical sculpture, and curios such as a lock of Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s hair, and Napoleon I&#x27;s dispatch box and paintings by the Brueghel brothers.
* The Staircase: Designed by Wyatt, it replaces the muralled state staircase swept away during the &#x27;improvements&#x27;. The imperial staircase is lined with family portraits by Lely. Also hanging here is a portrait of Catherine Woronzow, the only sister of 1st Prince Vorontsov and the wife of the 11th Earl; her Russian sleigh is displayed in the cloisters.
* The Smoking Rooms: These rooms are in the wing attributed to Inigo Jones and John Webb linking to the south front. The cornices and doors are attributed to Jones. The larger of the two rooms contains a set of fifty-five gouache paintings of an equestrian theme painted in 1755. The room is furnished with a complete set of bureau, cabinets and break-front bookcases made for the room by Thomas Chippendale.
* The Library: A large book-lined room over 20 yards long, with views to a formal garden and vista leading to the &#x27;Holbein&#x27; porch. This is used as a private room and not shown to the public.
* The Breakfast Room: A private small low-ceilinged room on the rustic floor of the south front. In the 18th century this was the house&#x27;s only bathroom; more of an indoor swimming pool, the sunken plunge pool was heated and the room decorated in the Pompeian style complete with Corinthian columns. Converted by the Russian Countess of Pembroke to a breakfast room circa 1815, it is today wallpapered in a Chinese design, the paper being an exact copy of that used in the original 1815 decoration of the room. The 18th century furniture of a simulated-bamboo, Gothic style gives this private dining room a distinct oriental atmosphere.

== Associated buildings ==

=== Entrance arch and lodges ===
The north entrance to the house and the forecourt within it were created by Wyatt c.1801. The centrepiece is an ashlar arch, designed c.1758–62 by Sir William Chambers as a garden feature, and carrying a lead statue (probably of earlier date) of Marcus Aurelius on horseback. The structure has a pair of Corinthian columns at each corner and a dentil cornice, and the inner arch is on Doric columns and 18th-century wrought-iron gates. On each side Wyatt added a single-storey lodge in ashlar, with a balustraded parapet. The whole is Grade I listed.

=== Former stables ===
Washern Grange, south of the house and on the other side of the Nadder, is said to be a 1630s rebuilding of an earlier stable block, and incorporates a 14th-century barn which presumably belonged to the abbey. Built in brick with stone dressings and now several dwellings, the complex is Grade I listed. Washern was a manor (&quot;Waisel&quot; in Domesday Book) and later a suburb of Wilton, which was absorbed into the grounds of Wilton House.

==Gardens and grounds==
The house is renowned for its gardens. Isaac de Caus began a project to landscape them in 1632, laying out one of the first French parterres seen in England. An engraving of it made the design influential after the royal Restoration in 1660, when grand gardens began to be made again. The original gardens included a grotto and water features.

===Palladian Bridge===
After the parterre had been replaced by turf, the Palladian Bridge (1736–37, Grade I listed) over the little River Nadder, 90m south of the house, was designed by the 9th Earl in collaboration with architect Roger Morris. Balustraded stairs on each side lead through a pedimented arch into an open pavilion, and the central balustraded span has a high roof supported by a five-bay Ionic colonnade. The design was in part based on a rejected design by Palladio for the Rialto Bridge, Venice.

A copy of the bridge was erected at the much-visited garden of Stowe in Buckinghamshire, and three more were erected: at Prior Park, Bath; Hagley, Worcestershire; and Amesbury Abbey. Empress Catherine the Great commissioned another copy, known as the Marble Bridge, to be set up at the landscape park of Tsarskoye Selo.

===Lost settlement===
The park includes an area formerly occupied by much of the village of Fugglestone, which was cleared away, including the site of a medieval leper hospital called the Hospital of St Giles.

===Recent developments===
In the late 20th century, the 17th Earl had a garden created in Wyatt&#x27;s entrance forecourt, in memory of his father, the 16th Earl. This garden enclosed by pleached trees, with herbaceous plants around a central fountain, has done much to improve and soften the severity of the forecourt.

In 1987 the park and gardens were listed Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest.

==Today==
The house was recorded as Grade I listed in 1951. The house and gardens have been open to the public since that year, usually during the summer months.

Wilton was described by the architectural historian Sir John Summerson in 1964 as:

:...the bridge is the object which attracts the visitor before he has become aware of the Jonesian facade. He approaches the bridge and, from its steps, turns to see the facade. He passes through and across the bridge, turns again and becomes aware of the bridge, the river, the lawn and the façade as one picture in deep recession. ... Standing here he may reflect upon the way in which a scene so classical, so deliberate, so complete, has been accomplished not by the decisions of one mind at one time but by a combination of accident, selection, genius and the tides of taste.

As of 2012, the current earl, William Herbert, 18th Earl of Pembroke, and his family live in the house. In 2006, Herbert told &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; that the Wilton estate has around 140 employees. Its 14,000 acres are divided into 14 farms, one of which is run by the estate (the others are rented to tenants) and more than 200 residential properties. Although the house is open to the public, Herbert and his wife occupy about a third of the house privately. Salisbury Racecourse and South Wilts Golf Course are also on the 14,000 acre estate.

==In film and television==
The house has been used for filming, including: &quot;Romance with a Double Bass&quot; (1974); &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; (1975); &quot;The Music Lovers&quot;; &quot;The Bounty&quot; (1984); &quot;Treasure Houses of Britain&quot; (1985); &quot;Blackadder II&quot;; &quot;The Madness of King George&quot; (1994); &quot;Of Mirrors, Paintings and Windows: Spectatorship in Ang Lee’s Sense and Sensibility (1995)&quot;; &quot;Mrs Brown&quot; (1997); &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; (2005); &quot;The Young Victoria&quot; (2009); &quot;Outlander&quot; (2014); &quot;The Crown&quot; (2016); &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; (2018); &quot;Emma&quot; (2020); &quot;Bridgerton&quot; (2020); and &quot;The Diplomat&quot; (2024).

<doc id="347730" wikidata="Q7900552" url="?curid=347730" title="U. M. Rose">
<text>Uriah Milton Rose (March 5, 1834 – August 12, 1913) was an American lawyer and Confederate sympathizer. &quot;Approachable, affable, and kind,&quot; graceful and courteous, he was called &quot;the most scholarly lawyer in America&quot; and &quot;one of the leading legal lights of the nation&quot;, &quot;a towering figure in the...life of Little Rock&quot;. He was a founder of the American Bar Association, of which he was twice president, 1891–92 and 1901-02.

Another Arkansas judge, J. T. Coston, described him thus:

Arkansas is the home of the late U. M. Rose, a scholar and statesman. Judge Rose was one of the great lawyers not only of Arkansas but of the United States. Cultured, refined and modest as a woman, with a titanic intellect, he was a general favorite wherever he was known. Judge Dillon, after being thrown with him on numerous occasions at long intervals, pronounced Judge Rose the most cultured man he had ever known. He loved his profession, and I heard him state only a year or two before he died, while attending the Arkansas Bar Association, that during his more than half a century experience in the practice of law he had never had a serious misunderstanding with a brother lawyer.

President Theodore Roosevelt called him &quot;the brainiest man I have ever met&quot;.

==Childhood and personal life==
Rose was born in Bradfordsville, Kentucky, on a farm of 300 or 400 acres, on March 5, 1834, son of Joseph and Nancy Rose. His father was a physician and a Campbellite. He was his parents&#x27; third son and had two half-siblings from his father&#x27;s first marriage to a Miss Armstrong from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As there was no school in Bradfordsville, he was taught by a tutor; he was studying Latin at age five and later remarked that he could not remember when he could not read. He studied French and German with Europeans who happened to be in Bradfordsville. His mother died in 1848 and his father in 1849. Since his father&#x27;s estate was worth less than his debts, &quot;the children were thrown out&quot;. Rose then worked in the village store, where he also resided. When this did not leave him time to study, he resigned and worked on a farm, as a field hand, for board and $5 a month.

When Rose was 17, lawyer Rutherford Harrison Roundtree, who met him when visiting the farm, hired him as a deputy county clerk, and gave him &quot;a home in his house&quot; in Lebanon, Kentucky. There, he &quot;learned a great deal about legal forms&quot; and attended court, hearing the locally-famous attorneys Ben Hardin and Joshua F. Bell. To advance his legal education he enrolled at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. &quot;When Judge Rose, no more than a youth, presented himself for admission to the school, he impressed Justice Robertson so much with his earnestness and apparent willingness to learn, that Justice Robertson took him to live at his own splendid mansion. It was while at Justice Robertson&#x27;s home that Judge Rose met Henry Clay, Webster, and many other of the prominent men of the time.&quot; He graduated in six months.

On October 25, 1853, Rose married Margaret T. Gibbs, daughter of William Gibbs, who was a grandson of George Washington&#x27;s aide and bodyguard Caleb Gibbs.

Rose &quot;disliked his first name intensely and never used his first name when he could avoid it&quot;.

==Career==
===In Batesville===
After graduating in 1853, in search of warmer weather, Rose, his new wife, and his brother-in-law William T. Gibbs moved to Batesville, Arkansas, in 1853. He set up a law practice there in partnership with Gibbs. The Roses had three children. &quot;The couple bought a house on the north side of Main Street, between Third and Fourth Streets, and U. M. Rose rented a small building next door to use as an office.&quot; (&quot;He lived on the lot now [1935] occupied by a filling station just across the street from where the Crouch furniture store is now l[oca]ted. His law office was located in his yard.&quot;) Rose subsequently moved his practice to Washington, Arkansas.

In 1860, he was appointed chancellor (chancery judge and chief county officer) of Pulaski County; &quot;county judges in Arkansas have served for decades as one of the strongest political forces in the state.&quot; &quot;The [Pulaski County] chancellor&#x27;s office was the only such office in the state and thus had statewide jurisdiction.&quot; He held this position until Union forces captured the state capital on September 1, 1863. Although initially opposed to secession, on the practical ground that the South could not win a war against the North, he backed the Confederacy throughout the Civil War. (Both he and his brother-in-law each owned a slave, though his ran away.) He took an oath to support the Confederacy, without which he could not have continued as a state judge; when briefly captured by Union forces that occupied Batesville, he refused to swear allegiance to the Federal government. The Confederacy named him state historian. He moved with the pro-Confederate Arkansas government to Washington, Arkansas in 1863, following the fall of Little Rock. Rose, &quot;along with all men who had the welfare of the state at heart&quot;, &quot;worked hard&quot; to convince Arkansas voters not to ratify the Reconstruction Constitution. (As a Confederate loyalist, he had lost the right to vote.) He was chairman of the Resolutions Committee of the state Democratic party, determined &quot;to preserve &#x27;White Man&#x27;s government in a White Man&#x27;s country&quot;. (His wife was later active in the Daughters of the Confederacy.)

===In Little Rock===
The end of the Confederacy meant the end of his position as judge. Moving to Little Rock in 1865, where he and his wife had four additional children, he set up a law partnership, much later to become the Rose Law Firm, with George C. Watkins (1815–1872), former chief justice of Arkansas. This lasted until Watkins&#x27; retirement, five years later. He then brought in John Green, who died suddenly in May 1875. His son George B. Rose then became associated with him, under the firm name of U. M. &amp; G. B. Rose. In 1893 Wilson Hemingway, associate justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court since 1889, resigned from the court to join them. In 1905, the firm merged with Cantrell and Loughborough, and the partners adopted the named Rose, Hemingway, Cantrell, and Loughborough, which remained the name of the firm long after Rose&#x27;s death. The firm did not become the Rose Law Firm until 1980; no Rose has been associated with the firm since George&#x27;s death in 1942.

He was offered a position as U.S. Senator but declined, saying &quot;I have no love of political life. I have seen much of it at a distance. I regard it for the most part as a sham and a delusion, and often it is a shame and a disgrace.&quot;

A man of learning in the law, science, and literature, Rose knew both German and French; poems translated by him from the French of Sully Prudhomme and the German of Goethe and Schiller were published posthumously. When faced with a colonial document, he &quot;exhibited a degree of almost perfect familiarity with Spanish&quot;. He was &quot;deeply versed in the classics&quot;, and was also a noted and &quot;enthralling&quot; public speaker. In 1872 was the first of several trips to Europe, in which he visited Italy, Austria, Scandinavia, Russia, and Turkey; he also visited Mexico.

His library, which his widow donated to the Little Rock Public Library, contained over 8,000 volumes, including almost 2,000 books in French and German; there are two published catalogues of it. He was the organizer of the Arkansas Bar Association, whose first meeting was in his office, and its president from 1899 to 1900; he was a charter member of the American Bar Association and its president from 1891 to 1892 and again 1901 to 1902. President Theodore Roosevelt appointed him U.S. ambassador to the Second Peace Conference at The Hague in 1907. In preparation for that responsibility he spent time in Washington, D.C., where he was &quot;a daily caller at [the] White House&quot;.

Rose died at his home at 620 West 3rd St., Little Rock, Arkansas, on August 12, 1913, as a consequence of a fall. &quot;The funeral was attended perhaps by the largest number ever gathered on a similar occasion.&quot; People attended from &quot;every section of the state&quot;. State offices were closed by the governor so employees could attend the funeral.

He and his wife had nine children who survived to adulthood, in order of birth: John M. Rose (1855-1915), an attorney who practiced next door to his father but not in partnership with him, William G. Rose of Butler and Independence, Missouri (1857–1941), his partner George B. Rose (1860–1942), Janata Rose &quot;Fanny&quot; Dickinson of Little Rock (1863–1932), Lawrence (1866, died in infancy), Ellen Rose Gibbon or Gibbons of Los Angeles (1867–1915), Emma Rose Coleman (1870–1907), Charles C. Rose of Little Rock (1872–1954), Prof. Lewis Henry Rose of the University of Arkansas and of Chicago (1874–1921), and Mrs. (Jessie Rose) Hay Watson Smith of Brooklyn, N.Y., and Little Rock (1877-1953).
 His son George was &quot;known and honored not only as a most successful lawyer, but as a litterateur, art critic and scholar.&quot; His grandson U.M. Rose was president of the New Mexico Bar Association.

==Legacy==
Rose was the only delegate from Arkansas among the 75 lawyers who formed the American Bar Association in Saratoga Springs, New York in 1872. He was president from 1891 to 1892 and again from 1901 to 1902.

In 1882, at his suggestion, 68 lawyers from across the state formed the Arkansas State Bar Association. &quot;Rose was elected chairman of the association&#x27;s first executive committee and, between 1898 and 1899, served as president.&quot;

In 1916, a new U.M. Rose School was opened at 13th and State Streets in Little Rock. It became a central building of Little Rock Junior College when that institution was founded in 1927; when the Junior College became the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and moved to a larger campus, the former campus was used by Philander Smith College, where the building is currently (2019) the James M. Cox Administration Building.

In 1917, the state of Arkansas donated a marble statue of Rose to the U.S. Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall Collection. In 2019 the decision was made to replace his statue, and that of James Paul Clarke, with statues of Johnny Cash and Daisy Lee Gatson Bates. Arkansas state Sen. David Wallace, the lead sponsor of the bill to replace Rose, cited Rose&#x27;s perceived lack of name recognition in the present day, saying his &quot;time has faded&quot;.

In 1944, a United States Liberty ship named the &quot;SS Uriah M. Rose&quot; was launched. She was scrapped in 1972.

<text>The University of Newcastle is a public university in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia. Established in 1965, it has a primary campus in the Newcastle suburb of Callaghan. The university also operates campuses in Central Coast, Singapore, Newcastle City in the Hunter as well as Sydney.

The University of Newcastle is a member of the Australian Technology Network, Universities Australia and the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.

== History ==
=== Establishment ===
The earliest origins of the present-day University of Newcastle can be traced to the Newcastle Teachers College (established 1949) and Newcastle University College (NUC, established 1951). NUC was created as an offshoot of the New South Wales University of Technology (now known as the University of New South Wales) and was co-located with the Newcastle Technical College at Tighes Hill. At the time of its establishment, NUC had just five full-time students and study was restricted to engineering, mathematics and science.

=== Independence ===
Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Newcastle residents campaigned for NUC to be re-constituted as a university in its own right. The campaign was ultimately successful, with the University of Newcastle being established as an autonomous institution on 1 January 1965 by gubernatorial proclamation under the . The new university was granted a heraldic coat of arms by the College of Arms in London, an event seen by many in the community as signifying the new institution&#x27;s independence. In 1966, the university relocated from Tighes Hill to a largely undeveloped bushland site in Shortland.

As enrolments grew, the university embarked on a major building program and redeveloped the Shortland site into the Callaghan campus, named for Sir Bede Callaghan, foundation member of the university council and chancellor from 1977 to 1988.

Students at the university celebrate Autonomy Day on 1 July of each year. According to unverified sources, official autonomy was marked on 1 January 1965 with a &quot;symbolic ceremonial bonfire held at the site of the Great Hall&quot;. This celebration is said to have been officiated by Professor Godfrey Tanner who is said to have poured wine libations onto the ground as to &quot;sanctify the land upon which the University rests&quot;. Since the university technically became autonomous on 1 January 1965 autonomy day should be held on 1 January. 1 July actually coincided with the New South Wales University of Technology’s autonomy from the Public Service Board’s authority on 1 July 1954. According to Don Wright, students interpreted Autonomy Day as celebrating the autonomy of the University of Newcastle from the University of New South Wales. The students were entitled to give the celebration whatever meaning they chose. The fact that they called it ‘autonomy day’ heightened the students’ sense of the importance of autonomy and their need to defend it against outside interference.

=== Recent ===
In 1989, the Dawkins reforms amalgamated the Hunter Institute of Higher Education with the University of Newcastle. Newcastle Teachers College had been established in 1949 and was later renamed the Newcastle College of Advanced Education and finally the Hunter Institute of Higher Education as it had expanded its educational offerings beyond teacher education to nursing, other allied health professions, business, and fine arts. The Hunter Institute was located in a series of buildings on land immediately adjacent to the University at Callaghan and amalgamation expanded the campus to some 140 hectares. Under the reforms, the university also gained the Newcastle branch of the NSW Conservatorium of Music located in the city&#x27;s central business district.

Historically, the University of Newcastle Medical School has implemented the problem-based learning system for its undergraduate Bachelor of Medicine program – a system later mandated for use by the Australian Medical Council throughout Australia. It pioneered use of the Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test (UMAT) in the early 1990s. UMAT has since been accepted widely by different medical schools across Australia as an additional selection criteria.

In 1998, the university established a partnership with the Institut Wira, a Malaysian private business school. In 2002, Ian Firms, a lecturer, failed a large number of student papers from Wira for academic dishonesty, but his actions were reversed by the Newcastle administration and he was discharged. He then appealed to the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption, which made a finding of corruption against Dr. Paul Ryder, a failure by Vice Chancellor Roger Holmes in the execution of his duty and recommended disciplining the deputy vice chancellor, Professor Brian English.

In 2003, the University of Newcastle, together with five other Australian universities (Macquarie, La Trobe, Flinders, Griffith and Murdoch) established Innovative Research Universities Australia (IRUA).

Forty years after obtaining autonomy, the University of Newcastle has developed a reputable position in national and international university standings; ranked in the 10–14 range of the 38 universities in Australia by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University and 215th in the world by the &quot;Times Higher Education Supplement&quot; in 2007.

The university unveiled a new logo on 31 March 2007 as part of a brand refresh to align the university&#x27;s image more closely with its new strategic direction.

On 11 May 2007, the university launched a campus at the PSB Academy&#x27;s two main campuses in Singapore. On 30 July 2015, Tanzanian president Jakaya Kikwete was the first head of state to be awarded an honorary degree (Doctor of Laws) by the university.

== Campuses and buildings ==
The university offers online, face-to-face, or a mix of the two, with campuses at Callaghan, Ourimbah, Port Macquarie, Singapore and Sydney CBD. The university also has three premises within the Newcastle city centre.

=== Newcastle (Callaghan campus) ===
The Callaghan campus is the university&#x27;s main and largest campus. It is located in the Newcastle suburb of Callaghan situated approximately from Newcastle CBD. The campus is placed on of natural bushland within which the university&#x27;s numerous buildings are located. The land is traditionally owned by the Pambalong clan of the Awabakal people, a connection which has been developed by the university and is seen as a selling point for academics.

Many of the university&#x27;s operations are run out of the Callaghan campus, including student administration, course and degree program planning, and the university&#x27;s Teaching and Learning division. All the major colleges are based on the campus. The campus also has access to the Auchmuty and Huxley libraries. Various other facilities are available on the campus, including several sporting fields, a sports and aquatic centre, and five on-campus residential colleges (Edwards Hall, International House, Evatt House, Barahineban and the recently built New Residences). The business and commerce programs offered by Newcastle Business School via the Callaghan campus are accredited by AACSB International.

=== Central Coast (Ourimbah and Gosford campuses) ===
Ourimbah Campus is a cross-institutional campus, with the University of Newcastle, TAFE NSW – Hunter Institute, and the Central Coast Community College each having a presence. It is located in the Central Coast suburb of Ourimbah, on the traditional lands of the Darkinjung people. The Faculties of Business and Law, Education and Arts, Science, and Health each have a presence on the campus. In total, they provide sixteen undergraduate degree programs and one postgraduate program, five of which are exclusive to the campus. The Bachelor of Commerce program offered by Newcastle Business School via the Ourimbah campus is accredited by AACSB International.

=== Singapore campus ===
The Singapore campus is the university&#x27;s first overseas campus, which includes both the Delta campus and the Henderson campus of PSB Academy in the Central Region (Tiong Bahru) of Singapore. This new campus covers an area of behind the Tiong Bahru Plaza. The undergraduate Bachelor of Business and Bachelor of Commerce programs, and the Master of Business Administration offered by Newcastle Business School via the UoN Singapore campus are accredited by AACSB International.

=== Sydney CBD campus ===
The University of Newcastle Sydney CBD campus provides a number of postgraduate degree programs from the Faculty of Business and Law and the English Language and Foundation Studies Centre. The postgraduate programs offered by Newcastle Business School via the Sydney CBD campus are accredited by AACSB International.

=== Newcastle City campus ===

The university also has a presence on several sites within the Newcastle CBD. The School of Music and Conservatorium is located in the Civic Theatre precinct, the School of Law, Legal Centre, the School of Creative Industries and Graduate School of Business are located in University House, and the Newcastle Institute of Public Health is located in the David Maddison Building on the site of the Royal Newcastle Hospital. University House is a landmark Art Deco sandstone building directly opposite Civic Park.

In mid-2017 NUspace (X) opened to staff and students on the corner of Auckland and Hunter Streets, accommodating the Faculty of Business and Law and the School of Creative Industries. Designed by Lyons and EJE Architecture, the building was officially opened on 25 May 2018 by the Premier, the Hon Gladys Berejiklian, Minister for Education, the Hon Rob Stokes and the then university vice-chancellor, Caroline McMillen.

In February 2019, the university announced further plans to expand their presence in the CBD with the development of the Hunter Innovation Project (HIP) Innovation Hub for the School of Creative Industries on the site of the former Newcastle heavy rail corridor. The project is expected to be completed by late 2020. The HIP project is the first stage of a 10-year master plan which the university has proposed for the city.

=== Online learning ===
Until 2018, GradSchool was the University of Newcastle&#x27;s dedicated hub for postgraduate coursework students. From 2001 to 2018, GradSchool was responsible for online learning, offering graduate students from around the world convenient access to more than 60 postgraduate qualifications delivered by the University of Newcastle. Online interaction took place via &quot;Blackboard&quot;, a web-based learning system which hosted courses entirely online.

Since 2018, postgraduate degrees are now delivered directly by the University of Newcastle through their Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), known as UONline (including Blackboard), as well as through face-to-face teaching.

In 2022, the university switched from using Blackboard to using Canvas for online learning.

The Purai Global Indigenous History Centre is a university centre whose focus is &quot;integrating global and transnational analytical perspectives and frameworks with research on Indigenous and diaspora histories and other related histories of race&quot;. The word &quot;Purai&quot; is from the Awabakal language, and means &quot;the world&quot;, or &quot;earth&quot;. It is led by historian John Maynard. The centre was opened in March 2021, with the inaugural John Maynard Aboriginal history lecture given by Larissa Behrendt.

=== Libraries and databases ===

The University of Newcastle library is made up of three libraries across three campuses. They include the Auchmuty, Ourimbah, and Newcastle City campus libraries. The largest of these is the Auchmuty library on the Callaghan campus, which holds a significant traditional collection, including rare books and archives. Auchmuty holds a broad collection supporting a number of schools, including education, nursing, and fine arts. The Ourimbah library on the Central Coast campus holds a collection of both university and TAFE texts to facilitate the needs of the joint campus. An information common, similar to the one located in the Auchmuty library, is also available. The Newcastle City campus library is also part of The University of Newcastle library. In recent years the library has created interdisciplinary learning environments such as a Micro Studio for multimedia production and a Maker Space to engage students in creative problem solving.

The whole catalogue of the university library is available across any of its constituent libraries. The library is a member of the Council of Australian University Librarians. It also keeps New South Wales state archives that have been held by the university since 1975. The state archives reside within the University Archives, and consist of a collection of approximately 600 linear shelf metres.

== Student life ==

=== Student demographics ===
In 2019, the university had a total enrolment of 37,946 students, including over 7,000 international students from more than 113 countries.

The university is recognised for its commitment to equity in education, and consistently enrols more students of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background than any other Australian university. It has graduated more than 60% of the nation&#x27;s indigenous doctors. In addition to a high enrollment rate, the university&#x27;s retention rate for Indigenous students is also high at almost 80%. This is attributed to the work of the Wollotuka Institute.

=== Student union ===
From 2016 to 2020 students of the university were represented by three entities: The Newcastle University Students&#x27; Association (NUSA), Yourimbah, and Newcastle University Postgraduate Students&#x27; Association (NUPSA); In 2020 these entities ceased operations and combined to form a single student association known as University of Newcastle Student&#x27;s Association (UNSA).

UoN Services is responsible for the social life of the university, as well as most of the commercial facilities on campus. It organises all the main entertainment events, usually performed at the university&#x27;s two licensed venues, the Bar on the Hill and the Godfrey Tanner (GT) Bar. Apart from student contributions (which have dropped significantly since the abolition of universal student unionism), the UoN Services generates income from the stores, restaurants and bars on the Callaghan and city campuses. UoN Services also funds the production of Yak Media. Yak Media includes &quot;Yak Magazine&quot; and Yak TV (formerly UTV). &quot;Yak Magazine&quot; is a monthly publication run by an editorially independent student team. Yak TV is produced by a student media production team and reports on upcoming university events, gigs and services.

UNSA is primarily an advocacy organisation, representing undergraduate, postgraduate, and research students at all campuses on a variety of issues from political activism to the internal organisation of the university. UNSA also runs events and workshops, facilitates a portion of the student clubs, and produces &quot;Opus&quot;, the university&#x27;s magazine written by and for students.

Campus Central (Central Coast Campus Union Limited trading as Campus Central) is a single organisation looking after all the interests (commercial, sporting and advocacy) of students at the Ourimbah campus.

=== Sports and athletics ===
The university offers access to a number of sporting facilities across its campuses. The Callaghan campus has the majority of these facilities; this includes six sporting ovals, squash &amp; tennis courts, and a sports and aquatic centre. NUsport manages these facilities through an organisation known as &quot;The Forum&quot;. &quot;The Forum Sports &amp; Aquatic Centre, University&quot; boasts an olympic-sized swimming pool, the second highest climbing wall in the southern hemisphere and various other sporting facilities. It is also the site of training for sport teams including the Newcastle Knights from National Rugby League (NRL), the Newcastle Jets from the A-League and the Hunter Hurricanes National League Water Polo team. The Forum also has a centre near the Newcastle CBD known as &quot;The Forum, Health and Wellness centre, Harbourside&quot;.

=== Internship services ===

<text>Robert James Brown (born 27 December 1944) is an Australian former politician, medical doctor and environmentalist. He was a senator and the parliamentary leader of the Australian Greens. Brown was elected to the Australian Senate on the Tasmanian Greens ticket, joining with sitting Greens Western Australia senator Dee Margetts to form the first group of Australian Greens senators following the 1996 federal election. He was re-elected in 2001 and in 2007. He was the first openly gay member of the Parliament of Australia and the first openly gay leader of an Australian political party.

While serving in the Tasmanian parliament, Brown successfully campaigned for a large increase in the protected wilderness areas. Brown led the Australian Greens from the party&#x27;s foundation in 1992 until April 2012, a period in which polls grew to around 10% at state and federal levels (13.1% of the primary vote in 2010). From 2002 to 2004, when minor parties held the balance of power in the Senate, Brown became a well-recognised politician. In October 2003 Brown was the subject of international media interest when he was suspended from the parliament for interjecting during an address by United States president George W. Bush.

On 13 April 2012, Brown resigned as leader of the Greens and indicated his intention to resign from the Senate in June. This occurred on 15 June 2012.

==Early life and education==
Brown was born in Oberon, New South Wales, one of twins, and attended Trunkey Public School, Coffs Harbour High School (1957–60) and Blacktown Boys High School. In his senior year, he was elected school captain.

After finishing high school, Brown enrolled in medicine at University of Sydney, where he obtained a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery degree.

In his early 20s, Brown was inspired by the then-Prime Minister Robert Menzies, and nearly joined the Liberal Party of Australia.

==Pre-parliamentary career==
Brown practised medicine for a time at the Royal Canberra Hospital. During his tenure at the hospital, he and other senior medical staff took a pacifist stance by refusing to certify young men who did not wish to fight in the Vietnam War as fit to be conscripted. He then worked as a resident at Darwin and Alice Springs hospitals. At the latter post, he met John Hawkins, a surgeon who had kayaked rivers in Tasmania.

Brown travelled to London in 1970 and worked at Hounslow Cottage Hospital and St Mary Abbots Hospital in South Kensington. He was the resident doctor on duty at St Mary Abbots Hospital when Jimi Hendrix was brought in.

At the time of his retirement, many media outlets erroneously reported that he had pronounced Hendrix dead. Brown later clarified that, while he had been on duty when Hendrix was brought in, &quot;he had been dead for some hours&quot;, and Hendrix was officially pronounced dead by a different doctor—who was, coincidentally, also an Australian.

Brown moved to Tasmania in 1972 and worked as a general practitioner in Launceston. He soon became involved in the state&#x27;s environmental movement, in particular the campaign to save Lake Pedder. By 1972, he was a member of the newly formed United Tasmania Group, Australia&#x27;s first &quot;green&quot; party. For a period of two years during the 1970s, Brown served time as a member of a Thylacine search team.

In 1976, he fasted for a week on top of Mt Wellington in protest against the arrival at Hobart of the nuclear-powered warship .

==State politics==

In 1978 Brown was appointed director of the Tasmanian Wilderness Society. In the late 1970s he emerged as a leader of the campaign to prevent construction of the Franklin Dam, which would have flooded the Franklin River valley as part of a hydroelectricity project. Brown was among the 1500 people arrested while protesting during the campaign. He subsequently spent 19 days in Hobart&#x27;s Risdon Prison. On the day of his release in 1983, he became a member of Tasmania&#x27;s parliament for the House of Assembly seat of Denison after the Democrats MP Norm Sanders resigned to successfully stand for the Australian Senate; Brown was elected to replace him on a countback. The Franklin campaign was a success after Federal government intervention protected the Franklin River in 1983.

During his first term of office, Brown introduced a wide range of private member&#x27;s initiatives, which include freedom of information, death with dignity, lowering parliamentary salaries, gay law reform, banning the battery-hen industry and advocation for nuclear free Tasmania. His 1987 bill to ban semi-automatic guns was voted down by both Liberal and Labor members of Tasmania&#x27;s House of Assembly, nine years before the Port Arthur massacre resulted in a successful federal Liberal bid to achieve the same results.

In 1989 Tasmania&#x27;s system of proportional representation allowed the Greens to win five out of 35 seats in the Tasmanian House of Assembly and Brown became their leader. He agreed to support a minority Labor Party government, on the basis of a negotiated Accord (signed by Michael Field and Bob Brown) in which the Green independents agreed to support the budget but not motions of no confidence, and the ALP agreed to develop a more open parliamentary process, to consult on departmental appointments, provide a legislative research service, parity in parliamentary staffing and a reform agenda which included equal opportunities, freedom of information, national parks protection and public disclosure of bulk power contracts and royalties from mining companies. This agreement, however, broke down over forestry issues in 1992. In 1993 Brown resigned from the House of Assembly and stood unsuccessfully for the federal House of Representatives.

During 1990–1991 Brown advocated for a merger of the Green Independents with the Australian Democrats to form the &quot;Green Democrats&quot;, as opposed to confederating with other Green Parties and forming the Australian Greens. However, following a change in leadership in the Democrats, this plan could not continue and the Independents aligned themselves towards a unified Green Party.

==Federal politics==


Brown was elected to the Australian Senate for Tasmania in 1996, and was an outspoken voice in opposition to the conservative government of John Howard, and in support of green and human rights issues, including international issues such as Tibet, East Timor and West Papua. He also introduced bills for constitutional reform, forest protection, to block radioactive waste dumping, to ban mandatory sentencing of Aboriginal children, to prohibit the use of cluster munitions and for greenhouse abatement.

At the 2001 federal election Brown was re-elected to the Senate with a greatly increased vote, and was outspoken on Prime Minister John Howard&#x27;s refusal to allow 438 asylum seekers (mostly from Afghanistan) to land on Christmas Island after they had been rescued from their sinking boat in the Indian Ocean by the MV Tampa, a Norwegian freighter. Brown was equally critical of Opposition Leader Kim Beazley&#x27;s acquiescence to John Howard&#x27;s stance on the Tampa incident.

Brown was particularly vocal in his opposition to Australian participation in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and became recognised as a leading voice for the anti-war/peace movement. When President Bush visited Canberra on 23 October 2003, Brown and fellow senator Kerry Nettle interjected during his address to a joint sitting of the two houses of parliament. During Bush&#x27;s speech Brown and Nettle wore signs referring to David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib, two Australian citizens held at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, at that time (Habib was later released without charge and Hicks served a prison term for providing material support for terrorism), following their apprehension by United States forces in Afghanistan and Pakistan respectively. Bush accepted the interjections with good humour but the Speaker of the House, Neil Andrew formally &quot;named&quot; Brown and Nettle. This meant that they were both suspended from the Parliament for 24 hours which prevented them from being present during a similar address from Chinese President Hu Jintao the next day. After the speech, however, Brown shook Bush&#x27;s hand.

Brown opposed the Howard Government&#x27;s amendments to the Marriage Act in 2004, stating that &quot;Mr Howard should relax and accept gay marriages as part of the future&#x27;s social fabric&quot;.

In December 2004, forestry and export woodchip company Gunns Limited attempted to sue Brown and others for $6.3 million, in an action which media reports say related to &quot;ongoing damaging campaigns and activities&quot; against the company. The original Statement of Claim issued by Gunns was struck out by the Supreme Court and costs were awarded against Gunns for the initial proceedings. Gunns ultimately failed with the company finally dropping all claims against Brown on 13 December 2006 while continuing its case against others including The Wilderness Society.

Brown was formally elected as the first Federal Parliamentary Leader of The Greens on 28 November 2005, following almost a decade of service as de facto leader since his election to the Senate in 1996.

In February 2007, the Tasmanian State Government and the Australian Federal Government responded by changing the text of the State&#x27;s Regional Forest Agreement. New clauses make it clear that the word &#x27;protection&#x27; relates only to whether the two respective governments deem a species to be protected rather than the meaning of the word being based on actual evidence of such.

In early 2007, Brown attracted scorn from sections of the media and the major political parties for his proposal to commit to a plan within three years, that would eventually see the banning of coal exports. Brown described coal exports as the &quot;energy industry&#x27;s heroin habit&quot; and stated that the export of alternative technologies should be the priority.

Brown was re-elected in the 2007 federal election. He announced his intention to stand again at the Greens National Conference in November 2005.

Following his re-election and that of the new Labor Government, Brown called on the new Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, to set fixed carbon targets immediately, and to announce their levels at the upcoming United Nations Bali Climate Change Conference in December 2007, continuing his climate campaigning, and saying that it was &quot;obvious&quot; what the outcome would be if Australia was to not set carbon emissions goals.

In 2005, Brown brought a legal case against Forestry Tasmania in the Federal Court, in an attempt to protect Tasmania&#x27;s Wielangta forest from clearfell logging. The 1997 Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) exempted logging operations from endangered species laws but required the protection of endangered species. Bob Brown brought a case against Forestry Tasmania citing threats to endangered species like the Swift parrot and Wielangta Stag Beetle. In December 2006, Judge Shane Marshall awarded the case in Brown&#x27;s favour. On appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court level, the case was lost, without rejecting the earlier judgement that logging would further endanger these species. In May 2008 the High Court denied leave to appeal that decision after the wording of the RFA was changed.

Brown was ordered to pay $240,000 to Forestry Tasmania, which he said he could not afford to pay. Failure to pay would have resulted in bankruptcy proceedings which would have cost Brown his Senate seat. Brown had earlier rejected a settlement offer from Forestry Tasmania that would have required him to have only paid $200,000 of the costs he had incurred. On 9 June 2009, Australian entrepreneur Dick Smith promised to help bail him out if necessary, an offer that was not needed after pledges of support from over 1,000 donors covered Brown&#x27;s legal bill within a few days of his announcement.

In 2011, after the 2010–11 Queensland floods Brown drew criticism for suggesting that half the Mineral Resource Rent Tax be allocated to future natural catastrophes. He made comments to the effect that climate change, specifically the impact on climate from the mining sector should be held at least partially responsible for the flooding.

In 2011, Brown supported the 2011 military intervention in Libya.

On 24 March 2012, at the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Tasmanian Greens, Brown warned about degradation of the Earth and the impact that could have on future generations. He postulated that other civilisations in the universe are: not communicating with Earth. They have themselves. They have come and gone. And now it&#x27;s our turn. As a possible approach to pre-empting this he proposed a Global Parliament. He was met with a standing ovation. The then deputy leader Christine Milne said it was &quot;a very inspiring speech&quot;. There was criticism of his approach. At the Global Greens Conference in Dakar, Senegal Africa, 1 April 2012, Bob Brown advocated that there be established a &quot;global parliament&quot; where &quot;every citizen should have an equal say&quot;. The final resolution supported by the Australian Greens and others, was passed.

===Resignation from Greens leadership===
On 13 April 2012, Brown resigned as leader of the Greens and announced that he would be resigning from the Senate in June when his replacement was available. His deputy, Christine Milne, became Greens leader, and federal Melbourne MP Adam Bandt became Greens deputy leader. Peter Whish-Wilson, who had formerly stood for the Greens, was selected as Brown&#x27;s replacement in the Senate.

Brown&#x27;s resignation took place on 15 June 2012 at 3:30 pm, when he handed his resignation to the senate president, John Hogg. Peter Whish-Wilson was sworn into the Senate on 21 June.

Brown was the founder, in 1990, of the Australian Bush Heritage Fund, now Bush Heritage Australia, a non-profit environmental organisation dedicated to purchasing and preserving Australian bushland. He was president of the organisation until 1996. On 20 March 2011 Brown donated a 14-hectare (35-acre) property and house he had owned for 38 years to Bush Heritage Australia. The property is located 47 kilometres (29 miles) south-west of Launceston, Tasmania, in the Liffey Valley. According to Australian Geographic, it is a site of historic and symbolic significance.

==Bob Brown Foundation==
Brown set up the Bob Brown Foundation with his longtime partner Paul Thomas to promote environmental awareness. The foundation established a set of awards in 2012, with South Australian climate activist Daniel Spencer the recipient of the inaugural Young Environmentalist of the Year award, and Tasmanian forest activist Jenny Weber was inaugural Environmentalist of the Year, which came with a prize of . It has also given awards to other Australian environmentalists, including Miranda Gibson and Drew Hutton. 

==Other activities==
Brown is a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which advocates for democratic reformation of the United Nations.

Brown was a speaker at the Save the Kimberley concert, held on 5 October 2012. Held at Federation Square in Melbourne, the concert was part of a long-running campaign to protest against a proposal to industrialise the James Price Point area in Broome, Western Australia. Brown had also addressed a rally on 2 September 2012 in Sydney, Australia. Brown appeared at another concert in support of the Kimberley cause on 24 February 2013, with musicians Missy Higgins and John Butler also appearing, with the event held at The Esplanade in Fremantle, Western Australia. Jarrah Records, the record label that Butler co-founded with musical trio The Waifs and band manager Phil Stevens, worked in partnership with The Wilderness Society to stage the free event that also featured the band Ball Park Music. A march to protest the proposed gas refinery construction at James Price Point accompanied the free concert and campaign supporters were photographed with banners and placards.

On 8 January 2013, it was announced that Brown would be taking over as director of the Australian chapter of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a non-profit, marine conservation organisation. He stepped down in April 2014.

In January 2016, Brown was arrested after refusing to leave the Lapoinya Forest in Tasmania, where preparations for logging were under way. Along with another protester, who had been arrested a few days earlier, he was charged with an offence under Tasmania&#x27;s Workplaces (Protection from Protesters) Act 2014. Although the charges were dropped, the two went to the High Court to argue that the provisions under which they had been charged were unconstitutional. In October 2017 the High Court agreed, by a majority although for differing reasons, that the provisions were invalid in that they breached the constitutional freedom of political communication.

In August 2016, Brown joined the crew of &quot;Sea Shepherd&quot; on board their ship &quot;Steve Irwin&quot;, as it joined the campaign against proposed drilling in the Great Australian Bight.

In April 2019 Brown led a convoy of vehicles to protest against the proposed Carmichael coal mine.

In July 2019 Brown came out strongly opposing a large wind farm to be set up in Northern Tasmania, raising concern for bird species.

==Recognition and awards==
In July 2012, Brown was inducted into the Hall of Fame at Coffs Harbour High School, where he had spent a significant part of his secondary school years.

Brown has received the following awards:

* Australian Humanist of the Year (2010)

==Personal life==
In a newspaper interview in 1976, Brown announced that he had a same-sex partner to highlight discrimination and encourage law reform because homosexual activity in Tasmania remained a crime until 1997.

 Brown lived in Eggs and Bacon Bay, Tasmania, with his long-time partner, Paul Thomas, a farmer and activist whom he met in 1996.

Brown describes himself as a &quot;lapsed Presbyterian&quot;.

In an interview with Richard Fidler on ABC radio, Nigel Brennan, an Australian photojournalist who was kidnapped in Somalia and held hostage for 462 days, revealed Brown had contributed $100,000 of his own money to help pay the ransom for his release. It was also revealed that Brown contacted Australian businessman Dick Smith asking that he also contribute funds towards the release of Brennan. Brennan, who was released in November 2009, also stated in this interview that Brown had to borrow this money, an assertion also made in various media outlets at the time of Brennan&#x27;s release.

==Publications==
Brown has published several books including &quot;Wild Rivers&quot; (1983), &quot;Lake Pedder&quot; (1986), &quot;Tarkine Trails&quot; (1994), &quot;The Greens&quot; (1996) (with Peter Singer), &quot;Memo for a Saner World&quot; (2004), &quot;Valley of the Giants&quot; (2004), &quot;Tasmania&#x27;s Recherche Bay&quot; (2005), &quot;Earth&quot; (2009), &quot;In Balfour Street&quot; (2010) and &quot;Optimism: reflections on a life of action&quot; (2014).

<text>Noir Désir (, &quot;Black Desire&quot;) was a French rock band from Bordeaux. They were active during the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, and have had two albums certified double platinum in France and three certified gold. They have been an influence on numerous French musicians including Cali, Louise Attaque and Miossec. While active, the band consisted of Bertrand Cantat (vocals, guitar), Serge Teyssot-Gay (guitar), Jean-Paul Roy (bass guitar) and Denis Barthe (drums).

==History==

===Formation: 1980–1985===
Bertrand Cantat and Serge Teyssot-Gay met in 1980 at secondary school after Cantat moved to Bordeaux from Normandy; Teyssot-Gay was 17 years old and Cantat 16. The two teenagers shared a love of music, particularly Led Zeppelin and the Who, so they decided to form a band. Teyssot-Gay had a strong musical background and a decade&#x27;s worth of training in classical guitar; Cantat, who could not play any instrument at the time, became the singer. While on summer vacation they met Denis Barthe, who shared their passion for music and agreed to play drums for the band, though he had never played them before and learned on the fly.

They went through a series of temporary bassists, eventually settling on Vincent Leriche. The band originally called themselves &quot;Psychoz&quot;, then &quot;6.35&quot;, &quot;Station Désir&quot; and finally &quot;Noirs Désirs&quot; (to be changed later to Noir Désir). In 1982 Teyssot-Gay and Leriche left the group to form BAM (Boîte A Musique). The remaining band members, Barthe and Cantat, went in search of a replacement guitarist and bassist. For bass they found Frédéric Vidalenc, who had played in the well-known local group Dernier Métro, and eventually they settled on Luc Robène for guitar. (The following year Cantat also left the band temporarily, being replaced during his six-month absence by Emmanuel Ory-Weil, who later became the band&#x27;s manager.) When Robène quit in 1985 Cantat succeeded in getting their original guitarist, Teyssot-Gay, back into the band. The new lineup of Cantat on vocals, Teyssot-Gay on guitar, Vidalenc on bass and Barthe on drums continued for 11 more years.

===Early albums: 1985–1991===
Now with a new and finally solid lineup the band decided to make an attempt at getting a recording contract. They created a demo which was heard by Théo Hakola of the American band Passion Fodder. Hakola urged the French label Barclay Records to sign the band, and the label&#x27;s artistic director agreed to see the band in concert first. At first the label wanted the band to produce a single, but after two months of negotiations it was agreed that a mini-album would be made instead. The label did not expect much success, the director commenting &quot;If we sell 1,500 copies of your disk, that will already be very good&quot; (Si on vend 1 500 exemplaires de votre disque, ce sera déjà très bien). The label disliked the name Noirs Désirs, feeling it to be old fashioned, so the band agreed to drop two letters, unpluralizing the name to Noir Désir. In 1987 they released the mini-album, &quot;Où veux tu qu&#x27;je r&#x27;garde?&quot;. After two months it had sold 5,000 copies, exceeding the expectations of Barclay, who signed the band for another three albums.

Their first critical and popular success came two years later in 1989, with their next album, &quot;Veuillez rendre l&#x27;âme (à qui elle appartient)&quot;. The album won Noir Désir the Bus d&#x27;Acier for 1989, an award given by the press to the best French rock group of the year. It was certified gold, selling over 150,000 copies, and became recognised as one of the best French rock albums ever made. It also produced the hit single: &quot;Aux sombres héros de l&#x27;amer&quot;, a sea-shanty-like harmonica-driven ballad that uses the concept of sailors lost at sea as a metaphor for life. However the group were dismayed that many people had missed this double meaning of the song, interpreting it as a meaningless sea shanty. They were also disappointed that many people judged them based on the one song, without listening to the rest of the album. In their next two albums the band would return to the harder sound of &quot;Où veux-tu qu&#x27;je r&#x27;garde ?&quot; and develop it even further. This development was largely a reaction to their worries about the success of the single &quot;Aux sombres héros de l&#x27;amer&quot;.

===Post-success: 1991–2001===

With its harder and more aggressive sound and an almost complete lack of promotion, the third album &quot;Du ciment sous les plaines&quot; (1991) received lacklustre reviews compared to &quot;Veuillez rendre l&#x27;âme (à qui elle appartient)&quot; and no singles were released from it. In May 1991, a concert in Besançon was cut short after four songs when Bertrand Cantat collapsed on stage. As a result, the band took a break from touring until the release of their next album, &quot;Tostaky&quot;.

&quot;Tostaky&quot; was produced in London, a city the group admired for its musical output. Unlike , &quot;Tostaky&quot; was released to much acclaim and popular success and was certified gold a few days after its release. In August 1993, &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; heralded Noir Désir as France&#x27;s &quot;leading entry in the grunge wave.&quot; In January 1994, the live album &quot;Dies Irae&quot; was released, showcasing the frenzy of the band&#x27;s performances. However the touring took its toll on Cantat, who eventually ended up in hospital for an operation on his vocal cords. After this gruelling tour the band decided to take a year&#x27;s break, both from playing and from each other. During their break Bertrand Cantat received professional voice training and bass-player Frédéric Vidalenc quit the group to pursue his own projects; he was replaced by a longtime friend of the band, Jean-Paul Roy. Serge Teyssot-Gay used his spare time during the break to record a solo album, &quot;Silence Radio&quot;, which would be finished and released in 1996.

In December 1996 the success of &quot;Tostaky&quot; was continued with the release of &quot;666.667 Club&quot;, which would be certified double platinum a year after its release. In 1998, after receiving a remix of their song &quot;&quot; in the mail, they decided to produce the album which comprised a collection of their songs remixed by young musicians.

===Des visages des figures: 2001–2003===
Their most recent studio album, 2001&#x27;s &quot;Des visages des figures&quot; was much quieter than any of their previous albums, but was very well received, selling over 1 million copies. The group received five Victoires de la Musique award nominations for 2001, winning both Best Rock Album of the Year and Music Video of the Year for &quot;Le vent nous portera&quot; in collaboration with the French/Spanish artist Manu Chao. During the awards ceremony Cantat read out a speech on behalf of the band, addressed to Jean-Marie Messier, the CEO of Vivendi, the group that owns Noir Désir&#x27;s record company, Universal. Messier was a controversial figure in France at the time, due to the perception that he was abandoning his French roots in favour of Americanization. In their speech, Noir Désir accused Vivendi of exploiting their band&#x27;s name in order to rebut criticism of Messier&#x27;s treatment of French culture. The band played few concerts for their &quot;Des visages des figures&quot; tour, but all were held in large stadium-like venues except for the Middle East tour, where the band was able to go back to their roots playing in small clubs. They were invited to perform a one-off concert at the “Montpellier Radio-France” festival in 2002. For the 55 minute performance, titled &quot;Nous n&#x27;avons fait que fuir&quot;, Cantat recited a long-form poem he&#x27;d written over musical improvisations played by the rest of the band. The text of the poem along with a recording of the performance on CD was released by French book publisher Éditions Verticales.

===Incarceration of Bertrand Cantat: 2003–2007===
In 2003, following an argument about infidelity, Bertrand Cantat, drunk at the time, severely beat his girlfriend, the French actress Marie Trintignant, in a hotel room in Vilnius, Lithuania. The following morning Marie Trintignant was found in a coma in her bed and died a few days later. A post mortem examination showed that she had suffered multiple head injuries. Cantat admitted to hitting her four times; prosecutors argued that it was in fact 19 times in all. He later alleged she had fallen and hit her head on a radiator, and that this impact, not his blows, rendered her unconscious. On 29 March 2004, a Lithuanian court sentenced Cantat to eight years in prison after he was found guilty of manslaughter. After one year spent in Lukiškės prison of Vilnius, he was moved to a prison near Toulouse, France, and was released on parole in October 2007 after serving half his sentence. A condition of Cantat&#x27;s release was that he must receive regular psychological counseling and refrain from public reference to his crime in interviews or in music. In July 2010, the conditional status of Cantat&#x27;s release was lifted and he was declared as having completely served his sentence.

===Return: 2005–2010===
September 2005 brought two new releases of Noir Désir&#x27;s work. The album, &quot;Noir Désir en public&quot;, which had been started before the incident in Vilnius, contained highlights of their last tour, during which every concert had been recorded. The DVD set, &quot;Noir Désir en images&quot;, contained various live performances footage and videos. Special permission was obtained for the imprisoned Cantat to participate in the development of both the CD and the DVD.

In November 2008, the band released two free tracks on their website, performed by the whole band. The songs are &quot;Gagnants / Perdants (Bonne nuit les petits)&quot; and a cover of &quot;Le Temps des cerises&quot;.
The group was in the process of composing and recording a new album, which Teyssot-Gay had predicted would be completed in 2009. However, according to a 14 May 2009 article in Le Parisien the album would not be ready until January 2010.

On 29 November 2010, it was announced that guitarist Serge Teyssot-Gay was leaving the band citing &quot;emotional, human and musical differences&quot; with lead singer Cantat.

On 30 November 2010, the band&#x27;s drummer Denis Barthe announced that Noir Désir is &quot;disbanded for good&quot; adding that it is useless to let the band live with &quot;artificial respiration&quot;.

===Acoustic and New song: 2020===
On 24 January 2020, Noir Désir released an Acoustic/Live album, &quot;&quot; &quot;Débranché&quot;, with 11 songs on it of live recordings from, Live á Radio Popolare, Milan 2002 and Live á Much Electric, Buenos Aires 1997.
On 30 October 2020, the band released a new single, Imbécile.

<doc id="347747" wikidata="Q3974" url="?curid=347747" title="Landshut">
<text>Landshut (; ) is a town in Bavaria in the south-east of Germany. Situated on the banks of the River Isar, Landshut is the capital of Lower Bavaria, one of the seven administrative regions of the Free State of Bavaria. It is also the seat of the surrounding district and has a population of more than 75,000. Landshut is the largest city in Lower Bavaria, followed by Passau and Straubing, and Eastern Bavaria&#x27;s second after Regensburg.

Owing to its characteristic coat of arms, the town is also called &quot;City of the three Helmets&quot; (). The town is popularly known for is picturesque gothic old town and the Landshut Wedding, a full-tilt medieval festival. The cityscape is dominated by the St. Martin&#x27;s Basilica and Trausnitz Castle high above the old town.

Due to its proximity and easy access to Munich and the Franz Josef Strauss International Airport, Landshut became a powerful and future-oriented investment area and has seen a strong increase in population in the last 20 years. The town is strongly industrialized (e.g. BMW, ebm-papst, Schott electronics), has Eastern Bavaria&#x27;s lowest unemployment rate and is among the richest towns in Bavaria.

== Geography ==
Landshut lies in the Alpine foothills. The River Isar runs through the city and splits in two in the city centre. Most of the built-up area lies on the flat terraced deposits of the river. The Isar divides the town into three areas: the northern part above the river belongs to the Isar-Danube hill country, the Mühleninsel in the city centre lies between both arms of the Isar, and the southern part below the river belongs to the Isar-Inn hill country. The southern part of the town is delimited by a chain of hills, some of which rise steeply, of which the Hofberg, where the Trausnitz Castle is located, forms the highest point in the city area at a height of 505 meters above sea level.

Landshut is situated between Munich (70 kilometers southwest) and Regensburg (70 kilometers to the north). Other nearby towns are Straubing (75 km northeast), Deggendorf (75 km to the east), and Passau at the German-Austrian border (120 km to the east). The town&#x27;s spread is limited to the north by Ergolding, to the northwest by Altdorf, and to the south by Kumhausen. The three smaller towns join Landshut to form a built-up area of around 100,000 people but are not incorporated into Landshut proper.

==History==
The town and Trausnitz Castle were founded in 1204 by Duke Louis I, when a settlement developed around the castle. Landshut was a Wittelsbach residence by 1231, and in 1255, when the duchy of Bavaria was split in two, Landshut also became the capital of Lower Bavaria. Duke Henry XVI was the first of the three &#x27;rich dukes&#x27; who ruled Bayern-Landshut in the 15th century. The wedding of Duke George with the Polish Princess Royal Jadwiga Jagiellon in 1475 was celebrated in Landshut with one of the most splendid festivals of the Middle Ages (Landshut Wedding). After his death and the Landshut War of Succession, Bavaria-Landshut was reunited with Bavaria-Munich.

Between 1537 and 1543, after his visit to Italy, Louis X, Duke of Bavaria built the Landshut Residence, the first Renaissance palace constructed north of the Alps. It was modeled after Palazzo Te in Mantua. William V, Duke of Bavaria ordered to upgrade Trausnitz Castle from a gothic fortification into a Renaissance complex when he lived in Landshut as crown prince for ten years until 1579. Afterwards, Landshut lost most of its importance until the University of Ingolstadt was moved to Landshut in 1800. However, in 1826 the university was transferred to Munich.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the city was thrice (1632, 1634 and 1648) taken and plundered by Swedish forces.

Napoleon fought and won the Battle of Landshut in 1809 against an Austrian army as part of the War of the Fifth Coalition.

During World War II, a subcamp of Dachau concentration camp was located in the city to provide slave labour for local industry. The city was taken by US troops on 29 April 1945.

The U.S. Army maintained facilities in Landshut, including Pinder Kaserne and a dependent housing area, until 1968.

Since the opening of Munich Airport close to Landshut in 1992, the town has become an attractive business location.

==Main sights and culture==

The town is of architectural importance because of its predominantly Gothic architecture within the historic town centre, especially &quot;Trausnitz Castle&quot; and the &quot;Church of Saint Martin&quot; featuring the world&#x27;s tallest church brick tower. Among other Gothic architecture are the churches of St. Jodok and Holy Spirit, but also the Town Hall and the &quot;Ländtor&quot;, the only still existing gate of the medieval fortification.

Landshut is known for a festival celebrated every four years called the Landshuter Hochzeit, commemorating the 1475 marriage of George of Bavaria and Jadwiga Jagiellon.

The Renaissance era produced in particular the decorated inner courtyard of the &quot;Trausnitz Castle&quot; and the ducal &quot;Landshut Residence&quot; in the inner town. Baroque churches are represented by the Jesuit church &quot;St. Ignatius&quot;, the Dominican church &quot;St. Blasius&quot; and the church &quot;St. Joseph&quot;. Also, the medieval churches of the Seligenthal convent and of the Cistercians were redesigned in baroque style. Many old middle-class houses of the past in the Old Town still represent the history of the town from the Gothic times to the Neo-Classicism.

==Transportation==
There are regular regional train connections to Munich, Prague, Regensburg, Munich Airport, Passau, Salzburg, Rosenheim, Nuremberg and Hof.

==Sport==
The most successful professional team in the city is ice hockey team EV Landshut, playing currently in the Second Division.

The other professional team in the city is motorcycle speedway team Landshut Devils, who are based at the Ellermühle Speedway Stadium.

The local association football team is SpVgg Landshut with both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams previously having reached the top state division.

Bank of America is one of the Big Four banking institutions of the United States. and one of eight systemically important financial institutions in the U.S. It serves about 10 percent of all American bank deposits, in direct competition with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo. Its primary financial services revolve around commercial banking, wealth management, and investment banking.
Through mergers, the oldest branch of the Bank of America franchise can be traced to 1784, when Massachusetts Bank was chartered, the first federally chartered joint-stock owned bank in the United States. Another branch of its history goes back to the U.S.-based Bank of Italy, founded by Amadeo Pietro Giannini in 1904, which provided various banking options to Italian immigrants who faced service discrimination. Headquartered in San Francisco, California, Giannini acquired Banca d&#x27;America e d&#x27;Italia, in 1922 and eventually did business as Bank of America.

In the 1950s, passage of landmark federal banking legislation facilitated rapid growth, quickly establishing prominent shares for the present bank&#x27;s predecessors. After suffering a significant loss after the 1998 Russian bond default, BankAmerica, as it was then known, was acquired by the Charlotte-based NationsBank for US$62 billion. Following what was then the largest bank acquisition in history, the Bank of America Corporation was founded. Through a series of mergers and acquisitions, it built upon its commercial banking business by establishing Merrill Lynch for wealth management and Bank of America Merrill Lynch for investment banking in 2008 and 2009, respectively, and since renamed BofA Securities.

Both Bank of America and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management retain large market shares in their respective offerings. The investment bank is considered within the &quot;Bulge Bracket&quot; as the third largest investment bank in the world, . Its wealth management side manages US$1.081 trillion in assets under management (AUM) as the second largest wealth manager in the world, after UBS. In commercial banking, Bank of America has operations, but does not necessarily maintain retail branches in all 50 states of the United States, Washington, D.C., and over 40 other countries. Its commercial banking footprint encapsulates 46 million consumer and small business relationships at 4,600 banking centers and 16,000 automated teller machines (ATMs).

The bank&#x27;s large market share, business activities, and economic impact has led to numerous lawsuits and investigations regarding both mortgages and financial disclosures dating back to the 2008 financial crisis. Its corporate practices of servicing the middle class and wider banking community have yielded a substantial market share since the early 20th century. , Bank of America has a $313.5 billion market capitalization, making it the 13th largest company in the world. As the sixth largest American public company, it garnered $102.98 billion in sales . Bank of America was ranked No. 25 on the 2020 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest US corporations by total revenue. Likewise, Bank of America was also ranked No. 6 on the 2023 Global 2000 rankings done by Forbes. Bank of America was named the &quot;World&#x27;s Best Bank&quot; by the &quot;Euromoney Institutional Investor&quot; in its 2018 Awards for Excellence.

==History==
Bank of America, Los Angeles was founded in California in 1923. In 1928, this entity was acquired by Bank of Italy of San Francisco, which took the Bank of America name two years later.

The eastern portion of the Bank of America franchise can be traced to 1784, when Massachusetts Bank was chartered, the first federally chartered joint-stock owned bank in the United States and only the second bank to receive a charter in the United States. This bank became FleetBoston, with which Bank of America merged in 2004. In 1874, Commercial National Bank was founded in Charlotte. That bank merged with American Trust Company in 1958 to form American Commercial Bank. Two years later it became North Carolina National Bank when it merged with Security National Bank of Greensboro. In 1991, it merged with C&amp;S/Sovran Corporation of Atlanta and Norfolk to form NationsBank.

The central portion of the franchise dates to 1910, when Commercial National Bank and Continental National Bank of Chicago merged in 1910 to form Continental &amp; Commercial National Bank, which evolved into Continental Illinois National Bank &amp; Trust.

===Bank of America===
The history of Bank of America dates back to October 17, 1904, when Amadeo Pietro Giannini (1870–1949) founded the Bank of Italy, in San Francisco. In 1922, Bank of America, Los Angeles was established with Giannini as a minority investor. The two banks merged in 1928 and consolidated with other bank holdings to create what would become the largest banking institution in the country.

In 1918, another corporation, Bancitaly Corporation, was organized by A. P. Giannini, the largest stockholder of which was Stockholders Auxiliary Corporation. This company acquired the stocks of various banks located in New York City and certain foreign countries.

In 1928, Giannini merged his bank with Bank of America, Los Angeles, headed by Orra E. Monnette. Bank of Italy was renamed on November 3, 1930, to Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association, which was the only such designated bank in the United States at that time. Giannini and Monnette headed the resulting company, serving as co-chairs.

===Expansion in California===

Giannini introduced branch banking shortly after 1909 legislation in California allowed for branch banking in the state, establishing the bank&#x27;s first branch outside San Francisco in 1909 in San Jose. By 1929 the bank had 453 banking offices in California with aggregate resources of over US$1.4 billion. There is a replica of the 1909 Bank of Italy branch bank in History Park in San Jose, and the 1925 Bank of Italy Building is an important downtown landmark. Giannini sought to build a national bank, expanding into most of the western states as well as into the insurance industry, under the aegis of his holding company, Transamerica Corporation.

In 1953 regulators succeeded in forcing the separation of Transamerica Corporation and Bank of America under the Clayton Antitrust Act. The passage of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 prohibited banks from owning non-banking subsidiaries such as insurance companies. Bank of America and Transamerica were separated, with the latter company continuing in the insurance sector. However, federal banking regulators prohibited Bank of America&#x27;s interstate banking activity, and Bank of America&#x27;s domestic banks outside California were forced into a separate company that eventually became First Interstate Bancorp, later acquired by Wells Fargo and Company in 1996. Only in the 1980s, with a change in federal banking legislation and regulation, could Bank of America again expand its domestic consumer banking activity outside California.

New technologies also allowed the direct linking of credit cards with individual bank accounts. In 1958, the bank introduced the BankAmericard, which changed its name to Visa in 1977. A coalition of regional bankcard associations introduced Interbank in 1966 to compete with BankAmericard. Interbank became Master Charge in 1966 and then Mastercard in 1979.

From February 1970 through September 1971, there were 66 attacks on Bank of America branches in California, including 53 bombings or fire-bombings, and 13 arson fires. There were &quot;few injuries&quot; and the property damage cost about $500,000, 80% of which was from the burning of the Isla Vista branch during a February 1970 riot.

===Expansion outside California===
Following passage of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 by the U.S. Congress, BankAmerica Corporation was established for the purpose of owning and operating Bank of America and its subsidiaries.

In 1983, Bank of America expanded outside California, through acquisition, orchestrated in part by Stephen McLin of Seafirst Corporation in Seattle, and its wholly owned banking subsidiary, Seattle-First National Bank. Seafirst was at risk of seizure by the federal government after becoming insolvent due to a series of bad loans to the oil industry. BankAmerica continued to operate its new subsidiary as Seafirst rather than Bank of America until the 1998 merger with NationsBank.

BankAmerica experienced huge losses in 1986 and 1987 due to the placement of a series of bad loans in the Third World. The company fired its CEO, Sam Armacost, in 1986. Though Armacost blamed the problems on his predecessor, A. W. (Tom) Clausen, Clausen was appointed to replace Armacost. The losses resulted in a huge decline of BankAmerica stock, making it vulnerable to a hostile takeover. First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles (which had originated from banks once owned by BankAmerica), launched such a bid in the fall of 1986, although BankAmerica rebuffed it, mostly by selling operations. It sold its FinanceAmerica subsidiary to Chrysler and the brokerage firm Charles Schwab and Co. back to Mr. Schwab. It also sold Bank of America and Italy to Deutsche Bank. By the time of the 1987 stock-market crash, BankAmerica&#x27;s share price had fallen to $8, but by 1992 it had rebounded mightily to become one of the biggest gainers of that half-decade.

BankAmerica&#x27;s next big acquisition came in 1992. The company acquired Security Pacific Corporation and its subsidiary Security Pacific National Bank in California and other banks in Arizona, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, which Security Pacific had acquired in a series of acquisitions in the late 1980s. This represented, at the time, the largest bank acquisition in history. Federal regulators, however, forced the sale of roughly half of Security Pacific&#x27;s Washington subsidiary, the former Rainier Bank, as the combination of Seafirst and Security Pacific Washington would have given BankAmerica too large a share of the market in that state. The Washington branches were divided and sold to West One Bancorp (now U.S. Bancorp) and KeyBank. Later that year, BankAmerica expanded into Nevada by acquiring Valley Bank of Nevada.

In 1994, BankAmerica acquired the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co. of Chicago. At the time, no bank possessed the resources to bail out Continental, so the federal government operated the bank for nearly a decade. Illinois then regulated branch banking extremely heavily, so Bank of America Illinois was a single-unit bank until the 21st century. BankAmerica moved its national lending department to Chicago in an effort to establish a financial beachhead in the region.

These mergers helped BankAmerica Corporation to once again become the largest U.S. bank holding company in terms of deposits, but the company fell to second place in 1997 behind North Carolina&#x27;s fast-growing NationsBank Corporation, and to third in 1998 behind First Union Corp.

On the capital markets side, the acquisition of Continental Illinois helped BankAmerica to build a leveraged finance origination- and distribution business, which allowed the firm&#x27;s existing broker-dealer, BancAmerica Securities (originally named BA Securities), to become a full-service franchise. In addition, in 1997, BankAmerica acquired Robertson Stephens, a San Francisco–based investment bank specializing in high technology for $540 million. Robertson Stephens was integrated into BancAmerica Securities, and the combined subsidiary was renamed &quot;BancAmerica Robertson Stephens&quot;.

===Merger of NationsBank and BankAmerica===

In 1997, BankAmerica lent investment management firm D. E. Shaw &amp; Co. $1.4 billion to run various businesses for the bank. However, D.E. Shaw suffered significant loss after the 1998 Russia bond default. NationsBank of Charlotte acquired BankAmerica in 1998 in what was the largest bank acquisition in history at that time.

While NationsBank was the nominal survivor, the merged bank took the better-known name of Bank of America. Hence, the holding company was renamed Bank of America Corporation, while NationsBank, N.A. merged with Bank of America NT&amp;SA to form Bank of America, N.A. as the remaining legal bank entity. The combined bank operates under Federal Charter 13044, which was granted to Giannini&#x27;s Bank of Italy on March 1, 1927. However, the merged company was and still is headquartered in Charlotte, and retains NationsBank&#x27;s pre-1998 stock price history. All U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings before 1998 are listed under NationsBank, not Bank of America. NationsBank president, chairman, and CEO Hugh McColl, took on the same roles with the merged company.

In 1998, Bank of America possessed combined assets of $570 billion, as well as 4,800 branches in 22 U.S. states. Despite the size of the two companies, federal regulators insisted only upon the divestiture of 13 branches in New Mexico, in towns that would be left with only a single bank following the combination. These branches were sold to BOK Financial Corporation, which operates them under the name &quot;Bank of Albuquerque&quot;. The broker-dealer, NationsBanc Montgomery Securities, was named Banc of America Securities in 1998.

===Banc of America Securities===

Banc of America Securities LLC (BAS), was the investment banking subsidiary of BoA from 1998 until BoA was merged with Merrill Lynch (2008). Headquartered in New York City, the company competed in both the domestic and international equity and investment banking markets. The company was a registered broker-dealer with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and was a member of the New York Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers. The use of &quot;Banc&quot; in the BAS&#x27;s name was indicative of the fact that the company was not a bank, and its deposits and other holdings were not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

The subsidiary was founded in 1998 following a strategy pioneered by Citigroup that combines corporate lending with investment banking advice and services. During its years of operation its strongest investment banking groups included high-yield debt underwriting and Leveraged Finance, in addition to industry coverage groups such as Healthcare, Consumer &amp; Retail, Global Industries, Media &amp; Telecom, Financial Institutions, Real Estate and Gaming. BAS also did a significant amount of work for Financial Sponsors, or private equity firms, often financing leveraged transactions. On the product side, the firm employed M&amp;A senior bankers throughout the industry coverage groups. BAS also had a stand-alone Mergers &amp; Acquisitions Group, consisting of bankers that transact M&amp;A deals across all industries, as well as a Transaction Development Group, which aimed to identify and market transaction opportunities. The unit also had sizeable fixed income, currency and commodities divisions.

During 2007–2008, BAS significantly downsized its international operations, eliminating a number of industry groups in Europe, as well as cutting numerous banking and sales and trading positions in North America and Asia prior to its merger with Merrill Lynch. On October 3, 2008, Bank of America announced that John Thain would lead the combined Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Global Corporate and Investment Banking enterprise. Thain was forced out by Bank of America Chairman Kenneth D. Lewis on January 22, 2009, because of the colossal losses visited on B of A due to its acquisition of Merrill Lynch. With Thain&#x27;s departure, Brian Moynihan became president of Global Banking and Global Wealth and Investment Management. After the merger was closed, the SEC Registration of Banc of America Securities was terminated in January 2011.

BAS operated from a number of offices across the world, with major offices in New York, New York, Charlotte, North Carolina, Chicago, Illinois, San Francisco, California, Tokyo, Frankfurt, London, and Mumbai. The bulk of its investment banking operations eventually moved to the Bank of America Tower, a $1 billion, 58-story skyscraper, at Bryant Park in New York City that was completed in 2009. Prior to that, BAS in New York had offices in various locations due to the numerous mergers that had taken place over the previous decade, including space at 9 West 57th Street, 1 World Trade Center, 1633 Broadway, 40 East 52nd Street, 335 Madison Avenue, and 100 West 33rd Street.

===2005 to 2007===
In 2001, McColl stepped down as CEO and named Ken Lewis as his successor. In 2004, Bank of America announced it would purchase Boston-based bank FleetBoston Financial for $47 billion in cash and stock. By merging with Bank of America, all of its banks and branches were given the Bank of America logo. At the time of merger, FleetBoston was the seventh largest bank in United States with $197 billion in assets, over 20 million customers and revenue of $12 billion. Hundreds of FleetBoston workers lost their jobs or were demoted, according to &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;.

On June 30, 2005, Bank of America announced it would purchase credit card giant MBNA for $35  billion in cash and stock. The Federal Reserve Board gave final approval to the merger on December 15, 2005, and the merger closed on January 1, 2006. The acquisition of MBNA provided Bank of America a leading domestic and foreign credit card issuer. The combined Bank of America Card Services organization, including the former MBNA, had more than 40 million U.S. accounts and nearly $140 billion in outstanding balances. Under Bank of America, the operation was renamed FIA Card Services.

Bank of America operated under the name BankBoston in many other Latin American countries, including Brazil. In May 2006, Bank of America and Banco Itaú (Investimentos Itaú S.A.) entered into an acquisition agreement, through which Itaú agreed to acquire BankBoston&#x27;s operations in Brazil, and was granted an exclusive right to purchase Bank of America&#x27;s operations in Chile and Uruguay, in exchange for Itaú shares. The deal was signed in August 2006.

Prior to the transaction, BankBoston&#x27;s Brazilian operations included asset management, private banking, a credit card portfolio, and small, middle-market, and large corporate segments. It had 66 branches and 203,000 clients in Brazil. BankBoston in Chile had 44 branches and 58,000 clients and in Uruguay, it had 15 branches. In addition, there was a credit card company, OCA, in Uruguay, which had 23 branches. BankBoston N.A. in Uruguay, together with OCA, jointly served 372,000 clients. While the BankBoston name and trademarks were not part of the transaction, as part of the sale agreement, they cannot be used by Bank of America in Brazil, Chile or Uruguay following the transactions. Hence, the BankBoston name has disappeared from Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. The Itaú stock received by Bank of America in the transactions has allowed Bank of America&#x27;s stake in Itaú to reach 11.51%. Banco de Boston de Brazil had been founded in 1947.

On November 20, 2006, Bank of America announced the purchase of The United States Trust Company for $3.3 billion, from the Charles Schwab Corporation. US Trust had about $100 billion of assets under management and over 150 years of experience. The deal closed July 1, 2007.

On September 14, 2007, Bank of America won approval from the Federal Reserve to acquire LaSalle Bank Corporation from ABN AMRO for $21 billion. With this purchase, Bank of America possessed $1.7 trillion in assets. A Dutch court blocked the sale until it was later approved in July. The acquisition was completed on October 1, 2007. Many of LaSalle&#x27;s branches and offices had already taken over smaller regional banks within the previous decade, such as Lansing and Detroit-based Michigan National Bank. The acquisition also included the Chicago Marathon event, which ABN AMRO acquired in 1996. Bank of America took over the event starting with the 2007 race.

The deal increased Bank of America&#x27;s presence in Illinois, Michigan, and Indiana by 411 branches, 17,000 commercial bank clients, 1.4 million retail customers, and 1,500 ATMs. Bank of America became the largest bank in the Chicago market with 197 offices and 14% of the deposit share, surpassing JPMorgan Chase.

LaSalle Bank and LaSalle Bank Midwest branches adopted the Bank of America name on May 5, 2008.

===2007–2010 (Subprime mortgage crisis)===
During the subprime mortgage crisis, the bank, under Ken Lewis, made two major acquisitions that would shape the future of the company for the next couple years coming out of the crisis. Specifically the bank was sued by many different parties and made to pay tens of billions of dollars.

====Acquisition of Countrywide Financial====
On August 23, 2007, the company announced a $2 billion repurchase agreement for Countrywide Financial. This purchase of preferred stock was arranged to provide a return on investment of 7.25% &quot;per annum&quot; and provided the option to purchase common stock at a price of $18 per share.

On January 11, 2008, Bank of America announced that it would buy Countrywide Financial for $4.1 billion. In March 2008, it was reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was investigating Countrywide for possible fraud relating to home loans and mortgages. This news did not hinder the acquisition, which was completed in July 2008, giving the bank a substantial market share of the mortgage business, and access to Countrywide&#x27;s resources for servicing mortgages. The acquisition was seen as preventing a potential bankruptcy for Countrywide. Countrywide, however, denied that it was close to bankruptcy. Countrywide provided mortgage servicing for nine million mortgages valued at $1.4 trillion as of December 31, 2007.

This purchase made Bank of America Corporation the leading mortgage originator and servicer in the U.S., controlling 20–25% of the home loan market. The deal was structured to merge Countrywide with the Red Oak Merger Corporation, which Bank of America created as an independent subsidiary. It has been suggested that the deal was structured this way to prevent a potential bankruptcy stemming from large losses in Countrywide hurting the parent organization by keeping Countrywide bankruptcy remote. Countrywide Financial has changed its name to Bank of America Home Loans.

In December 2011, the Justice Department announced a $335 million settlement with Bank of America over discriminatory lending practice at Countrywide Financial. Attorney General Eric Holder said a federal probe found discrimination against qualified African-American and Latino borrowers from 2004 to 2008. He said that minority borrowers who qualified for prime loans were steered into higher-interest-rate subprime loans.

====Acquisition of Merrill Lynch====

On September 14, 2008, Bank of America announced its intention to purchase Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc. in an all-stock deal worth approximately $50 billion. Merrill Lynch was at the time within days of collapse, and the acquisition effectively saved Merrill from bankruptcy. Around the same time Bank of America was reportedly also in talks to purchase Lehman Brothers, however a lack of government guarantees caused the bank to abandon talks with Lehman. Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy the same day Bank of America announced its plans to acquire Merrill Lynch. This acquisition made Bank of America the largest financial services company in the world. Temasek Holdings, the largest shareholder of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc., briefly became one of the largest shareholders of Bank of America, with a 3% stake. However, taking a loss Reuters estimated at $3 billion, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund sold its whole stake in Bank of America in the first quarter of 2009.

Shareholders of both companies approved the acquisition on December 5, 2008, and the deal closed January 1, 2009. Bank of America had planned to retain various members of the then Merrill Lynch&#x27;s CEO, John Thain&#x27;s management team after the merger. However, after Thain was removed from his position, most of his allies left. The departure of Nelson Chai, who had been named Asia-Pacific president, left just one of Thain&#x27;s hires in place: Tom Montag, head of sales and trading.

The bank, in its January 16, 2009, earnings release, revealed massive losses at Merrill Lynch in the fourth quarter, which necessitated an infusion of money that had previously been negotiated with the government as part of the government-persuaded deal for the bank to acquire Merrill. Merrill recorded an operating loss of $21.5 billion in the quarter, mainly in its sales and trading operations, led by Tom Montag. The bank also disclosed it tried to abandon the deal in December after the extent of Merrill&#x27;s trading losses surfaced, but was compelled to complete the merger by the U.S. government. The bank&#x27;s stock price sank to $7.18, its lowest level in 17 years, after announcing earnings and the Merrill mishap. The market capitalization of Bank of America, including Merrill Lynch, was then $45 billion, less than the $50 billion it offered for Merrill just four months earlier, and down $108 billion from the merger announcement.

Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis testified before Congress that he had some misgivings about the acquisition of Merrill Lynch and that federal official pressured him to proceed with the deal or face losing his job and endangering the bank&#x27;s relationship with federal regulators.

Lewis&#x27;s statement is backed up by internal emails subpoenaed by Republican lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee. In one of the emails, Richmond Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Lacker threatened that if the acquisition did not go through, and later Bank of America were forced to request federal assistance, the management of Bank of America would be &quot;gone&quot;. Other emails, read by Congressman Dennis Kucinich during the course of Lewis&#x27; testimony, state that Mr. Lewis had foreseen the outrage from his shareholders that the purchase of Merrill would cause, and asked government regulators to issue a letter stating that the government had ordered him to complete the deal to acquire Merrill. Lewis, for his part, states he didn&#x27;t recall requesting such a letter.

The acquisition made Bank of America the number one underwriter of global high-yield debt, the third largest underwriter of global equity and the ninth largest adviser on global mergers and acquisitions. As the credit crisis eased, losses at Merrill Lynch subsided, and the subsidiary generated $3.7 billion of Bank of America&#x27;s $4.2 billion in profit by the end of quarter one in 2009, and over 25% in quarter 3 2009.

On September 28, 2012, Bank of America settled the class-action lawsuit over the Merrill Lynch acquisition and will pay $2.43 billion. This was one of the first major securities class action lawsuits stemming from the financial crisis of 2007–2008 to settle. Many major financial institutions had a stake in this lawsuit, including Chicago Clearing Corporation, hedge funds, and bank trusts, due to the belief that Bank of America stock was a sure investment.

====Federal Troubled Asset Relief Program====
On January 16, 2009, Bank of America received $20 billion and a guarantee of $118 billion in potential losses from the U.S. government through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). This was in addition to the $25 billion given to the bank in the fall of 2008 through TARP. The additional payment was part of a deal with the U.S. government to preserve Bank of America&#x27;s merger with Merrill Lynch. Since then, members of the U.S. Congress have expressed considerable concern about how this money has been spent, especially since some of the recipients have been accused of misusing the bailout money. Then CEO Ken Lewis was quoted as claiming &quot;We are still lending, and we are lending far more because of the TARP program.&quot; Members of the U.S. House of Representatives, however, were skeptical and quoted many anecdotes about loan applicants (particularly small business owners) being denied loans and credit card holders facing stiffer terms on the debt in their card accounts.

According to an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; published on March 15, 2009, Bank of America received an additional $5.2 billion in government bailout money via the bailout of American International Group.

As a result of its federal bailout and management problems, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that the Bank of America was operating under a secret &quot;memorandum of understanding&quot; (MOU) from the U.S. government that requires it to &quot;overhaul its board and address perceived problems with risk and liquidity management&quot;. With the federal action, the institution has taken several steps, including arranging for six of its directors to resign and forming a Regulatory Impact Office. Bank of America faces several deadlines in July and August and if not met, could face harsher penalties by federal regulators. Bank of America did not respond to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; story.

On December 2, 2009, Bank of America announced it would repay the entire $45 billion it received in TARP and exit the program, using $26.2 billion of excess liquidity along with $18.6 billion to be gained in &quot;common equivalent securities&quot; (Tier 1 capital). The bank announced it had completed the repayment on December 9. Bank of America&#x27;s Ken Lewis said during the announcement, &quot;We appreciate the critical role that the U.S. government played last fall in helping to stabilize financial markets, and we are pleased to be able to fully repay the investment, with interest... As America&#x27;s largest bank, we have a responsibility to make good on the taxpayers&#x27; investment, and our record shows that we have been able to fulfill that commitment while continuing to lend.&quot;

====Bonus settlement====
On August 3, 2009, Bank of America agreed to pay a $33 million fine, without admission or denial of charges, to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the non-disclosure of an agreement to pay up to $5.8 billion of bonuses at Merrill. The bank approved the bonuses before the merger but did not disclose them to its shareholders when the shareholders were considering approving the Merrill acquisition, in December 2008. The issue was originally investigated by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who commented after the suit and announced a settlement that &quot;the timing of the bonuses, as well as the disclosures relating to them, constituted a &#x27;surprising fit of corporate irresponsibility and &quot;our investigation of these and other matters pursuant to New York&#x27;s Martin Act will continue&quot;. Congressman Kucinich commented at the same time that &quot;This may not be the last fine that Bank of America pays for how it handled its merger of Merrill Lynch.&quot; A federal judge, Jed Rakoff, in an unusual action, refused to approve the settlement on August 5.
A first hearing before the judge on August 10 was at times heated, and he was &quot;sharply critic[al]&quot; of the bonuses. David Rosenfeld represented the SEC, and Lewis J. Liman, son of Arthur L. Liman, represented the bank. The actual amount of bonuses paid was $3.6 billion, of which $850 million was &quot;guaranteed&quot; and the rest was shared among 39,000 workers who received average payments of $91,000; 696 people received more than $1 million in bonuses; at least one person received a more than $33 million bonus.

On September 14, the judge rejected the settlement and told the parties to prepare for trial to begin no later than February 1, 2010. The judge focused much of his criticism on the fact that the fine in the case would be paid by the bank&#x27;s shareholders, who were the ones that were supposed to have been injured by the lack of disclosure. He wrote, &quot;It is quite something else for the very management that is accused of having lied to its shareholders to determine how much of those victims&#x27; money should be used to make the case against the management go away,&quot; ... &quot;The proposed settlement,&quot; the judge continued, &quot;suggests a rather cynical relationship between the parties: the S.E.C. gets to claim that it is exposing wrongdoing on the part of the Bank of America in a high-profile merger; the bank&#x27;s management gets to claim that they have been coerced into an onerous settlement by overzealous regulators. And all this is done at the expense, not only of the shareholders but also of the truth.&quot;

While ultimately deferring to the SEC, in February 2010, Judge Rakoff approved a revised settlement with a $150 million fine &quot;reluctantly&quot;, calling the accord &quot;half-baked justice at best&quot; and &quot;inadequate and misguided&quot;. Addressing one of the concerns he raised in September, the fine will be &quot;distributed only to Bank of America shareholders harmed by the non-disclosures, or &#x27;legacy shareholders, an improvement on the prior $33 million while still &quot;paltry&quot;, according to the judge. Case: SEC v. Bank of America Corp., 09-cv-06829, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Investigations also were held on this issue in the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, under chairman Edolphus Towns (D-NY) and in its investigative Domestic Policy Subcommittee under Kucinich.

====Fraud====
In 2010, the U.S. government accused the bank of defrauding schools, hospitals, and dozens of state and local government organizations via misconduct and illegal activities involving the investment of proceeds from municipal bond sales. As a result, the bank agreed to pay $137.7 million, including $25 million to the Internal Revenue Service and $4.5 million to the state attorney general, to the affected organizations to settle the allegations. Former bank official Douglas Campbell pleaded guilty to antitrust, conspiracy, and wire fraud charges. , other bankers and brokers are under indictment or investigation.

On October 24, 2012, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan filed a lawsuit alleging that Bank of America fraudulently cost American taxpayers more than $1 billion when Countrywide Financial sold toxic mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The scheme was called &#x27;Hustle&#x27;, or High Speed Swim Lane. On May 23, 2016, the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the finding of fact by the jury that low quality mortgages were supplied by Countrywide to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the &quot;Hustle&quot; case supported only &quot;intentional breach of contract&quot;, not a fraud. The action, for civil fraud, relied on provisions of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act. The decision turned on lack of intent to defraud at the time the contract to supply mortgages was made.

====Change of CEO====
Ken Lewis, who had lost the title of chairman of the board, announced that he would retire as CEO effective December 31, 2009, in part due to controversy and legal investigations concerning the purchase of Merrill Lynch. Brian Moynihan became president and CEO effective January 1, 2010, and afterward credit card charge offs and delinquencies declined in January. Bank of America also repaid the $45 billion it had received from the Troubled Assets Relief Program.

===2011 to present===

====Downsizing (2011 to 2014)====
During 2011, Bank of America began conducting personnel reductions of an estimated 36,000 people, contributing to intended savings of $5 billion per year by 2014. In December 2011, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Bank of America&#x27;s financial wealth 91st out of the nation&#x27;s largest 100 banks and thrift institutions.

Bank of America cut around 16,000 jobs in a quicker fashion by the end of 2012 as revenue continued to decline because of new regulations and a slow economy. This put a plan one year ahead of time to eliminate 30,000 jobs under a cost-cutting program, called Project New BAC. In the first quarter of 2014, Berkshire bank purchased 20 Bank of America branches in Central and eastern New York for 14.4 million dollars. The branches were from Utica/Rome region and down the Mohawk Valley east to the capital region. In April and May 2014, Bank of America sold two dozen branches in Michigan to Huntington Bancshares. The locations were converted to Huntington National Bank branches in September.

As part of its new strategy Bank of America is focused on growing its mobile banking platform. , Bank of America has 31 million active online users and 16 million mobile users. Its retail banking branches have decreased to 4,900 as a result of increased mobile banking use and a decline in customer branch visits. By 2018, the number of mobile users has increased to 25.3 million and the number of locations fell to 4,411 at the end of June.

====Sale of stake in China Construction Bank====
In 2005, Bank of America acquired a 9% stake in China Construction Bank, one of the Big Four banks in China, for US$3 billion. It represented the company&#x27;s largest foray into China&#x27;s growing banking sector. Bank of America has offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Guangzhou and was looking to greatly expand its Chinese business as a result of this deal. In 2008, Bank of America was awarded Project Finance Deal of the Year at the 2008 ALB Hong Kong Law Awards. In November 2011, Bank of America announced plans to divest most of its stake in the China Construction Bank.

In September 2013, Bank of America sold its remaining stake in the China Construction Bank for as much as $1.5 billion, marking the firm&#x27;s full exit from the country.

====$17 billion settlement with Justice Department====
In August 2014, Bank of America agreed to a near–$17 billion deal to settle claims against it relating to the sale of toxic mortgage-linked securities including subprime home loans, in what was believed to be the largest settlement in U.S. corporate history. The bank agreed with the U.S. Justice Department to pay $9.65 billion in fines, and $7 billion in relief to the victims of the faulty loans which included homeowners, borrowers, pension funds and municipalities. Real estate economist Jed Kolko said the settlement is a &quot;drop in the bucket&quot; compared to the $700 billion in damages done to 11 million homeowners. Since the settlement covered such a substantial portion of the market, he said for most consumers &quot;you&#x27;re out of luck&quot;.

Much of the government&#x27;s prosecution was based on information provided by three whistleblowers – Shareef Abdou (a senior vice president at the bank), Robert Madsen (a professional appraiser employed by a bank subsidiary), and Edward O&#x27;Donnell (a Fannie Mae official). The three men received $170 million in whistleblower awards.

====DOD Community Bank====

Bank of America has formed a partnership with the United States Department of Defense creating a newly chartered bank DOD Community Bank (&quot;Community Bank&quot;) providing full banking services to military personnel at 68 branches and ATM locations on U.S. military installations in Guantanamo Bay Naval Base Cuba, Diego Garcia, Germany, Japan, Italy, Kwajalein Atoll, South Korea, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Even though Bank of America operates Community Bank, customer services are not interchangeable between the two financial institutions, meaning that a Community Bank customer cannot go to a Bank of America branch and withdraw from their account and vice versa. Deposits made into checking and savings accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000 despite the fact that none of Community&#x27;s operating branches are located within the jurisdictional borders of the United States.

====Decision not to finance makers of military-style guns====
In April 2018, Bank of America announced that it would stop providing financing to makers of military-style weapons such as the AR-15 rifle. In announcing the decision, Bank of America referenced recent mass shootings and said that it wanted to &quot;contribute in any way we can&quot; to reduce them.

====Return to expansion (2015–present)====
In 2015, Bank of America began expanding organically, opening branches in cities where it previously did not have a retail presence. They started that year in Denver, followed by Minneapolis–Saint Paul and Indianapolis, in all cases having at least one of its Big Four competitors, with Chase Bank being available in Denver and Indianapolis, while Wells Fargo is available in Denver and the Twin Cities. The Twin Cities market is also the home market of U.S. Bancorp, the largest non-Big Four rival.

In January 2018, Bank of America announced an organic expansion of its retail footprint into Pittsburgh and surrounding areas, to supplement its existing commercial lending and investment businesses in the area. Before the expansion, Pittsburgh had been one of the largest US cities without a retail presence by any of the Big Four, with locally based PNC Financial Services (no. 6 nationally) having a commanding market share in the area; this coincided with Chase making a similar expansion into Pittsburgh. By the end of the fiscal year 2020, Bank of America had become Pittsburgh&#x27;s 16th largest bank by deposits, which considering the dominance of PNC and BNY Mellon in the market is considered relatively impressive. By 2021, Bank of America had moved up to 12th in the market.

In February 2018, Bank of America announced it would expand into Ohio across the state&#x27;s three biggest cities (Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati), which are strongholds of Chase. Columbus serves as the bank&#x27;s hub in Ohio due to its central location as the state&#x27;s capital, its overall size and growth, and an existing Bank of America call center for its credit card division in suburban Westerville. Within a year of entering Ohio, Columbus quickly saw the bank become the 5th largest in the market by deposits, behind only banks either based in Ohio (Fifth Third Bank and locally based Huntington Bancshares) or have a major presence as a result of an acquisition of an Ohio-based institution (Chase and PNC), and ahead of US Bancorp (also with a large presence due to acquiring an Ohio-based bank), Ohio-based KeyBank, and several local institutions. As of 2021, Bank of America is the 9th largest bank by deposits in all of Ohio.

In January 2020, Bank of America hired new advisors whose primary functions are to assist ultra-wealthy clients.

==Charitable efforts==
In 1998, the bank made a ten-year commitment of $350 billion to provide affordable mortgages, build affordable housing, support small businesses and create jobs in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. In 2004, the bank pledged $750 million over a ten-year period for community development lending and affordable housing programs.

In 2007, the bank offered employees a $3,000 rebate for the purchase of hybrid vehicles. The company also provided a $1,000 rebate or a lower interest rate for customers whose homes qualified as energy efficient. In 2007, Bank of America partnered with Brighter Planet to offer an eco-friendly credit card, and later a debit card, which help build renewable energy projects with each purchase.

==Lawsuits, controversies, and incidents==
===Lawsuits===
====Parmalat lawsuit====
Parmalat SpA is a multinational Italian dairy and food corporation. Following Parmalat&#x27;s 2003 bankruptcy, the company sued Bank of America for $10 billion, alleging the bank profited from its knowledge of Parmalat&#x27;s financial difficulties. The parties announced a settlement in July 2009, resulting in Bank of America paying Parmalat $98.5 million in October 2009. In a related case, on April 18, 2011, an Italian court acquitted Bank of America and three other large banks, along with their employees, of charges they assisted Parmalat in concealing its fraud, and of lacking sufficient internal controls to prevent such frauds. Prosecutors did not immediately say whether they would appeal the rulings. In Parma, the banks were still charged with covering up the fraud.

====Mortgage abuses====
In August 2011, Bank of America was sued for $10 billion by American International Group over an alleged &quot;massive fraud&quot; on mortgage debt. Another lawsuit filed against Bank of America, pertained to $57.5 billion in mortgage-backed securities Bank of America sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That December, Bank of America agreed to pay $335 million to settle a federal government claim that Countrywide Financial had discriminated against Hispanic and African-American homebuyers from 2004 to 2008, prior to being acquired by BofA. In September 2012, BofA settled out of court for $2.4 billion in a class action lawsuit filed by BofA shareholders who felt they were misled about the purchase of Merrill Lynch.

On February 9, 2012, it was announced that the five largest mortgage servicers (Ally/GMAC, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) agreed to a historic settlement with the federal government and 49 states. The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required the servicers to provide about $26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners and indirect payments to the states and the federal government. This settlement amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in U.S. history, only trailing the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. The five banks were also required to comply with 305 new mortgage servicing standards. Oklahoma held out and agreed to settle with the banks separately.

On October 24, 2012, American federal prosecutors filed a $1 billion civil lawsuit against Bank of America for mortgage fraud under the False Claims Act, which provides for possible penalties of triple the damages suffered. The government asserted that Countrywide, which was acquired by Bank of America, rubber-stamped mortgage loans to risky borrowers and forced taxpayers to guarantee billions of bad loans through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The suit was filed by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, the inspector general of FHFA and the special inspector for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. In March 2014, Bank of America settled the suit by agreeing to pay $6.3 billion to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and to buy back around $3.2 billion worth of mortgage bonds.

A$7.5 million settlement was reached in April 2014 with former chief financial officer for Bank of America, Joe L. Price, over allegations that the bank&#x27;s management withheld material information related to its 2008 merger with Merrill Lynch. In August 2014, the United States Department of Justice and the bank agreed to a $16.65 billion agreement over the sale of risky, mortgage-backed securities before the Great Recession; the loans behind the securities were transferred to the company when it acquired banks such as Merrill Lynch and Countrywide in 2008. As a whole, the three firms provided $965 billion of mortgage-backed securities from 2004 to 2008. The settlement was structured to give $7 billion in consumer relief and $9.65 billion in penalty payments to the federal government and state governments; California, for instance, received $300 million to recompense public pension funds. The settlement was the largest in United States history between a single company and the federal government.

====Settlement with homeowners====
On March 14, 2011, members of hacker group Anonymous began releasing emails said to be from a former Bank of America employee. According to the group, the emails documented alleged &quot;corruption and fraud&quot;. The source, identified publicly as Brian Penny, was a former LPI Specialist from Balboa Insurance, a firm which used to be owned by the bank, but was sold to Australian Reinsurance Company QBE. On April 7, 2014, Bank of America and QBE settled a class-action lawsuit stemming from the leak for $228 million.

====Unfair billing practices====
In April 2014, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) ordered Bank of America to provide an estimated $727 million in relief to consumers harmed by practices related to credit card add-on products. According to the Bureau, roughly 1.4 million customers were affected by deceptive marketing of add-on products, and 1.9 million customers were illegally charged for credit monitoring and reporting services they were not receiving. The deceptive marketing misconduct involved telemarketing scripts containing misstatements and off-script sales pitches made by telemarketers that were misleading and omitted pertinent information. The unfair billing practices involved billing customers for privacy-related products without having the authorization necessary to perform the credit monitoring and credit report retrieval services. As a result, the company billed customers for services they did not receive, unfairly charged consumers for interest and fees, illegally charged approximately 1.9 million accounts, and failed to provide the product benefit. In May 2022, CFPB ordered Bank of America to pay $10 million in penalties for illegal garnishments.

====Discrimination====
In 2018, former senior executive Omeed Malik filed a $100 million arbitration case through FINRA against Bank of America after the company investigated him for alleged sexual misconduct. His defamation claim was on the basis of retaliation, breach of contract, and discrimination against his Muslim background. Malik received an eight-figure settlement in July of the same year.

==== South African Currency Manipulation ====
In April 2015, the Competition Commission (South Africa) ) lodged an investigation into cartel conduct by major banks in the foreign currency exchange market affecting the South African rand. The investigation included Bank of America along with other banks including Barclays Bank Plc, CitiGroup Inc, JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Standard New York Securities Inc and others. The above traders in foreign currencies are under investigation for directly or indirectly fixing prices on bids, offers and bid-offer spreads with regard to spot, futures and forwards currency trades. The conduct under investigation has the effect of distorting foreign exchange prices and artificially inflating the cost of trading in foreign currency, in relation to the rand.

==== Fake accounts, junk fees and withheld rewards ====
In 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said that a total of $250 million in fines and compensation has been levied against Bank of America for &quot;deceptive practices that harmed hundreds of thousands of consumers&quot;, including double charging insufficient funds fees, withholding credit card rewards, and opening accounts without the knowledge or permission of customers.

===Controversies===

====Consumer credit controversies====
In January 2008, Bank of America began notifying some customers without payment problems that their interest rates were more than doubled, up to 28%. The bank was criticized for raising rates on customers in good standing, and for declining to explain why it had done so. In September 2009, a Bank of America credit card customer, Ann Minch, posted a video on YouTube criticizing the bank for raising her interest rate. After the video went viral, she was contacted by a Bank of America representative who lowered her rate. The story attracted national attention from television and internet commentators. In 2010, the bank was criticized for allegedly seizing three properties that were not under their ownership, apparently due to incorrect addresses on their legal documents.

====State of Arizona investigation====
In 2010 the state of Arizona launched an investigation into Bank of America for misleading homeowners who sought to modify their mortgage loans. According to the attorney general of Arizona, the bank &quot;repeatedly has deceived&quot; such mortgagors. In response to the investigation, the bank has given some modifications on the condition that the homeowners remove some information criticizing the bank online.

====Investment in coal mining====
On May 6, 2015, Bank of America announced it would reduce its financial exposure to coal companies. The announcement came following pressure from universities and environmental groups. The new policy was announced as part of the bank&#x27;s decision to continue to reduce credit exposure over time to the coal mining sector.

===Incidents===

====Wikileaks incident====
In October 2009, Julian Assange of WikiLeaks claimed that his organization possessed a 5 gigabyte hard drive formerly used by a Bank of America executive and that Wikileaks intended to publish its contents. In November 2010, &quot;Forbes&quot; published an interview with Assange in which he stated his intent to publish information which would turn a major U.S. bank &quot;inside out&quot;. In response to this announcement, Bank of America stock dropped 3.2%.

In December 2010, Bank of America announced that it would no longer service requests to transfer funds to WikiLeaks, stating that &quot;Bank of America joins in the actions previously announced by MasterCard, PayPal, Visa Europe, and others and will not process transactions of any type that we have reason to believe are intended for WikiLeaks... This decision is based upon our reasonable belief that WikiLeaks may be engaged in activities that are, among other things, inconsistent with our internal policies for processing payments.&quot;

Later in December, it was announced that Bank of America purchased more than 300 Internet domain names in an attempt to preempt bad publicity that might be forthcoming in the anticipated WikiLeaks release. The domain names included as &quot;BrianMoynihanBlows.com&quot;, &quot;BrianMoynihanSucks.com&quot; and similar names for other top executives of the bank.

Sometime before August 2011, WikiLeaks claimed that 5 GB of Bank of America leaks was part of the deletion of over 3500 communications by Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a now ex-WikiLeaks volunteer.

====Ryan Coogler incident====
In March 2022, the bank was involved in an incident related to filmmaker Ryan Coogler, who was wrongly targeted as a bank robber and detained by the police in Atlanta, after Coogler tried to withdraw cash in the local branch of the Bank of America. After his identity was verified with both his California state ID card and his Bank of America card, Coogler was released and the bank released an apology statement. According to a number of sources, the bank&#x27;s teller hadn&#x27;t checked Coogler&#x27;s ID to verify if he was the owner of the bank account before she asked the bank&#x27;s supervisor to call police.

====Employee Fatalities====

In 2013, an intern in the London office was found dead. It was reported that the intern had worked until 6am for the preceding three days before his death, and that this was typical of expectations at the bank. The incident sparked much debate regarding working hours at the firm, which resulted in rival firm Goldman Sachs capping intern hours to 17 per day.

In 2024, Leo Lukensas III a, former US Army Special Forces Veteran working in the investment banking division also died following heart problems. It was reported that the investment bank has a culture of working weeks in excess of 100 hours per week, and managers encouraging employees to under report their working hours to HR. Lukensas was reported to be seeking to leave the firm, citing excessive working hours. His manager, Gary Howe, was removed as a leader, although not fired from his post following the incident.

====Debanking====

Bank of America has been accused of terminating the accounts of people based on their religious or political views, often with alleged victims being aligned with conservative causes. in 2023, a Christian charity primarily focused on charitable work in Africa reportedly had its account suddenly terminated without explanation. The bank refused to explain anything until contacted by members of the media, where after refusing to explain anything to the customer, it proceeded to make a series of allegedly false accusations against the customer to a reporter. In response, a shareholder action proposal was made at a Bank of America annual meeting. in 2025, United States, president Donald Trump accused Bank of America CEO Brian, Moynahan of political debanking, stating he hoped the CEO would open his bank to conservatives.

====Customer Privacy====
The bank faced heavy criticism and a congressional investigation following the events of January 6, 2021. The bank was accused of without compulsion handing over extensive private profile information of any individual who may have shopped at Cabela’s, rented a hotel anywhere in Virginia, went to an ATM in DC, on January 5-7, 2021, even though it had been under no compulsion to do so. The bank claimed in its defense only that it was allowed to do so.

<text>Van Kooten en De Bie were a Dutch comedy duo formed by Kees van Kooten and Wim de Bie. They started performing together in 1963. They started off as radio comedians, but gained more prominence from 1966 on by working for television. In 1974 they began a weekly TV sketch show on Sunday evenings, &quot;Het Simplisties Verbond&quot;, broadcast on VPRO, which continued for three decades under various titles, while remaining the same concept, until finally coming to a close in 1998. Despite the varying titles of their TV show the general audience always referred to them as &quot;Van Kooten en De Bie&quot;.

In the Dutch-speaking world Van Kooten en De Bie enjoy both a high popularity and critical acclaim for their satirical portrayal of society, with numerous classic sketches and comedy characters. They also created many musical singles, audio plays, calendars and books.

==Career==

The two cooperated for years, before they started to work for the public broadcasting organization VPRO, where they first performed for radio broadcasting, and later took to making shows for television. Their first television appearance was in 1972 with the program &quot;Het Simplisties Verbond&quot; (&quot;The Simplistik [sic] League&quot;), with a carpet-beater as their symbol. The show mainly featured sketches whose returning intricate characters and running gags quickly became very well known in the Netherlands. In 1980 they changed the name of their weekly programme to &quot;Koot en Bie&quot;, a year later renamed &quot;Van Kooten en De Bie&quot;. In 1989 the show took a turn to focus more on current events, and was therefore renamed &quot;Keek op de week&quot; (&quot;View on the Week&quot;). In 1998 the duo finally decided to end their TV career. Their final TV appearance as &quot;Koot en Bie&quot;, took place on 16 November 2003 in the VPRO program &quot;Terugkeek van Van Kooten en De Bie&quot;&#x27;.

==Style==

Van Kooten and De Bie were praised for their satirical and socially conscious view of Dutch society and politics. Over the course of three decades their TV show broadcast a new episode every Sunday evening. They played a host of recurring comedy characters, but also imitated well known Dutch politicians and entertainers. Most of the sketches were played only by themselves, with occasional extras and side characters. Apart from their TV shows Van Kooten en De Bie also made books, calendars, musical singles and audio plays.

From the 1970s until the 1990s they were household names in the Dutch-speaking world, drawing in many viewers from Flanders as well. They were a major influence on many Dutch and Flemish satirical sketch shows, including &quot;Koefnoen&quot;, &quot;Kopspijkers&quot;, &quot;30 minuten&quot;, &quot;Draadstaal&quot; and &quot;In de gloria&quot;. Their influence on Dutch society is such that they inspired many neologisms, which entered the daily language and have been added to the dictionary. A 2003 study attributed at least 40 words and expressions to them, with 10 others they popularised.

They won two Zilveren Nipkowschijf awards, one in 1974 and one in 1977. In 1985 they received a honorary Nipkow schijf.

Their popularity is reflected in their 30th place in a 2004 public poll to search the all-time &quot;greatest Dutchman&quot;. They were the highest television personalities on the list and as comedians were only preceded by cabaretier Toon Hermans at 22.

<doc id="347759" wikidata="Q928357" url="?curid=347759" title="Bronze sculpture">
<text>Bronze is the most popular metal for cast metal sculptures; a cast bronze sculpture is often called simply &quot;a bronze&quot;. It can be used for statues, singly or in groups, reliefs, and small statuettes and figurines, as well as bronze elements to be fitted to other objects such as furniture. It is often gilded to give gilt-bronze or ormolu.

Common bronze alloys have the unusual and desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling the finest details of a mould. Then, as the bronze cools, it shrinks a little, making it easier to separate from the mould. Their strength and (lack of brittleness) is an advantage when figures in action poses are to be created, especially when compared to various ceramic or stone materials (such as marble sculpture). These qualities allow the creation of extended figures, as in &quot;Jeté&quot;, or figures that have small cross sections in their support, such as the equestrian statue of Richard the Lionheart.

But the value of the bronze for uses other than making statues is disadvantageous to the preservation of sculptures; few large ancient bronzes have survived, as many were melted down to make weapons or ammunition in times of war or to create new sculptures commemorating the victors, while far more stone and ceramic works have come through the centuries, even if only in fragments. As recently as 2007 several life sized bronze sculptures by John Waddell were stolen, probably due to the value of the metal after the work has been melted.

==Material==
There are many different bronze alloys. Typically modern bronze is 88% copper and 12% tin. Alpha bronze consists of the alpha solid solution of tin in copper. Alpha bronze alloys of 4–5% tin are used to make coins and a number of mechanical applications. Historical bronzes are highly variable in composition, as most metalworkers probably used whatever scrap was on hand; the metal of the 12th-century English Gloucester Candlestick is bronze containing a mixture of copper, zinc, tin, lead, nickel, iron, antimony, arsenic with an unusually large amount of silver between 22.5% in the base and 5.76% in the pan below the candle. The proportions of this mixture may suggest that the candlestick was made from a hoard of old coins. The Benin Bronzes are really brass, and the Romanesque Baptismal font at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, Liège is described as both bronze and brass.

In the Bronze Age, two forms of bronze were commonly used: &quot;classic bronze&quot;, about 10% tin, was used in casting; and &quot;mild bronze&quot;, about 6% tin, was hammered from ingots to make sheets. Bladed weapons were mostly cast from classic bronze, while helmets and armour were hammered from mild bronze. According to one definition, modern &quot;statuary bronze&quot; is 90% copper and 10% tin.

== History ==
The great civilizations of the old world worked in bronze for art, from the time of the introduction of the alloy for tools and edged weapons. &quot;Dancing Girl&quot; from Mohenjo-daro, belonging to the Indus Valley Civilisation and dating back to , is perhaps the first known bronze statue. Life-sized bronze statues in Ancient Greece have been found in good condition; one is the seawater-preserved bronze &quot;Victorious Youth&quot; that required painstaking efforts to bring it to its present state for museum display. Far more Roman bronze statues have survived.

The ancient Chinese knew both lost-wax casting and section mould casting, and during the Shang dynasty created large numbers of Chinese ritual bronzes, ritual vessels covered with complex decoration, which were buried in sets of up to 200 pieces in the tombs of royalty and the nobility. Over the long creative period of Egyptian dynastic art, small lost-wax bronze figurines were made in large numbers; several thousand of them have been conserved in museum collections.

The Nuragic civilization in the Mediterranean island of Sardinia produced a large number of small bronze statues, known as (Nuragic bronze statuettes), starting from the 12th century BCE. 

The 7th-8th century Sri Lankan Sinhalese bronze statue of Buddhist Tara, now in the British Museum, is an example of Sri Lankan bronze statues.

From the ninth through the thirteenth century the Chola dynasty in South India represented the pinnacle of bronze casting in India.

== Process ==

Making bronzes is highly skilled work, and a number of distinct casting processes may be employed, including lost-wax casting (and its modern-day spin-off investment casting), sand casting and centrifugal casting. The term &quot;bronze&quot; is also applied to metal sculptures made by electrotyping (or galvanoplasty), although these sculptures are typically pure copper and their fabrication does not involve metal casting.

=== Lost wax method ===
In lost-wax or investment casting, the artist starts with a full-sized model of the sculpture, most often a non-drying oil-based clay such as Plasticine model for smaller sculptures or for sculptures to be developed over an extended period (water-based clays must be protected from drying), and water-based clay for larger sculptures or for sculptures for which it is desired to capture a &quot;gestural&quot; qualityone that transmits the motion of the sculptor in addition to that of the subject. A mould is made from the clay pattern, either as a piece mould from plaster, or using flexible gel or similar rubber-like materials stabilized by a plaster jacket of several pieces. Often a plaster master will be made from this mould for further refinement. Such a plaster is a means of preserving the artwork until a patron may be found to finance a bronze casting, either from the original moulds or from a new mould made from the refined plaster positive.

Once a production mould is obtained, a wax (hollow for larger sculptures) is then cast from the mould. For a hollow sculpture, a core is then cast into the void, and is retained in its proper location (after wax melting) by pins of the same metal used for casting. One or more wax sprues are added to conduct the molten metal into the sculptures - typically directing the liquid metal from a pouring cup to the bottom of the sculpture, which is then filled from the bottom up in order to avoid splashing and turbulence. Additional sprues may be directed upward at intermediate positions, and various vents may also be added where gases could be trapped. (Vents are not needed for ceramic shell casting, allowing the sprue to be simple and direct). The complete wax structure (and core, if previously added) is then invested in another kind of mould or shell, which is heated in a kiln until the wax runs out and all free moisture is removed. The investment is then soon filled with molten bronze. The removal of all wax and moisture prevents the liquid metal from being explosively ejected from the mould by steam and vapour.

Students of bronze casting will usually work in direct wax, where the model is made in wax, possibly formed over a core, or with a core cast in place, if the piece is to be hollow. If no mould is made and the casting process fails, the artwork will also be lost. After the metal has cooled, the external ceramic or clay is chipped away, revealing an image of the wax form, including core pins, sprues, vents, and risers. All of these are removed with a saw and tool marks are polished away, and interior core material is removed to reduce the likelihood of interior corrosion. Incomplete voids created by gas pockets or investment inclusions are then corrected by welding and carving. Small defects where sprues and vents were attached are filed or ground down and polished.

=== Creating large sculptures ===

For a large sculpture, the artist will usually prepare small study models until the pose and proportions are determined. An intermediate-sized model is then constructed with all of the final details. For very large works, this may again be scaled to a larger intermediate. From the final scale model, measuring devices are used to determine the dimensions of an armature for the structural support of a full-size temporary piece, which is brought to rough form by wood, cardboard, plastic foam, and/or paper to approximately fill the volume while keeping the weight low. Finally, plaster, clay or other material is used to form the full-size model, from which a mould may be constructed. Alternatively, a large refractory core may be constructed, and the direct-wax method then applied for subsequent investment. Before modern welding techniques, large sculptures were generally cast in one piece with a single pour. Welding allows a large sculpture to be cast in pieces, then joined.

=== Finishing ===

After final polishing, corrosive materials may be applied to form a patina, a process that allows some control over the colour and finish.

Another form of sculptural art that uses bronze is ormolu, a finely cast soft bronze that is gilded (coated with gold) to produce a matte gold finish. Ormolu was popularized in the 18th century in France and is found in such forms as wall sconces (wall-mounted candle holders), inkstands, clocks and garnitures. Ormolu wares can be identified by a clear ring when tapped, showing that they are made of bronze, not a cheaper alloy such as spelter or pewter.

<doc id="347761" wikidata="Q1334002" url="?curid=347761" title="Whydah Gally">
<text>Whydah Gally (commonly known simply as the Whydah) was a fully rigged ship that was originally built as a passenger, cargo, and slave ship. On the return leg of her maiden voyage of the triangle trade, &quot;Whydah Gally&quot; was captured by the pirate Captain Samuel &quot;Black Sam&quot; Bellamy, beginning a new role in the Golden Age of Piracy.

Bellamy sailed &quot;Whydah Gally&quot; up the coast of colonial America, capturing other ships as he went along. On 26 April 1717, &quot;Whydah Gally&quot; was caught in a violent storm and wrecked off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Only two of &quot;Whydah Gally&quot;″s crew survived, along with seven others who were on a sloop captured by Bellamy earlier that day. Six of the nine survivors were hanged, two who had been forced into piracy were freed, and one Indian crewman was sold into slavery.

&quot;Whydah Gally&quot; and her treasure of captured pirate gold eluded discovery for over 260 years until 1984, when the wreck was found off the coast of Cape Cod, buried under of sand, in depths ranging from deep, spread for four miles, parallel to the Cape&#x27;s easternmost coast. With the discovery of the ship&#x27;s bell in 1985 and a small brass placard in 2013, both inscribed with the ship&#x27;s name and maiden voyage date, &quot;Whydah Gally&quot; is the only fully authenticated Golden Age pirate shipwreck ever discovered.

==Slave ship==
&quot;Whydah Gally&quot; was commissioned in 1715 in London, England, by Sir Humphrey Morice, a member of parliament (MP), who was known as &#x27;the foremost London slave merchant of his day&#x27;. A square-rigged three-masted galley ship, she measured in length, with a tonnage rating at 300 tuns burthen, and could travel at speeds up to .

Christened &quot;Whydah Gally&quot; after the West African slave-trading Kingdom of Whydah, the vessel was configured as a heavily armed trading and transport ship (which included the Atlantic slave trade). She set out for her maiden voyage in early 1716, carrying a variety of goods from different businesses to exchange for delivery, trade, and slaves in West Africa. After traveling down the West African coast, through modern-day Gambia and Senegal to Nigeria and Benin, where its namesake port was located, she left Africa with an estimated 500 slaves, gold, including Akan jewelry, and ivory aboard. She traveled to the Caribbean, where she traded and sold the cargo and slaves for precious metals, sugar, indigo, rum, logwood, pimento, ginger, and medicinal ingredients, which were to then be transported back to England. She was fitted with a standard complement of 18 six-pound cannons, which could be increased to a total of 28 in time of war.

==Pirate ship==
In late February 1717, &quot;Whydah Gally&quot;, under the command of Captain Lawrence Prince (not to be confused with the buccaneer who served under Sir Henry Morgan), was navigating the Windward Passage between Cuba and Hispaniola when she was attacked by pirates led by &quot;Black Sam&quot; Bellamy. At the time of &quot;Whydah Gally&quot;″s capture, Bellamy was in possession of two vessels, the 26-gun galleon &quot;Sultana&quot; and the converted 10-gun sloop &quot;Marianne&quot;, captained by Bellamy&#x27;s friend and investor Paulsgrave Williams. After a three-day chase, Prince surrendered his ship near the Bahamas with only a desultory exchange of cannon fire.

Bellamy decided to take &quot;Whydah Gally&quot; as his new flagship; several of her crew remained with their ship and joined the pirate gang. Pirate recruitment was most effective among the unemployed, escaped bondsmen, and transported criminals, as the high seas made for an instant leveling of class distinctions. They were freed African slaves, displaced English seamen, Native Americans, and a scattering of social outcasts from Europe and elsewhere.

In a gesture of goodwill toward Captain Prince who had surrendered without a struggle—and who in any case may have been favorably known by reputation to the pirate crew—Bellamy gave &quot;Sultana&quot; to Prince, along with £20 in silver and gold ().

&quot;Whydah Gally&quot; was then fitted with 10 additional cannons by its new captain, and 150 members of Bellamy&#x27;s crew were detailed to man the vessel. They razeed the ship by clearing the top deck of the pilot&#x27;s cabin, removing the slave barricade, and getting rid of other features that made her top heavy.

Bellamy and his crew then sailed on to the Carolinas and headed north along the eastern coastline of the American colonies, aiming for the central coast of Maine, looting or capturing additional vessels on the way. &quot;Whydah Gally&quot; was caught up in a storm, which heavily damaged it and broke one of its masts. Patch-ups and repairs were effected until they reached the waters near Nantucket Sound, where greater repairs were effected, possibly at Block Island or Rhode Island. At some point during his possession of &quot;Whydah Gally&quot;, Bellamy added another 30+ cannon below decks, possibly as ballast. Two cannon recovered by underwater explorer Barry Clifford in August 2009 weighed , respectively.
Accounts differ as to &quot;Whydah Gally&quot;″s destination in her last few days. Some blame &quot;Whydah Gally&quot;″s route on navigator error. In any case, on 26 April 1717, near Chatham, Massachusetts, &quot;Whydah Gally&quot; approached a thick, gray fog bank rolling across the water—signaling inclement weather ahead.

On 26 April the pirates captured the ship &quot;Mary Anne&quot; with a hold full of Madeira wine. The captain of &quot;Mary Anne&quot; refused Bellamy&#x27;s request to pilot them up the coast, so Bellamy arrested the captain and five of his crew and brought them aboard &quot;Whydah Gally&quot;, leaving three of the original crew aboard &quot;Mary Anne&quot;. Then Bellamy sent 7 of his own men onboard of &quot;Mary Anne&quot;—one of whom was the carpenter Thomas South, who had been forced by Bellamy and his crew to make repairs; not wanting to join the pirate crew, he had been offered release by Bellamy after work was completed, but the surviving pirates later testified to the court that they had over-ruled Bellamy&#x27;s decision and forced South to stay due to his much whimpering and complaining. South testified that it was his choice to accompany the 6 pirates going aboard &quot;Mary Anne&quot; in hopes of escaping, possibly by jumping overboard and swimming ashore as they drew near to the Cape. Sometime around sunset that evening, the winds completely died, and a massive fog bank made visibility virtually nil. The four ships in Bellamy&#x27;s fleet lost sight of one another. Bellamy&#x27;s ships &quot;Anne&quot; (captained by his quartermaster Richard Noland) and &quot;Fisher&quot; moved out to sea (eventually making it to Damariscove Island with heavy damage). Williams had turned &quot;Marianne&quot; away earlier, putting into Block Island to visit relatives but agreeing to meet Bellamy later off Maine.

== Shipwreck ==
That weather turned into a violent nor&#x27;easter, a storm with gale force winds out of the east and northeast, which forced the vessel dangerously close to the breaking waves along the shoals of Cape Cod. The ship was eventually driven aground at what today is Marconi Beach at Wellfleet, Massachusetts. At midnight she hit a sandbar, bow first in of water about from shore. Pummeled by winds and waves, the main mast snapped, pulling the ship into about of water, where she violently capsized, sending over of silver and gold, more than 60 cannons and 144 people to the ocean floor. The 60+ cannon on board ripped through the overturned decks of the ship and quickly broke her apart, scattering parts of the ship, 102 human bodies, and thousands of objects over a length of coast. One of the two surviving members of Bellamy&#x27;s crew, Thomas Davis, testified in his subsequent trial that &quot;In a quarter of an hour after the ship struck, the Mainmast was carried by the board, and in the Morning she was beat to pieces.&quot;

By morning, hundreds of Cape Cod&#x27;s notorious wreckers (locally known as &quot;moon-cussers&quot;) were already plundering the remains. Hearing of the shipwreck, governor Samuel Shute dispatched Captain Cyprian Southack, a local salvager and cartographer, to recover &quot;Money, Bullion, Treasure, Goods and Merchandizes taken out of the said Ship.&quot; When Southack reached the wreck on 3 May, he found that part of the ship was still visible breaching the water&#x27;s surface, but that much of the ship&#x27;s wreckage was scattered along more than of shoreline. On a map that he made of the wreck site, Southack reported that he had buried 102 of the 144 &quot;Whydah Gally&quot; crew and captives lost in the sinking (though technically they were buried by the town coroner, who surprised Southack by handing him the bill and demanding payment).

&quot;Mary Anne&quot; was also wrecked, ten miles south at Pochet Island. According to surviving members of the crew at the time of her sinking, &quot;Whydah Gally&quot; carried from four and a half to five tons of silver, gold, gold dust, and jewelry, which had been divided equally into 180 sacks and stored in-between the ship&#x27;s decks. Though Southack did salvage some nearly worthless items from the ship, little of the massive treasure hoard was recovered. Southack wrote in his account of his findings, that, &quot;The riches, with the guns, would be buried in the sand.&quot; With that, the exact location of the ship, its riches and its guns were lost, and came to be thought of as nothing more than legend.

==Survivors==
Of the 146 souls aboard &quot;Whydah Gally&quot;, only two men—the ship&#x27;s pilot, 16-year-old Miskito Indian John Julian, and Welsh carpenter Thomas Davis—are known to have made it to the beach alive. All seven of Bellamy&#x27;s men on board &quot;Mary Anne&quot; survived, as did &quot;Mary Anne&quot;&#x27;s three original crewmen. Including the seven men aboard &quot;Mary Anne&quot;, nine of Bellamy&#x27;s crew survived the wrecking of the two ships. They were all quickly captured by Justice Joseph Doane and his posse and locked up in Barnstable Gaol. On 18 October 1717, six were tried in Boston for piracy and robbery. The following were found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging: John Brown of Jamaica, Thomas Baker and Hendrick Quintor of the Netherlands; Peter Cornelius Hoof of Sweden; John Shaun of France; and Simon van der Vorst of New York.

Carpenters Thomas South and Thomas Davis, who were tried separately, had been conscripted by Bellamy—forced to choose between a life of piracy or death. Therefore, they were acquitted of all charges and spared the gallows. John Julian was not tried, but instead was sold as a slave (to the great-grandfather of John Quincy Adams) after his capture and finally hanged 16 years later.

On 15 November 1717, the famous Puritan minister Cotton Mather accompanied the six condemned men as they were rowed across Boston Harbor to Charlestown. All six men confessed and repented in the presence of Mather, but they were still hanged.

==Recovery==
Barry Clifford found the &quot;Whydah Gally&quot;″s wreck in 1984, relying heavily on Southack&#x27;s 1717 map of the wreck site—a modern-day, true-to-life &quot;pirate treasure map&quot; leading to what was at that time a discovery of unprecedented proportions. That &quot;Whydah Gally&quot; had eluded discovery for over 260 years became even more surprising when the wreck was found under just of water and of sand.

The ship&#x27;s location has been the site of extensive underwater archaeology, and more than 200,000 individual pieces have since been retrieved. One major find in the fall of 1985 was the ship&#x27;s bell, inscribed with the words &quot;&quot;. With that, &quot;Whydah Gally&quot; became the first ever pirate shipwreck with its identity having been established and authenticated beyond doubt.
Work on the site by Clifford&#x27;s dive team continues on an annual basis out of Provincetown, Massachusetts. Clifford opened The Whydah Sea-Lab &amp; Learning Center in Provincetown after discovering the wreck and the center operated on MacMillan Pier until its move in 2016. Selected artifacts from the wreck are now displayed at The Whydah Pirate Museum in West Yarmouth, Massachusetts and at Real Pirates in Salem, Massachusetts.

==Archaeological evidence==

Famously, the youngest known member of &quot;Whydah Gally&quot;″s crew was a boy by approximately 10 or 11 years old, named John King. Young John actually chose to join the crew on his own initiative the previous November, when Bellamy captured the ship on which he and his mother were passengers. He was reported to have been so insistent, that he threatened to hurt himself or his own mother if he wasn&#x27;t allowed to join Bellamy. Among &quot;Whydah Gally&quot;″s artifacts recovered by Clifford was a child-sized, black, leather shoe together with a silk stocking and fibula bone, later determined to be that of a child between 8 and 11 years old. His mother&#x27;s account to local port authorities on what John&#x27;s description was like, and especially of note, what he had been dressed in the day of his &quot;kidnapping&quot; by Bellamy&#x27;s crew, included long silk stockings.

==Reaction==
A museum exhibition called &quot;Real Pirates: The Untold Story of The &quot;Whydah&quot; from Slave Ship to Pirate Ship&quot; toured the United States from 2007 to 2014. Venues included: Cincinnati Museum Center, Cincinnati, OH; The Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, PA; The Field Museum, Chicago, IL; Nauticus, Norfolk, VA; St. Louis, MO; Houston, TX; the Science Museum of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN; and Union Station, Kansas City, MO. The venue includes videos, artifacts, educational live personal narrations to include supplementary audio programs, interactive activities, a 3/4 scale mock-up of the rear of the vessel and is supported by costumed actors portraying real-life historical pirates from the ship. A walking tour takes between 1–4 hours depending upon level of interest. The display/show is currently transitioning in preparation for exhibition in CA. In one instance &quot;Whydah Gally&quot;″s brief participation in the Atlantic slave trade was a source of controversy. The Museum of Science and Industry in Tampa, Florida, announced the exhibit and linked it to the 2007 release of &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;. After being criticized for trivializing the ship&#x27;s role in slavery while glorifying its role in piracy, the museum canceled the exhibit.

On 27 May 2007 a UK documentary/reality show titled &quot;Pirate Ship ... Live!&quot; followed a team of divers, including comedian Vic Reeves, in live coverage of a dive at the &quot;Whydah Gally&quot; site.

On 7 January 2008 the National Geographic Channel aired a 2-hour documentary about the ongoing excavation of the wreck. It included detailed interviews with Clifford.

<text>Andrew Meikle (5 May 1719 – 27 November 1811) was a Scottish mechanical engineer credited with inventing the threshing machine, a device used to remove the outer husks from grains of wheat. He also had a hand in assisting Firbeck in the invention of the Rotherham Plough. This was regarded as one of the key developments of the British Agricultural Revolution in the late 18th century. The invention was made around 1786, although some say he only improved on an earlier design by a Scottish farmer named Leckie.
Michael Stirling is said to have invented a rotary threshing machine in 1758 which for forty years was used to process all the corn on his farm at Gateside, no published works have yet been found but his son William made a sworn statement to his minister to this fact, he also gave him the details of his father&#x27;s death in 1796.

Earlier (c.1772), he also invented windmill &quot;spring sails&quot;, which replaced the simple canvas designs previously used with sails made from a series of shutters that could be operated by levers, allowing windmill sails to be quickly and safely controlled in the event of a storm.

Meikle worked as a millwright at Houston Mill in East Linton, East Lothian, and inspired John Rennie to become a noted civil engineer.

He died at Houston Mill and is buried in East Lothian&#x27;s Prestonkirk Parish Church kirkyard, close to Rennie&#x27;s father, George Rennie, who farmed the nearby Phantassie estate by the River Tyne.

In 2011 he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame.

Ascertaining that Andrew Meikle was in poverty, Sir John Sinclair raised for him by subscription the sum of £1, which was invested so as to place the aged mechanic in circumstances of comfort. Meikle died in 1811, and his remains were interred in the parish churchyard of Prestonkirk, Haddingtonshire. At his grave has been raised a handsome tombstone, with the following legend:

Beneath this stone are deposited the mortal remains of the late Andrew Meikle, civil engineer at Houston Mill, who died in the year 1811, aged 92 years. Descended from a race of ingenious mechanics, to whom the country for ages had been greatly indebted, he steadily followed the example of his ancestors, and by inventing and bringing to perfection a machine for separating corn from the straw (constructed upon the principles of velocity, and furnished with fixed beaters or skutchers), rendered to the agriculturists of Great Britain, and of other nations, a more beneficial service than any hitherto recorded in the annals of ancient or modern science.

<text>Leonard Michael Maltin (born December 18, 1950) is an American film critic, film historian, and author. He is known for his book of film capsule reviews, &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide&quot;, published from 1969 to 2014. Maltin was the film critic on &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; from 1982 to 2010. He currently teaches at the USC School of Cinematic Arts and hosts the weekly podcast &quot;Maltin on Movies&quot;. He served two terms as President of the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, and votes for films to be selected for the National Film Registry.

He has written books on animation and the history of film. He has also hosted numerous specials and provided commentary for several films. In 2021, he released his memoir, &quot;Starstruck: My Unlikely Road to Hollywood&quot;. He received the Robert Osborne Award from Turner Classic Movies in 2022.

==Early life and education ==
Maltin was born in New York City, the son of singer Jacqueline (née Gould; 1923–2012) and Aaron Isaac Maltin (1915–2002), a lawyer and immigration judge, as part of a Jewish family, and raised in Teaneck, New Jersey.

Maltin began his writing career at age 10, with a weekly magazine called &quot;The Bergen Bulletin&quot;. At 13, he started writing for the Pennsylvania-based &quot;8mm Collector&quot;, with a column called Research Unlimited, where he answered film questions. He began writing a monthly column for a Canadian publication, &quot;Film Fan Monthly&quot;, edited by Daryl Davy, dedicated to films from the golden age of Hollywood. In May 1966, Davy asked 15-year-old Maltin if he would take over as editor and sold the publication to him for $175. At the time it had a circulation of 400 in 11 countries. He expanded the circulation to 2,000 and continued to publish it until 1974. In the December 1968 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, he wrote an article listing his 75 best movies shown on television and the 25 worst. He also wrote for &quot;Classic Images&quot;.

He created a film society at Teaneck High School and graduated in 1968. Maltin later earned a journalism degree at New York University.

== Career ==
=== Early writings ===
While at New York University, Maltin became film critic and associate editor for the university&#x27;s &quot;Washington Square Journal&quot;, as well as continuing to edit &quot;Film Fan Monthly&quot;. An English teacher at Teaneck High School suggested that Maltin meet a friend of hers at publisher New American Library who was looking for someone to edit a film guide and in September 1969, at age 18, Maltin edited his first book, &quot;TV Movies&quot;, a compendium of synopses and reviews, with the subtitle, &quot;Everything You Want To Know About More than 8,000 Movies Now Being Shown on TV&quot;. In subsequent years, the book was regularly updated and then annually updated from October 1987 until September 2014, each edition having the following year&#x27;s date. The book was later known as &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s TV Movies and Video Guide&quot; and eventually &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide&quot;. In 2005, many films released no later than 1960 were moved into a spin-off volume, &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Classic Movie Guide&quot;, to allow the regular book to cover a larger number of more recent titles.

In 1970, his second book, &quot;Movie Comedy Teams&quot;, was published featuring teams such as Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers and Abbott and Costello. Maltin wrote program guides for the newly created Showtime network and went on to publish articles in a variety of film journals, newspapers, and magazines, including &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;TV Guide&quot;. In the 1970s Maltin also reviewed recordings in the jazz magazine &quot;Downbeat&quot;. Maltin served as the film critic for &quot;Playboy&quot; for six years based on Roger Ebert&#x27;s suggestion. He also wrote &quot;Behind the Camera&quot;, a study of cinematography published in 1971.

=== 1980–2010: &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; ===

Starting on May 29, 1982, Maltin was the film reviewer on the syndicated television series &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; for 30 years. He praised the Tournee of Animation (alongside the Los Angeles International Animation Celebration) on the show at one point or another. He also appeared on the Starz cable network, and hosted his own syndicated radio program, &quot;Leonard Maltin on Video&quot;, as well as the syndicated TV show &quot;Hot Ticket&quot; with Boston film critic Joyce Kulhawik (originally &quot;E!&quot; personality and game show host Todd Newton). Maltin also hosted a television show called &quot;Secret&#x27;s Out&quot; on ReelzChannel network. He also spearheaded the creation of the &quot;Walt Disney Treasures&quot; collectible DVD line in 2001, and continued to provide creative input and host the various sets.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Maltin served on the advisory board of the National Student Film Institute. In the mid-1990s, Maltin became the president of the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and is on the advisory board of the Hollywood Entertainment Museum. For nearly a decade, Maltin was also on the faculty of the New School for Social Research in New York City. As of 2018, Maltin teaches in the School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California. In 1990, he took a look at the MGM years of The Three Stooges in a film called &quot;The Lost Stooges&quot;, available on a made-to-order DVD through the Warner Archive Collection. Maltin left &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; in 2010. His final appearance on the show as a regular correspondent was on July 19, 2010.

He also wrote the introduction for &quot;The Complete Peanuts: 1983–1984&quot;. In 1985, he delivered a three-word movie review on &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; for that year&#x27;s horror film spoof, &quot;Transylvania 6-5000&quot;. The review begins with a silent Maltin swaying to a recording of the Glenn Miller Orchestra playing &quot;Pennsylvania 6-5000&quot;, the instrumental melody interrupted by the sound of a telephone ringing (part of the original recording), after which the band chants the title of the song. In his review, Maltin timed it so that his review began with the phone ringing: &quot;&quot;Transylvania 6-5000&quot; ... stinks!&quot;

Maltin appeared on a week of episodes of &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot; (1987) as a celebrity contestant alongside Abby Dalton. Additionally, Maltin also appeared in &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot; (1990), playing a film critic who blasts the first &quot;Gremlins&quot; film, but is attacked by the Gremlins. This scene echoed real life, as Maltin gave the first film a bad review, finding it mean-spirited, which affected his friendship with director Joe Dante. The scene was spoofed in the &quot;Mad&quot; magazine parody of &quot;Gremlins 2&quot;, in which he protests being eaten as Roger Ebert gives a worse review of the film, only for the Gremlins to remark they are waiting until Thanksgiving to find Ebert, as &quot;he will feed a family of 15!&quot;. Maltin was parodied in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Mecha-Streisand&quot; (1998) where he, Sidney Poitier, and Robert Smith fight a Godzilla-like robot version of Barbra Streisand.

Maltin voiced himself in the &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; episode &quot;Island of Dr. Mystico&quot;, in which the titular villain, Dr. Mystico, abducted him to make use of his film knowledge. Maltin was one of the few people to appear as a &quot;guest star&quot; on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; during its original run; during a Season Nine episode, he joins Pearl Forrester in torturing Mike Nelson and the bots with the film &quot;Gorgo&quot;. He was also mocked on the show for giving the film &quot;Laserblast&quot; a rating of 2.5 stars. After Mike and the Bots finish watching the movie, they express amazement at the rating while Mike reads off a list of well-known films that Maltin gave similar ratings to. Maltin hosted a compilation of National Film Board of Canada animated shorts, &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Animation Favorites from the National Film Board of Canada&quot;.

=== 2011–present ===
Comedian Doug Benson&#x27;s podcast &quot;Doug Loves Movies&quot; features a segment called the Leonard Maltin Game, in which the guest must guess the name of a film based on a subset of the cast list in reverse order and a few intentionally vague clues from the capsule review of the film from &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide&quot;. Maltin appeared on the podcast in February 2010 and played the game himself. He appeared on the show again in August 2010. In November 2010, Benson and Maltin played the game on &quot;Kevin Pollak&#x27;s Chat Show&quot;. Maltin repeated his appearances on &quot;Doug Loves Movies&quot; in September 2011 with Jimmy Pardo and Samm Levine, in September 2012 with Chris Evans and Adam Scott and in November 2013 with Peter Segal, &quot;Werner Herzog&quot; and Clare Kramer.

Beginning in November 2014, Maltin has hosted the podcast &quot;Maltin on Movies&quot;. It began on Paul Scheer&#x27;s now-defunct Wolfpop network, with comedian and actor Baron Vaughn as a co-host. The two picked a topic generally based on what was currently in theaters and discussed three other movies within that topic: one that the two both liked, one that the two disliked and one they thought was a great lesser-known film, or &quot;sleeper&quot;, within the category. Topics included biopics, breakthrough performances and sequels. Maltin currently co-hosts with his daughter Jessie Maltin.

From 2014 to 2019, Maltin hosted the quarterly &quot;Treasures From the Disney Vault&quot; on Turner Classic Movies. The last scheduled &quot;Treasures from the Disney Vault&quot; aired on September 2, 2019. Beginning in 2016, Maltin has served as the Honorary Head Juror of the Coronado Island Film Festival. In 2020, the festival named their top award The Leonard Maltin Tribute Award.

In 2019, Maltin along with his daughter Jessie Maltin created a film festival called MaltinFest at the Egyptian Theater that spanned three days. Special guests included Laura Dern and Alexander Payne. Since 2018, Maltin has served on the advisory board for Legion M.

In 2022, he was invited to join the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences as part of the Member at Large branch.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide&quot; has been praised by comedian Patton Oswalt, who described it as &quot;a paperback Kubrickian monolith of one man&#x27;s massive and far-reaching tastes.&quot; Other admirers include Noah Baumbach, Alexander Payne, and Billy Bob Thornton.

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;A Star Is Burns&quot;, Marge says: &quot;Did you know there are over 600 critics on TV and Leonard Maltin is the best looking of them all?&quot; Lisa replies &quot;Ewwww!&quot; In the 1995 video release of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, there was an interview with George Lucas conducted by Maltin before the start of the films. Maltin is listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for the world&#x27;s shortest movie review; his two-star review of the 1948 musical &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Romantic?&quot; consists of the word &quot;No&quot;.

In 2020, a Leonard Maltin board game was released called &quot;King of Movies: The Leonard Maltin Game.&quot;

==Personal life==
Maltin lives in Los Angeles. He is married to researcher and producer Alice Tlusty, and has one daughter, Jessie, who works with him (his production company, JessieFilm, is named for her). In July 2018, Maltin announced that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease three and a half years prior.

In 1998, Maltin settled a libel suit brought by former actor Billy Gray, whom Maltin identified in his review of the film &quot;Dusty and Sweets McGee&quot; as a real-life drug addict and dealer. The statement had appeared in print in Maltin&#x27;s annual movie guide for nearly 25 years before he publicly apologized for the error.

<doc id="347772" wikidata="Q464056" url="?curid=347772" title="Gala Dalí">
<text>Gala Dalí (born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova, Елена Ивановна Дьяконова; – 10 June 1982), usually known simply as Gala, was the wife of poet Paul Éluard and later of artist Salvador Dalí, who were both prominent in surrealism. She also inspired many other writers and artists.

==Early years==
Gala was born as Elena Ivanovna Diakonova (Russian: Елена Ивановна Дьяконова) in Kazan, Russian Empire, to a family of intellectuals. Among her childhood friends was the poet Marina Tsvetaeva. She began working as a schoolteacher in 1915, at which time she was living in Moscow.

==Marriage to Éluard==
In 1912, she was sent to a sanatorium at Clavadel, near Davos in Switzerland for the treatment of tuberculosis. She met Paul Éluard while in Switzerland and fell in love with him. They were both seventeen. In 1916, during World War I, she traveled from Russia to Paris to reunite with him; they were married one year later. They had one child, daughter Cécile (11 May 1918 — 10 August 2016). Gala detested motherhood, mistreating and ignoring her child. 
With Éluard, Gala became involved in the Surrealist movement. She was an inspiration for many artists including Éluard, Louis Aragon, Max Ernst, and André Breton. Breton later despised her, claiming she was a destructive influence on the artists she befriended. She, Éluard, and Ernst spent three years in a &quot;ménage à trois&quot;, from 1924 to 1927. In early August 1929, Éluard and Gala visited a young Surrealist painter in Spain, the emerging Salvador Dalí. An affair quickly developed between Gala and Dalí, who was about 10 years younger than she. Nevertheless, even after the breakup of their marriage, Éluard and Gala continued to be close.

==Marriage to Dalí==
After living together since 1929, Dalí and Gala married in a civil ceremony in 1934, and remarried in a Catholic ceremony in 1958 in the Pyrenean hamlet of Montrejic. Due to his purported phobia of female genitalia, Dalí was said to have been a virgin when they met on the Costa Brava in 1929. Around that time she was found to have uterine fibroids, for which she underwent a hysterectomy in 1936. She was Dalí&#x27;s muse, directly inspiring and appearing in many of his works.

In the early 1930s, Dalí started to sign his paintings with his and her name as &quot;(i)t is mostly with your blood, Gala, that I paint my pictures&quot;. He stated that Gala acted as his agent, and aided in redirecting his focus. Gala had a strong libido and, throughout her marriage with Dalí, had numerous other sexual partners, including her former husband Paul Éluard. Dalí encouraged her, since he was a practitioner of candaulism. She had a fondness for young artists, and in her old age she often gave expensive gifts to those who associated with her.

In 1968, Dalí bought Gala the Castle of Púbol, Girona, where she would spend time every summer from 1971 to 1980. He also agreed not to visit there without getting advance permission from her in writing.

==Death==
Gala died in Port Lligat in Catalonia, Spain, early in the morning of 10 June 1982, at the age of 87. In the months before her death, Gala had battled a severe case of influenza, after which she began to exhibit signs of dementia. She was interred in the Castle of Púbol, which her husband had purchased for her in 1968, in a crypt with a chessboard style pattern.

==Gala as model==
Gala is a frequent model in Dalí&#x27;s work, often in religious roles such as the Blessed Virgin Mary in the 1949 painting &quot;The Madonna of Port Lligat&quot;. His paintings of her show his great love for her, and some are perhaps the most affectionate and sensual depictions of a middle-aged woman in Western art. Among the paintings she served as a model for are: &quot;Imperial Monument to the Child-Woman, Gala&quot; (1929); &quot;Memory of the Child-Woman&quot; (1932); &quot;The Angelus of Gala&quot; (1935); &quot;Gala and &quot;The Angelus&quot; of Millet before the Imminent Arrival of the Conical Anamorphoses&quot; (1933); &quot;William Tell and Gradiva&quot; (1931); &quot;The Old Age of William Tell&quot; (1931); &quot;The Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus&quot; (1958–59); &quot;The Ecumenical Council&quot; (1960); &quot;Corpus Hypercubus&quot; (1954); and &quot;Galatea of the Spheres&quot; (1952).
Gala served a model for other surrealists, including Max Ernst in his 1924 painting &quot;Gala Éluard&quot;.

===&quot;Portrait of Galarina&quot;===
In &quot;Portrait of Galarina&quot; (1940–1945), Gala&#x27;s face is shown severe and confrontational, her bared breast meant to depict bread, and the snake on the arm a gift of Dalí&#x27;s sponsor Edward James.

==In popular culture==
Gala, played by Dita Von Teese, is a major character in the 2005 short film &quot;The Death of Salvador Dali&quot;.

<text>Crawford Williamson Long (November 1, 1815 – June 16, 1878) was an American surgeon and pharmacist best known for his first use of inhaled sulfuric ether as an anesthetic.
==Life and work==

Long was born in Danielsville, Madison County, Georgia on November 1, 1815, to James and Elizabeth Long. His father was a state senator, a merchant and a planter, and named his son after his close friend and colleague, Georgia statesman William H. Crawford.

By the age of fourteen, he had graduated from the local academy and applied to the University of Georgia in Athens. It was here he met and shared a room with Alexander Stephens, future Vice President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. In 1835, he received his A.M. degree. He began his study at Transylvania College in the fall of 1836 in Lexington, Kentucky. Here, Long was able to study under Benjamin Dudley, a revered surgeon. He observed and participated in many surgeries and noted the effects of operating without anesthesia. Long transferred to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia after spending only a year at Transylvania College, and was exposed to some of the most advanced medical technology of the time. He received his M.D. degree at the University of Pennsylvania in 1839.

After an 18-month internship in New York, Long returned to Georgia. He took over a rural medical practice in Jefferson, Jackson County, in 1841. After observing the same physiological effects with diethyl ether (&quot;ether&quot;) that Humphry Davy had described for nitrous oxide in 1800, Long used ether for the first time on March 30, 1842, to remove a tumor from the neck of a patient, James M. Venable. He administered sulfuric ether on a towel and simply had the patient inhale. He performed many other surgeries using this technique during the next few years, introducing the technique to his obstetrics practice as well. Long subsequently removed a second tumor from Venable and used ether as an anesthetic in amputations and childbirth. Despite his continued use of the ether anesthetic, Long did not immediately publish his findings. The results of these trials were eventually published in 1849 in &quot;The Southern Medical and Surgical Journal&quot;. An original copy of this publication is held in the U.S. National Library of Medicine.

Crawford Long was a member of the Demosthenian Literary Society while a student at the University of Georgia. Long was also a cousin of the western legend Doc Holliday, and may have operated on Doc&#x27;s cleft lip.

On October 16, 1846, unaware of Long&#x27;s prior work with ether during surgery, William T. G. Morton administered ether anesthesia before a medical audience at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. His work was published in the December 1846 issue of &quot;Medical Examiner&quot; which alerted Long to this other claim. Furthermore, the January 1847 issue of the editorial featured more evidence and etherization experiments. Although Long had informed several surgical colleagues who had similarly administered ether in their practices, and performed six additional surgeries since his initial discovery, Morton is generally credited with the first public demonstration of ether anesthesia. After these articles surfaced, Long began documenting the details of his experiments, collecting patient accounts, and notarizing their letters. He reported his own findings to the Medical College of Georgia in 1849. While he was in Augusta, he learned of two additional physicians staking an ether claim – Charles Jackson and Horace Wells. It was at this time that his findings were finally published. He addressed the controversy in his first publication:

A controversy soon ensued between Messrs. Jackson, Morton and Wells, in regard to who was entitled to the honor of being the discoverer of the anaesthetic powers of ether, and a considerable time elapsed before I was able to ascertain the exact period when their first operations were performed. Ascertaining this fact, through negligence I have now permitted a much longer time to elapse than I designed, or than my professional friends with whom I consulted advised; but as no account has been published, (so far as I have been able to ascertain), of the inhalation of ether being used to prevent pain in surgical operations as early as March 1842. My friends think I would be doing myself injustice, not to notify my brethren of the medical profession of my priority of the use of ether by inhalation in surgical practice.

In 1854, Long requested William Crosby Dawson, a U.S. Senator, to present his claims of ether anesthesia discovery to the attention of Congress. Despite his extensive petitioning and documented proof, he never received full credit for his discovery during his lifetime.

Long married Caroline Swain in 1842 and together they had twelve children, seven of whom survived to adulthood. The family moved to Atlanta in 1850, then again to Athens in 1851 to be closer to friends and family. Here, Long and his brother Robert opened a private practice and pharmacy on Broad Street, just across from campus. During the Civil War, he joined a militia unit in Athens, but was never called to duty. Instead he served there as a surgeon to soldiers on both sides. He died of a stroke on June 16, 1878, shortly after helping to deliver a baby. He is buried alongside his wife in Oconee Hill Cemetery in Athens, Georgia. Throughout his professional career, Long was strongly convinced of his calling to serve humanity. He said that his profession was a &quot;ministry from God&quot; and that &quot;his highest ambition was to do good and leave the world better by his labors.&quot;

==Legacy==

Long was the first obstetric anesthetist. In 1845, he had his wife inhale while she was giving birth. Until recently, his practice of using inhalation anesthesia dominated obstetrics. In 1849, Long announced his discovery in a small local magazine. However, he did not receive significant recognition until Marion Sims, a New York surgeon, published the first major article about Long&#x27;s contribution. Today, the majority of scholars concur that Long performed the first successful surgery using anesthesia. In fact, Long administered ether to 7 patients, none of whom felt any pain during their operations, several years prior to Morton&#x27;s 1846 public exposition. One of Long&#x27;s letters is very revealing as to the origins of Morton&#x27;s ideas. He wrote,

Permit me to say then, that a Dentist and a surgeon from Boston, Mass. were in Jefferson Jackson County in 1842, 3 or 4 and remained for several weeks. The dentist practiced his profession &amp; the surgeon operated for strabismus-I have always thought it probable, that the Dentist was Morton or Wells, &amp; that a knowledge of my use of ether in surgical operations was obtained at that time. I have not been able to ascertain the name of the dentist, if you know the history of Dr. Wells, you can possibly asertain (sic) whether he travelled South at the time mentioned.&quot; 

Reportedly, Long failed to publish his findings until 1849 for two reasons. Firstly, he wished to confirm the results of his experiments several times before propagating his ideas. Secondly, he wished to wait to see if another medical practitioner came forward to counter Morton&#x27;s claims to discovery, a physician who potentially discovered anesthesia prior to himself. After reading about Morton&#x27;s demonstration in the &quot;Medical Examiner,&quot; Long began asking his patients to submit affidavits corroborating his discovery. Long almost certainly discovered the anesthetic powers of ether before Morton demonstrated its ability to dull pain during surgery to the general public, but several other men sought credit for their supposed joint contribution to surgery. The men included Morton, Horace Wells of Hartford, Connecticut, and Charles J. Jackson. Throughout what became known as the &quot;ether controversy&quot;, the men vied for a reward of $200,000 from the US Congress. Initially, it appears as though many were reluctant to give Long any credit. William Welch reportedly said,

We cannot assign to him any influence upon the historical development of our knowledge of surgical anesthesia or any share in its introduction to the world at large.&quot; 

In 1879, a year after Long&#x27;s death, the National Eclectic Medical Association declared that he was the official discoverer of anesthesia. At Long&#x27;s funeral, Chancellor Andrew Lipscomb said:

Standing here in the presence of his remains, I am this day but the voice of the church, of his professional brethren, and of this whole community when I say in Dr. Long&#x27;s death we have lost an excellent man. He assumed nothing, and was thoroughly truthful in looks, tone, manner and action; lived simply, treated everyone courteously, and walked humbly before God. Modest even to the verge of timidity, he could be stern and bold, and utterly forgetful of self, if responsibility had to be met, or danger confronted. Gentle, forbearing, faithful to every wise instinct, he kept the covenant of a heart&#x27;s true love until his days were numbered. He had strength of will and power of endurance. The minor heroisms which make up so large a share of a physician&#x27;s experience, and of which the world knows so little, wrote many a paragraph in the annals of his life. We shall give the manly virtues of Christian integrity of Crawford Long a dwelling place where so many of the elect of our life already gathered.&quot;

In 1879, the National Eclectic Medical Association declared that Long was the official discoverer of anesthesia. &quot;Doctors Day&quot; is celebrated on March 30 every year to commemorate Long&#x27;s contributions.

The University of Pennsylvania memorialized Crawford W. Long in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, April 1912, with a bulletin and bronze medallion.

On August 14, 1920, the Georgia state legislature proposed a constitutional amendment to create a new county from the western portions of Liberty County, to be named after Long. The amendment creating Long County was ratified on November 2, 1920. The county seat is Ludowici.

The Emory-University-operated Crawford W. Long Hospital in downtown Atlanta, Georgia was named in his honor in 1931 and retained that name for 78 years. In 2009 the hospital was renamed &quot;Emory University Hospital Midtown&quot;. References to Crawford W. Long Memorial Hospital are retained on exterior monuments.

Long was honored in the &quot;Famous American Series&quot; of postage stamps in 1940, and in 1978 with a postcard.

The Crawford W. Long Museum in downtown Jefferson, Georgia, has been in operation since 1957. A monument in honor of Long was unveiled in Jefferson on April 21, 1910.

A statue of Long stands in the crypt of the United States Capitol as one of the two designated monuments to represent Georgia in the National Statuary Hall Collection (the other is his college roommate, Alexander Stephens). Crawford Long Middle School, in Atlanta, Georgia, was also named in his honor.

Long&#x27;s childhood home was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 6, 1977. It is on Crawford W. Long Street in Danielsville, Georgia. Its coordinates are .

<doc id="347775" wikidata="Q852265" url="?curid=347775" title="Yellow-billed cuckoo">
<text>The yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus) is a member of the cuckoo family. Common folk names for this bird in the southern United States are rain crow and storm crow. These likely refer to the bird&#x27;s habit of calling on hot days, often presaging rain or thunderstorms. The genus name is from the Ancient Greek , which means to call like a common cuckoo, and &quot;americanus&quot; means &quot;of America&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The yellow-billed cuckoo was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other cuckoos in the genus &quot;Cuculus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Cuculus americanus&quot;. Linnaeus based his description on the &quot;Cuckow of Carolina&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1729–1732 by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;. The yellow-billed cuckoo is now placed with 12 other species in the genus &quot;Coccyzus&quot; that was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot. The genus name is from the Ancient Greek &quot;kokkuzō&quot; meaning &quot;to cry cuckoo&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==

Adults have a long tail, brown above and black-and-white below, and a black curved bill with yellow especially on the lower mandible. The head and upper parts are brown and the underparts are white. There is a yellow ring around the eye. It shows cinnamon on the wings in flight. Juveniles are similar, but the black on the undertail is replaced by gray.

Measurements:

* Length: 10.2-11.8 in (26–30 cm)
* Weight: 1.9-2.3 oz (55–65 g)
* Wingspan: 15.0-16.9 in (38–43 cm)

==Distribution and habitat==
Their breeding habitat is deciduous woods from southern Canada to Mexico and the Caribbean. They migrate to Central America and as far south as northern Argentina. This bird is a rare vagrant in western Europe.

==Behavior and ecology==

===Food and feeding===

These birds forage in dense shrubs and trees and also may catch insects in flight. They mainly eat insects, especially tent caterpillars and cicadas, but also some lizards, eggs of other birds, and berries. Cuckoos sometimes congregate near insect outbreaks or emergences, including outbreaks of exotic spongy moth caterpillars.

===Breeding===
They nest in a tree or shrub, usually up to 2–12 feet (1–4 meters) above the ground. The nest is a flimsy platform of short twigs placed on a horizontal branch. The 3–4 eggs are incubated for 14 days or less. The chicks are able to climb about with agility at 7–9 days of age. At about this same time, the feathers of the chicks burst out of their sheaths and the young are able to fly. The entire time from egg-laying to fledging may be as little as 17 days. Yellow-billed cuckoos occasionally lay eggs in the nests of other birds (most often the closely related black-billed cuckoo), but they are not obligate brood parasites of other birds as is the common cuckoo of Eurasia.

==Conservation status==
There is an ongoing debate regarding the taxonomic status of the Western race and whether it is distinct from those birds in the east. This question is significant to the conservation status of this species in the west, where it has declined to a tiny fraction of its population a century ago. Populations of this species in western North America are in steep decline. The bird disappeared from British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon during the first half of the twentieth century. Eastern populations have declined as well, though not as precipitously. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service listed the western Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of Yellow-billed Cuckoos as threatened under the Endangered Species Act on 11/3/2014, and the service also has established 546,335 acres in nine western states as critical habitat for the western DPS of the yellow-billed cuckoo. Controversy over the taxonomic status and heavy pressure from livestock and mining industries caused the Trump administration to attempt to end the species&#x27; protections, and the FWS reviewed the bird&#x27;s listing. In September 2020, the USFWS determined that the western DPS of yellow-billed cuckoo is distinct, and the listing as Threatened is warranted.

<text>Exeter City Football Club is a professional association football club based in Exeter, Devon, England. The team play in , the third level of the English football league system. Known as &quot;the Grecians&quot;, the origin of their nickname is subject to speculation and debate. The club is owned by the club&#x27;s supporters through the Exeter City Supporters&#x27; Trust.

Exeter City was founded in 1901 and began playing their games at St James Park, where they remain to this day. They joined Division One of the Southern League in 1904. After a tour of South America in 1914 to generate awareness of football in the continent, the club became the first side to play a national team from Brazil. As a result, City and Brazilian side Fluminense are now also partner clubs. Exeter were invited to help create the Football League Third Division in 1920. They were assigned to the Third Division South the next year and won the Third Division South Cup in 1934. They remained in the division until becoming founder members of the Fourth Division in 1958. They were promoted in 1963–64, only to be relegated after two seasons. They were promoted out of the Fourth Division again at the end of the 1976–77 season and managed to stay in the Third Division for seven seasons before being relegated in 1984.

Exeter won their first league title in the 1989–90 season, gaining promotion as Fourth Division champions under the stewardship of Terry Cooper. Relegated in 1994, they lost their Football League status at the end of the 2002–03 season. They spent five seasons in the Conference and recovered from defeat in the 2007 play-off final to win promotion out of the play-offs the next year. Manager Paul Tisdale built on this success by winning promotion out of League Two in 2008–09 and Exeter survived for three seasons in League One. Returning to League Two in 2012, they have lost in the play-off finals in 2017, 2018 and most recently in 2020, under Matt Taylor. At the end of the 2021–22 season they gained automatic promotion to League One.

==History==


===Early history===
Exeter City F.C. was formed from two predecessor clubs, Exeter United F.C. and St Sidwell&#x27;s United. Exeter United was a football club from Exeter, Devon, that played between 1890 and 1904. In 1904, Exeter United lost 3–1 to local rivals St Sidwell&#x27;s United and after the match it was agreed that the two clubs should become one. The new team took the name Exeter City and continued to play at Exeter United&#x27;s ground, St James Park, where Exeter City still play today. Exeter United was formed from the cricket team of the same name and were one of the first football teams with the moniker &quot;United&quot;. St Sidwell&#x27;s United (which had also been known as St Sidwell&#x27;s Wesleyans and St Sidwell&#x27;s Old Boys) was a club that had formed from the regulars who frequented the Foresters Inn in Sidwell Street, Exeter, although the public house was always known as the Drum and Monkey. The team played in St Sidwell&#x27;s old colours of green and white.

On 10 September 1904, Exeter City played its first ever competitive match, a 2–1 victory at St James over 110th Battery of the Royal Artillery, in the East Devon League. The attendance was 600, and the winning goal scored by Sid Thomas, who was to serve the club in various capacities for seventy years. City topped the East Devon League with eleven wins, two draws and one defeat in its first season, and transferred to the Plymouth &amp; District League for next three seasons.In 1908, Exeter City A.F.C. became a limited company. City became a full-time professional team, and applied successfully for membership of the Southern League, replacing Tottenham Hotspur.

A wooden grandstand was erected, and the club entered into a leasing arrangement over the ground. On 3 October 1908, City recorded its record FA Cup win by beating Weymouth 14–0. The match was in the first qualifying round. James &quot;Daisy&quot; Bell scored six goals and ten of the goals came in the first half. City changed to its current colours of red and white in 1910. This was after having had a poor start to the season (only two wins out of eleven). City abandoned its supposedly unlucky green and white kit, and turned out for the first time in red and white striped shirts at home to West Ham United on 12 November. The result of the game was a 0–0 draw, but five consecutive league wins came for the club in December, and the change of colours stuck.

City made an historic tour of South America in 1914, during which time it played eight matches against teams of Argentina and Brazil. The last match on this tour on 21 July 1914 was an encounter with the first Brazil national football team playing under the authority of a national football association, in this case the &quot;Federação Brasileira de Sports&quot;, precursor of today&#x27;s Confederação Brasileira de Futebol, founded just the month before. Brazil, featuring its first great star, Arthur Friedenreich, won this match at the Laranjeiras stadium, Rio de Janeiro, home of Fluminense Football Club with 2–0. The tour yielded five wins, one draw and two defeats. The only other loss was in a match that kicked off 12 hours after the players got off the boat. Exeter City were invited by the Football League to become founder members of the Third Division in 1920.
===Football League (1920–2003)===
City&#x27;s historic first match in the Football League took place on Saturday 28 August 1920, when Brentford was the visiting team to St James Park. Exeter won 3–0. At the end of the season, the third tier of the League was being geographically divided, thus City was assigned to the Third Division South. In 1931, City reached the sixth round of the FA Cup, losing a replay 4–2 to Sunderland in front of its largest ever home gate. Fifty years later, City reached the sixth round again, but lost 2–0 to eventual winners Tottenham Hotspur. Earlier Exeter had beaten Newcastle United 4–0 having beaten Leicester City in the previous round.

In the 1932–33 season they achieved their highest position in the League, 2nd in the Third Division South, but remained there because at the time only the champions were promoted. It was the closest they ever came to promotion to the second tier of English football. In the 1963–64 season, City achieved their first ever promotion, going up to the Third Division. However, City were relegated just two seasons later. They would remain in the Third Division until 1977, when they achieved promotion under the guidance of Bobby Saxton.

The end of the 1970s and the early 1980s were regarded as City&#x27;s most successful spell in the Third Division, including an 8th-place finish in 1979–80 and an FA Cup run the following season. Star players included Tony Kellow, John Delve and David Pullar. In 1990, the club won its first major trophy when they won the Fourth Division title. In that season, City won twenty league games at St James Park, and remained undefeated in 31 home matches, including dramatic draws against Norwich City in the FA Cup third round and Sunderland in the League Cup 4th round, both of which featured late equalisers for the visitors. Following that promotion, City rarely shone at the higher level. The departure of manager Terry Cooper and key players such as Shaun Taylor, Richard Dryden, Clive Whitehead, Brian McDermott and Steve Neville left new boss Alan Ball to pick up the pieces. There were some successes under the former World Cup winner — including winning both games against local rivals Plymouth in the clubs&#x27; first derbies for a decade in the 1992/93 season—but Ball left for Southampton in January 1994 and the returning Cooper was unable to save Exeter from relegation.

Back in the bottom division, City struggled for nearly a decade, with chairman Ivor Doble taking the club into administration and starting a chain of events that resulted in the sale of the club&#x27;s ground. In November 1994, the club almost went out of business and sold its stadium to Beazer for £650,000, but were able to stay there after the local council took it over. After nearly two years on the brink of closure, the club came out of administration on 1 August 1996, although the problems on the field were far from over. In 2003, City finished 23rd in Division Three and was relegated to the Conference National; Exeter were the first club to suffer automatic relegation without finishing bottom of the league. City won their last game against Southend United 1–0, but were still relegated as Swansea City&#x27;s victory over Hull City left the Grecians one point short of safety.

===Conference era (2003–2008)===

Following relegation to the Conference, the club was taken over by the Exeter City Supporters&#x27; Trust, purchasing a majority shareholding on 5 September 2003. In May 2007 two of the Directors who had been in charge during season 2002–2003 were convicted of fraudulent trading at the club, John Russell receiving a prison sentence and Mike Lewis a community service sentence. Several million pounds in debt and with no big investor in sight, the Trust kept the club going through fundraising activities amongst rank-and-file supporters. Complex legal arguments with both the Inland Revenue and football authorities meant that City&#x27;s first season of non-league football was plagued by off-the-field uncertainty. The claim was finally dropped in June 2004.

In 2004, a Creditors Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) was put in place to reduce the club&#x27;s debts. Through the club&#x27;s &quot;Red or Dead&quot; scheme, hundreds of fans pledged at least £500 each to fund the CVA repayments, but the FA Cup proved to be the income boost the Grecians had needed, as City drew Manchester United away in the third round of the FA Cup. City drew 0–0 at Old Trafford in January 2005, gaining £653,511 as City&#x27;s share of receipts from the 67,511 attendance. Further income from a televised replay — won 2–0 by United — coupled with ongoing fundraising and unpaid work from the club&#x27;s supporters helped the club to repay its debts, and the CVA was cleared in December 2005.

2004 also saw the club&#x27;s centenary. In May 2004 a friendly fixture was arranged against a Brazilian masters team at St James Park, a celebration of City&#x27;s South American tour of 1914. The Brazilian team, containing such notable players as Careca and Dunga, won 1–0. City&#x27;s first team finished the 2006–07 season in fifth place, qualifying for the play-offs. After beating Oxford United on penalties in the semi-final, City met Morecambe at Wembley in the final, where they lost 2–1 despite taking an early lead. Exeter reached the play-off final in the following season; this time Exeter looked to be heading out of the play-offs after losing the first leg of the semi-final at home to local rivals Torquay United 2–1, but came back to win the second leg 4–1 with three goals in the last 20 minutes. In the final Exeter met Cambridge United in front of a Conference play-off record crowd of 42,511, winning 1–0 with a goal from Rob Edwards, earning promotion to League Two.

===Return to the Football League (2008–present)===

The club followed its success in the Conference by finishing as runners up to Brentford in League Two. A goal from Richard Logan helped Exeter to win promotion to League One with a 1–0 win away to Rotherham United on the last day of the season. 2009–10 was Exeter&#x27;s 45th season in the third tier of English football. They have played more seasons in the third tier than any club who have never reached the top two tiers. They survived their first season at this level for sixteen years by one point; an 82nd-minute Ryan Harley goal against Huddersfield Town on the final day of the season saw Exeter overcome the promotion chasers 2–1 and relegated Gillingham in the process.

The club suffered a tragedy on 10 August 2010, days after the start of the 2010–11 season, when striker Adam Stansfield died of cancer aged 31. As a result, their next fixture against Dagenham &amp; Redbridge on 14 August was postponed as a mark of respect. Exeter recovered well, however, and finished 8th in the league that season, one point off a playoff spot. Following such a strong season, hopes were high for the 2011–12 season, but poor away form (with just two wins away from home all season) saw Exeter relegated to League Two. Relegation was confirmed on 28 April 2012, following a 4–1 defeat away to Carlisle United.

The club remains owned by its fans, through the Exeter City Supporters Trust. During the 2012–13 season saw Exeter have a marginally successful season. Exeter set new club record for away wins in a single season, winning 11 of their 23 fixtures away from home, however, Exeter finished 10th. At the end of the 2012–13 campaign, poor funds and lack of income led to an unfortunate squad trim. In the following season, Exeter finished in 16th.

In pre-season, the club went on a short tour in Brazil to commemorate 100 years since they played the Brazil National Football Team. Exeter drew 0–0 against Fluminense under 23&#x27;s and then beat sides Tupi and a Rio Cricket Club 2–1 and 3–1 respectively. In the 2014–15 FA Cup in the first round, they were beaten 1–0 away to Warrington Town, a club 100 places lower than them at that current point in the season. The Grecians finished tenth in League Two in 2014–15, their play-off push just falling short in the final few weeks. City finished in 14th position in 2015–16, a season that included a memorable 2–2 draw against Premier League Liverpool in the FA Cup.

In the 2016–17 season, City started badly, and were bottom of the league by November. However, a turnaround in form saw Exeter finish 5th in the league, and earn a play-off spot. Following a thrilling 3–3 draw in the first leg of the semi-final at Carlisle, the second leg, tied at 2–2, looked destined to go to extra time. But, in the 95th minute, Jack Stacey&#x27;s long range shot with his weak foot fired Exeter into the final, earning them a spot at Wembley. The final took place on 28 May, and Exeter faced Blackpool. Their hopes for promotion were shattered when they conceded a goal within 3 minutes, and although they equalised, City eventually lost the game 2–1.

In the 2017–18 season, they reached the play-off final, again being on the losing side, this time against Coventry. On 1 June 2018, Exeter announced that, after 12 years as manager, Paul Tisdale had decided not to sign a new contract with the club, which announced that Matt Taylor, a former captain and Under 23 team coach, had been appointed manager. On 26 April 2022, Exeter gained promotion to the EFL League One following a 2–1 win over Barrow at St James Park and went onto finish the 2021–22 EFL League Two season in second place.

==Nickname==
The club is nicknamed &quot;The Grecians&quot;, a name whose origin remains the subject of much speculation. One suggestion is that in 1908 the club voted for the name because of its association with St Sidwells parish. Historically people living in the parish of St Sidwells were said to have been known as &quot;Greeks&quot; or &quot;Grecians&quot;. This is possibly due to the parish&#x27;s location beyond the city walls. For instance, in Homer&#x27;s epic poem the &quot;Iliad&quot; the Greek forces laid siege to the walls of Troy. However, perhaps more plausibly, the association arose because of rivalries between city boys and those of St Sidwells during the annual beating the bounds.

It has also been suggested the name derived from a group of children in St Sidwells who were referred to as the &#x27;Greasy Un&#x27;s&#x27;. A further possibility was that it derived from a jeweller&#x27;s shop in Sidwell Street, close to the ground, which had a clock hanging outside displaying the name &#x27;Grecians&#x27; on its face. Yet another theory suggests that it is a corruption of &quot;Caerwysg&quot;, the Welsh name for Exeter (Caer = fort, Wysg = Exe – fort on the river Exe, similar to the Cornish Karesk). Thus, citizens could have been known as &quot;Caer Iscuns&quot; and so possibly mutating to Grecians.

==Supporters and rivalries==

===Famous fans===
Famous fans include David Earl, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, Adrian Edmondson, Noel Edmonds, swimmer Liam Tancock, BBC broadcaster James Vickery, Spotlight reporter John Ayres, TV presenter Juliet Morris and Hoosiers drummer Alan Sharland. Singer Joss Stone signed up as a member of the supporters trust, being introduced to fans on the pitch as a new member during a League Cup match against Liverpool.

In 2002 pop singer Michael Jackson was made honorary director of Exeter City. He visited St James Park with celebrity friend Uri Geller, who was also a director. The crew of also adopted Exeter City as their home team and use their strip when playing games.

===Rivalries===
A survey conducted by Football Fans Census in 2003 revealed that Exeter City supporters consider their main rival to be Plymouth Argyle. The two clubs first met in a competitive fixture in 1908 when both sides were in the Southern League, and have contested matches intermittently during their histories due to Plymouth Argyle usually being in a higher division. Supporters also share a friendlier rivalry with Torquay United, a club whose supporters view Exeter as their main rival. The two clubs are closer geographically and have met more often during their respective histories, having first played a competitive match in 1927 after Torquay were elected to the Football League. Matches between the three clubs are known as Devon derbies. Despite their on-field rivalry, Torquay helped Exeter during their financial difficulties of 2003 by waiving their gate receipts in a pre-season friendly. This gesture was returned in 2015 when Exeter gave the Gulls their gate receipts as a result of Torquay&#x27;s financial difficulties, having had to close down their academy and terminate the contract of manager Chris Hargreaves.

=== Retired numbers ===

Following Adam Stansfield&#x27;s death from colorectal cancer during the 2010–11 season, the club retired his number 9 shirt for the following nine seasons. From the 2020–21 season onwards, the shirt number is worn only by players from the club&#x27;s own academy. On 2 September 2022, it was announced that Stansfield&#x27;s son Jay Stansfield would return to Exeter City on a season-long loan basis, thus following in the footsteps of his late father by wearing the number 9 shirt.

=== Notable former players ===
Notable former players include Harry Gee, who during the 1927–28 season made 29 appearances for the club and scored two goals. He retired from professional after just one season at the club suffering a career ending broken leg, Gee had formerly played for Burnley. Cliff Bastin, who went on to play for Arsenal and England, Maurice Setters, who won an FA Cup winner&#x27;s medal with Manchester United in 1963, and goalkeeper Dick Pym, who later played for Bolton Wanderers and England. Pym&#x27;s sale to Bolton in 1921, for a fee of £5,000, allowed City to purchase St. James Park.

Other well-known players include the prolific 1930s striker Fred Whitlow, Arnold Mitchell, who played 495 games for City, Tony Kellow, City&#x27;s record goalscorer, Ian Main, the gifted goalkeeper from the club&#x27;s most successful years who died very young, Fred Binney and Darran Rowbotham in the 1980s and early 1990s. Former England winger Lee Sharpe played four games for Exeter at the beginning of their 2002–03 Division Three campaign, scoring two goals. Former City player George Reader went on to referee the 1950 World Cup final, becoming the first Englishman to do so.

David Pleat scored 14 goals for Exeter whilst playing for them between 1968 and 1970. He went on to manage several successful clubs, including Tottenham Hotspur, before becoming a football media pundit for ITV and BBC Radio 5 Live. In recent times, Exeter City Academy graduates Dean Moxey, George Friend, Matt Grimes, Ethan Ampadu and Ollie Watkins have gone on to play in the Premier League, while Danny Seaborne and Elliott Frear established themselves as regulars in the Scottish Premier League. Ampadu (son of former Arsenal and Exeter City player Kwame Ampadu) won his first Wales cap in 2017, and played for his country at UEFA Euro 2020. Watkins, meanwhile, who while at the club was named 2017 EFL Young Player of the Season and left Exeter for a &#x27;club record fee&#x27;, won his first England cap in 2021. Jamie Mackie, who played for the Grecians between 2005 and 2008, went on to play 60 Premier League games for QPR, and picked up 9 caps for Scotland. In a survey published by the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association in December 2007, Alan Banks was listed as the all-time favourite player amongst Exeter City fans.

<text>Parsons School of Design, known colloquially as Parsons, is a private art and design college located in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City. Founded in 1896 after a group of progressive artists broke away from established Manhattan art academies in protest of limited creative autonomy, Parsons is one of the oldest schools of art and design in New York.

Parsons was the first school to offer programs in fashion design, interior design, advertising, graphic design, transdisciplinary design, and lighting design. Parsons became the first American school to found a satellite school abroad when it established the Paris Ateliers in 1921. It remains the first and only private art and design school to affiliate with a private national research university, in 1970 when it became one of the divisions of The New School. Organized in five departments, the school offers undergraduate and graduate programs in a range of disciplines in art and design with students also able to combine additional classes and majors in other colleges of The New School.

==History==

===19th century===

First established in Manhattan in 1896 as the Chase School by its founder, American impressionist painter William Merritt Chase (1849–1916), who led a small group of artists away from the Art Students League of New York in search of a less traditional, more progressive institution. The Chase School educated several luminaries of early American modernism, such as Marsden Hartley and Edward Hopper. But whereas Chase was a talented artist and teacher, he lacked the business acumen to run a growing school; in 1898, under new management, it became the New York School of Art.

===20th century===
In 1904, Frank Alvah Parsons was hired by Chase as a professor at the school. Around the same time, Parsons studied under the tutelage of vanguard artist and educator, Arthur Wesley Dow at Columbia University. He graduated in 1905 with a degree in fine arts and became the sole director of the New York School of Art in 1911. Seeing a new wave of the Industrial Revolution, Parsons anticipated the importance of art and design to industries. His vision led to a series of firsts at the school: he established the first programs ever in fashion design (originally costume design) in 1904, interior design (originally interior decoration) in 1906, and graphic design (originally advertising and commercial illustration) in 1910. In 1909, the school was renamed the New York School of Fine and Applied Art to reflect the new offerings that would combine art and design. Parsons became the sole director of the school in 1911. Parsons advocated for a more democratized movement to design education stating &quot;Art is not for the few, for the talented, for the genius, for the rich, nor the church,&quot; Parsons said in 1920. &quot;Industry is the nation&#x27;s life, art is the quality of beauty in expression, and industrial art is the cornerstone of our national art&quot;. Frank Alvah Parsons and alumnus William M. Odom established the school&#x27;s Paris ateliers in 1921, with assistance from other long-time Parson&#x27;s teachers, including artists Zerelda Rains and Grace Fuller.

Upon Frank Alvah Parsons&#x27; death in 1930, William M. Odom succeeded Parsons as director. In honor of Parsons, whose teaching philosophy and theories on the intersections between art and design steered the school&#x27;s development and reputation, the school became the Parsons School of Design in 1941. In 1942, after directing the Paris location, Parsons alumnus Van Day Truex became director of Parsons until 1952, when soon after he became Tiffany &amp; Company&#x27;s design director and developed the firm&#x27;s signature interiors and graphics.

As the curriculum developed, many successful designers maintained close ties with the school, and by the mid-1960s, Parsons had become &quot;the training ground for Seventh Avenue.&quot; In 1970, through the efforts of future Parsons Dean David C. Levy, Parsons joined the New School for Social Research, allowing for the expansion of degree programs, research, and partnerships. In 1970, Parsons awards the United States first university degrees in fashion design, interior design, and lighting design.

===21st century===
In 2005, when the parent institution was renamed The New School, the college was rebranded as Parsons The New School for Design.

In 2015, Pentagram Principal Paula Scher led the official redesign of The New School&#x27;s identity together with Parsons&#x27;. The aesthetics of the new identity were drawn from the signage and architecture of The New School&#x27;s historic Joseph Urban building as well as elements from the recently constructed University Center building in 2013. The new branding utilizes a font called &#x27;Neue&#x27;, a customized version of the font &#x27;Irma&#x27;, which is the University Center&#x27;s wayfinding font. Neue, which means &quot;new&quot; in German, was designed using a computer algorithm. The proprietary font has been named in honor of The New School, with a nod to The New School&#x27;s progressive teaching philosophy. Pentagram worked with Parsons students to create a special environmental installation at the Sheila C. Johnson Design Center as well as on the campus water towers to introduce the new identity. It was at this time the school reclaimed the name Parsons School of Design.

In 2019, IBM approached The New School to develop university courses and a first-of-its-kind Quantum Design Jam with IBM Quantum Experts, New School students, researchers, and faculty. This led to the creation of Parsons&#x27; first quantum computing course co-taught by Lin Zhou and Sven Travis. Parsons&#x27; Quantum Computing for Design and Social Research project entry subsequently won a FutureEdge 50 Award.

In the same year, the MS in Data Visualization program at Parsons partnered with the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Students were tasked with interpreting data from The Met Open Access API to design creative presentations on their choice of topics. Parsons&#x27; Quantum Computing for Design and Social Research project entry subsequently won a FutureEdge 50 Award. The effort was recognized by The Met&#x27;s Jennie Choi, General Manager of Collections Information, for &quot;revealing connections [the team] didn&#x27;t know existed&quot;.

In 2020, the United Nations collaborated with students from the Global Executive Master of Science in Strategic Design and Management (GEMS), to promote the UN&#x27;s Global Communications group&#x27;s &quot;Decade of Action&quot; campaign. The collaboration focused on human-centered experiences and solutions for climate change and gender equality that would resonate across cultures, generations, and socioeconomic levels.

In 2022, Parsons&#x27; communications design department celebrated its centennial with the book &quot;1, 10, 100 Years: Form, Typography, and Interaction at Parsons&quot;. The department offered the first undergraduate program of its kind when Parsons began teaching courses in the subject 100 years ago.

In 2023, Parsons launched the RMIT–Parsons Ph.D. collaboration as part of the Practice Research Symposium (PRS) program. Candidates will work with faculty from both RMIT and Parsons, but their primary geographical home will be the Parsons NYC campus. The Ph.D. degree will be conferred by RMIT in Australia.

==Campus==
=== University Center ===


In 1967, New School patrons Vera and Albert List helped purchase and renovate a former department store building at 63-65 Fifth Avenue. The building was named The Albert List Academic Center and served as a cafeteria, graduate facility, and research center of the university for many decades. By the early 2000s, then university president Bob Kerrey, wanting to centralize several of The New School&#x27;s disconnected colleges around Manhattan, called for the building to be replaced by a larger &quot;university center&quot;. While the 63-65 Fifth Avenue demolition plans were initially controversial among students and Village residents (spurring several major student occupations of the building in 2009), plans for the building were adjusted in response to student and community concerns. In 2010 the building was demolished and a new design for the proposed University Center unveiled. The New School opened the 16-story University Center at 65 5th Avenue in January 2013. The tower, designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill architect Roger Duffy, is the largest capital project the university has ever undertaken. The building won several design awards including the Urban Land Institute&#x27;s 2017–2018 Global Award for Excellence and the 2015 North American Copper in Architecture Award. In a review of the University Center&#x27;s final design, &quot;The New York Times&quot; architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff called the building &quot;a celebration of the cosmopolitan city&quot;. The building has a LEED Gold certification and incorporates green building methods like LED based occupancy sensors, sustainably sourced materials, exterior brass alloy gladding that shades the building, a restricted 35% total glazing envelope, stormwater retention gardens on its roof that funnel to graywater and blackwater recycling tanks, built-in composting vessels in the cafeteria, and a 265-kilowatt cogeneration plant to offset its energy use from the city. At the time of its completion, it was considered one of the most energy-efficient academic buildings in the United States.

The complex houses the University Center Library, a student dormitory, lecture halls, a 800-seat auditorium, three dining areas, event spaces, computer labs, sewing construction classrooms and workshops, a shoemaking studio, 17 drawing studios, 12 classrooms, and other specialty sewing labs. The University Center also houses part of The New School Art Collection. The collection, now grown to approximately 2,000 postwar and contemporary works of art, continues the school&#x27;s tradition of incorporating site-specific works into its public spaces. The school commissioned five socially-themed frescoes by José Clemente Orozco in mid-January 1931, and to date is the only permanent, public examples of this fresco form from Mexico in New York City. The former Albert List Academic Center&#x27;s boardroom featured the commissioned work by Thomas Hart Benton, America Today, which is now on-view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Recent commissioned works by artists such as Sol LeWitt, Kara Walker, Martin Puryear, Dave Muller, and Parsons alumni Brian Tolle, are complemented by the five new site-specific artworks in the UC by Glenn Ligon, Rita McBride, New School alumni Agnes Denes, New School honorary degree recipient Alfredo Jaar, as well as Parsons faculty member Andrea Geyer.

===The Sheila C. Johnson Design Center===

2 West 13th Street, 66 Fifth Avenue, 68 Fifth Avenue, and 70 Fifth Avenue are a combined complex commonly known as the Sheila C. Johnson Design Center. The largest of the four buildings, 70 Fifth Avenue, is a twelve-story L-shaped building at the corner of Fifth Avenue and West 13th street and was originally built in 1914 as an office and loft building. It housed the national office of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from February 1914 to June 1923. It was also the location for many unions and justice organizations before it was acquired by The New School in 1972, including the American Union Against Militarism (AUAM) (which founded the National Civil Liberties Bureau and later became the ACLU), League for Industrial Democracy, League of Nations Union, New York City Teachers Union and Woman&#x27;s Peace Party.

The complex took on its current appearance in the early 2000s when renovation of the existing structure&#x27;s first and mezzanine levels was made possible in part by a $7 million gift from New School Trustee and Parsons Board of Governors Chair Sheila Johnson. The &quot;Urban Quad&quot; was designed by Lyn Rice Architects and encompasses a total area of . In addition to classrooms and common areas, the building features the Anna-Maria and Stephen Kellen Gallery and Auditorium, the Arnold and Sheila Aronson Galleries, and the Parsons Making Center. The renovated ground floor also contains the New School Archives (previously known as the Anna-Maria and Stephen Kellen Archives), a collection of drawings, photographs, letters, and objects documenting 20th-century design. The building&#x27;s renovation received critical acclaim, winning the 2007 AIA New York Merit Award, the 2008 SARA/NY (Society of American Registered Architects/New York Council) Design Award of Excellence, the 2008 AIA New York State Award of Excellence, the 2008 AIA New York/Boston Society of Architects Biennial Honor Award for top Educational Facility Design, the 2008 Municipal Art Society of New York&#x27;s (MASNY) Masterwork Award for Best Renovation and Adaptive Reuse, the 2009 AIA New York Merit Award, the 2009 National AIA Honor Award, the 2009 National SCUP (Society for College and University Planning) Excellence Award, the 2009 Interiors Selection award from Architectural Record, and the 2009 International Architecture Award / The Chicago Athenaeum award. The building was designated a NYC landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) on May 18, 2021, formally recognizing its history of supporting organizations that advanced justice, civil and political rights, as well as democratic values.

===Parsons East===

The Parsons East building, located at 25 East 13th Street, is home to the School of Constructed Environments, which houses the Architecture, Interior Design, Lighting Design, and Product Design 
departments and studio spaces of Parsons. Additional facilities in this building include fabrication shops like the Laser Lab, the Light + Energy Lab, the E4 Metal Shop, the E4 Open Work Space, the E4 woodcutting shop, and the Healthy Materials Lab (previously known as the Angelo Donghia Materials Library). The Fine Arts department and its student studios are also located in this building.

===Admissions===
The admission rate to Parsons School of Design is 52%. Though students have the option to provide them, Parsons does not require SAT or ACT scores be submitted as part of the undergraduate student application process. Most prospective undergraduate students are required to submit a portfolio of past artwork and respond to a special prompt called a &quot;Parsons Challenge&quot;.

===Ranking===
In 2022, Parsons School of Design was ranked as the top art and design school in the United States in the QS World University Rankings, making this the fifth year in a row the school has held this designation. In the same report, Parsons ranked third globally in the art and design category. In 2021, &quot;Forbes&quot; named Parsons as one of America&#x27;s top design schools. The school has long been prominent for its fashion design program, which is frequently ranked one of the best in the world.

==Expansion and affiliations==
===Parsons Paris===
Under the direction of Frank Alvah Parsons, a satellite school called the Paris Ateliers was founded in Paris in 1921. The following year, the school established its permanent location on the oldest planned square in Paris, the Place des Vosges. According to Parsons, &quot;France, more than any country, has been the center of artistic inspiration since the sixteenth century… The value of associating with, and working from, the finest examples of the periods in decorative art, the adaptation of which is our national problem, needs no comment.&quot; The school offered courses in architecture, interior decoration, stage design, and costume design, adding poster and graphic design a year later. Among its supporters were interior decorator Elsie de Wolfe and author and interior designer Edith Wharton.

In 1931, interior designer Jean-Michel Frank led a group of students at the Paris Ateliers and created the Parsons table. In 1934, Van Day Truex, an alumnus of Parsons&#x27; NYC and Paris programs, became the director of the Paris Ateliers. An influential voice of 20th-century American design, Truex frequently brought in Parisian designers to critique student&#x27;s work. Guest critics at the Paris Ateliers during this period include fashion designers Christian Dior, Jeanne Lanvin, Elsa Schiaparelli, and Jean Patou. Truex directed the school until its closure in 1939 due to the outbreak of the second world war. Parsons restarted its activities in Paris in 1948 offering a summer course combining travel and study. Parsons School of Design reopened the School (at first with a summer abroad program in the late 1970s) and became known as Parsons Paris. In 1980, Parsons expanded its Paris program, entering into an educational partnership with the American College in Paris (now American University in Paris), to offer Bachelor of Fine Arts programs and study-abroad options. Beginning in 1986, students matriculating in the Parsons Paris program were eligible to receive a degree from Parsons School of Design.

When the contract between Parsons School of Design and Parsons Paris expired in 2008, the former decided against its renewal. Parsons notified the Paris school that it could not continue to use the &quot;Parsons&quot; name. The Paris school challenged the decision and brought legal proceeding before the International Chamber of Commerce, which ultimately ruled in favor of Parsons. The Paris school, which continues to operate under the name Paris College of Art, is no longer affiliated with Parsons or The New School. In November 2012, The New School President David E. Van Zandt announced that Parsons School of Design would open a new academic center called Parsons Paris in Paris in autumn 2013. Located in the 1st arrondissement of Paris, Parsons Paris is taught by French and European professors as well as visiting professors from around the world. The school offers a variety of bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in design, fashion, curatorial studies, and business. All classes are taught in English.

===International partnerships===
Parsons has affiliations with schools that operate independently but embrace Parsons&#x27; philosophy and teaching methodology. The Altos de Chavón School of Design in La Romana, Dominican Republic has maintained a partnership with Parsons since 1983, and it offers an intensive &quot;2+2 program&quot; leading to an associate degree in applied arts, with many students continuing on to Parsons School of Design in New York for another two years to achieve their B.F.A. degree. Parsons is working with the recently formed Indian School of Design and Innovation in Mumbai, India with the aim of eventually being able to establish an exchange program. In 2014, Parsons established a pre-college in China called &quot;Parsons Pre-College China Program&quot; in partnership with XNode.

===Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum===
Parsons has a formal research and degree partnership with the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York for a two-year master&#x27;s program in History of Design and Curatorial Studies.
