<text>Andrea de Cesaris (; 31 May 1959 – 5 October 2014) was an Italian racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . 

De Cesaris started 208 Formula One Grands Prix without victory, holding the record for the most races without a win from 1989 until being surpassed by Nico Hülkenberg at the 2024 Miami Grand Prix. A string of accidents early in his career earned him a reputation for being a fast but wild driver.

In 2005 and 2006, de Cesaris competed in the Grand Prix Masters formula for retired Formula One drivers. He died on 5 October 2014 after losing control of his motorcycle on Rome&#x27;s Grande Raccordo Anulare motorway.

==Driving career==

===Pre-Formula One===
A multiple karting champion, he graduated to Formula 3 in Britain, winning numerous events and finishing 2nd in the 1979 British Formula Three Championship, as runner up to Chico Serra. From Formula 3, he graduated to Formula 2 with future McLaren boss Ron Dennis&#x27; Project 4 team.

===Formula One===

====Alfa Romeo (1980)====

In 1980, de Cesaris was picked up by Alfa Romeo for the final events of the 1980 World Championship, replacing Vittorio Brambilla who had, in turn, replaced Patrick Depailler when he was killed during testing at Hockenheim. His first race in Canada ended after eight laps because of engine failure. In his second race, at Watkins Glen in the United States, he tangled with Derek Daly in a Tyrrell at the Junction corner and crashed into the catch fencing after two laps.

====McLaren (1981)====

In 1981, largely thanks to his personal Marlboro sponsorship which also happened to be McLaren&#x27;s main sponsor, de Cesaris landed a seat at McLaren which had merged with the Project Four Formula 2 team run by Ron Dennis after the 1980 season. During the season, de Cesaris proved to be fast on occasion (particularly at fast circuits), but he crashed 19 times that season either in practice or in the race, often due to driver error. The team was so worried that he would crash the car that they withdrew his car from the Dutch Grand Prix in Zandvoort after he qualified 13th. The Italian managed to finish only 6 of the 14 races he started that year. Due to the frequent crashes, he earned the nickname &quot;Andrea de Crasheris&quot;; team boss Ron Dennis grew so annoyed with de Cesaris&#x27;s constant crashes that not only did he not extend the Italian&#x27;s contract, he never actually hired an Italian driver to McLaren ever again.

In July 1981 de Cesaris and Henri Pescarolo finished second to the team of Riccardo Patrese and Michele Alboreto in a 6-hour endurance race at Watkins Glen, New York. Both teams drove Lancia cars with de Cesaris and Pescarolo finishing two laps behind.

====Alfa Romeo (1982–1983)====

After switching back to Alfa Romeo in 1982, de Cesaris became the youngest man ever to take pole position at the Long Beach Grand Prix. De Cesaris was also only the second Alfa Romeo driver to capture a pole since 1951. De Cesaris led the race but as he was passing a backmarker at a tight corner with Niki Lauda right behind him in second, de Cesaris waved his fist at the backmarker and forgot to change gear and hit the rev limiter, which allowed Lauda to take the lead and win the race; de Cesaris suffered rear brake failure and crashed hard at Pine Avenue.

In the 1982 season, de Cesaris earned a podium finish at Monte Carlo and a point in Canada. At the 1982 Monaco Grand Prix, Didier Pironi retired on the final lap due to electrical trouble with his Ferrari. De Cesaris ran out of fuel at the same time, allowing Riccardo Patrese to win his first Formula 1 race.

In 1983, with his Alfa Romeo now using a turbo engine, he took two second places, one at the 1983 German Grand Prix at Hockenheim (his first points of the season) and the other one in the season-closing 1983 South African Grand Prix at Kyalami, 9.319 seconds behind Riccardo Patrese. De Cesaris came close to winning at Spa-Francorchamps, after comfortably leading the Renault of Alain Prost for much of the race before a botched pit stop delayed him and a blown engine put him out of the race.

====Ligier (1984–1985)====

De Cesaris moved to Ligier in 1984, where despite the car&#x27;s promising Renault turbo engine, he scored only three points during the season.

At the end of 1984, de Cesaris and Ligier teammate François Hesnault travelled to Australia to drive in the 1984 Australian Grand Prix, the last domestic Australian Grand Prix before the race became part of the Formula One World Championship in . Driving a Ford BDA powered Ralt RT4 (18 of the 25 car field were RT4s), de Cesaris qualified in 5th place. After entering the pits at the end of the warm up lap, he exited the pits moments before the green flag and was almost a lap behind when the race started. He then proceeded to put in what many consider as the drive of the day to eventually finish 3rd (without ever losing a lap) behind Roberto Moreno (winner) and Keke Rosberg.

In 1985 a number of strong performances, including a fourth place at Monaco, showed early promise but the season turned into a dismal one after de Cesaris destroyed his Ligier JS25 in a quadruple mid-air rollover at the Austrian Grand Prix, and was fired by team boss Guy Ligier as a result. Guy Ligier stated that &quot;I can no longer afford to employ this man&quot;, despite Marlboro paying the bulk of de Cesaris&#x27; salary. He was kept in the team until the next race at Zandvoort, after which he was replaced by Philippe Streiff.

====Minardi (1986)====

In 1986 de Cesaris moved to Minardi. He was often outpaced by his teammate, fellow Italian and F1 rookie Alessandro Nannini during the season. For the first time in his career, de Cesaris went the entire season without scoring a point; he retired from every race but two (DNQ in Monaco, 8th in Mexico).

====Brabham (1987)====

:&quot;Related article: Brabham&quot;

In 1987, de Cesaris switched to Brabham-BMW. With the Bernie Ecclestone-owned team he was able to achieve better results, even though he mostly failed to match his teammate Riccardo Patrese. He did not finish (DNF) 14 of 16 races. At the 1987 Belgian Grand Prix at Spa, Belgium, de Cesaris placed third behind Alain Prost and Stefan Johansson, his first points in nearly two years and his first podium finish since the final round of the 1983 season in South Africa. He would not finish another race that season.

====Rial (1988)====

:&quot;Related article: Rial&quot;

For 1988, Brabham pulled out of Formula One and de Cesaris switched to the new Rial team, run by German Günter Schmid, the former boss of the ATS outfit. With a Cosworth engine in the car, de Cesaris managed to qualify for all sixteen races of the season and take fourth place in the Detroit Grand Prix. He also twice ran out of fuel in the last laps while running in the points, in Canada and Australia.

====Dallara (1989–1990)====
:&quot;Related articles: Dallara, BMS Scuderia Italia&quot;

For 1989, de Cesaris moved to the Marlboro-sponsored Scuderia Italia squad. Early results were again promising. By now one of the more experienced drivers in the field, de Cesaris was on course for a podium position in Monte Carlo, before being taken out by triple world champion Nelson Piquet at the Loews Hairpin. De Cesaris lost his temper after the accident and berated Piquet&#x27;s Lotus team upon returning to the pits. Two races later, after an early delay, he was being lapped by Dallara teammate Alex Caffi when he ran his fellow Italian into the wall, robbing his team of a potential podium. De Cesaris finished third at the next race in Canada, behind Williams drivers Thierry Boutsen and Riccardo Patrese in a rain-soaked race. The race would be the last time de Cesaris stood on the Formula One podium.

With a number of teams using either Ford or Judd customer V8s (Dallara used the Ford DFR) in 1990, the midfield had become more competitive. De Cesaris was involved in a number of incidents during that season, including crashing out at the start of the first lap at Interlagos and at Imola. He also nearly took out the Ferrari of 2nd-placed Nigel Mansell while being lapped during the race, prompting BBC commentator and World Champion James Hunt to call him an idiot on live television. Reliability was a problem for Dallara, and de Cesaris again failed to score a point all season.

====Jordan (1991)====

:&quot;Related article: Jordan Grand Prix&quot;

Dumped for JJ Lehto at Dallara at the end of 1990, de Cesaris was signed by Eddie Jordan for his team&#x27;s first season in Formula One. Jordan had already run de Cesaris in Formula 3.

At the season&#x27;s first race in Phoenix, de Cesaris selected the wrong gear in the short pre-qualifying session, buzzed the engine and was out. De Cesaris showed better form at Monaco, forcing his way past the Benetton of Roberto Moreno and was running in the points until the Jordan&#x27;s throttle cable snapped.

In the next race in Canada he finished fourth. De Cesaris then repeated the result next time out in Mexico. The following race in France he finished sixth. Suspension failure in Great Britain led him to crash but the Italian bounced back to qualify seventh and finish fifth in Germany.

De Cesaris did not score again until the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Franchorchamps. Despite the pressure of being outqualified by debutant teammate Michael Schumacher, de Cesaris moved through the field to take second position until his car&#x27;s Ford HB V8 blew. A communication problem between Ford and the Jordan team meant the oil tank in the car was too small to service a new type of piston ring, which used more lubricant.

De Cesaris finished the season 9th in the standings, his best result since 1983.

====Tyrrell (1992–1993)====
:&quot;Related article: Tyrrell Racing&quot;

Despite Eddie Jordan&#x27;s desire to keep de Cesaris for the 1992 season, financial realities meant it was not possible. Jordan had built up significant debts in his debut season but was able to secure sponsorship from Barclay Cigarettes. However, the brand was in direct conflict with de Cesaris&#x27; Marlboro backing.

Ken Tyrrell hired de Cesaris for his team for the 1992 season. De Cesaris took a fifth in the second race of the season in Mexico, despite being caught up in an early spin.

De Cesaris was able to score points three more times during the season, with his best result being a fourth place in the Japanese Grand Prix.

For the 1993 season, the Ilmor engine had been replaced with a Yamaha V10, which changed the dynamics and reliability of the car. The Tyrrell 020 was also replaced mid-season by the Tyrrell 021 due to age. This car, featuring active suspension, was not a success. For the third time in his career, de Cesaris failed to score a point and left Tyrrell at the end of the season.

====Jordan and Sauber (1994)====

:&quot;Related articles: Jordan Grand Prix, Sauber&quot;

In 1994, for the first time since 1980, de Cesaris started the season without a Formula One drive. But during the Brazilian Grand Prix, Eddie Irvine was blamed for causing a massive accident which saw Jos Verstappen barrel roll over the top of Martin Brundle. On appeal, Irvine was banned for three races. At the Pacific Grand Prix, Aguri Suzuki drove Irvine&#x27;s vacated Jordan. But for the next race, the San Marino Grand Prix, Eddie Jordan brought de Cesaris back to the team.

The return didn&#x27;t start well after de Cesaris damaged a chassis during testing. He crashed again during the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola due to poor fitness, having not driven a race distance in six months. He bounced back in Monte Carlo, where de Cesaris stayed away from trouble and away from the barriers to take fourth place. Irvine returned for the next race but Sauber had noticed the Italian&#x27;s form, and signed him to replace the injured Karl Wendlinger in the Mercedes-powered machines.

De Cesaris&#x27; first race for Sauber was his 200th Grand Prix, in Canada. Although there he retired after 24 laps, he finished in the points at the next event, the French Grand Prix at Magny-Cours.

De Cesaris&#x27; career ended when he retired with throttle problems at the 1994 European Grand Prix. JJ Lehto replaced him for the final two Grands Prix. De Cesaris ended his career with 208 Grand Prix starts, second only to Riccardo Patrese at the time. Numerous other drivers have since surpassed his total.

==Legacy==

De Cesaris participated in a total of 214 grands prix. He achieved 5 podiums, one pole position, and scored a total of 59 championship points. He was the driver with the most Grand Prix starts (208) to his name without a win, until Nico Hülkenberg surpassed him in this respect in 2024. He also holds the records for the most consecutive non-finishes, 18 from 1985 and 1986 (although many of these were mechanical failures), as well as the most successive non-finishes in a single season, 12 in 1987. Similarly, no driver has had more than his 14 DNFs in a 16-race season. He scored points for 9 out of 10 teams he raced for: McLaren, Alfa Romeo, Brabham, Rial, Tyrrell, Jordan, Ligier, Scuderia Italia and Sauber, failing to do so only for Minardi.

==Retirement==

After retiring from motor racing, de Cesaris became a successful currency broker in Monte Carlo. It has been reported that he spent six months of the year in this occupation and the remainder windsurfing in Hawaii, Mexico, and around the world.

==Helmet==
De Cesaris&#x27; helmet was white with three diagonal lines resembling the Italian flag running across the top, and a red line between two green lines in the chin area.

==Racing revival==

Long absent from the Formula One paddock, de Cesaris appeared at the 2005 Monaco Grand Prix, and was welcomed back with a warm hug from former Brabham team boss and Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone. A few months later it was announced de Cesaris would race in the new Grand Prix Masters series for retired Formula One drivers. In October, he set the fastest time in the first Grand Prix Masters test at the Silverstone South circuit in England. Due to his passion for windsurfing, de Cesaris retained a high level of fitness in comparison to other retired drivers. In the first race at the Kyalami circuit in South Africa, de Cesaris qualified well and raced to fourth, after a fierce battle with Briton Derek Warwick.

==Death==
De Cesaris was killed in a road accident on 5 October 2014 at age 55 while riding his Suzuki motorbike. Italian press reported that he died on impact with the guard rail on the outer lane of Rome&#x27;s Grande Raccordo Anulare freeway, in proximity of the Bufalotta turn-off.

<text>Timothy Richard &quot;Tiff&quot; Needell (born 29 October 1951) is a British racing driver and television presenter. He is a presenter of &quot;Lovecars&quot;, and formerly served as co-presenter of &quot;Top Gear&quot; and &quot;Fifth Gear&quot;.

==Biography==
Needell attended Ottershaw School followed by City University, London where he achieved an Honours Degree in Civil Engineering. Hired by George Wimpey &amp; Co, his day job was as a Structural Design Engineer. As a teenager, Needell worked as an auxiliary postman during Christmas in 1967 with one of the houses he delivered to being Bruce McLaren.

===Racing career===
Needell first raced at a driving school at Brands Hatch in 1970. He progressed to Formula Ford, his progress assisted by the use of a Lotus 69 FF he won in an &quot;Autosport&quot; magazine competition. He later sold his Lotus and used the money to buy and race an Elden Mk10. Needell&#x27;s Formula Ford period culminated in his acquiring a Crosslé 25F with which he won the Kent Messenger FF Championship after competing for only half of the remaining season. This success landed him a partly paid drive in the Formula Ford 2000 Championship in a Hawke chassis provided by McKinstry Racing. Needell was completely dominant in that car and series which provided him with the springboard into Formula 3. The remainder of the 1970s saw Needell as a front-runner in the British Formula 3 series and then in the Aurora British Formula One championship. In 1979 he was unable to graduate to the F1 World Championship due to the lack of the correct licence, but he was back in , driving two Grands Prix for Ensign, qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder. However, he had an engine problem and did not finish the race. He subsequently failed to qualify for the Monaco Grand Prix.

In 1988 and 1989 he competed in the British Rallycross Grand Prix in a Metro 6R4 prepared by Will Gollop&#x27;s motorsport team. He achieved a good result in 1988 finishing 4th in the B-Final in what was his first rallycross event, however, the 1989 event was cancelled due to heavy fog after the practice sessions.

Needell made his first appearance at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1981 driving an Ibec-Hesketh 308LM alongside Tony Trimmer. They failed to finish and again in 1982 this time paired with Bob Evans and Geoff Lees in an Aston Martin Nimrod NRA/C2. However the following year Needell finished 17th driving a Porsche 956. In 1985 Needell briefly led the 24 hours driving the Aston Martin EMKA C84/1 and would eventually finish 11th.

His best result at Le Mans was third overall in , on the podium driving a Porsche 962C with David Sears and Anthony Reid.

He then had a couple of years in the British Touring Car Championship with Nissan, before returning to sports cars in 1995, driving a Porsche at Daytona and a Jaguar XJ220 at Le Mans.

He then drove the Lister Storm for five years, reaching third overall at Daytona in 1997 before gearbox problems dropped them to nineteenth. In 1998 he finished fifth in the British GT Championship and won the Silverstone Golden Jubilee Trophy race. That same year, he was to be part of Lister&#x27;s assault on Le Mans, but the car failed scrutineering and thus didn&#x27;t qualify. In 2000, he again drove for Lister, this time in three races of the British GT Championship, winning all of them. He won at Donington Park in the main Lister entry and then competed in two further rounds in the CSi privately entered Lister. Due to the late entry, this car wasn&#x27;t registered for championship points, but Tiff won both races at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps and Silverstone Circuit. He also took part in the 2000 FIA GT Championship for one round at Zolder.

Since then, Needell&#x27;s racing career has mainly consisted of racing closed-wheel cars, with varying levels of success in sports cars, historic racing and touring cars. He achieved particular notoriety after an accident with Nigel Mansell at the 1993 TOCA shoot out race at Donington Park.

===Television career===
Needell is a television presenter and motoring journalist and co-hosted the original run of the BBC TV series &quot;Top Gear&quot; starting in 1987. In 2001, when the BBC cancelled &quot;Top Gear&quot; (the show was revived in 2002 under a new format), Needell and the whole cast defected and signed with Channel 5 to produce and host a new motoring show named &quot;Fifth Gear&quot;. Needell has also co-presented &#x27;MPH&#x27; at Earls Court in 2003, 2004 and 2005 with Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond and in 2006 with Clarkson and James May (because Hammond was recovering from an on-location accident in a rocket car which rolled over at top speed, leaving him in a coma). He also appeared very briefly in the 2005 &quot;Top Gear&quot; Comic Relief special, &quot;Stars in Fast Cars&quot;. In 2009, he appeared on &quot;James May&#x27;s Toy Stories&quot; featuring the building of a Scalextric around Brooklands, and also visited James May&#x27;s Lego house. In 2011, he appeared on &quot;Top Gear&quot;, driving the Ariel Atom V8 in a race against a BMW S1000RR around the Top Gear Test Track. The segment was done in humour, with May supposedly driving the Atom V8, only for it to actually be Needell.

He was one of several people suspected of portraying the elusive masked racing driver The Stig on the current format of &quot;Top Gear&quot;. The true identity of The Stig was eventually revealed as being Ben Collins late in production, necessitating Needell&#x27;s return to &quot;Top Gear&quot; after a nine-year absence to train director Danny Boyle for his lap in the &quot;Star In A Reasonably Priced Car&quot; segment. In the same episode Clarkson referred to Needell as the &quot;Emergency Stig&quot;.

On 22 September 2013, Needell co-starred in Tommy Kendall&#x27;s Fox Sports 1 show, &quot;Driven - A Race Without Boundaries&quot;.

In 2016, Needell announced that &quot;Fifth Gear&quot; had ended.
In 2018, Needell and others announced a new series of &quot;Fifth Gear&quot; was being filmed and will be shown on Quest in September of the same year; however, the 2019 series no longer features Needell in their presenter line-up.

In 2020, Needell featured on a new TV show &quot;Lovecars: On The Road&quot;, which originated from the Lovecars YouTube channel where Needell travels Europe with his co-presenter Paul Woodman to try out no fewer than 50 cars. In early 2024 it was announced that the second series of the show would be broadcast on Amazon Prime.

===Other work===
On 7 February 1999, Needell drove a McLaren F1 XP5 prototype to set the fastest lap record at the Millbrook Proving Ground in Bedfordshire, over a 2-mile (3.2 km) banked circuit, &quot;top speed test:&quot; An average speed of 195.3 mph (314.3 km/h) was attained, with a maximum speed of 200.8 mph (323.2 km/h).

In 2018 Needell started as a presenter with &quot;Lovecars&quot;. mainly for their car reviews on &quot;YouTube&quot;. together with co-host Paul Woodman. Notable reviews include the world&#x27;s first Tesla race car, together with an ongoing series of Tiff Talks, where regular motoring news is discussed.

He writes for the magazine Modern Classic, together with a regular motor racing news feature on Drive Tribe.

Needell has lent his voice to the first and second games in the &quot;TOCA Touring Car&quot; series for British video game developer Codemasters. His voice is also featured in the &quot;Ferrari Challenge&quot; and &quot;Le Mans 24 Hours&quot; video game for racing game developer Eutechnyx. He also features in the video games &quot;Race Pro&quot; and &quot;GTR Evolution&quot; racing an Aston Martin DBR9. Additionally, he is the voice of the &quot;Road Angel&quot; road safety device and GPS speed camera alert system, as well as the face on their advertising campaigns. He was the launching announcer for the high speed Rita roller coaster at Alton Towers, as well as narrating several Discovery Channel documentaries.

Thruxton Circuit has an exclusive deal which enables customers to pay £175 for three laps of fast-paced driving and drifting with Needell. The laps are filmed from within the car and feature his commentary and conversation with the passenger.

Needell has also presented the world series of Powerboat racing throughout the United Kingdom. Working with Greenlight TV and Powerboat GP, Needell regularly commentates, casts voice-overs and interviews drivers. His latest appearance during the world championship race in Nottingham on 1 September 2013 saw the climatic result of the Powerboat F2 Series come to a thrilling end.

==Personal life==
He lives in Wiltshire with his wife Patsy and his three sons, Jack, Harry and George. His younger brother Chris is a team manager for Barwell Motorsports team who currently race the Lamborghini Huracan GT3.

In November 2006, Needell was cleared of &#x27;failing to supply details in relation to a speeding ticket&#x27;, and the accompanying speeding offence by Pontypridd magistrates. He was defended by Nick Freeman, otherwise known as Mr. Loophole, who also defended former colleague Jeremy Clarkson on a similar case.

He is a football fan and supports Southampton. He is also an active user of X (formerly Twitter).

He also works as an after-dinner speaker.

<text>The Church of Saint Joan of Arc () is a Roman Catholic parish church located in Nice, France. Noticeable for its original architecture, the church is dedicated to Joan of Arc.

The style of this church is controversial among the inhabitants of Nice, judged ugly by some. The church is sometime nicknamed &quot;the Meringue&quot; for its white color.

==History==
In 1914, Father Quillery was appointed parish priest of the new parish of Saint Jérome. The first projects for a new church are proposed. French architect Louis Castel initiated in 1914 its construction and built a crypt. After World War I, another French architect Jacques Droz constructed in 1924 a second crypt. Both crypts are the support of the new building. In 1931 a concrete basement is laid over the two crypts. Between 1932 and 1934, the church was built using reinforced concrete. Droz employed the technique of the thin shell concrete for the domes that have a thickness of at the base but only at the top.

==Architecture==
The use of reinforced concrete, a new material at that time, allowed an original construction in a style influenced by Art Deco. Eight ellipsoidal domes support three larger ovoid domes. In the interior, these three large domes are only supported by four pillars, which allows an astonishing interior volume with high vaults. The angular form of the steeple is in opposition with the strong curves of the domes.
The fresco paintings of the stations of the Cross were executed by Eugène Klementieff in 1934. The paintings are influenced by Russian Cubism, Italian Quattrocento and Byzantine Orthodox icons.

<text>The Passion is a huge Passion Play, held around Easter on the streets of a certain city. The event started in the Netherlands as a collaboration between the broadcasters EO and RKK (nowadays between EO and KRO-NCRV) and the local community. In 2016 an American version was staged in New Orleans. The event is considered a missionary chance to pay attention to Easter.

== Creation ==

The event and television is partly inspired by the local event, the &quot;Manchester Passion&quot;, held and broadcast by BBC Three on Good Friday. The production company Eye2Eye Media brought the event to the Netherlands. The first Dutch version was on Maundy Thursday in 2011 held at the market square in Gouda with a live-broadcast on TV. It proved successful and new editions followed in the next years.

Later on, other countries like Belgium (2014) and the United States (2016) followed with local versions of the event.

== Feature ==

=== Structure ===

The event is staged in a main square in a city around Easter.

On this square a stage is built where celebrities tell the story of Easter, on basis of certain passages around the traditional story of Jesus, interspersed with live performances of actual pop songs.

Meanwhile, a group of people carries a huge cross towards the main stage in the center square.

== The city ==

The host city is selected annually on the basis of various factors.

* The recognition among the population. A local theme that ties in with the story of suffering and resurrection, can help. For example, the 2016 USA edition, staged in New Orleans, was connected with the Hurricane Katrina flooding the city and the subsequent rebuilding, literally rising the city again.
* The presence of a large space that can carry up enough people. In this space the stage is built. Also, an overflow area is required to carry the overflow of people.
* The ability to record the different scenes.
* The willingness of the city to provide both financial and practical contributions.

== Editions ==

: Currently in production
: No longer in production

=== Dutch editions ===

The Dutch adaption of The Passion is a project between the EO and KRO-NCRV networks, the Protestant and Roman Catholic churches in the Netherlands, and the &quot;Nederlands Bijbelgenootschap&quot; (the Dutch Bible Society). The goal is to bring attention to the Passion of Jesus and make it accessible to the new generation.

The first three editions were all held in the province of South Holland. The fourth edition, held in Groningen, was the first outside of the Randstad. Since that year the locations have been distributed throughout the country. The 2016 edition was staged in Amersfoort, the 2017 one in Leeuwarden, and that of 2018 in the Bijlmermeer district of Amsterdam.

=== Belgian edition ===

A Flemish version of The Passion was held for the first time in 2014. It was called &quot;De Passie&quot; and staged on Maundy Thursday in Merchtem. The event attracted around 10,000 visitors.

=== American edition ===

In the United States, &quot;The Passion: New Orleans&quot; has been staged for the first time in 2016. On March 20 of that year the first American edition took place in New Orleans, and has been aired by Fox. This adaption also was a musical.

=== Other countries ===

There is also interest from Germany, France, the United Kingdom, South America, Norway and Poland.

<text>Christian Fittipaldi (born 18 January 1971) is a Brazilian former racing driver who has competed in various forms of motorsport including Formula One, Champ Car, and NASCAR. He was a highly rated young racing driver in the early 1990s, and participated in 43 Formula One Grands Prix for Minardi and Footwork between and .

Fittipaldi was fifth in the CART series in both 1996 and 2002, earning two wins and a second place in the 1995 Indianapolis 500. He has also had success racing sports prototypes, winning the 24 Hours of Daytona of 2004, 2014 and 2018, the 12 Hours of Sebring of 2015, the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen of 2013, 2016 and 2017, and has captured two IMSA SportsCar Championships with Action Express Racing during the 2014 and 2015 seasons.

A member of the Fittipaldi racing family, he is the son of former Formula One driver and team owner Wilson Fittipaldi, the nephew of two-time Formula One World Champion and Indianapolis 500 winner Emerson Fittipaldi, and the cousin of racing driver Emerson Fittipaldi Jr.. He is also the first cousin once-removed of Pietro and Enzo Fittipaldi, who are the grandsons of Emerson Fittipaldi.

==Early years==
Fittipaldi was born in São Paulo. He is named after Christian Heins, a Brazilian racing driver who was killed in a wreck during the 1963 24 Hours of Le Mans. Fittipaldi was second in the Brazilian Formula Ford in 1988. After finishing third in the South American Formula 3 in 1989, in 1990 he won the title in the Formula 3 Sudamericana and the fourth place in the British Formula 3.

In 1991, the Brazilian was installed in Europe to compete in the Formula 3000, where he captured two wins and seven podiums in ten races to obtain the championship against Alessandro Zanardi. Later, he was third in the Macau Grand Prix of Formula 3.

==Formula One==

His jump into Formula 1 happened in 1992 with Minardi, one of the smallest teams of the grid at the time; he scored a single point in 1992. Fittipaldi is the first Formula One driver to be born in the 1970s. Next year, he managed to score a total of five points in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, but the team decided to do away with him with two races to go in the season. The following season, he competed in the Footwork team and earned two fourth places, adding to a total of six points in the championship (as those finishes were his only points-paying results that year). At the end of the 1994 season Fittipaldi decided to try his luck in the racing competitions in the United States.

In 2016, in an academic paper that reported a mathematical modeling study that assessed the relative influence of driver and machine, Fittipaldi was ranked the 11th best Formula One driver of all time.

==CART==
Competing mainly in CART, Fittipaldi was a slow starter, noted for his consistency rather than his outright pace, although by the time he won his first CART event at Road America in 1999, he was a championship contender due to his consistent finishing, among which was a second place in the 1995 Indianapolis 500, which earned him Rookie of the Year honors in the race. However, just as Fittipaldi&#x27;s American career looked to be taking off, he broke his leg for the first time (out of the two total he suffered while racing in CART) at the Surfer&#x27;s Paradise race in 1997. Although he was able to return both times and win two races, he never won a CART championship.

==NASCAR==
With his Champ Car career on hold, Fittipaldi shifted his focus to NASCAR. He made three appearances in the Busch Series during the 2001 and 2002 seasons. Although he was not impressive in those races, he was signed to Petty Enterprises near late-2002 and made his Winston Cup debut at Phoenix after he caught the eye of Richard Petty. In 2003, he made his first (and only) Daytona 500 start in a one-race deal with Andy Petree and then made a handful of appearances for Petty in ARCA. In the summer of that year, Fittipaldi became the driver of the illustrious #43 car after John Andretti (cousin of Fittipaldi&#x27;s former CART teammate Michael Andretti) was let go. He struggled and was reassigned shortly after the start of autumn, but remained with the team, driving the #44 car.

==Sports cars racing==
In parallel to his activity in Formula 1, was winner of the 1993 24 Hours of Spa and 1994 Brazilian 1000 Miles.

Fittipaldi debuted at the 24 Hours of Daytona in 2003 with the Bell team, resulting sixth with a Doran-Chevrolet of the class Daytona Prototype. It was one of the pilots that won the 2004 24 Hours of Daytona, in this case with a Doran-Pontiac. Then participated in four other rounds from the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series with Bell, earning seventh in Virginia.

The Brazilian contested the first two races of the 2006 Grand-Am series with Bell, earning a sixth place at Homestead. Then ran six rounds with Riley-Pontiac of The Racer&#x27;s Group, earning a victory in Phoenix, a second place in the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen and third in the 200 Miles at Watkins Glen.

In 2006, Fittipaldi disputed fully the Grand-Am series with the team of Eddie Cheever Jr. Obtained a second place and a sixth, to be located in the 23rd position in the drivers&#x27; championship of DP class. That same year, he participated in the 24 Hours of Le Mans with a Saleen S7, where he finished in sixth place in the GT1 class, a total of eleven participants.

Continuing with Cheever, Fittipaldi achieved a fourth, seventh and eighth in 2007 and resulting 20th in the overall table of the DP class of the Grand Am series. Also, it came tenth in the GT1 class of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, at the wheel of an Aston Martin DB9 of team Modena alongside Antonio Garcia and amateur.

Fittipaldi disputed the first four rounds of the 2008 American Le Mans Series with Andretti Green. Piloting an Acura LMP2 with Bryan Herta, earned a fourth place, a fifth, a sixth and a seventh. Then again disputed the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Aston Martin DB9 of Modena, reaching delayed in the 30th overall position. He then ran in the final five rounds of the Grand-Am series with a Coyote-Pontiac of Cheever&#x27;s team, earning a second place and a sixth.

The driver was invited to run the 2011 24 Hours of Daytona with a Porsche-Riley of Action Express Racing, resulting third overall with Max Papis and João Barbosa among others. In 2012 he participated again in this race with Action Express, in this case at the wheel of a Chevrolet Corvette DP, with which finished fifth.

The Brazilian became in regular driver of Action Express for the 2013 Rolex Sports Car Series season. He achieved two wins at Mid-Ohio and the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen, two second places, a fourth and a fifth, mostly with Barbosa. Thus, he was seventh in the drivers&#x27; championship in the Daytona Prototypes class.

He won the Rolex 24 at Daytona in 2014 in the Action Express Corvette DP with João Barbosa and Sébastien Bourdais.

<doc id="343019" wikidata="Q7417062" url="?curid=343019" title="Sandwell Valley RSPB reserve">
<text>Sandwell Valley RSPB reserve () is a nature reserve, run by the RSPB, in Sandwell Valley, to the north of West Bromwich, in the Sandwell borough of West Midlands in England. It is adjacent to, and shares its main lake with, Sandwell Valley Country Park and near the settlement of Hamstead.

In March 2010 the visitor centre was destroyed in an arson attack. A new centre has replaced it.

==Location==
The reserve is located around the eastern and northern edges of the Forge Mill Lake, a storm water retention basin within a meander of the River Tame. The reserve is surrounded by the West Midlands conurbation and is close to the edges of Birmingham and Walsall, as well as West Bromwich. It is close to the M5 motorway, M6 motorway and the A34 road.

There is a vehicle access to the study centre from Tanhouse Avenue. It can also be accessed via the network of paths crossing Sandwell Valley - with particular ease from the car park serving Forge Mill Farm, on Park Lane.

==Features==

The reserve is of particular importance for its educational work with visiting school parties.

A bird hide, on stilts in the lake and reached by a drawbridge, allows close views of birds on the lake, its shores, and its islands - one of which has been situated directly in front of the hide. There are also a number of substantial screens, which are available at all times and afford good views of birds on the wetland areas surrounding the lake.

The site, formerly a landfill, has been carefully planted with a wide range of native trees and shrubs, to provide a rich and diverse habitat.

The reserve has a pair of entrance gates by the artist Tim Tolkien. The former visitor centre had a carpet designed for the reserve by the artist Greg Poole, but this was lost in the 2010 fire.

==Species==

The lake and smaller pools are home to a wide range of water fowl and also play host to migrating birds. Among the species that attract birdwatchers to the hide are the goosander, lapwings, common snipe, little ringed plover and whitethroat.

The growing bio-diversity of the slopes attracts a very large range of wildlife, and therefore a number of raptors, including buzzards.

Other birds that have been seen on the reserve include Cetti&#x27;s warbler, and a female smew. Common and Mediterranean gulls are seen annually on the reserve. Black-tailed godwits are seen every few years on the reserve.

The main summer breeding birds seen on the reserve include common tern, little ringed plover, oystercatcher and many more. Summer warblers seen on the reserve include sedge warbler, reed warbler, whitethroat, chiffchaff, willow warbler and grasshopper warbler. Coot are a common breeder on the reserve but are often less successful.

Winter bird species seen include wigeon, teal, common snipe, jack snipe, goosander, and goldeneye. Water rail are seen more regularly in the winter with numbers going up to four individuals in 2013.

Some of the reserves star species are the lapwings that breed there annually, but again like the coot, they are less successful mainly due to predation. Ringed-necked parakeets are regularly seen on the reserve.

<text>Roland Walter Ratzenberger (; 4 July 1960 – 30 April 1994) was an Austrian racing driver, who competed in Formula One at three Grands Prix in .

Born and raised in Salzburg, Ratzenberger began his racing career as a protégé of Walter Lechner, joining the Lechner Racing School at the Salzburgring upon graduating from technical school, aged 18. Ratzenberger progressed to Formula Ford in 1983, winning multiple national and continental titles, as well as the Festival in 1986. Ratzenberger balanced his next two seasons between touring car racing and Formula Three; he contested the World Touring Car Championship in 1987 with Schnitzer, achieving four podium finishes in 10 races whilst driving the BMW E30 M3. After finishing third in the 1989 British Formula 3000 Championship and retiring from his 24 Hours of Le Mans debut, Ratzenberger moved into Japanese motorsport with Toyota. Amongst competing in World Sportscar, All-Japan Sports Prototype, Japanese Touring Car and Japanese Formula 3000, Ratzenberger also entered four further editions of Le Mans from to , winning the C2 class at the latter in the Toyota 93C-V with SARD.

Ratzenberger signed for Simtek in , making his Formula One debut at the , where he did not qualify. He made his only Grand Prix start at the subsequent , finishing 11th after starting 26th. During qualifying for the at Imola, Ratzenberger died as the result of a basilar skull fracture sustained in an accident at the &quot;Villeneuve Curva&quot;, colliding with a concrete barrier at in his Simtek S941. He was the first fatality in the Formula One World Championship since Riccardo Paletti in 1982. The weekend became notorious for the fatal accident of Ayrton Senna the following day, with both deaths leading to widespread safety reforms and the re-establishment of the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association.

== Early and personal life ==
Roland Walter Ratzenberger was born in Salzburg, Austria, on 4 July 1960. When he was seven, his grandmother took him to a local hillclimb race at Gaisberg. Ιn 1969, the Salzburgring opened near his home. As a teenager, he discovered that racer and Formula Ford team owner Walter Lechner was based nearby and, while studying at a technical school, began to hang around the workshop. On finishing his education at eighteen, he joined Lechner, who was at this time opening a racing school at the Salzburgring.

In the winter of 1991, in Monaco, and after what Adam Cooper described as &quot;a whirlwind courtship&quot;, Ratzenberger married the former partner of another driver, becoming stepfather to her son from a previous relationship. They were divorced early in 1992.

== Career ==

Ratzenberger began racing in German Formula Ford in 1983, and in 1985 won both the Austrian and Central European Formula Ford championships. In 1985, he entered the Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch in England, finishing second. He returned in 1986 to win the event, before graduating to British Formula 3 the following season. While in the UK, he briefly gained fame for the similarity of his name to that of TV puppet Roland Rat, with whom he appeared in an edition of &quot;TV-am&quot;; the &quot;TV-am&quot; branding appeared for a time on his car.

Two years in British F3 yielded two 12th places in the championship with West Surrey Racing and Madgwick Motorsport. He also raced in other cars besides single seaters, once finishing second in the 1987 World Touring Car Championship driving a Team Schnitzer BMW M3. In 1988, he entered the final few rounds of the British Touring Car Championship in a class B BMW M3, racing for the Demon Tweeks team. The next year, he entered the British Formula 3000 series, finishing third overall, and also raced in the Le Mans 24 Hours for the first time; the Brun Motorsport, Porsche 962 he shared with Maurizio Sandro Sala and Walter Lechner retired in the third hour. He would take part in the next four Le Mans races, with Brun again in 1991, and with the SARD team in 1990, 1992 and 1993.

In the 1990s, Ratzenberger began racing primarily in Japan. He won one race each in 1990 and 1991 in the Japanese Sports Prototype Championship with the same SARD team he drove for at Le Mans. He also returned to touring car racing in the Japanese Touring Car Championship, finishing seventh in 1990 and 1991 in a BMW M3. During the latter year, Ratzenberger tested a CART Lola T91/00 for Dick Simon Racing at Willow Springs.

This paved the way for a return to Formula 3000 in the Japanese championship, with the Stellar team in the 1992 season. His year began poorly but, when the team upgraded their two-year-old Lola for a new model, Ratzenberger won once to finish seventh overall. He remained in the series in 1993, finishing 11th. That year, he achieved his highest finish at Le Mans, as he, Mauro Martini, and Naoki Nagasaka finished fifth in a Toyota 93 C-V.

=== Formula One ===
Ratzenberger greatly desired to race in Formula One, especially as former rivals in F3000, such as Eddie Irvine and Johnny Herbert, had managed to reach the top level while he had not. He came very close to securing a drive with the Jordan team for their inaugural season in 1991. Negotiations were at a very advanced stage when Ratzenberger lost the financial support of a &quot;major sponsor&quot;. In the end, Bertrand Gachot got the seat.

In 1994, he achieved his ambition of becoming one of the few Austrian Formula One drivers. After gaining a sponsor in a wealthy German, Barbara Behlau, who negotiated a deal over the 1993-4 winter, Ratzenberger signed a five-race deal with the new Simtek team, partnering David Brabham.
With a very uncompetitive car, Ratzenberger failed to qualify for the first race at Interlagos. However, the next round at the TI Circuit in Aida went much better, as he not only managed to qualify, but finish in a very commendable eleventh place, even considering that he was the only driver who had raced at the venue before.

== Death ==

===Crash===
The San Marino Grand Prix at Imola would have been Ratzenberger&#x27;s third race in Formula One. During the first qualifying session on Friday 29 April, he asked the more experienced Brabham to test his car out; the Australian vindicated Ratzenberger&#x27;s assessment of the brakes, which had been troubling him at the previous races. According to Brabham, the issue was soon resolved to the satisfaction of both. The session was overshadowed when Jordan driver Rubens Barrichello hit a kerb at the &quot;Variante Bassa&quot; corner; his car, travelling at , was sent airborne, and collided with the tyre barrier. Having received injuries to his nose and arm, Barrichello was transferred to a nearby hospital, and took no further part in the weekend.

The next day, the second qualifying session proceeded as normal until the moment of his accident. Early in the session, Ratzenberger went off the track at the Acque Minerali chicane. With his sponsor in attendance for the first time, and at the halfway point of his contract, he decided to carry on, after checking the car to the best of his abilities. Unknown to him, the minor incident had damaged his front wing; after a spin at the Tosa hairpin the previous lap, as he tried to turn into the high-downforce Villeneuve corner, it broke and became lodged under the car, which crashed into the outside wall at . 

Ratzenberger was transferred by ambulance to Imola Circuit&#x27;s medical centre, then by air ambulance to the Maggiore Hospital in Bologna where he was pronounced dead upon arrival. He had suffered three individually fatal injuries: a basilar skull fracture, which was named as the official cause of death; blunt trauma from the front-left tyre penetrating the survival cell;
and a ruptured aorta.
Ratzenberger was the first racing driver to lose his life at a grand prix weekend since the season, when Riccardo Paletti was killed at the . Ratzenberger was also the first driver to die as a result of a crash in a Formula One car since Elio de Angelis during testing for the season.

Bernie Ecclestone personally delivered the confirmation of Ratzenberger&#x27;s death to the stunned Simtek team. Grieving, Brabham made the decision to compete on Sunday:

Ayrton Senna commandeered an official car to hurry to the medical center; he learnt of Ratzenberger&#x27;s death from friend and neurosurgeon Sid Watkins. Watkins suggested to the inconsolable Senna that he withdraw from the following day&#x27;s race and go fishing instead, and asked him if he wanted to stop racing. Senna famously responded &quot;I cannot quit, I have to go on,&quot; and, having returned to his garage, decided to withdraw for the remainder of qualifying.

Ratzenberger&#x27;s spot on the starting grid was left empty. Paul Belmondo was reported to have been offered the final position on the grid but declined, out of respect for Ratzenberger and on the grounds that he had not earned that race spot.

===Race and aftermath===
During the seventh lap of the race the following day, Senna&#x27;s car ran wide at the Tamburello left-hander and struck an unprotected concrete barrier at , resulting in multiple fatal injuries. When track officials examined the wreckage of Senna&#x27;s racing car, they found a furled Austrian flag. Senna had planned to raise it after the race, in honour of Ratzenberger. The race was won by Michael Schumacher, with Nicola Larini and Mika Häkkinen in second and third positions respectively, while Brabham retired after 27 laps. Out of respect for Ratzenberger and Senna, no champagne was sprayed at the podium ceremony.

The death of Senna, a three-time world champion, mostly overshadowed Ratzenberger&#x27;s: while all active Formula One drivers attended Senna&#x27;s funeral, only five (Brabham, Herbert, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, and Ratzenberger&#x27;s compatriots Karl Wendlinger and Gerhard Berger) attended Ratzenberger&#x27;s. FIA president Max Mosley was also in attendance, noting in an interview ten years later:


Ratzenberger was buried in Maxglan, in Salzburg. Due to drive later that year in the Le Mans 24 Hours for Toyota, Ratzenberger&#x27;s name was left on the car as a tribute, with his friend Eddie Irvine taking his place at the wheel.

===Legacy===
During the customary pre-race drivers&#x27; briefing on 1 May 1994, the remaining drivers agreed to the reformation of the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association, with Senna, Berger and Schumacher intended to be its first directors. The reformed association subsequently pressed for thorough improvements to safety after the Imola crashes and others during 1994; for , the FIA mandated the use of the HANS device, designed to prevent the type of injury suffered by Ratzenberger.

<doc id="343023" wikidata="Q593863" url="?curid=343023" title="IBM DevOps Code ClearCase">
<text>IBM DevOps Code ClearCase (also known as IBM Rational ClearCase) is a family of computer software tools that supports software configuration management (SCM) of source code and other software development assets. It also supports design-data management of electronic design artifacts, thus enabling hardware and software co-development. ClearCase includes revision control and forms the basis for configuration management at large and medium-sized businesses, accommodating projects with hundreds or thousands of developers. It is developed by IBM.

ClearCase supports two configuration management models: UCM (Unified Change Management) and base ClearCase. UCM provides an out-of-the-box model while base ClearCase provides a basic infrastructure (UCM is built on base ClearCase). Both can be customized to support a wide variety of needs.

ClearCase can accommodate large binary files, a large number of files, and large repository sizes. It supports branching and labeling. It enables the correct merging of refactored files by versioning directories. It also supports extensive process automation and enforcement using triggers, attributes, hyperlinks, and other metadata. It uses the MultiVersion File System (MVFS), which is a virtual file system that transparently determines which versions of files and directories should be in the workspace and orchestrates file access and lifecycle. The MVFS is used in LAN deployments for dynamic views and in LAN or WAN deployments for automatic views.

ClearCase also provides authoritative build auditing, which generates metadata for each build artifact, including the context of the build and a bill of materials of files (including the exact version) referenced during the build. This metadata can be used for generating SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) and is important in regulated environments where artifact traceability is essential. ClearCase includes an implementation of &#x27;make&#x27; that integrates with the authoritative build auditing mechanism to ensure build correctness without timestamps and automatic sharing of build artifacts across views (workspaces).

== History ==

ClearCase was developed by Atria Software and first released in 1992 on Unix and later on Windows. Some of the Atria developers had worked on an earlier, similar system: &quot;DSEE&quot; (Domain Software Engineering Environment) from Apollo Computer. After Hewlett-Packard bought Apollo Computer in 1989, those developers left to form Atria. Atria later merged with Pure Software to form PureAtria in 1996. That firm was acquired by Rational Software in 1997, which was purchased by IBM in 2003. IBM continues to develop and market ClearCase. In September 2016, IBM announced a strategic partnership with HCL Technologies that will allow for accelerated development.

== Infrastructure ==

The database system that ClearCase uses is RDM Embedded from Raima. In ClearCase terminology, an individual database is called a &quot;VOB&quot; (Versioned Object Base). On this layer, maintenance takes place using Raima tooling. Around this layer, a set of interfaces with accompanying tools are used to manage the physical database system, which requires specific Database administrator skills.

The most important service is the Atria location Broker Daemon (ALBD), which manages all (LAN) communication between computers. Beginning with version 7, the server platform runs Websphere Application Server with a server application called the Change Management Server (CM Server), which served ClearCase clients via the HTTP Protocol. (Before version 7 there was a web service by which users could access ClearCase via their browsers.) CM server has since been replaced by the ClearCase Remote Client Wide-Area Network Server (CCRC WAN server), which continues to be based on Websphere Application Server.

== Views ==

A distinguishing feature of ClearCase is the MultiVersion File System (MVFS), a proprietary networked filesystem which can mount VOBs as a virtual file system through a dynamic view, selecting a consistent set of versions and enabling the production of derived objects. This was a departure from the repository-and-sandbox model because it enabled the early management of artifacts (that is, before they are checked in) and was not limited to the management of these first-order configuration items.

ClearCase also supports snapshot views, which are copies of repository data. As opposed to dynamic views, snapshot views are maintained on a local (OS-specific) file system and do not require network access. Instead, a snapshot view stores a copy of the VOB data locally on the user&#x27;s computer. Snapshot views can be used while disconnected from the network and later synchronized with the VOB when a connection is reestablished. This mode of operation is similar to that of CVS (Concurrent Versions System) software.

The dynamic and snapshot view types are supported by the ClearCase local client (CCLC). The ClearCase remote client (CCRC) supports analogous view types: the automatic view and the web view. Both are copy-based, but the automatic view uses the MVFS to support local, shareable pools of VOB objects.

From the perspective of the client computer, a ClearCase view appears to be just another file system. New files and directories created in a ClearCase view are referred as &quot;view-private&quot; to indicate that they are specific to the view and not version-controlled. This feature allows build systems to operate on the same file system structure as the source code and ensures that each developer can build independently of one other. At any time, a view-private object can be added to source control and become a versioned object, rendering it visible to other users.

Developers typically have one or more views at their disposal. It is sometimes practical to share views between developers, but sharing branches is the more common practice. A branch hierarchy is often useful: an entire development project can share a common development branch, while a smaller team can share a sub-branch, with each developer having his or her own private branch. Whenever a change on a branch is deemed stable enough, it can be merged to the parent branch.

== The configuration specification ==

Under base ClearCase, each view is controlled by its associated &quot;configuration specification&quot;, commonly referred to as a &quot;config spec&quot;. This is a collection of rules (stored internally in a text file, but compiled before use) that specifies what element versions (files or directories) are to be displayed in a view. To determine which version, if any, of an element should be visible, ClearCase traverses the configuration specification line-by-line from top to bottom, stopping when a match is found and ignoring any subsequent rules. A configuration specification can also reference other configuration specifications by means of an &#x27;include&#x27; statement.

In the UCM management model, config specs do not need to be created or maintained manually: they are generated and maintained by ClearCase UCM operations.

== Builds ==

The networked filesystem provided by MVFS allows for build auditing. Builds in views that use the MVFS can monitor and record file I/O operations performed during the build process and associate each such event with the command that triggered it. This allows ClearCase to produce a bill-of-materials which it calls a Configuration Record (CR) for all builds and enable traceability for either software configuration management purposes or as part of a larger application lifecycle management process. Build auditing is performed with command-line tools such as a built-in make tools (omake, clearmake) or by using the clearaudit command, which can invoke another build tool, such as Unix make (1).

The Versioned Object Base (VOB) that stores versions of file elements and directory elements also stores derived objects and metadata associated with these object types.

The bill-of-materials artifact produced as the result of build auditing is known as the &quot;Configuration Record&quot;. It contains:
* The build procedure: The method (script, makefile, and so on) that invoked the build.
* Inputs: All files (and their specific versions) that were used for a particular build.
* Outputs: All derived object (DO) files (and any dependent DOs) produced as a result of the build.

The dependency information is stored in a configuration record that can be shown for each derived object. The configuration record can be used to create another view that shows all files that have been previously read during the build time. The configuration record can also be used to apply a label to the files (and versions) that were read during the build.

The MVFS allows derived objects that were built in one dynamic view to be automatically &quot;copied&quot; to another dynamic view that requires &quot;exactly the same&quot; derived object. Two derived objects are deemed to be &quot;exactly same&quot; if they have the same &quot;configuration record&quot; (that is, &quot;bill of materials&quot;). The shareable derived objects are physically present in the VOB server, not in the views that reference them. This feature is called &quot;winking in&quot; derived objects and requires that the clearmake or omake tool is used for builds.

ClearCase dynamic views are slower than local filesystems, even with a good network infrastructure. Repeated subsequent builds may run faster, due to build avoidance that is enabled by ClearCase&#x27;s make substitute. Because MVFS requires server access every time a file is accessed, the performance of the file system depends on server capacity.

== Client types ==
Originally, ClearCase supported only full (&quot;fat&quot;) clients running native on Unix and Windows. In version 7, the ClearCase Remote Client (CCRC) was introduced. It is based on Eclipse software and supplied in both fully packaged Eclipse versions, as a plugin-in for Eclipse, and for other environments such as Visual Studio.

== Integrations ==

Other Rational Software products, notably ClearQuest and Rational Team Concert, are integrated with ClearCase. ClearCase is also integrated with Microsoft Visual Studio, Cadence Virtuoso, and the Eclipse IDE through a plugin.

== Database replication ==

ClearCase MultiSite enables developers at different locations to use the same ClearCase versioned object base (VOB). Each location (site) has its own copy (replica) of the VOB. Data synchronization via any protocol can be unidirectional or bidirectional. Synchronization patterns can be one-to-one (two replicas exchange data), ring (round-robin synchronization), one-to-many (replication from a “hub” VOB) or many-to-many (each replica exchanges data with all other replicas).

== DSEE ==

DSEE (Domain Software Engineering Environment) introduced many concepts that were adopted by ClearCase. The Apollo Domain file system allowed special handler programs to intervene during file access. DSEE made use of this feature to invisibly substitute a versioned copy when a particular file was opened. With the versioning specification resident in the user environment, all accesses to versioned files were redirected, including such mundane accesses as printing, viewing in a generic text editor etc.

DSEE relied heavily on a file that described all the software modules and their dependencies. The file had to be generated manually, which was a major impediment to its use in large systems. However, once generated, it enabled DSEE to calculate the optimum way to perform a build, re-using all modules that had previously been processed and whose version specifications matched the specifications for the build.

DSEE also introduced the &quot;version spec,&quot; which was called a &quot;thread.&quot; This was a list of possible versions that could be in the user environment or in a build. A major innovation was the use of build signatures and software release signatures in the thread. The items in a thread might thus be:
* Any copies reserved for editing (i.e. checked out)
* The latest version (usually for developers only)
* A branched version of a file (a version on an alternate line of development).
* A labeled version (for developers working on a particular revision level)
* The version used in build XYZ.
* The version used in software release x.y.z.

Threads were processed from top to bottom for each file. A developer thread might have &quot;reserved&quot; at the top, followed by a labeled version. For a fix to an existing release, the thread would be &quot;reserved&quot;, then the release signature.

In the absence of the invisible file redirection of the Apollo Domain file system, ClearCase uses the virtual file system provided by the MVFS feature that is described below. The &quot;thread&quot; concept corresponds to the &quot;dynamic view&quot;. Support for derived objects in a view is similar to DSEE&#x27;s concept.

<doc id="343024" wikidata="Q741817" url="?curid=343024" title="Samuel Galton Jr.">
<text>Samuel John Galton Jr. FRS (18 June 1753 – 19 June 1832) was an English arms manufacturer. He was born in Duddeston, Birmingham, England, into a Quaker family. He would go on to join his father&#x27;s gun manufacturing company. He was a member of the Lunar Society in December of 1785 and lived at Great Barr Hall, one of the meeting places for the Lunar Society. He also built a house at Warley Woods, and commissioned Humphry Repton to lay out its grounds.

== Family Life ==
Galton married Lucy Barclay (1757–1817), the daughter of Robert Barclay Allardice, MP, 5th of Ury. They would go on to have eight children together. His first born was Mary Anne Galton (1778–1856) who was a writer in the anti-slavery movement. She would marry Lambert Schimmelpenninck in 1806. Galton&#x27;s second child was Sophia Galton who would go on to marry Charles Brewin. His first son, Samuel Tertius Galton (1783–1844) would also become a member of the Lunar Society. He would end the family arms business in 1815. He married Violetta Darwin in 1807 and had a son named Francis Galton (1822–1911) who would go on to be a famous proponent of eugenics.

Galton had another son, Theodore Galton (1784–1810), although not much is known about him. His next child was Adele Galton (1784–1869) who would go on to marry John Kaye Booth, MD, in 1827. Next would come Hubert John Barclay Galton (1789–1864), followed by Ewen Cameron Galton (1791–1800) who died at the age of 9. His last child was John Howard Galton who married Isabelle Strutt. They had a son named Douglas Galton (1822–1899) who became one of the royal engineers.

Galton was a lover of animals and even owned many bloodhounds. He loved birds as well, publishing three book volumes about them.

Galton owned of land at Westhay Moor, Somerset, which he had drained, by constructing Galton&#x27;s Canal.

== The Lunar Society ==
Samuel Galton joined the Lunar Society in December of 1785. Galton would join the Lunar Society as an in-person replacement for Erasmus Darwin, who remarried and moved away. He would be one of the fourteen members to be active during the height of the society. One reason for his inclusion into the Society was his love for statistics and data and his tendency to compare datasets.

Galton also had a great love for natural history, one of the subjects taught in Quaker schools. This, compounded with his love for animals, lead him to write many natural history books on them. His first set was &quot;The Natural History of Birds: containing a variety of facts ... for the amusement and instruction of children.&quot; This was a three-volume set of books intended for the education of children, specifically at first for his children. These were also the first natural history books written with the intent for children to be the primary readers.

Galton would have one more book project intended for younger audiences, and in 1801, &quot;The Natural History of Quadrupeds; including all the Linnaean class of mammalia...For the instruction of young persons&quot; was published. However, only one complete copy of this work exists in world libraries, specifically the Baldwin Library in the University of Florida.

During his time with the Lunar Society, Galton was known as a careful experimenter and a very original man. Some his notable experiments were that of color mixing, which he would publish on August 1, 1799 in &quot;Monthly Magazine&quot;. Galton also showed interest in canals, publishing a paper on them called &quot;On Canal Levels&quot; in 1817. This was for commercial reasons though, as Galton put those before scientific ones more times than not, leading to not many of his contributions being well known or published.

His family, many of which were members of the society, are remembered by the Moonstones in Birmingham and a tower block in the center of that city.

== Galton&#x27;s Gun Manufacturing ==
Galton was condemned by the Quakers for manufacturing guns, as they believed it was against their pacifist values. His defense stated that since Britain was in a constant state of war, it was his duty as a citizen of his country to contribute through its massive industrial complex.

<doc id="343029" wikidata="Q1235634" url="?curid=343029" title="Gospel of Nicodemus">
<text>The Gospel of Nicodemus, also known as the Acts of Pilate (; ), is an apocryphal gospel purporting to be derived from an original work written by Nicodemus, who appears in the Gospel of John as an acquaintance of Jesus. The title &quot;Gospel of Nicodemus&quot; is medieval in origin. The dates of its accreted sections are uncertain, but the work in its existing form is thought to date to around the 4th or 5th century AD.

The author was probably a Hellenistic Jew who converted to Christianity, or, as Tischendorf and Maury conclude, a Christian imbued with Judaic and Gnostic beliefs.

== History and authenticity ==
The oldest sections of the book appear first in Greek. The text contains multiple parts, which are uneven in style and would seem to be by different authors. A prologue found in some versions asserts that the text is a translation into Greek of eyewitness accounts found in the praetorium at Jerusalem. The question of the original language is debated. Beyond Greek, the versions in Latin, Syriac, Coptic, Georgian, Slavonic, and other languages have survived.

The prevailing view is that the work was first devised and published as a confutation to an earlier pagan and anti-Christian work also known as the Acts of Pilate. It can be shown that the work behind the Christian Acts of Pilate must have originated very early, but the complete work in its existing form dates to no earlier than the 4th or 5th century. Although &quot;the Acts of Pontius Pilate&quot; are mentioned by Justin Martyr in his &quot;First Apology&quot; (), this simply refers to unspecified records which Justin assumed must exist. Church historian Eusebius of Caesarea (writing ) shows no acquaintance with this Gospel, despite being aware of related texts (such as the &quot;Letters of Pilate&quot; referred to by Justin and Tertullian as well as the pagan version of the Acts of Pilate). Epiphanius refers to an (), but the extant Greek texts show evidence of later editing.

== Contents ==
The main body of the Gospel of Nicodemus is in two parts. The first part contains the trial of Jesus (chapters ixi) and an account of the Resurrection (chapters xiixvi). The narrative of the trial is based upon Luke 23. In addition to the Greek and Latin witnesses of the first part, there are three other notable ancient versions in Syriac, Armenian, and Coptic. The second part (chapters xviixxvii) contains the story of the Harrowing of Hell. In it, Leucius and Charinus, two souls raised from the dead after the crucifixion, relate to the Sanhedrin the circumstances of the descent of Christ into Hell, and the deliverance of the righteous Old Testament patriarchs. It also describes the salvation of Saint Dismas, the penitent thief. This section is a later addition to the Acts, but is probably based upon an older document. It appears most often in the Latin manuscripts, and only rarely in Greek.

Some Latin manuscripts contain an appended text, the Letter of Pilate to Claudius. This purports to be an official report made by Pontius Pilate to Claudius containing a description of the crucifixion, as well as an account of the resurrection of Jesus. This text is also found in the Greek Acts of Peter and Paul. One series of Latin manuscripts also includes the episode (&quot;The Cure of Tiberius&quot;), the oldest form of the legend of Saint Veronica.

== Significance ==
The Gospel of Nicodemus has had a long history inspiring devotional works. A , drawing in part on this gospel for its expanded anecdotal elements in the Passion, was printed 28 times in Italy between about 1476 and 1500, and inspired the depiction of Christ before Pilate by Pontormo.

The Gospel of Nicodemus names several minor New Testament figures who were not named in the canonical texts; for example, the soldier who speared Jesus on the cross is named as Longinus and the two criminals crucified beside Jesus are named as Dismas and Gestas.

<doc id="343031" wikidata="Q742982" url="?curid=343031" title="Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric">
<text>The Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric (FLRW; ) is a metric that describes a homogeneous, isotropic, expanding (or otherwise, contracting) universe that is path-connected, but not necessarily simply connected. The general form of the metric follows from the geometric properties of homogeneity and isotropy. Depending on geographical or historical preferences, the set of the four scientists – Alexander Friedmann, Georges Lemaître, Howard P. Robertson and Arthur Geoffrey Walker – are variously grouped as Friedmann, Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW), Robertson–Walker (RW), or Friedmann–Lemaître (FL). When combined with Einstein&#x27;s field equations the metric gives the Friedmann equation which as been developed in to the &quot;Standard Model&quot; of modern cosmology, and the further developed Lambda-CDM model. 

== Concept ==
The metric is a consequence of assuming that the mass in the universe has constant density – homogeneity – and is the same in all directions – isotropy. Assuming isotropy alone is sufficient to reduce the possible motions of mass in the universe to radial velocity variations. The Copernican principle, that our observation point in the universe is the equivalent to every other point, combined with isotropy ensures homogeneity. Without the principle, a metric would need to be extracted from astronomical data, which may not be possible. Direct observation of stars has shown their velocities to be dominated by radial recession, validating these assumptions for cosmological models.

To measure distances in this space, that is to define a metric, we can compare the positions of two points in space moving along with their local radial velocity of mass. Such points can be thought of as ideal galaxies. Each galaxy can be given a clock to track local time, with the clocks synchronized by imagining the radial velocities run backwards until the clocks coincide in space. The equivalence principle applied to each galaxy means distance measurements can be made using special relativity locally. So a distance formula_1 can be related to the local time and the coordinates:
formula_2
An isotropic, homogeneous mass distribution is highly symmetric. Rewriting the metric in spherical coordinates reduces four coordinates to three coordinates. The radial coordinate is written as a product of a comoving coordinate, , and a time dependent scale factor . The resulting metric can be written in several forms. Two common ones are:
formula_3
or
formula_4
where formula_5 is the angle between the two locations and 
formula_6
(The meaning of in these equations is not the same). Other common variations use a dimensionless scale factor
formula_7
where time zero is now.

=== 2 Dimensional analogy ===
The time dependent scale factor formula_8 which plays a critical role in cosmology, has an analog in the radius of a sphere. A sphere is a 2 dimensional surface embedded in a 3 dimensional space. The radius of a sphere lives in the third dimension: it is not part of the 2 dimensional surface. However, the value of this radius affects distances measure on the two dimensional surface. Similarly the cosmological scale factor is not a distance in our 3 dimensional space, but its value affects the measurement of distances.

== FLRW models ==

To apply the metric to cosmology and predict its time evolution requires Einstein&#x27;s field equations together with a way of calculating the density, formula_9 such as a cosmological equation of state.
This process allows an approximate analytic solution Einstein&#x27;s field equations formula_10 giving the Friedmann equations when the energy–momentum tensor is similarly assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous.
Models based on the FLRW metric and obeying the Friedmann equations are called FRW models.
Direct observation of stars has shown their velocities to be dominated by radial recession, validating these assumptions for cosmological models.
These models are the basis of the standard Big Bang cosmological model including the current ΛCDM model.

== General metric ==
The FLRW metric assume homogeneity and isotropy of space. It also assumes that the spatial component of the metric can be time-dependent. The generic metric that meets these conditions is
: formula_11
where formula_12 ranges over a 3-dimensional space of uniform curvature, that is, elliptical space, Euclidean space, or hyperbolic space. It is normally written as a function of three spatial coordinates, but there are several conventions for doing so, detailed below. formula_13 does not depend on &quot;t&quot; – all of the time dependence is in the function &quot;a&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), known as the &quot;scale factor&quot;.

=== Reduced-circumference polar coordinates ===
In reduced-circumference polar coordinates the spatial metric has the form
: formula_14

&quot;k&quot; is a constant representing the curvature of the space. There are two common unit conventions:
* &quot;k&quot; may be taken to have units of length−2, in which case &quot;r&quot; has units of length and &quot;a&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is unitless. &quot;k&quot; is then the Gaussian curvature of the space at the time when . &quot;r&quot; is sometimes called the reduced circumference because it is equal to the measured circumference of a circle (at that value of &quot;r&quot;), centered at the origin, divided by 2 (like the &quot;r&quot; of Schwarzschild coordinates). Where appropriate, &quot;a&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is often chosen to equal 1 in the present cosmological era, so that formula_13 measures comoving distance.
* Alternatively, &quot;k&quot; may be taken to belong to the set (for negative, zero, and positive curvature respectively). Then &quot;r&quot; is unitless and &quot;a&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) has units of length. When , &quot;a&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the radius of curvature of the space, and may also be written &quot;R&quot;(&quot;t&quot;).

A disadvantage of reduced circumference coordinates is that they cover only half of the 3-sphere in the case of positive curvature—circumferences beyond that point begin to decrease, leading to degeneracy. (This is not a problem if space is elliptical, i.e. a 3-sphere with opposite points identified.)

=== Hyperspherical coordinates ===
In &quot;hyperspherical&quot; or &quot;curvature-normalized&quot; coordinates the coordinate &quot;r&quot; is proportional to radial distance; this gives
: formula_16
where formula_17 is as before and
: formula_18

As before, there are two common unit conventions:
* &quot;k&quot; may be taken to have units of length−2, in which case &quot;r&quot; has units of length and &quot;a&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is unitless. &quot;k&quot; is then the Gaussian curvature of the space at the time when . Where appropriate, &quot;a&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is often chosen to equal 1 in the present cosmological era, so that formula_13 measures comoving distance.
* Alternatively, as before, &quot;k&quot; may be taken to belong to the set (for negative, zero, and positive curvature respectively). Then &quot;r&quot; is unitless and &quot;a&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) has units of length. When , &quot;a&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the radius of curvature of the space, and may also be written &quot;R&quot;(&quot;t&quot;). Note that when , &quot;r&quot; is essentially a third angle along with &quot;θ&quot; and &quot;φ&quot;. The letter &quot;χ&quot; may be used instead of &quot;r&quot;.

Though it is usually defined piecewise as above, &quot;S&quot; is an analytic function of both &quot;k&quot; and &quot;r&quot;. It can also be written as a power series
: formula_20
or as
: formula_21
where sinc is the unnormalized sinc function and formula_22 is one of the imaginary, zero or real square roots of &quot;k&quot;. These definitions are valid for all &quot;k&quot;.

=== Cartesian coordinates ===
When &quot;k&quot; = 0 one may write simply
: formula_23
This can be extended to by defining
: formula_24
: formula_25, and
: formula_26
where &quot;r&quot; is one of the radial coordinates defined above, but this is rare.

==Curvature==
=== Cartesian coordinates ===
In flat formula_27 FLRW space using Cartesian coordinates, the surviving components of the Ricci tensor are
: formula_28
and the Ricci scalar is 
: formula_29

=== Spherical coordinates ===
In more general FLRW space using spherical coordinates (called &quot;reduced-circumference polar coordinates&quot; above), the surviving components of the Ricci tensor are

: formula_30
: formula_31
: formula_32
: formula_33
and the Ricci scalar is 
: formula_34

== Name and history ==
In 1922 and 1924 the Soviet mathematician Alexander Friedmann and in 1927, Georges Lemaître, a Belgian priest, astronomer and periodic professor of physics at the Catholic University of Leuven, arrived independently at results that relied on the metric.
Howard P. Robertson from the US and Arthur Geoffrey Walker from the UK explored the problem further during the 1930s. In 1935 Robertson and Walker rigorously proved that the FLRW metric is the only one on a spacetime that is spatially homogeneous and isotropic (as noted above, this is a geometric result and is not tied specifically to the equations of general relativity, which were always assumed by Friedmann and Lemaître).

This solution, often called the Robertson–Walker &quot;metric&quot; since they proved its generic properties, is different from the dynamical &quot;Friedmann–Lemaître&quot; &quot;models&quot;, which are specific solutions for &quot;a&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) that assume that the only contributions to stress–energy are cold matter (&quot;dust&quot;), radiation, and a cosmological constant.

== Current status ==

The current standard model of cosmology, the Lambda-CDM model, uses the FLRW metric. By combining the observation data from some experiments such as WMAP and Planck with theoretical results of Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem and its generalization, astrophysicists now agree that the early universe is almost homogeneous and isotropic (when averaged over a very large scale) and thus nearly a FLRW spacetime. That being said, attempts to confirm the purely kinematic interpretation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) dipole through studies of radio galaxies and quasars show disagreement in the magnitude. Taken at face value, these observations are at odds with the Universe being described by the FLRW metric. Moreover, one can argue that there is a maximum value to the Hubble constant within an FLRW cosmology tolerated by current observations, formula_35 = , and depending on how local determinations converge, this may point to a breakdown of the FLRW metric in the late universe, necessitating an explanation beyond the FLRW metric.

<doc id="343037" wikidata="Q697831" url="?curid=343037" title="Vienna Genesis">
<text>The Vienna Genesis (Vienna, Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, cod. theol. gr. 31), designated by siglum L (Ralphs), is an illuminated manuscript, probably produced in Syria in the first half of the 6th century. It is one of the oldest well-preserved, surviving, illustrated biblical codices; only the Garima Gospels of Ethiopia, dating to the 5th and 6th centuries, are as old or older.

The surviving text is part of the Book of Genesis in the Greek Septuagint translation. The text is frequently abbreviated. There are twenty-four surviving folios each with miniatures at the bottom of both sides. It is thought that there were originally about ninety-six folios and 192 illustrations. It is written in uncials with silver ink on calfskin vellum (on page 36 of &quot;The Vienna Genesis. Material analysis and conservation of a late antique illuminated manuscript on purple parchment&quot; states &quot;The parchment of Late Antique manuscripts, which date from the 4th–7th century, is made from sheepskin&quot; despite the fact it is called vellum. Its being called vellum is misleading as it would have been lambskin not calfskin, to which vellum specifically applies) dyed a rich purple, placing it very firmly in the category of luxury manuscripts. This shade of purple dye was also used to dye imperial cloth.

The Vienna Genesis relates to the Rossano Gospels and the Sinope Gospels, from roughly the same period.

==Description==
The illustrations are done in a naturalistic style typical of Late Antique painting. The manuscript&#x27;s illustrations are, in format, transitional between those found in scrolls and later images found in codices. Each illustration is painted at the bottom of a single page. However, within a single illustration, two or more episodes from a story may be included, so that the same person may be represented multiple times within a single illustration. There are both framed and unframed illustrations. The illustrations contain incidents and people not mentioned in the text of Genesis. These incidents are thought to have been derived from popular elaborations of the story or from Jewish commentaries on the text.

&quot;Rebecca and Eliezer at the Well&quot; shows the story of Genesis 24, in which Abraham&#x27;s servant, Eliezer, goes to look for a wife for Abraham&#x27;s son, Isaac. As he travels with ten of Abraham&#x27;s camels, he stops to give them water, prays that Isaac&#x27;s future wife will assist him with watering his camels, and Rebecca shows up to help Eliezer. Rebecca is depicted twice to illustrate the continued narrative. She wears a pink dress and is depicted walking from a city in the background, holding a water jug on her shoulder, towards a body of water, next to which lounges a classically inspired female personification. Rebecca is illustrated a second time at the well with Eliezer.

The illustration of &quot;Jacob Wrestling The Angel&quot; depicts a scene from Genesis 32, where Jacob wrestles with an angel all night. In the illustration, Jacob is shown holding onto the angel&#x27;s cloak while the angel reaches out to touch him. Similar to &quot;Rebecca at the Well&quot;, the figures are painted in profile, with elongated bodies and exaggerated facial features. The use of gold and silver paint, as well as intricate detailing in the clothing and hair, adds to the richness of the image. The story follows Jacob, in the brown and reddish tunic, who wakes up and leads his family across the river. In his trail following him are his wives on donkeys and many servants. After crossing the river Jacob is then seen meeting an angel, seen wrestling the angel, and then the angel blesses him. There are multiple depictions of Jacob shown here to show multiple points of the story. From this story, as read in Genesis the book, Jacob is therefore blessed as Israel, and is blessed by God for the rest of his life. The bridge&#x27;s architectural forms include a colonnade with Roman columns which references classical architecture as it adapts to the scroll perspective.

The initial iota and upsilon have the diaeresis.

<text>A chief operating officer (COO), also called chief operations officer, is an executive in charge of the daily operations of an organization (i.e. personnel, resources, and logistics). COOs are usually second-in-command immediately after the CEO, and report directly to them, acting on their behalf in their absence.

In some situations, for example where a COO is appointed as the CEO&#x27;s successor, the position may be appointed by the board of directors.

==Responsibilities and similar titles==
Unlike other C-suite positions, which tend to be defined according to commonly designated responsibilities across most companies, a COO&#x27;s job tends to be defined in relation to the specific CEO with whom they work, given the close working relationship of these two individuals.

The selection of a COO is similar in many ways to the selection of a vice president or chief of staff of the United States: power and responsibility structures vary in government and private regimes depending on the style and needs of the president or CEO. Thus, the COO role meets individual expectations and changes as leadership teams adjust.

The COO position is common in firms that are operationally intensive, such as airline and automotive industries.

===President===
In a similar vein to the COO, the title of corporate president as a separate position (as opposed to being combined with a &quot;C-suite&quot; designation, such as &quot;president and CEO&quot; or &quot;president and COO&quot;) is also loosely defined. The president is usually the legally recognized highest rank of corporate officer, ranking above the various vice presidents (including senior vice president and executive vice president), but on its own generally considered subordinate, in practice, to the CEO.

Lloyd E. Reuss was president of General Motors from 1990 to 1992, as the right-hand man of chairman and CEO Robert C. Stempel. Stempel insisted on naming Reuss as company president in charge of North American operations, the board reluctantly agreed but showed their displeasure by not giving Reuss the title of COO.

Richard D. Parsons was number two in the company hierarchy during his tenure as president of Time Warner from 1995 to 2001, but he had no authority over the operating divisions, and instead took on assignments at the behest of chairman and CEO Gerald Levin.

Michael Capellas was appointed president of Hewlett-Packard in order to ease its acquisition and integration of Compaq, where Capellas was previously chairman and CEO. Capellas ended up serving just six months as HP president before departing. His former role of president was not filled as the executives who reported to him then reported directly to the CEO.

In 2007, the investment banking firms of Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley each had two presidents (Warren Spector and Alan Schwartz at Bear, Robert Scully and Zoe Cruz at Morgan) reporting to one CEO (who was also chairman of the board); each president was essentially a co-COO (despite the lack of title) overseeing half of the firm&#x27;s business divisions. Schwartz became sole president of Bear after Spector was ousted, and several months later assumed the position of CEO as well when James Cayne was forced to resign (Cayne remained chairman).

Tom Anselmi of Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment was chief operating officer from 2004 until September 6, 2013. Between the departure of Richard Peddie and the hiring of Tim Leiweke for the posts of president and CEO, Anselmi added the title of president from September 4, 2012, to June 30, 2013, however he remained COO and did not receive the title of CEO.

Richard Fuld, the chairman and CEO of Lehman Brothers, had a succession of &quot;number twos&quot; under him, usually titled as president and chief operating officer. Chris Pettit was Fuld&#x27;s second-in-command for two decades until November 26, 1996, when he resigned as president and board member. Pettit lost a power struggle with his deputies (Steve Lessing, Tom Tucker, and Joseph M. Gregory) on March 15 that year that caused him to relinquish its COO title, likely brought about after the three men found about Pettit&#x27;s extramarital affairs, which violated Fuld&#x27;s unwritten rules on marriage and social etiquette. Bradley Jack and Joseph M. Gregory were appointed co-COOs in 2002, but Jack was demoted to the office of the chairman in May 2004 and departed in June 2005 with a severance package of $80 million, making Gregory the sole COO. While Fuld was considered the &quot;face&quot; of Lehman brothers, Gregory was in charge of day-to-day operations and he influenced culture to drive the bottom line. Gregory was demoted on June 12, 2008, and replaced as president and COO by Bart McDade, who had been serving as head of Equities, and McDade would see Lehman through bankruptcy.

Thomas W. LaSorda served as president and CEO of Chrysler from January 1, 2006, to August 5, 2007, while Chrysler was owned by Daimler-Benz. When Cerberus Capital bought majority control of Chrysler, Bob Nardelli was appointed chairman and CEO of Chrysler, while LaSorda became vice chairman and president. Despite the appointment of a second vice chairman and president, Jim Press, LaSorda stayed on. LaSorda&#x27;s titles as vice chairman and president officially stated that he was in charge of manufacturing, procurement and supply, employee relations, global business development and alliances. However, LaSorda&#x27;s actual role was to find a new partner or buyer for Chrysler, leading to speculation that Cerberus Capital was less interested in rebuilding the auto manufacturer than it was to turning profit though a leveraged buyout.

Research in Motion&#x27;s corporate structure had more than one COO, including Jim Rowan as chief operating officer for global operations, and Thorsten Heins as COO of products and sales.

The Walt Disney Company has used the president and COO titles in varied ways for their number two executive. Ron W. Miller was president from 1978 to 1984, while serving additionally as CEO for 18 months from 1983 to 1984. Frank Wells was president from 1984 to 1994, where he reported to the board of directors and not chairman and CEO Michael Eisner. When Wells died in a helicopter crash, no replacement president was named as his duties were resumed by Eisner. Michael Ovitz was president from 1995 to 1997, being hired by Eisner and then dismissed not long afterwards. Bob Iger was president and COO from 2000 to 2005, when he succeeded Eisner as CEO. Thomas O. Staggs was COO from 2015 to 2016, during that time the senior executive team had a dual reporting structure to both Staggs and Iger; Staggs resigned after the board did not give him assurances that he would succeed as CEO.

Manulife has used the president and COO titles for separate roles. From June 5 until September 30, 2017, Rocco &quot;Roy&quot; Gori served as president where he oversaw Manulife&#x27;s global operating businesses, with his subordinates being the general managers of the Canadian, U.S., and Asia Divisions, and the chief investment officer. Gori reported to chief executive officer Donald Guloien before additionally assuming the title of CEO on October 1, 2017, upon Guloien&#x27;s retirement. Linda Mantia, the chief operating officer, reported to the president on corporate strategy while continuing to report to the CEO on all other matters including corporate development, Analytics, Technology, Marketing, Innovation, human resources, regulatory and public affairs, global resourcing and procurement, and the global program office.

At the World Bank, the president outranks the other executives including the CEO and chief economist.

===Current situation===
Most modern companies operate without a COO. For example, in 2007 almost 58% of Fortune 500 companies did not have a COO. In these instances the CEO either takes on more roles and responsibilities, or the roles traditionally assigned to the COO are carried out by sub C-suite executives. Although the number of COOs has been in decline for the past 10 years, there are reasons to anticipate an increased utilization of the position in the future, including:
* Companies are becoming larger and more complex, making it more difficult for one person alone to have total oversight over the whole organization.
* Companies are finding a strong relationship between firm performance and the presence of a COO.
* Companies are becoming more deliberate about CEO succession planning and will use the role to on-board and train successors.
* The increase in talent mobility means that the role will likely be used more often as a retention mechanism for key executives who are at risk of moving to a competitor.

==Roles and functions==

The role of the COO differs from industry to industry and from organization to organization. Some organizations function without a COO. Others may have two COOs, each assigned to oversee several business lines or divisions, such as Lehman Brothers from 2002 to 2004 when Bradley Jack and Joseph M. Gregory were the co-COOs. A COO could also be brought in from other organizations as a &quot;fixer&quot;, such as Daniel J. O&#x27;Neill who in 1999 joined Molson in that capacity.

In the manufacturing sector, the primary role of the COO is routinely one of operations management, meaning that the COO is responsible for the development, design, operation, and improvement of the systems that create and deliver the firm&#x27;s products. The COO is responsible for ensuring that business operations are efficient and effective and that the proper management of resources, distribution of goods and services to customers and analysis of queue systems is conducted.

Despite the functional diversity associated with the role of COO, there are some common functions the COOs usually perform:
* At the direction of the CEO and board of directors, marshalling limited resources to the most productive uses with the aim of creating maximum value for the company&#x27;s stakeholders
* Developing and cascading the organization&#x27;s strategy/mission statement to the lower-ranking staff, and implementing appropriate rewards/recognition and coaching or corrective practices to align personnel with company goals
* Planning by prioritizing customer, employee, and organizational requirements
* Maintaining and monitoring staffing, levels, knowledge-skills-attributes (KSA), expectations and motivation to fulfill organizational requirements
* Driving performance measures for the operation (including a consideration of efficiency versus effectiveness), often in the form of dashboards convenient for review of high level key indicators

===COO as successor===
Routinely in large organizations the COO will be the heir apparent to the CEO. Individuals may have worked their way (internally) up the company ladder before being named COO, or may have been recruited from an outside company. Either way, the position is used as a training and testing ground for the next CEO.

A 2003 Crist Associates study revealed that only 17% of companies that promote a COO to a CEO replace the COO within the next year.

An Accenture study found that approximately one in nine COOs moved into the CEO&#x27;s shoes within a year of their departure and that half of COOs see themselves as the &quot;heir apparent.&quot; COOs transitioning into the CEO role often face similar challenges including:
* &quot;Not being automatically granted the luxury of a diagnostic period&quot;. Given that they know the company, COOs turned CEOs are often expected to hit the ground running when in actuality they too need to enter diagnostic mode to fully understand their new role and to see the company from a new perspective.
* &quot;Finding time to manage a new key stakeholder: The board&quot;. Many COOs turned CEOs are often surprised how time-intensive managing the board of directors can be and must learn to incorporate this important responsibility into an already packed schedule.
* &quot;Being in the spotlight&quot;. COOs are used to having the luxury of working &quot;behind the scenes.&quot; As CEO, many are surprised to find they have become a &quot;public&quot; figure both inside and outside the organization and must learn how to manage this additional obligation.
* &quot;Recalibrating their image&quot;. Often COOs struggle not with the strategy portion of the job itself, but overcoming the perception of other stakeholders that they are an &quot;execution&quot; executive versus a &quot;strategy&quot; executive. As a result, nearly 50% of the S&amp;P 500 companies have opted to appoint a Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) to be a &quot;mini CEO&quot; and as peer to the COO.

According to researchers Miles and Bennett, just knowing these common pitfalls can help a COO &quot;heir&quot; better prepare for the transition, thereby avoiding them in totality or ensuring that at least they do not evolve into full derailers once they are in the CEO seat.

==Relationship with a CEO==

Because the COO is often responsible for serving as an information conduit to the CEO, it is essential that the relationship between COO and CEO be a positive one. Trust is the most important ingredient necessary for a CEO-COO relationship to thrive. The CEO must have full confidence that the COO is not making direct passes for their job, can get the work done, and shares their vision (rather than using their trusted spot and access to information to undermine the CEO&#x27;s strategy or implement his/her own vision). When a relationship built upon trust is created between the CEO and COO, firm performance is improved and shareholder results are strengthened. Some strategies that are key to building trust in the CEO-COO relationship include:

* Communication—The CEO has to be comfortable sharing information with the COO and regularly communicating the strategy and any changes to it. Similarly, the COO has to be comfortable regularly providing status updates to the CEO. When communication breaks down, mistrust or misunderstanding is likely to mess up.
* Clear decision rights—The COO role appears to work the best when the roles and responsibilities of the COO have been clearly delineated ahead of time and the COO is allowed to make the final decision within pre-agreed upon scope.
* Lock on the backdoor—The CEO must not undermine the COO&#x27;s credibility by continually reversing decisions. When employees learn that they can get a different answer by going directly to the CEO as opposed to the COO, the COO role quickly becomes impotent.
* Sharing the spotlight—In effective CEO-COO relationships, both parties are comfortable with how much &quot;credit&quot; they receive for their work internally, externally, from the board of directors, and from each other.
* Fit between CEO and COO—The two individuals must respect each other and effectively partner together. This is not a partnership that can be forced.
* Fit Between the COO and the position—The selected COO must have the right credentials to carry out the purpose for which the COO role was created (which can include everything from operations expertise to change expertise to having a complementary skill set to the CEO).
* Transparency of succession expectations and timeline—Both parties must understand whether the COO desires the CEO job, whether the COO is in consideration for the top job, and what the timing might be for such a transition.

==Relationship with board of directors==
In addition to having a strong and trusting relationship with the CEO, the COO should also have an effective relationship with the board. A good relationship between COO and the board allows the board to better understand and independently judge a potential successor. A strong relationship between the board and the COO also offers the board an additional expert opinion on the health of the company, and status of key initiatives. It benefits the CEO to allow such a relationship to form because it reflects confidence and fosters transparency. It also reinforces that the CEO is capable of developing talent, and helps the CEO to retain the COO by further empowering the individual. A strong relationship benefits the COOs in that they are able to expand their experience as well as their professional network. Additionally, if they are looking to be the next CEO, it allows them to develop credibility with the board. Researchers advise the COO to go beyond simply presenting at board meetings, to ensure they are developing strong one-on-one relationships with each board director. Researchers also urge the COO to develop his or her own voice, independent of the CEO.

==Failure in the COO role==
Any breakdown in trust between the CEO and COO can lead to failure. Additionally, the COO typically has to be a high-level leader who is comfortable being fully in charge. Many executives with the leadership skills necessary to be a top-level COO would prefer to be running their own organization as opposed to taking orders from a CEO. For COOs who are expecting to serve their time and be promoted to the top spot, their timelines for such a move can often be out of sync with the CEO&#x27;s, causing a breakdown in the relationship. COOs can also find themselves trapped into being labeled an &quot;operations&quot; person or a &quot;number two&quot; as opposed to being seen as a strategic and top-level leader by the board of directors, which causes some executives to steer clear of the position. Harry Levinson effectively summarized the challenges of the COO position: &quot;The relationship between the chief executive officer and the chief operating officer in any organization is fraught with many psychological complexities. Perhaps it is the most difficult of all organizational working relationships because more than others, it is a balancing act on the threshold of power.&quot;.

==Experts and research==
Nathan Bennett and Stephen A. Miles have researched the role of COOs. Their published works analyse the role and its effectiveness, classify the different types of COOs, and examine relationships between CEOs and COOs.

<doc id="343045" wikidata="Q543815" url="?curid=343045" title="Hurricane Connie">
<text>Hurricane Connie was a Category 4 hurricane that contributed to significant flooding across the eastern United States in August 1955, just days before Hurricane Diane affected the same general area. Connie formed on August 3 from a tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. It moved quickly west-northwestward, strengthening into a hurricane by August 4. Connie first posed a threat to the Lesser Antilles, ultimately passing about north of the island group. In the United States Virgin Islands, three people died due to the hurricane, and a few homes were destroyed. The outer rainbands produced hurricane-force wind gusts and intense precipitation, reaching in Puerto Rico. On the island, Connie destroyed 60 homes and caused crop damage. After affecting Puerto Rico, Connie reached maximum sustained winds of , and a barometric pressure of , as observed by the Hurricane Hunters on August 7. The hurricane later weakened, slowed its forward motion, and turned to the north, striking North Carolina on August 12 as a Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Connie was the first of three damaging tropical cyclones in the 1955 hurricane season to hit the state, along with Diane and Ione. The storm progressed inland after moving through the Chesapeake Bay region, and was later absorbed by a cold front over Lake Huron on August 15.

Ahead of the storm, the United States Weather Bureau issued widespread hurricane warnings, spurring evacuations, flight cancelations, and beach closures. Connie produced strong winds, high tides, and heavy rainfall as it moved ashore, causing heavy crop damage and 27 deaths in North Carolina. Four people were killed in Washington, D.C. due to a traffic accident caused by slick roads. In Chesapeake Bay, Connie capsized a boat, killing 14 people and prompting a change in Coast Guard regulations. There were six deaths each in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and 14 deaths in New York, where record rainfall flooded houses and subways. At least 295,000 people nationwide lost electric power during the storm. Damage in the United States totaled around $86 million (1955 USD). The rains from Connie contributed to flooding from Hurricane Diane that caused $700 million in damage. The remnants of Connie killed three people in Ontario, and also destroyed a few houses and boats in the province. As a result of its impacts, including a death toll of 77, the name &quot;Connie&quot; was retired from the Atlantic hurricane naming list.

==Meteorological history==

A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression to the west of the Cape Verde islands on August 3, 1955, based on reports from two nearby ships. The depression moved quickly west-northwestward and intensified into Tropical Storm Connie. A Hurricane Hunters flight on August 4 reported a developing eye feature. Observations from the flight, as well as a nearby ship, suggested that Connie attained hurricane status on August 4. The hurricane continued to intensify as it approached the northern Lesser Antilles, passing about north of the island group on August 6. Later that day, the storm strengthened to major hurricane status, or a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale.

After passing the Lesser Antilles, Connie turned more to the northwest as it rounded a large ridge. A Hurricane Hunters flight on August 7 observed an eye shaped like an inverted cone – larger at flight-level, and a diameter of at the surface. The plane also observed a minimum barometric pressure of 944 mbar (27.88 inHg), the lowest in association with the hurricane. Based on the observations, the Hurricane Research Division estimated maximum sustained winds of , making Connie a Category 4 hurricane. The hurricane progressed northwestward, passing northeast of The Bahamas. The eye grew in size, and the combination of upwelling and cooler air resulted in weakening. Connie fell below major hurricane status on August 9. A building ridge to its northeast, as well as some interaction with developing Hurricane Diane to its southeast, caused Connie to move slower toward the west-northwest. On August 10, the hurricane turned to the north as it moved toward the southeast United States coast. On August 12, Connie restrengthened slightly, reaching a secondary peak intensity of . The hurricane made landfall near Fort Macon State Park in North Carolina at that intensity around 15:00 UTC.

Hurricane Connie weakened as it moved through eastern North Carolina. The storm approached the Atlantic coast near the North Carolina/Virginia border. After passing through the Hampton Roads area, Connie turned back to the north-northwest, steered by a strengthening upper-level trough and low, located over Illinois. On August 13, Connie fell below hurricane intensity as it moved through the Chesapeake Bay region. The track shifted to the northwest, and Connie moved across western Pennsylvania, into Lake Erie. While still a tropical storm, Connie moved across portions of Southwestern Ontario, Lake Huron, and Michigan. On August 15, an approaching cold front absorbed the dissipating storm.

==Preparations==

On August 5, Hurricane Connie began to become an apparent threat to the northeastern Caribbean Islands, with maximum winds in the storm reaching . The National Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings for Barbuda, Saba and Antigua. The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were placed on hurricane alert as warnings were possible later that day. Along the northern coast of Puerto Rico, the threat of Connie forced 40,000 people to evacuate their homes. After Connie affected Puerto Rico, a storm warning was issued for the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, and a hurricane warning was issued for the eastern Bahamas.

While Connie was meandering in the western Atlantic Ocean, its potential track posed problems for forecasters, due to its slow movement near the southeast United States coastline. On August 7, a hurricane warning was issued from North Carolina to Norfolk, Virginia, with a hurricane alert issued farther north to New York City. The Weather Bureau later extended the hurricane warnings to Delaware Breakwater, with storm warnings farther northeast to Provincetown, Massachusetts. The alert for North Carolina was up for about three days until Connie moved inland.

Ahead of the storm, the United States military flew its planes away from the coast to safer shelters further inland. Two people were killed when they crashed the Navy plane they were evacuating. Large Naval ships rode out the storm at sea, while smaller vessels anchored in Tangier. More than 100 merchant vessels from a dozen counties anchored in the waters of Hampton Roads, or while small boats were secured at port. The American Red Cross opened at least 79 shelters, and mobilized 41 officials with hurricane experience. The Coast Guard ordered four towns along beaches to evacuate, and overall about 14,000 people evacuated the coastline. About 2,000 people evacuated from flood-prone areas in New Bern, North Carolina. In Philadelphia, the Boy Scouts evacuated 800 scouts from Camp Delmont due to the threat of the hurricane. The threat of Connie also canceled a flight by President Dwight Eisenhower from Gettysburg to Washington, D.C., prompting him to travel instead by car. More than 300 residents evacuated in North Jersey. Beaches were closed in New Jersey and New York. An annual parade in Ocean City, New Jersey, was postponed due to the storm. Dozens of flights in and out of the New York area were canceled due to weather conditions. The storm also prompted the Canadian Army to halt military exercises.

==Impact==
===Caribbean===
As the hurricane passed north of the Lesser Antilles, the outer rainbands of Connie produced wind gusts as high as on Tortola in the British Virgin Islands. On Anguilla, sustained winds reached . Wind gusts reached in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, although there were estimates of wind gusts on Saint Thomas. The outer rainbands of Connie also produced heavy rainfall in the northeastern Caribbean. The highest precipitation total in Puerto Rico was along the lower Río Blanco, of which fell in one day. Rainfall reached in Charlotte Amalie on Saint Thomas. Two people drowned on the island, and one person was electrocuted due to Connie&#x27;s passage. The hurricane also destroyed a few shacks and boats on Saint Thomas. In Puerto Rico, high winds and waves destroyed 60 poorly built houses. Connie also damaged crops and utilities in Puerto Rico. Later, San Salvador Island in the Bahamas reported winds of .

===United States and Canada===

Hurricane Connie produced hurricane-force winds in North Carolina and Virginia. Across the Northeastern United States, many areas were in drought conditions before the storm struck. Unusually moist air caused above normal air and water temperatures, resulting in heavy rainfall across the eastern United States. Storm-related rainfall spread from the South Carolina, northeast to Maine, and as far west as Michigan. Record rainfall occurred in Philadelphia and New York City, and the highest precipitation related to Connie was at Fort Schuyler in New York.Connie&#x27;s rains preceded additional rainfall from Hurricane Diane just four days later, which together caused widespread flooding. Along Connie&#x27;s western periphery, the rainbands spawned at least six tornadoes, of which five in South Carolina and one in North Carolina. Damage from Connie in the United States was estimated at $86,065,000, mostly in North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland.

When Connie struck North Carolina, it produced sustained winds of in Morehead City, with gusts to . Wind gusts near where the hurricane moved ashore reached , although it was uncertain whether the gust was estimated or measured. Frying Pan Shoals, located offshore, reported a gust of . The hurricane produced tides up to above normal while moving slowly ashore, which resulted in significant beach erosion. Tides were higher at Swansboro, North Carolina than during Hurricane Hazel the previous October, and many piers that were rebuilt after Hazel were damaged or again destroyed by Connie. The storm surge flooded low-lying portions of Wilmington. High waves in advance of the storm flooded coastal roads along the Outer Banks. Rainfall amounts of over in the area west of where Connie made landfall. Stream flooding occurred as far inland as Raleigh, but was most significant near the coast. Along the Pamlico River in Washington, National Guardsmen were ordered to help about 1,000 people evacuate during the storm. Outer rainbands knocked out power lines in coastal North Carolina. Flooding-induced rainfall closed U.S. Route 17 near New Bern. Throughout North Carolina, the hurricane caused about $40 million in damage, of which about 75% was from crop damage. There were 27 deaths in the state related to Connie, including traffic deaths, drownings, people in damaged buildings, and electrocutions.

In South Carolina to the south of the center, the hurricane destroyed 40 buildings in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Connie also damaged fishing piers, breakwaters, and housing shingles. Newspapers considered the damage &quot;mild&quot; compared to that from Hazel the previous year. As Connie progressed northward, it continued to drop significant amounts of precipitation. Totals of over were reported on both sides of Chesapeake Bay, in Pennsylvania, and in southeastern New York. Rainfall in Richmond, Virginia, totaled on August 12, breaking the day&#x27;s precipitation record. Severe river flooding occurred in Virginia, from the coast inland to Richmond. Floods washed out a portion of the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad near Lankford, and covered portions of five area highways, including U.S. 1 and U.S. 301. The storm downed trees and caused scattered power outages for at least 5,000 people in the state. Ten river gauges in Virginia, as well as sixteen in neighboring Maryland, reached the highest stage on record. More than 100 traffic accidents occurred in Washington D.C. due to slick roads; one accident killed four people, after a car was sideswiped and knocked into a swollen creek where the occupants drowned.

The combination of strong winds and high waves wrecked a schooner in the Chesapeake Bay named the &quot;Levin J. Marvel&quot;. The 64-year old boat was described as &quot;unseaworthy&quot; when it left from Annapolis, Maryland, and capsized near Fairhaven. Of the 23 passengers and four crew members, 14 people drowned, making it &quot;one of the worst maritime calamities in the history of Tidewater Maryland&quot;, as described by &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;. The other passengers were later rescued after holding onto wreckage.

Farther from the storm&#x27;s immediate landfall, Connie&#x27;s precipitation was beneficial Delaware due to prior drought conditions. Wind gusts in the state reached on a control tower at the New Castle County Airport. The storm spawned a waterspout in Bethany Beach, which knocked off the roofs of a dozen homes, caused a six-hour power outage, and caused a minor injury when a teenager was flown . The rains caused flooding that was described as &quot;inconsequential&quot; by the United States Geological Survey, due to preceding drought conditions. There were six storm deaths in New Jersey – one by drowning, one by electrocution, and four in traffic accidents. The winds and rains knocked down trees and power lines, leaving about 180,000 people without power, and about 20,000 people without phone service. Nearly every police and fire department in Bergen County, along with over 500 electricians, responded to the outages. Manville declared a state of emergency that lasted for 19.5 hours, after three nearby rivers exceeded their banks. A nun in Tenafly required rescue from a trapped elevator during a power outage. Flooding closed portions of the White Horse Pike and other roads near Camden, causing traffic jams. There were also six deaths in neighboring Pennsylvania – four due to traffic accidents, and two people in their cars swept away by floods. Rainfall reached in southeastern Pennsylvania, with recorded in Philadelphia over a 24-hour period; it was the city&#x27;s highest daily rainfall in 57 years. The deluge exceeded the capacity of sewers and creeks, closed roads, and entered the basements of homes, forcing hundreds of residents to evacuate. Three days&#x27; of rainfall caused creeks to rise in the Lehigh Valley. About 10,000 people lost power in Pennsylvania, but service was quickly restored. U.S. Marines evacuated a group of 63 Girl Scouts from Camp Helena near Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, after floods from a nearby creek threatened the group. A boy required rescue from the flooded Darby Creek.

Heavy rainfall, totaling over affected southeastern New York, causing heavy damage, and killing 11 people in the New York metropolitan area, and three people upstate. Hurricane Connie brought the heaviest rain seen in New York City in over 50 years, totaling within a 20-hour span. Large areas of the city were flooded, inundating subways and thousands of houses. About 100,000 people lost power in the city. High winds and tides from the storm cancelled ferry service, and forced LaGuardia Airport to temporarily shut down after flooding reached deep. Flooding washed out a portion of the Delaware and Hudson Railway in the Helderberg Mountains, causing two trains to derail; there were no injuries. In Monroe and Wayne counties, the storm damaged the peach and apple crops. The Chenango County Fair closed early due to the storms&#x27; rains. In coastal Connecticut, the rainfall from Connie increased levels along streams, but there was little damage.

When the remnants of Connie entered Ontario on August 14, it continued to produce winds of up to , and the storm dropped of rainfall near the Great Lakes. In Burlington, 27 boats were destroyed, and one fisherman drowned in Lake Erie after his boat sank during the storm. Two other people drowned in the province. Connie destroyed six houses and damaged several others due to high waves. The storm also caused power outages and damage to the tobacco crop. Late in the storm&#x27;s path through the United States, Connie produced wind gusts of along Lake Huron in Michigan, causing high waves that damaged or sank many small boats. Damage in Michigan was estimated at $150,000.

==Aftermath==
Flooding caused by Connie generally did not attract much media attention; however, the floods were important in setting the conditions for later significant flooding across the Northeastern United States. Just five days after Connie struck North Carolina, Hurricane Diane affected the same area, but instead of continuing to the northwest it turned to the northeast. Diane produced further rainfall in already wet areas from Connie. Damage from Diane totaled at least $700 million, and six states were declared federal disaster areas from the combined hurricanes&#x27; impact; this allowed federal assistance for the affected areas. Immediately after the storm, the U.S. Small Business Administration authorized low-interest loans for homes and businesses affected by Connie.

The loss of the &quot;Levin J. Marvel&quot; during the hurricane prompted the United States Congress to pass a law in 1956, which allowed the Coast Guard to inspect all vessels with more than six passengers; the previous law only allowed inspections for boats of more than 700 tons, much higher than the 183 tons that the &quot;Marvel&quot; displaced. The inexperienced captain was charged with negligence and manslaughter and stood trial before the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in Baltimore. Those charges carried a prison term of 11 years. Judge Robert Dorsey Watkins, however, acquitted him of the manslaughter charge, instead sentencing him to one-year probation for negligence.

Due to its destructive impact and high death toll, the name &quot;Connie&quot; was retired from the Atlantic hurricane naming list by the U.S. Weather Bureau after the 1955 season. It was one of four names retired from that year.

<text>Smethwick () is an industrial town in the Sandwell district, in the county of the West Midlands, England. It lies west of Birmingham city centre. Historically it was in Staffordshire and then Worcestershire before being placed into West Midlands county.

In 2019, the ward of Smethwick had an estimated population of 15,246, while the wider built-up area subdivision has a population of 53,653.


==History==

It was suggested that the name Smethwick meant &quot;smiths&#x27; place of work&quot;, but a more recent interpretation has suggested the name means &quot;the settlement on the smooth land&quot;. Smethwick was recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Smedeuuich&quot;, the &quot;d&quot; in this spelling being the Anglo-Saxon letter eth. Until the end of the 18th century it was an outlying hamlet of the south Staffordshire village of Harborne. Harborne became part of the county borough of Birmingham and thus transferred from Staffordshire to Warwickshire in 1891, leaving Smethwick in the County of Staffordshire.

The world&#x27;s oldest working engine, the Smethwick Engine, made by Boulton &amp; Watt, originally stood near Bridge Street, Smethwick. It is now at Thinktank, the new science museum in Birmingham.

One notable company was The London Works, manufacturing base of the Fox Henderson Company which made the cast-iron framework for the Crystal Palace. This was founded by Charles Fox, whose inventions included the first patented railway points. His notable employees included William Siemens, the notable mechanical and electrical engineer. The company was bankrupted in 1855 by the failure of an overseas railway to pay for work done. The site was later used by the GKN company. In 2015 the site was being cleared to build the new Midland Metropolitan University Hospital which aims to combine the Sandwell General Hospital at West Bromwich and City Hospital, Dudley Road. Work at the site later came to a standstill because of a crisis in the construction industry.

Other former industry included railway rolling stock manufacture, at the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company factory; screws and other fastenings from Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds (GKN); engines from Tangye; tubing from Evered&#x27;s; steel pen nibs from British Pens; and various products from Chance Brothers&#x27; glassworks, including lighthouse lenses and the glazing for the Crystal Palace (the London works, in North Smethwick, manufactured its metalwork). Phillips Cycles, once one of the largest bicycle manufacturers in the world, was based in Bridge Street, Smethwick. Nearby, in Downing Street, is the famous bicycle saddle maker, Brooks Saddles. The important metalworking factory of Henry Hope &amp; Sons Ltd was based at Halford&#x27;s Lane where the company manufactured steel window systems, roof glazing, gearings and metalwork.

Council housing began in Smethwick after 1920 on land previously belonging to the Downing family, whose family home became Holly Lodge High School for Girls in 1922. The mass council house building of the 1920s and 1930s also involved Smethwick&#x27;s boundaries being extended into part of neighbouring Oldbury in 1928.

The Ruskin Pottery Studio, named in honour of the artist John Ruskin, was in Oldbury Road. Many English churches have stained glass windows made by Hardman Studios in Lightwoods House, or, before that, by the Camm family.

During the Second World War, Smethwick was bombed on a number of occasions by the German Luftwaffe. A total of 80 people died as a result of these air raids.

After the First World War about 50+ Sikh families settled in Smethwick beginning in 1917, with a majority of the men being veterans of the war. After the Second World War, Smethwick attracted a large number of immigrants from Commonwealth countries beginning in 1945, the largest ethnic group being Sikhs from the Punjab in India, the majority of whom had served in that War. The ethnic minority communities were initially unpopular with the white population of Smethwick, leading to the election of Conservative Party Member of Parliament (MP) Peter Griffiths at the 1964 general election, who campaigned by appealing to the racist element and whose supporters had used the slogan, &quot;If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Labour&quot;. This came two years after race riots had hit the town in 1962; it was also set against a background of local factory closures.

In 1961, the Sikh community purchased the unused Congregational Church on the High Street in Smethwick. Soon after, this was converted into a gurdwara, today known as the [Guru Nanak Gurdwara Smethwick].

Bearwood Primary School appointed Tony O&#x27;Connor as head teacher in 1967. He was the first black head teacher in the UK, having been born in Jamaica and moved to Britain with the RAF in 1943. Smethwick received bad publicity when, the day after the announcement of his appointment, racist slogans and swastikas were daubed around the school. However, O&#x27;Connor was well liked by both parents and children; he eventually retired in 1983.

In the mid- to late 1960s, a large council estate in the west of Smethwick was built. It was officially known as the West Smethwick Estate, but as all of the homes were constructed from concrete the estate was known locally as the &quot;concrete jungle&quot;. The homes, mostly three or four storey townhouses, were prone to damp and other construction faults. By the 1980s, levels of crime and unemployment on the estate were high, and by the early 1990s, Sandwell Council had decided to demolish it. Between 1993 and 1997, the estate was entirely redeveloped with modern low-rise housing, and was renamed Galton Village. Another local housing estate called the Windmill Lane Estate, located near Cape Hill, was also redeveloped.

There is a collection of red brick turn-of-20th century terrace, 1930s semi-detached, newly built modern housing and a number of high rise blocks of flats. Other estates and areas include Black Patch, Cape Hill, Uplands, Albion Estate, Bearwood, Londonderry and Rood End.

In July 2013, a major fire occurred at the Jayplas plastics and paper recycling plant on Dartmouth Road.

===Architecture===

The oldest surviving building in Smethwick is the Old Church which stands on the corner of Church Road and the Uplands. This was consecrated in 1732 as a Chapel of Ease in the parish of St Peter, Harborne. The building was originally known as &quot;Parkes&#x27; Chapel&quot; in honour of Mistress Dorothy Parkes who bequeathed the money for the church and also for a local school. The chapel was later known as the &quot;Old Chapel&quot;, and the public house next to it is still called this. In the church there are several fine memorials, including one to Dorothy Parkes.

The Grade I listed Galton Bridge spans the New Line canal and railway. When built in 1829 by Thomas Telford, it was the highest single-span bridge in the world. Its name commemorates Samuel Galton, a local landowner and industrialist. It is identical to Telford&#x27;s bridge at Holt Fleet over the River Severn built in 1828 and opened in 1830.
The public library in the High Street was originally built as the Public Hall in 1866–67 and is designed by Yeoville Thomason.

Matthew Boulton and James Watt opened their Soho Foundry in the north of Smethwick (not to be confused with the Soho Manufactory in nearby Soho) in the late 18th century. In 1802, William Murdoch illuminated the foundry with gas lighting of his own invention. The foundry was later home to weighing scale makers W &amp; T Avery Ltd.

Rolfe Street public baths were among the first public swimming baths in the country when opened north of the town centre in 1888. The baths remained open for nearly a century before closing. In the late 1980s, the Black Country Museum expressed interest in transferring the building to its site in Dudley and so the transfer of the building began in 1989. It was finally opened to visitors at the museum in 1999, housing the museum&#x27;s exhibition gallery and archive resource centre.

Thimblemill Library is a Grade II listed building built in brick in the Moderne style.

===Political history===

The town is notable for a somewhat turbulent political history. 

It was first created as a separate parliamentary constituency in 1918, having previously been part of the Handsworth constituency. At that year&#x27;s general election, Christabel Pankhurst, standing as a Women&#x27;s Party candidate, narrowly failed to become one of Britain&#x27;s first woman Members of Parliament. She lost to the Labour candidate by 775 votes in a straight fight.

Labour held the seat until 1931; from 1926, the MP was Sir Oswald Mosley, future founder of the British Union of Fascists. Mosley resigned the Labour whip in March 1931, but continued to represent the constituency until it was taken by the Conservatives at that year&#x27;s general election. Labour won it back at the UK general election of 1945, held on 26 July that year. However, the victorious MP, Alfred Dobbs, was killed in a car crash the very next day. He is thus the shortest-serving Member of Parliament (MP) in British history, if one discounts a few cases of people being elected posthumously. In the resulting by-election, Patrick Gordon Walker won again for Labour. The seat remained held by Labour until 1964.

At the 1964 general election, sitting MP Gordon Walker, who was Shadow Foreign Secretary, was defeated in highly controversial circumstances in the constituency by the virulently anti-immigration Conservative Party candidate Peter Griffiths. Smethwick had attracted immigration from the Commonwealth in the economic and industrial growth of the years following the Second World War and Griffiths ran a campaign critical of the government&#x27;s policy. His supporters had circulated the slogan &quot;If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Liberal or Labour.&quot; Griffiths refused to condemn the slogan. Colin Jordan, a British Neo-Nazi and later leader of the British Movement, claimed that members of his group had produced the initial slogan as well as spread the publicised poster and sticker campaign which contained it; Jordan&#x27;s group in the past had also campaigned on other slogans, such as: &quot;Don&#x27;t vote - a vote for Tory, Labour or Liberal is a vote for more Blacks!&quot;. Jordan would also use similar campaign tactics against Gordon Walker in the 1965 Leyton by-election. The election of Griffiths led to Smethwick becoming notorious as &#x27;Britain&#x27;s most racist town&#x27;. 

Historian Rachel Yemm argues that the anti-immigration sentiment in the town was the result of a housing shortage, which local newspapers, such as &quot;The Smethwick Telephone&quot;, blamed on the migrants. Griffiths not only drew on these fears, but also raised racist concerns about &#x27;miscegenation&#x27; and argued for the repatriation of migrants. 
At the beginning of 1965 Smethwick Council was planning &quot;to purchase all available houses on Marshall Street to prevent their sale to immigrants&quot;. This made national headlines, and the plan was later stopped by the government.
In February 1965, American black activist Malcolm X visited Marshall Street just days before his assassination. Earlier in his career he had advocated the complete separation of African Americans from whites, but he now showed his opposition to racial segregation, telling the press:
Malcolm X had been invited to Smethwick by Claudia Jones on behalf of Avtar Singh Jouhl of the Indian Workers&#x27; Association. The BBC had been intending to make a feature about a new black-led newspaper, and a BBC News journalist had a view to X having a debate with Griffiths outside a council house in Smethwick. Griffiths declined at late notice, and so an interview with X was conducted on the streets of Smethwick. This was to be one of X&#x27;s last TV interviews before his assassination nine days later. The footage was never screened until Stephen C Page, a community artist, uncovered the footage in 2005.

Labour candidate and actor Andrew Faulds defeated Griffiths in the 1966 general election, remaining as an MP until his retirement at the 1997 general election, 23 years after Smethwick became part of the Warley East constituency. Griffiths subsequently moved away from the area and later served as Conservative MP for Portsmouth North.

===Civic history===


Originally a hamlet within the parish of Harborne, Staffordshire, Smethwick was made into an urban district in 1894, on 31 December Smethwick became a civil parish, in 1899 the district became a municipal corporation, and the district became county borough within Staffordshire in 1907 with its base at Smethwick Council House. On 1 April 1966, Smethwick was merged with the boroughs of Oldbury and Rowley Regis to form the new County Borough of Warley, part also went to the County Borough of West Bromwich and the County Borough of Birmingham, Smethwick was transferred into the county of Worcestershire. The parish was also abolished on 1 April 1966 to form Warley, part also went to West Bromwich and Birmingham. In 1961 the parish had a population of 68,390. Warley county borough in turn was merged with West Bromwich in 1974 to form the Sandwell Metropolitan Borough, which was incorporated into the new West Midlands county.

In 1888, there had been plans for Smethwick to be incorporated into the city of Birmingham, but the urban district council voted against these plans by a single vote.

The archives for the Borough of Smethwick are held at Sandwell Community History and Archives Service.

===Transport history===
====Canals====
Smethwick has a long association with canals, which were the town&#x27;s first major transport links from a time before decent roads and of course railways. The Birmingham Canal Navigation Old and New Main Line Canals run through the industrial areas and right past the High Street, running parallel to the Stour Valley Line: all three end up in Wolverhampton. James Brindley was the engineer charged with building the canal, a man who gives his name to the busy district in the centre of Birmingham near the International Convention Centre, National Indoor Arena and Broad Street.
The old main line was completed through Smethwick by 1769. It required 12 locks to climb over the hill through the town; Brindley had found the earth too soft to dig a cutting through at the time. Water was supplied by two steam engines. One of them was located on the Engine Arm which led to the Smethwick Engine on Rabone Lane and the other was near Spon Lane. New Smethwick Pumping Station next to Brasshouse Lane was added later in 1892. Because of the locks, the canal through Smethwick became a bottleneck and Thomas Telford was commissioned in 1824 to look at alternatives.

The new main line through Smethwick was completed by 1829 and completely bypassed all six remaining locks of the summit with a deep cutting. The Engine Arm and Stewarts aqueducts were built to carry their respective canals over the new mainline. The cutting was built through the land of the local businessman Samuel Galton and thus this cutting created the Galton Valley and Galton Bridge was named in his honour. The bridge was the longest single-span iron bridge in the world at the time. The canals of the new and old main line diverged at one end at Smethwick Junction near Bridge Street and rejoined at Bromford Junction near Bromford Road in Oldbury.

Today Galton Valley is a nature area and of more historical interest than commercial, and used mainly for leisure rather than transporting commercial goods.

====Railways====
The LNWR was the first to construct a railway through Smethwick in 1852 from New Street towards Wolverhampton and the North West, Rolfe Street and Spon Lane opened that year followed by Soho in 1853. In 1867 the Stourbridge Railway opened a link between the Great Western Birmingham, Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Railway (of 1852) near the current Hawthorns and Stourbridge with a station at Smethwick West and a link to the Stour Valley line towards New Street called Smethwick Junction, the Stourbridge Railway was merged into the Great Western in 1870. Not until 1931 was a railway station constructed at the Hawthorns, although it was a &#x27;halt&#x27; primarily for the football ground; this station closed in 1967.
From 1854 the Birmingham Railway Carriage &amp; Wagon Company was based in Smethwick until its closure in 1963. The company not only built trains, but also London Underground stock, buses and a military equipment.

Soho railway station closed in 1949, followed by Spon Lane station in 1968. In 1972 the section of line between Smethwick West and Birmingham Moor Street, as well as the Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Dudley railway, was closed, with the exception of a single line between Smethwick West and Coopers Scrap Metal in Handsworth; and all Stourbridge services were diverted into Birmingham New Street. In 1995 the line between Birmingham Snow Hill and Smethwick West was restored and a new station called Smethwick Galton Bridge was constructed over both the Snow Hill and Stour Valley lines to provide an interchange. Smethwick West was due to close when Galton Bridge opened, but due to a legal error British Railways had to maintain a parliamentary train service to the station. Most local trains from Stourbridge to Birmingham were diverted into Snow Hill although it was not until 2004 that the last regular service used the route into Birmingham New Street via Smethwick Junction.

Soho TMD is located next to Soho rail junction; road access is just off Wellington Street. It is the principal train depot for West Midlands Trains&#x27; Class 323 train fleet, which are often seen providing local train services in the area.

====Buses and trams====

The town of Smethwick has a long association with buses. From 1914 the famous Birmingham &amp; Midland Motor Omnibus Company (BMMO or Midland Red) was based on Bearwood Road on the site of the current Bearwood Shopping Centre until 1974. The garage later saw use as an indoor market until it was demolished in 1979. Smethwick never had its own Corporation Transport Department, like West Bromwich or Birmingham. Most bus services until the earlier 1970s were provided by the Midland Red, West Bromwich and Birmingham. In the early 1970s, all local bus transport was taken over by the WMPTE until deregulation in the 1980s. Since then, National Express West Midlands has been the primary operator in the West Midlands.

Steam trams started through Smethwick in 1885 operated by Birmingham and Midland Tramways. These were replaced by electric trams in 1904 and then merged into the Birmingham Corporation Tramways in 1906 and trams eventually ran from both the Dudley Road and Hagley Road direction. Dudley Road trams operated to Cape Hill and then diverged to either take the route towards Dudley (Route 87) via the High Street or towards Bearwood (Route 29) via Waterloo Road, terminating near the site of current Bearwood Bus Station and Kings Head public house. Route 34 from Birmingham to Bearwood along the Hagley Road and terminated at the top of Bearwood Road next to the route from Cape Hill, despite terminating so close to each other there was no physical link between route 29 and 34 in Bearwood. Route 34 was the first route in Smethwick to disappear, in 1930; the last tram route was closed in 1939 and replaced by motor buses. Both the current National Express West Midlands routes 82 and 87 are former tram routes and the 87 in fact uses the same number.
The West Midlands Metro, opened in 1999, is more of a light railway than a tramway. It follows the former Great Western Railway track bed from Birmingham Snow Hill station to the former Wolverhampton Low Level via West Bromwich until Priestfield in Wolverhampton. After that, it becomes a tramway proper and runs along the Bilston Road into Wolverhampton city centre. From late 2015 the service was extended from its former terminus at Snow Hill through the city centre to Grand Central. The metro can be caught at the Hawthorns railway station.

==Geography==
Smethwick borders West Bromwich and Oldbury to the north and west, and the Birmingham districts of Handsworth, Winson Green, Harborne, Edgbaston and Quinton to the south and east.

==Demographics==
In 1964, around 6% of Smethwick was estimated to be non-White. At the 2011 census, there were 48,765 residents in Smethwick in 18,381 households, and the median age of Smethwick residents was 32.

In terms of ethnicity:

*43.3% of Smethwick residents were White (Comprising 37.6% White British, 4.6% Other White, 1.1% Irish and 0.1% Gypsy/Irish Traveller). 
*37.5% were Asian (Comprising 15.7% Indian, 12.4% Pakistani, 4.4% Bangladeshi 0.4% Chinese and 4.6% from another Asian background)
*11.3% were Black (Comprising 6.1% Caribbean, 3.3% African and 1.9% other Black)
*4.7% were Mixed. 
*0.5% were Arab and 2.8% were from another ethnic group.

In terms of religion, 39.5% of Smethwick residents identified as Christian, 21.8% were Muslim, 15.7% were Sikh, 14.0% said they had no religion, 5.8% did not state any religion, 2.3% were Hindu, 0.3% were Buddhists, and 0.6% were from another religion.

==Industry and commerce==
Until the end of the 18th century, Smethwick was largely rural, with farming as the main industry. A water mill named &quot;Briddismylne&quot; is recorded in 1499 as belonging to Halesowen Abbey, thought to be on the more recent Thimblemill site. In 1659, a mill in the Hockley Brook is recorded as belonging to a Mr. Lane. The mill which led to the street name &quot;Windmill Lane&quot; was built on land bought in 1803 by William Croxall, a miller. The last part of the windmill building was demolished in 1949.
The Soho Foundry, opened in 1796 by James Watt and Matthew Boulton, trading as Boulton, Watt &amp; Sons, was built to produce complete steam engines to Watt&#x27;s designs. Waste dumped from the foundry gave rise to the name Black Patch to the field to the east. The Soho Foundry is now the headquarters of the Avery Company.

The route of the canal, passing through the valley of the Hockley Brook, the boundary with Handsworth on the north side of Smethwick, resulted in most of the heavy industry being located there. The railway was opened in 1852.

One of Smethwick&#x27;s significant industrial enterprises of the 19th century was the Fox, Henderson Company, formerly Brannah, Fox and Co., which built the steel structure for the Crystal Palace in 1851. At its peak this employed about 2,000 people at the London Works. The bankruptcy and closure of the firm in 1856 had a devastating effect on the local economy. The site of the London Works was later acquired by Chamberlain and Nettlefold, and in 2014 was cleared to build the new Midland Metropolitan University Hospital, amalgamating the Sandwell General Hospital at West Bromwich with the City Hospital, Dudley Road.

Richard Tangye was a notable builder of steam engines in the late 19th century. His designs, in a characteristic green colour, have a distinctive elegance of form. He demolished Smethwick Hall, on the border with Handsworth, and built his factory, the Cornwall Works, on the site.

Mitchells &amp; Butlers opened a brewery on Cape Hill in 1879. It was a local landmark in Smethwick and provided employment in the town for 123 years. However, following a decline in sales and revenue, American owners Coors closed the brewery on 6 December 2002. It was demolished two years later and a 650-home private housing estate was developed on its site.

<text>Sir Hugh Clopton (c. 1440 – 15 September 1496) was a Lord Mayor of London, a member of the Worshipful Company of Mercers and a benefactor of his home town of Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire.

==Origins==
Hugh Clopton was born in about 1440 at Clopton House near Stratford-upon-Avon, where the Clopton family had lived since the reign of King Henry III (1216–1272). He was a younger son of John Clopton by his wife, a certain Agnes whose surname is unknown. In 1450 his father received license to erect an oratory at the manor house. In 1474 Thomas Clopton, Hugh&#x27;s elder brother, obtained permission from Pope Sixtus IV to add a chapel to the house for the celebration of divine service.

==Career==
As a younger son excluded from his patrimony by primogeniture, he was expected to make his own fortune and left Clopton for the City of London at an early age, where he was apprenticed in 1457 to the mercer John Roo, and was admitted to the Worshipful Company of Mercers in 1464. He served as Warden of the Company three times, in 1479, 1484 and 1488. On 15 October 1485 he was chosen as Alderman for Dowgate ward. In 1486 he was elected Sheriff of London during Sir Henry Colet&#x27;s term as mayor, and was himself chosen Lord Mayor of London in 1491. By 1495 he was living in Bread Street. Although some biographers have stated that he was knighted, this does not appear to have been the case as he described himself in his will merely as &quot;citizen, mercer and alderman&quot;.

His vast fortune enabled him to become possessed of his ancestral estates at Clopton, the inheritance of his elder brother, and it is certain that the neighbouring town of Stratford-upon-Avon was his favourite place of residence. In about 1483 he erected there (in Chapel Street) &quot;a pretty house of brick and timber&quot;, which was later purchased in 1597 and renovated by the playwright William Shakespeare, and under the name of New Place served as his residence until his death in 1616.

Clopton rebuilt the nave of the Chapel of the Stratford Guild of the Holy Trinity, situated opposite his new house in Chapel Street, and he adorned the building with a tower, steeple, glass windows and paintings for the ceiling. He also built the Clopton Bridge, a remarkably fine stone bridge of fourteen arches over the River Avon, having removed at his own expense an old wooden bridge on the site. He also founded the Clopton chantry chapel in the Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon, still notable features of modern Stratford.

==Death and burial==
He died on 15 September 1497, holding the manor of Clopton as a tenant-in-chief of King Henry VII &quot;as of the manor of the Castle of Beaudesert&quot; by 1/8 of a knight&#x27;s fee, and left as his heir William Clopton (died 1521), the son of his nephew John, then aged 15. In 1504 William had livery of his great-uncle Hugh&#x27;s manors of Clopton and Little Wilmcote, and his lands in Stratford and Bridgetown.

By his will, dated a week before his death, he provided for the completion of the Stratford improvements, and left a hundred marks to twenty-four maidens of the town and £200 for rebuilding the cross aisle of the parish church. He also instituted exhibitions of £4 a year each for five years for three poor scholars at each university of Oxford and Cambridge, and gave £10 to the common box of the Mercers Company, and other sums to the Venturers fellowship resident in Zeland, Brabant, and Flanders, and to &quot;the fellowship of the Staple of Calais&quot;.

Clopton desired to be buried in the parish church of Stratford, if he died in that town, where he spent much time in his later years. Instead, he died in his London house, in the parish of St Margaret Lothbury, and he finally bequeathed his body to the church of that parish.

==Succession==
Clopton never married and left no children. The Clopton estates ultimately passed to Joyce Clopton, of the sixth generation in descent from Thomas Clopton, Sir Hugh&#x27;s elder brother. She married George Carew, 1st Earl of Totnes, who thus inherited from his wife the manor of Clopton, and was buried in Stratford Church, where survives his magnificent monument containing the effigies of himself and his wife.

<doc id="343054" wikidata="Q1103530" url="?curid=343054" title="Tone cluster">
<text>A tone cluster is a musical chord comprising at least three adjacent tones in a scale. Prototypical tone clusters are based on the chromatic scale and are separated by semitones. For instance, three adjacent piano keys (such as C, C, and D) struck simultaneously produce a tone cluster. Variants of the tone cluster include chords comprising adjacent tones separated diatonically, pentatonically, or microtonally. On the piano, such clusters often involve the simultaneous striking of neighboring white or black keys.

The early years of the twentieth century saw tone clusters elevated to central roles in pioneering works by ragtime artists Jelly Roll Morton and Scott Joplin. In the 1910s, two classical avant-gardists, composer-pianists Leo Ornstein and Henry Cowell, were recognized as making the first extensive explorations of the tone cluster. During the same period, Charles Ives employed them in several compositions that were not publicly performed until the late 1920s or 1930s, as did Béla Bartók in the latter decade. Since the mid-20th century, they have prominently featured in the work of composers such as Lou Harrison, Giacinto Scelsi, Alfred Schnittke and Karlheinz Stockhausen, and later Eric Whitacre. Tone clusters also play a significant role in the work of free jazz musicians such as Cecil Taylor, Matthew Shipp, and Kevin Kastning.

In most Western music, tone clusters tend to be heard as dissonant. Clusters may be performed with almost any individual instrument on which three or more notes can be played simultaneously, as well as by most groups of instruments or voices. Keyboard instruments are particularly suited to the performance of tone clusters because it is relatively easy to play multiple notes in unison on them.

==Music theory and classification==
Prototypical tone clusters are chords of three or more adjacent notes on a chromatic scale, that is, three or more adjacent pitches each separated by only a semitone. Three-note stacks based on diatonic and pentatonic scales are also, strictly speaking, tone clusters. However, these stacks involve intervals between notes greater than the half-tone gaps of the chromatic kind. This can readily be seen on a keyboard, where the pitch of each key is separated from the next by one semitone (visualizing the black keys as extending to the edge of the keyboard): Diatonic scales—conventionally played on the white keys—contain only two semitone intervals; the rest are full tones. In Western musical traditions, pentatonic scales—conventionally played on the black keys—are built entirely from intervals larger than a semitone. Commentators thus tend to identify diatonic and pentatonic stacks as &quot;tone clusters&quot; only when they consist of four or more successive notes in the scale. In standard Western classical music practice, all tone clusters are classifiable as secundal chords—that is, they are constructed from minor seconds (intervals of one semitone), major seconds (intervals of two semitones), or, in the case of certain pentatonic clusters, augmented seconds (intervals of three semitones). Stacks of adjacent microtonal pitches also constitute tone clusters.

In tone clusters, the notes are sounded fully and in unison, distinguishing them from ornamented figures involving acciaccaturas and the like. Their effect also tends to be different: where ornamentation is used to draw attention to the harmony or the relationship between harmony and melody, tone clusters are for the most part employed as independent sounds. While, by definition, the notes that form a cluster must sound at the same time, there is no requirement that they must all &quot;begin&quot; sounding at the same moment. For example, in R. Murray Schafer&#x27;s choral &quot;Epitaph for Moonlight&quot; (1968), a tone cluster is constructed by dividing each choir section (soprano/alto/tenor/bass) into four parts. Each of the sixteen parts enters separately, humming a note one semitone lower than the note hummed by the previous part, until all sixteen are contributing to the cluster.

Tone clusters have generally been thought of as dissonant musical textures, and even defined as such. As noted by Alan Belkin, however, instrumental timbre can have a significant impact on their effect: &quot;Clusters are quite aggressive on the organ, but soften enormously when played by strings (possibly because slight, continuous fluctuations of pitch in the latter provide some inner mobility).&quot; In his first published work on the topic, Henry Cowell observed that a tone cluster is &quot;more pleasing&quot; and &quot;acceptable to the ear if its outer limits form a consonant interval.&quot; Cowell explains, &quot;the natural spacing of so-called dissonances is as seconds, as in the overtone series, rather than sevenths and ninths...Groups spaced in seconds may be made to sound euphonious, particularly if played in conjunction with fundamental chord notes taken from lower in the same overtone series. Blends them together and explains them to the ear.&quot; Tone clusters have also been considered noise. As Mauricio Kagel says, &quot;clusters have generally been used as a kind of anti-harmony, as a transition between sound and noise.&quot; Tone clusters thus also lend themselves to use in a percussive manner. Historically, they were sometimes discussed with a hint of disdain. One 1969 textbook defines the tone cluster as &quot;an extra-harmonic clump of notes&quot;.

==Notation and execution==

In his 1917 piece &quot;The Tides of Manaunaun&quot;, Cowell introduced a new notation for tone clusters on the piano and other keyboard instruments. In this notation, only the top and bottom notes of a cluster, connected by a single line or a pair of lines, are represented. This developed into the solid-bar style seen in the image on the right. Here, the first chord—stretching two octaves from D2 to D4—is a diatonic (so-called white-note) cluster, indicated by the natural sign below the staff. The second is a pentatonic (so-called black-note) cluster, indicated by the flat sign; a sharp sign would be required if the notes showing the limit of the cluster were spelled as sharps. A chromatic cluster—black and white keys together—is shown in this method by a solid bar with no sign at all. In scoring the large, dense clusters of the solo organ work &quot;Volumina&quot; in the early 1960s, György Ligeti, using graphical notation, blocked in whole sections of the keyboard.

The performance of keyboard tone clusters is widely considered an &quot;extended technique&quot;—large clusters require unusual playing methods often involving the fist, the flat of the hand, or the forearm. Thelonious Monk and Karlheinz Stockhausen each performed clusters with their elbows; Stockhausen developed a method for playing cluster glissandi with special gloves. Don Pullen would play moving clusters by rolling the backs of his hands over the keyboard. Boards of various dimension are sometimes employed, as in the &quot;Concord&quot; Sonata ( 1904–19) of Charles Ives; they can be weighted down to execute clusters of long duration. Several of Lou Harrison&#x27;s scores call for the use of an &quot;octave bar&quot;, crafted to facilitate high-speed keyboard cluster performance. Designed by Harrison with his partner William Colvig, the octave bar is

a flat wooden device approximately two inches high with a grip on top and sponge rubber on the bottom, with which the player strikes the keys. Its length spans an octave on a grand piano. The sponge rubber bottom is sculpted so that its ends are slightly lower than its center, making the outer tones of the octave sound with greater force than the intermediary pitches. The pianist can thus rush headlong through fearfully rapid passages, precisely spanning an octave at each blow.
==Use in Western music==

===Before the 1900s===
The earliest example of tone clusters in a Western music composition thus far identified is in the Allegro movement of Heinrich Biber&#x27;s &quot;Battalia à 10&quot; (1673) for string ensemble, which calls for several diatonic clusters. An orchestral diatonic cluster, containing all the notes of the harmonic minor scale, occurs also in the representation of chaos in the opening of Jean-Féry Rebel&#x27;s 1737–38 ballet &quot;Les Élémens&quot;.
From the next century-and-a-half, a few more examples have been identified, mostly no more than a fleeting instance of the form, for example in the opening of J.S. Bach&#x27;s Cantata &quot;O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort&quot;, BWV 60 or in the concluding two bars of the &quot;Loure&quot; from the same composer&#x27;s French Suite No. 5, BWV 816:
or the collisions that result from the interaction of multiple lines &quot;locked together in suspensions&quot; in Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Musical Offering&quot;:

In the keyboard sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti (1685–1757), we find a more daring and idiosyncratic use of tone clusters. In the following passage from the late 1740s, Scarlatti builds the dissonances over several bars:

Ralph Kirkpatrick says that these chords &quot;are not clusters in the sense that they are arbitrary blobs of dissonance, nor are they necessarily haphazard fillings up of diatonic intervals or simultaneous soundings of neighboring tones; they are logical expressions of Scarlatti&#x27;s harmonic language and organic manifestations of his tonal structure.&quot; Frederick Neumann describes Sonata K175 (1750s) as &quot;full of Scarlatti&#x27;s famous tone clusters&quot;. During this era, as well, several French programmatic compositions for the harpsichord or piano represent cannon fire with clusters: works by François Dandrieu (&quot;Les Caractères de la guerre&quot;, 1724), Michel Corrette (&quot;La Victoire d&#x27;un combat naval, remportée par une frégate contre plusieurs corsaires réunis&quot;, 1780), Claude-Bénigne Balbastre (&quot;March des Marseillois&quot;, 1793), Pierre Antoine César (&quot;La Battaille de Gemmap, ou la prise de Mons&quot;, 1794), Bernard Viguerie (&quot;La Bataille de Maringo, pièce militaire et hitorique&quot;, for piano trio, 1800), and Jacques-Marie Beauvarlet-Charpentier (&quot;Battaille d&#x27;Austerlitz&quot;, 1805).

A dramatic use of a &quot;virtual&quot; tone cluster can be found in Franz Schubert&#x27;s song &quot;Erlkönig&quot; (1815–21). Here, a terrified child calls out to his father when he sees an apparition of the sinister Erl King. The dissonant voicing of the dominant minor ninth chord used here (C79) is particularly effective in heightening the drama and sense of threat.
Writing about this passage, Richard Taruskin remarked on the &quot;unprecedented ... level of dissonance at the boy&#x27;s outcries. ... The voice has the ninth, pitched above, and the left hand has the seventh, pitched below. The result is a virtual &#x27;tone cluster&#x27; ... the harmonic logic of these progressions, within the rules of composition Schubert was taught, can certainly be demonstrated. That logic, however, is not what appeals so strongly to the listener&#x27;s imagination; rather it is the calculated impression (or illusion) of wild abandon.&quot;

The concluding Arietta from Beethoven’s last Piano Sonata No. 32, Op. 111 features a passage which, according to Martin Cooper “gives a momentary touch of blurredness by the repeated cluster of fourths.” 

The next known compositions after Charpentier&#x27;s to feature tone clusters are Charles-Valentin Alkan&#x27;s &quot;Une fusée&quot; (A Rocket) Op. 55, published in 1859, and his &quot;Les Diablotins&quot; (The Imps), a miniature from the set of 49 &quot;Esquisses&quot; (sketches) for solo piano, published in 1861. 

There is also the solo piano piece &quot;Battle of Manassas&quot;, written in 1861 by &quot;Blind Tom&quot; Bethune and published in 1866. The score instructs the pianist to represent cannon fire at various points by striking &quot;with the flat of the hand, as many notes as possible, and with as much force as possible, at the bass of the piano.&quot; In 1887, Giuseppe Verdi became the first notable composer in the Western tradition to write an unmistakable chromatic cluster: the storm music with which &quot;Otello&quot; opens includes an organ cluster (C, C, D) that also has the longest notated duration of any scored musical texture known. The choral finale of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 features a tone cluster of great poignancy arising naturally out of voice leading to the words &quot;wird, der dich rief, dir geben&quot;:

Still, it was not before the second decade of the twentieth century that tone clusters assumed a recognized place in Western classical music practice.

===In classical music of the early 1900s===

&quot;Around 1910,&quot; Harold C. Schonberg writes, &quot;Percy Grainger was causing a stir by the near–tone clusters in such works as his &quot;Gumsuckers March.&quot;&quot; In 1911, what appears to be the first published classical composition to thoroughly integrate true tone clusters was issued: &quot;Tintamarre (The Clangor of Bells)&quot;, by Canadian composer J. Humfrey Anger (1862–1913).

Within a few years, the radical composer-pianist Leo Ornstein became one of the most famous figures in classical music on both sides of the Atlantic for his performances of cutting-edge work. In 1914, Ornstein debuted several of his own solo piano compositions: &quot;Wild Men&#x27;s Dance&quot; (aka &quot;Danse Sauvage&quot;; 1913–14), &quot;Impressions of the Thames&quot; ( 1913–14), and &quot;Impressions of Notre Dame&quot; ( 1913–14) were the first works to explore the tone cluster in depth ever heard by a substantial audience. &quot;Wild Men&#x27;s Dance&quot;, in particular, was constructed almost entirely out of clusters (). In 1918, critic Charles L. Buchanan described Ornstein&#x27;s innovation: &quot;[He] gives us masses of shrill, hard dissonances, chords consisting of anywhere from eight to a dozen notes made up of half tones heaped one upon another.&quot;

Clusters were also beginning to appear in more pieces by European composers. Isaac Albéniz&#x27;s use of them in &quot;Iberia&quot; (1905–1908) may have influenced Gabriel Fauré&#x27;s subsequent piano writing. Joseph Horowitz has suggested that the &quot;dissonant star clusters&quot; in its third and fourth books were particularly compelling to Olivier Messiaen, who called &quot;Iberia&quot; &quot;the wonder of the piano&quot;. The Thomas de Hartmann score for Wassily Kandinsky&#x27;s stage show &quot;The Yellow Sound&quot; (1909) employs a chromatic cluster at two climactic points. Alban Berg&#x27;s Four Pieces for clarinet and piano (1913) calls for clusters along with other avant-garde keyboard techniques. Claude Debussy&#x27;s Piano Prelude &quot;La Cathédrale Engloutie&quot; makes powerful use of clusters to evoke the sound of &quot;pealing bells – with so many added major seconds one would call this pan-diatonic harmony&quot;.

In his 1913 piano prelude &quot;General Lavine – Excentric&quot;, one of the first pieces to be influenced by black American popular styles (the Cakewalk) Debussy features abrasive tone clusters at the conclusion of the following passage:

In his 1915 arrangement for solo piano of his &quot;Six Epigraphes Antiques&quot; (1914), originally a set of piano duets, Debussy includes tone clusters in the fifth piece, &quot;Pour l&#x27;Egyptienne&quot;.

Russian composer Vladimir Rebikov used them extensively in his &quot;Three Idylles&quot;, Op. 50, written in 1913. Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;An Alpine Symphony&quot; (1915) &quot;starts and ends with the setting sun—a B flat minor chord cluster slowly built down.&quot;

Though much of his work was made public only years later, Charles Ives had been exploring the possibilities of the tone cluster—which he referred to as the &quot;group chord&quot;—for some time. In 1906–07, Ives composed his first mature piece to extensively feature tone clusters, &quot;Scherzo: Over the Pavements&quot;. Orchestrated for a nine-piece ensemble, it includes both black- and white-note clusters for the piano. Revised in 1913, it would not be recorded and published until the 1950s and would have to wait until 1963 to receive its first public performance. During the same period that Ornstein was introducing tone clusters to the concert stage, Ives was developing a piece with what would become the most famous set of clusters: in the second movement, &quot;Hawthorne&quot;, of the &quot;Concord&quot; Sonata ( 1904–1915, publ. 1920, prem. 1928, rev. 1947), mammoth piano chords require a wooden bar almost fifteen inches long to play. The gentle clusters produced by the felt- or flannel-covered bar represent the sound of far-off church bells (). Later in the movement, there are a series of five-note diatonic clusters for the right hand. In his notes to the score, Ives indicates that &quot;these group-chords...may, if the player feels like it, be hit with the clenched fist.&quot; Between 1911 and 1913, Ives also wrote ensemble pieces with tone clusters such as his Second String Quartet and the orchestral &quot;Decoration Day&quot; and &quot;Fourth of July&quot;, though none of these would be publicly performed before the 1930s.

===In the work of Henry Cowell===
In June 1913, a sixteen-year-old Californian with no formal musical training wrote a solo piano piece, &quot;Adventures in Harmony&quot;, employing &quot;primitive tone clusters&quot;. Henry Cowell would soon emerge as the seminal figure in promoting the cluster harmonic technique. Ornstein abandoned the concert stage in the early 1920s and, anyway, clusters had served him as practical harmonic devices, not as part of a larger theoretical mission. In the case of Ives, clusters comprised a relatively small part of his compositional output, much of which went unheard for years. For the intellectually ambitious Cowell—who heard Ornstein perform in New York in 1916—clusters were crucial to the future of music. He set out to explore their &quot;overall, cumulative, and often programmatic effects&quot;.

&quot;Dynamic Motion&quot; (1916) for solo piano, written when Cowell was nineteen, has been described as &quot;probably the first piece anywhere using secundal chords independently for musical extension and variation.&quot; Though that is not quite accurate, it does appear to be the first piece to employ chromatic clusters in such a manner. A solo piano piece Cowell wrote the following year, &quot;The Tides of Manaunaun&quot; (1917), would prove to be his most popular work and the composition most responsible for establishing the tone cluster as a significant element in Western classical music. (Cowell&#x27;s early piano works are often erroneously dated; in the two cases above, as 1914 and 1912, respectively.) Assumed by some to involve an essentially random—or, more kindly, aleatoric—pianistic approach, Cowell would explain that precision is required in the writing and performance of tone clusters no less than with any other musical feature:

Tone clusters...on the piano [are] whole scales of tones used as chords, or at least three contiguous tones along a scale being used as a chord. And, at times, if these chords exceed the number of tones that you have fingers on your hand, it may be necessary to play these either with the flat of the hand or sometimes with the full forearm. This is not done from the standpoint of trying to devise a new piano technique, although it actually amounts to that, but rather because this is the only practicable method of playing such large chords. It should be obvious that these chords are exact and that one practices diligently in order to play them with the desired tone quality and to have them absolutely precise in nature.

Historian and critic Kyle Gann describes the broad range of ways in which Cowell constructed (and thus performed) his clusters and used them as musical textures, &quot;sometimes with a top note brought out melodically, sometimes accompanying a left-hand melody in parallel.&quot;

Beginning in 1921, with an article serialized in &quot;The Freeman&quot;, an Irish cultural journal, Cowell popularized the term &quot;tone cluster&quot;. While he did not coin the phrase, as is often claimed, he appears to have been the first to use it with its current meaning. During the 1920s and 1930s, Cowell toured widely through North America and Europe, playing his own experimental works, many built around tone clusters. In addition to &quot;The Tides of Manaunaun&quot;, &quot;Dynamic Motion&quot;, and its five &quot;encores&quot;—&quot;What&#x27;s This&quot; (1917), &quot;Amiable Conversation&quot; (1917), &quot;Advertisement&quot; (1917), &quot;Antinomy&quot; (1917, rev. 1959; frequently misspelled &quot;Antimony&quot;), and &quot;Time Table&quot; (1917)—these include &quot;The Voice of Lir&quot; (1920), &quot;Exultation&quot; (1921), &quot;The Harp of Life&quot; (1924), &quot;Snows of Fujiyama&quot; (1924), &quot;Lilt of the Reel&quot; (1930), and &quot;Deep Color&quot; (1938). &quot;Tiger&quot; (1930) has a chord of 53 notes, probably the largest ever written for a single instrument until 1969. Along with Ives, Cowell wrote some of the first large-ensemble pieces to make extensive use of clusters. &quot;The Birth of Motion&quot; ( 1920), his earliest such effort, combines orchestral clusters with glissando. &quot;Tone Cluster&quot;, the second movement of Cowell&#x27;s Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (1928, prem. 1978), employs a wide variety of clusters for the piano and each instrumental group (). From a quarter-century later, his Symphony No. 11 (1953) features a sliding chromatic cluster played by muted violins.

In his theoretical work &quot;New Musical Resources&quot; (1930), a major influence on the classical avant-garde for many decades, Cowell argued that clusters should not be employed simply for color:

In harmony it is often better for the sake of consistency to maintain a whole succession of clusters, once they are begun; since one alone, or even two, may be heard as a mere effect, rather than as an independent and significant procedure, carried with musical logic to its inevitable conclusion.
===In later classical music===

In 1922, composer Dane Rudhyar, a friend of Cowell&#x27;s, declared approvingly that the development of the tone cluster &quot;imperilled [the] existence&quot; of &quot;the musical unit, the note&quot;. While that threat was not to be realized, clusters began to appear in the works of a growing number of composers. Already, Aaron Copland had written his &quot;Three Moods&quot; (aka &quot;Trois Esquisses&quot;; 1920–21) for piano—its name an apparent homage to a piece of Leo Ornstein&#x27;s—which includes a triple-forte cluster. The most renowned composer to be directly inspired by Cowell&#x27;s demonstrations of his tone cluster pieces was Béla Bartók, who requested Cowell&#x27;s permission to employ the method. Bartók&#x27;s First Piano Concerto, Piano Sonata, and the &quot;Night Music&quot; from the &quot;Out of Doors&quot; suite (all 1926), his first significant works after three years in which he produced little, extensively feature tone clusters.

In the 1930s, Cowell&#x27;s student Lou Harrison utilized keyboard clusters in several works such as his Prelude for Grandpiano (1937). At least as far back as 1942, John Cage, who also studied under Cowell, began writing piano pieces with cluster chords; &quot;In the Name of the Holocaust&quot;, from December of that year, includes chromatic, diatonic, and pentatonic clusters. Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Vingt regards sur l&#x27;enfant Jésus&quot; (1944), often described as the most important solo piano piece of the first half of the twentieth century, employs clusters throughout. They would feature in numerous subsequent piano works, by a range of composers. Karlheinz Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Klavierstück X&quot; (1961) makes bold, rhetorical use of chromatic clusters, scaled in seven degrees of width, from three to thirty-six semitones, as well as ascending and descending cluster arpeggios and cluster glissandi. Written two decades later, his &quot;Klavierstück XIII&quot; employs many of the same techniques, along with clusters that call for the pianist to sit down on the keyboard. George Crumb&#x27;s &quot;Apparitions, Elegiac Songs, and Vocalises for Soprano and Amplified Piano&quot; (1979), a setting of verse by Walt Whitman, is filled with clusters, including an enormous one that introduces three of its sections. The piano part of the second movement of Joseph Schwantner&#x27;s song cycle &quot;Magabunda&quot; (1983) has perhaps the single largest chord ever written for an individual instrument: all 88 notes on the keyboard.

While tone clusters are conventionally associated with the piano, and the solo piano repertoire in particular, they have also assumed important roles in compositions for chamber groups and larger ensembles. Robert Reigle identifies Croatian composer Josip Slavenski&#x27;s organ-and-violin &quot;Sonata Religiosa&quot; (1925), with its sustained chromatic clusters, as &quot;a missing link between Ives and [György] Ligeti.&quot; Bartók employs both diatonic and chromatic clusters in his Fourth String Quartet (1928). The sound mass technique in such works as Ruth Crawford Seeger&#x27;s String Quartet (1931) and Iannis Xenakis&#x27;s &quot;Metastaseis&quot; (1955) is an elaboration of the tone cluster. &quot;Unlike most tonal and non-tonal linear dissonances, tone clusters are essentially static. The individual pitches are of secondary importance; it is the sound mass that is foremost.&quot; In one of the most famous pieces associated with the sound mass aesthetic, containing, &quot;one of the largest clustering of individual pitches that has been written&quot;, Krzysztof Penderecki&#x27;s &quot;Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima&quot; (1959), for fifty-two string instruments, the quarter-tone clusters &quot;see[m] to have abstracted and intensified the features that define shrieks of terror and keening cries of sorrow.&quot; Clusters appear in two sections of the electronic music of Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Kontakte&quot; (1958–1960)—first as &quot;hammering points...very difficult to synthesize&quot;, according to Robin Maconie, then as glissandi. In 1961, Ligeti wrote perhaps the largest cluster chord ever—in the orchestral &quot;Atmosphères&quot;, every note in the chromatic scale over a range of five octaves is played at once (quietly). Ligeti&#x27;s organ works make extensive use of clusters. &quot;Volumina&quot; (1961–62), graphically notated, consists of static and mobile cluster masses, and calls on many advanced cluster-playing techniques.

The eighth movement of Messiaen&#x27;s oratorio &quot;La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ&quot; (1965–1969) features &quot;a shimmering halo of tone-cluster glissandi&quot; in the strings, evoking the &quot;bright cloud&quot; to which the narrative refers (). Orchestral clusters are employed throughout Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Fresco&quot; (1969) and &quot;Trans&quot; (1971). In Morton Feldman&#x27;s &quot;Rothko Chapel&quot; (1971), &quot;Wordless vocal tone clusters seep out through the skeletal arrangements of viola, celeste, and percussion.&quot; Aldo Clementi&#x27;s chamber ensemble piece &quot;Ceremonial&quot; (1973) evokes both Verdi and Ives, combining the original extended-duration and mass cluster concepts: a weighted wooden board placed on an electric harmonium maintains a tone cluster throughout the work. Judith Bingham&#x27;s &quot;Prague&quot; (1995) gives a brass band the opportunity to create tone clusters. Keyboard clusters are set against orchestral forces in piano concertos such as Einojuhani Rautavaara&#x27;s first (1969) and Esa-Pekka Salonen&#x27;s (2007), the latter suggestive of Messiaen. The choral compositions of Eric Whitacre often employ clusters, as a trademark of his style. Whitacre&#x27;s chord clusters are fundamentally based around voice leading and not easily interpretable by traditional harmonic analysis.

Three composers who made frequent use of tone clusters for a wide variety of ensembles are Giacinto Scelsi, Alfred Schnittke—both of whom often worked with them in microtonal contexts—and Lou Harrison. Scelsi employed them for much of his career, including in his last large-scale work, &quot;Pfhat&quot; (1974), which premiered in 1986. They are found in works of Schnittke&#x27;s ranging from the Quintet for Piano and Strings (1972–1976), where &quot;microtonal strings fin[d] tone clusters between the cracks of the piano keys&quot;, to the choral &quot;Psalms of Repentance&quot; (1988). Harrison&#x27;s many pieces featuring clusters include &quot;Pacifika Rondo&quot; (1963), Concerto for Organ with Percussion (1973), Piano Concerto (1983–1985), Three Songs for male chorus (1985), Grand Duo (1988), and &quot;Rhymes with Silver&quot; (1996).

===In jazz===

Tone clusters have been employed by jazz artists in a variety of styles, since the very beginning of the form. Around the turn of the twentieth century, Storyville pianist Jelly Roll Morton began performing a ragtime adaptation of a French quadrille, introducing large chromatic tone clusters played by his left forearm. The growling effect led Morton to dub the piece his &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; (). In 1909, Scott Joplin&#x27;s deliberately experimental &quot;Wall Street Rag&quot; included a section prominently featuring notated tone clusters.

The fourth of Artie Matthews&#x27;s &quot;Pastime Rags&quot; (1913–1920) features dissonant right-hand clusters. Thelonious Monk, in pieces such as &quot;Bright Mississippi&quot; (1962), &quot;Introspection&quot; (1946) and &quot;Off Minor&quot; (1947), uses clusters as dramatic figures within the central improvisation and to accent the tension at its conclusion. They are heard on Art Tatum&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Freddy Blues&quot; (1950), undergirding the cross-rhythms. By 1953, Dave Brubeck was employing piano tone clusters and dissonance in a manner anticipating the style free jazz pioneer Cecil Taylor would soon develop. The approach of hard bop pianist Horace Silver is an even clearer antecedent to Taylor&#x27;s use of clusters. During the same era, clusters appear as punctuation marks in the lead lines of Herbie Nichols. In &quot;The Gig&quot; (1955), described by Francis Davis as Nichols&#x27;s masterpiece, &quot;clashing notes and tone clusters depic[t] a pickup band at odds with itself about what to play.&quot; Recorded examples of Duke Ellington&#x27;s piano cluster work include &quot;Summertime&quot; (1961) and &quot;...And His Mother Called Him Bill&quot; (1967) and &quot;This One&#x27;s for Blanton!&quot;, his tribute to a former bass player, recorded in 1972 with bassist Ray Brown. Bill Evans&#x27; interpretation of &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot; from the album &quot;Portrait in Jazz&quot; (1960), opens with a striking 5-tone cluster.

In jazz, as in classical music, tone clusters have not been restricted to the keyboard. In the 1930s, the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra&#x27;s &quot;Stratosphere&quot; included ensemble clusters among an array of progressive elements. The Stan Kenton Orchestra&#x27;s April 1947 recording of &quot;If I Could Be With You One Hour Tonight&quot;, arranged by Pete Rugolo, features a dramatic four-note trombone cluster at the end of the second chorus. As described by critic Fred Kaplan, a 1950 performance by the Duke Ellington Orchestra features arrangements with the collective &quot;blowing rich, dark, tone clusters that evoke Ravel&quot;. Chord clusters also feature in the scores of arranger Gil Evans. In his characteristically imaginative arrangement of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s a boat that&#x27;s leaving soon for New York&quot; from the album &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, Evans contributes chord clusters orchestrated on flutes, alto saxophone and muted trumpets as a background to accompany Miles Davis&#x27; solo improvisation. In the early 1960s, arrangements by Bob Brookmeyer and Gerry Mulligan for Mulligan&#x27;s Concert Jazz Band employed tone clusters in a dense style bringing to mind both Ellington and Ravel. Eric Dolphy&#x27;s bass clarinet solos would often feature &quot;microtonal clusters summoned by frantic overblowing&quot;. Critic Robert Palmer called the &quot;tart tone cluster&quot; that &quot;pierces a song&#x27;s surfaces and penetrates to its heart&quot; a specialty of guitarist Jim Hall&#x27;s.

Clusters are especially prevalent in the realm of free jazz. Cecil Taylor has used them extensively as part of his improvisational method since the mid-1950s. Like much of his musical vocabulary, his clusters operate &quot;on a continuum somewhere between melody and percussion&quot;. One of Taylor&#x27;s primary purposes in adopting clusters was to avoid the dominance of any specific pitch. Leading free jazz composer, bandleader, and pianist Sun Ra often used them to rearrange the musical furniture, as described by scholar John F. Szwed:

When he sensed that [a] piece needed an introduction or an ending, a new direction or fresh material, he would call for a space chord, a collectively improvised tone cluster at high volume which &quot;would suggest a new melody, maybe a rhythm.&quot; It was a pianistically conceived device which created another context for the music, a new mood, opening up fresh tonal areas.

As free jazz spread in the 1960s, so did the use of tone clusters. In comparison with what John Litweiler describes as Taylor&#x27;s &quot;endless forms and contrasts&quot;, the solos of Muhal Richard Abrams employ tone clusters in a similarly free, but more lyrical, flowing context. Guitarist Sonny Sharrock made them a central part of his improvisations; in Palmer&#x27;s description, he executed &quot;glass-shattering tone clusters that sounded like someone was ripping the pickups out of the guitar without having bothered to unplug it from its overdriven amplifier.&quot; Pianist Marilyn Crispell has been another major free jazz proponent of the tone cluster, frequently in collaboration with Anthony Braxton, who played with Abrams early in his career. Since the 1990s, Matthew Shipp has built on Taylor&#x27;s innovations with the form. European free jazz pianists who have contributed to the development of the tone cluster palette include Gunter Hampel and Alexander von Schlippenbach.

Don Pullen, who bridged free and mainstream jazz, &quot;had a technique of rolling his wrists as he improvised—the outside edges of his hands became scarred from it—to create moving tone clusters&quot;, writes critic Ben Ratliff. &quot;Building up from arpeggios, he could create eddies of noise on the keyboard...like concise Cecil Taylor outbursts.&quot; In the description of Joachim Berendt, Pullen &quot;uniquely melodized cluster playing and made it tonal. He phrases impulsively raw clusters with his right hand and yet embeds them in clear, harmonically functional tonal chords simultaneously played with the left hand.&quot; John Medeski employs tone clusters as keyboardist for Medeski Martin &amp; Wood, which mixes free jazz elements into its soul jazz/jam band style.

===In popular music===
Like jazz, rock and roll has made use of tone clusters since its birth, if characteristically in a less deliberate manner—most famously, Jerry Lee Lewis&#x27;s live-performance piano technique of the 1950s, involving fists, feet, and derrière. Since the 1960s, much drone music, which crosses the lines between rock, electronic, and experimental music, has been based on tone clusters. On The Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;Sister Ray&quot;, recorded in September 1967, organist John Cale uses tone clusters within the context of a drone; the song is apparently the closest approximation on record of the band&#x27;s early live sound. Around the same time, Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek began introducing clusters into his solos during live performances of the band&#x27;s hit &quot;Light My Fire&quot;.

Kraftwerk&#x27;s self-titled 1970 debut album employs organ clusters to add variety to its repeated tape sequences. In 1971, critic Ed Ward lauded the &quot;tone-cluster vocal harmonies&quot; created by Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s three lead singers, Grace Slick, Marty Balin, and Paul Kantner. Tangerine Dream&#x27;s 1972 double album &quot;Zeit&quot; is replete with clusters performed on synthesizer. The Beatles&#x27; 1965 song &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; features a momentarily grating tone cluster with voices singing A sharp and C sharp against the accompanying keyboard playing a sustained chord on B to the word &quot;time&quot;. The Band&#x27;s 1968 song &quot;The Weight&quot; from their debut album &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot; features a dissonant vocal refrain with suspensions culminating in a 3-note cluster to the words &quot;you put the load right on me.&quot;

The sound of tone clusters played on the organ became a convention in radio drama for dreams. Clusters are often used in the scoring of horror and science-fiction films. For a 2004 production of the play &quot;Tone Clusters&quot; by Joyce Carol Oates, composer Jay Clarke—a member of the indie rock bands Dolorean and The Standard—employed clusters to &quot;subtly build the tension&quot;, in contrast to what he perceived in the cluster pieces by Cowell and Ives suggested by Oates: &quot;Some of it was like music to murder somebody to; it was like horror-movie music.&quot;

==Use in other music==
In traditional Japanese &quot;gagaku&quot;, the imperial court music, a tone cluster performed on &quot;shō&quot; (a type of mouth organ) is generally employed as a harmonic matrix. Yoritsune Matsudaira, active from the late 1920s to the early 2000s, merged &quot;gagaku&quot;″s harmonies and tonalities with avant-garde Western techniques. Much of his work is built on the &quot;shō&quot;″s ten traditional cluster formations. Lou Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Pacifika Rondo&quot;, which mixes Eastern and Western instrumentation and styles, mirrors the &quot;gagaku&quot; approach—sustained organ clusters emulate the sound and function of the &quot;shō&quot;. The &quot;shō&quot; also inspired Benjamin Britten in creating the instrumental texture of his 1964 dramatic church parable &quot;Curlew River&quot;. Its sound pervades the characteristically sustained cluster chords played on a chamber organ . Traditional Korean court and aristocratic music employs passages of simultaneous ornamentation on multiple instruments, creating dissonant clusters; this technique is reflected in the work of twentieth-century Korean German composer Isang Yun.

Several East Asian free reed instruments, including the &quot;shō&quot;, were modeled on the &quot;sheng&quot;, an ancient Chinese folk instrument later incorporated into more formal musical contexts. &quot;Wubaduhesheng&quot;, one of the traditional chord formations played on the &quot;sheng&quot;, involves a three-pitch cluster. Malayan folk musicians employ an indigenous mouth organ that, like the &quot;shō&quot; and &quot;sheng&quot;, produces tone clusters. The characteristic musical form played on the &quot;bin-baja&quot;, a strummed harp of central India&#x27;s Pardhan people, has been described as a &quot;rhythmic ostinato on a tone cluster&quot;.

Among the Asante, in the region that is today encompassed by Ghana, tone clusters are used in traditional trumpet music. A distinctive &quot;tongue-rattling technique gives a greater vibrancy to...already dissonant tonal cluster[s]... [I]ntentional dissonance dispels evil spirits, and the greater the clangor, the greater the sound barrage.

<text>The Stratford Festival is a theatre festival which runs from April to October in the city of Stratford, Ontario, Canada. Founded by local journalist Tom Patterson in 1952, the festival was formerly known as the Stratford Shakespearean Festival, the Shakespeare Festival and the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. The festival was one of the first arts festivals in Canada and continues to be one of its most prominent. It is recognized worldwide for its productions of Shakespearean plays.

The festival&#x27;s primary focus is to present productions of William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, but it has a range of theatre productions from Greek tragedy to Broadway musicals and contemporary works. In the early years of the festival, Shakespeare&#x27;s works typically represented approximately one third of the offerings in the largest venue, the Festival Theatre. More recently, however, the festival&#x27;s focus has shifted to encompass works by a more diverse range of playwrights.

The success of the festival changed Stratford into a city where arts and tourism play important roles in the economy. The festival attracts many tourists from outside Canada, most notably British and American visitors.

==History==
The Festival was founded as the Stratford Shakespearean Festival of Canada, by Tom Patterson, a Stratford-native journalist who wanted to revitalize his town&#x27;s economy by creating a theatre festival dedicated to the works of William Shakespeare, as the town shares the name of Shakespeare&#x27;s birthplace, Stratford-upon-Avon, England. Stratford was a railway junction and major locomotive shop, and was facing a disastrous loss of employment with the imminent elimination of steam power. Patterson achieved his goal after gaining encouragement from Mayor David Simpson and the local council, and the Stratford Shakespearean Festival became a legal entity on October 31, 1952.

Already established in Canadian theatre, Dora Mavor Moore helped put Patterson in touch with British actor and director Tyrone Guthrie, first with a transatlantic telephone call. On July 13, 1953, actor Alec Guinness spoke the first lines of the first play produced by the festival, a production of &quot;Richard III&quot;: &quot;Now is the winter of our discontent / Made glorious summer by this son of York.&quot; Guinness and Irene Worth were among the cast of Stratford&#x27;s inaugural performance of &quot;Richard III&quot;, working for expenses only.

This first performances (like the entire first four seasons) took place in a concrete amphitheatre covered by giant canvas tent on the banks of the River Avon. The first of many years of Stratford Shakespeare Festival production history started with a six-week season opening on 13 July 1953 with &quot;Richard III&quot; and then &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;, both starring Alec Guinness. The 1954 season ran for nine weeks and included Sophocles’ &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; and two Shakespeare plays, &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; and &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;. Young actors during the first four seasons included several who went on to great success in subsequent years, Douglas Campbell, Timothy Findley, Don Harron, William Hutt and Douglas Rain.

Fundraising to build a permanent theatre was slow but was helped significantly by donations from Governor General Vincent Massey and the Perth Mutual Insurance Company. The new Festival Theatre was dedicated on 30 June 1957, with seating for over 1,800 people; no seats are more than 65 feet from the stage. The design was deliberately intended to resemble a huge tent. That season&#x27;s productions included &quot;Hamlet,&quot; &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, the satirical &quot;My Fur Lady,&quot; &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; and Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;.

The Festival Theatre&#x27;s thrust stage was designed by British designer Tanya Moiseiwitsch to resemble both a classic Greek amphitheatre and Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe Theatre. It has since become a model for other stages in North America and Great Britain.

Tony Award-nominee Scott Wentworth has performed in the festival&#x27;s stage productions on numerous occasions since 1985, beginning with &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;; the festival has helped Sara Topham launch her career in acting, performing from 2000 to 2011; and a young, unknown Christopher Walken appeared in Stratford&#x27;s 1968 stage productions of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, portraying Romeo and Lysander respectively.

Long-serving Artistic Director Richard Monette retired in 2007 after holding the position for fourteen seasons. He was replaced with an artistic team consisting of General Director Antoni Cimolino and Artistic Directors Marti Maraden, Des McAnuff, and Don Shipley. On March 12, 2008, it was announced that Shipley and Maraden would be stepping down, leaving Des McAnuff as sole Artistic Director. In 2013, Des McAnuff was replaced by Antoni Cimolino as Artistic Director.

In 2012, the Festival had a deficit of $3.4 million, but by 2015 had a surplus of $3.1 million under the control of Cimolino and executive director Anita Gaffney. The target of a half million ticket sales for the season (a previous record) had not yet been reached, but had achieved a significant increase in the number of new patrons to the theatres.

On 17 February 2015, AP News reported that the Stratford Shakespeare Festival plans to film all of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays.

Actors who have participated in the festival include Alan Bates, Brian Bedford, Domini Blythe, Barbara Bryne, Martha Burns, Jackie Burroughs, Zoe Caldwell, Douglas Campbell, Len Cariou, Brent Carver, Patricia Conolly, Susan Coyne, Jack Creley, Jonathan Crombie, Hume Cronyn, Henry Czerny, Cynthia Dale, Brian Dennehy, Colm Feore, Megan Follows, Maureen Forrester, Lorne Greene, Dawn Greenhalgh, Paul Gross, Alec Guinness, Amelia Hall, Uta Hagen, Julie Harris, Don Harron, Martha Henry, William Hutt, Frances Hyland, Charmion King, Andrea Martin, Barbara March, James Mason, Roberta Maxwell, Eric McCormack, Seana McKenna, Loreena McKennitt, Richard Monette, John Neville, Stephen Ouimette, Lucy Peacock, Nicholas Pennell, David J. Phillips, Amanda Plummer, Christopher Plummer, Sarah Polley, Douglas Rain, Kate Reid, Jason Robards, Alan Scarfe, Paul Scofield, Goldie Semple, William Shatner, Maggie Smith, Jessica Tandy, Peter Ustinov, Christopher Walken, Al Waxman, Irene Worth, Geraint Wyn Davies and Janet Wright.

Female directors at Stratford have included Pam Brighton, Zoe Caldwell, Marigold Charlseworth, Donna Feore, Jill Keiley, Pamela Hawthorne, Martha Henry, Jeannette Lambermont, Diana Leblanc, Marti Maraden, Weyni Mengesha, Carey Perloff, Lorraine Pintal, Vanessa Porteous, Susan H. Schulman, Djanet Sears, Kathryn Shaw, Jennifer Tarver.

From 1956 to 1961 and 1971 to 1976, the Stratford Festival also staged the separate Stratford Film Festival, which was credited as one of the first North American film festivals ever to schedule international films. That festival collapsed after the 1976 launch of the Festival of Festivals, now known as the Toronto International Film Festival, impacted both the Stratford Film Festival&#x27;s funding and its audience.

In 2011, the visual artist, Chris Klein, started producing a series of paintings depicting the costumes from festival costume warehouse, having served as their Head of Scenic Art from 2007 to 2015.

In March 2020, as preparations for the upcoming season were underway, the Festival was forced to announce performance cancellations and layoffs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A month later, the entire 2020 season was put on hold and effectively cancelled. Just before the season&#x27;s cancellation, Cimolino announced that all productions that had been filmed as part of the &quot;Stratford Festival On Film&quot; series would be streamed online for free, with a different production being shown each week. Throughout the summer of 2020, the Festival produced four web series which, along with all the filmed productions and other Stratford documentaries and interviews, were launched in October 2020 on the new Stratfest@Home web streaming service.

In April 2021, the Festival announced a season of plays and cabarets, with most productions being held under large canopies at the Festival and Tom Patterson Theatres. Only one late-opening production was held indoors at the Studio Theatre with reduced capacity. The theme for the 2021 season was metamorphosis.

In May of 2022, the Festival officially opened the rebuilt Tom Patterson Theatre. Designed by Toronto-based architect, Siamak Hariri, the building overlooks the Avon river and sits on the site of the previous Tom Patterson space. The project cost an estimated 100 million dollars (CAD) and was funded by private donations with support from both provincial and federal governments.

==Today==
The Festival traditionally runs from April to October, and has four permanent venues: the Festival Theatre, the Avon Theatre, the Tom Patterson Theatre, and the Studio Theatre. Although the Festival&#x27;s primary mandate is to produce the works of Shakespeare, its season playbills include contemporary works and at least one musical, as well as the classic repertory. The Stratford Festival Forum runs during the season, and features music concerts, readings from major authors, lectures, and discussions with actors or management.

The Stratford Festival is an industry partner of the University of Waterloo Stratford Campus.

<text>The official [[flag]] of [[Wallis and Futuna]] is the French national flag, as it is a French territory. Wallis and Futuna has a locally used unofficial flag which bears the French flag in the canton.

==Description==
The unofficial flag of Wallis and Futuna features a red saltire on a white square, which in turn is placed on a red field (alternatively, a larger white cross pattée is used). The cross is shifted a little off centre toward the fly (outer edge). The cross pattée is also shifted slightly downwards. The flag of France, outlined in white on two sides, is in the upper hoist quadrant. This flag is used to represent Wallis and Futuna at events such as the Pacific Games. For official occasions, the French flag is used.

==Subdivision flags==
The three constituent kingdoms of Wallis and Futuna have separate royal standards:

<text>British Leyland was a British automotive engineering and manufacturing conglomerate formed in 1968 as British Leyland Motor Corporation Ltd (BLMC), following the merger of Leyland Motors and British Motor Holdings. It was partly nationalised in 1975, when the UK government created a holding company called British Leyland, later renamed BL in 1978. It incorporated much of the British-owned motor vehicle industry, which in 1968 had a 40% share of the UK car market, with its history going back to 1895. Despite containing profitable marques such as Jaguar, Rover, and Land Rover, as well as the best-selling Mini, BLMC had a troubled history, leading to its eventual collapse in 1975 and subsequent part-nationalisation.

After much restructuring and divestment of subsidiary companies, BL was renamed the Rover Group in 1986, becoming a subsidiary of British Aerospace from 1988 to 1994, then was subsequently bought by BMW. The final surviving incarnation of the company as the MG Rover Group went into administration in 2005, bringing mass car production by British-owned manufacturers to an end. MG and the Austin, Morris and Wolseley marques became part of China&#x27;s SAIC, with whom MG Rover attempted to merge prior to administration. As of 2024, Mini, Jaguar Land Rover, Leyland Trucks, and Unipart are the most prominent former parts of British Leyland that still exist, with SAIC still operating its UK base out of the former Longbridge site.

==History==
===1968–1974: Creation of BLMC, and the Stokes era===
BLMC was founded on 17 January 1968 by the merger of British Motor Holdings (BMH) and Leyland Motor Corporation (LMC), encouraged by Tony Benn as chairman of the Industrial Reorganisation Committee created by the first Wilson Government. At the time, LMC was a highly successful truck and bus manufacturer – as well as owning prosperous car brands Triumph and Rover – whilst BMH (which was the product of an earlier merger between the British Motor Corporation, Pressed Steel and Jaguar) was perilously close to collapse. The government was hopeful LMC&#x27;s expertise would revive the ailing BMH, and effectively create a &quot;British General Motors&quot;. The merger combined most of the remaining independent British car manufacturing companies and included car, bus and truck manufacturers and more diverse enterprises including: construction equipment, refrigerators, metal casting companies, road surface manufacturers; in all, nearly one hundred different companies. The new corporation was arranged into seven divisions under its new chairman, Sir Donald Stokes (formerly the chairman of LMC). At the time of its founding, BLMC was the world&#x27;s fifth largest vehicle manufacturer after General Motors, Ford, Chrysler and Volkswagen.

The seven divisions were:
*&quot;Austin-Morris&quot;; the volume car division made up entirely of the former British Motor Corporation marques (Austin, Morris, MG, Riley and Wolseley), as well as Austin and BMC branded light commercial vehicles.
*&quot;Specialist Division&quot;; the sports/luxury marques (Rover, Land Rover, Alvis, Triumph and Jaguar – the latter having moved across from the old BMC/BMH organisation). 
*&quot;Leyland Truck and Bus&quot;; the original Leyland commercial vehicles business.
*&quot;Pressed Steel Fisher&quot; (PSF); had its origins in the Pressed Steel Company which had been a BMH subsidiary that made car body shells for both BLMC and other manufacturers. 
*&quot;Overseas&quot;; made up largely of BLMC&#x27;s satellite car manufacturing operations around the world – many of these had been inherited from BMH.
*&quot;Construction Equipment&quot;
*&quot;General Engineering &amp; Foundries&quot;

While BMH was the UK&#x27;s largest car manufacturer (producing over twice as many cars as LMC), it offered a range of dated vehicles, including the Morris Minor which was introduced in 1948 and the Austin Cambridge and Morris Oxford, which dated back to 1959. Although BMH had enjoyed great success in the 1960s with both the Mini and the 1100/1300, both cars were infamously underpriced and despite their pioneering but unproven front wheel drive engineering, warranty costs had been crippling and had badly eroded those models&#x27; profitability.

After the merger, Lord Stokes was horrified to find that BMH had no plans to replace the elderly designs in its portfolio. Also, BMH&#x27;s design efforts immediately prior to the merger had focused on unfortunate niche market models such as the Austin Maxi (which was underdeveloped and with an appearance hampered by using the doors from the larger Austin 1800) and the Austin 3-litre, a car with no discernible place in the market.

The lack of attention to the development of new mass-market models meant that BMH had nothing in the way of new models in the pipeline to compete effectively with popular rivals such as Ford&#x27;s Escort and Cortina.

Immediately, Lord Stokes instigated plans to design and introduce new models quickly. The first result of this crash programme was the Morris Marina in early-1971. It used parts from various BL models with new bodywork to produce BL&#x27;s mass-market competitor. It was one of the strongest-selling cars in the United Kingdom during the 1970s; being the second-most popular new car sold in Britain in 1973, though by the end of production in 1980 it was widely regarded as a dismal product that had damaged the company&#x27;s reputation. The Austin Allegro (replacement for the 1100/1300 ranges), launched in 1973, gained a similar reputation over its ten-year production life.

The company became an infamous monument to the industrial turmoil that plagued the United Kingdom during the 1970s. Action by unions frequently brought BL&#x27;s manufacturing capability to its knees. Despite the duplication of production facilities as a result of the merger, there were multiple single points of failure in the company&#x27;s production network which meant that a strike in a single plant could stop many of the others. Domestic rivals Ford and General Motors mitigated against this by merging their previously separate British and German subsidiaries and product lines (Ford combined Ford of Britain and Ford Germany to create Ford of Europe, whilst GM eventually merged the operations of Vauxhall and Opel), so that production could be sourced from either British or Continental European plants in the event of industrial unrest. The upshot was that both Ford and Vauxhall ultimately overtook BL to become Britain&#x27;s two best-selling marques. At the same time, a tide of Japanese imports, spearheaded by Nissan (Datsun) and Toyota exploited both BL&#x27;s inability to supply its customers and its declining reputation for quality. Continental carmakers including Fiat, Renault and Volkswagen were also achieving strong sales on the British market.

By the end of the 1970s, the UK Government had introduced protectionist measures in the form of import quotas on Japanese manufacturers to protect the ailing domestic producers (both BL and Chrysler Europe), which it was helping to sustain.

At its peak, BLMC owned almost forty manufacturing plants across the country. Even before the merger, BMH had included theoretically competing marques that were in fact selling substantially similar badge engineered cars. The British Motor Corporation had never properly integrated either the dealer networks or the production facilities of Austin and Morris. This had been done partly to appease poor industrial relations, as decades old rivalries between Austin and Morris workers at Longbridge and Cowley respectively, had persisted after the 1952 merger and creation of BMC. The upshot was that both plants were producing badge engineered models of otherwise identical Austin and Morris cars so that each dealer network would have a product to sell. This meant that Austin and Morris still, to an extent, competed with each other and meant that each product was saddled with effectively twice the logistics, marketing and distribution costs that it would have if sold under a single name or if production of a single model platform was concentrated in one factory. Although BL &quot;did&quot; eventually end the wasteful double sourcing – for example production of the Mini and the 1100/1300 was concentrated at Longbridge, whilst the 1800 and Austin Maxi ranges moved to Cowley, the production of sub-assemblies as well as component suppliers were scattered all over the Midlands which greatly increased the cost of keeping the factories running.

BMH and Leyland Motors had expanded and acquired companies throughout the 1950s and 1960s which were in direct competition with each other, with the result that when the two conglomerates were brought together into BL there was even more internal competition. Rover competed with Jaguar at the expensive end of the market, and Triumph with its family cars and sports cars against Austin, Morris and MG. Internal politics became so bad that one marque&#x27;s team would attempt to derail another marque&#x27;s programmes.

Individual model lines that were similarly sized were therefore competing against each other, yet were never discontinued nor were model ranges rationalised quickly enough; in fact, the policy of having multiple models competing in the same market segment continued long after the merger – for instance BMH&#x27;s MGB remained in production alongside LMC&#x27;s Triumph TR6, the Rover P5 competed with the Jaguar XJ, whilst in the medium family sector, the Princess was in direct competition with upscale versions of the Morris Marina and Austin Maxi, meaning that economies of scale resulting from large production runs could never be realised. In addition, in consequent attempts to establish British Leyland as a brand in consumers&#x27; minds in and outside the UK, print ads and spots were produced, causing confusion rather than attraction for buyers.

BL marketing and management attempted to draw more obvious distinctions between the marques – most notable was the decision to pitch Morris as a maker of conventional mass-market cars to compete with Ford and Vauxhall and Austin to continue BMC&#x27;s line of advanced family cars with front-wheel drive and fluid suspension. This resulted in the development of the Morris Marina and the Austin Allegro. The policy&#x27;s success was mixed. Since the dealership network was still not sufficiently rationalised it meant that Austin and Morris dealers (which had, in BMC/BMH days, each offered a full range of cars both advanced and traditional) had their product range halved and found that they could no longer cater to many previously loyal customers&#x27; tastes. The policy was also carried out haphazardly: The advanced, Hydragas-sprung Princess began life in 1975 sold as an Austin, a Morris and a Wolseley before being rebadged altogether under the new Princess name. The Princess (and the Mini, which BL also turned into a marque in its own right) was sold across the Austin-Morris dealership network, making any distinction between the two even more vague to many customers. Critically, the new models that had been introduced by BLMC failed to sell in high enough quantities outside of the home market, despite the UK now being a part of the European Economic Community – with the Allegro and Princess, in particular, having been tailored for European tastes. However, both these vehicles were saloons when the trend in Europe was moving towards family-sized hatchbacks, typified by the Volkswagen Golf in 1974 and the Simca 1307 (Chrysler Alpine) in 1975.

The company also wasted many of its scant funds on concepts, like the Rover P8 or P9, that would never be produced to earn money for the company.

These internal issues, which were never satisfactorily solved, combined with serious industrial relations problems with trade unions, the 1973 oil crisis, the three-day week, high inflation and ineffectual management meant that BL became an unmanageable and financially crippled behemoth. &quot;Following a disastrous couple of years in the marketplace, by the end of 1974 BLMC was on the brink of bankruptcy. Its financial backers – the City banks – had become very nervous about its future, and persuaded Lord Stokes to approach Tony Benn for financial assistance.&quot;

===1975–1982: Collapse, the Ryder Report and the Edwardes era===

Sir Don Ryder was asked to undertake an enquiry into the position of the company, and his report was presented to the government in April 1975. Following Ryder&#x27;s recommendations, the organisation was drastically restructured and the Labour Government created a new holding company, British Leyland Limited (BL), of which it was the major shareholder, effectively nationalising the company. Between 1975 and 1980, these shares were vested in the National Enterprise Board which had responsibility for managing this investment. The original seven divisions of the company were now reorganised into four:
*&quot;Leyland Cars&quot; – the largest car manufacturer in the UK, employing some 128,000 people at 36 locations, and with a production capacity of one million vehicles per year. 
*&quot;Leyland Truck and Bus&quot; – the largest commercial and passenger vehicle manufacturer in the UK, employing 31,000 people at 12 locations, producing 38,000 trucks, 8,000 buses (including a joint venture with the National Bus Company), and 19,000 tractors per year. The tractors were based on the Nuffield designs, but built in a plant in Bathgate, Scotland.
*&quot;Leyland Special Products&quot; – the miscellaneous collection of other acquired businesses, itself structured into five sub-divisions:
**Construction equipment – Aveling &amp; Porter, Aveling-Marshall, Barfords of Belton and Goodwin-Barsby
**Refrigeration – Prestcold
**Materials handling – Coventry Climax (incorporating Climax Trucks, Climax Conveyancer and Climax Shawloader)
**Military vehicles – Alvis and Self-Changing Gears
**Print – Nuffield Press (which printed the company&#x27;s publications) and Lyne &amp; Son
*&quot;Leyland International&quot; – responsible for the export of cars, trucks and buses, and responsible for manufacturing plants in Africa, India and Australia, employing 18,000 people.

There was positive news for BL at the end of 1976 when its new Rover SD1 executive car was voted European Car of the Year, having gained plaudits for its innovative design. The SD1 was actually the first step that British Leyland took towards rationalising its passenger car ranges, as it replaced two cars competing in the same sector, the Rover P6 and Triumph 2000. More positive news for the company came at the end of 1976 with the approval by Industry Minister Eric Varley of a £140,000,000 investment of public money in refitting the Longbridge plant for production of the company&#x27;s &quot;ADO88&quot; (Mini replacement), due for launch in 1979. However, poor results from customer clinics of the ADO88, coupled with the UK success of the Ford Fiesta, launched in 1976, forced a snap redesign of ADO88 which evolved into the &quot;LC8&quot; project – eventually launched as the Austin Mini Metro in 1980.

In 1977, Michael Edwardes was appointed chief executive by the NEB. Edwardes embarked on a massive restructuring of the beleaguered conglomerate, selling off many of its non-core businesses such as Prestcold and Coventry Climax. Edwardes also took on the militant unions head-on, culminating in the dismissal of chief shop steward Derek Robinson in 1979, who had been seen as the perpetrator of much of the strikes and industrial unrest that had crippled the company throughout the decade. Edwardes quickly reversed the Ryder Report&#x27;s policy of giving prominence to the &quot;Leyland&quot; brand, and returned focus back to the individual brands. Leyland Cars was thus renamed &quot;BL Cars Ltd&quot;, consisting of two main divisions; &quot;Austin Morris&quot; (the volume car business) and &quot;Jaguar Rover Triumph&quot; (JRT) (the specialist or upmarket division). Austin Morris included MG. Land Rover and Range Rover were later separated from JRT to form the Land Rover Group. JRT later split up into Rover-Triumph and Jaguar Car Holdings (which included Daimler). At the same time the public use of the &quot;British Leyland&quot; name ceased, being abbreviated simply to &quot;BL&quot;, whilst the company&#x27;s &quot;hurricane&quot; logo was redesigned with the central &quot;L&quot; removed. The Austin-Morris division was given its own unique brand identity with the introduction of the blue and green &quot;chevron&quot; logo, which was later expanded in use when the car manufacturing operations were further consolidated into the Austin Rover Group in the 1980s.

In 1978, the company was the subject of an important legal development concerning corporate civil liability. In the case of &quot;Walton v British Leyland&quot;, the court held Leyland liable for negligence owing to a design defect in the wheel bearings of their new model of the Allegro. The company were aware of the issue but had decided against a recall. They were held liable for damages as they had failed to take reasonable care, because the costs of the recall were deemed in proportion with the potential risks of injury.

====BLCV====

In 1978, the company formed a new group for its commercial vehicle interests, BL Commercial Vehicles (BLCV) under managing director David Abell. The following companies moved under this new umbrella:
*Leyland Vehicles Limited (trucks, tractors and buses)
*Alvis (military vehicles)
*Coventry Climax (fork lift trucks and specialist engines)
*Self-Changing Gears (heavy-duty transmissions)

BLCV and the Land Rover Group later merged to become &quot;Land Rover Leyland&quot;.

In December 1978, British Leyland Limited was renamed BL Limited and its subsidiary, which acted as a holding company for all the other companies within the group. The British Leyland Motor Corporation Limited was renamed BLMC Limited at the same time.

BL&#x27;s fortunes took another much-awaited rise in October 1980 with the launch of the Austin Metro (initially named the Mini Metro), a three-door hatchback that gave buyers a more modern and practical alternative to the iconic but ageing Mini. This went on to be one of the most popular cars in Britain in the 1980s. Towards the final stages of the Metro&#x27;s development, BL entered into an alliance with Honda to provide a new mid-range model which would replace the ageing Triumph Dolomite, but would more crucially act as a stop-gap until the Austin Maestro and Montego were ready for launch. This car would emerge as the Triumph Acclaim in 1981, and would be the first of a long line of collaborative models jointly developed between BL and Honda. At the same time, Leyland Trucks introduced the Landtrain, the first in a series of vehicles developed specifically for export markets.

A rationalisation of the model ranges also took place around this time. In 1980, British Leyland was still producing three cars in the large family car sector—the Princess 2, Austin Maxi and Morris Marina. The Marina was succeeded by the Morris Ital in July 1980 following a superficial facelift, and a year later the Princess 2 received a major upgrade to become the Austin Ambassador, meaning that the 1982 range had just two competitors in this sector. In April 1984, these cars were discontinued to make way for a single all-new model, the Austin Montego. 

The Acclaim was replaced in that same year by another Honda-based product, the Rover 200-series.

The MG factory at Abingdon and Triumph factory at Canley were both closed in 1980.

===1982–1986: Edwardes steps down, Jaguar divested, Austin Rover Group===

By the end of Michael Edwardes&#x27; tenure as chairman of BL plc in 1982, the company had been restructured into two distinct parts – the Cars Division (which consisted of Austin-Morris, Rover and Jaguar, and was led by Ray Horrocks) and the Commercial Vehicle Division (which consisted of Land Rover, Leyland Trucks, Leyland Buses and Freight Rover) – whose chief executive was David Andrews. The holding company BL plc was now chaired by Austin Bide in a non-executive capacity. Around this time, the &quot;BL Cars Ltd&quot; division renamed itself Austin Rover, shortly before the launch of the Austin Maestro and Ray Horrocks was replaced by Harold Musgrove as its chairman and chief executive. The emergence of the Austin Rover brand effectively put an end to the separate &quot;Austin-Morris&quot; and &quot;Jaguar-Rover-Triumph&quot; divisions, since by this time, Jaguar now resided in a separate company called Jaguar Car Holdings and was now led by Sir John Egan, and this was later de-merged from BL completely and privatised in 1984. That same year, with both the Morris Ital and the Triumph Acclaim being discontinued, their respective brands were effectively shelved, leaving only the Austin and Rover marques, whilst Land Rover moved into the &quot;Freight Rover Group&quot; alongside the light trucks division. After the divestment of Unipart and the van, truck and bus divisions in 1987 (see below), leaving just two subsidiaries – Austin Rover (volume cars) and Land Rover (SUVs) this essentially remained the basic structure of BL and subsequently the Rover Group until the 2000 break-up.

===Renaming to Rover Group and Land Rover&#x27;s eventual sale to Ford===
In 1986, Graham Day took the helm as chairman and CEO and the third joint Rover-Honda vehicle – the Rover 800-series – was launched which replaced the ten-year-old Rover SD1. Around the same time, BL changed its name to Rover Group and in 1987 the &quot;Trucks Division – Leyland Vehicles&quot; merged with the Dutch DAF company to form DAF NV, trading as Leyland DAF in the UK and as &quot;DAF&quot; in the Netherlands. In 1987, the bus business was spun off into a new company called Leyland Bus. This was the result of a management buyout who decided to sell the company to the Bus &amp; Truck division of Volvo in 1988. That same year, the UK Government controversially tried to privatise and sell-off Land Rover, however this plan was later abandoned. The Austin name was dropped from the Metro, Maestro and Montego by 1988, signalling the end for the historic Austin marque, in a push to focus on the more prestigious (and potentially more profitable) Rover badge. In 1988, the business was sold by the UK Government to British Aerospace (BAe), and shortly afterwards shortened its name to just Rover Group. It subsequently sold the business to BMW, who, after years of investment that ultimately resulted in huge losses, decided to break up the Rover Group, and only retain the Cowley operations and the rights to manufacture the new MINI family of vehicles.

Land Rover was divested to Ford, who integrated it with its Premier Automotive Group (of which Jaguar was already a part, therefore reuniting the two former BL stablemates), whilst the remains of the volume car business, including the massive Longbridge complex, became the newly independent MG Rover, which collapsed in 2005. 

However, after suffering severe financial problems and teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, Ford decided to dissolve its Premier Automotive Group, and sold off most of its brands, with Jaguar and Land Rover being sold to the Indian automaker Tata Motors by the end of 2008. Ultimately only MINI, Jaguar Land Rover and Leyland Trucks would be the surviving automotive manufacturing operations of British Leyland to the present day.
Many of the brands were divested over time and continue to exist on the books of several companies to this day.

In total, the British Government had invested over £3 billion (not adjusted for inflation) attempting to rescue British Leyland from bankruptcy.

===Ashok Leyland===
Until the 1980s, the Leyland name and logo were seen as a recognised and respected marque across India, the wider subcontinent and parts of Africa in the form of Ashok Leyland, a company formed from the partnership of the Ashok group and British Leyland. However, now the company has been largely Indian in its ownership for over three decades. Now a part of the giant Hinduja Group, Ashok Leyland manufactures buses, trucks, defence vehicles and engines. The company is a leader in the heavy transportation sector within India and has an aggressive expansionary policy. 

In 1987, the UK-based Hinduja Group bought the India-based Ashok Leyland company. Today, Ashok-Leyland is pursuing a joint venture with Nissan and through its acquisition of the Czech truck maker, Avia, is entering the European truck market directly. With its purchase, in 2010, of a 25% stake in UK-based bus manufacturer Optare, Ashok Leyland has taken a step closer to reconnecting with its British heritage, as Optare is a direct descendant of Leyland&#x27;s UK bus-making division.

During the time of British Leyland&#x27;s transition into Austin Rover during the 1980s, a version of the Rover SD1 was licence built in India as the Standard 2000 from 1985 to 1988, briefly reviving the Standard brand which had been axed in 1968.

British Leyland also provided the technical know-how and the rights to their Leyland 28 BHP tractor for Auto Tractors Limited, a tractor plant in Pratapgarh, Uttar Pradesh. Established in 1981 with state support, ATL only managed to build 2,380 tractors by the time the project was ended in 1990 – less than the planned production for the first two years. The project ended up being taken over by Sipani, who kept producing tractor engines and also a small number of tractors with some modest success.

==Timelines==
===Notes for the timeline table===
*The car brands of BSA were divested, BSA was not merged into Jaguar.
*Mini was not originally a marque in its own right. See Mini and Mini (marque) for more detail.
*The BMC trademark is registered (1564704, E1118348) to MG Rover Group Ltd in the UK. BMC is also the name of a commercial vehicle manufacturer in Turkey, formerly the Turkish subsidiary of the British Motor Corporation. It is believed that Nanjing Automotive may have purchased this from MG Rover, however, the brand has not been reassigned as of 17 July 2006.
*The Wolseley trademark is registered (UK 1490228) to MG Rover Group Ltd for automobiles only. It is believed that Nanjing Automotive may have purchased this from MG Rover, however, the brand has not been reassigned as of July 2006 to a different company. The UK building materials supplier Wolseley plc owns the rights to the Wolseley name for all other purposes. Wolseley plc is a descendant of the original Wolseley company.
*The Vanden Plas trademark is owned by Ford (through Jaguar) for use within the US and Canada, and as (UK 1133528, E2654481) to MG Rover Group Ltd for use in the rest of the world. It is believed that Nanjing Automotive may have purchased this from MG Rover, however, the trademark has not been recorded as reassigned as of 17 July 2006. This is why Jaguar XJ Vanden Plas models are branded as Daimlers in Britain. The last Rover to use the Vanden Plas name was the Rover 75 Vanden Plas, a long wheelbase limousine model.
*The Rover trademark was owned by BMW and was only licensed to MG Rover Group Ltd. BMW sold the brand to Ford in September 2006.
*Alvis was purchased from British Leyland by United Scientific Holdings in 1981, in 2002 Alvis merged with part of Vickers Defence Systems to form Alvis Vickers which was purchased by BAE Systems in 2004. BAE Systems did not acquire Alvis through their ownership of the Rover Group in the early 1990s. Production of Alvis branded cars ceased in 1967. The trademark is owned by Alvis Vehicles Ltd.
*The use of the Triumph name as a trademark for vehicles is shared between BMW and Triumph Motorcycles. The former for automobiles and the latter for motorcycles. The motorcycle and car business separated in the 1930s.

===Inherited marques===
The car marques inherited by the company are as follows.

The dates given are those of the first car of each marque, but these are often debatable as each car may be several years in development.

===Competing models===
In some cases, British Leyland continued to produce competing models from the merged companies at different sites for many years. However, any benefits from the broader number of models were far outweighed by higher development costs and greatly reduced economies of scale.

Potential benefits associated with rationalising parts usage were lost, as for example, the company made two completely different 1.3-litre engines (BMC A series and the Triumph 1.3-litre), two different 1.5-litre engines (BMC E series and Triumph), four different 2-litre engines (4-cylinder O series, 4-cylinder Triumph Dolomite, 4-cylinder Rover and 6-cylinder Triumph) and two completely different V8 engines (Triumph OHC 3-litre V8 and Rover 3.5-litre V8).

Examples of competing cars were:

* Morris Minor and Austin A40/Austin 1100
* Austin 1300 and Triumph Herald/Triumph Toledo
* Morris Marina, Austin Allegro, and Triumph Dolomite
* Triumph 2000, Rover 2000, and Princess (car)
* Triumph Spitfire, MG Midget and Austin-Healey Sprite
* Triumph TR6/Triumph TR7 and MG MGC
* Rover 3500 and Jaguar XJ6

===Badge-engineered models===
In contrast to the continued development of competing models, British Leyland continued the practice of badge engineering of models which had started under BMC; selling essentially the same vehicle under two (or more) different marques.

* Riley One-Point-Five/Wolseley 1500
* MG Magnette ZA/ZB/Wolseley 4/44
* MG Magnette ZB/Wolseley 15/50
* Morris Oxford MO/Wolseley 4/50

<doc id="343067" wikidata="Q2302368" url="?curid=343067" title="Mary Wilson (singer)">
<text>Mary Wilson (March 6, 1944 – February 8, 2021) was an American singer. She gained worldwide recognition as a founding member of the Supremes, the most successful Motown act of the 1960s and the best-charting female group in U.S. chart history, as well as one of the best-selling girl groups of all-time. The trio reached number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 with 12 of their singles, ten of which feature Wilson on backing vocals.

Wilson remained with the group following the departures of the other three original members: Barbara Martin (in 1962), Florence Ballard (in 1967), and Diana Ross (in 1970), though the subsequent group disbanded following Wilson&#x27;s own departure in 1977. Wilson later became a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-selling author in 1986 with the release of her first autobiography, &quot;&quot;, which set records for sales in its genre, and later for the autobiography &quot;Supreme Faith: Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot;.

Continuing a successful career as a concert performer in Las Vegas, Wilson also worked in activism, fighting to pass Truth in Music Advertising bills and donating to various charities. Wilson was inducted along with Ross and Ballard (as members of the Supremes) into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.

==Early life==
Mary Wilson was born March 6, 1944, to Sam, a butcher, and Johnnie Mae Wilson in Greenville, Mississippi. She was the eldest of three children including a brother, Roosevelt, and a sister, Cathy. The Wilsons moved to Chicago, part of the Great Migration in which her father joined many African Americans seeking work in the North, but at age three, Mary Wilson was taken in by her aunt Ivory &quot;I.V.&quot; and uncle John L. Pippin in Detroit. Her parents eventually separated and Wilson&#x27;s mother and siblings later joined them in Detroit, though by then Wilson had come to believe I.V. was her real mother. Wilson and her family had settled in the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects, a housing project in Detroit where Wilson first met Florence Ballard. The duo became friends while singing in their school&#x27;s talent show. In 1959, Ballard asked Wilson to audition for Milton Jenkins, who was forming a sister group to his male vocal trio, the Primes (two members of which were later in The Temptations). Wilson was soon accepted into the group known as The Primettes, with Diana Ross and Betty McGlown, who lived in the same housing project with Wilson and Ballard. In this period, Wilson also met Aretha, Erma and Carolyn Franklin, daughters of the pastor at her local Baptist church.

Wilson graduated from Detroit&#x27;s Northeastern High School in January 1962.

==Career==
===The Supremes: 1959–1977===
In 1960, the Primettes signed a contract with Lu Pine Records, issuing two singles from which Wilson sang lead vocals on &quot;Pretty Baby&quot;. Shortly after, McGlown left to get married and was replaced by Barbara Martin. During that year, they kept pursuing a Motown contract and agreed to do anything that was required, including adding handclaps and vocal backgrounds. By the end of the year, Berry Gordy agreed to have the group record songs in the studio. In January 1961, Gordy relented and agreed to sign the girls to his label on the condition they change their name. Motown lyricist Janie Bradford approached Ballard with a list of names to choose from before Ballard chose &quot;Supremes&quot;. Eventually, Gordy agreed to sign them under that name on January 15, 1961.

The group struggled in their early years in comparison to other Motown acts, garnering the nickname &quot;no-hit Supremes&quot; as a result. One track, &quot;Buttered Popcorn&quot;, led by Ballard, was a regional hit, but still failed to chart. Before the release of their 1962 debut album, &quot;Meet The Supremes&quot;, Martin had become pregnant and subsequently left the group, leaving the Supremes as a trio.

In December 1963, the single &quot;When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes&quot; peaked at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Following the single&#x27;s success, Gordy assigned Ross as the group&#x27;s lead singer. In the spring of 1964, the Supremes released &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot;, which became their first number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, paving the way for ten number-one hits recorded by Ross, Ballard, and Wilson between 1964 and 1967.

By 1965, the group had become international stars, appearing regularly on television programs such as &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;, and, most notably &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, on which they made 17 appearances. As early as 1966, Ballard&#x27;s chronic alcoholism led to her missing press conferences and recording sessions. To serve as a stand-in for Ballard, Gordy selected Cindy Birdsong, a member of Patti LaBelle and the Blue Belles. In July 1967, following a contentious performance at the Flamingo, Ballard was removed from the Supremes and replaced with Birdsong. Simultaneously, Gordy renamed the group &quot;Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes&quot;, beginning with the single &quot;Reflections&quot;. 
In 1968, Wilson sung lead on &quot;The Ballad of Davy Crockett&quot;, a cover the group recorded for their album &quot;Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes Sing Disney Classics&quot; in 1968. The album was shelved and never released. However, the song still appeared on the 1987 compilation &quot;The Never-Before-Released Masters&quot;. In 1969, Wilson sang the duet &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot; (a Frankie Valli cover) with Eddie Kendricks for the album &quot;Together&quot;, in preparation for Ross&#x27; departure from the Supremes with many assuming she would step up and eventually take the lead in the group.

The new lineup continued to record hit singles, although several stalled outside the top 20 chart range. Ross left the group in January 1970, and at her farewell performance Jean Terrell was introduced as the replacement for Ross. According to Wilson, Gordy told Wilson that he thought of having Syreeta Wright join the group in a last-minute change, after Terrell had already been introduced as lead singer, to which Wilson refused. From there, Gordy relinquished creative control of the group over to Wilson. With Terrell, the group reverted back to the name &quot;the Supremes;&quot; known unofficially at first as &quot;the New Supremes&quot;, and in later years informally called &quot;The &#x27;70s Supremes&quot;. The Wilson-Birdsong-Terrell lineup recorded seven top-40 hit singles in a three-year period, including &quot;River Deep/Mountain High&quot; (with the Four Tops), &quot;Up the Ladder to the Roof&quot;, &quot;Stoned Love&quot;, &quot;Nathan Jones&quot;, and &quot;Floy Joy&quot;. Unlike the latter years with Ross, the single &quot;Automatically Sunshine&quot; succeeded in reaching the top 20 charts.
In 1972, Wilson took the lead on &quot;I Keep It Hid&quot;, from &quot;The Supremes Produced and Arranged by Jimmy Webb&quot;. That same year, Cindy Birdsong left the group following marriage and pregnancy and was replaced by Lynda Laurence (then Tucker). The group&#x27;s popularity and place on record charts dropped significantly. For the first time in a decade, two singles in a row failed to break into the top 40, including the Stevie Wonder penned-and-produced &quot;Bad Weather&quot;. Discouraged, Jean Terrell and Lynda Laurence both departed in late 1973. Scherrie Payne was recruited from a group called The Glass House, and Cindy Birdsong returned. Beginning with this lineup change, Wilson began doing almost half of the group&#x27;s lead vocal duties, as she was considered the group&#x27;s main attraction and reason for continuing.

In 1975, Wilson sang lead on the Top 10 disco hit &quot;Early Morning Love&quot;, which was released as a single in the United Kingdom only from the album, &quot;The Supremes&quot;. In 1976, the group scored its final Top 40 hit single with &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Let My Heart Do the Walking&quot;, written and produced by Brian and Eddie Holland and included on the album &quot;High Energy&quot;. Birdsong again departed, just before the album&#x27;s release, and was replaced by the group&#x27;s final official member, Susaye Greene, whose voice was dubbed over two songs. &quot;High Energy&quot; was well-received, but the follow-up album &quot;Mary, Scherrie &amp; Susaye&quot;, released in 1977, would be their last. During a meeting with Motown, Wilson&#x27;s husband Pedro Ferrer had notified Motown that Wilson would leave the Supremes to embark on a solo career. On June 12, 1977, Wilson gave her farewell performance with the Supremes at London&#x27;s Drury Lane Theatre. Meanwhile, Payne and Greene had planned to continue as the Supremes, but a replacement for Wilson proved to be unsuccessful, in which the Supremes officially disbanded.

===Solo career: 1977–2021===
In July 1977, just one month following her farewell performance with the Supremes, Wilson began a touring &quot;Supremes&quot; show with two background singers as the &quot;Mary Wilson of The Supremes&quot; show. The show was the result of Motown&#x27;s allowance of the group to go into hiatus despite the fact that there were still several uncancelled international tour dates to complete. Mary therefore hired former Supreme, Cindy Birdsong and Debbie Sharpe to complete a summer tour of South America to fulfill contracts so venues would not sue. The three-week tour began in Caracas, Venezuela, and was composed of mostly small clubs. Despite the company&#x27;s displeasure and the fact that it owned the rights/distribution rights to the name &quot;Supremes&quot;, Motown never cancelled the tour. Later that year, Wilson hired Karen Jackson and Kaaren Ragland to tour with as background singers. She and Cindy rehearsed them for a year end&#x27;s tour of Europe, that was composed of dates at officers&#x27; clubs and swank discos.

After an out-of-court settlement, Wilson signed with Motown for solo work, releasing a disco-heavy self-titled album in August 1979. A single from the album, &quot;Red Hot&quot;, peaked at number 90 on the pop charts. Midway through production of a second solo album in 1980, Motown dropped her from their roster. Throughout the mid-1980s, Wilson focused on performances in musical theater productions, including &quot;Beehive&quot;, &quot;Dancing in the Streets&quot;, and &quot;Supreme Soul&quot;.

In 1983, Wilson appeared on the &quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot; television special. Early in the program, Wilson made a brief tribute to Florence Ballard, and former label mate Paul Williams of the Temptations. Later, she joined Diana Ross and Cindy Birdsong for a highly anticipated Supremes reunion. Wilson found major success once more with her memoir: &quot;Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme&quot; in 1986. The book remained on the national best-seller list for months and established a sales record for the genre. The book focused on the early career of the Supremes and its success during the 1960s. Four years later, in 1990, Wilson released her second memoir: &quot;Supreme Faith: Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot;, also a best seller, which focused on the Supremes in the 1970s. In between this period, Wilson became a frequent guest on several television programs and talk shows and began regularly performing in Las Vegas casinos and resorts. Wilson then recorded a cover version of &quot;Ooh Child&quot; for the Motorcity label in 1990. A year later, she signed with CEO Records and released the album, &quot;Walk the Line&quot;, in 1992. The label filed for bankruptcy the day after its national release. Wilson maintained that she was deceived about the financial status of the label. The available copies of the album quickly sold out, however, and Wilson continued her success as a concert performer.

Earlier in 1974, Wilson had her contract with Motown re-negotiated to allow her 50% ownership of the name &quot;Supremes&quot;. During the 1990s, Wilson filed suit against several former members of the Supremes, who had formed spin-off groups, for improper usage of the Supremes&#x27; name. In September 1997, the court sided with the defendant, claiming Motown Records owned the full rights to the group&#x27;s name, and allowed for the spin-off groups to continue performing. Wilson then appealed the decision to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which upheld the prior ruling. This prompted Wilson to take a high-profile role in lobbying for &quot;Truth in Music Advertising&quot; legislation, which prohibits usage of musical acts names, unless an original member of the group is in the act or the group is properly licensed by the last person to hold right of title to the name. Her efforts succeeded in more than 28 U.S. states. In 1995, Wilson released a song, &quot;.U&quot;, for Contract Recording Company. A year later, Wilson released the song, &quot;Turn Around&quot; for Da Bridge Records.

In late 1999, a proposal for a Supremes reunion tour was negotiated by Ross and TNA/SFX Productions (now Live Nation Entertainment). According to Wilson, Ross had contacted her that December, long after she had already heard of plans for a reunion tour. Wilson was initially offered $2 million, while Birdsong was reported to have been offered less than $1 million. Wilson disagreed, and a counteroffer of $3 million was made. By March 2000, with salary negotiations still underway, Wilson stated a deal had been accepted between her and Birdsong, but it was rejected by Ross. TNA/SFX then ceased negotiations with Wilson and Birdsong. Instead, the tour, Return to Love, went forward with former Supremes Scherrie Payne and Lynda Lawrence, beginning in Philadelphia on June 14. The opening concert had drawn 10,000 spectators and grossed over $629,000. By July 2000, the tour was reportedly performing below expectations, and was subsequently canceled after 13 concerts. Ross issued a statement that she was &quot;severely disappointed&quot; that SFX had decided to cancel the tour.

That year, Wilson released an updated version of her autobiographies as a single combined book. That same year, an album, &quot;I Am Changing&quot;, was released by Mary Wilson Enterprises, produced through her and her then-management, Duryea Entertainment.

In 2001, Wilson starred in the national tour of &quot;Leader of the Pack – The Ellie Greenwich Story&quot;. A year later, Wilson was appointed by Secretary of State Colin Powell as a &quot;culture-connect ambassador&quot; for the U.S. State Department, appearing at international events arranged by that agency. In 2004, Wilson joined Cindy Birdsong and Kelly Rowland (of Destiny&#x27;s Child) to perform a medley of Supreme hits for the &quot;Motown 45&quot; anniversary television special. In 2006, a live concert DVD, &quot;Live at the Sands&quot;, was released. Four years later, another DVD, &quot;Mary Wilson: Live from San Francisco... Up Close&quot;, was released. During this period, Wilson became a musical activist, having been part of the Truth in Music Bill, a law proposed to stop impostor groups performing under the names of the 1950s and 1960s rock and roll groups, including Motown groups The Marvelettes and The Supremes. The law was passed in 27 states. Wilson also toured and lectured internationally, as well as across the United States, speaking to multiple groups worldwide. Her lecture series, &quot;Dare to Dream&quot;, focuses on reaching goals and triumph over adversity. Wilson&#x27;s charity work included Children Incorporated, the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure, the American Cancer Society, St. Jude&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Research Hospital, the Easter Seals Foundation, UNICEF, The NAACP, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the All-Star Network, and Figure Skaters of Harlem, a youth organization devoted to helping children towards entering the Olympics. Most recently, Wilson became the Mine Action spokesperson for the Humpty Dumpty Institute.
In April 2008, Wilson made a special appearance on &quot;20/20&quot; to participate in a social experiment involving pedestrians reacting to a young woman singing &quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot; with intentional amateurishness. Wilson approached the woman and gave her constructive criticism toward her style, in contrast to the pedestrians whose reactions were positive, yet dishonest. On March 5, 2009, she made a special appearance on &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;, which ended in a special performance with her, O&#x27;Grady, and Graham Norton. Wilson created the &quot;Mary Wilson/Supremes Gown Collection&quot;, and had the collection tour in an exhibition of the Supremes&#x27; stage wear. The collection has been on exhibit at the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio and on May 12, 2008, commenced its UK tour, starting at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. More than 50 sets of gowns are shown in rotation, starting with early formal wear from the early 1960s, and including famous gowns worn on television specials and nightclub appearances by the group in the 1960s and 1970s.

Wilson released two singles on iTunes, &quot;Life&#x27;s Been Good To Me&quot; and &quot;Darling Mother (Johnnie Mae)&quot;, in 2011 and 2013, respectively. In 2015, Wilson released a new single, &quot;Time To Move On&quot;, produced by Sweet Feet Music; the song reached the Top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance charts history, peaking at No. 17 as of December 26. At 36 years and seven weeks, Mary Wilson holds the record for the longest gap between hits in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart as &quot;Red Hot&quot; debuted on October 6, 1979 and &quot;Time To Move On&quot; debuted on November 21, 2015.

In 2016, an Indiegogo campaign was launched to help raise $35,000 to fund a gay-themed romantic comedy movie, &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Eat the Pansies&quot;. The cast includes actor/writer Ronnie Kerr, Andrew Lauer, singer/actor Tom Goss, and Wilson.

On August 15, 2019, Wilson published her fourth book, &quot;Supreme Glamour&quot; with co-author Mark Bego, dedicated to the history of the Supremes and their fashion with a detailed section dedicated to the Supremes gowns in her collection. That same month, she was announced as one of the celebrities who would compete on season 28 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars.&quot; Wilson and her professional partner Brandon Armstrong were the first couple to be eliminated from the competition on September 23, 2019.

====Posthumous releases====

Mary Wilson&#x27;s single &quot;Why Can&#x27;t We All Get Along&quot; was released posthumously on March 5, 2021. The song was featured on a 2021 reissue of Wilson&#x27;s 1979 solo debut entitled, &quot;Mary Wilson: Expanded Edition&quot;.

Another posthumous project, &quot;Mary Wilson: Red Hot Eric Kupper Remix EP&quot; was released September 3, 2021. The EP featured three new different dance versions of Wilson&#x27;s 1979 single &quot;Red Hot&quot; produced by Kupper.

On January 7, 2022, a posthumous compilation album entitled, &quot;Mary Wilson: The Motown Anthology&quot;, was released physically and released digitally to streaming platforms March 4, 2022.

On March 3, 2023, a posthumous single called, &quot;Soul Defender&quot;, which is previously unreleased was released digitally by Universal. The song was written by Billie Ray Martin and produced by Paul Brewer of Sweet Feet Music. Three versions of the track was available: a radio edit, an extended dance mix, and an instrumental version of the radio edit.

==Personal life and death==
Throughout her career Wilson was romantically linked to Flip Wilson, Steve McQueen, and David Frost among others. Wilson also had a short affair with Tom Jones, and was briefly engaged to Duke Fakir of the Four Tops in the mid-1960s.

Wilson married Dominican businessman Pedro Ferrer, whom she had chosen as The Supremes&#x27; manager, in Las Vegas on May 11, 1974. They had three children: daughter Turkessa (b. 1975) and sons Pedro Antonio Jr. (b. 1977) and Rafael (1979–1994). Wilson and Ferrer divorced in 1981. She was also the adoptive mother of her cousin, Willie. In January 1994, Wilson and her 14-year-old son Rafael were involved in an accident on Interstate 15 between Los Angeles and Las Vegas when their Jeep Cherokee veered off the highway and overturned. Wilson sustained moderate injuries; Rafael&#x27;s injuries were fatal.

On February 8, 2021, Wilson died in her sleep from hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at her home in Henderson, Nevada, a suburb of Las Vegas, at the age of 76. Two days before her death, she had announced on YouTube that she was planning to release new solo material with Universal Music Group, and hoped it would come out before March 6, her 77th birthday.

Motown founder Berry Gordy said he was &quot;extremely shocked and saddened&quot; by the news of her death and said Wilson was &quot;quite a star in her own right and over the years continued to work hard to boost the legacy of the Supremes.&quot; Diana Ross reflected on Wilson&#x27;s death, posting on Twitter: &quot;I am reminded that each day is a gift. I have so many wonderful memories of our time together. &#x27;The Supremes&#x27; will live on in our hearts.&quot; Ross would later say to &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, &quot;I remember Mary&#x27;s joy and love during happier times and our love and years together. I recall &#x27;the good old days&#x27; with a smile in my heart and a song in my heart during these changing times.&quot;

At the time of her death Wilson had 10 grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.

Wilson was interred next to her son Rafael on March 16, 2021, at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

==Honors==
In 2001, Wilson earned a degree from New York University&#x27;s School of Continuing and Professional Studies.

Wilson was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Paine College in Augusta, Georgia.

In 2020, Wilson received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Newspaper Publishers Association. Wilson was also, along with The Supremes, inducted into National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame class of 2013. Wilson also served as the master of ceremonies for the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame from 2016 to 2019 and served as a board member.

==Legacy==
The character of Lorrell Robinson in both the play and film versions of &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; was inspired by Wilson.

&quot;&quot; is a Broadway musical that launched on April 14, 2013. It is the story of Berry Gordy&#x27;s creation of Motown Records. Wilson was portrayed by Ariana DeBose in 2013.

As a member of the Supremes, her songs &quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; are among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. The Ross-Wilson-Ballard lineup was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 (), received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1994, and entered into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1998. Wilson was the only Supreme present for all three ceremonies. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the group at number 96 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.

As a member of The Supremes, Wilson was named as one of eight recipients to receive a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards in 2023.

<text>Eleanor Farjeon (13 February 1881 – 5 June 1965) was an English author of children&#x27;s stories and plays, poetry, biography, history and satire. 

Several of her works had illustrations by Edward Ardizzone. Some of her correspondence has also been published. She won many literary awards and the Eleanor Farjeon Award for children&#x27;s literature is presented annually in her memory by the Children&#x27;s Book Circle, a society of publishers. She was the sister of thriller writer Joseph Jefferson Farjeon.

==Biography==

N.B.: The biographies listed under the &quot;Bibliography&quot; subhead below do not eliminate the need for specific citations within the article. 

Eleanor Farjeon was born on 13 February 1881. The daughter of Benjamin Farjeon and Maggie (Jefferson) Farjeon, Eleanor came from a literary family; her two younger brothers, Joseph and Herbert Farjeon, were writers, while the eldest, Harry Farjeon, was a composer. Her father was Jewish.

Farjeon, known to the family as &quot;Nellie&quot;, was a small, timid child, who had poor eyesight and suffered from ill-health throughout her childhood. She was educated at home, spending much of her time in the attic, surrounded by books. Her father encouraged her writing from the age of five. She describes her family and her childhood in the autobiographical &quot;A Nursery in the Nineties&quot; (1935).

She and her elder brother Harry were especially close. Beginning when Farjeon was five, they began a sustained imaginative game in which they became various characters from theatrical plays and literature. This game, called T.A.R. after the initials of two of the original characters, lasted into their mid-twenties. Farjeon credited this game with giving her &quot;the flow of ease which makes writing a delight&quot;.

Although she lived much of her life among the literary and theatrical circles of London, much of Farjeon&#x27;s inspiration came from her childhood and from family holidays. A holiday in France in 1907 was to inspire her to create a story of a troubadour, later refashioned as the wandering minstrel of her most famous book, &quot;Martin Pippin in the Apple Orchard&quot;. Among her earliest publications is a volume of poems called &quot;Pan Worship&quot;, published in 1908, and &quot;Nursery Rhymes of London Town&quot; from 1916. During World War I, the family moved to Sussex where the landscape, villages and local traditions were to have a profound effect upon her later writing. It was in Sussex that the Martin Pippin stories were eventually to be located.

At eighteen, Farjeon wrote the libretto for an operetta, &quot;Floretta&quot;, to music by her brother Harry, who later became a composer and teacher of music. She also collaborated with her youngest brother, Herbert, Shakespearian scholar and dramatic critic. Their productions include &quot;Kings and Queens&quot; (1932), &quot;The Two Bouquets&quot; (1938), &quot;An Elephant in Arcady&quot; (1939), and &quot;The Glass Slipper&quot; (1944).

Farjeon had a wide range of friends with great literary talent including D. H. Lawrence, Walter de la Mare, Robert Frost and Elizabeth Myers. For several years she had a close friendship with the poet Edward Thomas and his wife. After Thomas&#x27;s death in April 1917 during the Battle of Arras, she remained close to his wife, Helen. She later published much of their correspondence, and gave a definitive account of their relationship in &quot;Edward Thomas: The Last Four Years&quot; (1958).

After World War I Farjeon earned a living as a poet, journalist and broadcaster. Often published under a pseudonym, Farjeon&#x27;s poems appeared in &quot;The Herald&quot; (Tomfool), &quot;Punch&quot;, &quot;Time and Tide&quot; (Chimaera), &quot;The New Leader&quot; (Merry Andrew), &quot;Reynolds News&quot; (Tomfool), and a number of other periodicals. Her topical work for &quot;The Herald&quot;, &quot;Reynolds News&quot; and &quot;New Leader&quot; was perhaps the most accomplished of any socialist poet of the 1920s and 30s.

Farjeon never married, but had a thirty-year friendship with George Earle, an English teacher. After Earle&#x27;s death in 1949, she had a long friendship with the actor Denys Blakelock, who wrote of it in the book &quot;Eleanor, Portrait of a Farjeon&quot; (1966).

During the 1950s, she received three major literary awards. Both the 1955 Carnegie Medal for British children&#x27;s books and the inaugural Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1956 cited &quot;The Little Bookroom&quot;. The inaugural Regina Medal in 1959 from the U.S.-based Catholic Library Association marks her &quot;continued, distinguished contribution to children&#x27;s literature&quot;.

In 1960, Farjeon donated her family book collection to the Dunedin Public Library. Her father had been a journalist in Dunedin in the 1860s before returning to England. The collection includes works by Farjeon, her father, brothers and niece. It also includes some music, photographs and correspondence, and two pictograph letters by Nicholas Chevalier, who was a family friend and illustrated many of Benjamin Farjeon&#x27;s books.
Farjeon died in Hampstead, London on 5 June 1965. She is buried in the north churchyard extension of St John-at-Hampstead.

The Children&#x27;s Book Circle, a society of publishers, present the Eleanor Farjeon Award annually to individuals or organisations whose commitment and contribution to children&#x27;s books is deemed to be outstanding.

Her work is cited as an influence by the Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki. Although she entitled her 1958 book on her friendship with Edward Thomas &quot;Book One of The Memoirs of Eleanor Farjeon&quot;, and outlined the plans for subsequent volumes, she never completed this prior to her death in 1965. Her niece Annabel Farjeon (1919–2004) incorporated the unfinished writings into her biography of her aunt &quot;Morning has Broken&quot; (1986).

==Writing==
Farjeon&#x27;s most widely published work is the hymn &quot;Morning has Broken&quot;, written in 1931 which in 1971 became an international hit when performed by Cat Stevens, reaching number nine in the UK charts, six on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number one on the U.S. easy listening chart in 1972, and number four on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; magazine charts. She also wrote the Advent carol &quot;People, Look East!&quot;, usually sung to an old French melody, and often performed by children&#x27;s choirs.
She wrote for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Have You Brought Your Music?&quot; The series was devised by Quentin Tod during the 1930s.

Farjeon&#x27;s plays for children, such as those to be found in &quot;Granny Gray&quot;, were popular for school performances throughout the 1950s and &#x27;60s because they were well within the capabilities of young children to perform and of teachers to direct. Several of the plays have a very large number of small parts, facilitating performance by a class, while others have only three or four performers.

Farjeon&#x27;s books include &quot;Martin Pippin in the Apple Orchard&quot; (1921) and its sequel, &quot;Martin Pippin in the Daisy Field&quot; (1937). These books, which had their origins in France when Farjeon was inspired to write about a troubadour, are actually set in Sussex and include descriptions of real villages and features such as the chalk cliffs and the Long Man of Wilmington. In &quot;Apple Orchard&quot;, the wandering minstrel Martin Pippin finds a lovelorn ploughman who begs him to visit the orchard where his beloved has been locked in the mill-house with six sworn virgins to guard her. Martin Pippin goes to the rescue and wins the confidence of the young women by telling them love stories. Although ostensibly a children&#x27;s book, the six love stories, which have much the form of Charles Perrault&#x27;s fairy tales such as &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot;, were written not for a child but for a young soldier, Victor Haslam, who had, like Farjeon, been a close friend of Edward Thomas. Among the stories, themes include the apparent loss of a loved one, betrayal, and the yearning of a woman for whom it appears that love will never come.

The sequel, &quot;Martin Pippin in the Daisy Field&quot; concerns six little girls whom Martin entertains while they are making daisy chains. The six stories, this time written for children, include &quot;Elsie Piddock Skips in her Sleep&quot; which has been published separately and is considered the finest of all Farjeon&#x27;s stories.

&quot;The Little Bookroom&quot; is a collection of what she considered her best stories, published by Oxford University Press in 1955 with illustrations by Edward Ardizzone. Farjeon won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association for that work, recognising the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book by a British subject. She also received the first international Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1956. This biennial award from the International Board on Books for Young People, now considered the highest lifetime recognition available to creators of children&#x27;s books, soon came to be called the Little Nobel Prize. Prior to 1962 it cited a single book published during the preceding two years.

In discussing his introduction to poetry, Stephen Fry cited Farjeon&#x27;s poems for children alongside those of A. A. Milne and Lewis Carroll as &quot;hardy annuals from the garden of English verse.&quot;

<text>The Rover Group plc was the British vehicle manufacturing conglomerate known as &quot;BL plc&quot; until 1986 (formerly British Leyland), which had been a state-owned company since 1975. It initially included the Austin Rover Group car business (comprising the Austin, Rover, Mini and MG marques), Land Rover Group, Freight Rover vans and Leyland Trucks. The Rover Group also owned the dormant trademarks from the many companies that had merged into British Leyland and its predecessors such as Triumph, Morris, Wolseley, Riley and Alvis.

The Rover Group was owned by British Aerospace (BAe) from 1988 to 1994. In 1994, BAe sold the remaining car business of Rover Group plc to the German company BMW. The group was then broken up in 2000, when Ford acquired the Land Rover division, with the Rover and MG marques continuing with the much smaller MG Rover Group until 2005. Ownership of the original Rover Group marques is currently split between BMW (Germany), SAIC (China), and Tata Motors (India), the latter owning the Rover marque itself with its subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover owning much of the assets of the historic Rover company.

==History==
The Rover Group plc was formed by renaming BL plc in 1986, soon after the appointment by Margaret Thatcher of Canadian Graham Day to the position of chairman and managing director of BL.

After divesting of its commercial vehicle and bus manufacturing divisions (Leyland Trucks, Leyland Bus and Freight Rover), and the spares and logistics firm Unipart, the company then consisted of the car manufacturing arm Austin Rover Group and the Land Rover Group. This group was privatised in 1988 by the sale of the company to British Aerospace (BAe) for £150 million, who retained Day as joint CEO and chairman, and made Kevin Morley MD of Rover cars.

The group changed its name again in 1989 to Rover Group Holdings Limited, whilst the car manufacturing subsidiary &quot;Austin Rover Group Limited&quot; shortened its name to &quot;Rover Group Limited&quot;. By this time, only the Rover, Land Rover and MG brands were still active – Austin had already been dropped in 1987, because it was felt by Graham Day&#x27;s new management that many of the other marque names within the former BL had been tarnished by their association with the poor quality cars of the 1970s.

The strategy going forward, therefore, was to concentrate on the upmarket Rover brand instead. Two vehicles originally badged as Austins, the Montego saloon and Maestro hatchback, became &quot;marque-less&quot; with bonnet badges the same shape as the Rover longship badge but without &quot;Rover&quot; written on them. Instead any badging just showed the model of the car. When the Austin Metro was facelifted for the 1990 model year, it was rebadged as the Rover Metro.

On 31 January 1994, BAe sold its 80% stake in the company on to German vehicle manufacturer BMW for £800 million (a takeover which caused uproar in the House of Commons), the name changing again in 1995 to BMW (UK) Holdings Limited. The Japanese manufacturer Honda, who owned the remaining 20% stake, terminated the long-standing alliance with BL/Rover which had been in existence since 1980 and also sold its shares to BMW a month later, although the licensing agreements surrounding the manufacture of the collaboratively developed Rover 200, 400, 600, and 800 models remained in place.

Millions of pounds of investment by BMW failed to turn the company into profit. It has been estimated that the entire Rover bankruptcy cost BMW fifteen billion Marks. In March 2000, BMW announced it planned to sell the Rover Group. Following bids from Alchemy Partners and Phoenix Consortium, the MG division, including a collection of dormant marques and the intellectual property rights and technical designs of MG and Rover-branded vehicles as well as the Longbridge plant were sold to the Phoenix Consortium, led by John Towers, an ex-Rover Group executive. BMW retained the historic Morris Motors assembly plant in Cowley and the Pressed Steel plant in Swindon to build the forthcoming new Mini family of vehicles, which had been developed at Longbridge by Rover Group and were due for launch within a year. Land Rover and the Solihull assembly plant were sold to Ford Motor Company, becoming part of Ford&#x27;s Premier Automotive Group, ultimately reuniting it with Jaguar which had been divested from British Leyland in 1984 and purchased by Ford in 1989.

=== Subsequent developments ===

All remaining Rover volume production at Cowley (essentially now just the Rover 75 as the Rover 600/800 ranges had already been discontinued by this point), was moved to Longbridge, as BMW demolished the Cowley and Swindon plants before starting construction of Plant Oxford, the new home of MINI production. Much smaller than its predecessors, the MG Rover Group struggled as it continued the heritage of building cars at the Longbridge plant. Adhering to UK regulations, BMW guaranteed that Phoenix Venture Holdings (initially named MG Rover Holdings) would have enough money to keep MG Rover Group in business for at least 3 years following the sale. The agreed &quot;dowry&quot; from BMW included a £427million interest-free loan and stocks of cars. MG Rover&#x27;s short-term plan was to expand the MG range with sporting versions of existing Rovers, introduce new versions of the Rover 25, 45 and 75 models, reengineer and redesign the MG F, and eventually replace the entire model range with new cars developed through a joint venture with another carmaker.

The MG Rover range initially consisted of five cars: the classic Mini, Rover 25, Rover 45, Rover 75 and MG F along with car-derived van derivatives of the 25. The Mini was only built under temporary license during the first five months of MG Rover&#x27;s existence. In 2001, the MG ZR, MG ZS and MG ZT (based on the Rover 25, Rover 45 and Rover 75 respectively) are launched as sporting alternatives to the standard Rover models. The range further expanded in 2003 with the launch of the smallest model, the Indian-built CityRover, built as part of a venture with TATA, the Rover Streetwise, a restyled version of the Rover 25 with SUV-like styling, and a flagship model, the MG XPower SV, based on the Qvale Mangusta.

Although the new company owned the intellectual property rights for MG and Rover-branded vehicles, including the Rover 75 that was developed under BMW ownership, the Rover marque was a property licensed from BMW. The rights to the Riley and Triumph marques, along with former Rover Group trademarks Metro and Maxi, were also strategically retained by BMW, as it believed these names are associated with the heritage of sports saloon car manufacturers, or with the heritage of Mini. MG Rover&#x27;s best year for car sales was their first full year of business, in 2001 – when they sold over 170,000 cars.

Following the collapse of a proposed venture with Malaysian carmaker Proton, in June 2004 Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation signed a joint venture partnership to develop new models and technologies with MG Rover, with the projection to produce up to a million cars a year, with the production shared between the Longbridge site and locations in China. MG Rover sold parts of Longbridge to St. Modwen Properties for £57.5M in a lease-back deal.

SAIC were to have a 70% stake in this company in return for a £1 billion investment, with MG Rover owning the remaining 30%. However, the National Development and Reform Commission held the opinion that if BMW could not make a success of Rover, then it would be hard for SAIC to do so. Although the joint venture was not yet finalized, MG Rover sold the rights to manufacture Rover&#x27;s 25 and 75 models and the Powertrain Ltd business to SAIC for £67M, to help keep the business afloat in the face of falling sales.

After MG Rover Group&#x27;s financial crisis and talks of acquisition or investment by Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) failed in early 2005, the MG Rover Group suspended production and went into receivership on 7 April 2005. Following liquidation, Nanjing Automobile Corporation bought the rights to the MG marque, and the leftover assets of MG Rover. A 33-year deal was signed in February 2006 between Nanjing Auto and St. Modwen Properties covering the lease of 105 acres (a quarter of the total area of the Longbridge plant) but including the two main car assembly plants, the paint shop and administrative offices at a rent of around £1.8 million a year. In December 2007, Nanjing and SAIC announced their merger, which reunited some of the marques that had formed Rover Group, and ownership of the Longbridge plant became a SAIC controlled facility.

Despite BMW agreeing to sell the Rover marque to SAIC, Ford bought the rights to the Rover name from BMW for approximately £6 million. As part of its purchase of Land Rover from BMW, Ford had acquired an option of first refusal to buy the Rover brand name if MG Rover Group ceased trading. Ford thus reunited the original Rover Company marques, primarily for brand-protection reasons. When Ford&#x27;s Jaguar and Land Rover businesses were sold to TATA Motors in 2008, Rover, along with the historically prestigious Daimler and Lanchester marques were transferred to TATA Motors.

===Timeline===
* 1986: BL plc renamed as &quot;The Rover Group plc&quot;&lt;br&gt;Rover SD1 production ceases after 10 years and the car is replaced by a new model called the Rover 800 – the result of a joint venture with Honda which led to the manufacture of that model and the Honda Legend
* 1987: The Leyland Trucks division (which by then included Freight Rover) merged with DAF to become DAF NV (which in the UK traded as Leyland DAF) with DAF Beheer holding 60%, Rover Group would hold 40%, floating in 1989. DAF NV had three plants; two truck plants in Eindhoven and Leyland and a van plant in Washwood Heath. DAF NV was declared bankrupt in 1993 and was split into three independent companies; the truck plant in Eindhoven resumed trading as DAF Trucks, the truck plant in Leyland resumed trading as Leyland Trucks and the van plant in Washwood Heath became LDV and continued trading until 2009. Both truck plants would be acquired by Paccar in 1996 and 1998 respectively&lt;br&gt;Unipart spare parts division sold in a management buyout&lt;br&gt;The Austin marque is shelved and the remaining models, the Metro, Maestro and Montego continue without a brand name until the Metro was relaunched as a Rover in 1990

==Models==
===Rover 800 series===
Although the Rover 800 went on sale shortly after BL plc changed its name to Rover Group in July 1986, it had been developed in conjunction with Honda (whose corresponding model was the Legend). It was initially available as a saloon with a fastback version launching in 1988. It sold well among buyers in the executive market, with a facelift in November 1991 and the introduction of a coupe version a few months later. However, it stagnated after a replacement targeted for the 1992 model year was cancelled. Many of its duties as a flagship were performed by the 600. The 800 series was updated again in 1996 which gave the car a chrome and silver grille and a lot more standard kit. By its demise in 1999, it was looking considerably dated and was replaced with the 75.

===Rover 200 series===

The Rover Group&#x27;s first significant new car launch was the Rover 200, which was introduced in October 1989. Unlike its predecessor, it was a three or five-door hatchback, the former to launch later, instead of a four-door saloon which would become the Rover 400. It used a new range of 16-valve K Series petrol engines as well as a Peugeot 1.9 diesel and 1.8 turbodiesel both fitted to the Phase 1 Peugeot 405. Sales were stronger than its successors and its launch coincided with a winding-down in production of the similarly sized Maestro, which finally ceased production at the end of 1994 having spent the final years of its life as a budget alternative to the more upmarket Rover 200. Coupe and cabriolet versions of the 200 were later launched in 1992 and these were sold alongside the all-new 1995 model and continued until that model was upgraded to become the Rover 25 in 1999. The 1989 Rover 200 was a strong seller throughout its life and its successor continued this trend, though its final year of production (1999) saw a significant dip in sales. These strong sales were not as high as the ever-popular Ford Escort and Vauxhall Astra. The Rover 200 had been around since 1988 as the Longbridge-built Honda Concerto, which offered a higher level of equipment but only achieved a fraction of its sales.

===Rover 400 series===

In April 1990, Rover launched the Rover 400 range. The 400 was essentially a four-door version of the 200 hatchback, but was slightly longer and offered more storage space. It also replaced the saloon version of the previous 200. It was sold as an alternative to the likes of the Ford Sierra and Vauxhall Cavalier, but was never able to match the success of these cars. An estate version of the 400 was launched in 1994 called the Tourer and continued alongside the all-new Honda Civic-based model that was launched the following year. The 1995 Rover 400 was a more substantial and popular alternative to other large family cars than its successor was, offering impressive equipment levels, but a relative shortage of interior space because it was nearer in size to cars in the next category down. The Rover 400 was facelifted in 1999 to become the Rover 45, and at the same time the estate version of the original 400 was dropped.
===Rover Metro/Rover 100===

May 1990 saw Rover give the decade-old Metro a major reworking, which most notably included internal and external restyling, as well as new 1.1 and 1.4 K-Series petrol engines. The new Metro offered some of the best standards of specification in any supermini at the time, and it sold well until being replaced by the Rover 100 (essentially another update of the original 1980 design) in December 1994. The Rover 100 remained in production for three years, selling reasonably well, until it was discontinued after a dismal crash test performance that saw demand fall dramatically. Its demise marked the passing of the last design from the British Leyland era of the company with production ceasing at the end of 1997. 
===Rover 600 series===

Rover entered the compact executive market in April 1993 with its 600 range. Sold only as a four-door saloon, the 600 was based on the Honda Accord but used Rover engines as well as Honda engines (Honda used Rover&#x27;s diesel engine in their European Accord) and had a classier interior. It was very popular in the compact executive market, but could not match the ever-popular BMW 3 Series. This was down in part to the pricing and model restrictions BMW (Rover group&#x27;s owner) had placed on the 600 series and its very close ties with the more downmarket Honda Accord. Production ended in early 1999 to make way for the new 75 model. 
===Maestro/Montego===


Unlike the Metro, which had received a major reengineering and was rebadged a Rover, the two last bastions from the British Leyland era had become increasingly uncompetitive in the marketplace and were kept in production merely to cater for the budget end of the market and for sale to fleets, as the newer Rover badged models were pushed further upmarket compared to rivals from Ford and General Motors (Vauxhall/Opel). The MG and high specification variants were both dropped from the Maestro/Montego ranges in 1991 so as not to overlap with the more expensive Rovers. Both had already lost their Austin badging in 1987 and were now known simply by their model names. Although the Montego had received a package of revisions for the 1989 model year, the Maestro remained essentially unchanged until 1992 when it received the Montego&#x27;s revised dashboard. The Maestro/Montego production line was effectively closed in 1993 (leading to the eventual sale and demolition of the old Morris Motors&#x27; works at Cowley in which it was located), and the last cars were essentially hand built on a purpose-built line. By 1994 the Montego saloon was only available to special order, and the Maestro was produced in basic &#x27;Clubman&#x27; trim with either 1.3 petrol or 2.0 diesel power.

Both models were discontinued in December 1994, being replaced by the new Honda Civic based Rover 400 series.

In September 1995, production of the Maestro was moved to Varna, Bulgaria, where it was sold in complete knock down (CKD) kit form by Rodacar AD. By April 1996, around 2,000 vehicles had been produced before the company ceased its operations due to high import costs of the components and low demand for the cars.

In May 1997, Parkway Services based in Ledbury purchased 621 of the kits that were not shipped to Bulgaria. These kits were built up and converted to right-hand drive. The conversions involved a brand new dash, right-hand drive wipers, and a steering column. These cars had a list price of £4995, which meant they were the cheapest new cars on sale in Britain between 1998 and 2001. Ledbury-built Maestros all had non-Rover VIN numbers.

A number of former Bulgarian cars were also sold in the UK by Apple 2000 Ltd, located in Culford, Bury St Edmunds. These vehicles, which were sold between 1998 and 2001, were similar to the Ledbury Maestro, but can be differentiated by their left-hand drive windscreen wipers and door mirrors. Because these were fully-built cars that were imported back to the UK, Apple 2000 Maestros have Rover VINs.

===Land Rover===
The Land Rover arm of the Rover Group expanded dramatically after the late 1980s. The Range Rover was officially introduced to the American market in 1987 after years of only being available as a grey-market vehicle. The first NAS Range Rover was sold on 16 March 1987, with demand far exceeding supply; Range Rovers were often resold for far more than their retail price. This was after its repositioning as a luxury vehicle, with higher equipment levels and options such as an automatic transmission and a diesel engine option being offered for the first time. The successful Discovery &#x27;family&#x27; 4x4 was launched in Europe in 1989 and became Europe&#x27;s top-selling 4x4 within 18 months. The Discovery brought with it an advanced diesel engine, which was soon fitted to the other models in the range.

This period saw Land Rover rationalise its operations, closing down satellite factories and increasing parts-sharing between models (axles, transmissions and engines were all shared, and the Discovery used the same chassis and many body panels as the Range Rover). The Ninety/One Ten range was fitted with the new diesel engine and renamed the Defender in 1990. An all-new Range Rover was launched in 1994, together with an improved Discovery which maintained high sales. A fourth model, the &#x27;mini-SUV&#x27; Freelander was introduced in late 1997 and replaced the Discovery as Europe&#x27;s best-selling 4x4 vehicle.

===MG===
The MG badge-engineering project (first implemented by Austin Rover in 1982 with the Metro) ended in 1991 despite some reasonable success for its Austin Maestro and Austin Montego ranges (the MG Metro had been discontinued after the facelift in 1990). The MG badge was revived in 1992 on the MG RV8 – an updated MG MGB which made use of a 3.9 V8 Range Rover power unit, but lacked modern refinements that were expected in similarly priced sports car of its era. The car didn&#x27;t sell as strongly as earlier MG sports car, and production had ended by 1995.

The &quot;real&quot; rebirth of MG sports cars occurred in 1995, when the MG F was launched. Powered by a 1.8 16-valve mid-mounted engine, it was an instant hit with buyers thanks to its distinctive styling and excellent ride and handling. It was a huge success in the roadster renaissance of the late 1990s, despite some buyers being let down by lacklusture build quality and reliability.

The MG name was revived on passenger cars in 2001 when the ZR, ZS and ZT models launched, based on the Rover 25, 45 and 75 models respectively.

==Sponsorship==
Rover Group sponsored the Scottish football team Dundee United from 1994 to 1996. The first match of the sponsorship was Dundee United&#x27;s Scottish Cup triumph in 1994, the club&#x27;s first ever success in the competition.

<text>British Motor Holdings Limited (BMH) was a British vehicle manufacturing company known until 14 December 1966 as British Motor Corporation Limited (BMC). BMH was created as a holding company following BMC&#x27;s takeover of both Jaguar Cars and the Pressed Steel Company in that year.

Thirteen months later, on 17 January 1968, under direct pressure from its national government, BMH merged with Leyland Motor Corporation (Standard-Triumph, Rover and Alvis cars, Leyland trucks and buses, Alvis fighting vehicles) to form British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC).

==History==

===1964 The Wilson government takes control===
The Wilson Labour Government (1964–1970) came to power at a time when British manufacturing industry was in decline and decided that the remedy was to promote more mergers, particularly in the motor industry. Chrysler was already buying into the Rootes Group, Leyland Motors had acquired Standard Triumph in 1961 (and would buy Rover in 1967) and had become a major automotive force. The British Motor Corporation (BMC) was suffering a dramatic drop in its share of the home market. Tony Benn, appointed Minister of Technology in July 1966, brought pressure to bear on the industry and one result was BMH&#x27;s merger with Leyland to form British Leyland.

====Pressed Steel====
In 1965 BMC had purchased Pressed Steel, Britain&#x27;s major car body manufacturer, and in the third quarter of 1966 it purchased Jaguar Cars. Three months later, to recognise the changed nature of their business, the company name was changed to British Motor (Holdings) Limited on 14 December 1966.

====Jaguar====
From the perspective of Jaguar, the sale to BMC which became firm in September 1966 (when BMC took control of Jaguar) came about for two principal reasons; First, Sir William Lyons, the managing director and co-founder of the company, saw the merger as the best way for Jaguar to ensure supplies of bodies from Pressed Steel, which supplied the company and was now owned by BMC. Second, Lyons, by now 65 and without his son John, who had been killed driving to Le Mans in 1955, did not have a long term succession plan. From the perspective of the BMC, a takeover of Jaguar was attractive because it was successful in the US market, and was thereby profitable at a time when BMC lacked the funds to invest sufficiently in modern production facilities or new models.

At the annual statement to shareholders for 1967, BMH chairman Sir George Harriman reported on Group Overseas Operations that the company had delivered to world markets (i.e. exported) 313,790 cars, commercial vehicles and tractors, including 72,049 manufactured overseas.

====The marques====
British Motor Holdings inherited a plethora of British automotive marques but by now they were the (famously) badge-engineered unified range of one manufacturer incorporating three sports cars, MGB, MG Midget / Austin-Healey Sprite, Austin Healey 3000 plus Jaguar saloons and sports car and its badge-engineered Daimlers, Coventry Climax industrial engines and Guy trucks.

In 1965, the year prior to the merger, BMC and Leyland&#x27;s annual production had reached one million vehicles per annum. By contrast, Jaguar&#x27;s total production in 1966 was 15,690 vehicles.

===Merger with Leyland===
On 17 January 1968 BMH merged with the smaller prosperous Leyland Motors to form the British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC) on a one-for-one share exchange, valuing BMH at £201 million. BMH had reported a £3.4 million loss for 1966/7.

<doc id="343076" wikidata="Q382273" url="?curid=343076" title="Hindko">
<text>Hindko (, , ) is a cover term for a diverse group of Lahnda dialects spoken by several million people of various ethnic backgrounds in several areas in northwestern Pakistan, primarily in the provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and northwestern regions of Punjab.

There is a nascent language movement, and in recent decades Hindko-speaking intellectuals have started promoting the view of Hindko as a separate language. There is a literary tradition based on Peshawari, the urban variety of Peshawar in the northwest, and another one based on the language of Abbottabad in the northeast. In the 2017 census of Pakistan, million people declared their language to be Hindko, while a 2020 estimate placed the number of speakers at 7 million.

Hindko to some extent is mutually intelligible with Punjabi and Saraiki, and has more affinities with the latter than with the former. Differences with other Punjabi varieties are more pronounced in the morphology and phonology than in the syntax.

The name &quot;Hindko&quot; means &quot;the Indian language&quot; or &quot;language of Hind&quot;, and refers to the Indo-Aryan speech forms spoken in the northern Indian subcontinent, in contrast to the neighbouring Pashto, an Iranic language spoken by the Pashtun people. An alternative local name for this language group is &quot;Hindki&quot;. A speaker of Hindko may be referred to as &quot;Hindki&quot;, &quot;Hindkun&quot;, or &quot;Hindkowan&quot; (&quot;Hindkuwan&quot;).

Like other Lahnda varieties, Hindko is derived from the Shauraseni Prakrit.

==Geographic distribution and dialects==
Varieties of Hindko are primarily spoken in a core area in the district of Attock in the northwestern corner of the province of Punjab, and in two neighbouring regions: in Peshawar to the north-west, and Hazara to the north-east, both in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly known as the North-West Frontier Province). The Hindko of Hazara also extends east into nearby regions of Kashmir.

The central dialect group comprises Kohati (spoken in the city of Kohat and a few neighbouring villages in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) and the three closely related dialects of Attock District, Punjab: Chacchi (spoken in Attock and Haripur Tehsils), Ghebi (spoken to the south in Pindi Gheb Tehsil) and Awankari (spoken in Talagang Tehsil, now part of Chakwal District). Rensch&#x27;s classification based on lexical similarity also assigns to this group the rural dialects of Peshawar District. Shackle, however, sees most of them as closely related to the urban variety of Peshawar City.

In a group of its own is Peshawari, the prestigious urban variety spoken in the city of Peshawar and the one that is promoted as a standardised literary language. It has a wide dialectal base and has undergone the influence of Urdu and Standard Punjabi.

A separate group is formed in the northeast by the relatively homogeneous dialects of the Hazara region, which are collectively known as &quot;Hazara Hindko&quot; or &quot;Northern Hindko&quot;, with the variety spoken in Kaghan Valley known as &quot;Kaghani&quot;, and the variety of Tanawal known variously as &quot;Tanoli Hindko&quot;, &quot;Tanoli&quot; or &quot;Tinauli&quot;.
Hindko is also spoken further east into Kashmir. It is the predominant language of the Neelum Valley, in the north of Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir, where it is locally known as &quot;Parmi&quot; (or &quot;Pārim&quot;; the name likely originated in the Kashmiri word &#x27;from the other side&#x27;, which was the term used by the Kashmiris of the Vale of Kashmir to refer to the highlanders, who spoke this language). This variety is also spoken across the Line of Control into Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir.

The whole dialect continuum of Hindko is partitioned by &quot;Ethnologue&quot; into two languages: Northern Hindko (ISO 639-3 code: hno) for the dialects of Hazara, and Southern Hindko (ISO 639-3: hnd) for the remaining varieties. This grouping finds support in the results of the intelligibility testing done by Rensch, which also found out that the southern dialects are more widely understood throughout the Hindko area than are the northern ones.

Hindko dialects gradually transition into other varieties of Lahnda and Punjabi to the south. For example, to the southwest across the Salt Range are found dialects of Saraiki, and at least one of these – the one spoken in the Dera Ismail Khan District – is sometimes also referred to as &quot;Hindko&quot;. To the southeast, Hindko is in a dialect continuum with Pahari–Pothwari, with the Galyat region of Abbottabad district and the area of Muzaffarabad in Azad Kashmir approximately falling on the boundary between the two.

There are Hindko diasporas in major urban centres like Karachi, as well as in some neighbouring countries. Some Hindu Hindkowans and Sikh Hindowans migrated to India after the partition of India in 1947. These Hindko speakers in India identify with the broader Punjabi community. There is also a small diaspora in Afghanistan, which includes members of the Hindu and Sikh community who became established there during the Sikh Empire in the first half of the 19th century. Most of them have emigrated since the rise of the Taliban, and the total population of Sikhs, Hindko-speaking or not, is estimated at around 300 families (as of 2018).

==Social setting==
There is no generic name for the speakers of Hindko because they belong to diverse ethnic groups and tend to identify themselves by the larger families or castes. However, the Hindko-speaking community belonging to the Hazara Division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are sometimes recognised collectively as Hazarewal. A large number of Hindko speakers in the Hazara Division are Pashtuns. Some of those speak Hindko as their mother tongue while others as a second language. These include the Tahirkhelis, Swatis, Yusufzais, Jadoons and Tareens. The other Hindko speakers include the Sayyids, Awans, Mughals, Tanolis, Turks, Qureshis and Gujjars.

The most common second language for Hindko-speakers in Pakistan is Urdu and the second most common one is Pashto. In most Hindko-speaking areas, speakers of Pashto live in the same or neighbouring communities (although this is less true in Abbottabad and Kaghan Valley). The relationship between Hindko and its neighbours is not one of stable bilingualism. In terms of domains of use and number of speakers, Hindko is dominant and growing in the north-east; in Hazara for example, it is displacing Pashto as the language in use among the Swati Pathans, and in the Neelam Valley of Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir it is gaining ground at the expense of the minority languages like Kashmiri. In the cities of Kohat and Peshawar, on the other hand, it is Hindko that is in a weaker position. With the exodus of the Hindko-speaking Hindus and Sikhs after Partitition and the consequent influx of Pashtuns into the vacated areas of the urban economy, there have been signs of a shift towards Pashto.

== Phonology ==
=== Consonants ===


Hindko contrasts stop consonants at the labial, alveolar, retroflex, palatal and velar places of articulation. The palatals have been described as pure stops (/ /) in Awankari, but as affricates () in the varieties of Hazara. For the stop consonants of most varieties of Hindko there is a three-way contrast between voiced (), voiceless () and aspirated (). Awankari, Kohati, and the varieties of Neelum Valley of Kashmir also distinguish voiced aspirated stops (). The disappearance of the voiced aspirates from most Hindko varieties has been linked to the development of tone (see below).

Fricatives like , and are found in loans (for example from Persian), but also in native words, often as positional allophones of the corresponding stop. Some documented instances include:
*before other consonants in Kohati ( &#x27;saying&#x27; versus &#x27;said&#x27;),
*in the middle or end of words in Peshawari ( &#x27;swallow (verb)&#x27;),
*word-medially after stressed vowels in Abbottabad Hindko ( &#x27;to look&#x27;),
*at the ends of words after vowels in the Hindko of Kashmir ( &#x27;write&#x27;).
Generally, the fricatives can be found in all positions: at the start, the middle, or at the end of the word (Tanoli Hindko: &#x27;spoilt&#x27;, &#x27;small stick&#x27;, &#x27;branch&#x27;), with relatively few exceptions (one being the restriction on word-final in the Hindko of Kashmir). The labio-dental has been explicitly described as the fricative for the Hindko of Kashmir, and Tanawal, but as the approximant // in Awankari.

Apart from and , Hindko dialects distinguish a varying number of other nasal consonants.
The retroflex nasal is overall shorter than the other nasals, and at least for the Hindko of Abbottabad it has been described as a nasalised flap: . For the Hindko of Kashmir it has been asserted to be an allophone of the alveolar nasal , but it is phonemic in Awankari and Tanoli; in both dialects it can occur in the middle and at the end of a word, as illustrated by the following examples from Tanoli: &#x27;straight&#x27;, &#x27;pride&#x27;. The velar nasal is phonemic in Tanoli: &#x27;prayer call&#x27;, &#x27;fiancée&#x27;, and in the Hindko of Kashmir, and in both cases it is found only in the middle or at the end of the word. In the main subdialect of Awankari, the velar nasal is only found before velar stops, and similarly, it is not among the phonemes identified for the Hindko of Abbottabad.

Hindko varieties have a single lateral consonant: the alveolar , unlike Punjabi, which additionally has a retroflex lateral . The Awankari dialect, as spoken by Muslims (and not Hindus) and described by Bahri in the 1930s, has a distinctive retroflex lateral, which, however, appears to be in complementary distribution with the alveolar lateral. There are two rhotic sounds in Hindko: an alveolar trill (with a varying number of vibrations dependent on the phonetic context), and a retroflex flap .

=== Vowels ===
Hindko has three short vowels , and , and six long vowels: , , , , and . 
The vowels can be illustrated with the following examples from Tanoli: &#x27;big stone&#x27;, &#x27;pain&#x27;, &#x27;yesterday&#x27;, &#x27;button&#x27;, &#x27;what&#x27;, &#x27;piece of meat&#x27;, &#x27;Sunday&#x27;, &#x27;thief&#x27;, &#x27;filth&#x27;.
Length is strongly contrastive and the long vowels are generally twice as long as the corresponding short vowels.
The Awankari dialect distinguishes between open and close &quot;o&quot; ( &#x27;soft&#x27; vs. &#x27;shoe&#x27;).

Varieties of Hindko also possess a number of diphthongs (like ). Which of the many (typically around a dozen) overt vowel combinations should be seen as representing an underlying single segment (a diphthong) rather than simply a sequence of two separate underlying vowels, has varied with the analysis used and the dialect studied.

==== Nasalised vowels ====
Hindko dialects possess phonemic nasal vowels (here marked with a tilde above the vowel: ). For example, in the Hindko of Azad Kashmir &#x27;animal disease&#x27; contrasts with &#x27;arm&#x27;, and &#x27;meat cutters&#x27; with &#x27;hindrances&#x27;. In this variety of Hindko, as well as in the Hindko of Tanawal, there are nasal counterparts for all, or almost all, of the long vowels, but none for the short vowels. In Awankari and the Hindko of Abbottabad, on the other hand, there is contrastive nasalisation for short vowels as well: &#x27;make one play&#x27; contrasts with &#x27;scatter&#x27; (in Awankari), &#x27;mixing&#x27; contrasts with &#x27;knot&#x27;).
Peshawari and Kohati presumably follow the pattern of Awankari but have historically lost nasalisation from the round vowels (like or ) at the end of the word.

Additionally, vowels get nasalised allophonically when adjacent to a nasal consonant. In the varieties of Tanawal and Kashmir both long and short vowels can be nasalised in this way, but only if they precede the nasal consonant: &#x27;washing&#x27;, &#x27;crying&#x27;. In the Hindko of Abbottabad, a vowel at the end of some words can be nasalised if it follows a nasal consonant. In the Awankari dialect, vowels can be allophonically nasalised both before and after a nasal consonant, but in either case the effect will depend on the position of stress (see for more details).

=== Tone ===
Unlike many Indo-Aryan languages, but in common with other Punjabi varieties, Hindko dialects have a system of pitch accent, which is commonly referred to as &quot;tone&quot;. In Punjabi, pitch accent has historically arisen out of the loss of voiced aspirates (. Thus in Standard Punjabi, if a voiced aspirate preceded the stressed vowel, it would lose its aspiration and cause the appearance of a high tone on that vowel: &gt; &#x27;tongue&#x27;. If it followed the stressed vowel, then it would lead to a high tone and lose its aspiration and, if word-initial, its voicing: &gt; &#x27;horse&#x27;. The same pattern has been reported for Hazara Hindko, with a low rising tone after historically voiced aspirates ( &#x27;horse&#x27; &lt; ), a high falling tone before historic voiced aspirates ( &#x27;leper&#x27; &lt; ), and level tone elsewhere ( &#x27;bitter&#x27;). According to preliminary observations on the Hazara Hindko variety of Abbottabad, the low tone is less prominent than in Majhi Punjabi, and a trace of the aspiration is preserved: for example &#x27;horse&#x27; would be .

The variety spoken to the north-east, in Neelam Valley, has preserved voiced aspirates at the start of the word, so presumably the low tone is not established there. However, there are observations of its appearance in the speech of the residents of the main villages along the highway, likely under the influence of Majhi and Hazara Hindko, and it has similarly been reported in the villages on the Indian side.

The southern Hindko varieties have similarly developed tone, but only when the voiced aspirate followed the stressed vowel; voiced aspirates preceding the stress have remained unchanged: thus &#x27;more&#x27; (&lt; ), but &#x27;daughter&#x27;. This tone is realised as high falling in Kohati and the eastern subdialect of Awankari, but as high in the northwestern Awankari subdialect. Like Kohati, the variety of Peshawar has high falling tone before historic voiced aspirates. However, it has also developed a distinct tone on stressed vowels after historic voiced aspirates, like northern Hindko and Majhi, with a similar loss of aspiration and voicing. But in contrast to Majhi, this tone is also high falling, and it is distinguished by the accompanying glottalisation: &#x27;daughter&#x27;, &#x27;congratulations&#x27;.

== Alphabet ==
Hindko is generally written in a variety of the Punjabi alphabet. It was created by Rehmat Aziz Chitrali at Khowar Academy Chitral.

==Literature==

The Gandhara Hindko Board is a leading organisation that has been active in the preservation and promotion of the Hindko and culture since 1993. The board was launched in Peshawar in year 1993 to preserve and promote Hindko —the second most spoken of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. It brings out four regular publications— &quot;Hindkowan&quot;, &quot;The Gandhara Voice&quot;, &quot; Sarkhail&quot; and &quot;Tarey&quot; and a number of occasional publications. Late professor Zahoor Ahmad Awan of Peshawar city, the author of 61 books and publications, was the founding-chairman of the board. Now the board is headed by Ejaz Ahmad Qureshi. The board has published first Hindko dictionary and several other books on a variety of topics. With head office in Peshawar, the organisation has regional offices in other cities of the province where Hindko is spoken and understood.

In 2003 the Gandhara Hindko Board published first a Hindko dictionary which was compiled by a prominent linguists from Abbottabad, Sultan Sakoon. The board published a second more comprehensive Hindko dictionary in 2007 prepared by Elahi Bakhsh Awan of the University of London. He is the author of Sarzamin e Hindko, and Hindko Sautiyat. His three booklets on Hindko phonology were published by the University of Peshawar in the late 1970s.

The Idara-e-Faroghe Hindko based in Peshawar is another body that is promoting Hindko. Riffat Akbar Swati and Aurangzeb Ghaznavi are main people of this organisation. The Idara has published the first Hindko translation of the Quran by Haider Zaman Haider and the first Ph.D. thesis on Hindko by E.B.A. Awan. A monthly magazine &quot;Faroogh&quot; is also published regularly from Peshawar under supervision of Aurangzeb Ghaznavi. In Karachi Syed Mehboob is working for the promotion of Hindko. His articles are frequently published in &quot;Farogh&quot; monthly. He is organiser of Hindko Falahi Forum.

Many organisations like Bazm-e-Ilm-o-Fun Abbottabad and Halqa-e-Yaraan Shinkyari promote Hindko and literature. Asif Saqib, Sufi Abdur Rasheed, Fazal-e-Akbar Kamal, Sharif Hussain Shah, Muhammad Farid, Yahya Khalid, Nazir Kasalvi, and Muhammad Hanif have contributed a lot in this regard. Sultan Sakoon has written the First Hindko dictionary that has been published by Gandhara Hindko Board. Sultan Sakoon stands out for his literary contribution as he is a prolific writer and his books including those on Hindko proverbs and Hindko riddles have been published.

===Poetry example===
An excerpt from the &quot;Kalām&quot; of Ahmad Ali Saayein:

Transliteration: &quot;Alif-Awal hai Alam e hast sī o&quot;
&quot;Hātif āp pukārā Bismillah&quot;
&quot;Fīr Qalam nū̃ hukum e Nawišt hoyā&quot;
&quot;Hus ke qalam sir māriyā Bismillah&quot;
&quot;Naqšā Loh e Mahfūz dai wic sine&quot;
&quot;Qalam sāf utāriyā Bismillah&quot;
&quot;Is Tahrīr nū̃ paṛah ke Farištiyā̃ ne&quot;
&quot;Sāiyā̃ Šukar guzāriyā Bismillah&quot;

Translation: &quot;He is the foremost from the world of existence
Voice of the unseen exclaimed Bismillah
The pen was ordered to write
Pen carried out the order to write Bismillah
When angels read this composition
Saaieaan, they showed their thankfulness with Bismillah&quot;

===Proverbs===
Hindko has a rich heritage of proverbs (Hindko &quot;matlaan&quot;, sg. &quot;matal&quot;). An example of a proverb:

Transliteration: &quot;Jidur sir udur sarhanra&quot;

Translation: &quot;Good person gains respect everywhere.&quot;

<doc id="343082" wikidata="Q5180627" url="?curid=343082" title="Cragside">
<text>Cragside is a Victorian Tudor Revival country house near the town of Rothbury in Northumberland, England. It was the home of William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong, founder of the Armstrong Whitworth armaments firm. An industrial magnate, scientist, philanthropist and inventor of the hydraulic crane and the Armstrong gun, Armstrong also displayed his inventiveness in the domestic sphere, making Cragside the first house in the world to be lit using hydroelectric power. The estate was technologically advanced; the architect of the house, Richard Norman Shaw, wrote that it was equipped with &quot;wonderful hydraulic machines that do all sorts of things&quot;. In the grounds, Armstrong built dams and lakes to power a sawmill, a water-powered laundry, early versions of a dishwasher and a dumb waiter, a hydraulic lift and a hydroelectric rotisserie. In 1887, Armstrong was raised to the peerage, the first engineer or scientist to be ennobled, and became Baron Armstrong of Cragside.

The original building consisted of a small shooting lodge which Armstrong built between 1862 and 1864. In 1869, he employed the architect Richard Norman Shaw to enlarge the site, and in two phases of work between 1869 and 1882, they transformed the house into a northern Neuschwanstein. The result was described by the architect and writer Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel as &quot;one of the most dramatic compositions in all architecture&quot;. Armstrong filled the house with a significant art collection; he and his wife were patrons of many 19th-century British artists. Cragside became an integral part of Armstrong&#x27;s commercial operations: honoured guests under Armstrong&#x27;s roof, including the Shah of Persia, the King of Siam and two future Prime Ministers of Japan, were also customers for his commercial undertakings.

Following Armstrong&#x27;s death in 1900, his heirs struggled to maintain the house and estate. In 1910, the best of Armstrong&#x27;s art collection was sold off, and by the 1970s, in an attempt to meet inheritance tax, plans were submitted for large-scale residential development of the estate. In 1971 the National Trust asked the architectural historian Mark Girouard to compile a gazetteer of the most important Victorian houses in Britain which the Trust should seek to save should they ever be sold. Girouard placed Cragside at the top of the list; in 1977, the house was acquired by the Trust with the aid of a grant from the National Land Fund. A Grade I listed building since 1953, Cragside has been open to the public since 1979.

==History==
===William Armstrong===

William Armstrong was born on 26 November 1810 in Newcastle upon Tyne, the son of a corn merchant. Trained as a solicitor, he moved to London before he was twenty. Returning to Newcastle, in 1835 he met and married Margaret Ramshaw, the daughter of a builder. A keen amateur scientist, Armstrong began to conduct experiments in both hydraulics and electricity. In 1847, he abandoned the law for manufacturing and established W. G. Armstrong and Company at a site at Elswick, outside Newcastle. By the 1850s, with his design for the Armstrong Gun, Armstrong laid the foundations for an armaments firm that would, before the end of the century, see Krupp as its only world rival. He established himself as a figure of national standing: his work supplying artillery to the British Army was seen as an important response to the failures of Britain&#x27;s forces during the Crimean War. In 1859, he was knighted and made Engineer of Rifled Ordnance, becoming the principal supplier of armaments to both the Army and the Royal Navy.

===Shooting box: 1862–1865===
Armstrong had spent much of his childhood at Rothbury, escaping from industrial Newcastle for the benefit of his often poor health. He returned to the area in 1862, not having taken a holiday for over fifteen years. On a walk with friends, Armstrong was struck by the attractiveness of the site for a house. Returning to Newcastle, he bought a small parcel of land and decided to build a modest house on the side of a moorland crag. He intended a house of eight or ten rooms and a stable for a pair of horses. The house was completed in the mid-1860s by an unknown architect: a two-storey shooting box of little architectural distinction, it was nevertheless constructed and furnished to a high standard.

===Fairy palace: 1869–1900===
Armstrong&#x27;s architect for Cragside&#x27;s expansion was the Scot R. Norman Shaw. Shaw had begun his career in the office of William Burn and had later studied under Anthony Salvin and George Edmund Street. Salvin had taught him the mastery of internal planning which was essential for the design of the large and highly variegated houses which the Victorian wealthy craved. Salvin and Street had taught him to understand the Gothic Revival. At only 24, he won the RIBA Gold Medal and Travelling Studentship. The connection between Armstrong and Shaw was made when Armstrong purchased a picture, &quot;Prince Hal taking the crown from his father&#x27;s bedside&quot; by John Callcott Horsley, which proved too large to fit into his town house in Jesmond, Newcastle. Horsley was a friend of both, and recommended that Shaw design an extension to the banqueting hall Armstrong had previously built in the grounds. When this was completed in 1869, Shaw was asked for enlargements and improvements to the shooting lodge Armstrong had had built at Rothbury four years earlier. This was the genesis of the transformation of the house between 1869 and 1884. Over the next thirty years, Cragside became the centre of Armstrong&#x27;s world; reminiscing years later, in his old age, he remarked, &quot;had there been no Cragside, I shouldn&#x27;t be talking to you todayfor it has been my very life&quot;.

The architectural historian Andrew Saint records that Shaw sketched out the whole design for the &quot;future fairy palace&quot; in a single afternoon, while Armstrong and his guests were out on a shooting party. After this rapid initial design, Shaw worked on building the house for over 20 years. The long building period, and Armstrong&#x27;s piecemeal, and changeable, approach to the development of the house, and his desire to retain the original shooting lodge at its core, occasionally led to tensions between client and architect, and to a building that lacks an overall unity. Armstrong changed the purpose of several rooms as his interests developed, and the German architectural historian Hermann Muthesius, writing just after Armstrong&#x27;s death in 1900, noted that &quot;the house did not find the unqualified favour with Shaw&#x27;s followers that his previous works had done, nor did it entirely satisfy (Shaw)&quot;. Nevertheless, Shaw&#x27;s abilities, as an architect and as a manager of difficult clients, ensured that Cragside was composed &quot;with memorable force&quot;.
As well as being Armstrong&#x27;s home, Cragside acted as an enormous display case for his ever-expanding art collection. The best of his pictures were hung in the drawing room, but Shaw also converted the museum into a top-lit picture gallery. Pride of place was given to John Everett Millais&#x27;s &quot;Chill October&quot;, bought by Armstrong at the Samuel Mendel sale at Christie&#x27;s in 1875. Armstrong also bought Millais&#x27; &quot;Jephthah&#x27;s Daughter&quot; at the Mendel sale. Both were sold in the 1910 sale; &quot;Chill October&quot; is now in the private collection of Andrew Lloyd Webber, and &quot;Jephthah&#x27;s Daughter&quot; is held by the National Museum Cardiff.

Cragside was an important setting for Armstrong&#x27;s commercial activities. The architectural writer Simon Jenkins records: &quot;Japanese, Persian, Siamese and German dignitaries paid court to the man who equipped their armies and built their navies&quot;. In his 2005 book &quot;Landmarks of Britain&quot;, Clive Aslet notes visits with the same purpose from the Crown Prince of Afghanistan and the Shah of Persia. The Shah Naser al-Din visited in July 1889, and the Afghan prince Nasrullah Khan in June 1895. Armstrong&#x27;s biographer Henrietta Heald mentions two future prime ministers of Japan, Katō Takaaki and Saitō Makoto, among a steady stream of Japanese industrialists, naval officers, politicians and royalty who inscribed their names in the Cragside visitors&#x27; book. The Chinese diplomat Li Hung Chang visited in August 1896. King Chulalongkorn of Siam was staying in August 1897, when activity at the Elswick Works was disrupted by a bitter strike over pay and hours.

In August 1884 the Prince and Princess of Wales (the future Edward VII and Queen Alexandra) made a three-day visit to Cragside; it was the peak of Armstrong&#x27;s social career. The royal arrival at the house was illuminated by ten thousand lamps and a vast array of Chinese lanterns hung in the trees on the estate; fireworks were launched from six balloons, and a great bonfire was lit on the Simonside Hills. On the second day of their visit, the Prince and Princess travelled to Newcastle, to formally open the grounds of Armstrong&#x27;s old house, Jesmond Dean, which he had by then donated to the city as a public park. It is still a public park today, a ravine known as Jesmond Dene. Three years later, at the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria, Armstrong was ennobled as Baron Armstrong of Cragside, and became the first engineer and the first scientist to be granted a peerage. Among many other celebrations, he was awarded the freedom of the City of Newcastle. In his vote of thanks, the mayor noted that one in four of the entire population of the city was employed directly by Armstrong, or by companies over which he presided.

===Armstrong&#x27;s heirs: 1900–present===
Armstrong died at Cragside on 27 December 1900, aged 90, and was buried beside his wife in the churchyard at Rothbury. His gravestone carries an epitaph: &quot;His scientific attainments gained him a world wide celebrity and his great philanthropy the gratitude of the poor&quot;. Cragside, and Armstrong&#x27;s fortune, were inherited by his great-nephew, William Watson-Armstrong. Watson-Armstrong lacked Armstrong&#x27;s commercial acumen and a series of poor financial investments led to the sale of much of the great art collection in 1910. In 1972, the death of Watson-Armstrong&#x27;s heir, William John Montagu Watson-Armstrong, saw the house and estate threatened by large-scale residential development, intended to raise the money to pay a large inheritance tax bill. In 1971, when advising the National Trust on the most important Victorian houses to be preserved for the nation in the event of their sale, Mark Girouard had identified Cragside as the top priority. A major campaign saw the house and grounds acquired by the Trust in 1977, with the aid of a grant from the National Land Fund.

In 2007, Cragside reopened after undergoing an 18-month refurbishment programme that included rewiring the whole house. It has become one of the most-visited sites in North East England, with some 255,005 visitors in 2019. The Trust continues restoration work, allowing more of the house to be displayed: Armstrong&#x27;s electrical room, in which he conducted experiments on electrical charges towards the end of his life, was re-opened in 2016. The experiments had led to the publication in 1897 of Armstrong&#x27;s last work, &quot;Electrical Movement in Air and Water&quot;, illustrated with remarkable early photographs by his friend John Worsnop.

The Trust continues the reconstruction of the wider estate, with plans to redevelop Armstrong&#x27;s glasshouses, including the palm house, the ferneries and the orchid house.

==Architecture and description==

Cragside is an example of Shaw&#x27;s Tudor revival style; the Pevsner Architectural Guide for Northumberland called it &quot;the most dramatic Victorian mansion in the North of England&quot;. The entrance front was described by Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel as &quot;one of the most dramatic compositions in all architecture&quot;, and the architectural historian James Stevens Curl regarded the house as &quot;an extraordinarily accomplished Picturesque composition&quot;. Criticism focuses on the building&#x27;s lack of overall coherence; in &quot;The National Trust Book of the English House,&quot; Aslet and Powers describe the house as &quot;large and meandering&quot;, and the architectural critics Dixon and Muthesius write that &quot;the plan rambles along the hillside&quot;. Saint is even more dismissive: for him, &quot;the plan of Cragside is little better than a straggle&quot;. The half-timbering above the entrance has also been criticised as unfaithful to the vernacular tradition of the North-East. Shaw would have been unconcerned; desiring it for &quot;romantic effect, he reached out for it like an artist reaching out for a tube of colour&quot;.

The architectural historian J. Mordaunt Crook considers Cragside to be one of the very few country houses built by the Victorian commercial plutocracy that was truly &quot;avant-garde or trend-setting&quot;. In his study, &quot;The Rise of the Nouveaux Riches&quot;, Crook contends that many new-monied owners were too domineering, and generally chose second-rate architects, as these tended to be more &quot;pliant&quot;, allowing the clients to get their own way, rather than those of the first rank such as Shaw. The Rhenish flavour of the house makes a notable contrast with a country house that was almost contemporaneous with Cragside: the Villa Hügel constructed by Armstrong&#x27;s greatest rival, Alfred Krupp. While Armstrong&#x27;s Northumbrian fastness drew on Teutonic inspirations, his German competitor designed and built a house that was an exercise in neoclassicism.

The location for the house was described by Mark Girouard as &quot;a lunatic site&quot;. Pevsner and Richmond call both the setting and the house Wagnerian. The ledge on which it stands is narrow, and space for the repeated expansions could only be found by dynamiting the rock face behind, or by building upwards. Such challenges only drove Armstrong on, and overcoming the technical barriers to construction gave him great pleasure. His task was made easier by the use of the workforce and the technology of the Elswick Works. The architectural historian Jill Franklin notes that the vertiginous fall of the site is so steep that the drawing room, on a level with the first-floor landing at the front of the house, meets the rock face at the back.

Jenkins describes the plan of the house as &quot;simpler than the exterior suggests&quot;. The majority of the reception rooms are located on the ground floor, as are the accompanying service rooms. The exception is the large extension Shaw added to the south-east from 1882. This includes the drawing room, completed for the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales, in August 1884.

The house has been a Grade I listed building since 21 October 1953, the listing citing &quot;inter alia&quot; its &quot;largely complete Victorian interior&quot;. The architectural correspondent of &quot;The Times&quot;, Marcus Binney, who was closely involved in the campaign to bring Cragside to the National Trust, noted the historic importance of this &quot;virtually untouched interior&quot;, with its collections of furnishings, furniture (much designed especially for Cragside), and fine and decorative arts, with work by many notable designers of the period, including William Morris, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Philip Webb and Edward Burne-Jones. Pevsner notes that the art collection demonstrated &quot;what was permissible to the Victorian nobleman in the way of erotica&quot;.

===Kitchen, service rooms and Turkish bath===

The kitchen is large by Victorian standards and forms a considerable apartment with the butler&#x27;s pantry. It displays Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;technical ingenuity&quot; to the full, having a dumb waiter and a spit both run on hydraulic power. An electric gong announced mealtimes. For the visit of Edward and Alexandra, Armstrong brought in the Royal caterers, Gunters, who used the kitchen to prepare an eight-course menu which included oysters, turtle soup, stuffed turbot, venison, grouse, peaches in maraschino jelly and brown bread ice cream. Off the kitchen, under the library, is a Victorian Turkish bath, an unusual item in a Victorian private house. The writer Michael Hall suggests that the bath, with its plunge pool, was intended as much to demonstrate Armstrong&#x27;s copious water supply as for actual use. As was often the case, Armstrong also found practical application for his pleasures: steam generated while warming dry air for the Turkish bath supported the provision of heating for the house.

===Library and dining room===

Girouard describes the library as &quot;one of the most sympathetic Victorian rooms in England&quot;. It belongs to the first phase of Shaw&#x27;s construction work and was completed in 1872. It has a large bay window which gives views out over the bridge and the glen. The room is half-panelled in oak and the fireplace includes fragments of Egyptian onyx, collected during Armstrong&#x27;s visit to the country in 1872. The library originally contained some of Armstrong&#x27;s best pictures, although most were rehung in the gallery or drawing room, following Shaw&#x27;s later building campaign of the 1880s, and then sold in 1910, ten years after Armstrong&#x27;s death. The highlight was Albert Joseph Moore&#x27;s &quot;Follow My Leader&quot;, dating from 1872. Andrew Saint considers the room &quot;Shaw&#x27;s greatest domestic interior&quot;. The dining room off the library contains a &quot;Gothic&quot; fireplace with an inglenook.

A portrait of Armstrong by Henry Hetherington Emmerson shows him sitting in the inglenook with his dogs, under a carved inscription on the mantlepiece reading &quot;East or West, Best&quot;. The stained glass in the windows of the inglenook is by William Morris, and other glass from Morris &amp; Co., to designs by Rossetti, Burne-Jones, Webb and Ford Madox Brown, was installed in the library, gallery and upper stairs.

===Owl suite===
The Owl rooms were constructed in the first building campaign and formed a suite for important guests. Their name derives from the carved owls that decorate the woodwork and the bed. The room is panelled in American Black walnut, the same wood from which the tester bed is carved. Saint notes that Shaw was &quot;proud of the design&quot;, displaying a further &quot;owl-bed&quot; in an exhibition in 1877. The Prince and Princess of Wales occupied the rooms during their stay at Cragside in 1884. Other bedrooms, notably the Yellow and White rooms, were hung with wallpaper by William Morris, including early versions of his &quot;Fruit&quot; and &quot;Bird and Trellis&quot; designs. The wallpapers were reprinted using the original printing blocks and rehung in the National Trust&#x27;s renovations.

===Gallery===
The gallery originally formed Armstrong&#x27;s museum room and was built by Shaw between 1872 and 1874. It led to the observatory in the Gilnockie Tower. Later, the room formed a processional route to the newly created drawing room, and was transformed into a gallery for pictures and sculpture. Its lighting displayed further evidence of Armstrong&#x27;s technical ingenuity. Provided with twelve overhead lamps, the lighting for the room could be supplemented by a further eight lamps, powered by electric current transferred from the lamps in the dining room when they were no longer required. Lighting, and his means of providing it, mattered to Armstrong, on both technical and aesthetic levels; he wrote, &quot;in the passageways and stairs the lamps are used without shades and present a most beautiful and star-like appearance.&quot;

===Drawing room===

The drawing room was constructed in the 1880s phase of building, when Armstrong had sold his Jesmond house and was residing solely at Cragside. Aslet suggests that the inspiration for the design was the great hall at Haddon Hall, Derbyshire, although Saint considers Shaw&#x27;s Dawpool Hall, Cheshire as the more likely source. Pevsner and Richmond mention Hardwick Hall and Hatfield House as possible models for the &quot;spectacular&quot; overall design. The room contains a colossal marble inglenook chimneypiece, reputed to weigh ten tons, and designed by Shaw&#x27;s assistant, W. R. Lethaby. Muthesius describes the fireplace as a &quot;splendid example ... with finely composed relief decoration&quot;. Jenkins considers it &quot;surely the world&#x27;s biggest inglenook&quot; and describes the overall impact of the room as &quot;sensational&quot;, noting the top-lit ceiling and the elaborate Jacobethan plasterwork. Others have been less complimentary; the writer Reginald Turnor, no admirer either of Shaw or of Victorian architecture and its architects more generally, wrote of the room&#x27;s &quot;flamboyant and rather sickening detail&quot;. By the time of its construction, Shaw, increasingly working for clients of great wealth, had moved on from his &quot;Old English&quot; style, and the room is designed and decorated in a grander and more opulent Renaissance taste.

===Billiard room===
The billiard room extension of 1895 is by Frederick Waller. It replaced a laboratory, in which Armstrong conducted experiments in electric currents. The billiard table and furniture were supplied by Burroughes and Watts. The billiard room and adjacent gun room formed a smoking suite, the previous absence of which is evidenced in a watercolour painted to commemorate the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales. The Prince and Armstrong are shown smoking cigars on the terrace, as Victorian convention did not permit smoking in the principal reception rooms.

==Technology==

After his first visit in 1869, Shaw described the house in a letter to his wife, noting the &quot;wonderful hydraulic machines that do all sorts of things you can imagine&quot;. By building dams, Armstrong created five new lakes on the estate, Debdon, Tumbleton, Blackburn, and the Upper and Lower lakes at Nelly&#x27;s Moss. In 1868, a hydraulic engine was installed. Inspired by a watermill on the Dee in Dentdale, in 1870 Armstrong installed a Siemens dynamo in what was the world&#x27;s first hydroelectric power station. The generators, which also provided power for the farm buildings on the estate, were constantly extended and improved to meet the increasing electrical demands in the house. The 2006 regeneration project included extensive rewiring. A new screw turbine, with a -long Archimedes&#x27; screw, was installed in 2014; it can provide 12 kW, supplying around 10 per cent of the property&#x27;s electricity consumption.

The electricity generated was used to power an arc lamp installed in the picture gallery in 1878. This was replaced in 1880 by Joseph Swan&#x27;s incandescent lamps in what Swan considered &quot;the first proper installation&quot; of electric lighting. Armstrong knew Swan well and had chaired the presentation of Swan&#x27;s new lamps to the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne. Historic England describes Cragside as the &quot;first (house) in the world to be lit by electricity derived from water power&quot;. The use of electricity to run the house&#x27;s appliances and internal systems made Cragside a pioneer of home automation; one of the first private residences to have a dishwasher, a vacuum cleaner and a washing machine, the conservators Sarah Schmitz and Caroline Rawson suggest Cragside was &quot;the place where modern living began&quot;. The spit in the kitchen was also powered by hydraulics. The conservatory contained a self-watering system for the pot plants, which turned on water-powered revolving stands. Telephony was introduced, both between the rooms in the house, and between the house and other buildings on the estate. A plaque at Bamburgh Castle, Armstrong&#x27;s other residence on the Northumbrian coast, records that his development of these new automated technologies &quot;emancipated ... much of the world from household drudgery&quot;.

==Grounds and estate==

Cragside is named after &quot;Cragend Hill&quot; above the house, and is surrounded by an extensive rock garden, with a collection of rhododendrons, one of which is named after Lady Armstrong, who made a considerable contribution to the design and construction of the gardens, and large plantings of mostly coniferous trees. Among these is the tallest Scots pine in Britain, at a height of . Over one hundred years after their planting, Jill Franklin wrote that, &quot;the great, dark trees form a protective barrier to (Armstrong&#x27;s) home&quot;. Armstrong continued to buy land after the purchase of the original site and by the 1880s the gardens and grounds comprised some , with the wider estate, including Armstrong&#x27;s agricultural holdings, extending to according to Henrietta Heald&#x27;s 2012 biography of Armstrong, and to over according to the historian David Cannadine. David Dougan records the traditional claim that Armstrong planted over seven million trees in the gardens and parkland. The estate is a sanctuary for some of the last remaining red squirrel colonies in England.
The glen north-west of the house is spanned by an iron bridge, crossing the Debdon Burn, constructed to Armstrong&#x27;s design at his Elswick Works in the 1870s. It is a Grade II* listed structure and was restored by the Trust, and reopened to the public in 2008–2009. The gardens themselves are listed Grade I, and some of the architectural and technological structures have their own historic listings. The Clock Tower, which regulated life on the estate, dates from the time of the construction of the shooting lodge, and might have been designed by the same architect; it is not by Shaw. It is possible that Armstrong himself designed the clock. Like the bridge, the Clock Tower has a Grade II* listing. The formal gardens, where Armstrong&#x27;s great greenhouses stood and which were long separated from the main estate, have now been acquired by the Trust.

==Media appearances==
Cragside has featured in an Open University Arts Foundation Course, Jonathan Meades&#x27;s documentary series &quot;Abroad Again in Britain&quot;, BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Britain&#x27;s Hidden Heritage&quot;, &quot;Glorious Gardens from above&quot;,
&quot;Great Coastal Railway Journeys&quot;, 
&quot; Hidden Treasures of the National Trust&quot; and ITV&#x27;s series &quot;Inside the National Trust&quot;. The 2017 film &quot;The Current War&quot; was partly filmed at the estate. Cragside featured as the basis for the representation of Lockwood Manor in &quot;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom&quot;.

<text>In number theory, cousin primes are prime numbers that differ by four. Compare this with twin primes, pairs of prime numbers that differ by two, and sexy primes, pairs of prime numbers that differ by six.

The cousin primes (sequences and in OEIS) below 1000 are:

:(3, 7), (7, 11), (13, 17), (19, 23), (37, 41), (43, 47), (67, 71), (79, 83), (97, 101), (103, 107), (109, 113), (127, 131), (163, 167), (193, 197), (223, 227), (229, 233), (277, 281), (307, 311), (313, 317), (349, 353), (379, 383), (397, 401), (439, 443), (457, 461), (463,467), (487, 491), (499, 503), (613, 617), (643, 647), (673, 677), (739, 743), (757, 761), (769, 773), (823, 827), (853, 857), (859, 863), (877, 881), (883, 887), (907, 911), (937, 941), (967, 971)

== Properties ==

The only prime belonging to two pairs of cousin primes is 7. One of the numbers will always be divisible by 3, so is the only case where all three are primes.

An example of a large proven cousin prime pair is for
:formula_1
which has 20008 digits. In fact, this is part of a prime triple since is also a twin prime (because is also a proven prime).

, the largest-known pair of cousin primes was found by S. Batalov and has 86,138 digits. The primes are:
:formula_2
:formula_3

If the first Hardy–Littlewood conjecture holds, then cousin primes have the same asymptotic density as twin primes. An analogue of Brun&#x27;s constant for twin primes can be defined for cousin primes, called Brun&#x27;s constant for cousin primes, with the initial term (3, 7) omitted, by the convergent sum:

:formula_4

Using cousin primes up to 242, the value of was estimated by Marek Wolf in 1996 as

:formula_5

This constant should not be confused with Brun&#x27;s constant for prime quadruplets, which is also denoted .

The Skewes number for cousin primes is 5206837 ().

<text>Henry Wise Wood, CMG (May 31, 1860 – June 10, 1941) was an American-born Canadian agrarian thinker and activist. He became director in 1914 and was elected president of the United Farmers of Alberta in 1916. Under his leadership the UFA became the most powerful political lobby group in the province. In 1919, Wood oversaw the transition of the UFA into a political party and in 1921 they formed the government of Alberta, winning 38 of 61 seats in the Legislative Assembly. Wood refused to enter electoral politics himself but led the UFA&#x27;s extra-parliamentary organization throughout, and influenced the elected government from the sidelines.

==Background and early career==
Wood was born on a farm near Monroe City, Missouri to a prosperous farming family with land holding in Missouri and Texas. He became an accomplished stockman while still a teenager. At the age of 44 he visited Alberta and the following year (1905) purchased a wheat farm and moved his family to Carstairs, Alberta.

==Leadership of United Farmers of Alberta==

An earnest student of agrarian reform, he had observed the Alliance and Populist movements in Missouri during the 1890s and after relocating to Canada soon joined the Society for Equity, an early farm association. In 1909 the Society for Equity merged with the Alberta Farmers&#x27; Association to form the United Farmers of Alberta. In 1914 Wood became a director of the UFA; in 1915 he was elected vice-president and was president from 1916 to 1931.

===Class conflict ideology===

Wood became well known as the main theorist and head of the radical Albertan branch of the wave of agrarian discontent that was sweeping Canada at the time. He consistently refused to run for office. After initial opposition due to past experience with will-fated political farm organizations in the U.S., he backed the United Farmers when they began to engage in direct politics - running for office - and also supported the Progressive Party of Canada and UFA candidates federally. Wood&#x27;s basic ideology was one of supporting farmers&#x27; class interests against bankers and industrialists and hope for birth of cooperative society. He put forward new idea of representative government - the concept of &quot;group government&quot; - in which a legislature proportionally representing each sector of the society would replace the existing parliamentary system where political parties represent narrow class interests. 

==Later life==

Appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1935, Wood continued to play an important role in the UFA until 1937 when he retired to his farm in Carstairs, Alberta.

He died in 1941. A school in Calgary, Henry Wise Wood Senior High, was named after him.

<doc id="343109" wikidata="Q1299366" url="?curid=343109" title="Tourism in Slovenia">
<text>Slovenia offers tourists a wide variety of landscapes: Alpine in the northwest, Mediterranean in the southwest, Pannonian in the northeast, and Dinaric in the southeast. They roughly correspond to the traditional regions of Slovenia, based on the former four Habsburg crown lands (Carniola, Carinthia, Styria, and the Littoral). Each offers its own natural, geographic, architectural, and cultural features. Slovenia has mountains, meadows, lakes, caves, and the sea, making it an attractive destination in Europe.

The nation&#x27;s capital, Ljubljana, has many important Baroque and Art Nouveau buildings, with several important works of the native born architect Jože Plečnik. Other attractions include the Julian Alps with picturesque Lake Bled and the Soča Valley, as well as the nation&#x27;s highest peak, Mount Triglav. Perhaps even better known is the Karst Plateau in the Slovenian Littoral. More than 28 million visitors have visited Postojna Cave, while a 15-minute ride from it are Škocjan Caves, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Several other caves are open to public, including Vilenica Cave.

Further in the same direction is the Adriatic coast, where the most important historical monument is the Venetian Gothic Mediterranean town of Piran. The neighboring town of Portorož is a popular modern tourist resort, offering entertainment in gambling tourism. The former fishermen town of Izola has also been transformed into a popular tourist destination; many tourists also appreciate the old Medieval center of the port of Koper, which is however less popular among tourists than the other two Slovenian coastal towns.

Styria is known for its white wine, especially the Ljutomer Riesling, after the ski resort Pohorje, after summer cultural festivals in Maribor, and after pumpkin seed oil. It is also known as a hop growing area producing Styrian Goldings, a variety of the English aroma hop Fuggles.

The northeastern Prekmurje region is known for its distinctive cuisine. Among traditional dishes, the best known are a pork, turnip and millet casserole called &quot;bujta repa&quot; and a layered pastry called &quot;prekmurska gibanica&quot;. An important spa town in the region is Moravske Toplice, which is attracting many German, Austrian, Italian and Russian visitors.

Rural tourism is important throughout the country, and it is especially developed in the Karst Plateau region, parts of Inner Carniola, Lower Carniola and northern Istria, and in the area around Podčetrtek and Kozje in eastern Styria. Horse-riding, cycling and hiking are among the most important tourist activities in these areas.

Triglav National Park (Slovene: Triglavski narodni park) is a national park located in Slovenia. It was named after Mount Triglav, a national symbol of Slovenia. Triglav is situated almost in the middle of the national park. From it the valleys spread out radially, supplying water to two large river systems having their sources in the Julian Alps: the Soča and the Sava, flowing to the Adriatic and Black Sea, respectively.

The proposal for conservation dates back to the year 1908, and was realised in 1924. Then, on the initiative taken by the Nature Protection Section of the Slovene Museum Society together with the Slovene Mountaineering Society, a twenty-year lease was taken out on the Triglav Lakes Valley area, some 14 km². It was destined to become an Alpine Protection Park, however permanent conservation was not possible at that time. In 1961, after many years of effort, the protection was renewed (this time on a permanent basis) and somewhat enlarged, embracing around 20 km². The protected area was officially designated as Triglav National Park. Under this act, however, all objectives of a true national park were not attained and for this reason over the next two decades, new proposals for the extension and rearrangement of the protection were put forward. Finally, in 1981, a rearrangement was achieved and the park was given a new concept and enlarged to 838 km² – the area it continues to cover to this day.

The Karawank mountain range and the Kamnik Alps are also important tourist destinations, as are the Pohorje mountains. Unlike the Julian Alps, however, these areas seem to attract mostly Slovene visitors and visitor from the neighboring regions of Austria, and remain largely unknown to tourists from other countries. The biggest exception is the Logar Valley, which has been promoted heavily since the 1980s.

Slovenia has a number of smaller Medieval towns, which serve as important tourist attractions. Among them, the best known are Ptuj, Škofja Loka, and Piran. Fortified villages, mostly located in western Slovenia (Štanjel, Vipavski Križ, Šmartno), have become an important tourist destination, as well, especially due to the cultural events organized in their scenic environments.

<doc id="343114" wikidata="Q773090" url="?curid=343114" title="Tobal No. 1">
<text>is a 1996 fighting game developed by DreamFactory and published by Square for the PlayStation.

The game&#x27;s mechanics were designed with the aid of fighting game designer Seiichi Ishii, who previously contributed to &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; and &quot;Tekken&quot;, while all the characters were designed by Akira Toriyama. Packaged with both the North American and Japanese version of the game was a sampler disc featuring a pre-release playable demo of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and video previews of &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, &quot;Bushido Blade&quot;, and &quot;SaGa Frontier&quot;. 

&quot;Tobal No. 1&quot; received a mainly positive reception and was commercially popular in Japan. It was a cult hit in North America. The 1997 sequel, &quot;Tobal 2&quot;, was never released in North America and Europe.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Tobal No. 1&quot; has a tournament mode, two player versus mode, practice mode, and the unique quest mode, all of which utilize the same fighting system. The game runs at up to a smooth 60 frames per second due to its lack of textured polygons and reduced details which gave the game a distinctive look in comparison to other fighting games at the time. The game&#x27;s controls allow full freedom of movement in the ring as long as the player faces the opponent. The player has the ability to dash and jump, and certain buttons execute high, medium, and low attacks for each character. &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot; also has a grappling and blocking system, offering the player a variety of throws and counter moves.

The &quot;Quest Mode&quot; combines the game&#x27;s fighting controls with three-dimensional dungeon exploration. The player must advance down a number of floors, contend with traps, and engage in fights with a variety of enemies including the game&#x27;s playable characters. Several items can be found, dropped by enemies, or bought using crystals. These items can be picked up, consumed, or thrown at enemies, and include foodstuffs that can restore the player&#x27;s HP or potions that have a range of effects including raising the player&#x27;s maximum health or bringing it down to 1 point. There is no way to save one&#x27;s progress, and dying means starting over from the beginning. Defeating certain characters in this mode unlocks them as playable characters in the game&#x27;s other modes.

==Plot==
&quot;Tobal No. 1&quot; takes place in the year 2048 on a fictional planet called Tobal, which has large deposits of Molmoran, an ore that can be used as an energy source. The planet&#x27;s 98th tournament is held to determine who has the rights to the ore. A number of humans and aliens compete for the title. The game&#x27;s plot and character backstories are only explored in the instruction manual. All of the initial eight playable characters receive the same ending.

The game&#x27;s immediately playable characters include Chuji Wu, Oliems, Epon, Hom, Fei Pusu, Mary Ivonskaya, Ill Goga, and Gren Kutz. Bosses include Nork, Mufu, and the emperor Udan. All bosses are unlockable after defeating them in Dungeon Mode except Nork. Instead, the game allows the player to select Snork (Small Nork), a pint-sized version of the very large character. There is also one secret fighter named Toriyama Robo (named for Akira Toriyama) who is unlockable if the player can complete the 30-floor Udan&#x27;s Dungeon level in the quest mode. Toriyama Robo is not seen at any point in the game except at the very end of the dungeon.

==Development and release==
&quot;Tobal No. 1&quot; was developed by Japanese studio DreamFactory, which was established as a subsidiary of publisher Square to create that company&#x27;s first fighting game and its first release for the PlayStation. DreamFactory was founded in November 1995 and consisted of 17 members, all of whom had worked on other 3D polygonal fighting games. The company&#x27;s chairman and the director of &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot;, Seiichi Ishii, had himself helped pioneer 3D arcade fighting games as a designer on &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; for Sega and the first two &quot;Tekken&quot; titles for Namco. Toru Ikebuchi was the lead programmer on &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot;, a role he previously served on &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;. Square executive Hironobu Sakaguchi signed on as a supervisor.

The project was conceived by DreamFactory staff as a result of their dissatisfaction with the state of the fighting games and they wished to make their own with the features that they always wanted. Ishii felt that 3D fighting games at the time had not reached the caliber of their 2D counterparts and that additional features like a Quest Mode were needed to evolve the genre. As &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot; was designed specifically for the PlayStation rather than arcades, the Quest Mode was planned from the start with the single-player consumer in mind. Motion designer Masahiro Onoguchi said that while it was initially designed as a simple bonus, the Quest Mode grew in scale and complexity as it received more input from staff. Ishii commented that the user&#x27;s 360-degree control of a character in 3D environments is what best separates &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot; from its contemporaries. The interface was set up so that repeatedly pushing the attack buttons could yield visually-appealing combinations for new players. More experienced players could utilize the 3D arenas to perform grapples and throws from the side of or behind an opponent, something that was not seen in previous fighting games. The omission of blood in &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot; was intended to increase its appeal in foreign markets while its lack of texture mapping and subsequent use of Gouraud shading yielded superior display resolution, lighting, and frame rates over its competitors.

The characters of &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot; were designed by Akira Toriyama, best known for the manga series &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and other games such as the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series and Square&#x27;s own &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;. Square&#x27;s relationship with Toriyama was one in which the two parties had a single, initial meeting to discuss a game project and then the artist would submit his designs to the company sometime later. Prior to DreamFactory opening, Ishii desired to collaborate with Toriyama in order to utilize popular characters such as Trunks from &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. The team even proposed a fighting game using the cast of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, but Toriyama offered to create an original roster instead. He also contributed a basic story and world which were fleshed out by the developer. Toriyama illustrated the fighters so that they could be easily expressed in 3D and gave them body proportions so that their movements appeared natural. They were additionally given distinct physical attributes to account for a variety of situations like smaller characters defeating larger ones and matches against non-human opponents.

The boss Nork was not considered for being playable as his massive size ruined the game&#x27;s balance, so a small version (Snork) was used instead. The game originally only had two bosses as Mufu was one of the eight initially-selectable characters. Gren was created by Toriyama when Ishii requested a rival for Chuji. Once Gren joined the roster, Mufu was made into a boss. Chuji and Gren have the exact same age, height, and weight to reflect their rivalry. Varying degrees of motion capture were used for the character models. Although much of the data was taken from action film actors and martial artists, the robotic animation of Hom was captured directly from motion designer Hitoshi Matsuda. Onoguchi explained that the team preferred the slower, more predictable attack movements of the actors over the martial artists, which were too fast to translate well to the game&#x27;s mechanics.

Square released &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot; in Japan on August 2, 1996. It was the first game made available from the publisher&#x27;s DigiCube label for Japanese convenience stores. Sony Computer Entertainment picked up the distribution rights for the international release. Due to its stark contrast in graphics to other fighting games and because Toriyama&#x27;s art style was not yet as well recognized outside Japan, Ishii said that there were plans to alter the game&#x27;s characters &quot;so it had a different feel and look to it&quot; for the overseas localization. However, that there was no time to make the changes. &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot; launched in North America on October 31, 1996 and in Europe on January 10, 1997. All versions of the game were packaged with an extra disc containing a playable demo of Square&#x27;s PlayStation role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, a title that was highly anticipated at the time. The disc also had video previews of other upcoming Square releases for the console including &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, &quot;Bushido Blade&quot;, and &quot;SaGa Frontier&quot;.

===Music===
The music in &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot; was composed by eight of Square&#x27;s composers: Yasunori Mitsuda, Yasuhiro Kawakami, Ryuji Sasai, Masashi Hamauzu, Junya Nakano, Kenji Ito, Noriko Matsueda, and Yoko Shimomura. Music production and synth programming was handled by Mitsuda, while arrangement work was handled by GUIDO (Hidenobu Otsuki and Hiroshi Hata), with a few tracks being composed and arranged by Mitsuda and GUIDO together. The trio closely worked together for a month in a studio creating final arrangements.

Unlike the common themes of techno and rock found in other fighting games, &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot; contains a complete mixture of sound, varying instrumental and electronic music, with styles ranging in hip hop, ambient, 1980s groove, jazz, and Latino, attributed to the diversity of the composers&#x27; styles. Mitsuda feels that GUIDO&#x27;s arrangements helped to bring a sense of totality to otherwise disparate songs. The soundtrack was released by DigiCube in Japan on August 21, 1996 and contains 21 tracks found in the game, including one unreleased track. The album was arranged by GUIDO, who later released their own 7-track remix disc, &quot;Tobal No. 1 Remixes Electrical Indian&quot;.

==Reception==
Upon release in Japan, &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot; topped the Japanese sales charts. &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot; became the ninth best-selling home video game of 1996 in Japan, where it sold 752,000 copies that year. The strong sales have been attributed to the inclusion of the &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; demo disc, a highly anticipated title at the time. The game is cited as a cult hit in North America, where it did not sell as well. It sold 99,183 copies in the United States, bringing total sales to copies in Japan and the United States.

The game received mostly positive reviews. &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine gave a score of 31 out of 40. A &quot;Next Generation&quot; critic said that it &quot;establishes itself as a major player in an established genre ... with its innovative gameplay and unique graphic approach.&quot; He especially praised the control interface, the deep counter system, the unrestricted 3D movement, and the intuitive controls for all of these elements. His one criticism was that the opponent AI is too simplistic to make single-player anywhere near as enjoyable as the multiplayer mode. Bruised Lee of &quot;GamePro&quot; was less enthusiastic about the controls, saying they take time to master. He concluded the game is outclassed by competition such as &quot;Tekken 2&quot; and &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot;, but is still worth trying due to its unique style of animation and quest mode. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; also said the controls take getting used to, but highly praised the animation and 3D gameplay. They regarded the battle mode as the highlight but said the quest mode and &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; demo were nice bonuses which add to the game&#x27;s value-for-money. IGN noted the game&#x27;s unique graphical representation and free-ranging controls—it ran at 60 frames per second and in 640x480 resolution. &quot;GameSpot&quot; admired the variety of fighting styles in the game&#x27;s normal mode, but found the same controls worked sluggishly in the unique Quest Mode. Game Revolution found the blocking system to be confusing but called the game&#x27;s quest mode the &quot;most innovative feature since—well, bosses.&quot;

==Sequel==
The game&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Tobal 2&quot;, was released in 1997 for the PlayStation in Japan. A mobile phone version, titled &quot;Tobal M&quot;, was released in Japan on December 12, 2007.

== Life ==
Gladys Mary Baldwin was born in Diss, Norfolk, the daughter of the Reverend Daniel Baldwin, who was a Congregationalist minister. She attended boarding school at Milton Mount College near Crawley, leaving aged 16 to attend a secretarial course for two years. She was employed as a stenographer at Lever Brothers in Port Sunlight before marrying Harold Wilson on New Year&#x27;s Day 1940 at Mansfield College, Oxford. Baldwin and Wilson had two sons, Robin (born 1943) and Giles (born 1948).

In 1970, her volume of poetry &quot;Selected Poems&quot; was published, and, in 1976, Mary Wilson was one of three judges of the Booker Prize, the other judges being Walter Allen and Francis King. According to the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; entry for Harold Wilson, written by Roy Jenkins, Wilson was not satisfied with life in politics. It was this detachment which gave the &quot;Private Eye&quot; spoof &quot;Mrs Wilson&#x27;s Diary&quot;, the supposed diary of Wilson, written in the style of the BBC&#x27;s daily radio serial &quot;Mrs Dale&#x27;s Diary&quot;, a spurious look of authenticity.

Politically, she opposed her husband in the 1975 European Communities membership referendum by voting against continued membership and in her support for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.

Wilson was widowed on 24 May 1995 when her husband died of colorectal cancer and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease after ten years of illness. They were married for 55 years. She continued to live in Westminster, a short distance from Downing Street. She retained the couple&#x27;s holiday home in the Isles of Scilly.

In 2010, at the age of 94, she attended the funeral of Michael Foot. Three years later, at the age of 97, she accepted an invitation to the funeral of Margaret Thatcher.

==Death==
Wilson died after a stroke at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in London on 6 June 2018, at the age of 102, having outlived her husband by 23 years. The longest-lived spouse of a British prime minister, she was the first to live beyond the age of 100 years. A private service followed by cremation took place on mainland Britain, and her ashes were buried with her husband at Old Town Churchyard in St Mary&#x27;s, Isles of Scilly.

<text>In number theory, sexy primes are prime numbers that differ from each other by . For example, the numbers and are a pair of sexy primes, because both are prime and formula_1.

The term &quot;sexy prime&quot; is a pun stemming from the Latin word for six: .

If or (where is the lower prime) is also prime, then the sexy prime is part of a prime triplet. In August 2014, the Polymath group, seeking the proof of the twin prime conjecture, showed that if the generalized Elliott–Halberstam conjecture is proven, one can show the existence of infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by at most 6 and as such they are either twin, cousin or sexy primes.

The sexy primes (sequences and in OEIS) below 500 are:

<text>A hand tool is any tool that is powered by hand rather than a motor. Categories of hand tools include wrenches, pliers, cutters, files, striking tools, struck or hammered tools, screwdrivers, vises, clamps, snips, hacksaws, drills, and knives.

Outdoor tools such as garden forks, pruning shears, and rakes are additional forms of hand tools. Portable power tools are not hand tools.

==History==
Hand tools have been used by humans since the Stone Age, when stone tools were used for hammering and cutting. During the Bronze Age, tools were made by casting alloys of copper and tin. Bronze tools were sharper and harder than those made of stone. During the Iron Age iron replaced bronze, and tools became even stronger and more durable. The Romans developed tools during this period which are similar to those being produced today. After the Industrial Revolution, most tools were made in factories rather than by craftspeople.

A large collection of British hand tools dating from 1700 to 1950 is held by St Albans Museum. Most of the tools were collected by Raphael Salaman (1906–1993), who wrote two classic works on the subject: &quot;Dictionary of Woodworking Tools&quot; and &quot;Dictionary of Leather-working Tools&quot;. David Russell&#x27;s vast collection of Western hand tools from the Stone Age to the twentieth century led to the publication of his book &quot;Antique Woodworking Tools&quot;.

==General categories==
The American Industrial Hygiene Association gives the following categories of hand tools: wrenches, pliers, cutters, striking tools, struck or hammered tools, screwdrivers, vises, clamps, snips, saws, drills and knives.

<doc id="343121" wikidata="Q1337703" url="?curid=343121" title="Matlock, Derbyshire">
<text>Matlock is the county town of Derbyshire, England. It is in the south-eastern part of the Peak District, with the National Park directly to the west. The spa resort of Matlock Bath is immediately south of the town as well as Cromford lying further south still. The civil parish of Matlock Town had a population in the 2021 UK census of 10,000.

Matlock is south-west of Chesterfield and in close reach of the cities of Derby (19 miles), Sheffield (20 miles) and Nottingham (29 miles). Matlock is within the Derbyshire Dales district and is the headquarters of Derbyshire County Council.

==History==
The name Matlock derives from the Old English &quot;mæthel&quot; (or &quot;mæðel&quot;), meaning assembly or speech, and &quot;āc&quot;, meaning oak tree; thus Matlock means &#x27;moot-oak&#x27;, an oak tree where meetings are held. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as &quot;Meslach&quot; and in 1196 it was named &quot;Matlac&quot;. It is a former spa town that lies on the River Derwent, and has prospered from both the hydrotherapy industry and the cloth mills constructed on the river and its tributary Bentley Brook.

It was a collection of villages in Wirksworth Hundred – composed of Matlock Town, Matlock Green, Matlock Bridge, Matlock Bank – until thermal springs were discovered in 1698. The population increased rapidly in the 1800s, largely because of the popular hydros that were being built. At one stage there were around twenty hydros, mostly on Matlock Bank, the largest built in 1853 by John Smedley. This closed in 1955, and re-opened in 1956 as the headquarters of the Derbyshire County Council. Matlock is also home to the Derbyshire Dales District Council as well as Matlock Town council.

==Governance==
Matlock has a town council, the urban equivent of the rural parish council and the lowest tier of local government. The Council meets twice a month. There are 11 Councillors who cover the area and 9 members of staff. Matlock Town Council&#x27;s jurisdiction extends to the town centre, Matlock Bank, Hurst Farm, Matlock Green, Matlock Town, Starkholmes and Riber.

The second tier of local government is Derbyshire Dales District Council, which covers almost a third of the mainly rural parts of the county, including the towns of Matlock, Ashbourne, Bakewell, Wirksworth and Darley Dale and over 100 villages. The council has 39 District Councillors elected in 25 wards. Matlock is represented by six councillors in the two wards: Matlock All Saints and Matlock St Giles.

The top tier of local government is Derbyshire County Council, which has responsibilities for the whole of Derbyshire apart from the City of Derby. Matlock is represented by one county councillor (out of 64 councillors in total).

The main offices of all three tiers of local government are sited in Matlock. The Town Council is housed in the Imperial Rooms close to the bottom of Bank Road, the District Council is halfway up Bank Road and the County Council is at the top.

As regards national democracy, Matlock forms part of the parliamentary constituency of Derbyshire Dales. The MP is currently John Whitby, who was elected in the 2024 General Election.

==Geography==

===Natural physical features===
The main physical features of the Matlock area are the hills and watercourses. The height of the town (above mean level) varies from 91m at Causeway Lane (in the valley bottom) to 203m at the top of Wellington Street. Matlock is overlooked by Riber Castle at 260m from the south-east and by Masson Hill at 339m from the south-west. The first human settlement in the area was in what is now known as Old Matlock or Matlock Green. This was where the Bentley Brook joined the River Derwent. When the town grew in the late 19th century, the town spread up the steep hillsides to the north-east of the narrow valley bottom.

Various industries made use of the natural features:
* The underlying bedrock was quarried and mined.
* The watercourses were harnessed to power corn mills, cloth mills, and other mills.
* The hillside thermal spring water gave rise to the hydros.
The natural features also constrained transport links:
* In the Derwent gorge below High Tor, the present-day A6 (Dale Road) was squeezed in beside the river.
* From the south, the Midland Railway reached Matlock Station via a series of short tunnels constructed under the limestone of the gorge.
* A cable tramway was constructed to tackle the very steep Bank Road (see above).

===Geology===

The geology of the Matlock area is extremely complex. Broadly speaking, the Derwent valley bottom forms a boundary between the sandstones and gritstones of the Dark Peak to the north-east and the limestones of the White Peak to the south-west. There are igneous intrusions into the limestones to the south-west.
This geology has been exploited by the quarrying and mining industries. The sandstones and gritstones have been quarried as building materials (e.g. at Bentley Brook Quarries) and the limestones for building materials and the manufacture of lime (e.g. at Harvey Dale Quarries). The igneous intrusions gave rise to valuable minerals which have been mined (e.g. in the Bonsall area), particularly for lead. A very rare lead halide mineral called Matlockite was first discovered at nearby Bage Mine in the early 1800s, and is named after the town.

The route of the River Derwent downstream (south) of Matlock is especially interesting to geologists in that it has cut its way through a limestone gorge below High Tor (120m above river level), rather than follow the &quot;simpler&quot; way to the east. It is thought that landslips and/or glaciation may have had an influence over how the present route of the river was established.

===Nearby places===
===The Dimple===
The area on the western edge of the town, bounded on the north and east by Old Hackney Lane, Hurds Hollow, and Dimple Road, and on the south by Bakewell Road, is named as Dimple, on the Ordnance Survey map.

===Flooding===
The Derwent has occasionally flooded, including during November 2019 when large areas of England were affected. This flood in particular claimed one life: that of Matlock&#x27;s former high sheriff, Annie Hall, who was swept away by the water and subsequently drowned, aged 69. This flood also caused damage to many of Matlock&#x27;s businesses, including the local Wetherspoons, which was forced to close due to the damages and later reopened as Ostello Lounge, part of the Lounges group, in March 2022.

===Railways===
National Rail services run generally hourly each way between Matlock and Derby on the Derwent Valley Line, operated by East Midlands Railway.

====History====
In 1849, the railway came to Matlock. Matlock railway station was opened on the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway, later the Midland line between London and Manchester, until the section between Matlock and Buxton was closed in 1968 following the Beeching cuts. Network Rail has considered re-opening the line, with a study carried out by the county council; although it proved to be unfeasible in the short term, the track bed will be kept free of development as the study showed that the line could be economically viable from around 2025. The section from Wye Dale (about east of Buxton) to Coombs viaduct, a point about a mile south-east of Bakewell, has now become the Monsal Trail, an walking and cycle trail.

====Heritage====
Peak Rail, a preserved railway, runs steam trains on a section of the closed line between Matlock, Darley Dale and Rowsley. Previously it used its own station, Matlock Riverside, a short distance to the north of the mainline station; however, from 2011, both Peak Rail and trains on the Derwent Valley Line share the same station.
===Buses===
The town is well served by bus routes, operated by High Peak Buses, Hulleys of Baslow and Stagecoach Yorkshire.

===Roads===
The A6, which links Carlisle with Luton, passes through the town; it provides access to Manchester, Stockport, Buxton, Bakewell and Derby.

===Bank Road Tram===
In 1893, Matlock Cable Tramway was built up Bank Road from Crown Square at Matlock Bridge to Wellington Street (at the top of Bank Road) with a stop halfway up at Smedley Street where Smedley&#x27;s Hydro (built by John Smedley) was situated. Conceived by Job Smith, the tram was inspired by San Francisco&#x27;s famous cable cars and cost £20,000. When it was built, it was the steepest tramway in the world at a gradient of 1 in 5½ and it rose . The fare was tuppence up and one penny down. It closed in 1927, after losing business to cars and buses.

==Hall Leys Park==

Hall Leys Park is a Victorian public park in the centre of Matlock, Derbyshire which opened in 1898. It lies between the River Derwent to the south and Causeway Lane to the north. The park has many facilities and in 2004–2005 underwent major regeneration as part of the Matlock Parks Project with funding from the Millennium Commission.

At the Crown Square/Matlock Bridge end of the park there is the town&#x27;s war memorial and a wishing well. Beside this there is the shelter from the former cable tramway which was moved to the park when the tramway ceased to operate in 1927.

Moving away from Crown Square there is, next, a large grass area and some tennis courts. As part of the refurbishments which took place, the old grass tennis courts were replaced with a skateboard park.

In the centre of the park is the Victorian bandstand, which is used regularly in the summer months by local brass bands and for events such as the annual Matlock Victorian Christmas Weekend, held on the first weekend of December. Beside the bandstand is a footbridge over the Derwent that has markings indicating the height of several floods that hit the town in the 1960s and 1970s. The café, on the opposite side of the bandstand, has similar markings for other floods.

Hall Leys Park is now a central part of the town&#x27;s flood protection. The wall which surrounds the northern side of the park has the ability to have the footways sealed with sheets of wood which would dam the progress of any overflow from the river and turn the entire park into a large reservoir. Further down the park there is a putting green and a Crown Green Bowls green. A boating lake, with several small islands, is home to a large number of birds, including ducks and moorhens as well as being host to the longest-running pleasure boats in the country. A miniature railway runs half the length of the park along the river but, because of the lack of any turning space, the return journey is made in reverse. At the far end of the park is a children&#x27;s playground, which was significantly upgraded in 2005.

Hall Leys Park is occasionally the site for visiting &quot;Continental Markets&quot; and, since the summer of 2006, regular &quot;Farmers&#x27; Markets&quot;. It is also the centre of the Matlock Victorian Christmas Weekend, held annually on the first weekend of December.

==Bank Road==

Bank Road runs from Crown Square up Matlock Bank, a steep hill which gives the road its name, to Wellington Street. Although many consider the whole incline to be Bank Road, just over halfway up beyond Smedley Street the road is called Rutland Street.
Bank Road has many local landmark buildings along it – from the bottom of the hill (Crown Square) travelling north:

*The Crown Hotel – the original site of the hotel which gave its name to Crown Square is now a building society office. This was built prior to 1899. The Crown is now a Wetherspoon&#x27;s pub just along Bakewell Road.
*Crown Buildings, opposite the original Crown Hotel at the bottom of Bank Road, was built in 1889 and currently houses a café on its ground floor.
*Post Office and Sorting Office. These were built prior to 1922.
*Police Station – built after the second world war.

*Matlock Town Hall – formerly Bridge House. In 1894 the Matlock Urban District Council bought Bridge House for use as the town hall and added a large wing in the Italianate style to house an assembly room etc. It was reopened in 1898 and also housed most local authority undertakings, magistrates courts, etc. Following local government reorganisation in 1974, the Town Hall became the headquarters of West Derbyshire District Council (which later changed its name to Derbyshire Dales District Council).
*Our Lady &amp; St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church – built in 1883 with a presbytery added in 1896. The church was described as a &#x27;mission&#x27;, established under St Mary&#x27;s of Derby. A church hall was built alongside in the 1990s.

*Youth Hostel – a YHA youth hostel – Built in 1882 as Smedley Memorial Hospital. There is a later (Hunter) wing with a datestone of 1897 set further back from the road. The Youth Hostel opened in 1983 and closed on 30 September 2007.
*Matlock Methodist &amp; United Reformed Church – originally Matlock Wesleyan Chapel, and later the Trinity Methodist Church. The church was designed by C.O. Ellison of Liverpool, with additions designed by Horace G. Bradley. The neo-gothic church was originally built in 1882 without the slender steeple, which is now a landmark feature reaching above the roofs of neighbouring buildings, and, from higher levels, an elegant feature against the backdrop of the hills beyond. The Manse was built at the west of the site, fronting New Street.
*Old Sunday School which is now private homes.
*Old Methodist Church – the Primitive Methodist congregation was founded in 1838, although the current church on Bank Road, opposite the entrance to County Hall, was rebuilt in 1856 and the adjacent School Room below was added in 1878. Until recently, the Old Methodist Church housed the Matlock Wurlitzer.

*County Hall – formerly Smedley&#x27;s Hydro, is a grade II listed building which dominates Matlock Bank. The earliest (western) section seen today was built in by Smedley. Much of today&#x27;s building was added after Smedley&#x27;s death in 1874. The first phase, in 1881, included the entrance hall and staircase, now in the middle section. In 1886, the eastern section was added by architect George Statham of Nottingham. Later extensions include the tall chimney, impressive for its height on the already prominent site, along with boiler house and bath in 1894. The domed glass Winter Gardens, which housed a ballroom, and the northern block on the other side of Smedley Street were added in 1901. The northern block was linked by the unusual two-storey bridge over Smedley Street. 
*Smedley Street traverses Bank Road. It has its own parade of shops and a post office (now closed). The east end of Smedley Street (known as Smedley Street East) is home to Laser Rail, a designer and manufacturer of rail measurement equipment now incorporated into Balfour Beatty&#x27;s rail division. At the west end is All Saints&#x27; Church, Matlock Bank.

*The Gate public house – There were known to have been numerous public houses on Matlock Bank, thought to have been the result of the ban on alcohol consumption within the hydros themselves, especially at Smedley&#x27;s. The whereabouts of many is no longer known. The Gate (dated 1869) was one of these, and still stands on the corner of Smedley Street and Bank Road, opposite Smedley&#x27;s. It now functions as an arts venue known as Designate at the Gate.

&quot;NB. Beyond Smedley Street, Bank Road is actually Rutland Street.&quot;
*Rutland Court – the former Matlock House Hydro stands prominently on the east side of Rutland Street. The hydro was built in 1863 and an engraving of 1870 shows that the main block, at least that which is visible from the roadside today, is largely unaltered.
*Elmtree House – a former hydro, now 70–74 Rutland Street, was opened in 1862. It is just north of the dominant Matlock House (now Rutland Court).
*The Old Tram Depot which is now a garage and car repair centre. The garage maintains the name Matlock Green Garage, although it has not been situated at Matlock Green for many years.

*Rockside Hydro – an imposing building with views across Matlock, is a grade II listed building, on higher ground above Smedley&#x27;s and is distinctive for its two octagonal corner turrets with conical roofs topped by lanterns. Rockside was built circa 1860, but extended significantly by the firm of architects Parker and Unwin between 1901 and 1905, The building was also extended later in 1923 and 1928. An upper floor glazed conservatory with a glazed curved roof was added in , and a block was added on Cavendish Road in 1928. It probably is not so well known that during the Second World War, Rockside Hall was used as an RAF psychiatric hospital, where mentally-scarred service personnel (mostly aircrew) were rehabilitated. It was somewhat unkindly known as &quot;Hatters Castle&quot; by locals.

==Dale Road==
Dale Road runs all the way from Matlock Bridge (road bridge over the River Derwent) to North Parade in Matlock Bath. It forms part of the Derby to Manchester road (A6) and has very many bends.
Dale Road, like Bank Road (see previous section), contains a large number of examples of Victorian architecture, although only four are listed by English Heritage. However, all buildings on Dale Road are included in two conservation areas created by Derbyshire Dales District Council. These conservation areas are called &quot;Matlock Bridge&quot; (from the bridge over the Derwent to the railway bridge over Dale Road), then &quot;Matlock Dale&quot; to the outskirts of Matlock Bath.
In this section, the main features of Dale Road are described, starting at Matlock Bridge and then proceeding in a southerly direction until the High Tor Hotel.

*Railway Station and Station House – The railway station and the nearby station house were both designed by Joseph Paxton around 1850, as part of the building of the Midland Railway&#x27;s Derby to Buxton route. The station house, being largely unaltered since being built, is listed Grade II by English Heritage, but the station itself is unlisted.
*Matlock Bridge – This is the road crossing of the River Derwent. The first stone bridge was constructed over or close to the site of a ford in the mid 13th century. It was only a single carriageway in width and remained so for 550 years. In the 1890s there were discussions regarding the need for a wider bridge to be able to cope with the increasing road traffic. A new bridge was proposed which would have involved the demolition of the existing. However, a decision was taken to double the width of the existing bridge. This work was undertaken in 1903–1904. The bridge was made one-way to vehicular traffic at time of building of the access road to the superstore in Cawdor Quarry in 2007. The bridge is listed as Grade II* by English Heritage.
*RBS Bank (now closed) – There is a pedestrian access to this bank from Dale Road, although its postal address is Snitterton Road. This a building that has seen several changes of occupancy. In recent times, it has been offices for the Derbyshire Stone Company, then bank premises for William Deacons, then Williams &amp; Glyn, then Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). This stone building was originally built in the late 18th century and is listed as Grade II by English Heritage.
*Queens Head Inn – The building currently on the corner of the junction of Holt Lane with Dale Road dates from the late 19th century. At that time it was the Queens Head Inn, although it has now been converted to shops. Along with the Market Hall (see below), this was one of the earliest buildings to be constructed at this (north) end of Dale Road.
*HSBC Bank (now closed) – This building is on the east side of Dale Road (No 5) and has an eye-catching clock. There is a record that Henry Barnwell and his son Harry moved from Birmingham and established a watchmaker and jewellery business there in 1876. Their corner shop became &quot;London City and Midland Bank&quot; which later became just &quot;Midland Bank&quot; which then became HSBC. The HSBC bank closed in June 2015.
*NatWest Bank (now closed) – This building of 1901 is on the east side of Dale Road (No 19). This is one of the few buildings on Dale Road that has a brick frontage (although several that have a stone frontage do use brick for the sides and rear).
*Market Hall – This building is on the west side of Dale Road (Nos 4,6,8,10) just south of the Queens Head Inn. The Market Hall was constructed in 1867–68. The ground floor was used as a general market house with 12 shop units while the upper floor was used for assemblies, public meetings and entertainments. The architectural style chosen for this was that of the then-popular Gothic Revival. The building was also an important source of civic pride, designed to impress and sporting a row of carved heraldic shields across its façade. The Market Hall is now a row of shops and offices.
*Olde Englishe Hotel – This large building is on the east side of Dale Road (No 77). Its &quot;old English&quot; timber frames, spire-like turret and corner position give it a striking appearance in a street-scene of predominantly darker-stone buildings. The building closed as a hotel in 2009, and has been converted into bars and shops.
*Lime – This building is on the east side of Dale Road (No 79) and complements the Olde Englishe Hotel which it faces across the road junction. It has a distinctive cupola above its entrance. The building has had a variety of uses, from grocery shop, to antiques sales to hair salon.
*Evans Jeweller – Evans Jewellers Shop at Nos 93–95 Dale Road, with its projecting clock, can be regarded as the focal point of that part of the east side of Dale Road between its junctions with Olde Englishe Road and Holt Lane. W. Evans &amp; Son has traded from these premises continuously since it was first established in 1893.
*Holt Terrace – This is a five-house terrace that looks down on the southern junction of Holt Lane with Dale Road. It lies just north of the railway crossing of Dale Road and the River Derwent. Holt Lane was the &quot;main road&quot; along the valley until the Midland Railway opened in 1849. Soon after then, the Dale Road area was developed and Dale Road relegated Holt Lane to a side street.
*John Hadfield House – This is a post-WWII building on the west side of Dale Road immediately south of the railway bridge. It was built in the former Harveydale limestone quarry as the headquarters of Derbyshire Stone Ltd and named after a leading figure in the company. Derbyshire Stone was ultimately absorbed into Tarmac Ltd in 1968, whose Matlock office was subsequently closed. John Hadfield House is now occupied by offices of the Derbyshire County Council.
*The Boat House – This pub (now closed) is next to John Hadfield House on the west side of Dale Road. The pub was built in the early 19th century and is listed Grade II by English Heritage. It takes its name from a small ferry which once linked Matlock Dale to Matlock Green. The ferry was replaced by a footbridge in 1872.
*Footbridge to Pic Tor – This footbridge on the east side of Dale Road replaced a ferry at this point in 1872. The present iron bridge, erected in 1922, was refurbished in 2005. The bridge provides access from this part of Dale Road to Starkholmes Road, Pic Tor, High Tor, Hall Leys Park and Matlock Green.
*Artists Corner – This is a collection of houses in the valley bottom built along the west side of a sharp bend on Dale Road. It has been a favoured spot through the centuries for artists to come to admire the scenery and either draw or paint High Tor, which overlooks it from the south. It is overlooked on the north side by St Johns Road with its Grade II* listed Baptist Chapel. Artists Corner was also the location of a toll house on the Wirksworth-Moor-to-Longstone Turnpike (opened 1759).
*High Tor Hotel – This building, squeezed into the valley bottom below High Tor, was built in the early 19th century by Colonel Edward Payne. It was originally known as Tor Cottage and has had a variety of uses since then, including being a private home, lodging house, guest house, hotel and school (Matlock Modern School). As at August 2015, it is called High Tor Hotel and Artists Corner Restaurant and claims to be &quot;a modern boutique hotel&quot;.
==Sport==
Matlock is home to Matlock Town Football Club, playing in the Northern Premier League Premier Division at their Causeway Lane ground.

Matlock is also home to Matlock and Cromford Meadows Cricket Club playing next to the football ground, and Matlock and District Swimming Club (also known as MAD Swimming) which trained and competed in the nearby old Matlock Lido before it closed in August 2011 with subsequent events transferred to the Arc complex. Matlock Cycling Club has helped to produce a number of national and international status riders including Tim Gould, Olympian Mountain Biker Annie Last and has a popular youth section.

Matlock&#x27;s rugby team play their home matches at nearby Cromford Meadows. They run 3 senior teams and the 1st XV compete at Level 6 in the RFU league structure. Matlock Rugby Club also has a thriving minis and junior section with over 250 members all supported by fully qualified mini and junior coaches. In 2007 the club was awarded the Derbyshire Tigger Price Memorial trophy for the team of the year award.

On the outskirts of Matlock off the A6 Bakewell Road, a new multi-use leisure centre and swimming facility was opened in 2011 known as &quot;Arc Leisure Matlock&quot;. It was opened officially by Lord Sebastian Coe.

==Education and arts==
The annual arts festival Matlock Live began takes place in June or July each year featuring local musicians, dancers, artists, etc. As part of the summer event, Matlock Live invites buskers and other street performers to form a busking trail around Matlock raising money for the charity &quot;Aquabox&quot;. Matlock Music present a series of public concerts at Highfields School (Upper Lumsdale site). Storytelling is also well represented with a monthly venue at the Imperial Rooms.

===Education history===
The first school in Matlock was founded in 1647 as a free school for local boys, originally funded by local George Spateman of Tansley and from 1668 by Anthony Wolley. This school was rebuilt in 1829 and expanded in 1860 and 1889 and girls first attended in 1816. This school has since been demolished (the date is unknown).

Another school, All Saints Primary School, was founded in 1875 to provide for the population of the newly developed Matlock Bank. This school still operates and is the biggest primary school in Matlock. In 1897, a third school, the Council School, was constructed on Matlock Bank, at the junction of Smedley Street and Chesterfield Road. It also still operates as Castle View Primary School.

Before Highfields School was founded in 1982, when the tripartite education system in Matlock ended, there were two secondary schools in Matlock; Charles White Secondary Modern School (founded in 1956, and named after two local MPs, father and son, the latter of who died in 1956) and Ernest Bailey&#x27;s Grammar School (founded in 1924 and named after its wealthy founder).

As a Grammar school, Bailey&#x27;s accepted students whose parents paid or who gained scholarships (by passing the Eleven plus exam) until fees were phased out, leaving scholarship as the only means of entry. Those who didn&#x27;t attain a scholarship attended Charles White – it is estimated that Charles White students outnumbered Bailey&#x27;s students 3:1. White had been built especially by Derbyshire County Council to accommodate the children who couldn&#x27;t attend Bailey&#x27;s.

The two schools were merged to create Highfields, a comprehensive school. The site of Charles White in Starkholmes became the &#x27;lower site&#x27; of Highfields for years 7–8, while Bailey&#x27;s was converted to the county council records offices. A new site was built to house the new &#x27;upper site&#x27; at Lumsdale for years 9–13.

==The town centre development==

For over 10 years, the council had proposed to allow a Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket to be built in Cawdor Quarry, a disused quarry next to the railway station. In early 2007 building work started and it opened 4 October 2007. A new access road with its own bridge over the River Derwent allows the A6 to bypass the town centre. The old bridge is restricted to one-way traffic (out of town) and allows pedestrian access from the town centre to the train station, a newly built bus station and the supermarket. Several bus routes continue to serve only the old bus station on Bakewell Road, making Matlock one of the smallest towns in Britain to have two bus stations.

In 2010, Crown Square was updated with the replacement of pavements and street furniture intended to provide a look more appropriate to a conservation area; the old tarmac pavements and traffic island were rebuilt in local sandstone, barriers were replaced with heritage bollards and all street lights replaced. Bakewell Road and Firs Parade were not included in this phase as they are just off Crown Square, and along with Imperial Road they are yet to be redeveloped.

==Matlock on film and television==

*&quot;Coming Down the Mountain&quot;, The BBC drama was set partly in Matlock although nothing was filmed there.
*&quot;Women in Love&quot;, Ken Russell&#x27;s Oscar winning 1969 film, uses a house at the top of New Street (No. 80) as the home of the Brangwen sisters, Gudrun and Ursula. The house is currently a B&amp;B. St Giles&#x27; Church in Church Street was the setting for the wedding of Laura Crich.
* A music video of Libera (&quot;Salva Me&quot;, 1997) in a rock formation in Matlock Cave.
*&quot;Peak Practice&quot;, the ITV series, used locations in Matlock, including Highfields School, Victoria Hall Gardens and Henry Avenue, although the main village location is Crich and nearby Fritchley.

==Matlock in literature==
Karl Philipp Moritz in his &quot;Journeys of a German in England in 1782&quot; describes Matlock as follows:
Travelling from Matlock Bath and via the Matlock Bridge you arrive in the small town of Matlock proper, a place hardly worth being called a village, as it is made up of very few, shoddy houses.
Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poetical illustration &quot;Matlock&quot;, to an engraving of a painting by Thomas Allom, is subtitled &quot;To the memory of a favourite child (the daughter of a friend) who died there&quot;. It was published in &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book&quot;, 1839.

William Berry&#x27;s poem &quot;Matlock&quot; appeared in his collection &quot;A Victim to Glamour: And Other Poems&quot;. Leeds: T. Barmby, 1874.

<text>Matlock Bath is a village and civil parish in Derbyshire, England. It lies in the Derbyshire Dales, south of Matlock on the main A6 road, and approximately halfway between Buxton and Derby. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 753. Originally built at the head of a dead-end dirt road running along the valley of the River Derwent from Matlock, the settlement developed in the 19th century as residential and a spa town which remains a tourist destination. The steep hillside restricts development, with most buildings on one side of the valley and only footbridges across the river. The road was upgraded, becoming a through-way, now designated A6, avoiding the previous coaching road approach to Matlock from Cromford over very steep hills near to the Riber plateau area.

Matlock Dale is a hamlet about north of the village, and the term also refers to this stretch of the river valley.

==History==
In 1698, warm springs were discovered and a bath house was built. As the waters became better known, access was improved by building the bridge into Old Matlock and in 1783, the opening of a new entrance at the south of the valley. Princess Victoria of Kent&#x27;s royal visit in 1832 confirmed Matlock as a society venue of the time. Victoria&#x27;s party visited a pair of museums and a petrifying well. John Ruskin and Lord Byron were visitors, Byron comparing it with alpine Switzerland, leading to a nickname of &quot;Little Switzerland&quot;. Erasmus Darwin recommended the area to Josiah Wedgwood I for its beauty and soothing waters, and members of the families vacationed and settled there. Edward Levett Darwin, son of Francis Sacheverel Darwin, lived at Dale House in Matlock Bath, where he was a solicitor.

When the North Midland Railway opened in 1840, carriages plied for hire from Ambergate station. The Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway ran a number of excursions, taking the passengers onward from Ambergate by the Cromford Canal.

Matlock Bath is a designated conservation area with an Article 4 direction in relation to properties, predominantly along North and South Parade.

==Government==
Matlock Bath is in the local government district of Derbyshire Dales, and is part of the parliamentary constituency of the same name. The Member of Parliament is John Whitby of the Labour Party.

==Tourism==
Matlock Bath has attractions including the Heights of Abraham park, Gulliver&#x27;s Kingdom theme park, the Peak District Lead Mining Museum, the former Life in a Lens Museum of Photography &amp; Old Times, the Grand Pavilion, Derwent Gardens, Lovers&#x27; Walks and an aquarium.

On the opposite bank of the river Derwent stands High Tor, a sheer cliff used by climbers and walkers. High Tor features Giddy Edge, a narrow winding path along the cliff edge. The Heights of Abraham cable cars link the base of High Tor rising to the Heights of Abraham.

In autumn of each year, the &quot;Venetian Nights&quot; are held with illuminations along the river and illuminated boats.

On Sundays in summer many hundreds of motorcyclists congregate in the town.

==Popular culture references==
Andrew Asibong&#x27;s phantasmagorical novel &quot;Mameluke Bath&quot; is set in a futuristic version of Matlock Bath, and Eleanor Bowen-Jones&#x27; film &quot;Return to Mameluke Bath&quot; explores both real and fictional versions of the town.

Each year the Parish Council organises Pro Loco events in the area. There are pro loco art and photography competitions which are free to enter.

The village is mentioned in the Half Man Half Biscuit song &quot;The Light at the End of the Tunnel (Is the Light of an Oncoming Train)&quot;.

==Transport==

===Railway===
Matlock Bath railway station was built in 1849 on the Midland Railway line between London and Manchester. The section from Matlock to Buxton was closed in 1968, as result of the Beeching cuts.

Today, trains run generally hourly each way between Matlock and Derby on the Derwent Valley Line, operated by East Midlands Railway.

===Roads===

<text>The flag of New Brunswick () consists of a golden lion passant on a red field in the upper third and a gold field defaced with a lymphad on top of blue and white wavy lines in the bottom two-thirds. Adopted in 1965 shortly after the new national flag was inaugurated, it has been the flag of the Canadian province since February 24 of that year. It is a banner of arms modelled after the province&#x27;s coat of arms.

==History==

New Brunswick acquiesced to a federation with the other colonies of Nova Scotia and the United Province of Canada in 1867 under the &quot;British North America Act&quot; to form the Dominion of Canada. A year later, Queen Victoria issued a Royal Warrant on May 26 allowing the new province to use its own coat of arms. At the time, this consisted solely of a shield, with the crest, supporters, and motto added throughout the latter half of the 20th century.

It was not until 1965 that the Government of New Brunswick resolved to introduce an unprecedented &quot;distinctive provincial flag&quot;. This was done shortly after the Canadian Red Ensign, which had been used unofficially as the national flag, was replaced on February 15, 1965, by a new design featuring a maple leaf. There were still parts of Canada where imperial nostalgia was strong, and ruing the demise of the Red Ensign, they sought to have it modified as a provincial flag; this occurred in Ontario (1965) and Manitoba (1966). In New Brunswick, the parliamentary opposition party – the Progressive Conservatives at that time – had plans to table a motion approving the Red Ensign as the new provincial flag, which would have had particularly detrimental ramifications given the province&#x27;s history of French and British settlement. Although the British had forcibly removed the Acadians from present-day New Brunswick during the mid-18th century, some of them returned after the deportations ended. Consequently, the province was still strongly divided by language, ethnicity, and religion, with English-speaking descendants of British colonists and Loyalists forming the majority and French-speaking Acadians comprising a sizeable minority of approximately 35%.

The Premier of New Brunswick in 1965 was Louis Robichaud, the first Acadian elected to lead the province. Naturally, his government was expected to vote against the motion, which would have had the effect of &quot;unavoidably alienating&quot; considerable number of New Brunswickers. Wanting to avoid a repeat of the divisive debate that had taken place on a national level, the provincial government sought to declare an alternative design as the provincial flag before the Opposition could. The task fell to Robert Pichette, a 28-year-old administrative assistant to Premier Robichaud who also had strong interest in heraldry.
Pichette worked in secret for three weeks on the design; he took inspiration from New Brunswick&#x27;s coat of arms and decided to make an armorial banner out of it, in what was described as &quot;a striking new artistic interpretation&quot; by vexillologist Whitney Smith. Although Pichette had adhered to the laws of heraldry, it was still rare for a country or their constituent entities to model their flag after their coat of arms. After he finished a rough draft of his intended end product, Pichette forwarded it to his friend Alan Beddoe – the country&#x27;s &quot;leading heraldic artist&quot; who designed the Pearson Pennant that was considered for the new national flag – as well as Conrad Swan of the College of Arms in London. Beddoe replied on January 20, enclosing the first sketch of the future flag.
Two full-sized prototypes were commissioned from a manufacturer based in Toronto. Upon seeing the proposed design for the first time, Premier Robichaud suggested the addition of oars to the galley. A seamstress in Fredericton then stitched this final modification to the banner. Despite the fact that the Royal Warrant permitted the straightforward inauguration of the new flag, an Order in Council was nonetheless promulgated by the province&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor on February 24, 1965. The new flag was officially unveiled on March 25, at the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick.

In a 2001 online survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association, New Brunswick&#x27;s flag ranked within the top quarter of state, provincial and territorial flags from Canada, the United States, and select current and former territories of the United States. It finished in 18th place out of 72.

==Design==
===Description===
The flag of New Brunswick has an aspect ratio of 5:8. The official colour scheme, according to the website of the Government of New Brunswick, follows the Pantone Matching System as indicated below. The colour numbers for the flag&#x27;s black and white shades are not specified.

===Symbolism===

The colours and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. According to Whitney Smith, the gold lion in the upper third of the flag alludes to either the Royal Arms of England or the coat of arms of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Both states had ties to New Brunswick – the former was its colonial ruler from 1713 until Confederation in 1867, while the latter lends its name to the province. On the other hand, the lymphad occupying the bottom two thirds of the flag may be evoking New Brunswick&#x27;s historical shipbuilding industry or the ships utilized by numerous Loyalists to land in the province after they fled the United States in the aftermath of the American Revolutionary War. Although shipbuilding was New Brunswick&#x27;s dominant economic activity at the time the coat of arms was assigned, the industry declined significantly after Confederation, leading to a period of recession in the province.

===Similarities===
The gold lion on a red field has a conspicuous resemblance to that of both the Royal Arms of England – which features three lions with a red backdrop – and the coat of arms of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, which has the same background colour but depicts only two lions. This is due to New Brunswick&#x27;s aforementioned historical connections to these regions.

==Protocol==

Advice regarding flag etiquette is the responsibility of the province&#x27;s Office of Protocol. When flown together with the flag of Canada and the other provincial and territorial flags, the flag of New Brunswick is fifth in the order of precedence (after the national flag and, in descending order of precedence, the flags of Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia). Even though New Brunswick entered into Confederation on the same date as those three provinces (July 1, 1867), it is placed last among the group since its size of population at the time was the smallest.

<doc id="343130" wikidata="Q818896" url="?curid=343130" title="Dixie Highway">
<text>Dixie Highway was a United States auto trail first planned in 1914 to connect the Midwest with the South. It was part of a system and was expanded from an earlier Miami to Montreal highway. The final system is better understood as a network of connected paved roads, rather than one single highway. It was constructed and expanded from 1915 to 1929.

The Dixie Highway was inspired by the example of the slightly earlier Lincoln Highway, the first road across the United States. The prime booster of both projects was promoter and businessman Carl G. Fisher. It was overseen by the Dixie Highway Association and funded by a group of individuals, businesses, local governments, and states. In the early years, the U.S. federal government played little role, but from the early 1920s on it provided increasing funding until 1927. That year the Dixie Highway Association was disbanded and the highway was taken over by the federal government as part of the U.S. Route system, with some portions becoming state roads.

The route was marked by a red stripe with the white letters &quot;DH&quot;, usually with a white stripe above and below. The logo was commonly painted on utility poles.

==Route description==

The Western route connected Chicago, Illinois, and Miami, Florida, via Danville in Illinois; Indianapolis and Bedford in Indiana; Louisville, Elizabethtown, and Bowling Green in Kentucky; Nashville and Chattanooga in Tennessee; Atlanta, Macon, and Albany in Georgia; and Tallahassee, Gainesville, Orlando, Arcadia, and Naples in Florida.

Except for realignments made since the 1920s, the western route is now Illinois Route 1 and U.S. Route 136 to Indianapolis, Indiana State Road 37 and U.S. Route 150 to Louisville, U.S. Route 31W, U.S. Route 68, and U.S. Route 431 to Nashville, and U.S. Route 41, U.S. Route 231, U.S. Route 41A, and U.S. Route 41 to Chattanooga. At Chattanooga, the western and eastern routes intersected; the western took a longer route along U.S. Route 27 to Rome and then returned to U.S. Route 41 at Cartersville via U.S. Route 411. At Atlanta, the eastern route split off toward Madison, Georgia, with the western continuing to Macon along the present U.S. Route 41; then Georgia State Route 49, U.S. Route 19, and U.S. Route 319 to Tallahassee; U.S. Route 27 and U.S. Route 441 to Orlando; and U.S. Route 17 and U.S. Route 41 (over Tamiami Trail) to Miami.

The Eastern route connected Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, with Miami, running via Saginaw and Detroit in Michigan; Toledo, Bowling Green, Lima, Dayton, and Cincinnati in Ohio; Lexington in Kentucky; Knoxville and Chattanooga in Tennessee; Atlanta and Savannah in Georgia; and Jacksonville and West Palm Beach in Florida.
In Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula, the highway followed what is now M-129 from Sault Ste. Marie to Pickford and then west to follow a short portion of former U.S. Route 2, replaced by Mackinac Trail. It crossed the Straits of Mackinac and then used what is now U.S. Route 23 and old U.S. Route 10 to Detroit. It still exists in Michigan as the name of a secondary road from Saginaw southeast to the county line (as an alternate route to Flint), from southeast Flint to northwest Pontiac, and from Flat Rock southwest to Monroe, ending at the state line. A short section of the Dixie Highway in northwest lower Michigan running north from Eastport in Antrim County to the village of Norwood in Charlevoix County is named Old Dixie Highway—U.S. Route 31 parallels this road to the east. In Ohio, it was old U.S. Route 25 to Cincinnati, current U.S. Route 25 and U.S. Route 25W to Knoxville, and U.S. Route 70 and U.S. Route 27 to Chattanooga. The eastern division took a more direct route than the western between Chattanooga and Atlanta, following the modern U.S. Route 41 all the way, but it followed a more circuitous path south of Atlanta. Traffic left Atlanta to the east on U.S. Route 278, following U.S. Route 441, Georgia State Route 24, a short section of U.S. Route 301, and Georgia State Route 21 to Savannah. There, the route turned south along the coast via U.S. Route 17 to Jacksonville and U.S. Route 1 to Miami. It is today (2016) a major street in towns and cities along the Florida East Coast.

The Central route was a short cutoff between the western division at Macon, Georgia, and the eastern route at Jacksonville, Florida, forming a shorter route to Miami than the western on its own; it followed U.S. Route 41, U.S. Route 341, U.S. Route 129, Georgia State Route 32, and U.S. Route 1.

The Carolina route cut the distance between Knoxville and Waynesboro, Georgia, on the eastern route. It is now U.S. Route 25W and U.S. Route 25, and passes through Asheville, Greenville, and Augusta on its way to the eastern route and Savannah.

==History==
The Dixie Highway, an idea of Carl G. Fisher of the Lincoln Highway Association, was organized in early December 1914 in Chattanooga. On April 3, 1915, governors of the interested states met at Chattanooga, and each selected two commissioners to lay out the route from Chicago to Miami. On May 22, 1915, the commission decided on a split route in order to serve more communities.

The route left Chicago to the south via Danville, Illinois, and turned east to Indianapolis, where it split. The west branch headed south through Tennessee via Louisville and Nashville to Chattanooga, Tennessee, while the east route went east from Indianapolis to Dayton, Ohio, before turning south via Cincinnati; Lexington, Kentucky; and Knoxville, Tennessee; to Chattanooga. Two alternate routes were included between Chattanooga and Atlanta, and again between Atlanta and Macon, Georgia. Finally, between Macon and Jacksonville, Florida, the west route went south to Tallahassee, Florida, before turning east, while the east route had yet to be defined in detail. From Jacksonville, the route followed the east coast south to Miami, along the John Anderson Highway.

The commission voted to invite Michigan to the project, and to extend a branch of the east route from Dayton north to Detroit via Toledo. It also studied a loop around Lake Michigan and a western route between Tallahassee and Miami.

Within a week, Michigan agreed to construct a loop around the Lower Peninsula, passing via Toledo, Ohio; South Bend, Indiana; Mackinaw City, Michigan; and Detroit. Detroit became the northern end of the eastern division, with the old route to Indianapolis becoming a connecting link.

In early April 1916, the commission approved the route between Macon and Jacksonville via Savannah, Georgia, and designated the more direct route via Waycross, Georgia, as the central division. At the urging of locals, the eastern division was realigned to a more direct path northwest from Milledgeville, Georgia, to Atlanta over the &quot;Old Capitol Route&quot;, bypassing Macon. The old eastern division via McDonough, Jackson, and Macon was removed from the system in early July 1916.

By early 1917, the western division had been modified in Florida to go southeast from Tallahassee via Kissimmee and Bartow to the eastern division at Jupiter; the old Tallahassee–Jacksonville route became another connection. The Carolina division, connecting to the eastern division at Knoxville, Tennessee, and Waynesboro, Georgia, was approved in mid-May 1918. By mid-1919, a short piece on Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula to Sault Ste. Marie, became part of the eastern division of the highway, which was extended north from Detroit to Mackinaw City and across the Straits of Mackinac.

Construction of various sections was done by convict laborers.

===After establishment of U.S. Highway System===

Much of the eastern route—and all the Carolina route—became U.S. Route 25. Then the primary eastern route (Knoxville to Macon) was largely paralleled and in some sections replaced by Interstate 75, which runs from Miami to Sault Ste. Marie. Large portions of the former US 25 in western Ohio became known (after Interstate 75&#x27;s completion in that area in 1963) by various names, including County Road 25A, Dixie Drive, Dixie Highway, Cincinnati-Dayton Road, and, through Dayton, Patterson Boulevard and Keowee Street. A four-lane portion runs between Cygnet and Toledo, through Bowling Green, as Ohio State Route 25. In Michigan, M-25 from Port Huron to Bay City incorporates the segment of old US 25 that Interstates 75 and 94 did not supplant as a through route. The eastern portion from Jacksonville south was largely replaced with U.S. Route 1.

The portion of the western route from Nashville, Tennessee, north to Louisville, Kentucky is now U.S. Highway 31W. In most of the cities it traverses in Kentucky, it is still referred to as &quot;Dixie Highway&quot; or &quot;Dixie Avenue&quot;. The western route generally follows the present-day route of US 150, Indiana SR 37, and Indiana SR 67 from Louisville to Indianapolis. From Nashville to Indianapolis, the route parallels Interstate 65. Portions of this stretch were originally parts of the Louisville and Nashville Turnpike, which began construction in the 1830s.

U.S. Route 1 is named Dixie Highway from the national southern terminus of Interstate 95 in Miami to the Overseas Highway in Key Largo, Florida. The name &quot;Dixie Highway&quot; persists in various locations along its route where the main flow of long-distance traffic has been rerouted to newer highways and the old Dixie Highway remains as a local road. In some south Florida cities, Dixie Highway (or sometimes Old Dixie Highway) parallels &quot;Federal Highway&quot; (U.S. Route 1), sometimes just a block away. In Tennessee, the name lives on in Dixie Lee Junction (where Dixie Highway and Lee Highway intersected). In western North Carolina, seven bronze plaques on granite pillars were placed by the United Daughters of the Confederacy in the late 1920s to mark the route (which today follows US 25) of the Dixie Highway and honor General Robert E. Lee. These markers could be found in the towns of Hot Springs, Marshall, Asheville, Fletcher, and Hendersonville, and on the South Carolina and Tennessee state lines; an eighth monument of identical type can be found on US 25 in downtown Greenville, South Carolina. Two additional monuments could be found in Franklin, Ohio at the intersection of the Old Dixie Highway and Hamilton-Middletown Road, and near Bradfordville, Florida, on US 319. Markers in Hot Springs, Marshall, and Tuxedo were stolen. Markers in Asheville and Franklin were removed by local governments. In 2022 Calvary Episcopal Church in Fletcher returned the marker in front of the church to the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The name Dixie Highway is also still commonly used in portions of Michigan&#x27;s Lower Peninsula, such as in the Waterford area, where it is a major thoroughfare known as U.S. Route 24.

Dixie Highway retains its name running south from Chicago through the towns of Posen, Harvey, and Homewood to the town of Chicago Heights. Here it joins Illinois Route 1, which runs contiguous with the old Dixie Highway&#x27;s original course.
In Indiana, the only portion of the Highway that retains its name is located in southwestern Bedford, although Roseland names its section Dixie Way. Indiana State Road 37 in southern Indiana and US 31 in northern Indiana were once part of the Dixie Highway system. A detailed 1915 map of the Dixie Highway route through Indiana and other states was generated by the National Highways Association. At least a portion of the Dixie Highway in Indiana was paved with brick, although some portions used continuous concrete (meaning no expansion joints). The state has not forgotten the crucial part that entrepreneur and native son Carl G. Fisher played in the development of the Dixie Highway nor the importance of the Dixie Highway itself.

In some cities and towns, Dixie Highway is the north–south axis of the street numbering system. Also, the route of Dixie Highway generally parallels the coast, often running diagonally instead of straight north and south, causing irregularities in the numbering system.

The Dixie Highway-Hastings, Espanola and Bunnell Road (also known as County Road 13 or the Old Brick Road) is a historic section of Old Dixie Highway in Florida. It is located roughly between Espanola (in Flagler County) and CR 204 southeast of Hastings near Flagler Estates (in St. Johns County). This is one of the few extant portions of the original brick Dixie Highway left in Florida. On April 20, 2005, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Maitland, Florida, is also home to a brick section of the Dixie Highway stretching around Lake Lily. In Hobe Sound, Florida development centers on Dixie Highway, and historic lampposts dating to around 1925 are present along the route. 

There is also a small section of the original brick Dixie Highway, and a monument marking the county line, near Loughman, Florida, on the Osceola County/Polk County border.

A segment of Dixie Highway remains as an arterial street in Hallandale Beach, Florida. The name is mired in controversy due to its antebellum connotation, which some say glorifies the nation&#x27;s racist history of slavery, and &quot;upholds the history of the Confederacy&quot;. A portion of US 1 named Dixie Highway in Coral Gables, Florida, has been given the historical designation of &quot;Harriet Tubman Highway&quot; on brown designation signs, but any change to the official road name requires state approval.

<text>The Mutapa Empire – sometimes referred to as Mwenemutapa, (, ) – was an African empire in Zimbabwe, which expanded to what is now modern-day Mozambique, Botswana, Malawi, and Zambia. It was ruled by the Nembire or Mbire dynasty.

The Portuguese term &quot;Monomotapa&quot; is a transliteration of the Shona royal title &quot;Mwenemutapa&quot; derived from a combination of two words, &quot;Mwene&quot; meaning &quot;Lord&quot; and &quot;Mutapa&quot; meaning &quot;conquered land&quot;. Over time the monarch&#x27;s royal title was applied to the kingdom as a whole, and used to denote the kingdom&#x27;s territory on maps from the period.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
There are several Mutapa origin stories, the most widely accepted told by oral tradition is of the princes of Great Zimbabwe. Shona oral tradition attributes Great Zimbabwe&#x27;s demise to a salt shortage, which may be a figurative way of speaking of land depletion for agriculturalists or of the depletion of critical resources for the community. The first &quot;Mutapa&quot; was a warrior prince named Nyatsimba Mutota from the Kingdom of Zimbabwe who expanded the reach of the kingdom searching for new sources of salt in the north, near the Zambezi, with some traditions saying he was sent by his father, the king of Great Zimbabwe. Mutota is said to have found salt in the lands of the Tavara, and settled around the Ruya-Mazowe Basin, conquering and incorporating the pre-existing chiefdoms to control agricultural production and strategic resources. This placed the state at a key position in the gold and ivory trade. 

Around 1440, Mutota began aggressive campaigns against the surrounding tribes, expanding the boundaries of the lands under his control to the west along the Zambezi River. In the early 15th century Angoche traders opened a new route along the Zambezi via Mutapa and Ingombe Ilede to reach the goldfields close to Khami, precipitating the rise of the Kingdom of Butua. This cut off Great Zimbabwe to the east, contributing to its decline.

It was believed that only Mutapa&#x27;s most recent ancestors would follow them, with older ancestors staying at Great Zimbabwe and providing protection there. A Shona king&#x27;s claim to land is through their ancestors, and this would have impacted the legitimacy of Mutapa&#x27;s leaders.

=== Further expansion ===
Mutota&#x27;s son and successor, Nyanhewe Matope, moved the capital to Mount Fura and extended this new kingdom into an empire encompassing most of the lands between Tavara and the Indian Ocean. This empire had achieved uniting a number of different peoples in Southern Africa by building strong, well-trained armies and encouraging states to join voluntarily, offering membership in the Great council of the Empire to any who joined without resistance. Matope&#x27;s armies overran the Manyika and Tonga as well as the coastal Teve and Madanda. By the time the Portuguese arrived on the coast of Mozambique, the Mutapa Empire was the most powerful state in the region. The empire had reached its full extent by 1480, a mere 50 years following its creation. 

=== Changamire I and loss of the southern regions ===
There appear to have intermarriages between the Nembire dynasty and the Torwa dynasty of Butua. According to oral traditions, Changamire was likely a descendant of both dynasties, being the son of Matope or had married Matope&#x27;s daughter (or both were true and he married his sister as was commonplace in the royal family). He had been appointed governor (&quot;amir&quot;) of the southern portion of the Mutapa Empire (&quot;Guruhuswa&quot;). Diogo de Alcáçova&#x27;s report in 1506 indicates that Changamire I was a member of the Torwa dynasty who had served as a wealthy and influential governor of the &quot;Mwenemutapa&quot; (Mutapa king). 

In 1490, Changamire I rebelled against the &quot;Mwenemutapa&quot;, his elder brother Nyahuma, and deposed him, reportedly with help from the Torwa. He ruled Mutapa for four years until he was killed by the rightful heir to the throne, reportedly his nephew. His son Changamire II continued the conflict, ruling the southern portion which broke away from the Mutapa Empire. Whether this breakaway state maintained independence or came back under the rule of the &quot;Mwenemutapa&quot; is unclear, as we don&#x27;t hear of the Changamire dynasty again until the 17th century.

=== Portuguese contact ===
The Portuguese dominated much of southeast Africa&#x27;s coast, laying waste to Sofala and Kilwa, by 1515. Their main goal was to dominate the trade with India; however, they unwittingly became mere carriers for luxury goods between Mutapa&#x27;s sub-kingdoms and India. Main commodity brokers included Zharare and mhere mhere. As the Portuguese settled along the coast, they made their way into the hinterland as &quot;sertanejos&quot; (backwoodsmen). These &quot;sertanejos&quot; lived alongside Swahili traders and even took up service among Shona kings as interpreters and political advisors. One such &quot;sertanejo&quot;, António Fernandes, managed to travel through almost all the Shona kingdoms, including Mutapa&#x27;s metropolitan district, between 1512 and 1516.He mainly travelled with Dhafa Zharare,son of Chipere Zharare who wanted the son to learn how to trade.

The Portuguese finally entered into direct relations with the Mwenemutapa in the 1560s. They recorded a wealth of information about the Mutapa Kingdom as well as its predecessor, Great Zimbabwe. According to Swahili traders whose accounts were recorded by the Portuguese historian João de Barros, Great Zimbabwe was a medieval capital city built of stones of marvellous size without the use of mortar. And while the site was not within Mutapa&#x27;s borders, the Mwenemutapa kept noblemen and some of his wives there. By the 17th century, other Europeans would extensively describe Mutapa architecture through paintings. Olfert Dapper revealed four grand gateways which led to several halls and chambers in the Mutapa palace. The ceilings of the rooms in the palace were gilt with golden plates alongside ivory chandeliers which hung on silver chains and filled the halls with light.

In 1569, King Sebastian of Portugal made a grant of arms to the Mwenemutapa. These were blazoned: Gules between two arrows Argent an African hoe barwise bladed Or handled Argent – The shield surmounted by a Crown Oriental. This was probably the first grant of arms to a native of southern Africa; however it is unlikely that these arms were ever actually used by the Mwenemutapa.

====The accidental crusade====
In 1561, a Portuguese Jesuit missionary, Gonçalo da Silveira managed to make his way into the Mwenemutapa&#x27;s court and convert him to Christianity. This did not go well with the Muslim merchants in the capital, and they persuaded the king to kill the Jesuit only a few days after his baptism. This was all the justification the Portuguese needed to penetrate the interior and take control of the gold mines and ivory routes. After a lengthy preparation, an expedition of 1,000 men under Francisco Barreto was launched in 1568. They managed to get as far as the upper Zambezi, but local disease decimated the force. The Portuguese returned to their base in 1572 and took their frustrations out on the Swahili traders, whom they massacred. They replaced them with Portuguese and their half-African progeny who became prazeiros (estate holders) of the lower Zambezi. Mutapa maintained a position of strength exacting a subsidy from each captain of Portuguese Mozambique that took the office. The Mwenemutapa also levied a duty of 50 percent on all trade goods imported.

===Decline and collapse===

Mutapa proved invulnerable to attack and even economic manipulation due to the Mwenemutapa&#x27;s strong control over gold production. What posed the greatest threat was infighting among different factions which led to opposing sides calling on the Portuguese for military aid. However, the Portuguese proved to be happy with the downfall of the Mutapa state.

====Portuguese control====
In 1629 the Mwenemutapa attempted to throw out the Portuguese. He failed and in turn he himself was overthrown, leading to the Portuguese installation of Mavura Mhande Felipe on the throne. Mutapa signed treaties making it a Portuguese vassal and ceding gold mines, but none of these concessions were ever put into effect. Mutapa remained nominally independent, though practically a client state. All the while, Portugal increased control over much of southeast Africa with the beginnings of a colonial system. The Portuguese were now in control of the trade and the trade routes.

====Loss of prestige====
Another problem for Mutapa was that its tributaries such as Kiteve, Madanda and Manyika ceased paying tribute. At the same time, a new kingdom under the Rozvi dynasty near Barwe was on the rise. All of this was hastened by
Portugal retaining a presence on the coast and in the capital. At least one part of the 1629 treaty that was acted on was the provision allowing Portuguese settlement within Mutapa. It also allowed the praezeros to establish fortified settlements across the kingdom. In 1663, the praezeros were able to depose Mwenemutapa Siti Kazurukamusapa and put their own nominee, Kamharapasu Mukombwe on the throne.

==== Butwa invasion ====
In the 17th century, a low ranking Mutapa prince broke away from the Empire, invading the neighboring Kingdom of Butua. The leader of this Dynasty became known as Changamire Dombo. A possible reason for the breakaway was Dombo&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the levels of Portuguese interference in the Mwenemutapa Empire&#x27;s governance.

By the late 17th century, Changamire Domborakonachingwango (or Dombo for short. Pronounced as Ɗömbö) was actively challenging Mutapa. In 1684 his forces encountered and decisively defeated those of Mwenemutapa Kamharapasu Mukombwe just south of Mutapa&#x27;s metro district at the Battle of Mahungwe. When Mukombwe died in 1692, a succession crisis erupted. The Portuguese backed one successor and Dombo another. In support of his candidate, Changamire Dombo razed the Portuguese fair-town of Dembarare next to the Mutapa capital and slaughtered the Portuguese traders and their entire following. From 1692 until 1694, Mwenemutapa Nyakambira ruled Mutapa independently. Nyakambira was later killed in battle with the Portuguese who then placed Nyamaende Mhande on the throne as their puppet.

In 1695, Changamire Dombo overran the gold-producing Kingdom of Manyika and took his army east and destroyed the Portuguese fair-town of Masikwesi. This gave him complete control of all gold-producing territory from Butwa to Manyika, supplanting Mutapa as the premier Shona Kingdom in the region.

====Shifting rulers====
It appears neither the Rozwi nor the Portuguese could maintain control of the Mutapa state for very long, and it moved back and forth between the two throughout the 17th century. Far from a victim of conquest, the Mutapa rulers actually invited in foreign powers to bolster their rule. This included vassalage to Portuguese East Africa from 1629 to 1663 and vassalage to the Rozwi Empire from 1663 until the Portuguese return in 1694. Portuguese control of Mutapa was maintained or at least represented by an armed garrison at the capital. In 1712, yet another coveter of the throne invited the Rozwi back to put him on the throne and kick out the Portuguese. This they did, and Mutapa again came under the control of the Rozwi Empire. The new Mwenemutapa Samatambira Nyamhandu I become their vassal, while the outgoing king was forced to retreat to Chidama in what is now Mozambique.

====Independence and move from Zimbabwe====
The Rozwi quickly lost interest in Mutapa, as they sought to consolidate their position in the south. Mutapa regained its independence around 1720. By this time, the Kingdom of Mutapa had lost nearly all of the Zimbabwe plateau to the Rozwi Empire. In 1723, Nyamhandi moved his capital into the valley near the Portuguese trading settlement of Tete, under Mwenemutapa Nyatsusu. Upon his death in 1740, the young Dehwe Mapunzagutu took power. He sought Portuguese support and invited them back to Mutapa along with their garrison of armed men, but Mutapa remained independent.

===Collapse===

The Mwenemutapa died in 1759, sparking yet another civil war for the throne. This one was more destructive than its predecessors and Mutapa never recovered. The &quot;winners&quot; ended up governing an even more reduced land from Chidima. They used the title &quot;Mambo a Chidima&quot; and ruled independently of Portugal until 1917 when Mambo Chioko, the last king of the dynasty, was killed in battle against the Portuguese.

== Mutapa as Ophir ==
The empire had another indirect side effect on the history of southern Africa. Gold from the empire inspired in Europeans a belief that Mwenemutapa held the legendary mines of King Solomon, referred to in the Bible as the biblical port of Ophir.

The belief that the mines were inside the Mwenemutapa kingdom in southern Africa was one of the factors that led to the Portuguese exploration of the hinterland of Sofala in the 16th century, and this contributed to early development of Mozambique, as the legend was widely used among the less educated populace to recruit colonists. Some documents suggest that most of the early colonists dreamt of finding the legendary city of gold in southern Africa, a belief mirroring the early South American colonial search for El Dorado and quite possibly inspired by it. Early trade in gold came to an end as the mines ran out, and the deterioration of the Mutapa state eliminated the financial and political support for further developing sources of gold.

Legacy

For several centuries, this trading empire enabled people across a large territory to live in peace and security under a stable government and succession of rulers. With primary records dating back to 1502, the empire is a &quot;prime testing ground for theories … concerning economic, political and religious development&quot; in pre-colonial Africa. Beach comments that the Mutapa was one of only four Shona states that was not entirely &quot;uprooted by new settlements of people&quot; and the only one &quot;close to Portuguese centers&quot; thus providing important data on contact and relationships between this and other Shona states as well as with Europeans. The Mutapa Empire is an example of a working system of government in Africa and of a flourishing civilization, both of which are often assumed to have been absent before the coming of the Europeans.

The Emperor Mutope had left the empire with a well-organised religion with a powerful shamanism. The religion of the Mutapa kingdom revolved around ritual consultation of spirits and of ancestors. Shrines were maintained within the capital by spirit mediums known as &quot;mhondoro&quot;. The mhondoro also served as oral historians recording the names and deeds of past kings.
