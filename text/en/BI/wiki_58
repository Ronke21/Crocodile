<text>Wagga Wagga (; informally called Wagga) is a major regional city in the Riverina region of New South Wales, Australia. Straddling the Murrumbidgee River, with an urban population of more than 57,003 as of 2021, it is an important agricultural, military, and transport hub of Australia. The ninth largest inland city in Australia, Wagga Wagga is located midway between the two largest cities in Australia—Sydney and Melbourne—and is the major regional centre for the Riverina and South West Slopes regions.

The central business district is focused around the commercial and recreational grid bounded by Best and Tarcutta Streets and the Murrumbidgee River and the Sturt Highway. The main shopping street of Wagga is Baylis Street which becomes Fitzmaurice Street at the northern end. Wagga is accessible from Sydney via the Sturt and Hume Highways, Adelaide via the Sturt Highway and Albury and Melbourne via the Olympic Highway and Hume Highway. Wagga is in an alluvial valley and much of the city has a problem with urban salinity.

The original inhabitants of the Wagga Wagga region were the Wiradjuri people. In 1829, Charles Sturt became the first European explorer to visit the future site of the city. Squatters arrived soon after. The town, positioned on the site of a ford across the Murrumbidgee, was surveyed and gazetted as a village in 1849 and the town grew quickly after. In 1870, the town was gazetted as a municipality.

During the negotiations leading to the federation of the Australian colonies, Wagga Wagga was a contender for the site of the capital for the new nation. During World War I, the town was the starting point for the Kangaroo recruitment march. The Great Depression and the resulting hardship saw Wagga Wagga become the centre of a secession movement for the Riverina region. Wagga Wagga became a garrison town during World War II with the establishment of a military base at Kapooka and Royal Australian Air Force bases at Forest Hill and Uranquinty. After the war, Wagga Wagga was proclaimed as a city in 1946 and new suburbs were developed to the south of the city. In 1982, the city was amalgamated with the neighbouring Kyeamba and Mitchell Shires to form the City of Wagga Wagga local government area.

==Geography==

Wagga Wagga is at the eastern end of the Riverina region where the slopes of the Great Dividing Range flatten and form the Riverina plain. Wagga straddles the Murrumbidgee River, one of the great rivers of the Murray–Darling basin, and the city centre is on the southern bank, protected by a levee from potential flooding.

Wagga sits halfway between the largest cities in Australia, being 452 kilometres southwest of Sydney and 456 kilometres northeast of Melbourne with the Sydney–Melbourne railway line passing through. The Sturt Highway, part of Australia&#x27;s National Highway network, passes through Wagga on its way from Adelaide to its junction with the main Sydney–Melbourne route, the Hume Highway, a further 45 kilometres east.

This location astride some of Australia&#x27;s major transport routes has made Wagga Wagga an important heavy truck depot for a number of companies, including Toll Group. Wagga Wagga itself is the major regional centre for the Riverina and for much of the South West Slopes regions, providing education, health and other services to a region extending as far as Griffith to the west, Cootamundra to the north and Tumut to the east.

===Landform and salinity===

Wagga Wagga is upstream from the Riverina plain in the mid-catchment range of the Murrumbidgee River in an alluvial valley confined by low bedrock hills. Much of Wagga Wagga is on heavy clay soils in a large drainage basin with a small catchment discharge point. Groundwater therefore cannot leave easily, leading to Wagga Wagga having a problem with waterlogged soil and soil salination. Urban salination in Wagga Wagga is now the subject of a large multi-pronged approach to prevent further salination and reclaim salt-affected areas.

===City and suburbs===
The location of Wagga Wagga&#x27;s Central business district was already well established by the late 1800s and remains focused around the commercial and recreational grid bounded by Best and Tarcutta Streets and the Murrumbidgee River and the Sturt Highway. The main shopping street of Wagga Wagga is Baylis Street which becomes Fitzmaurice Street at the northern end. The Wollundry Lagoon is the water focus of the city centre and has been a key element in the development and separation of the north (older) and south (newer) parts of the city centre.

Most residential growth in Wagga Wagga has been on the higher ground to the south of the city centre, with the only residential areas north of the Murrumbidgee being the flood prone suburb of North Wagga Wagga and the university suburb of Estella. Major industrial areas of Wagga Wagga include the northern suburb of Bomen and the eastern suburb of East Wagga Wagga.

Thomas Mitchell, the surveyor who served under Lord Wellington, named many of the streets after Peninsular War veterans.

===Climate===
Wagga Wagga has a temperate climate with hot dry summers and cool to cold winters. Under the Köppen climate classification, the city has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;), with a semi-arid influence in its vegetation.

In December 2010, the city recorded its wettest year on record and the first yearly rainfall recording of .

==History==

=== European settlement ===
The original inhabitants of the Wagga Wagga region, who maintain a relationship with the area to this day, are the Wiradjuri people and the word &quot;wagga&quot; in the Wiradjuri language was thought to mean &#x27;crow&#x27;, so &quot;wagga wagga&quot; could be taken to mean &#x27;the place of many crows&#x27;. Other interpretations had &quot;wagga&quot; to mean &#x27;reeling&#x27; (a sick man or a dizzy man); &#x27;to dance, slide or grind&#x27;. In August 2019, the City of Wagga Wagga dropped the definition &#x27;crow&#x27; and adopted the city&#x27;s Aboriginal meaning as &#x27;dance and celebrations&#x27;. The new meaning was officially enshrined in the city&#x27;s first Reconciliation Action Plan.
European exploration of the future site of Wagga Wagga began in 1829 with the arrival of Captain Charles Sturt during his expedition along the Murrumbidgee River. Settlers arrived shortly thereafter with Charles Tompson establishing the Eunonyhareenyha &#x27;run&#x27; in 1832 on the north bank of the river, and also in 1832 the Wagga Wagga &#x27;run&#x27; established by Robert Holt Best (died September 1853), on the south bank. Other settlers followed, all squatting illegally, but by 1836 the colonial government regulated the tenure of land and established a licensing scheme. Within a few years settlers&#x27; numbers increased greatly and before 1850 a local bench of magistrates and a place for holding petty sessions was established. The beginnings of a village formed near the ford used by most traffic passing through the area and included a crude blacksmith&#x27;s shop, a hotel, and a post office. By 1849 the town was marked out by surveyor Thomas Scott Townsend and formally gazetted as a village.

Wagga Wagga grew quickly, reaching a population of 627 in 1861 and during that decade a number of hotels and stores opened, as well as professional services in the form of banks, solicitors, doctors and dentists. The &quot;Wagga Wagga Advertiser&quot; (today&#x27;s &quot;Daily Advertiser&quot;) commenced publication in 1868. Until the 1860s most goods were transported to markets by bullock wagon. For a short time, the arrival of faster, cheaper and more reliable riverboats allowed goods to be transported more easily to export markets. The riverboat era ended when the New South Wales government extended the railway line to North Wagga Wagga in 1878 and across the river to Wagga Wagga itself in 1881.

As in most rural towns Chinese people made a significant contribution as storekeeper, scrub clearers and in other occupations. As observed in 1879: &quot;Chinamen seem to pervade everywhere. It is evident that the yellow agony doesn&#x27;t annoy the good folks of Wagga Wagga much. Chinese cooks, Chinese &quot;boots&quot; Chinese labourers, Chinese servants are everywhere.&quot; &quot;Most of the &quot;ringing&quot; on the surrounding runs and selections is in the hands of Chinamen, who, be it noted, have so far advanced in the civilisation of the west as to understand fully the advantage of a fair day&#x27;s pay for a fair day&#x27;s work. Chinese cheap labour is unknown here. The Celestial business establishments seem well patronised by Europeans as well as by their compatriots.&quot;

On 15 March 1870, Wagga Wagga was incorporated as a municipality and George Forsyth was chosen as the first mayor of Wagga Wagga. Gas lighting was installed throughout the streets of Wagga Wagga in 1881, although once again North Wagga Wagga was neglected. By 1885, a town waterworks and reservoir was established although water quality remained a problem. Poor sanitation caused a horrific stench in the town and was blamed for a large increase in infectious diseases such as typhoid fever in the 1890s and early 1900s. In 1908 the council approved a sewerage scheme and by 1914 most of the main streets were sewered. A free public library was opened in 1875 and the council began to establish parklands such as Bolton Park and the Town Hall Gardens.
In September 1859 local residents formed a committee for the construction of a pile bridge over the Murrumbidgee River. After the New South Wales Government refused to support this type of bridge the committee decided to finance it themselves. The bridge was completed in October 1862 and opened on 27 October at just over 91 metres long and 7 metres wide. In 1884 the New South Wales Government purchased the bridge and it was demolished in 1895. In 1895 a truss bridge called the Hampden Bridge, was built across the Murrumbidgee River at Wagga. The bridge served the Wagga Wagga community for over 100 years until 16 August 2006 when it was closed and fenced off to the public due to the bridge being declared a safety risk after one of the trusses failed. In 2014 the Hampden Bridge was demolished.

With its increasing prosperity and population, Wagga Wagga and the surrounding district became a place of interest to several infamous bushrangers. The Wagga police magistrate Henry Baylis was bailed up by Mad Dog Morgan in 1863. Captain Moonlite and his band arrived in the district on 15 November 1879 and held up 39 people at Wantabadgery Station. Moonlite and his gang escaped a police pursuit only to be captured at another nearby property when police from the neighbouring townships of Gundagai and Adelong arrived.
Along with most of the Riverina region, the majority of Wagga Wagga residents supported the federation of the Australian colonies, in large part due to the prospect of free trade across colonial borders. In 1898, a group of residents promoted Wagga Wagga for consideration as the site of the future national capital due to its location equidistant from Sydney and Melbourne and its ample water supply. Despite the bid&#x27;s lack of success, in the 1899 referendum Wagga Wagga residents voted strongly in favour of federation.
During World War I the town was the starting point of the &quot;Kangaroo March&quot;, one of a series of snowball marches conducted in New South Wales during the war in which groups of recruits marched towards Sydney and appealed to men in the towns along the route to join them and enlist in the Australian Imperial Force. 88 recruits left Wagga Wagga on 1 December 1915, farewelled by a large crowd and to the accompaniment of a band. The marchers included John Ryan, who later won the Victoria Cross for his actions in the Battle of the Hindenburg Line in 1918. The march finished at Campbelltown with over 220 recruits.
After the war some of the area around Wagga Wagga was designated for settlement by returned soldiers, who faced insurmountable difficulties due to poor and unwatered land, lack of farming experience and lack of access to markets. Many walked off the land after years of backbreaking work. Residential growth continued with a population in 1921 of 11,631. Much of this residential growth was housed in the higher ground to the south, extending to the south of the railway tracks. A suburb consisting of tents and crude huts, known as &quot;Tent Town&quot;, developed along the river providing housing for the poorer residents of Wagga Wagga. In 1922, electricity was provided for the town, with hydro-electric power available from Burrinjuck Dam from 1928.

Hardship as a result of the Great Depression, and the election of Jack Lang of the Labor party as Premier of New South Wales, sparked the formation of the &quot;Riverina Movement&quot;. Throughout the Riverina in early 1931, a series of rallies were organised by the movement, culminating in a great meeting in Wagga Wagga on 28 February 1931. The meeting called on the State and Federal governments to alleviate the concerns of producers in the district or hold a referendum to determine if the Riverina should secede. The movement petered out following the dismissal of Lang in 1932 and the recovery of the regional economy.

The outbreak of World War II saw Royal Australian Air Force bases established at Forest Hill in 1940 and Uranquinty in 1941. A major Australian Army camp was constructed at Kapooka in 1942 and one year later there were 8,000 troops in training there with Wagga taking on the characteristics of a garrison town.

After the war, Wagga Wagga grew steadily and was proclaimed a city on 17 April 1946. Suburbs such as Turvey Park and Kooringal were developed to the south of the city and in the 1960s, residential growth expanded to cover areas such as Tolland and Lake Albert. The main commercial district also moved south to the Baylis Street end with the development of the Sturt Mall in 1979. The City Council developed a series of industrial areas including areas for service and general industries, and agricultural processing and noxious industries were established in a new industrial estate in Bomen.
In the 1950s the defence bases in Wagga Wagga again became an important part of the city. The Army camp at Kapooka was reopened as a recruit training centre from 1951, a role it maintains to this day. RAAF Base Wagga at Forest Hill also expanded, with training of defence force aircraft technicians there from 1969. After a series of major floods in the early 1950s, the City Council protected the city area on the south flood plain through construction of a levee, completed in 1962. The levee was designed to provide protection from floods at levels expected once every one hundred years. North Wagga Wagga was initially excluded from protection however by 1982 another levee was constructed to protect the village, although at a lower standard.

In 1971, following pressure from the Wagga Wagga community for a university, the teachers&#x27; college established in 1947 became the Riverina College of Advanced Education and was relocated to a site adjacent to the Wagga Agricultural College, with which it amalgamated in 1975. In 1989, the college amalgamated with the College of Advanced Education at Bathurst to become Charles Sturt University. In 1981, the New South Wales government forced the amalgamation of Wagga Wagga City Council with neighbouring Kyeamba Shire and Mitchell Shire to form the new City of Wagga Wagga local government area, containing 4,886 square kilometres.

In February 1993, Wagga Wagga was the first city in the world to be proclaimed as a Rotary Peace City, with a Rotary Peace Monument unveiled on the corner of The Esplanade and Best Street.

== Heritage listings ==
Wagga Wagga has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Botanic Gardens Site (BGS), Baden Powell Drive: Mobile Cook&#x27;s Galley, Museum of the Riverina
* Main Southern railway: Wagga Wagga railway station

==Symbols==
=== Flag ===
The Wagga Wagga city flag was designed by H Ellis Tomlinson and adopted in 1965. Wagga Wagga City Council holds the copyright to Tomlinson&#x27;s design. The flag is officially square and takes its design from the shield of the city&#x27;s coat of arms.

===Coat of arms===
The upper quarter of the shield contains eight stalks of wheat positioned to form two capital letters W on a vert (green) field. The lower quarter of the upper half of the flag contains a wavy blue line on gold (yellow) representing the river winding through the wheat fields. The lower half of the flag contains the head of a ram positioned centrally on a vert (green) field.

The crest has a gold (yellow) mural crown on a knight&#x27;s helmet. Inside the mural crown are a yellow caduceus with black wings, and eight gum leaves arranged as two letters W.

Both the supporters are crows, each with a gold (yellow) collar in the shape of the letter W.

The base of the coat of arms is grassy with a river in between, indicating that Wagga Wagga is built on both sides of the river.

===Crows===

Crows are considered a symbol of the city of Wagga Wagga, appearing in the council&#x27;s logo, coat of arms, and throughout branding of local businesses, as well as in public artwork. This is due to the debated interpretation of &#x27;Wagga Wagga&#x27; being derived from a Wiradjuri language term meaning &#x27;place of many crows&#x27;.

Since 2019, the Wagga Wagga City Council has recognised this meaning as incorrect, instead adopting &quot;many dances and celebrations&quot;, which was supported by Wiradjuri elder Stan Grant. Crows remain a ubiquitous civic symbol of Wagga Wagga. Both the council and ABC Riverina have promoted the use of the barking marsh frog as an alternative animal emblem for the city, originally suggested by Canberra resident Dec Browne.

==Demographics==

Wagga Wagga is the major city of the Riverina and the second largest inland city in New South Wales after Maitland, In 2021 the urban area of Wagga Wagga was home to 57,003 people. Wagga had grown, on average, 0.65 percent year-on-year during the previous five years. Much of this growth is attributable to the &quot;sponge city&quot; phenomenon as Wagga Wagga attracts residents from smaller towns in the region such as Urana. Other factors include Wagga&#x27;s role as a regional centre and its hosting of major defence establishments and a Charles Sturt University campus.

In the 2021 census, there were 57,003 people in the Wagga Wagga Urban Area.

* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 7% of the population. 
* 82.9% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were India 1.5%, Iraq 1.4%, England 1.2% and New Zealand and Philippines both 0.7%. 
* 85.2% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Kurdish 1.2%, Malayalam 0.8%, Mandarin 0.6%, Arabic 0.5%, and Punjabi 0.4%. 
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 31.2%, Catholic 27.4%, Anglican 15.3%, Not stated 5.9% and Presbyterian and Reformed 3.7%.

Wagga is home to approximately 39% of Australia&#x27;s Yazidi population.

Wagga Wagga falls within the boundary of the Anglican Diocese of Canberra and Goulburn. Anglican parishes include St John&#x27;s, Wagga Wagga (Church St); St Paul&#x27;s, Turvey Park (Fernleigh Rd); St Alban&#x27;s, Kooringal (Lake Albert Rd); Community of the Redeemer, Ashmont (Blakemore Ave).

==Economy==

===Commercial===

Wagga attracts people from all over the Riverina and southwestern New South Wales to its shopping facilities. It is the major support city for over 200,000 people who live across the region.

Wagga&#x27;s shopping centres include two notable centres of metropolitan standards, Wagga Wagga Marketplace and Sturt Mall in the central business district, and suburban shopping centres such as the South City Shopping Centre in Glenfield Park, the Lake Village Shopping Centre, Lake Albert, the Tolland Shopping Centre and Kooringal Mall in Kooringal. Wagga has a large HomeBase store located on the Sturt Highway.

Wagga&#x27;s central business district, with both Baylis and Fitzmaurice Streets and other surrounding streets, offers hundreds of speciality retailers including national chains such as Big W, Myer and Kmart. Target Country closed its store on Baylis Street in March 2021. The dairy company Fonterra (formerly Murrumbidgee Dairy Products), is based on the Sturt Highway, and is a supplier of dairy products in the Riverina, Other major industries include Cargill and Heinz, which are in the suburb of Bomen.

===Defence forces===

The Australian Army base at Kapooka includes the Army Recruit Training Centre, where general enlistment members of the Australian Army undertake their initial training. The barracks at Kapooka are named after World War II military commander Sir Thomas Blamey, born at Lake Albert Wagga Wagga and Australia&#x27;s only Field Marshal. Following recruit training, soldiers move on to take specific training at training establishments throughout Australia. The soldiers club at Kapooka is named for John Hurst Edmondson, Australia&#x27;s first Victoria Cross winner in World War II, who was born in Wagga Wagga.

There is a separate Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base at Forest Hill, RAAF Base Wagga, which is the administration and logistics training base for Air Force personnel and the tri-service (RAN/Army/RAAF) electronic (White hander) and aircraft (Black hander) trades school. Some Royal Australian Navy Aircraft Technicians assigned to the naval air station are based at RAAF Base Wagga as an Aircraft Maintenance and Flight Trials Unit (AMAFTU). As of 2008, No 1 Recruit Training Unit (1RTU) has moved from RAAF Edinburgh to RAAF Wagga Wagga. RAAF Base Wagga is also the home of the Wagga Wagga RAAF Museum.

===Education===

The sole provider of higher education in Wagga Wagga is the local campus of the multi-campus Charles Sturt University, located on the outskirts of the suburb of Estella. The university was established on 1 July 1989 following the enactment of The Charles Sturt University Act, 1989 and involved the merger of several existing separately-administered Colleges of Advanced Education including the Riverina College of Advanced Education in Wagga Wagga. At the time of its establishment it became the ninth university in the state and its inaugural vice-chancellor was C.D. Blake AO who at the time was the principal of the Riverina College.

The Riverina Institute, a collection of TAFE institute campuses has its headquarters in Wagga Wagga and Wagga is home to three campuses. The Primary Industries Centre, at North Wagga Wagga is set on 250 hectares and runs courses on agriculture and horticulture. The National Aerospace Training Centre of Excellence, at RAAF Base Wagga provides training support to the Australian Defence Force aerospace traineeship program. The commercial contract with the ADF is the largest technical training contract in Australia. In addition Wagga Wagga is home to eight secondary schools and 22 primary schools.

===Government===

Local government for the city is provided by the Wagga Wagga City Council. As well as Wagga Wagga itself the City Council area includes the outlying towns of Tarcutta, Ladysmith, Mangoplah, Collingullie and Uranquinty covering an area of 4,824 km2. The local government area was formed as a result of the amalgamation of the City of Wagga Wagga with the Mitchell and Kyeamba Shires in 1981. The council itself consists of 9 councillors elected for a four-year term and from these a mayor and deputy mayor are elected each year by the council.

Wagga Wagga is the largest city in the Australian House of Representatives electorate of Riverina, currently represented by Michael McCormack of the National Party. At the state level, the city is represented in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly by Joe McGirr, Independent member for the Electoral district of Wagga Wagga.

Allen&#x27;s Coaches of Coolamon and Junee Buses provide weekday connections to Coolamon (routes 1W, 2W and 3W) and Junee (routes 21–25) respectively.

Wagga Radio Cabs run taxis 24/7 in the city with taxi ranks at Station Place, Forsyth Street, Gurwood Street, Wagga Wagga Base Hospital and Kooringal Mall.

Baylis Street in the CBD was a thoroughfare for the Olympic Highway until the Gobbagombalin Bridge (referred to locally as the &quot;Gobba Bridge&quot; and is believed to be the longest continuous-span viaduct in New South Wales) about 6 km northwest of the CBD was opened on 26 July 1997. The Sturt Highway passes through the centre of Wagga Wagga.

Wagga Wagga railway station is located on the Main Southern railway line with twice daily XPT rail services provided by NSW TrainLink, the state owned passenger rail service.

===Airport===
Wagga Wagga Airport at Forest Hill has scheduled daily flights to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane operated by two carriers, Rex Airlines and QantasLink bringing approximately 210,000 passengers through the region every year. Coupled with Rex&#x27;s major maintenance base and the Australian Airline Pilot Academy (AAPA), the Airport is one of the busiest in regional Australia. The airport itself is owned by the Royal Australian Air Force and the civil side is leased by the Wagga Wagga City Council. The sealed runway can cater for aircraft up to Boeing 737-800 and Airbus A321.

==Sport==
Wagga&#x27;s location approximately midway between Melbourne and Sydney on the &quot;Barassi Line&quot; contributes to high levels of football participation in all codes: Australian rules football, Rugby league, Rugby union and Soccer. Other popular sports in Wagga include cricket, tennis, and lawn bowls.

The city has eight Australian rules football clubs, including: Mangoplah–Cookardinia United-Eastlakes, Wagga Tigers, Collingullie–Wagga and Turvey Park in the Riverina Football League and East Wagga-Kooringal, North Wagga and Rivcoll (CSU) in the Farrer Football League.

East Wagga is home to the Wagga Wagga Gun Club and the Australian Clay Target Association, which has an Olympic-standard clay target shooting range and &quot;The Range&quot; function centre, at 308 Copland Street. The centre, which opened in October 2018, was made possible through a NSW Government grant of $5.5 million.

===&quot;Wagga Effect&quot;===
The &quot;Wagga Effect&quot; is a term that has been used frequently in the Australian media to describe the disproportionately large number of elite sportsmen and women that originate from the city. It is speculated that the phenomenon may arise in rural areas where the population is large enough to sustain the presence of a large number of sporting codes, but small enough to ensure that talented individuals are exposed to adult-level competition at an earlier age.

Notable sportspeople from Wagga include:
* Australian rules football – Wayne Carey, Paul Hawke, Paul Kelly, Bill Mohr, Cameron Mooney, John Pitura, Adam Schneider, Matt Suckling, Isaac Smith, Harry Cunningham, Dougal Howard, Harry Himmelberg, Gabrielle Colvin and Ally Morphett
* Cricket – Geoff Lawson, Michael Slater, and Mark Taylor
* Golf – US PGA Championship winner Steve Elkington
* Horse racing – jockey Scobie Breasley
* Rugby league – Greg Brentnall, Ben Cross, Marc Glanville, Chris Mortimer, Peter Mortimer, Steve Mortimer, Jamie Soward, and Peter Sterling
* Rugby union – Nathan Hines and Nathan Sharpe
* Rugby sevens – Alicia Quirk
* Soccer – Australia women&#x27;s national soccer team representative Sally Shipard
* Tennis – Tony Roche, 1966 French Open champion, and later a coach, is from Tarcutta near Wagga
* Triathlon – Brad Kahlefeldt, Commonwealth Games Gold Medallist, Olympian, and World Champion
* Snooker – Quinten Hann, former Elite &#x27;Top 16&#x27; player and world championship quarter-finalist.

In 1993, the City of Wagga Wagga instituted a Sporting Hall of Fame as part of the Museum of the Riverina dedicated to the elite sportspeople from Wagga Wagga and the surrounding area.

===5 o&#x27;clock wave===
According to the local urban myth, at precisely 5 o&#x27;clock a giant wave moves down the Murrumbidgee River, a result of water being released from the Blowering and Burrinjuck Dams. The wave is said to continue down river at high speed, and visitors are told it is so powerful that surfers can ride it along the meandering river until it reaches the town of Narrandera.

==Recreation and culture==

===Recreation===

The Murrumbidgee River at Wagga Wagga forms into a large sandy beach, and is a popular location for swimming, picnics and barbecues during the warmer months. Between 1977 and 1995 the beach played host to the Gumi Races, where people were encouraged to make rafts from inner tubing and sabotage their competition by throwing rotten eggs and flour at them. Visitors and local residents still take every opportunity during the warmer months to float down the river from the area known as &quot;The Rocks&quot; some 600 metres upstream from the main beach area.
Wollundry Lagoon, Lake Albert and parks provide recreational facilities. Sporting facilities include the Oasis Regional Aquatic Centre, with Australia&#x27;s only wave ball. Wagga Wagga Civic Theatre and the Forum 6 Cinemas provide entertainment venues. The Wagga Wagga Botanic Gardens are home to a music bowl, a small zoo with a walk through aviary, a tree chapel, Willans Hill Miniature Railway and a camellia garden. Located on the banks of the Wollundry lagoon and officially opened in 1927, the Victory Memorial Gardens were established amidst some controversy as a tribute to those who fought and died in World War I.

===Culture===

The main cultural precinct for Wagga Wagga can be found in central Wagga Wagga, at the Wagga Wagga Civic Centre on the banks of Wollundry Lagoon. The precinct includes the Wagga Wagga Civic Theatre, Museum of the Riverina, Wagga Wagga Regional Art Gallery and Wagga Wagga City Library.

The Wagga Wagga Civic Theatre was officially opened in 1963 at a cost of £165,000. During its design and construction and again after opening the theatre was the subject of severe criticism. Critics lamented the destruction of rose gardens removed to allow construction, the size of the orchestra pit, the amount of seating (497 seats) as well as the design of the feature mural. A considerable refurbishment was carried out in the 1990s and now the theatre is regarded as one of the best in regional Australia, playing host to national and international touring acts.
The Wagga Wagga Regional Art Gallery hosts local collections and travelling exhibitions and has space for an artist in residence. The centrepiece of the collection is the National Art Glass Gallery, a nationally significant collection of studio art glass hosted in a separate, specially designed gallery. The collection was first established by the former director of the Wagga Wagga Regional Art Gallery, Judy Le Lievre, in response to a request by the Australia Council for regional galleries to develop a specialised collection to avoid duplication and competition. The collection consists of around 400 works, making it the largest studio glass collection in Australia.

The Museum of the Riverina was established in 1967 by the Wagga Wagga and District Historical Society. Wagga Wagga City Council took over its operations in the late 1990s and it now operates at two sites. The Historic Council Chambers site on the corner of Baylis and Morrow streets in central Wagga, hosts travelling exhibitions and the main site at the Botanic Gardens is home to the main collection including the Wagga Wagga Sporting Hall of Fame. The museum has an important collection of memorabilia about the Tichborne Case, including a set of four rare plaster figurines depicting characters from the trial, a complete set of hard-bound court transcripts and a monumental painting entitled &quot;The Tichborne Trial&quot; painted in 1874 by Nathan Hughes, which hangs in the city&#x27;s council chambers.

The Wagga Wagga Jazz Festival was established in 1995 and has featured a range of Australian and international musicians. Established in 1976 as the Riverina Trucking Company and renamed in 1983, the Riverina Theatre Company is one of Australia&#x27;s longest running regional theatre companies and runs a full program of events each year at the Riverina Playhouse, which is located on the banks of the Murrumbidgee River and owned by Charles Sturt University.

Notable artists and performers from Wagga Wagga include poet Dame Mary Gilmore, who is featured on the Australian ten-dollar note and veteran actor Bill Kerr. Former Yellow Wiggle, Sam Moran, is from Wagga Wagga, having replaced the original Yellow Wiggle, Greg Page, in November 2006. The fictional creation of satirist Barry Humphries, Dame Edna Everage was said to have been born in Wagga Wagga.

Frank Ottenson wrote a song &quot;Wagga Wagga&quot; about the city in 1942, calling it a &#x27;Riverina paradise&#x27;. It was recorded by Tom Davidson and his Orchestra.

Wagga has strong cultural ties with three international sister cities which form part of a twinning program. Wagga&#x27;s sister cities are Leavenworth, Kansas in the United States, which was established in 1962; Nördlingen in Germany, established in 1967; and Kunming in China, mutually established in 1988.

In April 2020, The Wagga council voted to cut ties with China&#x27;s Kunming city. A week later they voted again, rejoining Kunming as a sister city.

Wagga has captured the interest of writers, novelists and songwriters over the years. Specifically the city&#x27;s international notoriety surrounding Arthur Orton and the Tichborne Case attracted a visit from Mark Twain when he visited Australia in the 1890s. Wagga has been home to a number of famous Australian writers, including Frank Moorhouse who worked as a journalist on the city&#x27;s daily newspaper, and the poets Mary Gilmore and Barcroft Boake.

Humourist Spike Milligan was quite taken with the double-barrelled names of Australian towns, and presented a show called &quot;Australia: From Woy Woy to Wagga Wagga&quot;.

In other cases the town&#x27;s name has been directly referred to as part of the content of songs and novels. For example, the song &quot;Don&#x27;t call Wagga Wagga Wagga&quot;, written by Australian country music artists Greg Champion and Jim Haynes, was a minor hit on the Australian country charts and is a light-hearted take on the habit of Australians to refer to double named towns by one name only. Other examples include the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series of fantasy novels, where the character Gilderoy Lockhart claimed to have defeated the &quot;Wagga Wagga Werewolf&quot;, the Bryce Courtenay book &quot;The Power of One&quot;, where the main character Peekay is said to have a cousin Lenny from Wagga Wagga Australia, the Bryce Courtenay book &quot;Jessica&quot; has several passages that take place in Wagga Wagga, including the judgement of Billy Simple, and the Robert G. Barrett novel, &quot;Mud Crab Boogie&quot; which is partially set in Wagga Wagga.

<text>Skippers are a group of butterflies placed in the family Hesperiidae within the order Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies). They were previously placed in a separate superfamily, Hesperioidea, but have since been placed the superfamily Papilionoidea (the butterflies). They are named for their quick, darting flight habits. Most have their antenna tips modified into narrow, hook-like projections. Moreover, skippers mostly lack wing-coupling structure available in most moths. More than 3500 species of skippers are recognized, and they occur worldwide, but with the greatest diversity in the Neotropical regions of Central and South America.

==Description and systematics==

Traditionally, the Hesperiidae were placed in a monotypic superfamily Hesperioidea, because they are morphologically distinct from other Rhopalocera (butterflies), which mostly belong to the typical butterfly superfamily Papilionoidea. The third and rather small butterfly superfamily is the moth-butterflies (Hedyloidea), which are restricted to the Neotropics, but recent phylogenetic analyses suggest the traditional Papilionoidea are paraphyletic, thus the subfamilies should be reorganized to reflect true cladistic relationships.

Collectively, these three groups of butterflies share many characteristics, especially in the egg, larval, and pupal stages. Nevertheless, skippers have the antennae clubs hooked backward like a crochet hook, while the typical butterflies have club-like tips to their antennae, and moth-butterflies have feathered or pectinate (comb-shaped) antennae similar to moths. Skippers also have generally stockier bodies and larger compound eyes than the other two groups, with stronger wing muscles in the plump thorax, in this resembling many moths more than the other two butterfly lineages do. Unlike, for example, the Arctiinae, though, their wings are usually small in proportion to their bodies. Some have larger wings, but only rarely as large in proportion to the body as in other butterflies. Skippers keep their wings usually angled upwards or spread out when at rest, and rarely fold them up completely.



The wings are usually well-rounded with more or less sharply tipped forewings. Some have prominent hindwing tails, and others have more angled wings; the skippers&#x27; basic wing shapes vary not much by comparison to the Papilionoidea, though. Most have a fairly drab coloration of browns and greys; some are more boldly black-and-white. Yellow, red, and blue hues are less often found, but some largely brown species are quite richly colored, too. Green colors and metallic iridescence are generally absent. Sexual dichromatism is present in some; males may have a blackish streak or patch of scent scales on their forewings.
Many species of skippers look very alike. For example, some species in the genera &quot;Amblyscirtes&quot;, &quot;Erynnis&quot; (duskywings), and &quot;Hesperia&quot; (branded skippers) cannot currently be distinguished in the field even by experts. The only reliable method of telling them apart involves dissection and microscopic examination of the genitalia, which have characteristic structures that prevent mating except between conspecifics.

==Subfamilies==
The roughly 3500 species of skippers are now classified in these subfamilies:
* Barcinae
* Katreinae
* Coeliadinae – awls, awlets, and policemen (about 75 species)
* Euschemoninae – regent skipper (monotypic)
* Eudaminae – dicot skippers
* Chamundinae
* Pyrginae – spread-winged skippers and firetips (including Pyrrhopyginae)
* Heteropterinae – skipperlings (about 150 species)
* Hesperiinae – grass skippers (over 2000 species)
* Megathyminae – giant skippers (about 18 species; doubtfully distinct from Hesperiinae)
* Trapezitinae – Australian skippers (about 60 species)

<text>The chimney swift (Chaetura pelagica) is a bird belonging to the swift family Apodidae. A member of the genus &quot;Chaetura&quot;, it is closely related to both Vaux&#x27;s swift and Chapman&#x27;s swift; in the past, the three were sometimes considered to be conspecific. It has no subspecies. The chimney swift is a medium-sized, sooty gray bird with very long, slender wings and very short legs. Like all swifts, it is incapable of perching on flat surfaces, and can only perch on vertical surfaces. Many fly around all day and only come down at night when roosting.

The chimney swift feeds primarily on flying insects, but also on airborne spiders. It generally mates for life. It builds a bracket nest of twigs and saliva stuck to a vertical surface, which is almost always a human-built structure, typically a chimney; historically (before European colonists built chimneys), they nested in hollow trees (including old pileated woodpecker nest holes), a few still do so, though only rarely. The female lays eggs. The altricial young hatch after and fledge a month later. The average chimney swift lives .

==Taxonomy and systematics==
When Carl Linnaeus first described the chimney swift in 1758, he named it , believing it to be a swallow. This misconception continued well into the 1800s, with ornithologists calling it &quot;American Swallow&quot; (e.g. Mark Catesby) or &quot;Chimney Swallow&quot; (e.g. John James Audubon). In 1825, James Francis Stephens moved this and other small, short-tailed New World swifts to the genus &quot;Chaetura&quot;, where it has since remained, although some authorities in the 1800s assigned it to a variety of now obsolete genera. It has no subspecies. The chimney swift&#x27;s closest relative is Vaux&#x27;s swift (&quot;C. vauxi&quot;). Scientists believe that the two species evolved from a common ancestor that was forced to North America&#x27;s southeastern and southwestern corners by glacial advances. Separated for millennia by vast ice sheets, the survivors evolved into two species which are still separated by a wide gap across the continent&#x27;s midsection. It is also closely related to the Chapman&#x27;s swift (&quot;C. chapmani&quot;); in the past, the three were sometimes treated as a single species.

The chimney swift&#x27;s genus name, &quot;Chaetura&quot;, is a combination of two Ancient Greek words: &quot;chaite&quot;, which means &quot;bristle&quot; or &quot;spine&quot;, and &quot;oura&quot; which means &quot;tail&quot;. This is an apt description of the bird&#x27;s tail, as the shafts of all ten tail feathers (rectrices) end in sharp, protruding points. The specific name &quot;pelagica&quot; is derived from the Greek word &quot;pelagikos&quot;, which means &quot;of the sea&quot;. This is thought to be a reference to its nomadic lifestyle rather than to any reference to the sea, a theory strengthened by the later assignment of the specific name &quot;pelasgia&quot; (after the nomadic Pelasgi tribe of ancient Greece) to the same species by other ornithologists. Its common name refers to its preferred nesting site and its speedy flight.

==Description==

This is a medium-sized swift, measuring from in length, with a wingspan of and a weight ranging from . The sexes are identical in plumage, though males average slightly heavier than females. The adult&#x27;s plumage is a dark sooty olive above and grayish brown below, with a slightly paler rump and uppertail covert feathers, and a significantly paler throat. Its upperparts are the most uniformly colored of all the &quot;Chaetura&quot; swifts, showing little contrast between back and rump. Its beak is black, as are its feet and legs. Its iris is dark brown. The juvenile plumage (held by young birds for their first few months after fledging) is very similar to that of adults, but with whitish tips to the outer webs of the secondaries and tertials.

The chimney swift&#x27;s wings are slender, curved and long, extending as much as beyond the bird&#x27;s tail when folded. Its wingtips are pointed, which helps to decrease air turbulence (and therefore drag) during flight. Its humerus (the bone in the inner part of the wing) is quite short, while the bones farther out (more distally) along the wing are elongated, a combination which allows the bird to flap very quickly. In flight, it holds its wings stiffly, alternating between rapid, quivering flaps and longer glides. Its flight profile is widely described as a &quot;cigar with wings&quot;—a description first used by Roger Tory Peterson. Although the bird often appears to beat its wings asynchronously during flight, photographic and stroboscopic studies have shown that it beats them in unison. The illusion that it does otherwise is heightened by its very fast and highly erratic flight, with many rapid changes of direction.

The legs of the chimney swift, like those of all swifts, are very short. Its feet are small but strong, with very short toes that are tipped with sharp, curved claws. The toes are anisodactyl—three forward, one back—like those of most birds, but the chimney swift can swivel its back toe (its hallux) forward to help it get a better grip. Unlike the legs and feet of most birds, those of the chimney swift have no scales; instead, they are covered with smooth skin.

Its tail is short and square, measuring only in length. All ten of its tail feathers have shafts which extend as much as beyond the vanes, ending in sharp, stiff points. These help the bird to prop itself against vertical surfaces.

The chimney swift has large, deep set eyes. These are protected by small patches of coarse, black, bristly feathers, which are located in front of each eye. The swift can change the angle of these feathers, which may help to reduce glare. It is far-sighted and, like some birds of prey, this swift is bifoveal: each eye having both a temporal and a central fovea. These are small depressions in the retina where visual acuity is highest, and help to make its vision especially . Like most vertebrates, it is able to focus both eyes at once; however, it is also able to focus a single eye independently.

Its bill is very small, with a culmen that measures a mere in length. However, its gape is huge, extending back below its eyes, and allowing the bird to open its mouth very widely. Unlike many insectivorous birds, it lacks rictal bristles at the base of the beak.

===Similar species===
The chimney swift looks very much like the closely related Vaux&#x27;s swift, but is slightly larger, with relatively longer wings and tail, slower wingbeats and a greater tendency to soar. It tends to be darker on the breast and rump than the Vaux&#x27;s swift, though there is some overlap in plumage coloring. It can be as much as 30 percent heavier than Vaux&#x27;s swift, and its wings, which are proportionately narrower, show a pronounced bulge in the inner secondaries. The chimney swift is smaller, paler and shorter tailed than the black swift. In Central America, it is most similar to Chapman&#x27;s swift, but it is paler (matte olive rather than glossy black) and has a stronger contrast between its pale throat and the rest of its underparts than does its more uniformly colored relative.

==Distribution and habitat==

A widespread breeding visitor to much of the eastern half of the United States and the southern reaches of eastern Canada, the chimney swift migrates to South America for the winter. It is a rare summer visitor to the western U.S, and has been recorded as a vagrant in Anguilla, Barbados, Greenland, Jamaica, Portugal, the United Kingdom and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It is found over open country, savanna, wooded slopes and humid forests.

The chimney swift&#x27;s wintering grounds were only discovered in 1944, when bands from birds banded (ringed) in North America were recovered in Peru. An indigenous Peruvian had been wearing the bands as a necklace.

==Behavior==
The chimney swift is a species, and is seldom seen alone. It generally hunts in groups of two or three, migrates in loose flocks of 6–20, and (once the breeding season is over) sleeps in huge communal roosts of hundreds or thousands of birds. Like all swifts, it is a superb aerialist, and only rarely seen at rest. It drinks on the wing, skimming the surface of the water with its beak. It also bathes on the wing, gliding above the surface of a body of water, briefly smacking its breast into the water, then flying off again, shaking its feathers as it goes. It has been recorded by pilots flying more than a mile above the surface of the earth, including one seen at . It is incapable of perching upright like most birds do; instead, it clings to vertical surfaces. If it is disturbed while at rest, the chimney swift will clap its wings loudly once or twice against its body; it does this either in place, or while dropping down several feet to a lower location. This behavior can result in a loud &quot;thundering&quot; sound if large roosts of the birds are disturbed. The sound is thought to be the bird&#x27;s way of scaring away potential predators.

===Feeding===
Like all swifts, the chimney swift forages on the wing. Studies have shown that of its food items are flying insects, including various species of flies, ants, wasps, bees, whiteflies, aphids, scale insects, stoneflies and mayflies. It also eats airborne spiders drifting on their threads. It is an important predator of pest species such as the red imported fire ant and the clover root curculio. Researchers estimate that a pair of adults provisioning a nest with three youngsters consume the weight equivalent of at least insects per day. Like many bird species, the chimney swift periodically coughs up pellets composed of indigestible bits of prey items.

During the breeding season, at least half of the chimney swift&#x27;s forays occur within of its nest; however, it ranges up to away. While most of its food is seized following aerial pursuit, some is gleaned from the foliage of trees; the bird hovers near the ends of branches or drops through upper canopy levels. The chimney swift generally flies quite high, though it descends during cold or rainy weather. When feeding, it regularly occurs in small groups, and sometimes hunts with swallows, particularly barn swallows and purple martins; in mixed-species flocks, it is typically among the lower fliers. There is at least one record of a chimney swift attempting to steal a dragonfly from a purple martin, and it has been observed chasing other purple martins. In general, it is a diurnal feeder which remains active into early evening. However, there are records, particularly during migration periods, of chimney swifts feeding well after dark over brightly lit buildings.

The species shows two-weight peaks each year: one at the start of the breeding season, and a higher one shortly before it begins its migration south in the autumn. Its lowest weights are typically recorded during the breeding season, when it also begins a complete molt of its plumage. The chimney swift&#x27;s weight gain before migration is smaller than that of some passerines, suggesting that it must refuel en route at various stopover points.

===Breeding===
The chimney swift is a monogamous breeder which normally mates for life, though a small percentage of birds change partners. Pairs perform display flights together, gliding with their wings upraised in a steep &quot;V&quot;, and sometimes rocking from side to side. Breeding birds arrive as early as mid-March in the southern U.S., and late-April to mid-May in the Canadian provinces.

Before the arrival of European colonists into North America, the chimney swift nested in hollow trees; now, it uses human-built structures almost exclusively. While the occasional nest is still built in a hollow tree (or, exceptionally, in an abandoned woodpecker nest), most are now found inside chimneys, with smaller numbers in airshafts, the dark corners of lightly used buildings, cisterns, or wells. The nest is a shallow bracket made of sticks, which the birds gather in flight, breaking them off trees. The sticks are glued together (and the nest to a vertical surface) with copious amounts of the bird&#x27;s saliva. During the breeding season, each adult&#x27;s salivary glands more than double in size, from in the non-breeding season to during the breeding season.

Unlike some swift species, which mate in flight, chimney swifts mate while clinging to a vertical surface near their nest. They daily, until the clutch is complete. The female typically lays , though clutch sizes range from . The eggs, which are long and elliptical in shape, are moderately glossy, smooth and white, and measure . Each weighs nearly of the female&#x27;s body weight. Incubated by both parents, the eggs hatch after . Baby chimney swifts are altricial—naked, blind and helpless when they hatch. Fledglings leave the nest after a month.

The average chimney swift&#x27;s life span is , but one is known to have lived more than . It was originally banded as an adult, and was recaptured in another banding operation some later.

===Predators and parasites===
Mississippi kites, peregrine falcons and merlins are raptors that are known to take adult chimney swifts in flight, being among the select few avian hunters fast enough to overtake the appropriately named swift on the wing. Eastern screech-owls have been seen attacking colonies, as have non-avian predators including eastern rat snakes, northern raccoons and tree squirrels. These are most likely to take nestlings but may take some nesting adults as well. When disturbed by potential predators (including humans) at the colony, adult chimney swifts slap their wings together after arching back and taking flight, making a very loud noise known either as &quot;booming&quot; or &quot;thunder noises&quot;. When disturbed, nestlings make a loud, raspy &quot;raah, raah, raah&quot; sound. Both sounds seem designed to startle potential predators.

The chimney swift carries a number of internal and external parasites. It is the type host for the nematode species &quot;Aproctella nuda&quot;, the feather mite species &quot;Euchineustathia tricapitosetosa&quot;, and the biting lice species &quot; Dennyus dubius&quot;, and is also known to carry the tapeworm species &quot;Pseudochoanotaenia collocaliae&quot;. Its nest is known to host the Hemiptera species &quot;Cimexopsis nyctali&quot;, which is similar to the bed bug and can (on rare occasions) become a pest species in houses.

===Voice===

The chimney swift has a twittering call, consisting of a rapid series of hard, high-pitched chirps. It sometimes gives single chirps.

==Conservation status==

In 2010, the International Union for Conservation of Nature changed the chimney swift&#x27;s status from least concern to near threatened. In 2018, the IUCN changed the chimney swift&#x27;s status from near threatened to vulnerable. Although the global population is estimated at , it has declined precipitously across the majority of its range. The causes of population declines are largely unclear, but may be related to the alteration of the insect community due to pesticide use in the early half of the 20th century. In Canada, they were listed as threatened by COSEWIC for several years with a likely future listing as a Schedule 1 species of the Species at Risk Act. In the U.S., the chimney swift is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Neither birds nor nests can be removed from chimneys without a federally-issued permit. Populations may have increased historically with the introduction of chimneys to North America by European settlers, providing plentiful nesting opportunities.

After sudden temperature drops, the chimney swift sometimes hunts low over concrete roads (presumably following insect prey drawn to the warmer road), where collisions with vehicles become more likely. Severe storms, such as hurricanes, encountered during migration can seriously impact the chimney&#x27;s swift&#x27;s survival rates. Chimney swifts caught up in 2005&#x27;s Hurricane Wilma were swept as far north as Atlantic Canada and Western Europe, including six reaching Great Britain, the most ever seen there in a single year. More than 700 were found dead. The following year, roost counts in the province of Quebec, Canada showed a decrease of 62 percent, and the overall population in the province was halved.

==History of observation==

In 1899, Mary Day of New Jersey observed a pair of chimney swifts nesting in a chimney, and noted the incubation period was 19 days. The first detailed study of chimney swifts began in 1915 by self-taught ornithologist Althea Sherman in Iowa. She commissioned a 28 foot tall tower, of a similar design to a chimney, with ladders and peep holes installed to facilitate observation. Chimney swifts nested in her tower, and for over fifteen years, she meticulously recorded her observations, filling over 400 pages. Sherman remarked that although the tower had been designed with a limited knowledge of the nesting behavior of chimney swifts, after many years of observation she believed that the original design was ideal.

<doc id="349319" wikidata="Q15067276" url="?curid=349319" title="Healthcare industry">
<text>The healthcare industry (also called the medical industry or health economy) is an aggregation and integration of sectors within the economic system that provides goods and services to treat patients with curative, preventive, rehabilitative, and palliative care. It encompasses the creation and commercialization of products and services conducive to the preservation and restoration of well-being. The contemporary healthcare sector comprises three fundamental facets, namely services, products, and finance. It can be further subdivided into numerous sectors and categories and relies on interdisciplinary teams of highly skilled professionals and paraprofessionals to address the healthcare requirements of both individuals and communities.

The healthcare industry is one of the world&#x27;s largest and fastest-growing industries. Consuming over 10 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) of most developed nations, health care can form an enormous part of a country&#x27;s economy. U.S. healthcare spending grew 2.7 percent in 2021, reaching $4.3 trillion or $12,914 per person.  As a share of the nation&#x27;s Gross Domestic Product, health spending accounted for 18.3 percent. The per capita expenditure on health and pharmaceuticals in OECD countries has steadily grown from a couple of hundred in the 1970s to an average of US$4&#x27;000 per year in current purchasing power parities.

==Backgrounds==
For the purpose of finance and management, the healthcare industry is typically divided into several areas. As a basic framework for defining the sector, the United Nations International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) categorizes the healthcare industry as generally consisting of:
# Hospital activities;
# Medical and dental practice activities;
# &quot;Other human health activities&quot;.

This third class involves activities of or under the supervision of, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, scientific or diagnostic laboratories, pathology clinics, residential health facilities, or other allied health professions, e.g. in the field of optometry, hydrotherapy, medical massage, yoga therapy, music therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, chiropody, homoeopathy, chiropractic, acupuncture, etc.

The Global Industry Classification Standard and the Industry Classification Benchmark further distinguish the industry into two main groups:

# healthcare equipment and services; and
# pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and related life sciences.

The healthcare equipment and services group consists of companies and entities that provide medical equipment, medical supplies, and healthcare services, such as hospitals, home healthcare providers, and nursing homes. The latter listed industry group includes companies that produce biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and miscellaneous scientific services.

Other approaches to defining the scope of the healthcare industry tend to adopt a broader definition, also including other key actions related to health, such as education and training of health professionals, regulation and management of health services delivery, provision of traditional and complementary medicines, and administration of health insurance., chiropractic, acupuncture, etc.
==Providers and professionals==

A healthcare provider is an institution (such as a hospital or clinic) or person (such as a physician, nurse, allied health professional or community health worker) that provides preventive, curative, promotional, rehabilitative or palliative care services in a systematic way to individuals, families or communities.

The World Health Organization estimates there are 9.2 million physicians, 19.4 million nurses and midwives, 1.9 million dentists and other dentistry personnel, 2.6 million pharmacists and other pharmaceutical personnel, and over 1.3 million community health workers worldwide, making the health care industry one of the largest segments of the workforce.

The medical industry is also supported by many professions that do not directly provide health care itself, but are part of the management and support of the health care system. The incomes of managers and administrators, underwriters, and medical malpractice attorneys, marketers, investors, and shareholders of for-profit services, all are attributable to health care costs.

In 2017, healthcare costs paid to hospitals, physicians, nursing homes, diagnostic laboratories, pharmacies, medical device manufacturers, and other components of the healthcare system, consumed 17.9 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States, the largest of any country in the world. It is expected that the health share of the Gross domestic product (GDP) will continue its upward trend, reaching 19.9 percent of GDP by 2025. In 2001, for the OECD countries the average was 8.4 percent with the United States (13.9%), Switzerland (10.9%), and Germany (10.7%) being the top three. US health care expenditures totaled US$2.2 trillion in 2006. According to Health Affairs, US$7,498 be spent on every woman, man and child in the United States in 2007, 20 percent of all spending. Costs are projected to increase to $12,782 by 2016.

The government does not ensure all-inclusive health care to every one of its residents. However, certain freely supported healthcare programs help to accommodate a portion of people who are elderly, disabled, or poor. Elected law guarantees community to crisis benefits paying little respect to the capacity to pay. Those without health protection scope are relied upon to pay secretly for therapeutic administrations. Health protection is costly and hospital expenses are overwhelmingly the most well-known explanation behind individual liquidation in the United States.

==Spending==

Expand the OECD charts below to see the breakdown: 
*&quot;Government/compulsory&quot;: Government spending and compulsory health insurance.
*&quot;Voluntary&quot;: Voluntary health insurance and private funds such as households’ out-of-pocket payments, NGOs and private corporations.

==Health system==

The delivery of healthcare services—from primary care to secondary and tertiary levels of care—is the most visible part of any healthcare system, both to users and the general public. There are many ways of providing healthcare in the modern world. The place of delivery may be in the home, the community, the workplace, or in health facilities. The most common way is face-to-face delivery, where care provider and patient see each other in person. This is what occurs in general medicine in most countries. However, with modern telecommunications technology, &quot;in absentia&quot; health care or Tele-Health is becoming more common. This could be when practitioner and patient communicate over the phone, video conferencing, the internet, email, text messages, or any other form of non-face-to-face communication. Practices like these are especial applicable to rural regions in developed nations. These services are typically implemented on a clinic-by-clinic basis.

Improving access, coverage and quality of health services depends on the ways services are organized and managed, and on the incentives influencing providers and users. In market-based health care systems, for example in the United States, such services are usually paid for by the patient or through the patient&#x27;s health insurance company. Other mechanisms include government-financed systems (such as the National Health Service in the United Kingdom). In many poorer countries, development aid, as well as funding through charities or volunteers, help support the delivery and financing of health care services among large segments of the population.

The structure of healthcare charges can also vary dramatically among countries. For instance, Chinese hospital charges tend toward 50% for drugs, another major percentage for equipment, and a small percentage for healthcare professional fees. China has implemented a long-term transformation of its healthcare industry, beginning in the 1980s. Over the first twenty-five years of this transformation, government contributions to healthcare expenditures have dropped from 36% to 15%, with the burden of managing this decrease falling largely on patients. Also over this period, a small proportion of state-owned hospitals have been privatized. As an incentive to privatization, foreign investment in hospitals—up to 70% ownership has been encouraged.

Healthcare systems dictate the means by which people and institutions pay for and receive health services. Models vary based on the country with the responsibility of payment ranging from the public (social insurance) and private health insurers to the consumer-driven by patients themselves. These systems finance and organize the services delivered by providers. A two-tier system of public and private is common.

The American Academy of Family Physicians defines four commonly utilized systems of payment:

=== Beveridge model ===
Named after British economist and social reformer William Beveridge, the Beveridge model sees healthcare financed and provided by a central government. The system was initially proposed in his 1942 report, &quot;Social Insurance and Allied Services—&quot;known as the Beveridge Report. The system is the guiding basis of the modern British healthcare model enacted post-World War II. It has been utilized in numerous countries, including The United Kingdom, Cuba, and New Zealand.

The system sees all healthcare services— which are provided and financed solely by the government. This single payer system is financed through national taxation. Typically, the government owns and runs the clinics and hospitals, meaning that doctors are employees of the government. However, depending on the specific system, public providers can be accompanied by private doctors who collect fees from the government. The underlying principle of this system is that healthcare is a fundamental human right. Thus, the government provides universal coverage to all citizens. Generally, the Beveridge model yields a low cost per capita compared to other systems.

=== Bismarck model ===
The Bismarck system was first employed in 1883 by Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. In this system, insurance is mandated by the government and is typically sold on a non-profit basis. In many cases, employers and employees finance insurers through payroll deduction. In a pure Bismarck system, access to insurance is seen as a right solely predicated on labor status. The system attempts to cover all working citizens, meaning patients cannot be excluded from insurance due to pre-existing conditions. While care is privatized, it is closely regulated by the state through fixed procedure pricing. This means that most insurance claims are reimbursed without challenge, creating a low administrative burden. Archetypal implementation of the Bismarck system can be seen in Germany&#x27;s nationalized healthcare. Similar systems can be found in France, Belgium, and Japan.

=== National health insurance model ===
The national insurance model shares and mixes elements from both the Bismarck and Beveridge models. The emergence of the National Health Insurance model is cited as a response to the challenges presented by the traditional Bismarck and Beveridge systems. For instance, it is difficult for Bismarck Systems to contend with aging populations, as these demographics are less economically active. Ultimately, this model has more flexibility than a traditional Bismarck or Beveridge model, as it can pull effective practices from both systems as needed.

This model maintains private providers, but payment comes directly from the government. Insurance plans control costs by paying for limited services. In some instances, citizens can opt out of public insurance for private insurance plans. However, large public insurance programs provide the government with bargaining power, allowing them to drive down prices for certain services and medication. In Canada, for instance, drug prices have been extensively lowered by the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board. Examples of this model can be found in Canada, Taiwan, and South Korea.

=== Out-of-pocket model ===
In areas with low levels of government stability or poverty, there is often no mechanism for ensuring that health costs are covered by a party other than the individual. In this case, patients must pay for services on their own. Payment methods can vary—ranging from physical currency, to trade for goods and services. Those that cannot afford treatment typically remain sick or die.

=== Inefficiencies ===
In countries where insurance is not mandated, there can be underinsurance—especially among disadvantaged and impoverished communities that can not afford private plans. The UK National Health System creates excellent patient outcomes and mandates universal coverage but also has large lag times for treatment. Critics argue that reforms brought about by the Health and Social Care Act 2012 only proved to fragment the system, leading to high regulatory burden and long treatment delays. In his review of NHS leadership in 2015, Sir Stuart Rose concluded that &quot;the NHS is drowning in bureaucracy.&quot;

<doc id="349336" wikidata="Q2725319" url="?curid=349336" title="Integral geometry">
<text>In mathematics, integral geometry is the theory of measures on a geometrical space invariant under the symmetry group of that space. In more recent times, the meaning has been broadened to include a view of invariant (or equivariant) transformations from the space of functions on one geometrical space to the space of functions on another geometrical space. Such transformations often take the form of integral transforms such as the Radon transform and its generalizations.

== Classical context ==
Integral geometry as such first emerged as an attempt to refine certain statements of geometric probability theory. The early work of Luis Santaló and Wilhelm Blaschke was in this connection. It follows from the classic theorem of Crofton expressing the length of a plane curve as an expectation of the number of intersections with a random line. Here the word &#x27;random&#x27; must be interpreted as subject to correct symmetry considerations.

There is a sample space of lines, one on which the affine group of the plane acts. A probability measure is sought on this space, invariant under the symmetry group. If, as in this case, we can find a unique such invariant measure, then that solves the problem of formulating accurately what &#x27;random line&#x27; means and expectations become integrals with respect to that measure. (Note for example that the phrase &#x27;random chord of a circle&#x27; can be used to construct some paradoxes—for example Bertrand&#x27;s paradox.)

We can therefore say that integral geometry in this sense is the application of probability theory (as axiomatized by Kolmogorov) in the context of the Erlangen programme of Klein. The content of the theory is effectively that of invariant (smooth) measures on (preferably compact) homogeneous spaces of Lie groups; and the evaluation of integrals of the differential forms.

A very celebrated case is the problem of Buffon&#x27;s needle: drop a needle on a floor made of planks and calculate the probability the needle lies across a crack. Generalising, this theory is applied to various stochastic processes concerned with geometric and incidence questions. See stochastic geometry.

One of the most interesting theorems in this form of integral geometry is Hadwiger&#x27;s theorem in the Euclidean setting. Subsequently Hadwiger-type theorems were established in various settings, notably in hermitian geometry, using advanced tools from valuation theory.

The more recent meaning of integral geometry is that of Sigurdur Helgason and Israel Gelfand. It deals more specifically with integral transforms, modeled on the Radon transform. Here the underlying geometrical incidence relation (points lying on lines, in Crofton&#x27;s case) is seen in a freer light, as the site for an integral transform composed as &quot;pullback onto the incidence graph&quot; and then &quot;push forward&quot;.

<doc id="349339" wikidata="Q2006877" url="?curid=349339" title="Georgian era">
<text>The Georgian era was a period in British history from 1714 to , named after the Hanoverian kings George I, George II, George III and George IV. The definition of the Georgian era is also often extended to include the relatively short reign of William IV, which ended with his death in 1837. The subperiod that is the Regency era is defined by the regency of George IV as Prince of Wales during the illness of his father George III. The transition to the Victorian era was characterized in religion, social values, and the arts by a shift in tone away from rationalism and toward romanticism and mysticism.

The term &quot;&quot; is typically used in the contexts of social and political history and architecture. The term &quot;Augustan literature&quot; is often used for Augustan drama, Augustan poetry and Augustan prose in the period 1700–1740s. The term &quot;Augustan&quot; refers to the acknowledgement of the influence of Latin literature from the ancient Roman Republic.

The term &quot;Georgian era&quot; is not applied to the time of the two 20th-century British kings of this name, George V and George VI. Those periods are simply referred to as &quot;Georgian&quot;.

== Arts and culture ==
Georgian society and its preoccupations were well portrayed in the novels of writers such as Daniel Defoe, Jonathan Swift, Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding, Laurence Sterne, Mary Shelley and Jane Austen, characterised by the architecture of Robert Adam, John Nash and James Wyatt and the emergence of the Gothic Revival style, which hearkened back to a supposed golden age of building design.

The flowering of the arts was most vividly shown in the emergence of the Romantic poets, principally through Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, Percy Bysshe Shelley, William Blake, John Keats, Lord Byron and Robert Burns. Their work ushered in a new era of poetry, characterised by vivid and colourful language, evocative of elevating ideas and themes.

The paintings of Thomas Gainsborough, Sir Joshua Reynolds and the young J. M. W. Turner and John Constable illustrated the changing world of the Georgian period – as did the work of designers like Capability Brown, the landscape designer.

Fine examples of distinctive Georgian architecture are Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town, Georgian Dublin, Grainger Town in Newcastle upon Tyne, the Georgian Quarter of Liverpool and much of Bristol and Bath.

The music of John Field, Handel, Haydn, Clementi, Johann Christian Bach, William Boyce, Mozart, Beethoven and Mendelssohn was some of the most popular in England at that time.

=== Grand Tour ===
The height of the Grand Tour coincided with the 18th century and is associated with Georgian high society. This custom saw young upper-class Englishmen travelling to Italy by way of France and the Netherlands for intellectual and cultural purposes. Notable historian Edward Gibbon remarked of the Grand Tour as useful for intellectual self-improvement. The journey and stay abroad would usually take a year or more. This would eventually lead to the basis for the acquisition and spread of art collections back to England as well as fashions and paintings from Italy. The custom also helped popularise the macaroni style that was soon to become fashionable at the time.

== Social change ==

It was a time of immense social change in Britain, with the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution which began the process of intensifying class divisions, and the emergence of rival political parties like the Whigs and Tories.

In rural areas, the Agricultural Revolution saw huge changes to the movement of people and the decline of small communities, the growth of the cities and the beginnings of an integrated transportation system but, nevertheless, as rural towns and villages declined and work became scarce there was a huge increase in emigration to Canada, the North American colonies (which became the United States during the period) and other parts of the British Empire.

=== Evangelical religion and social reform ===
In England, the evangelical movement inside and outside the Church of England gained strength in the late 18th and early 19th century. The movement challenged the traditional religious sensibility that emphasised a code of honour for the upper class, and suitable behaviour for everyone else, together with faithful observances of rituals. John Wesley (1703–1791) and his followers preached revivalist religion, trying to convert individuals to a personal relationship with Christ through Bible reading, regular prayer, and especially the revival experience. Wesley himself preached 52,000 times, calling on men and women to &quot;redeem the time&quot; and save their souls. Wesley always operated inside the Church of England, but at his death, his followers set up outside institutions that became the Methodist Church. It stood alongside the traditional Nonconformist churches, Presbyterians, Congregationalist, Baptists, Unitarians, and Quakers. The Nonconformist churches, however, were less influenced by revivalism.

The Church of England remained dominant in England but it had a growing evangelical, revivalist faction, the &quot;Low Church&quot;. Its leaders included William Wilberforce and Hannah More. It reached the upper class through the Clapham Sect. It did not seek political reform, but rather the opportunity to save souls through political action by freeing slaves, abolishing the duel, prohibiting cruelty to children and animals, stopping gambling, and avoiding frivolity on the Sabbath; they read the Bible every day. All souls were equal in God&#x27;s view, but not all bodies, so evangelicals did not challenge the hierarchical structure of English society. As R. J. Morris noted in his 1983 article &quot;Voluntary Societies and British Urban Elites, 1780-1850,&quot; &quot;[m]id-eighteenth-century Britain was a stable society in the sense that those with material and ideological power were able to defend this power in an effective and dynamic manner,&quot; but &quot;in the twenty years after 1780, this consensus structure was broken.&quot; Anglican Evangelicalism thus, as historian Lisa Wood has argued in her book &quot;Modes of Discipline: Women, Conservatism, and the Novel After the French Revolution&quot;, functioned as a tool of ruling-class social control, buffering the discontent that in France had inaugurated a revolution; yet it contained within itself the seeds for challenge to gender and class hierarchies.

== Empire ==
The Georgian period saw continual warfare, with France the primary enemy. Major episodes included the Seven Years&#x27; War, known in America as the French and Indian War (1754–1763), the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), the French Revolutionary Wars (1792–1802), the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815). The British won most of the wars except for the American Revolution, where the combined weight of the United States, France, Spain and the Netherlands overwhelmed Britain, which stood alone without allies.

The loss of the 13 American Colonies was a national disaster. Commentators at home and abroad speculated on the end of Britain as a great power. In Europe, the wars with France dragged on for nearly a quarter of a century, 1793–1815. Britain organised coalition after coalition, using its superb financial system to subsidise infantry forces, and built up its Navy to maintain control of the seas. Victory over Napoleon at the Battle of Trafalgar (1805) and the Battle of Waterloo (1815) under Admiral Lord Nelson and the Duke of Wellington brought a sense of triumphalism and political reaction.

The expansion of empire in Asia was primarily the work of the British East India Company, especially under the leadership of Robert Clive. Captain James Cook was perhaps the most prominent of the many explorers and geographers using the resources of the Royal Navy to develop the Empire and make many scientific discoveries, especially in Australia and the Pacific. Instead of trying to recover the lost colonies in North America, the British built up in Asia a largely new Second British Empire. That new empire flourished during the Victorian and Edwardian eras which were to follow.

=== The trading nation ===

The era was prosperous as entrepreneurs extended the range of their business around the globe. By the 1720s Britain was one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and Daniel Defoe boasted:
:we are the most &quot;diligent nation in the world. Vast trade, rich manufactures, mighty wealth, universal correspondence, and happy success have been constant companions of England, and given us the title of an industrious people.&quot;

While the other major powers were primarily motivated towards territorial gains, and protection of their dynasties (such as the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasties, and the House of Hohenzollern), Britain had a different set of primary interests. Its main diplomatic goal (besides protecting the homeland from invasion) was building a worldwide trading network for its merchants, manufacturers, shippers and financiers. This required a hegemonic Royal Navy so powerful that no rival could sweep its ships from the world&#x27;s trading routes, or invade the British Isles. The London government enhanced the private sector by incorporating numerous privately financed London-based companies for establishing trading posts and opening import-export businesses across the world. Each was given a monopoly of trade to the specified geographical region. The first enterprise was the Muscovy Company set up in 1555 to trade with Russia. Other prominent enterprises included the East India Company, and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in Canada. The Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa had been set up in 1662 to trade in gold, ivory and slaves in Africa; it was re-established as the Royal African Company in 1672 and focused on the slave trade. British involvement in each of the four major wars, 1740 to 1783, paid off handsomely in terms of trade. Even the loss of the 13 colonies was made up by a very favourable trading relationship with the new United States of America. British gained dominance in the trade with India, and largely dominated the highly lucrative slave, sugar, and commercial trades originating in West Africa and the West Indies. China would be next on the agenda. Other powers set up similar monopolies on a much smaller scale; only the Netherlands emphasized trade as much as England.

Mercantilism was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies. Mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants—and kept others out—by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximise exports from and minimise imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling, which became a favourite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch. The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a large and powerful Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.

Most of the companies earned good profits, and enormous personal fortunes were created in India, but there was one major fiasco that caused heavy losses. The South Sea Bubble was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The South Sea Company was a private business corporation supposedly set up much like the other trading companies, with a focus on South America. Its actual purpose was to renegotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to £31 million through market manipulation and speculation. It issued stock four times in 1720 that reached about 8,000 investors. Prices kept soaring every day, from £130 a share to £1,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining many speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places—even to the king. The future prime minister Robert Walpole managed to wind it down with minimal political and economic damage, although some suffering extreme loss fled to exile or committed suicide.

== Political and social revolt ==

The beginning of the Georgian era witnessed rioting by Jacobite and High Church mobs in protest against the Hanoverian succession and which included attacks on the Dissenters&#x27; places of worship. These included the 1714 coronation riots, which occurred on the day of George I&#x27;s coronation, and the riots of 1715. In response, Parliament passed the Riot Act, which granted the authorities greater powers to put down rioting.

Although religious toleration was extensive by the standards of continental Europe, hostility to religious minorities was widespread in Britain during the eighteenth century and sometimes expressed itself in rioting. The Jewish Naturalisation Act 1753 was repealed a year after it had been passed because of widespread opposition and the 1780 Gordon Riots in London were directed against Catholics after the Papists Act 1778 removed some of their legal disabilities. During the 1791 Priestley Riots in Birmingham, the mob targeted Dissenters, including the prominent Radical Joseph Priestley.

The Black Act 1723, sponsored by Robert Walpole, strengthened the criminal code for the benefit of the upper class. It specified over 200 capital crimes, many with intensified punishment. The crime of arson, for example, was expanded to include of burning or the threat of burning haystacks. The legal rights of defendants were something different from today. For example, suspects who refused to surrender within 40 days could be summarily judged guilty and sentenced to execution if apprehended. Local villages were punished if they failed to find, prosecute and convict alleged criminals, due to the increase in crime at the time.

With the ending of the War with France in 1815, Great Britain entered a period of greater economic depression and political uncertainty, characterised by social discontent and unrest. The Radical political party published a leaflet called &quot;The Political Register&quot;, also known as &quot;The Two Penny Trash&quot; to its rivals. The so-called March of the Blanketeers saw 400 spinners and weavers march from Manchester to London in March 1817 to hand the Government a petition. The Luddites destroyed and damaged machinery in the industrial north-west of England. The Peterloo Massacre in 1819 began as a protest rally which saw 60,000 people gathering to protest about their living standards, but was quelled by military action and saw eleven people killed and 400 wounded. The Cato Street Conspiracy of 1820 sought to blow up the Cabinet and then move on to storm the Tower of London and overthrow the government. This too was thwarted, with the conspirators executed or transported to Australia.

== Enlightenment ==
Historians have long explored the importance of the Scottish Enlightenment, as well as the American Enlightenment, while debating the very existence of the English Enlightenment.

=== Scottish Enlightenment ===

English historian Peter Gay argues that the Scottish Enlightenment &quot;was a small and cohesive group of friends – David Hume, Adam Smith, Adam Ferguson, and others – who knew one another intimately and talked to one another incessantly&quot;. Education was a priority in Scotland, both at the local level and especially in four universities. The Enlightenment culture was based on close readings of new books, and intense discussions that took place daily at such intellectual gathering places in Edinburgh as The Select Society and, later, The Poker Club as well as within Scotland&#x27;s ancient universities (St Andrews, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen). Sharing the humanist and rationalist outlook of the European Enlightenment of the same time period, the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment asserted the importance of human reason combined with a rejection of any authority that could not be justified by reason. In Scotland, the Enlightenment was characterised by a thoroughgoing empiricism and practicality where the chief values were improvement, virtue, and practical benefit for the individual and society as a whole. Among the fields that rapidly advanced were philosophy, economics, history, architecture, and medicine. Leaders included Francis Hutcheson, David Hume, Adam Smith, Dugald Stewart, Thomas Reid, William Robertson, Henry Home, Lord Kames, Adam Ferguson, John Playfair, Joseph Black and James Hutton.

=== English Enlightenment ===

The very existence of an English Enlightenment has been debated by scholars. The majority of textbooks and standard surveys make no room for an English Enlightenment. Some European surveys include England, others ignore it but do include coverage of such major intellectuals as Joseph Addison, Edward Gibbon, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Alexander Pope and Joshua Reynolds.

According to Derek Hirst, the 1640s and 1650s saw a revived economy characterised by growth in manufacturing, the elaboration of financial and credit instruments, and the commercialisation of communication. The gentry found time for leisure activities, such as horse racing and bowling. In the high culture important innovations included the development of a mass market for music, increased scientific research, and an expansion of publishing. All the trends were discussed in depth at the newly established coffee houses. Education was also a priority in England. English institutions expanded rapidly, including the formation of the Royal Society, which is the oldest national scientific institution in the world.

Roy Porter argues that the reason for the neglect was the assumption that the movement was primarily French-inspired, that it was largely a-religious or anti-clerical, and it stood in outspoken defiance to the established order. Porter admits that after the 1720s, England could claim thinkers to equal Diderot, Voltaire or Rousseau. Indeed, its leading intellectuals, such as Edward Gibbon, Edmund Burke and Samuel Johnson were all quite conservative and supported the standing order. Porter says the reason was that Enlightenment had come early to England, and had succeeded so that the culture had accepted political liberalism, philosophical empiricism and religious toleration of the sort that intellectuals on the continent had to fight for against powerful odds. The coffee-house culture provided an ideal venue for enlightened conversation. Furthermore, England rejected the collectivism of the continent, and emphasized the improvement of individuals as the main goal of enlightenment.

=== Science and medicine ===
The British sponsored numerous scientists who made major discoveries in the small laboratories. Joseph Priestley investigated electricity. Chemist Henry Cavendish identified hydrogen in 1772. Daniel Rutherford isolated nitrogen in 1774, while Priestley discovered oxygen and ammonia. Antiquarians and archaeologists mapped the past. In medicine, in 1717 Lady Mary Wortley Montagu introduced inoculation against smallpox to Britain, and by 1740 it was in wide usage. Guy&#x27;s Hospital was founded in 1721; the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in 1729; Queen Charlotte&#x27;s maternity hospital in 1739 and the Middlesex Hospital in 1745. Asylums for the mentally ill were established, notably Bethel Hospital in Norwich (1713); a ward for incurable lunatics at Guy&#x27;s Hospital (1728); and lunatic hospitals in Manchester (1766) and York in (1777)—York was the first to be called an asylum.

== Ending ==
Historians debate the exact ending, with the deaths of George IV in 1830 or William IV in 1837 as the usual marker. In most social and cultural trends, the timing varied. The emergence of Romanticism and literature began as early as the 1780s, but religious changes took much longer and were incomplete until around a century later. The 1830s saw important developments such as the emergence of the Oxford Movement in religion and the demise of classical architecture. Victorians typically were disapproving of the times of the previous era. By the late 19th century, the &quot;Georgian era&quot; was a byword for a degenerate culture. Charles Abbey in 1878 argued that the Church of England:
:partook of the general sordidness of the age; it was an age of great material prosperity, but of moral and spiritual poverty, such as hardly finds a parallel in our history. Mercenary motives were to predominate everywhere, in the Church as well as in the state.

== Timeline ==
;1714: Upon the death of his second cousin Queen Anne, &quot;George Louis, Elector of Hanover&quot;, succeeds as the new King, George I, of Great Britain and Ireland, the former of which had itself been established in 1707. This is the beginning of the House of Hanover&#x27;s reign over the British Crown.

;1715: The Whig Party wins the British parliamentary election for the House of Commons. This party is dominant until 1760.

;1727: George I dies on 11 June. His son &quot;George, Prince of Wales&quot;, ascends to the throne as George II.

;1745: The final Jacobite rising is crushed at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746.

;1760: George II dies on 25 October, and his grandson &quot;George, Prince of Wales&quot;, ascends to the throne as George III.

;1763: Britain is victorious in the Seven Years&#x27; War. The Treaty of Paris of 1763 grants Britain domain over vast new territories around the world.

;1765: The Stamp Act is passed by the Parliament of Great Britain, causing much unrest in the Thirteen Colonies in North America.

;1769–1770: Australia and New Zealand are claimed as British colonies.

;1773: The Inclosure Act 1773 is put into place by the British Parliament. This act brought about the enclosure of land and removing the right of common land access. This began an internal mass movement of rural poor from the countryside into the cities.

;1775: The American Revolutionary War begins in the Thirteen Colonies, specifically in Massachusetts; all royal officials are expelled.

;1776: The Thirteen Colonies in North America declare their independence. King George III is determined to recover them.

;1777: The main British invasion army under Gen. Burgoyne surrenders at Saratoga; the French increase their aid to the Americans.

;1778: France forms in a military alliance with the United States and declares war on Britain. The Netherlands and Spain support France; Britain has no major allies.

;1781: The British Army in America under Lord Cornwallis surrenders to George Washington after its defeat in Yorktown, Virginia, in October 1781. The French Navy controls the seas.

;1782: Battle of the Saintes: Admiral Sir George Rodney defeated a French fleet under the Comte de Grasse, enabling the Royal Navy to control the West Indies.

;1783: Great Britain formally recognises the independence of the original 13 American States in the Treaty of Paris of 1783. The geographical terms are very generous to the Americans, and the expectation that Anglo-American trade will become of major importance.

;1788: Australia is settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January.

;1789: Thomas Robert Malthus, an Anglican cleric, authors &quot;An Essay on the Principle of Population&quot;. This work, the origin of Malthusianism, posited a need for population control to avoid poverty and famine or conflict over scarce resources.

;1801: The Act of Union 1800 comes into effect on 1 January, uniting the Kingdoms of Great Britain and of Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

;1807: The Abolition of the Slave Trade Act became law, making it illegal to engage in the slave trade throughout the British Empire, partly as a result of a twenty-year parliamentary campaign by William Wilberforce.

;1811: &quot;George, Prince of Wales&quot;, begins his nine-year period as the regent (he became known as &quot;George, Prince Regent&quot;) for George III, who had become delusional. This sub-period of the Georgian era is known as the Regency era.

;1815: Napoleon I of France is defeated by the Seventh Coalition under The Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo.

;1819: The Peterloo Massacre occurs.

;1820: George III dies on 29 January, and his son &quot;George, Prince Regent&quot;, ascends to the throne of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland as George IV. He had been the effective ruler since 1811 as regent for his seriously ill father.

;1830: George IV dies on 26 June. Some historians date this as the end of the Georgian era of the House of Hanover. However, many other authorities continue this era during the relatively short reign of his younger brother, who became King William IV.

;1833: Slavery Abolition Act passed by Parliament through the influence of William Wilberforce and the Evangelical movement. The slaveowners are generously paid off.

;1837: Transition to the Victorian era. King William IV dies on 20 June, ending the Georgian era. He was succeeded by his niece, Queen Victoria.

<text>Men&#x27;s Health (MH), published by Hearst, is the world&#x27;s largest men&#x27;s magazine brand, with 35 editions in 59 countries; it is the bestselling men&#x27;s magazine on American newsstands.

Started as a men&#x27;s health magazine by Rodale, Inc. in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, the magazine currently covers various men&#x27;s lifestyle topics such as fitness, nutrition, fashion and sexuality. The magazine&#x27;s website, MensHealth.com, averages over 118 million page views a month.

==History==
Started by Mark Bricklin in the US in 1986 as a health magazine, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; evolved into a lifestyle magazine, covering fitness, nutrition, relationships, travel, technology, fashion and finance. Bricklin, Rodale, Inc. editors Larry Stains and Stefan Bechtel produced three newsstand test issues. The results led Rodale to start &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; as a quarterly magazine in 1988 and begin to sell subscriptions.
Bricklin, who was editor-in-chief of &quot;Prevention&quot; magazine, appointed Michael J. Lafavore (born April 28, 1952) as editor of &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; that year. In his 12 years as editor-in-chief, Mike Lafavore increased the circulation from 100,000 to over 1.5 million, increased publication to ten 10 times a year, and expanded the magazine to Australia, France, Germany, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and the UK. The South African version, along with &quot;Women&#x27;s Health&quot;, is licensed for publication by Media24, with distribution by Magzter.

He created the editorial formula, and hired Steven Slon from service journalism and Greg Gutfeld from &quot;Prevention&quot;. He worked with longtime staff editor Denis Boyles, a former &quot;Playboy&quot; contributing editor, to develop the magazine&#x27;s voice. Lafavore left &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; in 2000, the same year Capell&#x27;s Circulation Report named the magazine Circulation Performer of the Decade. He named Gutfeld his successor. After one year, Gutfeld was replaced by David Zinczenko.

Zinczenko became editor-in-chief in 2000. Circulation increased 30 percent, ad pages by 80 percent from 700 to 1150. In 2000, the brand had 21 international editions. In 2001 the title was consistently selling 400,000 copies at newsstands and circulation was 1.6 million. In 2001, the magazine started the annual list of cities with the healthiest men, based on twenty &quot;live-long parameters, including death rates (both homicide and disease); illness rates (high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, etc.); body-mass index; fitness training; even environmental factors like number of parks, golf courses, etc.&quot; In 2003, the circulation was 1.7 million. In 2006, the circulation was close to 1.8 million.

&quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; magazine has been criticized for its focus on physical health, which can increase men&#x27;s anxieties about their bodies, making them more prone to eating disorders and compulsive over-exercising. &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;Since its debut in the late 1980s, the magazine has surpassed traditional men&#x27;s books like &quot;Esquire&quot; and &quot;GQ&quot; by following the formula of best-selling women&#x27;s magazines—by catering to men&#x27;s anxieties about their bodies and sexual performance.&quot; &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; stated the magazine &quot;deals overwhelmingly with self-care and, in fact, exaggerates the possibilities for autonomous personal transformation.&quot; Editor-In-Chief Zinczenko argued that the magazine worked toward &quot;overcoming the resistance of the 86-percent male audience to health as a subject&quot; and redefining health as &quot;inclusive of everything that could improve a man&#x27;s life. Great sex. Great food. Endorphin-boosting exercise. Looking and feeling your best. We turned health into a concept every guy would want to embrace, starting with the healthy guy on the cover.&quot;

&quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; has been criticized for reusing cover taglines. Zinczenko replied that 80 percent of magazine sales are by subscription, and those covers differ from the newsstand version. &quot;Twenty years of &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; has certainly produced several lines that have proven themselves effective at newsstand, which makes up about 20 percent of our print run. We plan to keep using the most effective marketing tools to reach the largest market we possibly can.&quot; In July 2010, the magazine was criticized for including tiny credit lines on the cover rather than inside as a possible quid-pro-quo for advertisers. Zinczenko said the lines saved readers from having to dig for information and that &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; had been including the lines for over a year regardless of advertiser status. A spokesperson for the American Society of Magazine Editors said that no rules were broken. The director for print strategy at a media firm said the mention was &quot;too small of a plug to get brands excited.&quot;

In 2004, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; began putting celebrities and athletes on the cover, and with their shirts on—a departure from the covers of the 1990s. In 2004, Rodale filed suit against &quot;Men&#x27;s Fitness&quot; for its redesign, &quot;a copycat version—one that is obviously intended to confuse consumers.&quot; In May 2006, the magazine published a limited edition color cover of Josh Holloway. In the first half of 2006, newsstand sales for &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; rose from 492,000 to 544,000 during a price increase from $3.95 to $4.50. In 2006 Rodale&#x27;s properties, including &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot;, tried to increase online content by adding video to each section, telling section editors to write blogs, and hiring an online ad sales director.

In 2008, the magazine partnered with Google to make back issues available. In July 2008, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; became the first to &quot;create the first fully interactive advertising magazine in America,&quot; where readers could take a picture of an ad, and a promotional &quot;bounce-back&quot; was sent to their phone. For its 20th-anniversary issue in November 2008, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; included an interview and photo shoot with president-elect Barack Obama. In 2010, Obama was again featured about health care and his plans.

In 2009, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; published &quot;Belly Off! Diet&quot; based on the weight-loss testimonial column in the magazine. The column &quot;Eat This, Not That!&quot; became a book series in 2007, written by Zinczenko and Matt Goulding), and was turned into different versions (children, supermarket, restaurant, diet book) and free iPhone applications. EatThis.MensHealth.com was the most highly trafficked section of MensHealth.com in 2009 with 1 million unique visitors and 15 million page views a month.

Editor-in-chief Matt Bean led the magazine in developing over 40 mobile apps for the iPhone, Android and BlackBerry. &quot;Eat This, Not That! The Game&quot; won an American Society of Magazine Editors award for Best Interactive Tool and was downloaded 500,000 times in two weeks. The magazine&#x27;s first application, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health Workouts&quot;, was in the top 10 in the Health and Fitness category. In September 2009, the column &quot;Ask Jimmy the Bartender&quot; was turned into an iPhone and iPad application, which was downloaded 50,000 times in its first month. In 2010, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; became one of the first consumer magazines to enter the iPad market.

In 2011, David Zinczenko was replaced by Bill Phillips, who was the executive editor of the magazine and editor of MensHealth.com.

In November 2014, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; featured a reader on the cover for the first time with amputee and veteran Noah Galloway, the winner of the first Ultimate &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; Guy Search.

In February 2015, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; won the National Magazine Award for General Excellence.

In 2016, Matt Bean became editor-in-chief. He hired Creative Director Mike Schnaidt to redesign the magazine with visual updates inspired by media, such as auto repair guides, hiking maps, and military field manuals, added &quot;The Exchange&quot;, &quot;Unfiltered&quot;, &quot;Field Guide&quot; and a column by Tim Ferriss. He introduced the digital franchise MH Longform. In October 2017 &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; began the cross-platform series &quot;The Adventurist&quot; in partnership with Fitbit.

==Spin-offs==
In 2000, &quot;MH-18&quot;, a youth-oriented version of &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; covering teen lifestyle, was spun off but ceased publication in November 2001.

In 2004 under Zinczenko&#x27;s direction, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; spun off &quot;Best Life.&quot; May 2009 was &quot;Best Life&quot; last issue. &quot;Best Life&quot; was published 10 times a year and had a circulation of more than 500,000. Stephen Perrine, the former editorial creative director at &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot;, was the editor-in-chief. David Zinczenko was the editorial director. In March 2008, &quot;Best Life&quot; finished #2 on Adweek&#x27;s prestigious &quot;10 under 50&quot; Hot List, which recognizes magazines with fewer than $50 million in ad revenue.

In 2005, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; spun off &quot;Women&#x27;s Health&quot;. The test-issue team was headed by Bill Stump, a former &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; editor who was then the head of Rodale Inc.&#x27;s New Product Development department, and included former director of new product development Andréa Mallard. Within a year the circulation was at 750,000. &quot;Women&#x27;s Health&quot; magazine is now published 10 times a year. In January 2009, Michele Promaulayko was named editor-in-chief of &quot;Women&#x27;s Health.&quot; In March 2008, &quot;Women&#x27;s Health&quot; finished #1 on Adweek&#x27;s &quot;10 under 50&quot; Hot List. The magazine was named #2 on Advertising Age&#x27;s 2008 A List. &quot;Women&#x27;s Health&quot; has a circulation of 1.1 million.

In 2007, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; spun off &quot;Men&#x27;s Health Living&quot;, a newsstand special which was named one of the 30 most notable launches of 2007 by Samir Husni. Samir Husni stated that &quot;Men&#x27;s Health Living&quot; is a &quot;new genre of men&#x27;s magazines that cater to non-woman related issues in a man&#x27;s life - that has gone unfulfilled for years: interior design and home that meets the needs of the affluent man.&quot; The test issue of &quot;Men&#x27;s Health Living&quot; was edited by Bill Phillips, executive editor of &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot;, and Matt Bean. The first issue sold around 200,000 copies at $4.99 each out of 375,000 sent to newsstands. In January 2009, a second &quot;Men&#x27;s Health Living&quot; issue was at newsstands, 450,000 copies at $5.99 each.

In 2007, they also spun off &quot;Men&#x27;s Health on Campus&quot; as a test with a goal for quarterly publication thereafter.

In 2009, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; spun off &quot;Children&#x27;s Health&quot;, a special issue that was part of a Rodale publishing idea to work with President and First Lady Obama to show support for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The magazine published how-to stories about fitness and nutrition for children.

In 2013, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; launched the radio show &quot;Men&#x27;s Health Live&quot; in partnership with Entertainment Radio Network.

In April 2017, under Matt Bean, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; released an online video franchise, MH Films, which has featured people such as Hafþór Björnsson, Erik Weihenmayer and Sam Calagione. In June 2017, the magazine launched MH Rec Room, specializing in shorter videos for social media featuring various fitness trainers, lifestyle influencers, and authors.

==Global editions==

Although &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; was founded in the US, its international editions have made it the world&#x27;s largest men&#x27;s magazine brand. These magazines reach over 71 million readers worldwide. &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; is published in 35 editions.

International editions account for over 80% of the magazine&#x27;s trade volume. In each market, local editors commission or purchase articles for their own market and share content with US and other editions. The selected articles are then translated and edited by local staffers to make them match the style of the American edition. Usually, these editions started as translations of the US version of the magazine, but over time many non-US editions became unique, providing material more pertinent to local readers.

<text>York Castle is a fortified complex in the city of York, England. It consists of a sequence of castles, prisons, law courts and other buildings, which were built over the last nine centuries on the south side of the River Foss. The now ruined keep of the medieval Norman castle is commonly referred to as Clifford&#x27;s Tower. Built originally on the orders of William I to dominate the former Viking city of Jórvík, the castle suffered a tumultuous early history before developing into a major fortification with extensive water defences. After a major explosion in 1684 rendered the remaining military defences uninhabitable, York Castle continued to be used as a gaol and prison until 1929.

The first motte and bailey castle on the site was built in 1068 following the Norman conquest of York. After the destruction of the castle by rebels and a Viking army in 1069, York Castle was rebuilt and reinforced with extensive water defences, including a moat and an artificial lake. York Castle formed an important royal fortification in the north of England.

In 1190, 150 local Jews were murdered in a pogrom in the timber castle keep; most of them committed suicide in order not to fall into the hands of the mob. Henry III rebuilt the castle in stone in the middle of the 13th century, creating a keep with a unique quatrefoil design, supported by an outer bailey wall and a substantial gatehouse. During the Scottish wars between 1298 and 1338, York Castle was frequently used as the centre of royal administration across England, as well as an important military base of operations.

York Castle fell into disrepair by the 15th and 16th centuries, becoming used increasingly as a gaol for both local felons and political prisoners. By the time of Elizabeth I the castle was estimated to have lost all of its military value but was maintained as a centre of royal authority in York. The outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 saw York Castle being repaired and refortified, playing a part in the Royalist defence of York in 1644 against Parliamentary forces. York Castle continued to be garrisoned until 1684, when an explosion destroyed the interior of Clifford&#x27;s Tower.

The castle bailey was redeveloped in a neoclassical style in the 18th century as a centre for county administration in Yorkshire, and was used as a gaol and debtors&#x27; prison. Prison reform in the 19th century led to the creation of a new prison built in a Tudor Gothic style on the castle site in 1825; used first as a county and then as a military prison, this facility was demolished in 1935. By the 20th century the ruin of Clifford&#x27;s Tower had become a well-known tourist destination and national monument; today the site is owned by English Heritage and open to the public. The other remaining buildings serve as the York Castle Museum and the Crown Court.

==History==

===11th century===

York was a Viking capital in the 10th century, and continued as an important northern city in the 11th century. In 1068, on William the Conqueror&#x27;s first northern expedition after the Norman Conquest, he built a number of castles across the north-east of England, including one at York. This first castle at York was a basic wooden motte and bailey castle built between the rivers Ouse and Foss on the site of the present-day York Castle. It was built in haste; contemporary accounts imply it was constructed in only eight days, although this assertion has been challenged. The motte was originally around wide at the base. As it was built in an urban environment, hundreds of houses had to be destroyed to make way for the development. William Malet, the sheriff of Yorkshire, was placed in charge of the castle and successfully defended it against an immediate uprising by the local population.

In response to the worsening security situation, William conducted his second northern campaign in 1069. He built another castle in York, on what is now Baile Hill on the west bank of the Ouse opposite the first castle, in an effort to improve his control over the city. This second castle was also a motte and bailey design, with the Baile Hill motte probably reached by a horizontal bridge and steps cut up the side of the motte. Later that year, a Danish Viking fleet sailed up to York along the Humber and the Ouse, and attacked both castles with the assistance of Cospatrick of Northumbria and a number of local rebels. The Normans, attempting to drive the rebels back, set fire to some of the city&#x27;s houses. The fire grew out of control and also set fire to York Minster and, some argue, the castles as well. The castles were captured and partially dismantled, and Malet was taken hostage by the Danes.

William conducted a widespread sequence of punitive operations across the north of England in the aftermath of the attacks in 1069 and 1070. This &quot;Harrying of the North&quot; restored sufficient order to allow the rebuilding of the two castles, again in wood. The bailey at York Castle was enlarged slightly in the process; buildings believed to have been inside the bailey at this time include &quot;halls, kitchens, a chapel, barracks, stores, stables, forges [and] workshops&quot;. By the time the Domesday Book was written in 1086, York Castle was also surrounded by a water-filled moat and a large artificial lake called the King&#x27;s Pool, fed from the river Foss by a dam built for the purpose. More property, including two watermills, had to be destroyed to make way for the water defences. Over time the Baile Hill site was abandoned in favour of the first castle site, leaving only the motte, which still exists.

===12th century===
Henry II visited York Castle four times during his reign. The royal chambers at the time were inside the keep for safety, and Henry paid £15 for repairs to the keep. During his 1175 visit, Henry used the castle as the base for receiving the homage of William the Lion of Scotland.Castle mills were built close by to support the garrison, and the military order of the Knights Templar was granted ownership of the mills in the mid-12th century. The mills proved to be vulnerable to the flooding of the two rivers and had to be repeatedly repaired.

====Massacre of Jews====
In 1190, York Castle was the location of one of the worst pogroms in England during the medieval period. The Normans had introduced the first Jewish communities into England, where some occupied a special economic role as moneylenders, an essential but otherwise banned activity. English Jews were subject to considerable religious prejudice and primarily worked from towns and cities in which there was a local royal castle that could provide them with protection in the event of attacks from the majority Christian population. Royal protection was usually granted as the Norman and Angevin kings had determined that Jewish property and debts owed to Jews ultimately belonged to the crown, reverting to the king on a Jew&#x27;s death.

Richard I was crowned king in 1189 and announced his intention to join the Crusades; this inflamed anti-Jewish sentiment. Rumours began to spread that the king had ordered that the English Jews be attacked. In York, tensions broke out into violence the following year. Richard de Malbis, who owed money to the powerful Jewish merchant Aaron of Lincoln, exploited an accidental house fire to incite a local mob to attack the home and family of a recently deceased Jewish employee of Aaron in York. Josce of York, the leader of the Jewish community, led the local Jewish families into the royal castle, where they took refuge in the wooden keep. The mob surrounded the castle, and when the constable left the castle to discuss the situation, the Jews, fearing the entry of the mob or being handed over to the sheriff, refused to allow him back in. The constable appealed to the sheriff, who called out his own men and laid siege to the keep. The siege continued until 16 March when the Jews&#x27; position became untenable. Their religious leader, Rabbi Yomtob, proposed an act of collective suicide to avoid being killed by the mob, and the castle was set on fire to prevent their bodies being mutilated after their deaths. Several Jews perished in the flames but the majority took their own lives rather than give themselves up to the mob. However, a handful of Jews did surrender, promising to convert to Christianity, but they were killed by the angry crowd. Around 150 Jews died in total in the massacre. The keep was rebuilt, again in wood, on the motte, which was raised in height by at a cost of £207.

===13th and 14th centuries===
King John used York Castle extensively during his reign, using the keep as his personal quarters for his own security. The castle was kept in good repair during that time. During this period, the first records of the use of the castle as a gaol appeared, with references to prisoners taken during John&#x27;s Irish campaigns being held at York Castle. By the 13th century there was a well-established system of castle-guards in place, under which various lands around York were granted in return for the provision of knights and crossbowmen to assist in protecting the castle.

Henry III also made extensive use of the castle, but during his visit at Christmas 1228 a gale destroyed the wooden keep on the motte. The keep was apparently not repaired, and a building for the king&#x27;s use was built in the bailey instead. In 1244, when the Scots threatened to invade England, King Henry III visited the castle and ordered it to be rebuilt in white limestone, at a cost of about £2,600. The work was carried out between 1245 and 1270, and included the construction of a towered curtain wall, a gatehouse of considerable size with two large towers, two smaller gatehouses, a small watergate, a small gateway into the city, a chapel, and a new stone keep, first known as the King&#x27;s, later Clifford&#x27;s, Tower.

Clifford&#x27;s Tower is of an unusual design. The two-storey tower has a quatrefoil plan with four circular lobes. Each lobe measures across, with walls thick; at its widest, the tower is across. A square gatehouse, wide, protected the entrance on the south side between two of the lobes. There are defensive turrets between the other lobes. Large corbels and a central pier supported the huge weight of stone and the first floor. Loopholes of a design unique to York Castle provided firing points. A chapel was built over the entrance, measuring doubling as a portcullis chamber as at Harlech and Chepstow Castles. The tower is believed to be an experiment in improving flanking fire by making more ground visible from the summit of the keep. Although unique in England, the design of the tower closely resembles that at Étampes in France, and may have influenced the design of the future keep of Pontefract Castle. Henry employed master mason Henry de Rayns and chief carpenter Simon of Northampton for the project, and the cost of the tower accounted for the majority of the overall expenditure on the castle during this period of work.
The new castle needed constant investment to maintain its quality as a military fortification. Winter floods in 1315–16 damaged the soil at the base of the motte, requiring immediate repairs. Around 1358–60, the heavy stone keep again suffered from subsidence and the south-eastern lobe cracked from top to bottom. Royal officials recommended that the keep be completely rebuilt, but, instead, the lobe was repaired at a cost of £200.

Edward I gave wide-reaching powers to the sheriff of Yorkshire for enforcing law and order in the city of York, and the sheriffs established their headquarters in Clifford&#x27;s Tower. During the wars against the Scots under both Edward and his son, York Castle also formed the centre of royal administration in England for almost half the years between 1298 and 1338. Many Westminster institutions followed the king north to York, basing themselves in the castle compound. The existing castle buildings were insufficient to house all the administrative institutions; a temporary building inside the castle was built for the Court of Common Pleas at the beginning of the period, and rebuilt on a larger scale during 1319–20. The Exchequer took over Clifford&#x27;s Tower. Other buildings around the city had to be commandeered to absorb the overflow from the castle itself. As a result of the extended use of the castle for these purposes, the law courts at York Castle began to compete with those in London, a pattern that lasted into the 1360s. The castle eventually acquired its own mint in 1344, when Edward III decided to create a permanent mint in York Castle to produce gold and silver coins to serve the needs of the north of England. European coiners were brought to York to establish the facility.

Henry III extended the castle&#x27;s role as a gaol for holding a wide range of prisoners. The sheriff was responsible for the gaol at this time, and his deputy usually took the role of a full-time gaoler. Up to three hundred and ten prisoners were held in the castle at any one time. The conditions in which prisoners were held were &quot;appalling&quot;, and led to the widespread loss of life amongst detainees. Prison escapes were relatively common, and many of them, such as the break-out by 28 prisoners in 1298, were successful. When the Military Order of the Knights Templar was dissolved in England in 1307, York Castle was used to hold many of the arrested knights. The castle mills, as former Templar property, returned to royal control at the same time. Edward II also used the castle as a gaol in his campaign against his rebellious barons in 1322, and after the Battle of Boroughbridge many of the defeated rebel leaders were executed at York Castle.

By the end of the 14th century, the castle bailey was primarily occupied by the local county administration. It was used extensively as a gaol, with prisoners being kept in the various towers around the bailey. The old castle-guard system for securing the castle had changed into a system whereby the crown used rents from local royal lands to hire local guards for the castle. Increasingly, royalty preferred to stay at the Franciscan friary, between the castle and King&#x27;s Staith on the Ouse, while their staff resided at St Mary&#x27;s Abbey and St Andrew&#x27;s Priory in the Fishergate area.

===15th and 16th centuries===

In the 15th century, York Castle, along with Nottingham Castle, was considered a key security asset in the north of England, but investment even in these castles diminished. Repairs to York Castle grew infrequent from 1400 onwards, and it fell into increasing disrepair. Richard III recognised the issue and in 1483 had some of the most decrepit structures removed, but he died at the Battle of Bosworth before replacement work could commence. By the reign of Henry VIII, the antiquary John Leland reported that the castle was in considerable disrepair; nonetheless the water defences remained intact, unlike those of many other castles of the period. As a result of the deterioration, Henry had to be advised that the king&#x27;s councillors no longer had any official residence in which to stay and work when they were in York. The castle mint was shut down after the death of Edward VI in 1553, and the castle mills were given to a local charitable hospital in 1464. The hospital was then closed during the Reformation, and the mills passed into private ownership once again.

The castle continued to be used as a gaol, increasingly for local felons, and a location for political executions. By the 16th century it had become traditional to execute traitors by hanging them from the top of Clifford&#x27;s Tower, rather than killing them at Micklegate Bar, the usual previous location for capital punishment in York. In 1536, for example, the political leader Robert Aske was executed at York Castle on the orders of Henry VIII, following the failure of Aske&#x27;s Pilgrimage of Grace protest against the dissolution of the monasteries. For most of the period the sheriffs of Yorkshire remained in control of the castle, although there were some notable exceptions such as the appointment of the royal favourite Sir Robert Ryther by Edward IV in 1478. At the end of the 16th century, however, the Clifford family (Earls of Cumberland), became the hereditary constables of the castle, and Clifford&#x27;s Tower took its name from the family at around this time.

The deterioration of the castle continued into the reign of Elizabeth I, who was advised that it no longer had any military utility. Robert Redhead, the tower keeper, became infamous at the time for taking parts of the castle to pieces and selling off the stonework for his own profit. Despite numerous attempts by local city and crown officials to halt this, Redhead continued to cause considerable damage before being forced to stop. Proposals were made to pull down Clifford&#x27;s Tower altogether in 1596, but were turned down because of the strength of local feeling.

===17th century===
Maintaining the castle was becoming increasingly expensive, and in 1614 King James sold the lease on Clifford&#x27;s Tower and the surrounding land to John Babington and Edmund Duffield, a pair of property speculators. In turn, Babington and Duffield sold Clifford&#x27;s Tower to a York merchant family. In 1642, however, the English Civil War broke out between the rival factions of the Royalists and Parliament. Forces loyal to Charles I, under the command of Henry Clifford, garrisoned York Castle and the surrounding city in 1643. York effectively became the &quot;northern capital&quot; for the Royalist cause. Clifford repaired the castle and strengthened the walls to permit them to support cannon, placing his arms alongside those of the king above the entrance. Clifford&#x27;s Tower&#x27;s gatehouse was substantially remodelled, losing its original medieval appearance. Baile Hill, on the other side of the river, became a gun emplacement. The castle mint was reopened to supply the king&#x27;s forces with coins.

The war turned against the Royalist factions, and on 23 April 1644 Parliamentary forces commenced the siege of York. A Scottish army under Alexander Leslie came from the south, while a Parliamentary force under Ferdinando Fairfax came from the east. Six weeks later, Edward Montagu brought a third contingent to York, bringing the number of forces besieging the city to over 30,000 men. William Cavendish commanded the city during the siege, while Colonel Sir Francis Cobb was appointed the governor of the castle. Despite bombardment, attempts to undermine the walls and attacks on the gates, the city held out through May and June. Prince Rupert, sent to relieve York, approached with reinforcements, and through clever manoeuvring was able to force the besiegers to withdraw, lifting the siege on 1 July. The next day, Parliamentary forces defeated Rupert at the Battle of Marston Moor, six miles west of York, making the surrender of York and the castle inevitable. On 14 July the city and castle surrendered to the Parliamentary forces, who permitted the Royalists to march out with full honours.

Parliament then appointed Thomas Dickenson, the local mayor, as the governor of Clifford&#x27;s Tower. Control of the castle rested with the post of mayor until the Restoration. Efforts were made to separate the structures of Clifford&#x27;s Tower, which Parliament used as a garrison, from the buildings of the bailey, which continued to be used as a prison. Oliver Cromwell visited Clifford&#x27;s Tower in 1650, and received a salute from the guns stationed on top of it. The cost of the garrison was levied on the city of York.
After the Restoration of Charles II, the pre-war owners of the property laid claim to Clifford&#x27;s Tower, eventually being granted ownership. A garrison continued to be stationed there, however, which prevented the owners from actually occupying or using the property. Repairs were made to the tower, and it became a magazine for storing gunpowder and shot. Attempts were made to restore the condition of the moat, which had become badly silted. Some political prisoners continued to be held at the castle during the Restoration period, including George Fox, the founder of the Society of Friends.

The county facilities in the bailey were expanded during these years, with improvements to the Grand Jury House and the Common Hall, but by the 1680s the role of the military garrison at York Castle was being called into question. Sir Christopher Musgrave produced a report for the Crown in 1682; he argued that it would cost at least £30,000 to turn the castle into a modern fortification, producing a proposal for the six bastions that such a star fort would require. This work was never carried out. Meanwhile, the garrison and the castle had become extremely unpopular with the people of York, who disliked both the cost and the imposition of external authority.

On St George&#x27;s Day in 1684 at around 10 pm, an explosion in the magazine destroyed the interior of Clifford&#x27;s Tower entirely. The official explanation was that the celebratory salute from the guns on the roof had set fire to parts of the woodwork, which later ignited the magazine. Most historians, however, believe the explosion was not accidental. At the time, it was common in the city to toast the potential demolition of the &quot;Minced Pie&quot;, as the castle was known to locals; suspiciously, some members of the garrison had moved their personal belongings to safety just before the explosion, and no-one from the garrison was injured by the event. The heat of the fire turned the limestone of the tower to its current, slightly pink, colour. The now-ruined tower was returned fully to private ownership, eventually forming part of the lands of the neighbouring house and gardens belonging to Samuel Waud.

===18th century===
 By 1701, the conditions of the county gaol had become scandalous and the decision was taken to redevelop the area occupied by the old bailey. A local tax helped to fund the development, and the king agreed for the ruins of St Mary&#x27;s Abbey to be cannibalised for building stone. Three new buildings were erected to the south of Clifford&#x27;s Tower. A new county gaol, built between 1701 and 1705 by William Wakefield, was placed on the south side, closely resembling the fashionable work of John Vanbrugh. The local architect John Carr then built the Assize Courts on the site of the old Jury House between 1773 and 1777 on the west side, and oversaw the replacement of the Sessions House and Common Hall by the Female Prison between 1780 and 1783 on the east side. The Female Prison and county gaol were later combined to become the Debtors&#x27; Prison. Both of Carr&#x27;s buildings were designed in a distinctive neoclassical style; the Assize Court building was particularly praised at the time as being &quot;a superb building of the Ionic order&quot;. The castle courtyard was grassed over to form a circle in 1777 and became known as the &quot;Eye of the Ridings&quot; because it was used for the election of members of parliament for York.

Visits by the prison reformer John Howard as part of the research for his book &quot;The State of the Prisons&quot; found these prisons flawed, but in relatively good condition compared to others at the time. The Debtors&#x27; Prison as a whole was an &quot;honour to the county&quot; of York, with &quot;airy and healthy&quot; rooms, but the felons&#x27; wing of the prison attracted some criticism. The felons&#x27; wing was &quot;too small&quot; and had &quot;no water&quot; for the inmates; felons were forced to sleep on piles of straw on the floor. Indeed, conditions were so bad in the felons&#x27; wing that nine prisoners suffocated in one night during 1739.

Just outside the main walls, the castle mills had become increasingly ineffective from the 16th century onwards because of a reduction in the flow of the rivers driving the water-wheels. As a result, in 1778 they were rebuilt with a new steam engine to drive the machinery; this steam engine caused considerable discomfort to the prisoners affected by the smoke and noise.

===19th century===

Criticism of the castle prison increased at the end of the 18th century. The facilities were felt to be inadequate and the crowds of spectators who gathered outside the prison to see inmates being taken into York for execution unseemly. Attempts were made to improve the way executions were carried out from 1803 onwards: the former castle courtyard, the Eye of the Ridings, was used for this purpose instead, although crowds still gathered outside the bailey to watch the slow deaths of the prisoners. By 1813 the execution process had been sped up by the introduction of the &quot;short drop&quot; method of hanging, allowing the unusually rapid execution of fourteen Luddite agitators at the castle in 1814. Overcrowding in the jail was now also a problem, with up to 114 prisoners being held at any one time; occasionally, around forty prisoners awaiting trial had to be kept in the jail yard for lack of space elsewhere. Other radicals imprisoned there included Joshua Hobson and Alice Mann in 1836.

The suitability of the prison was finally brought to a head at the 1821 assizes in York, when an official complaint was made and an investigation begun. The decision was taken to purchase Clifford&#x27;s Tower and the Waud house, with the aim of demolishing them both to make room for a new, more modern prison. Sydney Smith, the famous wit, writer and vicar of Foston-le-Clay, successfully led a campaign to save Clifford&#x27;s Tower, emphasising the historic importance of the location for the surrounding city. An alternative proposal, put forward by architect Robert Wallace, would have seen the conversion of Clifford&#x27;s Tower back into a habitable building to form the hub of a radial prison design, but this was turned down.

In 1825, Clifford&#x27;s Tower and the Waud house were purchased by the county of Yorkshire at the cost of £8,800 () The new prison buildings, designed by architects P. F. Robinson and G. T. Andrews, were constructed in a Tudor Gothic style, including a gatehouse high and a radial prison block, protected by a long, high stone wall. The prison, considered to be the strongest such building in England, was built entirely of stone to be both secure and fireproof. Dark grey gritstone was used in the construction to produce a forbidding appearance, although the prison itself was considered healthy and well ventilated.
Clifford&#x27;s Tower played no part in the formal design of the prison, although the talus, or sloping edge of the motte, was cut away and replaced by a retaining wall to allow more space for the new prison building. The backyard of the Female Prison, concealed from public view by the new wall, was used for hangings from 1868 onwards.

The Prison Act, 1877, reformed the English prison system, and York Castle gaol was passed into the control of central government the following year. It was used as the county prison until 1900, when the remaining prisoners were transferred to Wakefield Prison, and from then onwards the facility was used as a military prison instead.
By the early 19th century, dredging and other improvements to the river Foss had made it possible to import flour into York by river, reducing the economic significance of the castle mills. In 1856, the castle mills were finally demolished as part of a further sequence of improvements to this part of the river. The King&#x27;s Pool that formed part of the castle&#x27;s water defences was drained. With the construction of several new bridges near the castle, the site became &quot;surrounded by roads instead of moats&quot;. Some major trials took place at the Assizes (now Crown Court) building of York Castle in the 19th century, including that of Mary Fitzpatrick who was accused of murder.

=== 20th century ===
In 1890 the Prison Commissioners agreed to declare Clifford&#x27;s Tower a national monument and to conserve it as a historic location. In 1902 Clifford&#x27;s Tower was given to the York Corporation, together with a grant of £3,000 () arranged by Lord Wenlock for conservation and repairs. The removal of the talus and the damage to the castle stonework in the 16th century had put excessive pressure on the supporting motte, causing a recurrence of the 14th-century subsidence. Sir Basil Mott, a leading Victorian engineer, installed concrete underpinnings to stabilise the structure beneath the gatehouse. By the early 20th century, Clifford&#x27;s Tower was regularly open to visitors, and in 1915 it was passed to the Office of Works as a national monument. The castle was historically excluded from York&#x27;s municipal boundaries; it was formally absorbed into the city in 1968.

==Today==

York Prison finally closed in 1929, and the Tudor Gothic Victorian prison buildings were demolished in 1935. The Assize Courts building now houses the York Crown Court, while the former Debtors&#x27; Prison and Female Prison, together with a modern entrance area, are now the Castle Museum. The circular grassed area between these buildings that was once known as the &quot;Eye of the Ridings&quot; is now known as Castle Green, or the &quot;Eye of York&quot;. Clifford&#x27;s Tower is the most prominent surviving part of the original medieval fortification, although the stone steps up the side of the motte are modern. Fragments of the bailey wall, parts of the south gatehouse and one of the corner towers also survive.

The castle is classed as a Grade I listed building and a scheduled monument. The site, managed by English Heritage, is open to the public. Until the 1970s, the pogrom of 1190 was often underplayed by official histories of the castle; early official guides to the castle made no reference to it. In 1978, however, the first memorial tablet to the victims was laid at the base of Clifford&#x27;s Tower, and in 1990 the 800th anniversary of the killings was commemorated at the tower. Recently, commercial interests have sought to introduce retail development to the area surrounding it. Citizens, visitors, academics, environmentalists, local businesspeople and Jewish groups have opposed the development with some success, winning a lengthy and bitter public inquiry in 2003.

In March 2022 an English Heritage conservation project, including work on the limestone fabric of the tower and care of the chapel roof, was completed. New internal access stairways of gluelam timber leading to a new roof deck allow visitors a close view of some original features of the building and less-crowded viewpoints over the city.

<text>Harlow is a town and local government district located in the west of Essex, England. Founded as a new town in 1947, it is situated on the border with Hertfordshire, and occupies a large area of land on the south bank of the upper Stort Valley, which has been made navigable through other towns and features a canal section near its watermill.

Old Harlow is a historic village founded by the early medieval age and most of its high street buildings are early Victorian and residential, mostly protected by one of the Conservation Areas in the district. In Old Harlow is a field named Harlowbury, a de-settled monastic area which has the remains of a chapel, a scheduled ancient monument. The M11 motorway passes through to the east of the town. Harlow has its own commercial and leisure economy. It is also an outer part of the London commuter belt and employment centre of the M11 corridor which includes Cambridge and London Stansted Airport to the north.

At the time of the 2011 Census, Harlow&#x27;s population was recorded at 81,944 and its district had the third-highest proportion of social housing in England, 26.9%, a legacy of the 1947 commitment to re-house blitzed London families after World War II and provide a percentage of homes for other needy families who cannot afford market rents.

==Etymology==

There is some dispute as to where the place name Harlow derives from. One theory is that it derives from the Anglo-Saxon words &#x27;here&#x27; and &#x27;hlaw&#x27;, meaning &quot;army hill&quot;, probably to be identified with Mulberry Hill, which was used as the or meeting place for the district.

The other theory is that it derives from the words &#x27;here&#x27; and &#x27;hearg&#x27;, meaning &quot;temple hill/mound&quot;, probably to be identified with an Iron Age burial mound, later a Roman temple site on River Way.

==History==

===Early history===
The earliest deposits are of a Mesolithic (circa 10,000 BC) hunting camp excavated by Davey in Northbrooks in the 1970s (Unpublished) closely followed by the large and unexcavated deposits of Neolithic flint beside Gilden Way. These deposits are mostly known because of the large numbers of surface-bound, worked flint. Substantial amounts of worked flint suggest an organised working of flint in the area. Large amounts of debitage litter the area and tools found include axe heads, hammers, blades, dowels and other boring tools and multipurpose flints such as scrapers. An organised field walk in the late 1990s by Bartlett (unpublished) indicates that most of the area, some 80 hectares, produced worked flint from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age with a smattering of Mesolithic. This indicates organised industry existed from 5000 BC to 2000 BC. The deposits are so large and dispersed that any major archaeological work in the area will have to take this into consideration before any ground work is started. Harlow was in Roman times the site of a small town (around Harlow Mill railway station) with a substantial stone built temple.

===Later history===
The entry in the Norman Domesday Book reads: &quot;Herlaua: St Edmunds Abbey before and after 1066; Geoffrey from Count Eustace; Thorgils from Eudo the Steward; Richard from Ranulf, brother of Ilger. Mill, 7 beehives, 8 cobs, 43 cattle, 3 foals.&quot; The mill is now a 300-year-old listed building and restaurant.

The original village, mentioned in the Domesday Book, developed as a typical rural community around what is now known as Old Harlow, with many of its buildings still standing. This includes for instance the Grade II listed St Mary&#x27;s Church in Churchgate Street. Its former Chapel is in a ruinous state in a field which was once the Harlowbury Abbey part of Old Harlow, is Grade I listed and is a scheduled ancient monument.

Kingsmoor House on Paringdon Road is a Grade II* listed building and dates from the 18th century. It was built as a gentleman&#x27;s residence and owned by local families including the Risden, Houblon and Todhunter families. It was later used as a private school and council offices before falling derelict. It has since been restored and converted into residential apartments.

===The New Town===
Harlow was one of several towns to be built around a pre existing village,Harlow was designated a new town on 25 March 1947. It was one of several new towns built under the New Towns Act of 1946, passed after World War II to ease overcrowding in London and the surrounding areas due to the devastation caused by the bombing during the Blitz. Other post-war new towns included Basildon, Stevenage and Hemel Hempstead. The master plan for Harlow was drawn up in 1947 by Sir Frederick Gibberd. The town was planned from the outset and was designed to respect the existing landscape. Sylvia Crowe, the landscape architect, worked on Harlow New Town between 1948 and 1958. A number of landscape wedges - which later became known as Green Wedges - were designed to cut through the town and separate the neighbourhoods of the town. The development incorporated the market town of Harlow, now a neighbourhood known as Old Harlow, and the villages of Great Parndon, Latton, Tye Green, Potter Street, Churchgate Street, Little Parndon, and Netteswell. Each of the town&#x27;s neighbourhoods is self-supporting with its own shopping precincts, community facilities and pubs. Gibberd invited many of the country&#x27;s leading post-war architects to design buildings in the town, including Philip Powell and Hidalgo Moya, Leonard Manasseh, Michael Neylan, E C P Monson, William Crabtree, Maxwell Fry, Jane Drew, Graham Dawbarn, H. T. Cadbury-Brown and Gerard Goalen. Goalen designed his first church in the town, Our Lady of Fatima, which is a Grade II* listed building.

Harlow has one of the most extensive cycle track networks in the country, connecting all areas of the town to the town centre and industrial areas. The cycle network is composed mostly of the original old town roads. The town&#x27;s authorities built Britain&#x27;s first pedestrian precinct, and first modern-style residential tower block, The Lawn, constructed in 1951; it is now a Grade II listed building. Gibberd&#x27;s tromp-l&#x27;oeil terrace in Orchard Croft and Dawbarn&#x27;s maisonette blocks at Pennymead are also notable, as is Michael Neylan&#x27;s pioneering development at Bishopsfield. The first neighbourhood, Mark Hall, is a conservation area. From 1894 to 1955 the Harlow parish formed part of the Epping Rural District of Essex. From 1955 to 1974, Harlow was an urban district. On 1 April 1974 the parish and urban district was abolished and it became an unparished area.

The town centre, and many of its neighbourhood shopping facilities have undergone major redevelopment, along with many of the town&#x27;s original buildings. Subsequently, many of the original town buildings, including most of its health centres, the Staple Tye shopping centre and many industrial units have been rebuilt. Gibberd&#x27;s original town hall, a landmark in the town built in 1958, was demolished and replaced by Harlow Civic Centre and The Water Gardens shopping area in the 2000s.

===Redevelopment===
Since becoming a new town, Harlow has undergone several stages of expansion, the first of which was the &quot;mini expansion&quot; that was created by the building of the Sumners and Katherines estates in the mid-to-late seventies to the west of the existing town. Since then Harlow has further expanded with the Church Langley estate completed in 2005, and its newest neighbourhood Newhall has completed the first stage of its development, with the second stage underway in 2013. The Harlow Gateway Scheme, also completed, first involved the relocation of the Harlow Football Stadium and the building of a new hotel, apartments and a restaurant adjacent to Harlow Town railway station. Phase 2 of this scheme involved the construction of 530 eco-homes on the former sports centre site and the building of the Harlow Leizurezone adjacent to the town&#x27;s college in the early 2010s.

Other major developments under consideration include both a northern and southern bypass of the town, and significant expansion to the north, following the completed expansion to the east. The Harlow North plans, currently awaiting permission, involve an extension of the town across the floodplains on the town&#x27;s northern border, into neighbouring Hertfordshire. The plan was supported by former MP Bill Rammell, all three political groups on Harlow Council, and the East of England Regional Assembly. It is opposed by Hertfordshire County Council, East Herts Council, Mark Prisk, MP for Hertford and Stortford in whose constituency the development would be, and all the parishes concerned. The opposition is coordinated by a local group based in neighbouring East Hertfordshire. An attempt to have Harlow North designated an &quot;Eco Town&quot; was rejected by the Minister for Housing, Caroline Flint MP, in April 2008.

The south of the town centre also underwent major regeneration, with the new Civic Centre being built and the town&#x27;s famous Water Gardens being redeveloped in the 2000s, a landscape listed by English Heritage. Despite this development, the main shopping area of the town has been stagnating for some time, not helped by the closure of two of the Harvey Centre&#x27;s anchor tenants - these being BHS and M&amp;S.

In 2004, Harlow businessman Mo Ghadami won his High Court case to block a multimillion-pound extension of the town&#x27;s Harvey Centre. The Iranian-born entrepreneur, who presented his case in person, persuaded Mr Justice Richards to quash Harlow DC&#x27;s grant of planning permission for the development. In his judgment he backed Mr Ghadami&#x27;s claim of &#x27;apparent bias or predetermination&#x27; in the decision, as a result of the continued participation of Michael Garnett, the chairman of the planning committee, in the planning process after he had attempted in telephone calls to persuade Mr Ghadami to consent to the scheme.

In 2011, the government announced the creation of an enterprise zone in the town. Harlow Enterprise Zone consists of two separate sites under development, at Templefields and London Road, with the London Road site divided into north and south business parks.

In 2022, Harlow Council was awarded £23.7 million from the government&#x27;s Towns Fund to be used for several large investments in the town. These include the development of a new bus station and transport hub, regeneration of Broad Walk in the town and a new sustainable transport corridor between the town centre and Harlow Town station. The majority of these works are underway as of mid 2024, with completion of the programme expected by March 2026.

===Permitted development (office to residential) flats===
A government policy to allow developers to convert office space to residential has led to a proliferation of new &#x27;rabbit hutch&#x27;-sized flats, which are then let to London-borough waiting-list families. These are erected under permitted development rights which mean the local authority cannot refuse planning permission.

==Environment==

A major feature of Harlow New Town is its green spaces; over one third of the district is parkland or fields containing public footpaths. One of the original design features of Gibberd&#x27;s masterplan is the Green Wedges in the town, designed to provide open space for wildlife and recreation and to separate neighbourhoods. 23% of the district is designated as Green Wedge. The Green Wedges are protected from inappropriate development, through the Local Plan.

The town is entirely surrounded by Green Belt land, a land designation which originated in London to prevent the city sprawling, and 21% of the district is allocated as Green Belt. The National Planning Policy Framework states that one of the purposes of Green Belt land is to protect unrestricted sprawl from large built-up areas.

Harlow Town Park, at a size of 71.6-hectares (just under 1 km2), is one of the largest urban parks in the country. The multi-functional park has been used for recreation and enjoyment for over 50 years. This park is in the centre Netteswell ward and is between the town centre and the railway station, both of which are within walking distance of the park, which is a natural thoroughfare from the station to the town centre.

There are only 12 parks with significant post-war element on the English Heritage &#x27;Register of Parks&#x27;. With these Harlow is seen as one of the first examples of a civic scheme to marry the modern science of town and country planning.

==Economy==
Harlow was originally expected to provide a majority of employment opportunities in manufacturing, with two major developments of The Pinnacles and Templefields providing the biggest employers in the region; as with the rest of the country, this manufacturing base has declined and Harlow has had to adjust.

The original manufacturing took the form of a biscuit factory, on the Pinnacles. Owned and run as a co-op, it provided employment to the town for over 50 years, before closing in 2002. It has since been demolished and the site now has small industrial units. At its peak, the factory employed over 500 people.

Raytheon and GlaxoSmithKline both have large premises within the town. 
In July 2017 Public Health England had bought the vacant site from GSK (GlaxoSmithKline) hoping to move altogether 2,745 jobs there, of which about 500 are from Porton Down.

Nortel had a large site on the eastern edge of the town, acquired when STC was bought in 1991, and it was here that Charles K. Kao developed optical fibre data transmission. Nortel still has a presence, but it is much reduced. The site now is host to electronics, 
education and housing companies. 
One of Europe&#x27;s leading online golf stores, Onlinegolf, is based in Harlow.

Unemployment is frequently around 10%, higher than the national average in the UK. Harlow also has a large number of people in social housing, almost 30% of dwellings being housing association and local authority owned, and many more privately rented.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Harlow, at district and county level: Harlow Council and Essex County Council. The district council has been controlled by the Conservative Party since 2021. It is based at Harlow Civic Centre at the Water Gardens in the town centre.

The Member of Parliament (MP) for Harlow since the 2024 general election is Labour Chris Vince. He defeated Conservative candidate Hannah Ellis with a majority of 2,504 (5.8%).

In 2015 Harlow was the first town in Britain to take out a district wide injunction against unauthorised encampments by Travellers. However following a court hearing in July 2020 Harlow Council withdrew the injunction.

==Transport==

===Railway===
Harlow is served by two railway stations: Harlow Town and Harlow Mill; both are served by trains between London Liverpool Street and Cambridge. Harlow Town is also a stop on the Stansted Express, providing frequent services between London and Stansted Airport. All trains serving both stations are operated by Greater Anglia.

There are also frequent bus services from the town centre to Epping tube station, which is on London Underground&#x27;s Central line.

In 2021, Harlow District Council proposed extending the Central line from its eastern terminus at Epping to Harlow. It argued this would reduce travel times to Epping and London, and help with efforts add 19,000 new homes to the town and expand the population to 130,000. However, no funding has been allocated for this proposed extension.

===Road===
Harlow can be accessed from junctions 7 and 7a of the M11 motorway, which runs from London to Cambridge. Junction 7 provides links to the southern areas of town, such as Church Langley and Potter Street. Junction 7a, located close to Old Harlow, began construction in 2020 and opened in 2022. The M11 motorway was planned originally to run to the west of Harlow, not to the east as it does today. Having planned for one of the two big industrial estates to be built to the west of the town for easy motorway access, Sir Fredrick Gibberd was appalled when the motorway was eventually built to the east of the town instead, describing it as &quot;just about the most monstrous thing to ever happen to me as a planner&quot; during a 1982 interview.

The M11 motorway places the town within a short distance of Stansted Airport, the A120 to Braintree via Great Dunmow, and the orbital M25 motorway.

Running through the town is the A414, a major road between Hemel Hempstead and Maldon; it links the town with the A10 to the west, which runs between London and King&#x27;s Lynn. Another major road running from Harlow is the A1184, which leads to the nearby town of Bishop&#x27;s Stortford via Sawbridgeworth.

===Air===
Bishop&#x27;s Stortford is the closest large town to Stansted Airport, though Harlow is only 10 miles from this major transport hub and therefore provides several hundred airport employees. The airport operator withdrew a planning application for a second runway after the General Election of 2010, when all major political parties opposed it. Further plans to expand the airport to boost capacity were proposed in 2020, but were rejected by Uttlesford District Council.

===Bus===
Harlow bus station provides a focal point for the town&#x27;s extensive bus network and serves as a regional hub for the local area. The current site was constructed between 2001 and 2003, containing 15 stands and a small visitor information centre.

In July 2022, Harlow Council unveiled plans to completely rebuild the bus station at a cost of £15m, along with the construction of a brand new integrated transport and cycle hub. Planning permission for the project was granted in January 2023, with construction beginning in May 2024.

Arriva Herts &amp; Essex operate a large number of local routes within the town. key destinations outside of Harlow include Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, Stansted Airport and Chelmsford. Arriva also operate the Greenline 724 route, providing a service between Harlow and Heathrow Airport via Hertford and Watford.

Central Connect also operate several local services within Harlow, as well as connections to other nearby towns, such as Epping, Ongar, Cheshunt and Waltham Abbey. First Essex operate a small number of routes. There is also a National Express coach service between Stansted Airport and Oxford via Luton and Milton Keynes.

====Harlow First Avenue Multi-Modal Corridor====

Essex County Council was involved in development to Harlow&#x27;s First Avenue, which was intended to reduce congestion and create better transport connections between the Newhall housing developments. The scheme was implemented in two phases, each phase focusing on developing First Avenue on either side of Howard Way. Phase two had an estimated cost of £4.4 million and was due to be completed in early 2010, phase one is already complete and is listed as having had £3.6 million of funding from the Community Infrastructure Fund (CIF). The scheme includes construction of a shared use cycleway and development to the bus service along First Avenue and into the Newhall development site where &#x27;high quality bus&#x27; services between Harlow town centre and Harlow Town railway station are listed as part of the intentions of the development.

==Healthcare==
Harlow is served by the NHS Princess Alexandra Hospital, situated on the edge of The High, which is the main Town Centre area of Harlow. This hospital has a 24-hour Accident &amp; Emergency and Urgent Care Centre.

Plans for the hospital to be rebuilt were first put in place in 2019. In May 2023, it was announced that the facility would be rebuilt by 2030 as part of a £20bn pledge by the government. Following Labour&#x27;s victory at the 2024 United Kingdom general election, these plans have currently been placed under review.

==Education==
Harlow contains seven state-funded secondary schools:

*Stewards Academy
*Mark Hall Academy
*St Mark&#x27;s West Essex Catholic School
*Burnt Mill Academy
* Passmores Academy
* Sir Frederick Gibberd College
*BMAT STEM Academy

St. Nicholas School is a private school in the town while Harlow College provides sixth form and further education. St Mark&#x27;s West Essex Catholic School and BMAT STEM Academy also provide sixth form education.

Brays Grove Community School and Specialist Arts College closed down in June 2008 due to decreasing pupil numbers over a number of years. Following the schools closure, the site was demolished and redeveloped into a £23 million state of the art Academy which Passmores School and Technology College relocated to in September 2011 opening as Passmores Academy.

In the 1980s, a further two secondary schools were closed, Latton Bush (now a commercial centre and recreational centre) and Netteswell (now forms part of the Harlow College Campus) is a major further educational centre, covering GCSEs, A-Levels, and many vocational subjects including Hair and Beauty Therapy, Construction, Mechanics, ICT, and a new centre for engineering recently opened. The college is currently under major regeneration and is due to open a new university centre in partnership with Anglia Ruskin University, covering mostly Foundation degrees in a variety of subjects relevant to local employers&#x27; needs.

An international campus of Memorial University of Newfoundland is located in Old Harlow.

Passmores Academy was where the first school TV series, Educating Essex, was filmed. The episodes were broadcast from September to November 2011; they were produced in the 2010-2011 academic year.

===Sir Frederick Gibberd College===
Named after the prominent architect associated with Harlow, Sir Frederick Gibberd College opened in 2019. Built (to a design by HLM Architects) by Caledonian Modular from 198 prefabricated modules, the school was forced to close in August 2023 due to concerns about structural irregularities. The DfE blamed poor workmanship for the structural issues; the school had not been built in accordance with its original architectural design. HLM said the firm had raised concerns with Caledonian&#x27;s approach to the technical delivery of the designs, both for Sir Frederick Gibberd College and for Haygrove School in Bridgwater; &quot;Unable to resolve our differences, we parted company with Caledonian and the projects were delivered by others.&quot; In December 2023, the DfE confirmed that the college would be demolished and rebuilt.

==Sport and leisure==

===Cricket===
Harlow Town Cricket Club was formed in 1960 as Stort Cricket Club and plays at Ash Tree Field. The club plays in division 2 of the Shepherd Neame Essex League, runs a junior section that play in the West Essex District Cricket Board League and has a girls team which play other girls teams in the county.

Harlow Town Cricket Club&#x27;s Pavilion recently underwent a six figure refurbishment to promote women&#x27;s and disabled cricket in Harlow and the whole of Essex. Essex County Cricket Club Ladies and disability sections use the club as well as the England disability teams.

Harlow has four cricket clubs. Harlow Cricket Club play in Division 3 of the Shepherd Neame Essex League and is based in Old Harlow. The club runs a junior section that play in the West Essex District Cricket Board League. Netteswell and Burnt Mill Cricket Club are based at Harlow Cricket Club, they are a social team that was founded around 1889. Near neighbours Potter Street and Church Langley Cricket Club play in the Herts and Essex League.

===Football===
The town&#x27;s football club Harlow Town F.C. play in the Isthmian League South Central Division, having been relegated from the Premier Division in the 2018–19 season.

The club is best known for its extended run in the 1979-80 FA Cup, where they reached the Fourth Round of the competition. This included wins against established Football League sides Southend United and most famously a 1–0 win over Leicester City in a replay, having drawn 1–1 at Filbert Street. Harlow were eventually eliminated by Watford, narrowly losing 4–3.

The club built a new stadium in 2006 at Barrows Farm, now named The Harlow Arena, with the old Harlow Sports Centre being converted into housing.

Les Smith, a Harlow resident, represented Great Britain at the 1992 Barcelona Paralympic Games. Les became one of the first disabled people to become a qualified football coach in 1993.

===Greyhound racing===
The Harlow Greyhound Stadium has been at its present site for over 20 years and has regular race meetings each week as well as hosting other sporting events.

===Rugby Union===
Harlow Rugby Football Club moved from Ram Gorse near The Pinnacles to a new location in mid 2017 located on Howard Way, Latton Bush, Harlow. The former site of the club has been turned into a housing estate affectionately called Ram Gorse Park. The first team plays in the London and South East Division IIl North East league. Currently, the training grounds are located near Pennymead.

===Other sports facilities===
The town has a leisure facility named the Harlow Leisurezone, built in the late 2000s next to Harlow College as part of the Gateway Project, which replaced the old Harlow Sports Centre, opened in 1960.

In the 2010s, investments have included its skate-park next to Burnt Mill Academy. The project has been funded by the investment of over £300,000, largely from Harlow Council with £57,500 from Sport England. The park is floodlit. The 650sq metre park is made from concrete, and has a bowl as well as a street course which contains quarter pipes, flat banks, rails and steps.

==Art and culture==
Harlow is the home to a major collection of public sculptures (over 100 in total) by artists such as Auguste Rodin, Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, Gerda Rubinstein and Ralph Brown. Many of these are owned by the Harlow Art Trust, an organisation set up in 1953 by the lead architect of Harlow Frederick Gibberd. Gibberd had idealistic notions of the New Town as a place where people who might not normally have access to art could enjoy great sculptures by great artists on every street corner. Consequently, almost all of Harlow&#x27;s sculpture collection is in the open air, in shopping centres, housing estates and parks around the town.

In 2009, Harlow Council voted to celebrate Harlow&#x27;s collection of sculpture by branding Harlow as &#x27;Harlow Sculpture Town – The World&#x27;s First Sculpture Town&#x27;. Harlow Sculpture Town began as an initiative from Harlow Art Trust, presenting itself as &#x27;Sculpture Town&#x27;, in a similar way to Hay-on-Wye&#x27;s presentation of itself as Booktown.

As part of the &#x27;Sculpture Town&#x27; branding, Harlow is also home to the Gibberd Garden, the former home of Frederick and Patricia Gibberd, which is a managed twentieth-century garden, and home to some of the Gibberd&#x27;s private sculpture collection. The Gibberd Gallery, in the Civic Centre, contains a collection of twentieth-century watercolours and temporary exhibitions.

Harlow&#x27;s Playhouse Theatre is in the town, which hosts shows and live comedy throughout the year and is the home to local community Arts group &quot;Livewire Theatre&quot; which has provided free arts access to young people since 2001.

Harlow has a local museum, which hold exhibitions and which contains artefacts on Harlow&#x27;s historic past, charting the story of the town through the ages. Harlow Museum is in Muskham Road, and is set within the grounds of a sixteenth-century manor building with walled gardens. The museum is run in conjunction with the Essex Records Office (ERO) which holds family history archives in the search room. Admission to the museum is currently free, but visitors are encouraged to make a donation to ensure future maintenance of services.

The Town of Harlow and Harlow New Town are cited in the song &quot;Get &#x27;Em Out by Friday&quot;, by progressive rock group Genesis, on their 1972 album &quot;Foxtrot&quot;.

The album &quot;Pram Town&quot;, described as a &quot;folk opera&quot;, is a concept album about Harlow by Darren Hayman and the Secondary Modern.

Harlow was home to The Square, named one of the Top 10 Small Venues in the UK by NME, but the venue was closed due to re-development of the site, and was demolished in 2018.

==Media==
Harlow is within the BBC London and ITV London region. Television signals are received from Crystal Palace TV transmitter, BBC East and ITV Anglia can also be received from the Sandy Heath TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Essex on 95.3 FM, Heart East (formerly Ten-17) on 101.7 FM, and Harlow Hospital Radio which broadcast to hospital patients at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in the town.

<doc id="349392" wikidata="Q1972764" url="?curid=349392" title="Welwyn">
<text>Welwyn is a village and civil parish in Hertfordshire, England. The parish also includes the villages of Digswell and Oaklands. It is sometimes referred to as Old Welwyn or Welwyn Village, to distinguish it from the much newer and larger settlement of Welwyn Garden City, about a mile to the south.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from Old English &quot;welig&quot; meaning &quot;willow&quot;, referring to the trees that nestle on the banks of the River Mimram as it flows through the village. The name itself is an evolution from &quot;weligun&quot;, the dative form of the word, and so is more precisely translated as &quot;at the willows&quot;, unlike nearby Willian which is likely to mean simply &quot;the willows&quot;.

Through having its name derived from &quot;welig&quot; rather than &quot;sealh&quot; (the more commonly cited Old English word for &quot;willow&quot;), &quot;Welwyn&quot; is possibly cognate with &quot;Heligan&quot; in Cornwall whose name is derived from &quot;helygen&quot;, the Cornish word for &quot;willow&quot; that shares a root with &quot;welig&quot;.

The nearby modern village of Digswell (around Welwyn North railway station) was originally called &#x27;High Welwyn&#x27; when first developed at the beginning of the 20th century.

==History==

Situated in the valley of the River Mimram, Welwyn has hosted human activity since the Palaeolithic with stone tools from that era having been found alongside the river and further inland across the area. Settlement across the area seems to have become established during the Bronze Age according to various recovered artefacts and crop marks left by round barrows and burial mounds from that period.

Iron Age remnants have not been detected until the Late Iron Age, with various local chieftain burials dated to the 1st Century BC gaining national prominence.

The Belgae Celtic culture colonised much of South-Eastern England in the 1st century BC, with Welwyn in the area believed to have been settled by the Catuvellauni tribe.

Following the Roman invasion, Welwyn was settled by the Romans. The area was marshy, and the settlement of Welwyn was a known fording point across the river since at least Roman times when the Roman road through the village was laid out, leading to the establishment of the settlement around the road and the ford. Many Roman artifacts have been found in and around the village, including the remains of several Roman villas close by.

The Welwyn Roman Baths (the remains of a third-century Roman bath house) have been preserved and are open to the public. One particular excavation revealed a large Roman cemetery very close to the site of the current church, which itself is known to date back to at least Saxon times (see below). The church lies directly alongside the route of the Roman road.

The archaeological record in Welwyn is nearly continuous from the late Iron Age (Celtic) through to recorded times, lacking proof of occupation only in the early Anglo-Saxon period. It is therefore likely that Welwyn has been continuously occupied for over 2000 years.

Welwyn was at the heart of the territory of the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Tewingas&quot; tribe and was the site of an early minster church. In 1990, a proposal was made to rename the village as &quot;Welwyn Minster&quot; to shake off the unpopular &quot;Old&quot; name.

The massacre on St. Brice&#x27;s day on 13 November 1002, when the Saxons turned on their newly settled Danish neighbours, is said to have commenced near Welwyn.

A Norman church was built on the site of the Saxon church about 1190. The nave of the present church (St Mary&#x27;s), was built in the 13th century, the chancel arch being the most obvious early structure. There are two medieval corbels at the east end of the south aisle. Patronage of the church passed through several hands until in 1549 it was sold to the Wilshere family, who lived at The Frythe until relatively recently.

Much later, in the 17th century, as it lies on the old Great North Road, it became an important staging post and a number of coaching inns remain as public houses. After the Great Northern Railway by-passed the village due to the objections of local landowners, Welwyn became less important. Having previously been seen as a town on par with Hatfield and Stevenage, it gradually was seen as a village. The 20th century brought major expansion to the area, as estates to the south, west and north of the village were built up.

==Historical descriptions==
Despite this long history, at the beginning of the 20th century Welwyn was regarded as a sleepy backwater. One writer wrote that &quot;Welwyn, a small town in the Maran Valley, can show little of interest beyond many quaint cottages, and the church&quot;.

In 1870–1872, John Marius Wilson&#x27;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Welwyn thus:
A fuller history is given in William Page&#x27;s &quot;A History of the County of Hertford&quot; in the Victoria History of the Counties of England series.

==Transport==

Welwyn was noted for its congestion since the beginning of the 20th century, but in 1927 it got what is claimed to be the first by-pass in Britain. The A1 was upgraded to motorway standards north of Welwyn in the 1960s, and in 1973 the motorway was extended south past the village, by-passing the existing by-pass. Today the village is the point where the six-lane motorway merges into four lanes and is the site of extensive traffic jams in the evening peak.

There had been extensive plans to widen the whole road through the area to eight lanes, and to upgrade the existing junction to create a long one-way system running the length of the village. These plans were shelved, but recently plans to provide a climbing lane at least on the section north of the village have been discussed.

Buses are provided by Arriva Shires &amp; Essex and Centrebus, with some assistance from Hertfordshire County Council. Arriva&#x27;s 300/301 Centraline service links Welwyn and Oaklands to the nearby towns of Stevenage, Welwyn Garden City, Hatfield, St Albans and Hemel Hempstead, as well as neighbouring villages Woolmer Green and Knebworth. The 301 additionally connects both the nearby hospitals in Stevenage and Welwyn Garden City, while the 300 provides a direct link to recreational areas such as Stanborough Lakes in Welwyn Garden City and Verulamium Roman town in St Albans.

Buses run every 15 minutes Monday–Friday, every 20 minutes Saturday, and hourly on Sunday. Additional bi-hourly service 314 is provided by Centrebus, connecting Welwyn to Codicote and Hitchin.

Green Line route 797 used to stop on the by-pass, providing an hourly direct link to areas of North London and the West End, however, the service ceased in September 2016.

The nearest railway station to Welwyn Village is Welwyn North in the nearby village of Digswell, about a mile east from the village, while Knebworth station, one stop nearer Stevenage, is easier for residents of Oaklands to access.

Trains are operated by Great Northern and run every 30 minutes Monday to Saturday south to London King&#x27;s Cross and north to Hitchin and Stevenage, with an hourly service to Letchworth and Cambridge and to Peterborough. On Sundays an hourly service operates from London to Cambridge only. There is no bus link to Welwyn North station, although buses do link to nearby Welwyn Garden City station and Knebworth station.

==Education==
There are two state schools in Welwyn and one independent school.

The larger state school is Welwyn St. Mary&#x27;s Church of England Primary School, situated off London Road which takes children aged between 4 and 11 years of age (Reception to Year 6). Originally built in 1940 as a secondary school, the school was later converted to a primary school. 
The second is Oaklands Primary School, which incorporates Acorns Preschool and Playgroup.

There is also Tenterfield Nursery School which is situated on London Road close to the primary school. It takes children aged 3 to 4 years of age.

Secondary state education is provided through schools in nearby towns, such as Monks Walk School and Stanborough School, in Welwyn Garden city.

There is an independent all-ages (nursery through to sixth form) coeducational school on the eastern outskirts of Welwyn called Sherrardswood School.

==Sports==
There are a tennis club, a sports and social club, a bowls club, a football club, and a cricket pitch in the village. These last two are part of Welwyn Garden City-based clubs.

==Local points of interest==

In the fields surrounding the nearby Danesbury House, now converted into accommodation, is a previously dilapidated and neglected former fernery which has been reinstated to its former glory The Danesbury Fernery – &#x27;the best fernery to be found in the Home Counties&#x27; designed by Anthony Parsons (then gardener for the Danesbury Estate) and constructed in a small chalk pit in the grounds of Danesbury Park by the younger James Pulham in 1859. In its day it was well admired, with one W. Robinson (writing in &quot;The English Flower Garden&quot;, published in 1883), stating that &quot;In the Home Counties there is probably not a better fernery than at Danesbury.&quot;

On the outskirts of Welwyn are the remains of a 3rd-century Roman bath-house, which was once part of the Dicket Mead villa. Local archaeologist Tony Rook discovered the villa and bath-house in the 1960s and excavated them with a team of archaeologists and volunteers from Welwyn Archaeological Society. The remains of the bath-house are now preserved in a vault under the A1 motorway. The site is now run by Welwyn Hatfield Museum Service and is sometimes opened to the public.

The Frythe is a Victorian mansion set in grounds just south of the village. It was privately occupied until 1934, then run as a hotel until the outbreak of World War II. During the war, it was the home of Station IX, a Special Operations Executive (SOE) factory designing and building weapons and tools for SOE activities in occupied Europe. After the war, it became a commercial research facility for first Unilever and then Smith, Kline &amp; French. GlaxoSmithKline, its successor company, wound down the site and sold it in 2010 for residential property development.

Between 1928 and 1951 Welwyn Studios was active, mainly providing supporting features. However, like Welwyn Components (another apparently eponymous business), Welwyn Studios was located in Welwyn Garden City.

Vincent van Gogh walked from London to visit his sister while she was staying in Welwyn; this is commemorated by a blue plaque on a building on Church Street.

==Twinning==
Welwyn is twinned with the village of Champagne-sur-Oise in the &quot;département&quot; of Val-d&#x27;Oise, just north of Paris. The connection is organised in Welwyn by the Welwyn Anglo-French Twinning Association (WAFTA). The twinning arrangement was entered into in 1973, as a result of a visit to Champagne-sur-Oise by the headmaster and pupils of St Mary&#x27;s School, Welwyn, setting up a cultural association which has continued since then.

Coincidentally, Champagne-sur-Oise is only about twenty miles from the River Marne, whose name is said to be the origin of the alternative name of Welwyn&#x27;s Mimram river – the Maran. This connection was brought about by a migration of the Catalauni, the Belgic tribe from the Champagne region of France, into England stretching north of the Thames from London, where the tribe was known as the Catuvellauni. In that respect, WAFTA claims to have resurrected a twinning link first forged nearly 2,000 years ago.

<text>Watford () is a town and non-metropolitan district with borough status in Hertfordshire, England, northwest of Central London, on the banks of the River Colne.

Initially a small market town, the Grand Junction Canal encouraged the construction of paper-making mills, print works, and breweries. While industry has declined in Watford, its location near London and transport links have attracted several companies to site their headquarters in the town. Cassiobury Park is a public park that was once the manor estate of the Earls of Essex.

The town developed next to the River Colne on land belonging to St Albans Abbey. In the 12th century, a charter was granted allowing a market, and the building of St Mary&#x27;s Church began. The town grew partly due to travellers going to Berkhamsted Castle and the royal palace at Kings Langley. A mansion was built at Cassiobury in the 16th century. This was partly rebuilt in the 17th century and another country house was built at The Grove.

The Grand Junction Canal in 1798 and the London and Birmingham Railway in 1837 resulted in Watford&#x27;s rapid growth, with paper-making mills such as John Dickinson at Croxley, influencing the development of printing in the town. Two brewers, Benskins and Sedgwicks, amalgamated and flourished in the town until their closure in the late 20th century. Hertfordshire County Council designates Watford to be a major sub-regional centre. Several head offices are based in Watford. International conferences and sporting events have also taken place in Watford, including the 2006 World Golf Championship, the 2013 Bilderberg Conference and the 2019 NATO summit which all took place at The Grove.

Watford became an urban district under the Local Government Act 1894 and a municipal borough by grant of a charter in 1922. The borough, which had 102,246 inhabitants in the 2021 census (up from 90,301 inhabitants at the 2011 census, an increase of 13.23%), is separated from Greater London to the south by Three Rivers District. Watford Borough Council is the local authority with the Mayor of Watford as its head – one of only 18 directly elected mayors in England and Wales.

==History==

===Early history===
There is evidence of some limited prehistoric occupation around the Watford area, with a few Celtic and Roman finds, though there is no evidence of a settlement until much later. Watford stands where the River Colne could be crossed on an ancient trackway from the southeast to the northwest. Watford&#x27;s High Street follows the line of part of this route. The town was located on the first dry ground above the marshy edges of the River Colne. 

The name Watford may have arisen from the Old English for &quot;waet&quot; (full of water – the area was marshy), or &quot;wath&quot; (hunting), and ford. St Albans Abbey claimed rights to the manor of Casio (then called &quot;Albanestou&quot;), which included Watford, dating from a grant by King Offa in AD 793.

The name Watford is first mentioned in an Anglo-Saxon charter of 1007, where &quot;Watforda&quot; is one of the places marking the boundary of &quot;Oxanhaege&quot;. It is not mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, when this area was part of St Albans Abbey&#x27;s manor of Cashio. In the 12th century the Abbey was granted a charter allowing it to hold a market here, and the building of St Mary&#x27;s Church began. The settlement&#x27;s location helped it to grow, since as well as trade along this north–south through route it possessed good communications into the vale of St Albans to the east and into the Chiltern Hills along the valley of the River Chess to the west. 

The town grew modestly, assisted by travellers passing through to Berkhamsted Castle and the royal palace at Kings Langley. A big house was built at Cassiobury in the 16th century. This was partly rebuilt in the 17th century and another substantial house was built nearby at The Grove. The houses were expanded and developed throughout the following centuries. Cassiobury became the family seat of the Earls of Essex, and The Grove the seat of the Earls of Clarendon.

In 1762, Sparrows Herne Turnpike Road was established across the Chilterns. The toll road approximately followed the route of the original A41 road. The location of a toll house can be seen at the bottom of Chalk Hill on the Watford side of Bushey Arches; set in an old flint stone wall is a Sparrows Herne Trust plaque.

In 1778, Daniel Defoe described Watford as a &quot;genteel market town, very long, having but one street.&quot;

===Industrial Revolution===
Watford remained an agricultural community with some cottage industry for many centuries. The Industrial Revolution brought the Grand Junction Canal (now Grand Union Canal) from 1798 and the London and Birmingham Railway from 1837, both located here for the same reasons the road had followed centuries before, seeking an easy gradient over the Chiltern Hills. The land-owning interests permitted the canal to follow closely by the river Gade, but the prospect of smoke-emitting steam trains drove them to ensure the railway gave a wide berth to the Cassiobury and Grove estates. Consequently, although the road and canal follow the easier valley route, the railway company was forced to build an expensive tunnel under Leavesden to the north of the town.

Watford&#x27;s original railway station opened in 1837 on the west side of St Albans Road, a small, single-storey red-brick building. It closed in 1858 when it was replaced by a new, larger station at Watford Junction approximately further south-east. The old station house still stands today; it is a Grade-II-listed building, now in the middle of a high density housing development, it and was for many years a second-hand car dealership. Watford Junction railway station is situated to the north east of the town centre.

These developments gave the town excellent communications and stimulated its industrial growth during the 19th and 20th centuries. The Grand Union Canal, allowed coal to be brought into the district and paved the way for industrial development. The Watford Gas and Coke Company was formed in 1834 and gas works built. The canal allowed paper-making mills to be sited at Croxley. The John Dickinson and Co. mill beside the canal manufactured the Croxley brand of fine quality paper. There had been brewing in Watford from the 17th century and, by the 19th century, two industrial scale brewers Benskins and Sedgwicks were located in the town. The parish church of St Mary&#x27;s was extensively restored in 1871. 

The town expanded slightly during this time. In 1851 a new street off the High Street was opened, King Street, followed by Queens Road and Clarendon Road in the early 1860s. During this time, Watford had a population of around 6,500 The railways also continued to expand from Watford during this period; the Watford and Rickmansworth Railway opened in 1862 as a short branch line via to , and another branch was added to in 1912. The original plan was to extend the Rickmansworth line south connecting Watford to Uxbridge; this scheme failed and both the Rickmansworth and Croxley branches closed.

Watford&#x27;s population had risen to 17,063 by 1891 to become very cramped. Local landowners sold land for the development of the town and it was bought up by commercial interests. Various factories and other works sprung up in Watford, mostly breweries and prints, but also engineering works, a steam laundry, a cold storage company and a cocoa processing plant. The town expanded rapidly, most of the new inhabitants moving in from London.

===20th century===
At the start of the 20th century the town was growing fast. New roads were laid out in Callowland, North Watford, and in West Watford on farmland. Many continued to live in the cramped and unsanitary houses in the yards and alley-ways opening off the High Street. Some of these people were among those who rioted in 1902 when the celebration for King Edward VII&#x27;s coronation was postponed. The council had a programme of slum clearance which stopped with the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Building council houses resumed after the war and in the 1920s the Harebreaks estate was developed.

By the 1920s, printing had become the biggest industry in Watford. The biggest printers in the town were Sun Printers Ltd and Odhams Press. Watford was the biggest printing centre in the world and many advances in printing were made in Watford. During World War II the prints were taken over by the government who used them to print propaganda. After the war, the printing industry began going into decline. Union activity was common in Watford and advances in technology meant much of the industry became obsolete. Odhams Press closed down in 1978 and The Sun moved out of Watford during the 1980s after market reforms allowed it to do so.

In 1925, the Metropolitan Railway Company built a branch to Watford, opening a station close to Cassiobury Park.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Watford was the home of the British designer furniture manufacturer Hille. At their premises on St Albans Road, designed by the modernist architect Ernő Goldfinger, the designer Robin Day conceived the polypropylene stacking chair, now recognised as a classic of modern design. Although Hille left the area in 1983, the listed Goldfinger building still stands on St Albans Road. Mod culture found expression through clubs such as the Ace of Herts in the 1960s.

The de Havilland factory at Leavesden was responsible for the manufacture of the aircraft engines and later became Leavesden Aerodrome, to the north of Watford. No longer operational, it was converted into Leavesden Film Studios, now famously the home of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films.

==Geography==

Watford developed on the River Colne in southern Hertfordshire, England, northwest of central London. Ethnicity is 61.9% white British, 2.3% Irish, 0.1% Gypsy or Irish traveller, 7.7% other white, 17.9% Asian/Asian British, 5.8% black or black British.

The borough had 102,246 inhabitants at the time of the 2021 census. The borough is separated from Greater London to the south by the urbanised parish of Watford Rural in the Three Rivers District. The Watford subdivision of the Greater London Urban Area, which includes much of the neighbouring districts, had a total population of 120,960 in the 2001 census.

==Religion==


As of the 2021 census, Watford&#x27;s religious profile roughly reflected that of England and Wales, with a larger Muslim and Hindu population than the average.

==Governance==
Watford has two tiers of local government, at district (borough) and county level: Watford Borough Council and Hertfordshire County Council.

Watford is one of only 15 authorities in England and Wales headed by a directly elected mayor. Dorothy Thornhill was the first directly elected mayor of Watford, elected in May 2002 and re-elected in May 2006 and May 2010. She was the first female directly elected mayor in England and the Liberal Democrats&#x27; first directly elected mayor.

Since 1999 Watford has been divided into 12 wards. Each ward has three councillors who are elected for a four-year term. Watford elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, for the Watford constituency. Prior to the establishment of this constituency in 1885 the area was part of the three seat constituency of Hertfordshire.

===Town twinning===
The council have made twinning links with five towns. The first was Mainz, Germany, in 1956, and the most recent is Pesaro, Italy, in 1988; the others are Nanterre, Novgorod, and Wilmington, Delaware. The council award an honorary status of Freedom of the Borough to certain individuals &quot;who have in the opinion of the council, rendered eminent services to the borough&quot;; as of 2020 there are three freemen: Elton John, and two local councillors involved in the twinning process.

===Administrative history===
The ancient parish of Watford was included in the hundred of Cashio. In 1835, Watford became the centre of a poor law union, and a workhouse was built in 18361837 at 60 Vicarage Road (then called Hagden Lane).

In 1850 a local board of health was established for the town. The local board district covered part of the parish of Watford and part of the neighbouring parish of Bushey. The Watford Local Board District came into effect on 15 August 1850, and the first board was elected the following month.

The local board was responsible for building the town&#x27;s waterworks and sewers. For a time the board held its meetings at an upper room of the waterworks on Local Board Road. In 1891 the board purchased Upton House at 14 High Street for £2,650, converting it to become their offices and meeting place, holding its first meeting in the building on 1 October 1891.

Under the Local Government Act 1894, the Watford Local Board was reconstituted as Watford Urban District Council with effect from 31 December 1894. The act also stipulated that parishes could not be partly in an urban district and partly outside it. The old parish of Watford was therefore split, with the part of the parish outside the urban district becoming the parish of Watford Rural with effect from the first parish meeting on 4 December 1894. At the same time, the parish of Bushey was split, with the part within the Watford Urban District becoming a parish called Bushey Urban, which was later renamed Oxhey in 1906. Watford Urban and Bushey Urban / Oxhey were both classed as urban parishes and so did not have parish councils of their own, but were directly administered by Watford Urban District Council. The two urban parishes merged in 1935 to form a single parish called Watford.

Watford became a municipal borough on 18 October 1922 when it was granted a charter of incorporation. The council was granted a coat of arms on 16 October 1922, two days before it became a borough.

Upton House at 14 High Street continued to serve as the meeting place and offices for Watford Urban District Council and then Watford Borough Council until 1940. In 1938 work began on building Watford Town Hall at the junction of Rickmansworth Road and Hempstead Road, and the building officially opened on 5 January 1940. Upton House was subsequently demolished in 1961 and Gade House built on the site.

Under the Local Government Act 1972 Watford kept the same boundaries, but changed from being a municipal borough to a non-metropolitan district with borough status.

== Economy ==
Watford is a major regional centre in the northern home counties. Hertfordshire County Council designates Watford and Stevenage to be its major sub-regional centres, heading its list of preferred sites for retail development.

The High Street is the main focus of activity at night having a high concentration of the town&#x27;s bars, clubs and restaurants. The primary shopping area is the Harlequin Shopping Centre, a large purpose-built indoor mall with over 140 shops, restaurants and cafes built during the 1990s, opened officially in June 1992. The owners of the shopping centre, Capital Shopping Centres, changed their name to Intu, resulting in The Harlequin changing name to &quot;intu Watford&quot; from May 2013. Carrying forward £4.5 billion of debt into 2020, the company was not able to survive the retail downturn due to the COVID-19 crisis, and went into administration in June 2020. The council owns part of the freehold the site, and feels that as the shopping centre is very popular (it was one of top 20 places to shop in the UK in 2019), it will remain open and viable.

The town contains the head offices of a number of national companies such as J D Wetherspoon, Camelot Group, Bathstore, and Caversham Finance (BrightHouse). Watford is also the UK base of various multi-nationals including Hilton Worldwide, TotalEnergies, TK Maxx, Costco, JJ Kavanagh and Sons, Vinci, Beko and TeleAdapt. Both the 2006 World Golf Championship and the 2013 Bilderberg Conference, took place at The Grove hotel. The town was home to the Scammell Lorries factory from 1922 until 1988. The site is now a residential area. Tandon Motorcycles, founded by Devdutt Tandon, were manufactured in Colne Way from 1947 until 1959.

==Parks==


===Cassiobury Park===
The name Cassiobury has had various spellings over time. It is derived from &#x27;Caegshoe&#x27;, which is believed to be the combination of &#x27;caeg&#x27;, a person&#x27;s name, and &#x27;hoe&#x27;, meaning a spur of land. When the land was granted to Sir Richard Morrison in the 16th century, it was called &#x27;Cayshobury&#x27;, with &#x27;bury&#x27; indicating a manor.

Cassiobury Park was formed from the grounds of Cassiobury House and consists of of open space. The house was demolished in 1927 and the Cassiobury Gates in 1970, for road widening. In July 2007, the park won a Green Flag Award, which recognises the best green spaces in the country. There is a children&#x27;s play area, which includes a paddling pool, play equipment, a bouncy castle, an ice cream van, a kiosk where one may buy food, and 10.25&quot; gauge miniature railway. The Grand Union Canal passes through the park. Cassiobury Park is host to the weekly 5k community event parkrun.

===Cheslyn House and Gardens===
Awarded Green Flag status since 2009, Cheslyn has been open to the public since 1965 as a formal gardens and house. The 3.5 acre gardens comprise a formal open area to the front and a semi-natural woodland area to the rear. Henry and Daisy Colbeck originally owned the house and gardens. Mr Colbeck was a renowned local architect, and designed Cheslyn House; he and his wife created the original gardens. The Colbecks travelled extensively, and this is reflected in the range of unusual and exotic plants in the gardens. Since the space has been open to the public it has been further developed, with new features added such as the pond, rock garden, large herbaceous borders and aviary.

===Woodside Park===
Awarded Green Flag status since 2011, Woodside Playing Fields cover approximately 59 acres of playing fields, sports facilities and woodland. The site comprises a range of sports facilities including an eight lane synthetic track and stadium, an indoor bowls green, a community centre, cricket squares, football pitches and Woodside Leisure Centre. Woodside Stadium is home to Watford Harriers Athletics Club and hosts national level events such as the British Milers Club Grand Prix.

==Heritage==
There are 92 nationally listed buildings in Watford. These include St Mary&#x27;s Church, which dates to the 12th century, and Holy Rood Church which dates to 1890.

St Mary&#x27;s is noted for its interior which was renovated in 1850 by the architect George Gilbert Scott and includes fine oak pews decorated in the Gothic Revival style. It also contains the Essex Chapel, which served at the burial place of the nobility of the Cassiobury Estate, including the Earls of Essex. The chapel contains a number of large, ornate marble tombs and memorials dating from the 16th century and later, and was described by Pevsner as &quot;the chief glory of Watford Church&quot;.

The Roman Catholic Church, Holy Rood, is a much later structure. Built in 1890 by John Francis Bentley, the architect responsible for Westminster Cathedral in London, it is noted as a particularity fine example of Gothic Revival architecture. The ornate interior contains stained glass by the designer Nathaniel Westlake.

Bushey Arches Viaduct is Grade II listed and was built in the 1830s by the London and Birmingham Railway. It crosses a traffic island at the bottom of the Lower High Street. A short distance north-west, the Colne Viaduct crosses the river on the outskirts of town, after which the railway enters Watford Tunnel; the south face of the original tunnels is ornately decorated and a listed building.

There are ten conservation areas in Watford; one Grade II Listed Park, and 240 locally listed buildings.

==Transport==

===Road===
Watford is located north-west of central London. Post World War II road-building has resulted in Watford being close to several motorway junctions on both the M1 motorway and the M25 London Orbital Motorway.

===Buses===
Watford is served by a number of different bus operators, including Arriva Kent Thameside, Arriva Shires &amp; Essex, Carousel, London Sovereign, Lucketts of Watford, Mullanys Coaches, Red Eagle Buses, Red Rose Travel, Sullivan Buses, Uno and Vale Travel. Oyster Cards are accepted on TfL routes 142 (towards Brent Cross) and 258 (towards Harrow) into London. &quot;Intalink Explorer&quot; and &quot;Hertfordshire SaverCard&quot; are accepted on all but the London Bus routes.

Journey time to London Euston is typically 16 minutes non-stop. The station is mainly served by frequent suburban and regional trains operated by London Northwestern, which run to and Milton Keynes and the cross-London Southern service to via .

Direct train services run from Watford Junction to Birmingham International station, for Birmingham Airport.


====Abandoned railway schemes====
In 2008, a proposal was made that Regional Eurostar services could run via Watford to Paris via Kensington Olympia. In 1999, the Select Committee on Environment, Transport and the Regions took the view that Watford was &quot;well placed to become an integrated transport hub&quot; and it recommended that &quot;services from Watford to Paris should commence as soon as possible.&quot; The Regional Eurostar scheme eventually came to nothing and was put on hold indefinitely.

A scheme to introduce light rail to Watford was conceived in 2009, when it was proposed that the Abbey Line should be converted to tram-train operation and run by Hertfordshire County Council. The project was cancelled due to the complications and expense of transferring the line from National Rail to the county council.

In 2013, the Croxley Rail Link project was approved to extend the London Underground Metropolitan line to Watford Junction by reinstating a stretch of the former Watford and Rickmansworth Railway. As part of the scheme, Watford Metropolitan station would have closed to passengers and been replaced by new stations on the reopened route at and . The project did not go ahead due to funding problems.

In August 2014, the transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin indicated that the government was actively evaluating the extension of Crossrail as far as , with potential Crossrail stops at , , , , , , and . This proposal was subsequently shelved in August 2016 due to &quot;poor overall value for money to the taxpayer&quot;.

===Air===
Elstree Airfield is east of Watford. Several private charter companies and flying clubs are based there. Watford is the base for 2F (Watford) Squadron, Air Training Corps.

===Waterways===
Watford is on the main Grand Union Canal route northwards from London. It now sees little commercial use, since the advent of the motorways, but the canal is used for recreational purposes. The River Gade and the River Colne flow through Watford.

===Cycling===
Watford town centre and the surrounding area is relatively compact and the terrain is generally quite flat. Over of new cycle routes have been developed in the town since 2003 and a range of cycle maps are available locally. In Watford, cycling to work makes up 2.2% of all journeys compared with 1.6% across the whole of Hertfordshire.

National Cycle Routes 6 and 61 run across the eastern and southern sides of the town, using the off-road Ebury Way and Abbey Way. There is a continuous cycle route through the north–south axis of the town centre, including the pedestrianised parts along The Parade and High Street. Cycle parking is provided at intermittent points in the town centre and at local centres in the wider town.

===&quot;North of Watford&quot; expression===
There is an expression, &quot;North of Watford&quot;, meaning locations north of Greater London. Alternatively, &quot;North of Watford Junction&quot; was used with similar meaning referring to Watford Junction railway station&#x27;s position as the last urban stop on the main railway line out of Euston. The phrase&#x27;s original use pre-dates the M1 motorway&#x27;s Watford Gap services, but current use may refer to either Watford or the Watford Gap services.

==Education==

The earliest records of schooling in Watford are of a schoolmaster named George Redhead in 1595, and of a Free School receiving an annual donation of £10 in 1640. The school consisted of &quot;a room over two houses belonging to the Church Estate, nearest the churchyard.&quot; In 1704, Elizabeth Fuller of Watford Place built a new Free School for forty boys and twenty girls on her land next to the churchyard, with rooms for a master and a mistress. In the mid-19th century, the recorded schools in Watford were Fuller&#x27;s Free School, by now in a poor state, and the separate boys and girls national schools of St Mary&#x27;s in Church Street. All offered elementary education.

The Free School closed in 1882, and its endowment contributed to founding the Watford Endowed Schools, which provided secondary education and charged fees. After these schools, now called the Watford Grammar School for Boys and the Watford Grammar School for Girls, moved to new sites in 1907 and 1912, the building housed the Watford Central school, which taught pupils up to the age of 14.
St Mary&#x27;s National Schools closed in 1922, and the site is now a car park. The London Orphan Asylum, later Reed&#x27;s School, was located near Watford Junction station between 1871 and 1940.

The only independent secondary school in the borough is Stanborough School, a day and boarding school operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. There are several independent schools nearby, including Purcell School, a specialist music school.

All the state-funded primary schools in Watford are co-educational. Under an earlier system, schools were divided into infant schools, covering Reception and Years 1 and 2, and junior schools, covering Years 3 to 6. Most such schools have amalgamated to form Junior Mixed Infant schools or (equivalently) primary schools, and all new schools are of this type.

Although all state-funded secondary schools in Hertfordshire are comprehensive, there is a great deal of differentiation in the southwestern corner of the county, centred on Watford but also including most of the Three Rivers district and Bushey in Hertsmere district.
Within this area, there are:

*partially selective schools, which offer a proportion of places according to ability or aptitude, and the rest to siblings or those living near the school: Parmiter&#x27;s School, Queens&#x27; School, Rickmansworth School, St Clement Danes School, Watford Grammar School for Boys and Watford Grammar School for Girls.
*Bushey Meads School, which selects 10% for technological aptitude and uses banded admissions to ensure a comprehensive intake for the remainder.
*non-selective Roman Catholic schools, whose intake is evenly spread: St Joan of Arc Catholic School and St Michael&#x27;s Catholic High School.
*other non-selective schools, whose intake is markedly affected by the above partially selective schools: Future Academies Watford, The Grange Academy and Westfield Academy.
*Falconer School, a school for boys with emotional and behavioural difficulties.
*University Technical College: The Watford UTC was a school for 14-19 year olds that operated between 2014 and 2023.

The partially selective schools and Bushey Meads School operate common admissions tests in mathematics and non-verbal reasoning each autumn. In addition to those seeking selective places, all applicants to Bushey Meads and Queens&#x27; School are required to take the tests, so they are taken by the majority of Year 6 children in the area. The partially selective schools also operate a common test and audition procedure to select children for specialist music places.

Results achieved by the schools at GCSE are also widely spread, including the three highest and the two lowest scoring state schools within Hertfordshire. The area also has by far the highest incidence in the county of children allocated to schools to which they had not applied.

The Watford Campus of West Herts College is the only grade 1 further education college in the United Kingdom according to a 2011 Ofsted report. The Centre for Missional Leadership (CML) is the Watford branch of the London School of Theology, Europe&#x27;s largest evangelical theological college.

<doc id="349413" wikidata="Q1774629" url="?curid=349413" title="Irvine, North Ayrshire">
<text>Irvine ( ; ; ) is a town and former royal burgh on the coast of the Firth of Clyde in North Ayrshire, Scotland. The 2011 Census recorded the town&#x27;s population at 33,698 inhabitants, making it the largest settlement in North Ayrshire, and 22nd largest settlement in Scotland. 

Irvine was designated at the fifth and final Scottish new town in November 1966. Irvine is the administrative centre and the seat of the North Ayrshire Council administration which has its headquarters based at Cunninghame House. Irvine was the site of Scotland&#x27;s 12th century military capital and former headquarters of the Lord High Constable of Scotland, Hugh de Morville. It also served as the capital of Cunninghame and was, at the time of David I, Robert II and Robert III, one of the earliest capitals of Scotland.

Despite being classed as a new town, Irvine has had a long history stretching back many centuries and was classed as a Royal Burgh. There are also conflicting rumours that Mary, Queen of Scots, stayed briefly at Seagate Castle. There is still a yearly festival, called Marymass, held in the town. Marymass refers to Mary Queen of Scots and is celebrated for around a week starting from the 15th of August, and was therefore Mary&#x27;s Mass hence Marymass.

The town became a haunt of Robert Burns, after he briefly worked a flax-dresser in a heckling shop near the Glasgow Vennel. Two streets in the town are named after him: Burns Street and Burns Crescent.

== Etymology ==
One interpretation of the placename is that it means &#x27;green river&#x27; as in the Welsh river named Irfon. It has had many variants, such as Irwyn (1322), Ervin (1259) Irewin (1429–30), Irrvin (1528), and Irwin (1537). Another author lists Yrewin, c.1140; Irvin, c.1230; Orewin, c.1295, with a meaning of &#x27;west flowing river.&#x27; &quot;Eriwine&quot; and &quot;Erwinne&quot; are also old English first names. A parish in Annandale in Dumfriesshire has the name Irving. In the 12th century a Gilchrist, son of Eruini, witnessed a charter in Galloway and this is the earliest use of the name so far discovered.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Part of modern Irvine contains the oldest continually inhabited village in Europe. Dreghorn, a separate village on the outskirts of Irvine, appears to contain archaeological remains dating back to the first incursions of humanity into Scotland (Mesolithic). Iron Age Hill forts are abundant around Dreghorn.

The Grannie stone (or Granny Stane) is described as &quot;one of Irvine&#x27;s prehistoric puzzles&quot;, this boulder is either left behind from the Ice Age or is the last remaining stone of a stone circle; others were removed, by blasting, after the Irvine weir was constructed in 1895, but popular protests saved this remaining stone. The Grannie Stane is visible when the water is low.

===Middle Ages===

The medieval parish of Irvine was one of the most important regions in Scotland. Originally the site of the Military Headquarters of the Lord High Constable of Scotland, and one of the earliest Scottish Capitals, it served as an HQ to no fewer than three kings. King John I of Scotland inherited the lordship of Irvine sometime in the mid-13th century. Robert the Bruce, in an attempt to seize John&#x27;s lands, made sure that he secured the town. From Bruce, it passed to his grandson Robert the Steward, future King Robert II of Scotland.

Irvine is the site of an incident in 1296 (during the Scottish Wars of Independence) when an English army marched to Irvine to engage the Scottish army, encamped at Knadgerhill; the English arrived only to find that dissension amongst the Scots leaders was so great that armed conflict would not occur, and many of the leaders would end up changing sides and joining King Edward I. Bourtreehill House, the only major Estate in the parish, was periodically possessed by all three kings, and possibly the Constables of Scotland before them.

In December 2010, the writer A. J. Morton stated that Irvine was a &quot;Lost Medieval Capital&quot; and a likely candidate in the debate surrounding the Stone of Destiny and its location before it was moved to Scone. Citing Hector Boece, who said the Stone was kept at Evonium (a legendary city and home to the early Scottish crown), Morton said that Irvine&#x27;s early high status position in the 12th century supported the theory that Irvine is Evonium. Morton wrote:
In 1618, John Stewart (said to be a vagabond or juggler) and Margaret Barclay, wife of Archibald Dean (a burgess of Irvine), were tried for witchcraft. They were accused of sinking a ship called &quot;The Gift of God of Irvine&quot; belonging to John Dean, Barclay&#x27;s brother-in-law. Margaret Barclay was alleged to have wished the crew would be eaten by crabs at the bottom of the sea. Stewart hung himself, and Barclay was tortured, found guilty by her confession, and executed along with Isobel Scherer, herself accused of the same acts.

===Trindlemoss Loch===

Trindlemoss Loch, Scotts Loch, or the Loch of Irvine was situated in a low-lying area running from Ravenspark to near Stanecastle and down to Lockwards, now represented only by the playing fields off Bank Street. The loch was natural, sitting in a hollow created by glaciation. The loch waters were progressively drained and in 1691 this was finally achieved. The loch and its adjacent land was purchased by the Reverend Patrick Warner (minister in Irvine 1688–1702),who had sought refuge in the Netherlands after the Battle of Bothwell Bridge. It has been suggested that it was during this exile that he learned the skill of land reclamation.

===Irvine Harbour===
The harbour for Irvine has a long history and once was one of the most prominent ports in Scotland after Glasgow. Across from the main harbour itself there was a terminal for the ICI-Nobel Explosives plant on the River Garnock. Much of the harbour went into decline in the 19th century when Glasgow, Greenock and Port Glasgow achieved higher prominence as sea ports. Despite this, there was still commercial sea traffic, though the harbour went into further decline in the 20th century. The main shipping in the 20th century was light coastal traffic and vessels destined for the Nobel Explosives facility. This facility had its own quay, which, although now disused, is still visible from Irvine Harbour. A shipyard on the River Irvine, the Ayrshire Dockyard Company, remained active until after World War II, though its last ship was built just prior to the war. Afterwards it was involved in refitting ships and also in the manufacture of fittings for other vessels including the Cunard liner Queen Elizabeth 2. Irvine Harbour is now officially closed as a commercial port and houses a small number of privately owned pleasure craft. It is also home to part of the Scottish Maritime Museum with numerous vessels on display, including the &#x27;Spartan&#x27;, one of the last surviving Clyde puffers.

Irvine Harbour is home to a unique and distinctive building which marked the tide level. It was built in 1906 and devised by Martin Boyd, the harbourmaster at that time. The Automatic tide signalling apparatus indicated the tide&#x27;s state in two ways depending on the time of day. During daylight, the level was marked with a ball and pulley system attached to the mast. At night, a number of lamps marked the tidal level. Unfortunately the building fell into some disrepair and the mast partially dismantled. In 2013 an initiative by Coastwatch Scotland, a Voluntary Coastal Monitoring and Safety organisation, got underway in an attempt to turn the building into a watch tower for the benefit of the people of Irvine and visitors. In November 2016 the first stage was completed with an overall roof installed, new windows, a new door, the building re-painted and a radio aerial installed.

The harbour and surrounding area became an area heavily blighted by industrial waste even long after some of the industries were gone. There was a waste bing known by the locals as &#x27;The Blue Billy&#x27; due to the colour of the waste there. During World War II a Royal Observer Corps watchtower was sited here giving a wide overall view of the Firth of Clyde. It is also credited with the first visual sighting of Rudolf Hess&#x27;s Messerschmitt Bf 110 in 1941.

===Modern history===
Irvine was officially designated, in 1966, the fifth and last new town to be developed in Scotland and the only one to be located on the coast. The other Scottish &#x27;new towns&#x27; were East Kilbride, Glenrothes, Cumbernauld and Livingston. Unlike most new towns which were either completely newly built or based around small villages, Irvine was already a sizeable town which had been a Royal Burgh since 1372.

A quango, the Irvine Development Corporation (IDC), was set up in the 1960s to oversee the development of Irvine as Scotland&#x27;s fifth new town. The Corporation subsumed the planning powers of the Royal Burgh of Irvine Town Council, Kilwinning Town Council and the Irvine Landward District Council. This involved massive and sometimes controversial development of the old parts of the town.

The provisions of The New Town (Irvine) Winding Up Order 1993 officially ended the New Town Designation on 31 December 1996. This marked the end of the Irvine Development Corporation and the return of full planning control of the area back to the local authority.

The Irvine Bay Regeneration Company was set up in 2006, one of the second generation of Scottish URCs. Irvine is one of the five towns in the area, along with Ardrossan, Saltcoats, Stevenston and Kilwinning. Major development projects in the Irvine area include the redevelopment of Irvine Harbour, creating a residential area with the atmosphere of a Scottish village. 

Planning for a new golf course with a hotel and holiday resort is also well under way in the Marine Drive area, and the Riverside Business Park will be revitalised to attract new business into the area. The Bridgegate renovation project was completed in 2017.

==Governance==

Irvine was granted its first Burgh Charter around 1249. This entitled the town to organise its own affairs under a Town Council. In circa 1372 a dispute arose between Irvine and Ayr as to which of the two burghs had rights to control trade in the Barony of Cunninghame and Barony of Largs. The Burgesses of Irvine were able to produce Royal Charters showing that the town had the right to control trade in the Baronies of Cunninghame and Largs. The dispute was resolved by Robert II&#x27;s Royal Charter of 8 April 1372 conferring Royal Burgh status.

Originally Fullarton remained outwith the Royal Burgh of Irvine as a distinct village and latterly burgh in its own right in the Parish of Dundonald until the Irvine Burgh Act 1881 extended the town&#x27;s boundaries.

Irvine continued to administer itself with the usual Royal Burgh administrative arrangements of Provost, Bailies and Burgesses, who were based at Irvine Townhouse. Responsibility for public health, schools and strategic services such as roads passed to Ayr County Council in 1930 when the town was re-classified as a Small Burgh. On 16 May 1975 the Royal Burgh of Irvine Town Council was abolished and its functions were transferred to the now defunct Cunninghame District Council and Strathclyde Regional Council before being transferred from 1 April 1996 onwards to North Ayrshire Council. The bulk of the Royal Burgh records have been made available to the public in Irvine Townhouse.

There is a Community council in Irvine. However, unlike counterparts elsewhere in Scotland, it opts not to use &#x27;Royal Burgh of&#x27; in its title. The motto used on the coat of arms of the Royal Burgh is &#x27;Tandem Bona Causa Triumphat.&#x27; This means &quot;The Good Cause Triumphs in the end&quot;. The Westminster Constituency of Central Ayrshire is currently held by Scottish Labour. The Member of Parliament (MP) is Alan Gemmell. The Scottish Parliament Constituency of Cunninghame South is also held by the Scottish National Party. The Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) is Ruth Maguire.

==Geography and climate==

Irvine is situated in low lying Ayrshire overlooking Irvine Bay on the Firth of Clyde. It is a coastal town and lies approximately southwest of Glasgow. Most of the land in and around Irvine is very flat. Two rivers flow through the area, one being the River Irvine and the other being the Annick Water. The Annick Water is very popular for fishing. 

The area experiences relatively cool, wet summers and cold, wet winters, although snow in the area is not uncommon. Part of the reason why this part of Scotland is particularly mild is the influence from the sea air, with summer temperatures lower than their continental counterparts and only slightly warmer than their continental counterparts during the winter. Generally rainfall is plentiful throughout the year due to Atlantic weather systems sweeping in from the west. Snow is not rare in this part of Scotland and in many cases brings the area to a halt, like in 1995 and winter 2009/10.

Surrounding villages and hamlets around the vicinity of Irvine include Bourtreehill, Bourtreehill House, Lands of Broomlands, Cleeves Cove, Dreghorn, Drukken Steps, Eglinton Country Park, Girdle Toll, Irvine Harbour,Irvine New Town Trail, Laigh Milton Viaduct, Springside, Towerlands, The Chapel Well and Tanzie Well.

==Transport==
Irvine is well served with numerous transport links. A railway station, originally built by the Glasgow and South Western Railway Company, is situated at the west end of the town which is on the main line between Stranraer and Glasgow. The railway company responsible for local routes is ScotRail who operate Saltire liveried Diesel and Electric Multiple units of the former Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive. A comprehensive local bus network, coupled with frequent services to Ardrossan, Largs, Kilmarnock, Ayr, Troon and Glasgow, is provided by Stagecoach West Scotland.

There are two primary road crossings over the River Irvine, the more southerly of which has been criticised for some years. It is situated on the site of the former Irvine to Kilmarnock railway link which has long since been closed. The bridge over the river there has long been unsuitable for heavy traffic – being of a Bailey bridge design – which was constantly repaired over the years it existed. North Ayrshire Council announced plans to renew the bridge in a £2m investment which started in 2007, and was completed in 2010.

Irvine is also well served by several arterial roads, namely the A78 (Greenock to Prestwick), A71 (Irvine to Kilmarnock and beyond to Edinburgh), A737 (through the Garnock Valley to Glasgow via the M8) and the A736 to Glasgow.

==Culture==
As part of the Millennium celebrations, an exhibition known as &quot;The Big Idea&quot; opened in 2000. It was constructed on the north side of the River Irvine near the former Nobel quay. A footbridge from the harbour area was constructed, although it had to be able to open and close to still allow the small pleasure craft to pass. &quot;The Big Idea&quot; closed in 2003, due to low visitor numbers.

North Ayrshire&#x27;s theatre and arts centre was built here in 1966, and plays hosts to touring drama, live music and exhibitions. The hulk of the historic clipper ship, City of Adelaide, was moved to a dry dock near the inner harbour in 1992. There were various proposals for preserving the ship, and in March 2012 preparations were under way to move the ship to Adelaide, South Australia, for conservation and display. On 18 September 2013, the City of Adelaide started its final journey to Adelaide, South Australia.

Irvine is home to two football teams: Irvine Victoria and Irvine Meadow. The local rugby union team is Irvine RFC. The town used to have two greyhound racing tracks: the Townhead Greyhound Track, closed in 1967 and the Irvine Caledonian Stadium, closed in 1993. The horse racing Bogside Racecourse was closed in 1965.

The Irvine New Town Trail passes through a lot of the surrounding areas of Irvine; it forms part of the British National Cycle Network with routes 7 and 73 forming part of the route. The route forms a ring around the town and passes through Kilwinning, Bourtreehill, Girdle Toll and Dreghorn and passes through the town centre of Irvine.

As a farmer, Robert Burns grew flax, and during 1781 he took work as a flax-dresser in a heckling shop. He lodged in the adjacent vennel (or lane) which led towards Glasgow, used a bookshop in the town, and was encouraged by others to work towards publishing his poetry.
The Irvine Burns Club, originally formed in the Milne&#x27;s Inn (now The Crown Inn) is now based in Wellwood House, Eglinton Street, and has an unbroken history dating back to 2 June 1826. The club had twelve founding members of whom five were known to Robert Burns, and two were once his close friends. The original minute of the meeting reads &quot;The subscribers agree hereby to form, and do now form ourselves into a Committee for the purpose of establishing a Club, or Society for Commemorating the birth of Robert Burns the Ayrshire Poet – and we agree to meet at an early day to get the preliminaries of the Club properly arranged&quot;. Dr John Mackenzie, was the first club president. He had been a doctor in Mauchline, attended Burns&#x27; dying father at Lochlea in 1784 and married one of the &quot;Mauchline Belles&quot; before moving to Irvine in the capacity of personal physician to the Earl of Eglinton and his family. David Sillar, the first vice-president, had been a friend of Burns since his teenage years, was a member of the Tarbolton Bachelors Club, became a grocer, and finally an Irvine Council Bailie.

The Irvine Burns Club is one of the oldest continually existing Burns Clubs in the World and has an excellent collection of Burns artifacts, including the Kilmarnock Edition and Edinburgh editions of &quot;Poems chiefly in the Scottish dialect&quot;, by Robert Burns. The club has six of the original manuscripts which Burns sent to John Wilson, printer, Kilmarnock, for his famous Kilmarnock Edition, published on 31 July 1786, namely – &quot;The Twa Dogs&quot;, &quot;The Author&#x27;s Earnest Cry and Prayer&quot;, &quot;The Address to the Deil&quot;, &quot;Scotch Drink&quot; and &quot;The Cottar&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot;. The Irvine Burns Club has the oldest continuous record of any Burns club in the World.

<text>The Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW) was the upper tier of local government for London between 1856 and 1889, primarily responsible for upgrading infrastructure. It also had a parks and open spaces committee which set aside and opened up several landmark parks. The metropolis, which the board served, included substantial parts of Middlesex, Surrey, and Kent throughout the 33 years leading up to the advent of county councils. This urban zone lay around the medieval-sized City of London but plans to enact a similar body in 1837 failed. Parliament finally passed the Metropolis Management Act 1855 which dissolved a short-lived building office and a sewers commission and made the Board effective as of December that year. The board endured until it was succeeded by London County Council, as its directly elected, direct successor, in March 1889.

Its principal responsibility was to provide infrastructure to cope with the rapid growth of the metropolis, which it accomplished with varying degrees of success. The MBW was co-opted from boards, districts of vestries who were elected by their ratepayers rather than directly elected, but which during its period were separated into civil parishes removing many residual Church of England ties. It was accountable to Parliament but not to a particular ministry to supervise accounts. This democratic deficit vexed journal critics and rate-paying Londoners, especially having grown in budget and been seen as a reliable contract source when some of its members and staff engaged in embezzlement, bribery and breach of fiduciary duty (unfair contract procurement and mismanagement). However the national proliferation of such a tier of government on its demise recognised the advantages of economies of scale in uniting districts in procuring, improving and maintaining energy, street lighting, fire fighting, sanitation, and transport in the same way as large, well-funded, democratic, ministerially and accounting-regulated Municipal Corporations had widely done since 1835.

==Background==
The growth of the city around the commercial City of London was continuing apace; as the British Empire grew so the London Docks had grown in trade, population sharply grew and demand for housing rose as did the building of homes. Half of the population of the two of the three counties that adjoined that medieval-walled city definition were within a few miles of it. However the government of this metropolis was chaotic, with over 100 key authorities having statutory or customary powers and much overlapping territory. Specifically, providing a rate-paid service or capital improvement in a given place sometimes needed the co-ordination or consent of many of these.

In 1835 elected municipal boroughs had been set up covering every major city except London. The City of London, the very core of the sprawling metropolis which keeps its medieval boundaries, was untouched by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 and resisted all moves to expand its borders to include the generally poorer districts surrounding it. This meant that commissions (justices) of the peace of three counties, key landowners, and powerful parish council vestries beneath them, had authority over the clearly urban area, the metropolis: Middlesex north of the Thames and west of the Lea up to several miles from the City, Surrey to the south and south-west, and Kent as to the south east.

In 1837 an attempt was made to set up an elected authority covering the whole of the metropolis; however, the wealthier districts of Marylebone and Westminster resisted this, as some of their own local powers and low rates would have been lost. They defeated the motion. In 1854 the Royal Commission on the Corporation of the City of London proposed to divide an urban area around the City of London into seven boroughs, each represented on a Metropolitan Board of Works. This proposal was abandoned, but the next year the board of works was set up to cover all this.

==Creation==

To empower this body to coordinate work to plan and build infrastructure of the metropolis, Parliament passed the Metropolis Management Act 1855 which created the Metropolitan Board of Works (which took over the responsibilities of the short-lived Metropolitan Buildings Office and Metropolitan Commission of Sewers, established in 1845 and 1848 respectively). It covered &quot;the Metropolis&quot;, the area designated London in the 1851 census (an enlarged variant of the Bills of mortality area fixed in 1726), the alternative proposals had been the Metropolitan Police District; the coal tax area; or that used for the Metropolitan Interments Act 1852.

It was not to be a directly elected body, but instead to consist of members nominated by the vestries who were the principal local authorities. The larger vestries had two members and the City of London had three. A few vestries were for tiny parishes who co-convened into a district board for nominating members to the MBW. There were 45 members, who would then elect a Chairman who was to become a member &quot;ex officio&quot;. The first nominations took place in December and the Board held its first preliminary meeting on 22 December 1855 where John Thwaites was elected as chairman. The board formally came into being on 1 January 1856 when it took over the powers, duties and liabilities of the Commission of Sewers and the Buildings Office.

==Activities==

===Sewage===
A major problem was sewage: most of London&#x27;s waste was allowed to flow into the Thames resulting in a horrendous smell in the summer months. In 1855 and 1858 there were especially bad summers with the latter being known as &quot;The Great Stink&quot;. A notable achievement of the Board was the creation of the core London sewerage system, including 75 miles (120 km) of main and 1000 miles (1650 km) of street sewers, which solved the problem. A large part of the work of the MBW was under the charge of the Chief Engineer, Joseph Bazalgette, previously engineer with the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers.

===Streets and bridges===
Activities included slum clearance and making new streets to relieve traffic congestion. The most important streets built were Charing Cross Road, Garrick Street, Southwark Street and Northumberland and Shaftesbury Avenues. 

From 1869 the MBW bought all the private bridges across its section of the Tideway (Thames) and freed them of tolls. It also rebuilt Putney, Battersea, Waterloo and Hammersmith Bridges. 

;Commons-tabled plans for a bridge serving the role of Tower Bridge
The board wanted to build a new bridge east of London Bridge, discussed for many years. In 1878 Bazalgette drew up plans which were estimated at £1.25 million (). The Treasury refused to help by upping the coal and wine duties (most of the board&#x27;s income). The MBW advanced its plans, but saw its private bill which included negotiated payments and similar rejected by the House of Commons for lack of headroom for light shipping.

===Embankment===
The Board funded the tree-studded surface in the three sections of its contractor-designer Joseph Bazalgette&#x27;s Thames Embankment from 1864.

===Fire brigade===

From 1865 the MBW became responsible for administering the Metropolitan Fire Brigade. Architects employed by the MBW who specialised in fire stations included Robert Pearsall, responsible for Fulham Fire Station and Woolwich Fire Station.

===Parks and open spaces===

In 1856 the MBW obtained an amending act of parliament giving them the power to provide &quot;parks, pleasure-grounds and open spaces&quot;, subject to parliamentary approval. Among the parks and open spaces acquired or laid by the board were:
*Finsbury Park (acquired 1857, formally opened 1869)
*Southwark Park (acquired 1864, opened 1869)
*Victoria Embankment Gardens (opened in 1870)
*Leicester Square (opened in 1874)
*Wormwood Scrubs (vested in the MBW in 1879)
*Hampstead Heath (acquired in 1886)
*Battersea Park, Kennington Park, Victoria Park and the gardens surrounding Bethnal Green Museum (taken over from the Office of Works in 1887)
*Clapham Common (transferred to the board&#x27;s ownership in 1887)
*Wandsworth Common (duties of the conservators transferred to the board in 1887)
*Ravenscourt Park in 1888 and Clissold Park in 1889
*Dulwich Park laid out by the MBW but opened by the successor London County Council in 1890.

Under the Metropolitan Commons Act 1878 the MBW obtained the right to purchase and hold saleable rights in common lands in the Metropolis, in order to preserve the right of public access. The board also purchased the manorial rights in Streatham Common and Tooting Common.

==Organisation==

The MBW at first had its meetings in the Guildhall of the City of London and its headquarters at Greek Street in Soho. It then built its own headquarters at Spring Gardens (which became a metonym for the MBW), designed by its first chief architect Frederick Marrable and built in an Italianate style in 1859. When John Thwaites died (8 August 1870), he was eventually replaced by James Macnaghten Hogg, later Lord Magheramorne, who remained chairman until the MBW was abolished. There was an increase in the membership to 59 in 1885 when some district boards were divided and others were given more members.

==Scandals==
Few ratepayers and construction contractors thought MBW were transparently rewarded or that their property deals and tendering amounted to fair price and competition. Its status as a joint board insulated its members from any influence of popular opinion, though all property owners had to pay for its work as part of their local government rates. Worse, the very many building contracts issued by the MBW made membership of it desirable for anyone wishing to bid for them. The MBW took most of its decisions in secret. There were a succession of corruption scandals in the late 1880s, which led to a Royal Commission investigation. By this time, the MBW had the moniker the &quot;Metropolitan Board of Perks&quot;.

The knub of the scandal arose from the MBW&#x27;s purchase of the old Pavilion music hall in Piccadilly Circus in 1879, when the site was thought necessary for the construction of Shaftesbury Avenue. As the street was still in the early stage, the site was leased to music hall proprietor R.E. Villiers. In addition to this, Villiers paid a small &quot;&quot; amount to F.W. Goddard, who was Chief Valuer for the Board, for favourable treatment.

In 1883 Villiers met with Goddard and Thomas James Robertson (MBW Assistant Surveyor) to ensure that the remainder of the site was granted to him for a new Pavilion. They agreed to help him, in return for one corner becoming a public house under the landlordship of W.W. Grey who was the brother of Robertson, though this was not apparent.

In November 1884 Robertson told Villiers that the time had come to make a formal offer to the MBW to rent the new site. Villiers offered £2,700 ground rent per year. The Board instructed its superintending architect, George Vulliamy, to value the site: he was old and left practically all of the work to his subordinates – Goddard and Robertson (it was said by the Deputy Chairman of the Board that &quot;Mr. Goddard and Mr. Robertson were Mr. Vulliamy&quot;). They prepared a report valuing the ground rent at £3,000, which Villiers immediately accepted; this was then hurriedly pushed through the Board which agreed it despite a higher offer of £4,000. Ground rent was paid £2,650 for the largest part, and £350 for the corner. Goddard continued collecting secret sums from Villiers, and Grey took up the cheap corner plot – he sold his existing public house on Tichborn Street and divided the £10,000 profit between Goddard and Robertson. In December 1886, Villiers sold the Pavilion and gave £5,000 to Goddard.

===Subsidiary corruption===
For years, vague hints had been made that the Board tended to encourage those applying for leases to employ members of the Board as architects. In particular, James Ebenezer Saunders had been appointed as chief architect on the Pavilion, on the Grand Hotel and Metropole Hotel on Northumberland Avenue, on land owned by the Board did little design and oversight. Francis Hayman Fowler, although he had done much other work as a board member, had taken money from site owners and lessees in circumstances which clearly indicated bribery.

At lowest level, MBW&#x27;s Assistant Architect, John Hebb, had responsibility for inspecting theatres for safety. He began to write to the managers of theatres with upcoming inspections to suggest that they might want to send him free tickets. Given the power of the board to close theatres, most complied. However, displeased by the inspections themselves, and by the attempt to extract gifts, the managers tended to send Hebb tickets for seats that were at the back of the house or hidden behind a pillar.

===Royal Commission===
The Goddard-Robertson scandal was revealed by a series of articles in the &quot;Financial News&quot; beginning on 25 October 1886. The Board itself undertook an incompetent investigation under the Chairmanship of Magheramorne, which found Robertson was &quot;injudicious in allowing relatives to become tenants of the Board without informing the Board&quot; but could not find anything worthy &quot;of more severe censure&quot;. Anti-Board campaigners were not pleased and kept up the pressure. On the motion of Lord Randolph Churchill (who represented Paddington South where anti-Board feeling was at its highest), the House of Commons voted on 16 February 1888 to establish a Royal Commission to inquire into the Board.

The commission was headed by Lord Herschell and found the main allegations of the &quot;Financial News&quot; to have been correct, and indeed understated. Some other scandals were also discovered including the corruption of architects who were members of the Board. However, the Commission repudiated the view of critics that corruption was endemic in the Board.

While the Royal Commission was still preparing its hearings, the President of the Local Government Board Charles Ritchie announced that elected County Councils were to be created throughout the United Kingdom. Without much opposition the Bill had clauses that, on passage into an Act, divorced MBW&#x27;s ambit from the power-weak Quarter Sessions and other Courts of Surrey, Middlesex and Kent to turn it into a county with an elected London County Council. This matched the aims of anti-Board campaigners, principally the London Municipal Reform League.

==Abolition==
The Metropolitan Board of Works was abolished by the Local Government Act 1888; and the London County Council had been elected on 21 January 1889, to assume its new powers on 1 April. With the MBW a lame duck, its last weeks were its most inglorious period. The LCC were due to assume financial responsibility; and the MBW began to award large pensions to the retiring officers and large salaries to those who would transfer. The MBW then decided to allow the Samaritan Hospital in Marylebone to use an additional 12 feet of pavement, which the LCC opposed. The LCC wrote to the MBW asking it not to take the decision; the MBW did not reply and gave the permission.

Finally, the MBW received the tenders for the Blackwall Tunnel and decided to take a decision to award the contract at its final meeting. The LCC again wrote asking the MBW to leave the decision to them. The Chairman of the MBW replied (18 March 1889) that it intended to continue. At this the LCC decided to appeal to the government which exercised its power to abolish the MBW and bring the LCC into existence on 21 March 1889.

The magazine &quot;Punch&quot; printed a cartoon to mark the abolition of the MBW entitled &#x27;Peace to its Hashes&#x27;, representing the MBW by a black suit of armour (i.e. blackmail). The citation lauded the MBW for showing &#x27;how jobbery may be elevated to the level of the fine arts&#x27;.

The MBW&#x27;s headquarters by Admiralty Arch off The Mall were taken over by LCC until County Hall was complete in 1922. It was renamed &#x27;Old County Hall&#x27; and was a satellite office until the hundred-year lease expired in 1958. It became used for central government and was demolished in 1971, for a new headquarters for the British Council.

<doc id="349420" wikidata="Q894082" url="?curid=349420" title="Borough of Dartford">
<text>The Borough of Dartford is a local government district with borough status in the north-west of the county of Kent, England. It is named after its main town of Dartford, where the council is based. Other notable settlements include Greenhithe, Stone and Swanscombe, along with an emerging new town at Ebbsfleet, and a number of smaller villages. It also includes Bluewater, one of the UK&#x27;s largest shopping centres. The borough lies just outside the administrative boundary of Greater London, but a sizeable part of it lies within the M25 motorway which encircles London. Many of the borough&#x27;s urban areas form part of the Greater London Built-up Area. The borough had a population of 116,800 at the 2021 census.

The neighbouring districts (clockwise from east) are Gravesham, Sevenoaks, the London Borough of Bexley and, to the north across the River Thames, Thurrock, to which it is linked by the Dartford Crossing.

==History==
The first local authority for the town of Dartford was a body of improvement commissioners established in 1814 to maintain and light the streets and establish a watch. The commissioners were superseded in 1850 when the parish of Dartford was made a local board district, governed by an elected local board. Such districts were converted into urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. The Dartford Urban District was incorporated to become a municipal borough in 1933.

The modern district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of two former districts and five parishes from a third district. The three districts were all abolished at the same time:
*Dartford Municipal Borough
*Dartford Rural District (parishes of Darenth, Southfleet, Stone, Sutton-at-Hone and Wilmington only, rest went to Sevenoaks)
*Swanscombe Urban District (included Greenhithe)
The new district was named Dartford after its largest town. The new district was not initially made a borough, and the town of Dartford was therefore given charter trustees to preserve its right to appoint a ceremonial mayor. The new district was subsequently awarded borough status in April 1977, since when the chair of the council has taken the title of mayor instead.

The borough was enlarged in 1987 to take in the parish of Longfield from Sevenoaks District.

==Governance==
Dartford Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Kent County Council. Parts of the borough are covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government for their areas.

===Political control===
The council has been under Conservative majority control since 2007.

Political control of the council since the 1974 reforms has been as follows:

The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Dartford. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1974 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, a subsequent suspension of one councillor from the Labour Party and a by-election following the death of Residents Association Cllr Peter Harman, the composition of the council as of Nov 2024 is:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last full review of boundaries in 2019 the council has comprised 42 councillors representing 20 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

The Dartford constituency covers a similar but not identical area to the borough. The Member of Parliament (MP) since 2010 has been Gareth Johnson (Conservative).

===Premises===
The council is based at Dartford Civic Centre on Home Gardens in the centre of Dartford.

=== Dartford Youth Council ===
Dartford also has a youth council called the Dartford Youth Council (DYC) which comprises members of the youth representing local secondary schools, youth groups (such as Scouts). They discuss important issues relating to the youth of Dartford, such as mental health, to staying fit and how they can help and combat those issues. They attend a monthly meeting, at the Civic Centre. They have represented Dartford&#x27;s youth in several events. Every November, members attend and represent Dartford Youth Council in the annual Dartford Remembrance Parade.

==Transportation==

===Railways===

There are seven railway stations in the borough: at Stone; Greenhithe (for Bluewater); Swanscombe and Dartford, all on the North Kent Line; and Longfield and Farningham Road on the Victoria – Chatham Main Line. From Dartford there are three lines serving London and one to Gravesend, the Medway Towns and eastern Kent. For many services Dartford is the terminus.

Ebbsfleet International railway station on High Speed 1 opened in the east of the borough on 19 November 2007. Six high-speed services to Paris and five to Brussels ran daily from here by Eurostar. However since the Covid Pandemic trains destined for the Continent no longer stop in Kent at all. Despite efforts to reverse this decision, Eurostar have said they will only reconsider the situation sometime in 2025. The station still carries commuters to St Pancras station in London in only 17 minutes, and to Stratford International (next to the 2012 Summer Olympics site) in just 10 minutes, while eastbound commuter services link Ebbsfleet to Ashford International, Dover, Folkestone and other stations in Kent.

===Notable bus service===
The first of the Fastrack bus services, using a combination of ordinary roads and dedicated &#x27;bus tracks&#x27; commenced in March 2006. The service runs from the Temple Hill area of Dartford, through the town centre and on to Bluewater Shopping Centre, Greenhithe, Ebbsfleet International and Gravesend.

===Roads===

Three of the county&#x27;s main roads pass through the borough boundaries: the M25 and M20 motorways and the A2 dual carriageway. The A20, A225 and the A226 roads also cross the borough, among others.

Dartford gives its name to the Dartford Crossing of the River Thames, a pair of road tunnels (constructed in 1963 and 1980), with the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge (October 1991), dual-linking Kent with Essex and connecting sections of the London Orbital M25 motorway.

==Housing and architecture==

The layout of the district is clustered development in the northern half and buffered, dispersed settlement interspersed by the North Downs which is an escarpment of varied farms and woodland in the south.
*The M25 motorway bisects the district
*Swanscombe and Greenhithe have low rise homes and mid rise by the river Thames.

Housing is a mixture of relatively high rise in Dartford centre through to low rise in all of the villages.
The number of listed buildings in the district exceeds 50. This includes 7 churches listed in the highest grading in the national listing system (Grade I).

==Demography==

===2011 census===
The population rose in the 10 years to 2011 from 85,911 to 97,365, by 13.3%, which was above the national average.

87.3% of residents were born in England, which was 2.5% higher than the average for the South East. The next most common group of countries of birth was the non-EU, however this was 0.3% lower than the average for the South-East and 2% lower than the average for England.

As to residents of EU birth, only 3.3% of the population were such, slightly below the national average and two-thirds of this migration was from the accession countries from 2001 to 2011, a 12.5% higher proportion than that seen nationwide.

As to older people, the borough has a below national and regional proportion. In common with most of the country, an increase in people living in their area above the age of 74 took place, whether through change in preference or most commonly longevity, from 6.5% in 2001 to 7.1% in 2011.

With 80.8% of households with a car or van, this was 6.6% above the national average, however still marginally lower than South East&#x27;s record and national-high of 81.4%.

1.0% of the population lived in a communal establishment in the area.

As to homes, as 12.6% of properties in the area are detached, these form a smaller minority than the regional and national averages (at 28.0% and 22.3% of dwellings respectively).

Its people in 2011 were more economically active than the regional and national average; while self-employed inhabitants were at parity with the national average, those in full-time employment were 6.0% greater.

As to religion, statistics mirrored closely the national average, save that more Hindus and Sikhs live in the borough, at a combined, equally split 3.2% of the total population and fewer Muslims, also forming 1.6% of the population. Being almost at the mean for the country, Christians form just over 60% of the area&#x27;s population.

===2021 census===
==Employment==

Although many of area&#x27;s traditional industries of papermaking, cement, and pharmaceuticals are in decline or closing down, and many of borough&#x27;s inhabitants travel away from the borough by rail and road (many commuting to London and other areas for work), there is still a large industrial and commercial base. Included among those areas include &#x27;The Bridge&#x27; and Crossways to either side of the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, areas around Greenhithe and a site planned to contain five separate &#x27;villages&#x27; in the Eastern Quarry near Bluewater Shopping Centre, itself a large employer.

In 2012 plans were announced for the London Resort, envisaged as a major theme park to be built on the Swanscombe peninsula, which at the time was said to be able to create up to 27,000 jobs by 2018. As of 2023 no development had taken place.

==Towns and parishes==
There are eight civil parishes in the borough. The parish council for Swanscombe and Greenhithe has declared that parish to be a town, allowing it to take the name &quot;Swanscombe and Greenhithe Town Council&quot;. The main part of the Dartford urban area, roughly corresponding to the pre-1974 borough, is unparished, as is the Ebbsfleet area which was removed from the parish of Swanscombe and Greenhithe in 2019. Dartford, Greenhithe, Longfield and Swanscombe are all post towns.

<doc id="349423" wikidata="Q1018423" url="?curid=349423" title="Melton Mowbray">
<text>Melton Mowbray () is a market town in the Melton district in Leicestershire, England, north-east of Leicester and south-east of Nottingham. It lies on the River Eye, known below Melton as the Wreake. The town had a population of 27,670 in 2019. The town is sometimes promoted as Britain&#x27;s &quot;Rural Capital of Food&quot;; it is the home of the Melton Mowbray pork pie and is the location of one of six licensed makers of Stilton cheese.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name comes from the early English word &quot;Medeltone&quot; – meaning &#x27;Middletown surrounded by small hamlets&#x27; (as do Milton and Middleton). Mowbray is the Norman family name of early Lords of the Manor – namely Robert de Mowbray.

===Early history===
In and around Melton, there are 28 scheduled ancient monuments, some 705 buildings of special architectural or historical interest, 16 sites of special scientific interest, and several deserted village sites. Its industrial archaeology includes the Grantham Canal and remains of the Melton Mowbray Navigation. Windmill sites and signs of ironstone working and smelting suggest that the site was densely populated in the Bronze and Iron Ages. Many small communities existed and strategic points at Burrough Hill and Belvoir were fortified.

===Roman times===
In Roman times, Melton benefited from proximity to the Fosse Way and other major Roman roads, and to military centres at Leicester and Lincoln. Intermediate camps were established, for example, at Six Hills on the Fosse Way. Other Roman trackways passed north of Melton along the scarp of the Vale of Belvoir linking Market Harborough to Belvoir, and south to Oakham and Stamford.

===Danelaw===
Evidence of settlement in the Anglo-Saxon and 8th–9th-century Danelaw periods shows in place names. Along the Wreake Valley, the Danish suffix &quot;-by&quot; is common, e.g. in Asfordby, Dalby, Frisby, Hoby, Rearsby and Gaddesby. A cemetery of 50–60 graves of pagan Anglo-Saxon origin has been found in Melton Mowbray. Most villages and their churches had origins before the Norman Conquest of 1066, shown by stone crosses at Asfordby and Sproxton and Anglo-Saxon cemeteries at Goadby Marwood, Sysonby and Stapleford.

Melton Mowbray had six recorded crosses from several centuries: (i) Kettleby Cross near today&#x27;s filling station near the junction of Dalby Road and Leicester Road, (ii) Sheep Cross at Spital End, now Nottingham Street/Park Road junction, (iii) Corn Cross at Swine Lane/Spittle End junction, remade and re-erected at the Nottingham St/High St junction in 1996 as a memorial to the Royal Army Veterinary Corps, (iv) Butter Cross or High Cross at the west end of Beast Market, again rebuilt from remains of an original Anglo-Saxon cross in 1986–1987 in the Market Place, (v) Sage Cross at the East end of the Beast Market close to Saltgate, in Sherrard Street opposite Sage Cross Street, and (vi) Thorpe Cross at the end of Saltgate, near the junction of Thorpe Road and Saxby Road. The original crosses were removed or destroyed during the Reformation and other iconoclastic periods, or to make room for traffic or other development.

===Post-conquest===

The effects of the Norman Conquest recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book show that settlements at Long Clawson and Bottesford were of noteworthy size, and that Melton Mowbray a thriving market town of some 200 inhabitants, with weekly markets, two water mills and two priests. The mills, still in use up to the 18th century, are remembered in the names of Beckmill Court and Mill Street.

Melton has thus been a market town for over 1,000 years. Recorded as Leicestershire&#x27;s only market in the 1086 Domesday Survey, it is the third oldest market in England. Tuesday has been market day since royal approval was given in 1324. The market was founded with tolls before 1077.

Legacies from the Middle Ages include consolidation of village and market-town patterns – in Melton Mowbray, Bottesford, Wymondham and Waltham-on-the-Wolds. The last had a mediaeval market which survived until 1921, and an annual fair of horses and cattle. Many buildings in Melton Market Place, Nottingham Street, Church Lane, King Street and Sherrard Street have ancient foundations. Alterations to No. 16 Church Street revealed a medieval circular stone wall subjected to considerable heat. This is probably the Manor Oven mentioned in 13th-century documents. Surveys of 5 King Street show it belonged to an early medieval open-halled house. It may have been part of the 14th-century castle or fortified manor of the Mowbrays.

King Richard I and King John visited the town and may have stayed at an earlier castle. In 1549, after the Dissolution of chantries, monasteries and religious guilds, church plate was sold and land bought for the town. Resulting rents were used to maintain Melton School, first recorded in 1347, making it one of the oldest in Britain. Funds were also used to maintain roads and bridges and repair the church clock.

===Civil War===
During the English Civil War, Melton was a Roundhead garrison commanded by a Colonel Rossiter. Two battles were fought: in November 1643, Royalists caught the garrison unaware and carried away prisoners and booty; in February 1645, Sir Marmaduke Langdale, commanding a Royalist force of 1,500 men, inflicted severe losses on the Roundheads. Some 300 men were said to have been killed. Legend has it that the hillside where the battle was fought was ankle deep in blood, hence the name Ankle Hill. However, the name appears in documents from before the Civil War and the names of Dalby Road and Ankle Hill have been switched, so confusing the true site of the battle.

Local notable families seem to have had divided loyalties, though the Civil War ended with rejoicings outside the Limes in Sherrard Street, home of Sir Henry Hudson. His father, Robert Hudson, founded the Maison Dieu almshouses opposite the Church in 1640, complementing the stone Anne of Cleves House opposite. This was built in 1384 and housed chantry priests until the Dissolution. It was then included in the estates of Anne of Cleves by Henry VIII, as a divorce settlement in the 16th century, although there is debate about whether she ever stayed there. A Grade II* listed building, it is now a public house owned by Everards, a Leicester brewery.

===Modern period===
On 6 April 1837, the 3rd Marquess of Waterford and a hunting party went on a spree through Melton streets causing much damage, according to the &quot;London Examiner&quot;. Henry Alken&#x27;s pictures &quot;A Spree at Melton Mowbray&quot; and &quot;Larking at the Grantham Tollgate&quot; are said to illustrate this. They featured also in a play, &quot;The Meltonians&quot;, at The Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1838. The Corn Exchange in Nottingham Street was completed in 1854.

In 1942–1964, RAF Melton Mowbray lay to the south towards Great Dalby. The Class A airfield had been intended for aircraft maintenance, but was taken over by RAF Transport Command. In 1946–1958, it was used as a displaced persons camp by the Polish Resettlement Corps. Melton Mowbray served as a Thor strategic missile site in 1958–1963, when 254(SM) Squadron operated a flight of three nuclear missiles from the base.

==Produce==

Stilton cheese originated as a commercial venture developed to manufacture cheese for sale at the village of Stilton in Cambridgeshire, which has led to claims that the cheese itself originated outside that village. Historical evidence suggests an evolution of the cheese over many years, with some sourced from Melton Mowbray or surroundings. Stilton is still made in the town at the Tuxford &amp; Tebbutt creamery, one of only six dairies licensed to do so. Makers in Cambridgeshire cannot call their cheese Stilton, even if it is made there. The earliest reference cited is Daniel Defoe, who in 1724 called the cheese he ate at Stilton &quot;the English Parmesan&quot;. Growth of business from travellers on the Great North Road and from sales to London led to a need to source more cheese from further afield, including the Melton region, and over time the modern blue cheese developed.
Melton Mowbray pork pies are made by a specific &quot;hand-raising&quot; process and recipe. On 4 April 2008 the European Union awarded the Melton Mowbray pork pie Protected Geographical Indication status, after a long-standing application made by the Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association. Only pies made in a designated zone round Melton using uncured pork may bear the Melton Mowbray name. The pork was originally a by-product of cheese making as the whey was fed to pigs.
Melton Mowbray is home to Melton cloth, a tightly woven fabric first mentioned in 1823, heavily milled with a nap raised to a short, dense non-lustrous pile. Sailors&#x27; pea coats are traditionally made of it, as are the commonly worn workmen&#x27;s donkey jackets of Britain and Ireland, and loggers&#x27; &quot;cruising jackets&quot; and Mackinaws in North America.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Melton Mowbray, at district and county level: Melton Borough Council and Leicestershire County Council. The borough council has its offices at Parkside on Burton Street, adjoining Melton Mowbray railway station. The building was purpose-built for the council and opened in 2011.

Six of the 16 wards from which borough councillors are elected are named for the town: Melton Craven, Melton Dorian, Melton Egerton, Melton Newport, Melton Sysonby, and Melton Warwick.

===Administrative history===

Melton Mowbray was an ancient parish. The parish was made a local government district in 1860, governed by a local board. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts in 1894. In 1929 the Melton Mowbray Urban District Council bought Egerton Lodge to serve as its offices and meeting place. Melton Mowbray Urban District was abolished in 1974, merging with the surrounding Melton and Belvoir Rural District to become the borough of Melton. No successor parish was created for the former urban district.

When created in 1974 Melton BC inherited offices at Egerton Lodge from Melton Mowbray Urban District Council and at Warwick Lodge on Dalby Road from Melton and Belvoir Rural District Council. In 1986 the council moved to a new building on Nottingham Road. The Nottingham Road building largely burnt down on 30 May 2008. The northern wing of the building was repaired and is now called Phoenix House, but the rest of the building was beyond repair and was demolished. The council chose to build new headquarters at Parkside, spending £5.6m on the new building.

===Town Estate===
Melton Mowbray contains a rare example of early town government. The Melton Mowbray Town Estate was founded in 1549, during the Reformation, when two townsfolk sold silver and plate sequestered from the church and bought land to be held in trust for all inhabitants. It provided early forms of education and the first street lighting, and still owns and keeps the town&#x27;s parks, sports grounds and market. From its inception, the running of the Town Estate was undertaken by Town Wardens.

In 1989, a new Scheme of Arrangement drawn up by the Charity Commission after public consultation transferred management to a body of 14 Feoffees, two of whom are known as Senior and Junior Town Warden. Nowadays the Town Warden position is titular, as the public face of the Town Estate on civic or ceremonial occasions.

===Constituency===
Melton Mowbray was a part of the Rutland and Melton seat until the dissolution of Parliament for the 2024 general election, at which Melton Borough became the largest component of the new Melton and Syston constituency.

===Demography===
Melton Mowbray&#x27;s 1,766 inhabitants in 1801 rose by 1831 to 3,327, by 1841 to 3,740, by 1851 to 4,434, and by 1861 to 4,436. Melton Mowbray&#x27;s official web site listed the 2009 population of the town as 25,276 and that of Melton Borough as 46,861.

==Economy==
Before 1960, the Production Engineering Research Association of Great Britain came to Nottingham Road and employed about 400 people in supporting research and development in industry. It is also houses the East Midlands Manufacturing Advisory Service. The former East Midlands Regional Assembly was also based in Nottingham Road.

Petfoods arrived in 1951 as Chappie Ltd, employing at its peak over 2,000. It still employs about 1,000. The firm changed its name to Petfoods in 1957, to Pedigree Petfoods in 1972, and to Masterfoods in January 2002. At Melton, it makes four million items of pet food a day, though this is less than earlier. Masterfoods now has its UK headquarters close to Melton at Waltham-on-the-Wolds.

==Landmarks==

St Mary&#x27;s Church dates mainly from the 13th–15th centuries. It has been described as &quot;one of the finest parish churches in Leicestershire&quot;.

Egerton Lodge is a Grade II listed building built in 1829 for Lord Wilton, as a hunting box. It served as the offices of Melton Mowbray Urban District Council from 1929 until its abolition in 1974, and was later a care home until 2023. Its gardens are laid out as a war memorial.

==Entertainment and facilities==
The Melton Carnegie Museum was refurbished in 2010 to cover the history of the town. Included are sounds from the ages, a history of the hunt, a preserved phone box, a buried Anglo-Saxon, and shrapnel from the Second World War.

The Melton Band, a traditional British-style brass band, can trace its directors back to 1856, and was until recently called Melton Borough Band. The colourful Melton Mowbray Toy Soldiers Marching Band was formed in 1936. Happy Jazz – a Dixieland jazz band – had its headquarters in the town in 1996–2014. The Melton Mowbray Tally Ho Band formed in 1936 and the mixed brass and woodwind Tornado Brass in the 1980s.

Some of Melton&#x27;s many pubs, such as the &quot;Generous Britain&quot; or &quot;Jenny B&quot;, continue to encourage live music. The &quot;Noels Arms&quot; free house was Melton Mowbray District CAMRA Pub of the Year in 2014 and was also briefly home to Gasdog Brewery. One of Melton&#x27;s oldest surviving pubs, with features from the early 14th century, is the &quot;Anne of Cleves&quot; in Burton Street, close to St Mary&#x27;s Church; once home to chantry monks, the building was passed after the Dissolution to Anne of Cleves as part of her divorce settlement.

The town cinema, The Regal in King Street, occupies a purpose-built theatre complete with period interior design, sumptuous colours, winding staircases and fancy plasterwork. It re-opened in 2013 after refurbishment.

Concerts have been held at the Carousel Bandstand in Melton Mowbray Park since August 1909. They take place on summer Sundays.

Melton&#x27;s radio station, 103 FM The Eye, broadcasts to Melton Borough and the Vale of Belvoir and parts of Rushcliffe Borough. It can also be heard on the internet. When launched in 2005, it was the first in the UK to go on the air under the new tier of community radio, licensed by the broadcasting regulator OFCOM. The station has since won awards for its work. It is named after the local river, the Eye.

The Stapleford Miniature Railway, built in 1958, is a private, steam-hauled passenger railway at Stapleford Park about to the east of Melton Mowbray. Famous for a fleet of steam locos and its scenic location, it attracts visitors and tourists for two public charity events each year. It has the same gauge as the Town Estates railway around Play Close Park in Melton.

Also to the north-east of Melton is the Twinlakes Theme Park, with a range of family attractions and rides. The Waterfield Leisure Pools include a gym and fitness suite, as well as swimming.

The library in Wilton Road is close to the town centre. Adjacent is Melton Theatre, part of Brooksby Melton College, on the junction with Asfordby Road. The theatre, first opened in 1976, was recently refurbished. In the past few years, it has produced ballet, opera and stage plays and provided a venue for bands and acts, pantomime and art shows.

Melton has a fire station, a police station, and a hospital that includes St Mary&#x27;s Maternity Centre. The War Memorial Hospital off Ankle Hill, originally Wyndham Lodge, was donated to the town in 1920 by Colonel Richard Dalgliesh. It was sold in 2010 to help fund St Mary&#x27;s Hospital. Melton Country Park provides green space.

==Education==

The town&#x27;s secondary schools are Long Field Academy and John Ferneley College for pupils aged 11–16 and the Melton Vale Post 16 Centre (MV16) for sixth-formers. Its primary schools are Brownlow, Grove, St Francis RC, St Mary&#x27;s C of E, Sherard and Swallowdale. Birchwood Special School caters for pupils of primary and secondary-school age. Melton&#x27;s largest school was the King Edward VII, which at one time had some 2,000 pupils aged 11–19. It was founded as a grammar school in 1910, became comprehensive in the late 1960s, and closed after reaching its centenary. Brooksby Melton College provides vocational, further and higher education in a wide range of subjects at a campus in Asfordby Road and at its Brooksby campus out of town.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the nearby Waltham TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Leicester on 104.9 FM, Smooth East Midlands on 106.6 FM, Capital Midlands on 96.2 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Midlands on 106.0 FM, and The Eye, a community-based radio station which broadcast from the town on 103 FM.

The &quot;Melton Times&quot; is the town&#x27;s weekly newspaper.

==Transport==
===Road===
Two main roads intersecting at Melton Mowbray are the A606 between Nottingham and Oakham and the A607 between Leicester and Grantham. Other roads include the A6006 from Asfordby, the second section of the B676 road to Colsterworth, and the B6047 road to Market Harborough, which starts in Melton.

A bypass relief road, the North &amp; East Melton Mowbray Distributor Road, connecting the A606 and A607 with the aim of alleviating congestion in the town centre, began construction in spring 2023 and is expected to be completed by summer 2025.

===Rail===
Melton Mowbray railway station, on the Birmingham to Stansted Airport line, also serves Leicester, Peterborough and Cambridge. Trains run hourly. The station offers peak-hour trains to and from Nottingham, Norwich and Sleaford. It is managed by East Midlands Railway, but most services are run by CrossCountry, which intends to enhance its service gradually to half-hourly on this route. Since early 2009, East Midlands Trains has offered a single daily journey from Melton Mowbray to London St Pancras and return. This is notable for being the first regular passenger service to cross the historic Welland Viaduct since 1966. In 2010, the company introduced a single daily return journey to Derby.

===Buses===
Arriva Midlands provide frequent buses to Leicester on service 5A. Centrebus are the main operator of bus services around the town, with some longer-distance routes operating to Syston, Grantham, Loughborough, and Oakham. The service to Nottingham was withdrawn in April 2022.

==Sports==
Greyhound racing was held at a stadium on the north side of Saxby Road in 1946–1969. Motorcycle speedway racing was held at the Greyhound Stadium in 1949–1950. The cinder track was laid before and lifted after each meeting. The events, staged on a Sunday, were opposed by the Lord&#x27;s Day Observance Society for a short time. The stadium was also the venue for a few meetings in 1950 when the Melton Lions faced select teams.

<doc id="349427" wikidata="Q764425" url="?curid=349427" title="Oadby and Wigston">
<text>Oadby and Wigston is a local government district with borough status in Leicestershire, England. It covers the two towns of Oadby, where the council is based, and Wigston, which is the larger town. Both form part of the Leicester urban area, lying south-east of the city.

The neighbouring districts are Leicester, Harborough and Blaby.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of two former districts, which were both abolished at the same time:
*Oadby Urban District
*Wigston Urban District

The new district was named Oadby and Wigston, combining the towns&#x27; names. The new district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==
Oadby and Wigston Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Leicestershire County Council. There are no civil parishes in the borough, which is an unparished area.

===Political control===
The council has been under Liberal Democrat majority control since 1991.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Oadby and Wigston. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2006 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and a change of allegiance in March 2024, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===
Since the last boundary changes in 2003 the council has comprised 26 councillors representing 10 wards, with each ward electing two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

The wards are:

*Oadby Brocks Hill (2)
*Oadby Grange (3)
*Oadby St Peter&#x27;s (2)
*Oadby Uplands (2)
*Oadby Woodlands (2)
*South Wigston (3)
*Wigston All Saints (3)
*Wigston Fields (3)
*Wigston Meadowscroft (3)
*Wigston St Walstan&#x27;s (3)
The district forms part of the Harborough, Oadby and Wigston parliamentary constituency.

===Premises===
The council meets at the Brocks Hill Council Offices in Brocks Hill Park on Washbrook Lane in Oadby.
Until 2023 the council was based at Bushloe House on Station Road in Wigston, which had been built as a house and had been bought in 1942 by the old Wigston Urban District Council and converted to become its headquarters. In 2023 the council moved its meetings and offices to the Brocks Hill offices in Oadby.

==Geography==
It is composed of the areas of Oadby, Wigston, South Wigston and the hamlet of Kilby Bridge. It is predominantly urban, and borders Leicester directly to the north-west. There are no civil parishes in the district.

The most northerly corner is near the junction of the A6030 and B582, and near the Bupa hospital it meets Harborough. It runs along the B582 then along the former Roman road (which runs to Corby), passing the playing fields of the University of Leicester. It passes along the north edge of Oadby Lodge, a farm owned by the Co-op. Towards the deserted village of Stretton Magna (outside the district), the boundary passes southwestwards. This area was proposed to be the site of the eco-town Pennbury. It crosses the A6 at Glen Gorse Golf Club. It crosses &quot;Newton Lane&quot; and the Midland Main Line. It crosses the Grand Union Canal, and towards Kilby it meets the district of Blaby at the River Sence. It follows the River Sence, crossing the A5199 (&quot;Welford Road&quot;). At Rose Farm it follows &quot;Countesthorpe Road&quot; towards South Wigston, to the Grand Union Canal, crossing the former Midland Counties Railway, which it follows westwards. It passes northwards across &quot;St Thomas Road&quot; (B582) and the Birmingham to Peterborough Line. It passes northwards on the east side of the Glen Parva prison (in Blaby district). It meets Leicester UA south of Eyres Monsell, a large housing estate.

Following the Leicester boundary, it crosses &quot;Saffron Road&quot; (B5366), then follows &quot;Dorset Avenue&quot;, follows the Midland Main Line northwards, crossing &quot;Aylestone Lane&quot; (B5418), then crosses the Midland Main Line. It crosses the &quot;Welford Road&quot; (A5199) at the point where the road becomes a dual-carriageway south of the Best Western &quot;Leicester Stage Hotel&quot; (in Leicester UA). It passes on the south edge of Knighton Park, and the western edge of Oadby Golf Club, west of Leicester Racecourse (in the district). Near the racecourse entrance it crosses the A563 southern ring road, then &quot;London Road&quot; (A6), passing northwards along the western edge of the University of Leicester&#x27;s Oadby Student Village, west of the University of Leicester Botanic Garden (in the district).

==Demography==
==Education==
Both Beauchamp College, in the south of Oadby, and Wigston College, on the B582 in Wigston, are former grammar schools. Both were upper schools, as the three tier system operated in the district&#x27;s schools. Also near the council offices on the B582 is South Leicestershire College, an FE college. Next to the Beauchamp College is Gartree High School, a former middle school. Another school is Manor High School, Oadby, which was the largest middle school in the country.

<doc id="349428" wikidata="Q745295" url="?curid=349428" title="Mani Peninsula">
<text>The Mani Peninsula (), also long known by its medieval name Maina or Maïna (), is a geographical and cultural region in the Peloponnese of Southern Greece and home to the Maniots (), who claim descent from the ancient Spartans. The capital city of Mani is Areopoli. Mani is the central of three peninsulas which extend southwards from the Peloponnese. To the east is the Laconian Gulf, to the west the Messenian Gulf. The Mani peninsula forms a continuation of the Taygetos mountain range, the western spine of the Peloponnese.

==Etymology==

There are many theories regarding the etymology of the word Mani. The most accepted one is that it represents the natural evolution of the medieval name of the region, which was Maini, of uncertain origin. The name &quot;Mani&quot; may come from the name of the Frankish castle &quot;le Grand Magne&quot;.

==Geography==
The terrain is mountainous and inaccessible.

Until recent years many Mani villages could be reached only by sea. Today a narrow and winding road extends along the west coast from Kalamata to Areopoli, then south to Akrotainaro (the pointed cape, which is the southernmost point of continental Greece) before it turns north toward Gytheio. Another road, that is used by the public buses of the Piraeus–Mani line, which has existed for several decades, comes from Tripoli through Sparta, Gytheio, Areopoli and ends in the Gerolimenas port near Cape Matapan.
Mani has been traditionally divided into three regions:

*&quot;Exo Mani&quot; (Έξω Μάνη) or Outer Mani to the northwest,
*&quot;Kato Mani&quot; (Κάτω Μάνη) or Lower Mani to the east,
*&quot;Mesa Mani&quot; (Μέσα Μάνη) or Inner Mani to the southwest.
A fourth region named Vardounia (Βαρδούνια) to the north is also sometimes included but was never historically part of Mani. Vardounia served as a buffer between the Ottoman-Turkish controlled Evrotas plains and Mani. A contingent of Muslim Albanian settlers were relocated to the region by the Ottomans. These settlers formed a large segment of the local population until the Greek War of Independence when they fled to the Turkish stronghold at Tripoli. Following the war Vardounia&#x27;s Greek population was reinforced by settlers from Lower Mani and central Laconia.

Administratively, Mani is now divided between the prefectures of Laconia (Kato Mani, Mesa Mani) and Messenia (Exo Mani), in the periphery of Peloponnesos, but in ancient times it lay entirely within Laconia, the district dominated by Sparta. The Messenian Mani (also called &quot;aposkiaderi&quot;, a local expression meaning &quot;shady&quot;) receives somewhat more rainfall than the Laconian (called &quot;prosiliaki&quot;, a local expression meaning &quot;sunny&quot;), and is consequently more productive in agriculture. Maniots from what is now Messenian Mani have surnames that uniformly end in &quot;-éas&quot;, whereas Maniots from what is now Laconian Mani have surnames that end in &quot;-ákos&quot;; additionally there is the &quot;-óggonas&quot; ending, a corruption of &quot;éggonos&quot;, &quot;grandson&quot;.

==History==

A skull of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; dating to more than 210,000 years ago was found in the Apidima Cave on the western side of the peninsula. this was the oldest evidence of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; in Europe.

Neolithic remains have been found in many caves along the Mani coasts, including the Alepotrypa Cave. Homer refers to a number of towns in the Mani region, and some artifacts from the Mycenaean period (1900–1100 BC) have been found. The area was occupied by the Dorians in about 1200 BC, and became a dependency of Sparta. After Spartan power was destroyed in the 3rd century BC, Mani remained self-governing.

As the power of the Byzantine Empire declined, the peninsula drifted out of the Empire&#x27;s control. The fortress of Maini in the south became the area&#x27;s centre. Over the subsequent centuries, the peninsula was fought over by the Byzantines, the Franks, and the Saracens.

After the Fourth Crusade in 1204 AD, Italian and French knights (known collectively by the Greeks as Franks) occupied the Peloponnese and created the Principality of Achaea. They built the fortresses of Mystras, Passavas, Leuktron (Beaufort), and Great Maina. The area fell under Byzantine rule after 1262, forming part of the Despotate of the Morea.

In 1460, after the fall of Constantinople, the Despotate fell to the Ottomans. According to local tradition, some members of noble Byzantine families—such as the Palaiologoi—fled to Mani. Mani was not subdued and retained its internal self-government in exchange for an annual tribute, although this was only paid once. Local chieftains or &quot;beys&quot; governed Mani on behalf of the Ottomans.

The first of these was Limberakis Gerakaris in the 17th century. A former oarsman in the Venetian fleet turned pirate, he was captured by the Ottomans and condemned to death. The Grand Vizier pardoned him, on condition that he took over control of Mani as an Ottoman agent. Gerakaris accepted, using the opportunity to carry out his feud with the strong Maniot family of the Stephanopouloi: he besieged their seat at Oitylo, captured 35 of them, and had them executed. During his twenty-year reign, he shifted allegiance between the Venetians and the Turks.

Following the failure of the Orlov Revolt, in 1776 Mani&#x27;s autonomous status was recognized by the Porte, and for the next 45 years until the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821, eight rulers (&quot;beys&quot;) reigned over the peninsula on behalf of the Porte: 
* (1776–1779)
* Michalbey Troupakis, known as Mourtzinos (1779–1782)
* Tzanetos Kapetanakis Grigorakis or Tzanetbey (1782–1798)
* Panagiotis Koumoundouros (1798–1803)
* Antonbey Grigorakis (1803–1808)
* Konstantinos Zervakos or Zervobey (1808–1810)
* Theodorobey Tzanetakis (1811–1815)
* Petrobey Mavromichalis (1815–1821)

As Ottoman power declined, the mountains of the Mani became a stronghold of the &quot;klephts&quot;, bandits who also fought against the Ottomans. There is also evidence of a sizeable Maniot emigration to Corsica sometime during the Ottoman years. Petros Mavromichalis, the last &quot;bey&quot; of Mani, was among the leaders of the Greek War of Independence. He proclaimed the revolution at Areopoli on March 17, 1821. The Maniots contributed greatly to the struggle, but once Greek independence was won, they wanted to retain local autonomy. During the reign of Ioannis Kapodistrias, they violently resisted outside interference, to the extent of Mavromichalis&#x27; sons killing Kapodistrias.

In 1878 the national government reduced the local autonomy of the Mani, and the area gradually became a backwater; inhabitants abandoned the land through emigration, with many going to major Greek cities, as well as to western Europe and the United States. It was not until the 1970s, when the construction of new roads supported the growth of the tourist industry, that the Mani began to regain population and become prosperous.

== Economy ==

Despite the region&#x27;s aridity, Mani is known for its unique culinary products such as &quot;glina&quot; or &quot;syglino&quot; (pork or pork sausage smoked with aromatic herbs such as thyme, oregano, mint, etc. and stored in lard along with orange peel). Mani is also known for honey and extra-virgin olive oil, soft-pressed from partially ripened olives of the &quot;Koroneiki&quot; variety, which are grown on mountain terraces. 

Today the Mani&#x27;s coastal villages are full of cafés and souvenir shops. The peninsula attracts visitors for its Byzantine churches, Frankish castles, sandy beaches and scenery. Some popular beaches during the summer are Kalogria and the beaches by Stoupa harbor, while Kardamyli and Agios Nikolaos have good pebble and sand beaches, too. The ancient tower houses of Mani (&quot;pyrgospita&quot;) are significant tourist attractions, and some offer accommodations for visitors. The Vlychada Caves at Pirgos Dirou, near Oitylo, are also a popular tourist destination. As they are partly underwater, visitors tour them in &quot;gondola&quot;-like boats.

Gytheio, Areopoli, Kardamyli, and Stoupa are filled with tourists during the summer months, but the region is generally quiet during the winter. Many inhabitants work as olive farmers, and devote the winter months to the olive harvest and processing. Some of the villages in the mountains are less tourist oriented and often have very few inhabitants.

==Religion==
The introduction of Christianity came late in the Mani: the first Greek temples began to be converted into Christian churches during the 11th century AD. A Byzantine Greek monk called Nikon &quot;the Metanoite&quot; () was commissioned by the Church in the 10th century to spread Christianity to areas such as Mani and Tsakonia, which had remained pagan.

St. Nikon was sent to the Mani in the latter half of the 10th century to preach Christianity to the Maniots. Although the Maniots began to convert to Christianity century due to Nikon&#x27;s preaching, it took more than 200 years, i.e. until the 11th and 12th centuries to eliminate most of the pagan Greek religion and traditions and for the Maniots to fully accept Christianity. After his sanctification by the Greek Orthodox Church, St. Nikon became patron saint of the Mani as well as Sparta.

<doc id="349432" wikidata="Q1853930" url="?curid=349432" title="North West Leicestershire">
<text>North West Leicestershire is a local government district in Leicestershire, England. The towns in the district include of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Castle Donington, Coalville (where the council is based) and Ibstock. Notable villages in the district include Donington le Heath, Ellistown, Hugglescote, Kegworth, Measham, Shackerstone, Thringstone and Whitwick.

Castle Donington is notable as the location of Donington Park, a grand-prix circuit and a major venue for music festivals. The area has a long history of mineral extraction, with coal, brick clay, gravel and granite amongst the products. All the deep coal mines in the area have closed, but opencast mining still continues. The district is also home to part of the Battlefield Line and the Ibstock Brick.

The neighbouring districts are Charnwood, Hinckley and Bosworth, North Warwickshire, Lichfield, South Derbyshire, Erewash and Rushcliffe.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of five former districts plus a single parish from a sixth, which districts were all abolished at the same time:
*Ashby-de-la-Zouch Urban District
*Ashby de la Zouch Rural District
*Ashby Woulds Urban District
*Castle Donington Rural District
*Coalville Urban District
*Market Bosworth Rural District (Ibstock parish only, rest went to Hinckley and Bosworth)
*Melton and Belvoir Rural District

The new district was named North West Leicestershire, reflecting its position in the wider county.

==Governance==
North West Leicestershire District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Leicestershire County Council. Much of the district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being run by an alliance of the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and two of the independent councillors, led by Conservative councillor Richard Blunt.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Since 1974 political control of the council has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2003 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election the composition of the council was:

The Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and two of the independent councillors sit together as the &quot;Alliance Group&quot; which forms the council&#x27;s administration. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2015 the district has comprised 38 wards, each of which elects one councillor. Elections are held every four years.

The district is coterminous with the North West Leicestershire parliamentary constituency.

===Premises===
The council meets at Stenson House on London Road in Coalville. The building was built in 1934 as the headquarters of the old Coalville Urban District Council. Following the creation of North West Leicestershire in 1974 the building was significantly extended to the rear. In 2022 the extension was closed pending demolition, and the council opened a new customer services centre on Belvoir Road, retaining and refurbishing the 1934 front part of Stenson House to be used for meetings and civic functions.

==Demography==

North West Leicestershire has experienced steady population growth in recent times as the district balances the agro-rural economy with the end of labour-intensive deep coal-mining. Alternative employment opportunities exist within the district in the services and distributive sectors, together with local or nearby manufacturing and extractive/transformative/construction industries. The lack of rail services to/from Leicester, Loughborough and other nearby centres limits access for employment, commerce and leisure to a road journey that competes with freight and heavy-haulage vehicles especially to the south and east.

== Economy ==

Since 2013 Norton Motorcycles has its head office in Donington Hall, Castle Donington. BMI (British Midland), an airline, was headquartered in Donington Hall. The airline moved its headquarters to Donington Hall in 1982. The subsidiary bmibaby also had its head office in Donington Hall.

Prior to its disestablishment, Excalibur Airways had its head office on the grounds of East Midlands Airport in Castle Donington. Prior to its disestablishment, Orion Airways had its head office on the grounds of East Midlands Airport.

In 2011 Coalfield Resources plc were given permission to develop an opencast coal mining pit on the site of the former Minorca colliery between Measham and Swepstone on a seam which will be across and extract 1,250,000 tonnes (1,380,000 tons) of coal over five years, and 250,000 tonnes (280,000 tons) of clay.

==Media==
In terms of television, the area receive better TV signals from the Sutton Coldfield TV transmitter which broadcast BBC West Midlands and ITV Central (West) from Birmingham. Some eastern parts of the district are still able to receive the Waltham TV transmitter to get BBC East Midlands and ITV Central (East) from Nottingham.

Radio stations for the area are:
*BBC Radio Leicester
*BBC Radio Derby can also be received
*Capital Midlands
*Smooth East Midlands
*Greatest Hits Radio Midlands
*Community based stations are Hermitage FM, Fosse FM and Carillon Radio.

==Parishes==
Most of the district is covered by civil parishes. Parts of the former Coalville Urban District covering the main part of Coalville and the Thringstone area are unparished areas. The parish councils for Ashby-de-la-Zouch and Ashby Woulds have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. (Whilst Ibstock is a post town and Castle Donington is sometimes called a town, neither parish council has formally declared them to be towns.) The parishes are:
*Appleby Magna, Acresford, Ashby Woulds, Ashby-de-la-Zouch
*Bardon, Belton, Breedon on the Hill
*Castle Donington, Charley, Chilcote, Coleorton, Coalville
*Ellistown and Battleflat
*Heather, Hugglescote and Donington le Heath
*Ibstock, Isley cum Langley
*Kegworth
*Lockington-Hemington, Long Whatton and Diseworth
*Measham
*Normanton le Heath
*Oakthorpe and Donisthorpe, Osgathorpe
*Packington
*Ravenstone with Snibston
*Snarestone, Staunton Harold, Stretton en le Field, Swannington, Swepstone
*Whitwick, Worthington

<text>Tuonela (; ) is the realm of the dead or the Underworld in Finnish mythology. Tuonela, Tuoni (), Manala (, &#x27;Underworld&#x27;), Vainajala () and Mana () are used synonymously. Similar realms appear in most Finnic cultural traditions, including among Karelian, Ingrian, and Estonian beliefs. In Estonian mythology, the realm is called Toonela or Manala. Tuonela can also refer to a grave or a graveyard.

== Description ==
According to the Finnish pagan faith, the fate of good and bad people is the same and the dead wander the afterlife as shadow-like ghosts. Tuoni, god of the dead, and his wife Tuonetar are the rulers of Tuonela. Although physical descriptions of Tuonela vary between different versions of the myth, a general description emerges from most. 

According to scholars Felix Oinas and Juha Pentikäinen, Tuonela is described as being at the northernmost part of the world but is sectioned apart from the world of the living by a great divide. In the divide flows the dark river of Tuonela. The river is wild, and the dead can be seen trying to swim across it. The dead must cross the river, either by a thread bridge, swimming, or taking a boat piloted by the daughter of Tuoni. The river is guarded by a black swan that sings death spells. At times living people visited Tuonela to gather information and spells. The journey required a trip through thorn thickets and dangerous woods, and the defeat of the monster Surma, a flesh-tearing monster that works for the goddess of decay, Kalma. Once in Tuonela, the living were not allowed to leave. They would be welcomed by Tuonetar, who would offer them a memory-erasing beer to erase their former lives. Shamans could visit Tuonela by falling into a trance and tricking the guards. 

== Tuonela in other beliefs and myths ==
Tuonela is best known for its appearance in the Finnish national epic &quot;Kalevala,&quot; which is a collection of Finnish and Karelian mythology.

In the 19th song of &quot;Kalevala&quot;, Väinämöinen, a shamanistic hero, travels to Tuonela to seek the knowledge of the dead. On the journey, he meets the ferryman, a woman, Tuonen tytti / Tuonen tyttö (), or Tuonen piika (), who takes him over the river of Tuoni. On the isle of Tuoni, however, he is not given the spells that he was looking for and he barely manages to escape the place by turning into a snake. After his return, he curses anyone trying to enter the place alive.Also in the Kalevala, the adventurer-shaman Lemminkäinen goes to Pohjola to woo the daughter of Louhi, a powerful old sorceress. Louhi gives Lemminkäinen three tasks he must complete to woo her daughter. While trying to complete the third task, killing the swan of Tuonela, Lemminkäinen is cut into pieces by a water snake and thrown into a whirlpool in the river of Tuonela. Lemminkäinen&#x27;s mother is alerted of his death by a magical charm. She goes to the river, and rakes out the pieces of her son&#x27;s body. With the help of a bee, Lemminkäinen&#x27;s mother pieces together his body, and brings him back to life.

&quot;Tuonela&quot; is used as the translation for the Greek word ᾍδης (Hades) in Finnish translations of the Bible. In Finnish Christianity, Tuonela is often interpreted as the place of the dead before the Last Judgement.

<text>Redhill () is a town in the borough of Reigate and Banstead within the county of Surrey, England. The town, which adjoins the town of Reigate to the west, is due south of Croydon in Greater London, and is part of the London commuter belt. The town is also the post town, entertainment and commercial area of three adjoining communities : Merstham, Earlswood and Whitebushes, as well as of two small rural villages to the east in the Tandridge District, Bletchingley and Nutfield.

The town is situated on the junction of the north–south A23 (London to Brighton) road, and the east–west A25 road which runs from Guildford through to Sevenoaks. It is also on the railway junction, served by Redhill railway station, of the Brighton Main Line, North-Downs line, and Redhill-Tonbridge line.

== Geography ==
Redhill is located within the Weald Basin, and the Weald-Artois Anticline. The town is situated in the east–west lying Vale of Holmesdale at a place where there is a natural water-cut gap in the Greensand Ridge, which connects the town with the low-lying land of the Low Weald to the south. Today the Redhill Brook runs through the gap in the Greensand Ridge on its way to join the Salfords Stream and the River Mole to the south. (The brook is now mainly culverted through the town centre: it enters a culvert behind Redhill station and briefly reappears in town at the Halford&#x27;s car park, before emerging as a free-running stream again in Earlswood). The gap through the Greensand Ridge provides a way south for the London to Brighton railway and the A23 road.Gatwick airport is also nearby 7 miles south of the town. The housing of the town is built in the Vale of Holmesdale, and on the hillsides of the two ends of the Greensand Ridge (Redstone Hill and the hillside of Redhill Common), and on the flat of the water-cut gap in between.

To the north, the town joins with the village of Merstham, north of which there is a &quot;wind gap&quot; in the chalk hills of the North Downs, at an elevation of above sea level, through which the A23 road heads in from London. Geologists have speculated that there may once have been a consequent-flowing river, flowing northwards from the centre of the Weald-Artois Anticline and towards the River Thames, which originally cut both the Redhill Gap in the Greensand Ridge and the Merstham Gap in the chalk hills of the North Downs, before its waters were caught by subsequent streams of the River Mole (which itself cuts gaps northwards through the ridge at Betchworth, and through the Downs at Dorking, on its way to the Thames). Today the whole Redhill area is part of the catchment area of the River Mole, and hence the Thames.

The east–west running road the A25, approaches Redhill from the east along the elevated Greensand Ridge from Nutfield, and proceeds westward from Redhill along the Vale of Holmesdale towards Reigate and Dorking.

To the immediate north-east of the town are The Moors nature reserve and the large 2010–2012 (mid and low-rise) Watercolour housing development, comprising of lakes, paths and wildlife habitat managed by the Surrey Wildlife Trust.

Redhill is one of the few places in the UK where fuller&#x27;s earth can be extracted, though production ceased in 2000. Sand used to mined from a quarry in what is now Mercers Lake in Merstham.

== History ==
A settlement was formed here in part of the rural parishes of Reigate Foreign and Merstham when a turnpike road was built in 1818. The London-Brighton road passed through the Merstham Gap in the North Downs, and the Redhill Gap in the Greensand Ridge. The settlement was originally known as &quot;Warwick Town&quot; after Warwick Road, and became known as Redhill when the post office moved from Red Hill Common in the south-west of the town in 1856.

A major factor in the development of the town was the coming of the railways. The gap through the Greensand Ridge at Redhill was a major advantage for routing a railway from London to Brighton. A railway station opened in Redhill on 12 July 1841, after the London and Brighton Railway created a rail line by excavating the first of two rail tunnels under the North Downs at Merstham. Another railway station at Redhill followed on 26 May 1842, located on the South Eastern Railway&#x27;s London to Dover to line, which branched off the original line south of the Merstham tunnel. Then on 15 April 1844 both these two stations were closed, as a new combined station was opened at the junction that same day, serving both railways, at the site of the present station. In 1849 a branch line to Reigate was added.

St John the Evangelist, built in 1843, was the first of Redhill&#x27;s three Anglican parish churches. The parish originally stretched from Gatton in the north to Sidlow in the south.

Richard Carrington, an amateur astronomer, moved to Redhill in 1852, and built a house and observatory. Dome Way, where one of Redhill&#x27;s two tower block stands, is named after it. The site suited an isolated observatory, being on a spur of high ground surrounded by lower fields and marsh. Here in 1859 he made astronomical observations that first corroborated the existence of solar flares as well as their electrical influence upon the Earth and its aurorae. In 1863 he published records of sunspot observations that first demonstrated differential rotation in the Sun. In 1865 ill health prompted him to sell his house and move to Churt, Surrey. A pub is named the sun in recognition of his work.

In 1855, a large psychiatric hospital complete with well-trimmed grounds, was opened in Earlswood, south of Redhill. Prince Albert had laid the first stone in 1852. One inmate James Henry Pullen (1835–1916) was an autistic savant. He was a brilliant craftsman and artist whose work was accepted by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Some of Pullen&#x27;s ship models, designs and artwork used to be on display at the town&#x27;s Belfry Shopping Centre, but have now been moved to the Langdon Down Museum in Teddington. The asylum was renamed The Royal Earlswood Institution for Mental Defectives in June 1926, and more recently was simply named the Royal Earlswood Hospital or the royal Earlswood asylum. In 1941, the hospital became home to two of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother&#x27;s cousins, Katherine Bowes-Lyon and Nerissa Bowes-Lyon, both of whom had learning difficulties. The hospital closed in March 1997 following the introduction of Care in the Community. The buildings were then converted to residential apartments and the site is now known as Royal Earlswood Park.

In 1868 Alfred Nobel demonstrated dynamite for the first time at a Merstham quarry, two miles north of Redhill.

In 1884, a large residential school for children, called St Anne&#x27;s School, was opened by the St Anne&#x27;s Society (a city of London charity) to accommodate 400 boys and girls. Built on a rise to the east of the town, and overlooking the railway station and the countryside around, it had a swimming bath, a gymnasium, tennis courts (asphalted and grassed), an external recreation ground as well as covered playgrounds, 21 pianos, a clock turret, a chapel and a dining room both capable of seating 600, a bakery, a steam laundry, an infirmary, an isolation hospital, and extensive gardens and orchards, all in property of 17½ acres. The school closed in 1919 after funding difficulties. In 1926 the Foundling Hospital used the site to house its own school, until moving elsewhere in 1935. Later, Surrey County Council used St Anne&#x27;s as a Home for the Aged. In 1973 it became a home for the homeless, but closed in 1975 after being damaged by fire, and was demolished in 1987, to be replaced by housing.

The construction, to the east of Redhill, of the M23 motorway between 1972 and 1975 reduced north–south traffic through the town.

==Localities==
===Holmethorpe===
Holmethorpe can refer to two neighbouring developments, one residential, the other commercial/industrial and separated by the west track of the Brighton Main Line directly north of Redhill. A Holmethorpe Industrial Estate member&#x27;s organisation exists to provide security to and advertise recruitment among its 66 businesses and to work on traffic and local authority planning matters. Holmethorpe had at the 2001 census a population of 1,128.

===Watercolour===
Watercolour is a 2008–2012 built settlement and neighbourhood in Redhill towards the village of Merstham across lakes from the Greensand Ridge of the wooded village of Bletchingley and on the site of the former Holmethorpe Gravel Quarry.

===Redstone Hill===
Redstone Hill is above the Royal Mail sorting office and depot, centred around one of three Redhill conservation areas, across the station using the A25 or subway from most of the town. This neighbourhood includes a hotel-restaurant and unusually for a conservation area, no nationally listed buildings though some buildings are locally listed. Deep underneath the conservation area non-stopping services of the east branch of the Brighton Main Line run.

===Redhill Common (north) and Linkfield Street===
This area includes four nationally listed buildings: three at Grade II and one, Fengates House, at Grade II*. Fengates is a Georgian three-storey building built of red brick with grey headers and a moulded band above the second floor. Its roof is high and extends over the walls creating eaves. Its six-panel door has a moulded architrave and porch with dentil cornice.

===Redhill Common (south) and St John&#x27;s===

St John&#x27;s is a compact urban area on a narrow promontory of Redhill Common that is upland, with moderately sized gardens between Earlswood Common and Redhill Common, reached by a hillside access road from London Road. Unusually, the addresses of many of the buildings in the hamlet do not include a road name but are merely &quot;[number], St. John&#x27;s&quot;.

The disproportionately large St. John&#x27;s church was built in anticipation of the development of a town in the East of Reigate Foreign close to the railway station that opened in 1841. In 1844, after the church&#x27;s construction, the railway station was closed and a new one opened about a mile to the North, around which Warwick Town and then Redhill developed. It was not until 1866 that Redhill got a church of its own in the form of St. Matthew&#x27;s.

St John the Evangelist is one of five listed buildings (Grade II*) in the hamlet of St. John&#x27;s. John Loughborough Pearson remodelled it following its 1842-3 construction by James T Knowles (senior), retaining only the aisles added in 1867 by Ford &amp; Hesketh. Pearson was awarded the RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 1880 and is remembered for a series of exceptionally fine churches. These often display strong French influence: the spire at St John&#x27;s has been likened to the spires of Abbey of Saint-Étienne in Caen (St Steven&#x27;s Abbey). Other Pearson characteristics at St John&#x27;s are the stone-vaulted chancel and the transverse arches across the nave. Pearson&#x27;s most famous building is Truro Cathedral (1880) and the first English cathedral to be built on a new site since Salisbury in the early thirteenth century. This Gothic architecture is reflected by several nearby buildings.

===Shaw&#x27;s Corner===

Shaw&#x27;s Corner centres around the junction formed on the Reigate Road, in more precise terms named Hatchlands Road before becoming here Reigate Road close and includes homes on both sides of Reigate County Court, St Paul&#x27;s Church and a chapel. At this junction, on the south side in the middle of the street Blackstone Hill, is Richard R Goulden&#x27;s Shaw&#x27;s Corner War Memorial, a Grade II listed grand base and statue: a bronze figure on a square-set tapering stone plinth, of a man, carrying a child in one arm, and holding a flaming torch aloft with the other. At the top of the plinth is the inscription:&lt;br&gt;

On its other sides are the capitalised words Courage; Honour; and Self-Sacrifice. A further inscription beneath is graphic and includes &quot;Flames consume the flesh. The spirit is unconquerable.&quot; World War II dates have been added since the first unveiling by Earl Beatty. Halfway along Blackstone Hill is access downhill through Redhill Common to London Road Redhill where Common expands and adjoins the south of Redhill, also known as Earlswood.

==Transport==
===Road===
Redhill is at the junction of the A23 and A25 roads. It is also located within three miles of the M25 and M23 motorways, which interchange north-east of the town. Access from the M25 is via junction 6 (for Godstone) from the east and junction 8 (for Reigate) from the west, while access from the south is signed on M23 junction 9 (for Gatwick Airport).

===Rail===
The town is served by Redhill railway station which is located at the junction of three rail lines: the Brighton Main Line, the North Downs Line and the Redhill to Tonbridge Line. Train services are provided by Southern, Thameslink and Great Western Railway.

The station is a rail hub and is served by regular train services to , , , , , and .

Until 1845 there was a separate station from which one could travel to Ashford and Dover.

===Buses===
London Buses route 405, Metrobus routes 400, 410, 411, 420, 422, 424, 430, 435, 460 and Fastway 100, Compass Bus route 32 and Cruisers route 315 serve the town. All bus services in the town stop at Redhill Bus Station.

These buses provide connections to Reigate, Sutton, Epsom, Caterham, Oxted, Croydon, Dorking, Guildford, Gatwick Airport, Crawley and East Grinstead.

===Air===
Air access is available at London Gatwick Airport, which lies about seven miles to the south, as well as the small Redhill Aerodrome (EGKR) south-east of Redhill town centre. Heathrow airport is thirty miles to the north-west and both Luton and London City airports are accessible by train.

==Shopping==
Redhill has a pedestrianised High Street, which is adjoined by the Belfry Shopping Centre. More shops are available at the Warwick Quadrant. There is also a street market each Thursday, Friday and Saturday, sometimes including a French market. The Light, built in July 2023, has shops and a new cinema which was the first since 2011 in Redhill and an arcade. This is the first ever permanent arcade to be opened in Redhill. 

==Culture and community==
Redhill is part of the Reigate and Banstead local government district. Not far from the town is Gatton Park, an estate once owned by the Colmans; the estate has a private chapel (now open to the public) and a Japanese garden.

The town has a distinctive red-brick complex called the Warwick Quadrant, which houses the Harlequin Theatre and Cinema, and the public library, as well as Sainsbury&#x27;s and other shops. It has been refurbished and the red canopy and clock has been removed despite local opposition.

The former Odeon cinema was built in 1938. It was converted into a nightclub in 1976, operating under various names, most recently Liquid and envy, until 2011 when it was closed down permanently to make way for new housing. Despite a plan to retain the listed Art Deco façade, delays in rebuilding and a reluctance to use the façade meant it &quot;fell into decay&quot; and was demolished in December 2017.

The London to Brighton Veteran Car Run passes through the town each year.

==Local media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC London and ITV London. BBC South East and ITV Meridian can also be received.

The town’s local radio stations are BBC Radio Surrey on 104.0 FM, Heart South on 102.7 FM, Susy Radio on 103.4 FM and Radio Redhill that broadcast from the East Surrey Hospital on 100.4 FM.

Local newspapers are the &quot;Surrey Advertiser&quot; and &quot;Redhill and Reigate Life&quot;.

==Economy==

SES Water, Santander Consumer Finance, AXA breakdown assistance, Travelers Insurance, and Aon plc Risk Services have their headquarters in the town. There are also three industrial and business estates: Holmethorpe Industrial Estate, Kingsfield Business Centre, and Reading Arch.

Redhill Aerodrome (IATA: KRH, ICAO: EGKR) lies south-east of Redhill and operates pleasure flights, flying courses, and private commercial flights.

Whilst the town is a hub in commercial terms, with a shopping centre and several offices of large companies, a large proportion of the economically active population work in Greater London and other parts of Surrey.

For some central government statistical purposes, Redhill and Reigate are classified as a subdivision of the Crawley Urban Area. Redhill is 18 miles east of Guildford. The average commuting distance in 2001 for workers was in Redhill East and in Redhill West. Unemployment stood at 1.81% in the east and 2.13% in the west in 2001.

The first iteration of British Island Airways had its head office at Congreve House in Redhill.

==Demography==
Population, type of home ownership and population density were provided by the 2011 census. The proportion of households in Redhill who owned their home outright was below the regional average of 32.5%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan in each ward was within 5.5% of the regional average, in Redhill East being 5.3% greater, or 0.9% greater than the average for the borough. The data in each ward and overall for these combined showed a proportion of rented residential property and of social housing close to the average in South East England and to that of the local authority, significantly greater in Redhill West than in Redhill East where 21.8% of property was rented from a registered social landlord or directly from the local authority.

<text>East Midlands Airport is an international airport in Castle Donington, England. The airport is situated between Loughborough (), Derby () and Nottingham (); Leicester is to the south and Lincoln northeast. It serves the majority of the East Midlands region consisting of the counties of Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, Rutland and Derbyshire. The airfield was originally built as a Royal Air Force station known as RAF Castle Donington in 1943, before being redeveloped as a civilian airport in 1965.

East Midlands Airport has established itself as a hub for low-fare airlines such as Jet2.com and Ryanair and tour operators like TUI Airways, which serve a range of domestic and European short-haul destinations. In 2022, the airport was the 14th-busiest airport in the UK by passenger traffic. A central air cargo hub, it was the second-busiest UK airport for freight traffic in 2016, after London Heathrow.

The airport is owned by the Manchester Airports Group (MAG), the largest British-owned airport operator, which is controlled by the ten metropolitan borough councils of Greater Manchester, with Manchester City Council retaining the controlling stake.

==History==
===RAF Castle Donington===
RAF Castle Donington was opened as a Royal Air Force station in 1943, during the Second World War. The airfield was equipped with three concrete runways, together with two hangars, and was a satellite airfield to RAF Wymeswold, situated some to the southeast. Initially, the airfield was used by the 28 Operational Training Unit, training RAF Bomber Command crews on the Vickers Wellington, and subsequently by the 108 Operational Training Unit, later renamed 1382 Transport Conversion Unit, training RAF Transport Command crews on the Douglas Dakota. The airfield closed and the air force station was decommissioned in 1946.

===East Midlands Airport===
A group of local government agencies bought the former RAF station site in 1964, at which point a sizeable construction and runway investment programme was launched. The airfield was renamed East Midlands Airport to reflect the area it served, and it opened for passengers in April 1965, replacing the redundant Derby Airport.

Until 1982, when the head office moved to Donington Hall, British Midland had its head office on the airport property. BMI also had its maintenance base at the airport.

In 1993, National Express purchased the airport from the local councils. With Bournemouth Airport, it was sold to Manchester Airports Group in February 2001. In 2004 the airport was controversially renamed Nottingham East Midlands Airport. The change, however, did not last long, and on 8 December 2006, the airport&#x27;s name was reverted to East Midlands Airport.

EasyJet ceased operating from the airport on 5 January 2010. However, it was announced on 13 April 2011 that Bmibaby would close its Manchester and Cardiff bases, moving an additional service to East Midlands Airport with increased frequencies and new routes for summer 2012. It was announced only just over a year later, on 3 May 2012, that Bmibaby would close down and cease all operations in September 2012, with a number of services being dropped from June. The parent company, International Airlines Group, cited heavy losses and the failure to find a suitable buyer as the reasons for the decision. In light of the announcement, Flybe and Monarch Airlines announced they would establish a base at the airport, and low-cost airline Jet2.com confirmed they would also expand their operations from the airport, with new routes and an additional aircraft from the summer of 2013. In 2015, the airport announced jet2.com would base a seventh aircraft at East Midlands Airport in the summer period. Ryanair expanded its East Midlands base with a series of new routes and frequency increases on existing routes. Ryanair became the largest airline at the airport, accounting for about 50% of passenger traffic, with East Midlands now being Ryanair&#x27;s third-largest UK airport, after London Stansted and Manchester, both now also owned by MAG.

In 2016, Heathrow handled 1.54 million tonnes of freight and mail, compared with 300,100 tonnes in East Midlands. DHL Aviation has a large purpose-built facility at EMA, and courier companies UPS and PostNL use the airport as a base to import and export freight.

===Development since 2020===
On 4 March 2020, Flybe entered administration, with EMA announcing that all flights were cancelled with immediate effect, the following day.

In the summer of 2020, Aer Lingus announced they would commence flights to Belfast, operated by Stobart Air, taking over the route which was once operated by Flybe, until their collapse in early 2020. In June 2021, Stobart Air collapsed, ceasing the route. Later in the month, EasyJet announced they would take over the Belfast route, operating frequent flights to Belfast International Airport. This was the first easyJet route announced from East Midlands since they stopped services from the airport in January 2010.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===

The following airlines operate regular scheduled passenger flights to and from East Midlands:


===Cargo===

East Midlands Airport is a major hub for freight operations throughout Europe due to its central location within the United Kingdom. The East Midlands Gateway rail-served inland port lies immediately to the north of the airport. The airport serves as a hub for DHL Aviation and UPS Airlines and sees flights by several of their sub-contractors to domestic, European and intercontinental destinations. Cargo operations at the airport increased significantly throughout the COVID-19 pandemic - cargo aircraft movements increasing by 10% in the first week following the implementation of social distancing measures on 16 March 2020 and overall annual freight and mail increasing by 13% from 2019 to 2020. Further growth was seen throughout 2021 and 2022.

==Statistics==

==Other facilities==
Pegasus Business Park, an office complex, is on the airport grounds. The now-defunct airline flybmi formerly had its head office at Pegasus Business Park.

==Ground transport==
===Motorway===

The airport has excellent connections to the motorway network, as it is near the intersection of the M1, A42 and A50 at Donington Park, bringing the airfield within easy reach of the major population centres of the Midlands. The A46 is also within reach for journeys to the rest of the East Midlands.

===Drop-off fees===
The airport introduced a charge to drop car passengers near the departure lounge in 2010.

===Railway===
The airport has no direct access to the passenger rail network or the Nottingham Express Transit tram network. The nearest railway station is East Midlands Parkway, away, with regular services to Leicester, Derby, Sheffield, Lincoln, Nottingham and London St Pancras. The original shuttle bus service linking the station and the airport ceased not long after it was introduced, but in 2015 an hourly minibus service was reintroduced by Elite Cars, restoring scheduled shuttle services to and from the airport. Connections to the airport via taxi are also available.

A dedicated railway station at the airport is proposed, which would be connected to the existing network via a spur from the Midland main line. If the project goes ahead, it is expected to be complete by 2040 and will offer direct services to nearby cities as well as the existing East Midlands Parkway railway station. A new line to the airport on the Nottingham Express Transit network is also proposed, planned to be open by 2045.

A 700-acre (280 ha) railfreight terminal, East Midlands Gateway, opened on the SEGRO Logistics Park to the north of the airport in 2020, so that the site is now served by air, road and rail cargo. As of December 2021, this was handling 10,000 shipping containers, with trains to ports including Felixstowe, London Gateway, Southampton and Liverpool.

===Bus===
East Midlands Airport is served 24/7 by Skylink services which are operated by Kinchbus and trentbarton alongside My15 and Airline9 buses.

As of May 2022 the airport is served by the services listed.

The airport also has a car park shuttle bus service, which is presently run by First Group.

==East Midlands Aeropark==

The East Midlands Aeropark to the north west corner of the airport has a large number of static aircraft on public display, the majority of which are from British manufacturers. The museum and its exhibits are managed and maintained by the Aeropark Volunteers Association (AVA). It also offers two viewing mounds for watching aircraft arriving and departing from the main runway. AVA Members are allowed free access to the Aeropark. Exhibits include an Aérospatiale Gazelle, a de Havilland Vampire and an English Electric Canberra amongst several others.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 20 February 1969, Vickers Viscount G-AODG of British Midland Airways was damaged beyond economic repair when it landed short of the runway. There were no casualties.
* On 31 January 1986, Aer Lingus Flight 328, a Short 360, en route from Dublin, struck power lines and crashed short of the runway. None of the 36 passengers and crew died but two passengers were injured in the accident.
* On 18 January 1987, a British Midland Fokker F27 Friendship, on a training flight, crashed on approach to East Midlands Airport due to wing and tail surface icing. There were no fatalities.
* On 8 January 1989, British Midland Flight 92 crashed on approach to East Midlands Airport, killing 47 people. The Boeing 737 aircraft had developed a fan blade failure in one of the two engines while en route from London Heathrow to Belfast and a decision was made to divert to East Midlands. The crew mistakenly shut down the functioning engine, causing the aircraft to lose power and crash on the embankment of the M1 Motorway just short of the runway. No one on the ground was injured and no vehicles were damaged despite the aircraft crashing on the embankment of one of the busiest sections of motorway in the UK. The investigation into the Kegworth air disaster, as the incident became known, led to considerable improvements in aircraft safety and emergency instructions for passengers. The official report into the disaster made 31 safety recommendations.
* On 29 October 2010, in the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot, British police searched a UPS plane at East Midlands Airport but found nothing. Later that day, when a package was found on a plane in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, British officials searched again and found a bomb. The two packages, found on two planes originating in Yemen, contained the powerful high explosive PETN. The U.K. and the U.S. determined that the plan was to detonate them while in flight. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula took responsibility.

<text>Watford is a London Underground station in Watford, Hertfordshire. It is the terminus of the Watford branch of the Metropolitan line and the next station towards London is Croxley. The station is located in Zone 7. It was opened in 1925.

== Location and description ==
The station is in the Cassiobury area, on Cassiobury Park Avenue at the junction with Metropolitan Station Approach, close to two of the entrances to Cassiobury Park. It is approximately from the town centre, which is more immediately served by and stations. The station building was designed by the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s architect Charles Walter Clark in an Arts and Crafts vernacular style. It is in red brick with a clay-tiled hipped roof, tall brick chimney stacks, and timber sash and casement windows. The main entrance is covered by a polygonal metal canopy supported by twin Doric columns, and the interior, mostly unaltered from the original, is decorated with period tiling and hardwood panelling. The station building is Grade II listed.

According to data compiled in 2010, it is the 25th-least used station on the London Underground.

== History ==

In the early 20th century, the Metropolitan Railway (MR) penetrated Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire with its suburban railway, enticing Londoners with its &quot;Metro-Land&quot; advertising campaign promoting the new railway as an opportunity to live in a rural location with easy transport to central London. The MR was also intent on providing a connection from Watford and planned a branch line from via . The MR purchased a swathe of land from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge along the planned route, and Parliamentary approval for the branch was granted in 1912. The project was hampered by disagreements with the Watford Borough Council and by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, and construction of the branch did not begin until 1922. The MR experienced difficulties running the line across the River Gade and the Grand Junction Canal, and this pushed costs up to £300,000.

Watford MR station opened on 2 November 1925, with MR electric trains to and LNER steam trains to for the first few months. The &quot;Watford Observer&quot; commented on the opening that the new station was &quot;likely to have a much greater effect on the town than is at present realised. Just as trade follows the flag, so population follows the railway&quot;. Posters published by the MR in 1925 promoting the new route &quot;by Metro to Watford&quot; depicted Watford High Street on market day, belying the remote location of the station.

For many years, the MR operated a bus service from the High Street in an effort to gain more passengers, but contrary to the &quot;Watford Observer&quot;&#x27;s predictions patronage remained low. MR passenger numbers compared unfavourably with services into central London offered by the LMS and the UERL Bakerloo line from and , and after the General Strike of 1926 the LNER pulled out of the venture with the MR.

Watford tube station in Cassiobury Park Avenue was not originally planned to be the terminus of the Watford branch. The Metropolitan Railway Company&#x27;s original plans drawn up in 1912 intended the line to continue through Cassiobury Park and beyond to Hempstead Road on an area known locally as &#x27;The Wilderness&#x27;, where West Herts College would later be built (opened in 1938).

Watford Council had recently bought part of the Cassiobury Estate and objected to the proposed railway through the town park and recreation gardens, and so the last section of the route was removed and the line would end abruptly in Cassiobury Park Avenue instead.

An opportunity arose in 1927 for another route to extend the line into the centre of Watford. Through a third party, the Metropolitan was able to purchase an existing building at 44 Watford High Street together with two-and-a-half acres of backlands, with the intention of creating a terminus in the town centre. The possibility of a single-track extension in tunnel—either from the existing station or following a diversionary route around the station—was explored, but costs were extremely high and no Parliamentary powers were sought. The High Street building was leased out and was eventually disposed of by London Transport in 1936, and today Watford station remains the terminus of the line, approximately one mile from the town centre.

When Travelcard zones were introduced in 1984 by London Regional Transport, the station was in Zone B; in 2004 it moved to Zone A, and in 2008 to Zone 7.

== Future ==


The ambition to extend the Metropolitan line into Watford town centre was revived around 1994 by London Regional Transport (LRT) when proposals were put forward to run the line to Watford Junction. The projected route was shown on an adapted version of the Tube map for internal planning purposes printed in that year. This project, known as the Croxley Rail Link, involved connecting the Metropolitan line to the disused Watford and Rickmansworth Railway line and reinstating the branch to . The line, opened in 1912, had been closed by British Rail in 1996 owing to low passenger numbers. Although it ran very close to the Metropolitan line (at its closest point about 200 metres away), the two lines were never linked. The plan was to connect the two lines via a short viaduct. The Croxley Rail Link project would have resulted in the closure of Watford station.

On 14 December 2011, the project was given approval by the Department for Transport at an expected cost of £115.9 million with a proposed completion date of January 2016, later revised to 2020. The planned closure of Watford station met with some local opposition, and campaigners lobbied for the station to remain open with a reduced shuttle service. A report compiled in 2012 by the transport watchdog London TravelWatch concluded that the opening of new stations on the route would mitigate any inconvenience caused by the closure, and that a minority of passengers would experience an increase in journey times of more than 15 minutes. It also recommended that a shuttle train service should be trialled, and that in the event of closure a bus service should be provided from Cassiobury to one of the new stations.

On 25 January 2017, the &quot;Watford Observer&quot; newspaper published an update on the Croxley Rail Link confirming work had stopped as there was an ongoing funding issue.

== Services ==
, the typical off-peak service was four trains per hour to Baker Street, with a limited service to Aldgate at peak times.

<text>Richmond, also known as Richmond (London), is an interchange station in Richmond, Greater London on the Waterloo to Reading and North London lines. It is a western terminus of both the District line of the London Underground and the Mildmay line of the London Overground. South Western Railway services on the Waterloo to Reading Line are routed through Richmond, which is between and St Margarets stations, down the line from . 
==Architecture==
The station building, designed by James Robb Scott in Portland stone and dating from 1937, is in Art Deco style and its facade includes a square clock. The area in front of the station main entrance was pedestrianised in 2013 and includes a war memorial to soldier Bernard Freyberg, who was born in Richmond.

==History==
The Richmond and West End Railway (R&amp;WER) opened the first station at Richmond on 27 July 1846, as the terminus of its line from . This station was on a site to the south of the present through platforms, which later became a goods yard and where a multi-storey car park now stands. The Windsor, Staines and South Western Railway (WS&amp;SWR) extended the line westward, resiting the station to the west side of The Quadrant, on the extended tracks and slightly west of the present through platforms. Both the R&amp;WER and WS&amp;SWR were subsidiary companies of the London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR).

On 1 January 1869, the L&amp;SWR opened the Kensington and Richmond line from north of Addison Road station (now Kensington (Olympia) station) on the West London Joint Railway. This line ran through Hammersmith (Grove Road) station, since closed, and and had connection with the North &amp; South Western Junction Railway (N&amp;SWJR) near . Most of this line is now part of the London Underground District line; the line south from Gunnersbury was also served by the North London Railway (NLR) and is now used also by London Overground. Before this line was built, services north from Richmond ran somewhat circuitously via chords at Kew Bridge and Barnes.

The Great Western Railway (GWR) briefly (1 June to 31 October 1870) ran a service from to Richmond via the Hammersmith &amp; City Railway (now the Hammersmith &amp; City line) tracks to Grove Road and then over the L&amp;SWR tracks through Turnham Green.

On 1 June 1877, the District Railway (DR) linked its then terminus at Hammersmith to the nearby L&amp;SWR tracks east of the present station. The DR began running trains over the L&amp;SWR tracks to Richmond. On 1 October 1877, the Metropolitan Railway (MR, now the Metropolitan line) restarted the former GWR service to Richmond via Grove Road station.

The DR route from Richmond to central London via Hammersmith was more direct than those of the NLR via , of the L&amp;SWR and the MR via Grove Road station and of the L&amp;SWR via Clapham Junction to Waterloo. From 1 January 1894, the GWR began sharing the MR Richmond service, resulting in Gunnersbury having the services of five operators.

After electrifying its tracks north of in 1903, the DR funded the electrification, completed on 1 August 1905, from Gunnersbury to Richmond. The DR ran electric trains on the branch, while the L&amp;SWR, NLR, GWR and MR services continued to be steam hauled.

MR services ceased on 31 December 1906 and those of the GWR on 31 December 1910, leaving operations northwards through Kew Gardens and Gunnersbury to the DR, the NLR and L&amp;SWR. On 3 June 1916, the L&amp;SWR withdrew its service from Richmond to Addison Road through Hammersmith due to competition from the District line, leaving the District as the sole operator over that route and the NLR providing main line services via Willesden Junction.

Under the grouping of 1923, the L&amp;SWR became part of the Southern Railway (SR) and the NLR became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS); both were subsequently nationalised into British Railways. On 1 August 1937, the SR opened its rebuilt station with the station building and the through platforms moved east to be next to the terminal platforms. At around the same time, the SR moved the goods yard from the site of the original terminus to a new location north-east of the station.

===Accident===
On 18 September 1987, an accident occurred at Richmond when a westbound District line hit the buffers of platform 6 and broke the glass/perspex panels behind. No passengers were seriously injured.

===Crossrail===
A Crossrail branch to Kingston upon Thames via Richmond was proposed in 2003, but was dropped in 2004 due to a combination of local opposition, complex choices and engineering at the start of the route, cost, and insufficient return on investment. It could have run either overland or via a tunnel to and on the existing track through to Richmond (which would have lost the District line service) and thence to Kingston.

==Platforms==
The station has seven platforms numbered from south to north:
* Platforms 1 and 2 are through platforms for South Western Railway services.
* Platforms 3 to 7 are terminating platforms used by:
** London Overground Mildmay line services (normally platforms 4 and 5 but sometimes 3, 6 and 7)
** London Underground District line services (normally platforms 6 and 7. Occasionally 4 and 5 but never 3 due to 3&#x27;s lack of a fourth rail, which the District Line uses for electric power).

As of September 2011, work was under way to extend platforms 1 and 2 to accept 10-car trains. The bulk of the lengthening was to be at the west (country) end; extending eastwards was deemed unviable by Network Rail as Church Road Bridge would have needed widening. As part of these works, the platform canopies were also being refurbished.

The wide gap between platforms 3 and 4 originally had a third, run-around track for steam locomotives.

Eight retail units are at the station: four eatery-cafés on alternate sides of the barriers (two on the rail side being thin and smaller) similarly two kiosks, the upper one being a hot drinks kiosk through to a M&amp;S Simply Food grocery store. A florist and a WH Smith flank the entrance.

==Services==
Services at Richmond are operated by South Western Railway, London Overground on the Mildmay line and London Underground on the District line.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 2 tph between and . These services are the fastest services to London Waterloo, calling at only intermediately.
* 2 tph between London Waterloo and . These services call at Putney, Clapham Junction and Vauxhall on the way to London Waterloo.
* 2 tph in each direction on the loop service via , returning to London Waterloo via and , calling at all stations.
* 4 tph to via 
* 6 tph to via 

Additional services, including trains to and from , , and London Waterloo via call at the station during the peak hours.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 33, 65, 110, 190, 337, 371, 419, 490, 493, H37, R68, R70, mobility route 969 and night routes N22 and N65 serve the station.

<doc id="349441" wikidata="Q801000" url="?curid=349441" title="Kew Gardens station (London)">
<text>Kew Gardens is a Grade II–listed interchange station on the District line of the London Underground and the Mildmay line of the London Overground. Located in Kew in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, it first opened in 1869 and is now managed by London Underground. The station, which is in Travelcard Zones 3 and 4, is situated midway between and stations.

The station is the nearest to Kew Gardens, about to the west, and The National Archives, about to the north east. Kew Gardens Station Footbridge, also a Grade II-listed structure, is next to the station, on the southern side.

==Access==
The main entrance to the station is at the junction of Station Parade, Station Avenue and Station Approach, about from Sandycombe Road (B353). There is also an entrance, which is wheelchair-accessible, on North Road, on the other side of the railway line; the two entrances are connected by a pedestrian subway.

==History==
The station was opened by the London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR) on 1 January 1869, in an area of market gardens and orchards. The station was located on a new L&amp;SWR branch line to Richmond built from the West London Joint Railway starting north of Addison Road station (now ). The line ran through Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and Hammersmith via a now closed curve and Grove Road station (also now closed) in Hammersmith. Via a short connection from the North &amp; South Western Junction Railway (N&amp;SWJR) to Gunnersbury the line was also served by the North London Railway (NLR).

Between 1 June 1870 and 31 October 1870, the Great Western Railway (GWR) briefly ran services from to via Hammersmith &amp; City Railway (now the Hammersmith &amp; City line) tracks to Grove Road then on the L&amp;SWR tracks through Kew Gardens.

On 1 June 1877, the District Railway (DR, now the District line) opened a short extension from its terminus at Hammersmith to connect to the L&amp;SWR tracks east of station. The DR then began running trains over the L&amp;SWR tracks to Richmond. On 1 October 1877, the Metropolitan Railway (MR, now the Metropolitan line) restarted the GWR&#x27;s former service to Richmond via Grove Road station.

The DR&#x27;s service between Richmond, Hammersmith and central London was more direct than the NLR&#x27;s route via , the L&amp;SWR&#x27;s or the MR&#x27;s routes via Grove Road station or the L&amp;SWR&#x27;s other route from Richmond via . From 1 January 1894, the GWR began sharing the MR&#x27;s Richmond service and served Kew Gardens once again, meaning that passengers from Kew Gardens could travel on the services of five operators.

Following the electrification of the DR&#x27;s own tracks north of in 1903, the DR funded the electrification of the tracks on the Richmond branch, including those through Kew Gardens. This was completed on 1 August 1905 and DR services on the line were then operated with electric trains. However, the L&amp;SWR, NLR, GWR and MR services continued to be steam-hauled.

MR services were withdrawn on 31 December 1906 and GWR services were withdrawn on 31 December 1910, leaving operations at Kew Gardens and Gunnersbury to the DR (by then known as the District Railway), the NLR and L&amp;SWR. By 1916, the L&amp;SWR&#x27;s route through Hammersmith was being out-competed by the District to such a degree that the L&amp;SWR withdrew its service between Richmond and Addison Road on 3 June 1916, leaving the District as the sole operator over that route.

A brass plaque at the station commemorates its reopening on 7 October 1989 by Michael Portillo MP, Minister of State for Transport, after it had been refurbished.

==Present==
The two-storey yellow brick station buildings are unusually fine examples of mid-Victorian railway architecture and are protected as part of the Kew Gardens conservation area. The station is one of the few remaining 19th-century stations on the North London line and had one of the last illuminated banner signals on the London Underground, possibly because of the footbridge. This signal was replaced by an electronic version in 2011.

Kew Gardens is the only station on the London Underground network that has a pub attached to it. The pub has a door (no longer in use) which leads out onto platform 1. Previously known as &quot;The Railway&quot;, and subsequently as &quot;The Pig and Parrot&quot; and as &quot;The Flower and Firkin&quot;, the pub reopened after renovation in 2013 as &quot;The Tap on the Line&quot;.

==Kew Gardens Station Footbridge==


The footbridge to the south of the station is also noteworthy and is Grade II-listed in its own right. The railway line bisected Kew, but it was not until 1912 that the bridge was provided to allow residents to cross the tracks safely (previously, a level crossing was used, with the added disadvantage of delaying trains). It is a rare surviving example of a reinforced concrete structure built using a pioneering technique devised by the French engineer François Hennebique. The bridge has a narrow deck and very high walls, originally designed to protect its users&#x27; clothing from the smoke of steam trains passing underneath. It also has protrusions on either side of the deck to deflect smoke away from the bridge structure.

<doc id="349445" wikidata="Q756069" url="?curid=349445" title="List of X-planes">
<text>The X-planes are a series of experimental United States aircraft and rockets, used to test and evaluate new technologies and aerodynamic concepts. They have an X designator within the US system of aircraft designations, which denotes the experimental research mission.

Not all US experimental aircraft have been designated as X-planes; some received US Navy designations before 1962, while others have been known only by manufacturers&#x27; designations, non-&#x27;X&#x27;-series designations, or classified codenames. This list only includes the designated X-planes.

==History==
The X-planes concept officially came into being in 1944, as a joint programme between the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the US Navy (USN) and the US Army Air Forces (USAAF), in order to pursue research into high-speed aircraft. NACA later became the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the USAAF became the United States Air Force (USAF). Other organizations such as the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the US Marine Corps (USMC) have also since sponsored X-plane projects.

The first experimental aircraft specification, for a transonic rocket plane, was placed in 1945, and the first operational flight of an X-plane took place when the Bell X-1 made its first powered flight nearly three years later at Muroc Air Force Base, California, now known as Edwards Air Force Base. The majority of X-plane testing has since taken place there.

X-planes have since accomplished many aviation &quot;firsts&quot; including breaking speed and altitude barriers, varying wing sweep in flight, implementing exotic alloys and propulsion innovations, and many more.

New X-planes appeared fairly regularly for many years until the flow temporarily stopped in the early 1970s. A series of experimental hypersonic projects, including an advanced version of the Martin Marietta X-24 lifting body, were turned down. Eventually issues with the Rockwell HiMAT advanced UAV led to a crewed X-plane with forward sweep, the Grumman X-29, which flew in 1984.

Some of the X-planes have been well publicized, while others, such as the X-16, have been developed in secrecy. The first, the Bell X-1, became well known in 1947 after it became the first aircraft to break the sound barrier in level flight. Later X-planes supported important research in a multitude of aerodynamic and technical fields, but only the North American X-15 rocket plane of the early 1960s achieved comparable fame to that of the X-1. X-planes 8, 9, 11, 12, and 17 were actually missiles used to test new types of engines, and some other vehicles were unoccupied or UAVs (some were remotely flown, some were partially or fully autonomous).

Most X-planes are not expected to go into full-scale production; one exception was the Lockheed Martin X-35, which competed against the Boeing X-32 during the Joint Strike Fighter Program, and has entered production as the F-35 Lightning II.

==List==
In the list, the date is that of the first flight, or of cancellation if it never flew.

<text>Hubert Miles Gladwyn Jebb, 1st Baron Gladwyn (25 April 1900 – 24 October 1996) was a prominent British civil servant, diplomat and politician who served as the acting secretary-general of the United Nations between 1945 and 1946.

== Early life and career ==
The son of Sydney Gladwyn Jebb JP, of Firbeck Hall, Yorkshire (a grandson of Sir Joshua Jebb and a maternal nephew of the 5th and 6th Viscounts Melville) and Rose Eleanor Chichester, Jebb attended Sandroyd School and Eton College before graduating from Magdalen College, Oxford with a first class honours degree in history.

Jebb entered the British Diplomatic Service in 1924 and served in Tehran, where he got to know Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West. He later served in Rome and at the Foreign Office in Westminster, where he served as Private Secretary to the Head of the Diplomatic Service.

==Personal life==
In 1929, Jebb married Cynthia Noble, daughter of Sir Saxton Noble, 3rd Baronet. She was a granddaughter of the gun-developer Sir Andrew Noble, 1st Baronet, and a great-granddaughter of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The couple had three children, one son, Miles, and two daughters: Vanessa, who married the historian Hugh Thomas, and Stella, who married the scientist Joel de Rosnay and was the mother of the French writer Tatiana de Rosnay.

== Second World War ==
For part of the War of 1939 to 1945, Jebb left the Foreign Office to serve as the Chief Executive Officer for the Special Operations Executive, where he was from 1940 to 1942. On his return to the Foreign Office, Jebb asked to be posted to Madagascar, but this application was rejected, and he was sent to the Treasury for economic training.

== Acting UN Secretary-General ==
After the Second World War, Jebb served as Executive Secretary of the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations in August 1945 and served as Acting United Nations Secretary-General from October 1945 to February 1946, when the first Secretary-General was appointed, Trygve Lie.

Jebb remains the only UN Secretary-General or Acting Secretary-General to come from a permanent member state of the UN Security Council.

== Ambassador ==
Returning to London, Jebb served as Deputy to the Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin at the Conference of Foreign Ministers before serving as the Foreign Office&#x27;s United Nations Adviser (1946–1947). He represented the United Kingdom at the Brussels Treaty Permanent Commission with personal rank of ambassador.

Jebb became the United Kingdom&#x27;s Ambassador to the United Nations from 1950 to 1954 and to Paris from 1954 to 1960. He was the first permanent UN representative of the United Kingdom. In the latter role, he was angered that secret negotiations between the British, French and Israelis in advance of the Suez invasion in 1956 took place at Sèvres without his knowledge and, in certain respects, that he was sidelined by Prime Minister Harold Macmillan at the Paris &quot;big power&quot; summit in 1960.

Jebb&#x27;s rather &quot;grand&quot; manner caused Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd to coin an epigram: &quot;You&#x27;re a deb, Sir Gladwyn Jebb&quot;.

== Political career ==

Jebb was knighted in 1949. On 12 April 1960 Jebb was created a hereditary peer and as Baron Gladwyn, of Bramfield in the County of Suffolk. He became involved in politics as a member of the Liberal Party. He was Deputy Leader of the Liberals in the House of Lords from 1965 to 1988 and spokesman on foreign affairs and defence. An ardent European, he served as a Member of the European Parliament from 1973 to 1976, where he was also the Vice-President of the Parliament&#x27;s Political Committee. Jebb unsuccessfully contested the Suffolk seat in the European Parliament in 1979.

When asked in the early 1960s why he had joined the Liberal Party, he replied that the Liberals were a party without a general and that he was a general without a party. Like many Liberals, he passionately believed that education was the key to social reform.

== Death ==

Jebb died on 24 October 1996 at the age of 96, the 51st anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. He is buried at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Bramfield in Suffolk.

Jebb&#x27;s papers were deposited at the Churchill Archives Centre of the University of Cambridge by his son, Miles Gladwyn Jebb, 2nd Baron Gladwyn, between 1998 and 2000.

==In popular culture==
In an episode of &quot;The Goon Show&quot; broadcast on 16 February 1959 entitled &quot;The Gold Plate Robbery&quot;, Major Bloodnok – in his rôle as &#x27;the last British Ambassador in Marrakesh&#x27; – is heard to muse aloud &quot;Now, for a kip on full Ambassador&#x27;s pay. Gad! I wonder what old Gladwyn Jebb&#x27;s doing&quot;.

<doc id="349448" wikidata="Q847915" url="?curid=349448" title="Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water">
<text>Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water is the third studio album by American nu metal band Limp Bizkit. Released a year after the success of &quot;Significant Other&quot;, the album saw the band attempt to capitalize on their newfound mainstream success. It was released on October 17, 2000, through Flip and Interscope Records, setting a record for the fastest-selling rock album upon release at the time. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 Album chart in the United States, selling 1,054,511 copies in its first week alone. The album ultimately sold over 6.7 million copies in the United States alone and would also go onto receive platinum certification in 13 countries, selling a further 10 million copies worldwide.

It was the band&#x27;s last album to feature guitarist Wes Borland until the 2011 album &quot;Gold Cobra&quot;.

==Background and recording==
In January 2000, Limp Bizkit sought to return to the studio in an effort to capitalize off of their mainstream success stemming from &quot;Significant Other&quot;″s release the previous year. The band initially hired Rick Rubin to produce the record, though creative differences culminated in him abandoning the project after less than a week, culminating in Terry Date returning to produce the record. Through multiple interviews, Fred Durst and guitarist Wes Borland often expressed that they had very little material prepared for the writing sessions, with Borland claiming during an interview in January 2000; &quot;I don&#x27;t think that we entered the studio with a method, or there&#x27;s like 17,000 methods and we used all of them&quot;. Recording sessions took longer than expected as the band regularly experimented with newer material whilst simultaneously touring as headliners in Napster&#x27;s Back-To-Basics tour. The longtime working title for the album had been &quot;Limpdependence Day&quot;, but this was abandoned after the band failed to meet the deadline for their original intended release date of July 4. Despite numerous delays; the band managed to compose most of their new songs by August 2000; debuting the track &quot;Livin&#x27; It Up&quot; at that year&#x27;s MTV Video Music Awards in a duet performance with Christina Aguilera.

===Promotion===
The band appeared at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards in September 2000 due in large part as they were nominated for multiple awards; and in conjunction with their performance alongside Christina Aguilera. In a mashup of the two artists following Aguilera&#x27;s performance of her 1999 single &quot;Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)&quot;, the band played an excerpt of the song &quot;Livin&#x27; It Up&quot; possibly hinting at the song being a future single, though this never materialized for unknown reasons. The following weekend, the band announced a radio-broadcast listening party on New York&#x27;s 92.3 WXRK live from Electric Lady Studios in New York City while they answered questions from callers, and the station played several songs of the album.

To generate further attention for the album&#x27;s release; the band&#x27;s management group The Firm hosted a large scale party at the Playboy Mansion in Southern California on the night of the album&#x27;s release. The band aired a full hour-long special on MTV with numerous celebrities present; such as Chino Moreno from Deftones, David Silveria from Korn, Mark McGrath from Sugar Ray, Brandon Boyd from Incubus, Xzibit and more. Durst had initially approached MTV producers with his proposal for the special, in which they later allowed him to cohost per his own request.

They also embarked on a fall co-headlining tour with Eminem called the Anger Management Tour through North America in late 2000, with Papa Roach, Xzibit and D12 acting as support during the first leg through November 21st, 2000. On the 2nd leg from November 24th to December 19th, 2000. Godsmack, DMX and Sinnistar took over. The tour was unique for its approach to bridging the gap between rock and hip hop and merging them with the ultimate experience of a tour with sounds like Nu Metal, Rap Rock and Hip Hop all merging together for the first time.

===Title===
&quot;Chocolate Starfish&quot; is a slang term for the human anus. &quot;Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot; is based on an in-joke started by Wes Borland at a truck stop while the band was on tour during the summer of 2000, in which Borland saw bottles of Crystal Geyser flavored water, and made a joke about having meat or hot dog flavored water.

Durst himself refers to the album name in three songs. First, &quot;Livin&#x27; It Up&quot;, where he declares that, &quot;The chocolate starfish is my man Fred Durst.&quot; (Wes Borland has stated in an interview when questioned on the naming of the album that, &quot;Fred calls himself Chocolate Starfish, because people call him an asshole all the time.&quot;) Second, &quot;Hot Dog&quot;, where he tells his detractors to, &quot;Kiss my starfish, my chocolate starfish,&quot; and &quot;Rollin&#x27; (Air Raid Vehicle)&quot; where he mentions &quot;Chocolate Starfish&quot; in the introduction.

Numerous critics and fans speculated that the name was a humorous parody of Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; 1995 album &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
The song &quot;Hot Dog&quot; features the word &quot;fuck&quot; 47 times; Durst points out in the lyrics &quot;If I say &quot;fuck&quot; two more times, that&#x27;s forty-six &quot;fuck&quot;s in this fucked up rhyme&quot;. The chorus references the Nine Inch Nails songs &quot;Closer&quot;, &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot; and &quot;Burn&quot;. Durst said he was a big fan of Nine Inch Nails, who inspired his music, although Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor had made negative remarks about Durst during that period. Reviewers have often interpreted Durst&#x27;s lyrics in &quot;Hot Dog&quot; as an insult to Reznor. The lyrical references to Reznor&#x27;s music led to him getting a co-writer credit, which Reznor said he approved as the record was going to print as not to hold up the release. &quot;Livin&#x27; It Up&quot; samples &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot; by the American rock band Eagles. The lyrics of &quot;My Generation&quot; reference &quot;My Generation&quot; by The Who and &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; by Guns N&#x27; Roses.

===Lawsuit and sample removal===
The track &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; used an uncredited sample of music that is played during the Aerial Trapeze Act of Cirque Du Soleil&#x27;s Cirque Reinvente. In the September 2008 issue of &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, Wes Borland told the magazine: &quot;We actually got sued over this piece of shit. There was some sort of sample used in it that someone didn&#x27;t get full clearance for, so we ended up getting into some serious trouble for a little while.&quot; When the album was later released onto streaming services, the track &quot;Getcha Groove On (Dirt Road Mix)&quot;, from their remix album &quot;New Old Songs&quot;, replaced the original version.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album sold 1,054,511 copies in its first week of being released, with 400,000 of those copies being sold in the album&#x27;s first day of release—the largest first-week sales debut for a rock album in the United States ever since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking album sales in 1991. It was also the fifth highest-week debut sales of 2000, behind Eminem&#x27;s &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot;, &#x27;N Sync&#x27;s &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;, Backstreet Boys&#x27; &quot;Black &amp; Blue&quot; and Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&quot;. In its second week of being released, the album sold 392,000 copies, and remained at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album also went to number 1 on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 98,707 copies in its first week in the country. Two months after its release date, the album was certified 4× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and almost seven months after its release date, it was certified 5× platinum by the RIAA. In April 2002, the album was certified 6× platinum by the RIAA. It also was certified 6× platinum by Music Canada in October 2001.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, as Metacritic gave it a 49 out of 100. AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, &quot;Durst&#x27;s self-pitying and the monotonous music give away that the band bashed Chocolate Starfish out very quickly – it&#x27;s the sound of a band determined to deliver a sequel in a finite amount of time.&quot; &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; awarded the album three out of five stars, whereas the magazine itself gave the album a 3.5 out of 5. Readers of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; voted it as the worst album of 2000, with the band and Fred Durst also being voted the worst band of 2000 and &quot;Arse of the Year&quot;, respectively.

Even so, &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot; was listed in the book for &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, but later removed in recent editions of the book.

In 2020, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 2000 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine.

<text>Karl Jatho (; 3 February 1873 – 8 December 1933) was a German inventor and aviation pioneer, performer and public servant of the city of Hanover.

== Achievements and claims to precedence over the Wright brothers ==

From August through November 1903, Jatho made progressively longer hops (flights) in a pusher triplane, and then a biplane, at outside of Hanover. His first flight was only distance at about altitude. Sources differ whether his aircraft was controlled. The earliest contemporary source suggesting that it was controlled, a newspaper article from dating 1 August 1907, states that Jatho &quot;has been working on controllable air vehicles for 12 years by now&quot;, however a legal document dated 19 November 1902 (an official decline by legal authorities to attend a legal test examination that Jatho had offered to them) appears to describe a design that still lacked a controlling mechanism. 30 years after his first flight tests, four eyewitnesses gave a legal testimony certified by a civil law notary in 1933 to having observed his August 1903 flight and that the given data was correct.

According to local historian quoting from Jatho&#x27;s notes as well as NDR Fernsehen journalist Gunter Hartung, by November 1903 Jatho had managed to achieve a continuous flight of at altitude, a month prior to the 17 December 1903 pioneer flights of the Wright brothers spanning distances of at about altitude.

Jatho eventually gave up, noting &quot;In spite of many efforts, (I) cannot make longer or higher flights. Motor weak.&quot; With a later machine, Jatho would make successful flights in 1909: at about altitude. He also founded a flying school and an aircraft factory, but did not have much success.

== Later assessments of claims and recreation attempts ==

Although in Germany some enthusiasts credit him with making the first airplane flight, according to modern researchers such as Leonhardt and Lohmann (interviewed for the 2006 NDR Fernsehen documentary &quot;Sorry Mister Wright&quot; and the 2009 documentary &quot;Made in Hannover – German Aviation Pioneer Karl Jatho took off ahead of Orville Wright&quot;), Jatho&#x27;s personal claim to a place in the history books of aviation on grounds of significant pioneer motorized flights of in August and in November 1903 prior to the Brothers Wright is tarnished by the fact that he took 30 years to have it legally certified by original eyewitness accounts.

In the summer of 1933, Jatho&#x27;s former assistant Werner Hegge attempted to give practical proof by a flight demonstration with an exact replica of Jatho&#x27;s original machine, but according to the 9 October 1933 issue of the local &quot;Hannoversche Kurier&quot; newspaper, the weather did not allow for a safe start on the scheduled date. From 1936 onwards, Hegge&#x27;s replica became a public exhibit at the where it was destroyed during WWII.

In September 2006, a local initiative of aviation history researchers and replica builders led by Harald Lohmann attempted another recreation with a new replica in order to bolster credence to Jatho&#x27;s original claims, but again, adverse weather conditions prevented a successful start, although the replica did achieve successful ground speed that in theory would have allowed for a lift off had it not been for the strong winds on the day of the test. The team decided to wait for better weather conditions, but the legal owner of their replica, Flughafen Hannover-Langenhagen GmbH (owner of Hannover Airport where their test had taken place) that had sponsored the building of the replica, did not allow for further tests, as the airport owner instead preferred to make it a permanent exhibit at its World of Aviation () exhibition located at the airport.

<doc id="349458" wikidata="Q134164" url="?curid=349458" title="Simplex algorithm">
<text>In mathematical optimization, Dantzig&#x27;s simplex algorithm (or simplex method) is a popular algorithm for linear programming.

The name of the algorithm is derived from the concept of a simplex and was suggested by T. S. Motzkin. Simplices are not actually used in the method, but one interpretation of it is that it operates on simplicial &quot;cones&quot;, and these become proper simplices with an additional constraint. The simplicial cones in question are the corners (i.e., the neighborhoods of the vertices) of a geometric object called a polytope. The shape of this polytope is defined by the constraints applied to the objective function.

==History==
George Dantzig worked on planning methods for the US Army Air Force during World War II using a desk calculator. During 1946, his colleague challenged him to mechanize the planning process to distract him from taking another job. Dantzig formulated the problem as linear inequalities inspired by the work of Wassily Leontief, however, at that time he didn&#x27;t include an objective as part of his formulation. Without an objective, a vast number of solutions can be feasible, and therefore to find the &quot;best&quot; feasible solution, military-specified &quot;ground rules&quot; must be used that describe how goals can be achieved as opposed to specifying a goal itself. Dantzig&#x27;s core insight was to realize that most such ground rules can be translated into a linear objective function that needs to be maximized. Development of the simplex method was evolutionary and happened over a period of about a year.

After Dantzig included an objective function as part of his formulation during mid-1947, the problem was mathematically more tractable. Dantzig realized that one of the unsolved problems that he had mistaken as homework in his professor Jerzy Neyman&#x27;s class (and actually later solved), was applicable to finding an algorithm for linear programs. This problem involved finding the existence of Lagrange multipliers for general linear programs over a continuum of variables, each bounded between zero and one, and satisfying linear constraints expressed in the form of Lebesgue integrals. Dantzig later published his &quot;homework&quot; as a thesis to earn his doctorate. The column geometry used in this thesis gave Dantzig insight that made him believe that the Simplex method would be very efficient.

==Overview==

The simplex algorithm operates on linear programs in the canonical form

:maximize formula_1
:subject to formula_2 and formula_3

with formula_4 the coefficients of the objective function, formula_5 is the matrix transpose, and formula_6 are the variables of the problem, formula_7 is a &quot;p&quot;×&quot;n&quot; matrix, and formula_8. There is a straightforward process to convert any linear program into one in standard form, so using this form of linear programs results in no loss of generality.

In geometric terms, the feasible region defined by all values of formula_9 such that formula_10 and formula_11 is a (possibly unbounded) convex polytope. An extreme point or vertex of this polytope is known as &quot;basic feasible solution&quot; (BFS).

It can be shown that for a linear program in standard form, if the objective function has a maximum value on the feasible region, then it has this value on (at least) one of the extreme points. This in itself reduces the problem to a finite computation since there is a finite number of extreme points, but the number of extreme points is unmanageably large for all but the smallest linear programs.
It can also be shown that, if an extreme point is not a maximum point of the objective function, then there is an edge containing the point so that the value of the objective function is strictly increasing on the edge moving away from the point. If the edge is finite, then the edge connects to another extreme point where the objective function has a greater value, otherwise the objective function is unbounded above on the edge and the linear program has no solution. The simplex algorithm applies this insight by walking along edges of the polytope to extreme points with greater and greater objective values. This continues until the maximum value is reached, or an unbounded edge is visited (concluding that the problem has no solution). The algorithm always terminates because the number of vertices in the polytope is finite; moreover since we jump between vertices always in the same direction (that of the objective function), we hope that the number of vertices visited will be small.

The solution of a linear program is accomplished in two steps. In the first step, known as Phase I, a starting extreme point is found. Depending on the nature of the program this may be trivial, but in general it can be solved by applying the simplex algorithm to a modified version of the original program. The possible results of Phase I are either that a basic feasible solution is found or that the feasible region is empty. In the latter case the linear program is called &quot;infeasible&quot;. In the second step, Phase II, the simplex algorithm is applied using the basic feasible solution found in Phase I as a starting point. The possible results from Phase II are either an optimum basic feasible solution or an infinite edge on which the objective function is unbounded above.

==Standard form==
The transformation of a linear program to one in standard form may be accomplished as follows. First, for each variable with a lower bound other than 0, a new variable is introduced representing the difference between the variable and bound. The original variable can then be eliminated by substitution. For example, given the constraint
:formula_12

a new variable, formula_13, is introduced with 
:formula_14

The second equation may be used to eliminate formula_15 from the linear program. In this way, all lower bound constraints may be changed to non-negativity restrictions.

Second, for each remaining inequality constraint, a new variable, called a &quot;slack variable&quot;, is introduced to change the constraint to an equality constraint. This variable represents the difference between the two sides of the inequality and is assumed to be non-negative. For example, the inequalities
:formula_16

are replaced with
:formula_17

It is much easier to perform algebraic manipulation on inequalities in this form. In inequalities where ≥ appears such as the second one, some authors refer to the variable introduced as a &quot; surplus variable&quot;.

Third, each unrestricted variable is eliminated from the linear program. This can be done in two ways, one is by solving for the variable in one of the equations in which it appears and then eliminating the variable by substitution. The other is to replace the variable with the difference of two restricted variables. For example, if formula_18 is unrestricted then write
:formula_19

The equation may be used to eliminate formula_18 from the linear program.

When this process is complete the feasible region will be in the form
:formula_21

It is also useful to assume that the rank of formula_22 is the number of rows. This results in no loss of generality since otherwise either the system formula_23 has redundant equations which can be dropped, or the system is inconsistent and the linear program has no solution.

==Simplex tableau==
A linear program in standard form can be represented as a &quot;tableau&quot; of the form 
:formula_24

The first row defines the objective function and the remaining rows specify the constraints. The zero in the first column represents the zero vector of the same dimension as the vector formula_25 (different authors use different conventions as to the exact layout). If the columns of formula_22 can be rearranged so that it contains the identity matrix of order formula_27 (the number of rows in formula_22) then the tableau is said to be in &quot;canonical form&quot;. The variables corresponding to the columns of the identity matrix are called &quot;basic variables&quot; while the remaining variables are called &quot;nonbasic&quot; or &quot;free variables&quot;. If the values of the nonbasic variables are set to 0, then the values of the basic variables are easily obtained as entries in formula_25 and this solution is a basic feasible solution. The algebraic interpretation here is that the coefficients of the linear equation represented by each row are either formula_30, formula_31, or some other number. Each row will have formula_31 column with value formula_31, formula_34 columns with coefficients formula_30, and the remaining columns with some other coefficients (these other variables represent our non-basic variables). By setting the values of the non-basic variables to zero we ensure in each row that the value of the variable represented by a formula_31 in its column is equal to the formula_37 value at that row.

Conversely, given a basic feasible solution, the columns corresponding to the nonzero variables can be expanded to a nonsingular matrix. If the corresponding tableau is multiplied by the inverse of this matrix then the result is a tableau in canonical form.

Let 
:formula_38

be a tableau in canonical form. Additional row-addition transformations can be applied to remove the coefficients from the objective function. This process is called &quot;pricing out&quot; and results in a canonical tableau
:formula_39

where &quot;z&quot;&quot;B&quot; is the value of the objective function at the corresponding basic feasible solution. The updated coefficients, also known as &quot;relative cost coefficients&quot;, are the rates of change of the objective function with respect to the nonbasic variables.

==Pivot operations==
The geometrical operation of moving from a basic feasible solution to an adjacent basic feasible solution is implemented as a &quot;pivot operation&quot;. First, a nonzero &quot;pivot element&quot; is selected in a nonbasic column. The row containing this element is multiplied by its reciprocal to change this element to 1, and then multiples of the row are added to the other rows to change the other entries in the column to 0. The result is that, if the pivot element is in a row &quot;r&quot;, then the column becomes the &quot;r&quot;-th column of the identity matrix. The variable for this column is now a basic variable, replacing the variable which corresponded to the &quot;r&quot;-th column of the identity matrix before the operation. In effect, the variable corresponding to the pivot column enters the set of basic variables and is called the &quot;entering variable&quot;, and the variable being replaced leaves the set of basic variables and is called the &quot;leaving variable&quot;. The tableau is still in canonical form but with the set of basic variables changed by one element.

==Algorithm==
Let a linear program be given by a canonical tableau. The simplex algorithm proceeds by performing successive pivot operations each of which give an improved basic feasible solution; the choice of pivot element at each step is largely determined by the requirement that this pivot improves the solution.

===Entering variable selection===
Since the entering variable will, in general, increase from 0 to a positive number, the value of the objective function will decrease if the derivative of the objective function with respect to this variable is negative. Equivalently, the value of the objective function is increased if the pivot column is selected so that the corresponding entry in the objective row of the tableau is positive.

If there is more than one column so that the entry in the objective row is positive then the choice of which one to add to the set of basic variables is somewhat arbitrary and several &quot;entering variable choice rules&quot; such as Devex algorithm have been developed.

If all the entries in the objective row are less than or equal to 0 then no choice of entering variable can be made and the solution is in fact optimal. It is easily seen to be optimal since the objective row now corresponds to an equation of the form 
:formula_40

By changing the entering variable choice rule so that it selects a column where the entry in the objective row is negative, the algorithm is changed so that it finds the minimum of the objective function rather than the maximum.

===Leaving variable selection===
Once the pivot column has been selected, the choice of pivot row is largely determined by the requirement that the resulting solution be feasible. First, only positive entries in the pivot column are considered since this guarantees that the value of the entering variable will be nonnegative. If there are no positive entries in the pivot column then the entering variable can take any non-negative value with the solution remaining feasible. In this case the objective function is unbounded below and there is no minimum.

Next, the pivot row must be selected so that all the other basic variables remain positive. A calculation shows that this occurs when the resulting value of the entering variable is at a minimum. In other words, if the pivot column is &quot;c&quot;, then the pivot row &quot;r&quot; is chosen so that
:formula_41

is the minimum over all &quot;r&quot; so that &quot;a&quot;&quot;rc&quot; &gt; 0. This is called the &quot;minimum ratio test&quot;. If there is more than one row for which the minimum is achieved then a &quot;dropping variable choice rule&quot; can be used to make the determination.

===Example===

Consider the linear program
:Minimize
::formula_42
:Subject to
::formula_43

With the addition of slack variables &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot;, this is represented by the canonical tableau
:formula_44

where columns 5 and 6 represent the basic variables &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot; and the corresponding basic feasible solution is 
:formula_45

Columns 2, 3, and 4 can be selected as pivot columns, for this example column 4 is selected. The values of &quot;z&quot; resulting from the choice of rows 2 and 3 as pivot rows are 10/1 = 10 and 15/3 = 5 respectively. Of these the minimum is 5, so row 3 must be the pivot row. Performing the pivot produces
:formula_46

Now columns 4 and 5 represent the basic variables &quot;z&quot; and &quot;s&quot; and the corresponding basic feasible solution is 
:formula_47

For the next step, there are no positive entries in the objective row and in fact
:formula_48
so the minimum value of &quot;Z&quot; is −20.

==Finding an initial canonical tableau==
In general, a linear program will not be given in the canonical form and an equivalent canonical tableau must be found before the simplex algorithm can start. This can be accomplished by the introduction of &quot;artificial variables&quot;. Columns of the identity matrix are added as column vectors for these variables. If the b value for a constraint equation is negative, the equation is negated before adding the identity matrix columns. This does not change the set of feasible solutions or the optimal solution, and it ensures that the slack variables will constitute an initial feasible solution. The new tableau is in canonical form but it is not equivalent to the original problem. So a new objective function, equal to the sum of the artificial variables, is introduced and the simplex algorithm is applied to find the minimum; the modified linear program is called the &quot;Phase I&quot; problem.

The simplex algorithm applied to the Phase I problem must terminate with a minimum value for the new objective function since, being the sum of nonnegative variables, its value is bounded below by 0. If the minimum is 0 then the artificial variables can be eliminated from the resulting canonical tableau producing a canonical tableau equivalent to the original problem. The simplex algorithm can then be applied to find the solution; this step is called &quot;Phase II&quot;. If the minimum is positive then there is no feasible solution for the Phase I problem where the artificial variables are all zero. This implies that the feasible region for the original problem is empty, and so the original problem has no solution.

===Example===
Consider the linear program
:Minimize
::formula_42

:Subject to
::formula_50

This is represented by the (non-canonical) tableau
:formula_51

Introduce artificial variables &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; and objective function &quot;W&quot; = &quot;u&quot; + &quot;v&quot;, giving a new tableau
:formula_52

The equation defining the original objective function is retained in anticipation of Phase II.

By construction, &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are both basic variables since they are part of the initial identity matrix. However, the objective function &quot;W&quot; currently assumes that &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are both 0. In order to adjust the objective function to be the correct value where &quot;u&quot; = 10 and &quot;v&quot; = 15, add the third and fourth rows to the first row giving
:formula_53

Select column 5 as a pivot column, so the pivot row must be row 4, and the updated tableau is 
:formula_54

Now select column 3 as a pivot column, for which row 3 must be the pivot row, to get
:formula_55

The artificial variables are now 0 and they may be dropped giving a canonical tableau equivalent to the original problem:
:formula_56

This is, fortuitously, already optimal and the optimum value for the original linear program is −130/7.

==Advanced topics==

===Implementation===

The tableau form used above to describe the algorithm lends itself to an immediate implementation in which the tableau is maintained as a rectangular (&quot;m&quot; + 1)-by-(&quot;m&quot; + &quot;n&quot; + 1) array. It is straightforward to avoid storing the m explicit columns of the identity matrix that will occur within the tableau by virtue of B being a subset of the columns of [A, I]. This implementation is referred to as the &quot;&quot;standard&quot; simplex algorithm&quot;. The storage and computation overhead is such that the standard simplex method is a prohibitively expensive approach to solving large linear programming problems.

In each simplex iteration, the only data required are the first row of the tableau, the (pivotal) column of the tableau corresponding to the entering variable and the right-hand-side. The latter can be updated using the pivotal column and the first row of the tableau can be updated using the (pivotal) row corresponding to the leaving variable. Both the pivotal column and pivotal row may be computed directly using the solutions of linear systems of equations involving the matrix B and a matrix-vector product using A. These observations motivate the &quot;&quot;revised&quot; simplex algorithm&quot;, for which implementations are distinguished by their invertible representation of B.

In large linear-programming problems A is typically a sparse matrix and, when the resulting sparsity of B is exploited when maintaining its invertible representation, the revised simplex algorithm is much more efficient than the standard simplex method. Commercial simplex solvers are based on the revised simplex algorithm.

===Degeneracy: stalling and cycling===
If the values of all basic variables are strictly positive, then a pivot must result in an improvement in the objective value. When this is always the case no set of basic variables occurs twice and the simplex algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps. Basic feasible solutions where at least one of the &quot;basic &quot;variables is zero are called &quot;degenerate&quot; and may result in pivots for which there is no improvement in the objective value. In this case there is no actual change in the solution but only a change in the set of basic variables. When several such pivots occur in succession, there is no improvement; in large industrial applications, degeneracy is common and such &quot;stalling&quot; is notable. 
Worse than stalling is the possibility the same set of basic variables occurs twice, in which case, the deterministic pivoting rules of the simplex algorithm will produce an infinite loop, or &quot;cycle&quot;. While degeneracy is the rule in practice and stalling is common, cycling is rare in practice. A discussion of an example of practical cycling occurs in Padberg. Bland&#x27;s rule prevents cycling and thus guarantees that the simplex algorithm always terminates. Another pivoting algorithm, the criss-cross algorithm never cycles on linear programs.

History-based pivot rules such as Zadeh&#x27;s rule and Cunningham&#x27;s rule also try to circumvent the issue of stalling and cycling by keeping track of how often particular variables are being used and then favor such variables that have been used least often.

===Efficiency in the worst case===
The simplex method is remarkably efficient in practice and was a great improvement over earlier methods such as Fourier–Motzkin elimination. However, in 1972, Klee and Minty gave an example, the Klee–Minty cube, showing that the worst-case complexity of simplex method as formulated by Dantzig is exponential time. Since then, for almost every variation on the method, it has been shown that there is a family of linear programs for which it performs badly. It is an open question if there is a variation with polynomial time, although sub-exponential pivot rules are known.

In 2014, it was proved that a particular variant of the simplex method is NP-mighty, i.e., it can be used to solve, with polynomial overhead, any problem in NP implicitly during the algorithm&#x27;s execution. Moreover, deciding whether a given variable ever enters the basis during the algorithm&#x27;s execution on a given input, and determining the number of iterations needed for solving a given problem, are both NP-hard problems. At about the same time it was shown that there exists an artificial pivot rule for which computing its output is PSPACE-complete. In 2015, this was strengthened to show that computing the output of Dantzig&#x27;s pivot rule is PSPACE-complete.

===Efficiency in practice===
Analyzing and quantifying the observation that the simplex algorithm is efficient in practice despite its exponential worst-case complexity has led to the development of other measures of complexity. The simplex algorithm has polynomial-time average-case complexity under various probability distributions, with the precise average-case performance of the simplex algorithm depending on the choice of a probability distribution for the random matrices. Another approach to studying &quot;typical phenomena&quot; uses Baire category theory from general topology, and to show that (topologically) &quot;most&quot; matrices can be solved by the simplex algorithm in a polynomial number of steps.

Another method to analyze the performance of the simplex algorithm studies the behavior of worst-case scenarios under small perturbation – are worst-case scenarios stable under a small change (in the sense of structural stability), or do they become tractable? This area of research, called smoothed analysis, was introduced specifically to study the simplex method. Indeed, the running time of the simplex method on input with noise is polynomial in the number of variables and the magnitude of the perturbations.

==Other algorithms==
Other algorithms for solving linear-programming problems are described in the linear-programming article. Another basis-exchange pivoting algorithm is the criss-cross algorithm. There are polynomial-time algorithms for linear programming that use interior point methods: these include Khachiyan&#x27;s ellipsoidal algorithm, Karmarkar&#x27;s projective algorithm, and path-following algorithms. The Big-M method is an alternative strategy for solving a linear program, using a single-phase simplex.

==Linear-fractional programming==

Linear–fractional programming (LFP) is a generalization of linear programming (LP). In LP the objective function is a linear function, while the objective function of a linear–fractional program is a ratio of two linear functions. In other words, a linear program is a fractional–linear program in which the denominator is the constant function having the value one everywhere. A linear–fractional program can be solved by a variant of the simplex algorithm or by the criss-cross algorithm.

<text>Brazilian Silicon Valley is a term commonly applied to the region of Campinas and in southern region this term is applied for Florianópolis city, Brazil because of its similarity to the &#x27;original&#x27; Silicon Valley, located in California in the USA.

==Characteristics==

Campinas has gained this distinction because it has several comparable features, such as:

*It is a modern city, located near a giant metropolis, São Paulo
*It has a vibrant, high-tech university and research environment, composed of the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), the Pontificial Catholic University of Campinas (PUCCAMP), the FACAMP, the UNISAL (Centro Universitário Salesiano de São Paulo), the Center for Research and Development in Telecommunications (CPqD), the National Laboratory of Synchrotron Light, the Renato Archer Research Institute (CenPRA), the Brazilian Company of Agricultural Research (EMBRAPA), the Agronomical Institute of Campinas, the Biological Institute, the Food Technology Institute, the Eldorado Institute, the Wherner von Braun Institute and several others. Campinas boasts a researcher/population ratio equal to those of the most advanced technology centers.
*A number of high-tech, non-pollutant electrical and electronics industries have settled around Campinas, such as IBM, Lucent, Samsung, Nortel, Compaq, Freescale Semiconductor, Motorola, Dell, Fairchild Semiconductor, Huawei, 3M, Texas Instruments, Celestica, Solectron, and Bosch.
*Several industrial parks and incubators for high tech companies in the fields of microelectronics, computers, software, telecommunications, etc. have developed there.

==History==
Until the 1970s, the Campinas region had few industries and had an economy based on agriculture and in the services and commerce sectors. With the foundation of UNICAMP and the ready availability of high-quality researchers, engineers and students focused on physics, electrical engineering, computer sciences, mathematics, mechanical engineering, etc., a number of high-tech companies started to establish their industrial plants and R&amp;D labs nearby, such as IBM. The municipality of Campinas and those surrounding it began to foster actively the growth of this new area, and the CIATEC I and II (Companhia de Desenvolvimento do Pólo de Alta Tecnologia de Campinas) industrial zones were established around the university campus, in the subdistrict of Barão Geraldo. The Center for Research and Development (CPqD) set up by Telebras, a state holding for the telecommunications industry in Brazil, which had grown enormously under the military regime umbrella, was the second boost to Campinas Silicon Valley. A law was passed by the Federal government, protecting Brazilian-made technology against imports, and this resulted in further growth. Together with UNICAMP researchers a number of pioneering developments occurred in the brand-new areas of lasers, fiber optics, digital telephony, computer technology, software development, and so on. In addition, the Petrobras state-owned oil giant was starting to develop a long range oil exploration program with the aim of making Brazil independent of oil imports, a policy also started by the military for strategic and economic reasons (the oil shock had deeply affected the country), and UNICAMP was one of the leading research universities to participate. In this respect, UNICAMP&#x27;s open philosophy of collaboration with the private sector (unheard of in Brazil until that time), established by his visionary founder and first rector, Dr. Zeferino Vaz, prepared the way for a unique synergy between industry and university.

==Other areas==
Other areas in Brazil are also claiming a similar status to Campinas Silicon Valley, although they are much less organized and with smaller companies. They are:
* Araraquara and São Carlos, State of São Paulo, with a high technology industries and University of São Paulo - USP, Federal University of São Carlos - UFSCar and Universidade Estadual Paulista Júlio de Mesquita Filho - UNESP.
* Recife, state of Pernambuco, with a budding Digital Port and many collaborative ties with the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco
* The Vale do Sapucaí in Minas Gerais, with several cities (such as Santa Rita do Sapucai) where collaboration between high-tech industries and universities (such as INATEL) is generally recognized as one of the best examples of a nascent Silicon Valley.
* Belo Horizonte, state of Minas Gerais, not properly a Silicon Valley because it has mostly a software industry, but the upcoming BHTec along with possible semiconductor industry developments in its metropolitan area (specifically, in Confins) could change this situation.
* Florianópolis, state of Santa Catarina, also has mostly a software industry.
* The cities of Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Curitiba, Blumenau and Londrina, all in the Southeast and South, have also a strongly developed digital economy.

<text>Star Channel is a Greek free-to-air television channel that broadcasts a mix of foreign and Greek shows. It was launched in December 1993 and is owned by New Television S.A. (a company owned by Giannis Vardinogiannis).

Star Channel is known in Greece mostly for its programming style, both in terms of live shows and news content, with an increased focus on lifestyle, showbiz, gossip, and fashion news, and on &quot;comedic&quot; presentation.

In 2013, Star started combining information with entertainment, resulting in the channel&#x27;s shift to a more serious tone. Star Channel generated €64 million in net profit in 2014 which represents a 32.2% increase from the previous year.

==History==
Star Channel was launched on 4 December 1993 to compete with Mega, ANT1, Alpha TV and ERT Channels. It began broadcasting children&#x27;s programs as well as foreign series. In 1994 – Star Channel began to exchange family/children&#x27;s programs from Alpha, then known as Skai (Greek spelling of Sky) with Star&#x27;s children&#x27;s programming. Star Channel made its international debut in 2005, joining the UBI World TV platform, which made Star available to viewers in Australia as well as in Asia and Africa. UBI World TV launched in New Zealand in 2008 making Star International available there.

In March 2011, Star Channel began showing some of its programs in 16:9 – mostly television series and films – and as of April, it switched to 16:9 for all its programming, including its own shows and news broadcasts.

In March 2016, Star Channel started its pilot broadcast of STAR HD (1080i) through Digea in Attica and Central Macedonia on 27 February 2016.

==Star International==
Star International was launched in November 2005 and airs the &quot;best of&quot; Star Channel programming to Greeks in the Asia Pacific region, Africa and North America.

Star International is currently available to viewers in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Asia through TV Plus; it operates on a 24-hour schedule.

In October 2009, Star International officially launched in North America, available exclusively on RCN Cable in the United States but in June 2010, RCN Cable dropped the channel due to the low number of subscriptions.

In May 2011, Star International re-launched in the US and was made available via satellite on the Home2US platform. In late 2012, Home2US ceased operations. The channel is currently available in North America through IPTV provider Ellas TV.

On 23 September 2014, Star International launched in Canada via Bell Fibe TV.

On 10 December 2020, Star International launched on Bell Satellite TV, making the channel available across Canada.

<doc id="349463" wikidata="Q336010" url="?curid=349463" title="Charles Nodier">
<text>Jean Charles Emmanuel Nodier (; 29 April 1780 – 27 January 1844) was a French author and librarian who introduced a younger generation of Romanticists to the &quot;conte fantastique&quot;, gothic literature, and vampire tales. His dream related writings influenced the later works of Gérard de Nerval.
==Early years==
He was born at Besançon in France, near the border with Switzerland. His father, on the outbreak of the French Revolution, was appointed mayor of Besançon and consequently chief police magistrate, and seems to have become an instrument of the tyranny of the Jacobins without sharing their principles. But his son was for a time an ardent citizen, and is said to have been a Jacobin Club member at the age of twelve. In 1793 Charles saved the life of a lady guilty of sending money to an &quot;émigré&quot;, declaring to his father that if she were condemned he would take his own life. He was sent to Strasbourg, where he studied with Eulogius Schneider, the notorious Jacobin and public prosecutor of Alsace, but a good Greek scholar.

==Activism and wanderings==
During the Reign of Terror his father put him under the care of Justin Girod-Chantrans, with whom he studied English and German. His love of books began very early, and he combined with it a strong interest in nature, which Girod-Chantrans was able to foster. He became librarian in his native town, but his exertions in the cause of suspected persons brought him under suspicion. An inspection of his papers by the police, however, revealed nothing more dangerous than a dissertation on the antennae of insects. Entomology continued to be a favourite study with him, but he varied it with philology and pure literature and even political writing. For a skit on Napoleon, in 1803, he was imprisoned for some months.

He then left Paris, where he had gone after losing his position at Besançon, and for some years lived a very unsettled life at Besançon, Dole, and in other places in the Jura. During these wanderings he wrote his novel, &quot;Le peintre de Salzbourg, journal des émotions d&#x27;un coeur souffrant, suivi des Meditations du cloître&quot; (1803). The hero, Charles, who is a variation of the Werther type, desires the restoration of the monasteries, to afford a refuge from the woes of the world. At Dole, on 31 August 1808, he married Désirée Charve. Their only daughter Marie-Antoinette-Élisabeth Mennessier-Nodier (1811 – 1893) became a noted woman of letters. Nodier was working as a secretary to the elderly Sir Herbert Croft, 5th Baronet and his platonic friend Lady Mary Hamilton. During this time he translated Hamilton&#x27;s book &quot;Munster Village&quot; and helped her write &quot;La famille du duc de Popoli&quot; or &quot;The Duc de Popoli&quot; which was published in 1810.

In December 1812 Nodier moved to Ljubljana, then the capital of the newly established French Illyrian Provinces, and was in 1813 the last editor of a multilingual newspaper, the &quot;Official Telegraph of the Illyrian Provinces&quot; (&quot;Télégraphe officiel des Provinces Illyriennes&quot;) published in French, German and Italian. It was there that Nodier composed, in 1812, the first draft of his novel &quot;Jean Sbogar&quot;. The story about a love between a brigand and a daughter of a rich merchant was finally published in 1818. After the evacuation of French forces from the Illyrian provinces in 1813 he returned to Paris, and the Restauration found him a royalist, though he retained something of republican sentiment. In 1824 he was appointed librarian of the Bibliothèque de l&#x27;Arsenal, a position that he kept for the rest of his life. He was elected a member of the Académie française in 1833, also of the Société Entomologique de France when this was formed in 1832, and he was made a member of the Legion of Honour. He died, aged, 63, in Paris.

The twenty years at the Arsenal were the most important and fruitful of Nodier&#x27;s career. He had the advantage of a settled home in which to collect and study rare and unusual books; and he was able to establish a celebrated literary salon, known as Le Cénacle, rallying a knot of young literary men to romanticism (the so-called Romanticists of 1830), some of whom would achieve great renown themselves. Victor Hugo, Alfred de Musset and Sainte-Beuve all acknowledged their obligations to him, and Alexandre Dumas incorporated his recollections of Nodier into his novelette &quot;La Dame au Collier de Velours&quot;. The group included Alphonse de Lamartine, Gérard de Nerval, and Louise Crombach. Nodier was a passionate admirer of Goethe, Laurence Sterne and Shakespeare, and himself contributed to the literature that was one of the leading traits of the Romantic school.

==Works==
His best and most characteristic work, which is exquisite in its kind, consists partly of short tales of a more or less fantastic character, partly of nondescript articles, half bibliographic, half narrative, the nearest analogue to which in English is to be found in some of the papers of Thomas De Quincey. The best examples of the latter are to be found in the volume entitled &quot;Mélanges tirés d&#x27;une petite bibliothèque&quot;, published in 1829 and afterwards continued. Of his tales the best are &quot;Infernaliana&quot; (1822); &quot;Smarra, ou les démons de la nuit&quot; (1821); &quot;Trilby, ou le lutin d&#x27;Argail&quot; (1822); &quot;Histoire du roi de Bohême et de ses sept châteaux&quot; (1830); &quot;La Fée aux miettes&quot; (1832); &quot;Inès de las Sierras&quot; (1837); &quot;Les quatre talismans et la légende de soeur Béatrix&quot; (1838), together with some fairy stories published in the year of his death, and &quot;Franciscus Columna&quot;, which appeared after it. The &quot;Souvenirs de jeunesse&quot; (1832) are interesting but untrustworthy , and the &quot;Dictionnaire universel de la langue française&quot; (1823), which, in the days before Littré, was one of the most useful of its kind, is said to have been not wholly or mainly Nodier&#x27;s . There was a so-called collection of &quot;Œuvres complêtes&quot; published in 12 vols. in 1832, but at that time much of the author&#x27;s best work had not yet appeared, and it included but a part of what was previously published. Nodier found an indulgent biographer in Prosper Mérimée on the occasion of the younger man&#x27;s admission to the academy.

During the 1820s, after adapting Dr. John William Polidori&#x27;s short story &quot;The Vampyre&quot; successfully for the stage in France (&quot;Le Vampire&quot;, 1820), Nodier involved himself in the theatre for a few years. Among these works were &quot;Bertram ou le Pirate&quot; (1822), based on a play by Charles Maturin in England (&quot;Bertam, or The Castle of St. Aldobrand&quot;), and &quot;Le Monstre et le Magicien&quot; (1826), which adapted an English play based on Mary Shelley&#x27;s novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Nodier also translated and adapted an Italian play by Carmillo Frederici (&quot;Le Delateur&quot;-&quot;The Informer&quot;) in 1821. Despite the success of these works, he lost interest in the theatre, and by the late eighteen twenties devoted himself entirely to literature, mostly to the conte fantastique.

An account of his share in the Romantic movement is to be found in Georg Brandes&#x27;s &quot;Main Currents in Nineteenth Century Literature&quot;. Nodier&#x27;s &quot;Description raisonnée d&#x27;une jolie collection de livres&quot; (1844), which is a catalogue of the books in his library, contains a life by Francis Wey and a complete bibliography of his numerous works. See also Sainte-Beuve, &quot;Portraits littéraires&quot;, vol. ii.; Prosper Mérimée, &quot;Portraits historiques et littéraires&quot; (1874); and A Estignard, &quot;&quot; (1876), containing his letters to his childhood friend and fellow enthusiast in literature, Charles Weiss.

A collection of Nodier&#x27;s dream writings (&quot;De Quelques Phénomènes Du Sommeil&quot;) was published by Le Castor Astral in 1996.

==Musical adaptations of Nodier&#x27;s &quot;Trilby&quot;==
Nodier&#x27;s 1822 novella &quot;Trilby, ou le lutin d&#x27;Argail&quot;, provided the inspiration for the ballet &quot;La Sylphide&quot;, 1832, to a scenario devised by Adolphe Nourrit. In 1870, the novella was adapted for another ballet titled &quot;Trilby&quot; by the great choreographer Marius Petipa, balletmaster of the Tsar&#x27;s Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg, Russia.

The libretto of John Barnett&#x27;s 1834 opera &quot;The Mountain Sylph&quot; is also adapted from &quot;Trilby&quot;, via the ballet &quot;La Sylphide&quot;.

==Commemoration==
There are streets in France named after Charles Nodier, located in Montmartre Paris, Pantin, Reims and Besançon.

The centre of French science and culture in Ljubljana, established in December 1966, was in 1983 named the Charles Nodier French Cultural Centre (now the Charles Nodier French Institute). It is housed on the left bank of the Ljubljanica, between the Prešeren Square and the St. James&#x27; Bridge. From 1994 to 2008, the institute regularly published a bulletin titled &quot;Le Petit Nodier&quot;. Since 1985, a bronze bust of Nodier stands at the court of its building, work of Jakov Brdar, according to the plans by the architect Marjan Ocvirk. It is a vivid portrait with a sharp look and some traces of the Secession style.

* &quot;Dictionnaire Raisonné des Onomatopées Françaises&quot; (1808) – (&quot;Reasoned Dictionary of French Onomatopoeia&quot;) – a dictionary of words derived from the sound associated with the subject (e.g. Cuckoo). A high point of the author&#x27;s early years which was somewhat expanded in a new edition of the book in 1828.
* &quot;Questions de Littérature Légale&quot; (1812)
* &quot;Histoire des sociétés secrètes de l&#x27;armée : et des conspirations militaires qui ont eu pour objet la déstruction du gouvernement de Bonaparte.&quot; Paris : Gide fils, 1815. (Eds.) Nodier, Bazin, Didier, Lemare, Lombard; English trans. (2008) Cornerstone Book Publishers.
* &quot;Promenade de Dieppe aux Montagnes de l&#x27;Écosse&quot; (1821) – a book describing Nodier&#x27;s travels through Britain including Scotland. His experience of the Scottish landscape inspired two of his best known works: &quot;Trilby&quot; and &quot;La Fée aux Miettes&quot;, which were set in Scotland.
* &quot;Essai sur le Gaz Hydrogène et les Divers Modes d&#x27;Éclairage Artificiel&quot; (1823) – (&quot;An Essay on Hydrogen Gas and the Various Methods of Artificial Lighting&quot;).
* &quot;Dictionnaire Universal de la Langue Française&quot; (1823) – (&quot;Universal Dictionary of the French Language&quot;).

* &quot;Du Fantastique en Littérature&quot; (1830) – a full-length study of the weird or fantastic in literature.
* &quot;Bibliographie des Fous: De Quelques Livres Excentriques&quot; (1835) – (&quot;Bibliography of the Mad: Of Some Eccentric Books&quot;).

* &quot;Description Raisonnée d&#x27;une Jolie Collection de Livres&quot; (1844) – (&quot;Reasoned Description of a Beautiful Collection of Books&quot;).

===A contested novel===
* &quot;Lord Ruthwen, ou Les Vampires&quot; (1820) – a rambling vampire novel based on earlier sources, a description of which is given at the end of the book. The overall theme is in the form of a sequel to Dr. John William Polidori&#x27;s short story &quot;The Vampyre&quot;, and the material suggests that it may originally have been intended as a play. The title page of the first edition attributed publishing to the author of &quot;Jean Sbogar&quot; and authorship to the pseudonym &quot;C. B.&quot;, causing historians to speculate that the book was written by a contemporary vaudeville manager named Cyprien Bérard, with whom Nodier was associated. The sources for the stories suggest the knowledge of a librarian and a bibliophile, and the novel misspells the name Ruthven as occurred in the text of &quot;Promenade de Dieppe aux Montagnes de l&#x27;Écosse&quot;. There are features of Nodier&#x27;s &quot;Jean Sbogar&quot; and &quot;Les Tristes&quot; in the novel, but the writing is hurried and lacks the quality of Nodier&#x27;s other fictional works.

<text>The signal recognition particle (SRP) is an abundant, cytosolic, universally conserved ribonucleoprotein (protein-RNA complex) that recognizes and targets specific proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes and the plasma membrane in prokaryotes.

==History==
The function of SRP was discovered by the study of processed and unprocessed secretory proteins, particularly immunoglobulin light chains; and bovine preprolactin. Newly synthesized proteins in eukaryotes carry N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequences, which are bound by SRP when they emerge from the ribosome.

==Mechanism==
In eukaryotes, SRP binds to the signal sequence of a newly synthesized peptide as it emerges from the ribosome. This binding leads to the slowing of protein synthesis known as &quot;elongation arrest&quot;, a conserved function of SRP that facilitates the coupling of the protein translation and the protein translocation processes. SRP then targets this entire complex (the ribosome-nascent chain complex) to the protein-conducting channel, also known as the translocon, in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This occurs via the interaction and docking of SRP with its cognate SRP receptor that is located in close proximity to the translocon.

In eukaryotes there are three domains between SRP and its receptor that function in guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding and hydrolysis. These are located in two related subunits in the SRP receptor (SRα and SRβ) and the SRP protein SRP54 (known as Ffh in bacteria). The coordinated binding of GTP by SRP and the SRP receptor has been shown to be a prerequisite for the successful targeting of SRP to the SRP receptor.

Upon docking, the nascent peptide chain is inserted into the translocon channel where it enters into the ER. Protein synthesis resumes as SRP is released from the ribosome. The SRP-SRP receptor complex dissociates via GTP hydrolysis and the cycle of SRP-mediated protein translocation continues.

Once inside the ER, the signal sequence is cleaved from the core protein by signal peptidase. Signal sequences are therefore not a part of mature proteins.

==Composition and evolution==
Despite SRP function being analogous in all organisms, its composition varies greatly. The SRP54-SRP RNA core with GTPase activity is shared in all cellular life, but some subunit polypeptides are specific to eukaryotes.

==Autoantibodies and disease==
Anti-signal recognition particle antibodies are mainly associated with, but are not very specific for, polymyositis. For individuals with polymyositis, the presence of anti-SRP antibodies are associated with more prominent muscle weakness and atrophy.

<doc id="349470" wikidata="Q838974" url="?curid=349470" title="Variable-sweep wing">
<text>A variable-sweep wing, colloquially known as a &quot;swing wing&quot;, is an airplane wing, or set of wings, that may be modified during flight, swept back and then returned to its previous straight position. Because it allows the aircraft&#x27;s shape to be changed, it is a feature of a variable-geometry aircraft.

A straight wing is most efficient for low-speed flight, but for an aircraft designed for transonic or supersonic flight it is essential that the wing be swept. Most aircraft that travel at those speeds usually have wings (either swept wing or delta wing) with a fixed sweep angle. These are simple and efficient wing designs for high speed flight, but there are performance tradeoffs. One is that the stalling speed is increased, necessitating long runways (unless complex high-lift wing devices are built in). Another is that the aircraft&#x27;s fuel consumption during subsonic cruise is higher than that of an unswept wing. These tradeoffs are particularly acute for naval carrier-based aircraft. A variable-sweep wing allows the pilot to use the optimum sweep angle for the aircraft&#x27;s speed at the moment, whether slow or fast. The more efficient sweep angles available offset the weight and volume penalties imposed by the wing&#x27;s mechanical sweep mechanisms. Its greater complexity and cost make it practical mostly for military aircraft.

A number of aircraft, both experimental and production, were introduced between the 1940s and the 1970s. The majority of production aircraft to be furnished with variable-sweep wings have been strike-oriented aircraft, such as the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-27, Tupolev Tu-22M, and Panavia Tornado. The configuration was also used for a few fighter/interceptor aircraft, including the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23, Grumman F-14 Tomcat, and the Panavia Tornado ADV. From the 1980s onwards, the development of such aircraft were curtailed by advances in flight control technology and structural materials which have allowed designers to closely tailor the aerodynamics and structure of aircraft, removing the need for variable sweep angle to achieve the required performance; instead, wings are given computer-controlled flaps on both leading and trailing edges that increase or decrease the camber or chord of the wing automatically to adjust to the flight regime; this technique is another form of &quot;variable geometry&quot;.

==Characteristics==

===Variable sweep===
A straight, unswept wing experiences high drag as it approaches the speed of sound, due to the progressive buildup of sonic shockwaves. Sweeping the wing at an angle, whether backwards or forwards, delays their onset and reduces their overall drag. However it also reduces the overall span of a given wing, leading to poor cruise efficiency and high takeoff and landing speeds.

A fixed wing must be a compromise between these two requirements. Varying the sweep in flight allows it to be optimised for each phase of flight, offering a smaller aircraft with higher performance. However it has disadvantages which must be allowed for. As the wing sweeps its centre of lift moves with it. Some mechanism, such as a sliding wing root or larger tail stabiliser, must be incorporated to trim out the changes and maintain level flight. The added weight of the sweep and trim mechanisms eat into the performance gains, while their complexity adds to cost and maintenance.

By moving the wing pivots outboard and only sweeping part of the wing, the trim changes are reduced, but so too is the variation in span and accompanying operational flexibility.

===Wing controlled aerodyne===
British engineer Barnes Wallis developed a radical aircraft configuration for high-speed flight, which he regarded as distinct from the conventional fixed-wing aeroplane and called it the wing controlled aerodyne. His previous work on the stability of airships had impressed on him the high control forces that could be exerted on the body of an aircraft, through very small deflections. He conceived of a simple ichthyoid (fish-like) fuselage with a variable wing. No other control surfaces were needed. Subtle movements of the wings were able to induce the small deflections which controlled the direction of flight, while trim was maintained by adjusting the angle of sweep to compensate for the varying position of the centre of lift at different speeds.

For supersonic flight a delta-planform lifting body is more suitable than a simple ichthyoid. A conflict also arises between the wing sweep angle necessary for trim and the optimal angle for supersonic cruise. Wallis resolved this by moving mass, typically the engines, out to the wing tips and swivelling them as the wing swept in order to maintain the thrust line. In the asymmetric engine-out condition, the remaining engines could be swivelled to divert the thrust line closer to the centre of pressure and reduce the asymmetry to manageable levels.

===Asymmetric sweep===
It is not necessary to sweep the port and starboard wings in the same sense - one can be swept back and the other forward, as in the oblique wing.

Varying the sweep asymmetrically by small amounts was also fundamental to the principle of the wing controlled aerodyne.

==History==
===Origins===

The earliest use of variable sweep was to trim the aeroplane for level flight. The Westland-Hill Pterodactyl IV of 1931 was a tailless design whose lightly swept wings could vary their sweep through a small angle during flight. This allowed longitudinal trim in the absence of a separate horizontal stabiliser. The concept would later be incorporated in Barnes Wallis&#x27;s wing-controlled aerodyne.

During the Second World War, researchers in Nazi Germany discovered the advantages of the swept wing for transonic flight, and also its disadvantages at lower speeds. The Messerschmitt Me P.1101 was an experimental jet fighter which was, in part, developed to investigate the benefits of varying wing sweep. Its sweep angle mechanism, which could only be adjusted on the ground between three separate positions of 30, 40, and 45 degrees, was intended for testing only, and was unsuitable for combat operations. However, by Victory in Europe Day, the sole prototype was only 80 per cent complete.

===Development===
Following the end of the conflict, the partially complete P.1101 was recovered and transported to the United States, where it was studied in depth by Bell Aircraft. However, due to a lack of documentation as well as some structural damage sustained, Bell decided against completing the aircraft itself. Instead, a close copy, known as the Bell X-5, was constructed with wings that enabled the sweep angle to be altered mid-flight. As the wing swept back, the root also slid forwards, maintaining the centre of lift in a constant position. A variable-sweep wing of this sliding type was flown on the prototype Grumman XF10F Jaguar in 1952. However, flight testing of the F10F proved to be unacceptable, albeit for other factors such as a lack of engine power and considerable controllability issues.

During the late 1940s, British engineer L. E. Baynes started studying the variable sweep wing. He devised a method of varying the tail geometry as well in order to stabilise the centre of lift; no sliding mechanism was necessary, instead, the wing wake interacted with the variable tail to effect the necessary trim changes. During 1949 and 1951, Baynes filed patent applications associated with this work. While the design reached the physical modelling stage and was subject to a complete round of wind tunnel tests, the British Government failed to provide financial backing for the work, allegedly due to budget constraints at the time.

Independently from Baynes, British engineer Barnes Wallis was also developing a more radical variable-geometry concept, which he called the wing controlled aerodyne, to maximise the economy of high-speed flight. His first study was the Wild Goose project. Subsequently, Barnes devised the Swallow, a blended wing tailless aircraft, which was envisioned to be capable of making return flights between Europe and Australia within ten hours. Later on, the Swallow was increasingly viewed as a potential supersonic successor to the subsonic Vickers Valiant, one of the RAF&#x27;s V bombers. During the 1950s, several modes of the Swallow were subjected to promising tests, including a six-foot scale model, at speeds of up to Mach 2. However, in 1957, British government decided to withdraw backing from many aeronautical programs, including Wallis&#x27; work.

Despite this lack of backing, the Swallow attracted international attention for some time. During late 1958, research efforts were temporarily revived through cooperation with the Mutual Weapons Development Programme of NATO, under which all of Wallis&#x27; variable geometry research was shared with the Americans. According to aviation author James R. Hansen, American aerospace engineer John Stack was enthusiastic on the concept, as were numerous engineers at NASA; however, the United States Department of Defense was opposed to committing any resources to the project. Wallis collaborated with NASA&#x27;s Langley Laboratory on a design study for a variable-sweep fighter. Although it used the pivot mechanism he had developed, NASA also insisted on implementing a conventional horizontal stabiliser to ease the issues of trim and manoeuvrability. Although it was no longer the wing-controlled aerodyne that Wallis envisaged, it would prove a more practical solution than either his or Bell&#x27;s. Swallow research led to several new configurations, including the adoption of a compact folding tail section and canards.

Barnes&#x27; work inspired a number of further studies, including a wing controlled aerodyne in response to OR.346 for a supersonic STOL fighter-bomber, then as BAC two further submissions: the Type 583 to meet Naval ER.206 and Type 584 to meet NATO NBMR.3, both also being V/STOL requirements. In 1960, Maurice Brennan joined Folland Aircraft as its chief engineer and director; he soon set about harnessing his experience of variable-geometry wings. Accordingly, such a wing was combined with the firm&#x27;s Folland Gnat light fighter for two different concepts – one tailless and one using with a conventional tail – for a multipurpose fighter/strike/trainer, designated as the Fo. 147. It had a unique mechanism for wing sweep that combined tracks on the fuselage sides and the underside of the wings, which was actuated by hydraulically-driven ball screws positioned at the wing&#x27;s inner ends. The wings could be swept from 20 degrees to 70 degrees; at the 70-degree position, longitudinal control was maintained by wing tip-mounted elevons, while this was provided by a retractable canard arrangement when swept at the 20-degree position, using full auto-stabilisation. By providing trimming functionality via the canard, the necessity of a large tailplane was eliminated. The Fo. 147 was claimed to have been capable of speeds in excess of Mach 2, being limited only by the heat buildup generated by high speed flight. Ultimately, the concept would not be developed to the prototype stage while the RAF showed little interest in the prospective variable geometry trainer.

===Production===
During the 1960s, the first programmes to produce mass production variable-sweep aircraft commenced. In the United States, such a configuration for the TFX (Tactical Fighter Experimental) program, which resulted in the development of the General Dynamics F-111, a sizable twin-engined aircraft intended to perform multiple roles. The F-111 is the first production aircraft to feature a variable-geometry wing and it, along with other systems such as terrain following radar and turbofan engines outfitted with afterburners, were innovative technologies for the era.

Despite this head start in the field, development of the F-111 was protracted; flight testing of the F-111A model only ended in 1973. During 1968, cracks were discovered in the F-111&#x27;s wing attach points, the issue also has been attributed with the loss of an F-111 in the following year. Accordingly, the attach points were structurally redesigned and subject to intensive testing of both the design and manufacturing quality. The F-111B, intended for the US Navy, was cancelled in 1968 due the aircraft&#x27;s weight and performance issues, as well as its inadequacies for the service&#x27;s fighter requirements. Several variants, such as the FB-111A strategic bomber model, featured elongated wings to give a greater range and load-carrying capability. The F-111&#x27;s wing featured pivoting pylons (two under each wing) which automatically adjusted to the sweep angle. Subsequent swing-wing aircraft, such as the Panavia Tornado and Sukhoi Su-24, would also be similarly equipped.
In the Soviet Union, military planners had also formulated similar requirements, which led to TsAGI, the Soviet aerodynamics bureau, performing extensive studies into variable geometry wings. TsAGI evolved two distinct designs, differing mainly in the distance (expressed as a percentage of total wingspan) between the wing pivots. By adopting a wider spacing, this not only reduced the negative aerodynamic effects of changing wing sweep, but also provided a larger fixed wing section which could be used for landing gear or stores pylons. This could, in fact, be adapted to more-or-less existing airframes, which the Soviets accordingly did, such as with the Sukhoi Su-17 (based on the earlier swept wing Sukhoi Su-7). The limitation of the wide spacing, however, was that it reduced the benefits of variable geometry as much as it reduced their technical difficulties.

As such, producing new, &quot;clean-sheet&quot; Soviet designs remained desirable. For this, TsAGI devised a more narrowly-spaced arrangement somewhat similar to that of the F-111. This design was used, albeit at different scales, for the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter and the Sukhoi Su-24 tactical bomber, both of which flew in prototype forms around the end of the 1960s and entering service during the early 1970s. During 1962, Tupolev&#x27;s design team, recognising room for improvement on the recently introduced Tupolev Tu-22 bomber, begun work on an extensively redesigned derivative that incorporated a variable geometry wing, intended to address the Tu-22&#x27;s poor handling characteristics more so than bolstering its efficiency at high speeds. more than 100 Tupolev Tu-22M strategic bombers are in use.

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Britain was developing the BAC TSR-2, a supersonic low-level strategic bomber. Later variants of the type would have been fitted with variable-geometry wings. However, on 1 April 1965, development of the TSR-2 was terminated during the flight testing phase primarily due to the programme&#x27;s spiralling costs. To replace the TSR-2, the Air Ministry initially placed an option for the American General Dynamics F-111K; while the F-111K was promoted as being cheaper, this too was terminated during January 1968 on grounds of cost.

Following the TSR-2&#x27;s cancellation, BAC moved their variable-geometry work to Warton, there submitting the P.45 light attack/trainer to AST 362. This work fed into a joint Anglo-French programme to develop a variable geometry strike aircraft – the Anglo French Variable Geometry Aircraft (AFVG). This multirole aircraft was to be equipped with a variable geometry wing and was intended to perform the strike, reconnaissance, and interceptor roles. However, as early as 1966, the French aircraft manufacturer Dassault began to actively undermine the AFVG, as it was working on two competing in-house projects: the variable geometry Mirage G and the Mirage F1. According to aviation author Derek Wood, both Dassault and the French Air Force were unenthusiastic participants in the AFVG, the former wanting to pursue its own indigenous variable geometry aircraft, while the latter had determined that the type did not align with its future equipment plans. In June 1967, the French government announced their withdrawal from the AFVG project ostensibly on the grounds of cost.
Despite the AFVG programme&#x27;s collapse, the design was revamped by BAC into a larger strike-oriented variable geometry aircraft. Holding contracts were issued to BAC to support the project, which had been re-designated as the United Kingdom Variable Geometry (UKVG) aircraft. In November 1967, BAC issued a brochure on the UKVG proposal; various proposals would be issued to cover the use of multiple different engines. The quick production of a demonstrator aircraft, powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce/MAN Turbo RB153 turbofan engines, was also mooted. As solely funding for the UKVG was unrealistic, the British government pursued partners within its fellow NATO members, promoting the concept of developing and procuring a common NATO strike aircraft. In July 1968, a memorandum of understanding was signed between Britain, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada. This memorandum eventually led to the launch of the multinational Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) project, which successfully produced a variable geometry aircraft for the strike, reconnaissance, and interception missions in the form of the Panavia Tornado.

Following the AFVG effort, Dassault Aviation constructed a prototype fighter, the Mirage G, completing two aircraft, the Mirage G4 and G8, in 1968. Furthermore, Dassault also worked in cooperation with the American manufacturing interest Ling-Temco-Vought to develop the &quot;LTV V-507&quot;, which was submitted for US Navy&#x27;s VFX project. From the VFX submissions, the US Navy procured the Grumman F-14 Tomcat to replace the canceled F-111B fleet interceptor during the 1970s. The F-14 was a more nimble fighter than the F-4 Phantom II and, unlike the F-111, its variable-sweep wings automatically adjusted over its speed range, and could be moved even during turns. Furthermore, the wings could be swept forward for tight &quot;bat&quot; turns in close quarters aerial combat, as well as rearwards for dash speeds.
Rockwell adopted variable geometry for the much larger Advanced Manned Strategic Bomber (AMSA) program that produced the B-1 Lancer bomber, intended to provide an optimum combination of high-speed cruising efficiency and fast, supersonic penetration speeds at extremely low level. The B-1&#x27;s variable-sweep wings provide a relatively high level of lift during takeoff and landing, while also generating little drag during a high-speed dash. When the wings were set to their widest position the aircraft had considerably better lift and power than the B-52, allowing the B-1 to operate from a much wider variety of bases. Rockwell submitted its proposal in January 1970, competing against bids by Boeing and General Dynamics. The B-1&#x27;s development was authorised in October 1981 as a stopgap between the increasingly vulnerable B-52 and the more capable Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB). Initial operational capability was reached on 1 October 1986 and the B-1B was placed on nuclear alert status.

The Soviet Union also opted to develop a large strategic bomber equipped with variable geometry wings. During the early 1970s, Tupolev&#x27;s design, which was initially designated &quot;Aircraft 160M&quot;, featured a lengthened blended wing layout and incorporated some elements of the Tu-144, competed against the Myasishchev M-18 and the Sukhoi T-4 designs. Designated as the Tupolev Tu-160, it entered operational service with the 184th Guards Heavy Bomber Regiment located at Pryluky Air Base, Ukrainian SSR, during April 1987. The aircraft is the largest and heaviest combat aircraft, the fastest bomber in use and the largest and heaviest variable-sweep wing airplane to have ever flown as of 2020.

===Obsolescence===

A variable-sweep wing was selected as the winning design used by Boeing&#x27;s entry in the FAA&#x27;s study for a supersonic transport, the 2707. However it evolved through several configurations during the design stage, finally adding a canard, and it eventually became clear that the design would be so heavy that it would be lacking sufficient payload for the fuel needed. The design was later abandoned in favor of a more conventional tailed delta wing.

The advent of relaxed stability flight control systems in the 1970s negated many of the disadvantages of a fixed-wing configuration. No new variable-sweep wing aircraft have been built since the Tu-160.

In 2015, the Russian Ministry of Defence announced plans to restart Tu-160 production, citing the aging of the current aircraft and likely protracted development of its eventual replacement, the PAK DA project. Production restarted in 2021, marking the first new variable sweep airframes to be produced in 29 years.

<doc id="349478" wikidata="Q426423" url="?curid=349478" title="James Hanson, Baron Hanson">
<text>James Edward Hanson, Baron Hanson (20 January 1922 – 1 November 2004) was an English industrialist who built his businesses through the process of leveraged buyouts through Hanson plc. Hanson&#x27;s billion-dollar empire earned him the nickname &quot;Lord Moneybags&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; called him on his death &quot;the very archetype of the Thatcherite tycoon&quot;.

==Early life==
James Hanson was educated at Elland Grammar School near Halifax and at the short-lived Maiden Erlegh House School at Earley, formerly the home of Solly Joel. During the Second World War he served as a staff officer with 7th Battalion, the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment, before going into the family transport business.
==Career==
Hanson and Gordon White (later Lord White of Hull) formed a partnership in the 1960s, and began a greetings card business. The two men also began buying other companies, in such diverse industries as fertilisers and bricks, which all sat under the umbrella of a listed entity called Hanson Trust (later renamed simply Hanson). By the 1980s, the Hanson Trust operated in both Europe and North America, purchasing under-managed businesses in sectors such as batteries, locks and safes. He was knighted in 1976 and created Baron Hanson, of Edgerton in the County of West Yorkshire, a life peerage, on 30 June 1983.

Hanson&#x27;s greatest deal was the 1989 purchase of Imperial Group, a British tobacco conglomerate with a diversified portfolio of brand leaders in tobacco, brewing and food, and with a cash rich pension fund, that was his real target. Hanson&#x27;s team turned up in Bristol the morning of the takeover to find the Pension Trustees had closed the Fund the evening before, denying him the asset. Lord Hanson had expected to use the Pension Fund as consideration for the transaction. However, it was funded entirely by selling many of Imperial Group&#x27;s subsidiaries, leaving him with a business that made an operating-profit margin of nearly 50%.

Hanson developed a track record as a corporate raider, which ultimately worked against him in a failed bid for ICI Group, a chemical group, in 1991 which was at the time the UK&#x27;s third-largest company. ICI, led by its chairman Sir Denys Henderson hired Goldman Sachs to look into Lord Hanson&#x27;s business dealings, and they found that Lord Hanson&#x27;s partner, White, was running racehorses at shareholders&#x27; expense. Lord Hanson had purchased 2.8% of the firm, but backed away from the takeover.

The chief characteristic of a Hanson company was that of a short-term cash-generating machine, involving large scale redundancies, and the slashing of research and development to the bone - all the hallmarks of an asset stripping operation.

==Politics==
Hanson was a lifelong Conservative Party supporter and one of its largest financial donors during the 1980s.

Hanson was well known for his support of ex-Conservative MP Neil Hamilton, who became famous for his involvement in the &quot;cash-for-questions affair&quot; in the mid-1990s. He was also an active &quot;Eurosceptic&quot;, opposed to Britain joining the Euro zone, and was a founding member of &quot;Business for Britain&quot;, an anti-European Union (EU) organisation. He was also a member of the Bruges Group, which advocates a substantial renegotiation of Britain&#x27;s relationship with the EU, or if that is not possible, total withdrawal from the EU.

==Personal life==

Hanson dated Jean Simmons and Joan Collins and was engaged to Audrey Hepburn for almost a year, until she called off the marriage.

In 1959 Hanson married Geraldine, née Kaelin, an American divorcée. He became stepfather to her daughter, and the couple had two sons of their own, Robert (born 1960) and Brook (1964–2014).

==Death ==
Hanson died, aged 82, on 1 November 2004 after a long battle with cancer, at his home near Newbury, Berkshire.
